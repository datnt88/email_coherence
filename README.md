How to train a model.
1. run perm_generation.py to generate 20 permuted docs for the whole dataset
2. run cnn_email_coherence.py with different parameters to find the best model

________________ Important _____________________
The dataset contains now a folder Entity_grid_threads which contains all the threads and their permutation
Just run the run-cnn.sh 
cnn.log is the log file
