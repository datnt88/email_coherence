Is there a document that describes HTTP/0.9?
What I am particularly interested in is the format of the request line
(there were no headers, right?).
Thanks,

Is there a document that describes HTTP/0.9?
What I am particularly interested in is the format of the request
line (there were no headers, right?).
RFC1945 documents HTTP/0.9. The format of the request is (was):
Simple-Request = "GET" SP Request-URI CRLF
and the response format was:
Simple-Response = [ Entity-Body ]
with no version numbers, no response status line, and no request or
response headers.
Based on my reading of some server source code, I believe that instead
of a Content-Type response header, the older browsers apparently
understood a tag like PLAINTEXT to indicate non-HTML responses.
(Someone will no doubt correct me if I'm wrong.)

The 1.0 spec (rfc1945) has some text on HTTP/0.9 in section 4.1.
Right.

Is this pre /pre
or does anyone remember anything different?
(This tweaked my curiosity)
