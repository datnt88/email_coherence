My first cut at a Working Draft for the Test Cases is available at:
[1] http://www.w3.org/2001/08/rdf-test/
Below are some comments/suggestions (about [1] from DanC
and EricM) that have not been factored into the WD.

DanC:
I'd like to see an enumeration of the test cases, or at
least a count of them.
And/or: show the results of running one or two known
implementations thru the tests: how many pass/fail/etc?
Another nifty thing would be a two-column list
to correlate test cases with issue. Or just: the number
of issues that are now clarified by test cases.
[more for the WG to discuss...] I'd like the n-triples
spec to be incorporated wholly in this document.
EricM:
It also seems like one of the basic things missing are RDF descriptions of
these examples and a more formal association to their corresponding open
issues. Perhaps this is something for the Primer instead, but it should be
available somewhere.
I have a test harness set up to do this for a number of recent
implementations. It outputs in the format for Dave Beckett's RDF
Parser Tests. Do folks feel this is useful? What would be the
best way to present this data?
While trying to set this up, I find that some of the tests are
401 Forbidden. Also, misspellings like:
tests/rdfcore/rdfms-empty-property-lements/
should be deleted.

I have wondered whether some test cases which are not either bad RDF or RDF
&amp; N-triple may be useful.
A particular test is given two RDF/XML files simply to say if they are equal
or not.
This is useful for tests concerning things that somehow lie outside the
scope of n-triple, e.g. xml:lang, embedded RDF, xml literals.
As an example involving the first two, consider the following two files
contain the same RDF model.
*****file 1
*****file 2
We would also need this if we resolve the XML base issue to have any support
at all for xml base. (Personally I find convincing the arguments for
supporting it at least within an embedding XML document; where the embedding
document supports XML base).
I am considering creating rdf:parseType = "Literal" test cases in this
fashion. I hope that, if I do, you would be open to supporting those.
