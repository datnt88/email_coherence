I have just creatd some style sheets by hand. They look like this:
aeg_root/dyslexia.css
body {
color : black;
background : white;
font : aerial, sans-serif;
font-size : 200%;
aeg_root/low-vis.css
body {
color : white;
background : black;
font : aerial, sans-serif;
font-size : 200%;
aeg_root/standard.css
body {
color : black;
background : white;
font : times-roman, serif;
Then I did this [head aeg_root/index.html]:
!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0//EN"
"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/strict.dtd"
According to my understanding of:
this is all correct.
Invoking Amaya I get the style associated with "standard.css" which is
what I expect. What I do not see is how to invoke the alternate stylesheets.
I looked under all the menus which are available in browser mode, and under
style menu in edit mode, and in any menu I could get by clicking on
the document itself.
[Mind you, I could not see how to get this to work in Netscape 4.72, or IE5.5
either, so comments on those (off list) would help.]
I'm using Amaya 5.1 for Windows, under win98.

/tr/rec-css1 also provides a correctly linked alternate stylesheet
for testing purposes. It seems this is a 'missed' fuction within Amaya.
The menu item Style / Stylesheet allows opening , linking , removing,
and adding. It seems another item should be here to 'select alternate'
perhaps displaying the list of alternates provided by the doc author
and allowing user to choose!
The #3 browser Opera also does not seem to offer this functionality.
Is this something that he recommendation anticipated for but no
user agent followed up on (ie. similar to the table column headings/footers
that were not to scroll while rows did (if not less than window)??

Be sure to check your HTML markup code
tags by using http://validator.w3.org or
I have not tried that.
Yes, I just found that out. Mozilla doesn't seem to support this either. I
cannot see any other sufficiently advanced browser that might. Ygdrasil don't
seem to have touched Arena since 1998. Mnemonic seems to have come to a stop
last year.
I am beginning to wonder where all this is going. I know the Amaya
team is *really* small, but the others don't have that problem. There
is mention of CSS3 now, there is XSL, there are a whole load of new
things like XHTML, DHTML, not to mention XML, and still standards
of 5 years ago are not implemented.

I'm not sure we can answer this request quickly but we added it to our todo
list.
That is fine. It is not for me to set your priorities :-) and your small
team is under constant pressure...
Thank you.
