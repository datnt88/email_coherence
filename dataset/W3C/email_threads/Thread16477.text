Checkpoint 10.4 states
'Until user agents handle empty controls correctly,
include default, place-holding characters in edit
boxes and text areas.'
Can anyone give me an indication of the usability
consequences of not putting defaults into edit boxes.
Checkpoint 10.5 states
'Until user agents (including assistive technologies)
render adjacent links distinctly, include non-link,
printable characters (surrounded by spaces) between
adjacent links.'
I was using HPR 3.0 and it was reading out a group of
links separated by the pipe character '|' and every
time it got to this character it said 'baaa', this was
very offputting.
Again can anyone comment on the usability consequences
of not following this technique.
Cheers

Hi Graham,
the rationale for this one was that there were assistive technology and
browser combinations that would skip over empty form controls. I am not
certain, but I believe that this is no longer an issue. I will ask the Web
Content Accessibility Guidelines group to address this question as fast as
possible.

Hello Charles:
Good question. I don't want to generalize, so let me just give an example that does work. The example in section 11.2 of the
HTML Techniques for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 works fine. I hear
"First name colon edit"
then I hit tab and hear:
"Last name colon edit"
which is fine.
The snipet for the first name is:
Note my comments above are not about grouping form controls which is the main point of 11.2. I am just commenting on the label element.

If they have labels (using the label element) does this improve things?

Hi Charles:
I'm using JFW 3.31. I will just hear "edit".

Thanks Steven, Dave.
Can you please explain what software you're using, and what happens?

Hello:
I agree with David in that it is still an issue. The consequence is
that I will hear only "Edit" but will not know what type of information is requested.

it is still an issue although many have solved it. even though you have
to rub the text out, it is best to have something telling you where to
write because some renderings still confuse labels with edit boxes.

excuse me, but I have to jump in here. I just viewed that site with Lynx.
GWMicro tells its users (David knows this) that because the site is
designed with frames, it's recommended that IE be used, AND a resolution of
800x600. And, they are using pixels; can't re-size the text. And, there's
more... I apologize for not following the 'string'. Thank you.

I don't want to get this off topic, but we simply recommend a frames
supporting browser, although our page does read fine in Lynx. The pixels
can be resized in IE when the proper accessibility options are implemented
(ie. "Ignore font size specified on Web pages").
One of the main reasons that I joined this list to was learn more about
what we, as an Adaptive Technology Company, can do to make our site even
more accessible, not to be bashed because of our current design.

there is a good example of something that works when you tab to an edit
box without the edit box being filled at least with jfw and ie 5.5 at
the search page of:
