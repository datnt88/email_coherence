Our next teleconfernce will be
Mondays, 10:00-11:30 Eastern USA Time (GMT -05:00) on the MIT bridge (+1
617-258-7910).
Topics:
1. We've been talking about how long a block should be, but what is a
block? Lets discuss some more, starting with Michael's proposal at
(thanks Michael!)
2. How shall we track issues, including cross group issues? One possibility
is to use W3C's ETA system. There was a section set up for WAI ER
Although we haven't used it yet. Those of you who have tried it... please
see what you think. If you want to try it out you can add yourself as a
contact at http://cgi.w3.org/ETA/contacts.php3/wai/ER/?editing=1&amp;nextAction=add
(This requires member access to w3c).

LK:: "Those of you who have tried it... please see what you think."
WL: With it empty, I can't tell - the devil is in the details. My first
impression is that it's pretty much a "so-whatter". Maybe if there were
always hundreds of open/closed/total issues (or whatever) this would be
mandatory but I think it might be more trouble to use than what little
gains ensue from its use?
Love.
ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE
HTML 4 is designed to work with CSS2. And CSS2 provides an example default
style sheet for HTML that defines exactly what is a block (it can also be
gleaned from teh DTD, although that's a slower process.) Essentially certain
types of element are described as a block element (p, h1..hn, lists and a
couple of others). In a working sense it is the innermost block that is
relevant - the lowest node of the document tree that is a block, since those
above it in the tree are broken up already.

So the next question is:
Is this formal definition of a block what the average human looking at a
page perceives as a block?
It's what's perceived as a block that's revelant to blocks that are "too long".
Also, as long as people use tables for layout, we still need rules that
apply there.

The WAVE web page accessibility evaluation assistant:
Well,
using the default CSS for HTML (or for that matter taking it from the
stylesheet in operation) it means that what is rendered as a block is
defined, which is probably pretty obvious to average people looking although
blocks that have blocks inside them could also be looked at in terms of what
they have - too many paragraphs (how many is that?) without any headers, etc.
That would be the approach to take to tables as well.
