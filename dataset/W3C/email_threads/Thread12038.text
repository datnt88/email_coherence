I think checkpoints should all be "checkable". For 2.1.1,
the guideline really is:
"The authoring tool is a software program with standard
user interface elements and as such should follow relevant
user interface accessibility guidelines."
_That_ is what must be done. The current checkpoint is:
Checkpoints:
2.1.1: [Priority 1]
Use all applicable operating system and accessibility
standards and conventions.
HOWEVER, it's entirely possible to create an accessible
web authoring tool if you have NEVER read the IBM guidelines!
Following IBM's or Microsoft or Sun's guidelines are a _way_
to ensure that your program has standard user interface
elements etc -- therefore this is a _technique_ for the
checkpoint of:
[Priority 1]
Use standard accessibility user interface guidelines as for
any other piece of software.
Please rewrite this to look better and communicate in terms that
can be understood, but what we want them to _do_ is to make the
software accessible. I don't CARE if they've never HEARD of
IBM's Java rules as long as the tool works and is accessible --
maybe they read a book by Microsoft on accessible java and it
never refers to IBM, but still conveys the necessary info?
Therefore, I think that we should insist the tool follows normal
accessibility conventions but not specify that there's a special
set of guidelines (e.g. "operating system") that must be
followed. That's HOW most people will satisfy the checkpoint,
but the HOW can go in a technique, and the WHAT is something
different.
Does anyone agree or am I just insane? (BTW sorry about not
speaking up more, my throat is still sore and I talked for an
hour on the phone to grad student today...)

hile not actually agreeing, I dont think it is because you are insane *grin*.
In implementing the checkpoint there is no particular requirement that you
have read the IBM guidelines, just that you have done the things which are
standard to the relevant operating system(s), and which are applicable
accessibility conventions. In the techniques document we give references to a
number of guidelines documents to help developers find those which are
applicable to their projects.
Imagine a developer working on platform X, where there are a set of
guidelines. I would expect those guidelines if they were much good (and many
developers have produced comprehensive guidelines) to explain what the
accessibility conventions are, or to refer the reader to any other documents
which must be read in conjunction. Indeed, in the techniques for this
checkpoint requirements which commonly appear in guidelines have been listed.
Clearly they are not all applicable to all situations, and they are not
claimed to be complete. The reader is referred to documentation which is
applicable to various software types, and to various platforms, but the
techniques give them a rough idea of what they can expect from a set of
guidelines.
It is true that checking this checkpoint exhaustively may be difficult. This
is not the same as being an undue burden, and I would suggest reading a
couple of the checklists and guidelines documents linked from the techniques
to check my claim that in fact it is not really very hard to check in most
cases.

Not a bad idea, but how do we define "standard" guidelines?

I don't know if we can. Not a definitive, absolute, normative
definition without a great deal of work and without making
our document a lot less generally applicable.
Is it necessary to define "standard", though? Is it necessary
for us to have strict definitions for every single word in the
guidelines?
I haven't been participating much in the recent month or so,
and a lot of that has to do with the fact that I feel we're not
making much progress beyond semantic arguments; I have a feeling
(which may or may not be justified) that we've stopped with the
exchange of productive ideas and new thoughts and are now working
on just cleaning up the language and getting caught in
semantic circles.
And that's not particularly interesting to me; I feel like we
spend a lot of time on the minutae, and devoting a lot of
energy to specific sticking points that may or may not matter
to anyone beyond the people who bring it up, and they may just
be bringing it up for the sake of contributing and feeling
involved. (In other words, someone reading this without the
compulsion to get involved with changing the words may not be
bothered by something, but because we're on the "team", we
are working hard on these little details.)
I'm not trying to sound critical of any specific person (certainly
not Dick) or of the entire group, but I'm just feeling a sense
of running around in circles and little sense of actual
progress toward the goal. Is it because we've already reached
the goal and we're just cleaning up the little details before
crossing the finish line, or is it because we've lost our way
and are seeing the little picture instead of the big one?
Apart from the specifics of where we put the "scope" and other
terms, and apart from whether or not we split checkpoint
X.Y.Z into 2 or 3 parts, do we have all the information we
need in here? Have we got every single thing necessary, that
we know of, in order for someone to make the kind of tool we
would like them to make? What happens when we take a step
back and have a broader look?
I may just be venting steam because the pepsi my wife brought
back for lunch gave me a headache (I usually prefer non-
caffeine drinks for lunch), but I've had this uncomfortable
sense of "lost in semantics" for a while now. Tell me if I'm
off base or not?
