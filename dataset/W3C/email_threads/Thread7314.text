I agree that WEBDAV shouldn't become involved in specifying
implementations, but I do think it is not only appropriate but necessary
for us to specify requirements for access control. Perhaps the term ACL
conjures up images Windows NT, OpenVMS and some flavors of UNIX. As such,
it does sound like an implementation approach, but I think access control
is a design issue and not an implementation issue. Or am I missing the
point?

If you're going to reinvent the wheel, at least try to come
up with a better one.
I think it's the List part of ACL (Access Control List) that gets into
implementation. If I understand, everyone wants access control
specified, but doesn't want to restrict how it's done to lists,at
least in the design. Directory based, role based, ... , don't have a
list per se.

Ah...I guess I wasn't taking the word list quite so literally. By all
means it makes sense to manage the "lists" through a directory service.

How can an interoperable client deal with an access control policy if it
doesn't have an implementation that fits the structure?
I think the answer is "policy is embedded in forms".
The "access control policy" for a resource is linked metadata, but there
is also a method for associating an access control policy with a realm.
We need to define the realm, too.
