hello,
It's been a while I've not posted anything to this mailing list, but I found
yesterday
a new program to annotate any Web page.
See www.imarkup.com
This is very well done, you can highlight any text, use brushes to draw on the
page, also attach
notes...
You can send an annotated page by email.
It only works for IE, but a version for Netscape should come.
It is in the spirit of Yawas (the little javascript-based annotation tool I
wrote last year and which I'm still
improving) but the user interface of IMarkup is much better !!
A great thing with Imarkup is that when you visit a page you've annotated, the
software automatically inserts the annotations once the page is loaded. They
must have a kind of ActiveX attached when an instance of IExplorer
is loaded so that this ActiveX can receive events from IExplorer.
I found out a way of doing that also using Band Objects (history and favorites
are kinds of band objects). But if the user closes the Band Object, it seems it
is no longer able to receive events from IE, and then cannot automatically
insert the annotations on an annotated page. IMarkup does that even if the
IMarkup Window is closed.
So maybe somebody here knows more about the technology... I would be interested
since some users have requested I implement this in Yawas.
Thanks,
Laurent.
the
But with imarkup you can't exchange annotations with a server. Pfui.
Probably because there is no W3 standard for doing so. Which we'll need to
do one of these days.
I still want to find the time to develop a compatible ThirdVoice server...
anybody else have interested in this?
FYI, I've been having a lot of fun with my glossary-style annotations, but
nothing is ready yet to publish, I just have a custom solution which works
with our cvsweb program. So I'm not presenting at WWW9 or HT00. Too bad.
Anybody for a BOTF at either one?

We are interested in creating a annotation system using a similar technology basis. I agree with you regarding the problem of managing the placement of seed points for further annotation. However, I see this as a management problem, where different solutions may work best for different contexts.
For example, if a political party prepares a campaign platform in which they identify their stance on a number of issues, it makes good sense that they should prepare, in advance, seed points for annotations. Beyond that, it makes good sense that those annotations should be managed within a framework which makes it possible to aggregate them and measure the political support for each aspect of the campaign.
Here is an example that lies somewhere in the middle. A newspaper publishes content, perhaps the editorial pages, perhaps business articles or articles on the national or world economy. Clearly the paper can manage the creation of specific seed topics for annotation-based discussions. Further, it may be in the paper's interest to manage those topics over time, so that an historical trace of discussions related to a topic may be easily explored. (This assumes that a topic is a specific concept that may be represented by multiple annotation seeds.) However, I also see it as beneficial that people should be able to create new topics which are of interest to them, but not pre-identified by the paper. Without this facility, it may be difficult for people to feel that they have a fair ownership in the process. They are effectively restricted to discussion topics posed by the paper and restrained from identifying their own topics -- a real turn off.
However, there are other examples where it does not make sense for me to have the author, or any other party, control what may and may not serve as a seed for further annotation. Consider an active community of interest, say research on connectionist (neural network) models. If an annotation system is introduced into that community, it is only the parallel efforts of the members of the community that will be able to create and manage a sufficiently broad and rich set of topics for both new and historical materials that relate to current research interests.
I see a problem with managing scale for annotation systems. This includes the problem of managing topics, the definitions of those topics, and the specific referents in documents that serve as seeds points for annotations. It also includes managing the aggregation and abstraction of annotations and leveraging the expressed knowledge for search and decision making support.

Julie,
I looked over your product and the business model that you are following.
I see a problem with managing scale for annotation systems. This includes the problem of managing topics, the definitions of those topics, and the specific referents in documents that serve as seeds points for annotations. It also includes managing the aggregation and abstraction of annotations and leveraging the expressed knowledge for search and decision making support.
As you can see, from my other post, I feel that a broader range of solutions is necessary. I am interested, and maybe we should take the discussion of business models out of the group, in why you chose the specific business model, which is clearly tied to your assertion that

Your other point,

is also very interesting. I feel that there should be interchange and encryption support for annotation and collaborative systems. I am particularly loath to create content in a database owned by a third party (e.g., ThirdVoice). The lack of interchange standards means that I can not obtain copies of that information and limits my ability to develop intelligent behaviors that exploit the annotation base to create information or services. Collaborative systems without open source implementations (or an least standardized and exposed interfaces) make it difficult to integrate that technology to create new products and services.
Encryption support would let people safely leverage a third party system technology for sensitive discussions, e.g., to apply a public annotation portal for discussing business internals. I feel that, by combining encryption and interchange, we can create new, perhaps transactional, business models for annotation and other collaboration and knowledge management services.

Bryan,
This makes a good checklist to compare annotation solutions against:
scale
topics and how to define them
document referents
aggregation and abstraction
Our approach leaves most of these issues in the hands of the owner of the topic, in fact a topic is defined in our terms by the combination of a set of URIs with a group of interested members. The set of URIs is finite but the group can be completely public. Until I read through the Desire pages I had not thought of a method of dynamically assigning the set of URIs but I can see that could be an added on feature of our system.
Scale is going to depend on the database in terms of simple size and how many annotations are humanly useful at a seed and still leave the original document readable. We have found that we have to create regular archives for our demo page because it gets too full to be useful.
Aggregation and abstraction is going to depend on the user, by storing all annotations in an XML database we assume that they will be as useful as the owner can make them With your suggestion of collecting opinions you have pointed out that the annotations could be structured to collect a limited set of feedback which could then be abstracted.
I'd be pleased if you would look through our planned features page and add other suggestions. So far we have found that our system will be extensible to all of these future features but we are slightly(!) limited by resources.
I'm not sure what you mean by our business model. Unless you use this phrase to refer to the fact that we have developed only one aspect of an annotation system. It's not that we were theorists about annotations but that we were using the web for a purpose; developed a way of carrying out that purpose (teaching to a group and using feedback from the group to add to the accessible content of the web pages) then realised that what we were doing was a form of annotations.
This means that we keep in the front of us that original purpose and since it's been complex enough applying that limited set of requirements we have not attempted to generalise. My justification of creating seed points is a post-fact justification, from our initial application when we were collecting responses from students and hand inserting them into the HTML we realised that it was kept more readable when we collected them at points rather than randomly dispersed them throughout the page.
I think that the main role that I can perform in any attempt to create standards is to ensure that our application of annotations on the web can remain as a subset of any theoretical descriptions.
will XML be able to solve this? maybe a combination of an annotation DTD with other special DTDs depending on the topic.
There has to be a different between the implementation and the actual data. If the annotations are stored in an XML database then they will be accessible (with the owners permission and that's another whole topic!) to anyone with any form of XML editor. In the case of the mechanism itself I'm not sure where the interface would be, can you explain a bit more?
Ahh! I haven't really tackled this aspect. We're planning to set up a service on our own server to do this soon, with access restrictions managed by the owner of a topic, but I hadn't considered going so far as encryption support for the actual content. Up to now we have seen PageSeeder as being a product that we sell to be installed on customers' servers but we have hit many limitations because our users are not technical people and they have to convince their technical departments to install it and it's required java servlet runner, database and jdbc driver.
Wow you've dragged me away from our current project which is to set PageSeeder up on an Excelon system which will mean that the original documents will all be XML so that there will be a seamless storage system for both the annotations and the original document fragments (in fact this project will enable the user to exchange whole paragraphs in the original document with annotations to create a new document.)
But I'm pleased to find some movement at the station.

Bryan,

document referents
aggregation and abstraction
yes, and also how to maintain annotation link integrity, especially for fine-grained annotations.
Our approach leaves most of these issues in the hands of the owner of the topic, in fact a topic is defined in our terms by the combination of a set of URIs with a group of interested members. The set of URIs is finite but the group can be completely public. Until I read through the Desire pages I had not thought of a method of dynamically assigning the set of URIs but I can see that could be an added on feature of our system.
Scale is going to depend on the database in terms of simple size and how many annotations are humanly useful at a seed and still leave the original document readable. We have found that we have to create regular archives for our demo page because it gets too full to be useful.
That is interesting. This may also be a function of the annotation structure. E.g., argument-based models vs relatively unstructured commentary models. Most annotation systems fail to explicitly manage the organization of information, e.g., as a knowledge management activity.
Aggregation and abstraction is going to depend on the user, by storing all annotations in an XML database we assume that they will be as useful as the owner can make them With your suggestion of collecting opinions you have pointed out that the annotations could be structured to collect a limited set of feedback which could then be abstracted.
I am primarily interested in structured annotations based on cognitive models, in particular, annotation systems for supporting argument-based reasoning. Arguments are relatively easy for people to externalize (when compared with causal models). I see the aggregation of arguments as partly a matter of applying a consensus policy (to dynamically aggregate estimates with regard to the truth of individual propositions) and partly a matter of abstracting the view of the argument. (Crit.org did some work on the latter with contextures in an argument-based representation.)
I just read through Libby Miller's paper on aggregating annotations using RDF, which presents yet another view on aggregation.
I'd be pleased if you would look through our planned features page and add other suggestions. So far we have found that our system will be extensible to all of these future features but we are slightly(!) limited by resources.
I would be delighted to do so. Can you point me directly to this URL?
I am interested in creating an commercial grade open source annotation project. It is my hope that this will make it easier for people to develop specific products and services based on annotation systems.
I'm not sure what you mean by our business model. Unless you use this phrase to refer to the fact that we have developed only one aspect of an annotation system. It's not that we were theorists about annotations but that we were using the web for a purpose; developed a way of carrying out that purpose (teaching to a group and using feedback from the group to add to the accessible content of the web pages) then realised that what we were doing was a form of annotations.
I see. You have a particular problem in mind, relating to education, and developed the technology to address that problem. I did not realize that. I had thought that you were approaching "annotation" market more broadly and using a pay-per-seed structure as the revenue model.
This means that we keep in the front of us that original purpose and since it's been complex enough applying that limited set of requirements we have not attempted to generalise. My justification of creating seed points is a post-fact justification, from our initial application when we were collecting responses from students and hand inserting them into the HTML we realised that it was kept more readable when we collected them at points rather than randomly dispersed them throughout the page.

The lack of interchange standards means that I can not obtain copies of that information and limits my ability to develop intelligent behaviors that exploit the annotation base to create information or services. Collaborative systems without open logies and interchange standards, people and businesses should be able to use public servers and have confidence in (and control over) the access control policy.
Wow you've dragged me away from our current project which is to set PageSeeder up on an Excelon system which will mean that the original documents will all be XML so that there will be a seamless storage system for both the annotations and the original document fragments (in fact this project will enable the user to exchange whole paragraphs in the original document with annotations to create a new document.)

Hello everyone, this list has gone very silent, and there doesn't seem to be anyone at
all in Australia - I was asking so that i could invite them to the launch in Sydney of
our new agreement with Allette Systems to host PageSeeder and make web sites available
which can carry pageSeeder annotations.
I you're still interested in annotation software take a look at us again - we've set up

Any future plan for synchronous sharing of annotations?

Our whole idea is based on asynchronous annotations, but they can be
used in a pretty synchronous way as long as you either keep attentive to
your emails or keep refreshing your screen!
So no - no plans for that development!

Hello everybody,
I am trying to integrate Web co-navigation with annotation in real-time,
using a standard browser. With this tool users will be able to exchange
ideas referring to specific portions of the shared web document.
Asynchronous annotation will also be supported as a subclass of this more
general type of annotation.
I have not come across too many references in this area. I would appreciate
it if someone could point me to some past/ongoing related projects.
Likewise, any comments on the significance or usefulness of merging
co-navigation with annotation sharing would be appreciated. I wonder why
there is so little work in the academic/public press.
This work is part of a larger framework, called e-coBrowse. I will come back
to it if there is enough interest.
