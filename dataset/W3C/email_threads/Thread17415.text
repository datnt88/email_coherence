Strangely the winner in the games category http://www.orisinal.com has
an interface rather similar to peepo.co.uk, even to the extent that the
page is 'greyed' out and the links gain saturation onmouseover, however
they chose flash rather than SVG.
any plans for an accessibility or usability webby?

orisinal.com was around before SVG was invented (and I have to say that as much
as I normally hate flash I'm a big fan of orisinal).
Jon,
I also like orisinal, surely no surprise there. It would however be
much easier to repurpose the interface and games, if they were in SVG.
perhaps arguably more accessible too.
Is there any benefit to orisinal being in flash? you seem to suggest
there might be.
thanks

Not really, although at the time the site began Flash had an obvious advantage
over SVG in that it existed, and SVG didn't!
Whether SVG would be just as good could only be determined by porting the games
and seeing. Given that the games were designed to take advantage of Flash's
strong points I would be surprised if they would all be as playable -
especially since the viewers are relatively recent and still at a stage where
each new version has considerably better performance than the previous.
I'm not sure that porting to SVG would automatically bring an improvement in
accessibility. In particular given that the point of most of the games is to be
visually attractive tests of hand-eye co-ordination it's hard to imagine them
being used by anyone other than users of graphical browsers with good eyesight
and good motor skills.
