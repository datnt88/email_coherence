Provide a few word description of the table with the "title" attribute.
PJ: I don't agree with also adding a "title" attribute, it is too redundant
and there are no examples of why it would be needed. We are asking the
author, tools, and browser to do too much and loose them in the process.
Even if a browser rendered the "title" attribute, what would it add as far
as accessibility in addition to the surrounding text, caption, summary, and
table itself? "Title" attribute was not in the original techniques [1], why
add it now?

TITLE is useful as an aid to structural navigation. For example, a
speaking browser that is traversing the document structurally could
announce the title of the table. However, I agree that TITLE is redundent
if CAPTION is present, and would recommend using one or the other (at the
author's discretion), but not both. Also, it should be recalled that in
the guidelines, this entire matter (of table summaries etc.) is a priority
3 item, in which case the argument that the author is being required to do
too much, relative to the access advantages, carries less weight.
i concur with phil. i had used the title early on and it wrecked havoc on
pwWebSPeak and other tools as I would get the alt and title spoken so it
provided redundant words. I also would be concerned that this would
convolute implementation.
i have not used title since and have avoided it. unless i am missing the
point, i do not see any value added. what does title bring to the table?
