Thanks Al, I also put your document link in the action items page.
We need to merge yours and Gregg document into one or at least to
indicate relationship between them (e.g. requirement and propose
solution).
Reply to: RE draft guideline
Just a couple comments about Al's document:
I agree strongly that all images should have a text description of some kind, be it separate or located on the same page. However, I think there are two categories of descriptions which should be considered: objective and critical (or interpretive). Objective descriptions simply provide information about what's happening in the image; they let the user provide his or her own interpretation. They are similar to audio descriptions used in movies and television programs. Critical or interpretive descriptions, on the other hand, can be used to provide either subjective opinion, where appropriate, *or* interpretive analysis which may not be immediately deduced from an objective description. One need not exclude the other: a chart or graph may require an interpretive description in addition to an objective one. I would think that, in most cases, an objective description would do the trick. However, I think these two types of descriptions should be kept separate. In other words, is it possible that some images will require two descriptions?
Al, in your recommendations you state that links from from a description page back to an image should not be used. I've always thought that a "return" link from a description back to its image was a useful navigational aid. I also think that, in the case of an image map or other selectable image, a description which provides text links corresponding to the graphic links is a good idea. Am I misunderstanding your point? Can you elaborate? Thanks.

I think the need for subjective or critical comments is real but it
goes beyond images and WAI: it is about what W3C calls "Collaboration"
(I'm not sure what is the status of this effort right now, you can
check http://www.w3.org/Collaboration if you're interested) whereas
one should be able to annotate sections, images, entire documents on
the web, so that people can access to the comments when they read the
original document (with all the grouping, authorization, etc
necessary).
The (R1/2) in the Subject says that this is the first of two
replies...
This is really good. There are some rather fine-grain distinctions
I want to clear up; we are real close.
to follow up on what Geoff Freed said:
First point:
There are two possible interpretations of "linking to the image."
One is to link via the URL for the image file. I tried to say
people should do that. The other is to link back to where the
image is used by an IMG tag in an HTML page. That is the return
link that I am arguing against. This second kind of link would
have to change every time you use the image in a different page.
If the description is 100% about the image, then it can be reused
unchanged along with the image. If there is a hypertext link
back to where the IMG tag was, then the description document is
locked to the page where that IMG tag appears and you can't
re-use it.
I am reacting, here, to some language that is in the San Jose
guidelines. I may even have mis-interpreted it. But I read it
to say "put a hotlink at the end of the description that takes
the user back where they came from." I have had situations in
the past where I got to coach people to put "use your browser
BACK function to return to where you were" instead of a
hard-coded hotlink so that a page could support multiple paths
that lead to it.
Second point:
The idea of a text page which provides links covering "everywhere
you can go from the Image Map" is a good idea to me, too. I
tried to say every image map should have one of these, and
furthermore it should always be what you get as the response to
selecting the coordinates (0,0) or any other coordinates outside
the sensitive regions. Eyeball-oriented authors may not want to
define a DEFAULT response, preferring that clicking outside the
intended sensitive areas be an error. In that case we may have
to fall back to the idea that (0,0) is sensitive and goes to the
text navaid. In any case I agree with you that this page should
exist.
Yet finer detail: I suggested that authors consider upgrading
their images to sensitive status with one link from the default
region to the description document. I would accept this as an
alternative to linking from the text, if there is no natural home
in "text that the author would have put on the page anyway" for a
link to the description.
Thank you for letting me try to clarify this.
Al Gilman
The (R2/2) indicates the second of two replies
to follow up on what Geoff Freed said:
... I would demur on the "all." I hope we can articulate
priorities for which images really need descriptions, because I
don't think we're going to get all.
I agree that this distinction is useful. I tried to say that
description is required and interpretation is OK. I agree that
the description and interpretation should ideally be presented in
a way such that the visitor can tell the difference. A good
writer will communicate this distinction using natural language
cues. What kind of a "keep it separate" rule would you envision?
So far I am not coming up with anything that looks like a real
winner.
In terms of what works now, you have to look at what Jamal Mazrui
is doing to take multi-file web documents and make them available
as single-file text documents for blind people. The offline use
of the screen-reader is their analog to our dumping things to the
printer. I'm not sure that yet more separate files would deliver
a net usability benefit in the end.
One of the issues that I realized is floating in my mind on this
objective/subjective issue is the question of who is doing the
describing. NCAM and RFB&amp;D have been in the situation of
furnishing descriptions as a third party. These groups have
developed a "just the facts" ethic to a high level because
they are systematically providing third-party transcriptions in a
lot of cases.
One of the great things about the WWW is the way it often
eliminates the middle-man. If we can get to the authors of the
Web content, we have a first-party description situation. Here
the approach can be much more free to "articulate your message"
and is not limited to the "just the facts" domain of the
third-party intermediary.
I hope this notion of first-party speech vs. third-party
transcription will help communicate why I don't think that the
best practice from NCAM and RFB&amp;D experience translates directly
into recommended practice for web authors. Guidelines requiring
objectivity are natural for third-party transcription. I think
they are problematical for first-party annotation.
-- Al Gilman
Reply to: RE  draft guideline (R1/2)
I get it-- if the same image is used on several pages, one single description at one single location will suffice. If you're linking to this single description from multiple paths, the "return" link isn't such a good idea. Your idea of "use your browser's 'back' function..." is good. In theory you *could* use a hard-coded "return" link if a description was used only once for only one image, but for the sake of consistency in design, I think I'd support the back-button idea for all descriptions.

I think the use of server-side image maps should be strongly discouraged
in favour of client-side maps, which have been officially available since
the release of HTML 3.2. The above solution is appropriate to server-side
image maps and may perhaps be offered in guidelines as an alternative, but
I think the most important message which should be communicated to authors
is that for the benefit of accessibility, they need to make use of
client-side image maps with proper ALT attributes. In fact, if I remember
rightly, the ALT attribute is required in the elements that designate the
regions of a client-side image map.
to follow up on what Jason White said:
Here is the situation the way I understand it, based entirely on
unverified rumors and inferences:
Authors and WebMasters would not presently use a user-side map
without a server-side map because not enough browsers have
implemented the user-side map feature. The auxiliary text
navigation page that Geoff suggested is usable with a server-side
map processing, or with user-side map processing. The need for
this page is way less if you have a good USEMAP with well-written
ALT entries. But its presence is no problem for the use of the
USEMAP as well. The only difference is that if everyone were
using USEMAP already, the recommended way of linking to an
image description would not be by the default but by a dedicated
region (perhaps including 0,0 ) with ALT="text description of
the image".
I haven't reviewed the structure of the USEMAP element to see
how discursive one can get in wrapping the links in text. Sometimes
it takes more than just a list with ALT text in the links to
convey the graph created in the image, as for example:
"The cabinet departments are arrayed around the White House in a
circle to emphasize their equality of rank, as Arthur sat his
Knights at a round table so none would fight over seats.
In alphabetical order, they are list of links "
The reason I didn't rely on USEMAP in my writeup is that I had
internalized the assumption that it is so poorly supported by
browsers in the field now that authors cannot use it except
redundantly on top of server-side image map support. This, as I
said earlier, is based entirely on unscientific methods of data
collection and analysis and it would be helpful to know more
about how thorough or spotty the implementation of USEMAP is
among browsers in the field now. The whole issue of USEMAP
vs. Yet Another HTML Page as the text-usable navigation bridge
for a sensitive map merits further consideration.
Al Gilman
I agree that a long description of an image map may in some cases be
necessary if the required information can not be conveyed by associating
an ALT attribute with each of the defined areas on a client-side map. All
web clients that comply with the HTML 3.2 specification should fully
support client-side image maps. Any failure in this regard should
certainly be addressed in the education and awareness aspect of the WAI
project. Again, this is a "time frame" issue. Perhaps the guidelines
should, in the first place, strongly discourage the use of server-side
image maps, and then offer a solution for those who still insist upon
using them.
I agree, and wonder how close we are with the text included in the
Trace unified guidelines at:
I just a got a mail from Mike Paciello forwarding a request from Jamal
to get HTML4 as one single text document.
As I said in my answer, before doing the HTML to text translation, a
single HTML document must be created from all the little documents
that make up the specs today. A simple concat will not do it since the
multiple HEAD/BODY would create parsing problems.
So a script must be written than does just that, in the order of the
TOC probably. Any summer programmer available ? (if not, I'll try to
get someone to do it at W3C, but our resource are scarce in this
area).
Al again:
Funny you mention this third-party description since (and I'm not sure
I mentioned it to this forum already) this is also something I thought
about for regular ALT (out of the objective/subjective focus) a while
ago.
The idea would be for some organizations to maintain an "ALT
description server", or AltServ, and for users looking for ALT text to
go ask this server if the description in the source is not present (or
useless).
Sighted users willing to help could fill in the database (one database
entry: URL of image, ALT text) when they browse the web and hit IMG
with no ALT (in the source or in the database). Different ways to fill
the database could be via an email procedure, or some Web form.
AltServ-aware browsers would automatically fetch the ALT text from the
server (or its closest mirror) when no ALT attrib is available: it's
transparent for the end-user. If there is no ALT in the database, one
could imagine an additional service where the images with the most
no-ALT "hit" could get prioritized and "ALTed" first by the sighted
friend circle.
Anyway. I didn't exactly invent this architecture: this is pretty
close to a third party PICS rating system where the PICS label is the
ALT description.
The biggest non-technical drawback I see is that it doesn't encourage
self-ALT-description, which is probably the best in the long term.
Thank you for the reference. The Trace recommendations on this point are
excellent, and I fully support the policy of emphasising client-side image
maps as the preferred approach. The only change that I would suggest,
taking up one of Al's earlier comments, is that in some cases it may be
important to provide a link to an over-all description of the image as
well as ALT text for each of the active areas. For instance, in the
example provided in the guidelines concerning the image of a motorcycle,
it would be helpful to have a general description of the vehicle as well
as ALT text associated with each link.
This would seem to be the same issue as D-tag or LONGDESC
Yes?

Indeed, this is the same issue. The proposed LONGDESC (formerly ALTSRC)
attribute for the IMG element would presumably enable long descriptions to
be associated with image maps. I have not looked at the coding in detail,
but the HTML 4.0 specification also provides an example of an image map
constructed using the OBJECT element. It should be possible to create a
link to the long description in this case as well. User agents, perhaps
with the aid of styles, would need to render the LONGDESC link differently
from other links that are associated with the image map.
Is the LONGDESC attribute a URL or an embedded text string? Or could it be
either and the the browser can figure it out?

The value of ALT is a text string; the value of LONGDESC is an URL which
refers to a detailed description of the image. It is anticipated that many
images will not require long descriptions. However, for those which do,
ALT and LONGDESC would be used together within the IMG start tag. It would
be the responsibility of the HTML user agent, guided by any applicable
styles, to render the LONGDESC attribute appropriately and to distinguish
it from other links so that the user is aware that it refers to a long
description.
img src="http://www.somewhere.org/figure1.png" alt="figure 1"
longdesc="http://www.somewhere.org/figure1-description.html"
The longdesc COULD point to text lower on the same page... or to a separate page.

This is correct. However, in most cases, a separate page would probably be
required, since presumably most users who do not wish to read the long
description would not appreciate its being included as part of the
document. Perhaps if it appeared at the end of the text, under its own
heading, those who chose not to read the description could readily ignore
it. One solution might be to create a separate document which contains
long descriptions of images that appear at a particular web site or in a
particular directory. Each such description could be named and referred to
in LONGDESC attributes by means of an URL fragment:
longdesc="http://www.somewhere.org/descriptions.html#description3"
I would not recommend putting all the long descriptions together on a page unless they are very carefully labelled. It is very confusing when you get there. Most people don't get that they should only read part of the page and then jump back.
Putting each on its own page would be option 1
Putting them all at the bottom (as an appendix if you will) is another. It allows access if you download the document but has the same problem cited above unless each paragraph is very carefully labeled.

If the image is a MAP link would the recommendation be to put the text
links in the long descriptions or to have the text links be part of the
original document; or do both?
Also if the LONGDESC is used for audio and video links there may well be a
text description available in the source document, making the LONGDESC a
target tag (see white house pages).

I agree that long descriptions for images and other objects should each be
placed in a seperate file rather than placed together. Implementing long
descriptions in this way makes it easier to automate the accessiblity
authoring process in HTML authoring packages. For instance if a file called
foo.gif is placed in a document, the HTML authoring package might search for
an existing foo-desc.html file that could be used as a default. If the file
is found, a D-link (or other linking method) could be set up automatically
by the authoring package; if the file is not found, the user could be
prompted to write one without having to worry about setting up a whole new
document. Widespread use of description files will only be a realistic goal
if the description formats chosen are easy to author, update and re-use.
