I'm working on Mozilla a little, and need some clarification regarding a
few properties in the HTML DOM. I'd like to be able to make a number of
properties that contain URIs according to the HTML spec resolve the URI
wrt any applicable base URIs when accessed. The problem is that a number
of these are not actually defined as containing URIs in the HTML DOM
level 2 spec. An example would be the code attribute on an
HTMLObjectElement
(http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/REC-DOM-Level-2-HTML-20030109/html.html#ID-75241146).
Can these properties return an absolute value, even if the source
document contains a relative one?
Then of course there are the properties that contain a space seperated
list of URIs, which is more complicated, but I think is straightforward.
I'd like to make them return a space seperated list of absolute URIs.
This is a known issue in the HTML specification:
However, the erratum still needs to be done...

So what needs to be done in order to get the erratum out? May I go ahead
and change it in Mozilla?

A decision from the DOM WG. Luckily, that should happen next week.

Well, I suppose I'll just wait another week and see what happens.
Thanks,
