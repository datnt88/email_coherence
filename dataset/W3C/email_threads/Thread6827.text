One HTML element that I really find I miss in the xmlspec DTD is the var
element. I usually work around this using emph. Here's a sample of the
sort of thing I would like to use var for but now use emph:
For each node emph x /emph in this node-set, the second operand is
evaluated with emph x /emph as the context node and 1 as the context
position and 1 as the context size; the result in each case must be a
node-set. For each node emph y /emph in this node-set, a range is
added to the result node-set of the nt
def="NT-RangeExpr" RangeExpr /nt ; the starting end-point of the range
is the starting end-point of the covering range of emph x /emph ; the
ending end-point of the range is the ending end-point of the covering
range of emph y /emph .

Thanks for suggesting this. A "syntactic metavariable" element has been on
my own wishlist for a long time (you'll see it's mentioned in the issues
list), and I think there's enough motivation to add it now. I'll put it
into the next revision.

Fine with me. In the meantime I think code is better than emph. That's
what we use in the DOM spec.
