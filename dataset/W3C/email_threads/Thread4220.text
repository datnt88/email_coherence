In the penultimate line of ordinary text in 3 an "element" is given as an
example of an "item".
However, the definition of an "item" in XQuery 1.0 is an atomic value or a
node.
Is there a need for editing here or an inconsistency in definitions? Was an
"element node" intended in 3?
In passing, 3.1 uses an element (and its content) as an example of using
xf:error.

I think the terms "element" and "element node" are synonymous. An element is
a node.

Isn't your use of "element" a significant departure from that in XML 1.0?

I don't find it problematic. XML 1.0 is interested in the syntactic
representation of an element using angle brackets, we are interested in a
different representation of the element using a node on a tree. But it's the
same element.
