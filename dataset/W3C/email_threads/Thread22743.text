If I have a readonly Document Node, and I call getElementByTagName on it,
should I return a readonly Nodelist?
Is this right also for readonly Element Node?
Thanx

At this time, there is no way to make a Document node readonly using the
standard DOM API. The only readonly nodes we currently support are those
within the scope of an EntityReference.
You could have a readonly Element node, of course.
There's no such thing as a writable NodeList (NodeLists can only be changed
by changing the source document), so the question isn't meaningful. Of
course the nodes within the NodeList are the same Node objects that appear
in the DOM tree, and hence may themselves be readonly.

Well, a NodeList is not really readonly. The Nodes contained in the NodeList
can be readonly. If you ask for the childrens of a readonly element node,
they will be readonly by definition [1]. So all the nodes contained in this
NodeList will be read only.
