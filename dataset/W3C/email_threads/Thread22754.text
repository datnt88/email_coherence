Hi, there!
I just got started with XML::DOM. It is very good. But I don't see many
examples on the internet site. That gets me in trouble. So, I am asking you
for help!!!!
What I am trying to do is to merge two different XML documents. If I do the
following thing, I get DOM Exception errors. It says that I am trying to do
this from two different document sources. Looks okay to me, but it seems
that I have to do something else to merge two different XML documents, but
nowhere can I find an example for this. Will anybody know how to do this?
my $parser = new XML::DOM::Parser;
my $doc = $parser- parsefile ("foo.xml");
my $ctl_doc = $parser- parse(" Sample This is a test /Sample ");
$jobrun_info_node =
$doc- getElementsByTagName("JobRunInformation")- item(0);
$jobrun_info_node- appendChild($ctl_doc);
$doc- printToFile ("out.xml");
