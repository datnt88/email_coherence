I just download amaya-src-1.0a.tar and thot-src-2.1a.tar and started to build
it with gcc-make 3.75 and gcc-2.7.2.1 on a DECstation 5000/200 with Ultrix
4.4.
1) I had to build the dependent libraries individually (jpeg, png, zlib, www)
as the makefile fails without any obvious error. I'm not to worried about
this.
2) The Ultrix 'ar' does not accept filenames over 15 characters. The
filenames are being truncated:
ar: Info: filename presentationapi.o truncated to presentationapi
3) And finally when 'making' amaya, I get this:
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
/usr/lib/cmplrs/cc/ld:
/lib/libX11.a(XKeyBind.o): XLookupString: multiply defined
make: *** [/users/ftp/Thot/DEC/bin/amaya] Error 1
Thanks,

Ok, not really a problem.
This is harmless,
That's a glitch to be abble to imput ISO-Latin chars in Motif
dialogs the same way as it's done in the standard text.
Edit Thot/amaya/EDITOR.A, and remove teh use of the Lookup package
USES
HTML, Lookup, NoStructSelect
to
USES
HTML, NoStructSelect
and restart make amaya. It should recompile the dialogue schemas
and most of the C files, and hopefully finish the link,
This is explained in the compiling guideline for Amaya at
section
If make failed:
Subsection
an error occured at link time:
Item 6
If amaya linking complains about XLookupString
hope this help,

Thanks for the quick response. As suggested, I removed the 'Lookup'
from Thot/amaya/EDITOR.A. However, I still get the same link error:
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
/usr/lib/cmplrs/cc/ld:
/lib/libX11.a(XKeyBind.o): XLookupString: multiply defined
make: *** [/users/ftp/Thot/DEC/bin/amaya] Error 1
This still happens even if I remove and rebuild eveything from the
tar.gz files again, edit EDITOR.A and do a "make" and "make amaya".
Thanks again,
