1] also found that setting of temp directory
also refuses spaces in folder names ;.....
2] set location of homefile directory which home icon
brings up nicely..... but i cant find a way of making
this my starting location.... each start of browser
brings your default screen instead ... i was able to
start at my own home page in 2.2
3] one nice thing is that i can full screen my view window
and save the configuration now .... this is good workaround
but windows philosophy is to AUTOMATICALLY retain this
info and not force user to save it... but at least it
can be saved without using editor to bit fiddle an ini file
so i will not complain any more abt this item.....
so it boils down to folder name restrictions and bad
colors on a 256 color pallette.......
frames is a BIG fix item so i am sure that item will
get lost

I'll test that and your cache report tomorrow. After sleeping a bit :)
You mean that even thought you use the Special/General menu to specify
a home page it isn't taken into account?
Works for me (under linux).
Au contraire. Your request is in our wish list. We couldn't comply with it
for this release because of lack of manpower, but it's something that
will get done. As you say, it simplifies the life of users and the Amaya
team also consists of Amaya users :)
John, thanks again for your report. If we are able to reproduce the bugs,
we'll fix them and rollout a new dist tomorrow.

Amaya is able to manage different documents at the same time.
Suppose I have two opened documents on my screen, the main document
A I'm working on and another B I want to refer to.
I could resize the window of the document B because I just want
it doesn't take too space on my screen. That doesn't mean that I want
to have small windows for all documents.
Irene.
