I'm trying to do something totally reasonable with RDF and the web,
but I find myself going against a WebArch "good practice". How could
I possibly do this better? This smells to me like a leak in WebArch
notion of URIs, but I brought it here because it's close enough to the
hoses connecting WebArch to RDF Semantics.
We have four URIs:
(M1) http://www.w3.org/2002/03owlt/equivalentClass/Manifest003#test
This is what the WebOnt WG decided to name a particular OWL
test. You, as a human or machine, can learn more about the test
by dereferencing the URI (doing an HTTP GET). You should get
back some RDF/XML information about the test. A nicely
formatted version of that information (plus some more you'd get
by following some more links) is at:
(H1) http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-test/L#equivalentClass-003
Meanwhile, I've been assembling an aggregation of results for
OWL tests. As a human, today, you can visit
(H2) http://www.w3.org/2003/08/owl-systems/test-results-out#test57
and see a row in a table about this test. You'll see it's a
pretty easy one. (Even my fairly-lame OWL reasoner passed it!)
That's also not a very stable fragment id. Next week it might
land you on the results of another test. Sorry. But that's
part of what I'm trying to fix.
Mostly, though, I want to allow more varied views of the same
data. I want to provide that data in RDF! I think the right
approach is to use a URI like
(M2) http://www.w3.org/2003/08/owl-systems/test/equivalentClass-003#test
which can be used in RDF like M1, denoting the same test, but
which on dereference provides the test results data, along with
a triple saying it's owl:sameAs M1. [1]
This seems reasonable, doesn't it? Two names for the same thing; when
you follow them you get information about the thing; you get different
information when you follow different names. For some applications
you'll use the first name, for others the second. There are other
people building test-results browsers; they should have access to the
same data.
Useful, practical, easy to do, and... seemingly contrary to TAG
advice. The current WebArch document says, "If a URI has been
assigned to a resource, Web agents SHOULD refer to the resource using
the same URI, character for character." [2]
So where is the breakdown here?
Is this just the normal RFC 2119 escape from a "SHOULD": "there may
exist valid reasons in particular circumstances to ignore a particular
item, but the full implications must be understood and carefully
weighed before choosing a different course." If so, I wish the
document would spell this out better, saying what some reasonable
exceptions might be.
It seems to me a lot like having two web pages about the same topic.
Surely that's not something Web Arch wants to warn against.
Maybe this is just a natural outgrowth of using URIs simultaneously as
(1) logical constant symbols naming objects in some domain of
discourse and (2) network addresses naming virtual end-points for
communication. Since we're using them in two ways at the same time,
they can be equivalent in one way, while being completely different in
another.

[1] Actually, I want to use 303-See-Other redirection instead of a
fragment URI, so I can merge in the human-readable view as well,
but that's orthogonal, so I'll pretend otherwise for now.

I think so, but after just a quick read, I'm not sure if you
should have worked harder to not make up a new URI...
I'm not sure there is one.
Isn't it clear enough? By introducing a synonym, you've introduced
a cost on anybody who wants to realize that the two terms refer
to the same thing (along with various risks that they'll eventually
diverge, etc.)
This text seems clear enough to me; what are we missing?
To help parties know when they are referring to the same resource, it
follows that URI producers should be conservative about the number of
different URIs they produce for the same resource.
Thus, the parties responsible for weather.example.com should not use
both "http://weather.example.com/Oaxaca" and
"http://weather.example.com/oaxaca" to refer to the same resource;
agents will not detect the equivalence relationship by following
specifications.
There may be other ways to establish that two parties are identifying
the same resource that are not based on string comparison; see the
section on future directions for determining that two URIs identify the
same resource.
2.8.2. Determination that Two URIs Identify the Same Resource
Emerging Semantic Web technologies, including "DAML+OIL" [DAMLOIL] and
"Web Ontology Language (OWL)" [OWL10], define RDF properties such as
equivalentTo and FunctionalProperty to state ? or at least claim ?
formally that two URIs identify the same resource.
It's not clear to me that the two pages should use different
names for the thing. (like I said, quick read...)
No?
Web Arch is giving advice that's pretty widely agreed
in data management, no? http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?OnceAndOnlyOnce
No, things won't halt and catch fire if you make copies,
but making copies does introduce risks of divergence, etc.
And synonyms are sort of a pain to deal with.
That too... as I say: once you make two names, you introduce risks
that their meanings may diverge.

Hi Sandro,
I think the wording in the referenced part of the WebArch doc is probably
poorly expressed.
The intend of the wording (as I understand it) is that if your given a URI
for something (eg. with a representation, or out-of-band buy word of mouth
etc.) then you should make references with it as given. Don't expect minor
'spelling' variations work work (hence the oaxaca/Oaxaca example.
"Assigned" is probably the problem word... certainly the wording was not
trying to suggest that there is one true canonical assignment of a URI to a
given resource, only that if you 'obtain' for referring to a given resource,
then you should use it as obtained...
Does that help?
