OWL ought to include a syntax for defining non-global
keys. For example, suppose the classes Employee and
EmployeeHistory both share the attribute hasSSN.
One would like to be able to assert that 'hasSSN' is
a key for instances of Employee, but not for instances
of EmpoyeeHistory. InverseFunctionalProperty does not
permit this.
Currently, single valued restrictions on properties
can be stated globally or with respect to instances
of a Class. Similarly, range restrictions on properties
can be stated globally, or with respect to instances
of a Class. By analogy, keys should have similar
flexibility.
The property we have in mind for specifying a key
would have domain Class and range Property. One
might call it something like 'hasKey' or 'classHasKey'.
However, if we are broad-minded, we will recognize
that sooner or later we will also want to support
compound keys. So perhaps it could be called
'hasSimpleKey' or 'hasAtomicKey'.
When n-ary relational tables are converted into RDF
format, each table maps to a class and each of a table's
columns maps to a property. If a table has
a compound key (a rather common-place occurrence),
then one would like to be able to map its key
restriction to RDF as well. That would require
that we support the notion of a compound key. For
example, the class EmployeeHistory might have the
key hasSSN, historyDate .
A property representing a compound key declaration
might map a Class to a List. Perhaps this property
could be called 'hasCompoundKey'.
Provisions for supporting key declarations appear
in the OWL "wish list". Given how fundamental they
are in real-world modelling, they ought to become
more than that.

Bob - thank you for your comment, the working group will consider it
and get back to you

Dear Bob-
Thank you for your comment, the working group has considered it
carefully. With respect to qualified keys, we considered how this
could be added to OWL - see the discussion thread starting at [1] and
particularly [2]. The group considered the addition of Qualified
Cardinality Restrictions, which we believe are needed to implement
the sort of global keys you need. However, the WG decided to
postpone the issue of QCRs as discussed in my response to Alan Rector
at [3].
We also considered the issue of Compound Keys. We decided this was
an important enough area to open an issue on our issues list
explicitly. We did not, however, come up with a solution as to how
to address these. Instead we also decided to postpone this issue.
The issue text is:
TITLE: Compound Keys
DESCRIPTION:
Relational Databases often use keys that are composed of multiple
fields. OWL allows keys using owl:InverseFunctionalProperty for a
single field (property). It would be desirable for OWL to provide
the compound keys capability as well.
STATUS: POSTPONED
RAISED BY: J. Hendler based on a Last Call comment raised by Bob
MacGregor:
Closing Comments:
While compounds keys would be desirable to add, there is some
difficulty in adding them in the current OWL syntax, similar to the
problem arising for "qualified" properties (see discussion under
issue 3.2). In addition, for the OWL DL profile, it is still
something of a research issue (c.f.
how these are best realized by DL reasoners. There is also a
question as to whether mixing datatype and object type in a compound
key would be allowed, and whether it would cause difficulties to
reasoners.
Please let us know if this decision to (a) acknowledge that our
design is lacking, but (b) postpone further design work to a future
version is acceptable.
