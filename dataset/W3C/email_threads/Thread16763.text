I am currently carrying out a benchmarking survey of a selection of Web
sites. The survey will look at measures such as the size of entry
points,? quality of HTML, WAI compliance, etc.? I will be using
Web-based tools, so that the method can be seen by all.? I'll also be
using freely-available Web services, so anyone can try the survey for
themselves.
There is a question of business justice, here.? It is not fair to rely on the
free Web-interactive services such as Bobby at CAST for survey purposes.?
Bulk work such as surveys should be performed with resources provided by the
activity doing the survey.? This is partly where our clunky 'robot control'
system came from.? There have been problems with U.S. activities bringing the
free over-the-Web Bobby service to its knees in a de_facto denial-of-service
attack by putting production loads on the web-published service. Use the free
service for samples, please. Not for surveys or other production runs.
Those who wish to survey should reasonably expect to pay. There is no excuse
for assuming that people will render you great gobs of service for free. That
which is appropriately _de rien_ is in the eye of the service provider, not
receiver.

I totally agree with Al here and I would add this, the Late Len Kasday
pointed out over and over that no tool can completely check anything for
accessiblity. It takes human Intervention. It takes someone who knows what
they are doing to check the results of the tools.
Also Bobby can be downloaded from CAST. Al is right, you use this tool from
the web for large projects and no one else can use it. I have had it happen
to me.
Al is also right in saying people should not expect to get a good analysis
for free. Tbese things take time and skill. To expect to get it for free
is totally unrealistic.

If the folks at Bobby are concerned about abuse of their free services, I
recommend they implement a way to limit the number of these free uses by IP
or site. If you set a limit of 25 pages per ip/site, you would pretty much
curtail any abuse. Beyond the 25, the users should know whether or not
Bobby meets their needs.

Interesting point.
At the last W3C AC meeting I suggested that W3C should flag their
various services (e.g. HTML and CSS validation, XSLT transformation
services, etc.) as to whether they were intended from production use or
as pilots. I don't think that's been addressed yet.
I don't think you can say that just because something is for free, it
shouldn't be used intensively - the open source lobby won't like you for
saying that!
Also the services are funded somewhere - and it may be that the funding
is to provide a global service. This is the case for W3C's validation
services.
Other free services may encourage survey use, if it increases traffic to
their site, and therefore advertising revenue.
So I would say it was for the service provider to define their usage
conditions.
Note we should propably distinugush between automated use by programs,
and embedded URLs which are initiated by humans. I was referring to the
latter use - e.g. see http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue28/web-watch/ .

That will penalise people who use the net efficiently by using shared
caches. Although the true source is often available in the request headers
this is not guaranteed, and normal analysis programs don't try.
