Font foundries and designers have been vocal in their fear of font embedding
on the web, and now it seems their fears were well-founded, at least in the
case of Microsoft?s new browser, Internet Explorer 4. The browser?s new
OpenType font embedding feature has a fatal security flaw that makes it easy
for any user, even those without technical knowledge, to capture embedded
fonts from a web site and install them into their system for use with all
their software. No one other than myself has yet uncovered the simple steps
to do so and I will not reveal the steps here, because I don?t want people
pirating fonts.
Microsoft knows about the problem and has stated it will do nothing to
correct it.
With over 2 million copies of IE4 distributed in the past two weeks alone,
IE4?s font embedding may not adequately address the protection of the
intellectual property rights of font designers and foundries.

I believe, though I could be wrong, that IE4 is not OpenType savvy, all it is doing is accessing embedded TrueType (with the aid of WEFT), as many other apps can do.
I'm not saying this is a good thing, just that OpenType isn't the problem (in this case at this time).
But I'll just broadcast the fact that it's so simple and see if I can tempt a few thousand people into trying?

Well...
Seems like a reasonable option, given that MS says it won't do anything
about the problem. I assume (from that comment) that Daniel first notified
MS about this. Presumably, if they were going to fix it, he wouldn't have
posted this. Now that the whole world (so to speak) is working on cracking
this, MS may have some incentive to get off their *#$)&amp;&amp;% and *fix* it.
If you have a better option, I'd be interested in hearing what it was.
Cordially,

How does going to the OpenType Jamboree next week sound, you know,
talking to the people that are actually developing this stuff, seem like
a good idea?
Then we can talk about OpenType, rather than a subset of it, TrueType.
-- Clive
I did contact MS first--that's why I have their statement. I'd hoped they'd
remove WEFT until they found a solution, but instead they just brushed it
off as the OS's problem. That's not an answer, that's an excuse.
Perhaps with the OpenType Jamboree next week in Redmond there'll be some
pressure to correct this quickly. With it public, they can't continue to
ignore the problem until it's too late to correct it.

For the porpose of embedding: TrueType and OpenType
is the same thing. OpenType is a more like an extension of TrueType
than TrueType a subset of OpenType.

Correct. The signature table in OpenType has the potential to improve
overall security, or at least make stray copies easily identifiable, but the
security re. embedding is still based on the embedding bit information.
Foundries need to be clear about the importance of the ebedding bit, and it
helps no one to speak of 'stupid' foundries if the foundries have been
misinformed. Nor is it helpful to speak of 'stupid foundries' if a new
technology (WEFT) extends an old technology (font embedding) to a new
medium. It is quite within reason that a foundry might have little
opposition to font embedding in Word documents, but serious opposition to
embedding in websites. The potential for piracy is drastically increased by
web embedding. For a font to be embeddable in a Word document increases the
value of that font for the user, and this increase in value may offset the
risk of piracy. When the risk factor is increased, this will almost
certainly no longer be the case.
When Adobe first invited the major type companies to extend their EULAs to
permit embedding in Acrobat, they were less than forthright about the
security risks involved. I wonder to what degree MS stressed the importance
of the embedding bit setting; after all, embeddable fonts increase the value
of MS apps.
