Here is the features matrix that we had talked about in the last meeting.
Some of the boxes in the excel sheet due to lack of knowledge I left blank.
I am going to also take the excel spreadsheet and put it into a HTML
webpage. That will be ready in the next couple days.

WSTF: questions below for all WSTF. minor revisions for Justin. ~ shawn
1. Best to have just one version for now, rather than keeping two
different versions up-to-date. I think we discsussed using spreadsheet
for now IF that worked for all task force members, and then put in HTML
when done at the end.
2. A few revisions and additions:
ID 1 "Alternative Sytle Sheets"
- In "User has the ability to pick from multiple different style sheets
that would change the design of the homepage of the WAI site." take out
"homepage" (sice it would change the design of all or lots of the pages,
not just the home page).
ID 2 "Build Your Own Style Sheets"
I think that this is a function of the browser, and not anything that we
would do as site designers.
- If that is correct, we should remove ID 2 from the list.
ID 3 "WAI Subsite Search"
- add to Notes column: not just www.w3.org/WAI but also the WAI
"technical reports" (guidelines, techniques, notes, etc) that are in
www.w3.org/TR/ and the WAI mailing list archives in
lists.w3.org/Archives/ and maybe some things elsewhere.
- perhaps clarify "as opposed to the entire W3C site" ?
not sure what "keyword" means here (&amp; in ID4)?
ID [new] "Index"
- add new item:
name: Index
description: alaphabetical index of content (e.g., like
note: "less important if have WAI-wide search. very important if not
WAI-wide search"
3. WSTF, Is it appropriate to also use this list for addional content
that we'll need/want? How does this relate to the EOWG Deliverable wish
list (http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/EO-Deliverables.html)?
For example:
- new home page content
- new navigation pages (e.g., probably http://www.w3.org/WAI/Resources/
and maybe 1-5 of them)
- new [Web Accessibilty Roles?Pieces?or?] (interactive graphic showing
authoring tools, user agents, assistive technologies, content developers
users,...)
- new [Why Web Accessibility ? or Benefits of ? or ?] (showing three
carrots &amp; a stick, labeled &amp; makybe interactively expand to more
details. clearly links to relevant pages in Presenting the Case for Web
Accessibility resource suite and Policies Relating to Web Accessibility)
- new [Using WCAG 1.0 and Techniques] (illustration showing relationship
between WCAG &amp; techniques docs)
- new intro page to online overview slideshow
(www.w3.org/Talks/WAI-Intro/)
- revise QuickTips page (www.w3.org/WAI/References/QuickTips/)
- revise "About WAI" page (www.w3.org/WAI/about.html)
- new interface to examples in curriculum
(http://www.w3.org/WAI/wcag-curric/oversam.htm)
- new Introduction to Web Accessibility (illustrated one page overview)
- new overall FAQ (mostly pulling from other docs)

#1 ID 2 "Build Your Own Style Sheets"
I had in mind something more akin to what the AFB
(http://www.afb.org/myafb.asp) offers - pick and chose the
settings that suit your needs.
Ah, OK. Then, I'd say leave in ID 2 and fix the description, and add in
the notes that link to AFb as an example.
Also, for ID 1 ("Alternative Sytle Sheets") can put in notes example:
"Select a Style Sheet (CSS)" at http://www.trace.wisc.edu/sitehelp/
#2 ID [new] "Index"
I think a good site map and a WAI search capacity are far
more important than an alphabetical index. If we had a
site-map, but no WAI search, I would still only rate this as
low-medium.
ok with me.
i got the idea when looking at different categorizations of things,
e.g., having all the checklists under "C" and techiques under "T" - in
addition to site map categorization.
(note that WAI search might be complicated and have not yet figured out
the feasibility of getting that soon...)
ID 3 "WAI Subsite Search"
In reviewing the MITS/Parking Lot list
(http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/UCD/mits.html) I found this that we
should include on the features matrix:
- ability to refine search, search within results, easily construct
complex queries without knowing boolean stuff
I think that the purpose of this list isn't as much to list new content but
more to list new features or functions that we are goign to have one the
webiste. It's more new functionality that we are going to add to the
website, like searches, dynamics calendars, login's, things that people are
going to have to interact with.
Like if the events calendar was just an events calendar, it wouldn't be
appropriate to put it on this list. It fits on the list because the user has
the ability to submit their own events for people to see on the calendar,
it's a new feature versus new content.
The feature's list originated with Michael so he would probably be able to
tell best, but that's what I would guess should go on the list.
