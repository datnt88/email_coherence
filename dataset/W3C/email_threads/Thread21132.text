Characters in system charset (win1250) that are not in iso-1
charset are not mapped correctly when saving file. (their value from
win1250 is kept, not translated to unicode).

Without request from the user Amaya doesn't change the document charset.
If you want to change it you have to use "Save As" and chose the new charset.

I will describe this bug more properly:
I make a new document, type symbols like ??,??, etc.
When I save it for example in us-ascii, these symbols are replaced with #xNNN,
where NNN should be unicode value of these (??,??,...). But Amaya places its value in
system charset (win1250) instead, so that some other symbol is displayed in all other browsers.
Thank you.

Numeric character entities give the code position in the document
character set. If the document is using Windows Code Page, then it is
correct for the &amp;#xNNN; references to be referring to Windows CP character
numbers and not Unicode ones. See section 5.3.1 of the HTML 4.01
Specification.
If you are observing a browser interpreting entities in a way not
consistent with this, it is the browser at fault. Amaya's behaviour
appears to be correct.

Example of the bug:
character ' ?? ':
Unicode value: 0x159=345, in UTF-8 hex C5 99
iso-8859-1: doesn't contain it
Win1250(windoze system charset for central European languges): 0xF8=248
In Amaya it is saved (doctype XHTML 1.1, but same behavior for HTML 4.01)
as &amp;#xF8; in "us-ascii";(!!!)
as asc(0x3E) in iso-8859-1 (???)
as hex C3 B8 in UTF-8), which corresponds to 0xF8
but cp1250 is not mentioned anywhere in the document. And in iso1, and
unicode this value corresponds to '??'.
So it MUST be a bug in Amaya.
Charset us-ascii is, as I know, 7-bit
In Mozilla Composer (for example) it is saved as
as &amp;#345; in x-user-defined charset and also in iso-8859-1
as hex C5 99 in UTF-8
The problem is everywhen the character is in system charset and absent in
iso-8859-1 (ie. first 256 of Unicode)
Yes, there're obviously several problems related to proper encoding.
Maybe they're easier to reproduce by using the ??? character for people
working on Western computer systems.
Amaya - I'm using in 7.1 with Windows XP - will output a character
reference &amp;#x80; with US-ASCII, and a "raw" ??? character with ISO-8859-1.
In the both cases, its behaviour is wrong. It should use &amp;#x20AC;,
&amp;#8364; or &amp;euro; instead.
In a previous message I stated that numeric entities give the code
position in the document character set. Someone has pointed out to me that
"document character set" is a fixed concept with respect to SGML
applications like HTML and XML, so my commentary about Amaya being correct
in outputting Windows Code Page code positions is misguided. Ah well, what
can you do when the reference implementation is broken? :-(
Too many years with MIME I guess...
Apologies,
Archer
