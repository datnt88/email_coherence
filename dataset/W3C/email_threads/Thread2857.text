Anyone top this one? http://wearables.stanford.edu/
And of course, it speaks HTTP/1.1...
The Stanford gadget looks smaller
than Itsy (see: http://www.research.digital.com/wrl/itsy/index.html),
which has a display, on the other hand.
Itsy runs off of triple A cells, at much lower power...,
so Itsy is clearly the champ on hits/joule...

This What about this one:
It is 2x2 in, 1.5x1.5 inch core logic without I/O pins
It connects directly to a modem. Contains PPP server, TCP/IP and HTTP.

Looks pretty small to me. But we'll have to get you and Stanford to
compare notes on exactly who is smaller, as theirs is pretty tiny
as well.
So far in the race we have:
Stanford and ULM for smallest size
Compaq Itsy for slightly larger, but much faster.
And we can now generate a bunch more bogus performance metrics, like
hits/joule of energy, Hits/cubic CC/second, and other fun useless metrics
of performance.
