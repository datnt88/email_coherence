There is an inconsistant behavior in how the 2 major DOM implementations
(IE/Mozilla) treat cases in ID attributes when referencing elements with
getElementById.
Consider the following example:
alert( document.getElementById("crapper").innerHTML );
IE will disregard cases and display "first", while Mozilla will honor cases
and display "second".
The DOM Level 1 recommendation is not clear about which to use.
DOM Level 1:
getElementById(elementId)
This method returns a Element.
The elementId parameter is of type DOMString.
DOM Level 1 2nd Ed.:
getElementById(elementId)
This method returns a Element object.
The elementId parameter is of type String.
To settle any doubts I ask: Which behavior is correct?

IDs are case-sensitive in HTML. Therefore "crapper" and "crappeR" are
different IDs that could belong to different elements.
