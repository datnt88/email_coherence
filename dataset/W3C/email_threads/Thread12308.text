On the call it was suggested that there be a way to differentiate the
checkpoint numbers of WCAG from those of ATAG and that is clearly
necessary. One suggestion is to leave out the word "checkpoint" and
designate them as "WCAG 3.1" or "ATAG 7.2".
When "Reference:" is used under a checkpoint to WCAG it shouldn't be so
general but should isolate where to look (I guess this has already been
brought up but needs reinforcing) so that the "feel" intended for
hyperlinks is evident. I don't know how practical this is since the
target snippet would have to be marked and is beyond the control of this
document. Maybe all the destinations could be gathered in one place to
make this process work fast?
The Sample under 1.1 shouldn't be a general statement - it *must* point
to an actual sample. This should be true of all samples.
Love.
ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE
On the whole I would prefer real examples to fictional ones. In most cases
there is a good real example of a technique (A-prompt may not be a complete
solution, but it is an example of a number of techniques nonetheless).

For the record, when I say "based on A-prompt" in my techniques piece, I
usually mean I have modified the dialog from a correction configuration
to a prompt configuration. However, sometimes the images are only
A-prompt design ideas.
