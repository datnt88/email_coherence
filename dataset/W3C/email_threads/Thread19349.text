There is an error in the code that handles the Backspace key.
Here is how to recreate it:
1) Create a new HTML document
2) Type some text
3) Hit the Enter key
4) Hit the Backspace key
Notice the placement of the cursor; it is one space to the left of where it
should be. I looked at the code for TtcDeletePreviousChar(...) which
handles this case. There is a flag called moveAfter that causes the
undesired cursor movement. The problem is that I don't completely
understand the conditions that sets this flag. Can anyone shed some light
on this for me?
Code from TtcDeletePreviousChar(...):
/* delete the current selection instead of the previous char */
CloseTextInsertion ();
/* by default doen't change the selection after the delete */
moveAfter = FALSE
if (pViewSel- VsBox != NULL)
moveAfter = (pViewSel- VsBox- BxAbstractBox- AbLeafType != LtText ||
pViewSel- VsBox- BxAbstractBox- AbVolume == 0);
ContentEditing (TEXT_SUP);
if (moveAfter)
TtcPreviousChar (document, view);
Thanks again,

I guess this problem was already solved in the CVS version. It didn't come
from this piece of code but from the function LocateSelectionInView
The variable moveAfter is set to TRUE when the current selection points to
a box which is neither a text nor an empty box.
If you have " b AAAAA /b a xxxx,/a BBBB" and the anchor is selected, the
instruction
"ContentEditing (TEXT_SUP)" removes the current contents of the
selection ( a xxxx,/a ) then moves the selection to the beginning of the next
element
(BBBB). As it's a delete previous we have to call the function TtcPreviousChar
for
moving to the end of the previous element ( b AAAAA /b )

Oops I didn't test exactly that case.
You're right, when the Backspace deleted the last paragraph of the document,
the new selection was misplaced.
This is the bug fix:
if (pViewSel- VsBox != NULL)
moveAfter = (pViewSel- VsBox- BxAbstractBox- AbLeafType !=
LtText
pViewSel- VsBox- BxAbstractBox- AbVolume == 0);
ContentEditing (TEXT_SUP);
- if (moveAfter)
+ if (moveAfter &amp;&amp;
+ pViewSel- VsBox &amp;&amp; pViewSel- VsIndBox  pViewSel- VsBox-
BxNChars)
TtcPreviousChar (document, view);
Irene.
