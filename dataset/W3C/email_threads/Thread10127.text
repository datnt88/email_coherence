As we move towards publishing last call (i.e. after approval on 13th Dec), I
propose the following:
0) Ignore link errors between our docs prior to this process.
1) designate an editor of each document who has CVS access to W3C as the
"publishing editor".
2) create a subtree on W3C CVS somewhat like the TR/2002 subtree (but empty)
3) "prepublish" the editors drafts into that mirror tree.
4) for each of the documents update all the links into other RDF Core WD to
be links to that subtree.
5) Run the link checker at this point.
- there should be no links to any of our docs in the real TR space, but
only to our copy of the TR space.
6) Once everything is pubrules happy
7) Take a copy (not CVS) and global substitute the root of our subtree with
the root of the real TR tree.
(a small Unix script can do this)
8) This copy is then given to the publication team.
Requirements:
all docs must be ready on time
all docs must have a publishing editor
unix somewhere

Or use relative URI-references? Isn't that what they're for?

They won't work with the latest symbolic links ...
Nice try.
