I'm marking the following issue:
What status code should be returned when a lock null resource is created ?
200 OK or 201 Created? A related issue is what status code should be
returned by a PUT or MKCOL on a lock-null resource? MKCOL is defined to be
201, PUT could be 200 or 201 (201 seems like a slightly better choice).
...as resolved by our apparent consensus on the addition of the following
wording for a status code for LOCK requests...
201 (Created) - The lock request succeeded by creating a new resource
and the value of the lockdiscovery property is included in the body.
Discussion in the thread that includes the following posting by Stefan...
BTW: Jim W. objected when I made this suggestion a couple of months ago.

Note that Jim's objection was not in the new context,
in which the LOCK on an unmapped URL creates a regular
resource. I am sure Jim will withdraw his
objection in this new context (:-).

Tim,
Actually Jim wasn't disagree'ing with you on what we propose here. He was
additionally proposing that the first PUT after the resource is created
*also* return 201. I don't think that issue is on the issues list. If
Jim advocates it again, we can put it on the list.
was
*also*
advocates it again,
I'd object to such a proposition since it contradicts a RFC2616 SHOULD
requirement for modifying an exiting resource with PUT.

Tim
