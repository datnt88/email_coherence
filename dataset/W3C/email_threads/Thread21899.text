I've uploaded a variant of the earlier copy.xsl to http://home.houston.rr.com/curta/copy.xsl that now adds subject metadata elements for the last method or attribute invoked (assuming that it is the best subject for the test) or any method wrapped in an assertDOMException . For exceptions, it also adds a subject for the exception code and for the code within the description of the method.
The transform requires that dom1-interfaces.xml be in the same directory.
Great, thanks! I've got a copy -- I'll run it
through the tests and should be ready to
commit them today.

I ran the transformation over some of the test
files and noticed the following:
In attribute values that have single quotes surrounding double quotes, the double quotes
are transformed to  -- do you think
that this will cause any problems in the end?
I've attached textWithNoMarkup.xml and the
translated version, n.xml -- Note the value for
'"Roger Jones"'.

The timing would be great since I could spend some time with them over the
weekend.

I had noticed that earlier. Only the aestetics are different, any XML
processor should see them as equivalent. If you think
"whatever" is ugly, you could do a global search and replace to
change them back to '". However, I wouldn't bother.
Okay -- I'm a little further -- all the tests
seem to translate, but any test that has
a member subelement as part of a
var declaration does not carry it's
attributes through the translation. I've
attached an example, the translated file,
and the transformation. I've changed the
transformation slightly -- added
contributor and date .

I had overlooked two (non-metadata) elements that have significant text content, comment and member. Adding the following template will process those two elements. All other whitespace will be
discarded.
xsl:element namespace="http://www.w3.org/2001/DOM-Test-Suite/Level-1"
Looks good -- I'll rerun them.
