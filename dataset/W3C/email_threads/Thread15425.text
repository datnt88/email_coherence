Hi,
Finally got a chance to go over the recent drafts. Just a point.
1.3[CORE]
Under Definitions for Checkpoint 1.3 there is this phrase; "Presentation is
the rendering of the content and structure in a form that can be sensed by
the user."
What is meant by "sensed"? It's wording that is rather foreign to me. It's
kind of "touchy feely". I'm thinking "easily comprehended" rather than
sensed.
Yours truly,
Geoff Deering
Jeff, good question about "sensed" versus "easily comprehended."
All the checkpoints under guideline 1 are (or should be) aimed at making
it possible for users to actually *perceive* content-- that is, to be
aware that it exists. It's a much lower level of abstraction than
understanding (which the checkpoints in Guideline 3 address). The issue
of whether I understand a given resource is moot if I don't even know
it's there.
So the notion that content can be "sensed" isn't as fuzzy as it might
sound: in fact, sensing/perceiving is much more readily testable than
"understanding," which is as fuzzy and vast as the sky. And as
important, of course.
Hope this helps!
John

Would it be worth officially defining some of these terms in the
document at some point? As the use cases showed many people using this
document will want it clearly stated with no ambiguity. It is important
that we don't let our familiarity with the documents or the processes
and thinking that have gone into them stop us from seeing how non GL
users see the documents.
Personally I think that "sensed" is fuzzy enough in this case, to make
it worth either defining at some point in the document, or re-terming.
Perhaps "Presentation is the rendering of the content and structure in a
form such that users are aware that it exists." would be a better way of
phrasing it.

In that case I feel it should read;
"Presentation is the rendering of the content and structure in a form that
can be
perceived by the user."
We are dealing with Guideline 1: Perceivable. This would be consistent with
the guideline. Also 1.4 states, "All characters and words in the content
can be unambiguously decoded. I feel "perceivable" strengthens this as it
is the word that is used to define this guideline, and is also directly
appropriate in this context.
"Sensed" can refer to an intuition about the presence of something, but
still with some uncertainty (I sensed something was there, but I was
unsure). It could mean that you sensed that content or navigation is there,
but there is no positive way to interact with the medium to confirm this,
yet at the same time you can't deny it. It leaves a question mark about the
whole experience, it is a word, when used in this context, conveys
uncertainty. Perceived means you did actually have some confirming
experience of a perception that the object was there, through whichever
sensory organ you wish to establish communication with that medium.

This is a very good point Tom.
I think there is some cause to take the draft of this document and show it
to people who are not familiar with it, but are familiar enough with the
issues to revue it with a fresh perspective. The document has to clearly
define the guidelines, but also be in a language that is common and easy for
all those involved in web development to understand. It is important that
it is very clear and easy to understand for all.

Jeff, thanks for unpacking what was "fuzzy" about the word "sensed." I
think "perceived" would be an excellent substitution, for the reasons
you outline.

Well I suppose the public comments received on WCAG 2 will help. Also the Edu and Outreach Work Group has reviewed the June draft of WCAG 2 and sent in their comments.

I guess that is giving it enough exposure. Can?t really do much more than
that.
