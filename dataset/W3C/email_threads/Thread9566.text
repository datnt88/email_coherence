Thank you Patrick for your strawman proposal and provoking a discussion
which I hope will ensure we express ourselves carefully and wisely.
Your action is recorded in the draft minutes as:
ACTION 2002-12-06#3 PatrickS: draft one paragraph about
rdfs:isDefinedBy and other terms to draw out them for readers of
the primer
which looking at the transcript:
was result of a comment from Frank:
FrankM: isDefinedBy mentioned not described in the primer. Do people want
that added? If so, let me know.
With regards to isDefinedBy, I think it would be fine for the primer to say
nothing about it. If the WG felt that the primer would be enhanced by a
short description, I might suggest something along the lines of the
following would describe the WG's decision:
It is often useful to indicate in an RDF graph where the definition of a
class or a property, or indeed any resource, may be found. The
rdfs:isDefinedBy property may be used for this purpose. This property may
be used to indicate an RDF Schema that describes the resource, however, RDF
imposes no constraints on the values this property. If the resource that
is the value of such a property is retrieved from the web, it may be an RDF
Schema, but there is no guarantee that it will be.
This text lacks the lightness of touch and ease on the readers eye that I
would hope for in the primer, so does require some help from the editor,
but I hope indicates the sort of thing we might usefully say in this document.

Writing with the lightness of touch and ease on the readers eye for
which he is so well known, the editor asks: when might the WG be
expected to express its considered opinion on this subject?

Interestingly, the text in the Vocabulary document would suggest that
any value of rdfs:isDefinedBy is expected to be an RDF schema, since
it is a subPropertyOf rdfs:seeAlso, which is described in the Vocabulary
doc as
"rdfs:seeAlso
The property rdfs:seeAlso is used to indicate a resource that might provide additional RDF information about the subject resource."
Perhaps "RDF" is there by accident? "RDF information" sure sounds like
an RDF Schema to me...

One of my comments on the schema draft that I have sent to Dan is that's
not what I recall the WG agreeing, but I confess I haven't checked the
record yet.
Brian
I suggest Frank you set your own deadline and use your judgement as editor
of what is the sense of the WG, e.g. if you haven't heard by ... it
will/will not go in.
