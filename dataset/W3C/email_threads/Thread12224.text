I'm sorry - like Jutta I was on a train but I couldn't find a phone
on my train.
I worked on the appendix for prompts and my suggestions are attached
- mostly little things but it is tricky stuff and so I think getting
it very clear and simple is important. The content and ideas seem
fine to me.
Liddy
Thanks Liddy,
I have put up a new version of the Appendix at:
New things:
-Changes from the meeting (including Carlos's idea to remove grouping of
prompts)
-Liddy's changes.
-New screenshot for how the real-time prompting of a secondary author
might look.
Thoughts?
Cheers,
Jan
PS: I hope to have the new tools pages up tomorrow.
