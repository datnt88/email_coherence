In section 1.1.3 of the DOM Level 2 Traversal spec., the first block of
code includes these expressiosn:
Node child = n.firstChild()
child.nextSibling()
Since this appears to be Java code, I believe they should read:
Node child = n.getFirstChild()
child.getNextSibling()
Or, in JavaScript, they should be
var child = n.firstChild
child.nextSibling

Beware assumptions. We never stated the language, as far as I can tell, and
note that what Java calls getFirstChild() _is_ just called firstChild() in
the ECMAScript bindings, due to different local naming conventions.
I honestly dont't know whether this code would be acceptable ECMAScript
either -- I can read that language but haven't written it.
If not, there may be a case for fixing it so it's one or the other. Or
there may not be. This is only intended as pseudocode in any case, since
the DOM is language-independent. If the concept is clear, that may really
be all we need.

In ECMAScript (JavaScript), it would simply be firstChild, with no
parentheses.
No, it wouldn't be acceptable ECMAScript either, because in that binding
firstChild and nextSibling are properties, not methods. Also, the code
includes variable declarations using Java syntax, not JavaScript
syntax.
The code isn't valid Java or JavaScript, and I think it is fair to say
that it would not be valid in any binding. The firstChild and
nextSibling attributes in the IDL either need to be mapped to
properties, or to methods. But, if they are mapped to methods, they
really need to have their names changed to indicate whether they are
getter or setter methods. So I think these should be getFirstChild()
and getNextSibling()

Certainly using the get/set syntax is no less appropriate than the implicit
version, even if we continue to claim this is pseudocode... OK, I think I'm
convinced that we should accept this as an editorial erratum.
