i have been thinking about an xml based transfer and control protocol
for future applications. it would serve some of the same functionality
as HTTP, but would be much more flexible and could perform operations
other than just simple file transfer. the main focus here is that it
would be a general protocol using xml, and could be extended by all
sorts of applications for communication. is there already a working
group to develop such a protocol, and if not, would there be any
interest in one?
let me know what you think.

Bart,
Look at the SOAP project in the W3C.
It was proposed in the IETF about a year ago but fell as a lead balloon; now
it has showed up in the W3C instead.

SOAP may have been a lead balloon, but BEEP certainly is anything but.
See http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/beep-charter.html for details of
what the IETF is doing in this general area.

Arguably a quality issue for the W3C's Architecture participants, and the
subject of heady enthusiasms in the marketing arms of the XML communities.
Cheers,

There's also XP, which has similar buoyancy issues.
