Document.getElementsByTagName's parameter is named "tagname", Element.getElementsByTagName's parameter is named "name". Doesn't matter in the big scheme of things but it does complicate production of the test markup language. If possible, could parameter "name" be changed to "tagname" in DOM L3 Core.
This is also something which matters for languages in which
parameters may be identifed by name at the call site:
o = get_document_or_element(...)
While most users will use the positional syntax, this would typically
be expected to work in Python.

It is annoying that they are inconsistent, but breaking deployed code is a non-starter. I would recommend that care be take to avoid unnecessary inconsistency of parameter names on identically named
and shaped methods (and hopefully those are pretty rare) if more are added in the future.
To be sure I understand the rational here. How about DOM Level 1 and
DOM Level 2 production of the test markup languages?

As I mentioned elsewhere, it does matter for languages which support
named parameters at the call site.
I'd say it sounds more like an unintentional inconsistency in the
specifications, and issuing an errata making the names consistent
would make more sense in the long term.

A patch is automatically applied to the recommendations before generation
of
the test markup language to change the parameter name in
Element.getElementsByTagName from "name" to "tagname". I had forgotten to
patch the Level 2 spec which caused the issue to surface again as a code
generation error on the recently checked in tests.
Some languages are already using the parameter names to pass them to the methods,
as Fred pointed out in [1]. It would be a non backward compatible change to
rename
the parameters. Unfortunately, we didn't think about that in the past and were
not
careful about the names of the parameters. This is now part of our concerns
for DOM Level 3.
