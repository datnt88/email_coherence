Irene VATTON:
I recompiled the SGI version to solve exactly this problem, but it seem I
forgot
to recompile print.
We plan the do a new release this week. I'll check that in new release.
Regards and thanks for information
Irene.
I now installed the version 1.2a. But now all the
'config/*-printdialogue' filfes are missing. 'de-printdialogue' is
missing also in the sources. Is it not yet translated completely?
These files are only necessary if you start print in standalone.
The print process displays a warning message but works.
I can post these files (including the de-printdialogue) on our server
if you are interested.
Another question:
How can I change the green foreground color in the help windows?
You have to edit the line "ReadOnlyColor=" in the file $HOME/.thotrc:
ReadOnlyColor=Black
if you want to display them in black.
Regards
Irene.

Hmm... I didn't have the idea to use print standalone. What is it good
for, and what exactly does it do?
Yes, thanks! Especially I would like to have de-printdialogue.

It's useful for Thot application users. They can print documents without
launching
of the Thot editor.
You can download *-printdialogue from
ftp://opera.inrialpes.fr/pub/sources/amaya
At the moment, de-printdialogue is a copy of en-printdialogue. If you can
translate
it we'll be very happy to integrate your new version.
Irene.
