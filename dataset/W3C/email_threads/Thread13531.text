I'm crossposting this to w3-wai-ig, because it seems to go beyond the
scope of ER alone.
As members of WAI/ER will know, I am developing a new Site Valet tool
that combines WCAG-based accessibility reporting with validation.
The WCAG reporting is based on Rick Joliffe's Schematron, and takes
as its starting point the published WAI schema example.
On test-driving the new tool (which is currently available online
but is very much under-construction and could generate inconsistent
results - caveat visitor), I am - perhaps unsurprisingly -
confronted with a few gotchas, that appear to highlight
inconsistencies in the WCAG itself. I'll deal with the first
of these in detail now; perhaps we can establish some guidelines
for how a tool such as mine should handle borderline cases.
(1) Point the tool to almost any page containing a Form:
e.g. to Site Valet itself at URL:http://valet.webthing.com/
When confronted with Form elements, it complains
"WCAG Checkpoint 1.1
An input element should have some descriptive text:an alt or
longdesc attribute"
This is correct according to the document linked at that point:
As regards whether this is sensible, it seems to me to be at best
marginal. Form Inputs as rendered in graphical browsers do not
carry cues that are denied to other readers, so a page author who
fails to provide adequate information is failing their mainstream
users just as much as accessibility-challenged users, and should
presumably be aware of the fact. Exceptions to this observation
would appear to me to be pathologically-constructed cases.
On following the "Techniques for checkpoint 1.1" link to
I find that Form Inputs are here excluded from the list of elements
that should have text equivalents.
Neither is it required by
which is rather confusingly linked from the previous document as
"Checkpoint 1.1", while in fact being identical to it.
I have discussed my own view regarding a particular checkpoint.
But the purpose of this tool is to implement the WCAG, not my views.
That leaves open the question of how to deal with cases where the
WCAG itself appears inconsistent, other than to exercise my own
judgement.
You can test-drive the prototype tool at
(bearing in mind that it is under active development, and may
change at any time).
Any thoughts? Comments? Suggestions?

This should apply only to graphical input elements such as:
It doesn't apply to "ordinary" types of input elements.
Techniques documents are non-normative and shouldn't be trusted (for
whatever reason; I didn't create the "non-normative" vs "normative"
distinction and frankly I don't care for it).
Then again, WCAG 1.0 is a bit dubious in the "trust" category and
that's one of the reasons that WCAG 2.0 is under development.
WCAG 1.0 by its very nature requires judgment calls, and that means
authoring tool developers (such as you) who are trying to create
tools to support WCAG 1.0 will also have to make judgment calls.
Luckily, in this case, the judgment call is pretty simple: the
checkpoint only refers to non-text input forms which can't be
rendered in non-graphical browsers.

That is indeed my inclination. However, in this instance I was working
from a starting point of someone else's judgement, which clearly
differed from mine (and yours), as well as from the letter (if not
the spirit) of the normative document. And one of Site Valet's
"selling points" is conformance to published standards, as opposed
to what some developer (you, me, anyone..) thought was a good idea.
Ho Hum ...

It is best to get the WCAG group themselves to resolve this as an issue (it
should take them very little time) but as I understand it being a member of
the group, the lists are not exhaustive. If there is a checkpoint you should
interpret the text of the checkpoint, and regard the lists and other examples
as merely guiding examples rather than definitive sets of requirements.

Well, if they are graphic buttons, as pointed out by Kynn, this is important.
