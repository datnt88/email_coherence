Only after loading by using the javascript bookmarklet:
javascript:els=document.getElementsByTagName('marquee');for
(i=0;i els.length;i++)
alert(els[i].outerHTML=els[i].outerHTML.replace('MARQUEE','span'));void 0
Yes.
Only with javascript bookmarklet: (Likely works in Mozilla etc.)
javascript:els=document.getElementsByTagName('marquee');for
(i=0;i els.length;i++)
alert(els[i].scrollDelay=els[i].scrollDelay*3);void 0
(slows it down by a factor of 3 on each activation.)

Ooops, I left the alert in there, that should be removed (this one I
wrote specially, as I've never felt the need to do this!)
At the request of Chaals, I'm documenting the general bookmarklets I use
at http://jibbering.com/accessibility/bookmarklets.html
