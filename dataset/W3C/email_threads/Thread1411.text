Hi,
In section 1.6.1 we have an example of a CHECKOUT method which fails with a
DAV:must-not-be-checked-out
and returning a 409 Conflict.
I cannot actually see in the spec where the Precondition
DAV:must-not-be-checked-out for the CHECKOUT
method is defined?
CHECKOUT has a DAV:must-be-checked-in Precondition NOT a
DAV:must-not-be-checked-out
Precondition. So is the example wrong or should the condition for CHECKOUT
be changed.
I also note that DAV:must-not-be-checked-out is used as a precondition for
the LABEL method.
Perhaps they should be consistent and both use DAV:must-not-be-checked-out?

Looks like they all should be DAV:must-be-checked-in (to avoid the
negative).

Ok, so its a hypothetical example of a pre/postcondition failure g
The example is wrong and should be updated.
I agree with Jim that DAV:must-be-checked-in is better.
