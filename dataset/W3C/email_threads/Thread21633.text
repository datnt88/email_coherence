Hi Patrick,
I reply to some of your earlier questions below.
I attach a snapshot of where I am at with the Model Theory, along with some
comments on your text. The text I have produced so far is not either the
simpler or the more advanced text that I am planning to produce and hence is
not ready for insertion into the document yet. It's somewhere in between.
Once I have finished it at this level I will both simplify and embellish it
to produce the main text and the appendix text, respectively.

The version of the RDF Model Theory I am working from is this one:

Does it help to split the interpretation process onto two
"levels" or "phases" where first one interprets the idiom
to obtain the TDL pairing and then, once the pairing is
known, interpret the pairing to get the mapping.
Unfortunately not, see on.
The latter phase seems (in my admitted ignorance) to be
rather simple, since there is a one to one correspondence
between a pairing and a mapping. And since the TDL pairing
includes the type and lexical form, they are both present
for the interpretation of that phase.
In practice we have to address the question of what happens when there are
two types specified. This motivates a significant part of the complexity. S
is significantly simpler in this respect, but buggy. (i.e. on the "as simple
as possible but no simpler" axis, S-B, IMO goes too far).
As for the former phase, the interpretation of the idiom,
does this really need to be grounded in the MT?
Yes, because the global type information can only be accessed through the
MT. e.g. a range constraint may be through any number of subProperty
relationships etc.
Also, for idiom S/B, the mapping is not explicit, but is
as implicit as the TDL pairing, as all that is identified
in the graph is the lexical space of the datatype (with the
datatype itself implied by the relation of lexical space
to datatype) and the lexical form. How is TDL different?
(asking this humbly so that I understand it myself)
The node that represents the actual member of the value space
is always constant, being the object node of the statement,
which is either labeled with the literal or an anonymous
node with rdf:value property defining the literal.
I think we bite the bullet and make noises about tails and dogs).
Right.
I am currently planning to get writing on Wednesday. I might
have some time
tomorrow.
Fair enough. I plan to work on the final verbage today and tomorrow,
adding in the discussion of the desiderada and some clarifications
suggested by recent comments.
I think I'll put together a separate summary of what I see as the
shortcomings of S, not including it in the TDL proposal itself.
Patrick
Thanks. I'll make the edits you suggest (and BTW, I'm using
good old vi ;-)
Other questions/comments may follow in later emails...

Here's where I am now, but I am out of time for today - will continue
tomorrow.
I've finished the first cut, and duplicated it and started pruning the first
copy.

Jeremy,
Here's the latest integrated draft, with the editorial
changes you suggested. I'll finish up the desiderada
discussion first thing tomorrow morning.
Do we want to reference sections 1-3 of Sergey's document
at all, if Peter's SWOL specification gives us that machinery?
(or does it?)
Patrick
Hi
I've not yet looked at your integration, will do tomorrow.
Latest version of MT, basically complete but I need to do a review.
I think I should move the explanation of idiom P and idiom D from the terse
appendix to the slightly friendlier format of the main text.
The Union appendix needs total rewrite.
Jeremy
Emails that pass in the night.... ;-)
I'll plug your latest stuff in before shutting down.
Patrick
Yes keep Sergey's ref. as well as Peter's.
Peter's document is quite terse. The real debt (for me at least) is to a
conversation I had with him at webont f2f (which I guess we don't
reference).
Jeremy
OK.
Patrick
