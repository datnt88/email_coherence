Hi!
First of all, congratulations to your 0.8c release of Amaya. At first
sight, everything looks *really* nice! There are two points I want to
turn your attention to:
1. I'm desparately seeking a browser that correctly displays transparent,
1-bit grayscale PNGs. I have black&amp;white PNGs and want to have the
white color transparent (I create them with
pnmtopng -transparent #ffffff img.pbm  img.png)
The result when viewed with Amaya as inlined IMGs is as follows: If I
omit the -transparent flag, the image gets displayed o.k., i.e. *black*
characters on *white* background.
If I say -transparent #ffffff, then *grey* characters appear on
*white* background (rectangular box).
If I say -transparent #000000, then *light grey* characters appear on
*white* background.
I'd be **most** grateful if you could give me some pointers about what
is wrong here. BTW, I'm running a Linux box with libpng-0.89c,
zlib-1.0.4 and pnmtopng-2.31. Thank you for looking into this.
2. (only a minor thing) Doesn't Amaya have a `Reload' Button?
Kind regards
Marek

Hi,
Could you give us the URL of your document.
This function will be available in next release.

Hello Irene,
Certainly: http://saftsack.fs.uni-bayreuth.de/~marek/ttt/ttt.html
This contains a simple testpage with two inlined PNGs, both of them
transparent, 1-bit grayscale. For comparison there's a ttt2.html in
the same directory, too, that is using GIFs instead of PNGs.
Thank you for taking your time looking at this problem.
Best regards
Marek

Well, there is a bug somewhere.
Did you try to change the background color of the whole document body?
When doing that, the background of your images stay white and the
foreground takes the same color as the document background.
Are you sure that the *background* of your PNGs is transparent? It seems
that it is the *forground* that is transparent.

Vincent, (and others)
thanks for having a look at this, I really appreciate your help. I thought
of this point, too. My images are generated by pnmtopng from a
black&amp;white pbm (Portable Bit Map, only two colors). I tried both
pnmtopng -transparent #ffffff img1.pnm  img1.png
(this is supposed to have the effect I want - black characters on the
browser's background) and
pnmtopng -transparent #000000 img1.pnm  img1.png
The behaviour was *almost* the same: The *white* image background is
visible in both cases, but the color of the characters is *grey* in the
first case and *light grey* in the second. I've prepared another test
page, here are the URLs:
- This is the document with PNGs with -transparent #ffffff. This should be
the one that works in the end, given that everything is ok with
libpng-0.89c, libz-1.0.4 and pnmtopng-2.31
- This is the version using transparent GIFs instead of PNGs - works ok
with netscape and other browsers.
- This is the same as the first URL, but with -transparent #000000 to show
the effect mentioned above.
You can also retrieve the original PNMs from
(actually these two are PBMs, i.e. 1-bit image data)
Thank you again for your cooperation, I'll be happy to contribute to the
development of the *first* linux browser with proper PNG support!
Best regards
Marek
PS. I haven't tried multicolor, transparent PNGs yet. Hopefully I'll find
some time to do that, perhaps it will bring us closer to the root of this
problem.
