Justin  error in the JAXP 1.1.ea2 method definition for NamedNodeMap.
setNamedItemNS
yes!
org.w3c.dom
Interface NamedNodeMap should be:
setNamedItemNS(namespaceURI, localName)
Don Joe might want to look at it too.
Yes. please look at:
// Introduced in DOM Level 2:
Node setNamedItemNS(in Node arg)
raises(DOMException);
should be:
Node setNamedItemNS(in DOMString namespaceURI,
in DOMString localName);
raises(DOMException);
base\jaxp-1_1-ea2\jaxp-1.1ea2\docs\api\org\w3c\dom\NamedNodeMap.html
follows that bad lead.
You just will not be able to setNamedItemNS with Node arg.
The DOM specification is clear [1]. The definition of setNamedItemNS is
Node setNamedItemNS(in Node arg)
raises(DOMException);
This is not a mistake. This is consistent with DOM Level 1.
What does your set operation do? What is the value of attribute?

Hi Philippe ,
OK I get it, you send an object and get back an object.
All I need to do is read.
Thank You and Best Regards,

It looks like someone is confusing this setter method
Node setNamedItemNS(in Node arg)
raises(DOMException);
with its corresponding getter:
Node getNamedItemNS(in DOMString namespaceURI, in DOMString
localName);
Note that the arguments are different. In the setter, we're inserting a
particular Node, and using that node's name -- which is a two-part value
made up of its localname and its namespaceURI, as stored in the node
itself. In the getter, we're specifying that two-part name and expect the
matching node (if any) to be returned.
Yes, I see my confusion now.
We send a complete object and we may get one back.
Thank You,
Joe
