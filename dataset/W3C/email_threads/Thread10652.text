The first question from
is basically, does anyone use bagID?
I know the CARMEN project / MathNet uses bagID with RDF/XML and
Dublin Core. See the PDF report from Feb 2002
(in German) for rdf:bagID in the examples and more at
Searching for "rdf:bagID" on google I find more uses in various
projects, it isn't clear how extensive.
Tim provides no new information why this syntax should be removed.
On the second part:
The WG was chartered to clarify M&amp;S. It wasn't chartered to remove
bits of the syntax (though it has done so in other instance where
clarification was difficult).
-- quoting Brian from

I think this document enhances Tim's case.
The only occurrence of bagID in the doc is to create a bag that has a
matching aboutEach - which we axed.
Moreover, judging from the surrounding RDF/XML the document author appears
to want every triple generated within the XML element to be reified into
the bag, rather than only the toplevel triples (as we clarified).
i.e. this document shows a use of a construct that is not bagID which is
useful with a construct which is not RDF.
bagID was an ugly sibling to aboutEach and should have been chopped at the
same time.

It isn't the only one, it is just one I knew of, there were hundreds
(I didn't bother to count) more references on google.
and I agreed with you - at the time.
I also put off implementing rdf:bagID in my parser, expecting we
would kill it. But we didn't.
This point is, the WG made the decision so what new information is
there to remove it? That we removed aboutEach? No, that was before.
If we were to remove it, we would owe people a good reason and would
have to make sure it really wasn't used or useful.
If we were having another last call syntax WD, it would mean new LC
WD test cases, LC WD primer to follow the changes, probably not the
others in this case.
