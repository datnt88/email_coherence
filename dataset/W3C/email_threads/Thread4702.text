1.6.4.2 and 1.6.4.5 have the same comma issue.
Also, in 1.6.4.1
expected
title Foobar Corporation releases its new line of Foo
products today /title
but original content is
title Foobar Corporation releases its new line of Foo products
today /title
In 1.6.4.5 there is a period at the end of the first two {...} lines
that shouldn't be there:
{ $item/title/text() }.
{ $item/date/text() }.
{ string(($item//par)[1]) }
I am working on the Use Cases next week, and I *really* appreciate all the
use case bug reports from Sarah, Xavier, Dimitre, and Alberto.
I will respond to these emails individually as I edit the document next
week. I apologize that I haven't been more responsive up to now.

Not an issue...
Whitespace is not faithfully reproduced in the use cases - see the
following note:
To make output more readable, the output of queries has been
formatted using whitespace which may not be returned by a query
processor. This whitespace should not be considered normative for
the correctness of results.
Thanks, I fixed those.
