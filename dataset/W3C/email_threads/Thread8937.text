There have been some questions on what the X509IssuerSerial, X509SKI,
and X509SubjectName can refer to, how many of them there can be, etc.
Unless there is some objection, we will go with addition of the
following, or something close to it, to the spec:
All X509IssuerSerial, X509SKI, and X509SubjectName elements must refer
to certficiates with the validation key. However, because you can
have multiple cetificates for the same key in the same X509Data
element, there may be multiple such elements referring to different
certificates or, of course, the same element.
Thanks,
Donald

I assume you mean "certificate" for that last word.
Also, what about something like "No ordering is implied."

Yes.
Sounds reasonable.
Thanks,

I'm trying to integrate this paragraph:
with this paragraph:
Multiple declarations about a single certificate (e.g., a X509SubjectName
and X509IssuerSerial element) MUST be grouped inside a single X509Data
element; multiple declarations about the same key but different X509
certificates (related to that single key) MUST be grouped within a single
KeyInfo element but MAY occur in multiple X509Data elements.
in a way that is comprehensible, but it's not working too well. Someone else
want to suggest some text?

How about
Any X509IssuerSerial, X509SKI, and X509SubjectName elements that
appear MUST refer to the certficiate or certificates containing
the validation key. All such elements that refer to a
particular individual certificate MUST be grouped inside a
single X509Data element and if the certificate to which they
refer appears, it MUST also be in that X509Data element.
Any X509IssuerSerial, X509SKI, and X509SubjectName elements that
relate to the same key but different certificates MUST be
grouped within a single KeyInfo but MAY occur in multiple
X509Data elements.
All certificates appearing in an X509Data element MUST relate to
the validation key by either containing it or being part of a
certification chain that termiantes in a certificate containing
the validation key.
No ordering is implied by the above constraints.

Multiple declarations about a single certificate (e.g., a X509SubjectName
and X509IssuerSerial element) MUST be grouped inside a single X509Data
element; multiple declarations about the same key but different X509
certificates (related to that single key) MUST be grouped within a single
KeyInfo element but MAY occur in multiple X509Data elements.
This wording is better than what I was coming up with. But on a
related subject, why isn't the rule about elements for different but
related certificates that they SHOULD occur within different X509Data
elements of the same KeyInfo element? I realize that it is too late to
impose a MUST rule on this.

All X509IssuerSerial, X509SKI, and X509SubjectName elements must refer to
certficiates containing the validation key. However, since multiple
cetificates for the same key are permitted in the same X509Data element,
there may be multiple such elements referring to different certificates
or,
Multiple declarations about a single certificate (e.g., a X509SubjectName
and X509IssuerSerial element) MUST be grouped inside a single X509Data
