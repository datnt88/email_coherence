I'll be unnable to join the telecon this Friday due
to a family function that evening.

Thank you for letting us know Patrick.
There is a chance we will have some important decisions to take this
week, e.g. whether the next step is PR. It would be helpful if you
could let us have your views by email. I expect there to be some
traffic on this, summarizing the decision, later in the week.
Brian
I'll do my best to provide my input via email before Friday.
Shouldn't be a problem.
Patrick
