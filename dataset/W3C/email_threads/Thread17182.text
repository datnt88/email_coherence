Hi Everyone,
To meet WAI guidelines, do I have to have a label for text fields if I
have the TITLE set for the text field? This may seem like a silly
question, but I'm running into a problem with Netscape 6.1. When I
align the label to the right inside a table cell, the label text
visually disappears. This must be a glitch with Netscape 6.1. If I
don't want the text of the label to disappear, I cannot have it in a
label , if I want the text to be aligned to the right. If I align the
label to the left, while the label is visible, it looks bad with
formatting I'm using for a search box. If you would like to see the
page, please e-mail me off list. The site isn't public yet, and still
very much under development, so hard hats are defiantly needed.
Therefore, I would rather not publicly broadcast the link, Thanks for
your help!
Warmly,
Hy
The Gecko family of browsers does not, AFAIK, support the label element.

It does (for the most part, before I make too broad a statement) on current
Mozilla releases, but that's hasn't filtered down to Netscape 7.x.

I've had similar problems, that turned out of course to be bugs in a
particular level of Netscape, Mozilla, etc. The combination of styling via
the DIV element, the TABLE element, and the LABEL element were the
symptoms of the bug. Can you try removing/replacing the DIV element and/or
the TABLE and see if the problem goes away?
Also view the code in Opera, IE and other levels of Netscape to see if it
is just a Netscape version 6.1 problem.

Support goes back at least to Moz 0.9x (not sure what x), so if there's
a problem on NS7, that's probably unconnected.

How to visual users know what the field is? The label element needs to
wrap the field that identifies the field to visual users. Nothing
should depend on title attributes as the primary means of identification.
