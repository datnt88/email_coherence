At the risk of this proposal being "out of scope" I would propose that we
encourage (or perform) development of a simple tool that inserts into an
XHTML file an assertion that the author (whose email is xxx@yyy) claims a
particular level of conformance to WCAG 1.0 and that the document has been
tidied, validated, and personally checked with available tools to enable
this assertion on our beloved "Web of Trust".
Although, in theory, the mere placement of a certain logo on the page might
enable one to locate files bearing such claims, the use of RDF for this
purpose makes possible a much finer potential availability of this
assertion as well as freeing one from the obligation to have the site bear
a certain "appearance" - as well as the problem with "image text" in the
currently recommended logo.
Love.
ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE
This tool mostly exists, if you are happy to use the W3C annotation service
(except that the server for the annotations is temproary so it will lose the
annotations). Alternatively, what is required could probably be implemented
in a piece of javascript for a tool like dreamweaver or golive.
As an authoring tool amaya allows you to put annotations where you like (for
example with the document on your own server, so it is only a case of having
an annotation that specifically includes the bit of RDF you are looking for -
that is next on the development agenda.

it is only a case of having an annotation that specifically includes the
bit of RDF you are looking for - that is next on the development agenda.
Since it is on the agenda then we might want to recommend that WCAG 2.0
provide a spot for it in the guidelines?
Specifically that there be a "placeholder" sort of thing that deals with
making a conformance assertion in order to be conformant?
Love.
ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE
I propose we copy the conformance section from WCAG 1.0 as a start on this.
(Note that this is an endorsement of that system, against the strawman put up
that had a simple yes/no scheme).

Ages ago I proposed something like this to WAI IG, based on what Mr.
Loughborough had been talking about on RDF IG (whilst I was developing
swi-dev type stuff). I wasn't a WAI member at the time, and it went
completely unnoticed...now it is being raised again, I've dug up the URI:
The guideline suggestions I made back then still appear to stand, but they
would have to be less technologically oriented for WCAG 2.0
For those that don't know, Charles is talking about this section:-
Claims of conformance to this document must use one of the following two
forms.
Form 1:
The guidelines title: "Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0"
The guidelines URI: http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WAI-WEBCONTENT-19990505
The conformance level satisfied: "A", "Double-A", or "Triple-A".
The scope covered by the claim (e.g., page, site, or defined portion of a
site.).
]]] - http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10/#conformance
All we need are as many different ways as possible for expressing that (a
techniques thing), i.e. in HTML and RDF. Notice that I already gave two
examples in the note that I wrote, and that we have online examples of RDF.
Also, when ADL is created, we could use that: in *whatever* form it takes
on.
Kindest Regards,

In fact there was a metadata scheme using PICS that was written to do this in
early 1999, and a scheme to produce RDF from PICS is described in teh W3C
