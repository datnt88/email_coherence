Section 1.2 shows:
credentials = auth-scheme #auth-param
Shouldn't that more correctly be
credentials = auth-scheme 1#auth-param
It's hard for me to imagine an auth-scheme that can work correctly
and usefully with zero auth-param's in the credentials.

Always allow unless you have a good reason to deny.

It is for an auth-scheme that sends its parameters in separate
header field(s) rather than as auth-param's.
