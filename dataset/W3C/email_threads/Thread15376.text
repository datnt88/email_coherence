Acronym and Abbreviation:
ACRONYM: p title="Keep It Simple Stupid" KISS /p
This example is referenced as an acronym, but uses the p tag which is
incorrect. The correct tag would be acronym .
yes... also KISS is an "ambiguos" word... it has a value also as kiss (to
kiss someone)
Why don't use:
Also *all* examples must be passed in XHTML, as write in a message sent to
the list from Richard Ishida:
HTML Technique Notes
TITLE element:
Current - The TITLE element describes the document.
Suggested - The TITLE element _identifies_ the document.
ADDRESS element:
Classified as Meta Data in the Techniques document. However, the
reference used for describing ADDRESS is 7.5.6. Section 7.5 is the Body
Section of the HTML 4.01 Specifications. Please explain how ADDRESS is
now classified as part of the HEAD instead of the BODY.
Acronym and Abbreviation:
ACRONYM: p title="Keep It Simple Stupid" KISS /p
This example is referenced as an acronym, but uses the p tag which is
incorrect. The correct tag would be acronym .
