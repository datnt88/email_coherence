Howdy,
Patrik Falstrom has let me and Lisa know that he
cannot dedicate the time to WebDav that he had originally
intended. After some discussion with Lisa and Patrik, I have
asked Joe Hildebrand to take up the role of co-chair in Patrik's stead.
Please welcome Joe to the post; I'm sure he'll
be introducing himself both on the list and in the upcoming
meeting.
regards,
Ted Hardie
co-Chair, Applications Area
Welcome Joe!
Speaking of meeting, we need to schedule the upcoming meeting pretty
soon. I think there's a lot of difficult issues, and in-person
discussions could really help in resolving difficult issues, so if you
attend one WebDAV meeting a year, make this the one. Are there any
other WG conflicts to avoid in scheduling? Submissions for the agenda?
Lisa
Thanks for the intro, Ted.
For those that don't know me, I hope to meet you in person at the San Diego
meeting, or online if you can't make it.
Since I haven't been involved from the beginning, there are liable to be
times when I don't have all of the historical context of decisions that have
been made. I hope you all bear with me when I ask questions that may have
obvious answers to you...
Joe Hildebrand
