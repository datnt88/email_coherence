Up till now we have been using an issue driven process and that has served
us well, but now that we are down to one open issue, we must change. Our
goal now is drive forward to last call. We have been out of time for a
while now. We have to get done. To do that we need to adopt a more
document focused process aimed at getting each document to last call status.
I suggest therefore, that each telecon, as well as dealing with any issues
arising, choses one or more documents to focus on for that telecon. I will
be calling on the editors to propose dates when they expect to have their
last call candidates ready for review. I will be calling on WG members for
detailed reviews of the documents to assist the editors in getting them
done and out the door.

Which one is that?
I see a number of issues "for discussion"; in particular,

Datatypes. Issue list needs updating. I'm behind. Sorry.
Brian
Quite allright; but it's news to me that rdfms-assertion
is resolved. I looked pretty hard for a record of
a decision to resolve it, and I couldn't find one.
Brian's clearly got plenty to do; can anybody *else*
help me find a record of a decision to close
rdfms-assertion?
There's not a lot of urgency, but if somebody
has it handy...

Good.
I should have an updated model document done next week, hopefully by
Wednesday -- I think the only requested changes so far are deletions, so it
should be easy. And there's the abstract and introduction to draft.
BTW, do we have a proposed new title for it?
E.g.
Resource Description Framework: Overview and Graph Syntax

From http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20020617-f2f/
I think it's covered by this decision:
log The WG decided to consider producing a new document to describe the RDF
graph, possibly called "Resource Description Framework". This will include
description of the graph synax, what it means to assert, character
normalization and possibly some other material from the primer. Graham and
Jeremy to be editors.
in the sense that it's become a document issue.
There was some discussion at the f2f of the assertion issue against a
background of social aspects of RDF deployment (in discussions in/after the
telecon prior to the F2F, the omission of any discussion of the social
environment of RDF deployment had been noted). Section 2.3 of the new RDF
document [1] resulted from this. Assertion is covered at sub-section 2.3.4
[2] (and still needs review/discussion).

Excellent!
Hmm, I think I suggested something last week, what was it. "Resource
Description Framework: Abstract Data Model".
Brian
OK, I'll use that if nothing better has surfaced. But there is also the
material about social context and assertions that doesn't really fit that
title.
How about "Overview and Abstract Data Model"? (I'm not wedded to
"Overview", but can't think of anything else which fits the other material
and doesn't seem too obscure.)
