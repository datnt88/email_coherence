In accordance with the checkpoint to use W3C technologies when available
(and with the W3C current recommendation to use XHTML), I've changed over
all of my sites to XHTML.
Got a URL handy?
Has anyone else on this list encountered this problem? Is it true that
Mac/IE will not handle XHTML pages properly (I really hope not).
I've used XHTML pages just fine on IE 5 on my iBook.
Or could it
be some sort of mime-type problem on his computer? Doesn't XHTML go out as
text/html?
Depends on what your server is configured to do. XHTML goes out as
text/html if it's named .html, for example.

In accordance with the checkpoint to use W3C technologies when available
(and with the W3C current recommendation to use XHTML), I've changed over
all of my sites to XHTML. Today I got a call from a friend with some bad
news. He just bought a Macintosh and went to one of my sites with Internet
Explorer and instead of a page he got the source code.
It seems that IE on the Mac (for him, anyway) will reproduce HTML just fine,
but when confronted with XHTML will dump the code into the browser window as
if it were plain text. He thinks that the problem is because he just signed
up for @Home and the tech screwed something up, but I am suspicious.

Thanks for any help...

If served as text/xml this may be the case, or if served as text/html with
customized Modules, this might be the case (but it would rather probably
ignore the unknown elements all together).

These pages are generated dynamically using Cold Fusion. The extension is
.cfm. I presume that the server is sending them out as text/html (I have no
idea why it would do otherwise). If you or someone else can look at this
site in Mac with IE and let me know if you see the generated source code or
the page, I'd know whether it was a general Mac IE problem (let's hope not)
or a problem with my friend's set-up.
Is there an easy way to check the headers of pages? They don't appear when
you View  Source. Properties, maybe?

I get the source, unfortunately, using IE 4.5 on a Mac. Looks good on Netscape on Mac/Win/Linux and on IE on Win, also on Lynx and WebTV. The server is sending it out as text/html.
My IE 5 renders it just fine. Could the fact that it's not valid
XHTML/XML be causing problems in IE 4.5?

Results of a cursory site check for http://ucitd.com in Internet Explorer
for Macintosh:
5.0 site renders well
4.5 gaps in table
4.01 gaps in table
3.01 gaps in table, table cell background does not appear, does display
?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"? at top of page.
Your friend's trouble would appear to be due to a browser misconfiguration.

Reply:
I've made the necessary correction to make the page valid (it's always
something, isn't it?). If you could recheck to see if this page:
is working or not on Mac IE 4.5, I'd appreciate it. It is valid XHTML now.

No problem (save table gap) on Mac IE 4.5

[DJW:] This page is invalid because it claims to
be simultaneously in UTF-8 and ISO 8859/1. I'd
only consider the latter as accessible, especially
as there is not charset in the HTTP headers, so
pre HTML 4.0 browser will default to 8859/1.
