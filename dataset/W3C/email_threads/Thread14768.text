Thanks for forwarding this-- the episode Paul Bonner recounts here took
place in my office a few months ago. Jonathan, I'm sorry there was no
reference to learning disabilities here. Maybe we could write to Bonner and
ask him to take a look at LD issues for another column?

And Web Sites for All
By: Paul Bonner
The complexity of accessible Web design hit home for me one afternoon when I
was sitting in the office of a blind professor at the University of Texas at
Austin, watching as he navigated his screen-reader - equipped browser to the
most popular commerce site on the Web. "Amazon.com," announced the pleasant
voice, "189 links on page." At which point the voice began a torturously
slow recital, reading the "alt" text description of each of those 189 links.
Read the entire article at:
It would be great if you could. Some form of learning disability effects
a very large percentage of the population.
Yet there is an underlying assumption that they are capable.
This means they are frequently ignored.
