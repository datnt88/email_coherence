At the versioning design team meeting last week, Jim asked
if we wanted to express the revision history (version graph)
in RDF; it's a natural format for it, but there was concern
that we might be tying ourselves to a doomed non-standard--a
few people expressed the opinion that RDF seemed to be dying
on the vine, ignored by the W3C and abandoned by Netscape.
We agreed to come up with a more specific format; I don't
want to reopen that discussion, but I just wanted to let
everybody know that I talked to Ramanathan Guha (Mr. RDF),
and he says it's going to Last Call in a couple of weeks.
(Mind you, I don't know enough about the W3C to know whether
that's a comparable state to the IETF's Last Call.)

John,
I am not sure if RDF is dying. If it is, then DCD (Document Content
Description) submitted by Microsoft and IBM will also be dead because it is
based on RDF. DCD is supposed to be the replacement for DTDs, but in XML/RDF
syntax.
Those who who may have expressed the view that W3C could be
abandoning RDF are sorely mistaken. The RDF Model and Syntax
Working Group continues to refine its specification based on
comments on the most recent public working draft (dated
19 August). See http://www.w3.org/TR/
We hope to declare a 'Last Call' review for the RDF Model and
Syntax specification in a single-digit number of days and for
the RDF Schema specification shortly thereafter.

I volunteered to come up with a DTD for the history property. I will look at
RDF, and if it seems like a convenient way to express what we want, we should
consider using it, even if we don't advertise it as being RDF compliant. In
other words, there's no reason to invent something new for its own sake. On the
other hand, it is not clear that RDF adds a lot either. Sometimes using a
generic mechanism for meta-data obscures the instance you're trying to capture
and just adds complexity. This isn't the spirit of XML where one is supposed to
be able to define document types that closely correspond to the application
being modeled.

Subject: RDF for versioning

Several people have asked me about this. For the record: I am *not*
saying that I thought we were ignoring it; this is what some people at
the meeting thought, and I didn't know enough to contradict them
offhand. I think people got that impression because Netscape issued a
press release when we first submitted RDF, and hasn't issued much since
then--the work is going on quietly.
