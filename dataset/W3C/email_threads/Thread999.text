Hi all,
First contribution/question.....
When I run tidy on some HTML pages which contain non ascii characters
(science equations, basically), they are transformed to a string of
strange characters (a sequence of non ascii and ascii characters). As
this is only one step into a, in theory, automatic process, we cannot
afford re-changing it by hand.
Does any of you happened to know whether it is possible to "tell" tidy
not to transform this kind of characters.
It is really driving me crazy....
Thanks in advance
Fernando
Hi Fernando,
Did you try -latin1 to specify you have extended chars? If the characters
are Latin1 (ISO-8859-1) symbols, then Tidy should read the raw characters
and emit nice HTML entities (either numeric or symbolic).
If your symbol characters are in some other encoding (Windows-1252? Mac
Roman?), you may still be able to get Tidy to recognize them.
See http://tidy.sf.net/docs/quickref.html#char-encoding
If that doesn't work, send us a small sample.
take it easy,
Charlie
We need to have a look at you exact input and configuration options
alongside with information about the version of HTML Tidy you are
running on which platform.
