Hello,
I have been receiving messages from different addresses, all of them
apparently from the same person, some of them with infected attachments:
ezequielmartingurevich - exxel-group argentina gaius julius ceasar
ezequielmartingurevich ezequielmartingurevich7177@yahoo.com
ezequiel martin gurevich ibm_russia@yahoo.com.ar
Is someone else in the group receiving the same files? If so, is the W3
Consortium aware of this problem?
Thanks so much for any reply and best regards,
Cristina

I have been receiving those mails too but, alas! not bound to a specific mailing
list or indeed any W3C address. In other words, there is very little we can do
about it at W3C... I will, nevertheless, forward this to our system management.

This is a common present day phenomena! Malicious attachments/emails are
targeted towards email lists, W3C is no exception.
I suggest that you get a good antisapm software which will allow you to
direct emails sent by one particular sender/group to a separate folder where
they can be safely deleted.
Also Enable Worm Blocking (Norton); Enables Worm Blocking to scan all
outgoing email messages and alert you if a malicious worm is detected.
Norton antivirus software allows you to see the details of a sender of a
malicious email/attachment, use this to create a message rule in Outlook so
as messages from the same sender are deleted from the server. Keep your Live
Update up to date and PRAY!

Perhaps, indirectly, reporting Spam via spamcop will alert their Internet
Providers and therefore account termination: http://www.spamcop.net/
A shot in the dark!

Thank you so much to everybody!
I do have a good antivirus, update it daily, say all the prayers, etc. And
still cross fingers! :-(
These messages from "ezequiel martin gurevich", whoever he is, are always
sent to the list, among others. What really caught my attention is the fact
that the sender's name is always the same, although the email addresses are
always different.
I just wanted to share a concern with all of you.
Thanks again and best regards to all,
cristina
