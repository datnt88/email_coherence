'help advanced' under option 'xmylang=de' returns
the english help files. As the english texts are surely
the master texts, maybe this is by intention?
But anyway I'm sorry, that I'm still missing the idea behind the 'advanced'
help feature, e.g. 'help advanced cookies' raises an error.
Are these traces of something projected?

Okay, I will work on the help advanced.
Really, I forget what the help advanced cookies is supposed to do.
Minimaly it checks for the existence of a certain file and reports an
error, if it fails.
Thanks
I shall test further.

I forgot to mention, that imho 'help advanced' is of course very useful
as it is now, cause it sends all the help files on just one request.
