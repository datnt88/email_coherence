Updated examples for section 5.4.1
Replacement text for first cyan block[1]
Replacement text for third cyan block[2]
Replacement text for fourth cyan block[3]
Replacement text for fifth cyan block[4]
Replacement text for sixth cyan block[5]
Replacement text for seventh cyan block[6]
Added ns decl for prefixes e and xsi. removed prefixes n and m ( remapped to
e ). Schema example[6] rewritten. I'm waiting for some input on the schema
itself from a couple of people on the schema group. I'll post again after I
get that feedback. I'm confident that the schema is correct but there may be
a more concise form.
Viewing[2] and [4] in IE 5.5 doesn't work. Use View Source to see the real
thing...

Done!
However:
* Got a problem with tabulations and spaces (ex7; not fixed in this version).
* firstauthor - firstAuthor
* You have not update the second cyan block?
Jean-Jacques.
What is the tabbing/space problem? It looks fine to me in emacs...
firstauthor is not capitalized in the schema or any of the examples as far
as I can tell
Second cyan block was updated earlier in mail titled 'Re: Examples in our
spec' sent by me on 16th May at 21:57 ( sorry, forgot to copy the archive on
that thread... )

Tabbing: I was using FrontPage, and in edit mode the indentations were not quite
right. I have checked whether the browser actually displays them correctly.
firstauthor: I had update the corresponding schema.
Second cyan block: I have sorted my email according to title; so I did not see
this one.
Marc, would you please be able to update that one for me? I really need to be

OK, no worries, we can clear up any loose ends next week.
