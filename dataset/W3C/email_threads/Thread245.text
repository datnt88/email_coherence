There appears to be a problem with tidy in that it discards any text after
an OPTION tag. Also, it doesn't allow you to include an /OPTION tag.
Here is an example HTML file: (See attached file: testoption.htm)which gave
the errors: (See attached file: File.txt)Thanks for considering this:

p.s. the problem was introduced recently when I added the
InsertMisc call into ParseText(). The fix is to insert
the following code snippet after the call to InsertMisc:
/* deal with comments etc. */
if (InsertMisc(field, node))
continue;
/* insert text value into option element */
if (node- type == TextNode)
/* only called for 1st child */
if (field- content == null &amp;&amp; !(mode &amp; Preformatted))
TrimTrailingSpace(lexer, field- last);
if (node- start  = node- end)
FreeNode(node);
continue;
InsertNode(field, node);
continue;
if (node- tag == tag_font)
ReportWarning(lexer, field, node,
DISCARDING_UNEXPECTED);
FreeNode(node);
continue;
