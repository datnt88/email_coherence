Hello. I would like to parse the results of a tidy operation into a DOM.
I'm not sure if this is possible, and it apparently is not with MSXML, as it
raises numerous errors on any HTML document I tidy and then try to parse.
Is my premise wrong - parsing HTML into an XML DOM can't be done, or am I
using the wrong parser? Any help would be greatly appreciated.
The simplest thing is to use Tidy to clean up the markup and
convert it into well formed XML, and follow this up with an
off-the-shelf XML tool, e.g. the IBM java tool kit for XML.
You could alternatively add code into Tidy to do what you want.
Tidy provides a simple interface for walking markup trees, although
it doesn't conform the the DOM, but this is hardly surprising given
that work on Tidy started before the DOM.

I use Tidy and MSXSML and I have no problems.
Sure not every page will go through MSXML but
if 8/10 do then I'm happy. !!
