I was delighted to read in
ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 2/WG 3/N 441
how ISO 8859-16 is officially considered by the Kingdom of the
Netherlands a threat to their national security. (Though it makes we
worry whether the Dutch secret police is now after me, having made
available tools for generating X11 fonts for that encoding with the
subversive COMMA BELOW characters. Implementors beware.)

If they are concerned about criminals misspelling their names using
comma below versus cedilla, they may want to consider that such people
also use aliases and false passports. ;-)

According to their explanation, Unicode is a threat of their national
security as well :-) U+015F != U+0219 ...

If I understand the argument correctly, if someone named Robert goes by
the handle of Bob, the whole government crumbles. Fortunately, criminals
always spell their names correctly.

The security stuff is clearly overblown. The other arguments
before, about actual mixed use in books and newspapers, are
much more serious.
