Can anyone specify the requirements that IPv6 will have for changes to
HTTP 1.1, apart from URL structure?
There aren't any - there is already a spec (sorry, don't have the
reference handy) on how to write an IPv6 address in a URL.

That is quite simple and already discussed in the WG.
the standard IPv6 address specifies an IPv6 address. Because there are
always more than one ":", you know it's IPv6.
e.g. "fe80::01" or "fe80::3a3c:2bc:96f5:1060"
If you specify a port, you must send the IPv6 address as:
"[" IPv6-address "]:" port
e.g. "[fe80::01]:8080" or "[fe80::3a3c:2bc:96f5:1060]:81"
So the URL is:
e.g. "http://fe80::01/" or "http://[fe80::3a3c:2bc:96f5:1060]:81/"
for the rest nothing changes. The server (or gateway) just has to
reqognise these addresses...
Please correct me if I'm wrong.....
Send to the WG directly (no CC please), can take a while...

In Proposed Standard RFC 2732, IPv6 URLs must always have the
address enclosed in square brackets, whether or not a port
is supplied.

How about priority information though? Am I correct in assuming that it will
be specified by the individual application, and is therefore outside of the
scope of HTTP?

As far as I know is there no specification that handles this for HTTP.
