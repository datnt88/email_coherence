Hello tidy list,
I'm using tidy with an xml document that contains html. When I run the
following command, spaces after the anchor tags are removed since it
reformats the document like normal xml. Can I have tidy ignore anchor
tags?
/usr/local/bin/tidy -xml -iqm $file
untidied: a href="blah" blah /a hello world
tidied: a href="blah" blah /a hello world
notice the space after " /a " is removed.
Any suggestions?
Thanks in advance,

No...
A bug...
Is this something being addressed or should I open a bug report?
Regards,

This is a known bug and will be addressed some day. I think there is
already a bug report in the bug tracker, if not I will create one.
