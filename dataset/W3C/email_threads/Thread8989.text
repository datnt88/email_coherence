This is a coment concerning
We have been reading this recommendation trying to understand how to
make best use of it for signing RDF documents.
We are finding it useful.
We are embedding signatures so formed within further RDF documents and
ideally wish to reuse parts of your RDF data model:
However, there does not seem to be a corresponding namespace or RDF
schema document or ....
If there is such a document, please can you send a pointer. If not,
please can we have the source code for your gif, that will probably be
better than nothing!
If there is such a document I suggest that an erratum including the link
in section 9 should be considered.

Hi Jeremy, it's not much of a data model; it's a simple transliteration of
the XML syntax into RDF -- versus the richer sort of semantics expressed in
XML (e.g., [1]). In any case, this work goes back to the start of RDF and I
don't recall there ever being a schema, and I no longer have the visio
files, though that might exist in some W3C filesystem somewhere.
