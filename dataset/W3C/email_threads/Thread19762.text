When building from source (amaya-src-1.1b.tar.gz,
thot-src-2.1e.tar.gz, thoteditor-src-2.1e.tar.gz) on Redhat Linux 4.2
(Intel), configure reports a warning that Java classes are not found
and it disables Java, much to my chagrin.
[pmr@copa linux-pc-i386]$ ../configure --with-thot --with-amaya --enable-java --enable-jit --enable-plugin --with-motif --enable-math
checking for Motif... libraries /usr/X11R6/lib, headers /usr/X11R6/include
configure: warning: Amaya Java classes not found : disabling Java!
updating cache ./config.cache
Poking around in configure, it would appear that Thot/classes should
get stuffed with certain Java source files. This is not happening.
Is my expectation correct?
Also, FWIW, the installation/build instructions neglect to mention
that kaffe-0.9.2 should be acquired and installed in Thot/.

Hi Paul,
the Amaya and Amaya-Java distribution are now separated,
the Amaya standard distribution doesn't ship the Java code
anymore. I am planning on making a new release real soon now.
It's mainly a matter of doing more documentation.
I was waiting for Biss-AWT to be reintegrated in the Kaffe
distribution, but it seem it takes longer than expected.
I guess that the amaya-1.1a source code can still be found
on Linux sunsite archives and these should have the java code.
Sorry for the inconvenience,
Daniel

Thanks for the update.
If there is one salient lesson that Linus Torvalds has to offer the
Free Software World, it has to be "release early and often". Please
don't wait any longer, but release what you have. And do it again real
soon now. :-)
