unless you are going to really work to make it fit, picture is a poor
choice of title as is logo, image, or any other content label.
It's a poor choice for ALT text, but it is highly appropriate as
a TITLE, in my opinion. If someone chooses to have their browser
read TITLEs at the same time it reads ALT text, hey, more power
to 'em, but it _is_ correct to identify an image as a picture (or
photograph or logo or whatever) in a TITLE="" element of an IMG
tag.
The rules for TITLE are not the same as the rules for ALT.

Dear JAWS / HTML wizards,
Okay, I am using the latest version of JFW on a Windows 2000 box.
When I come across an image (not inside a link) that has BOTH a title and
alt attributes, JAWS reads ONLY the title -- and I can not get it to read
the alt content!
(1) Can any else on this list confirm this bad behavior? Home Page Reader
and Lynx don't have this problem!
(2) Am I doing something wrong? Is there a reasonable way around this
obstacle? I even adjusted the "HTML Graphics Verbosity" level. Now JAWS
reads the file name of the graphic, but still not the alt content. Please
advise.
(3) Does anyone know if using title on a link that contains an image causes
similar problems? E.g.:
a href="foo.html" title="" img src="foo.png" alt="Link to
Foo." /a
I have recommend variations on the above as a way to accessibly defeat IE
image mouse-over pop-ups that site authors disliked. Did I inadvertently
give bad advice?
(4) Does Mozilla / Netscape 6 visually render ALT or TITLE like MS IE does
on Windows?
IMHO titles belong on links -- and that's about it. (Yes, Kynn, I know the
specs allow them just about everywhere, but that's not the point.)
Thanks.

I ran into the same issue doing some user testing with JAWS recently. It
does appear that for images (and image links), JAWS 3.7 will read only one
of the following, in this order of priority:
(1) link title (if it is a link)
(2) image title
(3) image alt
JAWS does have configuration settings that apply to text links (read text,
title, or longest), but they don't seem to affect how it reads images.
Behavior was the same under both Windows 2000 and Windows 95.
Maybe in the next version...

I agree that this particular problem is a bug with JAWS.
As you know, I am a big fan of spec-compliant coding and UA.
As far as browsers go, we've got maybe IE on the Mac and Netscape/Mozzilla 6
that come close to rendering HTML 4 tolerably well. What behavior would be
reasonable for a browser for code like:
a href="foo.html" title="Big World of Foo." img src="foo.png"
alt="Come to Foo!" /a
The current state of the art is, I would argue, fairly reasonable and
predictable. With a screen reader, the link title and graphic alt are read
in sequence. It is actually clear which belongs to which. Screen reader or
not, I can preview the link title before activating the link. Graphically,
a mouse-over pop-up has a choice of two content pieces and, quite
reasonably, the title of the link takes precedence (and this additional
information is rendered rather subtly). Oh yeah, I also have the image or
the associated alt -- depending if graphics are loaded or not. Okay then,
with screen reader or not, my browser has unobtrusively presented me with
(1) a graphic or ALT content, (2) URL and associated (title) text. Life is
good.
Now, suppose I want to be on the bleeding edge. Or maybe I am confused
about what makes good ALT content -- and I am trying to make everybody
happy. I mistakenly figure that more is more, so I code something like:
a href="foo.html" title="Big World of Foo." img src="foo.png"
title="Foo Globe Icon" alt="Come to Foo!" /a
Sure, this is perfectly logical and valid. But face it, this gives me THREE
textual associations for the graphic. As the author, there is no way I
could guess what the user is going to get! I cannot come up with a scenario
that would reveal all three (or even two out of three) in any natural way
(with out requiring extra keystrokes on the part of the user, or some other
artifice) for a graphical user agent. Can you?
Please Kynn, if you think titles should be included everywhere, please
explain how they might be revealed in the graphical user interface! It gets
even more complicated, since the above example could be inside a P or DIV
with its own title! Yeech!
TITLE is largely superfluous, except on links and ABBR and ACRONYM. Until
user agents figure out how to handle the attribute, it should be avoided.
This IS a practical, real world, accessibility issue.
Kynn, depending on the weather, you are frequently in favor of backwards
compliant coding and even minor code tweaks to make up for idiosyncratic
behavior of Assistive Technology. I would argue that this belongs in that
category. Unless you are certain of the resultant browser behavior, avoid
TITLE.
-- Bruce
P.S. One _could_ make the argument that the behavior of JAWS is NOT broken:
TITLE is a newer attribute than ALT and therefore an author is more likely
to put more thought into TITLE (if present) than ALT (especially since we
know how bad ALT tends to be). Besides, IE visually renders TITLE in
deference to ALT -- so that is the one people pay more attention to.
Therefore, if both are present, TITLE must be the more important one -- so
that's the one that should get read by the screen reader.

This sounds to me like a user agent problem, not a markup problem.
The markup is done properly, but the assistive technology fails
on it; whose responsibility is it to correct this problem?
In my opinion, it's on the shoulders of the JFW people -- but if
someone is specifically designing an interface for JFW (such as
an edaptive system that recognizes JAWS), the optimal code for that
user agent should be delivered.
Sure it is -- the user agent is not respecting the spec, and neither
is your humble opinion, so why should we listen to either? Title is
meant to be used, potentially, EVERYWHERE, and a user agent which
breaks on such a circumstance is a faulty user agent.
The question then becomes whether or not you should compensate for
that problem in the user agent (in my model with an edaptive
interface, I would say yes), but you surely should not condone this
type of faulty behavior by suggesting that _only_ links can have
titles, because JFW got it wrong.
I don't think I've said titles should be included _everywhere_, but
I don't agree with you that it's -incorrect- to include titles.
How should they be revealed in the GUI? I don't think I've said
they should be revealed in the GUI either. They're metadata, and
metadata shouldn't necessarily be revealed in all presentations.
Why? Most user agents either ignore it or make it a tooltip. Tooltips
can be useful.
Depending on the weather? If you're going to make personal attacks
on me like you made personal attacks on Anne Pemberton before she
quit the WAI IG list, you'd best stop right now, Bruce.
I think you are constructing a number of straw men -- such as the
two I pointed out at the beginning of this letter -- and I also
think you are making a number of incorrect assumptions which lead
to your apparent (and mostly inexplicable) confusion about "what
Kynn is in favor of" (as if that were worth anything; what matters
is access by people with disabilities).
You seem to be forgetting, most of all, that for the last year I
have been advocating the solution favored by my employer, first
Edapta and now Reef. Lest you think I'm blindly following the
company line (which may be your next accusation, or perhaps someone
will post the accessibility errors on the Reef page, or whatever),
I'll add that I originally joined Edapta because I felt that
approach made the most sense and in fact fit in with what I had
previously independently arrived at as "the best solution." See,
for example, the CC/PP page I posted during my tenure as the HTML
Writers Guild's member of that working group: http://www.ccpp.org/
In short, the Edapta philosophy states that you deliver the best
presentation possible to the user based on all knowledge you can
gather about that user. This means edapting pages dynamically (or
selecting the best from a pre-existing set), and that means that
you can indeed make the types of changes necessary to account for
problems with JAWS (assuming you know the user is using JAWS).
What you perceive as "Kynn changing his mind on a whim" (or "with
the weather" or whatever rather insulting terms you used) is merely
"Bruce unable to keep up with the complexities of edaptation", dear
friend. Perhaps it's my fault for not explaining clearly enough,
but I think other people have been able to follow me and I've
recently gotten some private compliments on my posts.
This makes absolutely no sense, Bruce.

Dear Kynn,
My sincere apologies for upsetting you. I really didn't mean to insult you,
and my "depending on the weather" cut was uncalled for. As you wrote,
perhaps you are the paragon of philosophical consistency -- and I am just
too dull to appreciate it.
I don't agree with promoting techniques (e.g., using TITLE attributes
superfluously) that interferes with the accessibility of current products
(e.g., JFW), even if future products (e.g., Edapta) will remediate such
coding. The fact that such a practice is (technically) syntactically valid,
hardly mitigates against the current usability issue.
Yep, titles are metadata. Yep, GUI browsers tend to render them as ToolTips
(what I was calling mouse-over pop-ups). Yep, tool tips can be useful
(which is why I cited their use in links, abbr and acronym). Those points
we agree on. The disagreement is that you are willing to promote (currently
useless -- the search engines don't even process them) metadata when we know
that IN ACTUAL PRACTICE this sacrifices accessibility?!? Forgive me, but I
don't believe the pre-Edapta Kynn would have suggested such a thing! You
didn't answer my hard question: Given the three (!) reasonable choices,
what is an algorithm for deciding what the ToolTips text content should be
for the following example?
a href="foo.html" title="Big World of Foo." img src="foo.png" title="Foo
Globe Icon" alt="Come to Foo!" /a
It doesn't get much easier when one has to decide the reasonable behavior of
a screen reader!
JAWS, when faced with this vague situation, favors TITLE content over ALT.
This choice is arbitrary, but not entirely illogical.
The simple solution to this quandary is for authors to skip the TITLE
attribute -- unless one has some clear expectations for browser behavior.
Don't expect the browser (screen reader or not) to make the right choice.
As a content provider, don't expect the machine browser to read your mind!
Avoid this ambiguity.
