Just a reminder that we will have a telecon this Thursday 15 pm
UTC/London (10am Boston, 7am San Francisco, 4pm Amsterdam/Paris,
midnight Tokyo).
I will distribute an agenda tomorrow, with also the telecon details.
The agenda will have time slots for the task forces we decided to start
up in Cannes, plus a few other issues.

To offer some sense of organization, here are a few suggested topics to
discuss during our slot in the telecon tomorrow:
name/acronym [ 5 minutes]
how to work (ie word, html, wiki; format for patterns; format for design
issues)

Dr. Christopher A. Welty, Knowledge Structures Group
IBM Watson Research Center, 19 Skyline Dr., Hawthorne, NY 10532 USA
i must have missed the original announcement and discussion if this is a
reminder.
I looked in the archives and did not find anything either.
Can we please put on the agenda a time that is more reasonable than 7am
for telecons?
what about the old webont time of 9am pacific time? 9am can work but
7am will not work on any kind of regular basis.
thank you,
