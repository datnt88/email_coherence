I have submitted a new IETF draft on the Application/Multiplexed
Content-Type. Its URL is
-00.txt
This draft is simpler than the two previous drafts for Application/BatchBeep
and Multipart/Interleaved and results from feedback about the two previous
drafts.
An Application/Multiplexed entity consists of one or more chunks. Each chunk
starts with a chunk header line whose syntax is:
"CHK" SP messageNumber SP length SP isMore CR LF
For example, message 3 split into two chunks might have the headers
"CHK 3 512 Y CR LF" and "CHK 3 358 N CR LF".
The last chunk is an empty chunk with just the header line "CHK 0 0 N CR
LF".
I intend for the proposed solution to solve a useful class of printing
problems that Multipart/Related does not solve. I also recognize that a
protocol would solve and even wider class of problems, but there are cases
in the printing world where a single stream of bytes is a better solution
than a protocol, e.g. when the submitter of the print job doesn't hang
around until the printing occurs.
I would appreciate comments.

if this is really intended just to solve some printing problems, how
about calling it something like application/multiplexed-printer-data
or some such? I hate to see something which is intended as a stopgap
measure given a name that makes it look like a general-purpose facility.
Although problems in the printing world provide the motivation for
Application/Multiplexed, there may be other applications that would be able
to use it. So, I don't want to pick a name that suggests that this solution
is limited to printing applications.
