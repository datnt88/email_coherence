Hi,
The HTML Tidy is great! But there is one problem that I can't
solved.
The Original :
After HTML Tidy :
();"
I noticed that the HTML Tidy will changed the %JSID% into "3C%JSID%%3E " which is not correct.
Is there any switch or option to turn this feature off.
Thanks..

Are you using a recent version of Tidy?

I got the HTML tidy through the ultra-edit 10.0B text editor. I am not
sure which version of the DLL that they are using. Is there anyway, how I
can upgrade the DLL?
Thanks..
