I've been updating ARP trying to get it to pass the test cases in the
zip file and have hit a number of problems.
Earlier in:
and the related thread I queried
rdf-ns-prefix-confusion/test0007.rdf
rdf-ns-prefix-confusion/test0008.rdf
1: rdf-ns-prefix-confusion/test0007.rdf
I suggested that the triple
http://example.org/resource/ http://example.org/property "bar" .
was missing from rdf-ns-prefix-confusion/test0007.nt
I got no response on that one.
2: rdf-ns-prefix-confusion/test0008.rdf
There was some discussion that didn't terminate on this one.

test 8 contains an rdf:aboutEachPrefix and is thus now not in the
RDF/XML language. The file should be renamed as an error case or
removed entirely (it does not test anything else that is not covered
by other cases).
which I am supportive of.
A further problem is that a couple of files still have xml:base in them

I propose we fix this by adding the triple.

Lets fix this too by removing test0008.rdf
I also support the removal of the xml:base attributes from
Do we need this confirmed by the WG or can we just get these fixed as errors?

I agree. When this if fixed, the subjects of the two triples in:
also be fixed.
test 8 contains an rdf:aboutEachPrefix and is thus now not in the
RDF/XML language. The file should be renamed as an error case or
removed entirely (it does not test anything else that is not covered
by other cases).
I also support removing this test or making it an error.
I think xml:base should be removed from all of the exsiting
test cases. If/when the WG decides how RDF should use/support
XML Base, a new set of XML Base related test case(s) should
be created.
