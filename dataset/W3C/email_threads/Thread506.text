This may be a very simple question that has an answer in the Tidy
documentation, but for some reason I'm not finding it. Please bear with
me...
I'm using Tidy to clean up some XML files. These files have sections that
look like this:
Eval="Y" goCerFacetsAction.goDictionary.Item("JobIniDirectory") &amp;amp;
goCerFacetsAction.goDictionary.Item("StepId") &amp;amp; "_" &amp;amp;
goCerFacetsAction.goDictionary.Item("StepNumber") &amp;amp; ".ini" /Item
And Tidy fixes them up to look like this:
goCerFacetsAction.goDictionary.Item("JobIniDirectory") &amp;amp;
goCerFacetsAction.goDictionary.Item("StepId") &amp;amp; "_" &amp;amp;
goCerFacetsAction.goDictionary.Item("StepNumber") &amp;amp;
".ini" /Item
Tidy fixes the indents and handles text wrapping beautifully. This makes me
very happy. Tidy also inserts extra blank lines between the Item tags, and
I can't find a way to turn this option off. This is frustrating me. Can
someone please give me any guidance for disabling this feature? Thanks in
advance for any help you can give me.
Also, when I get a response from someone on the list, should I just reply to
the individual's address, or to html-tidy@w3.org?
Okay, I also pored over the documentation at the new site (sourceforge.net)
and still can't find any answers. Any tips?
