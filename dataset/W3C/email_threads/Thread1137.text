I'm having trouble getting tidy to correct URL's with ampersand (&amp;)
character.
The page below contains one URL with part "...05B8&amp;displaylang=en". For
some reason tidy doesn't want to convert the &amp; mark correctly. Could
someone advice if the cause is my config below?
Here's a link to the sample page:
Here's my tidy configuration:
char-encoding: latin1
doctype: strict
tidy-mark: no
clean: yes
drop-font-tags: yes
logical-emphasis: yes
output-xml: yes
output-xhtml: yes
numeric-entities: yes
show-warnings: no
show-body-only: yes
hide-comments: yes
drop-proprietary-attributes: yes
word-2000: yes
quote-marks: yes
quote-ampersand: yes
force-output: yes
Thanks, Tommi
Works for me. What behavior did you expect? What did Tidy instead? Which
version (`tidy -v`)?
I have a .NET wrapper that is using the tidylib.dll from
tidy-040318-dll-fast.zip. Could it be that the win32 dll doesn't working
properly correctly?
The wrapper I'm using does LoadConfig and then tidyCleanAndRepair.

You haven't answered the first two questions.
I doubt that. Could you try the command line application instead?
You can find it from http://htmltrim.sourceforge.net/tidy.html .
Solved it.. a bit silly :)
There was a wysiwyg editor that showed the content after it was
processed by tidy. When the data was reloaded onto the page and
displayed in the editor, the editor (HTMLArea 3) apparently translated
the &amp;amp; values back into &amp;.
I changed the page so it performs tidy after data has been submitted
from page and stores the pure tidy processed data into the database.
This solved the problem.
Thanks for your help!
Ps. Here's a link to the editor http://dynarch.com/mishoo/htmlarea.epl
