Thanks for the answers. One more question:
I see nothing in the spec that prevents a PUT of a chunked (possibly
multipart) byterange.
Is this intentional, did I miss something, or am I the only one who
has no clue why one would want to do it?
Thank You,
Richard L. Gray
No, you may indeed want to upload a document using chunked transfer
encoding. libwww in fact does that if it for some reason doesn't know the
size. Data objects can just as well be generated dynamically on client side
as on server side.
Byte ranges are likewise most useful for example if you are handling very
large objects.

Sorry, I failed to make myself clear. I can imagine wanting to do one
or the other, but the question is *both* at the same time.

No, I wouldn't do both at the same time either. OTOH, there is no reason
for the HTTP spec to prevent use of both at the same time. There are
a lot of things in the HTTP spec which aren't mentioned simply because
no one would want to do them.
