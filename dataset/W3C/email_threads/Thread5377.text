This is something I've been meaning to ask for a while, but have only just
got around to...
Can anyone indicate a gentle introduction to AI planning techniques,
sufficient to understanding roughly what is involved in applying them to
Semantic Web services?

Most AI textbooks have discussions. The one in Russell and Norvig seems
ok enough. They also discuss the sitcalc.
Plug for UMDer: Dana Nau has a planning textbook forthcoming (in march).
See: http://www.cs.umd.edu/~nau/
Some of his lectures might be useful:

In addition to the papers/books Bijan has recommended, I recommend
the following overview paper on AI planning.
It doesn't relate them to web service composition, but it is a
reasonable overview of the field.

Dan Weld

Thanks, to both of you, this was most helpful.
Sensitized to what I'm looking for, there seems to be some useful
background material in Luger and Subblefield, and I found the planning
chapter of Russell and Norvig is on the web:

The Weld paper also appears to be very useful. I think there's plenty to
chew on here!
