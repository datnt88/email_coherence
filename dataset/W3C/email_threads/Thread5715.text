I've made the results from running the current approved OWL semantic tests using
the current CVS version of Jena2 available here:
These are automated tests. Given the earlier discussion on tests with reduced
comprehension support then we've added a simple query processor which implements
the comprehensions required for the query. No manual intervention is required.
Note that the rule-based OWL inference support in Jena2 is only aimed at
OWL/Lite so tests that require OWL/DL features such as complementOf and unionOf
have not been included (we do include incomplete support for oneOf and hasValue
due to user requests).
Of the relevant positive entailment tests we are incomplete on four tests:
description-logic 661 &amp; 662
I5.2-006 (defining union within OWL-lite)
I5.8-010 (0 is the only nonNegative and nonPositive integer)
The latter failure could be remedied.
The negative entailment tests are reported as passing in the weak sense that we
do not find the entailment. These should probably be reported as incomplete
rather than pass.

republished to include this.
They should indeed; will you please change this?
As I understand it, passing a N.E.T. means proving that the entailment
does not hold in the given logic (DL, Full, Lite). Calling it
incomplete at least says it's not a "Fail", and the output link can
give details about how thorough the search for a decision was (even
though finding one would have indicated a failure). Or you can just
skip them, since you know it'll never pass.

Done.
I've chosen to skip them since that seems to be what other similar
systems have done.

I think there is distinct value in reporting an incomplete here as opposed
to being silent.
The plausibility of the logical correctness of the tests is enhanced by the
number of reasonable thorough systems that do not fail these tests.
