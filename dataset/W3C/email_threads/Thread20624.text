Hello,
I am just descovering Amaya today and find it has some very goog features.
I was nevertheless astonished that some sites show bad, for example
mostly because of difficulties with frames. I did look at the archives of
this list to find some information: I found ideas about the sens of
framing, no hint that frames are not welcome to this browser.
Secondly: while browsing, I prefer helvetica fonts to times fonts. Is there
any way to change the setting? I did not find any.
Thanks in advance

Yes you can change that by defining your User CSS style sheet. It's the file
amaya.css located in your AmayaHome Directory (see Help/Configuring to know
where is this directory in your platform).
Mine amaya.css file contains:
@media print {
BODY {font-size: 10pt}
@media screen {
BODY {font-family: Helvetica}
Irene.
Is the AmayaHome directory not created automatically on installation? At least,
under Win NT I have neither c:\winnt\profiles\username\amaya nor amaya.css.
Thanks,
Dennis Kibbe
