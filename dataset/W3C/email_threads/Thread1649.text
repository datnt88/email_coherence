In our group we are discussing about the exact meaning of the additional
precondition(s) DAV:supported-live-property for PROPFIND and PROPPATCH (3.11
and 3.12 in RFC 3253). In particular, the meaning of "the semantics of a
property being supported by the server".
Is the following an example?
A PROPPATCH request intends to modify the value of a "checkout-fork"
property of a checked-out VCR to something different than DAV:forbidden or
DAV:discouraged, say, to an empty value. Then the
DAV:supported-live-property precondition is violated.
Another interpretation is, that it has to do with properties which are not
REQUIRED (...but there are not such properties as fas as I can see!).
Thanks,
Peter
As I understand it, the precondition will prevent that a resource
can have dead properties of the same name as a deltav live property.
So, on a deltav compliant server, you cannot retrieve or set the
property DAV:version-history on a non-VCR resource (e.g. plain,
unversioned resource of RFC 2518 style).
A server, just followin 2518, would allow the setting of such
a property. It would be a dead properties without any meaning,
but returned on a PROPFIND nevertheless.

Dr., Peter:
Speaking of PROPPATCH preconditions, I can't help noticing that
(DAV:cannot-modify-version-controlled-property): If the request attempts to
modify a dead property, same semantics as PUT (see Section 3.10).
(DAV:cannot-modify-version): If the request attempts to modify a dead
property, same semantics as PUT (see Section 3.10).
are identical.
Which one should be reported?
By inference from Section 3.10, it looks like
DAV:cannot-modify-version-controlled-property should be reported
when the request-URL identifies a resource with a DAV:checked-in
property, and DAV:cannot-modify-version should be reported when
the request-URL identifies a version resource.

Stefan is correct. These conditions ensure that you will see
those properties on a (3253 compliant) resource if and only if
they have the 3253 defined semantics.
