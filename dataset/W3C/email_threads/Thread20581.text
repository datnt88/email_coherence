I've noted that amaya converts my &amp;deg; character entity into the B0
character. This character is rendered incorrectly by some browsers,
including Opera 6.03, and I'd rather it keep my character entity anyway. Is
this possible?
All pending/suspected bugs in [1] are still present. Any idea of when they
might be addressed -- particularly the dictionary interface?

I've further experiemented with this issue in an xhtml document and if I set
the encoding to "us-ascii" Amaya converts the &amp;deg; entity to its numeric
form: &amp;#xb0; . This makes sense as an XML document, but could not Amaya
also preserve it as an XHTML document? Do I have to do something in my
doctype to enable this preservation?
Changed in the CVS base.
Amaya will generate the &amp;deg; entity in the future.
Is this just for the degree named character entity, or all named character
entities? Also, does this apply under all character encodings, or just
us-ascii?
Characters &amp;amp;   &amp;nbsp; &amp;deg; are always exported as named entities
independently of the current character encoding.
