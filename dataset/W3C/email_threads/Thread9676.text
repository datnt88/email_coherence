Guys, I would like some advise on the preferred terminology to use
when discussing reification.
If we start with a triple
a b c .
and reify it, we get a graph of four triples
_:x rdf:type rdf:Statement .
_:x rdf:subject a .
_:x rdf:predicate b .
_:x rdf:object c .
1. I think it is correct to refer to the second graph as "a
reification" of the first triple, is that right?
2. Is there a preferred terminology to refer to the bnode which
denotes the triple in the reification, ie _:x in this example? (If
not, I will have to make one up.)
Thanks.

Preferred by whom? A possibility is "one of those pieces of reification
s@&amp;%*$#t", but that's probably not what you mean (accurate, mind you,
but a bit long, and probably wouldn't be allowed in a W3C Rec).

Heh, unless you ensure it uses "-ize" instead of "-ise" in all the
appropriate places.
Preferred name: "The (b)node that denotes the triple in the
reification"? It depends on how many times you need to write it. "The
reifying bnode" might be an acceptable alternative, providing you
introduce the phrase first.

Theoremhood is positively decidable.
It just takes time at least exponential in the length of the proof.
yes.
M&amp;S uses "reified statement".
