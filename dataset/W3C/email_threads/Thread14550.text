Agenda
Please review the latest draft at http://www.w3.org/WAI/gl/WCAG20/ paying
particular attention to those items marked as "proposed" (mostly examples
and explanations in this version). Checkpoints 2.3, 3.1, 3.11, 6.1 and 6.2
have been discussed in recent meetings.
We need to determine which of these checkpoints, if any, should be
approved in their present form, what modifications should be made, and
whether any further issues arise in respect of any of the proposed noted
in the draft. Checkpoint 6.2, in particular, has not been examined in
detail; it reflects a proposal developed on the mailing list.
If time permits, the working group may also wish to consider the difficult
question of "user agent capabilities", that is, how to decide when a
particular feature or technology has been adequately implemented by user
agents, thereby entitling content developers to take advantage of it, or
rely upon it, as the case may be.
Checkpoints 3.4 and 3.9 seem to me redundant with checkpoints 2.1 and 2.3 so
I propose we delete them.
The details...
3.4 provides for labelling (in markup) important pieces of content. I think
that this is the major focus of 2.3, and more properly belongs there.
3.9 provides for labelling abbreviations and acronyms - this is a special
case of that, and should become a technique.

If we are to perform radical surgery on the 3.x checkpoints we need to look
at more than those two. E.g. "3.5 Place distinguishing information at the
beginning of headings..." is arguably a "technique" as are some of the
others. The thrust of guideline 2 is "structure" and of 3 "content" - I think?
We seem to be challenged as to the viability of the concepts
structure/content/presentation and whether their separation should form
such a basic position in our guidelines. I remain persuaded that this
concept is central and think a fourth (called "action" or something to
denote "programmatic" and "interactive" elements) that involves scripts,
applets ("objects"?) might fill the dance card.
To that end we might (briefly?) discuss the possible separation of
checkpoints dealing with each of those "elelments" so that, e.g. GL2 groups
how to deal with structure, GL3 with content, GL4 with presentation, and
perhaps one for "objects"? Just a random barb to scratch on at 6 AM in the
Washington Wilderness!

ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE
Counter proposal - we don't
The checkpoints have things in common, true, and sometimes when doing the
one you will do the other.
But not always.
So for example, I could write a long paragraph in html, with lots of ideas
flowing into each other, and jump back to the first idea and then say "see
above", so that people could (theoretically) understand to what I refer. I
further could fill it with internal jargon and legalisms etc.
I think that that is valid html and can complies to guideline 2. It fails
checkpoints 3.4 and 3.9
(for further examples of this - see the old version of WAI)
I think what is the most distant about them is their porpoise. Checkpoint 2
is about use of markup (lets not get into it) and checkpoint three is about
were accessibility meets usability, specially for the educationally
challenged, but in fact for all groups.

The example of a long bit of text is only valid in the sense that its syntax
follows the rules of HTML. This meets checkpoint 2.1 (use the language right)
but fails 2.3 - use the markup to mark things up - abbreviations, structures,
etc.
I also believe that the checkpoints which talk about how to structure
information are important. For example, breaking up content into manageable
chunks, providing summaries / overviews, etc...
