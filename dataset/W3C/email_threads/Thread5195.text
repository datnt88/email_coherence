Hi,
im doing some experiments with DAML-S/OWL-S and
i have some doubts:
1) Is there any java package with high level APIs
for managing this services' ontologies or should i
write it from scratch (using Jena or else) ?
2) I've read that DAML-S (OWL-S) and WSDL should
have a bidirectional relationship (for grounding):
-in DAML-S (OWL-S) Wsdlgrounding (wsdlOperation,
wsdlMessagepart etc.)
-in WSDL using daml-s-parameter (owl-s-parameter)
Can you please explain me this choice ? Wont it be
sufficient to have DAML-S pointing to WSDL docs ?
In daml-s-wsdl.htm i found this sentence:
3) Is there any WSDL2OWLS site/service/package
like WSDL2DAMLS ?
Thank you in advance,

There are several tools and APIs for managing (OWL) ontologies in
general. E.g., the OWL API [1] and the OilEd [2] and Protege [3]
editors.

There is an IBM ontology management system called SNOBASE. Details at:
managing ontologies written in OWL. Also, in this SNOBASE package, there
is a basic version of API for accessing DAML-S ontology model for Web
Services. You can download it and try it out from:
Thank you in advance,

The CMU group also has updated the WSDL2DAML-S tool to WSDL2OWL-S.
It is available at http://www.daml.ri.cmu.edu/wsdl2owls
We have also finished the implementation and are packaging for distribution
an OWL-S Profile API and an OWL-S Process Model API.

Thank you for pointing this out, I was just about the send this message
about our API. We have a beta version of OWL-S API available at
The API provides reading different versions of OWL-S (0.9, 1.0 as well
as DAML-S 0.7) and generating the OWL-S output so you can use it as a
version converter. Executing OWL-S services that has a WSDL grounding is
provided in the API. Unfortunately documentation is not complete and not
many examples exist in the package. However, javadocs
(http://www.mindswap.org/2004/owl-s/api/docs/javadocs/) should help you
get started and I'd be happy to answer questions.
Regards
Evren
