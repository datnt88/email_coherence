I have not been able to get Amaya to run in Windows 95 (ver 4.0.1111).
I have looked through the archive and found that someone else had the same
problem on Windows NT4, this message was called 'Amaya on NT4' from Ross
Smith (ross.smith@nz.eds.com) on Thu, 09 Oct 1997 10:51:38 +1200. I found
no solution in the Archives, perhaps I overlooked the message.
Amaya will run for a few seconds then close, the GUI never appears.
Amaya was unzipped in the c:\ directory. I have a directory called C:\tmp .
I have set the HOME_PAGE=http://kg9ae.dyn.ml.org/ . I have made several
changes to the thot.ini with no success. Are there any environment
variables that need to be set? I tried adding the thot directory, including
subdirectories, to the path.
My machine is a Pentium 166 MHz, 32 MB SDRAM, 72 MB swap file. I have 16MB
free physical memory.

Hi David,
We recommand to unzip the binaries of amaya using winzip
(http://www.winzip.com).
The latest release of Amaya creates the directory C:\TEMP if this
latter doesn't exist.
Now the only problem you may have is the thot.ini file. It should
look like the following:
[thot_lib]
THOTSYSSCH=$(THOTDIR)\amaya
DICOPAR=$(THOTDIR)\dicopar
[amaya.exe]
THOTSYSSCH=$(THOTDIR)\amaya
LANG=en_US
HOME_PAGE=http://kg9ae.dyn.ml.org
Check this file and try amaya again, it should work.

Thank you. The c:\temp directory was the problem. Wonderful
browser/editor. Keep up the great work.
