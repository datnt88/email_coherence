Reviewing the copy of the abstract data model in the archive:
I'm seeing it truncated. A problem with our proxy or is the archive

Indeed, the file in the filesystem is truncated at
the words "Used with the R" in Section 2.5.
the text/html part3 was 28K and had a valid base64
boundary mark. However, it is truncated the same
way that the file appears in the archive.
Buggy software on my system. See:
