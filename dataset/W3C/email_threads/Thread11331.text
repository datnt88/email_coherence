4.2.a Should we formalize at all the concept of a base address?
Yes, it's generally useful for a variety of reasons, e.g. replication
support, it's a real pity that HTML BASE is in general not better
defined and understood.
4.2.b If so, should we call it a location source or something else?
Don't care.
4.2.c Should we formalize the concept of the implied location source?
No, the cost-return ratio doesn't seem that good; perhaps Eliot has some
killer examples though. -T.
4.2.a Should we formalize at all the concept of a base address?
True. It is a useful concept to formally define.
However, if we do, we need to establish what is the resolution
between discrepency between implied-resource-name (resource name used
to reach this resource) and the "base" value.
While we are at it, should we also build in the ability to have the
document its prefered resource name? The one of many paths to that
resource that is prefered to be remembered?
4.2.c Should we formalize the concept of the implied location source?
Is this the same as: resource name used to reach this resource ?
If so, we do need the concept to express priority policy re expressed
location source.

4.2.c Should we formalize the concept of the implied location source?
Note that in the case of resources delivery based on client type (eg., 24bit
GIF vs. 1 bit GIF) the implied location will depend on who is asking for the
resource. We may have to allow for binding client-type information to the
request.

4.2.a Should we formalize at all the concept of a base address?
If you specify a "Base" (locsc) you deep-six any other logic for
determining the base. No problem.
No. If people give something more than one name, they are responsible for
making them all work. Otherwise we intorduce pointless complexity.
4.2.c Should we formalize the concept of the implied location source?
I don't see that we need anything other than relative URL rules for this --
either relative to the retrieval-source of the document, or whatever BASE
was specified.
This keeps it simple, and re-uses Web semantics where they make a lot of sense.
