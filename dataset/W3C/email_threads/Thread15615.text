Hi all,
I want to emphasize the importance of an appropriate WAI statement related
to language definition again (although there already is a request by Ben
Caldwell [1]), since the WCAG still say
'If you use a number of different languages on a page, make sure
that any changes in language are clearly identified by using the
lang attribute.' [2]
This makes it impossible to 'validate' a document against these guidelines
when it's XHTML 1.1 compliant, since XHTML 1.1 clearly imposes
'On every element, the lang attribute has been removed in favor
of the xml:lang attribute (as defined in [XHTMLMOD]).' [3]
consequently throwing an error if you use the 'lang' attribute. Due to the
increasing amount of XHTML 1.1 documents it seems absolutely necessary to
adapt the guidelines, not only to demonstrate the technical sensitiveness ;)
All the best,
Jens.

Just wanted to note that in my original mail, sent on behalf of the i18n WG,
there were two additional points made.
-change of order of material
-obsoletion of rfc1766
Thanks.

Thanks for your comments Jens.
Note that credit for this suggestion goes to Richard Ishida. I just happened
to be the one who added the issues to Bugzilla...
Agreed. We'll need to generalize the task, removing references to the use of
the lang attribute. One of the things on our to-do list for HTML Techniques
includes identifying the specification to which each example corresponds and
adding a number of additional examples. Current examples in this technique
would apply to HTML 4.01 and we'll need to add some additional examples for
XHTML 1.1 as you describe.
Would you be interested in taking an action item to write an XHTML example
for this technique and make some suggestions about how to update the text?
Thanks,
-Ben
How to update the text (one suggestion):
So: in the prose, say
... are clearly identified, using the appropriate markup
attribute.
Then insert a short table indicating what the appropriate markup element
is for sample formats noting the change between HTML 4.01 and XHTML 1.1.
Link to the EO literature of the i18n group for more.

Hi Ben,
of course, I'm up for it. -- Should I look about existing action items, or
are there any other special guidelines? And, by the way, can you send me some
additional information about the usual procedure? Thank you in advance :)
Best regards,
Jens.
