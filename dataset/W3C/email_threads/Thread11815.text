I forget what I raised before.
2.3.5 needs wordsmithing - it's just too convoluted.
2.5.2 "removed" should not have a "d" on the end.
2.7.2 I may have mentioned this before: what is a "discussion of the
help system"?
3.2.1 has already been noted as requiring grammatization.
3.4.2 perhaps: "Allow the author access to a text version of any site
maps or other structural representations."
It is very encouraging that *all* of the guidelines and checkpoints are
at a level of abstraction that should account for the tools' use in any
markup situation.
The GLs are not specific to HTML or even to our current conception of
what an "authoring tool" might be. I have no idea if as much can be
said for the WCGLs but I hope they have taken into account that the Web
of 2001 might be very different from that of 1999.
As the "desktop" becomes more or less permanently connected to the
internet we must be ever watchful that our objectives are kept in the
minds of those who design all the "cool" stuff that seems to be coming
right along any day now.

ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE
This has been raised a bunch of times (and is more complex than the
average checkpoint), so here is a proposed wording:
2.3.5
Do not insert place-holder equivalent text, except in cases where
human-authored text has been written for a object whose function is known
with certainty.
techniques:
If an author does not specify equivalent text (including not specifying
that a null equivalent is applicable), do not insert an ALT attribute for
an image. This should then be caught as an accessibility error to be
repaired.
Where an object is part of a standrad library, for which alternatives have
been included, those alternatives may be added. For example, a navigation
bar might have a standard set of icons, with alternative text such as
search, index, site map linked to automatically generated pages.
Checkpoint 2.1.1 should cross-reference this, as well as the section on
checking and repairing.

I think 2.7.2 (Implement applicable accessibility features in any
discussionof the help system) is really about integrating accessibility
into the look and feel - covered by guideline 2.4
Maybe it is a technique for checkpoint 2.4.2, or a checkpoint under that
section.
Any opinions?
I also think that this is one of the areas where the distinction between
section 2 and section 3 is meaningless. I therefore think Ian's proposal
to merge the two sections has merit, and should be revisited.

2.7.2 I may have mentioned this before: what is a "discussion of the

[snip]
I feel the two sections should not be merged. They address two very
distinct principles: 2. generate accessible content and 2. have an
accessible user interface. Even in the sections where there might be a
dubious overlap such as 'integrate help files' and 'allow user
configuration', there are still clear distinctions and merging them would
only muddy the waters and confuse the reader. Integrate help files and
allow user configuration are general software accessibility principles that
we will probably only cover by reference in section 3, so the overlap is a
mute point. 3 does not fit into 2 in any other way. Trying to make 2 more
general to accomodate the principles in 3 would weaken the message.
Jutta
I don't think merging the two would confuse the reader. I think that if
done right it would strengthen the message that accessibility of the tool
and accessibility of the output are parts of making a tool accessible, and
that both things are necessary.
The overlap is primarily in the sections identified by Jutta - 2.6 and
2.7, but it seems to me a clear overlap rather than a dubious one.

I agree with Jutta. I think that the two parts of "making the tool
accessible" are clearly different and any attempt to merge the meaning
does confuse the issue. Obviously the two parts are related and thus
should remain part of the same document, but I have not heard a
convincing reason why anyone would be helped by placing the two
guideline sections into one long list.
