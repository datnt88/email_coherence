The Consumer Product Safety Commission site at http://www.cpsc.gov/ is a
good example for how to do the NOFRAMES on a home page for a site that
uses frames. If the guidelines working group wants examples for the
techniques documentation, this is a site that "gets it."

I think the CPSC.gov site could use a little improvement to serve as a model of
noframes support. It looks to me like they have copied the main frame html
(indexmain.html) into the NOFRAMES element. In doing that they have introduced
the problems of multiple copies of content, because the same content is also
available at their noframes link (indexnof.html), the third copy. Both their
noframes link, and the NOFRAMES content are missing the navigation links that
are on the navigation frame of the framed site.on the left. No doubt they can be
found somewhere in the site, but they are clearly supposed to be highlighted,
and they aren't with their noframes/NOFRAMES.
I suspect it may be necessary to have duplicated content in order to support no
frames versions of "Framed pages." I think it is better to place a link to a no
frames page in the NOFRAME element. For this site, without the navigation links,
I looks like this could just point to indexmain.html, resulting in no repetition
of content. But to include the navigation, no frames page should include both
the main content (at the top) copied from the main page, and the navigation
links at the bottom copied from the navigation frame.
By the way, the FRAME elements do not have titles as recommended by W3C. However
they do have name attributes and name attributes are supported by text browsers
like lynx and HPR, while titles are not.

1) It's not quite the same content. The "index" page *is* different when framed versus non-framed. The non-framed index page - http://www.cpsc.gov/indexnof.html - adds a "Spotlight" link, which points to the same page as the first frame of the original frameset. The first frame - the left-hand frame, for sighted users - is not a "navigation" page; it's a list of recalled products which, while important, isn't necessary for navigation or use of the site itself.
2) They might not have to maintain multiple copies of content. It depends on how they generate their pages. I can find nothing in the source of the pages to indicate that they're not using techniques which allow them to make updates in one place.
I suspect it may be necessary to have duplicated content in order to support no
frames versions of "Framed pages." I think it is better to place a link to a no

the main content (at the top) copied from the main page, and the navigation
links at the bottom copied from the navigation frame.

2) Same comment, about apparent duplication.
3) Having a link to a no frames page in a NOFRAMES element gives me no way to get to the noframes page!
