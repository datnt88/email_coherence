Greg Stein's DAV Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) contains this
interesting (to me) comparison of WebDAV and FTP:
Q. Why should I use DAV instead of FTP?
A. Since DAV works over HTTP, you get all the benefits of HTTP
that FTP cannot provide. For example: strong
authentication, encryption, proxy support, and caching. It is true
that you can get some of this through SSH, but the HTTP
infrastructure is much more widely deployed than SSH. Further, SSH
does not have the wide complement of tools, development libraries,
and applications that HTTP does.
DAV transfers (well, HTTP transfers) are also more efficient than
FTP. You can pipeline multiple transfers through a single TCP
connection, whereas FTP requires a new connection for each file
transferred (plus the control connection).
Recent events prompting heightened concerns about security and the
ever widening distribution of FireWall products certainly support the
assertions about plain vanilla FTP being problematic. As well,
FTP's SSH-enhanced varieties (SFTP, SCP, etc.) are generally beyond
the reach of typical clients although GUI apps currently available
are beginning to tear down that barrier (see:
However, the answer does not address those valuable things that FTP
can do that WebDAV currently cannot do or cannot do well.
Specifically, I refer to the following:
1) WebDAV cannot be programmatically and securely applied to
individual web sites. Currently, creating an account on my MacOS X
Server (Apache) programmatically creates web space whose address
takes the form http://myserver.gcsu.edu/~username and
programmatically enables FTP access to that web space using the un/pw
assigned to the account. This can be done on a large scale with
batch methods.
2) WebDAV does not offer disk space quota enforcement and the means
with which to discover one's usage of that disk space and take
corrective action.
3) WebDAV does not offer password management (neither does FTP but I
mention it here to complete a basic feature list).
Of course, I would like to be wrong about this and I believe that I
am. Apple seems to have accomplished a good measure of what I
describe above with "dotMac" accounts that include WebDAV access via
what it calls an "iDisk." However, the techniques behind this are
not generally and perhaps not even publicly, available.
I would like to extend this kind of functionality to the thousands of
students and hundreds of faculty at my university but apparently
cannot due to the unavailability of critical information n the
techniques employed. Being able to drop support for FTP would
certainly make our networking a security folks happy. Being able to
supplant FTP with WebDAV would likely be viewed as progress by our
clients. Unfortunately, it does not appear to be possible right
now.
Here, again, I hope to be shown the error of my thinking.

Hi Frank,
I'll try to answer your questions about WebDAV vs. FTP:
I'm not sure what you're asking here. Are you asking from an
implementor/administrator point of view, whether a server can be implemented
that supports WebDAV and securely supports individual Web sites? If that's
the question, then Sharemation is an existence proof that this can be easily
done. The site www.sharemation.com hosts individual web sites for many
thousands of accounts. Although there's a Web interface to allow users to
sign up, after registration users can manage their sites with WebDAV. Many
universities are now starting to provide WebDAV-enabled individual sites to
students with this technology, but instead of allowing free signup as
Sharemation does, these universities use batch methods to create thousands
of accounts each semester as new students arrive. There is no FTP access to
these accounts because it's no longer needed.
Or are you asking whether WebDAV can be used by a client program to manage a
Web site remotely and automatically? Sitecopy and GoLive are client
programs that do this.
A WebDAV server implementation can offer disk space quota enforcement, as
Apple iDisk and Xythos WFS do. This must be managed by the administrator of
course. It's true that it's difficult to discover one's usage of that disk
space however there is a HTTP error commonly used when that quota is reached
("Insufficient Storage"). Furthermore, we're working on an extension to
WebDAV to provide quota-related properties so that an individual user may
discover their quota and storage usage.
Are you sure that FTP offers this functionality anyway? I didn't think that
was part of the FTP standard. I would think the user would have to type in
Unix queries and understand the answer themselves, rather than be able to
use a GUI client that is capable of parsing the quota information and issue
warnings.
Typically password management is not part of an application protocol -- as
you point out, it's not part of FTP (nor is it part of IMAP, etc)
Instead, typically password management is an administrative function, which
means that it can either be done through an administration UI (not through
the application protocol) or through LDAP. WebDAV can work with LDAP: e.g.
an administrator can create LDAP accounts and set passwords, then when users
try to log into the WebDAV server the WebDAV server queries the LDAP server
to see if the login should be allowed. A number of universities are also
doing this already. I can provide you with more details if you're
interested.
Good questions!

What I hope to do is provide WebDAV-enabled sites to thousands of
students and hundreds of faculty at our university on a very limited
budget and without obsoleting investments already made, to wit:
o several XServe units running the latest MacOS X Server software
(10.2.6) with includes the Apache webserver with mod_dav precompiled.
See: http://www.apple.com/macosx/server/
o several MacOS X towers running the latest WebSTAR V Server Suite
(5.3.x). NOTE: WebSTAR V supports WebDAV with a very elaborate
security model that is great for many people working on a single web
site -- the conventional application of WebDAV. See:
I would like to be able to provide individual web site accounts
programmatically in batched and on-demand formats using a GUI front
end not unlike what is available to MacOS X Server and WebSTAR V
Server Admins.
That this is possible is difficult to deny. I now have several
existence proofs as follows:
1) Sharemation (see: http://www.sharemation.com)
2) Apple's iDisk (part of dotMac) (see: http://www.mac.com/)
3) WebCT 3.8 and WebCT Vista (see http://www.webct.com)
NOTE: WebCT Vista uses the BEA WebLogic server. WebCT is a
Courseware Management System (CMS) widely used in higher education.
WebCT Vista has been adopted system-wide in Georgia's University
System. Interestingly, I see no mention of this at www.webdav.org in
the way of an announcement.
FTP Servers offer this functionality. Two examples include Rumpus
(http://www.maxum.com) and the FTP client bundled with the WebSTAR V
Server Suite (see http://www.webstar.com).
Clients will report the soft limit and hard limit warning messages
issued by these FTP servers.
From the client perspective, such functionality is needed in a way
that **appears** to be integrated with the editing experience is
desirable.
Admins need to be able to set pw criteria (# chars, composition, even
checking pw history in a database) and enforce a pw change schedule.
On the client side, users need to have the means with which to easily
comply with these requirements/policies - a pw changing interface.
Again, we seek only the **appearance** of integration from the
client's perspective.

If your WebDAV server integrates with your directory service (LDAP,
ActiveDirectory,
NetInfo, YP, etc.), then these accounts would appear as soon as the
user's account
is created in the directory. I do know of vendors that produce such
servers ;).
FYI: http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-webdav-quota-01.txt
Again, directory service integration would give you what you want.
When the
user changes their password using their standard password change
mechanism,
that password change goes into the directory, which of course the server
will pick up immediately.
