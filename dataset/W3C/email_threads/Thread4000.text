This is simply a vote for Issue 143 in Functions and Operators: a
tokenize function is badly needed in XSLT.
In particular: As far as I can see, there is no other way to deal with
space delimited content (? la XML Schema list types) in the absence of a
schema.

I agree we do need the ability to tokenize a string. I'm working on a
proposal for regular expression handling (it's now on its third iteration)
which will meet this requirement, although it might be a little heavyweight
for simple splitting of a space-delimited string. We could look at providing
a convenience function to make easy cases easy.

Hi Michael,
Great! Regexp matching/replacing could be useful.
I would love a convenience function, though (preferably working as
java's StringTokenizer does by default). Regexps inside xpaths inside
xml might become a bit hairy, syntax wise...
