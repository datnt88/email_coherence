I won't be able to join the AUWG call on Monday, March 15.
Cheers,
Jan
Nor will I. Thanks Tim Boland NIST
Well, if you two aren't going, then neither will I!
(Actually, I'm going to be at a conference on Monday. I propose we
postpone to the 22nd.)

I'm sure Jutta and I can meet Monday and agree on the right delegation of
all tasks!! ;-)
The 22nd is fine with me, if the meeting gets moved.
