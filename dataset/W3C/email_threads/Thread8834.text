Here are just a few comments for your Last Call "XML-Signature
Syntax and Processing" Working Draft [1].
Globally, Base64, base 64, and base-64 can read "base64" (no cap).
"Canonical XML" needn't be capitalized unless it refers to the
Canonical XML spec, and "canonicalization" can also be lowercase.
Also globally, "transform"(s) can be lowercase unless it refers
to a Transform(s) element (in which case you have it marked up
code ). Same for "signature."
4.3.3.2 pars. 6, 7 and 8
URI-Reference - URI reference (four times)
4.3.3.4 par. 4
MimeType, Charset - MIME type, charset
or code MimeType /code , charset
6.5 par. 3
We RECOMMENDED - We RECOMMEND
(I didn't understand why it was past tense that time.)
6.6.2 last par.
element strike class="fix" s /strike - element
6.6.5
stylesheet - style sheet (three times)
7.0 last par.
Normalized Form C - Normalization Form C
In References, all the RFCs could be listed the same way. I don't
know the preferred way yet, and used commas and the space between
RFC and 2119 in this example:
RFC 2119, Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels,
S. Bradner, March 1997.
4.3.3.4 par. 5
domain.Transform - domain. Transform

Hi Susan, thanks for your comments.
Ok. Fixed the one remaining base-64. In english text moved Base64 to lower
case, retained lower case in URIs.
All instances I found refer to spec.
fixed one instance of that.
Fixed about ~6 of Transform; one of signature, otherwise XML Signature is
retained.
That is a purposeful term used from section 4 of
ok.
ok.
ok.
uses "stylesheet" ? but when I speak in general I seperated them.
I believe it is Normalized Form C.
Could you provide a citation that this is the proper way? Regardless, Don
did the RFCs and I think they are consistent amongst themselves, though not
with other references.
ok.
Thank you!

If you search that page for "Normalization Form C" you'll get about
19 hits (and zero for "Normalized Form C").
As I mentioned I don't know the preferred way yet. It would be nice
if the spacing (RFC 2119 - RFC2119) and punctuation matched but this
is not a big deal.
Thank you for the very prompt response.

Right you are!
Ok, I fixed the spacing.
