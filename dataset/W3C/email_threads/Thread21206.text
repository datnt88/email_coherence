the following short file passes thru both w3.org and WDG validators
however Amaya 8.1a signals an error because of the omission
of a space after the quote mark.... is this
1] a bug in the Amaya parser
2] a bug in the w3.org and wdg parsers
3] a grey area in the XHTML recommendation where the requirement
for spacing is vague.... tokenizers have no difficulty recognizing
end/begin of these tokens and normal convention is to disregard
spacing except where absolutely required for correct tokenization.

This fragment is indeed not well-formed, there must be whitespace before
"alt", cf. http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml#NT-STag and
http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml#NT-EmptyElemTag . The W3C validator has some
limitations concerning XML, cf. http://openjade.sourceforge.net/doc/xml.htm ,
so it's probably a bad idea to use it for XHTML validation. XML schema
validators work much better, e.g. try
http://www.w3.org/2001/03/webdata/xsv?docAddrs=http://www.example.org/+http://www.w3.org/2002/08/xhtml/xhtml1-strict.xsd&amp;style=offline .
Additional XHTML schemas are available at http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1-schema/ .
