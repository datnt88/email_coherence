Hi.
As RFC3253 already talks about bindings, shouldn't the BIND spec be
labelled as "updating RFC3253"? The benefit being that a reader of
RFC3253 using the RFC Index could actually find out that there's an
additional document that may help understanding RFC3253.
Julian
I agree that some reference to RFC3253 would be useful (e.g. something
like "this provides a detailed description of the binding model that
is implicit in RFC3253"), but I wouldn't say that it "updates" RFC3253,
since it doesn't change anything in RFC3253.
Cheers,
Geoff

Well, "updates" is the only type of link we *can* use (nothing else
would create a forward reference in the RFC Index).
Besides, I'd say that it in fact "updates" RFC3253, because it updates
RFC2518's descriptions for MOVE, COPY, DELETE etc in presence of
multiple bindings. Thus, it indeed updates both RFC2518 and RFC3253.

In general, I don't see much of a problem with indicating that a spec
like this "updates" a previous document even if the document doesn't
change specific items in the previous document. Speaking personally,
when I see "updates", I take it as "read both". The contrast is, obviously,
with "supersedes" which implies one can/should read only the second
document.
Just my take on it,

Ted Hardie
And "read both" is what I'd really like to express. Geoff?
However, looking at
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-rfc-editor-rfc2223bis-07.txt ,
section 2.11:
Updates
Specifies an earlier document whose contents are modified or
augmented by the new document. The new document cannot be
used alone, it can only be used in conjunction with the
earlier document.
So maybe we need to leave it as is...
Regards,
Julian
Why doesn't "augmented" cover this case? My reading of the text above is
that "it can only be used in conjunction with the earlier document" _for_the_
areas_of_overlap. That is, you can update RFC XXXX and still have
material that is stand alone that is not overlapping with RFC XXXX.
Ted
Well, that would make sense, but in that case maybe
draft-rfc-editor-rfc2223bis should be clarified...
Regards, Julian
In the context of that statement in RFC2223bis, I think
we're best off just saying that the BIND document updates 2518,
and not 3253. It just isn't the case that the BIND document
"can only be used in conjunction with" 3253, while this is the
case for 2518. In addition, there really is no pressing need
to get a connection between BIND and 3253.

I think RFC2223bis is plain wrong here and needs to be fixed. For
instance, RFC2396 (URI) "updates" previous URL specs that in fact not
only contained URL syntax, but also specific schemes such as "ftp".
However, RFC2396 clearly can be used without the documents it's updating.
Hm. As RFC3253 speaks of bindings, and also introduces operations that
create additional bindings to the same resource, I'd think that it makes
a lot of sense to have that link...
Regards, Julian
I raised the issue on the ietf-discuss mailing list
( http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/ietf/Current/msg23697.html ) and
consensus seems to be that "updates" can be used even if the new
document does not *require* the previous document (such as in RFC2396
updating the URI syntax without repeating definitions of specific URI
schemes such as "ftp").
