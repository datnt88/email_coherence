Subject: QUESTION: image map ALT tagsthis again comes from advhtml but
since it concerns us here I thought I'd post it for the gentleman.
hey there-
I am having problems getting the ALT text to appear on my
image
maps. The image map works as it is suppossed to (all links are good
and
functional) but the alt text will not appear. I have always had this
problem and have simply assumed it is not possible.
I am an intermediate user, meaning i can write almost
anything
you could want in HTML but my scripting skills are only now being
learned. The server I am running the page on is Apache (unix). I
work
from a windows 95 OS or linux redhat (pico editor) depending on where
I
happen to be when I sit dow to write.
the URL to my home page is:
the URL to the specific imagemap in question is:
any advise anyone could render would be greatly appreciated, thanks

Sallow,
you're not using what is usually called an imagemap, you are using a table of
individual images which may be links. In many cases there is no alt text,
which is a pain.
A number of browsers which should have known better have patchy support for
alt on real imagemaps. Your problem (apart from having lots of images with no
alt at all) is probably related to the way alt is rendered by some of those
browsers - typically it is only somtimes put into the space where an image
would be, depending on the amount of space it has allocated. Other browsers
don't have any trouble. I'm afraid there is not a lot you can do in your code
except to leave sizes unspecified for your images - they should appear
unspaced, and you can use basic CSS features such as line-height, together
with presentational hacking such as VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0" to achieve the same
effect without a table, and to have more browsers render the alt text.
(I suggest alt="" for the cases where you don't want "imagemap_r3_c1" to be
rendered everywhere...)

Just one small point .. using alt="" is something I consider an annoyance!
It gets the page past automated checks like Bobby but leaves the user
wondering what they are missing. If you use an alt= please put something in
between the "", even if it only says alt="space".

Where there is no purpose to the image, having to read the fact that they are
there is a real nusciance - particularly for people who are unable to use
images (people who are blind, etc). If an author has provided correct alt
text then it is not so difficult to assume that when they have nothing as
their explicit text it is because they explicitly meant to say nothing.
If you use alt="" to cover up the fact that you haven't bothered to make
something work without images then you deserve to get flamed.
Putting a long description onto images might also be a good practise to help
people believe that you know what you are doing.

Your opinion is one train of thought and it should be so stated . However,
I've heard this discussion a million times over -- I'm not convinced there's
a conclusive answer to the alt=" " question at this point in web evolution.
Many blind people feel it's important to have a complete understanding of
the interface and environment they are working within. Others do not. To
assume otherwise is a big mistake. What might appear to be a nusciane to
you, may be important to someone else. Particularly to a blind person. What
not conduct a usability test to establish the data?
