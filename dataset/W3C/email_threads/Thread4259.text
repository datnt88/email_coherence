The data model draft describes a number of accessors,
most of which appear in F&amp;O. But I don't see a type
accessor. I see I can get the typed value, and I
guess I could use instanceof to test to see if it's a
specific type, but what if I want the type name as a
QName? It seems like that would be a useful function.
Any reason it was omitted?
Thanks,
John

Thank you for your question. The WG discussed this and decided that
it was enough to have a instance-of function and that a type accessor
was not needed.
All the best, Ashok

That's rather unfortunate. It is very limiting when constructing
reusable components to encounter systems which do not allow for the
nature/type of an element/variable/data memeber to be variant. This
invariably ends up being a short-sighted attitude.

We need to solve this problem in any case. The Schema WG
has started to discuss the NuNs question again and I'm hoping
there will be a proposal soon.

One problem with an xf:type accessor is that not every type has a unique
name - there are anonymous types that have no name, and local element
and
attribute declarations whose names may be identical to other element and
attribute declarations.
One way of solving this would be to create a universal naming schema for
all types that can occur, but this was deemed too complex for XPath and
XQuery 1.0.

Ashok,
As you know, I've been a proponent of NUNs since before they existed, and I
hope we do come up with a universal naming scheme that is as simple as
possible.
In my opinion, once that naming scheme exists, xf:type makes a lot of
sense, but it doesn't make sense before that time. And this is something
the W3C XML Schema WG should do, not XML Query.
