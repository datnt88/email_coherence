Hi ,
Am not too sure abt the implications of the eolas verdicy.
Would it be possible for someone to guide me to a detailed report of the
same or implications which may have been listed.

Hello all,
Will the verdict affect how Mozilla/Netscape and other browsers perform
plugins? From my stand point, my organization does not have a lot of
pages that invest in plugins, but never the less, this does seem like
developers like myself are caught in the middle and have to do a wait
and see game now. Is this a correct assumption? Please advise.

What abt plug-ins implementing XForms ..
Has anyone come across applications which are solely functioning as XForms
clients ..(not using browser to host services)

1) What specific changes are contemplated?
2) Will browser upgrades be gradual (typical 1%/month adoption of new
browser model) or more rapid?
From W3 page:
In the near term, Microsoft has indicated to W3C that they will very soon be
making changes to its Internet Explorer browser software in response to this
ruling. These changes may affect a large number of existing Web pages. ...
There was widespread agreement that a solution that minimizes the effects of
changes to Web software, Web sites and the user experience was needed.
Microsoft presented several options that it has under consideration, and
benefited from constructive discussion of these options.

At least X-Smiles comes to mind that does XForms as a mixed namespaces client.
XForms integration with SVG, without requiring a plugin, should also be a lot
easier in SVG 1.2.

Most web sites are designed to work in Internet Explorer, for the simple
reason that roughly 95% of the browsing public uses it. As such, developers
of alternative browsers are virtually forced to make their software
compatible with whatever works with IE. Any other approach simply breaks
too many pages. Therefore, you can bet the bank that whatever solution is
implemented in IE will eventually be compatible with some future version of
Netscape, Opera, etc.
I applaud MS for working directly with W3C on a solution. Internet Explorer
has long been known for leaving a trail of pseudo-standards in its
development path, and the W3C has then chosen which to adopt as "standard".
If MS, W3C, and other attendees at that meeting can come up with a valid
solution and establish it as a standard, this will do wonders for the
alternative browser market's ability to keep up. Plugin compatibility has
been one of the hardest aspects to maintain across various browsers.
My company's web site does not currently use any plugins, but we are in the
process of developing some new interactive Java applets. I am most curious
about how this verdict and the coming changes will affect applets.
Aside: I think it's ridiculous that someone can claim patent rights on
embedded content this late in the game.
