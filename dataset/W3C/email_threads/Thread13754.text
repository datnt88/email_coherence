I would argue that each image should have alternative text that *provides*
the function of the graphic. The difference here is subtle, but I think
it's an important distinction. Describing the function would mean ALT
text like ALT="decoration", but alternative text like this gives
unnecessary clutter to text-only users and search engines. If the ALT
text were actually *giving* the function of the image, ALT="" would be the
natural function of a purely decorative image.

don't see a point to the existence of an ALT attribute with APPLET. Since
alternate content including markup can be provided as the content of the

content within the APPLET element also provides backwards compatibility
with any browsers (or search engines) that do not recognize APPLET.

This message, along with Daniel's interpretation of the use of TITLE and ALT
raises the issue of clear standardization.
To me, ALT is always a textual description of the image ("ALTernative
representation"). TITLE is related to function.
It's a shame that with AREA the guidelines have already converted the
original meaning of ALT into a more functional role, this is exactly what
TITLE was intended for. IE4 does not recognize ALT on AREA, but does
recognize TITLE.
The problems arise with image only links. Where does TITLE go? I say as
part of the A tag, since the *function* of the image is where it's
directing you to (the link).
For example:
Regardless of whether or not you think the above example is correct, the
Guidelines (and the HTML specification) should clarify the correct usage of
ALT and TITLE (and LONGDESC).

ALT
To me, it's exactly the opposite. ALT is ALTernative text, and so should
act as a complete alternative to the image. A description of the image is
a supplement, not an alternative. An alternative is something that takes
the place of something else, and so the ALT text should replace the image.
Again, I take the opposite view. Do you have a source that describes the
"original meaning of ALT"? I've never found the W3C Recommendations
adequate in their description of ALT.
The IMG can have a TITLE describing the graphic, and the A can have a
TITLE describing the link. Note that TITLE with elements like A is
*descriptive* rather than *functional*. The link itself gives the
function implicitly.
I'd go with
A HREF=foo.htm TITLE="Enter my world" IMG SRC=globe.gif ALT="Enter my
world" TITLE="Spinning globe" /A
Think about how today's text-only browsers would present this:
_Enter my world_
rather than
_Spinning Globe picture_
Using ALT functionally provides the necessary information for text-only
browsers, while using it descriptively provides a cruel reminder to the
text-only user that the Web doesn't like him.
Of course one could argue that text-only browsers have the implementation
backwards if you agree with Chuck's interpretation of ALT and TITLE.
Clearly we need to decide which is which. To me, the words suggest the
meaning I have described, but I recognize that others interpret this
differently. So what about looking at the issue from the point of view of
existing implementations? Text-only browsers and search engines use the
ALT attribute as a replacement for the IMG; I assume speech browsers do
the same. Since text-only browsers and speech browsers are the most
important targets of browser accessibility, perhaps we should yield to
these existing implementations.

I'd like to call out a specific portion of this issue:

text-only user that the Web doesn't like him.

ALT and TITLE are pigeon holes for information. The meaning of these
placeholders should not be distorted because of the way current browsers
present the information.
With advances such as Active Accessibility, Dynamic HTML and the Document
Object Model, it's much more important to make sure the *conduits* for
information (attributes) exist and are not redundant and are very clearly
defined.
Just because a certain browser presents the ALT attribute in a certain way
doesn't mean we should distort the meaning of ALT to fit.
It's hard enough to get people to use ALT as is. If there is even the
slightest doubt as to it's correct usage, it'll be hard to get implemented.
ALT/TITLE/LONGDESC have to be clearly defined.
I agree with Liam's interpretation. To simplify the matter, I would
suggest that the TITLE attribute should not be used in connection with
IMG. Use ALT to provide a genuine substitute for the image which conveys
the informational content of the image, or, if associated with a long
description, gives it an identifying label so that the reader can decide
whether to access the resource referred to by the LONGDESC attribute.
TITLE on anchor elements is perfectly acceptable, and indeed the HTML 4.0
specification clearly demarcates its role as providing the title of the
resource to which the link refers. It is an "advisory" title in the sense
that it is displayed prior to the actual retrieval of the information
designated by the link.
I strongly disagree with this interpretation of ALT. Every book I have on
HTML specifies that ALT is a description of the image. The HTML 4.0
specification says that TITLE is "advisory information."
Are we now reversing that? Are we going to say "Use TITLE as functional
information EXCEPT when there is a image and then use it as a description of
the image?"
So for a textual link it would go like this:
Click here
but for a image link it would be:
That's making exceptions in the meaning of TITLE. In my view it should be:
I look at the above examples and think it's clear why there is a separation
between ALT and TITLE. For starters, in this case, the image *object* has
no functional meaning. It's the anchor surrounding it which gives it
functional meaning and as such the TITLE indicates that. Just like it would
for non-image links.
The whole reason TITLE was invented was to supplement existing attributes,
not to replace them.
Changing the meaning of ALT now is likely to kill the gains we've made in
getting it accepted.

And as you know, I strongly disagree with your interpretation :)
A lot of HTML books have mistakes in them. The fact that the W3C
Recommendations have never been clear on ALT increases the likelihood of
misinterpretation.
of
No. What I'm saying is use TITLE as descriptive information in all cases.
When you use TITLE with A elements, you're describing the link, not
providing the function of the link (since the function--more information--
is implicit in the link itself). Using TITLE to describe an IMG makes it
consistent with other uses of TITLE.
page"
I don't see the exception. In your example the TITLE of the IMG describes
the graphic and the TITLE of the A describes the link. It seems perfectly
consistent and natural.
Why does a text-only user *need* (ALT being required) to know that there
is a picture of the world? How does that help, when the point of the
image is as an entrance to another page? If I saw or heard "picture of
the world", what would I expect to find upon following the link? Probably
a JPEG or GIF of the world.
The ALT attribute is required on IMG because the function of the image is
vital to text-only users. What the image looks like may be of interest to
some text-only users, so we have the TITLE and LONGDESC attributes, which
are optional. If TITLE were to give the all-important function of the
image, it should be required in HTML 4.0.
separation
has
The function of an image is context-sensitive, so the fact that the
image's pixels are not functional on their own does not mean that the IMG
element--as used in the document--has no function.
So you're using TITLE on A to describe the function of the IMG? That
seems counter-intuitive. TITLE on A should describe the link, and should
be independent of the image or text that anchors the link.
attributes,
TITLE is not replacing ALT. ALT always was, to me (and I assumed others),
used to give the function of the image, since this is what is useful to
the person not loading images. TITLE provides the long-desired ability to
describe the image, especially useful for those using graphical browsers
with image loading disabled.
The meaning of ALT as I've always understood, and as documented for years
at http://ppewww.ph.gla.ac.uk/%7Eflavell/alt/alt-text.html , is to
provide a replacement for browsers not loading images.

Irrespective of the fact that the "meaning of the placeholders" is not,

Again, there is no distortion AFAICS. ALTernative means "replacement".
True. And for those who _do_ use it, there's no surer way to discourage
them from doing so in the future than to arbitrarily alter the meaning,
which would require... thousands? hundreds of thousands? of pages of
current content to be redesigned to fit the new meaning.
