and generally: the _n arcs of a bag can be permuted.
That doesn't work. If it entails that, then it must also entail:
_:b rdf:type rdf:Bag.
_:b rdf:_1 "abc".
_:b rdf:_2 "def".
_:b rdf:_2 "abc".
_:b rdf:_1 "def".
so just saying 'can be permuted' isn't enough.
oops! hmm...

I had assumed that:
aaa rdf:type rdf:Bag .
aaa rdf:_NNN bbb .
aaa rdf:_MMM ccc .
=
aaa rdf:_MMM bbb .
where aaa is a bNode or URI and bbb, ccc are anything.
(This means that a bag with n members licenses n^2 edges ).

I don't think that works. Consider a bag {* "aaa" "bbb" "bbb" *}
The 3^2=9 edges would be:
aaa rdf:_1 "aaa" .
aaa rdf:_1 "bbb" .
aaa rdf:_1 "bbb" .
aaa rdf:_2 "aaa" .
aaa rdf:_2 "bbb" .
aaa rdf:_2 "bbb" .
aaa rdf:_3 "aaa" .
aaa rdf:_3 "bbb" .
aaa rdf:_3 "bbb" .
But, on removing duplicates, which the MT tells us are redundant:
aaa rdf:_1 "aaa" .
aaa rdf:_1 "bbb" .
aaa rdf:_2 "aaa" .
aaa rdf:_2 "bbb" .
aaa rdf:_3 "aaa" .
aaa rdf:_3 "bbb" .
Now does that bag contain 2 "aaa"s and 1 "bbb", or 1 "aaa" and 2 "bbb"s, or
something else?

Ah. OK, that would work, as long as one doesn't think that
aaa rdf:_NNN bbb .
aaa rdf:_NNN ccc .
is a contradiction. However, the other problem remains, that there
seems to be no way to distinguish a bag from a set. For example, if
the bag [aaa aaa bbb] has both aaa and bbb in every position, then
how does it differ from the bag [aaa bbb] ? They both have bbb in the
second place.
