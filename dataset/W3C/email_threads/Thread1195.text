Hello... I built my site's web page using Mozilla's page editor. I
didn't realize until recently what a mess it had made of the pages;
nested styles all over the place... I tried running html-tidy on it,
with the option to join styles, but the result is still an awful mess.

version so that I'll be able to clean things up better. (You might also

Hi,
We try to normalize types of styles and put them in an external style sheet. I can see that this is not happening at all on your site.

but I still haven figured out how to run the php one standalone.
thanks !

Did you use -clean? --join-styles is for elements with multiple style
attributes like p style=a style=b ... (which is illegal).
Do you mean the tidy PHP extension?
