This arises from the I18N debate, but is a distinct issue which I think is
important to be clear about.
(Not knowing my way around the test cases...)
What graph does this denote?
I think it should be:
_:a eg:prop "foo  bar" .
but others (including the W3C RDF validator service) seem to think differently.
My rationale is:
- RDF/XML syntax is based on infoset
- creation of infoset from textual XML input replaces entities, so ''
becomes ' '
- RDF/XML syntax specification (as I recall) does not specify that ' ' in
literals is mapped back to ''
Am I wrong?

I agree.
I don't think so (but then, I could be wrong too ;-)

The validator is confused.
If you ask it for n-triples, it gives the correct answer, but it presumably
doubly escapes by default.
