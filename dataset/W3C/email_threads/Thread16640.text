Can anyone on the list help with this discussion? thanks in advance.
No..actually this still doesn't clarify it for me..I read that info
online, too...which at least helped me to guess that 1.4 referred to
syncying. But what I still don't understand..text equivalents INCLUDE
auditory descriptions...SO how does including auditory descriptions help
when the priority states that some user agents can't read them
automatically? And what are they referring to when they talk about text
equivalents if not auditory descriptions? And if user agents don't
automatically read them, how does adding additional text equivalents
solve anything? And Why would you need an additional priority to tell you
that these auditory descriptions need to be in sync?
In my mind, 1.3 is still trying to say something different..and I don't
really know what...

1.3 Until user agents can automatically read aloud the text equivalent of a
visual track, provide an auditory description of the important information
of the visual track of a multimedia presentation. [Priority 1]
Synchronize the auditory description with the audio track as per checkpoint
1.4. Refer to checkpoint 1.1 for information about textual equivalents for
visual information.
Techniques for checkpoint 1.3
1.4 For any time-based multimedia presentation (e.g., a movie or
animation), synchronize equivalent alternatives (e.g., captions or auditory
descriptions of the visual track) with the presentation. [Priority 1]
Techniques for checkpoint 1.4
this helped clarify for me. as you mentioned, why wouldn't you
synchronize...seems like some
browsers/screen readers may not be able to automatically read these
synchronized descriptions.

Dear Alice,
Your message prompted me to notice that the WCAG glossary does not define
either "auditory description" nor "textual equivalents". Clearly this is an
oversight.
Textual equivalent (in the context of this discussion) means the transcript
of an audio (or video) presentation. In many cases, especially dramatic
presentations, textual equivalence is more than just the words which are
spoken, and does need to be fairly descriptive. The term "audio
description" is something quite different, has nothing to do with text, and
has a specific meaning.
Audio description is a technique of incorporating additional spoken
narrative on a movie's sound track. By definition then, audio description
IS in time with the presentation, so keeping it synchronized is NOT an
issue. For a web example, you might take a look at URL:
http://main.wgbh.org/wgbh/access/dvs/dvsclip.html (which also includes the
textual equivalent).
Checkpoint 1.3 reads as it does because there is still no technology would
allow text (in any form) to be exposed to a screen reader in time with a
multimedia presentation. Since there is not a way for an end user to create
dynamic audio description (using speech synthesis and a textual equivalent),
1.3 is basically a requirement for content providers to offer a sound track
incorporating audio description whenever they post multimedia.
Checkpoint 1.4 refers really just to captioning -- since audio description
is synced. (Although, I guess, it would be theoretically possible NOT to be
synchronized -- but that would be MORE work! There are plenty of examples
of bad or poorly done audio description. But, just as there are plenty of
example of badly done web pages, that is not a WCAG checkpoint violation!)
Cheers,
Bruce Bailey
There is a description of text (and non-text) equivalents with examples in the WCAG glossary under "equivalent" and my screen reader at least tells me there is a "definition of text equivalent"

My apologies! I am quite pleased that I was wrong about this important
information being missed!
The term "auditory description" is in that same block of text that Steve
cited:
The in-line link to the definition first appears in the last paragraph (next
to last sentence) of the "Introduction" section:
