aloha, ian!
first off, thank you for accomodating my request for a brief review so that a concrete proposal could be considered by the WG...
second, i think your proposed clarifications are excellent, and that they adequately address the issues which were raised during today's telecon... moreover, i agree that while the checkpoint should not impose a minimal granularity requirement for either serial or direct access, a user agent SHOULD provide a combination of both functionalities to provide rapid access...
thank you, yet again, for facilitating synthesis,
gregory.

Hello,
Provision one of checkpoint 4.5 in the 31 July draft [1] reads:
1. Allow the user to stop, pause, resume, fast advance, and fast
reverse rendered audio and animations (including video and
animated images) that last three or more seconds at their
default playback rate.
At today's teleconf [2], we discussed whether "fast advance" and
"fast reverse" implied that to get from time 1 to time 2 in a
presentation, the advance/reverse functionality had to scan every
intervening point (like a physical cassette tape).
Please consider the following proposal.

Proposal
1) Rapid access to (time) moments in audio and animation
content is the essential navigation requirement.
2) Serial access (e.g., "Go from where I currently
am back as long as I hold the reverse button down, in
increments of ten seconds.") is a sufficient approach
to satisfying this requirement. Provisions 3. and 4.
are only relevant to serial access mode.
3) Direct access (e.g., "Go directly to the 5-minute mark")
is a sufficient approach to satisfying this requirement.
4) The user agent SHOULD provide a combination of both
of these functionalities for rapid access.
5) The checkpoint should say nothing about the granularity
of serial or direct access.
The following proposal clarifies provisions 1, 3, and 4
accordingly. Provisions 2 and 5 remain unchanged.
1. Allow the user to stop, pause, and resume audio and
animations (including video and animated images) that last
three or more seconds at their default playback rate.
X. Allow the user to navigate efficiently (forward and
backward) within the same audio and animation content. The user
agent may satisfy this requirement through sequential or direct
access techniques. Sequential access techniques include, for
example, rewind in various time increments, forward to the next
audio track, etc. Direct access techniques include access to
video track number 7, to the 10-minute mark, etc.
Y. When serial techniques are used to satisfy the previous
requirement, the user agent is not required to play back
content during advance or rewind (though doing so may help
orient the user). For example, the user agent is not required
to play an animation at double speed during a continuous fast
forward. Similarly, the user agent is not required to play
back synchronized content during advance or rewind (e.g., an
audio track synchronized with a video track).
Note: The user agent should allow efficient navigation of audio
and animation content through a combination of serial and
direct access techniques, such as direct access to a chosen
audio track, then serial access within that track (e.g., slow
forward at first, then faster as the user continues to press a
button).
Comments:
1) "Navigate efficiently" is an expression used in provision 1 of
checkpoint 9.9:
"Allow the user to navigate efficiently to and among
important structural elements in rendered content."
2) Previous versions of this checkpoint did not specify
a granularity for fast advance/reverse (e.g., whether
increments should be less than one second for precision
video playback, one second, 5 seconds, etc.). This version
of the checkpoint imposes no minimal granularity requirement.
3) Neither the old nor the new version of the checkpoint
requires playback of content during fast forward or rewind.

Because of our desire to request to advance to
CR tomorrow, please send all comments on this proposal
by 9am ET 31 August 2001. I apologize for the short
review period, but this is intended to be an editorial
clarification. The document can be revised after we
go to CR since this is editorial in nature.
Thank you,
- Ian

we talk about time here but are there not other markers other than time
such as bookmark or other cues such as track separation? I am not
certain that we are interested in having a limit on jumps in sequencial
motion. It seems that the check point can make it on its own with a
clarifying note or techniques. The idea is to have means of time
independant interaction that will provide the widest accessibility.
Some will need to be able to go to a particular point or pick from among
points to which to go such as titles or scenes etc. Some will need to
use sequential motion such as what is commonly referred to as fast
forward and rewind in order to scan the media content in order to find
their place. In the latter instance, one fixed fast rate in any
direction should be enough. I think there may be something in the daisy
speck on this.
I would uphold not requiring that the content be presented at the faster
rate because merely
returning to normal activity for a brief period can provide sufficient
information on which to base a decision whether or not to continue the
motion. Even in digital motion, there can be a rewind feature similar
to a cassette. The idea of any sort of incramental other than content
jump, produces the need to back or forward track from a point to a point
which was missed more so than a non jumping motion such as that employed
in cassettes. In the digital world, sequential is the same as in the
cassette world except you don't have feet and inches in addition to
time. you do however have other features that could be made available.
I am thinking of a cd in which I press a button that begins scanning
within a track and auditorily, it sounds like I am running a cassette at
fast forward or rewind but the pitch is lowered and I can hear the sound
although garbled. I would like this feature even if it were silent.
