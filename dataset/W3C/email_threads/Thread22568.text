Hi,
I am a newbie to XML-DOM. I have a peculiar problem in appending XML tags.
I am using Perl to work with XML. The Contents of the XML file is as
follows.
I keyed in the above data in a file. Now how to actually create such tags
with values using perl scripts. I tried with
$Node = $Doc- getElementsbyTagName("XML_File")- item(0);
$DataNode = $Doc- createElement("Data")
$Node- appendChild($DataNode);
Now the above code is working and it created a instance of Data /Data .
But how to actually create tags under Data . I mean if i say
getElementsbyTagName("Data"), Then i will get an multiple instance of
Data .I don't want to say getElementsbyTagName("Data")- item(0) b'coz
it would be very static. I want the DOM Parser to identify the last Data
instance that is created and it should return me so that i can do
createElements under it.
Any suggestions/help would be great.
Thanks

If you want information about the DOM architecture, without referring to a
particular implementation or language, you can find it at
Unfortunately, Perl is not one of the languages for which the DOM spec
provides a standardized binding. But the principles should be the same. For
questions about a specific implementation, your best bet is to contact that
implementation's authors.
To add contents to an existing node, create the additional nodes as
needed and use the appendChild() and/or insertBefore() operations to put
them in the desired places in the DOM tree.
To find the last instance of a nodename... The simplest approach is to use
getElementsByTagName and get the last element of the resulting NodeList.
But that will involve walking the entire document, so I would instead
recommend that you develop a more intelligent search scheme which takes
advantage of knowledge about the structure of your documents.
