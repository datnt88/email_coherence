I'd love to see us flesh out section 3.8 on structured references at
some point -- but at least the hooks are there for doing what it says
in our charter (section 1.4) so I can live with this for now, as
long as we make sure to come back and some time and work on this.
Also, I suspect the "document reference" should be a URI, not a URL,
that is could also point to other kinds of resources than text
documents -- I can imagine businesses that want to use URNs to point
to non-web resources, URIs (with the fragids included) to point to
parts of documents, etc.

You are right, this part of the spec is under-developed. Both Nick and I
realized that the importance of this part of the spec, but also realized
that we were not the real experts in this area, so if you want to make some
more concrete suggestions then please do ...

Nick and David,
Here are my first comments after a quick reading of your document (listed by line numbers).
75:
This seems to imply that all messages handles by the choreography are SOAP, which I don't think was the intent.
152-154:
WSDL port types are mentioned as example of physical structure, which is confusing since they are, according to WSDL, abstract ports.
196:
The table lists the "Message Structure" and "Technology used" entries for Portable as "Defined". These entry names could be understood as aspects that are actually defined only at the Concrete level.
324:
"Import" is a concept used in XML Schema, WSDL and BPEL. In all those cases its semantics is associated to bringing in names from namespaces different than the current one, so that they can never replace existing names.
357:
A Concrete Channel Type is defined to be the same as Portable Channel Type. It seems to me that it should be different and reflect the different type of information available at the Concrete level.
496:
Here it says that at run time new information is added to a Concrete Interaction Channel Variable. It seems to me that the information should be already available at the Concrete level.
Overall:
I am still unconvinced that defining abstract choreographies is worth the effort. If they were not defined, no new syntax (or just a minimum amount) would be required for Types, Messages, Operations, Interactions/Channels, Reliability, Semantics, etc., since those constructs would already be available at the WSDL abstract level.
