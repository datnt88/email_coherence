I've incorporated diff markup for all the issue resolutions that MJH and
JJM incorporated into Part 1 before the FTF meeting in Palo Alto.
I will do the same for Part 2 later this week.

BTW, have we relaxed the constraint of using the Change Log?
(Just wondering whether I really need to do the extra work.)

I've been filling in the change log in quite a bit of detail. When I put
the diff markup in for the changes you and Marc made, I added entries to
the change log too.
Gudge
Hmm... they do not seem to show up. :-( Generally, change log
entries stop after the 26/8... Maybe the W3C CVS server thinks
we've done too many edits? ;-)
Do you mean the change log at the end of the doc? Or the CVS change log?
Gudge
think.

I just added entries in the change log at the end of part 1 and 2 for
the edits I made over the weekend.
