Hi,
I have used Amaya (5.2/Linux) for this page building :
For an unknown reason, amaya seems not to take into account
some paragraphs. Thus, the texts under the 'Mailing List' section and
the 'Modules' section is cut after the first letter ???
Thank you for the currenct work and for helping,
Alexandre Brillant
Hi,
Developing a script for teaching today involved trying to download an
80Mbyte file from the web.
Amaya 5.2 (non-Gtk) [linux 2.2.19] crashed after reading 2^31 bytes!
Until the latest Netscape and Mozillas they didn't crash but behaved very
erratically once the 'number' had 'gone negative' - only to behave alright
again after 2^32 bytes.

I'm not sure why this would trouble you. 2^31 is 2 GB and 2^32 is 4 GB.
80 MB, although a suitably impressive download size, is only about 0.08 GB.

Eek! Of course you are correct - so what is magic about 20,000,000
(roughly) which causes Amaya to fall over - thinks - that should have been
2^21 NOT 2^31.
Mea culpa!
