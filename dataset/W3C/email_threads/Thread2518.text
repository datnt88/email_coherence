The latest Netscape Communicator Release seems to have removed the option provided
in previous releases to disable the reception of cookies. Does anyone know what Netscape's
stance on this is?
I found it (after much looking). It's in the 'general' security preferences.

Well the NS Communicator I'm running still has the options ... the whole
options stuff has been moved and reorganized. Under VIEW select
preferences and then click the 'advanced' topic. There are 4
options to control cookies and others for java, javascript, style
sheets, etc.
