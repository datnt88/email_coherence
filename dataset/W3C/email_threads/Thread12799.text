Evaluation and Repair has some changed info worthy of inclusion in
Bullets 1 and 2, adjust to the new ER Title Change:
"Techniques for Web Content Accessibility Evaluation and Repair Tools" (AERT).
Work in progress there:
"Rating Algorithm for Evaluation of Web Pages"
"Evaluation, Repair and Transformation Tools for Web Content Accessibility"
Regards/Harvey Bingham
I have independently been drafting a Web site accessibility rating algorithm
stemming from the work that Jakob Lindenmeyer and Reto Amb?hler had
presented at last year's WWW8 conference. I am not developing it with
accessibility defined on a single scale though, such as 0-100, but rather in
five different "spheres."
These include:
Vision
Hearing
Mobility
Learning
Cognitive
I am trying to derive whether sites are particularly biased against one
modality, or is it generalised. For instance, does a site with AA
conformance but lacking graphical cues also benefit a person with a learning
impairment? Would a rating system similar to what Zagat's restaurant
guides does, where different facets of the experience are evaluated, be
useful when coupled with search engine results? Once I have a more suitable
baseline, I will forward additional information.

The principle of all three Guidelines is that they apply across disabilities
- in other words, if a page is double-A conformant then it is hoped that all
significant barriers have been removed, for people with all disabilities.
Follow up on whether the guidelines meet this goal should be directed to the
working group for each set of guidelines -
Web Content Accessibility Guidelines - mailto:w3c-wai-gl
Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines - mailto:w3c-wai-au
User Agent Accessibility Guidelines - mailto:w3c-wai-ua
