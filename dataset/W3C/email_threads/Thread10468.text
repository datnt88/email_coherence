I am going through the editorial updates to the syntax WD and I got to:
Does the RDF series need to define "arc"? The original RDF syntax says
quite a lot: "directed labeled graphs (also called 'nodes and arcs
diagrams')" and defines arc in its glossary as "A representation of a
property in a graph form; specifically the edges in a directed labeled
graph." The new Concepts and Syntax specs mention yet do not seem to
define arc.

We do define node (link to editors' draft dfn):
but not arc. So can we talk about nodes &amp; arcs pictures anymore? :)

I'm agnostic about defining 'Arc'. But I do think the term 'node' is
useful separately from the context of "nodes and arcs diagrams".

I think you can probably get away without defining "arc" any further
than it already is (where it's used in describing the diagrams), if you
eliminate its use in the third sentence of Section 3.4:
"A literal may be the object of an RDF statement, but not the subject or
the arc."
Here, "property" or "predicate" should be substituted for "arc" anyway,
to be consistent with the terms used for the other components of the
statement.

Suggestion: we can talk about node and arc PICTURES. The pictures do
have arcs in them. The graphs, however, don't.
