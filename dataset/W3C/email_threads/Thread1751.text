No, not "400:Conflict.
Either "409: Conflict" if the resource could be put under version control,
or "403: Forbidden" if the resource cannot be put under version control.

Hi,
what would be the expected response code for a DAV:version-tree report on a
resource which is not version controlled? Bad Request?
Julian
OK,
this make sense.
The spec could be a bit clearer, though :-)
The meaning of these error codes is defined by 2616,
and the DeltaV spec makes a point of not repeating information from
the base spec (so that we automatically inherit any
later revision of 2616, rather than conflict with it).
Cheers,
Geoff

Geoff,
no offense intended.
I think it would be clearer if the status (being a VCR or a version) would explicitly be listed as precondition.
No offense taken!
(Sorry if I sounded offended ... I didn't feel offended :-).
But I'm glad that you followed up, because that saves me from
having to follow up my own post (which I hate to do :-).
In particular, I was going to add that in addition to the 403/409,
you should have
in the response body or DAV:responsedescription. (See section 3.6).
We didn't want to have "must be version or VCR" in the precondition
for the DAV:version-tree report, to allow future extensions to allow
this report on other kinds of resources.

Geoff
