most browsers have a way of viewing unrendered source code.
this is handy for analysing programming techniques for neat layouts....
or finding a bug in file spec so that i can mail a suggestion to author.
i cant find any way of doing this in amaya --- found the view alternate
but it gave a lynx-like rendering... is there a non rendered view posible.
and the alternate views and link view etc opened windows that were way
off the screen. Shouldnt these windows be opened somewhere on the
screen in a tiled effect and then let the user posn to taste .... the default
seems structured for a big display but surely there is a way to determine
the actual environment and shifting the window appropriately. i even had
difficulty trying to grab the movement bar to pull it over

The structure view contains the source (except for a couple of odd things,
like language of the page, charset, and generator metadata).
I agree that it would be handy if new views appeared a bit more centrally on
the screen (although in Gnome that is controlled by the window manager not
the program).

We're considering the possibility to have a source view in addition to the
structure
view. I guess it's what you'd like to have.

May I suggest that you make it searchable for strings, which my netscape
cannot do at the moment?

What Netscape are you running? Try opening the source window and type
Ctrl-F. What is annoying about Netscape's source view is that it translates
HTML entities (for example, you would see  in place of  in the source).
