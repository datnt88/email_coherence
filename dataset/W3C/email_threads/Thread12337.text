Dear all,
the review of the charter is urgent - we hope to send it to the Advisory

Good job on the charter. Just one comment. Should the evaluation
process document be a deliverable? A note perhaps?
Cheers,

That is my major question. I see it as part of the techniques, albeit most
likely a seperate document (essentially a part A and a Part B)...
But I am not sure. I left it vague becuase it is easy for us to produce a
document that is not a listed deliverable, but if we do list one then we are
bound to produce it as a document whetehr we think it is a good idea or not.
What do people think?

"Tracking related work in other working groups, commenting on and

WL: Perhaps get across the idea that in addition to their work affecting
ours, the converse might also happen. Accessible Authoring = Device
Independent Authoring = Usability Authoring and all that?

Love.
ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE

CMN It is made explicit in the statements of dependencies where particular
ones ahve been identified in either direction.

CMN COmmitment to implement is valuable in demonstrating that these are a
worthwhile set of guidelines to have, and in generating response about what
is easy / hard / difficult / missing. It is also useful to get commmitment to
put them in purchasing policies, as most manufacturers have to sell product.

CMN E&amp;O is a general W3C communication mechanism for Accessibility related
stuff. Besides which there is relatively little done by E&amp;O on authoring
tools.
