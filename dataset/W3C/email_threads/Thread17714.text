Hi,
I've been thinking about the issue of where the alternative rendering of
the information is best handled. In general, I believe for a number of
reasons that providing choices of alternative rendering via the browsers
is preferable for many blind users.
One reason is that blind users can change access technology without
needing to learn new ways that the information is going to be presented.
This means that a user has some more freedom to switch among acess
technology.
Having the browser provide alternative renderings reduces the problems
which can crop up when a blind person in the workplace or at school
needs to use the organization-chosen browser that is not well supported
by access technology.
More of the burden is on browser developers rather than access
technology developers. My suspicion is that it is probably easier for
browser developers to "tweak" their software for alternative renderings
rather than teaching access technology about web pages because the
alternative renderings that are being asked are not that significant in
terms of complexity.
Having the browser handle alternative presentations avoids the lag
between versions of access technology handling changes to browser.
A browser providing alternative renderings does not prevent some access
technology from providing additional renderings if some specialize
segment needs them.
I'm not clear that there are very many reasons why alternative rendering
should not be done in browsers.
The first reason is that browser developers may not understand or seek
out what blind users need.
The second reason is why would browser developers go through any effort
to have their browser provide alternative arrangements?
An idea that came to mind is to include a statement in the guidelines
that browsers which do not include the specified alternative formats can
be considered to be inaccessible for many blind users. This statement
could be used in a number of ways, e.g. legal action, 508, etc.

While I agree with Scott on his points, making a "universal browser" is
exceedingly difficult. In cases of specialized rendering, such as voice
output to replace the visual display, that is something I do not believe
should be in the browser and here is why:
1) Design - Microsoft could not do a good job of designing a audio UI for
blind folks and then maintain it moving forward. The area of expertise is
narrow. General voice output, such as Aural Style Sheets is one thing -
designing a Speech UI is another. Trust me, I know.
2) Performance - HTML is used everywhere throughout the operating system.
The rendering object can be loaded in many, many places. Carrying around
code that is only useful to a small segment of the total users is wasteful
for everyone. In this age of bloat-ware, a popular feature of Opera is it's
speed and small size.
3) Testing - Specialized rendered requires specialized testing, which the
major companies are not equipped to deal with.
Now, that's not to say that I don't agree that the browser should provide as
much as possible in the way of alternate rendering and/or accessibility
features. Microsoft has proven for several years that we are willing to add
features to our browser to make it better for everyone. We will continue to
do that and work with the ISVs to figure out the division between what we
can do, verses what the aid can do. In many cases, the ISVs feel they can
do it better than us and that's a good thing.
Finally, I shudder at this comment:

that browsers which do not include the specified alternative formats can
be considered to be inaccessible for many blind users. This statement

Please remember, that this document is a recommendation. If it were to be
used as any sort of a legal statement, we would have to reevaluate our
participation in the process.
Furthermore, I reject the argument that if a browser doesn't conform to the
guidelines that it should be "considered to be inaccessible for many blind
users." Many users and several ISVs will tell you that Internet Explorer is
highly accessible by blind users and at the current time, we only conform to
most of the Priority 1 guidelines.

Scott
Hi,
I'd like to apologize for not being as specific as I should have been
in my previous posting. When I was talking about rendering, I meant
rendering when the presentation was visual. I didn't mean that that
audio presentation or any other single access browsers should include
the same type of rendering aspects. Also, I didn't mean to imply that a
universal browser was appropriate. Please forgive any confusion I may
have created.
Scott
Hi,
Let me give a little background on why I brought up my suggestion on
a statement on inaccessibility in the guidelines. I'm not sure if the
subject has been brought up with other people on this list, but
several people have been talking to me about the work the access board
will be doing on 508 and technology access.
My impression is that Congress has assigned the task of determining what
accessible technology means to the access board to reach various objectives
of 508. Since the browser is a key piece of current technology, it is
not unreasonable to assume that the access board may have to define what
accessible browser/s is/are.
What I've been asked on a couple of occassions is whether the guidelines
can be used to define parameters of an accessible browser. My point
has been that currently the guidelines are just guidelines but do not
necessarily define what an accessible browser is.
The question becomes what organization is best qualified to say what is
an accessible browser. I believe that this group is probably more
qualified since the technical knowledge is so specialized. A suggestion
I've been toying with for the guidelines is an appendix listing what
features should be included when some law/regulation requires that an
accessible browser be specified or defined.
The issue has some similarity to determining what blind access means in
an elevator. From what I was told, some elevator developer(s) took
positions that blind access was not their responsibility or that they
should have the right to determine the degree of accessibility since it
was going to affect their bottom line. Also, why do elevators have
redundant coding in both raised numbers and braille? The blind people
who prefer raised numbers may have told elevators developers that raised
numbers were only needed. Braille users may have demanded braille or
they would not consider the elevator to be accessible. Also, there
seems to be no provisions in elevators for blind people with neuropathy.
Scott
Scott, is what you mean that the browsers should make the underlying
HTML, or an equivalently marked-up rendering scheme, available to
assistive technology plug-ins? In this case, it seems like a good idea if
the browser wants to be a universal one. (As opposed to a browser that is
concieved as useful for a small number of people, such as EIA, and could
justify the 'bloat' argument.)
To use the guidelines as a legal stick would require that they were much
more tightly written, and thingswere much more tightly specified than is
desirable, since it would make it difficult to accommodate advances in
technology at a sufficient rate to be valuable. And it would seem to me
that lawyers, who have the necessary background to create documents that
can be used in legal arenas do not generally have the background reauired
to formulate guidelines. Besides which, the law in the US and the law in
Australia and the law in the UK operate differently. Are we writing an
International treaty, or a useful document for people trying to get the
best product to the market the fastest?

That is already available in a browser specific fashion with Internet
Explorer through the Dynamic HTML object model. A generic object model is
also exposed that is compatible across applications, we call that Active
Accessibility. This has been available since May of 1997.

I would like to move the discussion on the UA guidelines away from judging
wether a particular browser is accessible to the "blind" or any other
disability. Our primary focus is to develop a list of features for user
agents that are useful for people with disabilities to access WWW
technologies.
Chuck is correct that the W3C only develops recommendations and does not
have any enforcement mechanism to force any member organization to follow
any W3C recommendations, including such highly visible specifications like
HTML 4.0 and CSS1&amp;CSS2. Currently it is primarily market forces that drive
a particular companies adherance to W3C recommendations. Remmember that
our recommendations must be reviewed by other W3C groups, administration
and finally approved by the W3C Advisory committee (which all major browser
manufacuters partiicpate). So even if we wanted to have judgement type
statements in the UA guidelines(which I don't), I can guarantee they would
be weeded out before any proposed recommendation made it to recommendation
status. It would also considerably slow down the recommendation process.
So let's not waste our previous resources focusing on what any paricular
company should or should not do related to accessibility, but let's move
our discussions to more important issues like table navigation and dynamic
HTML accessibility.
If you want to express your opinion on the merits or problems of a
particular browser related to accessibility there are plenty of other lists
to send your comments, or you can send your comments directly to the
comapny.
We must restrict our comments on the W3C WAI UA list to user interface
issues, if we are to accomplish our goals.

This is not the appopriate list for discussing legal issues related to the
W3C UA guidelines. The W3C releases recommendations, and does not have any
enforcement mechanism to legally force any comapny to use it's
recommendations. We want use our resouces to focus on improving the
accessibility of WWW technology and not directing our limited resources
trying to predict any future political use or non-use of the guidelines by
any country. Remmember our group serves on behalf of the W3C advisory
group. If they feel the guidelines are being politicized, they would
probably review our charter.

I think the issue of the "universal" browser relates closely with the issues
of Universal Design. Of the seven principles espoused as the fundamentals
of Universas design (http://www.trace.wisc.edu/docs/ud_princ/ud_princ.htm),
the first five are relevant to user agent design. To wit:
PRINCIPLE ONE: Equitable Use
The design is useful and marketable to any group of users. Guidelines:
1a. Provide the same means of use for all users: identical whenever
possible; equivalent when not.
1b. Avoid segregating or stigmatizing any users.
1c. Provisions for privacy, security, and safety should be equally available
to all users.
PRINCIPLE TWO: Flexibility in Use
The design accommodates a wide range of individual preferences and
abilities. Guidelines:
2a. Provide choice in methods of use.
2c. Facilitate the user's accuracy and precision.
2d. Provide adaptability to the user's pace.
PRINCIPLE THREE: Simple and Intuitive Use of the design is easy to
understand, regardless of the user's experience, knowledge, language skills,
or current concentration level.
Guidelines:
3a. Eliminate unnecessary complexity.
3b. Be consistent with user expectations and intuition.
3c. Accommodate a wide range of literacy and language skills.
3d. Arrange information consistent with its importance.
3e. Provide effective prompting for sequential actions.
3f. Provide timely feedback during and after task completion.
PRINCIPLE FOUR: Perceptible Information
The design communicates necessary information effectively to the user,
regardless of ambient conditions or the user's sensory abilities.
Guidelines:
4a. Use different modes (pictorial, verbal, tactile) for redundant
presentation of essential information.
4b. Provide adequate contrast between essential information and its
surroundings.
4c. Maximize "legibility" of essential information in all sensory
modalities.
4d. Differentiate elements in ways that can be described (i.e., make it easy
to give instructions or directions).
4e. Provide compatibility with a variety of techniques or devices used by
people with sensory limitations.
PRINCIPLE FIVE: Tolerance for Error
The design minimizes hazards and the adverse consequences of accidental or
unintended actions. Guidelines:
5a. Arrange elements to minimize hazards and errors: most used elements,
most accessible; hazardous elements eliminated, isolated, or shielded.
5b. Provide warnings of hazards and errors.
5c. Provide fail safe features.
5d. Discourage unconscious action in tasks that require vigilance.
Note that all of these are simply good design principles. With regard,
specifically, to web browsers and universal design, there are some features,
such as keyboard control, that are common to a wide range of individuals.
Keyboard controls are useful for anyone who cannot use, or chooses not to
use, a mouse. Table serialization may be useful for non-visual users as
well as those with learning disabilities. Features that are desirable
across a wide range of individuals probably should be a component of the
browser itself.
Some features, on the other hand, are of use only to very limited
populations. The browser should not be expected to anticipate and
accommodate every possible need. But it should be made so that a standard
device can provide for the special need. The user agent should be versatile
enough to accommodate a wide range of common needs, and adaptable enough to
accommodate special needs. The mechanism needed to provide adaptability are
variable, but the ability to plug extensions into a browser for special
needs would meet this need, if the information necessary to easily create
the plug-ins were readily available.

Scott
to follow up on what Jon Gunderson said:
As Scott points out, there are people out there whose job it will
be to write regulations. The WAI-UA group did not set out to do
their job for them. On the other hand, a scenario where the
WAI-UA guidelines get picked up and misapplied by people who are
under the gun to write regulations _fast_ seems a plausible risk,
to me.
Either of two outcomes would be an error: if the prospective
regulators viewed the document this group is producing as either
a) irrelevant to their task
b) draft public policy ready for adoption and enforcement
that would be an error.
Partly, that is why we have an International Program Office in
the WAI -- to provide the follow-through needed to see that the
results of the technical working groups get appropriately
applied.
Maybe a meta-guideline on the relationship between this technical
work and public policy initiatives would be a help, and maybe we
should ask the IPO to take the lead in developing that?
Al
Laws have a different test to become a reality than the current W3C WAI UA
guidelines. While legislators in some countries may choose the UA
recommendations as a basis for an accessibility law, I am sure they will be
greatly transformed in the process and look quite different. It would
also be one of many documents and other types of input that would go into
any law. I think it would be wise of us to focus on our present task of
developing useful design recommendations to meet the needs of W3C member
companies and persons with disabilities throughout the world, than to
contemplate how our guidelines would be used in developing legislation in
any particular country.

Hi, John
You have a good point about issues being transformed in the legal
process. That's what I'm concerned about. When technical decisions
are handled by legislators or regulators, the results can be rather
unsatisfying. I think the priority should be first to do good technical
work on the guidelines and then develop legislative/regulatory suggestions
based the the technical work. It will help both legislators/regulators
and the disabled world.
