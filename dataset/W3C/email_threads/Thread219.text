dear madam or sir,
although tidy's latest version (26.07.1999) claims to offer the
possibility of extending its knowledge of html tags, I couldn't get it
to accept Netscape's multicol ... /multicol .
my configuration file looks like:
// config file for HTML tidy
new-blocklevel-tags: multicol
indent: auto
indent-spaces: 2
wrap: 72
// snip ...
what went wrong?
thank you for your kind consideration.

Has a new version of tidy, fixing this bug with the configurable tags, been
released yet?

Hello Kai,
I asked this question some hours ago. It's a
known bug.

Kai,
There is a known glitch with the 07/26/99 version of Tidy. the
new-blocklevel-tags, new-inline-tags
and new-empty-tags feature is broken. Hopefully it will be fixed in the next
release

does anyone think it's possible we're dealing with a hash function
collision
in file config.c:
functions install() - hash()
here?
the number of non-NULL entries after
installation is 31 whereas we require an actual number of configuration
flags entries of 36!
just a hint, and i don't know how to write hash functions ...
