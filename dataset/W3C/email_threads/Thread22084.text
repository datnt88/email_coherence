Hi all,
For the following XML:
?xml version='1.0'? foo f='100' /foo
when getChildNodes() is called on the root element,
different
implementations of DOM return NodeList of different
length.
Xerces2-J and Crimson return a NodeList which
contains 1 Text node of value
"100"
DOM4j and Python's minidom return a NodeList
containing no nodes.
This could be a problem if one's doing a comparison
between two DOM
implementations. Unfortunately, this case is not
covered by the current
DOM-TS, and I couldn't find anything on DOM spec.
What should be the
correct haviour?
Thanks in advance,
ML
I think attributes should not show up as childnodes...
wether an element is the root element shouldn't make a difference

I can't imagine why they'd do this; attributes are not children of the
element node, and their children certainly are not. This strikes me
as a bug in Xerces2-J and Crimson.

A comprehensive test suite is *incredibly* hard to write. ;-( I wish
I had more time to participate in the DOM-TS efforts.

Calling getChildNodes on a DOM Attr node does return the children of the
Attr, which are the text and EntityReference nodes that make up the Attr's
content.
Calling getChildNodes on an element does *NOT* return the Attr nodes or
their descendents. Attributes are not children in the DOM, and do not have
parents (though they may have an Owner Element).
