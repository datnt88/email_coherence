Hi, All!
I have a question about line feed normalization in C14N. The spec says
that :
- All whitespace in character content is retained (excluding
characters removed during
line feed normalization)
If an XML document must be converted to a node-set, XPath REQUIRES that
an XML processor be used to create the nodes of its data model to
fully represent
the document. The XML processor performs the following tasks in order:
1. normalize line feeds
2. ...
During discussion in xmlsec mailing list we came up with two possibilities:
1) All '\r' characters from the document should be removed when
document is parsed
by XML processor.
2) All '\r' should be converted to "&amp;#D;" by the parser.
I would appreciate if someone can clarify this part of the specification.
Thank you in advance,
Aleksey Sanin
Alexey,
I am quite sure that "1. normalize line feeds" means what you can read
in XML 1.0 Second Edition in
Right, John?

Gregor,
Thanks for your response! I would also think this way but I am confused by
the following quote from C14N spec:
- All whitespace in character content is retained (excluding
characters removed during
line feed normalization)
which makes me think that '\r' characters are deleted and not replaced.
I was
also told that Microsoft .NET implementation deletes '\r' characters
(and this
caused incompatibility with xmlsec).

My recollection has long gone stale on such nuances -- I hope John might
remember better -- but I'd opt for the "conversion" option. Not only does
the following say:
To simplify the tasks of applications, the characters passed to an
application by the XML processor must be as if the XML processor
normalized all line breaks in external parsed entities (including the
document entity) on input, before parsing, by translating both the
two-character sequence #xD #xA and any #xD that is not followed
by #xA to a single #xA character.
but XPath says:
The normalize-space function returns the argument string with
whitespace normalized by stripping leading and trailing whitespace
and replacing sequences of whitespace characters by a single space.
I read the text that you cite from C14N:
- All whitespace in character content is retained (excluding
characters removed during line feed normalization)
as not requiring the special (normative) removal of '\r', but to only
(non-normatively) refer to the removal of '#xA' when ' #xD #xA' was
replaced with '#xD'.
