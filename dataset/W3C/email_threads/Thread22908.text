Hi!
I'm using Netscape 6 and attemtping to add form-filling functionality from a tab in my sidebar - but am having difficulty finding documentation on accessing the main window - is it window.document.myform.whoozit? This doesn't work - does anyone know where I can find the actual hierarchy of the document object model of Netscape 6 specifically?
So far it seems that unlike the IE COM bar - the netscape sidebar doesn't count as a frame, and for the life of me, I can't visualize the tree...
Your help would be hugely appreciated!!

The DOM has no concept of windows; that's a browser/application issue.
