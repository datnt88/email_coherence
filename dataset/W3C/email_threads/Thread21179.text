If using Win98 Amaya, 7.2a, I go to
should I be able to see the alternate style sheet, or is this not
yet supported? There is a basic and a large print stylesheet for
this site, but I can't seem to get the site rendered with the large
print one. If I go to open, only base.css shows up. If I try
Style- enable, it tells me there aren't any.
Thank you,
Hugh

Unfortunately it's not supported yet.

OK, then I can currently only access these with Mozilla, since I
can't get IE to do anything sensible with them either.
The dialogue box suggests that it was designed for future expansion,
so I hope it won't be a big job.
Thank you.

It could be effectively implemented quickly after the CSS float.
