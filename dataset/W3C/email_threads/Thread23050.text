Hi,
I was wondering if the DOM Working Group would consider splitting the DOM
HTML features document.referrer, document.cookie, and document.domain out
of the HTML-specific interface, and into a general "browser" interface
that applies to all XML documents as well. (I understand that not all DOM
implementations would want to support these features, which is why I am
not suggesting they be made part of the DOM core.)
There isn't really anything HTML-specific about these three attributes,
and I think authors would benefit from being able to use them from other
contexts, such as SVG, without having to cast their document object to an
HTML object despite there being no HTML on the page. :-)

Yes, that would indeed be great, especially as none of the alternative are any
good (casting, proprietary, reinventing the wheel). The splitting out would seem
to require minimal work and could be readily reused by other specs.

I have no objection of doing so and we could certainly add it on our
wishes list:
... but that would require that the Working Group do produce work on a
general "browser" interface, which we don't for the moment. Our current
plans are to finish DOM Level 3 (which is really late on schedule) for
the moment but, for the moment, we don't plan to produce more work after
that.

That would be nice.
Couldn't another WG take care of that? The DOM WG isn't the only one that deals
with user agents.
