In the DOM 2 spec [07/03/2000] under section 4.2 the MediaList interface
has a method called "delete". Since delete is a keyword in C++, perhaps
this method should be named "deleteMedium" instead.

Hum, seems we really need to change the name of this method.
It makes sense to rename append for consistency. Here is
the new interface :
// Introduced in DOM Level 2:
interface MediaList {
attribute DOMString mediaText;
// raises(DOMException) on setting
readonly attribute unsigned long length;
DOMString item(in unsigned long index);
void deleteMedium(in DOMString oldMedium)
raises(DOMException);
void appendMedium(in DOMString newMedium)
raises(DOMException);

Unless I am much mistaken, the IDL - C++ mapping defined by the OMG
deals with this by renaming the method in some systematic way, such as
by adding an underscore prefix or something.
So this is necessarily catastrophic, although it probably violates the
principle of least surprise.
