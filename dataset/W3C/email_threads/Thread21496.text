Hi Jeremy,
just a quick one in between...
using Jena as
java -cp /w3ccvs/WWW/2002/03owlt/editors-draft/WEB-INF/lib/jena.jar;
/w3ccvs/WWW/2002/03owlt/editors-draft/WEB-INF/lib/xerces.jar;
/w3ccvs/WWW/2002/03owlt/editors-draft/WEB-INF/lib/icu4j.jar
jena.rdfcopy %1 RDF/XML N3
we are quite happy to have the testcases in N3
e.g
it's just that in the latter we (and cwm as well I see)
had some trouble with quotes-inside-quotes of of the
testSchema#description literal
therefore I made the manual change into what N3
normally uses for such cases i.e. """
I have no problem (appart from a too long proof at
our side) with your N3 production

Hmmmm.
Dan -
the quotes inside quotes problem here seems to be arising because of a
mismatch between what Jena does and what cwm does.
The description in question as an xhtml code element. Using the C14N view
of an XML Literal Jena sticks in the namespace decl xmlns="....xhtml..."
with the " preferred by XC14N.
Fixes could be:
- hack Jena to use ' instead of "
- fix cwm to accept " inside "
The hack on Jena would not be acceptable in a shipping Jena, but I am in
fact processing the OWL test cases with a special so I can hack it
independently.
Jeremy
cwm already supports it:
#z #prop "string with \" escaped quote marks".

You can't put an unescaped newline inside a "-delimited
string, keep in mind.

right, I forgot that and euler supports that as well I see

Hmm... how much of this is in the primer?
How much should be there?

nor does pythonwin on TimBL's laptop).
