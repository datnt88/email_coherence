There seems to be a problem with long hrefs that get broken into several lines.
Amaya does not recognize such links on the main screen, but it does in the Links
window. For example, go to http://www.phil.uni-passau.de/lehrst.shtml and click
on "Politikwissenschaft (Politische Theorie und Ideengeschichte)" (somewhere
down the page) where a linebreak occurs between "und" and "Ideengeschichte
(at least on my screen, may depend on the width of your Amaya window).
Links that are not broken into multiple lines work fine.

Amaya 3.1 Linux binary distribution
In that page Amaya has a problem with the attribute height of TD elements
when their contents is greater ( td HEIGHT="81" ) but no problem with long
hrefs

You think so? Then try this little example:
a href="noref.html" In that page Amaya has a problem with the attribute height
of TD elements when their contents is greater but no problem with long
hrefs /a
At least my version of Amaya does not recognize the href in the main and
alternate windows, but it does so in links window.
