The Manual of Style includes the following example:
... as is done for the 'page' property of CSS2 ([CSS2], section 13.3.2).
The question recently arose, should be parens be used when there is no "...
section 13.3.2"? (They are not used by the Manual of Style).
Eg.
... as applications of XML 1.0 [XML].
or
... as applications of XML 1.0 ([XML]).
The above being different from:
for specifications such as [XML 1.0] and [CSS2].
(I prefer no parens).

Hello, Richard,
Maybe the introduction to punctuation in the Chicago Manual 5.2 applies:
"The tendency to use all the punctuation that the grammatical
structure of the material suggests is referred to as close (klos)
punctuation. It is a practice that was more common in the past, and
though it may be helpful when the writing is elaborate, it can,
when misused, produce an uninviting choppiness. There is a tendency
today, on the other hand, to punctuate only when necessary to
prevent misreading. Most contemporary writers and editors lean
toward this open style of punctuation yet preserve a measure of
subjectivity and discretion."
Is that enough to support your view?
I admit to using some extra commas in my life.
The first looks preferable.
Here we cut a corner too quickly. What do you think of this instead?
for specifications such as XML 1.0 [XML1] and CSS2 [CSS2].
I agree.
Hi Susan,
Thanks for your comments. I agree with all you propose.
Cheers,
Richard.
