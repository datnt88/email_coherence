Hi, and welcome on public-evangelist!
Thanks for all of you that have subscribed so fast to this new mailing
list: this is a good omen for the work that we want to see happen
here!
Let me just introduce quickly the context and goals of this forum: it
has been created as part of the Quality Assurance Activity [1] at W3C (I
assume you all know what W3C is :). Formally speaking, it is part of the
educational mission of the QA Interest Group [2].
As described on the mailing list home page [3], this forum aims to be a
place to coordinate the efforts of people trying to make the Web a
better, more interoperable system by inciting compliance to open
standards. The kind of cooperations we can imagine:
- sharing resources, documents, tips and tricks, experiences
- writing articles, publicizing them across various audiences
- helping articles and books writers with understanding the standards
the right way
- organizing some network events to publicize the standards (?)
This is of course not an exhaustive list, and any ideas to complete it
would be a good start of discussion!
Some important points:
- this is a publicly archived mailing list, so everything you sent here
will be available to anyone (and this includes your email address and
any information in your signature)
- we'll have to set some limits on how far we can help tech writers: we
don't give any "W3C seal of approval", nor can we do their jobs for
them.
I know that we have some people from the Mozilla Tech Evangelism Team,
some from the WASP project, but probably many others I don't know
anything about: please feel free to introduce yourself and explain what
are your expectations from this forum, the projects you have in mind and
any other relevant informations!
Thank you very much, and again, welcome.
Dom

Hello everyone,
Thanks to Karl Dubost from the QA group for getting me involved. We met at
the WWW conference in Hawaii not long ago, and I was very happy to hear
about plans for this then, and to see it come to fruition now.
My intro: I'm Molly, I write books on HTML, XHTML, CSS, and web design and
development topics as well as train and speak internationally on W3C
technologies. I am always working harder to better personally understand
and in turn be able to express W3C ideas and methods to practitioners, and
my participation here is in hopes of gaining support, insight, and guidance
when working to present this information to the public.
I am a steering committee member of WaSP, on the Buzz team and co-editor of
the LEARN section (http://www.webstandards.org/). I am working with the
World Organization of Webmasters (WOW) to boost their interest in standards
(and convince them to get their site up to par!) since they serve a very
large population (http://www.joinwow.org/). For more about me, you can
check out my web site at http://www.molly.com/.
I look forward to working with everyone here.
Very best,
Molly :)

Let me thank you (again) for joining this mailing-list. I am extremely
pleased to see a lot of people sharing the same goal of making a better
web through education.
My intro: I'm Olivier Thereaux, part of the W3C staff, and I am working
on Systems (e.g. the mail search for W3C mailing-lists, which you may
have used already) as well as QA. I'll be one of the maintainers of this
list, along with Dominique.
I joined the QA activity soon after its birth, with a strong
desire to develop its Education and Outreach work (via the Interest
Group), so it's an understatement to say that I'm thrilled to see this
forum exist (at last), and that I have great expectations for it.
In some sense, the future of the web will depend on authors,
web evangelists and teachers such as yourselves, as much as it will
depend on new technologies being created or polished at the W3C.
It will, of course, also depend on the quality of web authoring
tools, web automating tools, browsers and emerging technologies
being created around the globe.
Firstly, let me point out that we have some ongoing Education work going
on at the W3C:
- WAI-EO[0] comes to mind, of course
- Tutorials[1] are another example
- our validators (HTML[2], CSS[3], RDF[4])
- Tools (e.g the soon to be released LogValidator[5])
- and more coming in (QA has a few notes in its pipe).
This means the situation is not "W3C versus the Web Standards Education
world", nor is it "W3C trying to control these people", but W3C working
along with them.
Secondly, the birth of this forum is intended to help web evangelists
in their work by (and I'm borrowing Molly's words here) "filling the
gap between the web education world and W3C", and by sharing their
experience and expertise.
Looking forward to discussing with you all.
Kind Regards,
Olivier
