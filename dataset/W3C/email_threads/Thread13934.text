[this is thread started between Phil Hoschka, Mark and myself on
adding textual description to the SMIL spec]
Mark writing:
The more interesting part of this are the preformmated ascii art of
the timing sequences. These really need a written description
because they are really meaningless to the screen reader user as
just text.
I am wondering if it won't be better to render these as
graphics and use  the alt and longdesc to describe them.
Mark is refering to the series of diagrams drawn using plain text in
the current SMIL spec.
Example (showing different length but parallel audio and video tracks
represented using dash lines bounded by a | character):
audio
video
P Figure 6.1: Effect of a delay on playout schedule for different
settings of the sync attribute
DD:: I think the author should be allowed to use PRE and ascii art
instead of more expensive (in size) images.
So we need to come up with a new guideline to attach both a short and
long description to PRE representing graphical information.
For the short description, I think we should require a caption in the
markup, following and preceeding the PRE used as graphics.
The SMIL spec seems to cover that well (e.g. Figure 6.1)
For the longdesc, I would fallback to a D link anchor at the end of
the caption.
So to illustrate what I mean on the example above:
audio
video
P Figure 6.1: Effect of a delay on playout schedule for different settings
of the sync attribute. A HREF=desc61.html class=d-link D /A
Comments ?
The other problem for the person using a screen reader is that there is no
indication where the ascii art begins. Therefore if this method is used,
someone would hear all of the dashes and words and then the description.
If this were an image it would be clear (image, caption, d-link). Perhaps
if the caption was first, then the ascii art followed by some sort of "end
figure" text, perhaps the "d" link, it might make it less confusing.

Very good point.
A specific class for the ascii-art PRE can do, and the /PRE does
the closing.
E.g.
audio
video
P Figure 6.1: Effect of a delay on playout schedule for different settings
of the sync attribute. A HREF=desc61.html class=d-link D /A

For people using browsers that expose the DOM, this strategy is very elegant.
For people using browsers that do not expose the DOM, this strategy will
not solve the above problem.
It's an interim thing.

A browser that exposes DOM or a browser that can understand this PRE
class trick.

OK, so let's have two recommendations:
for inline graphics done using plain text (using PRE for example),
- [Interim] make sure you announce the beginning and the end of
graphic portion using a text "marker" understandable by the user
reading the page, so that she or he can skip this portion.
- [New] use PRE and class=graphics
In both cases, include a long description link for the graphic.
One way to do the interim job while keeping the original look is to
use CSS display=none on some marked SPAN:
audio

P Figure 6.1: Effect of a delay on playout schedule for different settings
of the sync attribute. A HREF=long class=d-link D /A
