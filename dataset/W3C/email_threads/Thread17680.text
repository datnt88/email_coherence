Hello,
In the Web Content WG, we are working on an "impact
matrix" [1] for the Guidelines. The impact matrix lists
each checkpoint and the disability groups the checkpoint
is designed to help. It also lists input and output
devices/software affected by the checkpoint. The GL matrix
is in its early stages and will undoubtedly be evolving
a lot. Nonetheless, I think we should use it as a model
for doing a similar study for the UAGL.

aloha, ian!
a minor navigational comment -- although the linear presentation is listed in
the Table of Contents for the Guidelines Impact Matrix, it would be of great
utility if there were a link to the "List Presentation" underneath the "Tabular
Presentation" and a link to the "Tabular Presentation" under the "List
Presentation".
In other words, i'd like to hear something along the following lines, in which
underscores denote the beginning and end of hyperlink text:
TABULAR PRESENTATION
Each checkpoint links to its definition in the _Web Content Accessibility
Guidelines 1.0_. The following information is available linearly, in a _List
Presentation_
LIST PRESENTATION
Each checkpoint links to its definition in the _Web Content Accessibility
Guidelines 1.0_. The following information is available in a _Tabular
Presentation_

Gregory,
I think that for our matrix we would try to setup something like the UA
issue list where there are separate linear and tabular version.
Do you find the linear version of the issues list usable?
But you may want to forward your comments to the gl list for there
consideration.
Thanks,
Jon

aloha, jon!
thanks for your response... i'm not opposed to 2 separate-but-equal versions
of the matrix, and i do appreciate the fact that when you reference the URI for
the UA matrix (especially when posting the agenda), you reference the linear
version...
you asked:
yes, i do find it quite usable, and i appreciate the effort that has gone into
encoding it and which will go into maintaining it...
you also suggested:
this i shall do, along with a copy of my follow-up comments to your questions,
gregory.
Gregory,
I will try to be more carefull to reference the linear version.
