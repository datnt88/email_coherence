Guys, is there an up-to-date summary of the complete RDF and RDFS
vocabulary anywhere, taking into account all the changes we have
decided on? I'd like to get the MT document towards the stage where
it at least mentions everything, if only to say that it isn't giving
it any particular meaning.
In a similar vein, I presume that the new daml-style rdf:Collections
should be put into the MT document as well. Any objections?

There isn't a totally up-to-date rdf: namespace URI list, but the one
in the syntax doc is the latest:
The RDF Namespace
In my editors draft, this is slightly reformatted:
For the RDF Schema terms, it seems the following sumarises the
vocabular you need:
RDF Schema overview
and is up-to-date.
(rdf:Collections isn't a new term however)
The new rdf:List, rdf:first, rdf:rest and rdf:nil vocabulary will be
added to the syntax doc, in the section/URI above.
The detail of how they *work* will be elsewhere in a section yet to
be written. If you want, I can reserve a document anchor and
skeleton section, for you to point at in the next MT WD?

not at all and we try to backup with running code
so far we have
rdf:List a rdfs:Class .
rdf:first a rdf:Property; rdfs:domain rdf:List .
rdf:rest a rdf:Property; rdfs:domain rdf:List; rdfs:range rdf:List .
rdf:nil a rdf:List .
but still live with owl:item in owl-rules.n3
{ :rule10a } log:implies { ( ?x ) owl:item ?x } .
{ :rule10b } log:implies { ( ?x / ?b ) owl:item ?x } .
{ :rule10c . ?b owl:item ?x } log:implies { ( ?a / ?b ) owl:item ?x } .
