Any suggestions for agenda items for a telecon this week.
Brian
Two stylistic issues concerning the documents
1.. Normativity. We might want to clear up this issue noticed by
several people about which of the 5 documents are considered
normative, and how to explain clearly the difference in the
boilerplate (hopefully so it makes sense: I'm certainly confused
about it, for one. OK, so maybe the primer isnt normative and maybe
test cases are never normative (?), but why is Vocabulary not
normative? And if it isn't, why are its semantics normative? )
2. Change log style. What is appropriate for a change log in the
publication document? (1) the full change log from day one or (2) the
change log since the most recently archived public release? I would
vote for the latter and beg permission to have the semantics doc
brought up to date in that regard by deleting a chunk of stuff from
the change log.

Pat,
OK, I'll send an agenda for a telecon, but I wouldn't object to
cancelling if you and Eric manage to sort this out amongst yourselves
before hand.

Fine with me, I'll take it up with Eric. I think others in the WG may
have views on it, but we can do this by email, surely.
