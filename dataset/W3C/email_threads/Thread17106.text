Hi
I?m trying to send an email containing a url link to a testing usergroup
using screen readers. One of my group has reported difficulties using the
link ? as ?clicking? isn?t an option and html is turned off in her outlook
express. Anyone got any ideas about sending usable url links in emails?
Thanks

links are only useable in email if the function to activate them is
available. I have not seen outlook express not be able to activate links
even as I do have html turned off.

Are you sending the email as HTML or as text?
Many programs will convert http addresses in text emails to links. Outlook
Express does this. So if you send:
then I can click on or tab to that link even though it's not encoded using
HTML.
Curiously, how did she turn off HTML in Outlook Express?
I'm sending as text but, because she can only use cursor keys to navigate,
it seems she can't "click" but then, I suppose how does she navigate the
web
(which she does)??.
I think her carer turned the html off...
She cannot tab?
How did she turn of HTML in Outlook Express, and do you know if it would
work on Outlook (the non-Express version)? I'd love to get rid of it.
Is the problem with selecting the URL (I.e. is she unable to use a mouse),
does the URL not render as such, or does the URL always fail?
She can tab, but the url link is just not active and tabbable to, as alink
in a web page is. If I mouse click on it on her machine, it does work. I
think it might be her speech browser set up?
Very likely. Normally, you can tab to links in text emails using Outlook
Express. But I know that speech browsers will often override normal
keyboard and cursor functions.
There must be a way, though.
what screen reader, version, oe, version is being used here? I have never
seen a message I cannot tab through as far back as jaws 3.7.
