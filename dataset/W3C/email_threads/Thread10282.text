10: Responses to Owl comments
11: Post last call comment from I18N
Scheduled to start at 11am Boston time. Max 45 minutes.
Martin Duerst and I18N invited to attend
Goals:
- to get a clear description of I18N concerns with RDFCore's post last
call design for parseType='Literal'
- to discuss possible means of addressing those concerns
Martin: 5 mins explanation of key I18N concerns + 10 mins for clarifying questions
Patrick: 5 mins explanation of RDFCore design rationale
Discussion
Summing up:
- Has a show stopper problem with the current WD's support for I18N been
identified?
- Is there a change that we wish to recommend to the CG we should make?
12: Schedule
Do we need a second last call?
Status of the docs.
Status of reviewing?
This agenda was produced by Jema, the Jena WG assistant, running on Jena 2
Please could you publish the resulting RDF?
Is there an RDF version of this agenda somewhere?
Can we have that too, please?
There's no urgency to this.
FYI, for related work, please see
