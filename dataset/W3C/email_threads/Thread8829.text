To benefit the developers working with XML Digital Signature we have
started a Web Service, which can verify XML Signature. This service has
been tested with both Java (Apache-axis) and MS-SOAP clients.
There is one function: SecureXMLVerify()
The format is simple: Input is a string containing signed XML and the
output is an XML containing the result of the verification process. The
format of the response is as per the DTD described at
surprised that many more people find this page to visit our web site
than using our home page).
The service (hosted on .NET Enterprise Server, MS-SOAP Server) is
running at http://www.securexml.net/SecureXML/SecureXML.wsdl
The attached files provide client code/instructions for MS-SOAP
client(code) and Apache-axis(instructions). The Apache-axis stuff was
prepared by Pankaj Kumar of Hewlett Packard.
Please use this service to your advantage.
Your feedback is most welcome.

Cool! I relally like this idea and I am "stealing" it:
I hope this will help to improve interoperability accross
different implementations.
A simple Perl script or plain telnet session to port 80 could be used
to submit a signed XML Document to the server for verification.
The verifier pre-loads HMAC key "secret" and Merlin's root CA
used in the Merlin's interop test suites.
