Is there an option to force using the short notation
instead of
when using tidy in XML mode?

sorry , i don't recoginse the ? that was put in when I sent the last mail
hi,
I solved the problem spacing using charencoding utf8 - somehow that worked.
Now a lot of sites can be solved like that with tidy. But I recently
discovered that
pages that uses javascript and are uncommented can cause a problem since
these can contain  - chars or similar interuptive characters that causes
xhtml documents to not become well-formed. As a solution you would put
a CDATA around it...and that would be enough to solve it...I saw some email
commenting on this but I can't find it. Anyone got an answere for this one?
Howard
Currently not. Please file a feature request if you like to have some.

No, it doesn't have to and should not. The "15px" is by the way invalid.
Hm, what about using 1/2 width space characters?

Cheers for the notes on xml-spacing problem...
I've got it under control using encoding...it seems to have done the trick.
The problem with un-commented javascript seems to give another problem.
I can insert a CDATA to get rid of it...
So javascripts that are not commented out... !-- --
seems to give an error when I transform with xsl. This is due to
scripts contain expression for comapring like ( , etc)...thus this
causes xsl to misunderstand the xhtml since it does not become
well formed .... ideally...this should be commented using CDATA.
Any comments...cheers!!!!

CDATA escaping is done in current code base for XHTML output. But Tidy has
to know it is XHTML.
Be sure either to use --output-xhtml yes or declare the XHTML namespace as
the default in the html tag.
take it easy,
