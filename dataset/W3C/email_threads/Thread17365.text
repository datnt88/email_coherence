Well, the W3C servers were moved over the weekend, so there were some
interruptions to service. And I understand some people have found the
meeting registration process complex. (But a lot of
non-english-speaking spaniards managed it for the Madrid event, so it
isn't impossible). I'm pretty sure there is a feedback address for the
meeting registration system - and if you don't tell them what is
difficult you can be almost certain it won't get fixed grin/ .
With respect to the meeting itself Sidar believes that this notice is
too late to be helpful - California isn't close to most of the US, and
is a long way from most of the world. We understand that this group is
not a formal working group, and that it should not therefore be so high
on WAI priorities, but we feel that participation here is important to
accessibility, and so the opportunity to plan for the occasional event
is important to the people here. We hope that in future more timely
notice (even if it has to warn that plans may change) will be provided,
and that meetings will occur with a more even global distribution.

Thank you to the folks who sent me the note about the meeting.
What I find interesting is others did not receive it either and I find
it
quite difficult to register...
