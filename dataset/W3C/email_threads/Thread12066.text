Overall, the guidelines in Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 seem
reasonable and a step forward in promoting accessible content and authoring
tools. However, the specification should clarify its intent. Is the
expectation that an authoring tool should make existing functionality
accessible (and generate accessible content) OR that an application should
meet all spec requirements -- even when these requirements are not
available for other users -- (and generate accessible content)? It is one
thing to expect that existing functionality be made accessible, but quite
another to add functionality to an existing application.
We have a few specific questions/comments/requests-for-clarification below.
Hope our feedback isn't too late to consider...

In the 1.1 checkpoint, what is meant by "conversions"? Does this include
converting one file type to another as in the case of encoding audio or
video content?
1.2 Ensure that the tool preserves all accessibility information
during authoring, transformations and conversions. [Priority 1]
In 7.1, who's "standards and conventions" is the authoring tool supposed to
be adhering to? Who set these standards?
7.1 Use all applicable operating system and accessibility standards
and conventions (Priority 1 for standards and conventions that are
essential to accessibility, Priority 2 for those that are important
to accessibility, Priority 3 for those that are beneficial to
accessibility). [Priority 1]
In 7.2, can an application depend on the operating system's accessibility
standards? For example, for entering text in a dialog, can an application
depend on the OS to be capable of zooming in/out?
7.2 Allow the author to change the presentation within editing
views without affecting the document markup. [Priority 1]
Can 7.4 - 7.6 be appended to include "to the extent that the application
supports this functionality"?
7.4 Ensure the editing view allows navigation via the structure
of the document in an accessible fashion. [Priority 1]
7.5 Enable editing of the structure of the document in an
accessible fashion. [Priority 2]
7.6 Allow the author to search within editing views. [Priority 2]
Well, the feedback is always welcome ;-)
To the specifics... (my interpretations marked with CMN)

CMN Yes, we recognise that. In general it is existing functionalities that
need to be accessible, although there are a couple of functionalities
required by users with disabilities, which are brough out in guideline 7, as
you note below.

video content?
CMN Yes, it does mean converting from one file type to another.
1.2 Ensure that the tool preserves all accessibility information
during authoring, transformations and conversions. [Priority 1]
In 7.1, who's "standards and conventions" is the authoring tool supposed to
be adhering to? Who set these standards?
CMN There are accessibility standards for many operating systems, and there
are standard specifications for almost all of them. In most cases they are
written by the developers of the system. Some of the references provided are
to well-established research work which has formed the basis of many more
specific standards. In many cases, particularly in moving beyond simple HTMl
editors to more powerful or complex authoring tools, the application is also
a user agent, in whch case the user agent guidelines should be met.
7.1 Use all applicable operating system and accessibility standards
and conventions (Priority 1 for standards and conventions that are
essential to accessibility, Priority 2 for those that are important
to accessibility, Priority 3 for those that are beneficial to
accessibility). [Priority 1]
In 7.2, can an application depend on the operating system's accessibility
standards? For example, for entering text in a dialog, can an application
depend on the OS to be capable of zooming in/out?
CMN Certainly.
7.2 Allow the author to change the presentation within editing
views without affecting the document markup. [Priority 1]
Can 7.4 - 7.6 be appended to include "to the extent that the application
supports this functionality"?
CMN These functionalities are required by authors with certain disabilities,
and need to be implemented by tools. although thay can only be implemented to
the extent that a particular format permits (for example there is not a lot
of structure to a basig jpeg, but there is in an accessible movie
presentation or a structured vector graphic).
7.4 Ensure the editing view allows navigation via the structure
of the document in an accessible fashion. [Priority 1]
7.5 Enable editing of the structure of the document in an
accessible fashion. [Priority 2]
7.6 Allow the author to search within editing views. [Priority 2]
Thanks for the feedback. I hope this clarifies.

Charles,
Thanks for your comments.
Re: adding functionality for accessibility, perhaps a specific example
would help...these requirements seems to suggest that we would have to add
add raw SMIL editing to our RealSlideshow product when the application
doesn't offer raw SMIL editing for others. Is this the case? This doesn't
seem reasonable.
Re: converting files, how should we "preserve all accessibility
information" when multiple video and/or audio files are merged into one
streaming media file? What is the expectation here?
--Bridie
Bridie,
It may be easiest to accomplish the requirements through source editing, but
it is not necessary. In a SMIL presentation, the structure essentially
consists of a timed sequence, in which cerrtain elements may have several
paralell components. Being able to move from one point in the sequence to
another, and among paralell items (or switch elements, as the case may
be) would constitute navigation of the structure. That may be achieved by
stepping the focus along a representation of the sequence in what is
essentially tree-style navigation, without ever exposing the source (although
it is necessary to expose textual labels for the elements - titles, alt,
etc). Being able to find a particular timepoint, or a particular object by
name, would be examples of search functions. Being able to cut, copy and
paste a par element is an example of editing the structure.
With regard to conversions, when multiple tracks are merged into a single
file it is expected that the information contained in each of those tracks is
included in the final file produced (for example captions, audio, audio
description and video tracks would all be available).
(I am downloading a copy of RealSlideShow, so we can more easily talk about
the same examples)

unquote
what doesn't seem reasonable? that you should offer the same functionality to
all users? the ATAG doesn't describe how to build a tool for a niche market
(read: users with disabilities), but, rather, how to build a tool that can be
used by all persons, regardless of perceived disability, to create content that
can be used by all persons, regardless of perceived disability...
