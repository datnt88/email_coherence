This is more of a test case, but it has immediate consequences for the
WebOnt and perhaps the RDF working group.
***CLAIM: If Strong (or pt restricted) Ontological Commitment is true,
then there can be no OWL DL RDF/XML documents*, all the syntax checkers
are broken, and a lot of OWL Test manifests assert falsehoods.
*There may be some corner cases where the DL document doesn't use any
of the OWL or RDF vocabulary. Hmm. :foo :bar "blargh". is an OWL DL
document encodable in RDF/XML. So I'll change it to no "interesting"
OWL DL RDF/XML document, where "interesting" means "using the rdf, rdf,
or owl vocabularies. Actually, if you permit rdf entailment, it's true
for all non-empty ones, I think.
***PROOF:
Ontological Commitment requires (some form of) the imports closure of
the used URIs in a document.
The owl document consisting solely of:
Thus requires *at least* the importing of
"http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl"
Thus, *at least* contains:
(see http://mindswap.org/~bparsia/ontologies/test/importowl.owl)
This is in owl full due to redefinition of builtin vocabulary (bit more
discussion:
0051.html).
Q.E.D
Ok, if you say, "Wait, owl:imports only has to have the *effect* of
concatinating the graphs", well, you still, afaict, lose. I don't think
the schema at http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl is compatible with DL. At
least the direct model theoretic semantics (in any straightforward way).
So there's lots of ways to fix this, change the definition of
owl:imports, change stuff about species tests, change the document
served up at http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl (and the rdf: and rdfs:
ones, perhaps).
I did think that some sort of RDDL document which said that the schema
was "informative" and the spec "normative" might help. But who knows?

Why argue against a position that noone has taken?
What is "Strong Ontological Commitment"?
If you want to argue against a position, do it in the
words used to express the position, please.
Dan Connolly, W3C http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/
Are you genuinely asking or indirectly suggesting I shouldn't?
Because it's not clear that no one has taken it.
Also, it was involved a non-obvious consequence of the position, one, I
believe, may affect some of the weaker views propounded or suggested.
So I laid out the argument so we could understand better what might be
wrong with SOC.
And if no one has taken it, what do you care that I chose to refute it?
Perhaps I trying to build stronger consensus against it?
See the talking points for today email.
I reserve the right to write my email in this forum in the context of
this forum. This got sent not long after an email where I defined the
term.
The OC view is:
"that use of a URI in RDF implies a commitment to its ontology, and if
there is doubt as to what ontology that is, the web may be used to
resolve it."
More precisely:
"that use of a URI in RDF implies a commitment to its ontology"
(The rest is irrelevant to the OC bit)
The strong OC view (SOC) is the interpretation of that phrase where:
The 'implies' means that using *is* committing. If I so use, I so
commit.
The 'commitment' means that you must treat all the statements of that
ontology as true.
The ontology in question is the one the URI owner made dereferencable
(or otherwise available)
I don't see much other likely readings, as I have argued. So long as
the above text is "live" in a tag issue statement, I don't see arguing
against it is either otiose or odious.
This statement of the view, in my understanding, entails that an RDF
document is consistent iff the imports closure over all the URIs used
in that document is consistent.
By RDF document being consistent, I mean that the a document of
mimetype application/rdf+xml, conforms to the RDF specs, and that the
RDF graph it is a serialization of is consistent.
"imports closure", in my lexicon, is the graph merge of the graphs
serialized as documents which are dereferencable from the URIs labeling
nodes in those graphs. Hmm. That didn't come out as clean as i wanted,
but I *hope* we all understand that now.
(Note that I'm not saying that you "half to do the imports closure by
downloading and parsing". But it would seem that it'd pretty dang hard
to correctly say you've determined the consistency of a document
without doing that.)
Have I met your terminological standards? And are you ok with me using
SOC and OC (or their expansions) from now on without repeating this or
referencing the archive?
Cheers,
Bijan Parsia.
I don't see how this will make it clear.
I don't. never mind.
Dan Connolly, W3C http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/
I didn't say it would. But if someone held the view, the argument might
convince them otherwise. It might help firm up consensus against the
view (which hasn't been established, yet, except informally), and it
might reveal other things. Or, what the heck, one persons modus pones
is another's modus tollens.
I really should start skipping to the end of messages before starting
to reply.
I just note the cost of queries like that.
Also, you didn't reply to my response to request you made in the latter
part of you message, especially wrt I have met your standard for
terminological explication. I'm trying to figure out what counts as
meeting your request, as, before your note, I though I was doing a very
good job of keeping terms clear, and sources of views mentioned. I've
quoted the text that is the source of the OSC view *serveral* times,
and gave my derivation of the "imports closure" version of it twice. I
would like, henceforth, to just use OSC in this forum. I think this
complies with the spirit of your request, but you haven't confirmed
that.
Cheers,
Bijan Parsia.
