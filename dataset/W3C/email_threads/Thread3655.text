Question: Do display capabilities of computers in other countries vary?
Do I need to worry about screen sizes, number of colors, etc.?
Background: In the past (until the 90's) customers outside the United
States and Europe often had less capable computer systems than those in
the U.S. It was common for other countries to lag two to three years
behind in getting the latest in personal computer technology. This gap
has more or less disappeared in recent years.
Similarly, in older text mod operating systems it was common for the
number of lines of text on the screen to vary. For instance while most
U.S. and European systems allowed 25 lines of text on the screen, some
Japanese systems had fewer, because the display height of Japanese
characters is greater (to allow better diffferentiation given the size
of the character set and the complexity of the characters) and some
systems reserved one or two lines for a "Front End Processor" (the
equivalent of today's Input Method Editor. Variations also existed
between various vendors' hardware in Japan until a standard system
emerged.
Answer: Today there is no need to make special allowances for hardware
limitations in other countries - BUT many similar considerations SHOULD
be kept in mind for the following reasons:
i) Accessibility. For instance, the fact that virtually every monitor
sold today can support millions of colors doesn't make it possible for
color blind users to distinguish all colors. For more guidance in this
area, check out the W3C Web Accessibiity Inititive.
ii) Display capabilities vary a lot these days because different people
have computers with different-sized screens, but also because there
are a lot of other devices (PDAs, cellphones,...). Although not all
Web pages may need to work on cellphones, try to design with as few
limitations as possible.
So, even though hardware variations across locales are not much of an
issue now, the same sort of measures are still needed, though for
different reasons.
I thought there was disagreement that the gap had disappeared.

I agree there is still a gap. It is less common, since more countries have
access to the same hardware as the US and Europe today, but there are still
many countries that run behind. It may also be worth noting that having access
doesn't mean the deployment is the same. Factors such as space availability,
lack of phone service, and environmental conditions (e.g. factory enviroments)
can contribute to devices with lesser or older capabilities being more
prevalent than fancier devices, as well as different attitudes on labor costs
vs equipment costs.
In the PDA and cellular markets, I think there is still a country variation in
display capabilities, not only hardware and display format, but font and
dingbat considerations. It may be worth mentioning differences in protocols
which prevent american devices from being used in japan and vice versa.
Why not focus the question on the differences that people still need to be
concerned with, and not debate how big or small they are or were?
Perhaps ask:
What are the design considerations for international differences in display
devices?
Then you can use the response to define the possible differences, and how to
address them.
