When I use the latest diffspec.xsl stylesheet, I get the following message
at the top of the generated document, which makes me happy:
The presentation of this document has been augmented to identify changes
from a previous version. Three kinds of changes are highlighted: new, added
text, changed text, and deleted text.
When I use the stylesheet with show.diff.markup = 0, I still get the
message, which doesn't make me happy.
When there's no diff marking, shouldn't that message be suppressed?
Thanks,

Yeah, that seems reasonable :-/
Call it a bug and make that Norm guy fix it.
