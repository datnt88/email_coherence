they are used to avoide the word image popping up all over the place
when images are not loaded or when a text browser such as lynx is being
used.
Hello,
Can anyone tell me the purpose for using empty alt tags for unessential
images like spacer gifs?
In researching accessible web design, I came across this recommendation
but
could not find an explaination for it.
Thanks in advance.

The basic idea is to avoid bombarding screen reader users (or other
non-visual users) with extraneous information.
If the items in a navigation bar have "This is an empty placeholder with no
meaning" interspersed several times among the active links, the
intelligibility can drop dramatically!

But, is there a reason to use an empty alt tag of "" as opposed to simply
omitting the alt tag alltogether?

1) Valid html requires a tag
2) the file name maybe read if there is no alt tag (very distracting)
omitting the alt tag alltogether?
Michelle and Jimmie,
Empty ALT attributes allow screen readers and text-only browsers to
ignore the images rather than reading out (or showing) the images'
filenames. Here's an example of how part of a page with no ALT
attributes displays in Lynx:
----- Begin example.
[header_home.gif]
__________ [spacer.gif] [search.gif]-Submit
[spacer.gif]
[spacer.gif]
[spacer.gif] About Our Company [spacer.gif] Our Project
[spacer.gif] Funding Opportunities [spacer.gif] Education [spacer.gif]
Apply [spacer.gif] Newsroom [spacer.gif] Research
[spacer.gif]
[spacer.gif] [USEMAP:email_or_print.gif] [spacer.gif]
[spacer.gif]
[spacer.gif]
[spacer.gif]
[spacer.gif]
[spacer.gif]
----- End example.
With appropriate ALT attributes for the images that convey
information, and empty ALT attributes for spacer gifs, the page might
be rendered as follows:
----- Begin example.
Home
__________ Search Submit
About Our Company Our Project
Funding Opportunities Education Apply Newsroom Research
Email this page Print this page
---- End example.
Omitting ALT attributes altogether is not valid HTML, in any case.

Marti,
Yep. Just checked that on the w3c site and it is a required
attribute for img and area elements but it is optional for input and applet
tags.
I've not witnessed first hand the file name being read if no alt is
present but concur that it would indeed be distracting.
Both good points. Thanks for you reply.

Firstly all HTML attributes are one of three types:
1. Those which have a default value (e.g. the default colspan value
is 1, so there is no need to type td colspan="1" )
2. Those for which the value can be guessed from context and browser
defaults if it is absent, and
3. Those for which there is no reasonable way for the browser to
guess the correct value, and which must therefore always be given,
such as the src and alt attributes of the img element.
As such leaving out alt attributes isn't just bad from the point of
view of accessibility, it isn't correct HTML.
As far as accessibility goes I've just said that HTML requires the
attribute because there is no good way of guessing it's value. When a
browser *does* come across such an image it has two choices, it can
either assume alt="" which could lead to an important (if badly
marked-up) part of the document being ignored, or it can render it as
something like [image], the filename, or a similar way of indicating
the image's presence.
The latter is what many non-graphical browsers opt for. It has
advantages in that it quickly identifies errors, and a page full of
[image][image][image] is less confusing for the user than a blank
page, as at least they can tell what went wrong.

What does a screen-reader say when it encounters an alt=" " ?
Brandon A. Barnett, Information Systems Analyst

The basic reason is that if you don't use alt="" where appropriate, you are
putting gratuitous speed bumps in the way of the speech user. You are taking
the listener's attention to say an ALT that provides no information of any
actual value. Not that these are outright barricades, but they dilute the
value and degrade the experience of the web thereby.
In your research, did you go to Google and search on "ALT text"?
I believe that Alan Flavell's note in this regard
ALT texts in IMG
http://ppewww.ph.gla.ac.uk/~flavell/alt/alt-text.html http://ppewww.ph.gl
a.ac.uk/~flavell/alt/alt-text.html
can be considered the standard reference on this question. It comes up first
in Google, it makes sense, etc.
In other words, yes, this is a FAQ -- it's been answered many times. The best
FAQ answer service on accessibility questions that I know at the moment is a
Google search. It's just too good. Human editors can't keep up.

I guess no one has answered this question yet because that's what it says:
nothing. ;-)
