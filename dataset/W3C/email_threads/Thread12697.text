Hi, Karen and everyone. Microsoft has a videotape called
something like "Enable" that is readily available. You can
probably find it at their website which is
Also, in terms of AAC devices, there is an exceptional video that
was made in Britain demonstrating someone with friends ordering
food at McDonald's, etc. You can get this video from ISAAC, the
International Society for Augmentative and Alternative
Communication. Their website is http://www.isaac-online.org
Their video is absolutely the best one I've seen, even if it is
2-3 years old. I highly recommend it.

The OzEWAI Disc, produced about 3 years ago in Australia (disclosure: by my
Mum) contains some video clips demonstrating use of a screen reader,
magnifier, and braille keyboard. Permission to re-use the content is
provided, requiring acknowledgement of the source.
I am not sure if it is the kind of material we want, but this type of stuff
is useful. Alternatively can we re-use stuff from teh WAI video?

Yes, we discussed at meeting today that we would reference the WSTW video
(page up soon!) in the "further reading" (with changed heading) section,
and maybe break out some clips from that eventually.
Can't recall where I put my OzEWAI disc, I can hunt...

I've got one OzEWAI disc, and I believe that there aren't any more available.
I can make the stuff available via the Web if people are interested (for the
videos we are talking 20MB downloads of .mov files. There are scripts
available, and some still images, but it would take some work to convert this
into (for example) an accessible SMIL presentation. So it depends on demand.
