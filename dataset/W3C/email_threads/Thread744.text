Hi:
I'm enclosing a file which I'd ran through HTML Tidy (Win GUI version).
I noticed that it added in an extra title tag.
I'm not sure if this is a bug. The other bug which I've noticed is that
there are files which I've ran through and HTML Tidy adds in language="javascript"
for a tag originally written as this:
At times, the result is:
It doesn't dump in the language="javascript" all the time and I am
unsure why it does this randomly.
Thanks,
Bobby

Tidy should never add 'language="javascript"' since that attribute
is not in any HTML standard. Strange.

My specification of HTML 4.0 has it, deprecated in favour of type
though...

Sorry. You're right. I spoke to fast. It is there, but deprecated.
Anyway that amounts to the same thing. Tidy shouldn't ever add
deprecated attributes on its own accord, should it?
