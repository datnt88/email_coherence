If you like, it is as though there is an axiom
{ ?x log:uri ?u. ?u string:match "^http://[^#]$" } = { ?x rdf:type
doc:Work }.
(where string:match is a regexp matcher)
This axioms comes from the URI spec and the specs it references.
Which section of the URI spec does that come from?
This sort of thing totally undermines your argument,
I think.
Any semantic web engine can conclude it. It is not authorized
by the OWL spec, it is authorized by the URI spec.

The URI spec calls out the MIEM type registry,
The MIME type registry calls out the HTTP spec.
The HTTP spec says it identifies a network information object.
It is difficult to make the point about the URI spec constraining
models in OWL without being concrete, and its difficult to
be concrete when there is no formalization in the web specs.
What would you have suggested as an alternative?

Huh? MIME type registry calls out the HTTP spec?
Perhaps you meant that the URI spec calls out
the URI scheme registry, which calls out the
HTTP spec.
But actually, the URI spec, RFC 2396, says
nothing about IANA nor a registry.
Perhaps you meant to include RFC2717 in "the URI spec".
But you're asking a lot of your readers when you
leave all this implicit.
Anyway, all this is minor compared to...
... which begs the question again: which part of the HTTP
spec says that? Ah; that has a reasonably straightforward
answer:
The "http" scheme is used to locate network
resources via the HTTP protocol.
-- http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec3.html#sec3.2.2
But it's not at all clear that 'network resource'
is a synonym for doc:Work.
OK, I think I see your argument now, but you're asking
a lot of your readers when you leave all this
implicit.
I suggest you slow down and explain the chain of reasoning.
I have a lot of shared context with you, and I read your
message as saying
rfc2396 log:includes {
{ ?x log:uri ?u.
?u string:match "^http://[^#]$" } =
{ ?x rdf:type doc:Work } }.
which is plainly false.
The actual argument is much more subtle.
Hmm... might be fun to formalize the actual argument
and have Euler spit out the proof.

Yes.
Yes, I guess so.
Yes. Actually the fact that RFC2717 isn't referenced from RFC2396
could be a bug.
I should certianly mention it.
No, that is the weak point over which we are all arguing.
Very true.

by the OWL spec, it is authorized by the URI spec.
