As pointed out, 2001 needs to be changed to 2002. As I'm no copyright
guru, does this go for all existing material? Tests, transforms, and so
on?

You definitely want to get a lawyer's advice, but: General practice I've
seen is to state both the first year whatever-it-is was copyrighted and the
year of the most recent set of revisions: "Copyright 2001, 2002 by ...."

Philippe promised to check this with the appropriate person at W3C.
Unless I hear from him within an hour and a half, I'll make a new
distribution stating 2002 only.
Here the reply I've got:
One should not update the copyright date of a dynamic page with the
present year such that the first publication date is removed:
1. If a document changes frequently, it makes sense to use a range,
starting from the first date of publication.
2. If they don't change, they should retain the original date.
