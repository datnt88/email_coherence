I just noticed (in draft 14) that the Variant option does not specify any
addition to the OPTIONS response, to indicate that a server supports the
option. Shouldn't it?
John
Yes, I guess it should -- at least to indicate the valid VERSION-CONTROL
body elements.
p.s. You're not the first person to refer to a draft -14, so how is it
that I only see a -13 on the delta-v webpage? Did I miss something?
Tim
Yes, that was just an oversight. I'll add an OPTIONS
section to the Variant option.
As for draft-14, it's available in text form at the ietf internet
drafts site, but you are correct that I have neglected to upload
it to the deltav web site ... (sorry about that!).
I will do so as soon as IT restores
our internet connection (which has been down all day ...!).
Cheers,
Geoff
