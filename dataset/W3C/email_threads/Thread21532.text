Hello Henrik (and others if you wish to help):
Can you help me find a (first name, last name) name - made up, of course - which has all the "peculiar" characters of the Scandanavian languages, both Danish and Swedish, and if need be, Norwegian. You know the sort of things I mean: the ones with o's crossed out, circles above letters, ...the whole works. It need not be something you'd want to name your children, just hypothetical.
I am making the SOAP Primer more international in flavour - that was one of the last call comments - hence the desire to change the name "John Q. Public" to something that exercises the Unicode!
Thanks
Nilo
Hi Nilo,
Sorry for the delay--I thought you Ericsson folks had at least a few people with Nordic characters in their names ;)

Of course this requires no more than latin-1.

Thanks, Henrik. Shortly after sending you the email, the same though DID occur to me - I am a bit slow, I'm afraid - and I came up with
?ke J?gvan ?yvind
which covers Iceland, as well. It has the greater likelihood of not being anyone's real name, methinks.
Thanks again
Nilo
