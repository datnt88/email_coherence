The main purpose of the meeting is to resolve any outstanding issues
before the techniques requirements are published to the W3C Technical
Reports page. Please review the thread starting at
Also, there is a long list of issues to be resolved resulting from
comments on the TR draft:
As Wendy mentioned on the list, we need volunteers to work through
these issues and put forward proposals, a topic that can be discussed
further at this week's meeting.
Hi,
who do you think to organize the work for this list of proposals?
in the page:
there are 17 people/organization group of proposal.
I think i could help you but i need to know how do you think is best to
organize this review of request (by people/group? by checkpoint?).
This my request for offer my two cents ;-)
Wendy's suggestion was to take one of the checkpoints and write a
response that addresses the comments which have been made on that
checkpoint. If there are volunteers who would like to do this, we
should be able to proceed through the comments more effectively.
Ok...
I'll be able to help you since saturday :)
regrets
