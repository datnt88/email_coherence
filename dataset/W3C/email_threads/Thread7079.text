This is the last important comment that I have on rfc2396bis-04,
the rest are just typos,...
Section 3.2.2, in particular the paragraph starting with
"This specification does not mandate a particular registered name
lookup technology...", is highly unclear.
In particular, it's not clear to me what restrictions schemes
can make (or not) in this respect. In my view, the current reality
(and what the document should clearly say) is as follows:
- Some schemes (e.g. file:) leave the choice of name lookup/
resolution completely to the OS. They are mostly designed for
local access.
- Other schemes clearly define what naming system is used.
Examples are http:, ftp:,... They usually use DNS, but some
schemes may use another system. How the host names actually
get resolved/looked up may be somewhat different on different
systems, but modulo caching,... the result should be the same.
If you think that this is different, please explain why.
If you think that my description above is going in the right
direction, please make this much clearer in the draft.
Regards, Martin.
Similar to the issue of "octets = ASCII conversion",
I do not see any change in the spec nor any answer to
(cited below).
I do not think that host should be case-insensitive in
the generic syntax, because this would unduely restrict
the use of URIs with potential future systems.
I know that others have made the same comment in private,
so I really wonder why it hasn't been addressed.
I'm not sure this issue can be addressed on the RFC
editor level, but it definitely should be addressed.
Regards, Martin.
What systems would that be? I don't know of any system for which
host is case-sensitive, and I do know that making it explicitly
case-insensitive within the generic syntax allows systems the
ability to reduce the number of arbitrary aliases due to legacy
name resolvers and sloppy rewrites.
Because the comment did not reflect existing practice.
