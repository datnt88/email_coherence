A Basic XQuery implementation that does not support the Schema Import
Feature does not accept schema imports. If it encounters one, it raises a
static error. The Schema Import Feature relaxes this limitation. If an
implementation that supports the Schema Import Feature encounters a schema
import, it processes it instead of raising a static error.

I am having trouble reconciling numbered point 1. in 2.5.2.1 with the
first
sentence of 2.5.2.2.
If numbered point 1. is correct I don't see how 2.5.2.2 alleviates the
problem.
I am assuming that a SchemaImport (no space) and Schema Import (with an
intervening space) refer to the same concept/process. It might help if
this
term / these terms were linked to relevant further explanation.
Perhaps there is some additional explanation that can reconcile the
seeming
inconsistency?

Hi,
In F&amp;O sections 8.2.1 and 8.2.2, the patterns for yearMonthDuration and
dayTimeDuration have two problems. The dashes that appear within square
brackets should be escaped, as per XML Schema Errata E2-18. Also, the
numbers should be represented as [0-9] rather than \p{Nd} as per XML
Schema Errata E2-23.
Thanks,
Priscilla
