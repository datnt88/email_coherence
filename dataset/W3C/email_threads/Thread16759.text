Hi--
I'm trying to make my forms accessible, but I can't figure out how to make
the radio buttons and checkboxes keyboard-accessible. I've tried the
accesskey feature, but that technique doesn't work in Netscape 4.7 (example
is at
What am I doing wrong? Do I need an accesskey, or is there a keyboard
command to select form items that I don't know about?
Here's the source code:
Press Alt+1 to set focus to the textbox.
P INPUT id=text1 name=text1 tabindex='1' size="20"
maxlength="20" /label /P
Press Alt+2 to set focus to the radio button.
Press Alt+3 to set focus to the radio button.
Press Alt+4 to set focus to the checkbox button.
Press Alt+5 to set focus to the checkbox button.
Thanks!

This is browser dependent, and for GUI browsers should follow the
host operating environment's user interface guidelines. For
Windows 98, it is the space bar once the control has focus, and the
tab key to give focus.
Alt is operating system and hardware dependent; only PCs normally have
ALT keys. It is also potentially browser dependent.
If the wording was purely for this posting, I would argue that focus and
textbox are programmers' terms, not users' terms.
Nope, you're doing stuff right except assuming that alt+key makes accesskey
work - for example on Amaya it is usually some other modifier, and for iCab
the key on its own is used (and activates the link it is attached to - this
is according to specification, which was a bit vague on whether it was a good
idea...). (iCab actually shows the accesskeys itself, as any sensible
implementation would enable, for example by using CSS.
There is a key to select checkboxes and radio buttons - in Netscape I think
it is space but I am not sure.

Mozilla has switched from alt to ctrl for Linux, according to the release
notes for version 0.9.3 (released today).
