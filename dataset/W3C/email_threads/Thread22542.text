First a quick thank-you to Don Park for his initiative. Here are some
more issues ...
1. What should the behaviour of,
HTMLTableRowElement.getRowIndex()
HTMLTableRowElement.setRowIndex()
be where the relevant row is not in the tree?
2. What should the behaviour of,
HTMLTableRowElement.getSectionRowIndex()
HTMLTableRowElement.setSectionRowIndex()
be where the relevant row is not in the tree,
or not a child of a table section element.
3. What should the behaviour of,
HTMLTableCellElement.getCellIndex()
HTMLTableCellElement.setCellIndex()
be where the relevant cell is not in the tree?
4. What should the behaviour of,
HTMLOptionElement.getIndex()
HTMLOptionElement.setIndex()
be where the relevant option is not in the tree?
5. Exactly which element types are returned by
HTMLFormElement.getElements()? All control
elements (eg. including LABEL , FIELDSET
etc. elements) or just the INPUT , BUTTON ,
TEXTAREA , ISINDEX and SELECT elements.
6. According to the HTML 4.0 spec, some elements have
a case-insensitive name attribute, whereas others
have a case-sensitive name attribute. Should
HTMLDocument.getElementsByName() and
HTMLCollection.getNamedItem() respect this
distinction?
I've also got one query on REC. Unlike all the other
HTMLCollection attributes, HTMLTableRowElement.cells
is not readonly ... is this a typo?

I wasn't aware that there was anything in HTML4 that had a case-sensitive
name; could you provide an example or two?

Unless stated otherwise, all opinions are solely those of the author.
Following attributes in the HTML layer will likely be made read-only:
HTMLOptionElement.index
HTMLCellElement.cellIndex
HTMLRowElement.rowIndex
HTMLRowElement.sectionRowIndex
HTMLRowElemetn.cells
It is not clear what their value should be when they are not in the relevant
context (not in the tree or not inside appropriate ancestors). Docuverse
DOM SDK uses -1 to represent the middle finger. g
I forget where I got the list from but Docuverse DOM SDK returns: button,
fieldset, input, isindex, label, legend, object, option, select, textarea.
It depends on the the collection. Frankly, I missed this bit of 'finesse'
in the DOM SDK.
See above.
Best,

Neither was I, until a couple of weeks ago when I started
going through the spec with a fine-tooth comb.
From the spec:
Case insensitive:
BUTTON
FRAME
IFRAME
INPUT
MAP
OBJECT
PARAM (language dependent)
SELECT
TEXTAREA
Case sensitive:
A
APPLET
META
PARAM (language dependent)
I found the easiest way to track this down was via the
'Index of Attributes' section.
