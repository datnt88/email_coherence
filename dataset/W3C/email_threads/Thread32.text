Mike Bridge on Tidy:
I would like it not to touch
the indenting/linebreaking scheme that's already there.
Dave Raggett has explained in http://www.w3.org/People/Raggett/tidy/ why this
isn't and won't be an option. (Look for the subtitle "Layout style".)
Our web designer informs me that this will create subtle browser-specific
formatting problems, for example, closing and opening TR and
TD tags must be on the same line when they enclose adjoining images,
otherwise browsers will put some extra space between the cells,
Are there any other problems? If not, it would be easy to run a
search-and-replace to remove these line breaks. (Since I use MS-DOS/Windows
and am too lazy/stupid to program, my preferred tool is a compact and cheap old
version of SNR; a big new GUI version of this can be downloaded from
"console-mode" version. With UNIX, I'm sure you're spoiled for choice.)

The "indent" option appears to take care of our designer's
immediate concerns (yeesh, how did I miss that in the
documentation!).
I'm still paranoid about the idea of normalizing our HTML code
at all, because of the general crappiness of both IE and Netscape.
God knows what kind of formatting wackiness that proper HTML tags
will cause.
But like you say, we can always do some pre/post processing to fix
these. Tidy seems to do such a good job on our files that it
seems a shame not to use it just because it creates correct code!
Thanks!

We are looking at creating an XHTML version of our HTML and I
was trying out html-tidy. It looks very cool, but the one
problem I see is that I can't find a way to limit the layout formatting
of the resulting page. Specifically, I would like it not to touch
the indenting/linebreaking scheme that's already there. Our web
designer informs me that this will create subtle browser-specific
formatting problems, for example, closing and opening TR and
TD tags must be on the same line when they enclose adjoining images,
otherwise browsers will put some extra space between the cells,
e.g.
tr td img src="whatever.jpg" /td td img src="somethign
else" /td /tr
instead of
Is there any way to do this in html-tidy, or is it possible
to add an option to do this?
Thanks!

You can avoid these problems by setting the indent option to no
or auto. In the latter mode Tidy is careful to avoid breaking the
line before the /td if the content is purely inline.
