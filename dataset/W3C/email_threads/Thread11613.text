Hi W3C translators.
I'm translating "Accessibility Features of CSS" into Japanese.
This work is about 60% finished.
That's great news! I look forward to the translation. We do
not generally have the good fortune of having people
translate our Notes, and so I did not plan ahead by
including a link in the document to a page of translations.
Therefore, when you have finished, I will publish a new draft
of the Note that includes a link to yours and future translations.
Thank you,
- Ian
