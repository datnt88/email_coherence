I thought we decided to remove all priorities (e.g. replaced them with
X) until we work out new definitions for priority and until we apply
these definitions to all checkpoints.
Also, in the current definition of checkpoint/priority I would want to
see the emphasis put on the 'Ensure that content produced by the tool
is accessible" part, not the "Accessible environment" part.
For instance:
A checkpoint answers the question "What must/should/may I do to make
an authoring tool (and the content it produces) accessible?"

A checkpoint answers the question "What must/should/may I do to make
an authoring tool produce accessible content (or be accessible to
all authors)?"
Or for the [Priority 1] definition, instead of:
This checkpoint must be implemented by authoring tools, otherwise one
or more groups of users with disabilities will find it impossible to
access some function of the tool, or some content produced by
it. Satisfying this checkpoint is a basic requirement for some
individuals to be able to use the authoring tool or its output.

We gave Priority X to everything which we thought had not had some
dicussion of priority. All priorities are still (like everything else)
open for negotiation - see the status section of the document.
I disagree with putting the focus on one or other aspect of accessibility.
Although I feel that in teh big world it is more important that all tools
produce accessible ooutput than that all tools are accessible, a decision
like that is beyond the scope of the group, whose charter is to provide
guidelines on how authoring tools can be accessible in both areas.
My suggestion with the deifinition of checkpoints would be to remove the
parnethese altogether, or to change the wording in parenthese from (and
the content it produces) to (including the content it produces)

How can items be prioritized when all the problems/solutions aren't known?
It causes re-discussion of priorities every time something new comes in.

It is correct that changing the document by adding or removing something
may change the priorities of various parts of the solution. However it
seems to me important that we give an approximate statement of priority in
working drafts. Thus for each working draft there is an indication of
what priority a given checkpoint has within the framework outlined by that
working draft. My experience is that in fact the changes in priorities
required by the introduction of new material are fairly small.
This is certainly open to discussion by the members of the group.
