Hi all,
I'm using a-prompt to test a page that has nested tables. I'm looking to
see what the recommended techniques are in ERT. All I see is a link to
Michael Cooper's comment [http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/IG/ert/issues52.htm].
I don't have a good solution, but it seems that a non-HTML aware user
should be able to associate the nested table with the appropriate
headers/rows from the parent table.
Dream:
When a user of a WYSIWYG decides to insert a table into a page. They are
asked, "what will this table be used for? is it a table of data or is it
to position images and text on the page?" Depending on what the user
selects, they are lead through a series of questions to get the appropriate
information from them.
The whole nested tables section of this would be interesting. I haven't
thought much about how it would work.
thoughts?

We really haven't discussed the repair of tables yet and it's going to be a
big issue.
Can we try to finish off the BLINK/MARQUEE before moving on?

certainly - we can finish up blink and marquee first. I just want to get my
thoughts out there. We can check it off as an open issue and come back to
it later.
Just curious - I thought we were going through the document in order. Are
there other checkpoints that have been skipped?

Each technique in the ERT has a 'Discussion Status' field that tells whether
we have discussed the technique on the list or not. Most of the techniques
are 'awaiting discussion' and the ones that have been discussed are labeled
'under discussion'.
We are not going through the document in order of technique. We started
discussing techniques that were thought to be easy to reach agreement on in
the hope that we could quickly get through a large number of techniques.
This strategy hasn't been entirely successful because even the 'easy'
techniques still require a significant discussion.
