I think I had mailer problems. So this is a re-transmission.

Tim's invitation for manifestoes was too good to pass up, for the
manifestly inclined...
The W3C has an ongoing URN process, that is now (finally) bearing fruit.
There are IETF drafts in place for syntax and an initial resolution
mechanism. FPIs will be "grandfathered" into the URN namespace, so that
every FPI will have an equivalent URN, and if we get the resolutin services
working within the framework, they will be resolvable over the web.
So, my new suggestion for FPIs is that we not worry about the special
SGMl syntax for them, but correct the String "URL" in the XML document to
read "URI". A URI is a Universal Resource Identifier (URL _or_ URN). The
IETF is recasting specs to refer to URI's instead of URLs anyway, in
anticipation of URNs becoming real. Now we can have FPIs if we want, with
no special syntax requirements, and with no additional work for
implementors who implement URN resolution services in their applications.
Easy, no?

That was my idea too, but it would encompass URCs, and I'm not
sure that we want to get into resolution by URCs (bags-o-metadata).
One might better point to a URC by an URL or URN.
URNs would be PUBLIC, not SYSTEM, I would think.

I agree about URCs being fishy... still, we're only on the hook if someone
thinks they've solved the URC problem (which is a small worry for the near
future).
Well, they ought to be, but my point was that the sentiment against PUBLIC
could carry the day and we will still be alright (assuming that the URN:
prefix goes through). I mean from an SGML point of view URNs are SYSTEM
(because they're not native to SGML itself). I tend to agree that encoding
FPIs as URNs in a SYSTEM identifier is kinda weird, but then the whole web
is kinda weird...
