Would an iterator make sense in the DOMConfiguration? That would
allow the properties to be discovered dynamically, instead of
hardwiring strings like "canonical-form" in applications. Or perhaps
a getNextProperty()?

I think that would make a really nice addition. Not sure how widely
it would actually be used, however.

I'm writing a Java application which allows user to create an XML
document via a GUI, and one of the requirements is to view the
document in human readable form. Making use of the
'format-pretty-print' property. Unfortunately, Xerces-J-2_5_0 has not
fully implemented this yet...
Thanks,

Iterator I guess the DOM way would be something like
DOMStringList getPropertyNames();
In our application the use case is that we have a graphical tool that on
loading/ saving XML files shows all the DOM Load/ Save properties with
checkboxes, everything about that form is dynamic apart from determining
the list of properties. Once you have a property name you can determine
whether it's a boolean property, default value and what is supported
etc.
Kind regards,

We added a read-only attribute parameterNameList, of type DOMStringList,
on the DOMConfigurationList. This gives you the possiblity of iterating
through the parameter names supported by the object. Note that this list
can also contain parameter names defined outside the specification.,
i.e. extensions provided by the implementation.
