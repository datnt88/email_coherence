From reading the RFC2518, it's not clear to me that
if I'm using a delete method to remove a non-collection
resource, is it possible that server still returns a multitasks
response?
Is there a method that if my resource is a non-collection type,
I'll be guaranteed that a multitasks response will never be
returned?
Thx,

Stanley,
I think it is *unlikely* that you'll get a 207 on a non-collection. However,
I wouldn't rely on that, and no, there's no way to enforce a specific server
behaviour.

RFC2518 isn't clear on this, but implementations definitely do return
multistatus in response to operations on single items. It's a single code
line for the server, rather than two. So the cat's more or less out of the
bag on this one.
