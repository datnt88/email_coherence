Hello all,
Some links about the new Amaya release are broken. They will be available
tomorrow morning (French time).
Thanks,
Laurent Carcone
The WinXP version does not seem to be on the HTTP server. I had to
download with FTP.

Hello Amaya team
Thank you for this new release of Amaya, I appreciate the effort made on
editing svg graphics which are now usable and can be open strightforward
in mozilla (with native svg support).
But using the french dialogs I got a strange behavior : some of the menu
and menu entry label have desapered ! (no more Edition, D?faire, ...)
(As I write I assume it is entries using accentuated chars).
(using amaya_gtk 8.5 rpm on fedora core 1)
I also noticed a bug when editing svg :
- When moving an object, the svg container box get a null height (as in
element does not have room for the orange rect to fit in. (see
Thanks for the good job !

It's strange because the file was put on ftp and http servers half an hour before
I sent the message.

It could be a problem with the font used to display these menu.
But it could be also a problem with your GTK settings (see $HOME/.gtkrc).
We'll fix this bug as soon as possible.

Hows the DAV support with the new release?
Do we have to do anything special other than --with-dav during configure?
Normally no except to have a WebDAV server.
Also is the Motif support still in?
Can Amaya be used with _just_ Motif (i.e. without GTK)?
We're stopping the support of Motif and we're developing a new version
based on wxWidget.

Hi,
I have just - after a few old document cache hits on the way -
downloaded the gtk rpm version
amaya_gtk-8.5-1.i386.rpm
and freshened with rpm.
Before (apparently) completing it reports
/bin/ln: `/usr/bin/amaya': File exists
execution of amaya_gtk-8.5-1 script failed, exit staus 1
However, the new version seems to be running quite happily! Perhaps
there is a minor glitch somewhere?
