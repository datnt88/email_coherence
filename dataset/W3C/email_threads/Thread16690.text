Hi,
I am trying to find an accessible chat program to install on a site I am
working on. I have found some that are perl-base (and therefore tweakable),
but all seem to be dependent on meta-refresh.
Any ideas?
Thanks,

Hi Dave,
have you thought about using IRC? There are a lot of clients available on
different systems. Do other people have experience with trying to use IRC?
It is proposed as a possibility for the AU group, in the event that someone
joins who cannot take part in telephone meetings, and it has been used in the
WCAG group a bit.

They would have to use Refresh (non-standard) HTTP headers or the meta
equivalent, or Javascript, if they were implemented with HTML; in my view
scripting is an even worse option than Refresh. The web has a pull,
user controlled, model of operation, but chat is designed for a push
mode of operation, which really needs the use of proper chat protocols.
Refresh was basically invented to simulate push (and actually marketed as
"server push" technology) to shift the balance away from the user to the
author, whilst not changing web servers, or requiring firewall policies
to be relaxed. As well as philosophical considerations, by polling the
server, it puts an unnecessary load on the network.
You should use an appropriate technology, remembering that the original
aim of the web was to help locate resources of multiple forms, not to
do everything using HTTP and HTML.
(I've not freqented web chat servers, but I'm pretty sure that the only
reasons that forums were created were:
- NNTP doesn't provide a means of adding advertising;
- USENET makes it difficult (for good reasons) for ad hoc group creation.)
I have used a chat program that implements a server push -(actually flush()
in PHP). The client side only sees the HTML so it works pretty well with
screen readers - the big drawback is that some browser/platform combinations
don't respond to the push.
Marti
Modern web servers should not react to flush, or should only do so if you
take positive steps to de-optimise them.
For dynamic content, a modern (HTTP 1.1) server, should either supply a
length for the whole response (requires the whole response be available
before any is returned) or should should break the response up into
chunks, each of which has a defined length. Very small chunks are
not a good thing, so I wouldn't expect a server to generate them.
If you deny the server these mechanisms, it cannot handle pipelined requests,
as there is no way for the client to identify where one response ends and
the next starts.
What you are doing is basically a hack relying on implementation details,
not on any defined behaviour for the HTTP protocol. If you want a
real push, you must use a protocol that handles the push end to end.
For chat, these protocols are decades old, even though the "instant
messaging" branding of the feature is new.
(Note the technique also requires that tables not be used, or that you
restrict yourself to IE5 or better, and use style sheets to force
incremental rendering of the table.)
I'd second this; I looked into the issue several years ago and
the benefit of using IRC is that it's been around a long time and
it's relatively non-proprietary. This means that there have been
people with disabilities successfully (to varying degrees) using
IRC for quite some time, and it also avoids the problem with most
chat systems of having to relearn the entire system for each site
you visit.
I'm not saying it's a perfect solution, but since there are few if
any standards for interactive chat, and no known accessible standards,
it may be the best we can do today.
Hey, there's a question -- why hasn't the W3C specifically addressed
the issue of chat services over the web/Internet and the accessibility
and interoperability thereof?
Politics, maybe?

Maybe it's never been brought up. If David is just raising the issue now, and most of the people on this list are at the forefront of Web accessibility issues then there's a good chance it's either never been discussed or no one's taken the initiative to try and address it.
Except that's not really the case, e.g. hitting the WAI IG
archives:
Jutta, Chaalz, and David Poehlman all contributed to that thread
almost 2 years ago. There are other references to this topic as
well on WAI lists.

I would have thought there were few accessibility issues with the service,
only with the clients (which may correlate with the service if it uses
a closed protocol).
Even the addressing is fairly flexible, e.g. British Telecom market a
directory service for NetMeeting that uses telephone numbers (they think
that people will already be familiar with these, so there is no learning
cost for the general public).
The Japanese Society for Rehabilitation of Persons with Disabilities (JSRPD)
is working on development of accessible IRC chat software to invite
deaf-blind users to "the real time caption service of TV broadcasting on the
net".
"The real time caption service of TV broadcasting on the net" is an
achievement of the disabilities community in Japan as a result of the
revision of the Copyright Law in 2000. Information Centers for the Deaf and
JSRPD are officially entitled to distribute the real time caption of the TV
program through IRC chat.
If we could develop accessible IRC chat system for deaf-blind people, they
may extend their currently most limited real-time information sources.
I strongly suggest to include "accessible chat software development" as one
of the target issues of WAI.

Resources. They fall under the rubric of authoring tools (quite a lot does it
seems). Which is why the people who have talked about it before include the
people who are chair and staff contact of the authoring tools group, I guess.
As a matter of fact, that is one of the areas that the working group is
sarting to look at in a bit more depth at the moment, particularly in
relation to the kind of "integrated systems" that you find for doing online
education, or total content management - the stuff that used to be intranet
software until people started putting everything over the web.
So far I am sad to say that we don't have a lot of results. It seems that IRC
is a good basis to work from, since it is widely available. Looking at the
accessibility of it is something I would like to have more time or
information available for. (A sideline is looking at systems that include
features like "virtual whiteboards" - collaborative real-time graphics
creation, or audio/video telephony - this has proved very valuable in the
results of an investigation as part of a project called Deaf Australia
Online).
Watch the Authoring Tools space (or contribute to it! grin/ )

Hiroshi,
Accessible chat software is one of the areas that comes under the Authoring
Tool Accessibility Guidelines most directly. Recently the group has begun
looking more at the range of tools we are addressing.
I would be interested in what results or thoughts you have from this project
- please feel free also to post them directly to the Authoring Tools working
group - w3c-wai-au@w3.org and read the archives at
Cheers

There is a mail messaging and call center product called eshare. This has
an HTML interface option for chat. If the HML were designed properly this
would seem to be accessible. Need to consider the tools the call centers
are using such as, egain, kana, siebels, clarify. If they can render HTML
and I think they can, then they should work for chat - as long as the code
is compliant. The beauty here is the contact information is maintained and
less agent time is required as well as it can provide integrated cross sale
and up sale functionality
