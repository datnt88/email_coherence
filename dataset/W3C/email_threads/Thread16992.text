hardly "accessible" the software solutions MUST be OS system
independent
Good grief, can't we at least recognize that Macromedia is moving in the
right direction? I'm not flaming Bob, but all too often on this list people
are complaining about how a web site or a product falls short of being
accessible in some way or another, even though people are trying very hard
to make things as accessible as possible.
I'm not about to suggest that we all run out and start using Flash, but I
think this is certainly a sign of good things to come. I'm very interested
to see what Flash MX has to offer.

Yep, I agree wholeheartedly with your sentiments, however, you would have thought that if those involved with accessibility had been asked then this kind of thing could have been avoided and the new Flash software would have been accessible to all - the purpose of this list is to make websites and all that they entail "accessible to all". I will also address the other issue that you have just replied to in that I am not attacking microsoft or its supposed monopoly, I am just saying that if we look to include everyone (disabled, able, Mac, PC, computer literate, non-computer user, etc, etc) then these issues are important. I was using the Mac thing as an illustration of a point, not dissing MS nor anyone else either.
I am interested in any software or hardware that can make websites accessible to all, but it still begs the question: why was the software not available across more platforms - perhaps Apple didn't want to help, perhaps no one was asked and MS just got in there first. There is no right or wrong in this discussion, I am only attempting to relate this thread to the overall accessibility issues that affect everyone on this list and a great many more.
Kind regards to all

I agree with you, I really do. And I'm not saying that your comments
weren't warranted either, I just wanted to remind people that more goes into
a software maker's decisions that just accessibility. And I didn't
necessarily think that your were attacking Microsoft. I threw those
comments in there so as to avoid the usual debate that arises.
I just get tired of hearing people on the WAI list finding faults with
everything, rather than trying to help find solutions. If the people on
this list worked harder to educate, rather than criticize, then I think
accessibility would be taken more seriously.

I use a Macintosh and it is bad enough not being able to see many
websites because they are coded for the Microsoft users of this
world.
I don't know what you're talking about. HTML is HTML. You can even
watch Windows Media files on Macs if necessary. (And please, no
complaints that I'm talking out of my hat. I've been using Macs since
the day they came out and Windows since version 3.1.) Mac IE,
Mozilla, and iCab all handle allegedly-Windows-specific HTML quite
handily.
Care to name five different sites you cannot use *at all* on a
Macintosh? I suppose Java applets could be examples, but that's a
stretch.
So, should I buy a new PC with all the latest kit just so I can
'see' this latest and greatest Flash website? I think not, and I
don't think that I should be forced into doing so.
Unbeknownst to you, Microsoft actually *has* a system-wide
accessibility infrastructure (Microsoft Active Accessibility). Mac OS
does not, as I explained at length in my Tidbits series:
http://db.tidbits.com/getbits.acgi?tbser=1189 .
I know for a fact that Macromedia *wants* to make accessible Flash
work cross-platform, but faced with the task of writing its own
access infrastructure on Mac, they *wisely* opted to take the easy
path first. Get the thing working on one platform and then worry
about making it cross-platform.
Flash is *already* platform-dependent. I suppose you want Macromedia
to also create Flash for DOS.
One last thing: has anyone on the list tested this software?
Yes, several of us have.
Ahem, excuse me! $795, plus the cost of Windows, plus the cost of
hardware capable of running windows! Not to mention the serious
hassle of mopping up each new "virus"!! How the **** is that
supposed to be "accessible" to any but a tiny minority of the
richest blind people?
Technology costs. Get used to it. And anyway, screen readers are
aimed at workplace use: JAWS technically stands for Job Access with
Speech. US$795 is affordable for many companies, and in any event is
deductible or depreciable.
Oh, but wait a sec-- you want the whole shebang (computer, operating
system, screen reader) to be free just because you're blind? How
amusing.

and our whole office is Linux/Unix (not to mention Linux at home)
and movies are movies, but some are captioned/described HTML is about as
close to universal as you can get but it still takes an OS to interpert
the signals and operate the access software
I don't know about that but I can name hundreds that won't work on text to
speech browsers
So, should I buy a new PC with all the latest kit just so I can
'see' this latest and greatest Flash website? I think not, and I

that is MS system wide, try it on any other OS
or more likely there is less profit in Unix/Linux/BSD/Mac/etc
and to get the MS code you have to sign away your rights to building
anything cross platform
how about for something that is used in the business world, like Unix

or any company that has a large vested interest in a more flexible or job
specific OS
well I work on one of the Open Source Software Access project (one of
many) and what we have avaliable so far is essentially no cost.
no but just because one is blind (or otherwise disabled) doesn't make em a
"mark" or sucker either

well it is the old, "are you on the inside looking out, or the outside
looking in....???" if they put ramps at ten buildings but the guy in
the wheelchair wants into the eleventh he doesn't care about what they did
to the other ten, it is the one he needs that isn't accessible.
I wonder how hard their trying, why invent new ways to modify people with
disabilities when the method to make the site accessible already exists,
there is nothing wrong with people with disabilities so why is everyone
trying to make them use half asssed jury rigged stuff to use something
made to be inacccessible.
the problem isn't with the operating systems it is with the attitude of
the web site makers.!
yeah I'm interested in seeing what they have to offer, but I don't even
want it....just put the text alt in the website and be done with it.
it's getting to be like if everytime the auto makers came out with a new
model they changed the gas tank filler and you had to buy a new car to be
able to fill it with gas, or at least some new adapter!! STANDARDIZE dang
it...what is wrong with ASCII text??? there isn't an operating system
anywhere in the world that cannot use it. (that I am aware of anyway)

Key word: people.
If Macromedia were "trying very hard" to make Flash accessible, then it
would have been accessible and available on every platform long ago.
What amazes me about reactions on this list is not that some people
complain, but that others rush to defend mega-corporations for making
trivial progress. Then again, the ability of human beings to live in
denial of the obvious never ceases to astonish me.
Here is a little story. Remember those old science fiction tales, the
ones where humanity invents thinking machines and then the machines take
over? The latest in the series were probably the Terminator movies.
Well, those machines were invented several centuries ago, and perfected
in the nineteenth century. And they've since taken over, though the
process was so slow and gradual that most human beings grew to accept it
as natural.
The reason we have trouble recognizing that we are now slaves to our
machines is because the machines in question have no physical form. They
are abstract entities: legal machines. They are called corporations.
Corporations are immortal. They have the same legal rights as a person,
which means, in effect, that they have more legal rights than any
person. They are predators, and the larger and stronger they grow, the
more effectively they can crush any resistance and swallow up the
competition.
Corporations exist for only one purpose: to make a profit. They will
destroy anything in their pursuit of profit, because they have no other
values. In order to prevent or limit this destruction, they must be kept
under control by strong governments, but now they have grown stronger
than any government, and so the pace of destruction increases worldwide.
Inside every corporation are people. Since corporations are inanimate,
abstract entities, they must use people to have any effect at all. When
corporations are still babies, those people may have some effect on the
actions of the corporation. But when a corporation grows large, then the
efforts of its people are overwhelmed by the sheer momentum of the
corporation as a whole.
If you think that this is a radical philosophy, then you are mistaken.
It is not radical and it is not a philosophy. It is a simple statement
(albeit a somewhat colorful one) of the truth.
That Macromedia has come this short distance indicates that there are
probably several people at Macromedia who've been working very hard to
accomplish this. It is to those people, not to Macromedia the abstract
legal entity, that we owe our thanks and support. Instead of ascribing
the progress made to the machine, let's find out who at Macromedia is
behind this progress and publicly thank them for what must have been a
difficult struggle. We need to encourage people, not "corporations."
And while we are encouraging those individuals who have fought to get
the corporation to do something right, we should be chastizing the
corporation itself (and corporations in general) for not doing enough.
But then if we really want to change the world, we need to rethink
corporations themselves. There is no reason that we can't create legal
entities that will strive to better life for everyone on this planet.
It's all in how they're constructed. A better world is possible.
But given the remarkable ability of humans to live in denial, I'm not
holding my breath.

I think what he wants is equal access. Poor fool! Doesn't he realize
that being blind makes him a second or third class citizen, not entitled
to the same rights that we superior sighted folks have?
Supplicants should remember their place.
How amusing indeed.

well this list I thought was to address the technical problems, that is
sometimes done by identifying the problems, has to be done first to find
the solutions.
believe me we (I) sure do

BTW the list sure is slow tonight, messages I post I don't see for 5-6
hours
