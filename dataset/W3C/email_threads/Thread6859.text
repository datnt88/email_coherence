Okay maybe you can help me I'm stuck:
taking the XML 2e xml as the example and more precisely the
production NT-doctypedecl:
( nt def="NT-S" S /nt nt def="NT-ExternalID" ExternalID /nt )? nt def="NT-S" S /nt ?
('[' ( nt def="NT-markupdecl" markupdecl /nt | nt diff="chg" def="NT-DeclSep" DeclSep /nt )*
']' nt def="NT-S" S /nt ?)? ' ' /rhs vc def="vc-roottype"/ wfc def="ExtSubset"
diff="add"/ com loc role="erratumref" href="http://www.w3.org/XML/xml-19980210-errata#E109" [E109] /loc /com
the child sequence of prod is lhs-rhs-vc-wfc-com
lets look at the template handling rhs
xsl:apply-templates
select="following-sibling::*[1][name()='com' or
name()='constraint' or
name()='vc' or
name()='wfc']"/
the when matches it generates the td, the code then goes the apply-templates
that's where I don't understand, the select section returns only
the vc, excluding the wfc and com from being processed. Those are IMHO
excluded due to the first [1] filter.
Where I'm puzzled is that the spec HTML version is anyway correct, it
has the references for the external subset WFC.
I checked both the old version of the XSL linked from the spec and
the new version in CVS at dev.w3.org, both have the [1] predicate.
I'm puzzled, I can't see what I missed, any enlighening would be extremely
welcome.
thanks,

Okay I finally realized it was handled by the apply-templates of the
prod parent, sorry for the noise.

true, but the later siblings are picked up by the template for the
parent:
xsl:apply-templates select="
*[self::lhs or
( (self::vc or self::wfc or self::com) and
not(preceding-sibling::*[1][self::rhs]) or
(self::rhs and not(preceding-sibling::*[1][self::lhs]))
)]"/
