Amaya 2.4 (Linux) crashes with message "*** Thot: Irrecoverable error ***"
when I try to save a URL (select File- Save as, press Confirm, press Confirm
button in "http://... already exists. Overwrite it?" window).
URL is on a web server on which I don't have write permission.

Thanks Karl-Michael,
The problem is a dialogue message that is being used as a sprintf. It
needs an argument and none is being passed to it.
The problem exists on all Amaya versions and occurs whenever you try to
apply a server unauthorized method to a URL, like saving when you don't
have the rights.
The solution is to edit the faulty dialogue message.
You have to find the directory that says Amaya/config. In that directory,
there are a number of dialogue files *-amayamsg, where * is en, fr, de ...
Open the file you're using (depending on your language), look for line
112 and change it from:
112 This method is not allowed for %s
to
112 This method is not allowed
You have to quit Amaya, but you don't need to recompile.
I commited this patch to the cvs base.

Thanks Roberto.
I had changed this line in all the languages when I fixed the bug. I'm
happy to see that my fixup is the same one as yours even thought I don't
speak Italian. I'm not so sure about my tr-amayamsg change, though :)

Hi Roberto,
Thanks a lot.
Irene.
