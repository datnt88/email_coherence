Hi Guys:
Sorry to bother you. A small request. I am working in the IT department of a
Pharma research institute. I am new to the software field and I am interested
in trying out XML programming in Java (Using DOM). But there is no scope for
such kind of works in my working place. I tried out a few examples from IBMs
website but i would like to invole myself in a project so that i can learn
about XML-Java programming better. Can any of you suggest a few projects in
XML programming in Java so that i can try out by myself. All suggestions are
welcome.
regards

Anyone know of a particularly good book or website for DOM XML programming
examples and exercises? I don't have any recommendation rignt now, and that
seems to be what Bansi is looking for.
Basically, any kind of data processing that you might perform on other
structured data can be performed on XML; whcih kinds are appropriate depend
on the kind of data you're using XML to represent.
I'd suggest that you start by asking yourself what kinds of document you
want to use XML for, and then what kinds of operations you want to perform
on those documents -- creating them, searching them, updating them,
comparing them, and so on. Then assign yourself some projects that reflect
those tasks.

Hi,
I need to read in a DTD from a file that is provided by a third
party. From the DOM created from this DTD I need to create a GUI which
will allow me to enter information into text boxes to insert into the
XML. For Example:
Start with:
(DTD)
Next Step is:
(GUI)
cdlib
cd + -
Artist |AnArtist________________| + -
Title |ATitle__________________| + -
Format |AFormat_________________| -
Description |ADescription____________| -
Next Step is:
(XML)
Unfortunately I need to develop this Application in Delphi :(. As you
see, the idea is to have an application that is fully dynamic. I have
found some XML parsing components, but they don't seem to allow you to
parse a DTD to create anything but a DOM Document Type. From here I am
unsure what the next step should be. I also here that the DTD section
of the DOM is likely to change greatly in level 3. Is the project just
a pipe dream :)? Any help would be appreciated.
Thanks,
David Charlton.
P.S. Sorry about the lenght of this e-mail. From my postings on other
groups I have found that a simple paragraph describing the problem just
doesn't show the big picture clearly enough.
