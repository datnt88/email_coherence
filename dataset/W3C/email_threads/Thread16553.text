ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE
Is there any option, when contacting the
webmaster fails, for dealing with a site that
claims AAA rating but fails priority 2 checkpoint
3.2 (valid syntax), short of publicly naming the
site? (It has more subjective problems too.)
Incidentally, I have seen nothing on this list since
Thursday.

I (and a few other people) have worked on different things required for
making conformance claims in RDF. If these are made on the web, and are
searchable (there is quite a lot of work being done to make sure this happens
for RDF) then it should become relatively simple to publish a discoverable
counter-claim. The question of whose claim to trust then is of course an
issue, but more a social one than a technical one, in my opinion.
