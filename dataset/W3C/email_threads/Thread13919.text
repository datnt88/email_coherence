Regarding check #7:
I do wonder if it is better to separate this out a little. All anchors need
text in one form or another. It doesn't matter if the text is in alt or
straight text, just so long as it exists. Perhaps a check: Anchor text
can't be empty. This would cover a href="#content" /a as well as missing
alt text in anchors.
Once this is covered, all you need to worry about with images is the
validity and then the common "bad alt" checks.
If a testing tool finds:
It should flag two errors:
1) anchor text empty (definite error)
2) missing alt text (possible error)
I'd like the missing alt text to be a positive error, but am not sure how
that will work.

This should be ok:
!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0
Transitional//EN""http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"
This should be ok:
!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0
Transitional//EN""http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"
a href="somewhere" img src="rex.jpg" alt=""/ img src="rex.jpg"
alt="Rex"/ /a
This should be ok (there are better examples, but you get the point here):
!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0
Transitional//EN""http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"
a href="somewhere" img src="rex.jpg" alt="Rex"/ img src="rex.jpg"
alt="the cat"/ /a
hi all,
I have a few questions about the anchor tag that arose from reading Chris' post.
Why is an empty anchor tag considered an error? Is it because it is syntactically incorrect, or is it because some user agents do not use them correctly?
Please include authoritative documentation in answering these questions, if possible.
Thanks

To clarify, this should be an empty anchor that contains an href attribute.
a href="http://www.boston.com" /a is valid, and in some cases will be
understandable to a screen reader user (as much so as a
href="http://www.boston.com" http://www.boston.com /a is). However, this
won't be understandable for many URIs, such as what you see on a database
generated site, nor will they be accessible to sighted users, or easy to
locate for keyboard users.

This check was in response to the WCAG 2 HTML technique 9.2 "Use text
equivalents for images which are used as links." [1]
The technique deals with images and (I think) is meant to solve the problem
that occurs when the author uses an image alone (no text) as the anchor. If
you can't see the image then you won't have any information about the link
destination.
The WCAG 2 HTML techs currently don't say anything about link text. The WCAG
1 requirement for not using meaningless link text (e.g. "click here") is
missing in the WCAG 2. So it appears that empty link text would be OK!?
Michael - Can you remind us what's happening the technique for link text?

if possible.
When an IMG is used as an anchor, you've got to have a text equivalent. But
what's the best way to implement the text equivalent?
Within the anchor:
Alt text:
Title on anchor:
Title on IMG:
Using all 4:
a title="cats" href="cats.html" img src="cat.jpg" alt="cats" title="cats"
/ cats /a
I tried this on Jaws 4.5 and it read the text fine no matter where it was.
When the text was on all 4 it only read the text twice.
I propose that there must be at least one place for the text. Doesn't matter
where and it can be on multiple places. Yes, it may be read more than once
if it occurs multiple times but it gives more flexability.
