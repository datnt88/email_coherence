Hi,
The Berkeley campus is considering different learning management systems
(LMS). As part of the evaluation process, they will be conducting
usability tests of different systems. The department doing the
evaluation is interested in running usability tests with disabled/blind
students and faculty as part of their process for selecting an LMS for
the campus. Does anyone know of other universities which have run
usability tests with disabled/blind people using LMS systems?
Thanks very much,
Scott
Are they eveluating the courseware that is delivered or the admininstration
system user interface and functionality?

Hi,
A usability testing technique I've found helpful for evaluating blind
people using web pages is to use the "thinking aloud" usability testing
methodology via a conference call. I'm exploring the idea of setting
up this type of conference call to do some usability testing of blind
people using a learning management system. If you would be interested
in participating in this conference call, please let me know.
Thanks very much,
Scott
