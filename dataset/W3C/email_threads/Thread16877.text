can someone tell me what
a[target="pop_up"]:after { content: "(This will open in a new window.)"; }
does, ie how one accesses this information?
and if it is working here http://www.peepo.com/alfy/music/c.html
jonathan
also for a guide to setting up pop-ups:
1) Use a browser with a strong CSS2 implementation, and which supports
frames, and doesn't have popups disabled by the user;
2) Code in a transitional version of HTML;
3) Code links that you want to pop up similar to:
One with a strong CSS2 implementation but frames unsupported or
popups disabled will still show the message but not pop up!
Specifically, as part of a CSS2 style sheet, the rule selects A elements
that have a target attribute with the value pop_up, and causes an additional
inline box to be inserted into the CSS rendering model, after the contents
of the A element, containing the text:
(This will open in a new window.)
and with other rendering attributes inherited from the A element box
(I'm not sure if this includes :active dependent ones).
On windowing, frames capable browsers with popups enabled, and no existing
frame called pop_up, such a link, when activated, will create a new window
for the content. (Subsequent uses will re-use the same window, unless it
is closed in the mean time.)
Frames related attributes and elements are not supported in strict versions
or in XHTML 1.1.
Please remember, to tell those using screen readers it is a pop-up. It
can be very confusing to figure out what in the world is going on.
Warmly,

Hi again,
Well, if I'm suppose to be getting a pop-up, I'm not. I'm using
Window-Eyes 4.2 Pro by GW Micro. (I personaly prefer Window-Eyes over
JAWS, but hey, we all have our likes and dislikes grin ) If you would
like, when I go to my friend's place (probably later today) I can use
their computer, which has JAWS on it. Just let me know.
Here is what I hear:
NOTE: quote marks represent what is coming out of my speakers. Anything
not in quote represents an action I took or an explanation.
"Link the peoplo home page" press down arrow
"Link music" press down arrow
"C" press down arrow
"Link Colplay" press down arrow
"Link Creg David" press down arrow
Then every time I hit the down arrow I here "Link" and a letter of the
alphabet.
I'm using I.E. 6.0 for Windows.
Hope that helps. Good luck!
Warmly,
Hy
Well screen reader users were my particular concern.
We've had a report on peepo.com, and this is one of the issues being
addressed.
Not having jaws, or knowing at this time how to configure it suitably, I
am looking for some qualified responses on whether our test page is
appropriate in this respect.
Has anyone visited http://www.peepo.com/alfy/music/c.html, and used a
screenreader, preferably jaws, and does it work?
equally, is there another method that will check if it is working, ie by
throwing up a dialogue, or sending to the status bar etc.
for instance in mozilla 1.1 the info: "this will open in a new window",
is written all over the screen, as a default(just installed today) and I
dont think this is appropriate.
thanks
