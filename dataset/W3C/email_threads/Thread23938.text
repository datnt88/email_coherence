So far, I've been only played with XForms action within select1 code. My
code looks for an xforms-value-changed event and takes some action.
Now I would like to do something similar but with an input field. My goal
is to have the value of my input copied to another field once the
xforms-value-changed event fires.
For example: I have 2 fields "field1" and "field2". Both contain peoples
names. On my form, an order form, I have to consider that field2 is editable
if the user takes a specific path thru the form. Both field1 and field2 are
required to exist and can not be nill.
My thought was to add an event to field1 that traps xforms-value-changed and
do a setvalue of field2. I also would add a group around field2
controlling when its input is active to the user.
All's well in my thoughts. Unfortunately, I don't seem to be able to use an
action inside of my input for field1. Has anyone accomplished this sort
of data copying using actions inside of inputs?
Thanks!

Greetings, xforms-activate was replaced by DOMActivate, but
xforms-value-changed should work as well for the scenario you describe.

Hello Robert, Roland and Raman ...
DOMActivate would be no good because it would occur prior to the user's
changes.
The following should work:
xf:setvalue
ev:event="xforms-value-changed"
ref="field2"
value="../field1"
/
Note that in xf:setvalue, the @value XPath is relative to the XPath in @ref
- which may be where you are having problems. This is not clear in the spec,
and is the subject of a forthcoming errata.

Mark
