Hello,
I believe what you are describing would be of extremely limited value in
terms of accessibility. Just about anyone with the ability to navigate to
your web page is already going to have the necessary equipment to display
your web page in the fashion desired, be that auditory or some other
means.
The small part of the population that wouldn't have such capabilities
would require some method of directly navigating to your site, not to
mention launching the web browser and getting connected to the net.

I'm new to the list and accessibility issues and will briefly introduce
myself. My name is Michelle Podd and I am a Web Designer in Canada for a
relatively new Internet company. I've been asked to research the issue of
Accessiblility for two reasons: the first is that we want to make all of our
sites accessible and second, we are creating a portal site for the purpose
of being a mass resource for people with vision and hearing impairments to
reach the many resources out there, to learn, to find SAP programming
schedules for their area, etc.
The infant site uses an audio embed with a Play / Stop area - the default is
Off. I believe it's purpose was to provide anyone, anywhere with the ability
to have the content read to them in a human-type voice (we use iSpeak from
Fonix Corp)without having to have any special hardware or software on their
end - besides a sound card and speakers, of course.
Anyway, in my research travels, I'm learning that disabled persons surfing
the web will most likely have what they need on their end to do so. Besides,
this equipment is used in all of their other computer applications - the
internet is just one of them.
This project recently fell in my lap and the manager who originally created
this vision is no longer with us so I'm not able to inquire about some of
the decisions he made. I'd like to provide quality guidance to my company as
well as meet the needs of the disabled web surfer.
So my question to the list is this: Is the use of an audio embed (with an
on/off switch) that reads the content of the web page a help or a hinderance
to accessibility? Is there an audience for this type of application?
Thank you in advance for your help in this matter.

Assuming it's coded sensibly, it's roughly neutral, but tends to be more
of a "help" than a "hindrance". It's usually true that most users with
special needs have assistive technology, but not always. There are certain
user groups -- e.g. people who can't read as well -- who could benefit
from what you describe.
The whole trick is in the "coding sensibly" caveat. ;)

As a partial answer to your question, you may want to refer to an article
written by Jeff Isom of WebAIM entitled "To Embed or Not To Embed - A
Comparison of Media Player Technologies ". This can at least help you with
the technicalities of the accessibility of the actual plug-ins that handle
the audio. You can find the article at:

I want to amend this.
It's usually true that most _blind_ users have assistive technology, or
at least that they would need it to get that far. Without some sort of
assistive tech (screenreader, etc) won't be able to get to your web site
in the first place; simply starting an application (such as a web
browser) would be next to impossible.
However, it's also usually true that most users who have _other_
disabilities likely _don't_ have an appropriate assistive technology
program or device. In this case, talking about the benefits of an
audio track, there are two groups who would benefit from such a
thing:
1. People who can't see the text.
2. People who can't read the text.
The first group are the blind users; these are the ones who _probably_
already have a solution, in the form of a screenreader (or Braille
terminal or whatever).
The second group includes a NUMBER of people -- adult non-readers,
people reading in a foreign language, children, and people with
cognitive disabilities that prevent them from being able to read
text easily, but who may be able to understand spoken words -- or
spoken words PLUS text -- easier than text alone.
These audiences overwhelmingly do NOT have access to screenreaders
and the like, and for those people, embedded audio would indeed
prove beneficial.
So while I make the correction above, I still stand by my suggestion
that you not remove this, as it could help some people.

I won't claim to be an expert but would be interested in hearing the
opinions of those with more professional/experiential backgrounds in the
areas of folks who can't read the text for reasons other than blindness.
The biggest thing folks in this category have told me is that they want
the text highlighted as it is read.
Do folks think this sort of audio reading would be good for a portal as
was original described I believe or for longer narrative texts.
It's even good for blind folk under certain circumstances. those who
have other print disabilities in some instances can be reinsforced by
this as they read the page highlight or not.

That's my main thought -- especially if you are able to deliver a
diverse multitude of user interfaces (oops, I sound like a Reef ad
again!), then you don't want to throw away ANY techniques which
could conceivably help _someone_.
You might throw them away based on cost or ROI issues, of course,
but that's a different topic and wasn't -- I believe -- the question
asked here?

I have been lurking for a while but this post asks something I even know
a few things about
I am an engineer over 50 who has used a computer for over 30 years and in
recent years I was having more and more problems.
well diagnosed with ADD at over 50 years old. BUT graphics enviorenment
was driving me nuts....seems that the plain old white on black text is
clear concise and exactly what the doc ordered.
I just want to be able to use the site...plain text no goodies cluttering
up things.
BTW, I use PINE as my e-mail client and LYNX as my browser.
still run either MSDOS or LINUX, and occasionall UNIX (don't do windoz or
macs).
personally I have unplugged the speaker on my computer
just another point of view

This would be helpful for a lot of folks on any kind of text. It is the link
between the spoken form and the written form that makes the difference.
When teaching kids to read a common strategy is to follow the words with a
finger, to reinforce the connection between something they half-understand
(the text) and something they may understand better, such as voice.
Interesting(?) aside: Reading silently is a fairly modern invention. Medieval
scriptioria (where books were copied by hand) were proably not the silent
places we imagine, as monks would typically read aloud for the same reasons
(although not at full volume necessarily grin/ ).

I am sympathetic to Bob's point of view, and so I use PINE and LYNX mostly
too, although I also use graphical browsers and WYSIWYG editors (I hate
reading source code because I get lost in too many characters at the same
time that aren't relevant to me).
It makes well-designed accessible media-rich sites into simple text sites
without distractions, which suits me fine. (If only there were more of them)

One pitfall to be wary of:
Embedding audio shouldn't be INSTEAD of designing the site to be accessible
to third-party assistive technologies. I've heard well-meaning developers
who are new to accessibility pitch that approach a few times...
