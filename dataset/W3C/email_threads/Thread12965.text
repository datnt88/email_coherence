A new (complete?) version of this appendix is now available from the usual
place (http://members.optushome.com.au/amja/wai/).
This version picks up all the recent discussion and contributions (thanks to
those who did email me with suggestions). The final links from the tables
have not been incorporated (nor have the linear tables been generated) -
this will be done after the content is 'signed off' as ready for public
comment.

Andrew, all,
the problem Sylvie is having with the summary of the table comes from the
fact you are using carriage returns for formatting the attribute visually
(#10 is the carriage return in ASCII or hex, I do not remember which one).
If you remove them, the problem will go.

Andrew, all,
This is my homework (ignoring spelling errors grin ). Actually these
are my 2 cents, so disregard whatever you feel to.
A general comment is that you mention all over the place "a master
stylesheet", when the reality is that there are more than one,
specially for huge websites. I would suggest to change that to plural.
* Section 1:
1st paragraph: last sentence "Web apps", I would say "web content".
2nd paragraph: "technical workings of your Web applications" should be
changed to "performance of your web services".
* Section 2-"Improve usability for non-disabled visitors":
Item: "Clear and consistent navigation", first element. I would add a
third element on the list of kicking-off factors: "a home page only
browsable through third-party plug-ins"
Item: "Device independence because of situational usage", I would say
"Device independence"
* Section 2-"Support for Low Literacy Levels":
1st paragraph: "the language of your website is not their first",
shall say "the language of your website is not their mother tongue".
1st Table:
I think there should be a "YES" in the crossing of "Device
Independence" and "Low Bandwidth".
That's all. I hope it helps.
Regards,

Hello All,
First just noticing various spelling issues waiting for the spell
check.
Under - support for the semantic Web -
Clear Content &amp; Text Alternatives I wrote this paragraph;
For Businesses the Semantic Web expands the market place through the clarity
of the meta data during seamless content management in all alternative
routes "anytime anywhere". Following the WAI guidelines ensures clear
alternative routes by way of the Semantic Web to textual meanings archived
in data bases.

Otherwise I agree with William the text stands by itself. I believe the
text is ready for wider review.
thank you
