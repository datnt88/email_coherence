To the people of WCAG,
Many sites use small buttons, menus or tabs that have text as images, e.g.
FAQs, Our Team, About Us, Consumer Products, Web Sites, Computers, Welcome,
News, How-to, Connect,
(this is a mixture from several web sites)
Do these pass the following priority 2 checkpoint? [1]
3.1 When an appropriate markup language exists, use markup rather than
images to convey information. [Priority 2] For example, use MathML to mark
up mathematical equations, and style sheets to format text and control
layout. Also, avoid using images to represent text -- use text and style
sheets instead.
I contend no, small image buttons/menus/tabs fail this checkpoint: since an
accessible markup exists, viz. ordinary HTML. Plus the last sentence
explicitly says to not use images for text.
Feasible methods exist. You can get rid of the link underline, and control
color and font with a stylesheet. Rectangular buttons are easy. If you
want something a bit fancier like rounded corners, it's straightforward to
piece together the text parts with slivers of images. That's a bit of a
kluge, but in balance I think it's better than making the whole thing text,
given the importance of that checkpoint to people with low vision, who can
otherwise simply enlarge the fonts and/or change the colors. (Loads faster
too).
I expect some objections to this position, since a number of well known
sites in the disability area use such images, so there are clearly folks who
didn't think this was a violation.
By the way, the one place I would allow text as images are in logos, where
there are substantial reasons for making the look exact.

This isn't an academic question for me: e.g. full WCAG is now Pennsylvania
State Policy, so we've got to know if image folkder tabs are "legal".

It would seem to me that the phrase 'Avoid using images to represent text'
does not equate to making such images prohibited.
I think that the spirit of these guidelines is to make sites accessible to,
but not necessarily designed strictly for, those with disabilities. All of
these sites (I believe) include plain text alternatives to those graphical
links at the bottom of the page. I think that most users expect text links
at the bottom of the page.
Also, the definition of Priority 2 reads:
"[Priority 2]
A Web content developer should satisfy this checkpoint. Otherwise, one or
more groups will find it difficult to access information in the document.
Satisfying this checkpoint will remove significant barriers to accessing Web
documents."
I think that scrolling to the bottom of the page is not a 'significant
barrier.'

By the way, on my personal web site (http://kynn.com/), I use
text + HTML + CSS to create a "WCAG button" instead of the
graphic provided by the WAI for that purpose.
Anyone want to argue that I've proven that the WAI graphic
itself violates this checkpoint? :) There _is_ definitely an
argument to be made, but I am not convinced of it. ;)

[DJW:]
As I see it, level 1 gives a lot of tolerance to
typical commercial use of HTML as a page description
language, but levels 2 and 3 require more and more
rigid adherence to the orginal philosophy of HTML as
an information markup language.
As such, the fact that this requirement is at level
two makes me think it is meant to be taken fairly
literally.
Modern HTML plus style sheets allows a lot of input
to the visual styling without having to use GIFs of
the text (although there are problems, like intellectual
property restrictions on scaleable fonts, and the lack
of a clean fallback mechanism for BUTTON elements, and
broken implementation of, at least, the latter).
Actually, even from the point of view of someone with
adequate vision and 128K+ access to the net, text as
graphics is almost always a barrier to access to the site
because of the time it takes to load on the first access
to the page.
[DJW:] It's definitely a barrier, and I would say
it was even a significant one - in any case, HTML
requires that the image have alternate text, which
should avoid that scrolling in text only mode.
I think you are taking a line that is halfway between
that which was intended by the guidelines, and that taken
by a couple of my colleagues when told about the Olympics
and AOL cases, namely that forcing commercial organisations
to support the last 20% of the market was an unwarranted
intrusion on their ability to operate their businesses.

Bobby only claims level 1 compliance.
It's load time is compromised by the images although
not as badly as many sites.

There are huge problems with using HTML + CSS as a substitute for
graphical buttons; namely, they don't work. CSS has yet to be
well-supported enough to be a legitimate substitute for textual
buttons out in the "real world", apart from the ivory towers of
research and scholarship.
CSS is unreliable, and the needs of web designers (and site
operators) to maintain a specific visual appearance cannot simply
be written off as unimportant. If we tell them that _their_
concerns are worthless (and they must use an inferior solution
to get limited results) then they will tell us that _our_
concerns are worthless and will not design with accessibility
in mind.
The more we say "don't do what you want to do, try this instead,
even though it doesn't work" the less credibility we have. If
we make unreasonable demands we will _not_ be listened to, and
I feel that the idea that _all_ textual images are "evil" is a
very unreasonable standpoint since there are no valid alternatives
which meet the needs of the visual designers.
That's not a barrier, that's simply poor use of your user
agent software. If you want a faster loading page, then don't
load images -- there's a switch on _your_ software to do this.
Most users do not consider download time as a "barrier" to
access; it is expected that web pages will take a while to
load, especially on relatively slow connections. Your suggestion
would seem to indicate that any graphics are a "barrier" because
they may add a few seconds to download time. That's unreasonable.
That's not a barrier; it's barely even a speedbump.
It's not a "barrier."
Your colleagues may be thinking realistically; such concerns
cannot simply be written off, they must be addressed.
They are not addressed by viewpoints such as "all graphical text
is inaccessible" which require the use of defective technology
to achieve poor results.

[DJW:] I tend to agree with this as well. CSS failed
to achieve its aims because there was no commercial
imperative to implement it completely and accurately,
but there was one to implement certain features. As
a result, it is one more thing that one was to allow
for and work round broken and incomplete implementations
that will mean that CSS will never fulfill its aims until
most current GUI browsers have disappeared.
(However, I'm fairly sure that custom fonts, one of the main
reasons for text as graphics, will degrade gracefully even
across broken CSS implementations.)
BUTTON was always ill conceived, because of the lack
of backward compatibility, and because the market had
already settled on less structured solutions, even
before IE4 mis-implemented it (I actually tested HTML
to be used for an exhibition in an HTML 4 only envrionment
on Lynx, and had the buttons work, only to find that they
didn't work with IE!) The market is also concerned about
backward compatibility to Netscape.

Later in the guidelines it says "avoid causing the screen to flicker"
[priority 1] to avoid seizures from photosensitive epilepsy. This suggests
that "avoid X" really does mean "don't to X".
I agree, but I don't think that using real text instead of a button is
designing strictly for people with disabilities, certainly in those cases
where the appearance is essentially the same.
Not all sites have the links at the bottom. For example,
site... in fact I think it's a good, clear layout. It's just like, as in
many sites, it missed the chance to use real text instead of images. Real
text would have made little visual difference... In fact, it would have
enhanced the look...the text would have been more crisp I think. Text
links at the bottom would have taken away from the visual appeal of the
page, another reason to simply use text in the menu bar.
And even if sites did use links, they are not as good as the buttons for
people who can see buttons, at least for sites with good visual
design. Well designed graphics organize the links in a way that a mere
unformatted rows of text links do not. For example, I think the layout of
activematter.com, including it's use of the folder tab metaphor is a good
example of how visual layout can help usability. I'd like to see the
benefits of that sort of good visual design available to as many people as
possible, including people with low vision.
