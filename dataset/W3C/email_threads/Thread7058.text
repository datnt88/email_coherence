"duri" and "tdb" URN namespaces based on dated URIs
1.1 Intrinsically Persistent Identifiers
Many people have wondered about how to create globally unique and
persistent identifiers. There are a number of URI schemes and URN
namespaces already registered. However, many of them lack an adequate
guarantee of both uniqueness and persistence.
We stray into murky waters here. What is meant by persistence?
How can a persistent URI be distinguished from a non-persistent one?
* permanent (the identity of the resource identified
is not subject to reinterpretation over time)
Interesting choice of words. What is an interpretation of the
identity of a resource? How can one tell whether the identity
of a resource has been 'reinterpreted'.
Can we make this a little clearer.
Let's assume for the purposes of argument, that I did an http get
on http://www.ietf.org at the first instant of the year 2000 and
the first instant of the year 2001, that no error occurred and that
the sequence of characters returned was not the same on the two
occasions.
Is it true that any time invariant property of
urn:duri:2001:http://www.ietf.org
is also a time invariant property of
urn:duri:2000:http://www.ietf.org
The two dates are intentionally different.
e.g. if the creation date of:
urn:duri:2001:http://www.ietf.org
is D, then is the creation date of
urn:duri:2000:http://www.ietf.org
also D. I don't mean logical entailment for any URI here, I'm
asking specifically about http://www.ietf.org.
Assuming its the resource not the respresentation that
urn:duri:2001:http://www.ietf.org
names, then, I'm trying to ask whether the two URI's
urn:duri:2001:http://www.ietf.org
urn:duri:2000:http://www.ietf.org
name the same resource.
The relations in RDF, however, may already provide for the "thing
described by" indirection. For example, the example in Section 3.2.1
of [RDF] claims the model for the sentence
"The students in course 6.001 are Amy, Tim and Mary"
would be written in RDF/XML as
rdf:RDF
rdf:Description about="http://mycollege.edu/courses/6.001"
s:students
rdf:Bag
rdf:li resource="http://mycollege.edu/students/Amy"/
rdf:li resource="http://mycollege.edu/students/Tim"/
rdf:li resource="http://mycollege.edu/students/Mary"/
/rdf:Bag
/s:students
/rdf:Description
/rdf:RDF
but the resources listed are web pages (served by HTTP) and the class
and students are the "things described by" those web pages.
This gets into more muddy water because the core of web architecture
isn't very well defined.
Is it possible to argue that:
does indeed name Mary, and what you get when you do an HTTP GET
on that URL is a representation of Mary?
Leaving aside, however sorting out what the properties of resources are,
I wouldn't write the RDF example above that way, as it is at best,
likely to confuse. Better would be:
which inserts extra resources to 'represent' the students as different
resources from their home pages.
Thus RDF does not need tbd; it has enough machinery to
handle the indirection required. Were there other applications you had
in mind?

"duri" and "tdb" URN namespaces based on dated URIs
My intuitions say that they denote the same resource,
namely the web location, but at different points in time.
Thus:
= A web location
urn:duri:2000:http://www.ietf.org
= The state of http://www.ietf.org at 2000-01-01T00:00:00Z
urn:duri:2001:http://www.ietf.org
= The state of http://www.ietf.org at 2001-01-01T00:00:00Z
Thus, one could say things that are time dependent about
the web location named by the URL such as the owner, security
settings, redirections, etc.
It doesn't, however, seem to achieve the intended purpose
of capturing a specific resource residing at that location
at a given point in time. To do so, one would need a variant
of the tdb: URI scheme, e.g. tla: "thing located at" and
use that in conjunction with the duri: scheme. E.g.
= A web location, where some resource may be accessible.
urn:tla:http://www.ietf.org
= A resource located at http://www.ietf.org
urn:duri:2000:urn:tla:http://www.ietf.org
= The resource located at http://www.ietf.org at 2000-01-01T00:00:00Z
urn:duri:2001:urn:tla:http://www.ietf.org
= The resource located at http://www.ietf.org at 2001-01-01T00:00:00Z
A URL (sorry for using an obsolete, classical term ;-) is the name of
a location. That location is itself a resource, and some other non-location
resource may reside at that location, and one may use the name of the
location as an indirect alias for the name of the resource residing
at the location, but the name of the location is not the same as
the name of the resource accessible from that location.
Consider the attached RDF/N3 statements, which describe some resources,
some of which are locations, some of which are resources accessible
from a named location, and some of which are abstract.
Note especially that each location resource and non-location resource
have a diffferent creator and title.
BTW: I don't see tdb: as being semantically distinct from duri:.
E.g. in the I-D it is stated:
"For example, "urn:tdb:2001:http://www.ietf.org" can be used to
designate the Internet Engineering Task Force organization, at least
as it was described by or referenced by its home page at the first
instant of 2001."
But the 'thing denoted by' the URL http://www.ietf.org is not
the Internet Engineering Task Force organization, but a web
location accessible by the HTTP protocol and thus, the above
tdb: URN is semantically equivalent to the duri: URN
"urn:duri:2001:http://www.ietf.org", both of which denote the
state of the web location "http://www.ietf.org" at
2001-01-01T00:00:00Z.
If one wishes to denote the Internet Engineering Task Force
organization itself, then they should use a non-location specific
URI to do so, such as a voc: URT or similar non-dereferencable
name, or some anonymous resource; e.g.:
[ a x:Organization ;
x:name "Internet Engineering Task Force" ;
x:homePage http://www.ietf.org ]
There is no need for any tdb: URI scheme, because the 'thing
denoted by' a URI is the thing denoted by the URI, nothing else.
A URI does not denote two things.
Well, aside from Star Trek technology, I don't see how you would
GET a representation of Mary, per the semantics of HTTP. You might
GET a representation of Mary's home page, or of her CV, or of a photo
of Mary, etc. but you wouldn't GET a representation of *Mary* herself.
To some extent, the use of the term 'representation' by HTTP is
unfortunate, because in non-HTTP terms, a photo is a representation of
Mary -- but in the HTTP world, there is an additional level
of indirection between the non-HTTP representation of Mary (the photo)
and the HTTP representation of the non-HTTP representation of
Mary (the byte stream returned by GET), and these two levels of
indirection often get confused such that folks think that what is
returned by GET is a representation of Mary herself, rather than
the actual case, which is that what is returned is a representation
of the representation of Mary. (ouch, my head hurts... ;-)
Yup. Exactly.
The students are not their home pages.
Cheers,

Hi Patrick,
RFC1437 [1] may help with the transfer of a representation of Mary...
although I suspect that you'd continue to find it contain only a
representation of a representation of Mary... and not a representation of
Mary :-)

Good to see the IETF is planning ahead, though... ;-)
