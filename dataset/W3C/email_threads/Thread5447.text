Microsoft has applied for patents that could prevent competing applications
from reading documents created with the latest version of the software
giant's Office program.
The company filed similar patent

1&amp;ontId=7343&amp;lop=nl_ex applications in New Zealand and the European Union
that cover word processing documents stored in the XML (Extensible Markup
Language) format. The proposed patent would cover methods for an application
other than the original word processor to access data in the document. The
U.S. Patent Office had no record of a similar application.
Hi Richard,
I think the following link is related:
It appears Microsoft is trying to protect their Office XML "Schema"
design.
The Schema License is free, under conditions, so I think they're just
trying to prevent "un-licensed" applications from reading and writing
Office XML documents.
Most XML Schemas and/or Vocabularies are free and open - to a point.
Microsoft is probably just trying to make sure they're in charge of the
Schema, and not another Office style application from other sources.
Doesn't surprise me, I bet it's not too long before others (read: not
Microsoft) take similar measures to protect their XML Schemas as
Intellectual Property.
XML is a method of representing information, much like coloured paint is
for representing expression and images in a painting.
You can't patent colours, but you can patent/copyright ownership of what
you paint.
Of course, I could be totally out to lunch...and not understand a word of
what I'm reading. I'm a programmer, not a lawyer :-P
Thanks for the link. Cheers....

Thanks.
What a novel concept! Who would have ever guessed that you could represent
a word processing document file as an XML file. ;-)

Scott, it doesn't matter. Even if you were a lawyer and in sync with your
lunch order, you probably do not have the resources to indefinitely dispute
their patent "claim", its a lost cause. The burden is one you to dispute
the claim. The software patent system is screwed up, period.
In my view, this Office XML patent only reinforces the anti-trust concerns
the industry has and recently questioned again by the Justice Department.
This does not help Microsoft in this regard. It hurts them.
Also, off the top of my head, this essentially boils down to yet another a
"bundling" concept. Microsoft recently lost or gave in to requiring
Windows Media on the OS over others. In my view, Office XML patent
enforcement is probably weaken by this recent Windows Media precedence. I
see the same "bundling" concept being applied.
I remember Bill Gates once saying when Netscape first sued Microsoft over IE
taken over the market. He said in so many words:
IE is winning the hearts and minds of the PC market simply because IE
is faster and
technically superior than Netscape. All someone has to do is develop
a better IE
and he will be highly successful. If he can do it, more power to
him!! I encourage it!
I have yet to see anyone take him up on that challenge. I think Gates
still believes this is true with the growing thin client market that Office
XML targets. Someone can develop a better, faster "thinner client." This
XML patent preempts the high potential market opportunity of compatible and
better thin "Office" clients thus stopping others doing to Office XML what
IE did to Netscape.
