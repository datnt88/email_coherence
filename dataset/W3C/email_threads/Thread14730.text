Hello,
Charles commented to the wai-gl list, and Lisa Seeman agreed that the R1
statement ought to make it clear that while we try to make our deliverables
understandable and usable by policy makers, we will not let them drive our
decisions about technical requirements.
Judy, Gregg, Jason, Charles and I have discussed the following
proposal. We would like to give you all until this Friday (19 April) to
review. If there are no objections, this will be incorporated into a new
draft of the Requirements and we will aim to publish to TR early next week.
We will also allow time for discussion at this week's telecon.
We are proposing a new R2 to supplement the existing R1 proposal.
R1: WCAG 2.0 deliverables should be more understandable and usable by a
wider audience than was anticipated for WCAG 1.0, including policy
makers. While the WCAG WG does not set policy, harmonization of
accessibility requirements helps drive demand for supporting
implementations in Web applications; therefore it should be easy for policy
makers and individuals responsible for implementing policy to understand,
cite and/or adopt WCAG 2.0 and related deliverables.
R2: We will try to express the technical requirements in language that
policy makers can understand, adopt, and use, but technical requirements
are not driven by policy; they are driven by the needs of users with
disabilities.

Overall, this looks good.
I would add
"and the technologies available to meet those needs."
to the end of #2.

Yes, I think this is a good addition.
(It means that we have to resolve the "baseline requirements" issue).

I believe from my experience that negatives are hard to understand, and
possibly harder to prove.
hence:
'Technical requirements are driven by the needs of users with disabilities.
We do however try to express the technical requirements in language that
policy makers can understand, adopt, and use.'
thanks

aloha, jonathan!
i agree with your critique, but would like to "see" a more explicit
"round-tripping" -- while the buck may stop at the desk of a policy maker,
accessibility is achieved not with a single stroke of a bureaucratic pen,
but by technicians -- a concept that can neither be lost nor diluted...
The technical requirements of WCAG 2.0 are driven by the needs of users
with disabilities. However, every attempt has been made to express the
technical requirements in language that policy makers can understand,
adopt, and use to assess [the results of] specific implementation decisions
[and policies].
i'm sure that 99.9 percent of you could phrase that more directly and
succinctly, gregory. (who is even more woolly-headed than usual today)
PS: for the thread's sake, here's jonathan's original:
'Technical requirements are driven by the needs of users with

I actually like Gregory's phrtasing, and wonder whether we can make a new
re-unified R1 proposal, along the lines of
The technical requirements of WCAG 2.0 are driven by the needs of users
with disabilities. However, the users of WCAG 2.0 are a wide audience,
and the requirements it expresses these must be expressed in language
that policy makers can use, reference and directly adopt as appropriate.
Which brings me to another point. In order to meet this requirement, we need
some clear guidance about what language is appropriate for the various
policy-setting audiences.
cheers
