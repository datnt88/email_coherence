This came from Jon Gunderson, but I think it is extremely helpful information
to add to AERT 10.1.2 - a technique for ATAG 4.1, listed in Jan's November
draft available from the sources area.

There are seven main types of information that I think a user agent could
recognize in scripts that are associated with our checkpoints related to
control of viewports, focus, styling effects and form submission. Examples
for JavaScript are provided.
1. Opening a new window
for Javascript:
myWindow.open("www.w3.org", "My New Window");
myWindow.showHelp(URI);
2. Closing a window
for Javascript:
myWindow.close()
3. Changing focus to another window
For Javascript:
myWindow.focus();
4. Changing the URI rendered in the current view port
For Javascript:
myWindow.home();
myWindow.forward();
myWindow.back();
myWindow.navigate("http://www.w3.org");
myWindow.history.back();
myWindow.history.forward();
myWindow.history.go( -2 );
location.href = "http://www.w3.org"
location.reload();
location.replace("http://www.w3.org");
5. Submitting forms:
For Javascript:
document.form[0].submit();
document.all.mySubmitButton.click();
6. Controlling the start and speed of scrolling for a MARQUEE element
for Javascript:
document.all.myBanner.start();
document.all.myBanner.scrollDelay = 100
7. Changes in style of an element:
document.all.myElement style.color = "red";

Good list.
One thing to keep in mind, that the current window is always assumed for
properties and funcitons so
myWindow.close ()
is same as close(), although it's often written the first way for clarity.

The new US 508 rules have a new requirement: that information written to
the screen by javascript be accessible to a screenreader. To avoid
crossposting, I wrote the details to WCAG. You can see them at
Please continue the thread there until it gets to the point we have
something to test. Then we'll bring it back here. After we figure out a
technique we'll send it over to AU where they're documenting the
techniques. And then we'll point into the AU document with EARL/EDL. AU
may in turn want to reference that feature of EARL. Ah, process.
