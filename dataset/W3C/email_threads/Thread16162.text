I meant: http://www.netomat.net/
.net, not .com -- I have no idea what's at netomat.com!

Yeah, I noticed that too. I never believe "exact time" posts
on the web anyway, though; a friend had me buy him some
concert tickets that went on sale "exactly at 10:00 a.m. over
the web!" and for a variety of technical mishaps they weren't
really available until 10:30 (and that was only because I
could guess at the correct URL when their links didn't work).

The page appears to have been updated -- perhaps he got the
date wrong? Originally it said Netomat would debut today,
the 24th, but now it's been changed to the 25th and an apology
has been posted.
