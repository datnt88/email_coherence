Hi,
I'd like to propose that guidelines be modified to allow web page
developers who are using technology to create web pages dynamically to
take better advantage of the opportunities offered by this technology.
I'm not quite sure what the best structure would be, but the general
direction would be something along the lines of creating two main groupings
of guidelines. If a user cannot choose the format of the page being
presented, there would be one grouping of guidelines for that page. If
a user can choose in what format a web page would be presented and have
the information be the same in each format, there would be a different
grouping of guidelines for that page.
The "single page format" grouping of guidelines would be pretty much the
same as the current guidelines. (In this case, the universal design is
being provided by a single web page format which is appropriately
designed.)
The "multiple page format" grouping of guidelines would have some of the
same guidelines as are in the "single page format" but would provide
more flexibility in addressing accessibility. (In this case, the
uiversal design is being provided by the collection of formats for a web
page instead of a single format.)
A reason I'm thinking of two different groupings is that I think it will
be easier for developers to follow rather than trying to identify for
each guideline whether it applies to the single format pages,
the multiple format pages or to both types of pages.

Hi, Charles
I'm not sure you're understanding my point. The difference is that when
a web page is generated dynamically, it can be created to more
accurately meet the user's needs.
In my little experiment, almost all of the screen reader users preferred
the web page which was created to meet their needs better. The
impression I'm under is that each user chose a screen reader and then
used that screen reader to look at both web pages. Since a user used
the same screen reader for each of the two sample pages, the preference
of the web page tailored for screen readers was more likely due to the
difference in how the web page was formatted.
An important fact is that what makes a web page attractive to sighted
users often adds impediments to blind users. If a web site developer is
given more freedom to make certain formats more attractive with less
need to worry about the guidelines as much, they might be more willing
to create formats which are better suited for blind users. This would
seem to be better than requiring one format to meet all requirements of
some conformance level. Everyone's needs has a better chance of being
met.
My suggestion is to modify the guidelines to recognize this fact.
The issue is not content. The same content can be presented in each
format.
Your statement about a "user impact matrix" is kind of interesting.
Your argument can also be applied to the guidelines. Don't the
guidelines themselves make certain generalizations about particular
groups. For example, I can point out a number of areas of access
problems that the guidelines don't address that cause trouble for users.
These areas are not generally known because there has been very little
research based on observation on what kinds of problems blind users can
run into. By ignoring the problems, the guidelines are assuming they
are not issues that affect users very much.
Guidelines do imply generalizations.
Scott
I do not agree that there is any demonstrable difference for a user, whether
the page was generated dynaimcally or hand-created by manually resetting bits
of memory. I therefore think this is an inappropriate split.
Where there are multiple versions of a page available there is a difference.
The current guidelines require that at least one version of each page meet
the guidelines entirely, and conformance is based on the conformance of the
single version. Is there a case for having conformance based on the
cumulative conformance to checkpoints of several versions?
Personally, I feel theere is not, since requiring a user to choose several
pages in order to get the different types of content that they require is not
helpful, and in some cases is on its own going to render content
inaccessible. (Scott's example of telling someone to learn CSS and write a
stylesheet as a method of access is a similar barrier.)
There may be value in a "user impact matrix" - which allows designers who are
not going to meet a conformance level to provide accessibility for a
particular targetted group. However this implies making a bunch of
generalisations about particular groups, and seems an exercise fraught with
difficulty for a dubious return (the risk is that people will simply target
people who are blind, or mobility impaired, or some other single group, and
then claim they are doing all that is feasible for accessibility).

Scott,
The guidelines promote Universal design, rather than targetted design,
precisely in order to avoid the problem of helping one group at the expense
of another. They recognise that there may be situations in which content is
created in a way that is not generally accessible, and provide for that
content to also be provided in a generally accessible format in order to
claim conformance for that content. Note that this is not the same as a
text-only version. For example, there are more people with partial vision
than there are blind people in Australia by several times, and I presume that
this is the case elsewhere. Most of these people find images useful to a
certain extent (if they are properly used, which is a big if) and it is
possible through good design to use graphics in a way which does not have
anegative impact on blind users. Such universal design stretegies serve the
various communities much better than a couple of groups being targetted
(prehaps completely blind and completely deaf) and every other group being
ignored.
The guidelines make no distinction between dynamically and statically
generated content because they describe requirements so that end-users can
access content.
If you can provide us with information about access problems that are not
addressed by the curret guidelines, please do, so we can address them in
revisions. That is why we seek a diverse group of members for the working
group - no one person is likely to know all the problemfaced by all the users
of the web.
Cheers
Charles

Some short notes and an important call....
Short Notes (opinions not rulings)
1) When discussing universal design, we should be sure to decide if we are
talking about universal design applied to the website - or applied to the
page. I think dynamically generated presentations is clearly universal
design of the site. I think I prefer pages that transform of themselves
rather than server side assisted transformations, but I'm not sure which
will actually give more people more usable pages. My guess is that
transforming pages will more often provide users with all the information
(e.g. less inadvertent editing out of info) but that server side would
generate more usable pages for each domain
2) I don't think our guidelines should take a stand on how the pages are
generated.... But rather on what makes a page accessible... If we can
avoid how and stick to what - I think that is better.
3) I think server side solutions will wreak havoc with accessibility
validators
4) We should look again at the interaction of our priority guidelines and
regulations. In the past our priorities have been determined basically by
what makes a page accessible.... Not by its ease of implementation. If
regulations are going to say Priority 1 and 2 - then we need to think this
through carefully. I hate to say this but I think we do.
5) I think we will have some very interesting discussions at CSUN. I am
looking forward to everyone's views.
-- IMPORTANT CALL --
BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY - If you think that we need to do something different
with the guidelines
You must come to CSUN with suggestions (or post them to this list). Specific
suggestions for change.
We are beginning to just run in circles with opinions and general concepts.
I think that this stage is essential, but we also need to move on to the
next one as well. At least we need to see what the options might look like
if they were implemented. There are always problems with any approach.
The question is, would an alternate approach be a better than what we have.
To determine that we need to start looking at specifics as well as the
general concepts.
Specific ideas or suggestions for the guidelines or techniques doc anyone?

I agree that we should think this through. And I think we should conclude (in
my humble, but considered opinion) that it is inappropriate for a body which
has undertaken the task of finding out what (internationally) are the
requirements for accessibility of the web to add to the onerous task the
requirement of fitting in with International law, an area in which most of us
are woefully ignorant. Slightly less appropriate, of course, would be to base
our work on the law of a couple of countries just because we know it better.
The education and outreach group has a specific mission to develop materials
and raise awareness among policy makers. Perhaps we should be providing them
with more feedback if we feel that there are specific areas that need to be
looked at differently from a policy perspective than from an accessibility
perspective. If we know of a particular country that is going to make a
decision we think is inappropriate, then those of us who are citizens of that
country, and the EO group as a representative of W3C, should make submissions
to the relevant bodies. But I seriously doubt we know enough about law and
policy around the world to be able to incorporate it into the priority scheme
in a helpful way, especially given the constant change both in it and in the
state of the art.

if we throw out the reference to law and focus on what is implementable and
reachable. Case in point the Software Engineering Institute's Capabilty
Maturity Model is a metric for how well your company meets their
requirements. the rating level is zero (chaos) to 5. Two means you have
some practices in place that can be measured and save rework.
Unfortunately, Level 5 is the Zenith and only a handful of companies after
ten-ish years has reached this. As a person who has worked in level 2 and
has been instructed to level three, i ask, " Is this what I as a company
want to obtain?" The cost and burden to reach this is very high and how
does it help my business? What is the net? Most government contracts
require at least level three - if i participate in this market. The
overhead to be a level 3 and 5 is very high as your people must be trained
to it and in our job market, workers hop jobs very fast.
There are those who beleive that the level five is an artificial standard
that is not needed to meet business objectives, therefore there is no value
added.
In universal design, there is some leverage with developers that are a part
of a government, but we must also be concerned about developers in
non-government markets. So it seems there will be more buy-in from one
market segment versus another. This is not the purpose of WCAG and
universla design but it may be the result.
I think this is the wrong approach. We need a universal design standard
that is implementable across all developer segments and are supported by
tools. Then as toolsets and agents meet the other guidelines, then they can
be tightened.
You must provide a guideline that supports rapid application development and
a very fast time to market or else you will not get buy-inform the single
most community you need - developers and managers.

There are different standards of implementable in different cultures. For
example, in the US as I understand it (I could be wrong on all this) an
agency covered by the ADA is required to make accommodations unless it would
impose an undue burden. In Australia, a private agency can claim an exemption
from the requirement not to discriminate unless it would pose an undue
burden, but a public (government owned) agency cannot, unless it is actually
not possible to make an accommodation.
