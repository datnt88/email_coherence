Explain what error is being reported, supply an example (as small as
possible), and state which version of Tidy you are using and how you
have it configured.
Take a look at the new-* config options, using them you'd be able to
extend the recognized tag set.
Fred,
I use JEdit 4.1pre4, the default settings of JTidy with the required plug-ins:
Version: 1.0.1 Requirements: ErrorList  = 1.2 ? JDK  = 1.3 ? jEdit  = 4.0pre1 ? XML  = 0.7
This is an extract of a webwork sample JSP:
1 %@ taglib uri="webwork" prefix="webwork" %
2 %@ taglib uri="webwork" prefix="ui" %
3
4 html
5 head
6 title
JTidy reports:
shop.jsp:7:Error: webwork:text is not recognized!
Please let me know if I need to provide you with some more information.
Thanks for your help,
Frank
