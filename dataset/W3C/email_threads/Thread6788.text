Folks,
I published a new release of XML Spec today. Version 2.5 adds
preverrataloc and translationloc to the header as well as rfc2119 to
the inlines. (I haven't (yet) tried to integrate the changes suggested
by GEO (I18N) and WCAG (WAI), but I've put that on my list.)
There's a new release of the base HTML and FO stylesheets to support
the new elements.
Be seeing you,
norm

Hello Norm,
Many thanks for all your work.
Great. Please note that mainly due to the great work of Ivan Herman,
we now have an integrated, RDF-based system for translations. As
a consequence, the translations for e.g. the XML Recommendation can
simply be found at:
Some parts of this system are still under development, in particular
we want to have a way to keep track of volunteers (people interested
in collaborating on a translation and people who have started a
translation), and want to make it possible to submit translations
with a form.
Because of this, many specifications still (also) keep their
own, hand-managed translations page. But we expect that their
number will become smaller and smaller.
What I'm wondering now is whether there is any way to make
this link to the translation page (semi)-automatic, i.e. by
extracting the relevant piece from the 'latest version' link.
Regards, Martin.
How do I get to the RDF version of that page? I don't
see any "and for those of you that want to peek
under the hood..." links.
Ah! found it... up to "translations at W3C"
and down to "Further technical information"
and "translation management" and I get...

/ Martin Duerst duerst@w3.org was heard to say:
If there's an infallible algorithm for transforming the latest version
URI into the appropriate translation page, I'd be happy to support it.
(How this interacts with TAG issue metadataInURI-31[1][2] is left as an
exercise for the reader. :-)

Dan,
you found the essential one... not also that you can call the CGI script
requesting the returned value to be in RDF. It will collect the right
information for, eg, a specific document and return the RDF part.
Actually, nobody used that alternative yet, I am sure there are bugs
there. And I am also sure you will tell me if you find any... however: I
am on vacations. Ie, I may or may not react immediately!

Is there a mapping of tech-report-URIs to technologies?
Or can I use the actuall URI of the XML REC as
input to this CGI?

I hope I understand the questions properly...
I took over the method from Dominique when massaging the TR page. This
means using the non-dated URI for a document to generate an ID using the
following python function:
# Generation of an ID from a "shortname", IE the non-dated URI-s
identifying the core document
# The generation follows Dominique's way of generating ID-s when
generating the /TR pages
def generateId(resource,ID=false):
uri = "%s" % (resource,)
# get the possible trailing '/' off:
if uri.endswith('/') :
uri = uri[:-1]
# make the uri relative, ie, cut off all characters before the last '/'
slin = uri.rfind('/')
if slin != -1 :
uri = uri[slin+1:]
# some uri-s might contain '+' signs, get them out:
retval = uri.replace('+','-').replace('.','-')
if id == false :
return retval
else :
# A further issue is to get everything out before a '#'
hash = retval.rfind('#')
if hash == -1 :
return retval
else :
return retval[hash+1:]
the shortname can be extracted from
using the predicate 'doc:versionOf'.
B.t.w.:
is a good collection; if you have other entries to add, please do!
