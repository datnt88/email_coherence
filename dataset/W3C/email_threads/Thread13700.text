One of the problems with coming up with a simple EARL example is that EARL
is so encompassing and generic. If we had an example of EARL where a page
was being WCAG rated (i.e. rubber stamped), there is nothing in that that
can provide an example of testing an SVG graphic for accessibility or one
of the many thousands of things that EARL could be used for.
Maybe we should all work on a few examples each, and then submit them to
the list? That way, we shall get many issues covered at once. If all
examples had some sort of summary of problems faced, etc., then that would
be even more sueful. If we can first come to some knid of agreement about
the vocabulary, and how we use it, then we can all see how many more terms
we needed to invent for our actual practical examples. Note that if you
invent a new property, it might be possible to define it as being related
to something that has already been defined in the EARL vocabulary... this
is the kind of modular thing that I keep ranting on about.
Is this a good idea? I think pragmatism will warrant useful results for
EARL at this stage.

I'd be happy to work on an example, but I don't know exactly what that
means. What do you envision? An evaluation report of site A written in
EARL? For example, if I look at the output of WAVE on
page. WAVE also asserts that every image has alt-text and that none seem
to be suspicious. Now I need to figure out how to state these assertions
using the syntax we've been discussing...
First attempt will be to assert that I think the alt-text on the image that
linearizes the table is ok. Using Sean's latest summary of a syntax [1]
combined with what we discussed on Monday [2] and Len's summary of that
discussion [3]...I have thrashed the syntax, but here's a stab...probably
in the dark. (I've combined my references in this paragraph with
prefixes...hope that isn't confusing)

#The assertion shouldn't be a string, but wasn't sure how to fit it into

Not sure what to do about reading order. Sean, is this the type of
exercise you were hoping we would do?

Seems as good as any. I think that as EARL has such a wide scope (how many
types of evaluations are there? and there's certainly no end of things to
evaluate), it would do us well to get some examples out. Designing a
langauge for such a wide scope is (IMHO) the most difficult part. Any
evaluation is fine as long as it is a "real life" example, i.e. something
that EARL may actually be used for.
Seems very "real life".
This is good and raises a few points about EARL and representation therof
immediately.
1. The semEnglish method of delimiting URIs with "[]" is flawed for URIs
incorporating XPath.
2. Using namespace aliases to save space writing out URIs... I'm not sure
if this is technically "politically correct", but it's a very good idea. I
think I did it before myself, when I converted one of the W3C's RSS feeds
into N3 for Aaron Swartz.
3. Wendy comments the following:-
one
In short, yes, they should. What's happened here is that writing out
triples in Notation3 exposes how close it is to things we encounter in
natural language. Wendy writes the following:-
Which can probably be represented as:-
"wendy" earl:asserts
h:img[@src="/Icons/detab"] h:@alt [ l:quality "low" ] .
N.B. No need to put  around qualified URIs... at first I thought this
might actually be an improvement on the current, but then I realised that
the  were there to indicate that this is a URI and not a QName - i.e. is
earl: some new URI scheme, or just a QName? Answer: if it's in  then it's
a URL, otherwise it's a QName prefixed attribute. There have been many
disagreements on RDF IG about using  to delimit URIs... (even TimBL
joined in on the discussion).
Still, point I'm trying to make in amidst all of my digressions is that it
is difficult to compress things that we want to express in triples, because
we're so used to "natural language". Seth wanted semEnglish to be a step
closer to representing things naturally, and he has suceeded on many
accounts. I think that anyone following this will like to look at the
grammar http://robustai.net/mentography/semenglish.html but beware that
there are still some syntactical errors that Seth needs to fix in the
meantime.
Another thing to look at for EARL syntax purposes might be MetaLog
and semEnglish even further in that the syntax is geting neater, and yet
more human readable. MetaLog is probably the ancestor of these langauges,
and hence has historical importance.
Yes - thank you! The more times we attempt to represent "EARL" examples,
the closer we come to a syntax agreement.

reading order of the
Simple, RDF-free statements:
Wendy .sez. (([path to] ALT in question) .is. appropriate)
.sez. and .is. are clearly going to be popular. but let's assume
'appropriate'
is going to come back again. Clearly we have .sez. is a relationship
between a
person or similar agent and an utterance. The utterance in this case is
indeed
an assertion. RDF says something about them. Next we have .is. which is a
relationship that links entities and qualities. At least one meaning of the
English 'is' is to do that. RDF may elide .is. There may be property syntax
in RDF so we can say the equivalent of "appropriate(ALT in question)" as an
assertion, a duple rather than a triple.
We could get more precise and technical, if somebody asks Wendy why she feels
this is appropriate.
Wendy .sez. ((ALT in question) .satisfies. (good pattern [reference])
The "good pattern" is in a graph transcription of the normative documents
[WCAG, AERT, the World-Wide heap of prior manual evaluation results, etc.].
It
would be yet another patch of graph where it talks about an image which plays
the role of a control, and (the ALT for the IMG and the action of the control)
enjoying an equivalence relationship. But writing out the good pattern
requires blank stubs or placeholders for the image at least. The model of
HTML
will if we encode it right get you a text string placeholder linked by an
attribute-relationship labeled ALT to the IMG placeholder if you have an IMG
placeholder already.
I guess that is the way I would approach examples. Write down everything
evaluative you would say about some web page. Convert the prose to
entity-relationship [instance] graphs. The RDF or EARL is a transcription of
the graph form. The trick is in understanding the culture involved in drawing
out literate graphs made up of well-modulated primitives that, like the Dublin
Core, encourage reuse. That will take some false starts and some comparing
what it was you wanted to say about different pages.
There's an alternate approach, if the graphs don't feel natural. Just write
out your reactions to the page as a bunch of English assertions. Different
people should do this with different pages. Then go through and identify
(magic marker) all the items you made statements about, and the properties or
relationships that you asserted about them. Compare and contrast these
content
objects and properties or qualities that different people used in their
commentaries. Encode this in a WordNet lattice. There you have a vocabulary
for EARL 0.1.

We already have a nice set of well-modulated primitives through EDL and
EARL evolution. In this way, the vocabulary is evolving similar to that of
DC, but I envisage that the syntax won't do. Dublin Core syntax doesn't
exist: it's just a base element set with no structural definition. EARL on
the other hand is not just a core vocabulary, but a means of processing
that on non-RDF parsers as well. The EARL framework is a subset of RDF, not
an RDF langauge. We already have syntax rules: e.g. "the subject of a
triple where the predicate is earl:asserts is always an earl:Validator".
Why have these rules? Because RDF is so unconstraining. There are hundreds
of ways to make the same assertion, but with a few simple EARL rules
involving a use of the core vocabulary, we can come up with simple,
effective, modularized systems that can be groked, and yet extended at
will. In other words, any langauge that is a subset of RDF can use RDF
parsers, even if it does not allow certain features of RDF. If you allow in
*new* features, then you lose that, and that is what we must avoid.
