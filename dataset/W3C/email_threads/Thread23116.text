hi
it is said in the spec that TextEvent and KeyboardEvent are child classes of
UIEvent (of course).
UIEvent needs a detail arg to be passed to be initialized. but the initializer
routines of KeyboardEvent and TextEvent do not get these? Why?
How shall these handle this?
Many thanks,
Christian.

TextEvent and KeyboardEvent don't use detail as a context information.
UIEvent do have a detail parameter in init and it can be used by
sub-classes, such as MouseEvent.
In any case, the detail property value of TextEvent and KeyboardEvent
has no specific meaning. I would suggest initializing to 0 but you can
do otherwise in your implementation if you wish :)
One can argue that it is possible to generate a valid Mouse event with
using only initUIEvent, so I would be in favor of keeping the statu quo,
i.e. the value of detail is undefined on text event and keyboard event.
Applications may still wish to initialize the value of detail using
initUIEvent (since it is supported in text and keyboard event objects as
well) but it is certainly useless.

Well, yeah, that's what I wanted to know. The detail property is undefined on
interface KeyboardEvent and TextEvent so I can just set it to zero since the
init methods in my implementation invoke the init method of UIEvent to
initialize their values ;)
btw, in my eyes it wasn't clear enough defined in the spec, so this should be
explicitely said there....
Thanks,
Christian.
