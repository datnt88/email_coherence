Hi all
I'm looking for a website where you can see how web pages will appear in
different browsers. I can find simulators for Lynx, webTV and a WAP browser
but there doesn't seem to be anything for 'standard' browsers. This problem
arises because I can't install more than one version of IE on my machine
without multiple operating systems (thanks mr gates). Does anyone know of
such a resource? If not, does anyone have a clue about how to set it up?

Hi

IE on my machine without multiple operating systems (thanks mr gates).
I use VMWare [1] in Linux and it allows me to have multiple versions of
windows running at the same time, I use it so I can check pages in IE4,
5, 5.5 and 6. It can also run on a NT based version of windows.
