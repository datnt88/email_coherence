Minutes from MEP Task Force 23 June 2003 are attached.
David Booth
W3C Fellow / Hewlett-Packard
From the minutes, I am not entirely sure what conclusion you reached.
Would it be fair to summarize the TF's position as follows? (I apologize
in advance if my summary misrepresent the TF's position.)
1) At the interface level, we will use WSDL patterns.
2) At the binding level, we will use SOAP MEPs.
3) We will not indicate the relationship between the two.
I'm fine with 1) and 2); I feel we will need to be a little more
explicit about 3). For example, does the choice of a WSDL pattern
restrict the set of possible SOAP MEPs?
Again, apologies if my characterization of the TF's position was not
accurate.

SOAP patterns vs. WSDL patterns.
*dbooth* See Youenn's message:
*David:* Any wisdom to share?
*Amy:* In Scottsdale we decided to make WSDL patterns operate at a more
fundamental conceptual level than SOAP MEPS.
... Some discussion whether we should ask SOAP to define their patterns
in terms of ours.
... Decided "no". They weren't going to change.
... Doesn't change the fact that SOAP patterns are more explicit than ours.
... No attempt to discriminate on our part between HTTP
request-response, an HTTP get followed by a SOAP response, and a SOAP
request-response.
... XMLP has defined two of these.
... In WSDL we also are dealing with pure HTTP request-response.
... I don't see that we have a significant win in distinguishing those
cases.
... Do we need to identify SOAP categories of request-response?
... Can we leave this totally to the binding?
*Scribe:* David, Umit: Leave to binding.
*Amy:* There's a certain amount of SOAP r-r that we won't model outside
the binding.
*Umit:* Does it matter to the client? No.
*Amy:* We don't need to make as many distinctions as SOAP r-r patterns,
right?
*Scribe:* David, Umit: Sounds like the case.
*David:* Still useful to show correspondence between our patterns and
XMLPs.
*Amy:* Yes, at some point we end up with a pattern (p3) which maps to
both SOAP MEPs.
*Umit:* Equivalencies.
*David:* Specializations.
*Umit:* If they map to p3 doesn't that mean two equivalent
implementations of the pattern?
... Actually a concretization of the pattern in three different ways.
... When we have a leaf node in our lattice, there may be a specific
binding that describes that pattern.
*David:* Specific binding is not an actual sequence of messages. A
sequence of messages conforms to the binding, or not.
... If it conforms to the binding, it conforms to the pattern.
*Amy:* Can we say we might need some specialized terminology and move on?
*Scribe:* (scribe missing some chunks here)
*Umit:* As long as the client has a specific pattern it adheres to, how
it relates to XMLP work doesn't matter.
*David:* We will need to identify the link between our specific patterns
and SOAP's.
*dbooth* JM: It would be good of people writing new SOAP specs would
reference our MEPs.
I don't think that we reached a conclusion. Not this one, at any rate.
We can't mandate SOAP MEPs only at the binding level, if we plan to
support bindings other than SOAP. Can we?

I don't think that we reached a conclusion or a specific stand on (3).
Personally, my gut feeling is that the SOAP MEPs will be specific
instances of a particular WSDL pattern and that is how we can establish
the relationships between the two. That is what I tried to convey during
the concall (but perhaps failed :-)).

Right. There was sentiment that we SHOULD indicate the relationship
between WSDL MEPs and SOAP MEPs, and some sentiment that SOAP MEPs might be
concretizations or specializations of WSDL MEPs, but we weren't really
ready to make that determination yet, so the issue was deferred.

I'm lost by the double negative (can't-only). Didn't you mean something
different?
Jean-Jacques.
a little bit of a difficulty in pairing the two, unless our current WSDL
patterns match perfectly.
Jean-Jacques.
Sorry.
If WSDL supports more than SOAP (as I believe that it does), then we
must support message exchange patterns that they define. We cannot
restrict the set of available MEPs at the binding level to only those
defined by SOAP, because WSDL supports binding styles other than SOAP.

I'm still somewhat puzzled. (Although I think I agree.)
Let me try to paraphrase.
WSDL must support more than SOAP. So, at the interface level, we need to
use WSDL patterns, not SOAP MEPs. In bindings other than the SOAP
binding, we need to support MEPs other than the SOAP MEPs. In the SOAP
binding, of course, we need to support SOAP MEPs.
The MEPs used in a particular binding must be compatible with the WSDL
patterns used in the corresponding interface/operation.
Maybe this is more than paraphrasing; maybe the above are requirements.
Jean-Jacques.
Sounds all correct to me. David, Umit? Anyone else?
I think that possibly we need to state these as requirements, or
indicate that the logic of the thing imposes these requirements.

I agree (even if the soap mep model is quite extensible and large enough
IMO to cover the 80/20 cases :-).
What is also of interest is to allow the maximum compatibility between
the soap mep model and the wsdl pattern model.
The soap mep framework mixes generic mep information (exactly what a
wsdl pattern provides) and additional information (state machine,
protocol specific data).
IMO, someone (the wsdl wg ?) should clarify how wsdl patterns and soap
meps are working together. Guidelines should be provided about how to
write new SOAP meps. These guidelines would promote the idea of defining
a SOAP mep through:
- reusing an already defined wsdl pattern/ creating a new wsdl pattern
- in the new soap mep spec, refer to this wsdl pattern and add
additional information/constraints to be implementable
The benefit is to clearly separate abstract information/concrete
information in two specs, these two specs being not redundant.
It seems difficult to enforce these guidelines for the Soap/response and
req/resp meps but I see benefits for to be created soap meps.
The reuse of wsdl patterns to define soap meps add some constrains to
the wsdl pattern model. I only see a few constrains however and quite
(?) common sense:
- identify each message (or message type for the multicast case)
through a uri
- identify each mep through a uri
- identify each described node (or node type for the multicast case)
through a uri
- (any other constraint?)
The biggest difference between soap meps and wsdl patterns as defined in
the current document might be that wsdl patterns differentiate the
service node from the other nodes of the network while soap does not
make that distinction.
Depending on the wsdl pattern description model , this could also be
solved nicely.
Youenn
Sounds correct to me as well.
I agree with Jean-Jacques, too. They are definitely requirements.
