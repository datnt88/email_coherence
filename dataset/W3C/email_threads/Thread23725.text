Dear Clement,
In past I successfully had logged in to http://www.onelist.com
(a huge free mailing lists provider) using www4mail@wm.ictp.trieste.it .
Login (it's called "Sign In" there) requires use of cookies,
www4mail@wm.ictp.trieste.it has cookie support enabled
(I checked by "help info"). Recently I again tried to request
cookie-protected pages from http://www.onelist.com and got
invitation to sign-in. I thought that my "cookie jar" was deleted
for some reason and tried to sign-in again. My request (I masked
my password because I own a closed mailing list on ONElist and care
for privacy of subscribers):

I tried twice - same.
Registration on http://www.onelist.com is free, I never got spam from there.
Many thanks for the invaluable resource and continuous work for its
improvement!

Okay,
I think I have fixed the problem now!
Some piece of code changed location and that caused stored cookies to be
ignored due to a wrong path information.
So, it should be working fine again..
Please kindly let me know immediately if anything else does not work.
Thanks
Clement Onime
