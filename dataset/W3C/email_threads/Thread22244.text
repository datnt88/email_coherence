Dear all
As I've indicated in previous messages, I've anticipated sometime in
January to be the date of release for the first version of the DOM Level
1 TS. I believe we can do this as soon as we resolve the issue of the
HTML tests.
What we need in order to do this, except for the issues I raised earlier
about documentation, is:
1. Wait for NIST to tell us how long a transition of their submitted
level 2 HTML tests to level 1 HTML tests would take
2. Wait for Netscape, whose representative managed to build the DOM TS
after downloading an earlier version of Xalan, to indicate if they are
willing to submit HTML tests.
3. Finally resolve the issue on Xalan; my setup consists of Ant 1.4 and
Xalan 2.2.0, any developer release after that fails miserably. Can Curt,
Mary and Rick please communicate to the list their particular setup so
that we can document required software accordingly?
As far as level 2 is concerned, I anticipate for us to be able to
release it fairly quickly after the first Level 1 suite, since we will
have learned and we will not have that steep a learning curve. I've
indicated February/early March as a release date candidate. In addition,
I hope to have some feedback from teh public once they see that we have
a framework that is up and running.
Level 3 is due to be released somewhere between Candidate and Proposed
recommendation status of the level 3 specifications.
Any thoughts?
