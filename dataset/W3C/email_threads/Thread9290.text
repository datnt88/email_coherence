Correction to the minutes:
Under "Review status of #rdfms-identity-anon-resources (15 mins)"
replace "Frank suggested two major approaches: 1) recognize that people
might use RDF in a query context but not leave others to specify the
semantics fo that situation or 2) do the extension ourselves."

Thanks for catching this, Frank. You are of course right. I've
edited my local copy, but I'm waiting to see if there are any
other errors before I re-mail it.
I hope you don't mind,

Not at all. Great and very timely minutes, by the way. You set a high
standard.

Aaron,
You've gone to a lot of effort to provide the minutes in a variety of
formats. Unfortunately, you have omitted the one I find most useful.
Plain old ordinary text is just great from my point of view. The action
id's also seem to be missing from the html version.
In future, please could scribes provide the minutes in the usual
plain text format as requested in:
Brian
It's difficult to meet opposing requirements. I was asked by
Eric Miller to use Dan Connolly's meeting report tools (which I
personally think are an excellent approach) which automatically
convert RDF minutes into HTML. I do not feel it is a valuable
use of my time to hand-convert the minutes into another format.
However, I can point you to a web service I have built to create
a textual version of any HTML page:
www-archive/2001Jul/att-0012/01-rdfc13Jul.html
I will be sure to include a textified version when I send out
the corrected minutes.
