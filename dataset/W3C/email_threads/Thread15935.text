I've just downloaded pwWebSpeak evaluation copy and am just learning
about web accessibility issues. I am about to seek work as a web
designer who wants to make the web what it should be, available for ALL.
My question is, does the evaluation copy come with voice synthesizer,
i.e.: SoftVoice or do I need to get that separately? I'm hoping to play
around with it this weekend and assume any tech support they may have is
Mon.-Fri.
Thanks, and good list serve -- I've already learned allot since joining!
No, pwWebSpeak doesn't come with a voice synthesiser - you have to get
that seperately.

to follow up on what Charles McCathie Nevile said:
The demo that I got last month included the software synthesizer.
Worked in a reasonably vanilla Win95 environment with a sound
card.

Guy,
Did you get your install key? You have to do that by email and
yes, it involves a person at the other end. ProdWorks is a small
business. I believe that the entire online help is on the Web in
public, so the first [and second?] round of questions for support
can possibly be avoided if you RTFM.

Oh. Cool. The version I got didn't. It was an evaluation version only -
maybe that was the reason? (If I knew, I have forgotten)

The documentation comes with it. If using Win 95, got to programs and look
in the pwWebSpeak folder. Its in there.
