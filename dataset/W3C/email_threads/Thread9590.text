I am unable to checkout the test cases files that Jan has loaded into the
shadow TR space - CVS gives me an "end of file from server" error. I get
similar errors in the primer directory in shadow TR space and on the whole
RDFCore directory - I can't see the primer directory. I was going to move
the primer over to shadow TR space on Frank's behalf.
Is it possible there is a file permissions problem? That I cant see stuff
through CVS uploaded by anyone else, or uploaded through jigedit? I can
see the test cases doc from my browser.
