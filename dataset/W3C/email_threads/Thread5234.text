Geoff, I think we are discussing the TT standard with largely different
perspectives, in that I am hoping for a standard that defines a mechanism
**just** for the transport of Unicode characters together with timing
information that controls when and for how long it is displayed.
It would certainly be possible to start with this as a base.
What is the list etiquette for posting examples of possible solutions? I'm
thinking that if we started with a minimal extensible solution, we could
iterate toward a solution more quickly.
Translation: Less talk, more action! :^)

Examples are welcome!

Hello,
Excellent. I'm familiar enough with XML, captioning/subtitling and other
time-related standards to be dangerous, and I have no delusions that
whatever I post is anything but scratch work meant to be criticized by the
more knowledgeable and experienced folks on the list. (I'll post
something by Monday.)
