After a lot of discussions, here are the requirements for
XPath DOM:
In particular, see the "known questions" section:

Regarding "4.6.3 Requirements... 5.The DOM XPATH interfaces SHOULD NOT
return a "live" object..." Doesn't this make XPath useless for finding a
location in the document that you want to update? This seems like a
serious shortcoming.

To quote the entire requirement:
* The DOM XPATH interfaces SHOULD NOT return a "live" object, but
should return a list or iterator that will either reflect a
snapshot of the DOM tree at the moment the XPath query was
evaluated or will become invalidated if changes to the DOM tree
could affect its contents.
The object being referred to here is not the nodes, but rather the "list
or iterator". Perhaps the reference to a snapshot is misleading. I
believe that it is expected that nodes iterated or listed will be live,
but the iteration or list containing those nodes is not live.
