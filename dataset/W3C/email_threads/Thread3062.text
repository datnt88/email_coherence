This test makes it unclear of what /exactly/ should 'pass' or 'fail'
(if cursor is not same for each box would it fail, IE: if cursor is not
crosshair for 'tree' in both boxes.
This should be clarified in test
~Justin Wood (Failing unless response says otherwise)
Good point. The new text will read:
p Select everything in this document. The following two constructs
(in the thick black borders) should end up looking identical. You
should also check that the cursor is the same on equivalent parts
(in particular the cursor should either be a crosshair over "Tree"
and the default everywhere else, or the default everywhere). /p
Let me know if that is clear enough.

Sounds good, but my marking 'should' that implies (at least to me) that
it /is/ still possible to pass if the cursor is not the same, even on a
UA that supports cursor. The pass/fail criteria is more what I was
looking at in that test.

"Should" means it is a requirement. It's English. :-) (The test suite
doesn't refer to RFC2119.)

Regardless Hixie, with the rest of W3C using the RFC defs, and the
testsuite not, it is misleading to potential test-suite users.
~Justin Wood
What would you put instead? "Must" is plainly wrong, from an English
perspective. If the UA is buggy, the test must be red, not green. (Or
whatever the criteria is.)

I'm not sure, but clarifying the pass/fail a bit more can't hurt:
"If your UA uses a pointing device, the cursor must be [......]
otherwise this test fails."
~Justin Wood
IMHO,
"X must be Y otherwise the test has failed"
...and:
"X should Y"
...mean the same thing except the latter is much easier to understand.
I really don't see the advantage of changing this. Almost every test says
"should". If someone doesn't understand that "This line should be green."
means that if it isn't green the test has failed, then someone should
explain that to them, because they're going to have trouble ever finding
a failure.

Well as far as I am concerned, (completely my opinion) the other tests,
say should, along with /one/ feature tested...the one in question says
"check that they look the same, " for the selection AND it says that the
cursor should be the same, which usually is ok, but with the text as is,
is a bit misleading....perhaps splitting the two /features/ then?
~Justin Wood
Several say "This line should be green" more than once.
There is only one feature being tested (::selection). It's just being
tested in multiple scenarios at once.

It must be green in order to pass the test. It shall be green.
How do you write a test for a RFC 2119 SHOULD requirement?
