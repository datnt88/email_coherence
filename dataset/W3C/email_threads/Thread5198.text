Dear OWL-S developers,
reading the OWL-S document, I found a few places, where a wording
appearently did not reflect the semantics, as I had understood them from
the text.
5.1.1 Process
* Preconditions and Effects
The _output_ describes the actual event: that the amount of money in the
credit card account has been reduced.
In my opinion, this is just the difference between output and effect -
the output is some information like the invoice, yet the reduction
itself is the _effect_.
5.4 Composite Process
Unordered
X = (Sequence a b)
Y = (Sequence c d)
Z = (Unordered _A_ _B_)
The example only makes sense, as far as I can see, if
Z = (Unordered X Y)
I hope you can find out whether I misunderstood, or your draft is
incorrect in this matters.
Yours,
Sebastian Brandt

Yes, looks like a typo.
Yep, nother typo.
Nope. Good catches both.

Thanks, Sebastian, and Bijan. I've just made these corrections in our
source, and in the published HTML of the Tech. Overview. The PDF and PS
forms will have to be updated later.
Regards,
David
