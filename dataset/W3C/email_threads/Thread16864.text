A rather odd statement here:

Google by Mail
By most measures, Google dominates Web searching. Now you don't have
to be on the Web to use it.
A new service called GoogleMail gives you e-mail access to the
popular search engine. Just send a message to google@capeclear.com
with your query in the Subject line. The search results will be sent
to your In box, usually within minutes.
The service was created by Cape Clear Software, which specializes in
so-called Web services, or software that links online applications
with other programs. Initially it was aimed at users of palmtop
organizers and mobile phones. But in just a few months GoogleMail
has handled more than 30,000 queries from a surprising variety of
people, said Colin Newman, vice president for marketing at Cape
Clear.
For example, GoogleMail is fielding many queries from places where
online Internet access can be relatively expensive, like Russia and
the Philippines. "People are creating e-mail queries offline and
then going online just to send them," Mr. Newman explained. "Then
they disconnect, and log back on later to download the results."
The service has also drawn interest from blind users, who use
special devices that read them their e-mail. Now those "readers" can
handle Web searches as well. [...]
Just how is Google inaccessible to screen readers? It's almost
entirely plain text. Sending results by E-mail eliminates the one or
two graphics (which already contain alt texts) and nothing more.

Somehow I fail to find this odd. Let me explain just a bit why this seems
"only natural" to me. It's not that they couldn't have run the forms mode
interface from their Web browser. It's that you are more likely to find
them at home in their mail tool than in their Web tool when the question
comes up that they want to ask Google. The Web reaches the World, but does
not subsume it.
Access to interfaces designed for the Web [i.e. the desktop delivery
context] from the 'Tiny' WAP terminal have bombed in the marketplace. Never
mind in a voice transcription. But phoneBots that will read you your email
are a viable commercial service. There's a moral in there, somewhere.
Conjure up for a moment the picture of Curtis Chong telling how his mother
came to use email. Curtis explains that all he had to do was to tell his
mother that email he could read for himself, and hardcopy letters he had to
*pay* someone to read to him. Her frugal traditions kicked in at once and
she learned to use a computer.
Email is the first and prime function of a blind person's computer. It
fills a more universal need that what the Web contributes. WebVan comes the
closest, but it's not available in most areas. Addressed push messaging is
more primitive and endemic than publishing to the World. It's no wonder
that essentially every blind person who manages to get and master a computer
uses email. A lot. The other aps are relatively optional and more spotty
in their uptake. Mail by Web does make your email accessible from an
airport kiosk for the sighted traveler. But it's a sick joke through a
screen reader.
How many sighted people do you know who learn one Ap and never use another?
Spreadsheet people write their letters in their spreadsheet program.
Word-processor natives do spreadsheets in WordPerfect Tables.
A Google search is extremely simple in its interaction logic, so it makes
sense to dispatch it from the tool you're in; not quote go on the web
unquote to do it. This is the point of the Web Services. Encapsulate the
service delivered at an RMI level, and gateway it into the all the spaces
where you can find people who want it.
Even for those not blind it is more natural. Email is the natural push
gesture. Webbing is fine so long as you are pulling.
Got a question? Send a question. That's colloquial. The Web is arcane by
comparison. There are more records in people's email address books than in
their Web bookmarks. The reply you get has links you can pull from, and
you're off and running. Forms mode makes life easier for the computer, not
the person. At least as mediated through a screen reader this is still true.
The firm offering the service by email are doing this because Google handed
them on a platter the web service that they are laying a front end on. All
they had to do was lay a little wrapper around it. They can get the
functionality wholesale. You're going to be seeing a whole lot more of this.
The Web is a natural as the platform integrating the data world that Google
is mining to answer your questions. Not so natural as the last-mile mode of
service delivery. Market share in the final mode of service delivery is
going to ebb back into more naturally-occurring modes of dialog. But the
radical leap of one URI index space will live on under the covers.

The "now those readers can" could be considered technically wrong. Then
again, this kind of sloppy writing isn't anything one can't expect in
today's media. This just reflects the usual level of hype, inaccuracy in
search of emotional punch, that is endemic in the Media. Posting here is
not a way to correct the accuracy level of journalistic writing. [And it's
probably futile to try.] This inaccuracy is not what any blind consumers
ever told the reporter.
If we fail to pick at nits, that's not the issue anyway. If the consumer is
accustomed to using their screen reader to read their email, and not
accustomed to Webbing through it, then they are unlikely to use Google until
it can be accessed by mail. I'm not aware of a MailWatch list sustained by
chronic difficulties in using email through a screen reader. The service is
more accessible to more blind consumers if it can now be accessed by email.
That much is true. And it matters.
For what people will choose to do where they actually have a choice,
'accessible' vs. 'inaccessible' is not a sufficient indicator. Do you eat
something just because it's edible? Email can be more 'palatable' in speech
mode than the fully-accessible Web, if only because it's a mode of operation
whose command set you have more other reasons to use, and thereby remind
yourself about.

this is interesting from several standpoints although I must say that if
you get the question rong, you have to send another email while if you
are on the web interface, you can correct the error in a simpler
fashion. Email in some ways is a lot of work but it is certainly more
universal. The only reason that people do not use the tools that are
most appropriate for other things rather the reasons why this is so is
that one, they may not have the tools and the other is that they do not
know that the tools can do a better job. I am all for an email
interface but there is lots of room for the web here that has it all
over email which are obvious. What we need is for the pull tools to be
so advanced that we can type anything into them and they just present us
with the choices to pick from. If you use the search feature in ie for
instance, it comes close to this but I would love to type into the
address box of ie something like laptop prices and get a whole slew of
places to look or weather for 20902 or time wow, what tijme is it
anyway? these are just examples. Now, we need a good phone search tool
that pulls this stuff down from the web and delivvers it in audio on
command by any phone any where.

It seems to me par for the course in a press release: someone has
added hype to something that's been around for a long time.
By most measures, Google dominates Web searching. Now you don't have
to be on the Web to use it.
Until 1998, I was stuck on the "information dirt track", where
actual download speeds of 100 bytes / sec were a rare luxury.
In those circumstances I used web-by-email myself over several
years. I even implemented such a service in (IIRC) '95.
A new service called GoogleMail gives you e-mail access to the
popular search engine.
Not a bad idea, but certainly not new, and well under an hours work
to implement.
For example, GoogleMail is fielding many queries from places where
online Internet access can be relatively expensive, like Russia and
the Philippines. "People are creating e-mail queries offline and
then going online just to send them," Mr. Newman explained. "Then
they disconnect, and log back on later to download the results."
Yes, that makes sense.
The service has also drawn interest from blind users, who use
special devices that read them their e-mail. Now those "readers" can
handle Web searches as well. [...]
Interesting. It would seem that googlemail have accomplished something.
Not a technical accomplishment, but one of raising awareness and getting
into the mainstream press.
I'll defer to Al Gilman's reply on that subject.
BTW, calling it "googlemail" looks to me a lot like a case of passing
off, using someone elses (deserved) reputation. That kind of (lack of)
ethics puts me right off.

One category that this does apply to is the portable braille &amp;/or speech
notetaker. As far as I know the Braille Lite products (Freedom Scientific)
don't have a web browser application. The Pulse Data is scheduled to release a
browser for their BrailleNote line next month, but the process of upgrading
existing users may be slow. The Elba Linux-based device from Papenmeier
reportedly has browser capability (I haven't seen this one).
