Hi:
I'm having a problem making Amaya 8.2 on Solaris 9, it looks like it
might be a motif error:
My configure is:
../configure prefix=/home/jrankin/Amaya --with-motif
then I try to make it:
gmake SHELL=/usr/bin/bash
and after a while this happens:
Recursive element MTD
Recursive element CellWrapper
DOCTYPE unused
DOCTYPE : won't be created
Construct1 : is a temporary element.
SemanticsContent : is a temporary element.
TableRow : is a temporary element.
MathMLCharacters : is a temporary element.
(if test "../../amaya" != "" -a "../../amaya" != "." -a \
"../../amaya" != "../amaya" ; then \
/usr/bin/cp ../../amaya/EDITOR.A . ; \
/usr/bin/cp ../../amaya/xpm/logo.xpm . ; \
fi)
THOTDIR=../.. ; export THOTDIR ; \
../bin/app -DXML_GENERIC -D_I18N_ -D_MOTIF -D_SVG -D_I18N_
-DANNOTATIONS -
DXML_DTD -DXML_NS EDITOR.A
gmake[1]: *** [EDITORAPP.c] Error 138
gmake[1]: Leaving directory `/home/jrankin/tmp/Amaya/obj/amaya'
gmake: *** [amaya_prog] Error 2
Thank you for your help. Let me know if you require additional
information.

I've try a motif compilation from scratch on linux mandrake but I get no
errors ...
I dont know what is the problem, maybe a solaris specific problem.
If I find something which could help you, I tell you.
