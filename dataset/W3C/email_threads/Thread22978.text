Does W3 specification for DOM provide any explicit details on the order of attributes in an XML. Is there a way to know (after having parsed the XML) the order of attributes otherwise.
Attributes are unordered within an element, I believe, according to XML
and the infoset. The order as well as any whitespace between attribute
names and values is considered insignificant. A parser may conspire
with a DOM implementation to preserve it, but that is not something that
DOM specifies how to do.
While there is some implemented order in which attributes of an element
are returned if the attributes NamedNodeMap is accessed using the
item(index) method, this order is specifically not significant or
guaranteed to match the original document order. In DOM implementations
I have produced personally, attributes are returned alphabetically by
attribute name -- it makes it easier to do a binary search for a
specific attribute by name. I do not doubt that some implementations
may return them in the order in which they occurred in the document, but
it is contrary to the DOM specification to rely on them being accessed
in the order of appearance in the document, and you will find DOM
implementations which will not return them in that order.

You dont require to have an order for the attributes. If it is the case
of the child elements then particular order would be required.
