If you want Tidy to take 98% of CPU usage and fill up your 40 Gig HDD in
less than 3 min do what i did.
Write a Cold fusion script using CFEXECUTE triggering a simple shell
script such as this
#! /bin/sh
/usr/local/bin/tidy -config /etc/tidyconfig.txt /home/user/HTMLFILES/*
to run tidy over a directory full of HTML files. Then make sure in your
tidy config file you have this line == error-file:
/home/user/HTMLFILES/ (pointing to the same directory where the HTML
files are) and run the script. I wonder what happens?
Silly me..been working too hard!!!
By the way this is even more fun when you do it on a major server at
your work place. Lucky it was during a University holiday.

Quote of the day!
You might have mail.
I think I asked this question the other day but never got a reply
Several possibilities could account for that :
1) I replied to the list, not to you directly - I assumed that all posters
to the list are also subscribers - if someone tells me that is a false
assumption, I will start replying to BOTH the poster and list. I personally
don't like receiving duplicate posts. I guess it depends on how smart the
listserv/mail software is.
2) You are in a different time zone, far far away from the host for the
mailing list - there are likely some propagation delays, plus depending on
when you sleep...
3) The reliability of listserv servers, EMail, and the Internet in general
grin .
My comment would be wait at least 48 hours before saying no reply was received.
IS THERE A NEW TIDY.EXE
AN WERE DO YOU GET IT FROM.
I will repeat the answer I gave previously :
Depends on whether you want pre-built binaries for certain platforms, or if
you are capable of downloading the source and building it for yourself.
1) Pre-built binaries (betas, for some platforms) :
2) Source code (current, for all supported platforms) :
Hope this helps.
Regards, Terry
the newest one I know is of 4. Aug. 2000
look near the end for "Source code", there is tidy4aug00.zip and .tgz. At least the .zip also includes the binary of 4. Aug. 2000
