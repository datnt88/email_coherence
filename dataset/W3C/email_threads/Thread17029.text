I need some clarification on this. I have read the Court of Appeals
decision in Hooks v. OKBridge, and it is my understanding the the opinion
applies the Americans with Disabilities Act to the web sites of covered
entities.
However, I was reading some information on Jim Thatcher's web site yesterday
that says "...there has not yet been a court ruling supporting or denying
the concept that the Web, like a store or sidewalk or bus, is a place where
discrimination against people with disabilities would not be permitted."
The following excerpts from the Hooks v. OKBridge decsions lead me to
believe that web sites fall under the ADA:
"There is no reasonable explanation of why Congress would have intended to
draw such a boundary or why it would have chosen such an indirect way of
expressing its intent to do so."
"A commerical business providing services solely over the internet is
subject to the ADA's prohibition against discrimination on the basis of
disability."
"OKBridge is no different than any other commercial business."
"The absence of specific mention of services provided over the Internet does
not restrict the statute's coverage."
"This Court should reverse the District Court's holding that Title III of
the ADA does not apply to commercial business providing services on the
Internet and its holding that OKBridge is exempt from the Act as a private
club."

Hi Randal,
The case of Hooks v OKBridge is kind of complicated. The quotes that
you included are not from the decision - there never was one, the
matter was, I think, dismissed by the court on other grounds. What you
were quoting from was the letter from the Department of Justice which
is automatically consulted for an opinion as to what the law is (again
my memory is hazy - it could have been a different department).
As such their submission to the court stated that they thought a Web
site did come within the ADA and I believe that these submissions are
legally binding statements of the law, which the court would then have
to follow.
However, because the case was dismissed by the court later on in
proceedings, this DoJ submission is not legally binding as the court
never had the opportunity to follow it and adopt it.
Had the case not been dismissed then it would probably have been
America's Maguire v SOCOG. However, at least we now know that if and
when the DoJ is asked again for its opinion we can probably guess what
it'll be.
The DoJ's view partly relies on an earlier case called Carparts v
Automotive Wholesalers of New England (http://harp.org/carparts.txt)
which was the case which decided that for the purposes of the ADA there
was no reason to differentiate between a service provider that operated
out of a shop and one who was telephone-based.
(I apologise if there are any errors in the above as I can't find my
notes, but that is the general gist of what happened)

Yeah, I can confirm that now I've found my folder. The case was rejected on
the grounds that the defendant was unaware of Mr Hooks' disability.
There was an article in Washington Technology Online by Michael Mason
(http://206.144.247.77/cgi-bin/udt/im.display.printable?client.id=wtonli
ne-test&amp;story.id=1815 for the printer friendly/accessible version) which
discussed the Justice Department's 'friend of the court' brief, but was
written before the case was rejected.
The only source I have about the case being dismissed was a post to this
mailing list from Gregg Vanderheiden on Dec 29 2000 - but I don't know
where that came from

Thank for your help in clearing this up, Martin. According to some other
articles that I read on the case, it was dismissed because OKBridge was
not
Hello,
I am interested in cases such as Hooks v. OkBridge and any other cases
involving section 508. More so, a client is asking for any cases or
instances where the court declared an undue burdon on the business. If
anyone knows of a site or resource that covers 508 and undue burdon issues
that would be very helpful.
Thanks

Hi Jason,
I don't know of many cases which discuss the definition of 'undue burden'
except for SOCOG (see
more general advice the UK the Code of Practice is an excellent resource
and is designed to give service providers guidance and advice on what is
likely to be held to be reasonable and what is not - see chapters four and
five.
The Code is available at

There is an often-cited Australian case in which Telstra (who may have then
been called Telecom Australia still) was the defendent, which discussed the
question of "undue burden". The actual case was about whether they had an
obligation tyo provide TTY phones at the same price as standard handsets -
the result was that tey did, and that the price (a large amount of mone, but
a very small proportional increase in what they would charge each client) of
doing so was not un undue burden.

Chaals is not a lawyer. Relying on his advice about legal matters is foolish
- check it with a good lawyer.
