FYI, Mary sent a zipped file containing 268 tests Friday evening:
I also have a few problems with the W3C CVS, could there be a mixup with the
logon accounts? I've been assigned dom-ts-4, I think Curt has dom-ts-1, what
about Mary and Fred?
Best,

If I remember correctly, you're dom-ts-1, Mary is dom-ts-2, Curt is dom-ts-3
and Fred is dom-ts-4.
Hum, seems that these logins are not really practical...

I'll add it to the CVS this afternoon (unless somebody beats me to it).
No, I'm dom-ts-3, or at least that's what I've used to make a change
to bild.xml.
It's too bad the repository uses the names and not the numeric
userids, or it would be a simple matter of renaming. The alternative
is to assign new userids and use them for all future changes. (Most
people I share CVS repositories with know me as "fdrake". ;)

Yes, I am dom-ts-2. I can get far enough
to authenticate myself, but haven't been
able to get anything out...
