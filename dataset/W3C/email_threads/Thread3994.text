The final part of Chapter 4, Nodes, reads as follows:
"Every node belongs to exactly one tree, and every tree has exactly one root
node. A tree whose root node is a document node is referred to as a document.
A tree whose root node is some other kind of node is referred to as a
fragment.".
Since XPath/XQuery operate on the infoset and the infoset is only defined for
the scenario where there is a document node since according to the Infoset
Rec it applies only to well-formed XML documents, I don't see where these
sentences are leading.

This is not a correct assertion. XPath/XQuery operate on the Data Model
which can be constructed from an Infoset (and PSVI). They do not
actually operator on the Infoset since the Data Model is not isomorphic
to the Infoset.
Note as well that XQuery/XPath operators can change the Data Model
instance and we do not define the reverse mappings to an Infoset
representation of these modified Data Model instances. Eventually we
will define how to serialize a Data Model instance into XML and this
will in affect indirectly define the Infoset representation of the
instance.

XQuery builds documents "bottom up": it is possible to construct, and
manipulate, element nodes that have not yet been connected into a document
(and perhaps never will be). The data model therefore needs to describe
these "partial InfoSets", which can exist transiently even though they
cannot be obtained by parsing source XML documents.
