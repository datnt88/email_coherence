I'd like to register with the IETF a new charset according to
Charset name:
ISO-8859-16
Published specification:
International Standard -- Information technology -- 8-bit single-byte
coded graphic character sets -- Part 16: Latin alphabet No. 10,
ISO/IEC 8859-16:2001, 1st ed., International Organization for
Standardization, Geneva. http://www.iso.ch/

Additional information:
Online ISO 10646 mapping table (also part of the printed standard):
ISO 2022 identification:
GZD4 04/02 (ESC 02/08 04/02)
G1D6 06/06 (ESC 02/13 06/06)
Online entry in the ISO 2375 International Register (ISO IR-6 + ISO IR-226):
Online final ISO draft:
Equivalent National Standard:
Romanian Standard SR 14111:1998, Romanian Standards Institution (ASRO).
Intended usage:
"This set of coded graphic characters is intended for use in data and
text processing applications and also for information interchange. The
set contains graphic characters used for general purpose applications in
typical office environments in at least the following languages:
Albanian, Croatian, English, Finnish, French, German, Hungarian, Irish
Gaelic (new orthography), Italian, Latin, Polish, Romanian, and
Slovenian. This set of coded graphic characters may be regarded as a
version of an 8-bit code according to ISO/IEC 2022 or ISO/IEC 4873 at
level 1." [ISO 8859-16:2001(E), p. 1]
This charset is suitable for use in MIME text body parts.
ISO 8859-16 was primarily designed for single-byte encoding the Romanian
language. The UTF-8 charset is the preferred and in today's MIME software
more widely implemented encoding suitable for Romanian.
Best regards,

Is there an Alias for this new Character Set?
I don't see a need for any aliases, but I don't object too strongly if
you really want to add any for consistency with the registration of the
other ISO 8859 parts. The other ISO 8859 parts have various amounts of
aliases registered (mostly for no good reason I suspect), and the
equivalents for ISO-8859-16 would probably be some or all of:
Alias: iso-ir-226
Alias: ISO_8859-16:2001
Alias: ISO_8859-16
Alias: latin10
Alias: l10
In general, I believe that aliases are an evil thing and the fewer there
are the better. Aliases should in my opinion only be used to handle
inconsistent historic practice, but they should not be introduced for
new charsets. The whole point of a registry is to have *single* exact
unique names for objects and conventions after all. The aliases were ill
conceived from the beginning. For instance: The existing ISO-IR-xxx
aliases are technically wrong, because the ISO IR number refers only to
the upper half (G1) of the 8-bit character set, not to the full charset.
Some aliases that contain the year of publication are by now obsolete,
because ISO has published the second edition of the older ISO 8859
parts. These are just some of the aspects why I think the aliases were a
bad idea to start with.
Also note that the capitalization in the registry is inconsistent. It
says "iso-8859-14" but "ISO-8859-15". The entire thing probably deserves
a cleanup.

don't register any aliases.
You need to allocate a MIBEnum, though.

Markus,
Just checking on the Alias as I did not see anything
mentioned. Harald suggested not to put any.
Do you prefer the all caps format or lower case?
Thanks,
Michelle

I would recommend to register a limited set of aliases for iso-8859-16.
They are useful for identification, and also reference in utilities
as recode etc.
I share Markus aim to have as few aliases as possible, and
the aliases I have asked for registration of, were only names that
were in use at the time of registering. For new charsets we
probably do not have that problem.
Markus' set of names seems appropiate to me.
Kind regards

Harald et all.
Please let me know what you decide on the Aliases for this
type. I have seen two different opinions.
Thanks,

I have to say that I don't care which case they are; in fact I think
that leaving some in lower case and some in upper case is a good thing,
because it will remind implementers that case doesn't matter for
charset identifiers. So I suggest not investing unnecessary time
for this.
Regards, Martin.
Character set reviewer decision:
Don't register any aliases.
They were not in the form-as-submitted, can be added later using the update
procedure, and we cannot get rid of aliases we have once entered.
If a need for a specific alias is identified, that is the time to do it.
(yes, Keld, I think it would have been better to have FAR fewer aliases in
RFC 1345. But we are where we are now.)
