hi,
I failed to build amaya, taking the latest snapshot amaya-src-3.2.1.tgz,
due to missing header files:
o EDITOR.h
o TextFile.h
These files are generated by the compiler app. Normally the makefile on Unix
platforms generates the compilers and compile source schemas before compiling
the application amaya.
There is something false in that process.
On what platform are you compiling?
Presumabely the tool cextrac may not recreate these missing files, as they
need to define a long list of preprocessor macros.
How do I get these files? On the NT I do not have access to the CVS
repository
You can download the same snapshot amaya-src-3.2.1.tgz on your windows
platform and
unzip by using a free version of winzip (http://www.winzip.com). Then the
compiling
process is explained in the page http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/Win-Compiling.htm

hi
thanks for the quick response
missing header files:
o EDITOR.h
o TextFile.h
Unix
compiling
An Intel using Visual C6.
All files I have are unzipped from amaya-src-3.2.1.tgz.
I also followed your directions given in
else I would not dare to hassle you.
But, the missing files are not contained in this distribution

That's right. You have first to open the compiler environment
(Amaya\Windows\Compilers\Compilers.mak), build compilers
and start with Amaya\Windows\amaya\amaya.mkf
Then you can open the Amaya environment, and built Amaya.
