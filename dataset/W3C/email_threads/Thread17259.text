Actually, the show I'm gonna be on runs from 17:00 to 18:00 and
repeats from 23:30 to 00:30 hours Eastern time, which I believe is
what, five hours behind London?
They may archive my segment. http://www.cp24.com/homepagehome/ .
The Webcast will presumably work.

Joe,
given your interest, unless it is my crappy home network/security....
(presumably its my crappy system, but I've not had this before)
on winXP it works fine but on an apple G4 running OSX.2 all i get for
any of the links is:
SecureIIS application firewall security alert
If you feel that you have received this page in error, please contact
the administrator of this web site.
What is SecureIIS?
SecureIIS offers websites running Microsoft Internet Information
Server a broad range of protection from common vulnerabilities,
both known and unknown. Because SecureIIS does not protect
against specific vulnerabilities, but classes of vulnerabilities,
it allows for a much more far reaching layer of security.
For more information on SecureIIS, please visit
eEye ? Digital Security -Vulnerability Is Over...

Safari installed itself as my default browser, well it might have been
Chaals, but that is a different story,
this problem seems to be related to Safari, so may not be of such
concern (IE5.2 works fine)

This webcast seems to be cookies, javascript and Windows Media Player
dependant. That the site doesn't seem to offer any plain english explanation
of how it works and what sort of tools are required/available to access this
webcast is probably even worse. Maybe Joe should use the show to point out
the more obvious aspects of accessibility... ;)
