Hi all,
I just got off the phone with Eric Byunn, Navigator's project manager and
he said they are committed to supporting 100% all of the CSS-1 and HTML 4.0
recommendation. He was especially interested to hear that no one supported
some of the features that made HTML 4.0 Web accessible.
Please send me e-mails of tags that do not work and try to make up test
pages to show what the page SHOULD be doing. (Things like LONGDESC etc.)
Be in touch.
