You can use James Clark's SP. You can downlod it and run it
on a PC for example. That's what the online
validator
uses:
If you want to do a more elaborate service you can get the sourse
code of the W3 validator, that includes a few more things.

As far as i can tell, W3C's HTML Validator works only with internet IPs and
URLs. Does the W3C have anything that we can download and use on the
Intranet or for development servers that are behind the firewall. CSS has a
validator i can download.
I know weblint has something that I can download and use but at a cost.
thanks, rob

All these HTML syntax validators are based on the same core component
(SP), but at the moment I believe the most effective package,
including coverage for a wide range of charsets, is the one provided
by Liam Quinn at the WDG,
This is free, but the web page admits that ease of installation was
not their first priority.
If you're working on Win/95/98/NT, then this recently released package
from the same author may be of interest, http://arealvalidator.com/ -
however, there is a modest license fee for that software. I'm just
passing this information on: I must admit I haven't tried that package
myself - but the author has a fine reputation.
Hope that was useful. As you sent your query to the WAI lists, I'm
copying my reply there too; I apologise to anyone who feels this is
off-topic.
all the best
