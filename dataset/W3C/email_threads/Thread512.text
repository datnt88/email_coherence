Subject: tidy rudeness
gee whiz, why can't aug 00 tidy leave &amp;copy; and &amp;nbsr; alone
instead of putting in \251, \240
I must use raw to pass chinese... but why do I have to sacrifice 128
to 256 range too?
here's my settings.

Perhaps you'll need to ask your question with reference to the standards
to which Tidy tries to conform. For example, I found that tid yutends
to clean up those characters which are specific to a certain browser but
not accepted by other browsers. I believe the accepted set of
characters is quite confining.
Is the resulting document unreadable? Or difficult to maintain
thereafter?
In order to remain as close to compliancy as possible, what do you
suggest? Do you suggest that someone look into an option to accept
certain other characters (&amp;copy;, &amp;trade;, etc) ? It might be easier if
you indicate what you'd prefer.

Allan is right. You have to consider who will be reading your page.
The real limiting factor, I think, is the list of entities understood by
Netscape 4.x, which is very limited. For many folks, this is the current
"Lowest Common Denominator" to which they code their web pages.
After that, the next limiting factor may be HTML 3.2, which does not
recognize as many character entities as HTML 4.01, especially left-right
quotes.
take it easy,
Charlie

Please add an option to tidy to remove empty items like
as these are produced when I automatically strip the big5 out of my
pages to make pure English versions [with a homebrew shell script]

I'm worried. New tidy is changing them from numbers to names, while
wdghtml40/values.html#color says "Note that the hexadecimal form is
better supported than the color names for the color attributes of
BODY."
By the way, just as before, tidy is making multi line alt and comments
longer and longer. Indeed, one can tell I've been a longtime user of
tidy by the large amount of whitespace in my multiline quoted strings :-(

By the way, long comment lines are not folded to fit 80 char wide
screens... and if I fold them myself, they get extra blanks added each
successive tidy run

By the way, I also noticed
former chinese becomes:
href=
"http://www.ca.taipei.gov.tw/html/%C2%B9%C3%AF%C2%B7%C3%93%C2%AA%C3%AD.htm"
I know that this is good, but the user now loses touch with what was
written there, unless otherwise marked in the file...
By the way, look:
href="%20%20http://www.remotesensing.org/proj/" proj /A
do you really want to reinforce those spaces?
Hey, and fellas, do you really want to rid this space?

Chinese numbers. The final kilometer is very steep. /P
doesn't emacs depend on it to determine sentences? Try M-e in
emacs!!! geez... i'm double worried now.
how about an option here instead of so bossy...
By the way, for Chinese, this space gets wrapped into the line looking
ugly on browsers...

?A?X?C My pessimistic personality makes me not suitable.

idea for chinese: break sentences on the chinese 16bit comma and periods,
and not just on any char. [oops... i should probably blame emacs
first... looks like tidys problem here is not knowing to wrap right
ok, cant blame it here.]
by the way:
../geocities/qingfuli.html: Document content looks like HTML 2.0
hey, it's chock full of chinese... and i thought one had to be 4.0 to
legally do that
../geocities/romanization.htm: Doctype given is "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN"
../geocities/romanization.htm: Document content looks like HTML 4.01 Transitional
well, OK, so if they are the same isn't it the unix tradition for no
news to be good news? i.e. don't mention it.
Hi,
I have been testing out some off the features on tidycom and followed this
maillist for a while.
Lately there has been a lot of talk on upgrades. Is there anyone working
on the COM side of tidy
on this ?
I've tried mailing Andr? Blavier but I've had no respond.
So I'm putting the question to all of you -
TidyMemToMem(sourceString) - invokes Tidy with sourceString. Returns
tidied string content as a string. (Actually uses a temporary file.)
now..i get
Error Type:
TidyCOM.TidyObject.1 (0x80020009)
Can't create temporary file
when running with this option...and I wanna run it from a string point.
More generally:
Is tidy the option ?
Say you want to extract some html from a site.
You would use XMLHTTP which would give you the responseText or the Ascii
of the site.
You can run this over XSL however since it won't be well-formed....and
this is how I initially
became interested in tidy. I know CF &amp; XML-spy can check similar
stuff...but they don't clean it
up. I have some issues with tidy that I have posed earlier in mails, but
it is a good tools under development.
If anyone can give me a comment on wheter it is the right tool in this
process it would be much appriciated.
Thanks,
Howard
