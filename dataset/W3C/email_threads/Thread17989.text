I review currently the nov 5 draft and each time I do from the first,
I get a queasy feeling about empty alternatives. I understand on the
one hand why and agree with the sentament that the word image repeated
50 11 times is pretty obnoxious. Consider for a monemt though that
an image that has no alt text is one that is downloadable or is
desired to be. if Nothing is rendered, it cannot be found by a screen
reader but through digging out the source assuming one knows that it
is there in the first place. Can we then have a ttoggle for this? so
that we can have either the url or nothing rendered?
Thanks!

David,
An image with no alt text should have information rendered that there is an
image present.
An image with empty ALT text (ALT="") should be suppressed. This is my
understanding of WCAG guidelines recommendation.

yes, but that leaves a hole in access where by the person browsing
with images not loading or using a screen reader misses the
opportunity to gain the information that the image provides. We have
repair techniques for other processes such as table mark up and the
ability to choose to have the url rendered would be a boon for user
configuragility. I'd put it at p3 but still for those that need or
want it it might bee good to consider it. I'm looking at this from
the perspectave of seeing a page with nothing but images on it that do
not have alternative text associated and no other words or elements on
the page. Looks blank to me especially since I'm browsing with images
off?
It just feels strange when I see render nothing here.
Thanks!

aloha, david!
i agree that the issue of empty alternatives is an important one, and one that
has oft given me pause, too...
personally, i believe that the sanest technique is to follow Lynx's lead, and
endow the user with the option to choose:
1. Replace un-ALTed images with a generic placeholder (i.e. [IMAGE])
2. Replace un-ALTed images with the name of the file contained in the IMG
declaration
3. Suppress (hide) un-ALTed images (i.e. render nothing)
if the ALT attribute contains a null value, the user should have the following
options available to him or her:
1. Replace null ALT values with generic placeholders (i.e. [IMAGE])
2. Replace null ALT values with the name of the file contained in the IMG
declaration
3. Respect null ALT values (i.e. render nothing)
additionally, the author should be able to define what is meant by a quote null
ALT value unquote, i.e.:
ALT="" only
ALT=" " only
ALT="" or ALT=" "
(note to speech users -- the first ALT value contains 2 sequential quotation
marks; the second ALT value contains a white space)
of course, the above suggestions are offered with the caveat that they do NOT
apply if the un-ALTed image is part of a hyperlink... in that case, the UA
could:
A. replace graphical hyperlinks that lack ALT text with generic placeholders
(i.e.. [LINK])
B. replace graphical hyperlinks that lack ALT text with the TITLE of the
referred URI (i.e. the text contained within the TITLE element of the document
source for the page referenced by the HREF)
C. replace graphical hyperlinks that lack ALT text with the filename of the
referred document or resource
D. replace graphical hyperlinks that lack ALT text with the URI of the referred
document or resource
of course, it would be of great benefit if all of the above-listed options
could be toggled on and off as easily as they can be in Lynx...

I think it is very important to give authors the opportunity to be
constructive. We (IBM) advocate (http://www.austin.ibm.com/sns/guidelines)
the use of alt="" for images that are redundant or unimportant.

a picture may be worth a thousand words, but i don't necessarily want to hear
each one of them!
there are definitely places where ALT="" (with no space between the quotes or
with a white space between the quotes) is the only logical way to ensure that
the user doesn't become distracted from the content being presented by an
endless litany of meaningless ALT text, such as:
blank space
(if it is blank, why tell me about it?)
decorative graphic
(thanks, but no thanks)
horizontal rule incorporating all of the colors of the rainbow
(why not quote section separator unquote or quote
End First Section / Begin Second Section unquote
or something equally semantically sensible?)
