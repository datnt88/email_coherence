As far as I know, METAFONT describes the shape of each character
using spline paths and a varying brush shape that is dragged
along the path.
It is not an outline font format - please correct me if I'm wrong.
I think for this reason it's value in this context is very small.

That's right, although it could be used to produce font files in an
outline format. Its primary usefulness, however, is the ability to
produce high-quality bitmaps at a variety of resolutions.
On the contrary, I think a high-quality scalable format is exactly what
is needed in this context, although we may want to store both metafont
and compiled bitmap forms of the font on the web server, and let
client-server negotiation be the deciding factor.

What about METAFONT files? While the computational overhead is a bit
stiff, I don't think your average workstation or PC would have a problem
with it. It's also (so far as I know) free of troublesome legal problems,
and already implimented for a variety of machines. It is quite capable of
handling scalable fonts in a wide range of sizes, and several texts are
apparently available on the WWW in TeX format. [1]
I definately agree that having a scalable representation is
a good thing, but spline polygon formats are what current
designers are using to generate typefaces, not METAFONT
paths and brushes.
I agree that METAFONT fonts can be converted into spline or
polygonal outlines, but converting spline outline fonts
into the METAFONT model is somewhere between very difficult
and impossible.
If you want a scalable font technology. I suggest spline
outlines. Since you can't convert nice spline fonts into
METAFONT format, I would not recommend using it as a font
format on the web.
As for legal problems using Type1 or Truetype format. I
don't think there are any. Adobe and Microsoft wouldn't
mind if you decided to use Type1 ot Truetype. They would
love it.
