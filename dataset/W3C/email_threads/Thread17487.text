Hi all,
just a thought but how useful are reset buttons in forms? It strikes me that to give the user an opportunity to accidentally wipe out all the info they have just typed in may not be the best idea in the world. Is the type attribute of "reset" considered to be enough warning for users not to accidentally choose it?
Also, I have seen several instances of the reset button being located before the submit button (both in layout and mark-up flow) which causes momentary uncertainty in my mind so how it's perceived by users with cognitive difficulties is maybe a real concern.
Any views?

I use reset buttons a fair bit on forms for adding/editing records in a
database. In the add situation, removing everything that I have typed may not
be that useful. In the edit situation, however, the reset button restores field
values to what they were before I started messing around.
From an accessibility standpoint, I would say that care should be taken both
with positioning and legend - the same goes for the submit button.
Typically, I have a submit button with a reset button to the right and next in
the tab order. For my database add, the submit button would have the legend
(HTML value attribute) "Create New Record"; with the reset button, the legend
would be "Clear Form". The edit form would have the legend "Save Changes" on
the submit button and "Undo Changes" or something similar on the reset.
I would never rely on default legends (no value attribute) unless I were doing
something only for myself.

Interesting question, in my view it depends on the purpose of the form. In a
long registration form or a questionaire for instance, I would not be happy
to delete all my submissions with one keypress. In general, people don't
change their mind completely when filling out this kind of forms.
On the other hand, a reset button seems necessary in forms that allow to
look up a flight timetable for instance. Maybe you want to start all over
again; in that case it is nice that you don't have to wipe out all options
by hand.
This is indeed really annoying. In most cases you expect people to click the
submit button, so it should get focus first. It can be compared to the
dialog box asking whether you want to save changes to a file being closed.
It is safer to turn the focus to the yes button by default. The reset button
is an alternative but it should not be "promoted" too much to avoid
confusion and accidental use.
Most people expect that the submit button is accessed before the reset
button. I would advice to not break this de facto convention.

As a rule of thumb the reset button should never be present. It is
almost never of any use, and most often just potential harmful as you
rightly say. Joe Clark is telling us the same thing in his book Building
Accessible Websites, page 281: "Reset buttons are a miserable idea...I
have never once found a Reset button that truly needed to be there."
There could be exceptions, but I don't know of any.

I completely concur - I see no reason why any web form should have a reset
button: they're unnecessary and users lose information.
In my experience, using the Refresh/Reload button usually does the trick in
resetting form information in the rare cases this needs to be done. There
seems no need to duplicate this functionality with a form reset button.
When I think of the number of times I have lost data through clicking one of
the evil little blighters accidentally...

I only have one thing to add to this excellent response. It does not matter
where you put the reset button, as long as you provide a safety valve for
it. If the reset button is activated, you can ask whether or not the user
wants to continue with reset or not. I do agree though that reset should be
provided in a place that is not in the way of the submit button. The
problem with putting it after the submit button though is that some people
might want to use it but not find it.

long registration form or a questionaire for instance, I would not be happy
