We have been trying to find a regular AU conference call time that is
generally convenient and doesn't conflict with other WAI group call times.
The proposal is to hold a one and a half hour call every 2nd week on
Tuesday at 3:00pm Boston time beginning January 12. How is this time for
everyone?

Tuesday 3pm Boston works well for me.
(For Europeans it is late in the evening, and for Australians and Japanese
it is really unpleasantly early in the morning, so I guess I am not the
test case here *smile*)
