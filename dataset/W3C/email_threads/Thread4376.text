Hello!
XSLT 1.0 forbids using of disable-output-escaping to generate value of
comment, processing instruction or attribute node. XSLT 2.0 WD states the
same. What's the reason behind this restriction?

XSLT 2.0 allows d-o-e on xsl:attribute, so the restriction has been lifted
at least partially.
I don't know why the restriction was there, perhaps people just felt that
this would provide too much rope for people to hang themselves with. For
example
might produce the output
x="3" y="4"
but on the other hand it might produce
x='3" y="4'
I think it's quite good that we don't allow this - d-o-e causes enough
trouble already.

I'm not on the WG but at least for PIs and comments d-o-e isn't really
appropriate as there is no escaping to be disabled. &amp; isn't special
there,
is well formed despite the unescaped &amp;s and s. Thus a &amp; or  appearing in the
value of these nodes already has to be output by the XSLT serialiser
as if doe was set.

I see. Actually I share the same gut feelings, so I like XSLT2.0 solution.
