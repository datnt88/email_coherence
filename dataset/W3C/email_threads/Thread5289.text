i will not be at the telecon tomorrow due to travel.
one point related to oep though, i am at the daml pi meeting in nyc
where i briefed the oep task force within swbp (and ralph swick had
already briefed the working group overall).
since this is a group of people whose funding depends on their use of
OWL, it is not surprising that they were interested in the working group.
I asked for input as to:
1 - requests for topic areas for notes
2 - suggestions for initial drafts for notes.
jerry hobbs who has working on an entry level time ontology, offered to
generate a draft of a note on how to do time modeling for semantic web
applications.
I have to followup with him to ask about a timing schedule.
