1) In rationale text, I find the sentence that begins
"There are strategies" not useful. It should be
strengthened. (No proposal yet).
2) Checkpoint 2.1.2: Change from:
"The author must be able to change the editing view without
changing the presentational markup defined for the document
currently being edited."
To:
"Ensure that the author may adjust the document
presentation while editing without affecting the
presentation specified for publication."
3) Checkpoint 2.1.3: Change "which" to "that".
4) Checkpoint 2.1.3: Change from "Enable navigation
and editing via the structure of the document" to
"Allow the author to navigate and edit the
document based on its structure."
5) Checkpoint 2.1.5: I don't understand this checkpoint.
What does it mean to edit the structure of the
document? How does this differ from editing the
document?
6) Change first sentence of Guideline 2.2 from
"The first step towards producing content is conformance
with standard, which promotes interoperability." to
"Conformance with standards promotes interoperability
and accessibility."
7) Checkpoint 2.2.2: Change "Extensions to W3C Recs"
to "Proprietary extensions to W3C Recs". I'm not sure
why this is limited to W3C Recommendations, in fact.

These are proposed changes to checkpoint text, that are in some cases
substantial. I have made a much more conservative change to 2.1.2 than
proposed, to bring the grammar in line, changed "which" to "that", and noted
the rest as issues for the group.

There are two things at work here. The first checkpoint is to allow
navigation via the structure of the document, rather than simply sequentially
through all the content. I propose that we add an explanatory note to the
checkpoint "this checkpoint is minimally satisfied by allowing the author to
navigate from element to element" (which is currently stated as a technique.
I propose we remove the "edit" from 2.1.4. It is separate from navigation,
which is why the two were separated, and there may be a differeence in
priority as well.

CMN I agree with both of these proposals
