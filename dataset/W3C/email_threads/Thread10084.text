Sorry this has taken so long. For the most part this is because I've
been trying to divine if all of PFPS' comments have been dealt with or
captured as an issue; I believe that to be the case up to now for the
most part, but:
[all editorial, no ack]
[IIRC this has been responded to but I can't find the thread that deals
with it]
[language tags and datatyped literal design, by Pat Hayes himself. This
is currently being debated on rdfcore]
[aaron's comment on 404s attached to pfps-14. No ack from Aaron]
[EricP's comment about examples in Primer. Frank's prompted him for
reasons why; this is to do with nonopaqueness issue of URLs. No response
from EricP but I think this is captured in other discussion]
[Frank responded with clarification, asking if issue was required, no
response]
[question about illformed collections. related to pfps-12 by Brian]
[ter Horst's editorial suggestions, last not ack'ed]
[DanC on member and collection; recall this being discussed, can't find
a closing message]
[late, another question about creating a class for rdfs:Schema. No ack]
[late, typo, no ack]
[late, JJC asking about appropriate behaviour for rdfs:foobar]
[Massimo: semantic support for Bag/Alt. This was discussed IIRC but I
can't find the thread]
[this is OK, but the response is in the Apr - Jun section, the question
is in Jan-Mar, just if you're looking for it]
That's pretty good going, I think. Basically the "dangling" things are
waiting on an ack from the original poster.

I guess I should ping EricP about this. We talked about this at the
Tech Plenary, and he said he would send me some suggested text, but I
haven't heard back.
Actually, this one is closed. Roland responded off-list, and I
responded with a "closed" message, which did not get attached to the
original thread. See

I propose that in the absence of response from Aaron, including no response
to a follow-up prompting, we consider this point to be resolved/accepted --
i.e. no further action required.

I don't fully understand the requirement here, but it seems like a very
small and probably desirable addition that is requested here. Also, from
the comment, it would seem to improve consistency/interworking with OWL.

The current status is a little unclear in that your response indicates that
you will "add it to your notes". Comments need to be accepted or not. I
suggest you respond indicating either that you will make an editorial
correction or that you don't intend to, marking the comment as closed.

Er, OK, done.
