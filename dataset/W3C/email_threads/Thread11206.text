The ERB schedule calls for voting on Feb. 26 on these items.
3.2.c Should we provide a content model for general links, and if locators
live in subelements, for them?
3.2.d Should we allow these links to contain anything other than the PCDATA
and,
perhaps locator subelements?
Oops, too late I realise I'm not clear on the space of link element
types. Are there two, namely 'XML Analogue of HTML " A"' and
'generalized multilink'? Or three, those two plus 'general link'?
I'm assuming two only, as before, when they were called in-line link
and [I forget].
Yes for subelements of general link ELEMENTS, no for the rest of the content.
Yes, by parity of argument with in-line links.

What are general links?
For in-line links we must allow more than PCDATA. For external links we
could restrict contents to PCDATA + locator subelements.
