Today is the first time I printed the quicktips and the formatting was all
messed up. Has anyone else had this problem? I tried in both color and
black and white.
I cringe to ask this and have put on my flak jacket and helmet as I feel I
am going to take a direct hit, but maybe we should ALSO provide a PDF
version.

The version that's online was never intended to be printed.
The printed version was in Word, made by Alan.
I don't think it was updated.
Sure, something that would print recto/verso at the right size.
(I wrote this before seeing Daniel's message, so I guess you get the reply
in stereo now...)
Robert,
What were you trying to print it from? The "appearance" file? Here's the
scoop on that, but I guess I should add an explanation to the page itself.
The formating that makes it "look like" how it would be on a business card
is done with CSS. Most browser implementations of CSS still barely give a
reliable appearance on the display, and do not at all support consistent
print-out. This doesn't, &amp; wasn't meant to be used to support print-out.
So, we do need an alternative. Given the extreme problems that many people
have with PDF files, I think once this thing is available in the final
version, we should make it available in several alternative file formats,
including Word &amp; PDF.

When I responded to the initial review of the draft quicktips, I failed to
comment on two areas and need to clarify another.
1. Where we say, "Tables. Avoid using tables to format text columns. Make
sure cell-by-cell reading order makes sense for tabular data." When I read
this I see navigation missing, that is, people use tables to format both
text and site navigation links. Do we need to be more specific and address
navigation? I think we are ambiguous here and appreciate comments.
2. When I speak to groups a big question is, "How do I handle Font Size,
Color and Face." To regress, remember some federal agencies require HTML
3.2 or 2 on the internet and intranets to ensure everyone can view their
site. I do not see HTML being used by the government for a long while.
Even though Size, Color and Face are deprecated, I think we need to address
this issue here. One of the biggest arguments I hear is that the use of
these items may cause your page not to be read by older text browsers or may
cause a problem with some readers or viewers. This is not my area so I am
looking for guidance or discussion because seems everyone has an opinion on
this, but what is our position? How do we educate people on their use?
3. Titles? I do not see them addressed here.
appreciate your time and Happy Holidays!

Seems another idea for a quick print would be to make a foldable cut-out.
That is, the center would be a dotted line that marks the place to fold. So
a person would print, cut around the edges, fold on the dotted line and
stick in their wallet.
