The Governing Board of the HTML Writers Guild has just voted to
adopt the motion quoted below, which requires not only that the
HWG's web services be accessible to our members with disabilities,
but also that our partners, on co-branded pages that bear the Guild's
name, are held to the same levels of accessibility.
Our baseline level is single-A (priority 1) compliance with the
WCAG, but look for that to increase as the Guild works on our own
accessibility requirements document. (To be released soon.)
By requiring this not only of ourselves but also of those who seek
to partner with the Guild, we may risk turning down some deals, but
we may also send a strong signal that the Guild doesn't just "talk
the talk" -- we walk the walk on web accessibility, and it's not just
a good idea around the HWG virtual guildhall...it's a core principle
of the way we view the web.
Personally speaking, I'm proud of the Guild's Board for taking this
stand. With over 107,000 members world-wide, I am pleased to be
part of an organization that is willing to use our influence and
our voice to stand up for what's right -- and web accessibility,
my friends, is _right_.

Text of the motion follows:
HWG Governing Board member Kynn has submitted the following
motion for consideration by the Governing Board:
Moved: All web sites operated or co-operated by the HTML Writers
Guild must meet standards of accessibility to disabled and
other users. This standard of accessibility shall at least
equal minimal (Single-A) compliance with the W3C's Web
Content Accessibility Guidelines; further accessibility
considerations for specific types of content may be
added to this standard by executive decision of the President
or a designated subcommittee on web accessibility.
Allowances clause:
Specific allowances or exceptions MAY be made on a case-by-case
basis, by a full vote of the Board.
Grandfather clause:
The Guild will contact existing partners who may not measure up
to our accessibility standards, and offer to work with them on
increasing the accessibility of their web sites. The Board may
have the option of granting allowances on these cases if deemed
appropriate.
Level Single-A Compliance:
The single-A level of compliance with the Web Content Accessibility
Guidelines is defined as meeting all the applicable Priority 1
checkpoints. Those consist of:
[Checkpoints snipped]
References:
Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
WCAG Checkpoints
Reasons: The HTML Writers Guild is one of the leading proponents of
"correctly done" HTML authoring -- which includes not only
validation but accessibility. Therefore, our own sites
_must_ be made accessible to Guild members with disabilities;
to do otherwise is to adopt a "do as I say, not as I do"
attitude.
This resolution would also apply to partners who seek to
co-brand a site with us; accessibility is required for all
pages identified as "official Guild projects", and therefore
all partners would be asked to meet the same standard of
accessibility that we ask of ourselves. This will allow
Guild members with disabilities to have access to any and
all services provided by the HTML Writers Guild to our
members.

Kynn,
congratulations to you and the board. On the one hand this seems like a
logical step by the HWG given its involvement in W3C working groups (WAI and
non-WAI groups), but making a public announcement of it is bound to help the
wider community understanding of accessiblity as a basic technical issue.
Cheers

Charles, that's my thinking exactly. The Guild has a membership of
more than 107,000 web designers world-wide (and if you're not a member,
join now! -- trial membership is free), and as such we are one of the
largest organizations that is _actively addressing_ web accessibility.
In short, we want to make it known without a shadow of a doubt that we
consider this to be important, by putting our money where our mouths
are (and this may cost us some partnerships!) and making a strong
statement about the importance.
We've always (as an organization and on the Board) supported accessibility;
this just makes it "official" and public, and hopefully can serve as a
model for _other_ organizations and businesses to get them looking at
their own accessibility policies.
I believe in throwing the Guild's weight around for a good cause. :)
