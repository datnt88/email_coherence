Folks,
I'm sorry but the agenda for tomorrows telecon will be late. I'll do it
first thing tomorrow, uk time. In general it will aim to consider
publishing the concepts and syntax WD's, to address the high priority
issues per my recent post, consider cross doc consistency issues and check
on status of other docs.

Wish I could say same for RDFS. My aim now is to have something for the WG
by close of play friday...

If things work out as planned, I expect to have a new Primer ready for
review for tomorrow's meeting.
