An authoring tool developer commented that parts of Guideline 6
"Provide methods of checking and correcting inaccessible content"
drift too far into prescribing exactly how designers are to design their tools.
He agrees with 6.1, 6.2, and 6.4 :
6.1 Check for and alert the author to accessibility problems. (Priority 1...
6.2 Assist authors in correcting accessibility problems. (Priority 1 for ...
6.4 Allow the author to override any removal of unrecognized markup. [Priority
2]
But feels that 6.3, 6.5, and 6.6 are too prescriptive AND not required for
generating accessible content:
6.3 Allow users to control *both* the *nature* and *timing* of accessibility
alerts. [Priority 2]
6.5 Provide the author with a *summary* of the document accessibility status *on
a configurable schedule*. [Priority 3]
6.6 Allow the author to perform element transformations. [Priority 3]
These three are really techniques and possible design features for meeting the
first 3 checkpoints. The "how and when" of checking or alerting or assisting
are part of the design of the tool and not always under control of the user.
Requiring a feature [Priority 2] to allow the user to have control of both the
nature *and* timing is a tall complex development order, is unclear which alerts
[all?] are applicable, and is unspecified about definition of *timing/schedule*
and *summary*. For example, is providing only one choice on timing adequate?
Either at time of image insertion and/or when executing the access checker
function? Is a Green, Yello, Red indicator summary adequate, or does it need to
be a log file for each element of the page?
The proposal is to move these 3 into the techniques documents *or* make them all
[change 6.3] priority 3 AND simplify/clarify the checkpoint wording. For
example:
6.3a Allow users *some* control over the accessibility alerts. [Priority 3]
6.3b Allow users *some* control over the format/nature of the accessibility
alerts. [Priority 3]
6.5 Provide a summary of the accessibility status. [Priority 3]
in the techniques include a list of suggestions, including # of images
without ALT=text, etc.
delete the part about the configurable schedule
Quoting from the techniques document: "The art of attracting users' attention is
a tricky issue. The way users are alerted, prompted, or warned will influence
their view of the tool and their opinion of accessible authoring. " is the
concern express here with 6.3, 6.5, 6.6. I believe we can be more exact in the
checkpoint wording in a future release of the guidelines once we get more
techniques implement by authoring tool developers AND we get more data on which
techniques are more effective. I believe we are now relying more on our "wants"
and "ideas" of what will be effective and we need to work more with developers
on implementing the basics.

I agree that 6.5 and 6.6 are not required, or even especially important,
although they are beneficial, hence the P3.
I think that part of the configurability for 6.3 is in fact an issue of user
interface accessibility. It is important, if not essential, that the alerting
be configurable by the user as part of the general requirement for
configurability of the user interface.
I would support a change to making the nature and timing of alerts a P3
requirement (or two) or of moving them to techniques. I would like to note
the relationshipto user interface accessibility with a cross reference, and
since I think it is more important from an interface perspective than an
authroing perspective I am inclined towards making it a technique, which will
mean the cross reference is less confussing in terms of suggesting a possible
conflict in priority level.
Thanks for the suggestions about how to make the techniques more helpful -
I'll put them into the next draft unless someone thinks it isn't a good idea.
cheers

aloha, charles!
i promised twice today to think twice before i posted after one a.m., but,
after thinking twice about it, it occurred to me that the only reason
checkpoint 6.6 is a P3 is that table navigation is a P1 requirement for a
dependent user agent, so i suppose you would not be placing an undue burden on
a blind author to require him or her to ALT-TAB (or spawn a new shell) to run a
dependent user agent in order to hear (and/or feel) if his labor has born fruit
or been in vain... i just hope that he or she is using a triple-A authoring
tool, that produces quote content that conforms to the W3C's Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines unquote...

Hi Gregory.
One of the nice things about inheriting the Web Content Accessibility
Guidelines in the way we do is that it means that it is, for example, a P2
requirement that tables make sense when linearised.
Our guidelines rely on the Web Content Guidelines to have correctly
prioritised their requirements. This is not a bad thing - otherwise we would
all end up spending our time doing other people's work.
I do take your point, but I think that transformations, as provided by 6.6
wouldn't really solve the problem - it is reliance on guidelines 3 and 4 that
are going to prove more helpful, along with checkpoints 6.1, and 6.2.
