Hi All,
On Feb. 9 I asked several questions re: Tidy Beta version 15-Jan-2004, and
received some good help in operation. However, one error keeps getting
introduced. Note... the version in use is a plug-in to Chami's HTML-Kit
Version 1.0, Build 292, on Win-98.
After a beautify function, a non-visible, non-us-ascii character is being
added somewhere in several strings. It seems to be happening on a line
which includes br / by itself, or a space after /a at the end of a line,
or when there are two spaces between a period and the beginning of the next
sentence (such as in "...word. Word...")
The xhtml 1.1 validator hiccoughs at such a time, can't say what the
character is, and won't proceed.
Does anyone know how to make whatever this character visible so that it can
be edited out? And, of course, it should be looked into for the next build.
Thanks.
Harold Baughan

It'd be best if you try the command line application to reproduce the
problem with an ideally simple test case. If you are able to reproduce
it, send a message to the list or file a bug report on the sf.net site.
I cannot fix bugs I cannot reproduce.
By default, Tidy does not generate non-ascii output unless there are
non-ascii characters inside constructs where it cannot use character
references (comments, for example); in this case the characters come
out garbled. So there must be some configuration option active,
-latin1 for example. If the character is not visible it is most likely
U+00A0 (&amp;nbsp;). Tidy would insert them e.g. if there is a nobr
element in the source document.
A hex editor would probably work best, if you don't have one yet, there
are lots freely available. Certain viewer applications might also help,
e.g. the Total Commander file manager supports hex view. You could also
put the file online and I'll have a look.
Thank you, Bjoern.
reproduce the problem with an ideally simple test case.
There's the rub. If I could figure out how to make the character *visible*
I could isolate it without tying up the W3C on-line validator. I tried
"filtering" text through the plain-text Notepad program, but that didn't
clean anything.
I shall attempt this approach... The next time it pops up, I will save it as
a new document, and then delete everything around the problem area. That'll
create a short file which may be emailed to anyone who cares to look -- or
post it to my site.
My own personal bet... it will now act like an upset stomach the instant you
walk into the doctor's office. ...And go away for a while. :-)
I shall also look for that hex editor. Hmmm. Could the problem be
something else that I'm not seeing yet? Such an editor might even prove
Tidy to be innocent of all charges!

Hello Bjoern,
Give the man a cigar!
I have not been able to find a nobr element in the source text. However,
I obtained a copy of the Frhed Hex editor and through it's eyes saw the evil
little creature in the final text. An a0. When I copy it in context from
the hex editor into this email, it comes out as follows --
"So, was it John Curtis? bh:a0 Or perhaps the namesake of "
But now I've bounced around so much and tried so many things that I cannot
specifically remember/prove that the *only* source could have been Tidy.
(There were two spaces after the punctuation in the original text.) So it's
time to backtrack and re-investigate. sigh

Hello Bjoern,
Re-examination is now complete. I think I've isolated the problem...
Text was copied from an HTML 4.1 file via Notepad and pasted into an XHTML
1.1 file. Adjustments were made, Tidy was run, and the result was validated
with the W3C on-line validator. The file validated properly as XHTML 1.1
under this declaration...
!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN"
"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd"
Then I ran the Beautify function using Tidy Beta. Now the on-line validator
responded...
Sorry, I am unable to validate this document because on lines 92,
99-101, 103, 106-107, 129-130, 138-139, 142, 146-147, 149, 154-157,
161, 163-165, 169, 175-176, 182, 188 it contained one or more bytes
that I cannot interpret as us-ascii (in other words, the bytes found
are not valid values in the specified Character Encoding). Please
check both the content of the file and the character encoding indication.
The first occurrence appeared in this snippet.
89 /p
90 /td
91 /tr
92 /table
93 /div
For this, the Frhed editor shows
\ /p
\ /td
\ /tr
\ /table bh:a0
\ /div
So, there might be a *couple* of things going on, here. Last night I might
have imported an "a0" when there were two spaces after punctuation, the
first one being an &amp;nbsp; . That would be my fault. However, *this* one is
definitely coming from the Tidy beautify function.
Note that when the validator responds with more than one line number
(99-101) it is indicating that the last character on the first line is
bh:a0 , then there are space characters bh:20 up to the first character
of the next line.
I hope this helps you to repair the problem.
Question... should I change from us-ascii to another character set in the
meantime? Which one? Thanks.
A curious item... I looked at the file with Netscape 7.0. At every bh:a0
a question mark showed up in a black diamond. So, at least the problem
points are now visible! Why is this curious? ...Because I seldom have
anything nice to say about Netscape, and this time it was actually useful.
I am not on the distribution list, so the only way I can receive a response
is directly. Good luck with this one.
Cordially,
Harold Baughan
