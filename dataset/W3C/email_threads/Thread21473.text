Hi Jacek,
thanks for this. I've been trying to compose a response. As things stand I
can't represent anyones views other than my own, ie. I can't speak for the
RDF groups. I'll get a reply out asap. Also I'll send heads-up to SemWeb
CG and RDF Core WG.
Short preview: I agree that pluggable encodings allows RDF etc to be
serialized. But there is a large cost associated with using alternate
encodings, so we should invest some effort in mapping RDF into SOAP's
object model. Maybe the resolution of the issue could be refined to ack
that we don't encourage folks to diverge from using the default SOAP
Encoding model/syntax.
what's your view?

Hello Barbara, Dan,
we kindly request your opinion on whether the following proposed
resolution to our issue #29 [1] is satisfactory for RDF and UML -
the groups you seemed to represent in our debate "re: Exist
non-serialisable data models?". The proposal is copied from my
message [2].
The proposal:
"SOAP specifies how to encode data from the object-graph data
model. SOAP also allows the encoding of other data models
representable in XML using custom encoding rules identified in
the encodingStyle attribute information item in a message.
Therefore no data models exist that are serializable to XML but
not serializable to SOAP."
Please note that the issue 29 is based on our requirement R402
[3], therefore we ask you whether you see any obstacles in SOAP
that would prevent you from serializing data in your models, RDF
and UML, as data inside SOAP messages.
The XMLP Working Group will discuss this issue on its telecon on
Wednesday Nov 7, so we'd like you to respond by close of business
on Monday, Nov 5. In the absence of any issues raised by you (or
by anyone, of course) we'll consider the resolution satisfactory.
Sincerely,
Jacek Kopecky

I agree with Dan - using a pluggable encoding for MOF/UML models is a
minimal solution that should work, but the preferred solution is to provide
a mapping from MOF/UML into the SOAP object model. We have already done
something like this between MOF/UML and XML Schema, and believe it should
be possible here too. I will open an issue in the OMG XMI Task Force for
this, and stay involved on the w3c side.

Glad we agree. Getting the SOAP object model formalised looks to be
something of a priority.
I've just forwarded my response to xml-dist-app. Could you copy a reply to
this msg over there too, so we surface our offlist discussions to the
WG...?
