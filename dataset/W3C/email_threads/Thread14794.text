You will have successfully met Checkpoint 1.4 at
Level 3 if: ...
There are no background pictures or patter[n]s behind foreground
content.
Question: Does a background image need alt text? If so, how should
it be recognizable?
Regards/Harvey Bingham
No, it does not - unless the text is *essential* to understanding the page (few
background images are however - they are mostly presentational).
If the image is essential (does the page make no sense if you removed it?), then
you could include separate text on the page, providing the same function of the
image.

The same would apply, I assume, for images that are the backgrounds of table
cells.

More to the point, by using styling effects to convey information needed to
understand the page you are breaking the checkpoints that require seperation
of style and the page's information...
If your background image conveys information it shouldn't be a background
image - it should be a part of the information of the page.
