I wished to tidy my XML document. However, I found several problems:
1) unless I manually typed all custom tags to the edit-preference, tidy
complains about each of them. Is there anyway to make Tidy assume all new
tags are OK? Or better still can Tidy accept microsoft x-schema definitions?
2) If I do not say input is XML, then it will do a lovely thing: it converts
br "s to " BR / ". However, it won't happen if I tell tidy that it is XML.
OTOH, if I don't say input is XML, then Tidy always add some HTML tags
(head, title, etc) to my file. How can I have BR / conversion but without
the head etc tags added?
Tidy doesn't know how to parse unknown elements and hence
requires you to declare them. This can be done in a config
file.
If you specify the output is to be XHTML, then the head and body
elements etc. will always be present since that is how XHTML is
defined.

Why not do it the long way around?
Let Tidy add the header and trailer lines you don't want,
but then strip them out? For example, in UNIX, you could do
tidy -asxml InputFile | sed -e '1,/^ body /d' -e '/^ \/body /,$d'  OutputFile
(throw away lines from the beginning up to and including body ,
throw away lines from and including /body to the end,
copy the rest)
It worked when I tried it.
