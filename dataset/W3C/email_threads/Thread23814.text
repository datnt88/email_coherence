Speaking as a designer, producer and user of type, I have some concerns about a
technology such as TrueDoc. As I understand it (and no doubt someone will
correct me if I'm wrong) TrueDoc converts each font into a new proprietary format
which allows for easy compression and transmition. At the other end, the font is
reconstituted and "autohinted" thus reestablishing some level of screen quality.
While this scenario may produce satisfactory bitmaps in many cases, it will
certainly fail for a significant portion of the fonts in the marketplace today. In
particular, any TrueType font which has been extensively tuned to provide
optimal screen bitmaps will be in jeopardy when TrueDoc is used to convert and
compress it for use on the Web.
How confident can a Web publisher be that the reader will see the same thing as
he/she is designing on the Mac or PC which is on their desktop.

I also have some reservations. One problem is that the TrueDoc scheme is
based on blowing up characters to a large size on the source platform,
and then re-digitizing them. Many Japanese fonts come with some builtin
limit for enlargement (means you have to pay extra if you want to use
these fonts for characters in display sizes). With such fonts, it may happen
that what TrueDoc wants to do is not possible, or only at restricted quality.
Also, one has to be aware of the fact that while in the US, only the imple-
mentation of a font (i.e. the font program) is copyright-protected, and thus
TrueDoc fonts most probably can be passed around freely, many other countries
have more strict (and more reasonable) copyright protection of fonts,
protecting also the design. Therefore, if TrueDoc fonts are not strictly
linked to the documents that they have been generated for (this may be
the case; I don't know the details), this scheme may not be feasible
worldwide.
Well, apart from the problems of screen resolution, color lookup table
congestion, white temperature of the display, and other details of
illumination and such, there is a very failproof way already to be
sure your reader sees the same as you do: Use bitmaps :-!

TrueDoc is a font transport mechanism which preserves font fidelity.
We have had several font designers try to distiguish between printed
and screen output for Type 1, TrueType, and TrueDoc. They were correct
about 1/3 of the time.
Because of TrueDoc's high quality, multiplatform support, and
professional SDK, TrueDoc won the Seybold 96 Technology Trailblazer
award. Also, both FutureTense's Texture product, and Tumbleweed's
Envoy Publishing Essentials were Seybold Hot Picks (both rely on
TrueDoc).
As for bitmaps - when they are moved from device to device with
different resolutions, they just don't work. glen_rippel@bitstream.com
