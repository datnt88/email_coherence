I certainly don't consider this abuse of the list :-)
Anyone know if there are plans to work DAML into a W3C working draft?

There needs to be a draft of a DAML specification and a W3C
Working Group chartered to address the relevant area before
a Working Draft can be created.
I do expect to watch the DAML work very closely, of course,
and hope to solicit participation in a Recommendation-track
activity if the appropriate opportunity arises.
