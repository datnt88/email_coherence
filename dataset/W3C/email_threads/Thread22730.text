CSSStyleDeclaration provides means to determine the style properties
currently set in a block or to set style properties explicitly within
the block. All methods in CSSStyleDeclaration assume that there is only
one answer per property name. But this is false, unless part of the
cascade is done :
P { color : red ! important ;
color : blue ;
color : yellow ! important }
Without applying some of the rules of the cascade, the CSS OM cannot
answer that the value of color assigned in this block is |yellow| with
and cannot answer it is an important declaration.
Anyway, I think that the CSS OM should provide access to ALL explicitely
set values for a given property, in order of declaration, without
applying the cascade.
I agree. We optimized the representation of the styleproperties from the
CSS file. But you will never be able to use |red| or |blue| informations
in the representation of your document.
Could you please provide a use case?
We already acknowledged in the past that the CSS Object Model wasn't
suitable for CSS editors given that a lot of informations are lost
(white spaces, character representation, comments).

You gave yourself the answer : for an editor, the CSS OM lacks a lot (I
mean, really a lot) of things.
Permitting multiple instances on the same property in a rule will mislead
the CSS author. He will never be able to use them with a CSS engine. So
I'm still wondering how useful it is to represent them in the CSS OM except
for round-tripping.
Regarding CSS comments, there is still an open issue in our list but there
is no real advocate for them (the CSS WG would be a good advocate).
In the meantime, I would suggest to have a look at the SAC proposal:
Philippe
Really ? What if the rule contains the 'margin' shorthand and the
'margin-bottom-width' property ?
Basically, I don't why the DOM WG needs CSS WG input to preserve some data
that are preserved in other languages, for instance xml-based languages.
It clearly affects stylesheets produced by web authors (I mean document
and style providers). For me, they are users.
Then, according to the DOM, asking for the value of 'margin' will return
'', and asking for style.cssText will return a gazillion shorthand
properties. That's the CSSOM for you...
Another great problem with the CSSOM:
p { color: green; border-top-color: red; border: solid; }
...what's the value of 'border-top-color' for that declaration if you ask
for it via the CSSOM? According to the spec, ''.
Now if we have:
p { color: green; }
...what's the value of 'border-top-color' for _this_ declaration? ''.
How can you tell if 'border-top-color' is set? (Hint. In the first
declaration, it is set twice.)
This issue was originally raised by David Baron many moons ago, although
I've never seen a response to it.
(Note for those not familiar with the CSS spec: the first example sets the
value of 'border-*-color' to its initial value, which is defined as being
whatever the value of the color property is. Thus the color of the border
would be green, not red.)

that's a little odd since the 'color' attribute sets the font color not the border. the 'border-*-color' sets individual colors and the 'border-color' sets all border colors. the problem is knowing wish of them take precedence. normally, for what i have seen, the one that is define last will take precedence to the other but I could be wrong
