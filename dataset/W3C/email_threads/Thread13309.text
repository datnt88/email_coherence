Peter,
How closely have you been following the discussion in the
Evaluation and Repair Interest Group of the WAI? There they are
talking about something like your "standard letter" in terms of
an interactive website which would sent mail to sites which
visitors find inaccessible.
If you work with that team, there is "English repair" available,
and your experience and enthusiasm would be valuable.

Hi Chuck,
I think you checked Toys for Blind and Visually Impaired Children with
Bobby after they make their pages accessible. They now have add ALT tags
to the menu options and in my opinion this website is NOW ACCESSIBLE.
Thanks to the AFB, members of these listing and those people working behind
the discussion and help to make this website accessible.
Let we all learn for the future and try to get more websites accessible.
Websites where no blind organizations are involved.
But there are some unsolved questions remaining?
I think it is important that a standard message becomes available that
individual visitors of an inaccessible website can send to the webmaster to
ask him or her to make such a website accessible. A message that give the
webmaster short information about the problems of the disabled accessing
the web and how they can solve it.
I have the knowledge creating such a message, but english is not my native
language and too poor to do it.
Bobby is a good feature and I often use it. But there are some webmasters
I can not ask to use Bobby to check their website, because Bobby said
Congratulations there are no accessibility errors. You can see an example
at http://www.vpro.nl. This website is realy inaccessible.
There are websites that are not accessible because the designer didn't know
enough about accessibility. But there are also webdesigners who know their
websites are not accessible but say it is commercial not of interest to
make these websites accessible for all kind of browsers. In practice this
means that people who can not handle images and image maps can not access
these websites.
Why don't we make a black list for such unwilling websites owners?

Peter,
I don't disagree at all with your statement regarding Bobby. An electronic
validator can only do so much although we are able to check most of the
priority
one items from the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative working guidelines. If
you
run Bobby on the toy site, or most any site for that matter, you will notice
that there are many additional recommendations and tips provided by Bobby.
These
are over and above Bobby approved but do require attention.
By the way, we cannot know what combination of browsers, screen readers,
magnifiers, single and multiple switch controls, and other adaptive
hardware and
software will be in use by an individual user so I agree that we cannot
really
say that a web page or any digital environment is truly accessible for every
possible situation.
Chuck

Hi Chuck,
If you say that this homepage is quiet accessible it says more about Bobby,
than about this website. You are right that the problem is that ALT tags
are missing and I argued before that this website was not accessible
because there were no ALT tags. As Lynx user you can click on a menu item
without description and see there what the menu option was. The website is
accessible if the blind users get the same menu as the sighted people.
I found Bobby a good tool, but you can never say the website is accessible
because this tool said so.
It is true that the website Toys for Blind and Visualy Impaired Children
can be made accessible in 15 minutes. This is what I wrote in my message.

I just checked the Toys site with our Bobby validator and discovered that
the
home page is quite accessible but that most of the other pages, if not all
others, do need alt text and few additional improvements. You can try this
yourself by going directly to http://www.cast.org/bobby. Type in the toy
site
URL or any other ULR such as http://www.plex.nl/~pverhoe and click the
submit

Our free web access validator is available to the Toy Manufacturers

with

Hi all,
Today I visit the homepage of "Toys for children who are blind or visually
impaired". After loading this page I got tears my visually impaired eyes.
Not because I was glad that such important information for the kids and
their parent was on the web, but because of because the pages are not
accessible!
The tears in my eyes changes to a real river after I read that the American
Foundation of the Blind has to do something with this website.
It is not my daily job to visit websites and analyse them to see if they
are accessible. But I'm doing this on a volunteerly base. I try to give
people information about how they can make their webpages more accessible
for everybody. I do this on my The Screen Magnifiers Homepage, that has a
special Accessibility corner and I do that as co-editor of a Dutch e-zine
about accessibility.
I can understand that a lot of webpages on the Internet are not accessible
because the webmaster have not the knowledge about accessibility. But I can
not understand, that a website created on the subject of toys for people
who are blind or visually impaired can be so inaccessible and I can not
understand that a blind organisation like the American Foundation for the
Blind can agree with such an inaccessible website?
It seems to me that the American Foundation for the Blind has no idea what
the problems are for visually impaired people regarding access to the
Internet.
What is wrong with this website?
If you disable your browser loading images or use a text-oriented browser
like Lynx or Net-Tamer you only see IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE in the menu.
They "forget" to use ALT tags with that images. I think it takes 15 minutes
to make this website accessible. I could not find an E-Mail address for
feedback.
If somebody knows who is responsible for this website? Please forwared them
this message.

Hi,
I only read the WAI document about how to make websites accessible.
I have given some webmasters the URL to that document, but a lot of them
feel it is to much information. So I'm very interested in this group.
It is no problem for me to translate english documents in to Dutch, but if
they are very large it cost me too much time.
Thank you.

Hi Peter,
The report form that Al was referring to is at
We'd very much like to hear what you think of it.
It's part of an effort within WAI, "Evaluation and Repair" (ER) to create
tools to help evaluate web pages,
tools to help webmasters make their pages more accessible,
and tools, such as proxy tools, to transform existing web pages into forms
more friendly to screen readers, by techniques such as adding ALT text,
linearizing tables, etc.
This effort has in turn two groups, a working group (Chair, Daniel
Dardailler) which will create the tools, and an interest group (Chair, Len
Kasday) that will help the working group decide what to implement. By the
way, this interest group is called wai-er-ig and is different from the
general wai interest group, wai-er that most people are on.
For more information, see
The call for participation at
The mailing lists are archived at
