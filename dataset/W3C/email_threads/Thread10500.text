We have had quite a few regrets and no suggestions for the agenda so I
am cancelling this Friday's telecon.
The following Friday, 24 Nov is the day after ISWC. I will be
travelling that day, and in the conference the three days before, so
regrets from me.
I suggest we consider that telecon at risk for now. We can see if next
week if a possible agenda is shaping up. Early indications of any
regrets would be helpful.

I'll also be travelling on 24 November.

Have I fallen through a black hole or something
and lost a month of time, or is this still October?
I'm guessing that the dates in question are Oct 17
and Oct 24, not Nov 17 and Nov 24...

Oops I should have said 24 Oct
