we have to process part of a Intranet site. How could we process all html
files in all subfolders (and 'subsubfolders) at once with HTML Tidy?

Depends on your platform.
If you use the Mac OS versions of Tidy, this is very easy. Just drag&amp;drop
any files/folders/disks to the GUI versions of Tidy for Mac OS, change any
necessary configuration settings, click the "Use now" button, and go... If
you want to use a command line version of Tidy for Mac OS, using MPW, you
can use the powerful built-in scripting language of MPW, to easily automate
the same operation.
Be aware that I haven't released updated versions of Tidy for Mac OS, based
on the current Tidy code.
For MS-DOS/UN*X platforms, it should be very easy to write a batch
file/shell script to automate this procedure with a command line version of
Tidy. While I could probably suggest such a script, I will leave it to
others on those platforms to provide further help - I'm sure this has been
solved many times before.

Depends on your operating system, for example (assuming you want to
modify the files in place, backup your files first)
Unix:
find /intranet/site -name '*.htm*' -exec tidy -m -additional-parameters
Windows NT:
cd \intranet\site
for /r %f in (*.htm*) do tidy -m -additional-parameters %f
Windows 9x:
Get a port of the Unix "find" command (Cygwin, GNU)
Or, generate a list of files using dir /b *.htm*  list.bat
Edit list.bat by prefixing every line with tidy -m
-additional-parameters
Terry provided instructions for MacOS already.

Thanks,
as I didn't mention the operation system we are working on (unfortunately
for me not a Mac) I will try solutions for UNIX and W2K
