Subject: indent tidy
Hi
i've a question a minor problem ( i think), i'd like that tidy object
doesn't return a break when meeting href tag:
"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" b a
href=
"http://www.e-mailtouch.com/etointerne/ms/eto-p5.htm"
target="_blank" img src=
i'd like to have :
"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" b
a href="http://www.e-mailtouch.com/etointerne/ms/eto-p5.htm"
target="_blank" img src=
here's my setting:
TidyObj.Options.Doctype = auto
TidyObj.Options.DropFontTags = false
TidyObj.Options.OutputXhtml = false
TidyObj.Options.Indent = 2'2 'AutoIndent '2
TidyObj.Options.IndentSpaces = 3
TidyObj.Options.TabSize = 2
TidyObj.Options.Wrap = 72
TidyObj.Options.IndentAttributes = false
TiDyObj.Options.WrapAsp = true
TidyObj.Options.QuoteMarks = false
TidyObj.Options.QuoteAmpersand = false
TiDyObj.Options.BreakBeforeBr = false
TiDyObj.Options.Clean = false
TiDyObj.Options.ShowWarnings = true
I need to autowrap absolutly
what option do i need to force for parsing html correctly?
Thx for your answer

Hi Yann,
Just so you know, the reason Tidy does not break between anchor A /A
tags is that putting such breaks in will add whitespace to documents and
alter how the page looks in the browser. Is this something you want?
I don't think there is an option (or any combination) that will do what you
want.
take it easy,

Greetings Charlie,
Unfortunately the C version of Tidy does insert whitespace between an
IMG and /A tag (and I think in other situations) which throws things
out.
The simplest example I came up with is
!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01
Transitional//EN"
"HTML Tidy for Solaris (vers 1st January 2002), see www.w3.org"
META http-equiv="Content-Type" content=
TD width="203" height="22" valign="top" A href=
"../images/home.gif" width="110" height="22" alt="Home" /A A
"0" src="../images/news.gif" width="93" height="22" alt=
"News" /A /TD
Here tidy breaks the line at the end of the first IMG and /A producing
TD width="203" height="22" valign="top" A href=
"../images/home.gif" width="110" height="22" alt="Home"
This has been entered into the sourceforge bug tracker database.

Hi Philip,
Yes, I am aware of the bug you mention. Has it been fixed in the Java version?
I was only describing the general behavior of Tidy - and its
rationale. Yann wants to go the other way and have newlines added.
