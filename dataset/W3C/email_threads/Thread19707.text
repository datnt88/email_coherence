The most outstanding feature of this version is WindowsNT/95 support.
Nice! Way nice!
Congratulations, team.
I just installed it on both NT 4.0 and Win95 4.00.95B.
First thing I notice: The Views menu comes up with checks on all the
views. Selecting, say, the Structure view doesn't change the checkmark.
Second thing: on Win95 I quickly got "AMAYA caused an invalid page fault"
(in kernl32.dll). What is the best way for me to help debug such things?

Hi Ralph,
I will correct this problem in the next release.

fault"
(in kernl32.dll). What is the best way for me to help debug such
things?
This alpha release of Amaya has not been tested on Windows 95.
This will be done as soon as possible.

Yes, I saw that in the release notes; I will keep that in mind. If there
is any useful information that I can provide as I "live dangerously", feel
free to let me know. Otherwise I won't bother you with my Win95 experiences
if you would prefer to wait.
Thanks again; I'm looking forward to learning Amaya!
