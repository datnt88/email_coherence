I successfully compiled amaya-2.1 on my linux system (libc5,XFree).
However, it would not properly display the www.altavista.com page.
Specifically, the search entry line was not correct.
I also tried to compile amaya with --enable-plugin. It failed because
the file "editplugin.c" tries to include the file "app.h", but that
file does not exist in the include directory. There is a file called
"application.h" there but substituting "application.h" for "app.h" did
not work either.
Thank you for your efforts.

Hello,
In our previous episode, eneafse@luc.edu said:
The Altavista home page has many HTML errors, one of which confuses
the Amaya parser as to where is the end of the form. You can check
them out with http://validator.w3.org/.
Unfortunately, you're right. It's been over one year since we last
touched/tested the plugin code. We need to upgrade it so that it conforms
to the current state of the Amaya code.

We needed to rename the file app.h due to conflicts on Windows platforms and
we forgot to update the file "editplugin.c".
The new name is appstruct.h.
This is the patch for the file "editplugin.c":
- #include "struct.h"
+ #include "appstruct.h"
Regards
Irene.
