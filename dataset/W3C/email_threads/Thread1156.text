Dear Mr. Chen,
Thank you very much for your message. I apologize for my
procrastination since making the first draft due to the tight schedule
here at work.
If you don't mind waiting a bit longer, I'll include the helpful
corrections and suggestions from Markus, Bruno, WU Jian and others, and
make up another draft for the GB18030 and GBK applications tonight or
tomorrow morning, and then you can make the further revisions. :-)
You may wish to look at
ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2978.txt
or
for the procedures in registration. Also, a listing of currently
registered charsets:
and http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/ietf-charsets/ for archives
of this mailing list (including previous discussions with GB18030
registrations.)
Best regards,

Dear Anthony,
Thank you very much for drafting application. Please note that the GBK was
released in 1995.
Mr. Xu Cheng told me that you would help us register GB18030 in IANA. If it
is, please give me some instructions on registration process. I work for the
Chinese IT Standardization Technical Committee.
Best regards,
