Hi,
I requested for some files but they have an extension of .001. How do I
open them?
e,g, bible10_zip.001
Regards
Dilip
Dear,
First you have make sure that you have all the parts of the files.
(001, 002, ...)
Next you save them.
Then you copy all of them into one big file
For UNIX, you use cat bible10_zip.*  bible10.zip
For MSDOS &amp; Windows, use copy/b bible10_zip.001+bible10_zip.002+(list a
ll
other parts here) bible10.zip
Now you can use your favourite unzipping utility (pkunzip, unzip or
winzip) to open the one big bible10.zip
Happy reading.
I have aproblem.
I down loaded yahoo messenger, and when the down loaded was finished, I lost my
addresses and bookmarks, because
I was not thinking that I would lose my email address when I filled out the for
m, for another email address.
My old email address is mailto:james_b33069@yahoo.com and my new email address
is, james_bishopsr@yahoo.com.
Is there some way that I can retrieve my old email address?
Thanks,
Jimmy
