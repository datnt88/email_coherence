I agree on the odd typography - the twirls on the image captions are a
little distracting (on words like system and selection). The images could be
a bit more clear - especially those containing close to unreadable text in
pop-ups.
I don't find the US-centrism that much of a problem (as opposed to
"Accessible Web Sites" from glasshaus which has three chapters devoted to US
legislation) - in Joe Clark's book it is one appendix. Its quite easy to
draw the right parallels. For a UK perspective, I find Australian practice
setting a good precedent. I, however, doubt that the information contained
in the book is any less relevant because of its US bias - unless disabled
people in the US are different from those in the UK?
Accessibility is accessibility no matter what the country nor legislation.
And as Joe points out on the back-cover "If fear of lawsuits, government
mandates, and human-rights complaints is driving you to make your Website
more accessible, you're doing the right thing for the wrong reason."
I found Joe's book a good balance in my understanding - its corrected a few
perceptions I had (accessible websites would mean working on a mobile
phone). Perhaps its because I already have a working knowledge of
accessibility made it easier for me to take in the new info?
Overall I'm finding Joe's book a worthwhile read. Although keeping up on UK
legislation I have to do on my own, that's more my fault than Joe's.
The reviewer complains about Joe's "opinionated" views - how is that
different from experience?
*aside* The quote "Standards compliance is a form of programming maturity"
is a good one, but I hesitate to use it because of the word "programming"
and its implication of website creation as programming -- but that's just my
paranoia.

The website only lets you read one article per day -- no doubt you read the
one about semantics first.
PCPro is the _first_ site I've had to block out all the flickering gifs with
post-it notes before I could actually read the content. How absolutely
annoying.
Mike.
BTW, it would have been nice to have received an actual E-mail about
this thread. You know, I'm *on* this list, not merely present by
name in subject lines.
I assume you refer to the ct and st ligatures. You don't have to
like them, of course.
We did what we could with the somewhat ridiculous constraint that
*we couldn't print in colour*. TIFF screenshots are intrinsically
low-resolution (72 dpi, nominally) and actually look *better*
reduced in size. Believe me, we spent actual days doing nothing but
manipulating and optimizing screenshots. Days and days and days. We
removed individual pixels in more than one case.
In examples where reading the onscreen text was absolutely
necessary, we used callouts and bigger magnification sizes,
actually.
I agree to some extent with the criticism, but what you see in the
book is the best we could do under our constraints, one more of
which was we were unable to include the graphics on the CD-ROM,
which might have obviated certain problems.
Probably because there isn't any. U.S. coverage was included where
necessary, but a great deal of foreign information was included.
Anybody bother to check all the screenshots in Italian, Portuguese,
Finnish, and so on? In fact, the *lack* of emphasis on the U.S. was
remarked upon by my publisher, but I stayed the course.
Check the CD-ROM for Martin Sloan's article on the subject. It was
too lengthy to include in the main text. But you see, I didn't
overlook the U.K.
Possibly a fair point, though admittedly rather minor, but I've
found that critics of my book have quasi-Aspergerian capacities to
expand inconsequential issues into blanket condemnations. It's a
feature I recognize in myself, of course.

Joe,
I would have included you in the original post, but I've had quite a
few e-mails to you bounced in the past, and figured you'd read the
header if not the body...
Jonathan
let me get something straight.
Is this list about:
Accessibility?
Mocking people who promote accessibility?
Anti Joe Clarke?
What a dumb thread this has really been.

If the impression of my post is that I am mocking Joe Clark, then I submit
my most humble apologies.
Joe Clark's book is an excellent and refreshing piece on accessibility. It
is a book I heartily recommend to anyone doing webdesign that is interested
in creating cutting edge accessible websites - heck anyone doing web
development should read this book. Even people who "get" accessibility that
suffer from others mis-labelling them as "academics" (that would be me).
There are a few minor glitches with the book, but none of it detracts from
the quality of Joe's work. And these are the only things picked up by the
original PCPro review.
Let me just be clear: I am a fan of this book, and Joe Clark has my utmost
respect.
Mike
Two More Cents worth...
Joe Clark is generally on the money regarding accessibility. His
opinionated writing style can be abrasive and occasionally borders on
vitriol, which bothers some (including myself) who live by the old saw my
grandmother taught me "... you catch more flies with sugar than you do with
salt...". That said, I cannot question his experience or knowledge of the
subject matter, although I occasionally hold differing opinions than he.
Another emerging point is that the PCPro web site is a stellar example of an
inaccessible commercial web site - and while regular readers of this List
really don't need to be shown how bad it can get out there, we occasionally
feel the need to remind each other... perhaps not that useful, but it *is*
frustrating when it concerns an on-line article abut web accessibility.
But dumb Tim? I don't think so...
JF
I accept your point
and in my doing so, this dumb thread just got longer and dumber ....
JOKE!!!!
