One of my colleagues, Okabe-san, translated the FAQ 1.0.

Thanks once again for the wonderful work your group is performing with
these translations! I am installing links to the translations from
the W3C XML page as each one becomes available.

I must apologise for being late with the revised FAQ, publisher
pressure intervened, so I am 600 messages behind with the list.
I'm hoping for later this week, but in the meantime I'm open to
pointers as to what has changed. White-space is the most radical;
and did we decide to keep PEs in XML DTDs or not?
