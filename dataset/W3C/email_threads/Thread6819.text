Hello all-- I've now made public the latest version of the XML
specification DTD:
DTD:http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/06/xmlspec-
19980910.dtd
Documentation:http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/06/xmlspec-
report-19980910.htm
Hi Eve,
I notice that the XML spec doesn't currently match up to this DTD. There are a few small things that need to be done to make it match:
1) add the attribute "align" to table: the html-tbl.mod file originally used had
align (left|center|right) "left"
2) add the attribute "bgcolor" to td: the html-tbl.mod file originally
had
bgcolor CDATA #IMPLIED
3) The XML spec uses xml:link, whereas the newer DTD uses
xlink:form. I guess this problem is going to keep on happening; I'd
personally rather keep the xml:link form until the XLink WG has
figured out what they're doing. But I don't feel all that strongly
about it.
4) The abstract and status seem to switch positions depending on
the WG. The DTD just needs to have
((status, abstract)|(abstract,status))
instead of
status,abstract
in the content model of header.mdl
cheers,
Lauren
Yep, I'm aware that the XML V1.0 specification is out of sync with the
progression of the DTD. There are actually a few more differences that
I've noted, too. The variability of the status and abstract positioning is
new to me, but I can add that.
I've committed to producing a version of the DTD that works with the
original spec for people's convenience, though I've cleverly avoided
committing to a specific date... :-) I hope it will be soon; thanks for
the reminder and the design notes.
Eve
