My proposal for the re-organization and re-prioritization of this
Guideline is as follows:
1. take existing Checkpoint 2.7.2, renumber it Checkpoint 2.7.1, and make P1
2. take existing Checkpoint 2.7.3, renumber it Checkpoint 2.7.2, and keep P1
3. take existing Checkpoint 2.7.1, renumber it Checkpoint 2.7.3, and make P2
4. retain Checkpoint 2.7.4 as is
Why? Simply because the current 2.7.2 is the crux of the entire effort...
If we are going to integrate accessibility features and practices into the
overall look-and-feel of the tool, then we cannot, as GL 2.7 currently
does, encourage authoring tool developers and manufacturers to simply
provide documentation on the quote accessible authoring practices
supported by the authoring tool unquote in one discrete location and hope
that a) users of the tool read the help topic on accessibility, and b)
that the developers will also quote integrate accessible authoring
practices in all applicable help topics unquote. What is needed is a
clear statement that whenever an authoring practice/method is discussed,
any and all applicable accessible authoring practices pertaining to that
authoring practice/method _MUST_ also be discussed. Hence the P1
associated with my re-numbered 2.7.1 (the current 2.7.2) Anything less
would be tantamount to sweeping accessibility features/practices under the
rug, which runs counter to the AU WG's mission. If the goal is to
incorporate accessible authoring practices/methods into the tool (as well
as to make accessible authoring second nature to the user of the tool),
then the current 2.7.2 is unequivocably a P1, and should be made the most
visible checkpoint in GL 2.7 by re-numbering it as 2.7.1 and according it
a P1.

I think the checkpoints will be shuffled around again sometime
in the future based on priority, as it is. I agree with your
assessment of (existing) 2.7.2 as "vitally important" but it does
not rise to the level of a priority one as defined by the current
priority listing, in my opinion.
This is an example of why I think we need to re-write our priority
definitions so that we can give P1 to our biggest and best stuff,
which we currently can't do.
What do you think of my proposal for new priority defs?

Some of what we require is already done by checkpoint 2.4.2 - Make generation
of accesible content a naturally integrated part of the authoring process,
which is P1 already.

I think we've already agreed that 2.4 and 2.7 are separate as one
regards documentation/help/instructions and the other is more
procedural.
Right?

aloha, charles!
to which Gregory responds:
true, enough, but as was debated at the cambridge face2face meetings (i
believe) when it was proposed that portions of 2.7 be rolled into 2.4,
this is important enough an issue to address in a discrete guideline...
the point is that while, yes, it is definitely a P1 to quote make
generation of accessible content a naturally integrated part of the
authoring process unquote, it is also necessary to make accessible content
a naturally integrated part of the help system... the difference here is
that guideline 2.4 is concerned with getting the authoring tool to present
the user with the accessible solution first and as the default, whereas
2.7 is concerned with the documentation of accessible authoring practices,
and the natural integration of accessible markup into each and every
applicable example of implementation methods (i.e. choosing style sheets to
change font size and color) and in every example of code (the sample
markup for a form, for example, should include fieldset, legend, label,
accesskey, and tabindex, etc.)
yes, 2.4 and 2.7 are inter-related, but they are 2 methods of achieving a
common goal: the production of authoring tools that not only output
accessible content and which are themselves accessible, but which also
educate the user (or at least alert him or her) about accessibility
issues, thereby enabling them (that is, the authors themselves, rather
than the tool exclusively) to make educated decisions about the content
and (equally important in my mind) structure of the pages they produce...
what a specific guideline on help/documentation does, therefore, is to
assist in the production not only of more accessible (and more structured)
content, but in the production of more enlightened authors, as well... if
accessibility isn't addressed in each and every applicable instance in the
help files and documentation that accompanies the tool, the implicit
message is: accessibility is a quote worthwhile unquote consideration,
and there exist methods of making ubiquitous mark-up accessible, but these
built-in features of the markup are not really as important as the rest of
the quote hardcore unquote markup and output with which ninety percent of
your users will interact...
how can we condone, let alone give our stamp of approval to, a tool which
shows how to construct a form or table _without_ including the
accessibility features associated with such elements as part-and-parcel of
what constitutes a form or a table? if we leave the current 2.7.1 as-is,
and the current 2.7.2 a p2, we doing just that...
therefore, i simply cannot see how one could possibly justify according
the current 2.7.1 priority 1 status, whilst according the current 2.7.2 a
priority 2

Not really, Gregory, because Charles is arguing that you only get
the stamp of approval if you do P1 _and_ P2 checkpoints.
Which, frankly, is confusing and bothersome to me, and I think that
Charles needs to propose merging P1 and P2 if that's what he really
wants done.
Which is as much a skewing of the multi-tiered priority system as
proposing only 2 priorities -- frankly, I think that may be a better
idea, or possibly requiring compliance with ALL priorities (P1, P2) and
offering lesser-ranked priorities (P3) as techniques under a more
broad "principle-based" checkpoint.
PRACTICAL EXAMPLE:
We have only one P3 currently in section 2. The rest all are P1
and P2 which Charles would like to see as mandatory, minimum
compliance items. Checkpoint 2.3.4 is the only "optional" P3 under
this scheme:
"Provide a mechanism to manage alternative content for
multimedia objects, which retains and offers for editing
pre-written or previously linked alternative content."
This could easily be a technique for 2.3.3 and/or 2.3.5, or a
more general P1/P2 checkpoint:
"Allow authors to easily manage alternative content"
With the technique being a specific example of how to implement
that.
Once you've dealt with 2.3.4, we don't _have_ P3s anymore, and
with P2s being the baseline for conformance, all checkpoints are
now equal.
Ta da, I have now proven that checkpoint priorities are
meaningless. :)

I am not convinced that we condone it. We say the following:
P1 items are basic requirements. If you don't do them, your tool cannot be
used by certain people, or your tool cannot be used to produce accessible web
content.
Which is a polite and technical way of saying we think your tool should not
be allowed out on its own.
and furthermore, if you do fulfil p1 requirements, but not P2 requirements,
there are significant barriers to poeple using your tool, or using it to make
accessible content, or both.
Which is to say that it is possible to use your tool to make the world
better, but I wouldn't recommend it.
And if you fulfil P1 and P2 but not P3 then people will be able to use your
tool, but you could make life better.
Which is to say that this is a pretty acceptable level - when your 2-person
open-source startup gets a tool to meet this standard it deserves to be taken
seriously.
And if you fulfil P3 then you actually have a good tool on your hands, which
we can heartily recommend to all and sundry as being superbly built to enable
accessibility.
This document is a technical activity, and we are obliged to look at the
world as it is. I would rather manufacturers fixed all the P1 problems than
fixed some of them and all the P2s. I would not personally be interested in
recommending a product that did not meet all P1 and P2 requirements except as
the best of a bad bunch, in which case a product which met all P1s would win
out over one which did not meet one or more of them, however many P2
requirements it met.
That's my 2 cents worth, if I can find someone who'll give me some pennies.
