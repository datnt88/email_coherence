Using the patch from Don Croyle I was able to build Amaya RPMs for
Linux on the i386, sparc and alpha platforms.
You can download the sources or binary RPMs from
ftp://rpmfind.net/pub/amaya/

Tried these on Intel, Alpha, and Sparc using RH5.1 + updates (Alpha) and RH 5.2
(Intel and Sparc). They work fine except for one problem - jpegs wouldn't
display. Amaya 1.x works fine on the same machines (and displays jpegs).
Anyone else have this problem?

RPM distributions are not managed by the Amaya team. I guess these
distributions don't
include the library libjpeg. Perhaps your current version of that library is
incompatible
with Amaya includes.
Our binary distribution for Linux uses a static library and should display
jpegs correctly.
Could you check that?

Irene.
