TABLE is probably the most misused element in the HTML spec.
Using tables to provide columns (for examples see Microsoft, W3C, News
services, or most other people who have spent a bit of money on web
design) causes significant problems for screen readers.

screen reader, read as though it were ordinary text, left to right all
the way across the page)

If you read that example all the way across, it sounds like a lot of
nonsense. It is in fact two well formed paragraphs, and some short labels
on the side. Many Screen readers do exactly the same with text in columns.
The amount of effort required to put text in columns (or images with
appropriate ALT text) compared with a simpler more comprehensible layout
does not seem to justify erecting this particular accessibility barrier.
Add this to the fact that it is a blatant violation of the principles
explained in the HTML specification, that form and content ought to be

A proper use of TABLE is to present tabulated data, rather than relying
on PRE to do it. This means that it is possible to linearise the table,
and reformat the data without losing the meta-information provided by the
table structure. (It still causes problems for screen readers, but at
least there is something to say in its favour)
An improper use of tables, but one which, so far as I know has very
limited accessibility problems, would be to format material in such a way
that in each of two columns images were alternated with text. Then only
the ALT text of the image could give rise to a misunderstanding, a
situation which could be handled by an intelligent author.
A really stupid use of tables can be found on most commercial websites,
where they are used to cram so much information into the visible window
of a graphics browser that the site becomes very difficult to understand
for sighted people who have a high-quality connection and a good monitor.
While CSS is not implemented, using it to control presentation does not
cause major problems. Perhaps when it is implemented, and users have the
ability to over-ride a style sheet provided by an author which does not
suit their particular needs, the problem for screen readers will have
been effectively solved. Otherwise, the whole text in columns debate will
rise again. But there are two ways around it.
The first is to make use of frames. It is perfectly possible to produce a
site which is based on the use of frames, and which is accessible. It's
just that I am unaware of any such site currently in operation. (But then
most websites are inaccessible - it's not peculiar to frames.) It does
take a small amount of extra work, but bad design is generally not harder
than good design, it just requires thinking along different principles.
The second way is to ensure that there is a non-columnar version of
everything in columns, and that it is clear from the start of the
columnar data where to find it. This can take a considerable amount of work.
The alternative is to abandon the wholesale misuse of tables. My Doctor
tells me not to smoke or live on a diet of beer, fish and chips and
steak. My mechanic tells me not to drive my car as fast as it goes all
the time. My accountant tells me not to spend all my money on beer, fish
and chips, steak and car repairs.
As experts in their field, I listen to their advice. Otherwise I'd save
myself the money. If a doctor told me beer, tobacco and fat were going to
make me healthy, I would walk away very quickly. Why then, as experts
ourselves, are we so scared to tell people what we know?
Isn't the American government suing tobacco companies for withholding
information? Apart from the fact that our product doesn't kill many
people, what makes us better than those companies?
Ignorance could be used as an excuse, but the reason for fora like this
is to end our ignorance by sharing our knowledge. And to encourage others
to do the same.

Charles, et. al.
I also find tables to be most misunderstood. As a developer who has since
learned to work with lynx 2.8 and pwWebSpeak. I find they handle tables
well. The rules that apply to a screen reader do not apply with these
products. Next step is to tackle WinVision and JAWS. I saw WinVision
demo'd and believe it also handles tables properly (input?)
What is frustrating is that I like tables! But there are so many browsers
out there and each one handles information in its own way - even with
graphic browsers such as Microsoft and Netscape. With these I have learned
how to design for both, but am still learning on the text and voice
browsers and screen readers. Unfortunately I do not have all the tools at
my disposal. Unfortunately there is a cost factor.
The example that Charles uses is the example I always here about. But I
would like to know what tool or tools are used to produce these results.
As a developer, I have learned quite a bit and would like to be more
informed. Can you please tell me what tools can produce this result and
comment on the usage rate or popularity.
Is there a comprehensive list of all browser for ADA? I know browser watch
has a significant list, see
Also see http://www.dol.gov/dol/esa/public/programs/dbra/index.html here I
used tables for navigation but not like the normal design population. Also
see http://www.dol.gov they use tables for navigation like the rest of the
design population where the navigation buttons are on the side. Comments?
I am disparately trying to design for the lowest common denominator, but I
can only design for what information that I have read!
Appreciate the support and am interested in discussion.

Lynx (at leat our copy) handles tables, just not the same way a
graphical browser does. Lynx throws columns underneath each other
correct? This allows screen readers to keep the columnar confusion that
McCathieNevile described.
BTW, tables- although they were intended for support of columnar data,
were as page formatting kludges in one of the early Arena demos out of
CERN or an early W3C site correct?

On the other hand, I sometimes ignore my doctor, if the steak looks
really good, or if it's just more convenient to drive through
McDonald's on the way home (or less expensive).
I agree with you in principle -- and in fact, I've recently completely
eliminated tables from my personal web page. (See for example
However, I haven't taken this approach with the CGU site (where I'm
the webmaster), with my clients' sites, or with the HTML Writers
Guild site. Why? Simply because the method I used for getting rid
of tables -- reliance on stylesheets -- is not supported by all
browsers, and in fact, my web page looks like crap in Opera, which
happens to be my browser of choice.
I don't really care about my own "image" on the web; the funny purple
bar and ugly award graphic won't be winning any awards any time soon.
However, the other sites named -- CGU, HWG, and people who pay me to
make web sites for them -- _must_ present a good image. If I got
rid of the tables, then the pages would be more accessible to a
small number of people, but will look far worse for a larger group
of the audience.
As someone expected to maintain what is currently considered a
"professional" and "sophisticated" appearance for those web sites,
I just can't decide "well, this will only look good in MSIE 4 and
in lynx" and design that way. I would most likely lose my job,
lose my clients, and cost the Guild its reputation. Those are
not good things.
So for the time being, I'll continue to use tables for page
layout, even though I know it's not good for me -- just because
I don't really have much of a choice, at the present time. The
alternatives are simply not acceptable. (And my apologies to
those who can't access the information on the pages -- I try my
best to make sure the tables are relatively harmless and degrade
easily.)
In summary: We agree in principle, but in practice, I'm stuck
with the tables. Thanks for a good post, Charles.

This is strictly my opinion - or maybe it's a question:
Since HTML 3.2 there has been a good way to distinguish a columnar table
from a table of rows (by use of COL and COLGROUP). Maybe we should encourage
authors to employ this method and screen reader ISV's to use this method as
a way to resolve HTML tables. I have attached a quick-and-dirty example that
is based on these HTML 3.2 tags.

TD Row1, Col1
TD Row1, Col2

TD Row2, Col2
BY COLUMNS:

Thank you for your comments. I agree that tables were not orginally
intended for page layout, but they have been coopted for that purpose. I
don't think WAI should encourage the use of tables for layout, but I think
WAI should ignore the current practice in the use of tables for layout in
the development of guidelines.

I tend to agree with this view.
To me, the use of tables for layout is not going to go away in HTML;
therefore, a more profitable direction would be to fix the relatively few
number of screen readers, rather than the nigh-unto-infinite number of web
pages.
Thanks to Charles McCathieNevile for the excellent example of the problem
with how screen readers deal with HTML content. Why (he asked, getting
ready to duck) are screen readers so stupid? A table of contents in a
left-most table cell is tagged as an identifiable HTML block. Why haven't
any of the screen readers been written to deal with HTML blocks, instead of
just reading across and down?

If you're comfortable with what you're doing, you've been there before."
--Jerry Uelsmann
W3C folks,
From my perspective, the issue of table use is
three separate questions: What formats should be
supported in Mark Up Language (evolving specification);
How should information be coded into Web pages
given the current state of HTML; How should
browsers display information coded as a table.
The long-term solution requires us to be more
explicit about content versus format. That is, to
define the various structures (arrangements of
information) which will be supported, and to define
the coding of each one.
The goal should be a recognition that, despite
increasing bandwidth, there will always exits text-
only browsers, and despite higher density screens,
there will be a need for speech synthesis of the
display. Thus, design and evaluation should
involve Lynx-type browsers and speech synthesis of
visual browsers.
Three specific formats are now overloaded into the
Table Code: Tabular Data, (e.g. name and phone
number lists), best understood as rows of
information; columns, best understood as a linear
structure which wraps from lower left to upper
right; a Table-of-Contents block, best understood
as meta-information for the page.
My experience has been that Lynx does a reasonable
job at resolving all three forms by displaying the
contents of each cell on a row-by-row basis. This
works for tabular data, and is acceptable if the
column is a single row, and may work for a Table-
of-Contents block. The shortcomings of this
technique are not the result of Lynx restrictions,
but the incompleteness of the full Markup language
specification combined with the longstanding
tradition of not using the column / row
specification.
My recommendation is that we agree on a complete
list of display structures, (e.g. rows of
information, columns of text, etc.), generate a
sample set of these coded in current HTML
techniques. We might try some Style Sheets that
support text only browsers, Style Sheets that
support visual browsers for low vision access,
Style Sheets that support visual browsers with
synthetic speech.
This effort may inform the specific needs of Web
designers, and also clarify the range of data
structures supported for all Internet users.
I have taken the liberty of expanding slightly the
example of David Bolnick.

JRG: Screen readers are designed to be a general purpose access to where
WWW browsing is only one of several tpes of software. Some browsers are
getting smarter. Henter-Joyce JAWS program manipulates the DOM of explorer

that the rendering of the document could take into account the intedned use
of the table.
