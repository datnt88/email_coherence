I've added a attrcreatetextnode3 and 4 that should come closer to the stated
intent of the the test and modified the descriptions for attrcreatetextnode
and attrcreatetextnode2.
exercise the test
I went back and checked earlier sources and that seems to have been
brought
over from the original NIST tests. Definitely the actual test doesn't
exercise the intent, not only is the semi-colon missing but it uses a %
instead of a &amp;.
I think the right thing to do is to change the description and admit that
the test isn't doing what it should be doing and to add additional tests
that might actually trigger the potentially flawed behavior.
Was there a reason this message was sent off-list? Could you resent this
or
the original message to the mailing list to get it in the official record?

Subject: Testcase attrcreatetextnode2.xml in level1/core does not exercise
the test
Please review
tnode2.xml?annotate=1.2
Line 22 states the intention of the test:
22: child of of the fourth employee and assign the "Y%ent1;"
Line 44 sets the value as follows (note missing ";"):
44: nodeValue obj="streetAttr" value='"Y%ent1"'/
Since no entity is set, the test case does not test what it is intended
to.
The same bug (test does not exercise what is intended) is apparently
also
true with attrcreatetextnode:
tnode.xml?annotate=1.7
Same line numbers (22 vs. 44).

Not sure I understand why we have 4 tests -
Perhaps we should set the attribute to be something different
than what was originally in the file -- the use of %ent1 was
an error, but rather than using &amp;ent1;, which is what is in the
xml file already, we should set it to &amp;ent2; - then it may be less
confusing.
What's the purpose of the additional tests. Curt, did you create
attrcreatetextnode2, and forget to change the metadata info? I
don't think that is a test that we created. Could you please explain
the differences and the additional need for attrcreatetextnode2, 3, &amp; 4?
I would think in general if a test has a bug, we should agree on a
fix and fix the original test rather than creating additional tests. Is
there something more going on here than is stated in the description.
It does appear that you are trying to do something with nodevalue as
well -- could you provide a little more detail?

From the description of the test, the original author were trying to find a
processor that would set an attribute to "Yes" by mistakening expanding an
reference to the ent1 entity on a call to setNodeValue or equivalent.
However, they used "Y%ent1" instead of "Y&amp;ent1;".
The tests were not bad tests, they were just weak tests. However, after a
test is released, there should be not substantive change to the body of the
test. In this case, since the existing tests weren't bad, they did not need
to be removed from the suite. However, to actually test what they had
intended to test required adding new tests.
p.s. I did check the log and it appears that attrcreatetextnode2 was a
variation of attrcreatetextnode that I made to provide coverage for
Attr.setNodeValue about 6 months ago (the original test uses Attr.setValue),
but I did not change the contributor and date from the original. I've
changed the metadata on the CVS version. The original bug reports addressed
weaknesses that existed in both attrcreatetextnode and attrcreatetextnode2.
Hmmm -- not I'm even more confused. When I looked at
the original test, I thought that the expected result was
supposed to be "Y&amp;ent1;", not the expanded version. I
don't have the spec in front of me at the moment, but I
believe both it and the comment against it were that the
expected result should not expand the entity, rather be
the text itself. Thus, there was a problem with the test,
setting the result to "Y%ent1" instead of "Y&amp;ent1;". At
that point, I would have changed the test to simply use
"Y&amp;ent1;" instead. After further consideration, it might
be better to change it to be some other entity, maybe
"Y&amp;ent2;", since that particular attribute is already set
to "Y&amp;ent1;" in the staff.xml file -- it's difficult to determine
that the setValue actually did anything otherwise.

There appears to have been a 24 hour delay in messages getting relayed. It is not just you.
The conformant value is "Y&amp;ent1;" or "Y%ent1" depending on the test. The test was intended to expose a potential flaw where the parameter was processed through an entity expansion step. If that flaw existed then "Y&amp;ent1;" would be incorrectly expanded to "Yes", however "Y%ent1" would either not be recognized as anything special or even more unlikely as a incomplete parameter entity reference. If such a flaw existed, "Y&amp;ent1;" is much more likely to expose it than "Y%ent1".
I believe the use of the same fragment "Y&amp;ent1;" in staff.xml and in the test was intentional, that the test author wanted to do something with a DOM method that looked very much like content in the XML document, but had different results due to the entity expansion step in parsing the XML document and the lack of an entity expansion step in processing values set by DOM methods.
I don't think there is any difficulty distinguishing between the initial state and a conformant state. After the setValue call, the attribute would have a value that would have required the XML document to have contained "Y&amp;amp;ent1;".
I'm pretty sure that attrcreatetextnode3 does what the author of attrcreatetextnode was wanting to do but didn't quite accomplish.

[mb] I disagree -- it was simply a mistake in invoking the entity. These tests were originally authored here at NIST, so I'm privy to what the
author intended. This one was written early on and has simply been translated into java and then DOM TSML with the error. The intent of
the test was to set it to "Y&amp;ent1;" and it was simply an error. I don't see the need for four tests (and find having four of them rather
confusing), and don't believe that having a test that sets the value to a flawed parameter entity reference is particularly useful. Overall,
the goal here is to have a good set of conformance tests. I don't see problems in modifying flawed tests to do what they should do rather
than creating additional tests. Just simply make the corrections, and update the metadata. The cvs log will annotate differences and
allow one to see the progression of the tests. Additional tests should only be created if something else needs to be tested.
