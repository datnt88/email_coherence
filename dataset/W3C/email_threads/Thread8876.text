I'm working to publish a new Candidate REC next week, and then if we haven't
introduced too many more bugs, we can advance the document in May. We may or
may not be able to resolve the xmldsig#md5 and XSLT!=string issue by next
week, but I don't think they are critical path for an update to the spec
(they are straightforward choices regardless.)
Some things to note is that will be using the latest version of schema [2]
(hopefully I haven't introduced any bugs into the definitions and the one
example), and we now have a section on CryptoBinary [3] for which the bignum
text applies to (generalized to all CryptoBinary).
John, there's still some text in there that reads:
Note: The function definition for here() is intended to be consistent with
its definition in XPointer. However, some minor differences are presently
being discussed between the Working Groups.
Can this be deleted now?

Hi Joseph,
Regarding the here() function, the XPointer WG some time ago agreed to
having essentially the same definition as ours, and their last call
working draft reflects this decision.
So, I'd say it is safe to take out the 'Note' in our document, though
hopefully this feature will not change after last call-- as was the case
with entity markers in InfoSet.

Oh, two other things to note, in the first CR we asked for feedback on the
use of XPath terminology, and whether minC14N should be downgraded to
optional. We didn't have any feedback on either, so I expect we should leave
them as is.

In order to go to Draft Standard, the IETF requires there be two
indepenent interoperable implementations of each significant
option/feature. As far as I can tell, there are none for Minimal
Canonicalization. Unless a couple pop up in the next few days, say by
next Tuesday, I suggest that it be dropped from the specification.
Thanks,
Donald

Hi Donald,
What guidelines are used to measure significance? Current
interop examples exercise KeyValue and X509Data, but none
of the other key info types. Is that important? It seems
that RetrievalMethod is possibly the most complex of them;
does it rise above insignificance?
On the m5l C14N front, the algorithm seems relatively
unpopular with current implementers. I know that we will
not be implementing it in the near future, so will not be
able to participate in any necessary interop.

I'm not 100% sure but I can seek guidance if necessary. I don't
currently believe it would include such things as syntactic hooks for
user defined algorithms. However, I think you may have a good point
on RetrievalMethod. Given that it's implementation is a SHOULD, it
seems like ti ought to be in the interoperability matrix...
Thanks,
