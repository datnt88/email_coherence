Hi,
The Markup (ex-HTML) validator team is starting today a public beta
test of the service :
This may be of interest for the ER Group, since this version allows
output in EARL, e.g:

Can people take a look at that please? It's taking a slightly different
approach to Page Valet, and I'm contemplating bringing Valet into line
with this.
It asserts that a page passes or fails validation - no problem there
(so long as we accept no-reification).
In the case of a fail, it adds a set of further assertions for each
validation error. These use rdf:about to identify the page, and
identify subject as the offsets within the page[1]. They also use
validation error messages as EARL testcases. I like it, but I wonder
if it might be too much of an "interesting" approach.
[1] I note a bug in the "offset" field; will try &amp; fix that ASAP.

On further examination, this use of rdf:about appears to collapse the
report on its test subject in the RDF validator report, and the triples
have lost the association between the errors and their locations.
Looks like my fault, and I'll submit a new patch.
