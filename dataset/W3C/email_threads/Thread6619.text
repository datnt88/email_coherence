I know that lynx is an ancient way to view Web site text,
but I'm surprised that I can't seem to access your updated
site using lynx. I get a status bar message saying:
I check my Web sites for lynx compatibility because a
blind friend once told me he used a reader based on
lynx to access Web sites.

Hi Laurie,
I also use Lynx at times. I am running version
2.8.4rel.1 (17 Jul 2001), and I can view the home page.

Weird - because this is the only time I've gotten this
message with lynx. I'm running 2.8.3 (but I have no
control over the version being run by my ISP).
I also tried another page at W3C and got the same
message.
