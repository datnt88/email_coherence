I'm using the 5.1 release under linux (binary tarZ) and I try to spell check
a document and when I hit Search/Skip in the dialog box, it immediately
returns "Not found." I have spell, ispell, and iamerican installed, and the
language preference Amaya insists on is en_US.
Unix versions of Amaya don't install dictionaries automatically. You have to
download and install them as explained in our Web page
(see the section "Installing dictionaries").
Ah, my bad.
