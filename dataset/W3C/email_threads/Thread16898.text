RE: testing aural style sheet properties
Does anyone know of a speech reading (TTS) browser that supports CSS2's aural properties, (ideally free to download, and Windows 98 compatible on a PC platform)?
many thanks.

I don't think one exists. It would be of very little use in the real world.
There are two purposes for AT:
1) to allow the user to access real world web sites, which are never
authored for aural style sheets;
2) to allow their employers to meet disability employment legislation
with as little change to their intranet as possible.
Particularly in meeting (1) the only practical solution is to use
the market leader browser to do most of the work.
I think this is basically untrue.
There is a browser that has a partial implementation - emacspeak. It is free,
but runs on Unix systems - I don't know if it is available for Windows (the
speech drivers for Windows-based free speech synthesisers are probably the
real problem). And there are a few bugs in it.
But unlike what Dave says, it is useful to have a browser that does this
because emacspeak allows the user to apply their own style sheets (in CSS or
XSLT). I have only asked one regular user of emacspeak, and he is happy to
continue with the built in default user style sheet in most cases (he
specialises it for a few things that he does a lot).
