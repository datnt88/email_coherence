Guys, in case you plan to review the appendix in the LC version of
the semantics document, I ought to tell you that I was mortified to
found a huge bug in the proofs of the RDF and RDFS entailment lemmas
just hours before the publication deadline, and had to do some very
hasty repair work, so the proofs in the published version are
extremely ugly and seriously incomplete. Frankly, the RDFS lemma
proof is not worth the bother of trying to review - it is a
placeholder - so please feel free to ignore them other than to say
they are trash. I am writing up a better version which I will send
you as soon as it is ready, early next week. That will, I hope,
include a version of the RDFS consistency lemma which Peter has
suggested.

PS. You may notice that I have restored a condition on IP in Herbrand
interpretations which you suggested earlier that I remove. I had
forgotten that this condition, although inelegant, is necessary in
order to handle the case of the RDF lemma when the graph contains a
triple
aaa type Property .
but aaa is not used as a property. In this case, with the 'standard'
definition of IP in a Herbrand interpretation being just the set of
property URIrefs, the construction used in the RDF lemma fails, since
the RDF interpretation requires that IP be exactly the class
extension of rdf:Property. Adding these URIs to IP makes no extra
triples true, so does not affect the minimality of the Herbrand
interpretation, and is harmless for the other (elementary) Herbrand
results, so I have restored this condition. Just to let you know that
I didn't do so carelessly or on a whim.
The basic reason for this being necessary is that RDF allows
properties to exist which have an empty extension, by the way.

Consider the RDF graph
ex:foo rdf:type rdf:Property .
The Herbrand interpretation, H, for this is then
IRH = { ex:foo, rdf:Property } u LVH
IPH = { ex:foo, rdf:type }
IEXTH(rdf:type) = { ex:foo,rdf:Property }
IEXTH{x) = {} otherwise
ISH = id
ILH = id
LVH = strings u pairs
What I would consider to be the minimal interpretation, M, is
IRM = { ex:foo, rdf:Property } u LVM
IPM = { rdf:type }
IEXTM(rdf:type) = { ex:foo,rdf:Property }
IEXTM{x) = {} otherwise
ISM = id
ILM = id
LVM = strings u pairs
I do not believe that H   M.
Ignoring strings and pairs (where the mapping is identity) the projection
mapping is going to have to look like
k(rdf:Property) = rdf:Propertybecause ex:foo is the only object
k(rdf:type)= rdf:typebecause rdf:type is the only predicate
k(ex:foo)= ex:foobecause ex:foo is the only subject
but then ex:foo is in IPH and k(ex:foo) is not in IPM.
By the way, the IL mapping of typed literals in Herbrand interpretations is
broken. It is defined to be the identity mapping but LV only contains
string, pairs of strings and language tags, and well-formed XML literals in
G. What then is IL("foo"^ex:bar)?

I do not believe that this is harmless for the Herbrand lemma,
in particular the only if side:
If I satisfies G then H(G)   I
In order to prove this only if statement, some mapping
A : blank(G) - IRI
is chosen such that I+A satisfies G.
Then, k : IRH u IPH - IRI u IPI is defined to be the
restriction of I+A to IRH u IPH.
For a URI v such that
v type Property
is in G but with v not being the property of a triple in G,
the proof that k(v) is in IPI seems to need the first condition
on RDF interpretations.
However, I is an arbitrary simple interpretation.

I have not received any response to this comment on the change to Herbrand
interpretations. (This change may have been rescinded but I would like
some indication thereof.)

Sorry.
The change has indeed been rescinded
; but more importantly, the subinterpretation
relationship   is no longer used in the proof
and is not defined anywhere, so this issue is no
longer germane to any of the lemmas. The previous
exposition has been simplified into a single proof
using the Herbrand construction to prove the
interpolation lemma directly. This contracts what
was three lemmas (one of which was so trivial
that you considered it to be circular) into a
single argument and removes the need for the
construction and the explicit notion of
minimality.
The longer proofs of the entailment lemmas are
then modelled on this construction and argument,
with suitable modifications and notational
extensions (mostly needed to handle literals.)
