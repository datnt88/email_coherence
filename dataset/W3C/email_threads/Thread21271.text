Apologies for asking such a simple question but can anyone give *any*
annotea example url (or files), formal or not (pretty please :-)

If you are looking for RDF that encapsulates an annotation, see:
If you don't have an account, see:
Art, I've been working on a bit of Perl that converts between the 'Squish'
RDF query language (see http://swordfish.rdfweb.org/rdfquery/) and Algy,
the language used in Annotea. Would it be possible to have some of the
Annotea data exposed on non-passworded URLs so we can point other RDF
query apps at it? I'm thinking it would be good to show two different
query systems working with the same data...

There are some examples in Appendix A of our WWW10 paper:
yes, that gives Eric Prud'hommeaux's interactive interface
for querying our RDF database., If you scroll to the bottom
of the form and enter, e.g. "http://www.w3.org/" in the
"uris to check for annotations" field and select the
"query RDF DB" button you will see the then-current list
of annotations of the W3C home page known to annotest.w3.org.
So, for example, I see right now the annotation
which, if you request with accept: text/html you'll see quoted and
wrapped in some HTML markup but if you request with
accept: application/rdf or accept: application/xml you will
see in bare RDF/XML form.
sure. I just copied the annotation data named above into
