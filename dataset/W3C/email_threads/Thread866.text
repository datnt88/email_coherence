How do I get HTML Tidy to stop changing web addresses (URI/URL)?
Fix-URI does not work:
It is NEVER correct to change a web address. That's because a web site
designer can use any string of characters to express a method of
accessing a database, for example. I agree they shouldn't use weird
URIs, but they do, and Tidy ruins them, so that links become non-functional.
This was discussed before. It was apparently decided that there was no
problem:
SUBJECT: Re: question on fix-uri config option
I'm using the Windows HTML-Tidy binary:
TIDY.EXE 175,616 11/29/02 2:51:00 pm
Certain characters have to be encoded within HTML, and that's what
Tidy is doing for you. They do not become non-functional (assuming
they were valid in the first place), because the encoding is
reversible and is reversed by the browser.
Please send sample code, config options and detailed information on what
version of HTML Tidy you use (e.g., where did you get it from, what does
`tidy -v` tell you). I am not able to reproduce any problem with that
function. --fix-uri enables you to control how Tidy deals with invalid
characters in URIs, e.g.
is such a invalid URI reference, with enabled --fix-uri Tidy will change
it to
There is another option --fix-backslash that turns invalid references
like
into
A third config option --quote-ampersand specifies how Tidy deals with
invalid entity references in the document, e.g.
will be cleaned up to
if the option is set to a true value. By default, all these options are
enabled, and that's necessary in order get a valid document.
Tidy does not change URIs, it turns invalid URIs or invalid
representations of URIs into valid ones, and it does so in a way
consistent with the HTML 4.01 Recommendation.
Sure, but that individual must properly escape this string in order to
get a valid (HTML representation of a valid) URI reference. Tidy will
not change the document, if it does not encounter any problems.
