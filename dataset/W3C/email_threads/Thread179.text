Given the input file:
!DOCTYPE doc [
]
and options of:
input-xml: yes
output-xml: yes
indent: no
new-inline-tags: em
new-blocklevel-tags: doc, para
new-empty-tags: foo
add-xml-pi: yes
I get:
!DOCTYPE doc [
!ELEMENT doc (para|foo)*
]
Now
is
the time.
I hadn't played with xml input before, so I was kind of surprised to see this.
It appears to be "eating" the internal subset, "indent" appears to be ignored,
as do the new-*-tags options. ?

Tidy doesn't yet support DTD subsets:
Support for XML
XML processors compliant with W3C's XML 1.0 recommendation
are very picky about which files they will accept. Tidy can
help you to fix errors that cause your XML files to be
rejected. Tidy doesn't yet recognize all XML features
though, e.g. it doesn't yet understand CDATA sections or DTD
subsets.
It seems like the time is ripe to add this. I will look into adding
support for CDATA marked sections as well as DTD subsets. Other
things to tackle include generalizing to Unicode tag names etc.

One implementation option might be to use the C DOM header I wrote,
at http://www.ascc.net/~ricko/src/dom_interface.h
It doesn't implement the HTML part of DOM, however tidy at the moment
just uses generic XML document objects, so no loss.
But it is probably overkill for tidy.
