I'm having problems with several tests that
use firstChild. The tests are schema valid and
no errors are thrown during transformation to java.
When I compile the generated code I get errors.
I've attached the xml file and the generated java code
from one of the tests. All of the tests that use firstChild
have compilation errors.

My guess is a problem with the definition of firstChild in dom2-interfaces.xml (built from the DOM 2 sources). I can't troubleshoot this till late tonight. You might compare the entry for firstChild
in dom2-interfaces.xml with that in dom1-interfaces.xml.
Looks like it is trying to find the function definition and just comes up blank.
I wouldn't let this stop you from committing the tests (actually, it should encourage you to commit the tests so we can work out any interactions between the tests and the transforms).
