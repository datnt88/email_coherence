Using the latest tidy (on linux(RH), the one of 15 march) ...
HTML Tidy for Linux/x86 (vers 1st March 2002; built on Mar 15 2002, at 23:33:08)
Parsing "new.htm"
line 4 column 1 - Warning: table lacks "summary" attribute
line 12 column 20 - Error: p missing ' ' for end of tag
When we look at the text in question, we find
In SGML, processing instructions begin with ' ?' and end with ' '.
In XML, processing instructions begin with ' ?' and end with '? '.
If the input is supposed to be XML, then Tidy would necessarily have
swallowed the rest of the input at this point looking for the closing
'? '. Does Tidy need a flag to treat '/ ' as if it were '? ' ?
I note that this is NOT how you declare XML namespaces.
In XML, you can't have a name space prefix without saying what URI
the prefix represents. If the whole thing is a single DIV, you'd
have
or whatever the URI was.
I was able to reproduce your problem on my platform with the current
version of Tidy. It appears to be recursing infinitely until it consumes
all available memory. Richard quite correctly isolated the piece of HTML
that is causing the problem. The 04 Aug 00 version of Tidy doesn't have
this problem.
It is recommended that you enter a formal bug report into the Tidy
project's bug tracker on SourceForge.

Hmm lets try..
Actually would never figure out that by using older tidy version will get me
less problems (it hapens very seldom)
Well the input is not XML.. its just the code (XML look like) that produces
Word (actually every new MS product) by copying some data to clipboard..
But the idea isnt bad.. Maybe I should check the configuration closer about
the ending tags (if there were such)..
