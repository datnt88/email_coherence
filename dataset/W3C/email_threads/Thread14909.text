Not quite ready to start a guidelines for scripts thread, however...
Is it right that tabbing does not enable srcelement/target to raise the
correct data?
If so doesn't this directly conflict with device independence guidelines.
If I've just goofed, could someone provide a url.
thanks

Can you send the script where you're seeing this behavior? I'll see if
can repro it.

There are 2 issues:
I've created one URI:
onmousewheel and srcElement snippet
You need IE6(javascript enabled) and a mousewheel.
This snippet uses the onmousewheel event to expand or contract the picture
below.
Move the cursor over the picture and roll the mouse wheel up and down.
Move the mouse off the image.
Now try tabbing to the image, click the alert, or keypad 'enter' and try to
zoom using the wheel.
2 problems:
- no ID
- no mousewheel
thanks again

ps: Part of the problem is to find a way to tab to an image that doesn't
have an href (any ideas)?

Try the attached html file (sorry for the attachment, I don't have
access to an external server to post it on right now)
I removed the a href and added a tabindex to the img element. You
had focus on the a element, not the img . Since the id and the
onmousewheel script were both on the img instead of the a , you
weren't able to get to them from the a .
You can use tabindex on most tags to add them to the tab order. Here's
a reference to the use of tabindex in IE
