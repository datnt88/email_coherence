In the resolution of issues
the WG decided to allow rdf:li elements as typed nodes. This was at the time
an arbritary decision, made primarily to ensure that there was a definite answer.
There has been implementor feedback that this was not a good decision.
The WG will also be considering by Friday issue:
where it is proposed to disallow names from the RDF namespace in inappropriate
contexts, e.g. rdf:Description not be allowed on a property element.
I propose
o Use of rdf:li is an error
o
be deleted
o that the test cases for rdfms-rdf-names-use should illustrate this error.

Yes, I agree. This is a rather bizarre case.
(Would it be easiest on implementers to say that the effect of using rdf:li
as a typednode is undefined?)

I support zapping this - well I suggested it to Brian!
Graham Klyne said:
Since we previously said in earlier test cases that it was allowed, I
prefer to make the existing test case an error.rdf rather than delete
it from the list of approved tests.
This change shouldn't break earlier code since rdf:li as an element
name was not explicitly in the old grammar (except by matching the
old typedNode) and the feedback from the probably, only, implementors
who looked at the change is the reason we are junking it!

I'll be absolutely heart-broken to delete the ARP code that does this!!
