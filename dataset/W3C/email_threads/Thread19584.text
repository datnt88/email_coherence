Dear friends:
I am excited about the new Amaya 2.1 and am looking forward to using it.
However, I would rather wait till an rpm version is available,
especially for Red Hat 6.0. Any idea when an rpm of Amaya 2.1 will be
available?

We have a problem with the gcc optimizer on Red Hat 6.0.
We hope to find out a solution soon.

Source RPM for those of us running RH 5.x would be nice too. I hope
to build it on my Alphastation (where Redhat 6.0 is far too unstable
for my tastes).
