Hi all
We have some effort in SWAD-Europe [1] to write a document about RDF
query [see [2]]. Part of this will be FAQ-based - a start is here [3],
(and I'd be grateful for any FAQs or answers).
The main reason for sending this message it because I've chatted to a
few people who feel that a collection of RDF query testcases would be a
useful thing to have, and I can put some effort into this - maybe as a
minimum, finding out what's already available, and maybe look into some
ways of enabling one query language implementation to use another's
testcases.
So, would anyone out there like to share their test and their
experiences of writing them? I can infer that Jena and 4suite have
them; I think Mozilla has some too. I've got some here for Inkling:
Basically the test scripts read in
which specifies the RDF/XML file to pull in, the query to use and the
expected number of rows in the resulting table. So it's only a very
basic test of whether the query engine is functioning.
Any more? Any thoughts?
cheers,
Libby

Libby,
A possible additional [FA]Q?: Can I enumerate the contents of a container
using a query? A rdf:collection? (The current version of my query code
supports both. I find it very useful, especially the rdf:collection elements.)

The test cases for the RDQL in Jena are shipped with the standard Jena
distribution - you can pull them out of the CVS repository on SourceForge as
well.
The control (manifest) file is not RDF - but it could be. Tests take the
form
(query, data, expected result set) and there is code that tests the expected
result set is equivalent (same values for variables, subject to bNode-isms,
number or rows etc) to the actual results obtained. I don't test failure
cases (i.e. that queries that are wrong fail in the expectedly wrong way).
For the FAQ: Alberto has gone a great job with:

same here - we got some simple RDQL regression tests distributed with
rdfstore and you can have a look to them on the CVS rep at sourceforge.
we are not going that far at the moment just having some test data,
queries and some expected num of results; everything is in perl code at
the moment but it would be great to have some good ones expressed in
some RDF, like Libby/Dan ones and jena.
I was proposing to Libby eventually the possibility to add links on
that page to actually add test data to specific use-cases or examples
together with some test results i.e. link up the tests to the query
language example to the use-cases.
is there an RDF Schema for Libby's tests-manifest somewhere? not that I
need one at the moment :-)
cheers

Hi Libby!
good question; it seems to us that a query is simply
a set of triples where bnodes play the role of variables
we then basically can apply a resolution process
The resolution process starts with a query. A query is a tripleset.
The query will be matched against the triplesets of the initial
graph G and against the rules. The set unifies with a rule when
one of the triples of the set unifies with the consequent of the
rule. The set unifies with another set if all triples in the set
unify with a triple of the other set. This can possibly be done
in different ways. The result of the unification of two triple
sets is a list of substitutionlists.
and this is work done by Guido Naudts in his master thesis
we also have some running code at http://www.agfa.com/w3c/euler/
and some testcases starting at http://www.agfa.com/w3c/euler/etc5
but there's still a lot to do...
