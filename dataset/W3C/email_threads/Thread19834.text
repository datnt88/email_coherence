I have detected two problems with amaya - V1.1c (under Digital Unix,
Linux and WIndows NT) :
1) the horizontal scroll-bar does not work. If the page contains an
image wider than the window, it is clipped and the scroll-bar does not
move to show the real size.
2) opening an URL like a href=Image.gif results in the binary contents
being displayed instead of the image. Including the image in an html
file with img src="Image.gif" works fine.

I have noticed a significant amount of refresh delay running under
Win95/NT. Generally, the screen will go blank for a few seconds while
scrolling as new positions are calculated. (I would assume) This occurs
more dramatically the faster the text is scrolled. (If things are
scrolled _really_ slowly, it is not too bad. Paging down causes it to
take a bit before displaying.
Are there any plans to speed this up? Or, am I the only one who has
experienced this?

Hi Daniel,
1. You can't use the horizontal scroll in amaya. This is a choice
it is not a bug.
2. At the present time, you can't open an image with amaya if it
is not referenced in a HTML file.
