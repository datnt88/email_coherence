Dear UAWG,
This is a proposal to fix a provision of checkpoint 2.2
(text view) in UAAG 1.0. Al, I'm addressing you explicitly
to ask whether the proposal is properly worded.
In the Candidate Recommendation, the checkpoint included:
"all SGML and XML applications, regardless of
Internet media type (e.g., HTML 4.01, XHTML 1.1, SMIL, SVG,
etc.)."
Some developers during CR indicated that without Internet media type
information, one cannot reliably sniff content to determine that a
piece of content is an instance of an XML application. So in the
last call draft, we deleted this provision.
Steven Pemberton's last call comments [1] include:
"I would beef up this definition to at least include XML."
We resolved for issue 548 [3] to include the media type
application/xhtml+xml in this checkpoint. But upon reflection,
I think that's the wrong solution.
I think that my proposal to delete the XML provision was the wrong
solution to the problem the developers raised in CR.
I now understand the ambiguity in the phrase "any XML application,
regardless of Internet media type". One could interpret this
to mean "the user agent has to figure out whether this is XML
content, whatever the media type." I think this ambiguity led
to the comments in CR; I have not confirmed with the reviewers.
I believe the intention of the second provision was to
provide a text view for content identified by media type as
XML and SGML content, even if UAAG 1.0 did not identify
all such media types (hence "regardless of media type").
I would like to reinstate a revised provision as a response
to Steven Pemberton's comments.
For the purposes of this checkpoint, a text format is either:
1) any media object given an Internet media type of
"text" (e.g., "text/plain", "text/html", or "text/*"),
as defined in RFC 2046 [RFC2046], section 4.1., or
2) any media object identified by Internet media type to
be an instance of an XML or SGML application.
Note: As an example, RFC 3023 [2] defines some Internet media
types for XML content.
I think this proposal:
a) Would satisfy Steven Pemberton's suggestion to "beef up" the
checkpoint.
b) Is in line with our original intent (pre-last call) to provide
a text view of XML content. We deleted that requirement thinking
it was technically unsound, but that discussion was based on
misunderstanding.
Thank you,
- Ian

Does this situation perhaps fit your concept of "normative inclusions"?
In other words, the proposal quoted below reads as though it defines what
is a text format for the purposes of this checkpoint, although it is probably
safer to say that these two conditions define normative inclusions. Any
media object satisfying either of these conditions MUST be treated as a text
object for the purposes of this checkpoint. But it is not true that all
media objects the User Agent SHOULD treat as a text media object meet these
criteria. For example, a media object of type message/rfc-822 should be
viewable as text. I don't think we need to put that in as a normative
inclusion, but I think it better to state the two conditions as given as
normative inclusions (clarifying, but not exhausting, the cases to be
included).
I would also add
c) [In the absence of authoritative MIME-type information to the contrary,]
any media object identified as XML or SGML by a DOCTYPE indication conforming
to the rules of those formats.
It is overly onerous to check a media object for text-ness in general. But
it is not overly onerous to check the head of a file for a legal DOCTYPE
indication.
Note that User Agents receive media objects in many ways. The HTTP protocol
is somewhat reliable as regards providing MIME-type information for the data
so delivered. The file: and ftp: URI schemes, on the other hand, do not
provide this kind of information. In cases like these, using the built-in
markings of XML and SGML objects is appropriate and should be expected.

PS:
Yes, I think that the group over-reacted before and that this approach
should remove the developer concern while better preserving the substance of
the provision.
PPS: The bit about 'in the absence of authoritative information to the
contrary' could be omitted above. It's pretty picky. But User Agents that
receive data identified in the HTTP headers as of type
application/octet-stream, for example, should *not* be *required* to check
the contents at all, even if there is a DOCTYPE inside the file and the
whole thing is validatable XML or SGML. There is a principle related to
this in the working papers [findings] of the TAG. I still think that User
Agents should not be discouraged from offering a text view of anything that
may make some sense in that view. On the other hand, they should not be
required to do so when there is strong evidence against this expectation.
Hi Al,
Thanks for your comments on the requirements of Checkpoint 2.2. At this
point I would like to only require the use of header information (media
type) in determining if the format is composed of text. I suggest we add a
informative note saying that when header (media type) information is not
available the user agent can do other things to determine if a format is
composed of text and should provide a source view. But I do not want to
make the no media type case a requirement, since it would be expanding the
scope of of the checkpoint at this point in the process.
If you feel strongly we can add it the issues list for the next version of
the document.
