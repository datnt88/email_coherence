Dave already mentioned this. But Lynx does a great job of converting
to text. It even includes a list of references at the end of the page.
Hi, I was wondering if there's a way to use Tidy to remove all HTML
from a page and just get the text.
In other words, I like to use Tidy as an HTML to Text conversion
utility that I can call problematically.
Actually, I am planning on using JTidy so that I can do this
conversion as part of an application I am working on.
Thanks in advance.
