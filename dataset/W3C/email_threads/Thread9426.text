** Next Telecon
DECISION: Meet again same time, next week.
** Review of Completed Actions
All actions were considered completed.
** Progress on Primer Subgroup
EricM explained he spent some time putting together an outline,
pointing to core documents. He hopes to have people to meet
together on a telecon. DanC thought it'd be fine if it was
discussed on the normal RDF Core time. The time Eric proposed
was Wednesday at 10AM, which did not work for at least one of
the primer subgroup members (Aaron).
ACTION 2001-09-21#1: Eric Miller / Try to publish a TOC of primer stuff
ACTION 2001-09-21#1: Eric Miller / Organize telecon if needed,
and all interested parties can participate, if not, ask for
telecon time
** Issue: rdfs-no-cycles-in-subClassOf
Sergey decided that he was OK with dropping this restriction.
DECISION: To resolve issue rdfs-no-cycles-in-subClassOf by
deleting the restriction prohibiting cycles of subClassOf
properties. The meaning of a cycle of subClassOf properties
being an assertion that the classes involved have the same
members. A more formal specification of the meaning will be
given in the model theory.
Pat agreed to bring this decision back to the DAML Joint
Committee. We decided to put off approval of the test case until
next week when we had a better handle on how to structure the
test case directories. We decided next week we should look at
removing the restriction on subPropertyOf when Frank puts
together a similar proposal together.
ACTION 2001-09-21#3: Dan Connolly / Place
rdfs-no-cycles-in-subClassOf in proper place in directory
structure once that place is decided.
ACTION 2001-09-21#4: Pat Hayes / Take the subClassOf decision
back to DAML Joint Committee.
ACTION 2001-09-21#5: Frank Manola / Present similar proposed
resolution and test case for subPropertyOf cycles
** Model Theory Working Draft
We discussed that this doesn't change the current set of specs
any more than decisions the WG has already made, but merely
formalizes the text of the specs. We also agreed that this does
not mean we've formally agreed on everything in the draft,
merely that we feel it is ready to stay on the Web forever, and
that we're obliged to accept comments on that.
DECISION: Publish the Model theory Working Draft (with possible
minor cosmetic changes)
ACTION 2001-09-21#6: Dan Connolly / Act as staff contact for
publication of Model Theory Working Draft
** RDF Schema Status
While DanBri was absent, we noted that he reported by email that
he planned to have the WD next Wednesday for review. It might be
too late for us to review it by Friday, but it will go on the
agenda if it arrives.
** Propose test case
wg/2001Sep/0109.html
Jeremy explained that this was an XML error to catch those that
didn't use established MXL infrastructure. A number of people
looked at the test case and said it was fine.
ACTION 2001-09-21#7: Jeremy Carroll / Add a comment to explain
the error in http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-
wg/2001Sep/att-0109/01-error001.rdf
DECISION: Approve
wg/2001Sep/att-0109/01-error001.rdf with above caveat
ACTION 2001-09-21#8: Art Barstow / Update
url/test001.rdf to include an explanation of the test case
(especially for those whose browsers convert &amp;amp; to &amp; for
them).
DECISION: Approve http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-
tests/rdfcore/amp-in-url/test001.rdf with above caveat
** Test cases that don't fit the RDF/XML - N-Triples paradigm
Jos volunteered to write up a proposal of entailment tests, he
felt that it was a simple problem. Jan Grant suggested we use an
RDF manifest (manifest.rdf) of the tests to explain things to
automated tools.
ACTION 2001-09-21#9: Jos de Roo / Write up something to describe
these entailment tests (with help from Pat)
ACTION 2001-09-21#10: Jan Grant / Write up proposal for an RDF
test case manifest
ACTION 2001-09-21#11: Art Barstow / Collect the above materials
for inclusion the RDF Test Cases WD
** parseType QNames
Bill explained he was writing up another version of his
proposal, which should be on the list Monday. We should have a
yes/no vote on Friday. He explained the proposal only affected
future parseType's. There was some discussion about
incompatibility with some daml:collection parsers, but we seemed
to agree this was a minor point. (Note to those who have
daml:collection parsers, please make your parsers understand
this as a QName, not a fixed literal.)
ACTION 2001-09-21#11: Bill DeHora / Take proposal to the list
next week on parseType QNames
** Other discussions
ACTION 2001-09-21#12: Bill DeHora / Annoy Pat Hayes until
there's a Model Theory section in the primer

14:09:44 scribe-Aaron eric: spent some time putting together
outline, identifying core documents
14:09:54 scribe-Aaron ... hoping to get group of interested
people on telecon
14:10:04 scribe-Aaron ... wants to get information out first
14:10:10 scribe-Aaron Trying to get people to own portions of

14:10:55 scribe-Aaron eric: separate telecon to kick it off,
might be a large chunk of time
14:11:06 scribe-Aaron ... thought it'd be better use of time,
report back to larger group
14:11:12 scribe-Aaron danc: rather do it here, at this telecon

14:12:03 scribe-Aaron ... want to make sure we all agree on outline
14:12:15 scribe-Aaron ... might be more time than chair might
have wished
14:12:24 scribe-Aaron DanC: I'd like it here.
14:12:33 OL OL has joined #rdfcore
14:12:47 scribe-Aaron jeremy: prefer not to have it in core
telecon time
14:13:22 scribe-Aaron eric: not saying we'll have a separate
list... just a kickoff conferenece
14:13:27 scribe-Aaron ... of course reporting back at core meeting
14:14:02 scribe-Aaron bwm: try and find a time that works for
all, if not, we'll allocate a chunk of time
14:14:32 scribe-Aaron frankm: in addition, we can have a good
amount of dialog via email, and drafting text
14:14:52 scribe-Aaron ... bit theoretical to divide ahead of time
14:15:07 scribe-Aaron ... can have some concrete stuff to go on
14:15:17 scribe-Aaron eric: i absolutely agree
14:15:28 scribe-Aaron ... just hoping to get it out, and we
establish common base
14:15:41 scribe-Aaron ... using list with PRIMER: syntax and
get writing
14:15:50 DanC * DanC missed a lot of stuff from last week...
goes to re-read minutes...

14:16:18 Jema Jema notes action 2001-09-21#1
14:16:19 DanC I hope the primer TOC has pointers to existing

14:18:03 Jema -decision ... // record a decision
14:18:18 scribe-Aaron Sergey: at F2F, I argued against
dropping the restriction... company relied on it
14:18:28 scribe-Aaron came to conclusion that having the
restriction is not essential
14:18:40 scribe-Aaron ... the tool can have a policy
independent of the language
14:18:50 scribe-Aaron ... enforced by the specific application
14:18:58 scribe-Aaron ... Now, i'd go ahead with removing restriction
14:19:03 DanC * DanC cheers
14:19:13 scribe-Aaron Proposal: to resolve issue
rdfs-no-cycles-in-subClassOf by allowing cycles
14:19:13 scribe-Aaron of subClassOf properties. The meaning
of a cycle of subClassOf
14:19:13 scribe-Aaron properties being an assertion that the
classes involved have the same
14:19:13 scribe-Aaron members. A more formal specification of
the meaning will be given
14:19:13 scribe-Aaron in the model theory.
14:19:48 scribe-Aaron +Pat
14:20:08 DanC * DanC seconds the proposal
14:20:24 scribe-Aaron Frank: slight change to the wording,
after talking to Pat
14:20:39 scribe-Aaron s/allowing cycles/deleting restriction
prohibiting cycles/
14:21:10 scribe-Aaron bwm: test cases decision separate from wording
14:21:13 scribe-Aaron Any dissent?
14:21:23 scribe-Aaron Any dissent to the no dissent?
14:21:32 scribe-Aaron Unanimous decision.
14:21:37 scribe-Aaron No abstentions.
14:21:47 DanC RESOLVED.
14:21:49 scribe-Aaron -decision restriction subclass cycles
are removed
14:21:59 OL * OL congratulates the wg
14:22:05 em * em raises hand
14:22:39 em * em just wants to make sure Pat will reflect this
decision back to the JC
14:22:42 scribe-Aaron jeremy: syntactic issues should be
separate from semantic ones
14:22:50 scribe-Aaron ... now just looks like a syntactic issue
14:22:53 scribe-Aaron * scribe-Aaron agrees
14:23:14 scribe-Aaron bwm: let's separate approval of test
case, from test case directory structure
14:23:22 scribe-Aaron danc: except that test case includes its name
14:23:29 OL * OL is sure that Pat and Ora both will (reflect
the decision, that is)
14:23:31 scribe-Aaron ... bit weird to approve it and then
change it's name...
14:23:43 scribe-Aaron bwm: editorial change not much of a problem
14:24:10 scribe-Aaron DanC: would sure be nice to have....
kinda hard to ascertain status from minutes, and links, etc.
14:24:16 scribe-Aaron bwm: let's put it off to next week
14:24:41 scribe-Aaron daveb, frankm, jos, i agree
14:24:45 scribe-Aaron jos: perhaps a more complex cycle
14:25:17 scribe-Aaron -action DanC / Place testcase in the
proper place in directory structure once that place is decided
14:25:18 Jema Jema notes action 2001-09-21#3

decision back to DAML Joint Committee
14:26:06 Jema Jema notes action 2001-09-21#4
14:26:30 scribe-Aaron pat: were loops in subpropertyof prohibited?
14:26:42 scribe-Aaron danc: i think so...
14:27:03 DanC "A property can never be declared to be a
subproperty of itself, nor of any of
14:27:03 scribe-Aaron A property can never be declared to be a
subproperty of itself, nor of any of its own subproperties.
14:27:03 DanC its own subproperties. " --
14:27:32 scribe-Aaron the subpropertyOf decision should also
be removed... needs testcase and formal proposal
14:27:46 scribe-Aaron -action Frank Manola / present similar
resolution and test case for subPropertyOf cycles

Model theory WD at:
14:28:25 scribe-Aaron sergey: what does this change?
14:28:32 scribe-Aaron danc: we all have different ideas of the
current situation
14:28:43 scribe-Aaron ... is there an explicit enumeration of
changes to the spec?
14:28:54 scribe-Aaron Pat: I don't think it changes the spec
at all... afaik
14:29:32 scribe-Aaron ... it says that treatment of domain and
range is different than RDFS, but we've agreed that should change
14:29:48 scribe-Aaron JanG: the model theory is in agreement
with the previous point we agreed on
14:30:06 scribe-Aaron DanC: we'll have it on the web forever,
and obliged to accept comments on it
14:30:11 scribe-Aaron Pat: perfectly happy with that
14:30:28 scribe-Aaron FrankM: One comment people might make is
inconsistency with MT and specs
14:30:38 scribe-Aaron Pat: later versions OK?
14:30:40 scribe-Aaron Absolutely.
14:30:46 scribe-Aaron BillD: Will this be a REC?
14:31:15 scribe-Aaron DanC: you get questions from weirdos in

tests/rdfcore/amp-in-url/test001.rdf is approved with above
caveat
14:40:21 scribe-Aaron no dissent
14:40:33 DanC RESOLVED unanimously.
14:40:33 scribe-Aaron -agenda 12
14:40:42 scribe-Aaron 12: Test cases that don't fit the RDF/XML to
14:40:43 scribe-Aaron paradigm.
14:40:43 DanC does jema note decisions?
14:40:43 scribe-Aaron Jos has volunteered to write up a
proposal for entailment tests.
14:40:57 scribe-Aaron yes, apparently ... they get emailed to
the list after the meeting
14:41:16 scribe-Aaron Jos: I think this is a simple problem...
i guess we need some conventions
14:41:21 DanC have you been telling jema about decisions we're making?
14:41:29 scribe-Aaron yes.
14:41:33 scribe-Aaron ... i'm so glad we have model theory to refer to
14:41:46 scribe-Aaron ... we just need some way to combine the
pieces together... we need a way to describe that
14:42:03 scribe-Aaron Pat: when you use the model theory in
this context, you need to be careful about RDF/RDFS distinciton
14:42:26 scribe-Aaron ... just replied to Jeremy Carroll about
RDFS entailments which are not RDF entailments
14:42:40 scribe-Aaron Jos: I understand... added -rdfcore
switch to do that in our software
14:42:58 scribe-Aaron ... the structure we have now has no problem
14:43:11 scribe-Aaron ... schema issues require this kind of
functionality in my opinion
14:43:19 scribe-Aaron ... lots of cross combinations
14:43:41 scribe-Aaron ... we need to reuse things... just need
descriptions of entailment
14:43:45 scribe-Aaron ... and tools with the same interface
14:44:02 scribe-Aaron bwm: my reaction was that meaning is not
obvious to me, not a logic geek
14:44:08 scribe-Aaron ... I was asking "what is this?"
14:44:46 scribe-Aaron Jos: the abstraction of the axioms was confusing
14:44:56 scribe-Aaron ... we just need 1, 2, 3, 4... with
different range and domain
14:45:02 scribe-Aaron ... and say it's valid... it's possible
14:45:11 scribe-Aaron Bwm: I just want you to write up clearly
how they work
14:45:29 scribe-Aaron Jos: two steps... 1-1 mapping
14:45:50 scribe-Aaron ... I agree... machine understanable description
14:46:12 scribe-Aaron Jeremy: I have a program that goes thru
the zip and knows what to do
14:46:26 scribe-Aaron ... if we have different instructions...
clear to a program... it's much hard to write regression test
software
14:46:33 scribe-Aaron ... we need this for high quality RDF tools
14:46:37 scribe-Aaron ... it's a must
14:46:53 scribe-Aaron Jos: description of A, B, C entails D...
not too difficult
14:46:56 scribe-Aaron ... we need that, tho
14:47:06 scribe-Aaron JanG: we need machine-readable manifest
14:47:12 scribe-Aaron ... to see if it's parser tests, or entailment

think it's good for the model theory
14:48:35 scribe-Aaron -action Jos / write up something to

14:48:45 scribe-Aaron Jeremy: quite happy with Jan's proposal
to have a manifest
14:49:02 scribe-Aaron JanG: just have a machine readable
manifest with a list of parser tests
14:49:12 scribe-Aaron ... could call it manifest.rdf ... it
could be in RDF!
14:49:21 scribe-Aaron bwm: we need someone to work this up

14:51:53 scribe-Aaron DanC: Chair is to be congratulated!
14:52:14 scribe-Aaron AOB: Bill on parseTypes
14:52:26 scribe-Aaron ... sent to the list, had some feedback
(mainly from GK)
14:52:33 scribe-Aaron ... want to write it up now, in a
less-featured form
14:52:43 scribe-Aaron ... it should be on the list Mon, we
should have a yes/no on Friday
14:53:39 scribe-Aaron BillD: What we have in current M&amp;S stands
14:53:46 scribe-Aaron ... future implementors namespace-qualify
14:53:51 scribe-Aaron DanC: just for new parseTypes?
14:54:02 scribe-Aaron BillD: yes... or make it look so
14:54:10 scribe-Aaron Jeremy: might influence daml:collection
14:54:18 scribe-Aaron BillD: Is that a namespace?
14:54:36 scribe-Aaron Jeremy: parsers tend to hard-code the
prefix 'daml:'
14:54:47 scribe-Aaron ... whatever the current state of the
namespace binding... they tend to do that
14:54:56 scribe-Aaron ... the proposal changes the behavior,
as I understand it
14:55:06 scribe-Aaron ... it needs to look at the namespace binding
14:55:12 scribe-Aaron ... i'm happy, but it is a significant change
14:55:24 scribe-Aaron DanC: You've actually seen code?
14:55:32 scribe-Aaron Jeremy: I've written it
14:55:39 scribe-Aaron DanC: that's a sin against the world!
14:55:53 scribe-Aaron BillD: I haven't find anything that says
it is namespace-qualified
14:56:08 scribe-Aaron Jeremy: it never says anything about namespace
14:56:27 scribe-Aaron DanC:.. yuck, it does say that... that's
a crime!
14:56:44 scribe-Aaron Pat: I don't think there's a great deal
of code that this will destroy
14:56:54 scribe-Aaron Pat: I think the JC will say "What?"
14:57:10 scribe-Aaron MikeD: there are about 7 parsers... i
think they hard-code it
14:57:20 scribe-Aaron DanC: parser at W3C doesn't hard code it
14:57:48 scribe-Aaron DaveB: daml:collection space was donated
to my parser by a DAML researcher
14:58:27 scribe-Aaron Pat: I wanted to as Mike if he thinks
parsers are in deep dodo
14:58:34 scribe-Aaron Mike: probably relatively easy to fix
14:58:55 scribe-Aaron DanC: if daml is bound to something
else, you can't pay attention to it!
14:59:13 scribe-Aaron -action BillD / Take proposal to the

14:59:21 scribe-Aaron BillD: are you busy next week, Pat?
14:59:25 scribe-Aaron Pat: What a silly question...
14:59:35 scribe-Aaron BillD: I'd like a model theory bit for

Oddly, I can see Pat's document becoming a very useful general introduction
to model theory, with RDF as a sample language... it (RDF) has enough
complexity to show what the MT brings to the party, but is simple enough to
be easy to understand what is going on.
Also, I think there's some background in Pat's old "Naive physics
manifesto" papers that helps to motivate the necessity of mapping from
language to some domain of discourse.
(I offer this simply as observations from someone who has relatively
recently gone through a learning process about MT principles.)
Thus, rather than duplicating material in the MT document, maybe the primer
material could be a short commentary on that document?

I think so. I'll be upfront in saying my interest in bringing up the MT in
the primer was to explain to developers and modelers why having a model
theory is beneficial and how it may be of practical use.

Done:
You write that the ampersand is replaced by its numerical value,
but it is not -- it is replaced with the string '&amp;amp;'. Please
correct this. As it stands now it is even more confusing than
before. :-(
Thanks,
[ "Aaron Swartz" ; mailto:me@aaronsw.com ; http://www.aaronsw.com/ ]
That wasn't my intent. I added the following text to the
test case:
Description: the purpose of this test case is to show how
how XML's Predefined Entities - in this case the ampersand -
is escaped when it is used in the value of an rdf:about
attribute. Note that the ampersand is represented by its
numeric value as specified in:
In the associated N-Triples file the numeric value of the
ampersand will be replaced with single ampersand character.
Note: when a XML/HTML browser is used to display this file, the
ampersand may be displayed and not its numeric value.
Anyhow, specific word changes would be helpful.
Then I don't understand what you mean in this paragraph.
I'd be happy to provide:
Description: the purpose of this test case is to show how
reserved characters in XML - in this case the ampersand -
are escaped when they are used in an RDF document.
Note that the ampersand is represented by its
corresponding entity as specified in:
In the associated N-Triples file the encoded ampersand entity
will be replaced with a single ampersand character.
Note: when a XML/HTML browser is used to display this file, the
ampersand may be displayed instead of the '&amp;amp;amp;' entity.
[ "Aaron Swartz" ; mailto:me@aaronsw.com ; http://www.aaronsw.com/ ]
Aaron seems to think that
contains the string '&amp;amp;amp;'
Art's comment seems to be about the string '&amp;#38;' which I seem to find
in the file.
I will confess to being unsure as to what is the actual string in the
file, the layers of escaping technology do add confusion; but Art's
modification makes sense to me.
Aaron, how are you looking at this file?
I am using internet explorer 5 and view source
or netscape 4.7 save to disk and then wordpad.
Art: my suggested wording is:
Note: when a XML/HTML browser is used to display this file, an
ampersand may be displayed and not the escape sequence:
ampersand hash 38 ;
In this case, please use a "view source" or a "save to disk" action.
Jeremy
I see '&amp;#38' also, viewing the file with BBEdit 6.1 after scarfing it
with Omniweb.

I talked to Aaron about this via IRC. When Aaron's browser
displays the test case:
the ampersand's numeric character reference is displayed as the
sequence of characters:
'ampersand' 'a' 'm' 'p' ';' [this seems like a browser bug
to me]
Anyway, we agreed that most of my original text along with
some of Jeremy's suggested wording was acceptable. The modified
text is below. Since this apparently will be an agenda item
for this Friday's teleconf, I have not changed the file.
Art
Description: the purpose of this test case is to show
how one of XML's Predefined Entities - in this case the
ampersand - is represented when it is used in the value of
an rdf:about attribute. The ampersand is represented
by its numeric character reference as specified in:
In the associated N-Triples file, the ampersand will be
represented with a single ampersand character (and not the
ampersand's numeric character reference).
Note: when a XML/HTML browser is used to display this file,
a single ampersand character may be displayed and not the
ampersand's numeric character reference. In this case, the
browser may provide an alternate way to view the file (such
as viewing the file's source or saving to a file).
My goof: I just put this on the list of possibles for the agenda
in case you guys felt you needed it. Looks as though you've got
this sorted out, so I don't see any need to include it.
If that is not right - we can take it under AOB.
