Recommendations:
(1) Toss out cardinalities altogether in OWL-Lite. FunctionalProperty already
covers the MAX1 case. Add a 'RequiredProperty' property to cover MIN1.
Invent a third property to cover MAX0.
(2) State upfront whether or not OWL-Lite is intended to be
upward compatible with RDF(S).
(3) Toss out TransitiveProperty and SymmetricProperty. They add little
if any value, and make things harder to implement.
(4) Forget about OWL-Heavy (for now; maybe forever).
Question:
What happened to 'first' and 'rest'? The 'bag' stuff in RDF is hideous.
If 'first' and 'rest' clash with some other properties from a computability
standpoint, consider eliminating those other properties.

Bob, I'll let the editors respond to the specific comments, this
latter is definitely an issue the group will consider - it's already
in our issue list (i.e. whether to have levels or just "heavy" or
just lite)
the RDF Core WG has announced that they intend to provide a
collection parsetype similar to the one used in DAML+OIL (i.e. first
and rest) -- we currently intend to use their solution to closed
sets, at the time we wrote these documents we didn't have details of
their solution.

Thanks Bob for your comments on the Feature Synopsis Document and, in
particular, on the choices
concerning OWL Lite.
We greatly appreciate comments on the documents and particularly value
comments from people like
youself who have spent many years designing, implementing, and using
knowledge representation and
reasoning systems.
(for those on the mailing list who do not know, Bob MacGregor is the
original author and later
technical lead for Loom and PowerLoom among other things).
Specific responses below.
We welcome any additional input.
thx,
Deborah
