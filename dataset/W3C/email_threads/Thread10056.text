Steve,
On Friday's telecon, you stated as a requirement:
[["Inline" literals are required, don't care about model theory]]
What exactly did you mean here. I thought at the time you meant that we
get rid of non typed literals, but maybe you meant something else.
Brian
I can't speak for Steve of course, but I
often had something like:
the MT forces us to interpret a literal as
something, but what? (not yet so what)
Some (including myself) say that it denotes itself,
others say that it denotes the value of a function
eg:dt(lexical-form) (and still others would maybe
say that there should be more function arguments
taken into account).
The former is a minimal interpretation and kind of
leaves the meaning of a statement determined by the
statement verb, which is why I like it.
The latter can be achieved with datatyped literals
such as e.g. used in
eg:s eg:p eg:dt"abc" .
eg:s eg:p (eg:dt "abc") .
eg:s eg:p eg:dt("abc") .
As far as I can see both stances use different models
but *could* have intended the same and therefore
want to use the same property name, which looks like
a bug to me (and which is not the fault of the MT).

Just the opposite, I think it is essential we continue to have non-typed
inline literals that are "interpreted" at the application level. I.e.
applications that currently use bare literals should continue to work as
expected and not require re-writing.
