Subject: 1.4a Unix version doesn't follow links
I've just dowloaded and installed 1.4a on a Sun Sparc Unix platform. But
I can't get it to follow hypertext links. Apparently I need to
double-click them, but this fails to work.
FAQ and archives don't seen to mention this. Anyone know what's wrong?
I just experienced a similar problem with the LINUX-ELF version. It's
not as straightforward as it might seem, though.
Using the fvwm2 or fvwm window managaer (the two I've tried so far)
it does seem to follow links OK.
You have to be careful about how you physically double-click, however:
I found it necessary to hold down the button for about half a second on
the second click. Then it was OK.
Using the KDE desktop environment, on the other hand, double click does
nothing that single click doesn't do, i.e. at most it may move the
cursor. It certainly doesn't fire up any links. It doesn't matter how I
vary the action.
I suspect there is some timing problem in Amaya with respect to X.
Not only is there the above with double-click, but I also find that
the screen tends to "flash" when changing pages; and pixels tend to
go blank when you scroll with the arrow keys (the PgUp/Dn keys seem
to be all right, though), so that text lines may lose the bottom halves
of characters or go blank altogether. Text lines can get superimposed too.
I was tempted into trying Amaya after reading an approving write-up
in yesterday's Times "Inter//face".
Granted, it's compact and fast and has various extras you won't easily
find with Netscape, and its editing capabilities look interesting; but
I don't think it's that good yet as a browser and certainly won't be
displacing Netscape yet for solid work we need to do here.
However, we think it's well worth keeping an eye on.
By the way, I just joined this list, so Hello All, and best wishes.
Ted.

I think this is actually a long-standing problem. I believe I reported it
last year for an earlier binary (1.3, I think) with the Openlook window
manager and X11R6.1 on a Linux 2.x box and the same problem is still there
with the 1.4a binary. The double click works fine under the Lesstif
window manager (mwm) on the same box.
Someone else reported the problem just after I did, but I don't recall
ever seeing the problem addressed.

Yes, I finally found your message back in Nov 1997. There were other
messages earlier and later about the same problem, including responses
from Ir?ne Vatton.
The Amaya developers don't seem to have encountered this problem
themselves. This could suggest a number of possibilities.
Maybe there's some quirk about the Thot libraries on Linux. Maybe the
static binaries (presumably with Motif) interact badly. Maybe the
suggestion to compile it oneself (with all that that implies about
laying in lesstif etc and crossing one's fingers) might be a solution.
However, the fact that W3C put out a Linux binary sugegsts that they
themselves can get it to work on Linux. Could the developers state which
WM or WMs they have tried it on successfully? Have they encountered the
problem with some WMs on Linux?
This is the first application I have ever encountered which failed
totally to recognise double click. The nearest I had before was XFMail
which, under KDE/KWM at any rate, has to be double-clicked very carefully;
but this is a known problem with the XForms library that XFMail uses.
Even so, it does work if you practice!
Meanwhile, though Amaya looks like an excellent editor if not browser,
even for that purpose you need to be able to follow links in the
document you are editing. For experimental purposes I'm willing to try
it out using a non-KDE environment (e.g. fvwm), but I don't want to give
up my KDE for general use!
I think the root of this problem needs to be tracked down. Even if it
persists, knowing where it lies may enable people to take appropriate
prophylactic steps in compiling.
Best wishes,
Ted.

I use Amaya on fvwm and afterstep, and it doesn't give any trouble running
from the binary.

As I see difference on the same amaya with different windowmanagers, I
should say it is a problem in the windowmanager!
Those with problems, can you change some of the windowmanagers click
options? Check your windowmanager manual for the options to change single,
double and tripple click timeouts and offsets.
On the other hand, Is it Amaya that interprets the double click from
multiple single clicks or does amaya accept a 'double click' event? That can
also be a source for the problem.
Sorry, I don't know details but those are the things I think of.

After seeing your reply and a few others (many thanks for the help) it
seems that this is a real problem and one which has been on-going for some
time. I thought I'd try and compile amaya...no joy. The make process is
badly broken on my machine. Among the errors I get is:
configure: warning: Thot editor sources not found
and complaints about thot.ini not found in /usr/tmp/config when in fact
the file is in /usr/tmp/Thot/config. Even making a symlink (so
/usr/tmp/config/thot.ini points to where is actally is) still produced
loads of warnings like "WARNING: cannot open file en-libdialogue" and
eventually:
(if test "../amaya" != "" -a "../amaya" != "." ; then \
/usr/bin/cp ../amaya/MathML.A . ; \
/usr/bin/cp ../amaya/MathML.STR . ; \
fi)
cp: ../amaya/MathML.A and ./MathML.A are identical
cp: cannot access ../amaya/MathML.STR
make[1]: *** [MathML.h] Error 2
make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/tmp/Thot/amaya'
It occurred to me to suggest to the developers (via this list) to adopt a
right-click to follow a link and a left-click to edit, that is if the
developers are unable to track this problem down. Being unable to compile
amaya (and only knowing how to write X11 software using Tcl/Tk) I have not
attempted this myself.

I second this suggestion. (I was concerned at first that right-click
might act as in an xterm, to extend text-blocking, but it seems that
right-click is currently inactive in Amaya and the only way to block
text is by dragging with the left button).
So AFL's suggestion should work fine so long as right-click is
recognised.
Yes please!
Ted.

This could also be implemented in the Windoze version, as PCs have two
button mice. [Not sure how much common code there is between the
various platforms, so anything which reduces "Unix only" hacks is a Good
Thing.]
