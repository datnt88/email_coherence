Brian, (&amp; everyone else),
Did you get a chance to review Peter's proposed closure for pfps-11?
I can live with the specific changes he proposes there, but have had
difficulty extrapolating from those examples to figure out what
"[and so on]" would amount to. Suggestions?
Dan
I just did. It loses all sense of what a statement means.
I assume similar changes for predicate and object.

I guess I view the reification vocab as accumulated junk, so that
doesn't bother me as much as it would if the reification vocabulary
worked. But that's not a very helpful view.
I am prepared to live with this edit. Does it go too far for you? Can
you think of some plausible middleground?
OK, I had nagging fear it was 'and so on' through the entire spec...
I can extrapolate the text to those two properties ok.
Dan
