In addition to the SSH specification draft, we have a draft describing
TLS, based on SSL version 3.0 with some modifications, thanks to
Paul Kocher, Phil Karlton, and a few other folks.
The drafts are available in:
PostScript: ftp://ftp.openmarket.com/pub/misc/ietf-tls/postscript
MSWord: ftp://ftp.openmarket.com/pub/misc/ietf-tls/doc
Text will be available shortly.
My apologies for the short time to read the draft, but I think it is the
best basis for discussion next week, and I look forward to a
productive meeting.

beware that 1-title.ps has an extra blank line before the %!PS-Adobe-3.0
line, so ya gotta zap it before sending it to the printer (but it's only
a title page anyway).

Thanks, Bennet. I fixed the file.

I wish the TEXT version (see RFC-1543, we have a STANDARD for this) was
available. Some people don't have PostScript printers, and other people
don't use WORD, and violating the IETF process (i.e. not reading RFC1543) is
a non-goal of this WG.

The process for accurately converting the Word document to ASCII is both
lengthy and difficult. In order to be sure the draft was available
before the Montreal conference, the Word and PS versions had to be used.
An RFC-1543 compliant version of the draft is being developed now and
should be available to the list before the conference.

Is a list of the changes (the "some modifications") made to the SSL 3.0
draft available?

I'd like to add my name to the list of people who have requested
that the ASCII version of the Karlton/Kocher TLS draft be made available
ASAP, hopefully before Monreal.
I understand that it's inconvenient for the authors to generate
an ASCII version, given their choice of tools, however, please
understand that ASCII is much more convenient for many of us,
particularly Unix users and those who intend to read largely online.
Thanks,

As long as we're asking...
Maybe the outline from the "5/29 TLS Meeting Notes" message sent to the list
on June 5 could be used to relate the "some modifications" to the plan for
changes.

I apologize that an ASCII version of the draft isn't available yet.
The timing of things did not work out well.
It will not happen again. We will have handouts in Montreal,
and an ASCII version online shortly, I hope.
