We're supposed to have a call tomorrow.
Glen, did you manage to contact Paco regarding the WS-Policy
presentation?
I didn't any strong objection against the HTTP features and properties
proposal? Should I assume that it's good for review by the WG now and
the PnF TF thinks it's the way to go?
ACTION: Glen to write why it should a property instead of an XML element
(pros and cons)
ACTION: Philippe to write his HTTP features/properties proposal

I've got Zakim again (and this time, for all Tuesdays), so from now, we
should only use Zakim.
Phone number and passcode, see
Philippe
I just did this this morning, and he's agreed to do an introductory presentation to help frame our discussion. He'll be sending some slides to the list to follow along with sometime today (thanks Paco!).
Let's discuss tomorrow.
I haven't gotten to this yet - will try to do it tonight if possible....
--Glen
Access to Zakim is restricted at this time and noone on IRC,
although [1] says "5pm Europe/Rennes".
Is this a time screw up? Didn't the US change time last week-end
as well?
JJ.
No - our time change is *next* weekend. :)
See you in ~45m....
