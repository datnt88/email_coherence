Hello,
I am new on this list so I hope it is the right place to ask.
I am formationg xml files with JTidy. I have 2 questions to the result of
the format. Here is a example output:
xsd:schema xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/XMLSchema"
targetNamespace="http://apache.org/cocoon/sitemap/1.0"
xmlns="http://apache.org/cocoon/sitemap/1.0"

- Why are some elements divided with blank lines? Other parts of the output
have no blank lines.
- When elements are wrapped, can the folowing lines (attributes in the
first 3 lines) be indented? I know the option for a linebreak for each
attribute. But I am searching for a possibility to have more than one
attribute in one line.
Thanks
Martin
Boy, I just checked in a fix to that "feature request" for C Tidy
yesterday! Anyway, it was fresh in my mind, so here is a diff to the Java
that will do the same thing.
It will print
instead of
take it easy,
