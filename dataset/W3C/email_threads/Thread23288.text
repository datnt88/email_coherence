Hi,
The javadoc comment for getNodeValue() in org.w3c.dom.Node interface is having
some problem. It says:
* The value of this node, depending on its type; see the table above.
* When it is defined to be code null /code , setting it has no effect.
* @exception DOMException
* NO_MODIFICATION_ALLOWED_ERR: Raised when the node is readonly.
* @exception DOMException
* DOMSTRING_SIZE_ERR: Raised when it would return more characters than
* fit in a code DOMString /code variable on the implementation
* platform.
But, getNodeValue(), never throws DOMException-NO_MODIFICATION_ALLOWED_ERR.
Also, there is no javadoc for setNodeValue().
Same is true for get/setPrefix().
Can anybody tell me, where to file a bug for this?.
NOTE: This bug is in the zip available at: http://www.w3.org/DOM/DOMTR which I
believe is the latest version. Please correct me, if I am wrong.
Suggestion: In some places the javadoc says: "see the table above". But, there
is no table in the javadoc for the interface. It would be better to put the
table there (the one which shows nodeName, nodeValue and attributes for various
types of Nodes under Interface Node, in DOM L2 core).

You are at the right place to report the bug.
I can probably avoid the NO_MODIFICATION_ERR problem, but for the rest
of the description, it will be a duplicate of the getNodeValue one since
it comes from an IDL attribute.
Did you check the erratum core-18 regarding the Core bindings?

Thanks for the pointer Philippe. The zip at the erratum page does takes care of
some javadoc errors. But, the javadocs of get/setNodeValue() and get/setPrefix()
are still not proper. Is there going to be a bug fix release of these
JavaBindings in the near future?.
Thanks,
Rahul.
