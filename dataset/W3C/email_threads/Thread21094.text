Sorry if this is a FAQ. I am unable to build Amaya 8.0 on SuSE Linux
8.1. My errors look different to those reported by Bodo v. Thadden.
I downloaded amaya-src-8.0.tgz to a PC running SuSE Linux 8.1, read
README.amaya, untarred amaya-src-8.0.tgz, created directory LINUX-ELF,
cd'ed to LINUX-ELF, ran ../configure successfully, and then ran make
which gave the the attached output.
Do the Red Hat 8 rpm's work with SuSE 8.1?
Best Regards,
Roger

Well, if suse follows closely the rpm spec, it should, but it's not the best method...
Did you try the binary tgz distribution ?
Usual the first time, this is why we copy options.orig as options
If it cannot found gtk.h, gdk.h. gdk_imlib.h, there's two possibilities :
A) You didn't install the gtk-devel.rpm and gdk-devel.rpm that installs the gtk headers on your Suse
B) Our Configure didn't find your gtk headers. If you have slocate on your suse, could you try a :
#locate gtk.h
#locate gdk.h
#locate gdk_imblib.h
and then send us the output

Hello Paul, No, since these address Windows, Debian and Red Hat, not SuSE.
That's why I downloaded amaya-src-8.0.tgz.
I didn't have the rpm gtk-devel-1.2.10-437 installed. I have now
installed this. The rpm provides:
/usr/include/gtk-1.2/gtk/gtk.h
/usr/include/gtk-1.2/gdk/gdk.h
but not gdk_imblib.h. After some Googling I discovered that searching for
gdk_imlib.h is a popular sport. SuSE 8.1 users will find it hidden in the
rpm imlib-devel-1.9.10-474. It provides
/usr/include/gdk_imlib.h
I re-installed from amaya-src-8.0.tgz and successfully ran configure and
make as instructed in README.amaya. I created a link
ln -s whatever /Amaya/LINUX-ELF/bin/amaya /usr/local/bin/amaya
and amaya runs!
I looked for "cookies" in the Help index and found a visual confusion -
the attached gif shows a small sample. Is there a setting which increases
the interline spacing without increasing the font size?
Many thanks to the amaya team!
Roger
