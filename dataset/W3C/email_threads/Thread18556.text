Hello all,
At the 11 April 2002 teleconference [1], I took an action
regarding issue 521 [2] to identify checkpoints whose
requirements apply independent of formats that are part of the
conformance claim.
I propose that for the following checkpoints (reference UAAG 1.0
12 Sep 2001 draft [3]), the format requirements apply as follows:
3.1 Toggle background images: Applies for all image formats.
3.2 Toggle audio, video, animated images: Applies for
all audio, video, and animated image formats.
3.3 Toggle animated/blinking text: Applies to all formats.
3.7 Toggle images. Applies to all image formats.
4.9 Global volume control. Applies to all audio formats.
I tried to come up with a model that would allow me to choose
some checkpoints and not others, but I couldn't come up with
anything satisfying. One feature of the above checkpoints is that
I think it's possible to recognize images, audio, etc. by content
type, independent of format details.
Proposed changes to the specification:
1) Indicate at the beginning of the section on conformance that
a user agent doesn't have to satisfy the checkpoints for EVERY
implemented format, only those that are part of the conformance
claim with the following exceptions:
- If the conformance claim includes the VisualText
content type label, the user agent must satisfy
3.3 for all formats.
- If the conformance claim includes the Image content
type label, the user agent must satisfy 3.1 and 3.7 for
all image formats.
- If the conformance claim includes one of the Audio, Video,
or Animation content type labels, the user agent must
satisfy 3.2 for all audio, video, or animation formats,
respectively.
- If the conformance claim includes the Audio
content type label, the user agent must satisfy
4.9 for all sources of audio.
3) Update the relevant content type label defintions with the
same information.
Note: I thought that it might be useful to modify the checkpoints
themselves to say "for all image formats" etc. Upon
experimentation, I find that it makes the checkpoints unduly
complicated.

I have no problem with this proposal.

This is a good clarification to the document.

I have several issues with all of this:
1) It presumes that the UA has prior knowledge of all possible
(including not-yet-determined) content type definitions/declarations.
2) Animated and blinking text can be created in ways that are
difficult/impossible to accurately detect.
OK, two issues

Surely for a UA to render content, it must know the content-type, I agree
that where you have "plug-ins" handling certain mime-types that it would
cause a burden on the UA hosting the plug-in, but there it should be down
the plug-in to provide the mechanisms to disable the blinking.
I agree, but I don't think this need prevent the actual existence of the
requirement, for example you can still provide a control which stops
animated gifs and videos in the page which wouldn't stop animation
introduced via css or scripting - but there are other mechanisms which can
stop those aswell. Surely whilst you need to provide the mechanism it
doesn't need to be within one single switch.

JRG: If you don't recognize a content type you will not be able to render
it anyway. Can IE render content that it doesn't recognize?
JRG: We only require that the user agent control based on content type
(animated gif) or markup known to blink (BLINK element). The user agent
does not need to calculate or analyze content to see if it is blinking.
