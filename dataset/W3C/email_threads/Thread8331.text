What permissions are required in order to perform a BIND request? I
would think that permissions for UNBIND and REBIND are identical to
permissions for DELETE and MOVE respectively, but this should be
stated.
Are there issues with CHECKIN of an activity changing multiple bindings
to the same resource? MERGE? Are there any other methods that can
make changes to a number of resources at once, and thus might have
problems addressing several bindings to the same resource?

They should be identical, but I don't agree it needs to be stated in
this document. The ACL spec seems to be clear enough.
Can you be more specific? I fail to see a problem so far...

I think this is well explained in the current ACL spec. Since BIND
creates a new member URL in a
collection and the DAV:bind privilege controls who is allowed to create
new member URLs in
a collection, it seems like a perfect match.
