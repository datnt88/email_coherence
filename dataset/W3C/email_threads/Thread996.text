Hi Arjan,
Have at it. Tidy uses the W3C license which pretty much let's you do what
you want with many of the usual stipulations.
For details, see tidy.c in the current sources or
We all hope you get rich grin !
take it easy,

Hello,
I am trying out tidy in a commercial application. The results look very
promising!
I've browsed the tidy website http://tidy.sourceforge.net), but cannot
find any
licensing terms. Here's my question:
May we redistribute the tidy executables (for different platforms: Linux,
Win32 etc)
with our (commercial) application? Or do we need out customers to download the
executables themselves?
Redistributing would make things a whole lot easier for out customers, but
I need
to be sure that that is legal to do.
Any feedback would be appreciated!
Thanks,
Arjan

Yes, the open source license allows you to redistribute Tidy
free of charge. The license itself can be found as part of the
Tidy source code, see tidy.c in the src directory.
