RSS 1.0 WG,
The Yahoogroups web service, to which the PURL for the RSS 1.0 namespace
URI, http://purl.org/rss/1.0/ currently redirects, now requires cookies.
This makes it tricky for the XHTML/RDDL/RDFSchema document at that URI to
be dereferenced by automated tools.
I copy below a quick sanity-check exchange w/ Rael. I have mirrored our
namespace document at w3.org so that it is accessible without cookies. I
propose that we reconfigure the PURL server to point to this URI instead
of to yahoogroups, at least for the main RSS 1.0 URI. I'll propose a poll
to that effect once we've had time to discuss any possible complications
or alternatives. If the poll is positive, we can take it to a WG vote.
I'll keep this sync'd with any changes to the master copy which currently
resides on www.yahoogroups.com. I'm happy to host such RSS-related docs at
W3C (loosly under the RDF Interest Group banner, ie. this isn't about
going standards-track at W3C). However at W3C we don't yet have the kind
of easy file-sharing tools offered by Yahoo, and I'm wary of creating a
bottleneck for the kind of collaboration we've achieved through the use
of Yahoo's (advertisement-strewn) Web services. We do however take URI
longevity pretty seriously, so I'm happy to offer the WG
make use of.
We could probably copy a bunch of the other docs from the WG filespace on
yahoogroups to W3C (eg. the modules), and it may be that the workings of
the PURL server might require this for PURLs that begin with the same URI;
I'd need to check. Perhaps someone more familiar with the PURL service
could comment? (EricM?)
So I propose a poll (and then vote), with draft text as follows:
(hmm, I've not done one of these before. sorry if this sounds po-faced!)
The RSS 1.0 WG accepts the offer to host some or all of the RSS 1.0 PURL
redirections on the W3C's Web site. This constitutes an informal collaboration
between the RSS 1.0 WG and the W3C RDF / Semantic Web Interest Group; the
continued management of the RSS 1.0 specification and associated
extensions remains with the RSS 1.0 Working Group. The motivation for this
collaboration is to offer cookie and advert-free access to key RSS 1.0
documents for the Web community and their automated tools and services.
The WG also notes that the proposed PURL change is not final, and that
the RSS 1.0 PURLs can be redirected elsewhere in the future.
Proposed redirection changes:
PURL: http://purl.org/rss/1.0/
Current: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/rss-dev/files/namespace.html
Proposed:http://www.w3.org/2002/01/rss/rss1_namespace
Other PURL redirections: to be discussed/proposed?? (in this poll/vote??
or subsequently?? I suggest "at the discretion of the WG chair", ie. leave
this decision to the chair rather than vote on each/every doc URI).
(end of draft poll/vote text)
I'm hoping this should be reasonably uncontroversial, and that we can get
our PURL working again asap. If I've misjudged and this looks like a
clumsy yet sinister W3C takover attempt, or if others rush forward
offering to host the doc(s), maybe it'll take longer.
Comments to the list please; I'll see what folks think and refine and
initiate a poll over the next few days. I'll ping the RDF Interest Group
list too once RSS-DEV has had a digest the proposal.
cheers,
Dan

Rael,
YahooGroups seems to be going downhill; more adverts everywhere etc.
This is a pain for the archives, but I guess livable with. But there's a
problem with the PURL for our namespace. The content isn't dereferencable
without cookies switched on, it seems. This makes it hard for automated
tools to load up our schema declarations. Libby ran into this problem
recently.
For example...
[pldab@snowball pldab]$ wget http://purl.org/rss/1.0/
--14:41:46-- http://purl.org:80/rss/1.0/
= `index.html'
Connecting to purl.org:80... connected!

Connecting to groups.yahoo.com:80... connected!

itself.
Trying same in Lynx gets me:
Your browser is not accepting our cookies. To view this page,
please set your browser preferences to accept cookies (code 0).
How would you feel about having the RSS 1.0 namespace PURL redirect (at
least as an interim measure) to W3C's site?
I've taken the liberty of mirroring the RSS 1.0 namespace "front page" on
w3.org, so there is at least a cookie-free URL for the XHTML/RDF/RDDL
document.
Not really sure what's best to do. Propose the PURL-switch to RSS-DEV as a
vote?
What do you reckon?

I second the poll. Go ahead and create one, Danbri.
Another thought... Should we consider moving everything but our mailing list
conversation over to a Weblog hosted somewhere? I've been using
MoveableType [http://www.moveabletype.org] for some time for my own Weblogs
and it's feature rich: discussion, file upload, multiple
authors/administrators, RSS feeds, and so forth.
If someone volunteers to host it (it's a couple-three Perl scripts) I'll be
glad, as chair, to act as one of the editors/admins. There should also be a
few more folks from the WG who'd edit/admin.

OK, I'll leave it a while to see if the text needs refining (I'm not
distinguishing between poll and vote text, though I suppose poll is just
'should we vote on the following text [...]').
I'm officially intrigued. Most of my weblog-like behaviour is now done via
IRC (http://www.w3.org/RDF/Interest/#irc) and I'd not taken a look at this
yet.
We could perhaps host this on a W3C-hosted box (he says generously,
without checking with other folks it'd create work for). If others are
enthusiastic, I'll look into it.
Related grumble: I'm thinking of moving my rdfweb-dev list away from
YahooGroups; the adverts are just too invasive now. Am interested to hear
of other list hosting options, though current thinking is just to set up
an independent mail archive elsewhere and leave list management at Yahoo.
Dan
Great idea, danbri. A few comments:
It depends on the kind of PURL set up. I think with the current set-up we
don't need to copy everything.
It's way too long for a poll, which sarcasm YahooGroups kindly eliminates
linebreaks and HTML from /sarcasm .
How about:
Do you support having http://purl.org/rss/1.0/ files redirect to someplace
in http://www.w3.org/2002/01/rss/? See
- Yes
- No
- Abstain
As I'm tempted to get this completed ASAP, can I suggest that we not run a
poll/vote unless someone on the list dissents? (If there's unanimity, I
don't see the point in a poll/vote.)

As much as it's tempting to want to route around our convention, this is a
pandora's box. We don't, mind you, have to have a poll before vote. I
propose a vote. If we have a second and put it up, we're only 3 days from
done.

What are the problems that automated tools are having?
I just tried from 'wget' and I get an infinite redirect. Mozilla does not seem
to exhibit this.
Ok... either that or we can move forward if we don't get any -1s.
Thanks for working on this!

Hi Dan,
I think it's a good idea and an honnor for RSS 1.0 to be hosted on the
W3C Web site but I am wondering under which licence it will be published.
Will it it covered (or absorbed) by a general licence applying to
documents published on the W3C web site or can it keep its current
licence unaltered?
Thanks

From what I gather from Danbri's post, this is just an informal hosting
arrangement with no further strings. That said, I'd very much like to make
sure our site maintains its independence, bylaws, authors, etc.
Assuming (and we'll get to this after the first vote is concluded) we want
to run a Weblog for RSS-DEV, I think it'd be great if the W3C could host
that as well.

yup. no strings!
I've not dug much into our policy for this sort of thing, but there are a
lot of documents on w3.org that aren't W3C recommendation-track specs, and
that aren't managed by W3C Working Groups. Simplest example being
lists.w3.org which hosts all kinds of mailing lists (including the WebDAV
WG, for example, an IETF effort). The copyright statement on the RSS 1.0
spec[1] suggests that there should be no problem hosting copies of the
document on other sites, such as w3.org.
If we were considering a submission-request for publishing this stuff as a
W3C Note, we'd probably have a lot more hoops to jump through; getting
signoffs from the spec authors etc. For now, I believe I can just put this
up alongside other RDF Interest Group discussion docs. And I can take it
down again should we decide to do so. Documents that get published at
after publication.
The main thing we'd need to be clear of is to avoid citing the doc in a
way that suggested any sort of W3C REC-track endorsement.
Of course a bunch of us on the semantic web team think RSS 1.0 is the best
thing since sliced bread, but that's kind of different :)
Each document would need to be something that explained it's status etc.
clearly, so that people stumbling over them via search engines, hyperlinks etc
wouldn't mistake them for W3C specifications. Shouldn't be too hard.
My main concern is getting the machine-readable schema back in the Web so
that we get HTTP GET at it without accepting a YahooGroups cookie. Hosting
other docs for the RSS WG, collaboration tools etc. (blogs/wiki?), would
be a bigger project. The latter seems worth investigating, but something
that we can do after we've fixed the cookie problem.
cheers,
Dan
