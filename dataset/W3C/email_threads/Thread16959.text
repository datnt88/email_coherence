I've been implementing a label on a form, and during testing I found it to be rather buggy in various Netscape browsers.
* on NN6.2 it seemed to be fine;
* on NN6.1 the labels didn't render, although there was space where they should have appeared;
* on NN6.0 the labels DO render, but it seems to add a large margin the left side and pushes it all out.
I'm using the label tag, and using a CSS style to change the appearance of it, and I have set the margin to 0px so in theory there shouldn't be all that space on the left in NN6.1.
Are there any good resources which have workarounds on this (using CSS) and maybe any other form accessibility issues?
The other thing is that in the original design, one label appears on the right, while the next form element has it's label on the left. This is bad accessibility, is it not? Should I push to have it more consistent, e.g. all labels on the left?

I would expect all the labels to be consistent on one side for usability
(and not confusing the visitor) as well as accessibility.

Early Netscape 6s (even, I think 6.2) are considered only beta test quality
by the Mozilla developers. It is really not reasonable to design for them.
I believe Netscape are going to use Netscape 7 as the label for the version
based on the version of Mozilla that is considered to be of release quality.
It can be argued that people using NN6 at all are likely to be updating
rapidly.
Thanks for the info. I've since found that cause of my problem. The "text-align: center" declaration on the body element makes the labels disappear. I used this declaration due to the the box model workaround, so I think I need to keep it in, which means I now need to find another workaround to fix a workaround :D
