The Amaya team is proud to announce the availability of the 1.4a release
of the Amaya editor/browser for both Unix and Windows platforms.
This release includes some bug fixes from the previous one (1.4).
Binaries are available at:
Source is available at:
A FAQ is available at http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/FAQ.html
To know more about Amaya releases see http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/New.html
Extensions 1.4a:
* Erich Koerting updated the German dialogue files. Thanks!
* On Unix platforms only, the variable DOUBLECLICKDELAY of the registry
$HOME/.thotrc allows one to control the delay (in millisecond) under which
two mouse clicks are classed as a double-click. The default value is
500 ms.
* Increased the default network timeout from 20000 ms to 60000 ms.
* Changed the USE_CACHE registry variable to ENABLE_CACHE, to be conform
to the other registry variables.
Fixed bugs 1.4a:
* There was a memory leak when following an internal link pointing
to an inexistent anchor.
* Links which point to non-existent documents or invalid URLs
are now left in the "active" state, instead of being set to the
"visited" state.
* Browsing an image from an edited document (and thus requiring the
opening of a new document window), didn't show the image.
* Patches in Amaya Makefiles (suggestions from Sam and Adam)
* Patch for compiling libwww under FreeBSD (contributed by Don Croyle)
* When one created a table while the current selection pointed to an empty
paragraph, Amaya tried to replace the empty paragraph by the table, but
there was a bug which corrupted the Amaya internal structure.
* When requesting a document from a slow site, pressing the Stop button
before the network connection was established could crash Amaya
* When downloading a document with images from the net, following any
internal link in the document caused the interruption of the whole download.
* There was no protection against a redirection to a URL with
protocols not handled by Amaya
* In case of a redirection error, Amaya would not automatically
terminate the request

To build Amaya for Windows, you do not need additional files
for this release. Please refer to Thot/doc/amaya/Win-Compiling.html
(released with the source distribution:
for further information on how to build Amaya on Windows platforms.

It looks like amaya/EDITOR.A got left out of the source distribution
somehow. The build dies here:
THOTDIR=.././.. ; export THOTDIR ; \
../bin/app -DMATHML MathML.A
cc -O -pipe -DMATHML -DHAVE_CONFIG_H
-I. -I.. -I.././../thotlib/include -I.././../amaya -I.././../amaya/f

gmake[1]: *** No rule to make target `.././../amaya/EDITOR.A', needed
by `EDITORAPP.c'. Stop.

I've always wanted to be a dilettante, but I've never quite been ready
to make the commitment.

Sorry, there was a mistake in the tarfile script. A new amaya-src-1.4a.tar.gz
has been installed. Could you try again.

Irene.
Good morning.
I am using a SPARC Solaris 2.6 system. I downloaded the Binary
distribution of Amaya 1.4a today, but find I am unable to make use of it.
This is due to the fact that this version of Amaya has requirements for
versions of dynamic X libraries which do not appear to exist at our site.
If there are requirements for particular versions of X libraries would
it be possible to create the binary distribution with those particular
versions statically linked into the library?

Unless explicitly stated to the contrary, nothing in this posting should
be construed as representing my employer's opinions.
I guess you got the wrong version: http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/BinDist.html
says: "Sparc Solaris 2.6 format amaya-solaris2.6-1.4a.tar.gz (about
2.030,000 bytes) gzipped tar file. In this version the Motif library is
statically linked because the standard distributed version doesn't work.
This library could be incompatible with your local X libraries"
Do you have this 2.6 version? or hte 2.5 version?
If you got the 2.6 version, I think you are in bad luck and have the
incompatible libraries. If you have a compiler with your system (best to
have gcc) get the source and build that one. If gcc and gmake are available,
it's verry easy to build amaya.

The build on Windows NT fails because the make flie does not know how to
build "editor.h". This file does not seem to be included in the source
distribution.
The file Thot/doc/amaya/Win-Compiling.html is also not in the distribution.
I downloaded the distribution from w3c today, January 12th 1999.

Hi;
As a follow up to my previous message about missing files in 1.4a, it
appears that an entire directory: thot/winnt/amaya, is missing. This
directory at a minimum contains files "editor.h" and "html.h". This is
based on the presence of dependencies .\amaya\editor.h and .\amaya\html.h
in thot/winnt/amaya.mak.
As was previously noted, the Thot/doc/amaya/Win-Compiling.html file is also
missing from the distribution.
