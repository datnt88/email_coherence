Dear All,
I've seen a fair amount of Q&amp;A on this topic in the DSIG mailing list over
the past several months, and the universally stated reason for
canonicalizing SignedInfo before Reference validation is to enforce WYSIWYS.
However, I'm still having trouble understanding how this would really be
implemented for same-document fragment Reference URIs where the referenced
XML is a sibling subtree of the enclosing document. For example:
When, at the start of reference validation, XML-C14N (or some other
canonicalization) is applied to the SignedInfo, the result is an octet
stream. In order to proceed with retrieving the referenced object and
calculating the digest value, the application will first need to parse the
octet stream to recover an XML document with Reference elements in it. This
results in a new document that does not contain the data object identified
in the Reference URI. What now?
Thanks,

Hi Vamsi,
you could take ds:SignedInfo, canonicalize, re-parse and substitute the
original-un-c14nized ds:SignedInfo with the c14nized-re-parsed
ds:SignedInfo.
BTW, for your example, you need to declare the Signature namespace for your
signature.

That would work but, even if you are very strictly following the Core
Validation Processing Rules, I don't see why you couldn't just use the
fragment URI to get the data from the original document without
plugging back in the parsed canonicalized SignedInfo. I don't see that
it would make sense for the fragment to point at or inside the
SignedInfo, although you should check for that and probably fail the
signature if you find it's set up that way.
Even further, it seems to me that most implementations will not allow
arbitrary CannonicalizationMethod elements and, in fact, all the ones
we have ever specified are such that you would not get in trouble
doing the Reference Validation on the original document, then applying
CannonicalizationMethod and doing Signature Validation, even though
that's not what the Processing Rules say and is not safe for arbitrary
CannonicalizationMethod elements...

Hi Donald,
You're right. I don't see a problem if you use (validate) the References etc. from the original Document and then do signature validation on the canonicalized ds:SignedInfo. A colleague of me pointed out that this is not
according to the spec, so to strictly follow the spec, we have to c14nize SignedInfo, reparse and substitute for same-document-URIs. But well, my implementation does not do this at the moment.
Does anyone sees a security implication if we do reference validation on the not-c14nized SignedInfo? I don't.
