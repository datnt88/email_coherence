I am a teacher of adults with learning difficulties, they do not all
conform to the above description however:
"the browser should be able to select for all qualities".
I take exception to your recommendation:
A.2 Alternative text and descriptions
Text is considered accessible to almost all users since it may be handled by
screen readers, non-visual browsers, braille readers, etc. It is good
practice, as you design a document containing non-textual information
(images, graphics, applets, sounds, etc.) to think about supplementing that
information with textual equivalents wherever possible.
Our site specifically requires that text is kept to a minimum and that
graphics as nearly as possible are transparent in understanding.
AltText should be supplied but "the browser should be able to select for all
qualities".

Food for thought - I don't think I have an answer yet.
Jonathan touches on an issue that has been raised before (I forget when).
The other case which touched on these issues was where graphics were used
in place of words, analagously to the use of signs. For people who use
this as a primary mode of (visual) communication, the text is no more
accessible than it is to a blind person - it needs to be translated into a
mediun which is suitable, be that braille, graphic symbols or signs.
We should somehow make it clearer that the reasson for text being
considered the basic accessible medium is that it allows those
translations in a way that (for example) graphics does not. I don't know
if anybody in the group who is blind tried to review the sites given, to
better understand the issues, but I would expect them to have a very
difficult time if they did.
If we are going to stick to our principle that 'text is king' (as Daniel
so clearly stated it) then I think we should state that explicitly, and
exlpain why. On the one hand the guidelines need to be interpreted by
using a little common sense, but on the other that is not sufficient
unless we make clear the assumptions with which we are working.
cheers all

In response to Charles' comment, I could rather unhelpfully suggest
that a full transcript of all textual material be provided in an
appropriate sign language as a video track or using any symbolic
representation that is ultimately developed. The difficulty here is
that for a given written or spoken language, there may be more than
one corresponding sign language (E.G. the Australian sign language or
the American sign language). I don't know to what extent the
transcription could be automated.
The point of my comment was that it is possible to automatically translate
text into signs. It is possible to translate text into visual symbols
which are easily understood.
Concentrating on the latter approach for a moment:
Graphic representations of language tend to have small vocabularies. It
does not usually make sense to attempt automated translation between text
and graphics - that is, like machine translation of English to Japanese,
notoriously difficult. But it does make sense to ask that users of graphic
languages which cannot be translated easily provide a text version of what
they are 'saying'. This will provide the mechanics of communication
between, for example, a blind person and a person who can only or best
understand a vocabulary made of visual symbols.
It then remains for the people in question to discover their shared
vocabulary. However, without the mechanical steps having been made there
is a very large communication barrier that precludes the process.
