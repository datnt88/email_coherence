There have been various threads concerned with the issue as to why it is
necessary to provide graphics as well as text.
For people that cannot read, text to speech software seems to offer a
solution.
Those with cognitive disabilities would also need clear and simple
sentences.
However I can now tell you that at our new college, which is well supplied
with computers there are no soundcards or speakers, so no use for this
software.

You might want to request of your college that they consider
installing sound cards and making headphones available.

Graphical interfaces are important, and I was expressing a concern that we
are failing to meet this need.
We currently have no budget, no telephones to hand,
Even if we had soundcards we would need headphones, or earphones.
This would dramatically effect the sessions. Language labs are fantastic, I
was lucky enough to have access to one 30 years ago, but they are very
different to other more collaborative environments.

One of the groups who typically have difficulty with reading is deaf people
who are proficient in signing, but find written languages much harder. And
also find text-to-speech pretty useless...

Jonathan,
Check out http://vinfo.com/scribe.htm. They have a shareware product
called Scribe that runs under DOS and plays sound files through your PC
internal speaker. Everyone has one of those. I have heard it myself and
it's low fidelity, but pretty understandable. Pair that with a (shareware)
text-to-speech toolkit and you could have the low-budget solution you seek.
Not the optimal situation to be sure, but you seem severely constrained as
far as resources.
Hope this helps,

Oops correction. Scribe is not shareware. Pretty cheap, but not free.
Sorry for the confusion.

Jonathan,
If you are in a higher education institution in the UK then students with
disabilities may be entitled to Disabled Students Allowance (DSA):
"What are the Disabled Students' Allowances for?
The DSAs help pay for extra costs you may incur in attending your full-time
course, as a direct result of your disability. The allowances can help with
the cost of a non-medical personal helper, major items of specialist
equipment and other costs. "
In other words, it could be used to provide a student with a suitable PC
with any necessary equipment. In addition, many Universities and colleges
actually
provide specialised equipment for students with disabilities and specialised
areas and rooms so that they can use it without distraction on campus. For
example, here at the University of Dundee we have a lab for Visually
Impaired
Students, and a lab for students with dyslexia:
To bring this back to a web context (which is what this group is
specifically for!). DISinHE believe that it is of vital importance to
persuade UK HE to adopt policies to create accessible and usable web sites.
This should enable all students to get the best experience of the
information contained within a University's web site, no matter what
equipment and software the student uses. I believe your point about "clear
and simple sentences" is currently part of the Web Content Accessibility
Guidelines under guideline 14: Ensure that documents are clear and simple.
To Summarise, Universities or Colleges don't have to provide specific
equipment for disabled students as this can be obtained from the DSA.
However
Universities should (but have no legal obligation to) make sure that its
electronic information is accessible to students with disabilities. The
situation in Further Education is not exactly the same.
Hope this clarifies things.

Hi all,
I'm trying to understand the new OBJECT element in HTML 4.0 as it
relates to accessibility. I've tried it to place an image in IE5 and got
nothing. Anyone know of a source that shows which HTML 4.0 elements are
supported by which browsers? I've seen such for CSS (although all of the
one's I've seen are for CSS1 and not CSS2), but need same for HTML 4.0 and
would be grateful if someone could spare me the time digging.
Thanks,

Karine, have a look at http://www.w3.org/Talks/1999/11/15-WAI-MS/slide5-0
IE 5.0 should handle it properly. etscape 4.x handles object fine for media
types that are not natively rendered, so it doesn't do it for images or text
types, but works for movies. IE 4 puts it in a scrolling box, even if the box
is bigger than the contents. Amaya deals with it fine for image types it
supports - I haven't tried it for other types of content. And I haven't tried
other browsers either. I just tried lynx on that page - it gives access to
the object as (image) when links for all images is turned on. I will play ith
that a little more.
