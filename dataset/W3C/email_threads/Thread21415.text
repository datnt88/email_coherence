Hello,
I'm looking for user studies of annotation systems,
mainly systems meant to allow public annotations a la ThirdVoice when it was still there.
(My own work focused on personal annotations only, with a small support for sharing among a close
community).
I'm looking for research papers mainly, but if you want to share your own experience, it's good too.
Thanks for your help,
Laurent.
Laurent -- We did a number of studies of shared annotation usage with
our early MRAS system and the later CAF system. I believe you can find
all of the papers on my homepage
(http://www.research.microsoft.com/~davemb). Grudin and LeeTiernan also
did a study of the MRAS system which was published at INTERACT (in 2000,
I believe).
I don't know of any studies of commercial systems such as ThirdVoice,
eQuill, etc...let me know if you find any.

Hello Laurent,
I am using PDF documents for the carrying out my user studies targeted at
finding out the kinds of markings that people make on e-documents and the
navigational activities that are undertaken during this interaction. I
intend to publish later this year but let me know if you are interested in
my findings and I could forward you some preliminary data analysis from my
pilot study.
Regards,
Asim.
