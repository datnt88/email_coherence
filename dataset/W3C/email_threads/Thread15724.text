How problematic for accessibility is it to specify font size? I have heard
that doing so may prevent users from specifying their own font size in some
browsers. Is this true? If so, which ones. Thanks for your attention.

All browsers allow the user to set their own default font
and default font size. (Well, not Lynx, and I don't know
about pwWebSpeak -- let's say "all browsers that use fonts
as a means of presentation.")
This includes Navigator, IE, and Opera.
When using fonts, you should (in my opinion) always specify
relative fonts ("-1", "+2") or use stylesheets (which can be
turned off or overridden) rather than absolute font values
such as FONT SIZE="4" or FONT SIZE="2". SMALL and BIG are
also preferable.
Opera is particularly nice when dealing with too-small fonts
(as when some pages abuse really small text to fit menus on
the screen), as each web page window has a pulldown option as
part of the status bar, which allows to to specify a scaling
factor, from 100% (default, unless you change it) to 150% or
200% or more, or down the other way to 80%, 50%, etc.

The problem with fonts is relatively minor, and is greater with CSS,
which allows absolute sizes to be specified eg in points. Although most
browsers allow an over-ride, and Opera beaves especially nicely, it is
related to the problem of setting absolute sizes for an XxY screen and
expecting it to help people if you say 'use a 1500x1200 21" monitor'. It
doesn't. Having to scroll across and down to read pages is a fast way to
render them illegible.
in the guidelines thing it is a p3 (may be done - will improve
accessibility).
