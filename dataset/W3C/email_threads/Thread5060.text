Hi
Here's a scenario in which I mix RDF into an XHTML document. My side project,
FOAF, has a namespace whose URI is http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/ and whose default
representation is an XML document that embeds RDF within an XHTML context.
I chose to embed the RDF (actually RDFS/OWL markup) in the body of the document,
rather than the head, though I wasn't so bothered by that part of the decision.
What I like about this scenario is that the namespace document includes both human
and machine readable documentation about the FOAF vocabulary. Currently, I do this
but it means the document can't be DTD or XML Schema validated.

Awesome, I've added it to [1] and I've tried to assign it as evidence to
various requirements.

In particular:
Is my assessment with respect to scope correct? Is the RDF/XML about the
resources it is within? (Or to ask a hairy question, is the RDF/XML about
the URI that happened to, when resolved, yielded that particular resource?)
I don't follow. Do you mean it can't be validated as XHTML 1.0, or that
somehow it's impossible to create your own composite DOCTYPE/DTD? (If so,
how, I'm missing the connection as two why the human *and* machine readable
description precipitates this.)
Right. Is this related to the TAG issue about RDDL?
