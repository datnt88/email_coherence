Hi Greg,
I build mod_dav-1.0.2-1.3.6 with Apache_1.3.14
I used the ./configure --with-apxs=/usr/local/apache/bin/apxs
make
make install
seems to be o.k.
But when I run start apache I got "Can't load
/usr/local/apache/libexec/libdav.so into server : undefined symbol:
XML_SetElementHandler"
The file libdav.so does exist.
Any body can explain why?
Thanks
PC Wang
Did you build your Apache without Expat in it? If so, then you'll need to
reconfigure mod_dav to use an external Expat library (--with-expat=...)

Hi,
I have some problem building mod_dav into Apache, Looking at the instruction
page it require Expat modules,
But I only find expat-lite coming with Apache_1.3.14. (The instruction says
Expat is included in Apache_1.3.9 or newer version)
Any body know, is "Expat" the same as "expat-lite"? or I need to install
Expat in addition of expat-lite.
Since I don't want to include unnecessary packages.
Thanks

It is the same, and mod_dav will automatically detect it and use it.

The mod_dav did not resolve it.
I finally resolved this by download the expat from the web, rebuild from the
source and copy .h and .so into proper directory.
(I am using Linux 7.0/Apache 1.3.14/with mod_perl-1.25 build with DSO)
My next question is how I am going to test if this is working?
Thanks
