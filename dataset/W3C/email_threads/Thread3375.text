It's a bit grainy - the actual thing won't look like that.
could I have comments by tomorrow please? We need to get this done and
dusted asap or we won't have the cards ready for WWW2003.
cheers

This looks pretty cool to me.
I would say
"Which standards should I use"
and "Where can I *find? meet?* other Semantic Web developers"
but these are trivial and ignorable quibbles.
good job!

Libby -
Looks pretty good. Some assorted minor quibblage:
* (probably) most people in the EC will know what "EC" stands for, but
others quite likely won't
* "Where are other SW developers located?" - might want an "in Europe" in
there somewhere, to acknowledge that there are Other Places in the world (qv
the map discussion)
* is open source really Open Source? :-). Similarly, you use both Semantic
Web and semantic web - would be better to be consistent. I don't have a
strong preference.
* "bridging the gap between semantic web technology and the XML tool stack "
my suggestion: "bridging the gaps between semantic web tools and XML tools"
or even "applying standard XML tools to semantic web problems"
* "... storing and search semantic web data" - s/search/searching/
* "case studies and demonstration applications" - add comma after
applications
* "holding developer workshops " - delete 'holding' ... a workshop is an
activity, I assert :-)
* I'd reorder the second major sentence to emphasise the outcome rather than
the process, something like:
Our goal is to refine and field-test Semantic Web standards, through open
source tool development, community building, outreach and evangelism, and
advanced R&amp;D.
Hope this is not too late.
Cheers,
Ian
me also
i like these
(technically W3C standards are 'recommendations' but i think
'standards' is clearer for the non-W3C-er)
