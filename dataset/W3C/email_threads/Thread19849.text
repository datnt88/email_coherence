Greetings,
Has anybody compiled amaya on AIX 4.1.4 succesfully? Are there
precompiled binaries available?
Thanks,

It's not the way you use your RAM, it's the size of it!
Hello,
The AIX binary distribution does not seem to have the registry file or
.thotrc file.
Running the executable gets the following errors:
$ amaya
exec(): 0509-036 Cannot load program amaya because of the following
errors:

Any suggestions?

The right half of the brain controls the left half of the body.
This means that only left handed people are in their right mind.
The AIX Amaya release has been recompiled using standard X11R5 insread of
X11R6.
The new tar file is already available on http servers and will be available
very soon on ftp servers.

Irene.
