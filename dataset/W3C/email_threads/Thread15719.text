A colleague recently told me that the latest version of Lynx handles
frames. Is that correct? I didn't see any mention of frames on the Lynx
website.
Thanks,

Lynx has handled frames since (I think) version 2.6. It will display
the noframes content and provide a link to each frame. For example,
from URL:http://tnt.turner.com/babylon5/ :
TNT: The Home of Babylon 5
FRAME: [1]nav
FRAME: [2]nav_top
FRAME: [3]meat
FRAME: [4]border_right
FRAME: [5]border_bot
Here, they haven't provided any noframes , and their frames are not
as well-named as they could be. But a user can at least figure out
what's going on and get where they need to.

In tooling around with Lynx last night I did see that it seemed to break
the frames into individual pages. I don't know if this was all lynxssssss
doing or if the page author coded it. Try going to

Yes, Lynx navigates among the frame-contents much as though they
were pages.

to follow up on what Jamie Fox said:
lynx has been listing frames for a while now. you have to go inside the
frame to find out what's in it but if the title of the frame is
descriptive, it can be done easily enough.
PAA colleague recently told me that the latest version of Lynx handles
PAframes. Is that correct? I didn't see any mention of frames on the Lynx

Hi,
An approach I found useful was to include a summary page / index for
all the frames in a frameset. Each frame has an entry in the
index containing:
1. the URL for the frame
2. number of links in the frame
3. number of forms in the frame
4. word info like number of significant words in the frame and list
of top 10 most frequent significant words
This summary usually gives information for a user to know the purpose
of each frame without looking at it. (The choice of types of info
can be under user configuration.)

The way Lynx handles frames makes it evident why FRAME's
title attribute should be used. It allows to give a clear
human understandable link description of each of the
framed pages. with practically no cost to the author.
