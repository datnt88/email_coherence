Have we discussed rough locations (at the level of: UK, East Coast of
US, ...) for future F2F meetings (assuming we won't have wrapped up by
the time we need any more, of course)? I seem to recall some mention of
France, but I can't find a reference (the problem: we're on the US Govt
fiscal year here, which starts in October, and I've got to submit a new
budget).
