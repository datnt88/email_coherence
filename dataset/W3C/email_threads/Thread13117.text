I'm working on the Policy document
(http://www.w3.org/WAI/References/Policy). One of the characteristics of the
document is that there are links to documents in many languages. I'd like
ideas about the best way to indicate the language before the link. Some of
the documents are available in two languages.
My idea is to use the ISO language codes
(http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/IG/ert/iso639.htm) in square brackets [EN][ES]. A
list at the top of the page could explain, or the form abbr
title="English" EN abbr . Although the abbreviation form would have to be
outside the link text (wouldn't it?). But then I don't want to have to
repeat the title for each language version.
[EN] New French Legislation, [FR] New French Legislation.
which repeats the title
[EN] New French Legislation, [FR] La Nouvelle Legislation Francaise.
which looks better, but is really the same
or
[EN][FR]New Legislation in Country
but then the link text doesn't make sense out of context
thanks

Well, I do it something like this:
some text in english _some_link_ ( _aussi_une_version_francaise_ )
if there are the two. You should also use the hreflang attribute (which
reminds me that I should too).
I try to make a version of the sentence in french (or whatever the relevant
language is) which has the opposite
la meme texte en francais _le_lien_ ( _link_to_english_version_ )
In some cases the resource is language-negotiated - for example, if you have
spanish as your preferred language and you go to the page describing what
WCAG conformance logos mean you will get a spanish version. In pages like
that I like to put a direct link to the english version.
I don't think that the ISO language codes are that helpful. I prefer a word
(english) and an icon of a flag or two - I realise that english is spoken in
many countries, but people are well-used to the idea of either an english or
american flag standing for "english version". I don't think I would use an
Australian or New Zealand flag unless the text is specifically localised and
there is a more general english version - New Zealand government documents in
particular contain a high proportion of Maori words that make no sense to
people who don't speak New Zealand english, but too much detail gets
confusing. (Just think of this message as an example of that idea grin/ )

Hi Alan
Maybe the EOWG should discuss how to present the information from the
individual countries? Suggestion: under each country we write the titles in
the original language and present the title in English in [ ] If it's not
available. If there are translations or the country is multilingual we can
link from the titles in the languages the document is available in . For
Example under Denmark there is a link to a report only available in Danish:
Rapport fra Arbejdsgruppen om tilg?ngelighed og grafiske brugergr?nseflader
(Report from a working group on accessibility and graphical user interfaces)
Here we would have to change the bracket to square brackets [ ] but not make
any links as there are no translations available. Another example from the
Danish titles is Action for Change: IT Policy Plan it would look something
like this: Handling gi'r forvandling. IT-politisk handlingsplan 97/98
English translations see: Action for Change: IT Policy Plan . All the coding
regarding language tags etc. naturally have to be correct !

Regarding this paragraph in section 5. "Reduce Legal Liability"
"Furthermore, an increasing number of industry organizations in various
countries are developing accessibility codes of practice or industry
policies. If your organization or company is a member of such an
organization its continuing membership may depend on adopting those practices."
Andrew asks "SHOULD THIS BE MOVED TO SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY (within the
workplace?) OR EVEN TO EFFICIENCY?"
My sense is that, it if it belongs at all, it does belong in Section
5. However I agree that it doesn't seem to jibe with the title or other
content of the section. Section 5 is intended to inform people that they
may be subject to "compliance because of imposed authority" and that
complying will reduce their exposure to legal or other types of official
censure. (Somewhere in the planning or policy suites we tell people to
check whether any local laws, policies etc. apply to them.)
The paragraph in question sticks out because it is like the third example
in a list that is missing the first two examples, for instance:
* For a United States federal government Web site, compliance is the law.
* For a Canadian federal government Web site, compliance is the policy.
* For the site of a member of the Left-handed Widget Industry Association
grin compliance is a condition of membership.
A (possible) problem with the latter example is provability: is anyone
actually aware of any non-governmental organization that requires its
members to comply? If we can prove it to be true, it would be good to have
a link in the "reference for benefits" document under development. If we
can't prove it, maybe the paragraph should just be removed.
In any case, a small change that would make the first sentence of the first
paragraph more universal would be :
"In many countries around the world discrimination laws [and/or policies]
require governments, educational institutes, corporations and businesses to
provide equal opportunities for people with disabilities."
The third sentence would read better as:
"The [requirements] vary from country to country and a listing of country
specific laws and policies is maintained by WAI."
Regards,
Chuck
Maybe we just "modify" the notion of "condition of membership" but on the
whole I will bet that members of such organizations do something akin to
what you do when you scan to the bottom of the "legalese" and check the "I
accept the terms and conditions" box (without actually having read it, you
naughty person!).
Love.
