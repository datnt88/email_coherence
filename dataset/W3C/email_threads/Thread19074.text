Here's my current working version of a rough issues list.
Al
A. Big bad issues
* The top level index page is very hard to find things in.
* There should be a skip-nav link in all pages.
B.? Medium issues
* Search function is hard to use with screen reader because of initial
contents
you are supposed to keep.? Could list address be moved to hidden input?
* The preamble links in the message page to related messages only identify the
target, not the relationship (stated before link).
C.? Other issues
* The regular pattern of navigation links on message pages are a natural
target
for ACCESSKEY.
* The different kinds of sorting are a natural application for icons.
Identifying the date, thread, etc. index pages within those pages and in the
links leading there both from the top level and from the message pages.
* There should be a link from top level archive page to group home page or
equivalent.? Introductory legend linking there could also mention public vs.
confidential status of this information.
* Help for using the archive should be provided.? The "help" link following
the
search form is not clear.? Would expect help for archive, it is help for
search
(this association is indicated by layout).
* In the top level index page, if a table, use TH where appropriate.?
* Messages with un-wrapped text generate very wide pages in PRE.? Left-right
scrolling very hard to use.
* The list formatting for the list of related messages in the prologue on the
message page is broken.? The "next message" link shows up before the UL
opening
the list in the message I happened to copy to edit.
D.? System issues.
[These items are not directly implemented in the hypertext of the mail
archives, but would improve the contribution of the lists and archives as
groupware.]
* "Mail me a fresh copy" function.? Also addresses unwrapped text.
* Hyperlink from message distributed by email to list to archives (self in
archive, probably).
[snip]
Yes, that would be very useful.
Yes, we've asked for that on a number of occasions. There's some
hesitation about including the archive URI in the message itself
whether the systems Team has been thinking about this issue lately.

There is a design constraint that wrappings added by the distribution service
be clearly recognizable as such.
But I have a clear policy line in mind from participating in the list-managers
listserv and working on the infrastructure to serve the lynx
developer-and-user
community that says things like list-added footers can be done in a way which
is an appropriate part of the deal of the group use of the list
distribution as
group infrastructure.
It's not a random email message, it is a submission to a group discussion. If
it comes back with pro-forma value added from the infrastructure, there is no
reason that shouldn't be part of the deal, the bylaws governing group
participation.
There is a strict rule about not corrupting or hiding the originator's
Message-ID: header, which Lyris fell afoul of. But there are plenty of
legitimate ways to make value-added wrappings or annotations part of the
distributed package.
[In low-tech, most-mail-tools-handle-this encodings.]
