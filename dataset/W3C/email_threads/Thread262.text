Hi - new to the list - used Tidy a few times to instamagically clean up
nasty code -- but found the Windows port kinda klunky - the DOS version
was more simple.
*LOVE* the Mac version, btw.
Anyway - if the Tidy gods would have a look at this and point out any
obvious errors or have other suggestions, I'd much appreciate it.
Have a look (temporary URL!)
Thanks for listening,
Joe

How would you like to write a tutorial for the Mac version grin ? A
common complaint is new users don't always figure out on their own how to
use the program. I intend to improve the usability and user interface, and
one day write "real" documentation.
Looks pretty good. A couple of minor grammatical errors. Fortunately the
MS-DOS version of Tidy is pretty simple to use. However people should
really read the Overview.html page you point to, in order to get the best
out of Tidy.
I would suggest perhaps adding the use of I/O redirection, and avoiding the
use of the -m option.
e.g. tidy -i -wrap 400 -upper -f errors.txt foo.html  foo.out

?hm, we are talking here of the Win32 Command line Version of HTML Tidy,
not the MS-DOS Version, this should be corrected.
BTW: http://www.w3.org/People/Raggett/tidy/tidy.exe seems to be the 27.
September Version, not as expected the 2x. October Version.

Yes, I guess you are correct on this one - being a Mac user, I rarely run
MS-DOS applications, and when I do, it is under Windows 9x. So I assume you
can't actually run this version on older configurations running DOS only.
First I think you have the URL wrong - while using the above URL does
indeed download a file (I didn't bother completing the download), it is not
a published URL (that I could find) on the main Tidy page. All the links to
the Win32 Command line version of Tidy, from the main Tidy page are :
Secondly, I downloaded this very file a day or two ago, and it is in fact
the 22 Oct 99 version.

Yes you're right. I think Dave should delete this one (and setup a
redirect to ../tidy.exe).

I think you should explain the configuration file options which are
*much* more extensive. Furthermore you can now access these via the
command line using the --name syntax.
In addition, the binary you link to is for Win95/98/NT/2000.
However for older systems, you should check out the Tidy386
port which is maintained by Nick B, see:
