As a reminder, for those who are interested in following our progress
on the DOM Level 2 HTML draft, have a look at:
I'll reply directly to the commenter in any case.
Regarding i6, i7 and i9, Glenn gave us some feedback on the backward
compatibility with IE3. Here is his authorized forwarded message:
I've looked at the three open issues on the DOM-2 HTML Module, and have the
following comments based on my experience implementing the Spyglass Device
Mosaic 3 DOM, which was based on reverse engineering of IE3 and NN3 behavior
(and having to resolve occasional differences between the two):
*** I6 HTMLFormElement::submit ***
In DM3, the invocation of the submit() method causes the firing of the
ONSUBMIT event prior to performing its intended semantics, and, if the event
returns a value that is equivalent (coercable) to FALSE, then those intended
semantics (form submission) are ignored.
The same held in DM3 for the reset() method, which fired an ONRESET event
(this event was introduced by NN3).
*** I7 HTMLInputElement::size ***
This property was interpreted as an integer by IE3 and DM3, so I see no
problem with changing the IDL definition to a numeric type.
*** I9 HTMLSelectElement::options.length ***
In IE3 and DM3, the object referenced by the options property was definitely
read-only, and did not support changing its length (i.e., number of items). I
believe this feature was introduced in NN3.

I've looked at the three open issues on the DOM-2 HTML Module, and have the

I checked with Netscape 3.0, 4.7, 6.x and with IE5.5, neither of which
fire the onsubmit event when the submit method is called on a form.
*** I7 HTMLInputElement::size ***
This property was interpreted as an integer by IE3 and DM3, so I see no
problem with changing the IDL definition to a numeric type.
No versions of Netscape prior to 6.0 supported the input.size property,
so it seems like this should be changed to a number (it's a string in
Netscape 6.0+, but we can change that in the next release).
*** I9 HTMLSelectElement::options.length ***
In IE3 and DM3, the object referenced by the options property was definitely
read-only, and did not support changing its length (i.e., number of items). I
believe this feature was introduced in NN3.
Both select.length and select.options.length (select === select.options
in versions earlier than 6.0 of Netscape) have been read-write in
Netscape sinze 3.0.

*** I6 HTMLFormElement::submit ***
In DM3, the invocation of the submit() method causes the firing of
the
ONSUBMIT event prior to performing its intended semantics, and, if
the event
returns a value that is equivalent (coercable) to FALSE, then those
intended
semantics (form submission) are ignored.
This would be significantly incompatible with existing scripts, the
submit method is very commonly used in scripts so as to circumvent the
onsubmit event. Existing scripts will break, making many forms
unsubmittable. While backwards compatibility isn't essential, there
needs to be very, very good reasons not to be - this doesn't appear to
have any good reason.
Jim.
