Much of the time the idea of using care in choice of words in our
activities is sort of ridiculed as "politically correct". Since we are
contemplating including details about particular human conditions, I
thought it might be good to read a reasoned explanation about the
importance of our term selection as we undertake this. Take a peek at:

ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE
Thank you, William. This is a really important topic.
And I believe that the definitions that are used in the documents of the WAI
should belong together with those given by the WHO in the ICDIH1 that it is
the one that is at the moment in vigor and when it is appropriate those of
ICIDH2:
For those that can read Spanish, years ago I wrote about the application of
ICDIH1 in the communication, especially in the communication in Internet:

William,
I agree with much of what they say, but wonder how many "retarded" people
will recognize the term "cognitively disabled" as describing themselves.
Mostly, they describe themselves as "not smart", "slow" and sometimes
"special ed" depending on their age. It's a decision whether to apply the
terms people use to describe themselves, or what they are called by others.
And these folks may describe themselves in different words in different
parts of the country/world ... !
