The government's Section 508 web site -- http://www.section508.gov/
-- uses a noscript element. This might be an interesting point of
discussion as to whether or not this is ideal usage.
Here's the content of the noscript :

Great Kynn,
You asked whether or not this is an "ideal usage" of the NOSCRIPT element.
My question was whether there were real life "effective" uses.
I really didn't expect any, and good for you for finding a "real life" use
of NOSCRIPT. This one at http://www.section508.gov, of all places, is
certainly real life and it is effective. What it does is provide text at the
top of the page that in effect says "we use JavaScript for XYZ and since you
don't support JavaScript you are out of lunch as regards XYZ."
I really think that is kind of an ingenious idea. "We're using JavaScript
and you don't get the benefit of it, so TOUGH!"
I guess I would say the instance is certainly not ideal. The prescription
for NOSCRIPT is that authors will provide alternate content when scripting
is not available. This example does not do that because I read "alternate"
do be in some sense equivalent.
Do you agree?

Actually I am not entirely sure it says that. It looks like they
are trying to say "if you had javascript, you'd see x , but since
you don't, we will tell you the content you are missing; in other
words, the content of the popup."
Hmmm. I've seen sites that do that, I don't think this is the case
though. I think they are trying to do it right, even though I think
they don't do it particularly well.
Not really. I think they are well-meaning but they did not consider
overall usability, just accessibility. Surely this does indeed provide
the content in an alternate form; it's just awful clumsy. I think a
better idea would have been for them to provide the same functionality
in a different way; for example, making each link go to the page in
question with a pop-up (as now) if javascript is enabled, and making
it go to an "exit page" if javascript is not enabled. That might
work better than this noscript message, which I honestly would have
put somewhere near the bottom of the page. But at least they allow
you to skip it, I think.

I don't understand how you can say that they are providing "equivalent
content" with their NOSCRIPT tag. The NOSCRIPT content says that when you
leave the site with scripting enabled you will get an alert. You don't get
that alert when scripting is turned off. The scripting content is the alert.
It does NOT provide that "alert" content in alternative form --- or I am
missing what you are trying to say?
Please note, I do not think the site has accessibility problems; my
assertion on this, so far the only real life NOSCRIPT instance, is that
accessibility is NOT improved with the NOSCRIPT content.

Hi David,
There is nothing in the Section 508 Standards that rules out the NOSCRIPT
tag. They have said that if you do depend on JavaScript then that better be
accessible by assistive technology. If you don't depend on JavaScript, i.e.,
if you used NOSCRIPT effectively, then you are home free.
By my accounting I have not yet seen an effective use of JavaScript,
effective in the sense of providing content that replaces and is (in some
sense) equivalent to what the script would provide.

This is where I think we are having some problems in communication.
The noscript element's content contains the following:
All external links to federal sites include an exit Java Script pop-up
disclaimer that includes the following language. "You are now leaving the
Section 508 website. Thank you for visiting our site. We welcome your
comments on how we can make our site more useful."
The "information" ("content") being conveyed is the thankyou and
the invitation for comments. One way they are conveying it is with
a pop-up when you leave the site. Another way to convey that
information is to tell you "you would see a pop-up, but since you
can't, here's what it would say."
So the Section508 site _is_ providing the information. It's
just not providing it in a very clever or usable way.
If I were creating multiple edaptations for this site -- and for
this example we'll only concern ourselves with two, one for
javascript enabled and one for non-javascript -- I would take the
following approach instead:
(1) Eliminate noscript (which means it would no longer fit your
request for an example! this is the point of edaptive web
sites, to eliminate fall-throughs when possible)
(2) Make the javascript version function as it does now
(3) Make the non-javascript version redirect to a server-side
script, rewriting outside URLs like this:
(4) Write a script (/cgi-bin/leaving) that forms a page like this:
You are now leaving the Section 508 website. Thank you for
visiting our site. All your base are belong to us. We
welcome your comments on how we can make our site more useful.
That way you don't -have- to use a noscript , and yet you still get
the same -effect- of a pop-up: the "goodbye" message appears whenever
ANYONE leaves the site.
Which means that I haven't really provided you with a good noscript
use example? Damn, I suck, I'll have to work on that later. For now
I am behind on my Reef work. ;)

The Australian Open Tennis Championship's website - http://www.ausopen.com.au
- used noscript to provide access to various features of the site. This may
have been a response to the findings of the Human Rights and Equal
opportunity Commission in a complaint about the Sydney Olympic Games Website,
which required Javascript in order to get to certain parts of the site.
(Originally to get to any of it, but that was changed very early on).
My view is that this (and several similar exercises) did improve the
accessibility of the Website.
In the example discussed below, they are providing the content that would
have been delivered via a javascript, when there is no active javascript
interpreter. (And they are explaining that why it comes in diffferent forms
on diferent viewings of the site is becuase javascript is not active in some
cases - also helpful.) So I think they are providing accessibility - access
to the content for people who do not have javascript enabled, for example
becuase their browser does not support it, or because (as with a number of
people) it interferes with orientation and they leave it off by default.

ABSOLUTELY NOT. The content is in the act of leaving the site -- you get a
warning that you are leaving the site. No NOSCRIPT element will provide
that. I cannot understand how you and Kynn could miss this point!! We must
be talking in opposite directions on different subjects.
The whole reason that the Access Board took the approach it did on scripting
was that scripting was necessary to provide alerts REQUIRED by the standards
(timed responses, for example). Alerts, not unlike the one explained by the
NOSCRIPT at http://www.section508.gov, can not, repeat, CAN NOT, be provided
when scripts are turned off.
The NOSCRIPT does not replace and is not equivalent to the alerts! Did you
think the NOSCRIPT content appeared when the alert should appear? It does
not. It appears when the page is loaded.

It's not absolutely inaccessible, but it is certainly, in my view, a
hindrance to accessiblity and given that most of the home page seems to
be given over to this lawyer's notice, and given its prominent position
(certainly not natural linearised reading order) may well stop some people
in their tracks, thinking it is yet another "please upgrade" web site;
I certainly got that sort of reaction the first time I accessed the site
in IE with Javascript off. When I was considering sending a reference
to Section 508 to a blind Lynx user, I would have had to give a warning
that that notice did not reflect on the real content of the site.
It (and the popups) are examples of lawyers getting out of control. I'd
put it in a similar class to the ten or so line signatures that people
send to public lists saying that it is a dire offence if the reader
isn't the intended recipient (anything sent to a public list is either
in breach of confidence or intended for everyone in the universe!). They
represent hindrances to the normal operation of the medium just because
there is no formal law that corresponds to common sense interpretations
of the nature of email and web site links.
It's getting rarer and rarer for sites to be part of *the* web, but when
those that are still connected to the web only do so reluctantly, I'd
say the web was dying.
Maybe someone should propose an HTML element (or meta keyword) for
a list of URL prefixes that represent URL prefixes that are within
the control of the site, so that browser can generate warnings
automatically.

Something I've done before but can't find any examples of is as
follows (most of the code is commented pseudo-code in a place where
you can't really have a comment, but you should get what I mean).
!--
if (document.all){//IE4+ object model available
document.write('/*HTML code for dynamic menu using IE4 object
model*/')
elseif (document.layers){//NS4+ object model available
document.write('/*HTML code for dynamic menu using NS4 object
model*/')
else{//script is available, but neither of the object models used
for the menus
document.write('/*HTML code for non-dynamic menu*/')
//--
Now there are still some possible issues with this (i.e. those issues
with screen readers based around browsers that can interpret dynamic
menus, but not necessarily well) lets for the sake of argument assume
my dynamic code is perfect in this regard - though I admit I doubt it
was - and you have noscript giving you a real alternative.
If I find a full example from real life in the next few days (I know
I've written at least one somewhere) I'll let you know.
One comment:
In much of my uses of javascript I have been able to provide an
alternative not with noscript, but with how I use the event handlers.
Commonly you have a link that activates a script when clicked, it is
often easy to make this degrade as such:
a href="noscriptalternativeofjavascript.html"
onclick="activateFuntion();return false;"
in which case the return false stops the href of the link being
activated if script is available, but not if it isn't. Similarly:
In this case activateFunction returns true if it can't fulfil it's
function (say an object it needs is unavailable on the browser),
causing the link to go to the alternative html page. It returns false
if it fulfils its function. Browsers without script will go to the
page.

Yes - thought it is embarassing to say they've removed it since my last
visit. You might have to trust me on my word  :)
Ericsson used to have a nice 'drop-down' menu on their pages, with which
you could choose a particular area on which to get more information. It
was implemented as a SELECT, and a small javascript was used to send the
user to the desired place.
A NOSCRIPT element was also included, containing a simple
The page worked beautifully JS and non JS browsers, as far as I could
tell. With the inclusion of the SUBMIT type, the structure would also have
been preserved for any UA which know how to deal with forms.
'Effective' - atleast in my book. I am sad to see that they've removed it;
and ever sadder to see that they have completely misunderstood the meaning
of ALT.

Excellent. Your adaptation I consider "equivalent". This emphasizes again the importance of not focusing on the use of this or that tag
but rather on making sure the overall effect is equivalent.

Yeah, unfortunately edapating an equivalent "effect" is much more
art than science; it's harder to distill exactly what you need to
do into a set of rules. And of course you have to have appropriate
technical support for any sort of changes you want to make, AND
you have to understand usability, AND you have to have a knowledge
of what I sometimes disparagingly (but still lovingly!) call "tag
trivia", and you have to be a good interface designer.
I myself am only good at a few of those, which is why I can talk
a good fight but I have to hire UI designers and programmers if I
need a great user interface! :)

ACCESSIBILITY IS DYNAMIC. TAKE CONTROL.
(Quoting Chaalz above.)
No, that's the context of the content. Technically they are
delivering the content, by pre-warning you before you ever leave
the site.
It's the difference between a disclaimer and a pop-up; both are
ways of delivering the information.
Let's say that you go to a museum. When you leave the doors, a
recorded voice says, "thank you for visiting! we welcome you to
return whenever you like." The recorded voice is inaccessible to
people who can't hear, clearly.
Instead of putting up signs, for some reason they choose to
hand out a sheet of paper at the front door which says "if you
leave, keep this in mind: thank you for visiting! we welcome you
to return whenever you like."
They have met their requirement to -provide information-. There
is not a requirement to provide information -in an acceptable
context-, at least, not in the section 508 regs and not, I don't
think, explicitly in WCAG 1.0 either.
Is this acceptable? Well, it depends on how you are looking at
the problem. If you look at it as "how can I use exit pop-ups and
still meet Section 508 (or WCAG)", then I think it "passes". If
you look at it in terms of providing equal access to information,
it barely passes. If you look at it in terms of providing an
optimal user interface for each user (the goal of edaptation),
then this fails, because the user experience for a user without
access to scripts is demonstrably "weaker" than that of a user
with access to scripts.
So, it meets the "letter of the law" but to my mind it fails to
perform acceptably.
This is why I have always explained to people that my company's
goal is not simply _making information accessible_, which you
can do relatively easily, but rather about _providing an ideal
user experience_ which goes beyond mere access to information
and incorporates usability and UI design.

ACCESSIBILITY IS DYNAMIC. TAKE CONTROL.
It's probably not that useful for people with a primary concern for
accessibility, but it does allow accessibility features to be completely
hidden from those people who do have scripting on, which may mean that they
get past marketing department concerns that they spoil the look of the
page.
Unfortunately, they also hide them from other maintainers of the page,
and if used in this way, may well be introduced by a member of the team
who has a personal interest in accessibility, rather than as policy, so
may decay rapidly once maintenance shifts to another person.
