I have seen the HTTP-NG page, but it is my understanding that there is some
provisional specifics called HTTP-1.1 . Are both the same thing? Otherwise,
where should I find docs for the latter?
ciao, .mau.
They are not the same thing. HTTP/1.1 is what is being called the set
of extensions to the HTTP/1.0 protocol which are known to be desirable
for HTTP1 applications but cannot be implemented properly without some
indication that both sides understand the extension. Some of these
extensions are already listed in the published 1.0 draft -- they will
be split off into a separate specification for the next draft.
NOTE: these are protocol extensions, not server-feature extensions.

HTTP-NG and HTTP 1.1 are different;
HTTP 1.1 is a collection of minor modifications to HTTP 1.0 that are
mostly backwards compatible, but which are too major to make into into the
HTTP 1.0 spec.
HTTP-NG is rather more distant from HTTP 1.0 in syntax; it is a binary
protocol designed for higher performance and better integration with
security and payment schemes. A more detailed draft of HTTP-NG is currently
under preparation for Danvers (Dave Raggett will be translating from
Simonese to English).
