One issue I'd like to raise - and maybe it shouldn't emane from the
WAI but as a direct input to the HTML-WG - is the issue of overloaded
HTML attributes, 'class' in particular.
For instance, if one wants to declare a TABLE as being both of
class=record and class=cost, it's impossible, since SGML only allows
for one attribute setting (someone told me that someday, correct and
ignore this message if this isn't true).
As a result, CSS cannot specify different presentation properties for
both 'record' and 'cost' classes of table.
My suggestion would be to extend the class syntax to allow for a
comma-separated list of values: class="record, cost" and have the user
agent parse it accordingly.
The wording in CSS would beed to be extended to understand this list
of values of course.
Comments.
to follow up on what Daniel Dardailler said:
CLASS takes a list already:
The global structure of an HTML document (p27 of 39
class = [180]cdata-list
This attribute assigns a class or set of classes to a specific
instance of an element. Any number of elements may be assigned
the same class name or names. They must be separated by white
space characters.

Now, the fact that AXIS doesn't do the same _is_ a bug.
On one side I'm proud to have though about the feature without
any further knowledge of it, on the other I feel stupid not having
read the spec more thoroughly. Oh well.
