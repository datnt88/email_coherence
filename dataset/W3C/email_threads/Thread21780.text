For an explanation of why it needs to be in the language, see
Of course, what you consider to be "the language" is a matter of
choice. But if it isn't in RDF Core, then it *must* be in something else
that is effectively acting as "the language" that different writers are using.

Yes, exactly.
Without that, we're left with only the tedious and error prone
rdfs:isDefinedBy and owl:imports. If that's all you have, there's
absolutely no reason to use http URIs. This is why I proposed tag
URIs, to make this clear. In fact, tag URIs suck -- because you can't
click on them.

I'm not convinced... I think this discussion has moved from what is
technically essential in the RDF core to what is desirable practice. I am
prepared to accept that there are desirable practices here, but see that as
a separate discussion.
