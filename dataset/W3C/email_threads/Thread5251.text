Here is another subtitle format called Mplayer's.
Mplayer's format for subtitles is called "MPsub"[1]. It is very
minimalistic (but I think that is good) and similar to the Quicktime
format, "QText"[2]. After a very quick comparison, the difference seems
to be:
1. For each line, MPsub gives the start and duration, QText only
gives the start. To remove the text from the screen, just
display an empty line. (QText's approach seems easier, with less
chance of error.)
2. There are no options or attributes in MPsub, while QText has a
small set of declarations to choose font, font size, color and a
few similar things.
3. Qtext allows clickable text (one of the attributes of a text
line can be a URL).
It seems that the two formats could be easily merged. The structure is
the same, there is just some minor difference in punctuation. (I would
propose to use the CSS property names, rather than the QText ones,
though: 'fontstyle' - 'font-style', 'justify' - 'text-align', 'size'
- 'font-size', etc.)

In which way do you think that having to wait for an empty line to come to erase
the text is easier and safer? I would tend to think that those two lines might
be split into two AUs, and that if for some reason the second one were dropped
(which isn't all that unlikely in a number of streaming transports, especially
unidirectional ones) the text might linger there forever (well, until another
line comes which could be immediately or in a long time).
I would see no reason not to be able to support both duration and overwrite
approaches though, it should be simple enough.

I interpreted this as "allowing implied durations might be a useful
feature", and it seems like it would be.
