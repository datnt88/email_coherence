Since W3C pubrules [1] now require that *all* headers have an anchor,
I patched xmlspec.xsl to add a name="" to all headers that did not
have one already. That is:

Hi Max.
Could you re-patch it to add an id attribute?
cheers

Hmm. That's somewhat more of a pain to fix, since none of the headers
in the stylesheet have id ttributes. Oh well, that'll keep my mind off
this week's publications for a little while. (A few minutes later)
Here goes:
I'll let Norm include it in the repository if it appears to work.

/ Max Froumentin mf@w3.org was heard to say:
I made a slightly different set of patches and checked them in.
(Mostly I made sure that the default names weren't in conflict with
existing ID values in the source document and I made the anchors
empty.)
I also created an XHTML version of the stylesheet. Or rather, the
stylesheet that produces the XHTML version. It works, but I haven't
examined the extent to which it produces valid XHTML.
Be seeing you,
norm
