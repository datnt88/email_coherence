Hi all
What error response is the WebDAV server supposed to send if it receives an UNLOCK request on a resource which is not locked in the first place?
Is it it 403- forbidden or method failed or something else?

We use 412 Precondition Failed, which seems to be appropriate because
having a lock is a precondition to being able to unlock.
Any objections to adding that in RFC2518bis?

place?
This is a good error code to use in this case.
