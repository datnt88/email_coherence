Attached find records of our teleconference this morning
in the following forms
-- XHTML generated via XSLT from HTML
-- RDF/n3 written by hand using notes from the IRC log
-- RDF/XML produced by some pythong code from RDF/n3
-- raw IRC log
These have note been reviewed by the participants except
in the case of folks that were paying attention to the IRC
channel while the log was being produced.

09:20:42 ArtB DaveB's follow-up wrt ns-prefix-confusion: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2001May/0184.html
09:22:03 DanC Connolly: re 1. The current RDF/XML syntax ..., I don't see how it fixes the spec, and it doesn't contain test cases.
09:22:56 DanC RESOLVED: 1. The current RDF/XML syntax uses ...
09:23:17 DanC RESOLVED: 2. 2. The grammar will be corrected to require namespace-qualification ...
09:23:59 dajobe-bwm Backward Compatibility: Whilst non-prefixed attribues are no longer part of the RDF language, there may be legacy RDF which contains non prefixed attributes. An RDF processor MAY continue to accept these. One way to accomplish this is to use XSLT, as in for example ..., to transform the legacy RDF into correct RDF. Alternatively, a processor MAY accept non-prefixed attributes from the list directly.
09:24:41 *em notes someone needs to mute... difficult to hear
09:24:47 *ArtB is heaing *tons of static*
09:24:55 *em someone on cell phone?
09:28:59 DanC Connolly: so the language doesn't contain these documents. Good. that's clear.
09:29:26 DanC Connolly: licensing processors to accept documents that aren't in the language is risky... the user community learns what the language is by what the tools do.
09:32:15 DanC [... scribe is discussing too much to do a good job recording; help? ]
09:33:47 DanC EricM: there's a requirement for syntactic inclusion in HTML.
09:34:15 DanC BillD: I think we need to fix productions 4, 5, and 9
09:34:41 DanC DaveB: I listed a bunch of productions in item2 of the proposal...
09:36:22 DanC BillD: let's make it clear that folks MUST NOT use unprefixed resource/about/.. attrs.
09:38:13 *em notes that he may have overstated earlier requirements as there is no specified requirement of syntactic inclusion in M&amp;S Specification.
09:38:14 DanC let's remove 3, 4, 5 [several]
09:38:41 DanC RESOLVED: to remove 3, 4, 5
09:38:52 *em checking rdf m&amp;s working group page in an attempt to remind himself of this requirement request
09:40:01 DanC RESOLVED: 6. The grammar will be corrected to allow non-prefixed [corrected] ...
09:42:04 DanC item 7 is withdrawn; change is incorporated into item 2.
09:42:39 DanC ArtB: so you're changing production 6.19 so that the prefix is not optional?
09:42:45 DanC yes.
09:43:07 DanC i.e. DaveB: yes.
09:44:10 DanC ArtB: do folks realize there might be a lot of RDF out there in this form?
09:44:14 DanC several: yes.
09:46:34 DanC BillD: this looks like an erratum then; the grammar had a typo.
09:47:38 DanC EriCM: let's note this in both places: the errata and the developers page.
09:48:44 DanC BrianM: "namespace prefixed" should become "namespace qualified" several times in the spec.
09:48:44 *em notes that syntacitic inclusion was an early requirement from PICS ... and wonders if this is no longer a requirement
09:49:28 DanC "prefixed" doesn't occur in the spec.
09:51:58 DanC DaveB: I have 7 tests.
09:54:20 ArtB A12: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2001May/0178.html

09:58:58 DanC jang: we have an evolving convention for test case input; I have a suggestion for "expected results" format. that I intend to send.
09:59:23 DanC ACTION JanG: propose expected results format.

This is, of course, another Semantic Web Advanced Development
LEAD* hack; i.e. an installment in "a day in the life of the
Semantic Web." The meeting record tools (RDF schema,
XSLT transformation to XHTML, etc.) that I'm developing are
available at
Massimo did some related work in the context of XML Query...
(Member-Confidential as of this writing)
Massimo, any particular reason why the XDM materials
shouldn't be public? not the meeting records themselves,
but just the XDM tools and docs?
*LEAD = Live Early Adoption and Demonstration

I was there, but fairly quiet. I made a note in IRC
following the roll call.

I think Frank Manola has done an excellent job of summarizing and reporting
the broad thrust of RDF-logic discussion [1] -- it is a subtle many-faceted
debate, so I think any summary will omit some point of debate.
Rather than try refine that summary, and partly in response to DanBri's
comments, I have tried to pick up the ball by posting a list, for
discussion, of goals that reification is purported to achieve or support [2].
Is more required on this specific action point?

The minutes of the 25'th record me as missing, I sent in "probable regrets"
on
the 21'st.

Ron,
Yes you did:
My fault - email overload. My appologies.

Mmm, at that moment in time it started w3c-confidential as
normal default procedure. Now, well, there's in fact no reason for it
to stay so, apart from the fact that if it were to be publicly released,
I'd change a couple of small things that could be improved
(using XDM in the working group has been a very good testbench
to stress things that worked well in it, and things that could have been
slightly changed).
This was on my todo's as a use case for the swad (later in the pile,
after the processing tools...), but if there's interest it could be put
earlier ;)

ps BTW, very interesting esp. also comparing XDM with Dan's new RDF tool.
I may have misspoke, but it was my intention to say that DaveB's proposal
should be couched in terms of 'namespace qualified' rather than 'namespace
prefixed'.
