From what I've seen, a lot of folks are concerned about using the HTTP
scheme for namespaces because they don't want their web servers
overloaded.
Even after explaining the concept of URL-as-name, describing HTTP's
proxy features, and using Akamai as an example, I haven't yet seen
anybody swayed by this argument.
That doesn't explain DAV though.

Why would their web servers be overloaded?

Didn't you hear, Aaron? An HTTP URL has to be resolved before any
meaning can be associated with it. 8-)
The assumption may stem from the fact that validating XML parsers have
to run off to get the DTD to build the infoset. Though that's a problem
with DTDs and not URLs, I've heard that given as a reason for not using
URLs as public ids.
