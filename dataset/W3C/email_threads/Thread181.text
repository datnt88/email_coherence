Tidy still has a problem with "quote-ampersand". Given
I work for AT&amp;T, not AT&amp;amp;T
and
quote-ampersand: yes
Tidy does this:
I work for AT&amp;mp;T, not AT&amp;mp;T
(setting "quote-ampersand" to "no" leaves the original as is).

That's because the 2 Jul 99 version still has the same bug as the 26 Jun 99
version, as discovered by various people.
Rick Jelliffe provided the fix in :
Insert
AddC('a', linelen++);
after line 315 of the file pprint.c
I have made the change in my copy of the source - hope Dave does in his
next version.

AddC('a', linelen++);
after line 315 of the file pprint.c
Ditto. I have problems with my install of Cygnus-Win compiling Tidy; I suppose
I should install a more up-to-date version.

Darn - I wish I had spotted this earlier! The fix is to insert:
AddC('a', linelen++);
at line 317 in pprint.c.
I will post a new release asap to fix this.
Apologies all round.
