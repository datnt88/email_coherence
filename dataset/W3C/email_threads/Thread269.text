There are at least two flavors of Tidy for Linux (i.e. the Tidy RPM Package
for "Redhat", maintained by Dimitri Papadopoulos and the Tidy on "FreeBSD",
maintained by Martin Fouts).
Are these releases of Tidy generic or interchangeable, among the different
Linux operating systems?
If so, then could one either of these be setup on, say Caldera or SuSE?
If not, what are the differences and is there a Tidy for Caldera or SuSE?
Cheers,
James

Just download the source code. It compiles easily (at least on my ancient
Slackware setup). I just got tidy24nov99.tgz, typed:
tar zxvf tidy24nov99.tgz to untar and unzip it, then cd'd to the directory
tidy24nov99 and typed "make". That quickly produced the executable, which
works fine.
