Here is a document I have been working on for some time (before WCAG 2.0)
The goal was to create a one page summary of access principles and
approaches.
It is not limited to WEB. It is intended to be broader in nature. You
will note the parallel with WCAG 2.0 though.
It is passed on for general interest - and for any comments or thoughts.
It is very much an work in progress. Looking forward to your comments.

GV:: "Make all information...perceivable"
WL: After all these years and reams of discussions I only rue that we need
to explain this fundamental in such excruciating detail.
It is because we (humankind) have always reacted to "differences" rather
than embracing inclusion.
There's a DRM T-shirt inscribed "The Only Difference is the Difference" but
lack of general appreciation of our mutual "sibling-hoodedness"
necessitates almost endless discussions about the details that underlie
affirming our membership in one another.
So some of us continue to try to make our output simple as others insist on
not making it too simple - and we will continue/overcome/triumph/+.
My comment is that we are clearly on same/similar tracks and have been for
a while. Gregg's table is a useful piece of the game.
Love.
ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE
Greg,
From first study, it looks like a very comprehensive document. I would
suggest one addition (which may need to be restated elsewhere. In the first
table, under "How - General" you say:
FOR INFORMATION:
Make all information available either in
a) presentation independent form (e.g., electronic text) that can be
presented (rendered) in any sensory form (e.g. visual-print,
auditory-speech, tactile-braille)
The presentation needs to be rendered in both visual-print and
visual-graphics to cover both needs of visual people. It's good to add
these users to the list of Who, but they need a corresponding How.
