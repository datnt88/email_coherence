Hi,
there was an outstanding issue to replace MKRESOURCE by a less generic
method that only creates redirects and does not overlap with PROPPATCH.
This was added in the current edits at
http://greenbytes.de/tech/webdav/draft-ietf-webdav-redirectref-protocol-latest.html#METHOD_MKREDIRECTREF .
The following issues remain:
- missing ability to update the target without having to delete and
re-create the redirect resource (proposal: just add UPDATEREDIRECTREF)
- missing ability to create specific redirect types (such as those
generating a 301 rather than a 302)
Regards, Julian
I would suggest that we resolve these issues as follows:
- allow PROPPATCH to update the DAV:reftarget property
- have an additional property that specifies the status that
will be returned, e.g. DAV:redirectref-status
that has an integer value of either 301 or 302.
Cheers,
Geoff

That does seem simpler to me, if we *do* in fact need both 301-style and
302-style. I recall the explanation that HTTP supports both, but that
doesn't
prove that WebDAV needs to create both. Are both equally prevalent on the
Web?

I don't know whether they are equally prevalent, but I certainly
see many examples of each (and know of web-indexing programs that
act differently depending on which it sees).
Cheers,
Geoff

Historically, people wanted the spec to be independant of WebDAV, so
they wouldn't need full PROPPATCH support for the updated. However, that
was over three years ago. So yes, unless somebody pushes back, making
these PROPPATCHable would work to.
Sounds good.
Thanks for the feedback,
Julian
