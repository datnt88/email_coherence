Hello, all -
I find the current version of Financial Factors hard to access. So, here's
my two cents. Rewrites include:
1. Removing redundant content and multiple ideas in one paragraph.
2. Attempting to group like ideas together.
3. Improving flow.
4. Changing bolding to focus on headers.
5. Removing confusing structure. The document is hard to scan, and the
structure is not truly hierarchal:
- Inconsistent use of bullets and definition lists.
- The bullets and definition list indentations are different,
creating visual hierarchy confusion.
- Misuse of definition list for formatting and not structure. (In
particular, JAWS tells users they've reached a definition list and the
number of items in the list, which is confusing as the information is not
words or concepts with their respective definitions.)
I may have unintentionally omitted content.
Attached is a zip file with the revised HTML version. I've also included my
Word working copy, which tracks all changes.
If we can't make this document clear and easy to read, people won't read it!
Regards,

Blossom said (and Shawn similarly) under Increased Web Usage: "non-profit
organization can receive more donations" - I think this is misleading. It
suggests that donations are the prime reason for NGOs &amp; non-profits to have
a web presence. In actual fact most of these organisations have web
presences in order to spread their message better. So the emphasis should
be to reach more supporters (rather than donors).

Here is what I had sent to the list on Oct 23 for your consideration.
Quantifying Benefits:
Measuring impact on revenues, customer / audience reach, goodwill
It will be very helpful to track website statistics that reveal :
- number of hits on account of improved "searchability" of the website,
- average time a visitor remains on the site
- number of pages he / she visits
- number of transactions successfully completed over the website,
- number of cusstomers prefering to access support related content on the website, and
- number of customers returning to the website to access content / conduct transactions.
The above indicators are likely to register a change over time.
Surveys and customer feedback too will be useful in estimating the increased number of computer access technology users / people with disabilities / senior citizens that the website is attracting on account of improved website accessibility. The increased diversity of the user population might be quite visible in some cases (for e.g. program registrants, job applicants, etc). Admittedly, this number may not be very accurate when the user of the website chooses not to reveal such information. Therefore, in some cases it may not be easy to isolate and precisely quantify the impact of an accessible website on the revenues, audience reach, market share and goodwill.
