Is there some reason that within the Windows Amaya 3.2
package, the menu language is not consistent with
Windows standards....... for example:
[1] shortcut keys are given in lower instead of upper case
[2] the + sign is not there
for example Print Alt+P is standard nomenclature
Print Alt p is Amaya .....
Also since there is no such thing as a return key on
standard keyboards the shortcut for br element
should be Ctrl+Enter !!!!

We would like to take into account the shift. So Ctrl p is different
than Ctrl P
I don't remember why we use Return intead of Enter. If that term hurts you
we can change.

Because both keys exist on (at least) the Sun (type 5, I think) keyboard?
