Wonderful news.
I have only two questions, if I may.
1 - Why are there 14 validation errors on the GAWDs front page ?
2 - When they say, quote, "completed an approved Accessible Web
Design course."; which courses are approved, and by whom ?
Thankyou.

Design course."; which courses are approved, and by whom ?
I also have two questions.
Has anyone proofread the pages to pick up errors such as :
Validate you site http://valet.gawds.org/ | and 5. GAWDS.org believes that 'accessible web design is good for business"; both for designers/developers, and for clients looking to build new websites, or improve existing websites.
And why does it fail the Cynthia test with
11.2 Avoid deprecated features of W3C technologies.
Rule: 11.2.1 - Identify the use of one or more deprecated elements or attributes within the document.
Failure - Document uses one or more deprecated elements or attributes. The document contains the element: body with the deprecated attribute: bgcolor
This, unfortunately, does not inspire me with confidence.

Hi John,
Thanks for checking out the site. At the moment the markup validates agains
the chosen DOCTYPE (although the DOCTYPE used will probably change shortly,
as this is an area of heated debate), and for those who will be checking it
against Bobby it is AAA approved (although that doesn't mean it is
definately accessible).
Unfortunately I did introduce a few HTML errors when adding the news to the
home page about the launch - but these have now been fixed. All comments are
of course welcome; please e-mail any typos, or errors you find on the site
directly to me, and I will try to get them fixed.
This website design is really just a draft - so please don't be too critical
of it; I know it isn't a fantastic design. Please join the Guild and make
your talents available so that we can have a website that reflects the
aspirations of the organisation. It is a membership organisation - and will
will stand or fall on the enthusiasm, skills and commitment of the members.
In relation to the design, the intention is to (very soon) have an open
competition to create a design that reflects the message of the Guild. The
design as it stands at the moment will be replaced within the next couple of
weeks with an alternative (though still temporary) design that a current
member is putting together now.
There is no need to stand on the sidelines explaining why you think it is
not good - please join, sort out the problems as you see them, and help to
ensure that we raise each others skills and end up with more websites that
are accessible.
You can join from this page:
All the best,
Jim

When I saw this invitation I felt pleased that at last Accessible Web
Design may find a new forum and voice however my joy turned to
disappointment very quickly.
To me Accessible Web Design must focus on the users and this group
apears to be be relegating them to a very minor place. Accessibility is
not a technical issue it is a people issue and it appears that the focus
on people has been lost.
An indication to this is the reference to "the disabled."
Whilst when I am referred to as the disabled by most people I do not
object as this is just ignorance however when an organisation purporting
to be professional refers to people with disabilities in this manner I
do as professionals should know that such references are offensive to
many.
I have great respect for the technical abilities of those who appear to
be connected with this organisation however this site has led me to
question the focus, making websites useable to people or performing an
set of rituals in design regardless of the result.
I hope I read this page wrong. I fear I did not.

Hi Harry,
You will be happy to know that your concerns are shared by many of the
current members of the Guild - and that participation by disabled people,
and user testing, has certainly been on the agenda, and is still on the
agenda. I would encourage you to join - as your thoughts and contribution to
the development of the Guild will be greatly appreciated.
Where on the site is the phrase 'the disabled'? As someone who is very aware
of the 'social model of disability', it is a phrase I am unlikely to have
used myself.
What the Guild is, or what it stands for, is not summed up by the few
remarks that I have written on the home page of the site - if you have a
look at the discussion forum at http://www.accessifyforum.com/forum15/, you
will see that all of the issues related to accessible web design, and the
Guild are hotly debated.
The Guild of Accessible Web Designers is not a private organisation that
dictates to its members what to think - the membership is the organisation.
Please join so that you can be sure that it really does address the concerns
you have.
The membership form can be found here:
All the best,
Jim

Pat,
I don't suppose you can tell me any info on approved Accessible Web Design
courses.
They are mentioned on the GAWDS.org web.
I was naively unaware that they existed and would be very interested in any
info your have on them...
Cheers
Ben
Ben,
The use of the phrase 'approved' - is a little misleading - as we are not
thinking of any particular course, and are not aware of any approved
courses. It is there as an 'aspiration'; the Guild may want to develop a
course of its own in the future, or may be a good organization to 'accredit'
existing courses. All of this is up for debate.
Whether the Guild is in a position to accredit other courses, will of depend
on whether it is seen as being a credible organization itself - and that
will depend on the how it develops, and who the members are - among other
things
All the best,
Jim

I must agree with Harry. On Thursday last I gave a talk to the BCS in Preston on the rteasons for and ways of making accessible. The after talk discussion (continued in the pub) tried to find a better word for 'accessible'. We tries 'usable' but that needs qualification. My premise is that if you design to standards, no layout tables, no frames, no proprietary code, validate both your code and CSS in other words follow the specs you get accessible sites - and these sites work on devices for the 'disabled' and for mobile computing, pervasive computing, webTV and all that sort of thing.
For instance thin about an Internet enables car - you talk to a computer and ask a question about road traffic conditions - the web page then speaks back to you the answers. Cloud Cuckoo Land? Maybe not, think about how you could verbally ask for road traffic reports from acomputer and not have to wait for the radio - for me I'm usually alerted just when I've passed the last turn off I could have taken to escape the problem. This type of page is also accessible.
I just wonder if setting up a separate organisation calling itself 'accessible' is the right way to go - there should really be no discrimination in the first place. We have to concentrate on the user's requirements, no matter what they are, which browsing device they are using, where they are - I really do think that 'accessible' has become a convenient watchword for a certain way of testing (not working) and has lost the emphasis on 'design for all' (don;t like the phrase, but it's the best i can come up with at the time)
My qualifications? I teach web programming to first year BSc students (among other things) and have succeeded in making them code in XHTML and CSS2 from day 1. After 10 weeks I'm getting a web page assignment set that's valid, accessible, attractive, cross-browsing device - everything you need. I don't tell them it's accessible or any other artificial title - just that this is the way that they have to design web pages. They have stylesheet switching to change colours and type size, they have stylesheets that cascade via @import staements, they have done very well indeed. And thihs is first years!

"My premise is that if you design to standards, no layout tables, no frames, no
proprietary code, validate both your code and CSS in other words follow the
specs you get accessible sites"
I'd make a slight distinction and say you get "technically" accessible sites.
Rote mastery of the spec will still not force you to write meaningful, appropriate
alt attributes, text transcripts of audio files, captions/descriptions/subtitles.
It will, however, keep you from using deprecated/perverted markup
constructs that can and will cause accessibility (and cross-browser/platform)
issues.
IMHO, anyway

My understanding is that terms like "Universal Design," "Universal
Access," "Access for All," and "Barrier Free" can all be used
synonomously with "Accessibility for people's with Disabilities."
Unfortunately, they can also be used to mean different things. In Hong
Kong, for example, "Barrier Free" and "Access for All" refer NOT to
Accessibility for People with Disabilities - they refer to an effort to
get all economic classes of people, and differently-educated people into
the world of Technology - in other words, these phrases are being used
for "The Technological Divide." "Universal Design," from a Usability
worldview, is probably more of a superset that includes usability for
people's with disabilities, but is not restricted to those users.
George - anything you can add?
