OK, so I haven't read every piece of mail on this list ...
Can someone answer this simple question:
If I make a request for a page with a Cookie header, is the result
cacheable in a public cache ?
e.g. I pick up a cookie with path=/ from some org, then
get a GIF (which has no Set-Cookie, Expires now, Cache-control, etc.),
can it be cached ?
I think I had misunderstood the mechanism somewhat; if I want to use
the cookie in a page, should I make that page uncacheable with Expires,
Cache-Control, etc. ??

Microsoft's proxy caches responses from requests with cookie headers if
no cache-control / Expires / pragma: no-cache / etc. is present in the
response.
We've been operating this way since October and have seen no problems
with it...

Andrew Daviel:
According to both HTTP/1.1 and the state management spec: Yes, unless one of
the usual headers which prevent caching is added. See the state management
spec (RFC 2109) for details.
