Hi all,
I have successfully configured jigsaw in order to allow PUTs in my working area.
This is great but I would like to restrict who can do PUTs
without having to force him/her to authenticate for accessing that realm.
Can anyone point me in the righ direction? Or to the right manual page?
Or am I trying to do something impossible?
Thanks in advance
Enrico

Hello Enrico,
You should configure jigsaw to authorize a PUT from a given IP address.
I don't know if it's possible to say user x belongs to IP@ y in jigsaw. Many
times, you just know that the IP@ is correct, but don't know who is behind
that address.
I don't know how to configure Jigsaw, so you should address that part of the
question to the jigsaw public mailing list.
I hope this helps you,
-jose
