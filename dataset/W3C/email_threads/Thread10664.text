you seem to be counting issues as finished by "has a response been sent to
the commentator."
In concepts a number of issues have been decided but held up at this hurdle:
i.e.
pfps issues, where we want to point him at the complete document,
tex-01 where I need to generate the test cases,
efth-01 process confusion between editors
With the issues resolved today I see only:
danc-02
xmlsch-01
xmlsch-02
xmlsch-05
xmlsch-06
outstanding.
Does this tally with your records?
I am currently prioritising OWL Test Cases Last Call and RDF Core last call
issue resolutions - updating the concepts doc which will allow the pfps
responses is lower priority.

Well, really I'm counting them as done when we have completed the whole
dance and got a response to our resolution from the commentor.
I can't confirm that. I've been tracking responses to commentors on the
misguided assumption that responses would go out soon after the
resolution. A mistake to be corrected next time around.
I suppose I could refactor my records to track the actual resolutions but
I'm not sure its worth it at this stage.
Brian
There was a hack I could do to show resolutions until the formal responses
come out which I've now done:
With that filled in, I can:
agree that those you list are still to be resolved.
We have not resolved tex-01 - you have an action to update the proposal.
2003-03-28#16 jjc update proposal on tex-01
so according to my records that is still on the list as well.
18 done and 6 to go.

In the IRC log
I read
16:21:05 jang_scribe proposed jjc
16:21:08 jang_scribe second jang
16:21:10 jang_scribe against?
16:21:13 jang_scribe abstain?
16:21:36 jang_scribe ok, decided.
16:21:39 jang_scribe tex-01 resolved,
16:21:50 jang_scribe action jjc produce test case for tex-01 and reply to
tex
only ythe action got into the minutes
Jeremy
That is unfortunate. However, the minutes are the official record of the
meeting, so tex-01 is officially not resolved :( I'll put it up again this
week to complete the process.
