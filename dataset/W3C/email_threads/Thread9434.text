Hello all,
For folks interested in working on the RDF Primer, Eric's trying
to arrange an initial telecon. Current proposed time is:
Thursday, 2001-09-27 at 11:00 AM EST
We're hoping to cover the outline, scope, and getting initial
people to sign up for sections of the document.
RSVP to me/Eric about whether or not this time is good for you.
Thanks,
[ "Aaron Swartz" ; mailto:me@aaronsw.com ; http://www.aaronsw.com/ ]
Fine with me.
