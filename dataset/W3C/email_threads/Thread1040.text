To Dave Raggett,
Just started your 'Beginning XHTML' book. I find it fascinating and Thanks
to all of you.
I thought I would run Tidy to see how bad my programs are. Better than I
thought.
Below might be a problem. So I thought I'd bring it to your attention.
The following code puts an Anailable/Not Available Yahoo Mesenger graphic
on my page.
Tidy shows the following errors.
a
href="http://edit.yahoo.com/config/send_webmesg?.target=george_fischer76530&amp;.src=pg"
Warning unescaped &amp; or unknown &amp; entity "&amp; src"
img border=0 alt="Messenger notice"
src="http://opi.yahoo.com/online?u=george_fischer76530&amp;m=g&amp;t=1" /a font
size="2"
Warning unescaped &amp; or unknown &amp; entity "&amp;m"
Warning unescaped &amp; or unknown &amp; entity "&amp;t"
Best of luck to all of you.

Hi George,
To include an ampersand (&amp;) in your text, it needs to be escaped as a
character entity, e.g. &amp;amp; This applies to URL attributes (href, src) as
well as content.
a href=
"http://edit.yahoo.com/config/send_webmesg?.target=george_fischer76530&amp;amp;.src=pg"
Warning unescaped &amp;amp; or unknown &amp;amp; entity "&amp;amp; src"
img border="0"
alt="Messenger notice"
src=
"http://opi.yahoo.com/online?u=george_fischer76530&amp;amp;m=g&amp;amp;t=1"
take it easy,
Charlie
