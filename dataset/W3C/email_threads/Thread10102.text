Due to travelling, I shall probably be unable to attend the 2002-11-15
telecon, and certainly be unavailable for 2002-11-22.

Have a good time.
We are clearly at a critical time for progressing the documents to last
call. What position are you in to work on docs over the next few weeks
whilst travelling? One of the advantages of having two editors on a
document is that whilst one may be unavailable, the other can carry
on. Can you please work out with Jeremy how you'd like to work this so
that we are able to continue to make rapid progress.

To work *on* the document will be problematic. But should be able to
discuss document content and will be able to apply any decisions on or very
soon after 25 November (just over a week from now).

The present schedule calls for documents to be review ready by 29th
Nov. 25th is cutting things a bit fine.
Brian
I don't want to slow anything up, so if we need to move forward then let's
do it (i.e. I'm sure Jeremy can handle it just fine).
But I'll note that if we know what changes we want to make by the end of
this week then 4 days seems like plenty of time to actually apply them. I
shall be in regular email contact.
