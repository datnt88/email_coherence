I'd like to preserve the implicit hierarchy of HTML headings when converting to XHTML. For example, I'd like to end up with this XHTML output:

Actually, nesting plain "div"s seems sufficient in Amaya and in MSIE:
Using "id"s (names) might be pretty, but as Jany points out, they make the
structure inconvenient to modify. Retaining the hN elements seems useful
for backward compatibility with HTML.
I'd be interested in hearing why OpenJade might be a better solution, but
Tidy still seems to be appropriate for this variation of HTML-to-XHTML
conversion. Does this seem feasible in the simplified form above?
