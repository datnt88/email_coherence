I tried fixing the 2 problems I identified, and then it returned
all four services when I tried it on
It also worked on the FrenchDictionary service that's also at the
Mindswap site.
I've just tried changing the reader class, rather than fixing
the vocabulary classes, etc.
In OWLSReader_1_0.java:
1. Add this import:
import com.hp.hpl.jena.rdf.model.ResourceFactory; // for fixing a bug /\/
2. 2. In the body of the class add the lines:
private Property OWLS_1_0_Process_theParameter =
ResourceFactory.createProperty("http://www.daml.org/services/owl-s/1.0/
Process.owl#theParameter");
private Property OWLS_1_0_Process_atProcess =
ResourceFactory.createProperty("http://www.daml.org/services/owl-s/1.0/
Process.owl#atProcess");
3. Find the method
createDataFlow(Process process, Resource processComponentInfo)
Where it says getProperty(OWLS_1_0.Process.theProperty),
replace it with getProperty(OWLS_1_0_Process_theParameter)
(2 places).
Where it says getProperty(OWLS_1_0.Process.atClass);
replace it with .getProperty(OWLS_1_0_Process_atProcess)
(2 places).

Sorry - I meant DATA-flow, of course.
There's a similar problem on the output side.
See method writeDataFlow(Process process) in OWLSWriter_1_0.

Thanks Jeff,
Good work! I found out from the author of the API that the owl-s.jar in the
current release is not the most recent. I downloaded the latest version from
too.

ResourceFactory.createProperty("http://www.daml.org/services/owl-s/1.0/Proce
ss.owl#theParameter");
ResourceFactory.createProperty("http://www.daml.org/services/owl-s/1.0/Proce
ss.owl#atProcess");
Quoting Dónal Murtagh domurtag@cs.tcd.ie :
Thanks; but now I'm a bit puzzled, because when I look at that
version, it still seems to have the problem.
(Mouse, mouse, mouse). Ok, I can see what's happening now.
OWLSReader_1_0 still does
getProperty(OWLS_1_0.Process.theProperty)
But in owls/vocabulary/jena/OWLS_1_0.java, theProperty
is defined to be "theParameter":
public static Property theProperty =
ResourceFactory.createProperty(URI, "theParameter");
(And similarly atClass is defined using "atProcess".)
So it looks like a quick fix that will be tidied up later.
Cheers,
Jeff
Sorry, I couldn't reply to you last week while I was out of town. The
problems about reading composite service descriptions were fixed in the
SVN and now there is a new release of the API that contains these bug
fixes along with more code examples and a small tutorial. There is also
a new mailing list created (owl-s@lists.mindswap.org) for API related
questions. The API is available under MIT license. You can find the
license terms here: http://www.mindswap.org/2004/owl-s/api/license.shtml
Thanks,
Evren
