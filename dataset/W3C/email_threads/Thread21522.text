Great news! There is only one open issue now in the edtodo, issue 262,
which we cannot resolve completely until I've made my proposal regarding
Infoset-isms. I hope to have that proposal out by the end of today, we
can then put it on the agenda for next week's call.
Thanks to everyone for all the work you've put in, both in discussion
and actual editing.
No doubt we will get more work to do on this weeks con-call ;-)

I've been slacking off my editing duties whilst filling in for my boss
over the last few weeks. To make amends I volunteer to handle whatever
editorial work results from tomorrows call.
