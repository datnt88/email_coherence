aloha, jon!
whilst i applaud the tersification, i do have one immediate question on the
consolidation of guideline 9: are the deprecated slash consolidated checkpoints
to be transferred to the Techniques document at techniques for the new, more
general checkpoints, or dropped altogether?

Jim Allan and I this moring came up with a proposal to reduce the number of
checkpoints in Guideline 9 from 25 down to 11.
1. 22 current checkpoints are consolidated into 4 new more general
checkpoints that better relect the indent of the original checkpoints
2. 4 checkpoints remain unchanges
3. 4 three new checkpoints are proposed for configuration
4. 1 checkpoint was removed since it seemed to be part of an existing
navigation checkpoint
The proposed checkpoints have the prefix "Checkpoint".
Four new Checkpoints that consolidate other checkpoints
Checkpoint: Provide summary information about the current view [Priority 1,
Both]
Consolidates the following 6 checkpoints in the current draft
9.1 Provide a mechanism for highlighting and identifying (through a
standard interface where available) the current view. [Priority 1]
9.2 Provide a mechanism for highlighting and identifying (through a
standard interface where available) the user selection. [Priority 1]
9.3 Provide a mechanism for highlighting and identifying (through a
standard interface where available) the current focus. [Priority 1]
9.7 Identify a frame selected by the user. [Priority 2]
9.9 Make available the primary language of a document's content. [Priority 3]
9.14 Make available what portion of the document has loaded. [Priority 3]
Checkpoint: Provide information about the attributes of a current element
[Priority 1, Both]
Consolidates the following 5 checkpoints in the current draft
9.16 Make available whether a chosen link (target) has already been
visited. [Priority 3]
9.17 Make available whether a chosen link (target) is local to the
document. [Priority 3]
9.18 Make available whether following a link will involve a fee. [Priority 3]
9.20 Make available the dimensions of a chosen table. [Priority 3]
9.24 Provide the user with access to any label explicitly associated with a
form control. [Priority 2]
Checkpoint: Provide statistical information on document content [Priority 2]
Consolidates the following 7 checkpoints in the current draft
9.4 Provide the user with information about the number of viewports.
[Priority 2]
9.9 Make available the primary language of a document's content. [Priority 3]
9.10 Make available the number of links (to distinct targets) in a
document. [Priority 3]
9.11 Make available the number of visited links (to distinct targets) in a
document. [Priority 3]
9.12 Make available the number of tables in a document. [Priority 3]
9.13 Make available the number of form controls in a document. [Priority 3]
9.14 Make available what portion of the document has loaded. [Priority 3]
Checkpoint: Provide relative position information for the current element
[Priority 2]
Consolidates the following 4 checkpoints in the current draft
9.15 Identify a link selected by the user. [Priority 3]
9.19 Identify a table selected by the user. [Priority 3]
9.22 Identify the table containing a table cell selected by the user.
[Priority 3]
9.23 Make available the coordinates in the current table of a selected
table cell. [Priority 3]
Four Unchanged Checkpoints:
Checkpoint: Provide access to header information for a table cell selected
by the user [Priority 1, DUA]
Checkpoint: Ensure that when the selection changes, it is in the viewport
after the change. [Priority 2]
Checkpoint: Ensure that when the focus changes, it is in the viewport after
the change. [Priority 2]
Checkpoint: Maintain consistent user agent behavior and default
configurations between software releases. Consistency is less important
than accessibility and adoption of system conventions. [Priority 3]
Three New Checkpoints:
Checkpoint: Allow the user to configure summary information [Priority 3]
Checkpoint: Allow the user to configuration statistical information
[Priority 3]
Checkpoint: Allow the user to configure types attribute information
identified [Priority 3]
Remove Checkpoints
Checkpoint 9.8 seems to be defined in 8.6 (remove)
Please review and comment on this proposal.

The content of the consolidated checkpoints would be used as the basis for
the techniques document explanation of how to implementing the proposed
checkpoints. So no information would be lost, information would move to
the techniques document.

I support the proposed changes.
I would suggest that the old checkpoints be reworked into techniques, and I
think in a couple of cases we might want to list required information in
explanatory notes in the checkpoint, but we should look at it first.
