Mary,
Every time I try to spend time on the DOM test suite I hit the problem that
the test suite build is failing for some kind of zip file.
After fixing this in the build.xml by omitting these sub specs I start
building a test which I then try to generate and build using the suite.
The problem with that is that it takes way too long before you can debug
your tests if you use the suite to generate and build it.
Did you use a shortcut to generate, build and debug a simple java test ?
Thanks in advance,
jeroen

Not sure if this is what you are looking for but
I have attached some files that I use to run a single
test outside the testsuite.
The file trni.java is a test for traversal/range.
The file getXMLDocument.java loads the file and testResults.java
checks the results.

Jeroen,
It can be a little frustrating getting it running
at first, particularly if you are trying to work
in short spurts. After your framework is built,
actual test generation and running should be
straight-forward using the ant tasks. What
problem are you having -- is it taking too long
or are you getting errors?
At one point, to try to figure out what was wrong,
I would hand enter the transformation commands
for a single test, rather than regenerating all tests.
At the time, I think I created a simple script that
accepted a filename and just built that particular
test. I no longer have it, but could probably re-create
it. Are you trying to build level 3 tests? We haven't
done anything with level 3, so you might be running into
problems that no one else has encountered. Could you
forward a test that you are working with, or point me
in the right direction, and I'll see what I can come
up with. It probably wouldn't be a bad idea to have
an ant task that allowed you to work with just one
test at a time.
