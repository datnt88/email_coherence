In W3C Specifications,
- - First level sections are very large, bold, and blue.
- - Second level sections are large, normal weight, and blue.
- - Third level sections are normal size, bold, and black.
I find the transition from "blue" to "black" very jarring. In
particular, these sections lose the appearance of being section
dividers.
This problem is particularly noticable in documents like the XSL/XML
Query Data Model where paragraphs discussing infoset properties often
contain a fair amount of bold text.
Is there any possibility that a different style might be applied?
Be seeing you,

We could make the third level headings blue also.
All the best, Ashok
I agree it doesn't look too good when there's lots of bold text around. One
answer might be to use less bold text... and (in the case of the Data Model
spec) to avoid using code in a heading.
