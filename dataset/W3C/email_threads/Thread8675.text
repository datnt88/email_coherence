Todd,
Again, I *strongly* encourage Joseph and others at the W3C, as well as
leaders in the IETF, to consider this as a W3C/IETF activity. It really
*should not* be a Legal XML activity. But, there should be *someplace*
where this discussion and work can take place . . .
I am not fully aware about the procedures, but it should not be too
difficult for anybody to initate a BOF at the next IETF e.g., so you could
go for it!

In the W3C there are workshops, but they are usually more "costly" to start
than an IETF BoF. I believe for an IETF BoF you generally have to show the
area director(s) that there is a body of interest that would make scheduling
the topic worthwhile. I created the xml encryption list [1] to see if that
thresh-hold of interest is high enough. (Though I haven't committed to
starting/devoting-time to it and their hasn't been all that much
discussion.) Someone could do the same for XML cert (or I'd be happy to
create a list when I get back from Europe).
