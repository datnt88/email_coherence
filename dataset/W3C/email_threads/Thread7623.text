In our project we want to support persistency of our meta-data in a repository,
based on WebDAV.
We'd like to avoid fine-grain repositories because there is no a product of this
type, running
on different platforms. We'd like to use different WebDAV servers depending on
our
requirements and to protect ourselves from their differences via WebDAV
protocol.
We found that the following services from WebDAV are crucial for us:
- naming service, properties, etc. (the whole WebDAV level-2)
- versioning (Delta-V)
- query service (DASL)
- transactions
- relationships
In WebDAV level-2 there is something called links.
In RFC2518 links are defined in paragraph 4.6 "Media Independent Links"
"A WebDAV link is a special type of property value, formally defined in section
12.4, that allows
typed connections to be established between resources of any media type."
From 12.4 "Link XML Element"
We suppose that these links are the closest notion in WebDAV that may be used to
map relationships between models,
but there are a lot of questions in respect to Delta-V and DASL.
1) Does a link include version information for "src" and "dsc" or "src" and
"dst" will be resolved in a context of a workspace?
2) Can I get part of the whole link back as result of a DASL query?
For example, I'd like to know all destinations for particular source for
particular kind of a link.
3) Is there any intention to provide special operations for links?
For example, I'd like to modify link. Is it required to download the whole
link, change, then save or
may I do incremental modifications (add/remove pairs (src, dst) from a link
without downloading it)?
Thanks,
Viktor
From: Viktor Lioutyi Viktor_Lioutyi@i2.com
and
I believe that the intent was for the src and dst of a link to be a URL.
This URL could be:
- a specific revision (in which case no versioning resolution
is required)
- a specific versioned resource (in which case either a
workspace or a revision-id could be used to resolve the URL to a
particular working resource or revision of the versioned resource)
- a versioned resource that is identified by performing version
selection on the versioned collections identified by prefixes of
the URL (in which case a workspace must be used to resolve
the URL to a particular working resource or revision).
Cheers,
Geoff

1) Does a link include version information for "src" and "dsc" or "src" and
"dst" will be resolved in a context of a workspace?
The link does not include version information, and generally this would not
be a good practice as it would require editing of the property and/or
containing documents to change revisions of related resources. So these,
and all other URL references would be resolved in the context of the
workspace which would be inherited from the request.
2) Can I get part of the whole link back as result of a DASL query?
For example, I'd like to know all destinations for particular source
for
particular kind of a link.
I don't know DASL that well, but does it support regular expressions in
matching strings like SQL?
3) Is there any intention to provide special operations for links?
For example, I'd like to modify link. Is it required to download the
whole
link, change, then save or
may I do incremental modifications (add/remove pairs (src, dst) from a

Links are properties and may be modified with PROPPATCH. You'll have to use
PROPFIND first if you need to modify an existing link.
Thanks,
Viktor
Viktor - for questions about DASL you should write to www-webdav-dasl@w3.org
I am cc'ing that list with my answers to your questions.
Yes. The result of a DASL query is a set of property values, it is just as
if you did a PROPFIND on the resources that the query selects.
But maybe that is not what you meant to ask. if you meant, "Can I write a
query that selects all resources that have a link that is of certain type
and whose destination is a certain URL" the answer is no not in the current
DASL. DASL only allows queries that compare properties to constant string
values, it does not provide a way to compare a portion of the XML value of
a property.
It does support a pattern match operator, similar to the LIKE operator of
SQL. This is not as powerful as a regular expression though.
thanks for your interest. for other email on dasl please use the dasl
