As actioned yesterday I have prepared a new version of this WD for review by
next Friday, when, hopefully, we will agree to publish.
The new copy is dated 26 October and can be found at:
For those of you who have already studied the 25 October draft, the following
version shows non-trivial differences.
Please try and avoid confusing these two drafts.
There is an archive copy (CSS and imgs broken) at:
Substantive differences from yesterday are:
+ the datatype URI component of a literal is optional
+ the term typed literal and untyped literal are defined and used
+ the type rdfs:StringLiteral is deleted
Other differences are
+ the untyped literal is suggested as appropriate for "plain text in a natural
language"
+ datatype mappings only use the string, not the langID
+ rdfs:XMLLiteral is an exception in that it uses the langID
+ no value is defined for untyped literals (section 4.2.2)
+ the lexical form is the string not a pair
+ literals are hence triples (except for untyped ones)

PS: I think these latest changes are an improvement, not merely an attempt to
compromise with Pat. The notion of untyped literal is one that RDF users
moving from M&amp;S will know, and readers of the primer will use. So to have
that explicit in the graph is probably appropriate.
Jeremy--
I'm having trouble parsing the above. Which of the above two URLs
points to the version we should be looking at as containing the latest
stuff? And which two drafts are we to avoid confusing, the ones pointed
to by the two URLs you've given above, or one of them vs. the 25 October
draft?
