Hi all,
I have been using Tidy for some time (the C version,
tinkered with the JTidy Java version
(http://sourceforge.net/projects/jtidy) and I note that there is a Perl
binding at the planning stage (http://sourceforge.net/projects/ptidy).
Is anyone working on a Python binding? This would I guess be quite an
easy thing to include with the C version, given that Python as a
language is a veneer on C APIs anyway. A Python binding would make
scripting with Tidy very easy, e.g. to write bespoke website maintenance
tools.
Thoughts?

Check out http://www.lemburg.com/files/python/mxTidy.html
Excellent! Can I request that the main page is updated to include this link?
(i.e. http://tidy.sourceforge.net/index.html)

Can I suggest you read the web page a little closer - it has had the Python
link for quite some time now grin .
Regards, Terry
You're not wrong. Nay, I'd go further, you're right!
Thanks.
