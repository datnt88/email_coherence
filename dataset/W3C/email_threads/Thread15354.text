Hello,
On the mailing list, we have had some discussion about numbering success
criteria [1]. Jason, Gregg, Ben, and I were editing the next draft and
came up with the following proposal.
If each guideline was identified by a letter (e.g., "N" for "Navigable")
rather than a number (3) and if each conformance letter was identified by a
letter (M for Minimum, S for Second Level, T for Third Level), then each
success criterion could have a unique identifier (e.g., N3M1, N3M2, N3S1).
For example, the current checkpoint 3.4 with the proposed scheme:
Checkpoint N4 Provide consistent and predictable responses to user actions.
Success criteria
You will have successfully met Checkpoint N4 at the Minimum Level if:
N4M1. where inconsistent or unpredictable responses are essential
to the function of the content (e.g. mystery games, adventure
games, tests, etc.) the user is warned in advance of encountering them.
N4M2. wherever there are extreme changes in context, one of the following
is true:
a. an easy to find setting, that persists for the site visit, is
provided
for the user to deactivate processes or features that cause
extreme changes in context or
b. extreme changes in context are identified before they occur
so the user can determine if they wish to proceed or so they
can be prepared for the change
At the Second Level:
N4S1. the content has been reviewed, and it has been found that where
inconsistent or unpredictable responses are essential to its
function (e.g. mystery games, adventure games, tests, etc.),
the user is warned in advance of encountering them
At the Third Level:
(presently no additional criteria for this level.)
Pros and Cons:
- Should sound better for screen reader users since there are not
multiple numbers that are read in a row and the numbers follow
the letters.
- Creates a unique identifier for each success criterion.
- Might be harder to decipher the checkpoints.
- Is not consistent with WCAG 1.0, ATAG 1.0, or UAAG 1.0
numbering schemes.
- However, since it is different and since some people need to
conform to both WCAG and ATAG or WCAG and UAAG,
they are less likely to confuse ATAG/UAAG checkpoint 3.4
with WCAG 2.0 checkpoint N4.
- Not sure that it help distinguish our conformance levels from
those of WCAG 1.0 (Level A, Level AA, Level AAA) and
the priority scheme (priority 1, 2, 3). Although, we did make
a minor change: previous "Level 2" is "Second Level"
and "Level 3" is "Third Level."
Discussion questions:
1. Is this easier or harder to decipher than the previous proposals?
i.e., 1.1.1.1 or 1.1-1a ?
2. Is it a benefit that this is different from the WCAG/ATAG/UAAG 1.0
numbering scheme or will it cause confusion?
3. Our preliminary tests showed this was better for screen
reader users. Do you agree or disagree?
4. Other issues or comments about this proposal?
We discussed some other possibilities but discarded those because:
1. we wanted to associate the checkpoint with the guideline in some way to
preserve the grouping (thus we didn't want to assign a unique number to
each checkpoint).
2. we wanted to make something that would not be garbled by a screen reader
(1.1.-1a was read as "one one one ah" instead of "one one one A").

Whether or not this is a good idea for English-speakers, I think this
would be a nightmare for internationalization. For one thing, it's very
unlikely that in all languages, the five best translations of
Perceivable, Operable, etc., would all start with different letters.
The same goes for Minimum, Second and Third. The semantics would lose
all meaning when localized.
I don't know that success criteria numbering is a problem that exists
outside of the WCAG WG; therefore, I propose that any solution to this
problem should be handled within the WG, without passing it on to the
end users of the document. If we want to use this terminology to
streamline discussion on conference calls or in email, then we can just
as easily adopt it as shorthand without changing the document itself.
(Or perhaps something more intuitive to participants, like G3.2-AAA-1.)
As AUWG contact, this represents a problem for me, since our document's
conformance scheme depends on that of WCAG, and I'm concerned this
would confuse tool vendors.

Wendy,
whilst M,S and T are consistent in there usage, and repeated regularly
throughout the Guidelines, really there seams little reason for
reducing Navigable to N.
This has been discussed at length with regard to some HTML attribute, I
forget which.
The point is that for very little extra text the meaning is more
immediately transparent.
back on M,S and T, don't we already have A, AA and AAA as well as 1,2
and 3 do we need another tier?
thanks
Jonathan
Hi Jonathan
We do not have A, AA, AAA anymore.
And M, S and T are Minimum, Second and Third
So they replace 1, 2, 3

Oh AND, someone pointed out that if we use that numbering scheme - that it
doesn't translate to other languages.
But if we use
1-2-1-4
it says nothing. No clue as to what it means or belongs to......
hmmmmmm.
What is meaningful -- and yet is language independent?
Anyone have any ideas?

I said that.
I think M, S, and T are needless redefinitions. Nobody outside of this
list will know or care what they mean. A, AA, and AAA are at least
recognizable.
If it's a matter of screen-reader capability, then I suggest the terms
spelled out: "A", "double A" and "triple A". Or something else that's
sequential, like A, B, and C.

Gregg,
as if I need to spell it out, I agree with Matt, and would prefer, one
English word such as Navigation to be included as a topic marker
Presumably this word could be translated for localisation
AAA is clearer than 1,2 ,3 in my opinion as AAA is clearly the best,
whereas 1 and 3 are arguable.....similarly with A and C
thanks
Jonathan
We decided to not use A, AA, AAA in WCAG 2.0 because 2.0 is structured in a
completely different way and level 1 2 and 3 don't mean the same thing as
A, AA, and AAA. So it would be confusing.
But if we ignore that detail - and just think of it as being 3 levels of
increasing accessibility. Interesting to consider.
But then don't you end up with a number scheme that looks like
N1AAA2 ??

Hi,
for "internationalization" of the reference, instead of M, S, T why don't
use roman number?
I (first)
II (second)
III (third)
Also this could be a mind-back for people that knows A, AA, AAA
These my two cents :)

Mmmmhhh... I think is a good numbering proposal. Maybe we could
use a different method to "rendering" it:
[N.4] M1: where inconsistent or unpredictable responses are essential
[N.4] M2: wherever there are extreme changes in context, one of the
Or, mixing the letter reference and number of checkpoint:
N(3.4) M1: where inconsistent or unpredictable responses are essential
N(3.4) M2: wherever there are extreme changes in context, one of the
What about? Too complex?

Good thoughts.
Remember that all this has to be read aloud by screen reader users.
Try reading there aloud before each item in a list. You begin to see what
was nice about N3M2
It reads quickly
But has the other problems,

"A screen reader" here tends to mean "Jaws." The problem, at any
rate, is a *user agent* problem. It's not the author's problem. It
is up to screen-reader manufacturers to either improve their default
handling of letter-number combinations or allow users to adjust such
handling.
WAI should not write any portion of WCAG 2.0 around the bugs of Jaws
or any other product. That's one of 1.0's many failings.

Hi Joe,
I wasn't referring to any bugs in screen readers. Not sure what gave that
impression.
I just meant the time it took to read different numbering approaches.
To see what I meant - just read the following aloud.
N3M2
becomes
"N" "3" "M" "2"
which is quite fast and informative. I can tell this is the 3rd Checkpoint
under Navigation - 2nd success criteria under minimum.
3.3.1.2 becomes
"3" "dot" "3" "dot" "1" "dot" "2"
which is longer, repetitive and harder to remember and interpret.
("dot" may be "point" on some screen readers but result is same.)
You can read the other proposals aloud too and see what they sound like, and
how long they are.
Remember that these numbers are read before each item in a list and break up
ones ability to view the items as groups.
Some ideas we have seen are
- be sure each item has full and unique number or label
- make sure that the numbers are informative
- just put the lowest level numbering and use the titles above for context
- have full numbers but have a script that will shorten the numbering for
screen reader users
- use numbering that allows you to quickly place the success criteria even
when out of context
- make numbering easy and quick (short) to say for screen reader users who
must listen to it before each item.
In the grand scheme of things, the content is much more important than the
numbering - though someday we will need to pick a scheme - and there is some
advantage to doing it earlier for consistency.
So if people have ideas - post em. But we will just pick a scheme pretty
soon that works well for all users (the goal of our guidelines) and get on
with the content part.

why not consider *, **, ***. or any other easily found and positive
symbol such as @, @@, and @@@, which could be agreed on.
the problem with 3 different symbols. is that the order is not
apparent. 1st is great but so is 3/3, so is one better than three?
Whereas most people accept that more of the same is better, even though
this ain't necessarily so.
I don't see any problem staying with A, AA, and AAA, 2.0 is a different
standard, so it's just different.
'Crowns' were a coin for (half) a millennia though the value changed,
and Dollars are no longer solid silver.
