Hi,
does anyone know what's wrong in this answer:
**HTTP-recv(09.05.03/12:23:02.340293):

After getting the answer MSIE6 tells me, that it can't open / as a
WebFolder.
Regards: Michael
Web Folders requires some non-standard decoration of the PROPFIND
response. It needs to know what format the date/time properties are in
for some reason. You can PROPFIND to a free account sharemation to see
how WFS made this work.
Also I suspect getlastmodified is in the wrong format in the first
place.

says :
The element status must occur after prop, not before.

No. Element order is irrelevant in WebDAV.
The issue here are the broken timestamps.
Hi all,
thanks for your help. The solution is a little bit more comlplex.
MSIE6 needs extensions to the WebDAV standard. The following works:
HTTP/1.1 207 Multi-Status
Cache-Control: no-cache
Connection: Keep-Alive
Date: Thu, 15 May 2003 15:23:28 GMT
Server: Spider 4.1.3.2.1 (May 15 2003 16:50:02)
Content-Length: 409
multistatus xmlns="DAV:"
xmlns:b="urn:uuid:c2f41010-65b3-11d1-a29f-00aa00c14882/"
So MSIE is not standard compliant and also no WebDAV client.
The same problem applies to all other MS products (Excel, Word, ...).

Please note that it's not IE, it's a specific DLL (MSDAIPP.DLL) that is
shipping with various products in various versions (this explains why it
affects both IE and Office). This particular problem (among others) is
documented at:
