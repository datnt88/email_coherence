This is invalid; all the &amp;'s should be replaced with &amp;amp;
No, the &amp;'s are delimiting the arguments of a GET-style CGI query.
However, the &amp; before lookup is unnecessary, and may be confusing things.
They *should* be &amp;amp;, although the one before lookup is also
wrong.
These &amp;s occur in a CDATA parameter context. In such a context,
SGML entitities are replaced. That means that any paramter name
that spoofs a known entity will get substituted by that entity and
any that doesn't will be at the mercy of the parser's error
recovery.
The HTML 4 specification goes as far as to advise people creating
form handlers to accept ; as a synonym for &amp; when the server is
likely
to be used with GET type form URLs coded in anchors rather than
generated by forms. It does this to avoid the need to use &amp;amp;

From the HTML 4 specification:
B.2.2 Ampersands in URI attribute values
The URI that is constructed when a form is submitted [p.245] may be used as
an
anchor-style link (e.g., the href attribute for the A element).
Unfortunately, the use
of the "&amp;" character to separate form fields interacts with its use in SGML
attribute
values to delimit character entity references [p.32] . For example, to use
the URI
"http://host/?x=1&amp;y=2" as a linking URI, it must be written A
href="http://host/?x=1&amp;#38;y=2" or A href="http://host/?x=1&amp;amp;y=2" .
We recommend that HTTP server implementors, and in particular, CGI
implementors support the use of ";" in place of "&amp;" to save authors the
trouble of
escaping "&amp;" characters in this manner.
This is a tangent to the list's purpose, so I'd suggest any responses be
offlist.
DJW: Conceded; you quote the spec, it must be the spec. Thanks. I'll pass
these messages along to the folks I know working on such database-driven
resources. I'll have to try the numerical entity-substituted URIs with
various databases and browsers to see how it works (i.e., how well the
numerical entity substitution and named entity substitutions are implemented
by various browsers and such - I'll let you know if I come up with any
problems, unless that doesn't interest you). As a matter of style, do folks
think the recorded URI text in the link should reflect the text or not?
(say,
a
href="http://www.nothing.org?search=yes&amp;amp;param=hello" http://www.nothing.
org?search=yes&amp;amp;param=hello /a
or
a
href="http://www.nothing.org?search=yes&amp;amp;param=hello" http://www.nothing.
org?search=yes&amp;amp;amp&amp;semi;param=hello /a
with &amp;semi; filling in for the entity for a semicolon because I'm too busy
to find the entity name for a semicolon right now, sorry)? There are
reasons for using the URI in the text as well as the hyperlink.
Note, by the way, for the record, that in shorter URIs 2.3 didn't seem to
have problems with the use of the ampersand. I don't know why, and I
haven't had time to check 2.4.
Is it also mentioned in the HTTP spec (assuming there is one on the W3 site,
I'll find it later)? Has there been feedback from the perl module writers
etc.? Feel free to answer offlist; this message is only onlist for the
record (to record the concession).
