Here is the latest suggested modification and text for the Spec:
Security issues:
We suggest using the existing disputes attribute which is a placeholder for
seals of any type (which can then be included in the browser's list of
approved seals, along with a type attribute).
Accompanying text for spec (Section 3.2.6, after independent
organization...):
Policy writers may also use this attribute to specify and seals related to
the entity's information practices (including privacy and security seals).

Looks good except
- one typo (specify and seals -- specify seals)
- maybe change "seals" to "seals or certification programs" to make it
a little more clear what we are talking about.

Looks good for me. Is this already in bugzilla?

OK I agree on this.
And here is what I think the consensus was on security measures
Text for spec (Section 3.2.6, after independent
organization...):
Policy writers may also use this attribute to specify seals and
certification programs related to
the entity's information practices (including privacy and security
seals).
