Dan,
i think that at least the "tv:" scheme seems to be ready to be
forwarded to the IESG for adoption - what do you think ? There
was not much discussion last time you did an update, so maybe it's
time to wrap this up.

Agreed. We were a little careless in our terminology (as others also
pointed out), and I just haven't gotten around to revising the drafts.

Subject: "lid" URLs
(someone) wrote me:
I've just noticed a couple of Internet drafts that propose and refer to a
URI scheme called lid:
draft-blackketter-lid-00.txt
draft-finseth-isanlid-00.txt
I have two thoughts:
(a) these lid:'s look more like URNs to me
(b) the lid draft claims that lid:'s are simulatneously URIs and URNs, but
they don't conform to URN syntax (in not having a leading "urn:" or
namespace identifier parts).
I don't have a problem with URL-schemes that have URN-like semantics,
since there are enough of them already (cid, news, etc.). I think the
wording (saying that lid URLs are URNs) probably needs to change, since
it just adds confusion.

this is great news ! thanks for the update

Philipp,
Yes, I did forward the current "tv:" spec to the IESG shortly after my last
posting. So they are working on it.
If we have some consensus around "lid:" as well, I'll certainly forward that
too.

Dan,
this may be an issue: I can't find the draft on the list of
things the IESG is currently working on
You may want to go back and check that things didn't get lost
somewhere.
