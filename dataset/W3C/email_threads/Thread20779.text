This is a newbie question as I have just installed the latest Amaya. Working with tables
I can't seem to find any way of defining the table size. I tend to do a lot of table
within table work and like to be able to define that table dimensions accurately. Any
help would be appreciated.
Thank you,
Bill.
Well, you need to select the element you want (select a point inside it, and
press ESC (Unix) or F2 (Windows) until the status bar at the bottom shows
that you have selected the cell or the table you want
for a cell you would have something like
td / tr / tbody / table / body / html
and for a table you will have
table / body / html
and then the attributes menu will have the available options, which include
width on a table.
However, I spend a lot of my time trying to deal with problems caused by
tables whose sizes are fixed and don't allow for increasing font size and
other simple adjustments to make content easier to use. So please read the
Web COntent Accessibility Guidelines, or at the very least the checklist at

This is a problem I have also had with my MacOSX version. Ihave to enlarge
the window before the status bar is rendered past the first character (I also
have to do this to see any content in the links , structure, parsing errors
views).

Thanks again, the above solved my problem but I have another dumb question.
How do I uncover the status bar at the bottom. All I can see is the first
part of a letter and the rest is blank.

This problem was reported but we don't find out how to fix it yet.
It seemed a problem of clipping.
