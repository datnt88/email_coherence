Re: http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-king-vnd-urlscheme-03.txt
The text clarifies that the term "vendor" isn't actually intended to
mean "vendor".
The term "vendor" is used in this document for simplicity.
It seems to me that this moves the complexity from the the RFC out
into the world of everyone using the schemes. The term "vendor" would
be quite confusing (or even offensive) for organizations which clearly
set themselves aside from "vendors", such as consortia (eg W3C),
governments, universities, and industrial users.
My first idea is to mirror the DNS approach. It's imperfect as well,
but at least people are used to it. The W3C would use org-w3-*, MIT
would use edu-mit-*, the University of Manchester would use
uk-ac-man-*. Of course, in this case, going back to "." instead of
"-" would be very nice. And it all runs afoul of the fact that domain
names can be taken from people and organizations without their
consent. (Java package names use this approach, more or less.)
An simpler approach is to just add the term "org" along side "vnd" and
"prs".
Even simpler: just one prefix that has no implications about what the
named-thing in the second place is. Assuming that W3C wanted to make
a "web" URI scheme (just a joke, of course):
open-w3c-web:foo
free-w3c-web:foo
a-w3c-web:foo
by-w3c-web:foo
tag-w3c-web:foo
ext-w3c-web:foo   === My Favorite ("External/Extension URIs")
user-w3c-web:foo
Finally, one could drop the prefix entirely, saying any scheme with a
dash in it is a non-IETF one, and the first segment should be the
IETF-approved name of an organization controlling the rest of it.

Hi,
I like best Sandro's suggestion in the last paragraph below
(any scheme that contains a hyphen-dash is non-IETF). Mainly
because that reflects the current usage for 'trees' specified
in RFC 2717 "Registration Procedures for URL Scheme Names".
From Section 3.2 "The IETF Tree" of RFC 2717, an excerpt:
"The NAMES of schemes registered in the IETF tree MUST NOT contain the
dash (also known as the hyphen and minus sign) character ('-')
USASCII value 2Dh. Use of this character can cause confusion with
schemes registered in alternative trees (see section 3.3)."
From Section 3.3 "Alternative Trees" of RFC 2717, an excerpt:
"The syntax for alternative trees shall be as follows: each tree will
be identified by a unique prefix, which must be established in the
same fashion as a URL scheme name in the IETF tree, except that the
prefix must be defined by a Standards Track document. Scheme names
in the new tree are then constructed by prepending the prefix to an
identifier unique to each scheme in that tree, as prescribed by that
tree's identifying document:
For instance, the "foo" tree would allow creation of scheme names of
the form: "foo-blahblah:" and "foo-bar:", where the tree prescribes
an arbitrary USASCII string following the tree's unique prefix."
Why do URL schemes need 'vnd' or 'prs' at all?

And the whole notion of a non-IETF tree is predicated on
an assumption that it's good to let a thousand URI schemes
bloom.
I'm not sure about that at all. I'm starting to think
that URI schemes are somewhat like currencies. A few
of them is good, but a zillion of them is counter-productive.
"Why shouldn't I create a new scheme for XYZ?
* New URI schemes are the only thing you can't FollowYourNose to
look them up."
