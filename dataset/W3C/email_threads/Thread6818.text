Hi all,
the current XML specification DTD defines:
!ENTITY % header.mdl
"title, subtitle?, version, w3c-designation, w3c-doctype,
pubdate, notice*, publoc, prevlocs?, latestloc?, authlist,
status, abstract, pubstmt?, sourcedesc?, langusage,
revisiondesc"
With this the lastest version must be after the (possibly many) previous
versions. Although this order can be reversed when converted to HTML I
would like it to be changed in the DTD. The reason is that access to the
latest version of a document is considered (at least by the W3C staff)
very important. So it would be nice if we could change the DTD to
accomodate this.
Thanks.

Fine by me. -Tim
Hello-- The current version actually implemented this RFE already. Please
see the following spec-prod message, where the latest version was announced:
The DTD comments and the documentation explain the change that was made.
Let me know if you have any additional questions.

Thanks, Eve. The DOM spec and scripts need to be updated to use this. I'll
put it on the list of things to do before we're finished.

I have now upgraded the DOM spec to the latest xml DTD. Doing so, I
think I've found a bug in it. The table element doesn't appear to be
allowed *anywhere*!?
I think in the following definition:
!ENTITY % illus.class "eg|graphic|scrap|htable
%local.illus.class;"
"htable" is meant to be "table". Or maybe the two are meant to be
allowed?
As far as the DOM spec is concerned, I worked around this by defining
local.illus.class as "|table", but you probably want to fix this.

I hope to have a chance to work on the DTD while I'm in Montreal this week,
and will take a look at this. If all goes well, I'll announce a new
version next weekend.
