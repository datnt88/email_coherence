Hi,
I'd like to know what interoperability there has benn between
independent implementations of KeyInfo types other than KeyValue and
RetrievalMethod.
In particular, has there been such interoperation for
X509Data, PGPData, or SPKIData
and if so with what subelement or elements?
Also for KeyName, are there two implementations which have agreed on
some particular interpretation for some KeyName values and
interoperated?
Thanks,
Donald

Hi Donald,
The RetrievalMethod example from the last interop points at
an X509Data containing X509SubjectName, X509IssuerSerial and
X509Certificate. Clearly the certificate worked, as that is
where the verification key was retrieved. As for the other
bits, what are the criteria for interop? Successful parsing?
Is it important (from the perspective of having XMLDSIG
successfully advanced along standards tracks) to have hard
interop on these other features?

I believe that in cases where the XMLDSIG standard specifies
particular grandchildren of KeyInfo, such as X509Certificate,
PGPKeyPacket, or SPKISexp and there has not been any interoperability
demonstrated, we may have to move that part of the spec to the
Additional URIs document or to an appendix. The situation is less
clear for KeyInfo children that really just reserve a slot for
something pretty much undefined, like MgmtData. I'm not sure we need
to demonstrate anything there.
Thanks,
Donald

I then attach, for your pleasure, an archive containing a few
signatures that exercise:
KeyName RetrievalMethod[rawX509Certificate] X509Certificate
X509SubjectName X509SKI X509IssuerSerial X509CRL
Instructions for validating these are provided in an enclosed
Readme.txt.
We've exercised DSAKeyValue and RSAKeyValue often, and I think
we agree that MgmtData is reasonably safe. I'm afraid that I
cannot, however, accomodate PGP and SPKI data in the time
available to me.
If anyone can validate any or all of these, that would be
great. They seem to work for me, but I often break things
badly.

Merlin,
We have not implemented KeyName yet.
We have not implemented RetrievalMethod yet.
Validated correctly.

Validation failed since the CRL you provide within the
signature example is lacking for the "nextUpdate" extension,
although it is required according to RFC 2459.

Hi Gregor,
Sorry; the CRL was from a minimal profile. I attach an updated
set of signatures which I think uses PKIX profile, but I don't
track that stuff so I can't be sure.

Hi Merlin,
Now the CRL example works fine!
