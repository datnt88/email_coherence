Is there an existing way to set/remove properties based on the fact
that certain conditions are met in WebDAV or DASL?? I looked at the
existing draft of DASL and it seems to be only query (SELECT), no
INSERT or UPDATE. Any guidance would be appreciated.
Thanks,
Rajiv

Not that I know of. You'll need two round trips (at least) for that.
It really depends on how "atomic" you need to be. You can issue a SEARCH
followed by a PROPPATCH. If you need a true atomic operation, then you
can LOCK, SEARCH, (test), PROPPATCH, UNLOCK.
There are also funny things you can do with the If: header, but I'm not
really clear on how it can be used in situations like this.

The If header doesn't let you express predicates involving property values,
only etags and lock tokens.
