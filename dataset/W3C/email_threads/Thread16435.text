If I'm serving up a page with client side java script going back to our
previous discussion of p2 with regard to checkpoint 6.3, Can I meet 6.3 by
giving the user a choice of dynamically receiving the page without client
side javascript?

Whether you send the javascript or not is irrelevant. The question is whether
the client can do whatever the page does without javascript (or Java, or
ActiveX, or whatever runs the page on the client side).
In most cases this will mean providing a server-side equivalent (or linking
to the stuff manually, in the case of dynamically generated linking
mechanisms)

thank you charles. Actually, the javascript is functioning to deliver some
content. It could be recoded into html most likely without any ill effects
but the guy likes the glitz. So, the theory is that if the js is removed
from the accessable delivery the page would be fine with the content marked
up in html.
Thanks!
