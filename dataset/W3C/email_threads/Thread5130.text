As I started to formulate definitions of the Classes in the TAP KB, I soon began to question whether my assumptions about disjoint subClasses were valid. A hierarchy outline (subClass relations) of the top levels of the TAP KB is given in
Looking at this hierarchy, several question come to mind immediately.
For example:
1. is Agent a subClass of Tangible? or is it excluded by "definition"?
2. is Class a subClass of Intangible? or is it excluded by "definition"?
3. is PopularCharacter a subClass of Intangible? (they all seem be fictional)
I would appreciate some guidance on the rationale behind the current set of Classes.

Hi Richard,
Which part of the TAP material did you extract this from? I can't find a
schema containing the terms to which you refer. I'm a little confused by
your queries, re. disjunction/exclusion, as I was under the impression that
TAP used base-level RDF and hence disjunction wasn't an option.
Cheers,
Danny.

Hi Danny
Sorry to be so late in replying -- I hadn't checked the web site
for the last month. I'm now working with mkrPutData to do
some KB editing.
All the Classes that I mentioned were found by browsing
and checking the TAP knowledge base, mostly using MKE
on my own downloaded copy of the TAP KB. They are part
of the "added" knowledge, not part of the schema.
I realize that RDF can't specify disjoint Classes, but I am
trying to formulate genus-differentia definitions which use
disjoint Classes.
P.S. I just added TAP email to my Syndirella feeds.
