I've added this issue to the RDF Thesaurus ESW Wiki.
Short summary:
Issue 6 - Defining semantic relationships
Description: A thesaurus consists of concepts, labels for concepts, and
semantic relationships between concepts. A semantic relationship is a
relationship of meaning. Most thesauri use a similar set of semantic
relationships, which they label 'broader' 'narrower' and 'related'.
Problem 1: 'broader/narrower' means different things in different thesauri.
In some thesauri it means strictly class-subsumption. In other thesauri it
can mean either is-a, instance-of, or part-of. Also 'related' is not
consistently used. For example some thesauri model part-of relations with
'related', others use 'broader/narrower'
= We must invent some mechanism for providing clear definitions of semantic
relationships, and for removing any scope for ambiguity.
Problem 2: some thesauri have semantic relations other than
'broader/narrower' and 'related'. Some overcome the 'broader/narrower'
fuzziness by using 'BTI', 'BTG' and 'BTP', which stand for
'broader-term-instantive' 'broader-term-generic' and
'broader-term-partitive' respectively. In others there are custom
relationships like 'related-broader'.
= We must provide some mechanism by which users can extend the given
relationship set and define their own semantic relations.

One of the immediate applications that occurs to me for RDF thesauruses is
in mapping between discrete taxonomies. Whatever approach to defining
relationships is adopted, I hope it will be straightforward to take a tree
like the Open Directory website categorization [1] and be able to map across
to corresponding terms in another hierarchy like the Topic Exchange [2], and
carry out merge-like operations (I say merge-like because the structures may
be incompatible, and class/subclass relationships may only work in localized
regions of the trees).
Cheers,
Danny.

This seems amenable to subProperty relationships.
You could have a base property "thesaurusRelationship", subProperties for
broader/narrower, subProperties of those for specific usages like strict
isa, partof etc. In that way some could use a strict partOf relation and a
thesaurus tool that only understood BT would be able to treat it as a
broaderTerm.

Hi Dave,
I agree, I think having a property set like ...
... would be good for thesaurus-specific applications. However, here is
where we start treading on the toes of RDF RDFS and OWL. The property
thes:broaderGeneric would be semantically equivalent to rdfs:subClassOf ,
and the property thes:broaderInstantive would be semantically equivalent
to rdf:type . How do we handle this kind of overlap?

Hi Alistair,
I'm not sure there is a problem here. If BG and BI are truly equivalent to
rdfs:subClassOf and rdf:type then just define them as equivalent using
either owl:equivalentProperty or a pair of rdfs:subPropertyOf relations.
That's the beauty of RDF - open world, multiple inheritance, cycles allowed.
Then a thesaurus processor could take an RDFS file and realise, for
example, that an rdfs:subClassOf relation implies thes:broader.
Dave
OK, so shall we have
and
soks:broaderGeneric owl:equivalentProperty rdfs:subClassOf .
soks:broaderInstantive owl:equivalentProperty rdf:type .
Any objections???
Al.
If they really are the same thing, why not just stop using them, since the
rdfs: stuff is likely to be understood by tools already?
cheers
