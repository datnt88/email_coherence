This is very common practice in pages with forms. I've fought it in the past
as an accessibility issue - but usually clients overrule the decision. WCAG
1 did address it in the don't change focus, page, etc without notifying the
user - right off hand I can't think of where it is addressed in WCAG 2.

I came across something new as I was Jaws browsing along, and that is the
auto focused of the page had been set to a text box mid way down the page
(you can see it at
this made the screen reader start from the text box and miss the info above
it.
It stumped me how they had managed to do this, but then I found in their
code
onLoad="document.searchform.elements[1].focus()"
That did it.
Did I miss this in WCAG ? it seems an accessibility issue.
It also may be an issue for the DOM object model - allowing a script to move
and control the focus and bounce you around the page without your knowledge.

Thanks,
"don't change focus" needs to include "don't set the focus" - in other words
to set it on loading is also an issue

You would have missed it in the WCAG because mostly all the WCAG says about
behavior is that it should be accessible.
The UAAG is the place where the question of what constitutes accessible
behavior is taken up in more depth.
The approach that is taken in the UAAG is not that the page should not pre-set
the focus to an internal location but that the browser should advise the
screen reader when the focus is so moved. The screen reader is supposed to know whether this is something that its users need to be advised of. If this
scenario is followed, Jaws will alert the user that the focus is in the middle
of the page.
In the future we may be able to get something into the scripting interface where moving the focus can be intercepted by the assistive technology and inhibited or
forced to go through a confirm step. One may even be able to do this today if
the AT injects a capturing listener at the root. I don't recall getting a clear
answer on that. Then we get into stacking order problems like the screen driver issues.
But for now what we have asked for is an
event that tells the AT the focus has moved and the AT can inspect where it is
and alert the user to the fact that if they want to start at the top they have to move there first.
It also may be an issue for the DOM object model - allowing a script to move and control the focus and bounce you around the page without your knowledge.
Yes this is something for us to work on, but we won't get the first thing we think
of implemented right away.

Interesting issue. What about the issue of client side form validation?
when the form is validated and, say, the third field contains invalid data,
in that case, is it assisting usability to put the focus on the first field
where the data needs to be edited? How should this be handled? Just ignore
using focus?

P.S. I?ve been missing in action on these lists for a while, but hope to be
able to contribute again (whilst I have the time and opportunity).
