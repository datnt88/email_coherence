The caption for Example 24 currently reads
'Schema for example 23'
I know XML Schema has a reputation for being verbose but a 124 line schema
to describe a 4 line instance is going too far :-)
The caption *should* read
'Schema for example 22'
which is at least a 24 line instance :-)

Thanks for spotting that one; my mistake!
