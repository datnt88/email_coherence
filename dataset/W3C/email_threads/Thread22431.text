Hi,
Do any of you know of a DOM-based editor,
that is an editor entirely based on DOM?
Any editing operations would be applied to
the document by invoking DOM operations.
Even though the DOM event propagation mechanism
is of yet unspecified (isn't it?), this editor,
should update its presentation of the document
only when receiving events from the DOM.

Hi!
I am new to this list, and have read the DOM spec., but
not yet all of the recent mails in the mail-archive.
I'm sorry if I ask any trivial questions in this mail.
I know of one being planned :) ... Explanation follows...
I work on the berlin project: http://www.berlin-consortium.org
We use CORBA, and I have written an API in OMG IDL for storing
attributed text etc. - similar to the DOM spec., except DOM
looks more powerful.
We intend to use DOM instead. Berlin is GPL'ed, so I have
two questions:
1) Is it legal for us to implement DOM and distribute it
under GPL/LGPL?
2) Is it legal for us to put the DOM IDL-files in our
cvs repository, and just compile everything with berlin, and
distribute it all under GPL/LGPL?
We intend to write text-widgets that use the DOM API as
part of Berlin. So your DOM editor could easily be implemented
in Berlin, when our GUI-stuff is ready for it.
Some berlin people (myself included) have expressed interest
in an editor like this, with multiuser support etc.
And BTW: I support the idea of character position markers
a cursor position proposed by Ray Whitmer.

Yes.
I believe yes, though I should note that the current IDL has a
number of problems, and is susceptible to change.
That's OK... it's easy to rearrange code - it takes more
time to implement it.
I will start a GPL implementation of DOM right about now then ;)
