NOT REACHED
Sheesh, the one meeting of the year I couldn't attend...
In order to complete this action, I will be traveling to Bristol sometime
between Jan. 1 and Jan. 6.
So all of you at HP Labs better watch out!
[ "Aaron Swartz" ; mailto:me@aaronsw.com ; http://www.aaronsw.com/ ]
I have informed security! :)

Excellent; see you in the new year then!
jan grant, ILRT, University of Bristol. http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/
Hang on, wasn't he holding a wooden parrot? No! It was a porcelain owl.
At this time of the year, HP Labs:
"better watch out, better not cry,
better not pout, I'm telling you why,
Santa Claus is coming to town"
Tell security not to shoot Santa when he tries to come down the chimney.
Ho! Ho! Ho!

It's not much of an issue now that HP Labs has transitioned to RDF
proof-based authentication. I've collected a few, um, assertions at the past
few face-to-faces that should do the trick nicely. ;-)
[ "Aaron Swartz" ; mailto:me@aaronsw.com ; http://www.aaronsw.com/ ]
Is this a Use Case that could go into the Primer? (Sounds like some of these assertions
might need to go beyond the power of RDF to express. Like a rule: "if he has a black
beard rather than a white one, he's not Santa.")
