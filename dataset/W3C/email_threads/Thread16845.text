sorry, my mistake in choice of terminology. These rollovers are designed to
show extra text/images away from the actual link. Eric Meyer calls them
pop-ups but that term doesn't seem right either. For an example take a look
at http://www.meyerweb.com/eric/css/edge/popups/demo.html and put your mouse
(if, indeed, you use a mouse) over the links. Can't see how to make it work
with a keyboard though :(
regards
Julian

On a similar theme Mr Meyer also has a way of creating pure
css roll-overs
that look great for the browsers that support it but I'm
wondering how they
will 'sound' in a screen-reader and look in a text-browser.
They work thus:
a href="path/to/page.htm" link text span roll-over text /span /a
the span is set to display:none and then using a:hover it
is set to
display:block with fixed positioning. My first thought is
that the roll-over
text will get read out in screen-readers as part of the
link text because it
is contained within the a tags but I can't see another
way of creating the
same effect that would be accessible. Any ideas?
I've always assumed that the most accessible way of doing
rollovers was to use css classes, which change
onmouseover/onmouseout onblur/onfocus, which according to the
guidelines is acceptable, as it'll work in browsers that
support javascript and if it's turned off, it doesn't affect
the navigation.
Is this the wrong method?
Kind Regards,
Andy

They have the negative characteristics of popup windows that lead to
the WCAG guideline that popups should be not be used unless the users
can be expected to be able to globally disable them in their browser
configuration.
