Hi all,
I am new to the list, so apoligies if this has been dealt with before.
I did search the archives but couldn't find anything.
I have a situation where double spaces in a URL are being converted to a
single space. If I have fix-uri on, then it gets converted to a single
%20. No other options appear to make any difference at all.
I am using TidyATL 1.0.0.1 and can reproduce this using TidyUI.
Example:
Becomes either
Or
In both cases the link is now broken. It appears to have exactly the
same issue with a tags.
Any advice appreciated.
Thanks
Ben
The link was broken already, since spaces aren't allowed in URIs. Fix
the spaces (replace with %20) with something else before running
Tidy.
Yes, but shouldn't the two spaces be replaced with two %20 rather than
one?
Thanks
Ben
Hi Ben,
I think you will find it difficult to maintain double spaces anywhere with
Tidy as the parser condenses whitespace up front.
No matter, Fred is right. Just use %20 for each space within a URL.
IE has always done this for you automatically. It is only recently that
Netscape and Opera started escaping URLs before a GET. Not sure about
Konqueror.
take it easy,

`--literal-attributes yes` will preserve your spaces.
