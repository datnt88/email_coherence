There are to-go-versions of my docs now at (same URLs as before)
These have edits made in response to recent points raised by Peter,
most notably some of the proofs are rewritten and there are some
quick fixes to the Lbase treatment of strings and 'peculiar' names,
such as names starting with '(' or including whitespace.
This version has the rdfD4 rule removed and a consistency comment
added in its place.; that seems consistent with the majority view on
how best to handle this.
I can't do any more to these before Wednesday.
For some reason, the pubrules checker thinks that there is something
wrong with the boilerplate, but it seems to have all the links and
things that the checker says are missing, all cut-and-pasted from
docs that the checker was OK with. The other filters are OK.

Yes it's very fussy - concepts gets through - I was following Frank's msg.
I suggest that whoever picks up on semantics SOTD copies it from concepts
or primer.
Guessing: the problem with DanBri's boiler plate was that a paragraph was
required to be in em and wasn't.

There are lots of other possible (and similarly innocuous) problems. I
just put the new boilerplate into Primer (mostly copied from the latest
Concepts), and it now complains about the fact that the word "last call"
appears, but there's no ending date (however, it says you can ignore
it).

Oh yes - I had forgotten that one - that just has to be ignored.
