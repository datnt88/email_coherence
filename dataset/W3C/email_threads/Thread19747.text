How do I run Amaya on Windows NT?
I've downloaded the archive and unpacked it. I haven't found any
instructions (either on the site or in the archive) that suggest I need
to do anything else. But when I try to run Amaya.exe, nothing happens.
(Watching in Task Manager shows that it runs for a few seconds and then
goes away.)
If it's any help: System is NT Workstation 4, service pack 3; hardware
is P/100, 40 MB RAM.

Do you try to start Amaya on a local page ?
To do so, please edit the file Thot/config/THOT.INI and add the name
of a local page in the line HOME_PAGE like
HOME_PAGE=c:\Thot\amaya\HOTLIST.HTML
In the current release, Amaya tries to fetch the initial page through the
Net and if it meets problems with the Net, it crashes.
In next release there'll be a local welcome page.
Hope this hepls

I've tried that, but it doesn't make any difference. It still won't run.

Could you check that the directory c:\tmp exists. If it doesn't exist Amaya
cannot
start.
Next Monday, we'll publish a new public release 1.1b. I hope this release will
solve your
problem.

Irene.
Yes, it exists.
OK, I'll give that a try.
