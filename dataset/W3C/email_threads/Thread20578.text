when I select output on U.S. size paper, the top margin is too large: 2.25"
(5.75cent). Putting style body {margin-top: 0em} /style in the header
didn't help.
Amaya 6.2 from 8 July 2002 on Linux (from rpm) utilized.

We don't have U.S. size paper to test it. You can probably made some experiment
by saving the Postscript into a file and changing the value.
What value do you suggest?
Irene.
I suggest a tiny top margin, eg, 0.8cent (which Mozilla 1.0 uses; i just
measured). If larger margins are desired, the user can use CSS' margin-top
setting to specify.
