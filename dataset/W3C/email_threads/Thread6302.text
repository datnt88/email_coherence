Folks,
There has been some discussion on resolving the issues on the media-type
document. I would like to have a concall on Friday morning or Monday
morning to resolve the issues if most of you are available. Please send
me your times.
I have converted the document to the w3c spec style. I will post it
today after the f2f meeting I am attending. The current issues are
listed in the document and I would like to separate them out before we
commit to cvs. Those of you who dealt with w3c specs in cvs (Gudge?), I
would appreciate if you could please send me private email indicating
the document dtd/xslt style sheets to use for keeping track of issues.
Thanks.

Unfortunately, I have meetings all friday morning, and will be on the
road Monday.
Would Thursday any time work?

I am fully booked friday morning (PST).
Monday morning (PST) anytime is fine with me.

Morning is bad. Any time in the afternoon will work for me. Others?

Another concall scheduling nightmare.
Afternoon is fine with me.

That won't work for Gudge; it's already after 9PM there...
I'd suggest next week; Thursday and Friday are good for me.

They are doable for me, too.
Can you all send me available times for those two days, specifically
mornings?? I will try to schedule this as early as possible in the day
so that Gudge can dial in.
Thanks!.
