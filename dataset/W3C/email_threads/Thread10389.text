Overall, looks great Jeremy.
A few questions:
1. In addition to changes related to octets, did we not also address
the concerns brought forward by I18N about the nature of the
value space of rdf:XMLLiteral, making clarifications to the
definition of rdf:XMLLiteral to that end, as well as address
the relationships between XML literals, plain literals without
lang tag, and xsd:string? (i.e. the idea of conversion versus equality)
2. In your table at the end, it seems to me that the value for
"[avoid] an RDF-specific solution [to the problem of] XML [...] context"
for "Normal Untyped Literal" and "Special typed literal" should be "No",
since for both, the form of expression of contextual information is
RDF-specific. ???
Cheers,

Yes adding that would improve it.
I believe those two options are adequately ruled out by other rows.
I think arguments could be made for Yes, and prefer to concede those in
advance rather than be drawn towards a rathole.
The only serious other contender, in my opinion, is the wrapper hack in
syntax, possibly only when the xml:lang is anything other than "". I think
we should have that specified as the alternative design and go to CR asking
for implementor feedback between those two designs, using the 'at risk'
phaseolgy. While that does not seem to be precisely what the process
document has in mind, that is what OWL have done.

Fair enough.

Reagle has repeatedly rebutted this claim, saying that the c14n spec
states that applications should customize to suit there needs.
Does he have a point?
