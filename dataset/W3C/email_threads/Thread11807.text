I believe that the issue of mouseless manipulation
(keyboard/voiceinput/whatever) is so important as to be included
specifically in our document despite the fact that referred-to items may
specify it.
One of the most important parts about our work is that we hope to
encourage tools that are competitively usable by PWDs since they are
significantly underemployed and could readily get utilized as web
builders if the tools available factored them in. How important is this
to us - very. There is a growing shortage of competent techno-folk (you
just can't get good help anymore!) and the "Promise of the Web" can best
be fuliflled by folks who create it, not just those who use it.
Of course it is vital that authoring tools produce accessible output but
it is way past time that we shut out this section of the population by
making efforts to enable them to to use the tools somehow be considered
of "lower priority" - this is unacceptable not only to me but also to
"the people" as expressed in a series of laws *requiring* accessibility
- not just in the U.S. but all over the world.

ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE
At the face to face meeting we resolved to highlight the most important
points of general accessible software design in the introduction to what
is now section 3, and to make it clear that many of the basic requirements
were dealt with in other documents to which we would refer.
Are you proposing this addendum as part of such an introduction (which I
think is a sensible opint to include)? This is the assumption I am using
in drawing up the agenda.
I would add to mouseless operation the requirement to implement
appropriate interfaces for assistive technologies, and the requirement to
implement software in accordance with Operating System conventions.
The other point I think is important is the need to have a User Interface
which is not dependent on visual rendering. As well as being covered in
other guidelines it seems that this is implicit in the requirements
for authoring-tool specific needs, so I would propose not including this
point in such an introduction.

CMcCN: "Are you proposing this addendum as part of such an introduction"
WL:: I was at first proposing it as either that or as a checkpoint but
since I've looked in vain for strong language in UAGL regarding this
matter I'm leaning towards the latter.
Alan Cantor replied to my IG post that true mouselessness is pretty much
an unrealized dream, a point he deals with at:
We can still ask and since I find it a high priority for both blind or
quadraplegic or other folks who can't mouse...
CMcCN: "I would add to mouseless operation the requirement to implement
appropriate interfaces for assistive technologies, and the requirement
to implement software in accordance with Operating System conventions."
WL:: OTOH I think these are well covered in referenced documents

CMN: Certainly. I was imagining a (longish) sentence in the introduction
which touched on all these points, and referred to other documents.
