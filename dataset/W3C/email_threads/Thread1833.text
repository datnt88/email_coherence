Hi,
In the RFC , workspace is defined to be a collection , but isn't it actually a "scratch" pad on which first all changes are done and then later merged with the "main" branch/stream ? My question is , would this workspace be visible through a PROPFIND request or a
normal directory listing ?
warm regards,
Vikram
When the workspace feature is supported, a workspace
is the primary way that the contents of the repository
is accessed, so there will be a workspace for viewing
the "main branch", as well as "scratch" workspaces for
anyone that wants a separate stable environment.
Wrt to your particular question, yes, since
a workspace is a collection, it is visible through
a PROPFIND request (I'm not sure what you mean by a
"normal directory listing", but the answer is probably
"yes" for that as well:-).
If it weren't, how would your client access the information
in it?
Cheers,
Geoff

Hi,
When it is said that a vcr is created in a workspace by VERSION-CONTROL request and initialized with another version from some other version history , does that mean that
this vcr also "point's" to the same version (and thus is part of the same tree ) or is altogether
new with it's own vr and history (of that vr).
e.g:
VERSION-CONTROL /foo.html HTTP/1.1
Host: ...
so is foo.html pointing to ver/3 or is totally new with it's vr having history as v1 ?
I believe it is the latter , but I am quite confused at this moment to reason.
Thanks a lot,
Vikram
VERSION-CONTROL with a specific version argument creates
a VCR that refers to the existing version and its version
history. This is what lets multiple workspaces work on the
same version history concurrently. See postcondition
DAV:new-version-controlled-resource:
"a new version-controlled resource exists at the request-URL whose
DAV:checked-in property identifies that version"
