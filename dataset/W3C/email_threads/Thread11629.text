Hello,
I've finished following Japanese translation:
1. W3C Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 Recommendation
url: http://fuji.u-shizuoka-ken.ac.jp/~ishikawa/authorin.htm
2. W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 Recommendation
url. http://fuji.u-shizuoka-ken.ac.jp/~ishikawa/waipagej.htm
3. W3C User Agent Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 Proposed Recommendation
url: http://fuji.u-shizuoka-ken.ac.jp/~ishikawa/uaag10-j.htm
Please check if there is anything wrong.
p.s.
I translate User Agent Guideline 1.0 Recommendation as soon as it is
released.
Regards
Jun Ishikawa
Hello Jun,
Many thanks for your translations.
They look okay, except for two points (in all three documents):
- The W3C icon is broken. Please set src="http://www.w3.org/Icons/w3c_home".
- Please say that the translation may contain errors, as requested in
Many thanks in advance and kind regards, Martin.

Hello Martin,
Thank you for comment.
It's fixed now.
Disclaimer is already mentioned in Japanese.
Is it better to mention it in English as well?

Hello Jun,
Many thanks for your quick answer.
Nice.
It's not a problem of English or Japanese, it's that the disclaimer
doesn't say all the things it should say. From:
2.Prominently disclose in the target language the following 3 items:
1.the original URL, the status of the document,
and its original copyright notice.
2.that the normative version of the specification is
the English version found at the W3C site.
3.that the translated document may contain errors from the
translation.
Point 1 is done inside the translation (by just translating the original).
Point 2 is done by you in the Note at the beginning.
Point 3 is missing. It can be added e.g. as
[everybody, please excuse me to use Japanese here]
x
in http://www2.airnet.ne.jp/sardine/docs/WD-xhtml-basic-20000210/Overview.html,
or as x ,
x
in http://www.trl.ibm.co.jp/projects/xml/xmlschema-0j.html,
or however you like.
Regards, Martin.
