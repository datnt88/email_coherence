The description of the insert function says:
"The value returned by the function consists of all items of $target
whose index is less than or equal to N, followed by all items of
$inserts, followed by the remaining elements of $target, in that
sequence."
So, that would mean that
insert( (1, 2, 3), 2, ("x", "y"))
would return
(1, 2, "x", "y", 3)
That doesn't seem intuitive to me; I would expect it to be inserted one
position earlier:
(1, "x", "y", 2, 3)
Should the text say "less than N" instead of "less than or equal to N",
or was that deliberate?

The current specification inserts the new items after the Nth item of the
existing sequence. You want to insert the new items before the Nth item of
the existing sequence. It's not clear to me that this is an improvement: the
choice seems essentially arbitrary.

It seems to me that it's best to choose the one that most people would
find intuitive. In my experience, I generally expect that if you say
you want to insert something at the N position, it becomes the Nth item.
But, of course, my experience could be different from others, or it
could be that it's simply not worth changing at this point.
Thanks,
