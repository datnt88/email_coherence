I tried to read my page I was messing with in version 6.4, and 7.1 bombs
out with this error.

Hello Clint,
What is the uri of your page, please
Thanks,
Laurent Carcone
It's possible the page is a little malformed:
www.0lsen.net/clint
I'm experimenting with CSS (and doing badly, I might add)...

Your page did not crash on my Amaya 7.1 Dec12 2002
(amaya/7.1 libwww/5.3.1).
And your page is "Tentatively Validates As HTML 4.01
Transitional" :
You need to add the doctype at the top, eg:
!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01
Transitional//EN"
And your CSS is fine too:
Rgards.

I am using Amaya 7.1 Dec12 2002
(amaya/7.1 libwww/5.3.1) on Windows XP.
Amaya crashes on http://mail.yahoo.co.jp.
1.
I typed "mail.yahoo.co.jp" in the address bar and
press enter. Once it got there, amaya disappeared
(crashed).
But, after one or two crashes, the page will show up.
2.
If the yahoo mail login page showed up. It will crash
again if you try to leave the page by clicked the
"back" button on amaya, or click any link in the page,
or login the account.

Hi:
Thanks for the note. I was messing around with the W3C validator for
various specs.
The 'doing badly' was trying to come up with a CSS that would replace using
tables for rendering layout presentation. I was having difficulty finding
_anything_ that would render the same under Amaya, Mozilla, and Internut
Exploder. I must say I'm not encouraged by what I've seen so far.
