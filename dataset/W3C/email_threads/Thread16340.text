Was not Al Gore's father or grandfather blind?

(apologies for the salutationary pun!)
i don't know about al gore's grandfather, either, but i think that his father
(a senator from tennessee) did suffer vision loss in later life -- how severe
that loss was i don't know, but i do know that the recently elected president
of indonesia is blind... there was an interesting profile of him in the new
york times a few weeks ago, and, while his vision loss didn't seem to be raised
as an issue during his eleventh hour campaign, there does appear to be some
controversy amongst pundits and opposition politicians in indonesia as to
whether he is totally blind or whether he retains any gross black/white
perception, as he, himself, has claimed, ever since returning from the U.S.
last year after having eye surgery... the article did mention that he is led
by an assistant everywhere he goes -- including inside his own home...
oh, and, not that i was planning on voting for him anyway, but if al gore
thinks that Narrator allows a blind individual to interact with a computer in a
meaningful way, he's not fit to hold any office, much less that of president of
the united states!
as for the basis for that last contention, according to the documentation
available from (long wrapping URL warning):
verview.htm

Narrator is designed to work with Notepad, WordPad, Control Panel, Microsoft
Internet Explorer 5.0, some parts of Windows 2000 setup, and the Windows 2000
desktop. Narrator may not read words aloud correctly in other programs.

so, unless you plan on working in an office which only uses NotePad and
WordPad, and you only need to access pages on the internet or the company
intranet that Narrator can voice, Narrator isn't what the filename in the
above-listed URL suggests it is...
hmm... guess it couldn't be used in a single browser intranet either -- a
least not if that single browser happens not to be MSIE 5...
what a strange world it is that we inhabit -- microsoft employees have been
telling me and countless others that they aren't in the adaptive technology
business, and that they don't want to put AT manufacturers out of business, and
that Narrator isn't intended to function as a screen reader, but then, why the
sudden media blitz about Narrator with the focus clearly on its benefit to
blind users? why the use of the term "screen reader" in the above-listed URL?
at least the content of the pages pertaining to Narrator refer to it only as
quote a text-to-speech utility for users who are blind or have low vision
unquote, but then again, isn't that a common description of a screen reader?
oh, and one last tie-in to another thread -- according to the information at
the microsoft enable site, Narrator is not available for all languages...

Gregory -
Yes, the PR folks at Microsoft (not always those who are in the
Accessibility &amp; Disabilities Group) do like to show off what Microsoft has
done. Many times they do not understand the positions that the MS A&amp;DG has
taken (i.e. that Narrator is not a full functioning screen reader, or that
MS does not want to squash AT vendors), or the sensitivity that the
community has towards Microsoft's efforts. So they do a demo and try to show
what are "cool" features of Windows 2000, and they show that demo in it's
best possible light, and the recipient of that demo gets a good impression.
The reason that Narrator is not available in all languages is that there
aren't software TTS engines available for all languages...developing a TTS
engine is no small task (even for a big company like MS).

In my opinion, there are positive benefits to Microsoft's PR people
doing this, even if Microsoft's product is exceedingly crappy (I'm
not saying it is or isn't; I'm not a user!).
From the standpoint of an educator of web designers (and web decision
makers), there is great value in -anyone- getting out the message
that people like Gregory or David even exist! I've been AMAZED at
how many web designers I've spoken with have stared at me blankly
and uncomprehendingly when I've asked my standard opener question,
"Hi, I'm Kynn, do you know if your site is accessible to people with
disabilities?" Many of them have told me outright that they've never
even HEARD of blind people using computers nor could they POSSIBLY
imagine them trying to access a web page.
So greater awareness (AWARE-ness?) of the issue is obviously a
plus, and silly demos like Al Gore playing with a screen magnifier
can help impress upon the public consciousness the idea of blind
folks using computers.
With the good there's sometimes the bad, though -- and this can
happen even with product demonstrations of "good" accessibility
software. If someone sees a demonstration they may conclude,
incorrectly, that assistive technologies are all that's needed --
because they saw this amazing new screenreader on teevee last night,
they think the problem has been solved! The web is now accessible,
hurrah, there is much rejoicing!
Naturally, these folks need their awareness raised in a different
direction -- they need the question, "ah, so _does_ your web site
work with assistive technology? do you know one way or the other?
AOL's didn't...and they got a lawsuit filed because of that."
Raising awareness can be hard work sometimes!
