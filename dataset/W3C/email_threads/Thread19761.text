Hi,
after updating from amaya 1.1a to 1.1b i encountered some problems.
First amaya does not translate german umlauts (instaed of
"aktivit&amp;auml;t" it outputs "aktivit?t".
Also it has problems with the pre tags. Instead of newlines i get
something like pre test~Jtest~Jtest /pre (correct output should
be :
pre test
test
test /pre
Thanks
Uli

Hi Ulrich,
In-reply-to: Your message of Tue, 04 Nov 1997 10:06:02 +0100."
It seems that you have a wrong installation. I tried the Linux version and
met no problem with this character (I inserted a ? and saved the file; Amaya
output &amp;auml;t)
Same experiment and the result was correct:
pre test
test
test /pre
Could you reload your Linux version form the server
Regards
Irene.
Hi,
i have reload the binary from your server and installed all from
scratch.
But i have the nearly the same problems, but now amaya displays this
line
correct (but not in the structure view) but not all other browsers like
lynx or netscape. Afther a look on the generated code i found that the
new-lines in pre tags have the hex-code 0x8a instaed of 0x0a ? all other
newlines have the correct value 0x0a:
Here is the output of a line with "od -ax" :
0000260 74 8a 54 65 73 74 8a 3c 2f 70 72 65 3e 0a 3c 2f
t nl T e s t nl  / p r e  nl  /
Also when i view the test lines bewteen the pre -tag in the structure
view the view displays the tree words "test" in one line.
I'll try to compile amaya and see if the problem is also there.
