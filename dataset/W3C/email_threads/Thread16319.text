Subject: Fwd: AOL sued over accessibility
Sender: owner-hwg-business@hwg.org
A few weeks ago we had a thread on accessibility. Today I was forwarded
this by a friend of mine.
excerpts from November 4, 1999 New York Times:
"Lawsuit Says AOL Shuts Out the Blind"
By PAMELA MENDELS
"In a test of the idea that virtual spaces must by law be readily accessible
to people with disabilities, a major organization representing the blind
filed suit against America Online Inc. on Thursday, saying that its online
service is almost impossible for blind people to use."

Definitely something to think about.

How can the NFB justify such a legal action when the organization itself
generates funding from inaccessible web sites. Take a look at
an online fund raising shopping service which they are linked into. It has
some of the same accessibility problems they are complaining about with AOL.
Interesting indeed. However, I could see some cases in which an
organization (say, the WAI) wants to take money from a supporter
whose web site is not yet accessible.
That said, the HTML Writers Guild has been considering a proposal
in which all our co-branded sites with outside partners are expected
to meet the same standards of accessibility that the Guild currently
requires from our own pages. I think other organizations should
consider this too.
