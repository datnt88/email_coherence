I very much appreciate that the "WCAG 1.0" Fact Sheet
(http://www.w3.org/1999/05/WCAG-REC-fact#text) goes so far at to say:
Text-only pages should not be necessary to ensure accessibility of Web
pages that follow the "Web Content Accessibility Guidelines," except in
very rare cases. In fact, text-only pages are frequently counterproductive
to accessibility since they tend to be kept less up-to-date than "primary
pages," or in some cases leave out information that is on primary pages.
Many sites that have made a commitment to accessibility in the past have
used text-only pages as a solution; however, by following these guidelines
it should be unnecessary in almost all cases, or even inadvisable, to set
up and maintain a separate set of text-only pages.
I agree with all of the above. I accept it as true. Now, how do I prove
it to others who would advocate for text-only pages? Can anyone point to
me to URLs that present evidence that "text-only" pages are usually NOT in
parallel with the default version? Is there any published research that
the "text-only" approach, while perhaps having noble intent, is
counter-productive?
We had an interested thread here not long ago (starting with
the case was made that "text-only" did not mean accessible anyway! Is this
a consensus position that is documented any where?
Thank you very much.

Bruce,
I'm glad someone is reading the FAQ!
Would be nice to have research on this, but the statement in the FAQ was
based on a long history of anecdotal comments on this from many people
working in the field, rather than research. As an example from my
experience, I'd reviewed several US federal agency sites whose text-only
sites were unusable -- a brief series of outdated one-word links, which
were supposed to be equivalent to detailed blurbs on bit-mapped links on
the "real" home page, and which led right back to... very inaccessible
lower-level pages in the site.
I just checked back on those sites, they're cleaned up now, and so wouldn't
be good "bad" examples.
I get a lot of press queries about how "the additional burden of
maintaining text-only sites is a reason why accessibility is too much of
burden"... as well as confusion that text-only sites, or generally dull and
boring sites, are what we are advocating for; so this seems important to
clear up.
On your last question, whether the position that "text-only isn't
necessarily accessible" is well documented, hmmm, not sure that it is. We
are collecting additional questions for future FAQ's; this might be good to
expand on.

Excellent points from Judy, especially the fact that it's
hard to find reliable "bad examples!" Usually by the time
we've found them, we've also told them what's wrong and they've
fixed the problem! (Those sneaky webmasters!)
As far as text-only being _less_ accessible, there's a good
argument to be made that structural content is preferable to
non-structured. While you can ASSUME some structure in plain
text, structured HTML makes it a LOT easier to do things like
pull out the headers or identify tabular data (not to mention
the amount of rich metadata that can be included with markup).
This is a logical, not empirical, argument for markup being
more accessible than plain text. I don't feel that plain,
unmarked text (as web pages) serve anyone's needs, not the
majority users nor those with special considerations!

Text-only sites assume that people can either make use of everything that a
webmaster can work out how to include, or that they can use nothing but text.
In fact this is a long way from the case. Many people who are deaf or have
cognitive impairments gain little and lose a lot from a text-only site, and
would be better served by a richer site which followed the guidelines,
especially in regards to structure and organisation of a site. Many blind
users can benefit from audio, which may be included in the multimedia version
and left out of the text-only version. People who have difficulty with
colour seperation do not need to have everything reduced to text, they just
need high contrast.
These are examples of why the guidelines do not promote the use of a
text-only site. The web allows the creation of rich, creatively designed
websites which are accessible to people with a wide variety of disabilities
(as well as others who are using a wide variety of devices - small mobile
devices can often deal with simple graphics, but cannot render large complex
ones, etc)

Well, as my first post ever to the group... I've been debating for quite
some time and had actually made up my mind to create a "text-only"
version of my company's site. However, it *would* be markup, and would
be designed specifically for people with disabilities -- not just a
"text-only" version in the strictist sense of the term.
One blind individual who I pitched this idea to loved it, and will be
testing it once it's complete.
HOWEVER, my other question is: where does XML fit into all this? Isn't
it supposed to be the future of Web pages? Once a page is created in
XML, a browser on any platform or device can render it, hence making it
accessible to everyone (this is the idea, anyway). I have seen no
discussion of XML in this group. What say you all? :)
Thanks.

A blind individual and a deaf individual and a person with mobility problems
and a group of people who suffer from cognitive impairments may have very
different needs, which would be better served by a single version which
transforms gracefully across media, and provides orientation, simplicity and
consistency as appropriate.
Testing by individuals, or with a variety of browsers, is a good way to
understand the types of problems that may arise. Without exhaustive testing
across a range of people with various disabilities and across a range of
technologies it is not a test of whether a site is accessible, merely whether
it is accessible to a certain group of users.
is my general 2c on that topic. For XML...
A page created in XML is simply a page - it depends on how it was done. The
same rules apply as with HTML - device independence, markup of structure
explicitly rather than by presentation conventions, etc. XML allows these,
but as with any technology sufficiently powerful to be useful it also allows
completely inaccessible design. When writing XML applications follow the Web
Content Accessibility Guidelines.
Which makes 4 cents worth of my personal opinion. Enough for now I think.

I agree that a text-only site would be a disservice to the majority of
users, and less accessible to many, if it replaced the fully-formatted site,
or did not contain all the information, or was not kept up-to-date. However,
it seems to me that a parallel text-only site adds considerable value when
those pitfalls are avoided.
The Accessibility and Disabilities Group at Microsoft has an automated
system that produces each page in two formats, one fully formatted and one
that is text-only. This ensures that both have the same content and neither
gets out of date. The text-only page provides an accessible experience with
older browsers that don't allow the user to override author colors, fonts,
and font sizes, or don't show the entire ALT text when images are turned
off. It also provides an accessible experience for users running
combinations of browser and screen reader that fail to communicate the
organization of tables and frames; that can be caused either by a limitation
in either the browser or the screen reader, and this still applies to most
blind users at this time. Finally, for blind users running browsers that
don't understand the convention for identifying navigation bars, it moves
the navigation links that are standard on every page to the end instead of
the beginning.
Right now I only see two ways to provide equal accessibility for users
running older software, one is to provide a version that leaves out certain
things as described above, and the other is to dynamically customize the
pages for every user on the fly. In both cases you're creating a text-only
version, it's just whether you do it when the page changes or every time the
user views a page. The former greatly reduces the burden on heavily used
servers.
Additional details about the production of our site and why we do what we do
is on http://microsoft.com/enable/about.htm.
Also note that we now provide a hotkey that will switch you back and forth
between the fully-formatted and text-only versions of the current page,
allowing more users to rely on the formatted version and switch to text-only
temporarily when they hit something that is difficult for them to read.
(Naturally, though, that hotkey is only available to people running modern
browsers.)
Thanks,
Greg

It seems as though the argument _against_ having a text-only version is
merely furthering my point. Of course it makes sense to have an
automated system that will output the appropriate model of the page to
each user (as in Microsoft's case). But again, that is essentially a
"text-only" copy. I understand that a well-designed site in valid HTML
using WAI recommendations is supposed to be accessible to all. But this
is my point (not for me, because I agree with most of you, which is why
I subscribed to this list in the first place): most Webmasters don't
have the time nor inclination to learn what they need to learn to make
valid, accessible Web pages. They've been doing it for so long that
they slip into whatever works to make the page look good quickly and
forget the rest.
I _do_ have the time and inclination to learn how to do it right; I
still am NOT designing valid pages yet, because I simply have more to
learn. However, this is the major pitfall of the whole issue (the crux
of the problem, in Monty Python-ese). Webmasters think that all these
new Web regulations will make their job harder -- and I believe it
will!! That's the whole point. They *must* learn how to do it right if
they are going to design accessible pages. And it WILL be harder, at
first. I know, because I'm one of those people! An example follows in
my next question...
Question #2: And now for something completely different.
I was going to separate this into an entirely different thread, but it
relates to what I just said. I have seen on numerous pages the use of a
1-pixel by 1-pixel transparent GIF to use as a spacer (especially in
tables, but not exclusively). I was just reading an article on c|net's
Builder.com about how the use of TABLE has taken on a whole new
purpose, one that it wasn't designed for. Many people are using this
1-pixel transparent GIF to force a table to a certain width or height,
or even just for color or design sake. Go to http://www.voyager.net
(search for pixel.gif in the source) for an example.
This has been a perfect solution for designing a page to look the way
you want (I've even used this method). However, this is very bad for
accessibility. Yet another example of change that lots of Webmasters
won't appreciate.
Please don't misunderstand me, I am all for accessibility. I'm just
stating the plain fact that change is hard. It will take a while for
this to become successful.

How do you design specifically _for_ people with disabilities,
and why would you design your other pages otherwise?
The cornerstones of the web are interoperability and platform
independence; why would you want to waste so much time designing
_for_ anyone in particular? Design for everyone, to the standards
(including WCAG), and everyone can use your one site, not just
"people with disabilities". (Especially not all people with
disabilities are the same!)

I don't think maintenance is much of an issue in situations where production
is sufficiently automated. The issue is about creating seperate classes of
site - although text-and-audio only serves blind users, and text only serves
deaf blind users, they do not address the needs of other groups such as
people with cognitive impairments. It is indeed true that the situation is
one of creating a site which has multiple formats, as Greg pointed out. The
problem is that removal of some accessibility barriers in one format, and
some in another, can often allow some barriers to remain unnoticed in both
formats. In addition there is the very real possibility of creating a
separate but inferior site for some groups of people, to a much greater
extent than their needs (or state of the technology) dictate.
The idea of an accessible design is that it can be rendered as text only, but
need not be. Some of the newer features of HTML - the OBJECT element which
allows for a cascade of different types of object, CSS positioning and
formatting which gives the author great power in crafting the rendering of a
website while allowing the user to ensure that their needs are met, are
examples. [* My prediction...*] As XML applications which have been designed
from the ground up to be accessible become more common, along with browsers
which can render them appropriately for users, the idea of a "text-only"
version of a site will seem more and more like an evolutionary dead end which
denies the richest possible experience available to users, and we will see
much more accessible sites which are written to take advantage of the various
methods for user selection of suitable content types.
With regards to a hot-key to switch between versions, which is only
accessible to newer browsers (i assume it is an HTML Accesskey), why not add
a link and use display:none to hide it, for compatibility with older
browsers? (Until Lynx stops being the browser of last resort for people who
are blind, for example. This is just an idle thought - I appreciate that
there is also value in pushing people towards adopting better technology
where possible.)
And to answer Brain's question, the general mission of WAI is to provide
accessibility for people with disabilities. Although there are side benefits
for all kinds of other areas (robots, mobile devices, internationalisation,
etc.) work which is directed at those other areas is beyond the scope of the
current guidelines activities as I understand them.

The case in point is an interesting one. There is no real problem caused by
the use of spacer gifs, so long as they are transparent (they look pretty
odd if they are white, and the user has a black background for high
contrast, but that's the designer's misfortune) and have appropriate
equivalent content - in this case alt="".
That satisfies the guidelines.
The use of tables is a bit trickier. There are particular problems caused by
tables because screen-reading technology is only beginning to cope, and not
all users have up-to-date browser/screenreader combinations. (Not surprising,
given the cost involved.) The most widely available solution is Lynx, which
runs on almost every platform, and can be converted to speech or braille
reliably. It simply unwraps the table, so unless there has been some
extraordinary work done to make the table not linearise properly (I have seen
examples of this, but it is generally easy to avoid) the user can get at the
content but loses much of the structural relationship implied - in particular
lynx does not provide any way to view the document by columns - the best
assistive technology solutuon I know for non-visual users is W3 - the
browser package for emacs, and it has problems with nested tables. The use of
tables for layout is also contrary to the design philosophy behind HTML and
CSS. This is really an example of people "doing things the wrong way".
I think it is true that many web designers do not really understand their
field, and I am somewhat surprised that there is so much of a market for
their limited and flawed skills. I realise that everyone needs to learn from
the beginning, but I would be happier if people were expected to have learned
more before they take on the important task of designing an information
space, particularly in important areas like government services and
information, and the ability to participate in regular commercial activity.
So I applaud your taking the time to grapple with the complexities of this
field, and I offer the encouragement that this isn't as hard as brain surgery
(so far as I know) or rocket science...

Designing a site in such a way that people get the material which is suited
to them is not (in the general case) the same as making a text-only version.
For a deaf-blind user, it is likely that the average website is used in a
text-only manner. For a blind user, there is generally no reason to exclude
the use of audio content, and it is often extremely helpful (the difference
between computer-generated speech and recorded human speech is still very
substantial). For the deaf, captions or transcripts of audio material, and
visual representations of audio warnings are of critical importance. However,
good visual material is often far more helpful than text. For a person with
reading difficulties, having the graphics available as a screen-reader
renders the text is significantly diffferent from having to concentrate on
text with no other aids to comprehension.
It seems as though the argument _against_ having a text-only version is

Dear Jeff,
I am, understandably, following this thread closely. You raise valid
points in this post and the one earlier. I am sorry to say that I don't
follow what you mean by that "the argument _against_ having a text-only
version is merely furthering my point". To which point were you referring?
Do you have the luxury, as is the case with Microsoft, to generate ALL your
pages dynamically? If not, could you describe what policies/procedures you
will be putting in place to ensure that your "non-graphical" [Is this a
better term than "text-only"] pages will be kept up to date?
Kynn (and others) will argue that HTML is not that hard -- and that
accessible HTML is hardly more difficult to learn (nor to teach) than
inaccessible HTML. It really just involves a paradigm shift to realize
that the Web is NOT a print medium (it's an information medium). Of
course, these gestalt changes are very difficult for some folks.
The real challenge is with people who, for whatever reason, are not willing
to learn HTML. Creating WCAG 1.0 compliant pages with Microsoft or
Netscape (or Corel, or just about anybody else's) products IS (currently)
difficult (or even just not possible).
I would argue (and I think others on this list would agree) that by the
time a web author is learning tricks like hand-coding "spacer" GIFs s/he
can handle writing accessible HTML!
Bruce Bailey, DORS Webmaster
410/554-9211
P.S. I looked at the source code you cited. It seems to me that the
author is using pixel.gif as a kind of HR and not as spacer per se.
Also, take a look at URL:
Which is exactly on target with your "Question #2".
Two questions, one on the text-only issue and one about XML.
At the beginning of this thread it seemed the problem with "text-only" was
keeping them up to date. I understand this problem, and spent a considerable
effort at providing a text-only site that kept up to date, not by producing
copies, but by offering two seperate views of the same information. Now, I am
getting the feeling that the issue isn't maintainability- it seems to have
turned to some nebulous design issue.
I have tried my best (maybe it's not good enough eh?) to promote web
accessibility on all the projects I have worked on. I have studied the ins and
outs of HTML4, CSS, and WAI guidelines (again, probably not to the extent this
group would have one study) and fought to work with the new techniqies and
within the guidelines. The results have been clean, well organized sites that
stress accessibility to information beyond accessibility to blind, deaf and
mobility impaired users- the thing I stress to clients most often when
discussing accessibility is that accessibility comes down to the accessibility
of information, and that this includes all the ADA issues as well as information
architecture and general usability. Why isn't a text-only view of information
(not a text-only copy) which does not use visual or audio data as its core
elements now considered bad?
Second question regarding XML:
I remember there was something called XSL which I found very exciting especially
as related to web accessibility. The way I initially saw it, an XML document was
never "viewed" in a browser, but was a strictly formatted structured document
(probably written by a program) from which various things could be communicated
to either another program or a human user. But the human user would never "see"
the XML, would never come in contact with the structure of the document (unless
that was the purpose of the document (a table of contents as a poor example) or
the interface to the XML (a nested list view of the same table of contents whose
structure was defined in the XML- another poor example). I immediately realized
that an XML subset document (take SMIL for instance) could be presented in many
different ways with XSL- a series of paragraphs in a SMIL presentation could be
rendered one after the other down a page instead of being placed along a
timeline.
I was confused by "device independace, markup of structure explicity rather than
by presentation conventions" not seeing any presentation conventions belonging
in an XML document (except maybey presentation instructions kept in a
presentation element(s)). In this case, I would say the XML is not where the
accessibility is addressed but in the presentation of the data kept therein.
(accessible extensible stylesheets for example). A rhetorical question: Take the
vector graphics work- how would one present this information in a way accessible
to a blind user?
I hope I'm not overstating the obvious, I'm just concerened that I don't
understand "accessibility of XML documents", which seems like a very strange
concept.

Text-only question:
A text-only view is not an intrinsically bad thing. For some users it is
crucial. It is just not, by itself, the best way to do accessibility. You
seem to have captured the essential point very nicely - the crux is access to
information, not accessibility for a given group of users. I am probably
making a mountain out of a molehill - the point I am trying to make is that
in general a text-only view and an "anything goes" view is insufficient,
because it fails to cater for a variety of other common sets of requirements.
XML Question:
Again, I think you have understood it correctly. It is possible to write XML
and XSL in such a way that information is only available in a device-specific
way (for example specifying colours to convey different meanings, without
providing any way of knowing what the colours mean). Or SMIL could have been
written in such a way that textual alterntives, or audio alternatives, could
not be included. In the SVG case, it is possible to build images from
described objects, and for a non-graphic rendering device to interpret the
layout of the various pieces of an image and explain them. This requires that
the graphic is built in a way which allows this - it is possible to do
everything with explicit declaration of vectors, which is the graphics
equivalent of using nothing but styled Span elements in HTML in that it makes
it very difficult to guess the structure of the document.

Two questions, one on the text-only issue and one about XML.
At the beginning of this thread it seemed the problem with "text-only" was
keeping them up to date. I understand this problem, and spent a considerable
effort at providing a text-only site that kept up to date, not by producing
copies, but by offering two seperate views of the same information. Now, I am
getting the feeling that the issue isn't maintainability- it seems to have
turned to some nebulous design issue.
I have tried my best (maybe it's not good enough eh?) to promote web
accessibility on all the projects I have worked on. I have studied the ins and
outs of HTML4, CSS, and WAI guidelines (again, probably not to the extent this
group would have one study) and fought to work with the new techniqies and
within the guidelines. The results have been clean, well organized sites that
stress accessibility to information beyond accessibility to blind, deaf and
mobility impaired users- the thing I stress to clients most often when
discussing accessibility is that accessibility comes down to the accessibility
of information, and that this includes all the ADA issues as well as information
architecture and general usability. Why isn't a text-only view of information
(not a text-only copy) which does not use visual or audio data as its core
elements now considered bad?
Second question regarding XML:

That's one point, yes.
It's another issue, too. I (and others) maintain that properly
done HTML means accessible HTML, and that means no need for a
text-only copy.
Three words: "Separate. But. Equal." You will people who very
strongly consider the idea of "ghettoization" of the disabled to
be a worse sin than inaccessible pages. While I am not quite so
dogmatic about this, I can certainly see the point and I think
there is an implicit assumption that "disabled folks cannot use
the web as well as others can, therefore we need to make special
accomodations for them" and that is insulting when in reality,
NO SPECIAL ACCOMODATIONS ARE NEEDED, JUST PROPER APPLICATION OF
HTML IN ALL CIRCUMSTANCES.
Sorry for raising my voice.

It's a good point to make, and one that doesn't sink in easy. People often
jump to the assumption that something "extra" has to be done when making
sites accessible. They have a hard time believing that good markup
practices can do the job. the WCAG, AWARE, and other projects are helping
to get that message out, but it often helps to see it put so succinctly!

And of course browsers which support the mechanisms available to make work
those pages which require no text-only views. While they are getting better, I
am (as I am sure many here are) disillusioned by the progress of both
Microsoft and that other company that I can't remember at the moment (started
with an N I think...). I am sure this has a lot to do with the fact that
although it seems old hat to me, HTML4 and CSS etc... are young
reccomendations.
But this is a real problem right now- some (business) clients demand hacked
HTML- in this case, text-only looks like a good solution, especially if you
can do it without duplication. They aren't concerned that the AOL 3.0 browser
that doesn't support CSS will render a page readable- they're concerned that
it will render the page "ugly"- image is very important to them (though I do
fight against 'marketing creep' as much as possible, in favor of accessible
information).
This is not so much a usability issue then as it is a political issue (not to
imply political = not important). By offering a text-only view of a site, you
are creating information ghettos. Interesting point- one I would not have
considered, being disability-impaired. My view is that until everyone supports
the proper application of HTML/CSS special accomodations may be neccessary for
those web authors who must work within the constraints of a customer with
high-visibility (actually the trick is getting them to constrain themselves).
No problem, just as long as the voices aren't so loud that no one hears what
is being said.
-nick
Except there are more browsers than just those two out there. If
you consider the special needs of many users with disabilities,
you'll find that they might very well not be using Netscape or
MSIE. The web is meant to work with whatever client the user finds
best suits his or her needs, right?
Slap them around a little.
If they're concerned about "ugly", introduce them to a screenreader
and their eyes (or ears) will be opened. Load a demo version of
pwWebSpeak, show them that they _cannot_ guarantee presentation of
their pages EVER, and then let them hear how bad their site sounds
in pwWS.
Why is it okay to sound/look ugly to some people and not others?
Why is are those people who you look awful to determine by their
disability? Ugh!
It's always something to consider, especially when we are making
certain people feel like they're not the primary users of the
site. That is TERRIBLE business sense. Read my "selfish reasons
for accessible web design" at http://www.kynn.com/+selfish for
a quote about how much money users with disabilities have to
spend, and note that they'll spend it places where they feel
welcome.
To me, multiple views of a site are sorta like having two doors
to a store. One is at the front, under the sign, with all
the signs and people to greet you. The other one says "DISABLED
ENTRANCE" and is around the side, with a ramp that leads up
to a plainly marked door at the back of the store.
If I were designing that building, I'd just make one big
attractive door in the front, with a ramp up to it, that
anyone could use. Wouldn't you?
Then the accomodations are being made for the sucky browsers
(MSIE, Netscape) -- so why are we making it look like there's
something wrong with disabled folks?
If I were blind, I would say, "The disability isn't that _I_
can't see the web -- the disability we're dealing with here is
_your_ inability to create a good page. My disability doesn't
prevent me from getting information -- yours does." I think
the same thing applies here -- why not have two views of the
site, one that reads "for REAL web browsers that can handle
HTML correctly and accessibly" and the other labeled "for
MSIE, Netscape, and other crappy browsers"?
(Be careful with your answer, you may inadvertently state that
it's better to alienate standards-compliant browser users
and/or alienate disabled users!)

Kynn, you are eloquent as always. The allusions to the fight for civil
rights are never long in coming! They continue to be appropriate.
It gets trickier.
There is a large contingency of folks who believe that a "text-only"
version is desirable. This belief comes both from users (some of whom who
are blind) and developers (some, like Microsoft, are quite sophisticated)
who sincerely believe that they are doing the "right" thing. There is also
the (large) middle ground of sites that offer poor quality "text-only"
versions because they think that they "have to" and they (mistakenly)
believe that these (scraps of text) will save them the work of
(re)designing their site correctly in the first place (it won't). It is
this large middle ground that we most need to get the message to. How do
we do that?
It is my understanding that during the desegregation of the schools that
there were pockets of resistance by blacks that wanted to keep their
all-black schools (which, in many cases, were quite dear to them, and not
all were of inferior quality). How were these folks convinced that
universal desegregation WAS as good thing? How do we convince a blind user
-- who LIKES coming across "text-only" pages that s/he is accepting a
"disability ghetto"?
Getting back to my initial post -- Can anyone provide URLs to hard data (or
research or surveys) that supports the position that text-only parallel
sites are counter productive?
Short of this, can anyone provide URLs for sites that advocate for the
creation of text-only parallel sites? (At least then we could point the
authors of such documents to this discussion thread.)
Thank you all.
Bruce Bailey
In this case we need to show them that graphically robust,
highly interactive, bleeding edge sites can be made accessible
to them just as easily -- or easier! -- as text-only sites.
This relies on "converting" the high end design folks to the
cause -- infecting them with the accessible web authoring
meme. That can be tricky because most of them have heard the
myths alluded to in http://www.kynn.com/+myths -- so we need
to educate them, and then we can show the doubters in the
disabled community that we _can_ make sites usable by everyone,
and they don't have to be the second-class citizens of the
web, entering through the plain, unmarked door at the side of
the store.

Hmm, I'll have to be more careful answering this than the last question in this
message, but the issue is well understood by all here, and is unfortunate (Bruce
Bailey's followup which just appeard as I'm writing this eloquently addresses the
issue in terms of segregation). It might work well to address this in terms of
minorities- perhaps a poor word choice, but effective for this illustration. Those
other browsers are the "minority" and they are so often cast aside as
"inconsequential", though I keep stressing that customers would be surprised if
they knew how many people browse their sites with Lynx. (not to mention so many of
the 1000 or so others out there)
YES! And this is what I have been realizing. I was once an HTML hacker myself,
taking considerable pride in being able to get Netscape to do tricks it wasn't
supposed to do- and the ironic thing is that this is, at first, what made people
notice our work. So true with so many other HTML writers- and so unfortunate. Not
until I "understood the WWW", i.e., understood the power of sharing information on
a world-wide level, instead of looking at the WWW as an extension of television-
as a "visual medium" did my HTML hacks disappear overnight.
How do we get everyone to take advantage of the real strengths of the WWW?
(And I'm getting horribly off topic).
Something wrong, or something different? Different kind of person, different kind
of site. I'm not saying that this is correct- but it seems the root of the
text-only idea. When we discuss accessibility with a client, text-only versions
are mentioned not only for use by the blind but also for slow connections,
telephone/pda browsing etc... Besides, just becasue it is text doesn't mean its
accessible to the blind anyway- consider (as I'm sure has been many times on this
list) ALT attributes which refer to color. In reviewing the WAI guidelines, I
noticed that 9 out of 10 items had little to do with HTML- most having to do with
contextual issues- *writing* issues.
This is a wonderful example of the "state of the art". Though very much out of
context, I always want to parallelize the "Transistional" flavor of HTML with
puberty. The issue is not simply accessiblity, but equal accessiblity. The answer
to the above question is well-known and answering it the way it would be answered
in most business cases threatens to incriminate me- MSIE/NN and all the other
crappy browsers would win. My question would be
"Do the crappy browser makers realize the urgency of getting the
standards-compliant browsers out there?"
-nick
In general, no, although some of them pay lip service to it.
I recently received email from Netscape gushing about how
accessible Nav5 will be. I hope it will be, but in honesty,
I'm not holding my breath. I have higher hopes for accessible
browsers from ProdWorks, Opera, iCab, and others than I do
from either of "big two" browsers.
BTW, have you seen iCab? It's pretty nifty (I have it on the
HWG's new mac) and it almost makes up for the fact that there's
no Opera for Macintosh machines.

Folks,
Like Jeff, this is my first post to the list. I've been reading it about a
week. I moved to this list to get a broader perspective on the
accessibility issues than I was able to get from a list that I thought was
discussing the full spectrum of accessibility, but turned out to be
dedicated only to the needs and wants of the blind. My interest in
accessibility is because I'm doing a web site for a group that is focused
on accessibility for the disabled. I am delighted to see that Jonathan
Chetwynd (sp) is a part of this discussion, as I think his efforts to bring
another group of disabled (one that is dear to my heart due to years of
teaching with the HS aged portion of this population).
I have found this GIF appear in pages I've created using MS Publisher98.
With a little experimenting, I discovered they were used to create the
spacing that made a difference between the page appearing properly spaced
to the sighted user. Unable to tag this images in Publisher (or I haven't
found it yet!), I tagged them after the pages were created by Publisher
into HTML. I have tagged these images ALT="blank", but have noticed that a
better way would be ALT="" ... After viewing the pages both with and
without the blanks, I'd rather hassle with the HTML code than leave them
off because the provide important accessibility and understanding to the
sighted users of a page.
In light of the above comments, I am confused that this would be considered
"very bad for accessibility". The blanks seem to me to be helpful for
"accessibility" to the disability community and wider community who are
sighted and need proper spacing in order to best comprehend the information
presented.
I am also concerned with providing pages that work as well when printed as
when viewed on a screen. As an educator, I use print outs from the web as a
learning resource. In the local schools, the Internet is available at a
limited number of computers in the high school, and has yet to become
available in the lower schools. Some sites that are in wonderful colors for
the screen provide a link to a printable version which I've found very useful.
In truth, I have found mimimal information available on the web that is
suitable for younger students. When I tried to use the web to supplement my
7-yr-old nephew's need to learn about "ancient egypt", we were very
disappointed. The graphics were too few, and the text, although abundent,
was all written above his head even when I read them to him. I'm not sure
if its an "accessibility" issue to address the needs of youthful students,
or just a matter of development of the web in the K-12 arena. I'd welcome
other thoughts on the issue.
