From Bruce Bailey:
William -- and anyone else who remains skeptical that non-scaleable text is
a significant barrier:
Please (re)review Gregory's description at URL:
And Kynn's earlier explanation (before he became contrarian for this
particular thread) at URL:
William, please forward the above two links to the GL list for me. It would
seem that I am temporarily unable to post directly to the list...
Love.
ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE
Do we believe that it is a priority one (as defined in WCAG 1.0)
barrier? If not, why not?

William was most kindly forwarding my comment, so I will reply.
The words "significant barrier" comes straight from the P2 checkpoint on the
WCAG. Non-scaleable text (in any form) obviously meets this criteria. I am
not really going to try and argue that this is a P1 issue (although many
experience blind surfers will tell you that even missing or bad ALT text is
NOT always an absolute barrier to using a site).
Are you seriously looking for an arguement as to why non-scaleable text
should be promoted to P1 status? Maybe it should. It address the needs of
a population that is often overlooked. Before we go down that path, I would
first plead for a consensus to Len's orginal question, less this thread go
on for another two months!
Are small graphical text naviagion buttons a P2 issue?
-- Bruce (hoping this post goes through)
Yes, I think we should consider whether or not it is a P1 issue. I also
think we need to consider whether or not the use of graphics (see nearly
any post by Anne) should be a P1 issue.
That wasn't Len's question, though. :)
