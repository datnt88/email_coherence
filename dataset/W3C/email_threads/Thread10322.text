Folks have done a good job of picking up the loose comments identified by
Jan. Thanks to all. I think they all covered now except (possibly) those
below.
[EricP's comment about examples in Primer. Frank's prompted him for
reasons why; this is to do with nonopaqueness issue of URLs. No response
from EricP but I think this is captured in other discussion]
Frank??
I have a recollection of seeing some traffic on this but can't find it in
the archive. If I missed it sorry Frank. Frank, do you think anything
more than a "closed given lack of response" is needed?
And on the vocabulary document:
[DanC on member and collection; recall this being discussed, can't find
a closing message]
Danbri??
[late, another question about creating a class for rdfs:Schema. No ack]
Danbri??

I'm not sure. Eric talked to me at the Tech Symposium about this. As a
result, he had promised to send me some words that I'd try to stick in,
but he never did, and I forgot to ping him about it. However, the words
he was supposed to send me were to describe the fact that there was this
*convention* he was referring to in his comment, that URIrefs with
fragment ids referred to abstract (non-retrievable) things like people,
and the other URIrefs referred to retrievable things like Web pages.
However, RDF doesn't formally recognize that convention (and I'm not
sure I really agree with it), and Eric's probably busy with other stuff,
so I'd just as soon drop it.

I'd be inclined to treat this as a comment against 'Semantics' WD (but with
knock on effect for RDFS WD). DanC, did subsequent discussion satisfy your
concern, or should we open an issue for this?
I've just sent a proposal to the list. Please open an issue to cover this, I'll reply
to Daniel.
