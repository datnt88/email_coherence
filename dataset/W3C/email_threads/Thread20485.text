I recompiled Amaya using the source tarball and the following Options
file. I continue to get errors when running Amaya from the Xterminals
and the error message is the same so perhaps I did not us the proper
flags?
I have the source in /opt/applications/amaya-src
My newly compilted binaries are in
/opt/applications/amaya-src/Amaya/Linux/bin
When I run /opt/applications/amaya-src/Amaya/Linux/bin/amaya from
diskless xterminals, I get the following error:
*** Amaya: Irrecoverable error ***
The application never starts.
I am running Red Hat 7.2. It looks like Lesstif 0.93 is installed on it
(is that installed by default?). We are using X11R6 with XFree96 4.
When I look in the X11R6 directory structure, though, I see
/usr/X11R6/LessTif/Motif2.1/include stuff.
Please let me know what else I can do to provide information to
troubleshoot this problem. Thanks!

If you compiled Amaya with the -g option you can now launch Amaya under gdb
gdb /opt/applications/amaya-src/Amaya/Linux/bin/amaya
Either the application stopped with a sigsev or you can add a
breakpoint in XWindowFatalError
b XWindowFatalError
Please let me know what Amaya function crashed and the line number
More you can send me the result of the command
where
Thanks for your contribution in advance
Irene.
I have been unable to get the GTK compile to work. I would be more than
happy to do whatever you is necessary to help get this problem
resolved. I have been hoping to use Amaya in our offices. Thank you.
