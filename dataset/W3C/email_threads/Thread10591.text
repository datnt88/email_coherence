I note that Mark's msg
seemed to suggest that he would like a postponed issue:
Can we at least agree that this is an issue; that RDF Schema isn't
self-descriptive? I'm not detecting that you agree.
and particularly he is likely to be happier even with an issue postponed until
after the "media types as URIs" problem is fixed. I don't suppose we have one
do we?
I vaguely remember agreeing that mime types were inappropriate for carrying
the intended inference, but it may well make sense to review this later if
there are media type changes coming down the pipeline.

To my satsifaction, we do; as Brian pointed out:
The RDFCore issue
may also be relevant to this. In part it concerns what entailments a
publisher of RDF endorses. The director has agreed to this issue being
postponed, and further discusion is happening in the semantic web
meaning forum:

And #rdfms-assertion is connected to...
which is not far from
Dan Connolly, W3C http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/
Oh yes ...
that looks like enough to me too.
