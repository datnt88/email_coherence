I have two comments on section 6.3 of
#canonical-form
1) suggest add the following additional rule:
+ For URIs following the generic syntax produce an abs_path of "/" in
preference to omitting the abs_path
(this might need an additional example earlier in the doc
vs http://example.com/ )
2) may it be helpful to explicitly extend the rule:
"Only perform percent-escaping where it is essential. "
to considerations where the URI is being transported in a way that
anticipates IRIs e.g. XML system identifiers - and to discourage %-escaping
of non-ASCII chars in such circumstances.
(I note that XML Namespaces 1.1 is explicit about this:
"Because of the risk of confusion between IRIs that would be equivalent if
derefenced, the use of %-escaped characters in namespace names is strongly
discouraged."
Jeremy
Probably a good idea.
I think this is an issue for the IRI spec, not the URI spec.
There are no non-ASCII chars in URIs as defined by the URI syntax
(there can be non-ASCII chars encoded in URIs, but that's not at
issue here).
Regards, Martin.
Done.
No, because such situations do not actually involve URIs until after
the IRI normalization is completed.
I would (and do) strongly discourage the use of IRIs for namespaces.
Any identifier that is primarily intended for machine consumption should
be constructed for maximum interoperability.
