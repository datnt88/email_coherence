Greetings, all.
Did anyone listen to this call / e-Seminar? What were your thoughts? It was
interesting to me in the general sense to see what products are offering,
but I had a lot of problems with the products themselves (as in, the
products did not appear to be accessible in and of themselves). Anyone
else's thoughts / opinions?
Best regards,
Denise
What seminar?
Sorry, I was typing too fast!
I meant the eSeminar that Adobe provided today regarding their accessibility
products / initiatives.
What seminar?
I didn't, but some folks from my company (Reef) did. I'll see what
they thought (but most of them were Marketing folks, not Web
Developers!)...
David Poehlman re-posted the announcement to the WAI list on August
23; here is a copy of that, if you didn't see it before. Note that
there is another running of the eSeminar on 11 September.
