In the Unicode documents, they seem to always use the two-word spelling
"code point" (for example, http://www.unicode.org/faq/basic_q.html )
But the XQuery documents sometimes use one word (codepoint) and sometimes
hyphenation (code-point). Which is it?
Thanks,

Thanks! Good point! Let's be consistent.
BTW: The F&amp;O says "'code point', sometimes spelt 'codepoint'"
I think 'code-point' should be prohibited.
All the best, Ashok

Hi Ashok,
I can't tell from your response -- will you go with "code point" or
"codepoint"?
Thanks,
