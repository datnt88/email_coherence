PS. One case which this might not handle well would be where the one
string means different things in different languages. Are there any
cases like that?
"Chat", in French, is a cat. In English, it is an informal conversation.

I like "shopping".
In British English it involves going to the supermarket and getting food; in
italian you go to the posh shops and (at least think about) spend(ing) lots
of money on stylish clothes. They are really very distinct activities.
"shopping"/en-uk = "spesi"/it
I am not really quite sure hopw to say "shopping"/it in English.

In my life, this is a gender difference rather than a language
difference. That is what my wife means by 'shopping'.
