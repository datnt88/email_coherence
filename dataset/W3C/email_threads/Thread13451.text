There was a discussion in the last teleconference about providing a
database telling whether various authoring tools meet ATAG.
I'd like to focus on one of the issues. Do we rely on the tool providers
to do self evaluation? Or does the W3C take on the role of evaluating tools?
Taking off my chair hat I offer a few observations:
1. It would undoubtedly be useful for people to have an accurate account of
whether tools meet ATAG.
2. However, some of the evaluation is subjective. For example, 3.2
requires "Help the author create structured content and separate
information from its presentation." How much help is required to say this
is satisfied, e.g. how many of the techniques in
one? Five? etc. Similarly 4.1, checking for accessibility, references
AERT, not a normative document, so evaluating satisfaction is
subjective. Checkpoint 5.2's "obvious and easily initiated" also worries
me. As a human factors engineer, I've had lots of debates with people who
thought something was obvious and easily intiated when the users didn't.
3. W3C is supposed to be vendor neutral.
So, what I'm worried about is complaints about our subjective judgments
favoring one company or another.
Is there a subset of strictly objective specs that avoids this problem?
OK, chair hat back on. Any comments?

WL: I can't speak for W3C but I think the idea of us evaluating tools
vs. reporting on individual's experience with them is out of bounds.
WC: Will tool developers see a difference? I know we talked about the
marketing advantages of the database and the incentive it may give
developers to make their tools conform to WAI guidelines. I realize we
won't give anything a formal "WAI seal of approval" or "official evaluation
tool of the WAI" but if someone searches for Level A compliant tools they
will basically be finding those tools that we deem WAI conformant. In a
sense this is a seal of approval.
I still think this information is very useful. I also still have my
concern that I expressed during the joint telecon on Tuesday.

WC:: "Will tool developers see a difference?"
WL: Yes, because it will have lots of disclaimers and notice that this
is the "opinion of _____" and not to be taken as approval... Also these
"reviews" will be made by anyone *including the developers. Their
participation will make it obvious that this isn't any kind of
"objective" verification, certification, etc.
Love.
ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE
I would much rather see a third party undertake such a task than
to see the W3C, just because of these kinds of problems. I definitely
don't think it's something an interest group can/should do, especially
when we are dealing with "subjective" criteria.
At one time there was talk of the W3C investigating the possibility
of a "conformance claims" activity of some kind -- what became of
that?

Crossposted to AU and ER
Len identifies some important points.
1. It is indeed useful to identify what tools meet the requirements. In fact,
W3C process requires that this can be done for a recommendation. So we have
two options - we can build the tools ourselves, or find tools that already
implement the requirements. It is also useful for developers, who are trying
to meet the guidelines, to have more guidance about what that means. Seeing
the opinions of the working group is helpful in this regard. For the working
group to have a good idea of how to make decisions on "line calls", and even
more so for others, it is helpful to have a number of such decisions
available to refer to.
2. There are indeed questions about what does "integrated into the look and
feel mean". Again, the best way I know of to clarify this is by trying
it. Some of the other cases, like the relative priority checkkpoints, are
less complicated. There is a lot of work to test each one, but it is
explained under relative priority that what is required is based on the
checkpoints of WCAG. Developing techniques, and tests, is a lot of the
current work in front of the AU group.
3. Vendor neutral is not the same as issue neutral, or silent. W3C is
certainly not in a position to sit down and work on their favourite vendor's
tools, or say that someone's software is all terrible. However, in order to
demonstrate what we mean by the specification, in informative examples, it is
reasonable to publish opinions expressed about how a particular tool does or
does not meet the requirements, along with any subsequent debate on the
issue. Not to do so would be tantamount to claiming the specification is
perfect, and anyone who doesn't understand it is inadequate, which is likely
to be almost diametrically wrong. Our comments, if we are working in good
faith, are not likely to provide undeserved praise or blame in any great
degree, and as a working group it is our job to watch over ourselves and each
other, and test what we say against reality. I believe we are in fact capable
of doing so (although I recognise that it is important to bear this in mind,
and recall that we are none of us infallible).
On another front, in the ER response to this thread, Kynn asked what was
happening about the conformance and quality assurance person W3C was going to
hire. As I understand it, his name is Karl Dubost and he will be beginning
work at the start of July. (People who follow everything in AU may notice
that he is in fact the person who produced the french translation of ATAG.

LK:: "Or does the W3C take on the role of evaluating tools?"
WL: I can't speak for W3C but I think the idea of us evaluating tools
vs. reporting on individual's experience with them is out of bounds. I
assume that by evaluation you mean some sort of "Good Websiting Seal of
Approval"? This is a monumental task and subject to all kinds of
litigative possibilities, bribery (maybe it's not that bad - any
openings for an "objective" evaluator) - on the whole probably
unthinkable.
I get uncomfortable just talking about it!
Love.

Charles, will he be working on these kinds of issues that we've
been discussing in the WAI, or am I not understanding what his
job will be?

I am not sure exactly what he will be working on - Daniel Dardailler will
know a lot better. But I believe he is looking at issues like those we have
been discussing - methodologies, branding/certification and what its
implications are, etc.
Cheers
