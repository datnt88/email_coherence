Hello --
I'm a newcomer to Amaya and have a quick question: How do I persuade it to
use Adobe Acrobat Reader to read pdf files? I've hunted and hunted and had
no luck.
Thanks for your help.

Hello Meg,
In our previous episode, Halter, Meg said:
We don't have yet a feature to call external applications from within
Amaya. So it's not possible to do what you want to do.
The pluging support we previously had was obsolete, so we decided to remove
it while waiting for a volunteer to upgrade it. The code is still available,
but not compiled anymore.

Hi Jose --
Hmmmmm. So how would I handle a link to a pdf file? If I simply
double-click, it opens the file in the browser. Is there any way to save the
referenced file to the local hard disk?

Meg,
Are you opening a local file or one on a server? If the latter, can you give
me the URL? If the server isn't sending a correct MIME type, that may be
causing problems. Otherwise, it's an Amaya bug.
We've time to fix this bug (if it is one) just before the forthcoming Amaya
release (ETA: around next week).
