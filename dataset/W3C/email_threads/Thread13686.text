I've hacked up a demo-of-concept for computing markup equivalence.
I think this shows fairly clearly "can be done" (modulo likely bugs:-)
I have some interesting thoughts arising from this - more anon.

I assume you'll be sharing the exact method of creating the hashes?
Cheers,
Jim.
I take it that means you want to know?
Parse the markup with SP (what I'm using is slightly hacked, but vanilla
nsgmls should be just the same). Grep the output for content of interest
and discard the rest. Make a hash of that.
The other input you can use is a custom DTD, but the existing demo
doesn't use that at all - it really is a quick-hack.
The actual hashes are MD5, expressed as Base64.
