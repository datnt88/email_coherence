[ I've cc:d uri@w3.org because I suspect there may be more diversity of
input there, but have set replies to www-talk@w3.org, as this is
probably out of scope for discussion on the URI list. ]
I've been reading through most of the fun little brawl that happened on
uri@w3.org in July when catching up on my mail (yes, I'm behind).
It seems to me that there are two possible views of the relationship
between URIs and their associated resources;
* Many-to-One - that is, it's possible for many URIs to identify the
same resource. In this view, it may be helpful to think of URIs as
identifying *interfaces* to resources, rather than resources
themselves; i.e., if one asserts that two URIs identify the same
resource, it really is the same resource.
* One-to-One - that is, each URI identifies a separate resource, and
one can only assert that the resources they identify are identical in
every measurable way, but not the same resource.
Please note that I'm not saying that in either there's any defined way
of looking at URIs and determining the relationships between the
interfaces that they identify. One could, of course, come up with a
format that allowed such relationships to be described and advertised
by their authorities...
It's a fairly fine distinction, I know, but I'm not sure that it's
universally agreed to. What do people think? I'm interested to see if
there are substantial differences in the URI, REST, Web architecture
and Semantic Web communities.

That's the current position of the TAG:
"Web architecture does not constrain resources to be uniquely named."

I may be able to speak for the Semantic Web community in this: if you
want to use URIs to name things like coffee makers and stars (as we
do), only a Many-to-One relationship could possibly work. Anything
which exists (whatever that means) independent of a particular
authority can sensibly be given different names by different
authorities, and to imagine that it could not be.... to imagine that
there is at most one URI which identifies the Sun.... seems pretty
unworkable.
Of course I also see that when you think of URIs (especially working
HTTP ones) as communication end-points (or, as I've written,
ResponsePoints [1]) they are very, very close to one-to-one. Then it
really is splitting hairs (in the neighborhood of "http://www.w3.org/"
identifying the same thing as "http://www.w3.org") to see whether they
are 1-1 or 1-many.

Re: Many-to-One vs One-to-One
I think the question is ill-formed; it assumes that
the space of resources has a well defined equality
relationship.
Before you can ask if there are two URIs U1 and U2 such
that U1 != U2 but
ResourceIdentifiedBy(U1) == ResourceIdentifiedBy(U2)
you have to know what '==' means for resources. But
there is no well-defined equality for resources, so
the question doesn't make sense.
many-to-one and one-to-one only apply to spaces with
well-defined (and, for that matter, unique) equality
relationships.

From a Many-to-One set, any element is equal to another element in the
same set. So, you need to define the conditions on the set.
The formal semantics for RDF talks about there being a *set* of resources.
To define a set, there needs to be some notion of equality, or sameness,
which I would assume to be the notion used in talking about one-to-one or
many-to-one.
Of course, this line is applicable only to a semantic web viewpoint, I
guess others might vary. Do we mean for resources to be set theoretic in
nature?
