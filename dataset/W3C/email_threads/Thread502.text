At http://www.geocities.com/jtnews_bellatlantic_net/jtidy-derived.html
I have some modifications that allow the current version of jtidy from
CVS
to be compiled with ant 1.2 and Xerces 1.2.1.
You can use it and/or incorporate changes if you want.
Note, to get rid of the annoying geocities ad banner, click on the upper
right corner of the ad twice.
Thanks, I'll have a look and incorporate and test the changes.

The DOM changes look fine. I'll try to incorporate the functionality as
well, eventually.
Sami -- Can you look over the Ant changes and make appropriate updates?
JTNews, thanks for the build.sh!!
Gary
Greetings,
I second the thanks for the build.sh!
As for the Ant changes -- they seem to be mainly about differences
between 1.1 and 1.2 releases of Ant (I assume -- I haven't looked at
1.2 so close yet). They do not alter the current functionality, and
therefore we may want to at least keep the 1.1 syntax around for a
while.
I will change the build syntax to Ant 1.2 as soon as five (5) people
send me an email with the subject "UPGRADE JTIDY TO ANT 1.2" ;)

There's actually a good reason to upgrade to ant 1.2.
The "modern" compiler can't be used in Ant 1.1
and the "classic" compiler has some bugs for which there are
no workarounds. One example of a bug in the "classic" compiler
is no support for extending locally defined classes. That's the
main reason why I'm using Ant 1.2 now.
I've uploaded the changes. It turns out that only a change to
DOMNodeImpl was required since everything else extends that.
Tidy will now compile on its own, or with Xerces 1.2.0 or 1.2.1.
This change is available for downloading from CVS and will be
incorporated in the next release of JTidy.

I've updated my unofficial version for ant 1.2 and xerces 1.2.1
to reflect the most recent CVS.
See http://www.geocities.com/jtnews_bellatlantic_net/jtidy-derived.html
for details.
Hello,
As these changes have been widely requested, I am willing to roll a
new release as soon as we can be sure that the modification is
completely backward-compatible. Alternatively, I can label the release
as being experimental.
Yours,
