CLOSE
Brian,
Confusion reigns!
I was missing from this meeting (and not around to read the agenda or
check the previous minutes!).
I was at the previous one (2000-06-15) where we decided to temporarily
close the rdfms-resource-semantics issue and reopen it when the time
came for us to be clearer about the basic semantics.
This was missing from the minutes of the 2000-06-15 meeting and so it
survived to the 22nd.
I note it got a `POSTPONED (absent)' on the 22nd. It should be dropped
for the time being.

ok with you.
