Can someone tell me if it's possible to
insert javascript code as an element's
attribute's value?
That is, I create a select element; I also create
some option elements, appending each one as a child
to the select element as I create them.
To the select element, I add an attribute
called "onchange", and it's value is:
"alert('option changed')"; that is, I do:
var e = document.createElement("select");
e.setAttribute("onchange", "alert('option changed')");
I bring up the page on my browser, I do see
the pulldown, but when I change the option,
I don't get the javascript alert like I expect
to.
Am I doing this correctly? If not how can I
do this?
Thanks!

You want to use addEventListener instead of setAttribute, at a guess.

Hi Boris, thanks for the help. It worked- kinda.
It seems IE 5+ doesn't support addEventListener.
IE5+ has got its own thing called attachEvent
(found that online).
The whole point of me using DOM in the first place
was so that I woun't have to test for browsers.
But now it seems I have to. Ironic I think...
