Once you've invested the time to learn, it's actually
easier
to make an accessible site than to purposely break HTML and
make one that's inaccessible.
That's my mantra, and I'm sticking to it.
That was the point, Kynn. At this time it requires a
sizeable investment of time (and therefore money) to unlearn
the old ways and learn the new ways. So I still think it's
deceptive to ignore that effort and to tell people that it's
easier. I run a business, and that learning time (and time
to stay abreast of accessibility issues--I don't think we've
achieved perfection yet) either comes out of my time with my
family, or out of my work time. And I either pay for it
myself, or pass it on to the client. Either way, it's not
free and it's hardly easier.
In the future, maybe, though I doubt it. So is it really
true that it's easier, or is it just something that we say
because we *want* to believe it? Are their any studies that
prove this point one way or the other? Or do we just assume?
My experience is that learning how to build accessible sites
and even building them has required a lot of extra effort. I
would be interested in hearing from other designers on this
list regarding the amount of time they've invested in
accessibility related work. Is my experience unique, or have
others had similar experiences?
I would like us to discuss what is true and real based on
empirical evidence rather than making statements without
support, especially when those statements contradict
personal experience.

What sort of empirical evidence are you looking for? I spend
a good deal of my time dealing with educating web designers on
accessibility issues -- for example, the HTML Writers Guild's
first project in it http://www.hwg.org/opcenter/projects/agi/
to an online class in HTML http://www.hwg.org/opcenter/classes/h151.2.html
which is currently in its second outing.
In my experience, this ISN'T hard to teach. Start with ALT text
for all images, and you've already eliminated half the accessibility
problems on the net. Go on from there, and I can teach the rest in a
day (face to face) or a six week course (at a leisurely pace), and
all you'll need after that is the URL of the WAI guidelines and the
quick reference card.
The only real hurdles are (a) getting people to realize there's
something to learn, (b) opening their eyes to the effects, and then
(c) just slogging through the guidelines. The first is a matter
of marketing, the second of personalization, and the third is just
transmittal of information.

+AD4-What sort of empirical evidence are you looking for?
This sort:
1. How much time, on the average, has a web designer who's
trying to design accessible sites spent learning how to do
so? Not how long is the class, but what is the reality? Yes,
in the future with enough marketing, etc. perhaps this will
become a non-issue, but right now that doesn't help me much.
I spent a +ACo-lot+ACo- of time trying to find this information and
sorting through the various arguments and I'm +ACo-still+ACo- not
sure I really understand it all.
2. How much time, on the average, does it take to convert a
currently inaccessible site to an accessible one and what
does that translate into in terms of dollars?
3. Is there, in fact, extra effort required to make a site
accessible? Are there comparisons of sites? Studies?
Anything scientific? Or are we just guessing?
Some stuff is just common sense. If I want to add an +ACI-aural,
braille, tty+ACI- stylesheet to my page, doesn't it take some
time to make that stylesheet? Didn't I invest some time
learning how to make that particular stylesheet? And don't I
have to test it? And doesn't that mean I need to come up
with the browser to test it in, install it, learn how to use
it, etc.?
I honestly can't believe that anyone who has actually gone
through this process can say that it doesn't take any extra
effort. Furthermore, if I decide to heck with the aural
stylesheet and save the effort, is my HTML broken? I think
not, but my site may still not be entirely accessible.

Not exactly peanuts. What's more, this assumes that
accessibility is solely about code, whereas I think it goes
well beyond that to the fundamental design of the site
itself. And to make a truly good site, it should be tested.
For an accessible site, the best idea would be to test it
with the applicable browsers and to have testing done by
persons with disabilities. More effort. I still don't see
how this is easy.

+ACI-Slogging+ACI-? That's almost an admission that it involves real
work. And until the first two objectives are achieved, there
are likely to be many more designers like me who have to
re-learn everything. That is the reality, in my opinion. And
I still feel that it's insulting to those who have labored
long and hard to learn this stuff to minimize their efforts.
I'm not trying to feel that way, I just do.

Well, I have found that one does not actually stop learning html. Once
you learn the basics, one is always striving to make it better and
therefore, one is always learning new techniques. I taught myself the basic
html coding in about a week, then spent the next two years fine tuning it.
I am still leanring! **Smile**
2. How much time, on the average, does it take to convert a
currently inaccessible site to an accessible one and what

I am converting an inaccessibe site into an accessible one now. This
site has over a hundred pages. This will take as much time as it takes. It
is really quite difficult to put it into days, hours, minutes. Money-wise?
Whatever is current charges or what you and the customer agrees on. I do
not believe that web site designing has a regulated set fee.
3. Is there, in fact, extra effort required to make a site
accessible? Are there comparisons of sites? Studies?
Anything scientific? Or are we just guessing?
Of course there is extra effort. You are taking a site that is
already done and rewriting or adding to the html coding to make it
accessible. There are millions of sites online and it would be naive to say
one does not compare sites. Studies? Well, the W3C has some wonderful
pages on its site to help anyone about how to make their site accessible.
The HTML Writer's Guild has people who are willing to help. One can't offer
help if one hasn't made in studies in the field they are helping with,
right? Scientific? I don't know. Are we guessing, I don't beleive so.
Just put your site through any of the great validators and they will tell
you how your site stands up to be accessible. That isn't guessing, that is
fact and that takes long hours of designing a program to be useful and used
in this area.

Gosh, put it the way you do and I sound really stupid. I am sorry I took up
your time with my answer.
This is a very good listserv and I have learned much from it. I am not a
college graduate and do not have at my command clever cliches to answer you
with. From my experience, everyone has been helpful and answered my
questions when I asked them. If I had something wrong with my site and I
asked someone to look at it, I would to expect the truth whether it was good
or bad. If I sound rude, I apologise but you are answering my e-mail the
same way you said you didn't like to be answered. I was only giving my
opinion.
******Which brings me to my final point: If we have no real
evidence to support this claim, then why are so many of us
promoting it? It seems a very dangerous thing to do. The
issues of accessibility are, in my opinion, quite complex
and often controversial. They should be handled carefully,
thoughtfully, and rationally. Spouting out unsubstantiated
truisms helps no-one. And, if it should prove that
accessible sites DO cost more, we are going to look like
fools. I don't see how that serves the cause of web
accessibility.********
Below is a site you should visit because:
"The World Wide Web offers the promise of transforming many traditional
barriers to information and interaction among different peoples. The W3C's
commitment to lead the Web to its full potential includes promoting a high
degree of usability for people with disabilities. The Web Accessibility
Initiative (WAI), in coordination with other organizations, is pursuing
accessibility of the Web through five primary areas of work: technology,
guidelines, tools, education &amp; outreach, and research &amp; development. "
I believe in this. No ifs, ands, nor buts about it. I am not perfect and
am still leanring how to make sites accessible as possible. But I am trying.
It sounds like you are trying your best to convince yourself that
accessibity is really needed and until you are convinced it is needed you
will not fully believe in it.
Dangerous??? This is not clear to me.

I am very grateful that the Web Design Group wilbur guides were available
when I was first learning html. Take a look at the following url for
example:
If I was first learning html from the W3C 4.0 specifications I would be
really lost:
Although Raggett's 10 minute Guide to HTML is pretty sweet:
My point with the above references is that the time commitment is quite
variable. Are you talking about ASCII with a few line of html that might
display as you expect with one version or another of MS IE or NN or are you
talking about code that will parse through a neutral validation service
without error messages? I would argue that the "cost" for ACCESSIBLE html
versus VALID html is near zero. (Of course, the cost of good/clean/valid
html versus crappy html that works only with some browsers might be quite
high.)
The real difficulty is getting people to understand the difference between
a mark up language / web authoring and word processing / desktop
publishing. The discussion on this list alone confirms that this is not an
intuitive concept. The thing I like best about the WDG references is that
they emphasis the structure and the difference between logical and physical
markup codes.
I am most fortunate that my job duties include advocating for universal
design. In all honesty, I would be arguing that accessible design was not
much work even if I did not believe it. It makes these duties much easier
since I actually do believe this! Like many in my field, I had an early
"conversion experience" regarding the utility of computers to people with
disabilities. I think I speak for others on this list when I say we see
the same importance now regarding access to information which the web
incarnates.
I have heard this kind of commitment referred to as "technology
evangelism". Some of these evangelists will argue the moral high ground,
as you think they should (your "second thing you don't like"). Some (even
though they are evangelists too) will stridently avoid this point (perhaps
they see it as a weakness or don't even believe it) and will argue all
other points. Most advocates don't see any incompatibility between the
positions and think that access is both right and useful to the business.
As others have written to this list, we need both.
Finally, I don't know that I agree with your "holier than thou" accusations
(your "third thing you don't like"), but having made all these religious
analogies, I guess I have given some rationalization for such behavior...

Once you've invested the time to learn, it's actually
to make an accessible site than to purposely break HTML and
make one that's inaccessible.
I think that's one of the more important points behind the Authoring Tools
guideline. There are far too many tools out there that don't consider
accessibility at all. In fact, there are too many tools out there that
create pages 'optimised' for one browser, which creates problems for
*everyone* that doesn't use that browser.
In a perfect world, you'd need to learn a bit about HTML, its history and
uses before you could put a page on the web. In the real world, it would
just be nice if more of the tools used to create pages took care of the
accessibility issues for you.
It seems as though most of the time I spend on accessibility issues is
reminding/explaining to designers why x is inaccessible or why you need to
consider case y. Such as using style sheets to create columns. A series
of topics when the style sheets are turned on appear as
Topic 1 Topic 3 Topic 5
Topic 2 Topic 4 Topic 6
This way, if style sheets aren't on, the topics appear in order down the
page. At least twice this was explained to people who wanted the columns
to appear as
Topic 1 Topic 2 Topic 3
Topic 4 Topic 5 Topic 6
Which would be a complete hash if style sheets were turned off.
