Hi, I need some help. I can't seem to get the wine ontology [1] to
work. From earlier posts on w3 realated mailing-lists I have gathered
that there has been some problems with this ontology.
First of all, is [1] the correct (i.e. most up-to-date) wine ontology?
I am using the ontology together with RACER [2]. The problem is that I
can't realize the ABox. I am told that the ABox is incoherent and that
doesn't sound right. Anyone with similar experience?
Any suggestions, pointers or ideas would be much appreciated.

Hi,
Racer still assumes the unique name assumption (UNA) for individuals.
Therefore, Racer finds the wine Abox inconsistent. This should be fixed
soon because we are working on a pre-alpha release of Racer (version
1.8) that does not assume the UNA anymore as default. It will be
possible to optionally switch on the UNA.

Thank you for clarifying that for me. Now that you mention the UNA
situation I remember seeing a post about it on some related mailing-
list but it had completely slipped my mind. Could you mention any
timeframe within which the new version of Racer, not assuming UNA,
would be available?
Cheers,
