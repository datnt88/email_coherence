As part of the pfps-14 decision should we strike:
The defining authority of a URI which identifies a datatype is responsible
for specifying the datatype's lexical space, value space and datatype
mapping
from section 3.3
Jeremy
I agree. This is incorrect, since one may mint a URI to denote
a datatype that someone else has defined.
Perhaps we should rather replace it with a statement akin to
The defining authority of a URI which identifies an rdfs:Datatype
asserts that it has a lexical space, value space, and datatype
mapping compatible with that defined by this specification.
Eh?

Patrick:
that seems to be conclusive that the text should go.
One of the many problems with section 4 was that some people did not like the
idea that there is a defining authority. If the other text we have concerning
defining authorities is questionable, then deleting it feels like a safe
option (since RDF with no defining authorities even for datatypes is not
really significantly more broken than RDF with no defining authorities except
for datatypes).
Jeremy
(I am sorry Patrick I haven't even tried to understand your argument for why
it is wrong, or how to fix it)
Fair enough.
My view in a nutshell is that there *are* defining authorities, both
for datatypes and for URI denotations, but they need not be the *same*
authority for a given URI denoting a given datatype.
And the text in question IMO says that they are the same authority.
Patrick
*I* agree with that, but note the world did not.
Jeremy
Probably yes.
I would also like to see the normative content of this section separated
from the introductory discussion of datatype concepts. My trouble is, I'm
not sure which bits are normative.
