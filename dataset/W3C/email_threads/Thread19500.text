I have the solaris2 binary for 1.3b, and in my ~/.thotrc I have the lines
ReduceColor=
BackgroundColor=Black
ForegroundColor=White
TextColor=White
TextSize=24
ScrollColor=
MenuBgColor=Black
DocSelectColor=Yellow
ButtonColor=Black
InactiveItemColor=Gray
ActiveBoxColor=Yellow
ReadOnlyColor=LightGray
FontFamily=
FontMenuSize=24
However, on startup, the text in the body of the document I am browsing
is black (on a black bacground), but when I call up help the body text is
white. The buttons and menus are OK, they are white, so I can access the
help. The Menus are also large print (24 point), but the body is not. Am
I missing some options for this here, or is this something in the code?
Thank you,

For the color problem, it seems that your document uses CSS rules or
presentation attributes.
If you find that document fonts are too small, you can change the ZOOM factor
ZOOM=3

No. It is in HTML 2.0 -- no tables, frames, or css.
to be exact.
I changed it from the menu, and it seems to help, thanks. But
since I am not setting the font size in the document, is there
an attribute to set in Amaya to define the default?
Thank you,
