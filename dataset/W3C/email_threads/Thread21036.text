Hello,
I've posted a question several days ago, about how ThirdVoice worked in Internet
Explorer.
They are using Band Objects, like the Search Bar or History bar (you can display
them under View - Explorer Bar...).
For the Netscape Version of ThirdVoice, you need to get the lastest version of
Netscape (4.7) and with it I
was able to download ThirdVoice.
(but I couldn't login because Javascript is disabled in my Netscape, and
ThirdVoice said I only need to enable
it to work well.. I didn't try since then).
The question now is : how does it work with Netscape ?????
Laurent.
Apparently ThirdVoice for Netscape works as a proxy server. It sits between you
and the net, and adds the javascript (or even applets?) that provide the
TV interface.
There was a thread about this a couple of weeks ago at http://www.scripting.com.
There has been a lot of discussion about ThirdVoice there, much of it critical, but
it makes very interesting read.
The discussion of how the new version works is at
Despite the fact that Third Voice is such a mess, I still think a local mediator
(even one approximated by a proxy) is the most promising architechture for
implementing these kinds of applications...

Hello Adrian,
Do you exactly how ThirdVoice works to install a local proxy ?
And how does it include the GUI ???
A proxy can't do that !
Laurent.
Interesting. FYI, my "ThirdVoice Annotation Protocol" document is sitting
on the shelf for a bit. I was hoping to find some eager University students
to help me on it. I've written Jeremy Bowers, the "Technical Director for
Say No To ThirdVoice."
There's a free conference sponsored by MIT's "media in transition" grou
this weekend:
I don't expect anyone to fly into the Hub just to brush elbows with the
tweeds, but you may see me there (slyly bringing up annotation), so say hi.
let me know ahead of time if you will be there.
I was disappointed there didn't seem to be enough interest in a
mini-conference of sorts.
Anyways, my time is going to be spent fully on the Glossary software to
meet the 11/22/99 deadline for WWW9 papers. Expect to see the GNO Glossary
by the end of this month.
