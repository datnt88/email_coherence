This is an attempt at a list of features we could add by extending SKOS-Core
with OWL.
1. soks:related is symmetric.
2. soks:broader is transitive.
3. soks:narrower is transitive.
4. soks:broader and soks:narrower are each other's inverse.
5. A resource typed as a soks:Concept may have at most one value for
6. soks:broaderGeneric and soks:narrowerGeneric are each other's
inverse.
7. soks:broaderInstantive and soks:narrowerInstantive are each other's
inverse.
8. soks:broaderPartitive and soks:narrowerPartitive are each other's
inverse.
9. soks:inFacet and soks:facetMember are each other's inverse.
10. A resource typed as a soks:Concept may have at most one value for
Can't think of any more for the moment.
Couple of general OWL questions:
1. If a property is declared as an owl:TransitiveProperty, will all
sub-properties also be transitive?
2. If a property is declared as an owl:SymmetricProperty, will all
sub-properties also be symmetric?

I'm not sure about this one:
different facets might have different preferred labels (the obvious problem).
I am not sure if you can account for that in OWL, although I would have
thought you can.
But a single Concept might have a couple of preferred labels too. I am
thinking of use cases that guess which Concept is being referred to, and
being a preferred label is an obvious way to rank possible choices. Also, in
merging two thesauri, is there really a need to choose a single preferred
term, given that the RDF key to the meaning is the concept?
The others all make sense to me.

Hi Alistair,
I don't think either are true.
If s is a supProperty of p that means that each pair (sub,obj) in s is
also in p but the subset of pairs in s can be arbitrary. For example, in
a domain with two members a and b you could have:
p = { (a, b), (b, a) }
s = { (a, b) }
Here p is symmetric and s is a subProperty of p but s is not symmetric.
