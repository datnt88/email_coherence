Hi All,
Please remember that we are holding an extra teleconference today at
the usual time.:
4:00 pm ET
(617) 761-6200 ext. 2894#
During the call we will work through the issues list (see summary
below) and make sure that the Guideline document is ready for
publishing to TR. We will also briefly discuss the revised charter.
Thanks
Jutta
AGENDA
1. Open Issues
2. Guideline preparation for TR
3. Charter Revisions
4. Other
Open Issues:
1. Definitions needed for a number of terms.
(http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-au/2004JanMar/0007.html)
2. Concept of "typical user" in success criteria may be unclear.
3. Concept of a "usability STUDY override" to normative requirements for
conformance (success criteria) still undecided (connected with idea of typical
user)?
4. Functional spec or usability-oriented guide? Is ATAG a document that
specifies programmatic requirements, or one that directs the outcome (related
to usability override)?
5. Where will Definition of Authoring Tool example images "live" (in the
guidelines or techniques) - currently they have been moved to the techniques?
6. Handling non-W3C formats - Rationale and success criteria of 2.2
7. There may be insufficient attention paid to Web-based authoring
environments
8. New editorial additions require group approval.
Just a few thoughts on this issue brought up in
with some follow-up mails.
This issue requires serious consideration, but if we have a deadline for
getting an updated working draft out, should this issue get a lower
priority? I.e. it is not a show-stopper, is it?
Geoff Deering has also promised to come with more input, so could we tackle
the whole matter at that time as a project unto itself?
Again, this is not to minimize the importance of this issue. I just am
concerned about meeting deadlines. I am recalling my days in a development
department!
regards, Karen Mardahl
Please, it is possible to give more notice of teleconferences. I have been
away since Thursday with no email access. If not, please accept some sort
of regrets retrospectively.
