The opening in a new window debate keeps happening because people haven't
made up their minds about the issue (this happens where I work at least).
The concern is not just about accessibility but also about usability. The
problem, I think, is that some people think that setting up outside links to
open in a new window makes their site more usable.
In my opinion, opening links onto new windows poses usability problems with
the non-techie crowd. The folks who don't notice that a new window opened
and that they can't hit the back button. If this confuses non-techie people
who are sighted, I assume it would confuse non-techie individuals who are
not sighted.
So even though the answer to the open-in-new-window debate is simple for
some of us, others are tempted to always add that target attribute to their
links.

Why do we keep having these debates about opening new windows? We don't
seem to be having debates about dialog boxes, or error message dialogs, or
the various other GUI windows that have been used for over a decade by
screen reader users. What problem are we trying to solve, the browser
problem, an authoring problem, or what?
For example, if the author codes the link to open in a new window, and the
browser+AT doesn't inform the user (if she wants to be informed) then its
a
browser+AT problem. The default behavior of opening windows in Windows XP
(and a lot of other GUIs) is good example of user configurability. It's
not the authors/developers job to code around responsibilities of the
browser+AT.

A point to consider from a usability perspective:
What about opening a help window?
It is certainly much easier, assistive tech user or not, to have a help
window open alongside a Web site tool, for instance, that describes how
to use that tool, than it is to navigate between tool and help in the
same window.
New windows in some cases are a good thing, for accessibility and
usability.

Opening any new window can be distructive. It seems to me that it is much
simpler and cleaner to keep us in the same window. If a new window is
opened, I have to remember that it is there and I have to go back and forth
between two windows if I want to read them. It's much eaiser and cleaner to
use the back and forward buttons of the browser to achieve the same result
among other ui features. I have real problems with anything that breaks ua
functionality such as opening a new window and in the process, disabling the
back button. it usually also disables print and save and a whole bunch of
other things.

For you maybe.
But what about others who can benefit from being able to have two
windows open.
Imagine a skilled developer who knows about accessibility and usability
issues: you'll never convince that person that new windows should never
be used. She might listen if you were to say "minimize the use of popup
windows because I get lost when there are too many of them", or, "let
me decide if I want popups or not". Hardcore denial only causes
developers to put up their defenses and as a result they will likely
ignore your pleas to get rid of popups. I would expect you and the
developer to adapt a little.
As that skilled developer I can not deny those who can benefit from
being able to see help in a new window while they work in another
window. Many, if not most sighted users would prefer this over having to
switch back and forth with the back button.
If I have a short term memory disability, I won't be able to remember
the instructions unless they are open in another window alongside. It
works both ways.
You don't need a back button in a help popup. Only a "close window" link
at the top so you know you're in a popup. It's when you don't know
you're in a popup window that disabling the UI features becomes a problem.
Opening external URLs in a new window is a different story, but again a
developer wants to keep you on his site. Denying them new windows will
on raise their defences. Ask them to open all external URLs in the
same window as a happy medium everyone can live with.

I won't answer one for one here but I will boil it down to this. I hear
preference and I hear useability. Despite what developers may want and
despite what looks pretty tosome people and despite what people might
perfer, we come down to one thing. there is a prinsiple called kiss and
though some what over used, it can be quite effective. I have never seen
any advantage for anyone for having new windows spawned all over the plac at
author will for the 'user's' sake. Nothing is really lost when this is
avoided and nothing is really gained if it is not but, and you knew there
had to be one didn't you? new windows are a hazzard for at least some people
and not having them causes no harm.

OK. You're missing my point. That being "You can't please all the people
all the time".
You are but one person (who incidentally is not pleased). If I give an
option to turn off popups, would you be happy?
Preferences, options, adaptibility,... go a lot further with developers
than dictating rules.
greg
When I had to re-engineer a Web-based application for the purposes of
accessibility, the help was in JavaScript popups. (We actually had a
controlled audience at the time - this is something that would have
worked for all users.)
The approach I took could be applied equally to a site/application that
spawns new browser windows - re-draw the current page with the help text
displayed in context. No to-ing and fro-ing with back/forward buttons
or having to ALT/TAB between windows (or whatever system you use for this).
Granted, this is easiest to achieve when you are generating pages
dynamically but for static sites, a version with help and version
without help could be produced.
My personal view on spawning new windows is that it is only acceptable
if the user agent can manage them in one window, such as with Mozilla's
tabbed browsing. Even then, it should only be done with the user's
consent. (Follow this link to open in new window || follow this link to
open in same window)
