Ah, yes, Internet Drafts expire after 6 months, and have to be refreshed.
Aaron did that, and the link should now be:

It's all very well for Internet Drafts to expire after 6 months, but
that doesn't mean the links have to expire too. It would be more
helpful to resolve to "the Internet Draft you're looking for has
expired, and if you want to read the old text anyway, go here" than to
"we don't know what you're talking about". IETF, of all people!

Your point is well made (and frequently made, in my experience),
but this forum has no mandate to do anything about it.
There is an IETF/W3C coordination forum where your point
would be in order:
Dan Connolly, W3C http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/
Hey, don't shoot me, I'm just the messenger!
(But I'll note that the IETF has, IIRC, just 6 full-time staff to deal with
all the admin and secretariat functions, so much less effort is available
to maintain web facilities compared with, say, W3C.)
