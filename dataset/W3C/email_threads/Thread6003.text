Hello All,
My name is Rich Bonneau. I am the primary representative for IONA Technologies to this working group (once my AC rep confirms in reply to this message). Our alternate representative is Sanjay Patil.
I am a Distinguished Engineer at IONA Technologies and work in the Office of the CTO but I am on loan currently to the engineering department, as technical director for our Web services product offereings in general and our orchestration related products in particular. In the past, I have worked on various integration products both within IONA and previously at Compaq, Digital Equipment Corporation and Raytheon. I have actively participated in the Xmethods- sponsored WSID (Web Services Integration Demonstration) efforts as well as the WS-I (Web Services Interoperability group).
We are very interested in the Web services choreography work area and I agree to participate in this working group as per the charter.
I do not have personal knowledge of any IPR claims held by IONA Technologies regarding Web Services choreography.
thanks,
Rich Bonneau
