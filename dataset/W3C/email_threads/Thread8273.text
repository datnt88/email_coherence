It seems to me that the BIND spec does not introduce a "bind" feature
to be reported in the DAV header of an OPTIONS response.
I think this should be added for the following reasons:
The feature list in the DAV header is useful for clients in deciding
which PROPFINDs need to be done in order to discover all that
is to know (= live properties) of a resource.
The nice thing about the DAV header is that a client can expect
this header to be rather static during the lifetime of a session.
In contrast, the supported-live-property-set can change quite
dramatically during the lifetime of a resource.
If a PROPFIND on DAV:resource-id will yield a meaningful response
cannot be deducted from the Allow header, since on non-collection
resources the BIND method will not be reported there.

I don't find this use case very compelling. You can just
ask for all the properties you care about, and then let
each resource return it if it supports it.
But I don't violently object, so if the consensus is to add
"bind" feature to the DAV header, that's OK with me.
Cheers,
Geoff

I'm fine with adding a "bind" feature to the DAV header.
