Well, I assessed (in my head) three specs (XHTML 1.0, SVG 1.0 and SMIL 2.0)
against the last draft of XAG and got the following results (expresed in
EARL). Hopefully this gives us something to play with, and the PF group
something to use when they need to do an implementation report.

Well, assuming my syntax came out correctly (I mostly did it by nasty hacking
code :( I ahve the following comments:
It seems from teh Schema that there are other results - notApplicable is one
I would have liked, but didn't know how to use.
I actually find it easier to work in XML syntax. Really. It would be nice to
have either examples in XML syntax, or get a conversion tool to make some for
us.
(Although what I would really prefer is a tool that did this for me. Maybe we
should owrk harder on hacking Art's Annotea bookmarklet toy...)
There are a fairly restricted range of earl: things - spec isn't in them. Do
we want to keep the others in earl? I would still like to use dublin core for
the creator of the statement, be it a person, a tool, or a flash of
inspiration in the form of a small talking bird...
I'm tired, so that's enough for now...

Well, I assessed (in my head) three specs (XHTML 1.0, SVG 1.0 and SMIL 2.0)
against the last draft of XAG and got the following results (expresed in
EARL). Hopefully this gives us something to play with, and the PF group

Subject: Re: Assessments for XAG in EARL
Kick-ass work, Chaals!
99% fine. The bookmarklet code needs updating (shhhhh! don't tell anyone).
earl:validity rdfs:range earl:ValidityState;
rdfs:domain earl:ResultProperty . [...]
earl:NotApplicable a earl:ValidityState .
]]] - http://www.w3.org/2001/03/earl/0.95#
So for example:-
_:x a earl:ResultProperty; earl:validity earl:NotApplicable .
However, I've grown out of favour of customized result property crap, and I
think that I have a better way of modelling it: it'll just have to wait for
EARL 0.96/0.97/1.0/+. We're already one step ahead of ourselves on most
EARL things... I really think that we should take a shot at a "definitive,
hey it's done" 1.0 version. We released 0.9 on the proviso that it would be
just a demo for the language, and although 0.95 made a couple of
improvements, it was much the same thing.
A handful of people do (DanBri, Chris, you).
Yes. There are quite a few things that I'd like to add to either EARL 0.95
(we can add things), or EARL 1.0.
No you wouldn't! You think you would, but really you wouldn't. Once you
start prefix/alias creep, you can't get rid of it...
Using Dublin Core in EARL is IMO precisely useless, and even if it were
useful, any tools that recognized it should be clever enough to go get the
EARL schema, search for property documentation, and find out that it's a
subPropertyOf some Dublin Core term.
So, even TimBL says to use other people's data... he didn't say where.
Putting it in the schema is neater than putting it in the instance, where
here we have a highly scoped application. If EARL were a patchwork of
several hundred existing schemata, there wouldn't be a problem... but as it
is, I think that the language is compact enough that it would be more of a
burden than a benefit to use terms external to the EARL namespace.
It's fine if people create terms for small talking birds, however :-)

I saw this. But it stayed as double-dutch to me - I was looking more for an
example of "I don't think that XAG 2.6 is applicable for XHTML 1.1" or
something.
No you wouldn't! You think you would, but really you wouldn't. Once you
start prefix/alias creep, you can't get rid of it...
Well, I'm going to go away and think some more, because I ahve thought hard
about this before and talked about it a lot and keep coming back with wanting
to use DC as is. I'll leave that open for now...
Cheers
