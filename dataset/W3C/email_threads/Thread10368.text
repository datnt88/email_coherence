Subject: NTC utility doesn't want to play

Hi,
I am trying to use the NTC utility at
files but it doesn't seem to like me.
I built it and it keeps saying that the files dont match even when they
do. Maybe I don't understand how its supposed to work. I am just trying
the samples (First.001, Second.002 etc etc) with the utility and this is
what I am getting.
Any help will be apprecaited before I start wading through the code.
ntc -d Second.001 First.001
First model read:
Dump of model.
Static triples:
foo:bar random:p2 "hoho" .
foo:bar random:p1 o1 .
Anonymous triples:
Done.
Second model read:
Dump of model.
Static triples:
Anonymous triples:
Done.
Comparing models:
Non-anonymous statement sets of different size
They don't match
It doesn't seem to be reading the second model.
Cheers,
Rahul Singh

For a start, it needs updating to actually be in legal standard C++.
I'll have a look Monday.

Ummm... my Haskell package (swish) contains a command line compare utility
(based on jeremy's compare algorithm) with Notation 3 input... I don't know
if that might be of help.
[Offline right now, so don't have URI, but look for 'swish' under software
at my ninebynine.org site.]

ooh :)
Another reason to actually read that Haskell book I bought
(leaving it under my pillow doesn't seem to be working...)

Thanks...
But does it help you sleep better ;-)

I forgot to mention, using the command line utility shouldn't need any
knowledge of Haskell. GHC will compile it to a stand-alone executable
(tested on Windows, should work on Linux/Unix).
