9: Proposed minor Changes to Primer Document
I interpret Frank as proposing:
PROPOSAL: The RDFCore WG recommends to the director that the minor editorial
fixes described in:
should be included in the version of the RDFCore Primer which is published
as a rec. The PR document with the fixes applied can be found at:
md5: b52ef70329d35310c92e51454167e076
This references an updated figure:

An htmldiff between the PR version and the updated version can be found at:
10: Proposed Expository Changes to the Semantics document
I interpret Pat as proposing:
PROPOSAL: The RDFCore recommends to the director that expository
improvements should be made to the RDF semantics document before it is
published as a rec. An updated version of the PR document can be found at:
md5 2dcd2292776e8274b6e8b288dd7022fb
[[Pat this is the ed-be version you prefer - would be good to confirm I
uploaded it correctly]]
An htmldiff between this version and the PR document can be found at:
[The checksum difference is caused by updating the CVS revision number
within the doc as a diff will verify]

Jan and Graham have agreed to review on behalf of the WG. Graham reports he
has started his review. Jan? Can we agree a date for completion of the

Graham has indicated willingness to accept such an action:
13: Docs at end of RDF and RDFS schema URIs
Status? Plans?

This is correct, with one exception: After considering Graham's
comments, I decided not to make one of the corrections listed in my
result, the list of editorial corrections actually included in "the PR
document with the fixes applied" cited in the agenda (and reflected in
the diff cited in the agenda) is:
* in the TOC, sections 5.1 and 5.2 need to have "Defining" replaced by
"Describing" to be consistent with the actual section titles.
* in Section 2.2, there are two instances of "example.com" that need to
be changed to "example.org" to be consistent with the overall example
* in Section 5.1, Figure 18 is upside down (class MotorVehicle should
be at the top, not the bottom). This was fixed early last year in
response to a comment from PPS, but somehow an earlier version of the
figure got loaded into TR space and I missed it. This is just a matter
of re-uploading the corrected figure.
* in Section 6.1, just above Example 32, there's a reference to Example
30 that should be a reference to Example 31.
* in the References, the [LBASE] reference has the right URL but the
wrong date (it should cite the 10 October 2003 version).
[I'd also note that another reason Figure 18 needs to be changed as
described above is for consistency with change entry for LCC-016, which
says it was changed to have the more general classes on top.]
Yes, thats the one. The one at
has a few more typos fixed (found by Frank) and the small
improvements to the change log suggested by Peter and Jeremy done, if
you feel like using it. Or if not, of course....
Pat
PS. I guess that either of these would need the 'this version'
thingie updated, right? I will leave that to the pubrules mavens.
