Hi,
I want to make available CSS3(including CSS1,CSS2) properties to
DOM through annotating the elements with custom attributes.
ex:
INPUT { user-input : enabled } // CSS3 Rule
transform to
INPUT userInput="enabled" ...  // HTML element
Is there any algorithm to annotate the DOM tree with few number of
traversals. It should take into consideration the inheritance, cascading
mechanisms.
If I am putting this question to a wrong mailing list, please
ignore.
Thanx
It sounds like you're asking for an implementation (or advice on building
an implementation) of a CSS processing engine. Correct?

Hi,
Right! I want to expose the new CSS3 User Interface Enhancement
properties to the HTML DOM. I want to manipulate the new properties with
HTML DOM, CSS mechanisms and through some scripting. I am trying an
experimental implementation as my Master's thesis work.
Yeah! I would like to know more about CSS processing engine. I
have HTMLDOM builder and CSS parser. I want to automate the annotation
and arrive at an enhanced ( with new Attibute and value pairs ) HTML page
for further manipulation through again DOM. Would you please suggest me.
Thanx.
