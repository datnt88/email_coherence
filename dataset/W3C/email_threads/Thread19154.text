Hi,
I've done an amaya 5.3 package for Mac OS X (using fink). If people
could check it works and report success to the fink project it will be
moved to the 'stable' branch. Details follow:
Amaya 5.3 (and 5.3 with gtk) is now available for Mac OS X via fink
( http://fink.soureforge.net ). It can be found in the CVS checked-out
packages under unstable. See the fink FAQ for for details on how to
update the packages via CVS, and how to use packages from unstable.
Changes necessary for this package:
Mofif/Lesstif :
configure patched to replace references to /sw/Lesstif with base /lib
and base /include - fixing a problem when Lesstif has been moved out
of base /Lesstif (in new Lesstif packages) and also when /sw is not
the base installation directory (rare, but possible).
- -force_flat_namespace added to Options.in. Fixes dynamic linking on
Mac OS X 10.1.
Gtk :
added -I base /include to Options.in (couldn't find imlib).
Both :
Changed refs in configure to 'appkit' to 'apppkit' to prevent
it finding Cocoa appkit.
Changed amaya/Makefile.libwww to link against the amaya-supplied
libwww. This fixes a build failure if the libwww fink package was
installed (ironically).

Well, I installed it. I did the following:
Set fink to use unstable packages. Update fink (I already have it installed,
with Motif, etc, but those should autoinstall if required). In updating it,
it asked if I wanted to use CVS versions - I said yes.
install amaya.
go away and have a cup of tea - it took a long time to compile, but no
problems and runs fine (working with Motif version).
cheers

Hum? The CVS version is very unstable currently.
Hum? The CVS version is very unstable currently.
Aah. Fink is a packaging system for Macintosh OS X, and it can either use
debian-style packages (created for Mac) or it can compile from source - and
if it compiles from source it can use complete source packages or it can
update packages via CVS (the recommended option).
So fink provides the stable release version of Amaya 5.3, but as an untested
(unstable?) part of the fink CVS update that is available, not as a tested
and stable part of the fink package list.
anyway, it is easy to install now, and it works.
cheers
