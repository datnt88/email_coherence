Is there anyone using the specprod DTD who has produced
output where each top-level section is in a different
file / HTML page?

As you already know, the DOM WG is producing a lot of files with
the specprod DTD ... but we're not using XSL.

Well, an XSL-based solution would certainly be of interest,
but I don't want to rule anything out. How do you guys do
it?

See http://dev.w3.org/cvsweb/spec-prod/html/
It has versions of the xmlspec stylesheets which do slices.
