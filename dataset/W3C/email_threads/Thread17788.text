My responses in CMN:
OJG:
Provide programmatic access for dependent user agents to read and
manipulate the content in the currently rendered HTML content (or document
tree).
IJ:
Can we say "document tree" if that'swhat we mean?
JRG: Is the document tree also apart of multi-media players?
Why I said content instead of the document tree is that I want to include
in this checkpoint mult-media players and other plugins like Adobe Acobat
that may not be HTML. Maybe we could have 2 checkpoints one for HTML
content (or W3C recommended content) which could use the term document tree
and another for proprietary content (non-W3C recommend content). Document
Tree sounds more technical to me than just content, but as long as it is
interpreted as the same thing I guess it is alright.
CMN:
I don't think we need two checkpoints. I think we should use document
tree, (or a similar term - we are trying to get at the thing which is
modelled by the DOM in certain languages) and define it. The document tree
includes all the elements within a document - for a GIF that might be a
single image (but it might be several images, a title, some
animation looping controls, etc).
OJG:
Checkpoint 7.2.b [Priority 1]
Provide programmatic access for dependent user agents to desktop user agent
controls: including menus, toolbars and other user interface elements that
are used to direct and control the rendering of WWW content.
IJ:
What does the last clause: "that are used to direct andcontrol" mean?
JRG: It is just my attempt to be inclusive of all types of user interface
controls. I think it would be also good to add the phrase "and indicate
status or other orientation information".
CMN:
I don't think the clause in question is necessary - this is a list of some
examples of user agent controls. I also think that this should not be
restricted to desktop user agents - access to controls should be available
in both directions.

OJG:
Checkpoint 7.2.e [Priority 2]
Provide a programmatic interface for dependent user agents to manipulate
the rendering of WWW content.
IJ:
This sounds too vague. We were asked to break out checkpointsin Guideline
5.1. Why not here?
JRG: This could be removed if 7.2.a is changed to include manipulation.
CMN:
Seems like a good idea to me.
OJG:
Provide a programmatic interface for dependent user agents to know if a
link (anchor) has been visited or not.
IJ:
The specificity of this one strikes me when compared to the other ones. I
agree with it, but it could be part of several ofthe previous checkpoint.
JRG: This was a topic of discussion in the last telecon and some people
felt it was important. It is not available through DOM and probablt never
will do to privacy issues. So I included it as a low priority checkpoint.
IE already exposes this information through Active Accessibility.
CMN:
I don't think this is a DOM issue. I think the information should be
available, along with other information of the same nature, in section 6.1
Responses to Ian are in JRG:
Current checkpoint in 31 March WD
7.2.1 [Priority 1]
For desktop graphical browsers. Export programmatic interfaces to ATs and
follow operating system conventions to do so
Expanded checkpoints from 7.2.1 (other checkpoints in guideline 7.2 would
remain).
Checkpoint 7.2.a [Priority 1]
Provide programmatic access for dependent user agents to content in the
currently rendered WWW content.
Does access mean read/write?
JRG: This is a good question. I think we want to give the opportunity to
read and write so maybe we should restate the guideline as:
Provide programmatic access for dependent user agents to read and
manipulate the content in the currently rendered HTML content (or document
tree).
Can we say "document tree" if that'swhat we mean?
JRG: Is the document tree also apart of multi-media players?

JRG: It is just my attempt to be inclusive of all types of user interface
controls. I think it would be also good to add the phrase "and indicate
status or other orientation information".
Does that imply not all menus or functionalities available through menus?
JRG: some functionalities may not be available through menus
Checkpoint 7.2.c [Priority 1]
Provide programmatic access for dependent user agents to be informed about
changes in the active control and element focus.
Can we say "selection" and "focus"?
JRG: Sure
Checkpoint 7.2.d [Priority 1]
Provide a programmatic interface for dependent user agents to simulate user
interface and WWW content control events.
Checkpoint 7.2.e [Priority 2]
Provide a programmatic interface for dependent user agents to manipulate
the rendering of WWW content.

I would like to present a revised proposal for Desktop Graphical User Agnet
compatibility with AT:
Checkpoint 7.2.a [Priority 1]
Provide programmatic access for dependent user agents to content rendered
on graphical displays.
Technique
This is designed for current screen reader technology and other assistive
technology that is using display rendering to gather information about WWW
content. Current techniques include:
1. Active Accessibility
2. Java Swing Classes
3, Selective use of operating system techniques for rendering graphical
information
Checkpoint 7.2.b [Priority 1]
Provide programmatic access for dependent user agents to the document
object model (DOM).
Technique
This is designed for specialized user agents and other assistive
technologies that can use the DOM to access information about WWW content
directly. This includes the ability to both read and manipulate the
contents of the document object model. The main issue here is providing
guidiance in exporting the DOM to the dependent user agents.
Checkpoint 7.2.c [Priority 1]
Provide programmatic access for dependent user agents to desktop user agent
controls: including
menus, toolbars, help systems and other user interface elements of the
desktop graphical user agent.
Technique
This is designed for screen readers and other assistive technology that is
using display rendering to gather information about content. Current
techniques include:
1. Active Accessibility
2. Java Swing Classes
3, Selective use of operating system techniques for rendering menus,
controls, help systems and toolbars
Checkpoint 7.2.d [Priority 1]
Provide a programmatic interface for dependent user agents to be informed
of changes to the focus and selection.
Technique
Dependent user agents should be able to know what elements are selected and
which control has the focus.
Checkpoint 7.2.e [Priority 1]
Provide a programmatic interface for dependent user agents to simulate user
interface and WWW content control events and to change the user agent focus
and selection.
Technique
Assistive technologies should be able to simulate user interface events to
provide alternative activations of user interface and WWW content controls.
Checkpoint 7.2.f [Priority 1]
Fully implement DOM Level 1 and other DOM spefications that improve
accessibility.
Technique
This allows specialized browsers to full access to the WWW content. All
elements and attributes should be represented in the model, even if the
graphical user agent does not use them in its own graphical rendering of
the content.
