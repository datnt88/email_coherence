I just skimmed through the XForms Basic Working Draft 4 December 2003:
and have a few comments. The draft directs comments to
htmlforms@damowmow.com and www-archive@w3.org which i guess are mailing
lists. I'm not subscribed to any of these, so please cc replies to
bob@db.org.
"An e-mail address, as defined by [RFC822] (the mailbox token,
defined in RFC822 section 6.1)."
First of all, if you're going to refer to an RFC it should probably
be RFC 2822 which obsoletes RFC 822.
Second; please don't force client and server programmers to parse
the horrible syntax of an RFC 2822 "mailbox". If it's unclear why
this is a bad idea, I can come up with a few examples of valid
RFC 2822 "mailbox"-es to show how bad it can get. Or you can just
believe me when i say it's a disaster :-)
maxlength:
"...When this attribute is specified on text or password
controls, the server must not submit a form with the control
having more..."
You probably meant to say "..the client must not..."
Other then that, nice initiative!

The draft directs comments to htmlforms@damowmow.com and
www-archive@w3.org which i guess are mailing lists.
www-archive is the public archival system at the W3C:
...and htmlforms@damowmow.com is an alias for ian@hixie.ch.
"An e-mail address, as defined by [RFC822] (the mailbox token,
defined in RFC822 section 6.1)."
Good idea.
Would you rather require that every form author write a parser instead?
Currently, forms generally try to validate e-mail addresses and frequently
do so in a naive way, leading to many people not being able to use those
forms with their e-mail addresses. (For example, people with periods in
their username.)
By requiring that the UA do this instead of the author, we reduce the
number of implementations that need to be debugged by maybe six orders of
magnitude.

"...When this attribute is specified on text or password
controls, the server must not submit a form with the control
having more..."
Yup, thanks.

Nope, the idea of having a type="email" attribute for input elements
is a good one. What I don't like is that the value of this element is
defined to be a RFC 2822 "mailbox"
The following is a valid RFC 2822 "mailbox":
-----[Start RFC 2822 mailbox]-----
Bob
(You wouldn't think\)
Smith "at home)"Johannessen"
bob
(amazing)db.
(isn't it)org
-----[End RFC 2822 mailbox]-----
If you're looking for a field to only accept the address, without the
display name (bob@db.org, not "Bob Johannessen" bob@db.org ), I'd
suggest you specify RFC 2822 "addr-spec" *without* FWS and CFWS. If
you want to include the display name in the field, use RFC 2822 mailbox
*without* FWS and CFWS.
I'd prefer the former (limited/modified RFC 2822 addr-spec), as I see
no reason why the display name can't be expressed in another input
element.

Good call. Updated.
