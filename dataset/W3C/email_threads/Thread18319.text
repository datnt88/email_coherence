Hello,
Per my action from the 17 November face-to-face meeting [1],
please consider this proposal for addressing issue 348 [2]
(characterized by Al as editorial). Checkpoint and other UAAG
references here are with respect to the 23 October draft [3].
[1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/2000/11/minutes-20001116.html#issue-348

[3] http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-UAAG10-20001023/
Summary of the proposal:
1) Include requirements that the user agent provide mechanisms
for highlighting selection, focus, recently visited links, and
active elements.
2) Include requirements that, by default, the highlight
mechanisms (whether visual or aural) for selection, focus,
recently visited links, and active elements:
a) Not rely on color alone.
b) Differ from each other, and not by color alone.
c) Differ in style from the user agent's default text style
(e.g., color information, font information).
3) Include requirements that the user be able to configure how
selection, focus, recently visited links, and active elements
are highlighted.
4) Include a requirement that the user be able to configure
the default foreground and background colors for visually
rendered text.
5) Related ideas that are not requirements:
a) Caution that user that if they override the defaults for
any one of these mechanisms, they may have to pay attention
to the others.
b) Suggest that the user agent allow the user to configure
them all at once.
CHECKPOINTS:
There is only one new checkpoint proposed (8.X, which is
essentially factored out of several others). There are also some
clarifications and harmonization done.
4.3 Allow the user to configure the foreground and background
color of all text, with an option to override foreground and
background colors specified by the author or user agent
defaults. Allow the user to select from among the range of
system colors.
Note: User configuration of foreground and background colors
may result in the inability to distinguish unhighlighted
text from selected text, focused text, etc. See checkpoint
8.X for more information about highlight styles.
[This proposal supersedes:
4.17 Allow the user to configure how the content focus and
current selection are highlighted (e.g., through foreground
and background color, voice pitch, etc.).
Note: See checkpoint 8.X for more information about
highlight styles.
[This proposal is based on the version from the 14 December teleconf:
8.2 Provide a mechanism for highlighting recently visited
links. Allow the user to configure the highlighting style.
Note: See checkpoint 8.X for more information about
highlight styles.
8.3 Provide a mechanism for highlighting links that have been
marked up to indicate that following them will involve a fee
("fee links"). Allow the user to configure the highlighting
style.
Note: See checkpoint 8.X for more information about
highlight styles.
[However, refer to proposal to demote 8.3 and add a config
requirement:
8.7 Provide a mechanism for highlighting the current
viewport. The default highlight mechanism must not rely on
color alone.
8.8 Provide a mechanism for highlighting active elements.
Allow the user to configure the highlighting style.
Note: For example, most graphical user agents highlight all
the links on a page so that users know where to
interact. See checkpoint 8.X for more information about
highlight styles.
8.X Ensure that the default highlight styles for the
selection, focus, active elements, recently visited links, and
fee links (1) do not rely on color alone, and (2) differ from
each other and not by color alone. [Priority 1]
Note: For instance, a graphical user agent by default might
present the selection using color and a dotted outline, the
focus using a solid outline, active elements as underlined
in blue, recently visited links as dotted underlined in
purple, and fee links using a special icon or flag to draw
the user's attention.
Note: If the user overrides the default styling for any one
of these mechanisms, the new styling may interfere with the
others. Therefore, the user agent should allow the user to
configure them all at once or should alert the user to
potential conflicts when change are made.
ISSUES
1) For checkpoints 8.2, 8.3 and 8.8 (related to links and active
elements): Does the user agent have to show all active zones of a
client-size image map? Does the user agent have to highlight as
a recently visited link a zone of an image map? Should these
checkpoints refer to text links alone?
OTHER COMMENTS
1) I support Jon's proposal to modify (essentially delete)
checkpoint 8.6 (issue 421):

two comments.
1 what graphical user agent uses audio in this fashion since it is my
impresion that we are modeling for graphical desktop user agents, do
we need pitch?
2 could we have something a bit more clear than "fee link"?
a fee link is not the same as one that is visitted or not visitted
etc. this is a link that when followed does something specific and
the designation of that link may change to visitted but still stays as
a fee link.
Thanks!
Seems reasonable.
I think that a user agent should be required to (be cnfigurable to) show
active regions of an image map in some way. implementation example, Amaya.
Otherwise it can be difficult for a sighted user to determine what regions
exist, and where they go (this should have been done by the content author
anyway, but it may not have, or may not be effective for some reason).
