Hi
In a user forum of an XSLT processor, it was asked if allowing AVTs
inside regexen should be disallowed because coders could forget to
escape curly braces that aren't meant to delimit AVTs, eg quantifier
delimiters.
I just wanted to say that I think that you should continue to allow AVTs
inside regexen. This offers flexibility, and coders can be expected to
remember escaping [note].

'Note:
Because the regex attribute is an attribute value template, curly braces
within the regular expression must be doubled. For example, to match a
sequence of one to five characters followed by whitespace, write
regex=".{{1,5}}\s".'
Thanks for the comment. We have had some discussion on this in the working
group. We are looking for a way to retain the current functionality while
avoiding the current "gotcha" where the user obtains wrong results if they
forget to double the braces. It might be that the problem can be solved
adequately with a warning from the compiler - we'll see.

Sounds good.
If you find a solution which saves the coder potential trouble then
that's great (perhaps \{5\} instead of {{5}} ), but even if no such
solution can be found, I think AVTs inside regexen should be allowed.
