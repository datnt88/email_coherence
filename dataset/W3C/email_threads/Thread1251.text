Unfortunately, different systems use different mapping tables from
Shift-JIS to Unicode. The same thing applies to ISO-2022-JP and
Japanese EUC. Such mapping tables are very unlikely to disappear
soon. More about this, see XML Japanese Profile at:
Such unstable mapping spoils interoperatibility and is fatal
especially for digital signature. Although we do not have any really
good solutions, we can assign different charset names to different
mapping tables.
For this reason, I am going to propose quite a few charsets for
Shift-JIS, Japanese EUC, and ISO-2022-JP. They are new charsets
rather than aliases of existing charsets (i.e., shift_jis, euc-jp,
iso-2022-jp), which does not have agreed mapping tables.

Hello Makoto,
I have tried to look at the .xml files you cited.
But I got validation errors with various tools.
E.g. in http://www.w3.org/TR/japanese-xml/x-sjis-cp932.xml,
XMLSpy complains that there is no ID on characterMapping
(required according to
My guess is that the problem is due to some updates in
the CharacterMapping DTD. I'm coping Mark to check.
I suggest that you investigate the problems. If necessary,
you can always resubmit the XML Japanese Profile Note
to fix errors.
Regards, Martin.
The DTD was changed in the last version (December last year). The changes
are listed in http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr22/#Modifications
The major change was the removal of import , which the UTC felt made the
validity checking too cumbersome. In the previous version, you could use
imports to override mappings in another version.
Unfortunately, I see that you use import extensively, so that you would
have to regenerate the files in their complete form.
[There are three more changes that were approved this year for 2022 and some
other minor cases, but they are backwards compatible.]

Martin,
Thank you very much for your quick reply. I have updated mapping
files.
I find that TR#22 uses the source - name_on_source - version
syntax for identifiers. I am wondering if I should change
names. Since the Japanese XML Profile has been available
for a while, I don't want to change.
Cheers,
Makoto
Hello Mark,
Is it possible for the UTC to provide a version of this DTD that
is guaranteed not to change (even if it may become outdated by
a new version)? This would help avoid problems in the future.
As for import , I think the main functionality that Makoto needs
(small file size, no data duplication) can be achieved with
XML entities.
Regards, Martin.
We plan only backwards compatible changes at this point. One of the reasons
import was dropped was exactly that it could be done with entities, and the
older definition was complicated by the need to resolve conflicts. I will
bring this up at the UTC, though, so that we can record this as a policy.

I would recommend using the TR-format names, and supplying the other as an
alias.
I have decided to use the following TR-format names without aliases.
My next E-mails will use these names for referencing character maps.
I will soon rename the character mapes in the W3C technical report
"XML Japanese Profile".
