Members will be aware that by far the majority of the w3c site is text
based. For non readers with cognitive disability, it comes close to being a
paradigm or inaccessability. I wish to draw the attention of all of you to
this deficit.
The code for a(ny) site is textual and essential, however if we all had to
read and understand this before visiting a site, no one would bother.
Could we please try to demonstrate by example before explaining the method.
This system has a very ancient precedent QED. quad erat demonstrandum, or
what was to be shown.
Two examples of the problems that will occur presently,
1 Recently there was a request for information on colour, to attempt to
define
this with words is derisable. It is difficult enough to penetrate the
methods used by experts.
2 I have been asked offline to help identify games sites that are w3c
accessible. I consider this to be virtually impossible, however without
specific examples it is nonsense.
first demonstrate what you wish then explain.
W3C desperately needs to simplify its goals and practice what it is
preaching.

Yes, everyone should be able to _access_ the information, and
there should be a guarantee of _that_, but I cannot stomach the
idea that it is _my_ obligation to make _every_ piece of
information "understandable" in a way that is obvious to someone
with a learning disability.
Kynn, you haven't "accessed" information until you can "understand" it.
Anything less, isn't "access", it's an approximation.
Anne,
Demonstrate, please, how to express the following concept so that a child,
someone with cognitive disabilities, and someone with a low IQ can
understand it sufficiently that you would label it as "accessible", WITHOUT
changing the very specific detail required of a technical specification:
(the following is a real passage from a book I'm currently working on. It
is *already* prose vs. the EBNF declaration that is the primary resource
for such information)
So far, our element declarations have dealt with sub-elements that must
occur; that is, none have been optional, nor have they explicitly been able
to occur more than once. In order to indicate a sub-element's optional or
recurring status, you need to add an occurrence indicator to the element
declaration. Occurrence indicators are single character symbols that appear
immediately after the generic identifier name or sequence of names. For
instance, if we chose to make the nuts in our ice-cream sundae element
optional, we would write:
The ? symbol in this declaration indicates that the sub-element is
optional, and may occur zero or 1 times within the parent element.
Until the *how* is demonstrated, the reaction you're going to get from web
developers is "gee, that's well intentioned, but naive/unreasonable". The
reality for this example may be the same as that initial reaction.
Note that this exercise doesn't even begin to address the issue of why a
child needs to understand occurance indicators within element declarations
in an XML DTD, or why a technical discussion is obligated to make such
information "understandable" by anyone who may come across it.
Ann
An attempt (I'm really too tired to do this justice, and not skilled enough,
but I believe that it can be done.
When we make something, there are things it has to have. This is what we have
done so far.
We can also make something with things that it might have. We have to show
which things have to be there, and which are the things that might be there.
We can do this with a marker like "?".
In this example of a sundae,
icecream and whipped cream have to be there.
The fudge and caramel are in brackets "(" and ")" We have to have something
that is in the brackets. But because there is the marker "|" between them, we
know that we can choose which one we want.
But we can have nuts, or not have nuts. the "?" marker with the nuts
lets us know that it is something we can have but don't have to.
( I have assumed from the context that the general notation had already been
explained, and that I have understood it more or less correctly.
I wrote that straight off in two minutes as an immediate reply. It is clearly
possible to increaase the accessibility of such a concept dramatically.
It seems that there is a continuum of accessibility in this area as in
others. We should be aiming to capture as much of that continuum as possible,
and the factors that influence our decision will include our own ability, the
cost of providing the benefit, and our own perception of the audience. Two of
these factors rely on us to make the effort to know better, and one of them
is an external constraint on how much we are prepared to do, both in learning
and in carrying out the necessary tasks.
I feel that there is a mutual obligation. Those of us who claim to know about
accessibility, and to provide skills in this area, are obliged to refine and
further our skills. Those of us who have expertise, particularly in an area
where that expertise seems rare, or the necessity for it seems poorly
understood, need to spread that expertise.
There are clearly strategies which can be used to improve the accessibility
of a website to people with cognitive disabilities - the use of illustrative
images, language which is as clear and simple as possible in the
circumstances, the addition of multimedia presentations which reduce reliance
on text as the only method of communication, all have a part to play.
Likewise, the use of images and sounds as an aid to accessibility needs to be
handled with care to ensure that it does not get in the way of accessibility
for some other group. Again I would draw attenetion to the needs of people
who are deaf - sound is not particularly cvaluable to them, but images and
movement are, since many of them are "illiterate" in their primary sign
language and therefore have to learn a second language represented in
abstract symbols without the benefit of having learned how to use abstract
static symbols.
Having worked 40 hours straight, I apologise if I am not even less clear than
normal.

The concept is accessible already, according to WAI guidelines. I still
don't accept that accessibility automatically equates to
"understandability". (Must I understand the symbolism in a Picasso to have
it be accessible to me?)
The question still remains:
While the language was simplified, does it still impart the required
technical information for those who need to use it in that manner. In my
opinion, it does not -- because important terms and definitions have been
removed in favor of "understandability".
The new sample does not define an "occurance indicator", a term that must
be used for clear an concise communication about DTDs. Nor does it
appropriately label items such as the generic identifier name. So even
though someone might understand that when we make things, it must have
other things, and this thing we're calling a sundae may not have nuts, the
sample has not done what it was supposed to do: Define and demonstrate the
use of occurance indicators that are placed on generic identifier names --
a critical skill used in writing DTDs.
The original assertion in this argument was that the W3C site must be
written in a manner similar to your sample in order to have any credibility
in discussing accessibility.
My argument remains that doing so is inapprorpiate for that type of site --
technical specifications are specific by their very nature. Third-party
prose may certainly choose to improve understandability for the lay person,
but requiring technical specs to be written at a third grade level woul
render them quite useless as a defining spec.
Put another way -- having the Pratt-Whitney jet engine repair manuals
written at a third grade level might be "good" so that they can be
understandable to anyone who might want to pick it up -- but if that
results in enough loss of specificity that an error is made by a mechanic
who met his job requirement of understanding college-level material but
must use a third-grade level repair manual, simply because the language
explaining what a foo is and how it was supposed to be inserted into the
widget was too general -- and that error results in the loss of a plane in
a crash.......then we've "understood" ourselves into disaster.

Ah. it appears I misunderstood what was being conveyed. It is clearly
possible to give the jargon name for the things I described (this kind of
marker is called...). And I agree that a description of a Pratt-Whitney Jet
engine which failed to convey the right information is wrong.
I think the issue here is what the boundaries of accessibility are. If I
heard the question about Picasso in the normal course of conversation then I
would answer yes- that I think it is precisely when you understand the
symbolism of Picasso that it is accessible. And the deeper an understanding
you have, the more accessible it is.
Accessibility is about understanding. It is very difficult for a blind person
to understand an image, and very easy for many of them to understand some
"equivalent text", particularly in the context of searching the web for
information. Think about the challenge of making a painting by Rothko (who
does big squares of colour - for example all rust red with variations in
shade and hue and tone) to a blind person. Or even to me. If I never saw
Rothko paintings again my life would probably not be very different, since
they are inaccessible to me already. But if somebody could explain to me what
was interesting about such a painting, then they would make a difference to
me.
In terms of making a particular site more accessible, there are things we can
do. Just as there are with accessibility for people who are blind, deaf, have
motor disabilities, etc there is a whole continuum of accessibility for
people with learning disabilities. There are a corresponding range of things
we can do, from providing multimedia presentations of the material on a site
which are designed to teach deaf children with learning disabilities, step by
step, how to implement an XML parser, to making our writing style clearer and
providing more graphic illustration of the ideas we express.
Although I think the WAI guidelines are very good, I do not think that
meeting the guidelines is proof of accessibility. The phrase I use is that
meeting the guidelines would make a "rebuttable presumption" - which is a
term that a lawyer told me. It means if you do what the guidelines say, then
you can say "I think I have done it right", and people should have to show
you what you did wrong. But if you don't do something in the guidelines, then
that is something wrong.
In the original example, I would suggest that it does not follow two
checkpoints - the one about writing clearly and the one about illustrating.
Both of these are P3 in the current guidelines, and it has been suggested by
Anne, Dave and others that these are in fact more important than P3 in the
context of learning disabilities. I look forward to learning more.

If accessibility is about understanding, the WAI guidelines need some
serious additional work, because they provide access to content, not a
guarantee (nor even the mechanism) that anyone can understand that content.

I think you have summarised this thread very neatly. It seems to me that Web
Content Accesibility Guidelines version 1.0 is not being read in a way that
makes the requirement for comprehensibility clear. The first aork item from
this thread, then, is to see whether the best approach is to work on updating
the guidelines, or on better education, or on some other approach.
I have raised this issue in the working group, and it is being actively
considered.
(Web accessibility is about access to the content of the web, regardless of
disability. Blind people could use a graphics tool such as xv to determine
what colour each pixel of each image was. This meets the requirement for
ability to find out what the content is, without meeting any rquirement for
comprehensibility. For people whose disability affects their ability to read
vast slabs of text, there are approaches which can be used to solve their
problems of access too.)

I don't think it's necessarily that simple of an issue.
The guidelines that prescribe ALT text for images provide a mechanism for
content to be delivered -- the process of understanding that content takes
place after access to it.
Except that I'm (and a few others) are arguing that this isn't an access
problem -- they most definitely have access to it.
What's at issue is when is it appropriate to provide "simplified" versions
of content, or significant page weight in images and multimedia content to
meet the needs of individuals who don't really have the cognitive ability
to manage the material -- simplified presentation or not.
If we issue guidelines that say any Web site that deals with the Green Bay
Packers football team must have an image of a football, the football field,
and a CheeseHead in order to be "understood" by all -- we're at the same
time violating other guidelines and good Web authoring practices that
advocate limiting gratuitous use of heavy bandwidth items (and yes, in this
case, I'd argue those additions would be superflous).
One size fits all doesn't work in clothing, nor does it work in education
-- we've found that out long ago that gifted students often begin to "fail"
in "one level" classrooms because they aren't challenged. So many school
systems implemented gifted or honors programs in most high schools.
Students with learning disabilities are given extra coaching, or an
assistant to take notes for them so they can concentrate on listening to
the lecture, etc.
Following one of the arguments presented here, the curriculum in that
gifted program must be written in a manner that a student with sub-par
comprehension skills can also understand it -- *even* at the expense of
required specificity in an advanced topic. What will that really have
accomplished? And who will it have served?
The reason that the WAI guidelines have been successful so far is that they
DON'T require catering to the lowest common denominator. Requiring
simplified text in inappropriate situations is a quick way to kill that
success.
As I said near the beginning of the thread, it is not the job of the PhD
candidate writing a thesis on mathematical chaos theory to give me remedial
instruction in it just because she may be publishing it on the Web. This
doesn't mean that general audience sites should purposefully embrace
obfuscation, it simply means:
There will be things in this world not everyone will understand. Attempting
to mandate otherwise is unattainable.

I don't think it is appropriate to provide a simplified, heavyweight page of
content to people wo cannot make use of it. However, I think that adding
images and multimedia to a page, and clarifying the writing, can be used to
make it comprehensible, and therefore accessible, to a wider audience, in the
same way that adding alternative content to be used in place of those images
can make it comprehensible and therefore accessible to a wider audience.
If we issued guidelines that said when discussing the Packers you need an
image of a football, a cheesehead and a field, then we would be overly
restrrictive about what we are doing. But those things are appropriate
illustrations. When I went to Wisconsin and saw them I could make sense of a
lot more written stuff, and I consider myself pretty thoroughly literate.
Somebody who recognised the symbols but was not very literate would gain in
ways precisely complementary.
The guidelines say roughly the same thing about using images and simple
language as they do about alternative content - that they should be
appropriate. That is meant to imply that the content should not be simplified
where that would cause a loss of meaning or specificity.
We can no more mandate people having an arbitrary level of cognitive ability
than we can mandate that everyone can see or hear. However it seems that
there are things we can do which will help us move towards the goal of a web
which is accessible to everybody. I may never understand Rothko, and some
people may never understand quantum mechanics. But just as words can help
someone who cannot see make some sense of a picasso or the construction of a
jet engine, images and sounds can enable someone who cannot read to make
sense of formal symbolisms, or of a jet engine (assuming they can hear, which
of course is not always the case).

Charles,
i agree that it is clear that site publishers prefer to keep control over their
graphic content.
However History is currently verbal, and their is little to indicate that this is
the preferred idiom.
If publishers provided linked images, a vastly improved searching strategy is
possible.
It is good enough for the stock exchange I commend it to you.
Jonathan
Could you elaborate on this? What has the stock exchange done?
