Just one (amateurish) comment on a couple of aspects of Matthew
Brealey's list
of putative bugs.
I didn't say they were all bugs - I referred to bugs/suggestions.
The character reference stuff is certainly a bug.
I'm not sure whether or not this is a bug in Tidy. Whether it is or
isn't, my
mind boggles at the idea of somebody who's clearly no novice running a
utility
whose results are as radical as Tidy's to overwrite a file without
first making
a backup. Surely a better way is to make a backup, or, better still,
to avoid
the -m switch and instead get Tidy to create a second file (which is
what I
always do).
Ideally, yes. But when you have a 600-file website (as with my new site),
it can be a little tedious to trawl through each file individually, so I
tend to do a for/in for each directory (although some pages I leave as
they are - for example, it will drop the following:
div style="width: 200px; height: 200px; background: red" /div as
empty).
But I find it necessary to tidy because I write all my HTML by hand, and
tend to omit end tags, which isn't a good idea because it can cause
Netscape to crash (given:
Some text
Some text
) , so I instruct Tidy to stick them back in again.

Strange.
Some days ago, a person named T. Schick complained that she
received messages from the list, when she had never subscribed to it.
So, did you subscribe ?
If yes, send the correct request to the owner of the list.
If not, is it possible that someone forwards messages to your address ?
You can get informations about this by examining closely your messages
headers (full header, not the usual one)

What I found was good practise was this:
1) on all new files, run tidy on them twice
2) check that the final output is acceptable still
3) if not acceptable, correct the original, and repeat
4) else accept the correct file
The twice-tidied files are fairly conservative. And well-formed
enough that I can simply add new material to pages and re-tidy the
updated pages blind (in fact, for a while I would just do it using
a process that ran at night).
Running tidy once does not remove all ideosyncracies. So I think for
larger sites in which you will have to maintain and update pages
regularly, it is better to use tidy individually on each page to
*detect* any gross errors. After that, the pages are safe for
the nice automated approach.

(Of course, if the site is very large and consistent, it may be
better to not store data in HTML at all: store as XML and convert
out to HTML. In which case, tidy is useful to test the conversion
script or to allow fix up slack output.)
Hello all. This is the first time I've spoken up here. And I'm pretty new
even as a lurker, so apologies if I'm retreading old ground with what
follows.

Thus, where I have
p
Some b bold text - accidentally missed off the ' /b ' it thinks that I wanted the boldness to span the whole of the rest of the
document, and as a result I have to manually remove the hundreds of tags
it adds (on one particularly extreme occasion it converted one of my
(very
complex and difficult to recreate) test pages into a whole load of PRE
elements, and because of restrictions on the elements that can occur
within PRE applied my style declarations on BR thereby destroying
several hours of work).

However, I have to say that Dave Raggett's explanation (or the 13 January
version) is slightly to blame, in that it does the extreme opposite of
treating
I generally use the -m option to get tidy to update the
original file. . . .
He may be wise to do that, but if so it's for the very simple reason that
his
ability to write decent HTML is way above that of Joe Schmoe web-page
writer
(e.g. myself). I'd strongly suggest rewording this bit along the following
lines:
If you're pretty sure that your page has only the most minor
imperfections, or if you've made a backup copy, you might
use the -m option to get tidy to update the original file.
But remember that tidy may work in a very unexpected
way, producing something quite unlike what you intended.
So I suggest that you redirect output to a second file.
and only discard the old file when you're sure you like the
newer one. If you're using the Windows/MS-DOS command
line, you'd need to write something like
tidy -c config.txt dirtyold.htm  cleannew.htm
(NB most of us Wintel-using dumbos have either forgotten what "input and
output
default to stdin and stout respectively" means, or never learnt it in the
first
place.)

I have asked the W3C list admin folk to allow you to mail the
list without being subscribed with a spam filter to reduce
spam. I don't know when this change will be in place though.
