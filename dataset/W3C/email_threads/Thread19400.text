1. The Open file' dialog only shows me files with .html extension. I
guess later versions will use a standard Motif-like file selector box?
2. When typing in the `Open location' field in the file dialog box,
the program appears to try to read the directory after every key I
type. This is much too slow. Try it on an AFS volume...
3. The `Format' dialog box shows labels like `miidn', `meiin' and
`mfogn', where I suppose `left' `center' and `right' is meant. Other
labels in that box have nonsense text as well.
4. When I edit in the structure view and press the delete or ^D key,
no other keys are accepted any more until I click the mouse...
5. When I try to remove an element like EM (make it plain text again),
you'll have to select `emphasis' from the menu again. There is no
indication in the menu that this is a toggle. A checkbox next to the
menu item would have been nice. A menu item `plain' that removes all
character-level elements at once could also be useful.
6. Is it possible to add a `smart spaces' mode, that automatically
removes superfluous spaces?
7. I put the cursor between two words, selected `emphasis' to insert
an EM element, then changed my mind and selected `emphasis' again to
remove it. But an element of some sort remained that I couldn't
delete. The structure view showed:
on a page can
enhance your
The empty line in the middle causes extra spaces to appear in the
formatted view, which cannot be remoced.
8. It crashed. I don't know why and I can't reproduce it:-( This is
what was printed on my terminal:
X11 Error : BadValue (integer parameter out of range for operation)
No alphabet file
line 5, char 8: unexpected end tag /style

Erreur VolReduit: dVol=2053 volume vue= 0
View is modified before creation
9. There is no Q element.
10. Suddenly the structure view didn't show the structure anymore, but
only the style sheet. Then even that was gone and an empty structure
view remained.
11. After I did a `create class', the view scrolled to the top of the
page and my cursor was lost.
12. Is it possible to add some more Emacs-like commands, such as
next-word, previous-word, swap-characters?
13. The default font of Amaya is rather small on my system. Can Amaya
be made to support the font-size keywords like `small' `medium' etc.,
together with a configuration option or dialog that sets the actual
size for `medium'?
14. When I move the mouse out of the window, keystrokes are lost.
15. Amaya doesn't do cut and paste using X selections. I can't copy
from an xterm, e.g.
16. I cannot change a paragraph into a PRE element.
17. The `End' key brings me to the end of the document. Why not to the
end of the line?
18. How do I enter characters like &amp;emdash; and &amp;endash;?
19. When I selected a PRE element and put a DIV around it, the status
line showed `Preformatted\Division\BODY\HTML' instead of
`Division\Preformatted\BODY\HTML'.
20. The list of classes in the `apply class' dialog is not
sorted.
21. The ESC key doesn't select inline elements. Maybe it is more
consistent if it does.
22. There is no way to select a stretch of text without the
mouse. Shift-cursorkey is the common method for that.
23. The latest CSS1 draft (no published yet) allows the style sheet to
be surrounded by !-- -- , to hide it from old browsers. Thus, the
type for STYLE will become
and a style sheet like
should be allowed. Currently, Amaya (correctly) ignores such a style
sheet.
24. Style rules for classes are saved without a leading dot:
example {...}
instead of
.example {...}

I don't agree
I changed this feature. The program reads the directory only after typed '/'.
It is ok now. The icon file was missing.
I never see that. Can you explain what we have to do to detect this problem.
Perhaps in the next version.
Ok, but not implemented in the current version.
Not corrected yet.
Because the directory dicopar was missing. Corrected.
I don't know this tag. What is it ?
I suppose that the error comes from a delete of something like Title or Body.
We added controls to prevent user to delete them.
Not corrected in the current version.
Ok, but not implemented in the current version.
To control Amaya font menu size add a line into .Xdefaults file :
amaya*FontMenuSize: 14
To control Amaya default document font size, use a CSS file :
$HOME/.amaya.css that includes the following line
BODY { magnification: 1}
Amaya does not grab the keyboard
Ok, but not corrected yet.
Now it is possible.
Yes, we will change it in next release.
We will add it in next release.
OK. It is a bug.
Yes you right.
????? It works ????
Reserved by Netscape for forward and backward
Daniel answer : won't be supported, too uggly !!!
daniel : ??? was thinking it was working, will be corrected ASAP !

Hi Bert,
First note that the mailing list has been changed to be the same
as on w3.org.
This has been part of the CSS specification draft some time ago. It has
been removed since but I think it's useful for user's preferences, so I
maintained it in Amaya.
See http://www.w3.org/{team, member}/WWW/Amaya/User/CSS.html for the
current status, what's in, what's not.
The full ISO-Latin-1 charset is supported except the division
and the multiply characters which are used for the rendering of
OElig and oelig wich are not part of the ISO.
See http://www.w3.org/{team, member}/WWW/Amaya/User/Keyboard.html for
complete table of key, name and keyboard mapping.
What should be the sorting order ? There is no predefined order,
except that HTML and BODY should go first, and an alphabetic one
doesn't seem good.
How would you compare ".pinky" (class) and "H1 EM" ?
Agreed, that's common use.
I just hope it won't become a standard just because of Netscape
old bad behaviour on unknown elements in HEAD
Yes I am quite surprised ... Will check an correct it !
Daniel
Hello Irene,
It only occurs when you try to change an attribute value (the bold
text in the structure view): put the mouse on a character in an
attribute value and type ^D, no other keys are accepted after that,
until you press the mouse button again. The cursor disappears as well.
There is no problem when deleting a character in the element's content.
It was in HTML 3.0 and it is also in HTML i18n. It inserts the
appropriate Q quotation marks /Q for the current language. Arena
supports it, but has a bug that allows a line to break between the
quote and the word; GNNpress supports it, but has a huge bug: it only
inserts the opening quote. Emacs-W3 supports it. Tango supports it
completely, including the language-dependent quotes.
Still, there is somethig wrong. It also appears to be possible to set
the focus to the main window, then type characters which will not
appear in the main window but only in the structure view, until the
next screen update.
When I put the mouse cursor over a button in the toolbar and press the
space bar, that button will be selected.
When I'm typing in the main view and accidentally move the mouse to
the title field, my characters will go into the title field instead of
into the main text.
It must have something to do with the resource keyboardFocusPolicy,
which is probably forced to `pointer' somehow, since adding it to the
resources with 'amaya*keyboardFocusPolicy:explicit' doesn't have
any effect. It also means that I can't use the tab to change the focus
from one button to the next.
Btw. Amaya doesn't support the -xrm command line option. Maybe it
doesn't call the X toolkit correctly?
Ah, it works for all elements except SPAN...
I agree, but it is a requirement by the HTML ERB, in order to give old
browsers some protection.
