We now have a new accessibility evaluation tool ready for testing. It's
based upon the successful tool HTMLTidy and displays a list of accessibility
problems found in an HTML file. It also does all the regular HTML Tidy
checks and if you're a user of HTML Tidy then you can replace your Tidy with
the new Tidy.
This is an early beta version and we're looking for feedback and users
willing to test the software.
You can download it from: http://snow.utoronto.ca/chris/AccTidy.html
This version has been compiled for Windows but we will make the source code
available so it may be compiled for other systems.
Please take a look and let me know your comments.
Thanks,
Chris
is there an online version of this tidy (or the original for that
matters)?
a simple form that asks for a url or upload
return the result of tidy stdout + a link to the new source (or put it
in a separate frame that can be saved from the browser).
No, there is not an online version of this tool.
It's designed to be run on your host system but could be modified to run on
a server.
Thanks for the suggestion.

Hi Chris,
have you added tis stuff to the sourceforge tidy project (it got moveed there
so Dave didn't have to keep managing it)? This would have a big impact on its
use I think.
Cheers

We haven't added it to the Sourceforge project yet but plan on doing so. We
plan on making the source code available under their public license. I
wanted to get some feedback on the usefulness of our program before merging
it with their code base.
All our accessibility code is in a separate file but there are a few small
changes that need to be made to the Tidy code. So there will be a small
impact in adding our code to theirs.

This is good and looks like a straightforward testbed for everyone's use. It
would be nice to have all the AERT evaluations published as some formal
manipulation of a page's DOM (as we had been talking about the other day on
the phone). This would give us a specific description of each algorithm
and, whatever the implementation (XSL, C++ or Java-based DOMs), such a
description could then be quickly moved from the AERT into evaluation tools.
