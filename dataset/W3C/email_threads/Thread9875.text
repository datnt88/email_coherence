Raised by Pierre-Antoine CHAMPIN in
Summary:
The Model and Syntax specification does not clearly specify which
reified statements are put in which bag when nested description
elements have bagID's.
I propose we close this by resolving:
Nested rdf:Description elements with rdf:bagIDs generate the same
triples as top-level rdf:Description elements with rdf:bagIDs.
Specifically, triples generated as a result of nested
rdf:Description elements do not get included in bags associated
with outer rdf:Description elements.
(sort of based on the resolution attached to Jeremy's mail
-- I hope I got this right
With respect to Pierre-Antoine's question
What model should the following RDF piece return ?
The first attachment test001.rdf contains an updated and completed
version of his example. (Iadded the rdf:RDF, updated the attributes
to be rdf:*, and made absolute URIs)
By this resolution it is equivalent to the attached test002.rdf, with
the inner rdf:Description moved to the outer level.
And both generate the same N-Triples
However, since IDs/bagIDs are being used, the URLs generated are
relative to the location of the RDF/XML files so there are two result
N-Triples files. The final test case files will be below
they are calculated relative to that

Absolutely. I agree.

Please can we have volunteers to review these test cases so we can close
this issue off at this weeks telecon.
