Do we still need 102 Processing? Can *any* method return 102? or only
some? If only some, then those that can return it should list it the list
of possible status codes. If all can, then there should be some language
that says that the list of status codes with each DAV method is not
exhaustive.
The explanation isn't sufficient to understand how 102 works. An example
would help. I mean, I can guess, and I might guess right, but I might
guess wrong, too.
If I do e.g., a MOVE, and get back 102 Processing, will I eventually get a
MultiStatus? Will I get a stream of 102s every 20 seconds or so, until I
get that 207?
Please refer to section 10.1 of RFC 2068 for a full explanation of what 1xx
series response codes are and how they work. It fully and completely answers
your question.

By my reading, Section 10.1 of RFC 2068 doesn't really address Jim's
questions in any substantive way. I think the DAV spec. would be improved
by noting that any method can return a 102, and that the server must
eventually return a non-1xx status code response which will typically, but
not necessarily be a 207 Multi-Status.

1) Not every method can return a 102 because it may not necessarily be
meaningful.
2) Anyone who does not understand that 1xx codes are intermediary codes does
not understand HTTP and thus is not qualified to read the DAV spec. DAV is
not a primer for HTTP. It assumes the reader is already conversant in all
relevant details of HTTP.
