HI all.
I didn't see any localization stuff for Unixes now.
But the only need insert setlocale(LC_ALL,"") and #include locale.h in corresponding place.

Hi Grigory,
Amaya uses its own localisation method.
All dialogues are stored in external files and a register variable allows you
to change the dialogue language. Today several european languages (English,
French, Italian, Spanish, and German) are supported.

Realy i mean that i can't input non-latin1 characters.
It's cause you use (less|mo)tiff. Motif widget block use system locale settings.
But at start you need to initialize current locale by setlocale(lC_{CATEGORY}, NULL);
if you want more information 'bout it just mail me.
