Hello!
We are working on this norwegian site: www.htmlhjelp.no
and we think that the world need a norwegian translation of
the HTML4 spesification (http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/).
We will start the work as soon as we get your answer.
Best regards,
Kim Betti(kim@htmlhjelp.no) and H x ard Lundberg (htmlhjelp@htmlhjelp.no)
Just to say Happy New Year to all W3C people and indeed a very PEACEFUL one

Yes, that would be great.
So long as you comply with the requirements listed in the W3C Intellectual
Property FAQ at
you may translate a W3C Technical Report.
Thanks,
