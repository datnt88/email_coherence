After reading Frank's Primer text, I have changed some text in the
reification section 3.2.1 of Semantics from this:
"Although RDF applications may use reification to refer to triple
tokens in RDF documents, the connection between the document and its
reification must be maintained by some means external to RDF. RDF
syntax provides no means to 'connect' an RDF triple to its
reification. "
to this:
"Although RDF applications may use reification to refer to triple
tokens in RDF documents, the connection between the document and its
reification must be maintained by some means external to the RDF
graph syntax. (The RDF/XML syntax described in RDF/XML Syntax
Specification (Revised) [RDF-SYNTAX] provides rdf:Id to attach a URI
reference to a triple in an RDF/XML document, and create the
corresponding reification.) "
I hope the WG does not object to this; I think the rather sharp
negative was misleading.

Argh! I hope the Primer isn't misleading on this question, because I
don't think your last sentence is accurate. What I try to say is that
rdf:ID provides a way of indicating that, in addition to generating the
usual triple, a reification of that triple with a specific URIref
(generated from the rdf:ID value) is to be generated as well. It
doesn't (I don't think) "attach a URI reference to a triple in an
RDF/XML document".

Well, isn't that attachment done by the fact of the URI appearing in
the rdf:ID in the document in question? But OK, I could rephrase it
thus:
(In the RDF/XML syntax described in RDF/XML Syntax Specification
(Revised) [RDF-SYNTAX] the use of rdf:Id with a URI reference as
value creates a reification of the enclosed triple, with that URI
reference as the reified triple.)
Would that be better? Its more awkward but maybe more accurate.

What I'm getting at is what I say later in the Primer reification section:
"Using rdf:ID as shown in Example 20 generates the reification
automatically, and provides a convenient way of indicating the URIref to
be used as the subject of the statements in the reification. Moreover,
it provides a partial "hook" relating the triples in the reification
with the piece of RDF/XML syntax that caused them to be created, since
the value triple12345 of the rdf:ID attribute is used to generate the
URIref of the subject of the reification triples. However, this
relationship is once again outside RDF, since there is nothing in the
resulting triples that explicitly says that the original triple had the
URIref exproducts:triple12345 (RDF does not assume there is any
relationship between a URIref and any RDF/XML that it might have been
used or abbreviated in)."
That is, if you look at the graph (Figure 17), there's nothing that
connects the triple described by the RDF/XML ("the enclosed triple") to
the URIref used in the reification triples (generated from the rdf:ID
attribute value). So there's sort of an "attachment" between the
generated graph and some RDF/XML, but the interpretation of that
attachment is still strictly outside of RDF. I just wouldn't want
anyone to interpret this parenthetical remark (whatever text it
contains) as an exception to or qualification of the original statement
that there isn't really a connection defined by RDF. This would be an
application-dependent convention that related (in a specific way) the
resulting graph to the RDF/XML used to generate it; and this
information wouldn't necessarily be available to a second party
receiving the graph.
NB: "rdf:Id with a URI reference as value" isn't strictly accurate
either. rdf:ID ("ID" in caps) doesn't take a URIref as a value; its
value is used (as a fragment id) to *construct* a URIref.

OK, how about this:
In the RDF/XML syntax described in RDF/XML Syntax Specification
(Revised) [RDF-SYNTAX] the use of rdf:ID creates a reification of the
enclosed triple in which the reified triple is a URI constructed from
the baseURI of the XML document and the value of rdf:ID as a fragID.

How about a slight modification:
In the RDF/XML syntax described in RDF/XML Syntax Specification
(Revised) [RDF-SYNTAX], the rdf:ID attribute can be used in the
description of a triple to create a reification of that triple in which
the reified triple is a URI constructed from the baseURI of the XML
document and the value of rdf:ID as a fragment.
