Hello,
To help us keep track of which open issues we are currently addressing, I
added a section at the top of the issues list called, "Issues we are
currently addressing." Currently, there are 3 issues in this list:
9. Author indications that a warning has been checked
30. Alternative pages
45. Detecting accessibility issues in scripts
These issues also appear in the full list of open issues.
Note that we closed issue #21 today, "header nesting." However, there is a
related issue that we are waiting on WCAG WG to address (issue #33 - only
one heading per page).
I was impressed last week with the organization and efficiency of the Voice
Browser Working Group. One mechanism that seemed to work well is
prioritizing open issues and tasks. For example, which 10 issues from our
issues list do we want to address before publishing our next working draft?
I propose at least the current 3. Perhaps they are enough?
When do we want to publish our next working draft? Our last public working
draft is from 26 April 2000. We were aiming to publish another one in
July, but we've obviously missed that. Do we feel we are ready to publish
the current draft as a public working draft? Could everyone give it a good
read to look for typos and obvious errors that we don't want to release
publicly?
thanks,

Our last public working draft is from 26 April 2000
header says "W3C Working Draft, 23 August, 2000" or is it somehow not
"public"? Since the Web site is public, then I thought the contents were
also. Oh, well!
I'll try to read it before I leave for Bristol, but the plate's a little
full. Although if UA is going to keep theirs secret for a while, I guess I
can squeeze in an hour or so.
Love.
ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE
I'd like to open as an issue the mapping of tools on our list to the
checkpoints they might be considered to address.

ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE
I think part of this issue is the one of being able to specify the particular
checkpoints that a tool addresses, which I think is already an open topic of
discussion. (the rest of it is extracting that into a particular document -
the checker page does that, and I am still working on doing it automagically)

Re mapping tools to checkpoints: Brian reminded me that Wendy started a list
like this, and Chris and Brian completed it for APrompt and Bobby
respectively. Anybody know what's become of it? Michael
