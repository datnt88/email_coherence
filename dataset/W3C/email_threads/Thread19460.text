Hello!
Is Thot capable to simultaneously use multiple presentations of a document
(in different windows), performing all necessary synchronizations between
them?
If so, why not to create SOURCE presentation for HTML structure? Is it a
question of possible ambiguity of presentations or a question of Thot's
limitations?
Best regards!
The problem is to manage the same information as a structure information and as
a simple text. This is a general problem for structured editors like Amaya.
Another problem is to be sure that the generated HTML code is correct. It's
possible
if Amaya controls the structure manipulation, but not if it is under the user
control.

Irene.

Amaya could even call another editor. Would it be a problem to share the same file?
Amaya could have a verification engine. That would check the user generated code.
What does Amaya do now with user generated code?
Once the file is out of Amaya the user can change it with another editor.

Of course, it's a problem to share a same file between two editors. it works
only
if one editor edits the file contents at the same time. It's also true if you
open the same file with two sessions of the same editor.
Amaya checks the code and try to fix eroors, but it doesn't success always.

The Amaya help files are not valid.
Also right.gif is not displayed by other browsers.
How did you make the icons used in Amaya?
