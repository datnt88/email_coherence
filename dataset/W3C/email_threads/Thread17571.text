Hi Amir,
Thank you for answering my question. I am looking at the 9 June
draft of the Micropayment Markup spec [1], in section 4.5, which
I believe to be the pertinent section. Some comments:
1) The current text begins:
"The price parameter, which takes a character string,
displays the amount and currency to the Customer."
I propose that this be changed to:
"The price parameter, which takes a character string,
specifies the amount and currency that the Customer
will be charged upon dereferencing the link."
(Question: How does caching work? Is this dealt with elsewhere?
I'm sorry if this is not a pertinent question.)
2) Perhaps there should be a reserved value for non-fee links.
For example, "0", with no currency specified. This would be
more international than "free", for example.
Please let me know if these comments make sense. Thank you
again,
- Ian

There's a dependency between User Agent (Accessibility
Guidelines) and Micropayments: users agents must be able
to indicate to users that following a link will require
them to pay a fee. The question is how to indicate
to user agents that a link is a fee link. For example,
Actually I believe we have addressed this perfectly well in the existing
markup proposal. Specifically, per-fee-links have been defined in a
_different_ way than regular (free) links. Indeed we even gave some
guidelines as to how the user agent (in our case we call this agent the
`per fee link handler`) is to indicate the fee. However of course for
accessibility reasons, special per-fee-link-handlers may implement special
ways of indicating fees (e.g. for blind users). In summary - I believe
you'll find our existing recommendation is fine
regarding this particular comment. Your feedback on this and other points
welcome!

Please consider that WAI-PF also holds a dependency, here. The issues that
we have raised with the X-Link working group about the model of link
activation overlap the considerations here.
Hopefully we can get X-Link to consolidate the behavior and information
model for links.
Some instant comments, however:
It is not clear why there should be a text field for the price when the
price is an amount in currency. Will XML Schema have a way for us to make
this a typed currency amount by the time that micropayments are entering on
service? If not, is the upgrade path to typed quantities clear?
Rather than defining a behavior on the assumption of GUI use and adding
special attributes for other uses, we would rather define the maximally
refined process that works for phone, blind, etc. users with full consumer
protection as the reference model and define quicker processes as shortcuts
against the full process. Or at least that this kind of tradeoff should be
considered.
