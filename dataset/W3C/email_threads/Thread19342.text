I downloaded the NT version of the source code and trying to build. Compiling
files which includes amaya.h complains that Editor.h is not found.
Did anybody have this experience and what am I missing?
Thanks

Hi,
Amaya is based on a generic tool. So, as explained in
to build compilers then compile generic files.
After that you can go into the Amaya work space and build the application.

I downloaded the NT version of the source code.
I tried to build compilers project/workspace using .dsp/.dsw. When compiling
compilers.rc it complained that resource.h is missing. Adding \amaya\amaya\amaya to
the resource include directory path successfully included resource.h but now I am
getting an error 'Undefined keyword : COMP_OPEN and COMP_COMPILE.
Is it because I am including the wrong resource.h file and I am missing the correct
version of it?
Also I am using MSVC++ 5.0 and not 6.0. Is this a problem?
Thanks,
siva
I had this problem originally and could only fix it by downloading the CVS
version.

You're right the file resource.h was missing in that tar file. Could you check
with the
new tar file http://www.w3.org/Amaya/Distribution/amaya-src-2.5.tgz
