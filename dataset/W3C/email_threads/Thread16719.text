I've just visited Bobby for the first time in - I forget how long.
What a ghastly mess!
The first thing that happened was a long wait for Netscape to display
the page[1]. This was repeated later whenever I used the back button
to return to URL:http://www.cast.org/bobby/ , indicating that the
page's labyrinthine construction is the main culprit.
When the page finally displayed, it showed most of the symptoms of a
poorly-written 1997 kool-deziner page. A look at the source confirms
a wealth of the worst legacy markup: tables-for-layout, liberal use of
FONT , spacer GIFs, etc (as well as several hundred blank lines at
the top: is this some stupid hide-source trick?).
Furthermore, not only is the HTML a mess, but the backend is broken.
Many of the options there, including the "Change Interface" link
and the "Site Tools" select box, generated internal server errors
whenever I tried them - for example:
Error Diagnostic Information
An error occurred while evaluating the expression:
"#session.LastPage#"
Error near line 34, column 20.
Error resolving parameter SESSION.LASTPAGE
I've put a screendump of what Netscape 4.7 displays at
Lynx is a little better, but still looks extremely silly.
Conclusion: what can I say? How can anyone take this seriously?
[1] This is a FreeBSD box, and doesn't have enough RAM to run Mozilla -
so I'm a mild case of requiring accessibility myself.

Worked great in IE - hmmm.... Looking at the source I noticed 2 things.
CFM and MM. Cold Fusion and the Macromedia Slice device. It looks like the
site has been rewritten using Allaire's Cold Fusion with DreamWeaver from
Macromedia as the editing/layout tool. DreamWeaver would fall into the
category described below, splices, slices and table positioning / layout.
Bummer for Bobby

It would appear that you were looking at a dynamically created page.
Specifically, a Cold Fusion created page. There are three very easy ways to
tell when you hit Cold Fusion pages:
1) The file name in the url (if present) will end in .cfm
2) The source code will (probably) contain a lot of blank lines which is
where the actual CF code is. Since it is processed on the server, it
outputs a blank line for every line of CF code. This can be turned off in
CF administrator.
3) Any error messages displaying anything in pound signs is CF code.
So, while I don't doubt the source code is bad, a bunch of blank lines is
not a stupid trick to hide source code as you have postulated.
As for the errors, it sounds like they need a little help with their CF
code.

Hi,
Will there be another W3C interest group Face to Face this year at CSUN in
Los Angeles in March?

[ posted back to original lists ]
Len has been kind enough to reprimand me privately for the tone
of my posting. I hereby apologise unconditionally for the
confrontational tone, and will avoid it in future in these lists.
I do, however, stand by the substance of my posting, which seems
to me an important issue. I should add that I raised it here
precisely because it seemed to me less damaging to do so in a
forum that is relatively small and broadly sympathetic than in
the Newsgroups, where it might serve to support those individuals
who are openly opposed to accessibility.
