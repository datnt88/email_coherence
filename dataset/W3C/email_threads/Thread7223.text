Dear WEBDAV Members,
our scenario document,
is an Internet Draft and will expire next month. Earlier it was discussed
that this document should at some point be submitted as an informational
RFC. Is there still interest to do this?
Although I am the editor of this document, I'm afraid I haven't followed
the WEBDAV discussion and development as closely as I would have wanted to,
so I cannot judge authoritatively whether the current ID should be
changed/updated/etc. Any comments?

Ora,
Thank you for brining this to our attention.
Our schedule, written in our Charter
http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ejw/authoring/charter.html , has the Scenarios
document being revised and submitted as an Informational RFC in April.
The scenarios document should be updated to increase their coverage of
requirements, and to reflect some of the more common usage situations
people are envisioning.

Yikes! This isn't right. The Charter has the Scenarios document being
submitted as an Internet Draft in April, and an Informational RFC in
August.
BTW, a fascinating read is the book "Human Error" by James Reason (yes,
that's his real name).
