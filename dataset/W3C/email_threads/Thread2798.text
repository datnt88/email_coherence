The Last-modified header response field is inconsistently referenced in
the HTTP 1.1 spec as both Last-Modified and Last-modified.
According to the definition in section 14.29 of
draft-ietf-http-v11-spec-rev-04 the Last-Modified entity-header field
is in the form: Last-Modified = "Last-Modified" ":" HTTP-date
Suggestion that all occurrences of "Last-modified" be changed to
"Last-Modified" to avoid confusion.
The following parts need changing:

includes both a Last-modified date and
[page 74]
13.3.1 Last-modified Dates
[page 77]
includes both a Last-modified date and one or more entity tags as cache
includes both a Last-modified date (e.g., in an If-Modified-Since or
If-Unmodified-Since header field)
[page 84]
For example,
HTTP/1.1 206 Partial content
Date: Wed, 15 Nov 1995 06:25:24 GMT
Last-modified: Wed, 15 Nov 1995 04:58:08 GMT
[Page 138]
For example:
HTTP/1.1 206 Partial Content
Date: Wed, 15 Nov 1995 06:25:24 GMT
Last-modified: Wed, 15 Nov 1995 04:58:08 GMT

All HTTP header field names are case insensitive, so those are equivalent
(see 4.2).

In theory, one might refer to the date itself as the "last-modified"
date, and the header as "Last-Modified", but I guess for simplicities
sake I'll bow to the hob-goblin of consistency and call them
all "Last-Modified" dates...

Happens automatically if the headings are changed.
Technically, this example is OK, since headers are not case
sensitive, but I'll fix it anyway...
