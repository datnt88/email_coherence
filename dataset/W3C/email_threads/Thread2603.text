Gentlemen:
As a web measurement analyst, one of my worst problems is dealing with
caching. Why do we use the code 200 for everything? Why not design the
spec in a graduated fashion:
If browser has url in its local cache, it still sends a get request to the
server, but an option says "I already have it, just letting you log the
request". The success code is a 209, "user has non-expired data in cache".
If a non local cache has the data, same system. The option can be
different, and we can even use a different code (210), but for the most
part, we should just let the 209 mean "cached request".
This solves many problems:
1) path analysis of a user's visit
2) advertising requests (not perfectly, given the IAB's recent standards,
but better than nothing for smaller sites)
3) pages per visit calculations are accurate
4) this is a minor increase in bandwidth compared to not sending the
request at all, and is far superior to eliminating caching.
Thanks for your time,
Michael

MW If browser has url in its local cache, it still sends a get request to the
MW server, but an option says "I already have it, just letting you log the
MW request". The success code is a 209, "user has non-expired data in cache".
MW If a non local cache has the data, same system. The option can be
MW different, and we can even use a different code (210), but for the most
MW part, we should just let the 209 mean "cached request".
How does this differ from the use of conditional requests and the
304 Not Modified response?

Have you reviewed RFC 2227 -- "Simple Hit-Metering and Usage-Limiting for
HTTP"? Seems like this RFC is trying to solve your problem.
