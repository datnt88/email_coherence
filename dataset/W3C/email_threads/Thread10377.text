I'm working on an agenda for tommorrow, will send it in an hour or so.
Topics to cover include
I18N/RDF
XMLLiteral proposal from jjc
Reification vocab proposal from pat
Implementation report (ericm)
Process - next step? CR/LC2/PR/etc
Anything else? Let me know...
This is running late; I'm in a telecon that is overrunning... Please
treat msg below as draft agenda. I propose we go for a 90 minute call
tommorrow and spend a fair chunk of time discussing the I18N situation.

Tomorrow is a public holiday here, so I send my regrets.
The next two weeks I'm on vacation, so again regrets
(but I will try to follow the mailing lists and I hope
that Pat can be my proxy).

Good point. Appended to agenda, unless you think it best to deal with
before I18N, XML Literal etc.
