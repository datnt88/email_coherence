FYI - I'm evaluating the feasibility of making the DOM (or more
specifically, Microsoft Dynamic HTML Object Model) a public interface.
As I said in the previous teleconference, current methods of accessing the
internal object model are unsupported.
I'm worried about this proposal since it would
(a) force browser manufactures to follow DOM
(b) force browser manufactures to expose DOM directly. Currently Internet
Explorer supports Active Accessibility, which provides some DOM-like
information, tailored to the needs or accessibility aids.
As soon I have more information, I'll pass it on.

Tables Issue Resolution for Desktop Graphical User Agents
The solution strategy for Desktop Graphical User Agents for making tables
more
accessible is for user agents to implement the Document Object Model (DOM)
and
provide an interface for assistive technology to access DOM. Assistive
technology therefore would have direct access to table information for
alternaive rendering in speech, Braille or enlarged text.
Advantages to DOM approach
1. Assistive technology has direct access to element information and is not
dependent on any filtering of information that occurs during graphical
rendering of information.
2. W3C recommendations exist for specifying implementation and conformance
Potential Disadvantage of DOM approach
1. Technique needs to gain acceptance by assistive technology developers.
So
far this has not been a problem since Henter-Joyce, Productivity Works and
Alva
participants are either already using DOM or are interested in its
capabilities.
Primary checkpoints for Desktop Graphical User Agents to implement
1. Implement DOM level 1
2. Expose DOM level 1 to assistive technologies
Checkpoint under consideration and refinement
1. Provide a means for the user to add accessibility functionality or change
the rendering of a document using the scripting capabilities of the user
agent
Issues related to this checkpoint
1. Intent is provide some way for user to adjust rendering or add
functionality
for legacy assistive technology by using scripting tools already available
in
many desktop graphical user agent technologies.
2. This is not a good checkpoint since it is too specific, but could be a
technique for a more general checkpoint.
3. This may be a good checkpoint if it was more general, but if it was more
general it could probably be defined as an asssitive technology. It
therefore
would not need to exist.
4. There is a DOM2 working group defining user side scripting capability,
need
to coordinate with that group and see how this issue relates to the work of
that group.
Checkpoints related to native table linearization by desktop graphical user
agents have been rejected based on the following information.
Potetential Advantage of Linearization Approach
1. Current screen reader users would have somewhat better access to table
information, but it is not a complete solution. Users would still need to
wait
for it to be implemented before they could benefit from the feature.
Problems with linearization approach
1. Linearization is only one of many techniques in solving the table access
problem, it doesn't meet the requirement for checkpoints stating a general
user
problem. It could be included as a technique in the technique document.
2. It doesn't provide a path for innovation in solving table access issues
and
will become outdated as technology improves.
3. Navigation and rendering are needed for a complete solution, which
complicates the desktop graphical browser issue.
4. None of the assistive technology vendors currently involved in the group
have requested the inclusion of this feature. Their interest seems to be
more
in the area of DOM or accessibility APIs for access to tables.
5. Mainstream browser developers have indicated that this feature is
technically difficult to implement. It would take a long time for user
agent
developers to implement and therefore maybe obsolete before users would be
able
to benefit from the technique.
If you have additional information that would change or extend this
resoution
please send it to the list as soon as possible for consideration by the
group.

Thanks for your comments chuck,
DOM is the W3C recommendation for providing plateform independent access to
document element information. For the guidelines not to include this as
the primary mechanism for assistive technology to access document element
information there would need to be strong arguements on how other
techniques which are also cross plateform could acheive the same results
more efficently or with better representations of the information.
Remember these guidelines must be approved by the W3C member companies and
checkpoints that are not plateform independent or refer to proprietary
technologies when other W3C exist may have difficulty getting their approal.

Is it necessary for WAI to put requirements on what browsers do internally?
The checkpoints are summarized as:
It would seem that point 2. is sufficient: expose an interface or
interfaces (we probably want both the scripting and interprogram
interfaces) through which AT can inspect and edit the document, in
accordance with the W3C Recommendation(s) for the DOM. I am not sure what
a requirement to "implement the DOM" would mean other than in the context
of such an interface. In its own terms, the DOM is a pattern of features
to be present in an interface.
