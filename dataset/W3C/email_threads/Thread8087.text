Julian--
Should we discuss the property metadata draft:
est.html
at the Atlanta IETF? I'm happy to drive discussion on the topic.
--Eric
I will put together the Agenda for the Atlanta meeting. Here's some
issues that should be discussed. Volunteers are *really needed* ( to
drive discussion on their selected topic) this meeting as I'm *really
swamped* myself!
RFC2518bis
- Proposals for client forcing server auth challenge - Ilya?
- Required support for ETags
- If header evaluation/simplification proposals &amp; compatibility -
Geoff?
Other drafts
- quota draft
- Binding issues coming up on DL
- allprop/include draft
Other issues
- Impact of XML namespace changes -- Julian?
- ACL submission status
I'm sure I've missed items so let me know.

Please start sending your group meetings' agendas.
Thanks,
Dinara Suleymanova
Eric,
that would be great. Let me know if I can/should assist in preparing slides.
Note that [1] and [2] are currently (almost) identical, and that [2] is the
version that has been submitted as Internet Draft.

I will be at the Atlanta meeting, and would be happy to drive the
discussion on any of the topics identified below. I don't think
I would raise the XML namespace issues, though, until we have some
proposal as to how to address them (I agree they are issues, but
like Julian, I have no proposal for how to address them).
Cheers,
Geoff
Yes -- I need help not only in preparing these discussions, but also
leading them at the WG meeting. I understand you won't be able to make
it to Atlanta, Julian. Is somebody who will be there able to work with
Julian on understanding and explaining the XML namespace issues and the
allprop Include draft?

Lisa,
if you need help/assistance in preparing
- allprop/include draft
- Impact of XML namespace changes -- Julian?
(which should be XML 1.1/ XML namespaces 1.1 changes, right?), please
let
Would you be so kind to handle the allprop/include proposal?
I think there's some misunderstanding here.
The namespace issue as defined in Jason's list ([1]),
DAV_WITH_COLON_IS_NOT_A_URI, is closed (we don't need to change anything).
The XML 1.1 and XML namespaces 1.1 *potential* issues should be at least
considered ([2]).

My point was that I have no particular opinion on
which way to go for the XML 1.1 and XML namespace issues
that you raised (and in your email that raised
the issues, you indicated that you didn't have a
proposed resolution either). So although I'd be
happy to participate in a discussion on this topic,
I wouldn't be able to "drive" it in any particular
direction.
Cheers,
Geoff

I see.
At this point, we should just note that there are potential issues. After
all, both specs (XML 1.1 and namespaces 1.1) aren't finished yet.
Driving discussion doesn?t necessarily mean having a resolution in mind.
Could you outline the possible ways to address the new XML standards
work so that the rest of us could have a framework to start thinking
about it? Just an overview of what?s different (that might affect
WebDAV) would be helpful.

That information (what is in the new XML standards that is relevant
briefly present that information at the working group meeting.
