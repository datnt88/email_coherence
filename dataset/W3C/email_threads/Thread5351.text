CALL FOR PAPERS
Workshop on Application of Semantic Web Technologies to Web Communities
A Knowledge Web workshop (http://knowledgeweb.semanticweb.org/)
Workshop at ECAI 2004 (http://www.dsic.upv.es/ecai2004/)
16th European Conference on Artificial Intelligence
August 22-27, 2004, Valencia, Spain
WORKSHOP DESCRIPTION
Various communities have taken advantage of the current Web
functionalities to strengthen the communication and information exchange
not only within the community, but also with external communities or
individual users. Miscellaneous web portals have appeared with the
purpose of providing an open and effective communication forum for their
members.
Nevertheless, current Web technology presents serious limitations to
make information efficiently accessible for users. Moreover, users face
the task of reading the documents retrieved in order to extract the
information desired. These limitations naturally appear in existing Web
communities based on this technology, making information searching,
accessing, extracting, interpreting and processing a difficult and
time-consuming task.
In this context, Semantic Web technologies can considerably improve the
information sharing process, overcoming the problems found in current
Web communities to search, access, extract, interpret and process
information. In this sense, Web communities based on Semantic Web
technologies represent a natural evolution of existing Web communities.
The workshop will provide a forum for workers in the fields of knowledge
engineering, knowledge management, knowledge representation, language
technology, ontological engineering, data, text and web mining and
Semantic Web, to present their latest results and to discuss the
potential joint application of these fields to Web communities, both
analysing what has been achieved so far and what are the next steps to
accomplish. The aim is to provide a snapshot of the state of the art and
guidelines for further steps.
