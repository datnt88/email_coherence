I've put up the XML Validator at
This is based on the existing experimental service at valet, but
has been updated to use Xerces 2.1 and I've made some other
long-overdue improvements. It's definitely alpha-quality,
and liable to fall about in a heap just now.
Questions:
* Are people happy with the general format of this service?
* If so, shall I put the code into qa-dev cvs at this point?
* If not, what should be changed?
* Has anyone put any XML catalogue stuff onto qa-dev?
It'll run a lot faster and more efficiently if it can
resolve entities locally!

This has now been updated:
- fixed bug in mod_xml's Xalan-1.4 bindings that was causing
larger reports in HTML and EARL formats to break down.
- Added web browser based validator.
If noone on qa-dev is interested in this, I'd now be comfortable
announcing it to a wider audience on www-validator. Is there
an official policy concerning where I can/can't announce
something like this?

very interesting and nice interface
Be careful to the auto validation things. Just to avoid trolls.
I don't see any problems, it's nice to have this output. It would be
good to have a detailed explanation of what we get in return, type of
messages, type of errors, DTDs if any etc.
A manual :p
The output seems to come back on one line (maybe it's my terminal which sucks)
if it's the case, maybe a formatted output would be better.
For example
rdf:RDF
xmlns:r="modxml:validator#0.1"
xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#"
xmlns:val="http://valet.webthing.com/xmlns/validator.rdf#"
xmlns:earl="http://www.w3.org/2001/03/earl/1.0-test#"
earl:testMode rdf:resource ....
.... etc
if you put Earl as the defaut namespace it will make the syntax a bit
more readable :)
xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2001/03/earl/1.0-test#"
Great.
If I have forgotten things I will come back.

Thankyou :-)
Ah, the xmlns: attributes. I've updated the stylesheet to
suppress that.
Ah yes, the drudgery bit of it. Keep badgering me, and things may
happen - eventually. Recruit more bodies to it and things might
happen faster:-)
Hmmm, I never thought the EARL version was supposed to be human-
readable. Too tired tonight to figure out whether there's a
Right Way to do that; I'd rather not use a hack.
Done.
I'll look forward to it:-)

Is the EARL produced by an XSLT?
Karl Dubost / W3C - Conformance Manager
--- Be Strict To Be Cool! ---
Yes, both the HTML and EARL are produced by XSLT.
The XSLT files I'm using are in /home/nick/httpd/modxml. I guess
they'd better go under CVS once I get a round tuit.
BTW, mod_xml precompiles and caches the stylesheets, so Apache has
to be restarted when you update them.
