Issue rdfs-transitive-subSubProperty:
Is a super/sub-property of a transitive property necessarily transitive?
e.g. anc is a transitive property
par is a sub-property of anc but is not transitive
anc-or-unc is a super-property of anc but is not transitive
Might be good to explain that 'anc' means 'ancestor' and 'par'
means 'parent' and 'unc' means whatever it does mean (uncle??).
Otherwise, the point of the example is rather opaque.
You are right (perfect guess!), it's better to have those names.
I've updated the files, but currently I have some trouble to put them at
(and I asked Dominique Hazael-Massieux dom@w3.org for help)
Have a nice weekend!

I sorta expected to see an entailment test, not just
an example arrangement of properties.
But as an example/explanation, it looks fine.
I'm happy to see it approved.
I'd like to see an entailment test (to show
that the transitive closure of parent is *not* entialed)
added at some point, but it's not critical.

that's actually a very good idea
will do that

Hi Dan,
indeed, very good idea
let's start with
and then try to entail
http://example.org/foo#od .
and that is indeed succesful
(we just had to make a bug correction in
(and we can't ftp put to www.agfa.com))
next, your proposal, trying to entail
http://example.org/foo#jd http://example.org/foo#parent http://example.org/foo#od .
which is indeed *not* possible
(at least we get a "No proof found")
next, trying to entail
http://example.org/foo#jd http://example.org/foo#ancestor-or-uncle http://example.org/foo#od .
which is succesful (thanks to the MT)
i.e.
{:RDFS-RULE-6 rdfs:isDefinedBy mt:rdfsentail.
http://example.org/foo#ancestor rdfs:subPropertyOf http://example.org/foo#ancestor-or-uncle .
{ http://example.org/foo#ancestor a ont:TransitiveProperty.
http://example.org/foo#jd http://example.org/foo#ancestor http://example.org/foo#fd .
http://example.org/foo#fd http://example.org/foo#ancestor http://example.org/foo#od } log:implies
{ http://example.org/foo#jd http://example.org/foo#ancestor http://example.org/foo#od }} log:implies
{ http://example.org/foo#jd http://example.org/foo#ancestor-or-uncle http://example.org/foo#od }.
and last, trying to entail
http://example.org/foo#jd http://example.org/foo#ancestor-or-uncle http://example.org/foo#ad .
which was *not* possible
and that brings us to
...ancestor-or-uncle is a super-property of ancestor but is not transitive
