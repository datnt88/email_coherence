If we are going to use bnodes, I would rather write this as:
_x rdf:type ComplexNumber
_x realPart _:y1
_x imaginaryPart _:y2
_:y1 xsd:number "1.0"
_:y2 xsd:number "2.0"
I'd prefer this representation too, not doubt.
But aren't you confusing data type with property here?
Shouldn't it rather be:
_x rdf:type ComplexNumber
_x realPart _:y1
_x imaginaryPart _:y2
_:y1 rdf:value "1.0"
_:y1 rdf:type xsd:number
_:y2 rdf:value "2.0"
_:y2 rdf:type xsd:number
or better yet
_x rdf:type ComplexNumber
_x realPart _:y1
_x imaginaryPart _:y2
_:y1 rdf:value "1.0"
_:y1 rdf:type xsd:float
_:y2 rdf:value "2.0"
_:y2 rdf:type xsd:float

No, I'm not. It has been pointed out many times on this list that use of
rdf:value often leads to big trouble when some resources suddenly turn
out to denote the same thing. (Brian gave an example of such clash some
time ago.) Therefore, I avoid rdf:value completely until we dashed out
the basics of datatyping.

Sorry, there are two different proposals on the table for using
bNodes. DanC's version would be like yours below, Sergey's like the
above. I was talking to Sergey in Sergeyish.
