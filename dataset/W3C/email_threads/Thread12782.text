Hi all,
A few people, including myself, have been working on the Japanese
version of the QuickTips card. And now, someone at W3C/Keio is working on
its artwork. As we prepare the material, I came to wonder if it would
be any good to have some Braille on the cards, e.g., ``WAI QuickTips''
on one side, and the URI on the other.
I think putting some Braille on the QuickTips card is good for
following reasons:
1. It draws sighted people's attention, and (hopefully) they will look
at the card a little more carefully.
2. It helps blind folks to identify what it is.
The No. 2. may look meaningless, but being blind myself, it looks as
important as the other. The reason for this is that we often give
away the cards to various people for demonstration purpose, and
sometimes blind people take them hoping they can show the cards to
their sighted colleagues. But after coming back from some
conferences, etc., the QiuckTips card may get buried in a stack of
other business cards and is very difficult to be located without
sighted help, unless they are well-organized. At least, that has
happened to me. (Yes, I can't deny that my desktop is pretty messy.)
Anyway, I'd like to hear what people think about putting some Braille
on the cards, and if many people think it's helpful, what should the
Braille on the card say?
Cheers,
Max
I agree with Max that it would be very goo. A title and a URI would perhaps
be best - I think being identifiable is the most useful thing, since we are
unlikely to fit the quicktips onto a card in braille.

Max, I have slept for a few days on your suggestion....
Recently the WAI has been moving towards a user centred rather than
hardware/software centred model.
Could quicktips cards possibly reflect these twin approaches, by having one
side devoted to each?
Thus examples that benefit individuals could be demonstrated rather than
described (QED) on one side.
suggestions include:
Braille "Quick Tips"
Large Type "W3C" (part of a longer word cut off might be more
effective)
Graphic "Wheelchair" (Toilets/Microsoft)
One side would benefit from white space, but with careful design might be
able to include examples of up to 2 others such as:
label link and or alt
table Web Accessibility Initiative
The present (cluttered) look whilst informative, has limited appeal,
probably to webmasters, programmers and rule enthusiasts.
In today's fast moving world, it is vital that we grab people's attention as
well as attempt to inform them.

aloha, max!
you aren't the only one with a disorganized desktop and a pocket full of
indistinguishable business cards -- braille on the QuickTips cards is an
excellent idea, for both of the reasons you cited...
as for what to braille, i like "WAI QuickTips" on one side and the URI on the
other... i don't think we could fit the URI for the QTs on the card, so it
would probably just need to be a pointer to the WAI web space... which makes
me wonder, could we save valuable real estate by leaving off the http colon
slash slash, or would that confuse people?

Hi all,
Sorry for being unable to followup on this issue for some time.
I have received favorable comment and no opposing opinions so far.
The issue I'd like to get input from everyone is what and how to
braille on the card.
At Sat, 23 Oct 1999 00:28:52 -0400,
I think this is the way to go.
If we use notation used in North America, we can probably put
``http://www.w3.org'' (without trailing slash, maybe), but it's not
really possible if we use Japanese notation. If we drop the preceding
``http://'', we can probably put ``www.w3.org/WAI/'' in both cases.
I'm not too sure how this would work with the European notation, but
probably not much different from the North American.
Another thing is if we want to put braille on both sides. What I have
found out is that it costs a lot more to have braille on both sides if
we want to do it with clear glue like printing scheme. The interpoint
isn't too expensive, but that probably isn't good idea as it makes the
printed stuff harder to read. So, if we want to put just the ``WAI
QuickTips'' and the URI, it may be better to put them all on one side.
So, my proposal is to have
WAI QuickTips
www.w3.org/WAI/
on the front side of the card. We might need to break the ``WAI
QuickTips'' into two lines if we are to capitalize the words
appropriately.
Thoughts?
Cheers,
Max
Hi Max
I don't think we need to say WAI twice (in the URI and in the title).
I don't like URIs without http:// but I can live with them.
Sounds better to have something than to argue what it is.

aloha, max!
i know that i'm a bit of an iconoclast, so i'm going to throw out another non
(although i'm sure there are some who would say "sub") standard idea about the
braille on the QuickTips cards...
first of all, i agree -- we do not, in any way, want the braille to detract
from the legibility of the card itself, so braille on one side it is...
second, i think we can safely discard the http colon slash slash prefix and
just cite the URI as
www.w3.org/wai
(without the trailing slash, which may cause more confusion for the average
recipient of the card than the lack of the http colon slash slash prefix)
third, i'd advocate discarding capitalization marks altogether -- we are
working with such a limited space that it would be foolish of us to waste
precious real estate on punctuation, so i'm suggesting that the words quote WAI
QuickTips unquote be embossed without any capitalization marks, which will
enable us to keep the words wai quicktips on one line... the URI should also
be embossed in lowercase, as the URI resolves regardless of case, and -- with
the 2 periods and the slash -- the URI already consists of 14 characters,
providing we drop the dots 1,4 character to symbolize the number three, rather
than using a number sign... i don't know enough about internationalization to
know whether or not the number sign used in the united states is the same as
that used elsewhere, but i'd imagine that use of a number sign, like so many
other conventions, isn't widely standardized, if at all... moreover, i'm not
sure that we can fit 14 characters on a QuickTips card, let alone 15 -- hold
on, let me grab one from my near-depleted stack and stick it in the old perkins
brailler... bad news -- i could only fit 13 characters onto the QuickTips card
(although it took me a couple of tries and a slate and stylus to do so -- the
best i could do with the perkins was 12 characters)
the good news is that, uncapitalized, the phrase wai quicktips is 13 characters
long...
in any event, if we make it clear to anyone who orders or receives the brailled
QuickTips card that computer braille was used to symbolize the number three in
the URI, and put an explanatory note to that effect on the QuickTips page, we
might be able to get away with simply dropping the dots 1,4 character, although
i do realize that the use of a dropped c (which, for you non-braille readers,
is what the dots 1,4 character symbolizes, at least in english) could
potentially cause confusion, especially as most people expect the W3C's URI to
contain the letter c
my sole concern, like yours, max, is that we convey enough information to a
braille reader so that he or she (a) can identify the card, and (b) he or she
can learn the URI for the WAI web space, so that he or she can find out more
about the WAI and the resources and references that it maintains, without
compromising the legibility of the card for the sighted....
to that end, i do think it is important to cite the URI for the WAI's web
space, and not just W3C space, although space considerations may force us to
cite the shorter URI, as i don't believe it would be a good idea to have the
URI span 2 lines

Allow me to emerge, for just a minute, from my insane schedule (and my
consequent inability to participate much in EO activities as of late) to
suggest this:
First, yes, yes, yes to Braille on the Quick Tip card.
Second, there is a simple way to squeeze the URL in Braille on the card:
State the URL as:
w3c.org/wai
Of course, this is not the "accepted" way to express a URL, especially
amongst the more computer-savvy amongst us. But this format works on every
browser I have ever tried, including Lynx.
Now, let me gaze into my crystal ball... I predict that in the near future
this format WILL emerge as the "normal" way to express a URL. The tide
will turn as more and more people discover that the abbreviated format
usually works. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, for example, now
promotes its web site as cbc.ca. Personally, I rarely type "www" when
entering a web address, and I have not typed "http://" in months.
Alan
dropping the http:// is something that is reasonable if you posit the
withering and disappearance of other formats. Currently mailto: is the only
one I would put money on remaining common, although the possibility of making
use of newer formats becomes more difficult. That may not be a big problem.
Dropping www relies on people using www as the first thing in the name of
their webservers. At most universities and other large distributed sites
there are large parts of the content served by machines called
somethingelse.somewhere.com - this is true of large companies as well, and
indeed of W3C.
URIs only work if they uniquely point to one resource. removing part of the
URI means that you are removing part of the ability to create new, similar
URIs who do not share that part. (Hence the reason that people in the rest of
the world resent the US for apprpriating the top level of the .com, .org,
.net, .edu and other domains through the laziness of not adding .us very
often.)
In addition, it is W3C policy that www.w3.org is part of any address that is
served from www.w3.org which means it would take a change in our own policy
(one which I would oppose) before we published something without the www.

the veracity of the last statement depends upon how one has Lynx configured --
one can edit one's lynx.cfg file so as to activate Lynx's URL domain prefix and
suffix settings... in plain english, that means that the user can define the
order in which Lynx will attempt to apply a schema (such as http://, ftp://,
gopher://, wais://, etc.) to a minimal URI -- such as quote w3 unquote...
likewise, one can configure Lynx, again using the lynx.cfg file, to define a
string of domain suffixes to sequentially append to a minimal URI to attempt
resolution...
so, for example, if you had Lynx set so as to attempt to append an h t t p
colon slash slash to every URI you type, and defined the URI suffix order as:
.com,.edu,.net,.org
(which are the default values for this setting in Lynx when it is uncommented
in the lynx.cfg file), typing
w3
would cause Lynx to try the following URIs in the following order:
. http://www.w3.net/
one last note: all of the following applies to versions of Lynx 2.6 and greater
(the functionality was added earlier, but it wasn't fully debugged and
operational until 2 july 1996), and -- unfortunately -- a lot of shell account
users who use Lynx to access the web, are saddled with a version of Lynx much
older than 2.6
gregory
PS: as for whether the triple double-yews should be dropped or not, i vote nay
-- not only for the policy reasons cited by Charles, but precisely because
there is no reasonable expectation that any URI will start three double-yews
(forgive the phonetic spelling, but it's unsettling when my synthesizer says
quote double us unquote!

IT is important to meet the needs of the blind.
Is it appropriate to discuss the issue of braille alone.
The issues raised, run to the heart of accessibility at WAI.
"The attempt to be accessible to all."
www.w3c/wai in braille and, out of context has very little meaning.
It is very unlikely in itself to lead to hits, unlike say "freesex.com" (no relation).
This needs more thought.
The QT cards must represent an attempt to express the problems as understood at this time.
The design needs to be considered in its totality.
This example is intended to promote discussion rather than be a result.
To enable those with poor vision to better understand the design above the following is a longdesc:
an Alt tag "QuickTips" partially covers the characters W3C in a very large font say 72.
The W of W3C supports a wheelchair in front of a short phrase in braille.
An arrow in the bottom right corner encourages one to interact and turn the card over.
As far as the Quick tips cards go they, by their nature are a token.
The very words Web Accessibility Initiative are excessively ponderous, and incomprhensible to someone with even mild cognitive difficulties. Access all areas is a little better understood.

aloha, jonathan!
as a blind individual, i would find even the most basic of information, such as
wai quicktips
www.w3.org/wai
to be EXTREMELY useful... without braille on the card, i am left holding a
card for which i (a) have no use, (b) cannot independently identify, and (c)
cannot give to another blind individual for his or her use...
braille on the quicktips card isn't just window-dressing, nor is it the be-all
and end-all to making the QuickTips cards more useful -- it is, however, a
giant step forward in that area, and one which sends a definite message to
anyone and everyone who receives a brailled QuickTips card -- the clear and
simple message that there are other modalities that need to be considered when
constructing content for the web...

Jonathan, somehow your message got scrambled when I tried to read it. In case
it happened to others I am describing your layout.
The layout is as follows:
Top left, size of a wide braille character is a wheelchair icon (commonly
understood to refer to access for people with disabilities). Then there is
"quick tips" written in braille across the rest of the top of the card. The
rest of the card is the W3C logo (Those letters, with funky design - W3 in
blue, and the C as just a shadow of a raised letter) and the words "Quick
Tips" in white on a grey rectangle overlaid. The contrast works pretty well,
but I am not sure if we can cover the logo with anything. As Jonathan said,
there is an arrow on the lower right hand side inviting one to turn over the
card.
Anyway, I would put the Quick Tips wording under the Braille. This would work
if we cut the quick tips to one side of a card, which I think is possible. I
would still like to have the URI in braille, and it might be easier to put
that on top of the W3C logo.
Another possibilty is to have a folded card - many of the brailled cards I
have seen do this. That would give us heaps of "real estate"...
Charles McCN
However You are already aware of the aims of WAI and the braille
www.w3.org/wai
on the Quicktips card adds nothing to your knowledge.
My point was that if one was not aware of the aims another 13 character
message, could say enough to let you ask someone for further information,
not ideal, I realize.
In my experience very few links tell one where one is going. www.w3.org/wai
says nothing without a context.
www.alt.web.org says a little more www.sex.org is more or less in clear as
is blind.org.
"equal access" is not quite good enough.
"quick tips" is english, easy to remember and memorable, the one i used
incidentally.
Between us we should be able to find a phrase that is meaningful and brief,
the web address I feel is secondary, if only just.
Braille is certainly a great benefit for everyone concerned at WAI and their
contacts.
I am not disputing that point.

A folded card sounds great.
I will create another mock up, or a few, but let's have a few more ideas.
I had thought of a word say "access" in 72 point so only part of the a and
cce were visible instead of W3C, it seems more relevant.
To give some idea of what people who need to read large print go through.
The RNIB produce lots of materials like this.
The Alt tag is fundamental to accessibility on the www and could usefully be
used on the card to visually describe WAI's intentions.

on the contrary -- it tells me that i'm about to hand the QuickTips card to
someone and not a business card from the Chinese-Italian restaurant down the
street... a big difference as regards accessibility, although i suppose that
handing off the restaurant's card could be conceived as a contribution to
internationalization!
ok, i made that last point tongue-in-cheek, but the point is, both the
distributor of the card and the recipient of the card benefit from the braille,
no matter how minimal...
as for your observation:

i must ask, have you ever considered using speech synthesis as an adjunct to
your mode of traversing the web? i know a lot of people with little or no
visual impairment, whose access to information and productivity have
dramatically increased as a result of their using speech output to supplement
the visual aspects of working on a computer...
the reason i ask is because of the way that my screen-reader, Jaws For Windows,
handles the TITLE attribute when it is defined for the A element...
case in point -- my personal web site, Camera Obscura
(http://www.hicom.net/~oedipus/)
when you first arrive at Camera Obscura, you hear the following:
Welcome to Camera Obscura, the womb without a view...
the words "womb without a view" are a hyperlink that leads to a meta-index of
Blindness-Related Resources on the Web and Beyond, and since i realize that
this is not self-evident from the hyperlink text, i have defined a TITLE for
the hyperlink that explicitly states: "Blindness-Related Resources on the Web
and Beyond"... when tabbed-to using JFW and MSIE, the link TITLE is spoken,
rather than the hyperlink text, just as, when one uses a pointing device to
point to the hyperlink, the ToolTip "Blindness-Related Resources on the Web and
Beyond" is displayed...
another illustration can be found in the encoding of the auto-validation
buttons at the bottom of all of my pages... because i still do ninety-nine
percent of my encoding by hand, and often in the middle of the night, i find
the auto-validation buttons an effective and easy way to catch any mistakes i
may have made in my HTML or CSS... now, the ALT text for the "Valid HTML"
button reads: "W3C Validated HTML4!", but the TITLE for the hyperlink reads:
"Validate this page's HTML, courtesy of the W3C HTML Validator"... thus, when
image loading is turned off, the hyperlink text appears as "W3C Validated
HTML!", but the TITLE, which is exposed visually as a ToolTip on MouseOver, and
spoken by JFW when the button is tabbed-to, reads "Validate this page's HTML,
courtesy of the W3C HTML Validator"
my point is that it is easy to add context to a link, which is why i have begun
to remove every instance of a hyperlinked URI from my pages.... why? i find
it more intuitive to use the phrase quote comments, corrections, and
suggestions unquote or quote email the maintainer of this page unquote as the
hyperlink text for a mailto link than to use my actual email address as the
hyperlink text... the same goes for URIs -- it is, i believe, more logical to
use the phrase quote hypertext archive of past posts to the EO mailing list
unquote as the hyperlink text in a link that points to this list's mail
archive, than it would be to use the actual URI of the mail archive as the
hyperlink text...

What is at stake here ? in my view what matters is being able to identify
the QT card against the many other cards one holds.
So the way you call it is not that important : the blind holder knows he
has the QT card, and any brailled name - WAI, Quick, Tip, QT - will help
to identify it against the other cards.
Mokrane Boussaid
aloha, mokrane!
the one missing element in your summation of the issue is that -- if the QT
card has the URI for WAI web space embossed upon it, then it can also be used
_BY_ a blind person, not just as a means of identification, but as a pointer to
WAI web space...
it's not merely a question of identity (although that does enter into it), but
of making information available to the widest possible audience, and if we can
incorporate braille (as max suggested), symbolic content (as johathan has
suggested), and large print (possible if we adapt charles' proposal that we use
a folding card, such as those commonly used by agencies for the blind here in
the states), then the cards are more useful to more people...

I agree with Gregory.
It is most important to be able to identify the card. But since most of the
information on it is repeated on the WAI website, (among other things it says
"look at the WAI website for full detail" or something like that) if we can
also put the URI on it the card will be substantially more useful to someone
who does not already know how to find us.
