Right, that is what my UAW example was showing. I'm simply pointing out
that a date is not terribly useful for disambiguation (well, actually I
don't know exactly what the date is useful for).
Maybe it's reasonable -- and maybe not -- to treat two tdbs which
differ
by a small date range to be 'the same'.
I can accept this.
Can I post your comments &amp; my reply on the 'uri@w3.org' list?
Done :-)
Thanks,

I think that the problem of persistence of identity is really
difficult --
it's one of those problems like "is the morning star the same as the
evening star", because, after all, they appear at different times. And
with 'tdb', there are two kinds of ways in which meaning can vary over
time: (a) the web resource itself could change (the corresponding
urn:duri
might yield a different document), and (b) the understanding of what's
being described might change.

I don't think you can assume there are unique identifiers for people
(or
anything else), unless you choose a narrower domain of identification
that
tries to assure that each 'thing' only gets one identity, e.g.,
identify
you by your SSN or some other country's national identity number.
In the end, a meta-indexer has to use heuristics to decide whether two
identified resources are the 'same' for the purpose of the indexer's
index.
Maybe it's reasonable -- and maybe not -- to treat two tdbs which
differ
by a small date range to be 'the same'.
I think this is completely orthogonal to the issue of media
representation,
which includes a wide range of variability, not just MIME type.
I don't think 'tdb' or 'duri' are useful in situations where there is
a
'client' and 'servers' and you're trying to do content negotiation. It
doesn't really help with that.

Yeah, I read this last night when Aaron posted about it on

is, one would expect that the thing being described would still be the
same thing after a period of time. That is, the two URIs:
urn:tdb:2001:http://www.netcrucible.com/people/joshuaa
urn:tdb:2002:http://www.netcrucible.com/people/joshuaa
are different URIs, but most likely identify the same "thing".
The fact that the URIs are different would complicate (but not
prevent)
attempts to index assertions about a particular "thing".
An example of where the date would be useful would be something
like:
urn:tdb:1996:http://www.uaw.org/officers/president
urn:tdb:2002:http://www.uaw.org/officers/president
Which do describe different things. But even then, a metadata
indexer is left with two choices -- you either index all data for each
distinct date as if they describe different "things", or index them as
if
they all describe the same thing. Either option is unlikely to give
accurate metadata aggregation. In other words, the date is relatively
useless to disambiguate the tdb, so other techniques would have to be
used.
So, I believe that the tdb scheme would be useful to divert
people
who insist on saying that an HTTP URI represents more than just a
document.
For that alone, it would be nice. There would of course still be the
"One
HTTP URL can represent many different resources by use of a mime-type"
arguments, so those would need to be put to rest somehow. And beyond
that,
I am still trying to think of places where I would want to use the
duri
(non-tdb). At first glance, it seems appealing; a sort of
metadata-safe
way to do HTTP etags. But etags are most useful when maintained by
the
server, and not by the client -- I think the same would be true of the
datepart in tdb and duri -- but in the case of tdb and duri, if a
server
is going to go through the trouble of updating the datepart of the URN
every time that a resource change (or change of president at the UAW)
requires, then the server might as well just assign a new URN. So I
am
still trying to get the use cases.

Hi,
I glanced through this and an uncomfortable thought occurred to me. I
think it's fairly clear that given two duri's that differ only in their
date element, they may or may not denote the same thing depending upon
other factors. Thus, given Joshua's employment record, one might be able
to infer that
urn:tdb:2001:http://www.netcrucible.com/people/joshuaa
urn:tdb:2002:http://www.netcrucible.com/people/joshuaa
do or do not denote the same person.
But, and this is where I get uncomfortable, to perform such inference one
needs to look _inside_ the URI syntax, which seems to fly in the face of
universality/uniformity of URIs used in this way. In RDF/N3-speak,
something more like this would seem to be more appropriate:
[a :Person] :describedBy [a :Description ;
:dateAvailable "2001" ;
:homePage
http://www.netcrucible.com/people/joshuaa ] .
Now, given an employment record, it seems much more comfortable to do the
inference to determine if that above describes the same person as this:
[a :Person] :describedBy [a :Description ;
:dateAvailable "2002" ;
:homePage
http://www.netcrucible.com/people/joshuaa ] .

urn:tdb:1998:http://LaRrY.MaSiNtEr.NeT
Sure. And that's not necessarily an inference I'd want to hardwire into an
inference engine core. (And I'm sure this will cause me a few problems
before I'm done with it all.)
Based on:
:p1 a :Person; :homePage http://www.NineByNine.org
and
:p2 a :Person; :homePage http://www.ninebynine.org
alone, I'd be hard pushed to conclude :p1 and :p2 both denote the same person.
And then there's:
:p2 a :Person; :homePage http://www.%6eineby%6eine.org
where does one draw the line?
Now, if the web page contained embedded RDF something like:
I _think_ I could then conclude that the homepage three URIs were
equivalent: the ones used to retrieve the page both being equivalent to
the one named in the page. In this way, equivalence of :p1 and :p2 becomes
inferrable through mediation of the retrieval mechanism, which legitimately
interprets the URI structure.

Who's that?-)
Graham Klyne
Sorry, but that's not an URI. The URI syntax forbids escapes
in the host name. Some browsers and other software accept it,
while others don't.
In connection with the IRI and IDN work, there is
where this restriction is (partially) removed.
Actually, the way I wrote it, the restriction is only removed
for octets  =127. I'm not sure this is the best thing to do
in terms of uniformity. Any opinions?
Regards, Martin.
OK, that was a bad example, dashed off too hurriedly. But the initial
point remains: should URI-scheme knowledge be generally allowable in
determining the equivalence of a pair of RDF resource identifiers?
