Hi all,
Does anyone know the best way to mark up short-hand for Square Meters - as
in M2.
It would be good if I could actually envelope the "2" in some tag then I
can style it also as superscript.
Also, how would a screenreader treat any suggested technique.
Regards,
Tim
Tim,
M sup 2 /sup (style away your sup tag if you want, but renders quite
nicely as is...)

Depends on the audience. For a mathematically inclined audience, MathML
might just be appropriate. For an audience with good high school physics,
m sup 2 /sup (note that it is lower case m). For a general audience,
square metres or, possibly, abbr title="square metres" sq. m. /abbr .
(I've got a square meter, but nowadays people use LCD digital displays.)
There is such an element: you surround it with the two tags sup and
/sup . However, there is actually a superscript 2 (&amp;#178;) character
that probably has sufficiently universal support to be safe to use (but
not for a non-mathematical, general, audience). It even seems to be in
code page 437, so available to European/North American PC text mode users.
Lynx cannot upshift the sup element, but can use the superscript 2 glyph.
I think I prefer the character.

The W3C and Unicode consortium prefer markup (see
http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr20/#Superscripts , or the same thing hosted
by W3C at http://www.w3.org/TR/unicode-xml/#Superscripts ).
Unfortunately, it doesn't work well in current browsers, e.g. IE 5.5
upshifts the character but doesn't shrink it. Lynx physically can't
do half line feeds, so ignores the markup.
Oops. I tried it on Linux, so it was actually Mozilla, not IE.
