Thanks very much to David for wading through my use cases and creating the
drawings! I think his diagram in the posting from
captures everything that these use cases require - I just needed to
create a "real world" scenario to wrap my head around them better! I
also don't fully understand the checklists and how they will be organized.
I liked his example at http://www.eramp.com/david/benshtmlchecklist.htm.
I also envision one page that is able to encapsulate the entire checklist
for a specific technology but that may be too complicated.
I agree that it is probably too complicated to add all the checklist links
to the traffic cop but it would be a good idea to add a link to the
checklist gateway from there. I would like to see a link to the checklist
gateway in the cell/row for each guideline. It seems like overkill since
it will be the same link in each cell but a person may enter the traffic
cop in the middle and not find a checklist gateway link at the top or
bottom of the page. Also, do you think it makes sense to add a link to
the checklist from the success criteria page? This will allow direct
access to a checklist with just one hop from the traffic cop. That may
be too complicated to maintain, though, but I think it would be helpful.
In the Jessica example you have:
1) The first link she sends is here:
This actually takes you to a checklist gateway for a particularly
guideline. I was envisioning a Checklist Gateway that is not guideline
specific and allows you to select a technology. I then assumed that Andy
would pick the HTML or CSS set of checklists. But, this gets back to how
the checklists are organized - is it possible to have all of the checklist
for one technology in the same document? One other minor nit in the
diagram is that I expected Andy to print an HTML checklist. You have the
printing from the techniques (which is also a good idea) branch. I just
wanted to include printing so we would think about it when we designed the
checklist page.

Hi David,
Thanks for all the work on this.
A couple suggestions on this general topic:
1) In the guidelines themselves, I think it would be nice to have the
links, but have the big long sentences would make it unduly long. How about
if after every item in the guidelines, we just simply have 2 one-word links.
Perhaps they could be in square brackets to set them off but they would be
in the same line as the guidelines so they wouldn't use up an extra vertical
line of space. For example:
[Checklist] [Techniques]
2) Traffic cop really does cause people problems and also sounds like
Bobby, which is not let that function would be
I don't have a good final suggestion but some ideas to get us thinking.
- Locator
- Technique Locator
- Customizer
3) On the second illustration where you show the two flow pads off of
the guidelines, the first box is the guidelines and the last box at the
bottom is either the techniques or the checklists. Between them are two
boxes which have a description but not a name. Aren't these really the
techniques gateway document and the checklist gateway document? If they are,
we might just label those boxes on the diagram with those names and then put
the function in parenthesis underneath them.

Hi Gregg
techniques. what is the purpose of the techniques gateway ?
Wendy has been working with Shawn from the Authoring Tools Working Group.
Shawn is in charge of the WAI web site revision. She has extensive
experience in usability and she conducted usability studies of WAI
documents. Several of Shawn's key findings include the following:
1) People become disoriented when they are thrust into the middle of a
separate document. (i.e., bouncing from a guideline in the Guidelines
document to the middle of a long techniques or techniques gateway document)
2) Users want a quick effective way to find technology specific
techniques that apply to guidelines (without being thrust into the middle of
those techniques documents)
In preparing for our work, I interviewed 25 Government webmasters who depend
on WCAG. I also interviewed Frances Grenier of the Kansas State University
Accessibility Centre. She is on the State wide accessibility committee for
the Kansas State Government &amp; University web sites. Frances has heard dozens
of comments from web masters who depend upon WCAG. The primary complaint
that Shawn, Frances and myself have found is that it is difficult for users
to find their way through all the WCAG documents. They don't want to be
linked to the middle of a big long technical document. They want to quickly
chose from all of the technology specific methods available to meet a
guideline and see what they have chosen.
The Locator/Cop is an attempt to meet the needs of our users who are out
there working with these documents every day and also to meet the needs of
users who do not have an intimate knowledge of the documents and their
interrelationships such as us on the committee.
Before the locator/cop, the "Techniques Gateway" was slated to take on 2
different functions:
1) to provide technology independent techniques (such as "how to write
a good caption")
2) to direct the user to technology dependant documents to meet
guidelines
It has become apparent to some people on the Techniques committee that these
two functions work against each other. If we are to provide quick, simple
access to technology specific techniques then we need to provide a simple
menu where users can choose the technology they want to fulfill a guideline
rather than sending them to the middle of a long Technology Independent
document and then force them to fish around for links to technology
dependant documents.
Before the cop, in order to go from a guideline to a technique the user
would have to link to the middle of the Techniques Gateway document,
violating Shawn's usability findings. We would be forcing the user to wade
through technology independent techniques to find a HTML or CSS technique to
fulfill a guideline. Once they did find a link to the technology specific
technique in the Techniques Gateway document they would be sent into the
middle of a 3rd or 4th document (technical documents) disorienting them
further. Users have told us this is confusing.
In order to overcome these issues, the technical committee has been
discussing separating the two functions of the Techniques Gateway.
1) The locator/cop is the Navigation part of the Techniques Gateway.
2) The Technology Independent Techniques document would contain the
technology independent principles such as "how to write a good caption".
Wendy has informed us that it would be easy to generate a page via XSLT that
would present
(1) the guideline,
(2) the success criteria
(3) the technology specific technique
(4) technology independent techniques (from the techniques gateway document)
could also be included on this page.
This way the user would have everything they want for a particular guideline
on one page. This page would also contain a link so that the user can enter
the Technique Specific Guidelines document if they choose.
In the guidelines document after each success criteria there would be 2
links:
[Checklists] [Techniques]
If the user selected the [Techniques] link, they could be brought to a page
such as this:
Another option is here:
I hope I have explained this well. Any other committee members are welcome
to add their comments.
A mock up and further discussion is here: www.eramp.com/david

gateway document and the    checklist gateway document? If they are, we
might just label those boxes on the diagram with those names and then put
the function in parenthesis underneath them.
I was going to call these two boxes "mini cops" but thought I better leave
them unnamed for obvious reasons.
I wasn't thinking of those boxes as the current "Technique Gateway" document
which currently contain the "Technology Independent Techniques". I was
thinking of them as what you call above a "Locator" . The way into the
Techniques from the Guidelines (the left middle box) would be something like
this www.eramp.com/david/traffic_cop_from_guidelines.htm The way into the
Checklists from the Guidelines (the right middle box of the 2nd diagram)
would be something like this

Thanks very much to David for wading through my use cases and creating the
drawings! I think his diagram in the posting from
everything that these use cases require - I just needed to create a "real
world" scenario to wrap my head around them better! I also don't fully
understand the checklists and how they will be organized. I liked his
example at http://www.eramp.com/david/benshtmlchecklist.htm
that is able to encapsulate the entire checklist for a specific technology
but that may be too complicated.
I agree that it is probably too complicated to add all the checklist links
to the traffic cop but it would be a good idea to add a link to the
checklist gateway from there. I would like to see a link to the checklist
gateway in the cell/row for each guideline. It seems like overkill since
it will be the same link in each cell but a person may enter the traffic cop
in the middle and not find a checklist gateway link at the top or bottom of
the page. Also, do you think it makes sense to add a link to the
checklist from the success criteria page? This will allow direct access to
a checklist with just one hop from the traffic cop. That may be too
complicated to maintain, though, but I think it would be helpful.
In the Jessica example you have:

This actually takes you to a checklist gateway for a particularly guideline.
I was envisioning a Checklist Gateway that is not guideline specific and
allows you to select a technology. I then assumed that Andy would pick the

are organized - is it possible to have all of the checklist for one
technology in the same document? One other minor nit in the diagram is that
I expected Andy to print an HTML checklist. You have the printing from the

Personally, I like the mock-up and realize that it's a first approach toward bringing all the doucments together in a more usable fashion. Now, whether we call it Traffic Cop and I realize from others this may not be a good term - whatever. We need to make going form one location in our guidelines to other associated materials as easy for individuals as possible.
I liked David's format and flow - it's user friendly and makes sense right from the strart. Thank you for all the hard work, David.

Hi Gregg
"If we use the 'traffic cop/locator' as the link from guidelines to techniques. what is the purpose of the techniques gateway ?
Wendy has been working with Shawn from the Authoring Tools Working Group. Shawn is in charge of the WAI web site revision. She has extensive experience in usability and she conducted usability studies of WAI documents. Several of Shawn's key findings include the following:
1) People become disoriented when they are thrust into the middle of a separate document. (i.e., bouncing from a guideline in the Guidelines document to the middle of a long techniques or techniques gateway document)
2) Users want a quick effective way to find technology specific techniques that apply to guidelines (without being thrust into the middle of those techniques documents)
In preparing for our work, I interviewed 25 Government webmasters who depend on WCAG. I also interviewed Frances Grenier of the Kansas State University Accessibility Centre. She is on the State wide accessibility committee for the Kansas State Government &amp; University web sites. Frances has heard dozens of comments from web masters who depend upon WCAG. The primary complaint that Shawn, Frances and myself have found is that it is difficult for users to find their way through all the WCAG documents. They don't want to be linked to the middle of a big long technical document. They want to quickly chose from all of the technology specific methods available to meet a guideline and see what they have chosen.
The Locator/Cop is an attempt to meet the needs of our users who are out there working with these documents every day and also to meet the needs of users who do not have an intimate knowledge of the documents and their interrelationships such as us on the committee.
Before the locator/cop, the "Techniques Gateway" was slated to take on 2 different functions:
1) to provide technology independent techniques (such as "how to write a good caption")
2) to direct the user to technology dependant documents to meet guidelines
It has become apparent to some people on the Techniques committee that these two functions work against each other. If we are to provide quick, simple access to technology specific techniques then we need to provide a simple menu where users can choose the technology they want to fulfill a guideline rather than sending them to the middle of a long Technology Independent document and then force them to fish around for links to technology dependant documents.
Before the cop, in order to go from a guideline to a technique the user would have to link to the middle of the Techniques Gateway document, violating Shawn's usability findings. We would be forcing the user to wade through technology independent techniques to find a HTML or CSS technique to fulfill a guideline. Once they did find a link to the technology specific technique in the Techniques Gateway document they would be sent into the middle of a 3rd or 4th document (technical documents) disorienting them further. Users have told us this is confusing.
In order to overcome these issues, the technical committee has been discussing separating the two functions of the Techniques Gateway.
1) The locator/cop is the Navigation part of the Techniques Gateway.
2) The Technology Independent Techniques document would contain the technology independent principles such as "how to write a good caption".
Wendy has informed us that it would be easy to generate a page via XSLT that would present
(1) the guideline,
(2) the success criteria
(3) the technology specific technique
(4) technology independent techniques (from the techniques gateway document) could also be included on this page.
This way the user would have everything they want for a particular guideline on one page. This page would also contain a link so that the user can enter the Technique Specific Guidelines document if they choose.
In the guidelines document after each success criteria there would be 2 links:
[Checklists] [Techniques]
If the user selected the [Techniques] link, they could be brought to a page such as this:
Another option is here:
I hope I have explained this well. Any other committee members are welcome to add their comments.

Sorry
You missed my question.
The question wasn't 'why do we need the cop/locator' but rather - how does
this change the role of the techniques gateway?
I like the cop/locator -- maybe the gateway doc needs to be rethought and
repurposed.
OR - maybe the gateway is the paper form and the cop/locator is the parallel
dynamic mechanism.
OR
Maybe we break the gateway into two pieces
1 - the tech independent techniques
2- a gateway/locator
And then the cop/locator becomes an "interactive gateway/locator"
OR..

I think the idea of separating the Techniques Gateway into two chunks is a
good.
That way the Gateway/Locator can focus on just getting people to where they
want to go. And the Technology Independent Techniques could do its job of
showing people the principles of good Captions etc.
I realize we may want the "Technology Independent Techniques" more prominent
than "Technology Specific Techniques." If so here's one idea:
All XSLT generated pages could include a section titled "Things to Remember"
that would list Technology Independent Techniques that are relevant.
If we want "Technology Independent Techniques" the at the same logical level
as the Technology Specific Techniques they would just be one more choice
from the menu of Techniques. i.e.,

Our current thinking is that the "traffic cop" is a new independent
document. The document currently called Gateway to Techniques is tentatively
renamed "Technology-Independent Techniques". Instead of being between the
Success Criteria and the technology-dependent techniques documents (as a
"Gateway" between guidelines and techniques), it would exist at the same
level as the other techniques documents, but heavily referenced from those
documents. The "traffic cop" is a central place to tie things together so we
don't have to deal with everything linking to everything, and it expands and
replaces that part of the role that we previously thought the Gateway to
Techniques to could fill. The discussion has been taking place with a
context coming out of the Wednesday calls and not yet clearly explained on
the list. I hope my explanation helps to clarify, not muddy, things for
those who haven't been on the Wednesday calls. Michael

I'm glad to see even more real-world usability testing (in the form of
interviews) on the topic of WAI documentation. Keep it up!
This is the sort of thing that a good plain-English (for example) rewrite
and a really smashing information architect could easily make work.
For example:
Guideline 1.1
[text]
Who's it for?
How does it improve accessibility?
How do I do it?
Techniques for specific technologies
[list]
Techniques for any technology
(Just off the top of my head there.)
"Locator" is halfway to the right word here. "Traffic cop" is pretty
awful, and reminds me of mid-'80s magazine articles trying to explain what
DOS was.
If you do that, some WCAG 1.0 fundamentalist is gonna come after you
complaining that you made two links (or four, or 20) with the same link
text, not that it matters to anyone but the fundies.
Also, I count three top-posted messages in the one I'm replying to now.

with discipline and the law that 'traffic cop' has.
How do you call someone who works in the information kiosk in a theme park
that you go to to ask for directions or for information about available
attractions? That's the sort of word I'm thinking about.
