I used (successfully) version 8.2 on my PC.
Today when I started Amaya it showed me only black text on black
background.
I downloaded version 8.3 then and installed it over the previous
version.
But that didn't help.
The problem remains.
What could be the reason for that strange behaviour?
Any suggentions?
Kindest regards,

There is probably a reason but I don't know. it could be a trouble during the
install.
Do you have CSS property that sets the black background color?
Often strange behaviours disappear when all previous versions are explicitly
removed before installing the new one.

No.
Amaya doesn't show any web page.
All pages are completely black, regardless of any style sheet.

What is your plateforme : Linux / Windows ?
Do you use the OpenGL version ?
Stephane
OS: Windows 2000 Service Pack 4
Amaya: The "normal" version (not the OpenGL version)
Graphics card: ATI Radeon 7000
Monitor: NEC AccuSync LCD 71VM
Resolution: 1280x1024
Color depth: 16 bit
BTW: I recently changed my monitor.
Before this I was using a CRT at a resolution of 1024x768.
It seems like Amaya worked on my old monitor but does not on the new
one.
Could that be? (Sounds strange to me.)

It could be a problem with images, because Amaya has to manage directly
the image rendering, but not for the text (the text is managed thru standard
Win32 primitives).
We had and solved a problem with screens which are declared 16 bit depth but
actually are 15 bit depth.
Could you try to configure differently your display (in 24 or 32 bits)?

At 32 bits color depth it's still the same:
Amaya shows all web pages just completely black.
I cannot try 24 bits because this option is not offered.
