At the f2f on Oct3, I took an action to look into generating markup
validation reports as EARL.
With some help from sbp, I've now knocked together a first
prototype at URL:http://valet.webthing.com/xslt/ .
Although I'm struggling on the EARL learning curve, Sean tells
me it parses OK, and has promised to review it.
I hope some others on this list will be interested enough to review it.
Comments welcome!

Cool...
Do you have a way for the validator to point to errors as URIs in a spec
instead of just strings? (i.e. do the tests it runs correspond to testts that
are specified as first-class web objects, or are they implicit magic that you
had to develop yourself?)
(BTW, is this URI going to be stable - i.e. can I build another experiment on
top of the first one?)
cheers

That's somewhere on the long-term TBD list, and any public discussion
of it will probably be on the www-validator list[1].
Not necessarily stable. If you want to build another experiment on
top of it, let me know what you need to be stable and we'll take it
from there.

Well, I would like to do a couple of things. The first is to chain it up to
an N3 to XML converter, and the second is to store some data on test cases,
fix them and see how we go about comparing two csequential reports.
The other second thing I would like to do is to hook it up to the Annotea
system for storing the information, and then play with the threading of
reports in Annotea.
The other second thing is to collect other information that has some overlap,
and then to squish the data together and se what we can do.

Charles McCathieNevile:
to
cases,
So the first thing both you and I do, is chain it up to an XML converter -
any chance of you doing this as an option Nick?
I'll be looking at extending Snufkin to look at this data and report on it
(Possibly also putting in some form of Annotea client as I agree Annotea
would be a good place for reports. Although that will require me to learn
all about it.) and also build some sort or "repair tool" that takes an
EARL report and displays the errors to the user in page with their
browser.
Jim.
Ahem - did you read the page? The validator is generating XML to start
with: the EARL is generated by filtering it through XSLT!
The XML reporting has been up-and-running for some months now, and is
likely to be more stable than the EARL.
I'll be interested to see what that looks like. It sounds like
precisely the kind of thing to help judge whether the EARL reports
are going to be useful in the real world.
Another one I'll be interested in ...
- and that's a direction I'm looking to go in myself!
OK, if you are pursuing these projects, just let me know when you are
about to reach the point where something will break if my stuff changes,
and we'll see to it that you can have something stable to work with.
In the meantime, I still need your comments on the reports I'm generating,
as the format and contents of these will very likely be subject to
change as I get to understand the things better.
FWIW, we have a precedent for an app built on top of Site Valet's
XML Validation. The MSIE browser plugin is something Jim dreamed up
and prototyped, and I then integrated with the XMLMessageReporting.

Yep, but I meant RDF XML syntax instead of N3 syntax. (there are online
conversion services available to do this - Sean probably has a URI to hand).
I'll be interested to see what that looks like. It sounds like
precisely the kind of thing to help judge whether the EARL reports
are going to be useful in the real world.
I think it looks like two sets of reports that have some conflicting
statements about the same objects. They would also differ in author and date.
Another one I'll be interested in ...
This is really a mechanism for doing the previous task, but it is in
development - I believe the next version of Amaya will have a working user
interface to play with it.

Well, since I am looking to chain online services together, changing the URI
will break my bookmarkelts I am assuming that (modulo temporary bugs) the
output will continue to be available as RDF in N3, so I can use a service to
convert from (say) EARL 0.95 to EARL 1.0

I tried using: http://swag.webns.net/n3tordf, on some sample output, but
it seems to produce invalid XML. (Where can I get the various python
imports CWM uses, both my Windows, and Cygwin pythons don't have them,
and Google turns up nothing - RDFSink for example.)
Jim.
Hmm. I would go to the RDF Interest group to ask stuff like this... and will.

Hmmm - fair enough, but is there any advantage to using EARL as your
starting point over using XML?
- and presumably the acid test is whether you can really gain anything
by combining those reports?
Where does this get discussed? Is there any reading material?
hmmm, well,
I'll post advnce notice of any change to this list, so you get the
chance to shout if it looks likely to break something. If you
absolutely want an immutable URL, I'll run it (also) at some
path away from any namespace I might want to re-use. Maybe
something like valet.webthing.com/Chaals/ ?

The XML serialisation of EARL is much, much nicer than the N3 (that's
personal opinion of course.), and more importantly there's a parser
installed with lots of the browsers out there - Forcing a Python + Python
libraries to get the Snufkin Earl client running is I think
unreasonable - quite apart from being a 15mb download rather than the
current 300k.

Of course you can, it's not (currently) feasible to integrate my script
checker with Site-Valet - I can't even put a web interface on it at this
time, yet a combined report would be useful to users.
Jim.
OK, we have two conflicting requirements here:
(1) This is experimental: I want to be able to update it as I see
fit and without regard to back-compatibility.
(2) Others want a stable interface
To accommodate both, I've duplicated the existing service at
remain stable so long as anyone needs it to.
