In the DOM level 1 test nodeparentnodenull, the variable createdNode is
declared with type NodeList. I think this should be type Node. The line

Test nodeparentnodenull (DOM level 1)Actually in the original test, it is an Element - it appears that the DOM L1 java binding
returns an Element from the createElement method that is used for the createdNode
variable.

Test nodeparentnodenull (DOM level 1)I have corrected this in the CVS.
I was suprised that this hadn't come up as a failure for some processor on the cast of an Element to a NodeList, however Xerces (and apparently Crimson) implement both NodeList and Element on the same class and the mistaken casts succeeded. The problem wasn't detected in the ECMAScript bindings since there are no explicit casts and we haven't implemented any return type checking.
The improper type was in the original commit.
