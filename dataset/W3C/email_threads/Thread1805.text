Subject: expand-property report, exapnding
version-controlled-binding-set ?
Hi,
The rfc3253 says:
Many property values are defined as a DAV:href, or a set of DAV:href
elements. The DAV:expand-property report provides a mechanism for
retrieving in one request the properties from the resources
identified by those DAV:href elements. ...
Since DAV:version-controlled-binding-set is list of
(binding-name, version-history)
elements and not list of hrefs it seems to me that it is not possible to
further expand this property. For example the next request tries
to expand
version-controlled-binding-set:
REPORT /foo.html HTTP/1.1
Host: www.webdav.org
Content-Length: xxxx
?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?
D:expand-property xmlns:D="DAV:"
/D:property
/D:property
/D:expand-property
But, since members of version-controlled-binding-set are not
href's (and they
are not resources) we can not further expand this property.
Is this correct ?
The embedded version-history element has the href-format, so you should be
able to do:
?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?
D:expand-property xmlns:D="DAV:"
/D:property
/D:expand-property
(if what you're after is the DAV:creator-displayname of the version
history).
version-controlled-binding-set members are version-controlled-binding's
and version-controlled-binding is even not a resource so we can not
ask it for its properties (creator-displayname is this case).
Which part of the rfc3253 says that we should use version-history part
of a version-controlled-binding element for property expansion ?
What if version-controlled-binding element (or any other) would have
two href members, which one should be used for expand-property report ?

Sasa

As you said, version-controlled-bindings consists of binding-name
version-history. version-history has href format, so you *can* expand that
if you want to.
None. It depends on whose property you want. You can't get the properties of
the binding name (it's not a resource), but you *can* get the properties of
the version history.
Both.
Just wanted to confirm that I agree with Julian on this thread, i.e.
you can use the DAV:expand-property report to expand DAV:href
elements that are nested arbitarily deeply in the property value,
in particular, to expand the version history DAV:href elements
in the DAV:version-controlled-binding-set.

And it goes on saying:
"... If there are DAV:property elements nested within a DAV:property
element, then every DAV:href in the value of the corresponding property is
replaced by a DAV:response element whose DAV:prop elements report the values
of the properties identified by the nested DAV:property elements. The nested
DAV:property elements can in turn contain DAV:property elements, so that
multiple levels of DAV:href expansion can be requested."
When I implemented the expand-property report I asked this question here
([1]), and the answer was: all href elements must be expanded, independant
of the nesting, including dead properties.
