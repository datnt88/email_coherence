What tools can be used to check n-triples. Aaron suggested cwm. Where can
I get that from? Any others? Euler? Needs to run on a win2k machine.

CWM is available at:
It should work just fine on Windows, although you'll need to
download Python.
If your documents have URIs, you can run them through:
[ "Aaron Swartz" ; mailto:me@aaronsw.com ; http://www.aaronsw.com/ ]
CWM is in CVS:
The announcement contains some useful CVS info:
Euler runs OK on my Linux (RedHat, Intel) box.
Attached are some notes I cached regarding installing CWM on
my Linux system.

Version 1.54 of CWM:
requires Python version 2.0:
and an SAX-based RDF parser:
The following instructions worked with Linux RedHat 6.2 [i386]:
# Build and Install Python 2.0
% mkdir python_2_0_dir
# download Python 2: http://www.python.org/2.0/
% mv *.tar.gz python_2_0_dir/
% cd python_2_0_dir
% gunzip *.tar.gz
% tar -xvf *.tar
% ./configue
% gmake
% su; gmake install
# Build and Install Python XML parser
% mkdir python_xml_dir
# download PyXML - Python XML parser version 0.6.5 - the *.tar.gz file:
% mv *.tar.gz python_xml_dir/
% cd python_xml_dir
% gunzip *.tar.gz
% tar -xvf *.tar
% python setup.py build
% su; python setup.py install
If you just want to check the syntax of an n-triples file,
I suggest one of the little perl ditties I made up:
But it sounds like you want to check that two n-triples
files are equivalent, or convert from n-triples to RDF/xml
and back, in which case you'll need something like cwm
or Euler or a little time hacking in prolog ...
or from CVS
ArtB managed to install it an took notes on what it takes...
Art, have you made that publicly readable yet?
TimBL runs cwm on a Win2k machine, I think.

Hi Brian,
the things described in
are running on a win2k machine
for cwm we use python 2.1 which can be found at

Has anyone written a Perl parser for n-triples? For that matter, what is
the canonical reference for the n-triple data format? I'd like to write
some tests to run in my Perl code...

OK, spot who was reading (and replying to!) his email in reverse
chronlogical order. This is just what I was looking for, thanks... :)
