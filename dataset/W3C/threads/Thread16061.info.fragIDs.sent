aloha, y'all! 
a recent exchange on the AU WG list -- which begins at: (long URL warning!) reminded me, that, a few months ago, whilst working under a tight deadline, i found myself searching the W3C's MarkUp web space... in the course of listening to the MarkUp activity's main page, i heard the announcement for what was then the brand new reformulation of strict HTML4 into XML -- XHTML (TM), but since the trademark symbol was superscripted, part of a hyperlink, and there was no white space between the TM and the XHTML, what i heard was that the W3C was promulgating something named X H T M L T M -- which confused the hell out of me, for whilst i instantly identified meaning of the X the H the T the initial M and the L, i could not, for the life of me, figure out what in the world the extra T and M stood for, until i took a listen to the document source and discovered that what i took for part of the ML's acronym was actually a trademark symbol (as defined by the character entity &amp;#8482;)... needless to say, i wasted a good deal of time trying to figure out something which could have easily been made self-evident, had the trademark been encapsulated in an ACRONYM with the TITLE "trademark" which brings me to wonder--can one use ABBR and ACRONYM on character entity set codes? 
i don't "see" why not -- after all, a character entity code is just a bit of text -- but can't find anything that says whether or not it's kosher... gregory He that lives on Hope, dies farting -- Benjamin Franklin, Poor Richard's Almanack, 1763 Gregory J. Rosmaita oedipus@hicom.net

If it isn't against the spirit or letter of the specifications then it is probably allowed. 
Based on that assumption, I would say that it is kosher to mark up a single character as an ABBR or ACRONYM. 
In the same way that it is kosher to mark up a greek letter gamma. 
For most cases it is perhaps redundant, but thre are probably times when it is helpful. 
And my opinion (speaking from the bazaar, or is that the bizarre *grin*, rather than the cathedral) is that it is syntactically legal and sound to do so.

aloha, charles! 
thanks for the response -- i was thinking along the same lines... as for the potential for redundancy, i was particularly thinking of users on machines with limited character set support... this is particularly the case for a lot of lynx users, especially if they are unversed in the difference between character sets (for, as you know, you can tell lynx which charset to use -- i myself use 7-bit approximations, so that i don't have strange ANSI blips or sudden silences when encountering character entities that code for the extended ASCII characters... and, as you point out, it is helpful to markup greek letters, such as those used in mathematical and logical equations slash formulae... gregory.
