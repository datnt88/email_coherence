Volker, 
Can you load the attached doc up in your browser? 
And let me know how 
example 4 looks? 
( I put character refs in ). 
BTW this is just the doc 
in the 2/06/LC directory.

Cool, I'm sure between us we can get the document fixed up. 
Nilo, are you happy that you know what changes are needed? 
Gudge 
Thanks, Gudge. 
Without checking, I had mistakenly assumed that the editor I was using, W3C's Amaya, had inserted the appropriate unicode character codes. 
It had not, using platform specific support instead. 
I also see what Volker's problem is/was. 
I shall insert the character refs into all occurrences of the name so that it renders the same whether the encoding chosen on the browser is Western European or UTF-8. 
I think this should solve the "problem". 
Thanks 
Nilo 
PS. Yves and/or Gudge: Are you going to create a new directory for the latest editor's copy. 
Thanks. 
Well, the encoding of the document is iso-8859-1, which is the default for 
text/html. 
As "d8 ?", 
"f3 ?" and "c5 ?" are valid characters, they don't need to be escaped.

The conclusion is, the document is OK as-is, or should use the proper 
iso-8859-1 encoding if the plain characters have to disappear.

OK, no change should be necessary then. 
But I'm not sure how this helps Volker...

Volker: 
I am going to make the suggested change so as to allow the correct rendition on all browsers no matter how their encoding type is configured. 
I think we all agree that this is a separate editorial change, and that the PR open issue addressed a separate problem 
which Gudge aswered to the originator's satisfaction, and that we should recoomed at next 
week's telcon that it be closed. 
Thanks Nilo

It is not a question that the document is legal html. 
But at least one person was confused about the xml examples. 
I think the confusion was caused by a misunderstanding of how UTF-8 works. 
Changing the iso-8859-1 chars to there encoded representations ?ke 
J?gvan ?yvind - &amp;Aring;ke J&amp;oacute;gvan &amp;Oslash;yvind will not change the document at all but might stop confusing people that are not HTML, XML UTF9 etc. experts :) 
But when people view the HTML they should just see ?ke J?gvan ?yvind... And that's what I see write now in my browser. 
Sounds more like a browser bug to me.

It seems to me that you may have set (perhaps inadvertently) your browser's 
character encoding setting (typically under the View menu item) to UTF-8. 
Volker, can you reset it to "Auto-select" and see if you browser cannot automatically 
pick up the correct encoding ISO 8859-1 of the html document and display the 
wretched (made up) name correctly in all instances. 
Thanks, Nilo 
Perfect. 
We are all on the same page, I think. 
I'll use the unicode character references, which, as a quick check will show, displays the name correctly using various browser encoding choices, (although other text may become gibberish ;-) Thanks Nilo
