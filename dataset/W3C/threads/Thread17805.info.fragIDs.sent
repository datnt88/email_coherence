<s> WAI User Agent Guidelines Teleconference 19 May 1999 Chair: Jon Gunderson (from Madison) Scribe: Ian Jacobs Present: Marja Koivunen Harvey Bingham Chris Weaver (New Mexico State) Madeleine Rothberg (WGBH) Mark Novak Agenda ACTIONS: - (NEW) Action Chris: Write up Math techniques proposal and post to mailing list.  </s>
<s> MR to review this.  </s>
<s> - (NEW) Action editors: Incorporate resolutions into next draft of document.  </s>
<s> - IJ: Write DJW about requirements T&amp;S/WAI.  </s>
<s> Wrote twice, no reply.  </s>
<s> Will follow up.  </s>
<s> (Continue All IJ actions) - CMN: Write techniques for 7.2.2 and 7.2.6 CMN deferred until publication of NOte by Rich and Mark.  </s>
<s> Probably continued.  </s>
<s> - JG: Techniques for 7.2.2.  </s>
<s> Not done.  </s>
<s> - JG: Techniques for 7.2.1.  </s>
<s> Not done.  </s>
<s> - JG: Contact Rob about 7.2.4/5/6 Rob hasn't been participating and we have consensus on checkpoints in this section.  </s>
<s> JG: I need to contact Rob about this.  </s>
<s> We want TECHNIQUES that point to vendor-developed (internal) guidelines.  </s>
<s> This for platform-specific conventions.  </s>
<s> - JG: Contact Rich S. and Peter Korn for techniques.  </s>
<s> JG: I contacted Rich but not Peter.  </s>
<s> - JA: Check guidelines for information about tooltip control.  </s>
<s> Not done.  </s>
<s> - Editor: Group navigation by function.  </s>
<s> IJ: We may have been here already.  </s>
<s> Will look into how this would fit into the document.  </s>
<s> - MK: Propose navigation checkpoint to time-sensitive parts of a document.  </s>
<s> MK: Not done.  </s>
<s> JG: This is about navigation the SMIL tree or parts of a multi-media presentation.  </s>
<s> MK: If a link is time-dependent, allow the user to navigate it independent of time.  </s>
<s> JG: Review this in terms of stop/start/rewind/fast-forward checkpoints.  </s>
<s> CLOSED ACTIONS: - HB: Checkpoint for metadata search.  </s>
<s> HB: This became attribute-value search.  </s>
<s> But in addition, give user information about attribute/value pairs.  </s>
<s> IJ: Is this a good feature or a solution that requires users to know even more about the document?  </s>
<s> JB: HB should write a technique that shows how it's useful for accessibility.  </s>
<s> HB: Already done.  </s>
<s> - JG: Add issue to issues list about "accesskey" recognition.  </s>
<s> JG: I think I did that.  </s>
<s> On the mailing list, the conclusion to proposals was not to have a checkpoint about support for access keys.  </s>
<s> Instead, discuss it in HTML accessibility features section.  </s>
<s> Implementation details in the techniques document.  </s>
<s> - JG: Organize Math discussion.  </s>
<s> Done.  </s>
<s> Had discussion last week.  </s>
<s> On agenda this week.  </s>
<s> /* Brief discussion of presence of accessibility at WWW8 */ Brief discussion of difficulty of getting UA Guidelines to Recommendation HB: This is where the rubber hits the road.  </s>
<s> JG: People will buy into them when they start asking their tools for support.  </s>
<s> Agenda 1) Discusion and resolution of support of math Issue #12: Recommend full implmentation of MathML http://cmos- eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#12  </s>
<s> JG: Three main conclusions: a) Provide access to math document tree (preferably MathML).  </s>
<s> Add this to current navigation techniques.  </s>
<s> b) Recommend MathML if user agent/plug-in handles math.  </s>
<s> c) Make math information available to assistive technologies (e.g., XML tree).  </s>
<s> MR: The alternative to MathML is that authors create graphical images of math, which is problematic.  </s>
<s> Can't we encourage MathML more strongly?  </s>
<s> IJ: Checkpoint that says "If you do math, use MathML" and motivate this instead of requiring authors to use images.  </s>
<s> CW: What do we mean by "rendering" math?  </s>
<s> IJ: I think that we mean prefer MathML as a markup language.  </s>
<s> CW: What if a UA encounters a math document on the Web.  </s>
<s> Should we recommend that UAs be able to read this, or is more of the domain of plug-ins?  </s>
<s> JG: In Web Content, this was discussed and conclusion was that math and science are part of a larger framework.  </s>
<s> IJ: The larger framework is "Use W3C Recommendations where available."  </s>
<s> Maybe need a mirror checkpoint to "Implement applicable W3C Recommendations".  </s>
<s> JG: Say this in the Techniques document?  </s>
<s> IJ: I think this can be said in guideline themselves.  </s>
<s> E.g., may want to encourage support for deprecated features.  </s>
<s> PROPOSAL: Review WCAG checkpoints.  </s>
<s> See if this group covers all of them or needs to mirror them.  </s>
<s> Checkpoint 11.1, if mirrored by UAGL, would cover MathML (which could be listed as an example).  </s>
<s> RESOLVED: Bring WCAG checkpoints from guideline 11 into Guideline 7.1.  </s>
<s> In short, rework 7.1 based on that.  </s>
<s> Ensure that Math is part of that as an example.  </s>
<s> SMIL as well.  </s>
<s> CW: Is a similar concern being taken to the AU WG? JB: They will probably reference UAGL in this area.  </s>
<s> Agenda 2) Issue #13: Provide keyboard access to MathML similar to forms JG: What's between navigation of math document tree and navigation of linear navigation of equation.  </s>
<s> IJ: What about lower bound/upper bound of an integral?  </s>
<s> JG: Linear is appropriate for simple equations.  </s>
<s> Need this for simple situations and naive users.  </s>
<s> Discussion last week about some middle ground.  </s>
<s> Maybe just talk about these two approaches in techniques; this might be sufficient for math in this document.  </s>
<s> CW: You need to get through a math tree unambiguously.  </s>
<s> Linear is depth-first.  </s>
<s> Tree is a "node-announcing breadth-first search".  </s>
<s> Users should be able to shrink or expand subtrees.  </s>
<s> Need clues about what the children are (math nodes tend to be very sparse).  </s>
<s> You may need to know about the depth of subtrees in order to guess where to navigate.  </s>
<s> IJ: I see the same techniques useful for, e.g., navigating a document structure such as headers.  </s>
<s> CW: Math is a somewhat special case due to sparseness.  </s>
<s> We should be sure that the guidelines ensure that the tree structure is apparent.  </s>
<s> Yes, it fits under a checkpoint about navigating the document tree.  </s>
<s> CONCLUSION: Just include math in current checkpoints.  </s>
<s> Action CW: Write math technique proposal (with others if desired, e.g., Raman and Gardner).  </s>
<s> Action MR: Review this proposal.  </s>
<s> Agenda 3) Issue #14: MathML objects should be included as part of the document tree JG: Ensure that we mention XML in checkpoint about exposing tree.  </s>
<s> IJ: Do we need to say anything specific about math if it's covered in sections on (1) Use W3C specs (2) Use the DOM?  </s>
<s> HB: Need to mention entities/mapping to semantics.  </s>
<s> User agent issue to convert symbols into (notably spoken) rendering that is part of the math terminology.  </s>
<s> IJ: To me, I hear "semantics" and I think "schemas."  </s>
<s> JB: Do we need to say "support schemas"?  </s>
<s> IJ: Political issue right now about convergence of RDF and XML.  </s>
<s> CW: If the author has made the spoken rendering available (e.g., through a schema), then the user agent should make that information available to the user.  </s>
<s> MK: What about the reading order?  </s>
<s> JG: Is this a navigation issue?  </s>
<s> Or do we need to say something about "when markup is available for content substitution, make the content available".  </s>
<s> IJ: Covered by 5.2.1.  </s>
<s> Perhaps ensure that namespaces included in examples.  </s>
<s> CW: MathML provides separate content markup for use by computation engines.  </s>
<s> It's supposed to be included with the math and can be passed around, e.g., for evaluation of expressions.  </s>
<s> JG: Put details in techniques doc.  </s>
<s> Agenda 4) Structural/Editorial changes to document (based on Web Content Accessibility Guidelines experience) RESOLVED: Adopt single-digit numbering of guidelines as per WCAG.  </s>
<s> Push "structure" to introduction.  </s>
<s> CW: I like single-digit number systems.  </s>
<s> They should agree across guidelines for consistency.  </s>
<s> IJ: Will be difficult to track changes in WCAG.  </s>
<s> I think this WG should choose the most important and put them first.  </s>
<s> RESOLVED: Move terms/definitions to a glossary at the end.  </s>
<s> I believe that in the discussion of the WCAG there was mention that LaTeX has existing support (conversion to sound and Braille) that MathML lacks at this time.  </s>
<s> So an image with LaTeX in the markup is a better solution right now than MathML.  </s>
<s> Did Chris Weaver have anything to say about current LaTeX support and transition strategies?  </s>
<s> Al  </s>
<s> At the face to face meeting in Toronto, the WCAG were discussed.  </s>
<s> It was also discussed that the User Agent group (guidelines)should address user agent dependencies specifically mentioned in the WCAG.  </s>
<s> Below is a listing of all WCAG checkpoints that say "...until user agents ..." can do some function.  </s>
<s> 1.2?Provide redundant text links for each active region of an image map.  </s>
<s> [Priority?1 - if server-side image maps are used, Priority?2 - if client-side image maps are used.  </s>
<s> Redundant text links for client-side image maps are only required until user agents render text equivalents for the map links.]  </s>
<s> 6.4?For scripts and applets, until user agents provide device-independent means to activate event handlers, ensure that event handlers are keyboard operable.  </s>
<s> 7.1?Until  </s>
<s> user agents allow users to control it, avoid causing the screen to flicker.  </s>
<s> 7.2?Until user agents allow users to control it, avoid causing content to blink (i.e., change presentation at a regular rate, such as turning on and off).  </s>
<s> 7.3?Until  </s>
<s> user agents allow users to freeze moving content, avoid movement in pages.  </s>
<s> 7.4?Until user agents provide the ability to stop the refresh, do not create periodically auto-refreshing pages.  </s>
<s> 10.1?Until user agents allow users to turn off spawned windows, do not cause pop-ups or other windows to appear and do not change the current window without informing the user.  </s>
<s> 10.3?Until user agents or assistive technologies render side-by-side text correctly, provide a linear text alternative (on the current page or some other) for all tables that lay out text in parallel, word-wrapped columns.  </s>
<s> 10.4?Until user agents handle empty controls correctly, include default, place-holding characters in edit boxes and text areas.  </s>
<s> 13.6?Group related links, identify the group (for user agents), and, until user agents do so, provide a way to bypass the group.  </s>

<s> At the meeting on wednesday it was noted tht Chris Weaver had asked about the Authoring Tools group and their approach to MathML and W3C specifications.  </s>
<s> In the draft of May 6 - http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/WAI-AUTOOLS-19990506 checkpoint 2.1 (the first checkpoint) is "use applicable W3C specifications".  </s>
<s> So where a w3c recommendation exists such as MathML it is a P2 requirement that it be used rather than another method.  </s>
<s> Also, things like namespaces are included in this, which will make life a lot easier.  </s>
<s> If User Agent does the same, it will not only provide consistency which is not a bad thing, but provide a general mechanism for dealing with a number of problems.  </s>
<s> For example, the MathML one largely seems to be resolved - MathML, DOM, namespaces, XHTML (especially modularised) allows the incoporation of MathML and the required navigation information in a simple manner.  </s>
