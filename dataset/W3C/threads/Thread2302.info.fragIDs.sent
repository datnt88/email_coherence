<s> I have a question about the intention of If-Range behavior under certain conditions.  </s>
<s> Given a request of the form: GET /doc.html  </s>
<s> HTTP/1.1 If-Match: "abc" Range: 500-1000 If-Range: "xyz" Given the If-Match fails, you would return 412 except for the If-Range being present.  </s>
<s> The problem is now what is meant to happen.  </s>
<s> The If-Range has used a different entity tag which *does* match.  </s>
<s> Section 14.27 says that if the entity tag matches, the server should return the sub-range with a 206 return code, otherwise the entire entity and a 200 return code.  </s>
<s> However section 14.36 specifically states that the Range: header does not affect anything but a 200 response - so in this case the If-Range header just doesn't matter, you'd return a 412.  </s>
<s> Since the spec allows it, is there a reason to use a different entity tag in the If-Range header?  </s>
<s> Is there a reason to have a parameter for If-Range instead of refering to If-Match or If-Unmodified-Since parameters?  </s>
<s> Yes. Yes.  </s>
<s> You've asked two different questions here.  </s>
<s> The first is easy: GET /foo HTTP/1.1 Range: 500-1000 If-Match: "abc, "xyz" If-Range: "xyz" This clearly says: if the entity is "abc", send me the whole thing, if it's "xyz", send me the second 500 bytes, otherwise, send me a 412.  </s>
<s> As for the second question, the reason that If-Range is a seperate header than If-Match/None-Match/Modified-Since/Unmodified-Since is to make it easy for servers to not support ranges.  </s>
<s> If the semantics of If-* changed when a range request was present, that would mean that all servers would need to at least be aware of ranges, otherwise the wrong behavior could result.  </s>
<s> This would include the millions of existing servers, if someone wanted to use a date with a Range request, since that would entail the use of If-Modified-Since.  </s>
<s> So If-Range is a perfect solution, since it can be ignored by non-range-supporting browsers along with Range:, and the correct result can always be obtained.  </s>
<s> (a full 200 response, if availble).  </s>
<s> It seems putting an entity tag (or date) with the If-Range is redundant unless there is a reason a client would want to retrieve a byte range of an entity which doesn't match the primary entity tag sent.  </s>
<s> If-Range and the other If-* headers won't be used together 99.9% of the time.  </s>
<s> See, here's the intended scenario (or something like it): A server sends a browser the first 100 bytes of a 1000 byte document with an entity tag of "abc".  </s>
<s> But the connection gets broken and the browser wants to go back and get the rest of it.  </s>
<s> So it sends: GET /foo HTTP/1.1 Range: 100-999 If-Range: "abc"  </s>
<s> Remember that the browser wants to, eventually, have the whole document.  </s>
<s> If the server supports ranges, and the etag is still "abc" for that document, it sends the missing 900 bytes.  </s>
<s> If the server doesn't support ranges, or the entity tag has changed, it gets sent the whole document, which is what the browser wanted.  </s>
<s> With If-Match, it would have gotten a 412, and it would have had to retry the document - doing this for *every* single document that one does a range request for (which could be a lot of them) could get slow.  </s>
<s> So the If-Range header is provided to "short-circuit" the additional request.  </s>
<s> At least, that's my take on it all.  </s>
<s> I only speak for me.  </s>

<s> Ok. I see what I was reading now.  </s>
<s> I was reading the first paragraph of 14.27 and thinking If-Range was meant as a modifier to only a conditional GET using If-Unmodified-Since or If-Match.  </s>
<s> I guess I just needed someone to point out the obvious.  </s>
