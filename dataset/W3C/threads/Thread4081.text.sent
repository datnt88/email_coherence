I sent this privately to one of the editors, but am sending it here as an official last call comment from the WAI so it gets addressed. 
Also, in his reply Ashok indicated to me that the group was thinking of getting rid of the nested HTML lists that show type hierarchy relations in later sections, please do not do this as it would make your specification document even more inaccessible. 
Finally WAI --we may want to point the QA group at these kinds of issues where type hierarchy and other technical information get buried in a diagram in a specification document, I think that is just a bad idea in general. 
Details: section 1.2 contains a diagram for the type hierarchy --but fails to spell out the hierarchy outside of the diagram. 
It does pretend to be a good access citizen in that it explains the notation used in the diagram; however this is inadequate for someone wishing to get at the content. 
Could you: A) provide me witht he missing content, and B) ensure that the next working draft fixes the problem? 
What I'm looking for is a textual summary of the type hierarchy --set of nested html lists would do fine.

Anyway, yes, it seems a pretty obviously sensible one for us to make officially.

Note that the Formal semantics gives all the type definitions in accessible form. 
The HTML format is highly confusing since the representation depends on your browser setting. 
I think it would be better to have a reference to the definitions in the formal semantics.... Best regards Michael
