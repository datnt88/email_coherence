On of the problems we still face in out guidelines work is how to handle the interim and future issues. 
It is just too confusing to say that people should use stylesheets for laying out pages when we all know they don't work that way with any browsers today. 
Putting future next to them is confusing and won't be accurate in 6 months anyway. 
So we thought about building trigger points into guidelines so that they make sense both today and after the trigger point has been reached. 
For example LAYOUT OF PAGES Once all of the major browsers support CSS-2 and the browsers are used by the majority of users, CSS should be used to control layout and presentation. 
Until then tables (to control layout) and bit mapped text (for special text effects) may be used with alternate accessible pages as necessary. 
NOTES: a) Support of CSS-2 refers to blah blah blah , positioning, blah blah. 
b) Major browsers means Netscape, MSIE, Lynx, Opera, Others?) c) The definition of "Majority of users" is actually up to the page author. 
That is, when are they comfortable using CSS to lay out a page knowing that the page will appear quite differently to browsers that do not handle style sheets. 
It should be remembered though that we want the pages to look good wihtough style sheets anyway. 
So what are your thoughts and suggestions on this approach? 
Better than the past? 
Good enough to address the major problem we had? 
Got a better idea yet?

For a list of our listserves send "lists" to listproc@tracecenter.org Actually, I thoroughly disagree. 
The use of tables to provide formatting is simply poor practice for accessibility, and it should be made clear that this is so. 
Instead we should point out that until browsers implement CSS there is no accessible way to provide pixel-level positioning. 
Probably about the same place that we point out why different sized display devices (not to mention braille displays etc) mean that providing absolute positioning is foolish. 
We might as well write guidelines for how to do it right. 
If people want to use the medium incorrectly for an effect they thinik they are getting, then we ought to point out to them why they shouldn't (x.y Use a proper DTD, and use the elements properly) and hope that some of them actually listen. 
If they are told that table-forced layout is inaccessible then they will realise that to meet the guidelines they hvae to find some other mechanism - an alternative format, or convince their graphic designer that varying spatial layout is now part of the brief. 
Charles McCathieNevile Maybe I seemed a little carried away on one issue in my last post (it's very early here, and I am a night-bird). 
The point I was trying to make is that we should encourage people to recognise things which limit accessibility (such as lack of stylesheets) as limits of the medium, in this case a restriction on the availability of formatting control. 
In other cases, such as the use of D-links or LONGDESC, then we should identify D-link as the Interim solution. 
We should recommend that LONGDESC be included as well as D-link, which is necessary until such time as HTML 4.0 compliant browsers are more or less universal. 
We should also point out that this is likely to be some considerable time away.
