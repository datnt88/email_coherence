<s> Joe,  </s>
<s> By no captions in Flash, I assume that you mean there is no functionality in the Flash authoring tool explicitly dedicated to the development of  </s>
<s> captions.  </s>
<s> However, Flash can be captioned.  </s>
<s> On our Rich Media Accessibility Web site (http://ncam.wgbh.org/richmedia/showcase.html), we have an example of a Flash movie that was captioned in the Flash authoring tool by the original  </s>
<s> developer.  </s>
<s> This entailed putting text in the movie area, in the same way that any text appears in a Flash presentation.  </s>
<s> This is laborious, and can't say that I recommend it because it places the burden of captioning on the Flash developers.  </s>
<s> Suffice it to say, Flash developers are not usually trained captioners.  </s>
<s> We have also finished captioning another Flash movie, this time using MAGpie2, and playing the Flash movie in a Quicktime SMIL file with the captions added.  </s>
<s> The disadvantage here is that you need both the Flash player and the QuickTime player.  </s>
<s> This example will be in the showcase soon,  </s>
<s> and there is a similar example with a Flash movie playing in the Realplayer with captions on the University of Toronto Web site.  </s>
<s> I agree that it is not as easy as we would like, but it is possible to produce captioned Flash.  </s>
