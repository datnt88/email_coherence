Dear All, I thought that this link might help those with concerns about accessibility and Flash. 
I am afraid that I know of no flash websites that offer accessible content, which is a shame. 
Hope this is of help Sime Behalf Of Charles McCathieNevile Compliant to what? 
As far as I know there are no screen readers that have access to Flash objects, so the best that can be done is whatever is provided by the alternative version of the content. 
I may be wrong, and I believe that Macromedia are working on Flash so that new players will provide direct access at some point and new content will be able to include the required information for it to be accessible. 
But for timelines and so on you would need to ask Macromedia. 
cheers Charles McCN Are there any websites that have examples of Flash that are compliant and can be read by a screen reader. 
Thanks in advance.

when i was at the united states mint, we had two programs for the interactive maps, the 50 states quarters and golden dollar. 
They used the techniques where an ALT tag was generatd that described the object, which was a map, as well as data fields option in that represented the information.

I used to have it running (when I had a native linux system, before some other propritary stuff trashed my computer) without a sound card. 
I assume that at the very least there are captions available. 
There are no captions in Flash, or audio descriptions, subtitles, or dubbing.

Joe, 
By no captions in Flash, I assume that you mean there is no functionality in the Flash authoring tool explicitly dedicated to the development of 
captions. 
However, Flash can be captioned. 
On our Rich Media Accessibility Web site (http://ncam.wgbh.org/richmedia/showcase.html), we have an example of a Flash movie that was captioned in the Flash authoring tool by the original 
developer. 
This entailed putting text in the movie area, in the same way that any text appears in a Flash presentation. 
This is laborious, and can't say that I recommend it because it places the burden of captioning on the Flash developers. 
Suffice it to say, Flash developers are not usually trained captioners. 
We have also finished captioning another Flash movie, this time using MAGpie2, and playing the Flash movie in a Quicktime SMIL file with the captions added. 
The disadvantage here is that you need both the Flash player and the QuickTime player. 
This example will be in the showcase soon, 
and there is a similar example with a Flash movie playing in the Realplayer with captions on the University of Toronto Web site. 
I agree that it is not as easy as we would like, but it is possible to produce captioned Flash.

Yup. No standard tools and no data structures within the files. 
And captions by themselves are insufficient. 
Wellllll, if we're gonna talk examples, let's not forget this one: 
Flash inside QuickTime. 
Kooky. 
Like a stripper inside a birthday cake.

For those interested in Flash, I also recommend the notes from Phillip Kerman's August 1st presentation at Web Design World Seattle, entitled "Where Does Flash Fit In?" The handouts are now available on his website at http://www.phillipkerman.com/wdw2001/ . 
(Interestingly, I found Phillip's Flash presentations _more_ usable via keyboard-only input than via mouse input.) I have not spoken with anyone who knows the estimated release date of a Flash version that works with screen readers. 
I will try to find out more. 
If anyone on the list has more information on this issue, or knows someone at Macromedia who might provide that information, please let me know. 
Thanks.
