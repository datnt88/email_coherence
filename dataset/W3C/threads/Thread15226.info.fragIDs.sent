I was to write two paragraphs on the use of long descriptions in frames and Long Descriptions in Frames: The use of "Longdesc" (Long Description) in Frames is not recommended because the "Longdesc" command is currently not well supported by User Agents. 
Here is a paragraph on Text Based Menus: Although graphical based menus are accessible when "alt text" is used, there are advantages to creating menus that are completely text based. 
Graphical text is not easily scalable. 
The size of graphical text cannot be increased easily by those who may need a larger font. 
Alternatively, text based menus allow for relative font sizes to be used on menu links. 
Relative font sizes can be easily increased in most browsers without the use of assistive technology.

Looks good. 
By the way. 
If you don't use Longdesc - what do you use? 
For pictures - longdesc can be required as level 1 but d-link cannot. 
So if you recommend against longdesc, then we must make descriptions be level 2 items. 
(unghh) We really should get longdesc supported!!!. 
Also, this is one of those things where - if we recommend against longdesc, are we tailoring our recommendations based on bad user agents? 
Hmmmmmm. 
Tough one.

Hi Gregg [Tech doc] Longdesc works fine for Images etc. 
We wouldn't deprecate that use of LongDesc in "straight" documents. 
It is when the Londesc command is used to describe frames where its support breaks up. 
So it is only as a description of Frames where we are not recommending it. 
At this point WindowEyes, Jaws and Home Page Reader don't have predictable or clean support of Londesc in Frames. 
We've tested this quite extensively. 
I'd be fine with calling these companies up and lobbying them for us. 
(Perhaps I could get them to clean up with their flaky "Title" attribute support also.) If someone has some contact names I'd be glad to pursue it in a nice and diplomatic way. 
(On the other hand, it seems Frames are on their way out anyway) Cheers David MacDonald Access Empowers People... ...Barriers Disable Them http://www.eramp.com/

Speaking strictly for myself, I don't see much use for the LONGDESC attribute where the frame element is concerned-- I've never found myself wanting such a description. 
I agree with David that the title attribute is more important, and it seems to me that all three of the tools mentioned-- IBM Home Page Reader, Window-Eyes, and JAWS-- do now support the title attribute for frames. 
So I think we're good there.

Ahhh Thanks. 
Boy - we should make a list of these. 
Decisions that we made based on what works rather than what we wished or thought best. 
Then at the end we can walk this carefully to be sure we are happy with these "until user agent" like decisions.
