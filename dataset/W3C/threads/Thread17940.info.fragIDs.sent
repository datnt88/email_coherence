<s> Hello, Checkpoints 4.13 and 4.14 of "Determining Conformance to the User Agent Guidelines 1.0" are: Checkpoint 4.13 Allow the user to configure how the selection is highlighted (e.g., foreground and background color).  </s>
<s> Checkpoint 4.14 Allow the user to configure how the content focus is highlighted (e.g., foreground and background color).  </s>
<s> I propose for both of these the following requirements: 1) The UA must allow for at least one highlight mechanism that doesn't rely on color alone.  </s>
<s> 2) The UA should follow applicable system conventions for selection and focus rendering.  </s>
<s> 3) The UA may satisfy this checkpoint by implementing the CSS ':focus' pseudo-element.  </s>

<s> 3. is not a requirement, it is a technique.  </s>
<s> An example of a mechanism that does not rely on colour is a border or underline.  </s>
<s> Otherwise, I agree.  </s>
