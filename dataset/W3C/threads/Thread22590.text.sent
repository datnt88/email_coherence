Note that the same result can usually be accomplished (in Java, at least) by declaring a new set of interfaces, in the new package, which inherit from and override/extend the standard DOM API. 
That avoids needing to copy/alter the existing W3C bindings, and makes the relationship between your subclass and the standard DOM explicit. 
Unfortunately not. 
You cannot load a subinterface without loading its superinterface(s), so they become part of the source of the program. 
No more so than the programming language's standard libraries. 
Those are used by the open source project, but not distributed with it nor claimed to be part of it. 
I would expect that shipping the DOM bindings separately would put them in the same category. 
However, I Am Not A Lawyer. Few (none?) of us are. 
They're the ones who will have to straighten this out. 
I move we table this discussion until the legal eagles have given us some facts to argue about... smile/ Joe Kesselman / IBM Research There are actually two copyright notices for use with W3C specifications; one for documents and the other for software and DTDs/schemas. 
The software notice is at One possibility is to use this, with the proviso that Java bindings not use the org.w3c.* package, and that (as John Cowan proposed) a comment is added that the modified binding does not conform to any W3C standard. 
Would this satisfy the needs of the open source community? 
Lauren Clearly yes. 
As a matter of form, a W3C staffer should post a message to license-discuss@opensource.org asking for OSI certification for the W3C software license.

-- Coleridge (tr. 
Politzer) I'll see who I can get to do this. 
At this stage, we 're discussing making the license be a mixture of the standard W3C software license, and the status of the DOM specification, which will probably look like 1) the specification (excluding the bindings) is covered by the W3C document license 2) the bindings are under the software license, with the additional conditions (also that IDL bindings have to change the pragma prefix) Lauren
