<s> Hello, These are quick comments for your "XQuery 1.0 and XPath 2.0 Data Model" [1] and "XQuery 1.0 and XPath 2.0 Functions and Operators" [2] Last Call Working Drafts.  </s>
<s> Overall they are beautifully done!  </s>
<s> Both specs appear to need a conformance section.  </s>
<s> Here is a thought in that direction.  </s>
<s> Functions and operators defines "must" and "may" in Terminology, and this is fine.  </s>
<s> I am more worried about the data model.  </s>
<s> It should say: The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].  </s>
<s> (from http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt)  </s>
<s> or, it should say what definitions are being used (e.g., dictionary definitions).  </s>
<s> It could also say why the RFC is not used.  </s>
<s> See the W3C Manual of Style for a markup suggestion (http://www.w3.org/2001/06/manual/#RFCs).  </s>
<s> At .99MB the functions and operators file is too large.  </s>
<s> It took more than a minute to load in Mac IE OS 9 and gave a read/write error trying to save the file to disk.  </s>
<s> I suggest breaking the spec into chapters, and then providing a single file (for print, for clicking within the document and for searching).  </s>
<s> Running the data model through Tidy with indent off would save 80-90k, or over 25%.  </s>
<s> For functions and operators, this Tidy setting saves 290k, again over 25%.  </s>
<s> Functions and operators seems to be using an old XMLspec stylesheet.  </s>
<s> This CSS rule was removed in August 2002 because of rendering problems (section F1 and some of the definitions are tough to read in Mac IE; screen shot on request).  </s>
<s> I suggest upgrading to a later XSLT.  </s>
<s> dt.label { display: run-in; } For both drafts, the title of a reference should be the link.  </s>
<s> For example:  </s>
<s> dd World Wide Web Consortium, em Namespaces in XML /em See a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml-names/" becomes something like this: dd World Wide Web Consortium, cite a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml-names/" Namespaces in  </s>
<s> XML /a /cite on-line at http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml-names.  </s>
<s> /dd  </s>
<s> The Manual of Style shows details for references markup (http://www.w3.org/2001/06/manual/#References).  </s>
<s> Generally, white space is two words.  </s>
<s> This applies to both drafts (see In section D of the data model, the green #00CB9C class .element is dark with black text.  </s>
<s> #85e9b1 instead (I am sure you can do better than my color picking) would give some contrast.  </s>
