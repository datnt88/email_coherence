<s> I'm writing in response to your L-Base documents [1] [2], which I understand are currently in draft form, perhaps on their way to W3C Note status.  </s>
<s> I've been working on precisely specifying the semantics of our "log" vocabulary [3], using essentially the same approach, which has led me to a few thoughts about your document.  </s>
<s> 1. Please specify a machine-readable and human-readable syntax In [1] you specify a syntax with single letter names and subscripts.  </s>
<s> We get the idea, but that's obviously not practical for machine processing (or sending in e-mail!).  </s>
<s> In [2] you're using an ascii syntax, but it's not the one in [1].  </s>
<s> What exactly is the syntax?  </s>
<s> Where is it defined?  </s>
<s> (More to the point: where are the implementations!?) I understand you considered using KIF.  </s>
<s> I'm using the formula syntax of otter [4].  </s>
<s> You could use TPTP's native format [5], although that's not very pretty.  </s>
<s> Otter's syntax is a lot like what you use in [2], except it uses "all" instead of "forall", and symbols like "&amp;" instead of "and".  </s>
<s> Examples: "all x y exists z (P(x,y,z) | Q(x,z))" and "all x (P(x) &amp; Q(x) &amp; R(x) - S(x))".  </s>
<s> It's plain FOL-with-equality (the way I use it at least), so you do need to say rdf(s,p,o) instead of p(s,o), but I consider that a good thing; it makes it more clear what's in L-Base and what's in RDF.  </s>
<s> I also use rdf_type instead of rdf:type, which otter would require be quoted.  </s>
<s> Anyway, it doesn't matter what syntax, but I think you do need some unambiguously parsable ascii syntax....  </s>
<s> You *could* use a layered RDF syntax for FOL, like McDermott et al [6] (I have a translator from one of them to otter, and plan to write a reverse translator shortly), but that would probably just confuse people at this stage.  </s>
<s> 2. I think it's important to have the text of the urirefs and literals available.  </s>
<s> I recognize this is not supported by the current MT, but I think that's a mistake.  </s>
<s> It's information that's available to applications and will be used; if we put it out of range of the formal semantics, then we leave it unnecessarily to the informal ones.  </s>
<s> My approach is to translate every RDF document to an L-Base WFF using only (1) existential variables, (2) the constants zero and emptyString, (3) the functions succ(), unicodeCharacter(), strCons(), and webDenotation(), and (4) the predicate rdf() as above.  </s>
<s> webDenotation() is the function mapping from strings to the things denoted by using those strings as urirefs.  </s>
<s> I've left out XML-literals, xml:lang, and unicode versioning issues for now.  </s>
<s> (There are of course, other, equivalent basic sets.  </s>
<s> Maybe one that didn't touch numbers would be better.) I believe this formalization allows RDF layered languages to have semantics involving the text of URIRefs, and of literals, while not breaking anything.  </s>
<s> It does increase complexity (for humans and machines), but it's probably worth it.  </s>
<s> For my purposes, some predicates that Tim B-L uses (eg log:racine) rely on it.  </s>
<s> Note that this formalization does not let you ask about "the" identifier for an object, but just about a string which might happen to be known to have its webDenotation be the object.  </s>
<s> And it certainly doesn't grant access to L-Base identifiers or anything.  </s>
<s> In any case, we need some way to convey the information that all RDF literals are pairwise not-equal.  </s>
<s> If you said how to do that, I missed it.  </s>
<s> Those are probably my two strong opinions.  </s>
<s> I mentioned in earlier e-mail that in some cases consistency of axioms may actually be provable, eg by finding a model.  </s>
<s> In general, I'm pretty happy &amp; optimistic about this approach, although axiomatizing some common vocabulary terms is very difficult.  </s>
<s> And I haven't a clue what to do with log:contents, which relates a URI with the strings you obtain by fetching it.  </s>
<s> I guess I'll be able to formally define (or at least constrain) it in terms of some network-operations ontology.  </s>
<s> Have you guys been thinking about how these semantics might be published, and even automatically retreived, from the namespace address (or elsewhere)?  </s>
<s> I guess my real question is this: I see how this stuff is very useful for getting logic layering right, but does it come into play at all with ontologies for buying books over the web, etc?  </s>
<s> I can see it fulfilling the same role as DAML+OIL or OWL there, sort of.  </s>
<s> Should it?  </s>
<s> Or is this really just an on-paper read-by-logicians kind of thing for you?  </s>

<s> It occured to me during that night that using webDenotation() and having access in L-Base to RDF's names for things allows a formal definition of rdf:_1, etc, too, at least its equivalence to a LISP-like structuring, and relationship to ordering predicates.  </s>

<s> Sando, Thank you for your comments.  </s>
<s> Here are some responses.  </s>
<s> 1.  </s>
<s> I completely agree with your request for an actual syntax.  </s>
<s> Any particular theorem prover will have to use a particular syntax and we should (eventually) define one.  </s>
<s> However, we are completely mortified at the possibility of this getting mistaken for yet another interchange format.  </s>
<s> Which is in part why the document uses non-ascii things like subscripts ... We want to get the message --- that this is a way of doing semantics, not exchanging pieces of data --- loud and clear.  </s>
<s> 2. Access to l-base names (such as urirefs).  </s>
<s> This too is an implementation level issue.  </s>
<s> I think.  </s>
<s> I think we (i.e., SWAD+RDF-IG) should try and build an implementation that addresses 1 &amp; 2. That will make it concrete.  </s>
<s> What do you think?  </s>
<s> thanks!  </s>
<s> guha  </s>
