Hi all, I am sending, at the bottom of this message, a short HTML file. 
When I open it with Amaya 7.1 (under Windows), what I get is Note:Note. 
with the first five characters in bold. 
However, I should also 
get a space between ":" and the second "N", and I do get it 
with Netscape or Internet Explorer. 
Best regards Jose Carlos Santos

Hi Jos? 
Carlos / Hola Jos? 
Carlos I don't believe that that effect is a " bug ", simply, how sense has that 
the space is marked as strong ? 
If you put the code in the following way you will obtain the wanted result: 
And I believe that that is the correct form of making it, because the space 
in any case will be something as important as to go marked as strong 
IN SPANISH 
No creo que ese efecto sea un "bug", simplemente, ?qu? sentido tiene que el espacio est? 
marcado como strong ? 
Si pones el c?digo de la siguiente manera obtendr?s 
el resultado deseado: Y creo que esa es la forma correcta de hacerlo, pues el espacio en ning?n caso ser? 
algo tan importante como para ir marcado como strong Regards / Saludos Emmanuelle Guti?rrez y Restrepo Coordinadora del SIDAR | Hi all, | I am sending, at the bottom of this message, a short HTML file.

If I type strong a b /strong then I get a space between "a" and "b". 
Why don't I get a space when I put a space just before /strong ? 
I do not see why this form is more correct than the one that I have posted. 
I also do not understand why do you say that, in your suggestion, the space "will be something as important as to go marked as strong ". 
Finally, and the most important aspect of this, according to the HTML rules the space should appear. 
Thanks, but I am portuguese.

Also, a strong space might be bigger than a regular one: some fonts get 
bigger when bolded.

Hi Jose Carlos and Juan: I don't really know why it happens that in Amaya, or better, why it happened, because today I have tried to reproduce it and I have not gotten it. 
But I believe that the element strong it is a structural markup and I 
don't believe that a space is structural information. 
I believe that if what 
is wanted is to include the space to obtain a certain presentation effect, it should use the element span in the following way: Best regards, Emmanuelle P.S.: Jose Carlos: Boas festas. 
Juan: Felices fiestas :-)

Emanuelle: Spaces are not structural. 
I only say that thay might have different sizes for the same font size if they are into a  strong or not. 
See the image: THere are no monotype spaces, but it's the same as all characters are the same size. 
The "[exe]" partr of the right list are not vertically alignes because some items are bolded. 
That's all. 
This is not a problem with Amaya. 
All browsers I use do the same. 
As I see it, it's a design problem of the font. 
Ssludos!

Emamanuelle is right. 
As long as there is no indication for preserving spaces, spaces and new lines just after the start tag and just before the end tag are ignored. 
So " strong a and b /strong " is equivalent to " strong a and b /strong ". 
In your case you have to put the space after the end tag. 
Happy new year Irene. 
I have not been following this thread very closely, so if I am off the mark please excuse me. 
Consider the following two cases: Case 1: strong a b /strong c strong a b /strong c Case 2: strong span style="font-size: 200%" a b /span /strong c strong span style="font-size: 200%" a b /span /strong c In Case 1 both examples yield the same result, while in Case 2 the space between the characters "b" and "c" is wider in the second example. 
Note that this is at variance with HTML 4.01 recommendation: "In order to avoid problems with SGML line break rules and inconsistencies among extant implementations, authors should not rely on user agents to render white space immediately after a start tag or immediately before an end tag."
