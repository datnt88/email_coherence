<s> Emanuelle: Spaces are not structural.  </s>
<s> I only say that thay might have different sizes for the same font size if they are into a  strong or not.  </s>
<s> See the image: THere are no monotype spaces, but it's the same as all characters are the same size.  </s>
<s> The "[exe]" partr of the right list are not vertically alignes because some items are bolded.  </s>
<s> That's all.  </s>
<s> This is not a problem with Amaya.  </s>
<s> All browsers I use do the same.  </s>
<s> As I see it, it's a design problem of the font.  </s>

<s> Emamanuelle is right.  </s>
<s> As long as there is no indication for preserving spaces, spaces and new lines just after the start tag and just before the end tag are ignored.  </s>
<s> So " strong a and b /strong " is equivalent to " strong a and b /strong ".  </s>
<s> In your case you have to put the space after the end tag.  </s>
<s> Happy new year Irene.  </s>
<s> I have not been following this thread very closely, so if I am off the mark please excuse me.  </s>
<s> Consider the following two cases: Case 1: strong a b /strong c strong a b /strong c Case 2: strong span style="font-size: 200%" a b /span /strong c strong span style="font-size: 200%" a b /span /strong c In Case 1 both examples yield the same result, while in Case 2 the space between the characters "b" and "c" is wider in the second example.  </s>
<s> Note that this is at variance with HTML 4.01 recommendation: "In order to avoid problems with SGML line break rules and inconsistencies among extant implementations, authors should not rely on user agents to render white space immediately after a start tag or immediately before an end tag."
