The Amaya team is proud to announce the Amaya pre-release 8.0-pre. 
As this release includes a lot of changes in the internal code, the Amaya team prefers to make a pre-release before providing the public release 8.0 next week. 
We hope many users will test this pre-release and will send us feedback to have a more robust 8.0 version. 
Binaries (Linux, Windows NT/2000/XP /9x/ME) are available at: Source is available at: Debian packages are available at: RPM packages (for Redhat 8.x) are available at 
This version includes new important features: 
- new Accessibility features like access keys in Windows versions 
- SVG transformation and SMIL animation in OpenGL and WinGL versions 
- Support of the CSS property float. 
- Insertion of MathML and SVG elements within XML documents - Integration of the new 0.95 version of the expat XML parser. 
+ several bug fixes 
For more details see Irene.

Woohoo! smile/ A couple of notes from my buglog/wishlist: 
3. Bug: Not all id are shown when "show target" is selected. 
For example, isn't showing the bullseye. 
4. Wish: bounce (increase/decrease) the nesting level of nested lists easily. 
5. Wish: A shortcut key for skipping/replacing+next in the spell checker so I don't have to rely upon the mouse and compex navigation to quickly move through the document. 
Perhaps one more comment: The New says "Amaya now allows to create/change a link without using the mouse." and now when I hit control-k, it *immediately* pops up a URL entry field, and I can't click on another amaya window to set the link. 
I presume I should hit the "click" button on the URL dialog and then click the target window, but that just reopens a blank url dialog? 
Also, in the documentation, I'm not sure what it means "in the first case" and "in the second case" . 
In order to reproduce the bug here, we need to know you os version (win9x, Nt, Linux Debian, Mandrake, Redhat), and if you're running the Amaya OpenGL version (if so, the 3d Card Vendor Name's could be useful).

Smile error, smile/ close tag not found ;-) 
to 
quickly move through the document. 
I need to peek at 8-pre but I vote for the same feature in search/replace too. 
In fact they both should be similar since they are both search-and-replace variants. 
So replace-and-search-next and a skip-and-search-next buttons are welcome.

Hello Joseph, Actually, the target icons were sometimes overloaded by the document style. 
It's fixed in the CVS version. 
Thanks for your report Laurent 
Your parser is defective. 
:) In XML (and XHTML) a tag ending in / is a standalone tag that requires no close tag: for example, hr/ . 
Cheers, Andrew 
Effectively, there is a problem in this case. 
It's worth having a pre-release. 
Thanks Laurent 
Thank you Joseph for having pointing this bug out. 
It is now fixed. 
Concerning the documentation, maybe it needs to be clearer. 
I'll have a look on it before the release Laurent Ps: I just read your message. 
I'm surprised and sad you are leaving the consortium. 
New bugs reports: 7. When I click on the S030 hypertext in this document (in "Introducing a Web Application Scenario": it opens the other document in a new window, but then resets my view to the top of the page in my current window! 
8. Can it open a new window in parallel? 
If the other window is slow to load it holds up all of my windows. 
Another bug, this one very annoying in a minor way: 9. I encounter many instances that when (a) the cursor is before the first letter of a next word and after a space and the preceding word (b) and I hit the delete key (c) not only does it delete the first letter of the next word, but the preceding space. 
For example, where the carrot "^" represents the cursor position: "foo ^bar" [hit delete] "foo^ar"

I made that test with Windows and Linux versions and the preceding space was not deleted. 
Could you send me the piece of HTML that shows this bug?

It's not any particular HTML, but something in the editor. 
I've noticed Steve Bratt grumbling about it too on IRC. 
But if you must have a piece of HTML, I've had the problem while working on:

What it changed in the 8.0 version is the better control of spaces in HTML documents. 
The goal is to avoid to display a space that will disappear as soon as the document is saved and reloaded. 
Perhaps I find the bug you wanted to report. 
If after a delete there are 2 adjacent spaces, Amaya removes the space at the left and not the space at the right. 
So if you continue to delete there is no longer space. 
I fixed this problem, but I'm not sure it's exactly the bug you reported. 
Irene.

Ok! I'll have to try it in the next release, for now sticking with 7.2 .
