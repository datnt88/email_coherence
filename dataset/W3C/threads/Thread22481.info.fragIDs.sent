<s> I've got my first implementation of the "live" version sketched.  </s>
<s> The optimizations are probably not going to do any good at all in the cases where its being live actually matters, but at least they don't add huge amounts of cost when it doesn't....  </s>
<s> One point isn't clear in the WD:  </s>
<s> If the Element on which this is invoked also has the desired tag name, is it included in the list?  </s>
<s> "Sub-tree of this element" could be read either way.  </s>
<s> I'm presuming not, but this should be nailed down more explicitly.  </s>
<s> "Returns a collection of all DESCENDANT Elements with a given tag name" Don Park  </s>
<s> Descendents: That's definitely better wording; thanks.  </s>
