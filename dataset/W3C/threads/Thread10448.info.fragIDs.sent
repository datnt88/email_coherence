Regarding issues: /2001/sw/RDFCore/20030123-issues/#pfps-21 PROPOSE, as suggested by Patrick 
That the term 'namespace' be used when referring specifically to an XML 
namespace, and that the term 'vocabulary' be used when referring to the set 
of URIREF's defined by RDF and RDFS.

This principle is fine with me, but I suggest an amendment that says we 
use the term "vocabulary" when we're referring to sets of URIrefs 
defined by anybody for use in RDF triples, e.g. I'd talk about "example.com's 
vocabulary" in the Primer (and in RDF/XML we use the XML namespace mechanism to construct those URIrefs).

Right. 
A vocabulary is just a set of terms used for a particular purpose, and different vocabularies can share common terms, just as e.g. PRISM includes both DC terms as well as its own, yet we speak of the PRISM vocabulary. 
A particular process, methodology, tool, etc. can define the vocabulary that is significant for it, taking terms from any number of namespaces, and can then refer to that vocabulary explicitly. 
See the attachements for an example of how I model these. 
Note that XML namespaces are completely irrelevant to the vocabulary model applied (as it should be ;-) This does bring up the question, since it seems that there is an overall RDF+RDFS vocabulary, which is defined by the single normative RDF schema, should we have a formal URI grounded in W3C space to denote that vocabulary, of which the RDF Syntax and RDF Schema subvocabularies are members? 
At present, I have to use a URI grounded in Nokia space to refer to that complete RDF+RDFS vocabulary. 
Cheers, Patrick 
Works for me. 
Noted for (probable) action.
