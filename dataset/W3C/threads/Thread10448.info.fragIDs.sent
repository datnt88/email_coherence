<s> Right.  </s>
<s> A vocabulary is just a set of terms used for a particular purpose, and different vocabularies can share common terms, just as e.g. PRISM includes both DC terms as well as its own, yet we speak of the PRISM vocabulary.  </s>
<s> A particular process, methodology, tool, etc. can define the vocabulary that is significant for it, taking terms from any number of namespaces, and can then refer to that vocabulary explicitly.  </s>
<s> See the attachements for an example of how I model these.  </s>
<s> Note that XML namespaces are completely irrelevant to the vocabulary model applied (as it should be ;-) This does bring up the question, since it seems that there is an overall RDF+RDFS vocabulary, which is defined by the single normative RDF schema, should we have a formal URI grounded in W3C space to denote that vocabulary, of which the RDF Syntax and RDF Schema subvocabularies are members?  </s>
<s> At present, I have to use a URI grounded in Nokia space to refer to that complete RDF+RDFS vocabulary.  </s>
