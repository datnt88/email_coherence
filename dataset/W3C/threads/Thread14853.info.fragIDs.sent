<s> Ten issues remain in their original state.  </s>
<s> I'm a bit unclear on the meaning of the acronym URI ... I originally assumed it meant URL, but have seen it used such that it suggests it may be the web site rather than the specific page address that can contain any equivalent versions ... This was under Elephant #11 ... and if it means that a URI is a web site (an address and it's subdirectories, etal) it will neatly suit meeting the needs of all disabled persons without having to draw a line anywhere ....  </s>

<s> Let's go to the latest rehash of the consensed items.? I believe that the one you are referring to is S1 - serving content in different forms is an acceptable way to comply with the guidelines as long as equivalents for all of the information are provided in the different forms and it is all available through the same URI?  </s>
<s> (though it may be linked to it)?  </s>
<s> (server side solutions are acceptable ?  </s>
<s> as specified) Here the extension to "somewhere on the same site" is by the parenthetical remark "though it may be linked to it."  </s>
<s> I had been interpreting the "from the same URI" in a strict sense and was preparing to object until this parenthetical remark sunk in.?  </s>
<s> There is a technique known as content negotiation in which a URL can get you different things depending on what you have set in your Accept: headers.?  </s>
<s> This give transparent access to alternatives.  </s>
<s> The point is that this level of transparency is not meant to be _required_ by the consensus, at least the way I read the way Gregg wrote it up.? If the alternative is not immediately at the same URL by transparent content negotiation, it is still conforming if the alternatives are easy to discover and navigate to, starting at that URL.? This implies that a root, home, or entry page where people are likeliest to start should be very broadly usable so that people can find their way from there to the section that is best for them.  </s>
<s> It's not quite true that being elsewhere on the same site is enough.?  </s>
<s> You have to have web-linked the site together enough, too.? But so long as the path to what you want is via well-greased skids through stuff you can use, then it's cool.  </s>
<s> On the technicalities, a URL is a URI, and saying 'a URI' doesn't somehow expand the reference to include the whole site.?  </s>
<s> There is no http://www.foo.bar/ http://www.foo.bar/* way to refer to the whole site as a URI.  </s>
<s> We should have a FAQ on "why do all the web specifications say URIs and all the  </s>
<s> pages contain URLs?"? Al  </s>

<s> [ log:uri [ log:startsWith http://example.org/  </s>
<s> ] ] .  </s>
<s> Not all that helpful in this context, perhaps...  </s>
<s> URL is becoming more and more of a deprecated term within the development community, and hopefully that will speard over into the "non-geek" world, although don't bet on it.  </s>
<s> For those still wondering what URIs and URLs are... Dan Connolly recently wrote a good piece on URIs, URI References, and all of the terminology:- - URI terminology demystified and there's more at the W3C's addressing site:- Hope that helps, Kindest Regards, Sean B.

<s> Anne Pemberton apembert@erols.com  </s>
<s> In general I am strongly in favour of using words understood by everyone, not just geeks.  </s>
<s> But there are cases where the terms most easily understood do not convey the meaning needed.  </s>
<s> "Home page" is a case in point - the part off the Web I work in has several different start pages, depending on what someone is doing.  </s>
<s> So no on e of them is the "home page" - there is the "AU group page", the "w3C home page", the "w3c technical reports page" and so on.  </s>
<s> In this case I would argue that using the term URL is wrong.  </s>
<s> In such cases, we are better off using the correct term, and explaining ourselves in the glossary.  </s>
<s> I realise that this probably comes from being deeply immersed in W3C culture, but there are sometimes deliberate decisions taken as to why W3C culture is the way it is.  </s>
<s> And this document is a W3C specification first and foremost.  </s>
