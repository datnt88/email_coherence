<s> You're right.  </s>
<s> There is a problem of notations that are not registered Mime-types, but they are not likely to interoperate well, anyway.  </s>
<s> Maybe we could _allow_ URLs instead of Mime-types (the : after the scheme name would disambiguate, no?) -- If and _only if_ there is no Mime-type available for a data format.  </s>
<s> Insofar as the notation labelling problem has been solved _anywhere_ Mime types are the solution.  </s>
<s> I will be _very_ surprised if anyone can find an argument _for_ URLs referencing some unknown resource, rather than a Mime-type -- especially when we are explicitly targeting the Web and HTTP.  </s>
