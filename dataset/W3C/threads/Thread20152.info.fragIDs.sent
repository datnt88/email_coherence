<s> The online help doesn't provide enough help for this:  </s>
<s> What is the precise format for specifying a remote (dial-up/ppp to ISP) file name to open, edit, and then save to?  </s>
<s> I can specify "http://www.sihope.com/~emaddox" to load my web page.  </s>
<s> I then edit it and save it to a _local_ file using "Save as...".  </s>
<s> But, I cannot figure out how to specify a remote file name to edit and/or save to directly.  </s>
<s> So far all I get is *** Thot: Irrecoverable error ***.  </s>

<s> I have been reading some of the manual.  </s>
<s> Not much help.  </s>
<s> But, the error messages now are:  </s>
<s> "404 Not Found The requested URL /usr/home/[...].html was not found on this server." - Is the server refered to the Local machine (where I am running Amaya) or the Remote ISP machine?  </s>
<s> - Why does the error message omit the "http://www.sihope.com"  </s>
<s> portion of the path even though I did include it?  </s>

<s> You need to have a server that supports the PUT method.  </s>

<s> The remote web server machine, which may be owned by the content provider or even on the content provider's premises.  </s>
<s> Because it is not transmitted in the HTTP request (at least for HTTP/1.0), as the destination server already knows its own name (actually some sorts of virtual server require this information, but it is sent separately from the URL, e.g.: GET /xxxxxx HTTP/1.1 Host: www.sihope.com but only relatively recent clients and servers use and understand Host headers.  </s>

<s> Amaya is able to load local files and remote files (http://....)  </s>
<s> Amaya doesn't add a default server name if you omit to put it into the URI.  </s>

<s> ^^^^ wrong.  </s>
<s> URI.  </s>
<s> You need to have a server that supports the PUT method.  </s>
<s> In that case the "Save" or "SaveAs" commands should work with an URL ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ a little more "precise", but still vague.  </s>
<s> And, first, Open doesn't yet work with exact path.  </s>
<s> It returns "404 Not Found", remember?  </s>
<s> Do some servers not support the GET method either?  </s>
<s> New development: I telnetted to my ISP.  </s>
<s> Started Lynx.  </s>
<s> Pressed "g".  </s>
<s> Entered: http://localhost/usr/home/....html.  </s>
<s> Got: 404 Not Found.  </s>
<s> Changed "http" to "file": file is displayed correctly.  </s>
<s> So even from my ISP's machine, with a different browser, I get the same error.  </s>
<s> I called my ISP.  </s>
<s> The tech is looking into what the precise format is that the http GET requires for specifying the precise path.  </s>
<s> Does the Amaya team know what precise format http GET expects so it _will_ find the file?  </s>
<s> Is it documented in an RFC or such?  </s>
<s> Or is there a different problem here?  </s>
<s> Or what?  </s>
