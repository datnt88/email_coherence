On behalf of the DOM Working Group, I am pleased to announce a coordination between the W3C and NIST to develop the DOM Conformance Test Suites. 
This development will be entirely public. 
It will produce a DOM Level 1 Test Suite (based on the NIST DOM Test Suite) and a DOM Level 2 Test Suite. 
The DOM Level 3 Test Suite will be addressed after the publication of the DOM Level 3 Candidate Recommendation. 
Dimitris Dimitriadis will be the contact for the W3C DOM Working Group, and Mary Brady will be the contact for NIST. 
Both of them will participate to the Workshop on Quality Assurance [1]. 
We welcome the participation of interested parties in developing the DOM Conformance Test Suites. 
The DOM Conformance Test Suites Process Document is now available: If you want to participate or send comments, please use the DOM TS mailing list www-dom-ts@w3.org or see the archive: Bests Regards, Philippe.

Philippe Le Hegaret - http://www.w3.org/People/LeHegaret/ World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), DOM Activity Lead Why is the DOM working group waiting for the CR to develop a test suite for DOM Level 3? Don't you think it could be valuable to work on the test suite now? 
Thierry. 
Who said the DOM Working Group will wait to develop a test suite for DOM Level 3? My message was only about the DOM Conformance work, not the DOM Working Group.
