Members will be aware that by far the majority of the w3c site is text based. 
For non readers with cognitive disability, it comes close to being a paradigm or inaccessability. 
I wish to draw the attention of all of you to this deficit. 
The code for a(ny) site is textual and essential, however if we all had to read and understand this before visiting a site, no one would bother. 
Could we please try to demonstrate by example before explaining the method. 
This system has a very ancient precedent QED. 
quad erat demonstrandum, or what was to be shown. 
Two examples of the problems that will occur presently, 1 Recently there was a request for information on colour, to attempt to define this with words is derisable. 
It is difficult enough to penetrate the methods used by experts. 2 I have been asked offline to help identify games sites that are w3c accessible. 
I consider this to be virtually impossible, however without specific examples it is nonsense. 
first demonstrate what you wish then explain. 
W3C desperately needs to simplify its goals and practice what it is preaching.

Yes, everyone should be able to _access_ the information, and there should be a guarantee of _that_, but I cannot stomach the idea that it is _my_ obligation to make _every_ piece of information "understandable" in a way that is obvious to someone with a learning disability. 
Kynn, you haven't "accessed" information until you can "understand" it. 
Anything less, isn't "access", it's an approximation. 
Anne, Demonstrate, please, how to express the following concept so that a child, someone with cognitive disabilities, and someone with a low IQ can understand it sufficiently that you would label it as "accessible", WITHOUT changing the very specific detail required of a technical specification: (the following is a real passage from a book I'm currently working on. 
It is *already* prose vs. the EBNF declaration that is the primary resource for such information) So far, our element declarations have dealt with sub-elements that must occur; that is, none have been optional, nor have they explicitly been able to occur more than once. 
In order to indicate a sub-element's optional or recurring status, you need to add an occurrence indicator to the element declaration. 
Occurrence indicators are single character symbols that appear immediately after the generic identifier name or sequence of names. 
For instance, if we chose to make the nuts in our ice-cream sundae element optional, we would write: The ? 
symbol in this declaration indicates that the sub-element is optional, and may occur zero or 1 times within the parent element. 
Until the *how* is demonstrated, the reaction you're going to get from web developers is "gee, that's well intentioned, but naive/unreasonable". 
The reality for this example may be the same as that initial reaction. 
Note that this exercise doesn't even begin to address the issue of why a child needs to understand occurance indicators within element declarations in an XML DTD, or why a technical discussion is obligated to make such information "understandable" by anyone who may come across it. 
Ann An attempt (I'm really too tired to do this justice, and not skilled enough, but I believe that it can be done. 
When we make something, there are things it has to have. 
This is what we have done so far. 
We can also make something with things that it might have. 
We have to show which things have to be there, and which are the things that might be there. 
We can do this with a marker like "?". 
In this example of a sundae, icecream and whipped cream have to be there. 
The fudge and caramel are in brackets "(" and ")" We have to have something that is in the brackets. 
But because there is the marker "|" between them, we know that we can choose which one we want. 
But we can have nuts, or not have nuts. the "?" marker with the nuts lets us know that it is something we can have but don't have to. 
( I have assumed from the context that the general notation had already been explained, and that I have understood it more or less correctly. 
I wrote that straight off in two minutes as an immediate reply. 
It is clearly possible to increaase the accessibility of such a concept dramatically. 
It seems that there is a continuum of accessibility in this area as in others. 
We should be aiming to capture as much of that continuum as possible, and the factors that influence our decision will include our own ability, the cost of providing the benefit, and our own perception of the audience. 
Two of these factors rely on us to make the effort to know better, and one of them is an external constraint on how much we are prepared to do, both in learning and in carrying out the necessary tasks. 
I feel that there is a mutual obligation. 
Those of us who claim to know about accessibility, and to provide skills in this area, are obliged to refine and further our skills. 
Those of us who have expertise, particularly in an area where that expertise seems rare, or the necessity for it seems poorly understood, need to spread that expertise. 
There are clearly strategies which can be used to improve the accessibility of a website to people with cognitive disabilities - the use of illustrative images, language which is as clear and simple as possible in the circumstances, the addition of multimedia presentations which reduce reliance on text as the only method of communication, all have a part to play. 
Likewise, the use of images and sounds as an aid to accessibility needs to be handled with care to ensure that it does not get in the way of accessibility for some other group. 
Again I would draw attenetion to the needs of people who are deaf - sound is not particularly cvaluable to them, but images and movement are, since many of them are "illiterate" in their primary sign language and therefore have to learn a second language represented in abstract symbols without the benefit of having learned how to use abstract static symbols. 
Having worked 40 hours straight, I apologise if I am not even less clear than normal.

Ann --Charles McCathieNevile mailto:charles@w3.org 
W3C Web Accessibility Initiative http://www.w3.org/WAI MIT/LCS - 545 Technology sq., Cambridge MA, 02139, USA This seems rather a bizaare choice of topic however most greasy chips of that I have ever seen illstrate the options, and bar 'burger king' the options are severely limited and do not require a PHD , mathematical notation or extensive philosophy to understand. 
if Charles is right I estimate 4 illustrations would be sufficient. 
Very often it is better programming practice to explicitly state the options, rather than include a formula. 
especially if there are limited options. 
This much is common knowledge.

[jonathan chetwynd] I think, though I'm not sure, that you're responding to Charles and Ann's discussion about The point of the discussion here was *not* about building sundaes, but about XML DTDs, using a hypothetical sundae markup language as an example. 
The question is how can (or even should) this be made understandable to the cognitively impaired. 
Illustrations will not suffice, because the purpose of the discussion is to teach someone how and when to type less-than exclamation E L E M E N T space [some element type name] space [some specialized syntax for the content of that element type]. 
Charles did a pretty good job of simplifying the discussion, but at the cost of omitting key terms that are necessary for communicating about the concept outside the scope of that particular discourse.

It will be very hard to justify how the addition of alt tags effects the getting of the content, it plainly does not. 
It provides a decision or point of choice between two different contents. 
It is a means of enabling understanding for 2 valuable groups, or 4 if you prefer. 
those who like/dislike pictures and those who's browsers accept/don't accept pictures. 
if someone selects the sundae or sundaes they prefer, it is the responsibility of the authoring interface to ensure that they receive their choice. 
They do not need to understand the process. 
We could discuss the necessity of semantic space in constructing a paragraph, but it has very little bearing on the topic. 
Non readers are having a hard time accessing the www. 
They do not have the resources that the blind have, and are further incapacitated by rarely providing their own income stream. 
However you cut it they are not well served.
