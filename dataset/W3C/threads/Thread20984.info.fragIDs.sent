<s> Hello, I?m using Windows 2000 (SP3) I?ve tried the four versions available: Snapshot 8.2+ (Windows NT/2000/XP) (get by http) Snapshot 8.2+ (Windows NT/2000/XP) (get by ftp) Release 8.2 (Windows NT/2000/XP) (get by http) Release 8.2 (Windows NT/2000/XP) (get by ftp)  </s>
<s> I?ve also tried Release 8.2 (Windows 98/ME) (get by http) Release 8.2 (Windows 98/ME) (get by ftp) I?ve uninstalled every time, before re-installing.  </s>
<s> Always to the same results, a dialog box: Title: ?Error?  </s>
<s> Message: ?Indent?  </s>
<s> Button(s): ?OK? None of the six installers gave any errors, so a corrupted download, as Irene suggested (http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-amaya/2003OctDec/0163.html), is excluded.  </s>
<s> Trying to find out from where the problem comes, I?ve also tried: ?amaya-WinNT-8.0.exe?  </s>
<s> ?amaya-WinNT-6.0.exe?  </s>
<s> ?amaya-WinNT-7.0.exe?  </s>
<s> ?amaya-WinNT-7.2a.exe?  </s>
<s> ?amaya-WinNT-8.0-pre.exe?  </s>
<s> ?amaya-WinNT-8.0.exe?  </s>
<s> gives the same results ... But the ?amaya-WinNT-6.0.exe?  </s>
<s> up to the ?amaya-WinNT-8.0-pre.exe?  </s>
<s> ... are working ... at least from this point of view.  </s>
<s> Two reasons for this problem come to my mind: 1. Something (very important) changed between the 8.0-pre and 8.0 version.  </s>
<s> 2. Something (also very important) changed in Service Pack 3 (Windows 2000), which is (more or less) considered as the equivalent of Service Pack 1 (Windows XP).  </s>
<s> Maybe Mark Daly (from the pre-cited post) could confirm if he is running on Windows XP (SP1).  </s>
<s> One, or both of them ?  </s>
<s> could be the cause of this problem.  </s>
<s> Greetings.  </s>
<s> Looking forward to test this 8.0-pre version I?ve got ... :)  </s>
<s> On a side note: the installer/uninstaller from ?Snapshot 8.2+?  </s>
<s> fails for an unknown reason to delete the folder where Amaya was installed (no files are present in this folder).  </s>

<s> It could be a problem with the amaya user path: $HOMEDRIVE\$HOMEPATH\amaya by default c:\Documents and Settings\$user_name\amaya  </s>
<s> Could you just try to force another user path by defining the environment variable AMAYA_USER_HOME?  </s>
<s> It could be due to a running application that keeps open this folder.  </s>

<s> I've tried your suggestion ... and it did work ... Thanks.  </s>
<s> Unfortunately, I can't tell if that was the thing that solved the problem, since un-installing/deleting the $AMAYA_USER_HOME variable/restarting/re-installing ... didn't bring back the old behavior (the Indent error).  </s>
<s> So, I currently have the 8.3+ version (without the $AMAYA_USER_HOME variable set) and with the conditions described below.  </s>
<s> The concatenation of $HOMEDRIVE and $HOMEPATH was pointing (and still does points) to a read-only directory (which I use for storing important files that I don't want being modified).  </s>
<s> Even if I'm still not sure which was the solution for this problem (your suggestion or the installation of version 8.3+ after 8.0-pre) ... I hope this could help others, which will encounter the same problem.  </s>
