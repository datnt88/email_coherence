--Frank Frank Manola The MITRE Corporation 202 Burlington Road, MS A345 Bedford, MA 01730-1420 Now that the RDF Core Working group has started its activities, the "joint committee" who has designed DAML+OIL has written a document that describes which areas of RDF and RDF Schema need attention based on our experiences with defining DAML+OIL as an extension of RDF Schema. 
You can find the document at On behalf of the "joint committee", Frank van Harmelen. 
Frank.van.Harmelen@cs.vu.nl http://www.cs.vu.nl/~frankh Department of AI, Faculty of Sciences, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam de Boelelaan 1081a, 1081HV Amsterdam, The Netherlands Abstract: This document describes which areas of RDF and RDF Schema need attention based on our experiences with defining DAML+OIL as an extension of RDF Schema. 
It is input from the DAML+OIL Joint Committee to the RDF Core working group. 
Contents: what does DAML+OIL depend on from RDF(S) RDF triple structure RDF Schema constructions what does DAML+OIL not use at all reification containers meta-classes what changes does DAML+OIL require in RDF(S) multiple domains with intersection semantics multiple ranges with intersection semantics cycles in subclass- and subproperty-hierarchies what areas of RDF(S) problematic syntax normalisation datatypes scoping layering Syntax of URIs: Semantics of URIs: Hi Frank, I had been hoping to have Danbri around when we discussed this and he won't be there tomorrow, but you are right - it would be better not to waste time. 
We will make time for this in tomorrow's agenda. 
Brian Brian-- I don't have a problem with not spending a whole lot of time discussing this (or at least its technical content) tomorrow. 
I just want to make sure we "officially receive it" and (hopefully) make some sort of decision on how we're going to deal with the technical issues (even if that's only an action item for future work).
