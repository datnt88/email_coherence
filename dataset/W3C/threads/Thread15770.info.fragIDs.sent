<s> I would like to caution WAI list members regarding a bug I have recently discovered about Bobby.  </s>
<s> I use a "direct" link to Bobby to check my pages.  </s>
<s> Under my little Bobby logo button graphic is something like: A HREF="http://udl.cast.org/bobby?URL=www.dors.state.md.us/locations.html" title="CAST: Bobby" Sure, this link brings up the sweetly brief (old style) "Bobby Approved" page (which is, after all, what I _wanted_ to happen -- grin), but Bobby does not actually examine the page!  </s>
<s> You may also have this problem if you are using an old bookmarks to automatically proof your pages.  </s>
<s> Direct links to really poorly designed sites are also "Bobby Approved".  </s>
<s> Try surfing to a notorious offender like the New York Times using this technique: In their defense, nowhere does CAST suggest the possibility of access Bobby directly in this way.  </s>
<s> The fix is easy enough, simply add "&amp;browser=AccEval" to the end of the "direct" link.  </s>
<s> For the record, this trick did work fairly recently (even after CAST first implemented the WAI April recommendations).  </s>
<s> I am not sure when this "broke", but it probably has been a few months.  </s>
<s> This technique is actually recommended by the W3C for using their validation service, so I can't claim to be clever for thinking of it.  </s>
<s> This kind of Bobby (ab)use will probably be valid again in the near future.  </s>
<s> For now, if you are using this technique, that Bobby Approved rating may be an accident!  </s>
<s> One problem with wonderful tools is that they are used in ways their inventor may never have considered...  </s>
<s> &amp;#@%! Sorry about the formatting of my last post.  </s>
<s> I just "upgraded" my version of communicator...  </s>
<s> This message might be as bad! -- Bruce  </s>
<s> simply add "&amp;browser=AccEval" to the end of the "direct" link.  </s>
<s> Actually, you need to add "&amp;amp;browser=AccEval" if you want your page to remain valid HTML; otherwise SGML parsers will think you're referring to a nonexistant &amp;browser; entity.  </s>
