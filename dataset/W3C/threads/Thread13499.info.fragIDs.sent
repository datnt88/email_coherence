<s> Wendy Chisholm Regrets Len Kasday EARL details and timeline CR No way to report, just current interface.  </s>
<s> However, store in XML answers to questions, such as is this table used for layout or not, alt-text for images, etc. WC When fit into A-prompt?  </s>
<s> CR Have to get out of chaos mode.  </s>
<s> At least a couple of weeks.  </s>
<s> WC How about you Sean? SP can do #4 with CWN.  </s>
<s> WC EARL propery details?  </s>
<s> SP Good.  </s>
<s> DD need experience.  </s>
<s> Martin Duerst already wrote about negotiation.  </s>
<s> WC Any steps missing in the timeline?  </s>
<s> DD If people don't have big comments on vocabulary, let's use a notation, RDF is fine.  </s>
<s> Let's take example in message and write in notation.  </s>
<s> WC How long to go through timeline?  </s>
<s> DD Don't know.  </s>
<s> Who implement?  </s>
<s> How long w/in working group vs. outside.  </s>
<s> WC Cool if HTML validator output EARL.  </s>
<s> DD Talk about at QA workshop.  </s>
<s> At some point out of ERT and managed by QA. WL Will there be something talked about at the QA thing?  </s>
<s> DD Yes, on the agenda.  </s>
<s> We'll get feedback from people who have done this.  </s>
<s> Find out who willing to use in test suite.  </s>
<s> WL Doesn't make sense for those who are just listening to say anything about timeline, since other people doing it.  </s>
<s> DD We can do the first few steps.  </s>
<s> This WG is experimenting with the stuff, EARL will have QA life of own.  </s>
<s> WC Iterative vocabulary development happen in QA? DD Depends.  </s>
<s> WC I would like to see ERT WG developing rule sets for WCAG, UAAG, and ATAG perhaps also 508.  </s>
<s> so that people implementing language have something to refer to.  </s>
<s> DD Have to find way to specialize the language.  </s>
<s> Other people do the same.  </s>
<s> We're at the beginning we need people to generate the output for various scenarios.  </s>
<s> WC Mentioned SVG test suitE?  </s>
<s> DD Set up a principle that we make it as generic as possible so we don't run into diverging versions.  </s>
<s> If we need to express something in semantics specific to WCAG that can not be done generically, then branch out.  </s>
<s> Start with what we have.  </s>
<s> WC action?  </s>
<s> Action SP: express what we have in N3. WC DD, get NIST people committed to implementing?  </s>
<s> DD yes.  </s>
<s> QA activity is to write guidelines for test suites.  </s>
<s> EARL output will be one item of the checklist.  </s>
<s> The NIST people probably be first to produce.  </s>
<s> They do so many test suites for W3C, so probably do that.  </s>
<s> WC Way to involve more people in list discussions?  </s>
<s> CR still pretty theoretical.  </s>
<s> If you can have a practical application, more people will be interested.  </s>
<s> WC Other thoughts?  </s>
<s> DD In experiments, see if this model can express that same person runs 100 tests on the same resource.  </s>
<s> If a tool, maybe same test over several pieces of a resource.  </s>
<s> Not sure how to express at this level of abstraction.  </s>
<s> Once have notation, see how it works.  </s>
<s> CR Any one going to WWW10?  </s>
<s> DD and WC - yes.  </s>
