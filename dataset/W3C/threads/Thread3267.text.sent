Hi, Something that could be very useful for Web developers would be to have Implementation Report of Open source software. 
I would like to know if people have ideas to organize that and in which fora. 
The test suites are often available, we just need tables for each open source products. 
In the QA Matrix [1], we can find links to already existing Test Suite, like the ones made by the CSS WG (Tantek, Ian, and Co) + Should we invite the Web community to test the softwares? 
+ Should we encouraged the Open Source community to do it themselves giving them a few recommendations. 
+ Where should it be hosted? 
+ Should we use EARL [2] or not? 
Ideas? 
Examples of Implementation Report: VoiceXML UAAG 1.0 DOM HTML Level 2 OWL SVG XForms Basic 1.0 RDF Core etc. [1] http://www.w3.org/QA/TheMatrix [2] http://www.w3.org/TR/EARL10/ Karl Dubost - http://www.w3.org/People/karl/ W3C Conformance Manager *** Be Strict To Be Cool *** Check out the CSS Test page for more: e.g. the Selectors Test Suite Implementation Report Template http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/CSS3/Selectors/current/implementreportTEMP LATE.html and instructions for filling out: The CSS WG has completed a few implementation reports for current implementations yet I didn't see them linked from the test page. 
Perhaps they'll show up eventually. 
Note the focus on features rather than assertions. 
Assertions are nice for thoroughness (as are reports on individual test cases), but quite meaningless to most folks unless they are aggregated into features, and clear communication of whether or not implementations support each feature of a specification.

You may want to get in touch with Peter Schonefeld and the SVG Foundation who are currently producing a way to make it easier for the implementation report of SVG more accessible to producers and less burdensome on the WG. We've also evangelised the KSVG people into providing a review of KSVG when it's released, and that should be there. 
I think it's a very good idea to encourage the community to do this, especially if we can provide an automated method Jim. 
Thank you Tantek and Jim. 
I think I will try to gather the information at least under the form of links.
