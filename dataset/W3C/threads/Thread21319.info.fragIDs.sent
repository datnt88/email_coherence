<s> Subject: Proposed Framework Text for F2F (was RE: TBTF: In-context Framework Intro.) Importance: High Hi Noah et. al, The wires that connect HP and Lotus must be very narrow... it took 2hrs 10mins to get here!  </s>
<s> Fortunately I saw Highland's question in response much earlier which contained your various suggestions.  </s>
<s> I was on the brink of making an almost identically worded insert to:  </s>
<s> MEPs are considered to be a type of feature; unless  </s>
<s> otherwise stated, references to the term "feature" apply also to MEPs. at exactly the same point in the document... so that was reassuring!  </s>
<s> Unfortunately, I have not seen your response to Highlands question, which may have been a simple 'yes' or it may have been a revision to the Ed Note (in which case I have not changed it from your original suggestion).  </s>
<s> I've attached HTML and DOC versions of the revisions I've applied and a diff version from Henriks previous version to speed review.  </s>
<s> The main piece that has given perhaps needs more careful review is the following change: original_version As described above, SOAP can be augmented with optional features (such as reliable message delivery) and with new Message Exchange Patterns (request/response, multicast, etc.).  </s>
<s> The specification of each such MEP or feature MUST include the following: 1.The information (state) required at each node to implement the MEP or feature.  </s>
<s> 2.The processing required at each node in order to fulfill the obligations of the MEP or feature.  </s>
<s> 3.The information transmitted from node to node, and in the case of MEPs, any requirements to generate additional messages (such as responses to requests in a request/response MEP).  </s>
<s> Every binding specification MUST support the transmission and processing of one-way messages as described in this specification.  </s>
<s> A binding specification MAY state that it supports additional MEPs and/or features, in which case the binding specification MUST provide for maintaining state, performing processing, and transmitting information in a manner consistent with the specification for those MEPs and features.  </s>

<s> How  </s>
<s> about: (this is to follow the para reading) "It is up to the communicating nodes to decide how best to express particular features and MEPs; often when a binding-level implementation for a particular feature is available, utilizing it when appropriate will provide for optimized processing."  </s>
<s> Editors note: there is still some disagreement as to how best to represent the balance of responsibility between binding specifications in particular, vs. other software at the SOAP node, when dealing with features that are represented entirely within the SOAP envelope.  </s>

<s> Subject: RE: Proposed Framework Text for F2F (was RE: TBTF: In-context Framework Intro.)

<s> It is up to the communicating nodes to decide how best to express particular features and MEPs; often when a binding-level implementation for a particular feature is available, utilizing it when appropriate will provide for optimized processing."  </s>
<s> Futhermore, isn't the ednote addressed at this text and not at the bottom paragraph?  </s>
<s> Shouldn't the ednote be place after the text above?  </s>
<s> Henrik Frystyk Nielsen  </s>
<s> Folks, Sorry to be dumping this all in your in-trays... hopefully a third and final version.  </s>
<s> The merging of the two paragraphs that Henrik noticed required a slight tweak to Noah's ednote to refer to a single paragraph above rather than two.  </s>
<s> Changes are: merged paragraphs and tweak to the ednote.  </s>
