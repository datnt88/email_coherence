I don't like to interrupt the standardization going on in this group, but I've grown increasingly frustrated that people with otherwise very respectable opinions seem to "outgrow" the idea that names and addresses should be kept separate. 
Why? 
I like the distinction between names and addresses. 
While URIs are generally considered opaque, I think one should at least be able to see on a scheme name what is supposed to happen when you activate/use the URI. 
Consequently, I don't like seeing "http" being used for other things than addresses to resources that are retrievable from a web (HTTP) server. 
I'm using addresses for things that are network retrievable, and names for things that are not. 
From my point of view, there is never a need to resolve a name. 
Names are useful to make sure two programs are talking about the same things. 
Addresses are useful to fetch resources. 
I think these are two separate problems. 
Names have good use in ontologies. 
Fetching resourses is an entirely different matter. 
My world may be small, but this view is crystal clear to me. 
What are the counter-arguments? 
Gustaf I think that the distinction of being a name or an address is not a property of any particular label-token, but a consequence of how it is used. 
I think it's fairly clear that any (unambiguous) address *can be used* as a name. 
I also think that, given an appropriate infrastructure, any name can be used as an address. 
Whatever the standards community may decree, users will not feel constrained not to use the labels we provide -- URIs -- in any way that seems convenient to their purpose. 
So while naming and addressing may be separate problems, I don't think we can insist that they use disjoint sets of tokens. 
#g Graham Klyne be infrastructure, may provide -- I think the foundation work was John Shoch: "Internetwork naming, addressing and routing.", 
Proceedings, COMPCON, IEEE Computer Society, Fall 1979. 
I can't find an earlier reference. 
The architectural concept of separating naming, addressing and routing as separate network functions has been a strong foundation for the Internet. 
It does seem that we're using the words with slightly different meanings, but the distinctions hold and are important in most of the Internet architecture. 
we Just because it is possible to use a name as an address and vice versa doesn't mean that it is a good idea, or that IETF or W3C should adopt a policy of not distinguishing between the two or encouraging registration of namespaces where the primary definitional role isn't clear. 
This isn't a constraint on USERS (who can attempt to do whatever they like with their URIs) but can easily be a constraint on those who wish to get their namespaces inscribed in IANAs hallowed rolls. 
Let us imagine a policy where namespaces that have (interesting, useful) operational definitions get to be registered as URI schemes, namespaces that have a definition which establishes a (possibly delegated) naming authority / registration mechanism get to be registered as URN namespaces... ... and namespaces that have neither get to be debated endlessly on uri@w3.org, until the definers give up or else fit their schemes into one of the two camps. 
Larry Allowing for the plausibility of the concept of URN (which becomes somewhat problematic if the concept of URL is suddenly deprecated), then it must be asserted that URN could be applied to multiple URI schemes and not just pegged to a single URI scheme that so happens to call itself 'urn'. 
That would be to introduce a point of gross non-uniformity into a system of resource identification that champions its uniformity. 
However, my personal view is that while I understand that the IANA would like to keep everything nice and tidy and ship-shape and to distinguish names from addresses, the reality is quite simply otherwise. 
The horse has truly bolted (and been gone some time now I might add). 
It would appear to be too late to retrofit these conceptual categorizations onto the URI continuum. 
RDF and XML Namespaces, as two URI applications among others, have fully put paid to that. 
There is also a view that the 'cost of introduction of new URI schemes is high'. 
I would take exception with this, and note that this view presumably arises from the common expectation that URI schemes are necessarily dereferencable and that transport protocols need to be supported. 
This is not the case. 
The 'info' URI scheme, for one, expressly excludes dereference for simplicity's sake. 
So what cost then to a URI processor? 
If it is aware of certain URI schemes and the operations that can be performed upon those URIs (e.g. retrieval), then fine. 
Otherwise it can profitably recognize a URI for what it is in a given URI context and reliably use that for identity purposes. 
There is another aspect to this. 
Are the number of URN namespaces to be likewise restricted? 
Or can they be allowed to multiply since evidently they are apparently not 'interesting' or 'useful'. 
In short, are such namespaces to be considered the lumpenproletariat of the URI world? 
By 'give up' I expect this is intended to refer to registration under the IANA. 
The authors of the 'info' URI scheme already have existing applications that will make good use of the 'info' URI scheme and have no intention to 'give up'. 
(I assume BTW that the 'two camps' reference is to 'urn' URIs and not-'urn' URIs. 
Bit of an odd carve-up of the URI terrain. 
But that's just a personal opinion.) Tony Tony Hammond Advanced Technology Group, Elsevier 32 Jamestown Road, London NW1 7BY, UK I'm concerned about the way this conversation is going at the moment, and I'd like us all to step back from the fray a bit. 
We all recognize the value of the overall URI framework, and I believe we all are working to ensure that it continues to develop. 
Let's not be confused by differences in strategy into believing that we have different goals. 
thanks, Ted Hardie
