Hy, I'm trying to open a LMML document with Amaya, but the layout is strange. 
There is not the titles, no itemize and a lot of other things. 
Why? 
The LMML site say that many of the XML-editors currently on the market support the LMML format. 
Amaya not? 
Thanks, Francesca Specisci e ricevi le tue email Hotmail dal tuo cellulare con: On Mon, 07 Oct 2002 09:09:29 +0000 Could you give us the URI that causes the trouble? 
Irene. 
I did not check with any particular LMML document, but I guess that the problem is that there is no CSS style sheet linked from the LMML document. 
Except for a few languages such as XHTML, MathML and SVG, Amaya does not know about formatting of XML documents. 
It relies on CSS style sheets to format and display those documents. 
It does not support XSL. 
So, if you use an XSL style sheet, Amaya does not do anything with it.

Here is the thread of the discussion we had on this topic last monday, discussion begun on the annotation mailing list. 
market Thanks for the examples. 
Amaya doesn't valid xml documents, it verifies 'only' their well-formedness, builds a DOM-tree that corresponds to the source document ans displays the content of the elements in the formatted-view. 
You can associate xml style-sheet to improve the display (as it is made in your document) but for the moment, Amaya supports only css style-sheets, not xsl ones. 
It's the reason why the layout of your documents looks 'strange'. 
Regards Laurent
