is an attempt to persuade marketers to take accessibility into account. 
While it is a good try, I feel that it won't really hit the target (perhaps inevitable in a one-page overview). 
Bobby is the only testing tool mentioned - without any qualifications on its use - and this para: 
Design, look, and feel will tend toward simplicity with clear navigation, straightforward page structures, and easily readable text. 
However, this doesn't necessarily impose limitations on visuals or brand identity, nor does it preclude use of rich media. 
Well-designed graphics and multimedia elements, judiciously applied and clearly signposted, can be a positive aid to using and understanding Web sites 
will probably be skimmed and taken, by many, as saying accessible web sites are boring to look at. 
(It doesn't, of course, but the first phrase will cause some eyes to glaze over.) 
Seek out usability experts, and request guidance from national disability institutions, especially those representing the blind and partially sighted 
- why the latter qualification?

Because, and is evidanced here many times, accessibility = screen readers. 
Why, is this? 
Do we send the wrong message by using screen readers as the 
first, and many times, only example of why pages may be inaccessible?

I often come across the misconception: accessibility = catering for the "blind guy in the corner there". 
Of course we need to expand our examples when talking about accessibility. 
In the vein of the quaint shock tactic of taking away a user's mouse and asking them to navigate the site, I often turn people's speakers off and direct them to their wonderful corporate video section on their site - which is sorely lacking transcripts, captions, etc. 
I might be wrong, but I think part of the problem is also that - from what I've seen, anyway - organisations such as the RNIB are the most vocal when it comes to banging the drum of accessibility...thus further strengthening the perception that it's all about catering for visually impaired visitors. 
Maybe part of the solution would be for other orgs, like the RNID, to speak up more with regards to access needs of the particular group they represent.

Yes but I meant more that screen readers are the only thing that we need to be able to support with accessible code. 
Not necessarily that it is for the blind guy. 
But you show what I mean in your next para. 
I like these tactics.... Nothing drives the point home then being able to demonstrate the problems first hand. 
An interesting point here. 
I wonder if the lack of support for captions is because of the closed nature of the deaf community? 
And I puttering around on here because I cant sleep tonight.
