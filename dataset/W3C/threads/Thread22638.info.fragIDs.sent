<s> The DOM2 Traversal spec defines very well what should happen if the currentNode of a nodeIterator or treeWalker is moved in a document or out from it.  </s>
<s> However what should happen if the root node is moved in the tree?  </s>
<s> The problem applies for the root node of both nodeIterator and treeWalker.  </s>
<s> For a nodeIterator the root node is always an ancestor of the current node so both the root node and currentNode could be left unaffected.  </s>
<s> However this requires special handling of currentNode since this is not how it is normally handled when it's moved out from the tree.  </s>
<s> Otherwise similar logic could be applied to the root node as is applied to the currentNode.  </s>
<s> For the treeWalker the current node is not neccecairly a decendant of the rootnode, but it seems to follow the spirit of that interface if rootnode is unchanged even if moved in the tree.  </s>
<s> Any way this needs to be defined.  </s>

<s> Or the root's ancestor.  </s>
<s> The answer in either case is basically "nothing happens."  </s>
<s> NodeIterator operates only within, and upon, the root node's subtree.  </s>
<s> Moving the root has no effect on the structure of the subtree, and hence has no effect upon iteration.  </s>
<s> TreeWalker operates as pure-current-node semantics.  </s>
<s> The root acts as a fence preventing us from traversing out of it.  </s>
<s> (Actually, it's more like a one-way gate; if you setCurrentNode to someplace outside the root you could  </s>
<s> traverse back into the root but can't traverse out again.) Again, moving the root has absolutely no effect if currentNode is within the root's subtree (since the subtree moves with the root).  </s>
<s> If you've previously created the odd outside-the-root condition, moving the root just changes where the recapture will occur.  </s>
<s> This seemed fairly obvious to the Traversal team, so we didn't state it explicitly.  </s>
<s> Does it really need to be nailed down?  </s>
<s> Joe Kesselman / IBM Research  </s>
<s> could  </s>
<s> For the treeWalker I agree it's rather obvious, however for the nodeIterator I would say that it wouldn't hurt with some nailing.  </s>
<s> The reason is that implementation-wise this introduces two different behaviours for for the reference node when an ancesor is moved out from the tree: 1.  </s>
<s> If the removed node is between the reference node and the rootnode the reference node is moved up in the tree.  </s>
<s> 2. If the removed node is root node or an ancestor to it the referenced node is unaffected.  </s>
<s> But section 1.1.1.2 says "If the reference node is removed from the list being iterated over, a different node is selected as the reference node" which isn't entierly correct.  </s>
