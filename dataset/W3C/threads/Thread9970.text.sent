I have been actioned by WebOnt WG to send this to RDFCore WG as a statement of a problem we have been having, with two possible solutions which involve unasserted triples. 
This document, just approved by the WebOnt WG, is a summary of the lengthy layering issue. 
Layering OWL on RDF with unasserted triples. 
URI: http://www.openhealth.org/WOWG/DTTF 
A copy of this message is being sent to www-webont-wg@w3.org. 
Jonathan, for the WebOnt WG Thank you Jonathan. 
I'm sure that preparing this has been a demanding task. 
For clarity, please could you tell us: o whether webont is considering any other solutions to this problem, i.e has webont resolved that some form of dark triples is the only acceptable solution o what is webont asking of rdfcore? 
I will allocate time at rdfcore's next telecon to consider this. 
Brian statement involve task. 
i.e acceptable The OWL model theory itself remains an open issue and different members of the WG have different ideas about how this might be accomplished. 
Besides the "Comprehensive Entailments" proposal from Jeremy, he had previously made the "Solipsistic" proposal but withdrew that after discussion at the Amsterdam F2F. 
Dan Connolly has just posted a new "Solipsistic" proposal note that in the F2F we discussed whether (in OWL): ought entail #John rdf:type _:Ci _:Ci rdf:type owl:Class _:Ci owl:intersectionOf _:L _:L rdf:type owl:List _:L owl:first #Student _:L owl:rest _:L2 _:L2 rdf:type owl:List _:L2 owl:first #Employee _:L2 owl:rest owl:nil which seems to be a common sense entailment (according to OWL) yet would not be licensed under a solipsistic system. 
At the F2F we agreed that such entailments would require that the Query system assert the existence of such classes, and that: 1) we need commonsense entailments 2) whether or not solipsism would work remains unclear at present 3) it would be hard to predict the effect on future specifications (particularly a query system). 
Hence proceeding with solipsism would involve some at present unclear amount of risk. 
At this point Jeremy withdrew the proposal however Dan (who was not at the A'dam F2F and hence did not participate in the discussion at that time) has just reintroduced it, and adequate discussion has not yet occured -- except for Peter Patel-Schneider's restatement of his oft stated positions: e.g. http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-webont-wg/2002May/0239.html and Of course Pat's question: Peter's response again find ourselves back at "unasserted triples" which actually is a _compromise_. 
Besides a solution to the world's problems? 
:-) the _minimum_ that would be required would be: nothing, OWL could introduce the _owl:Unasserted_ class into its namespace, however I would rather RDFCore introduce the _rdf:Unasserted_ class into its namespace which would (IMHO) produce a cleaner layering of the RDF and OWL mt semantics. 
From the WebOnt perspective, this would be preferable to a nested rdf:RDF or rdf:context syntactic signalling of unasserted triples (e.g. a nested context) as the syntax of OWL ontologies would be cleaner. 
_Alternatively_ one might require each RDF instance document to specify 'dark' or unasserted namespaces in an attribute on the root rdf:RDF element e.g. rdf:RDF rdf:unassertedNS=http://www.w3.org/2002/owl-unasserted# xmlns:owlUn="http://www.w3.org/2002/owl-unasserted#" in any case, the minimum that would be required would be the existence of the rdf:Unasserted class (or the owl:Unasserted class and hence nothing from RDFCore, if that is acceptable to the SemWeb CG) Jonathan Thanks Jonathan. 
That's a comprehensive reply. 
I think I heard: o Whether or not dark triples will be used by webont is still an open question o Never the less, webont are asking RDFCore to consider how dark triples might be provided Did I hear right? 
Brian of yes, since the OWL model theory has not been finalized, this is true _however_ I should note that many of the folks, as noted by the strong language I have quoted in the summary, are adamant that dark (I prefer the term "unasserted") triples will be required regardless of how the final MT looks. 
If dark triples are not provided, it may be a fair assessment, that either: 1) unsolvable problems may prevent the WebOnt WG from producing an acceptable model theory for OWL 2) the WG will never achieve consensus 3) the only way the WG will achieve consensus is by attrition Now let me emphasize that none of the above would be a certainty, but that the _risk_ would be real (indeed based upon the last 6 months discussion (2) may happen regardless -- well you can read the webont archives yourself and draw your own conclusions about what might happen). 
triples Yes. 
Despite the ongoing discussions, and taking into account the time sensitive issues for RDFCore we felt it was important to give this action item to you at this time. 
Jonathan Brian - I think it is clear that at this point WOWG will create a mechanism to achieve this effect. 
Several options are open. 
If RDF Core creates rdf:unasserted, then we would almost definitely use it (it's the only thing where we are close to consensus). 
If not, then we are not in consensus about which of two ways we might build would be less problematic -- but I think it safe to say that either one will cause some angst because we will have to either be less semantically compatible with RDF Core, have a weaker language on our part, or have to solve some problems that right now look like research. 
I think this is what John means when he says "not reach consensus" or do so by attrition -- we are grappling with hard issues that have impact on the future of the sem web, so it's not surprising we have to work carefully. 
yes, we have gotten two kinds of feedback from members of RDF Core - one says "Give us the one answer you want worked out in detail, and we'll accept or reject" the other is "Don't tell us how to do our job, it's RDF Core that should decide how to provide DTs" -- clearly we cannot do both, but I think John has come as close as humanly possible -- he has outlined an approach we believe would work, but has done it without trying to be over-constraining on RDF Core yes. 
Again, we do have OWL only solutions on the table, but they do not appear to most of us to be as good as what we could do if RDF provides some mechanism. 
Let me be clear on one thing - whatever decision RDF Core makes, webont will go on to design a successful ontology language that is maximally compatible with what you build - our job will be easier if one of the approaches works well for you, but it will not be a show-stopper either way. 
One other thing I'd like to state for the record -- and I invite everyone to quote me publicly on this: The unasserted triples issue is a hard one, but it is not a show-stopper. 
The 99% of stuff our groups are in agreement on, and building together, is what makes the Semantic Web the unstoppable, dynamic project that it is -- what we're ALL doing is very important and moving amazingly well. 
DTs is a technical issue, with ramifications at the margins - but the effort your group has made in providing a strong base for the semantic web is incredible, and to be much lauded. 
We're hoping OWL will be a strong motivator for people to use what you are building, and we also appreciate all the help your members are providing in helping us to create our language correctly. 
It is important that the outside world understand that while there are some hard architectural issues we are attacking, none of them is going to stop the semantic web from happening -- and happening sooner than they expect!! -Jim H. co-chair WebOnt Professor James Hendler hendler@cs.umd.edu
