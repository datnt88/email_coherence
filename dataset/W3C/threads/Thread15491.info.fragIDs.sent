<s> I realise that I am making this suggestion far too late in the WAI HTML review process, but in any case it is not of major importance by comparison with the other problems that have been occupying our attention recently.  </s>
<s> The PRE element in HTML is somewhat anomalous, in that it is intended to preserve the line breaks and spacing of the enclosed text.  </s>
<s> Such a rendering can not be supported by braille devices, unless a code for computer notation is used which provides a specific means of representing line endings and space characters.  </s>
<s> Such a code is intended to represent the text of computer programmes.  </s>
<s> Similarly, audio user agents are not likely to inform the user of the spacing and line breaks which are presented in a PRE element.  </s>
<s> Braille translation software needs to determine whether the preformatted material is meant to be treated as programme code or as ordinary text (in a natural language).  </s>
<s> This requirement can be met by setting aside a CLASS value: program pascal_sample; begin writeln ("This is a programme written in the Pascal language"); end.  </s>
<s> A braille translator, recognising the reserved class name, would process this text as computer notation.  </s>
<s> However, in the HTML 4.0 draft, there is an example of a poem which has been formatted using the PRE element.  </s>
<s> In such cases, the braille software should treat the text as natural language, and would need to ignore the spacing and line breaks.  </s>
<s> These considerations lead to the following question: should a comment be  </s>
<s> included in the description of PRE, which explains that non-visual user agents may ignore the spacing and line breaks in this element's content?  </s>
<s> As I have explained, a braille formatter will not always ignore the spacing of preformatted text, which can be represented, if necessary, using the braille code for computer notation.  </s>
<s> However, as the poetry example indicates, this is not always appropriate; and of course, audio devices are likely to ignore the spacing in any case.  </s>
<s> I think this is a reasonnable suggestion and something the HTML editors could add without too much discussion.  </s>
<s> Defining some agreed upon classes for PRE is going to be harder with our dead-line.  </s>
<s> This seems to be linked with CSS2 in any way, and maybe an item for markup guidelines (recommended class name of "ignore-spacing" for PRE).  </s>
<s> OK, as this is unlikely to be a controversial addition, I have added the following text in to the spec: Non-visual user agents may ignore the spacing and line breaks in this element's content.  </s>
<s> The spec previously left this unstated -- it only gave guidelines for visual user agents.  </s>

<s> Perhaps it should be worded slightly differently to say non-visual user agents may NEED TO ignore the spacing and line breaks in this element's content IN ORDER TO RENDER THE INFORMATION IN AUDITORY OR TACTILE (BRAILLE) MEDIA or something like that Gregg  </s>
