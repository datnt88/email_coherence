Hi, I lost my copy of Tidy when my computer was tampered with by children!!. 
I've tried to download another copy (Dublin mirror) but just get a strange file which I cannot 'read' tidy4aug00.tgz 
All links to download tidy lead back to the same web page sourceforge.net 
I would really appreciate another copy of Tidy as I found it very useful. 
Even if it is an older copy. 
Maureen Childs This is a tar-gzipped archive. 
I deduce that you're running on some flavour of Windows and therefore have nothing that handles a .tgz 
archive; but it wouldn't be any use to you anyway. 
If you go to http://tidy.sourceforge.net and scroll down, you'll find a section headed "other builds" - the first entry there is for a 27-Feb-2003 Windows version, in a zip archive. 
If you want the 4Aug00 version, you are welcome to download it from http://www.fred.bone.dial.pipex.com/Storage/tidy4aug00.zip if you can't find it anywhere else. 
You would, of course, be taking my word for it that this is an unmodified copy of the original. 
Either way, you'll need an unzip program (unless you're running Windows XP which I gather can do zip archives all by itself). 
If you don't have one, look for PKZIP, WinZip or PowerArchiver. 
Or, if you're reasonably computer literate, InfoZip's WiZ. 
* Fred Bone [Fri, 12/09/2003 at 13:35 +0100] I find this surprising : the Winzip I have on my windows station is able to handle tgz files. 
I would not really help, because the Unix code would not run. 
Jany Maybe so, but not everyone has WinZip (or PowerArchiver, or ...). 
Many people prefer WiZ, for example. 
HABit Tidy is a GUI wrapper for HTML Tidy for Windows I have now more-or-less completed HABTidy and would very much appreciate any comments and suggestions. 
I have done quite a bit of work on it since the initial release 3 weeks ago and it now has a comprehensive Help file. 
HABit Tidy was developed quite independently of Charles Reitzel's Tidy UI and although they share a number of features, they work completely differently. 
HABit Tidy is being made available as a "lighter-weight" alternative. 
Also, IMHO, it may be easier for the uninitiated to use. 
HABit Tidy is available for download from (230 Kb) Installation details are in the enclosed Readme file.
