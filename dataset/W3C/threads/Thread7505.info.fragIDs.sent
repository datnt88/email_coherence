<s> Hi, Thanks very much for all the kind replys to my last question,including Markus Fleck,Marc Eaddy, Jim Whitehead,Carl-Uni Manros,Surendra Reddy,and etc. Below is some thought of myself.  </s>
<s> 1.How to notify the users?  </s>
<s> I think that using email to notify the users or polling the web server are not the best way to let the users be notified immediately.I  </s>
<s> hope that the extended http protocol can add a command like 'push'.since in http/1.1 the connect can be permanent now,It maybe also possible for the server to push the data without the request of the client.  </s>
<s> I could not find enough material about how the channel works,but I think that maybe the client request the server at a periodic time.It possibly cannot be used at a realtime cscw enviroment either.  </s>
<s> 2.Which tool is the best?Using  </s>
<s> HTML under web,Java,or DCOM+ActiveX?  </s>
<s> I have read somehting about delta coding,though not fully understand it,I think that there is still a long way to make web authoring tool available on the web based on html,so we'd better make it based on Java.Maybe we first can make it independent on web browser,just like the Netscape and Microsoft's putting their team software(Netmeeting,cooltalk,etc) out of their web browser.We can use the interface described in the webdav document,maybe we need add something into it.  </s>
<s> Does anyone have thought about using DCOM to develop CSCW?  </s>
<s> 3. About other application such as video conference I agree that video conference should not be based on webdav, it should be based on RTP, and etc.  </s>
<s> I hope that someday when we visit some company's homepage,I press a button named 'Call my telephone',and then I talk with them face to face via web.  </s>
<s> Thanks again for all kind replys!  </s>
<s> Yours Sincerely!  </s>

<s> I agree -- it does appear that a server-to-client protocol for transmission  </s>
<s> of notification events would be a nice complementary protocol for WebDAV.  </s>
<s> My understanding of most existing Push technologies is that they involve a list of resources (the set of resources is called a "channel"), which a client retrieves at periodic intervals.  </s>
<s> I think this question requires some further refinement -- you're asking a question similar to: "Which is better, an internal combustion engine, or a snowblower?"  </s>
<s> Well, the answer depends on what you want to do with the tool.  </s>
<s> Your question asks which tool is best, without also asking, "for which usage context."  </s>
<s> Although this does give a use context, the question is still too broad.  </s>
<s> The CSCW (Computer Supported Cooperative Work) label encompasses email, collaborative authoring, video conferencing, configuration management, workflow, air traffic control, and systems which integrate several of these capabilities.  </s>
<s> DCOM might be a good infrastructure technology in some domains, but not others.  </s>

<s> Funny, I just started working on a protocol for event notification (called Event Notification Protocol -- clever, eh :)), using XML as the  </s>

<s> I can probably let both of you get a look at the spec (I am having it reviewed now internally for the most egregious blunders in protocol design).  </s>
<s> There just didn't seem to be any protocol designed just for event notification (X events would be very heavy for our application).  </s>
<s> Let me know if either or both of you are interested.  </s>

<s> There's a standard for event notification in email which is a 'report', as encapsulated in multipart/report, and sent as part of a message disposition notification or a delivery status notification.  </s>
<s> It would be good if any design for an "Event Notification Protocol" had a clear mapping of those formats and their semantics.  </s>
<s> The IPP group was intending to define event notification for Internet Printing ("notify me when the file was printed"), and so this would be of general applicability.  </s>

<s> Once I have it addressing requests and integrating somehow with the email event notification Larry Masinter noted (and getting it into Internet Draft format, of which it is partway there), I would be glad to submit it.  </s>
<s> I'd guess that I'll have all that done sometime in February.  </s>
