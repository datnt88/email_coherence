<s> Hello Karl,  </s>
<s> Thank you very much for your translation.  </s>
<s> I have added your translation to http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/translations#xhtml-basic .  </s>
<s> BTW, the above translation says the french version is at http://www.la-grange.net/w3c/REC-xhtml-basic/ , but it returns "403 Forbidden".  </s>
<s> It would be helpful to configure your Web server so that /w3c/REC-xhtml-basic/ returns /w3c/REC-xhtml-basic/Overview.html.  </s>
