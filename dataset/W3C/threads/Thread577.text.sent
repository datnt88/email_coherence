I'm using Tidy on my Windows XP machine and am accessing it from Evrsoft's 1st Page 2000. 
How can I point it to read my preferred setting rather than the built-in defaults? 
I have set an environmental variable, HTML_TIDY, to point to .tdy file which contains my preferred settings but they do not seem to be picked up. 
Frank Hi Frank, You've got the environment variable named right. 
Hopefully, it's something basic. 
Here's a couple things to check: 1) that the environment variable is actually set for the process Tidy runs within. 
I have found various flavors of Windows to be pretty crappy about environment inheritance (contrary to all docs). 
Setting a system environment variable usually does the trick. 
Avoid user vars. 
2) Check Tidy's output for any messages about the config file. 
I.e. make sure you don't have a typo in the path and that the path is absolute. 
take it easy, Charlie Charles, thanks for the response... 
I had it set as a user variable, but have changed it to a system variable now. 
No errors apparently but Tidy still isn't picking up all my preferences rather than the default. 
Another problem: Tools - Tidy HTML Format and Fix... - Tidy Document in 1st Page 2000 overwrites my preferences file with onr consisting of wrap: 200 tab-size: 4 indent: no indent-spaces: 2 doctype: auto char-encoding: ascii write-back: yes error-file: log.txt Weird... Frank
