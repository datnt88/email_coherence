<s> Hi J?rg and Janyne, Could someone compile Amaya with the debug option and give us more information about the crash (what function, what line, etc.).  </s>

<s> I found the directions on how to turn on the debug options (http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/Autoconf.html).  </s>
<s> I will download the source and try this today.  </s>
