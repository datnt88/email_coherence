<s> The UK Government intends to start a national trial of ENUM.  </s>
<s> This should hopefully start in the summer and last for 6 months.  </s>
<s> It will be operated by an ad-hoc group drawn from industry: telcos, registry and registrar providers, etc.  </s>
<s> The objective of the trial is to determine the viability and desirability of operating a production ENUM service for the UK. Participation in the trial is open to all, especially developers of ENUM-capable software or ASPs who can offer ENUM-aware services.  </s>
<s> Anyone interested in taking part in the trial should contact Alwyn Thomas at the Department of Trade and Industry.  </s>
<s> His email address is Alwyn.Thomas@dti.gsi.gov.uk.  </s>
<s> First this note is not off-topic for the ENUM WG..indeed it is totally in scope with the WG's revised charter.  </s>

<s> The Working Group will continue to maintain appropriate contact and liaison with standards bodies and groups, specifically ITU-T SG2, in order to provide technical or educational information as needed, such as the appropriate use of DNS.  </s>
<s> The Working Group will encourage the exchange of technical information within the emerging global ENUM community as well as documentation on practical experiences with implementations or administration of RFC 2916."  </s>

<s> I'd specifically like this ad-hoc group to maintain contact and liaison with the chairs and we would welcome ID's documenting the organization of this trial, scope and results.  </s>
<s> As you may know we will eventually want to take 2916 from proposed to draft in the usual IETF manner manner.  </s>
<s> The requirement for taking a RFC from proposed to draft standard require 2 demonstrations of inter operability and this trial could be useful in documenting that process.  </s>

<s> Cool. DTI is an agency of the United Kingdom government.  </s>

<s> OK. However my posting (and this reply) also goes to the IETF apps mailing list, where it may be off-topic.  </s>
<s> I sent the announcement there to try and reach out to developers or ASPs who may have ENUM-aware products that could be used in the trial.  </s>
<s> Richard Is there any restriction on the geographic location of Richard participants?  </s>
<s> No. Though for the obvious practical reasons it would help if participants had a presence in the UK (or in roughly the same time zone).  </s>
<s> It's also likely that participants will be bound by UK and EU law on data protection and privacy.  </s>
<s> That could present constraints on what participants in other jurisdictions can and cannot do.  </s>

<s> Although I can't speak for the UK trial group, I'm sure it will be happy to do that.  </s>
<s> Though obviously this will need to be discussed first.  </s>
<s> Pretty much everything surrounding the trial will be in the public domain.  </s>
<s> The trial will appoint a manager/co-ordinator and one of their responsibilities will be liaising with other trials, IETF WG chairs, ITU SG2 and so on.  </s>
