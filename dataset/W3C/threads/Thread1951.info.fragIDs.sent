I apologise in advance as this is somewhat off-topic for these lists but I hope the moderators will indulge me. 
This is probably the most effective way of reaching out to the audience that's being sought. 
The UK Government intends to start a national trial of ENUM. 
This should hopefully start in the summer and last for 6 months. 
It will be operated by an ad-hoc group drawn from industry: telcos, registry and registrar providers, etc. 
The objective of the trial is to determine the viability and desirability of operating a production ENUM service for the UK. Participation in the trial is open to all, especially developers of ENUM-capable software or ASPs who can offer ENUM-aware services. 
Anyone interested in taking part in the trial should contact Alwyn Thomas at the Department of Trade and Industry. 
His email address is Alwyn.Thomas@dti.gsi.gov.uk. 
First this note is not off-topic for the ENUM WG..indeed it is totally in scope with the WG's revised charter. 
"3. 
The Working Group will continue to maintain appropriate contact and liaison with standards bodies and groups, specifically ITU-T SG2, in order to provide technical or educational information as needed, such as the appropriate use of DNS. 
The Working Group will encourage the exchange of technical information within the emerging global ENUM community as well as documentation on practical experiences with implementations or administration of RFC 2916." 
Is there any restriction on the geographic location of participants? 
I'd specifically like this ad-hoc group to maintain contact and liaison with the chairs and we would welcome ID's documenting the organization of this trial, scope and results. 
As you may know we will eventually want to take 2916 from proposed to draft in the usual IETF manner manner. 
The requirement for taking a RFC from proposed to draft standard require 2 demonstrations of inter operability and this trial could be useful in documenting that process. 
Thank you for making the list aware of this opportunity!

Hi Richard, 
Cool. DTI is an agency of the United Kingdom government. 
Do the chairs intend to maintain this liaison activity with respect to other government agencies and trials? 
Representing ISOC IETF or ISOC IAB? 
Is this just for the e164.arpa 
service brand?

OK. However my posting (and this reply) also goes to the IETF apps mailing list, where it may be off-topic. 
I sent the announcement there to try and reach out to developers or ASPs who may have ENUM-aware products that could be used in the trial. 
Richard Is there any restriction on the geographic location of Richard participants? 
No. Though for the obvious practical reasons it would help if participants had a presence in the UK (or in roughly the same time zone). 
It's also likely that participants will be bound by UK and EU law on data protection and privacy. 
That could present constraints on what participants in other jurisdictions can and cannot do.

Although I can't speak for the UK trial group, I'm sure it will be happy to do that. 
Though obviously this will need to be discussed first. 
Pretty much everything surrounding the trial will be in the public domain. 
The trial will appoint a manager/co-ordinator and one of their responsibilities will be liaising with other trials, IETF WG chairs, ITU SG2 and so on.
