Hello, Here are some refined ideas for the 'Physically Impaired Navigation' issue # 19. 
While keyboard controls must be clustered to reduce keyboard travel distance for those with diseases like MS, having controls in one large block is troublesome for those of us lacking fine motor control. 
To meet both needs I see the controls as a cluster of ocean islands, 2 keys together to say move the Link Anchor Up &amp; Down pages with doing nothing keys besides them. 
Because keyboard rows are offset there is less chance of sliding down to hit incorrect keys. 
To take advantage of that offset it might be possible to put keyboard controls in 4 key vertical aisles [2 islands that abut]. 
These aisles will make it easy to keep keyboard controls close to ENTER which will usually do get item. 
The 2 key island can still be used for Page Next &amp; Back with Backspace as Back &amp; the "+=" key as Next, for example. 
Unfortunately mnemonics will be lost in this layout, but the loss isn't that great as it is unlikely function names could be place appropriately on one-key controls, in any case. 
In about 2 weeks people get use to control placement especially when it has some spacial root. 
Pages move side ways so those command keys are side-by-side, Link Anchor goes up &amp; down so keys should be vertical. 
Also browser should use a modifier key to jump Link Anchor 6 or 7 links. 
I have macros to jump 6 or 11 links in either direction, they greatly reduce the workload. 
A new command to go back to last link would be terrific because sometimes I get to a link &amp; slip side ways, end up on a Heading. 
As a TV recalls a last channel the browser would return to the last link. 
Thanks for reading.

Personally, I believe it's out of scope to specify what keys should be used, other than to say something like "use keyboard shortcuts which are native to the platform and user interface being used. 
Also take into account the needs of physically impaired users when designing keyboard layouts." 
The worst thing that a browser can do is invent new keyboard models which are incompatible with the other applications and the overall scheme of the platform and it's associated user interface.

The guidelines would never dictae a particular key, but statements could be made related to the physical proximity of the keys used to implement certain functions.
