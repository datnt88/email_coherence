Anyone know when this feature will be supported? 
Is it already supported? 
I'm using Amaya for Solaris 2.5 and when I try to use: body{ background: blue / yellow } or body{ background: blue/yellow; bg-blend-direction: NW } I only get the first color -- the second doesn't blend in at all.

Today, CSS1 implementation in Amaya is not complete yet and we are working on it. 
The "background blending" feature is not part of CSS1 specification (see There are so many things to do in Amaya !

Irene, Thank you for your reply. 
I read in several html 3.2 books that this feature would be part of the upcoming CSS1 implementation. 
Now that I have browsed the W3C website, under section 5.3 Color and background properties I see that this is not the case. 
I found this one of the most interesting features of background color properties, however, and am sorry to hear that it isn't included in CSS1. 
Perhaps it is something that the W3C will tackle in the near future? 
Once again, thank you for the quick response!
