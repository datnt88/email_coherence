Jakob Nielsen's AlertBox column talks about web accessibility and the WCAG, and states the following: "But I am not sure that single-design pages will be able to deliver optimal usability in the future. 
For example, screen sizes will soon differ so drastically between high-end office workstations and small mobile devices that the same pages will not satisfy both. 
And I also think that one can make pages much more usable for blind users and users with other disabilities by designing explicitly for these groups." 
Agree or disagree? 
To tie into a recent thread: how does access for cognitively impaired users tie into this? 
We've been saying that you don't need a separate web site for blind (et al) users, but -- if content needs to be actually rewritten for a new audience in order to make it comprehensible -- is this the end of "writing once" and the beginning of specialized web sites for each type of disability? 
Your thoughts are welcome. 
--Kynn Kynn said: In an IDEAL world everything would be accessible to everyone all the time. 
But we don't live in that world. 
Whether it is the web or any other media there will be some practical considerations in the development of material. 
I am sure a case can be made for extremes but is there really any serious need to produce a drivers handbook in Braille? 
Has anyone considered the needs of a cognitively disabled person who is also blind? 
If the ideal of Universal Design escapes us we should, I think, adapt in the best way possible with the target audience in mind. 
Thus, that fancy high-end system at the office shouldn't be spending a lot of time in a games area and I would rather not think about somebody using a phone-link to review a scientific paper while driving to work. 
Marti McCuller Agassa Technologies Web Accessibility Services Marti asked: Of Course, as I said a case can be made for almost everything. 
It remains for 'society' to decide if it worth the investment (time, money, resources) to meet each and every individual need. 
In any culture the answers are likely to be different. 
None of this should ever stop us from striving to achieve an ideal world. 
Marti David Said: The best example is should a chile be able to make an atom bomb? 
Great example! 
Hats Off! 
To take it a little further, should the instructions be rewritten just to make sure they are easy to understand, complete with icons showing the proper order of assembly? 
I am certainly not disagreeing with Universal Design concepts, just having trouble with where and how to draw the lines. 
Marti Marti asked: A blind grandmother helping her granddaughter study for a driving test? 
--Kynn Are we getting so 'hung-up' on examples we are missing the point? 
Universal Design is an admirable goal but reality kicks in at some point. 
The problem as I see it is to figure out where that point is, and then try to stretch just a little beyond it! 
Marti I see your point but unfortunately in this case the answer is yes. 
since you asked yes or no, I am tempted to stop here, but I'll expand and then perhaps provide an example that will serve. 
Providing an handbook of any kind in braille assists the blind in both knowing the content and aiding the sighted who must need assistance from us judging by some of the posts I've seen here. 
The best example is should a chile be able to make an atom bomb? 
yes, we are all cognatively disabled if you want to use that fraze in some way and to some degree or other. 
Blindness in and of its self implies some impairment of cognition although it is hotly denied by many blind people and when a blind person such as myself stands up and says it we are told we are feeling sorry for our selves or attempting to gain the sympathy of those who do not know better. 
I won't elaborate the case here but to say that if I suddenly became sighted, there's a lot of stuff I'd have to learn. 
I've found that the high end systems can do just fine with the constructs targetted at the widest audience but that the converse is untrue.

---sig off--- Why should knowledge be feared? 
For the most part, this "hidden knowledge" is more dangerous in the hands of adults with hidden personal agendas (such as the average government) than it would be in the hands of children or learning-disabled (what's the right term?) adults. 
I knew in junior high what was necessary to create a bomb, and I haven't blown up any countries yet (it's only been 18 years since jr. 
high, gimme some time?) -- knowledge itself is not dangerous. 
Can't we find out this information from libraries, anyway? 
--Kynn Hi Kynn I agree with Jakob's comments. 
I've become aware since attending the first day of the WAI meeting in Toronto of two web accessibility communities. 
One focuses on the needs to make HTML accessible, the other is looking at developing a richer web in the future. 
The former group gives priority to education, importance of ALT tags, etc. 
The latter regards HTML as on its way out, and priority should be given to the new stuff (XML, XLink, RDF, etc.) To give an example. 
The ALT tag provides a simple, one-dimensional description of an image. 
Multi-lingual support is missing (an obvious barrier to understanding). 
But ALT also fails to provide information which may be needed to address cultural issues. 
I touched on this in my talk at the WAI meeting - see 1.htm As an example of the richer form of metadata I think is needed (e.g. for images) see 2.htm I discussed these issues with Julie Howell of the RNIB (Royal National Institute for the Blind) here in the UK who stated that: "Rather than encouraging 'simplicity' in Web design ... we try to encourage 'flexibility', so that Web sites can be tailored to individual need 'simply'. 
Flexibility affords the personalisation which people with sight problems require." 
Brian Kelly Further to my previous posting I'd like to give two examples of why the principles of universal design may not be applicable. 
Current guidelines state that web pages should be device independent, and that phrases such as "Click here" should be avoided (because some users may not be using a mouse-driven interface). 
On the other hand, "click here" may be a good phrase for, say, someone with learning disabilities who does have a mouse, but has difficulties mastering a user interface. 
This was brought to my attention recently when testing a web site designed for children - I found it difficult differentiating between images with just ALT text and images with ALT text which acted as links. 
Similarly, "Return to home page" is a bad name for an anchor (the user may not have been to the home page). 
However it might be a good name for an anchor generated on the fly, when the system knows the user have been to the page. 
"Click here" and "Return to home page" should be avoided in static HTML pages. 
However they *may* be desirable in other circumstances.

groups." the which encourage This is where the system of 'label' and 'description' proposed in the Scalable Vector Graphics is easier to understand and use well than the perplexing welter of constructs in HTML. 
For others interested in continuing progress against the 'click here' problem, review the 'fat links' notion we have talked about in the User Agent working group. 
Here the user agent would recognize that 'click here' is not a discriminant for different link targets, and automatically back off so that the minimal display to a screen reader or other peephole access technology would include contextualizing material from the vicinity of the link, such as the immediately enclosing list item or sentence. 
If we put in guardband rules for how the sensitive regions don't get too close together, this is also beneficial for people with fine motor control problems. 
PS: also fixes label-after-checkbox. Make them a clickability atom. 
But this doesn't mean the end of single-design pages. 
What it means is that the class of pages for which one can have a single design is not a single layout but a single design of a polymorph, with an infrastructure of semantic structure and a variety of interface incarnations. 
Al This link should identify whose home is the page linked to. 
Don't assume that the user has this notion in their recall memory. 
Any page that can be retrieved can be started at. 
People don't think to make their pages robust against the fact that anybody can start anywhere. 
Given the popularity of search engines as portals, many hits come from out of the blue, not from the site's carefully laid out entry paths. 
just some thoughts... 
I suspect that the single-design page will be with us for some time to come. 
The value of it is that it is cheaper to only do the job once. 
But what we do in that single design page will change somewhat. 
I think it is true that different users have different needs. 
At the moment there is some very crude technology for tryng to cater to them. 
At the best practise level, users can decide what types of content (html, gif, png, movies, etc) they wish to use. 
They can also decide on which languages, in order of preference, they want. 
This is fairly coarse grained. 
At the other end of the scale, there are people sniffing for different browsers, and attempting to serve content which is appropriate to those browsers. 
Unfortunately there are now a large number of browsers in use, and most sites decide to support one or two, and exclude everyone else. 
Also, making assumptions about what a user can do based on the browser they are using often leads to inaccurate assumptions. 
The use of websites which are generated by a database, where various types of equivalent content can be kept together, enables the generation of pages based on user requests, with a low design overhead. 
(Low in comparison to the overhead for careful design of a completely manually generated site. 
Design of a large website requires careful thought if it is to be done well.) Hopefully emergent technologies such as CC/PP will further improve the picture, providing a reliable means of knowing what type of content suits the user. 
The needs for this are similar in the areas of mobile access and in accessiblity. 
Another helpful approach is the use of metadata. 
This is already possible - PICS has been used for several years to provide information about a site's content. 
The primary use of it has been to identify the cultural appropriateness of a site according to some very "mainstream" values, but it can also be used to find out about the accessibility of a site, or the educational value, or even the reading level required to access a site. 
So I think the change will be that website design, and webpage layout, will no longer be seen as the same thing. 
The careful design of a website, making use of the full possibilities of the web, and ensuring continued support of such mundane and useful features as handy textual equivalents for images, will lead to better accessibility for more people. 
cheers Charles McCN I don't see these as beign two _communities_ as much as two different approaches for different times and different situations -- they are not mutually exclusive. 
It's possible to be a member of both camps, by planning for the future but realizing that we have to live in the present until the future gets here.
