below are three urls which sem to me to blend the os and the web. 
this is a scary thought. 
this means, that authoring agents, user agents, and coding standards are going to have to some how blend as they currently don't have to. 
microsoft has: microsoft and others have: and then there is: which seems possibly quite powerful. 
any thoughts?

If this trend moves to one standard platform where the notion of individual PC's and individual platforms (operating systems etc.) disappears, this could be the solution not the problem. 
Besides, the issue is not a web-OS versus a PC Os. 
The question is, regardless of which is used, are accessibility features built in. 
Neither case has inherently better conditions for accessibility as far as I can see. 
What is a potential problem is the "dynamic document" metaphor - this would really make things difficult for *current* screen readers. 
Then again, it's not a question of dynamic vs. static either. 
It's a deeper question again. 
If dynamic documents do become the dominant metaphor, this just means accessibility standards for this model need to be created. 
If there really is one standard, seamless web-os, it should be easier to write such accessibility guidelines and easier to create assistive technologies. 
There is no guarantee of this happenning of course. 
The potential for taking advantage of something can always be ignored... 
It is never as simple as "Is format/tool/technology accessible or not". 
That question is much too simplistic.

As a basic principle, accessibility which is added on afterwards is generaly more expensive, and further behind, than accessibility which is designed in from the start, and keeps being a design criterion. 
The way I think of it is that accessibility is a first-class technical problem. 
The purpose of a communication medium is to get information from person to person, and if there is a reason why that doesn't work, whether it is becuase the bits get lost in the network, or two systems can't interoperate (and this applies to a word processor unable to read a different format and to a braille line unable to present the information in a document) then the medium doesn't work. 
The challenge is twofold. 
First, designers need to take this understanding on board. 
Second, they need to keep it on board, and keep thinking about it, especially where they are trying to make an optimisation. 
Applying the "it'll work 90% of the time, or 99% of the time" approach to justifying a deviation from proper design practice is the warning bell, but it must be heeded if accessibility is going to be a fundamental feature of specifications or systems. 
Charles McCN true but then the question arrises as to what we deliver it on and from what I've seen of the current crop of delivery platforms for this type of thing, there doesn't seem to be much hope. 
I'm the eternal optimist but here as well as in some other arenas, just as we are about to catch up, it seems as though the proverbial rug will be puled out from under us. 
How long will it take to get access up to speed on this vursus how long it will take for it to proppagate? 
These are things I have concern about. 
Not, can it be accessible? 
What will the cost be in dollars and lost potential while its access evolves. 
Perhaps this is a paradigm where providing access can be done early and often. 
I only know that as this prolfferates, we are in for a bumpy ride.
