<s> This is a write-up of the proposed changes to rev-00 regarding Accept-transfer (now Accept-TE) and Transfer-Encoding.  </s>
<s> It takes into account the following - introduces transfer-encoding parameters - prevents chunked from having any parameters in Transfer-Encoding - prevents chunked from having q=0 in Accept-TE - prevents CL from being in a trailer Larry, I know this is kind of late, but the trailer field issue and transfer encodings are relatively new issues.  </s>
<s> However, we are using a lot of existing mechanisms already defined in HTTP/1.1 and hence the new stuff boils down to the header names.  </s>
<s> Comments?  </s>
<s> Henrik 3.6 Transfer Codings Transfer coding values are used to indicate an encoding transformation that has been, can be, or may need to be applied to an entity-body in order to ensure "safe transport" through the network.  </s>
<s> This differs from a content coding in that the transfer coding is a property of the message, not of the original entity.  </s>
<s> Therefore, transfer codings only apply to the immediate connection.  </s>
<s> transfer-coding = "chunked" | transfer-extension transfer-extension = token *( ";" parameter ) Parameters may be in the form of attribute/value pairs.  </s>
<s> parameter = attribute "=" value attribute = token value = token | quoted-string [[Jim, parameter is already defined in 3.7.  </s>
<s> As it should only be in one place, it can either be here or in section 3.7.  </s>
<s> In the latter case, there should be a forward reference here]] All transfer-coding values are case-insensitive.  </s>
<s> HTTP/1.1 uses transfer coding values in the Accept-TE header field (section 14.Y) and the Transfer-Encoding header field (section 14.40).  </s>
<s> Transfer codings are analogous to the Content-Transfer-Encoding values of MIME [7], which were designed to enable safe transport of binary data over a 7-bit transport service.  </s>
<s> However, safe transport has a different focus for an 8bit-clean transfer protocol.  </s>
<s> In HTTP, the only unsafe characteristic of message-bodies is the difficulty in determining the exact body length (section 7.2.2), or the desire to encrypt data over a shared transport.  </s>
<s> The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) acts as a registry for transfer-coding value tokens.  </s>
<s> Initially, the registry contains the following tokens: "chunked" (section 3.6.1),  </s>
<s> "identity" (section 3.6.2),  </s>
<s> "gzip" (section 3.5), "compress" (section 3.5), and "deflate" (section 3.5).  </s>
<s> New transfer-coding value tokens should be registered in the same way as new content-coding value tokens (section 3.5).  </s>
<s> A server which receives an entity-body with a transfer-coding it does not understand SHOULD return 501 (Unimplemented), and close the connection.  </s>
<s> A server MUST NOT send transfer-codings to an HTTP/1.0 client.  </s>
<s> 3.6.1  </s>
<s> Chunked Transfer Coding The chunked encoding modifies the body of a message in order to transfer it as a series of chunks, each with its own size indicator, followed by an optional trailer containing entity-header fields.  </s>
<s> This allows dynamically-produced content to be transferred along with the information necessary for the recipient to verify that it has received the full message.  </s>
<s> Chunked-Body = *chunk last-chunk trailer CRLF chunk = chunk-size [ chunk-extension ] CRLF chunk-data CRLF chunk-size = 1*HEX last-chunk = 1*("0") [ chunk-extension ] CRLF chunk-extension= *( ";" chunk-ext-name [ "=" chunk-ext-value ] ) chunk-ext-name = token chunk-ext-value= token | quoted-string chunk-data = chunk-size(OCTET) trailer = *entity-header The chunk-size field is a string of hex digits indicating the size of the chunk.  </s>
<s> The chunked encoding is ended by any chunk whose size is zero, followed by the trailer, which is terminated by an empty line.  </s>
<s> The trailer allows the sender to include additional HTTP header fields at the end of the message.  </s>
<s> The Trailer header field can be used to indicate which header fields are included in a trailer (see section 14.Y).  </s>
<s> A server using chunked transfer-coding in a response MUST NOT use the trailer for other header fields than Content-MD5 and Authentication-Info unless the "chunked" transfer-coding is present in the request as an accepted transfer-coding in the Accept-TE field (section 14.X).  </s>
<s> An example process for decoding a Chunked-Body is presented in appendix 19.4.6.  </s>
<s> All HTTP/1.1 applications MUST be able to receive and decode the "chunked" transfer coding, and MUST ignore chunk-extension extensions they do not understand.  </s>
<s> 3.6.2  </s>
<s> Identity Transfer Coding The identity transfer-encoding is the default (identity) encoding; the use of no transformation whatsoever.  </s>
<s> This transfer-coding is used only in the Accept-TE header, and SHOULD NOT be used in any Transfer-Encoding header.  </s>
<s> 14.X Accept-TE The Accept-TE request-header field is similar to Accept-Encoding, but restricts the transfer-codings (section 3.6) that are acceptable in the response.  </s>
<s> Accept-TE = "Accept-TE" ":" #( t-codings ) t-codings = "chunked" | ( transfer-extension [ accept-params ] ) Examples of its use are:  </s>
<s> Accept-TE: deflate Accept-TE: Accept-TE: chunk=1.0;  </s>
<s> deflate=0.5  </s>
<s> The Accept-TE header field only applies to the immediate connection.  </s>
<s> Therefore, the accept-te keyword MUST be supplied within a Connection header field (section 14.10) whenever Accept-TE is present in an HTTP/1.1 message.  </s>
<s> A server tests whether a transfer-coding is acceptable, according to an Accept-TE field, using these rules: 1.  </s>
<s> If the transfer-coding is one of the transfer-codings listed in the Accept-TE field, then it is acceptable, unless it is accompanied by a qvalue of 0. (As defined in section 3.9, a qvalue of 0 means "not acceptable.") 2. If multiple transfer-codings are acceptable, then the acceptable transfer-coding with the highest non-zero qvalue is preferred.  </s>
<s> 3. The "identity" transfer-coding is always acceptable, unless specifically refused because the Accept-TE field includes "identity;q=0", or because the field includes "*;q=0" and does not explictly include the "identity" transfer-coding.  </s>
<s> If the Accept-TE field-value is empty, then only the "identity" encoding is acceptable.  </s>
<s> 4. The "chunked" transfer-coding is always acceptable.  </s>
<s> The Trailer header field (section 14.Y) can be used to indicate the set of header fields included in the trailer.  </s>
<s> If an Accept-TE field is present in a request, and if a server cannot send a response which is acceptable according to the Accept-TE header, then the server SHOULD send an error response with the 406 (Not Acceptable) status code.  </s>
<s> If no Accept-TE field is present, the sender MAY assume that the recipient will accept the "identity" and "chunked" transfer-codings.  </s>
<s> A server using chunked transfer-coding in a response MUST NOT use the trailer for other header fields than Content-MD5 and Authentication-Info unless the "chunked" transfer-coding is present in the request as an accepted transfer-coding in the Accept-TE field.  </s>
<s> 14.Y Trailer The Trailer general field value indicates that the given set of header fields are present in the trailer of a message encoded with chunked transfer-coding.  </s>
<s> Trailer = "Trailer" ":" 1#field-name An HTTP/1.1 sender MAY include a Trailer header field in a message using chunked transfer-coding with a non-empty trailer.  </s>
<s> Doing so allows the recipient to know which header fields to expect in the trailer.  </s>
<s> If no Trailer header field is present, the trailer SHOULD NOT include any other header fields than Content-MD5 and Authentication-Info.  </s>
<s> A server MUST NOT include any other header fields unless the "chunked" transfer-coding is present in the request as an accepted transfer-coding in the Accept-TE field.  </s>
<s> Message headers listed in the Trailer header field MUST NOT include the following header fields: Transfer-Encoding Content-Length Trailer  </s>
<s> Sorry, but I find these paragraphs very confusing and, possibly, contradictory.  </s>
<s> According to (3), an empty Accept-TE allows only "identity".  </s>
<s> According to (4), "chunked" is always acceptable.  </s>
<s> Which is right?  </s>
<s> Also, in these (earlier) examples of Accept-TE: Accept-TE: deflate Accept-TE: Accept-TE: chunk=1.0;  </s>
<s> deflate=0.5  </s>
<s> Is "chunk" a hypothetical new TE, or is it a misspelling of "chunked", in which case it's invalid (because "chunked" can't take a parameter)?  </s>
<s> And, syntactically don't those have to be Accept-TE: chunk;q=1.0;  </s>
<s> deflate;q=0.5  </s>
<s> Dave Kristol  </s>
<s> Hi Dave,  </s>
<s> They are indeed - must have been eating something bad.  </s>
<s> I think this is better: 3. The "identity" transfer-coding is always acceptable, unless specifically refused because the Accept-TE field includes "identity;q=0".  </s>
<s> The "chunked" transfer-coding is always acceptable.  </s>
<s> The Trailer header field (section 14.Y) can be used to indicate the set of header fields included in the trailer.  </s>
<s> 4. If the Accept-TE field-value is empty, only the "identity" and the "chunked" transfer-codings are acceptable.  </s>
<s> Sorry, it should have been Accept-TE: chunked; deflate;q=0.5  </s>
<s> meaning that the client accepts any allowed header to occur in the trailer of a chunked encoded message and is somewhat happy to accept deflate.  </s>
<s> Thanks!  </s>
<s> Henrik Henrik Frystyk Nielsen, World Wide Web Consortium  </s>
<s> To make Draft Standard, we have to document at least two interoperable implementations of each feature.  </s>
<s> So where are the interoperable implementations of trailer fields and transfer encoding?  </s>
<s> If it's unlikely that we will see interoperable implementations of trailer fields in the next month (which seems pretty unlikely to me), maybe we can undock 'Trailer Fields'.  </s>
<s> Larry  </s>
<s> Transfer encoding is one of the "big wins" possible in HTTP/1.1; our tests showed substantial improvements both in elapsed time for end users, and in bandwidth on the net.  </s>
<s> So lets get closure on the technical solution right now, independently of the implementation question for draft standard.  </s>
<s> (Though I would hope we could keep the idea of undocking it in mind).  </s>
<s> Getting two interoperable implementations isn't that hard a test to meet, even in a month (where did you get that date from, anyway?, though I'm even more anxious to be done than you are).  </s>
<s> We could even do that here at W3C if we had to do so to meet the implementation requirements (used to be a cheat when Anselm was sharing an office with Henrik, but it wouldn't be now).  </s>
<s> This isn't the only place where we have implementation issues to deal with (e.g. 305/306, which needs help, and for which I know of no implementations).  </s>
<s> Ari promised to pick it up from Josh and try to get something done this week on that one (which we may also want/need to undock).  </s>
<s> So lets keep focussed on solving the technical problems; there are VERY few of them left (my last count was 7 outstanding technical issues, most of which are well on their way to closure, I believe).  </s>
