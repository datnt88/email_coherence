Section 8.1 of the WebDAV spec states that the results for a PROPFIND on a collection resource with internal memeber URIs are returned as a flat list whose order of entries is not significant. 
Since the internal member URIs can be construed as properties of the collection, is it safe to assume that the collection URI and its properties will be listed first and that only the order of the children is not significant ? 
I've noticed that the zope server seems to work this way.

Although it is probable, it is not safe to assume that. 
...but I suspect you already knew that. 
:-) Not safe at all... mod_dav returns the collection's properties last. 
It may change one day, but I have no plans to change it in the near/mid term.
