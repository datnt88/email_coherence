Hello, I've encountered the same problem with Tidy, using Tomcat 4.0.1, Sun's Jdk 1.3, and Microsoft JVMs. 
I extracted sources files from jtidy-04aug2000r6.zip and compiled them with Sun's Jdk 1.3 ; then, I rebuilt a Tidy.jar 
It works ! 
Isabelle Anyone working with Tidy and vb/asp. 
Is it just to download the code from the tidy4aug00.tgz and recompile it as a COM? then register it and use it in the code? 
Or is there a special process. 
Have you looked at TidyCOM? 
/Jelks Seen it, but it worries me that it is over 1 year old. 
cheers, Howard
