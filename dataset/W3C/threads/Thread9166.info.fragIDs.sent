<s> There was some related discussion in the telecon this afternoon, and I was kind of unable to explain my point...(I'm really hopeless in that respect) The thing about anonymous nodes is that they are ***variables*** if they would be constants, we would be able to identify them with ***URI constants*** Now they are actually existentially quantified variables, something like: there exists an _:a or (using existing vocab): this log:forSome _:a So I think we should say that *explicitly* is the testresults (and in the model theory) (the general case?)

<s> Hi Brian, Great, I really find this interesting too!  </s>
<s> I think there are 3 kinds of variables [1] free variables [2] existentially quantified variables [3] universally quantified variables  </s>
<s> and I think the misunderstanding is that anonymous resources are (sometimes) 'treated' as [1] whereas I think they should always be treated as [2].  </s>
<s> If somebody writes the following .nt  </s>
<s> _:a uriref1 uriref2 .  </s>
<s> and says that this is a statement, then (s)he is basically talking a free variable (somewhere floating around in triple space)  </s>
<s> I think this is wrong because there is no quantification: the floating thing should be existentially quantified and I think  </s>
<s> the best way to do that is to *point* to it.  </s>
<s> That can be simply done with a statement *using* that term e.g. uriref3 uriref4 _:a.  </s>
<s> or it can be done with scope-uri the-log-forSome-uri _:a.  </s>
<s> I have recently experimented with implicit scoping, but I think this is not a scalable approach.  </s>
<s> If we have terms existentially quantified, then I think that a lot can be done with such terms, but that's another topic...  </s>

<s> Hi Jos,  </s>
<s> With regard to the recent discussion with Jan, I think there might be some miscommunication.  </s>
<s> What I think than Jan is saying is that, given the model: http://descr1 http:/prop _:anon .  </s>
<s> http://descr2 http:/prop _:anon .  </s>
<s> it is not possible to express this exactly in the RDF/XML syntax.  </s>
<s> The reason is that the only way this can be done is to assign an ID or a URI to the anonymous resource.  </s>
<s> That 'resource' then ceases to be anonymous.  </s>
<s> In effect, it is no longer a variable.  </s>
<s> Try translating the above n-triple example to RDF/XML and you will see what I mean.  </s>
<s> Reading your message again, maybe I get an inkling of what you are saying.  </s>
<s> We are talking here about what is an anonymous resource.  </s>
<s> We have been saying that it is an existentially qualified variable.  </s>
<s> I have been understanding that to mean that it denotes some specific resource with certain properties, i.e. _:anon rdf:type rdf:Class .  </s>
<s> says there is some specific resource, _:anon, which has type class.  </s>
<s> Is that what you would call a 'constant'?  </s>
<s> Ah.  </s>
<s> This is beginning to make sense to me.  </s>
<s> If it were a constant, then you wouldn't mind at all that a URI had been assigned to it.  </s>
<s> That would not change its nature.  </s>
<s> I think you may be saying that what I thought of as a variable is not really a variable.  </s>
<s> It does not bind to multiple values.  </s>
<s> Instead it represents a single value (constant) though I don't know what the value is.  </s>
<s> Hmmm.  </s>
<s> Now consider: 5+x=1 Is x a variable?  </s>
<s> No. Its an unknown, until I solve the equation.  </s>
<s> Have we been calling anon resources variables, when we should have called them unknowns?  </s>
<s> If what I previously thought of as a variable, is not really a variable, how would you explain what a variable is, without having to refer to concepts defined in a logic layer above rdfcore?  </s>
<s> This is really very interesting.  </s>
<s> Have a good weekend.  </s>

<s> Hi Jos,  </s>
<s> So just to help me a little along the path to understanding, could you explain a bit more about what you mean by a free variable.  </s>
<s> Some examples that I can relate to would be good.  </s>
<s> For example is the x in 5x+1=6 a free variable?  </s>
<s> Thats what I was calling an unknown.  </s>
<s> Wheras the x in x+y=0 is a variable.  </s>
<s> At least that's the distinction I thought you were making.  </s>
<s> Can you give examples of the difference?  </s>
<s> Not being sure about what you mean by a 'free variable' I don't understand that.  </s>
<s> I would have said _:a is an unknown.  </s>
<s> The difference between a free variable and an unknown is that a free variable may be bound to many things, an unknown can bind to just one.  </s>
<s> Doesn't existential quantification turn a free variable into an unkown?  </s>
<s> That's why skolemization works - we can give an existentially qualified variable a name (assuming for the moment we are not in the scope of a universal quanitifer, because we don't have any of those in rdf).  </s>
<s> Now if that were true, then you and I have the same model for what what is going on here.  </s>
<s> _:a is both an existentially qualified variable and an 'unknown' because they are the same thing (in this context - because we have no universal quantification) So if that is the case, then what's the problem here?  </s>
<s> Maybe the problem is that you are of the view that it does no hard to assign a name to an anonymous resource.  </s>
<s> That's just skolemization.  </s>
<s> You might then argue, with Sergey, that there is no need to represent anonymous resources in the model.  </s>
<s> And Jan's problem that RDF/XML cannot represent an arbritary model is not a problem.  </s>
<s> By the way I've changed the title from log:forSome.  </s>
<s> This may be another misunderstanding on my part, but I'm talking about anon resources as they would be defined in the lowest layers of the rdf model.  </s>
<s> At that layer log:forSome is not defined so we can't use it here.  </s>
<s> If you are taling about a logic language layered on top of the core, that could explain a lot.  </s>
<s> Now you have lost me.  </s>
<s> What is a term?  </s>
<s> RDF doesn't define such a concept.  </s>
<s> Brian  </s>
<s> Jos, Brian-- Just to put my 2 cents in:  </s>
<s> I think Jos is doing an implicit translation into logic.  </s>
<s> Strictly speaking, I don't think we have variables of any kind in RDF, but if you translate RDF into [what I think of as] the equivalent logic, some variables appear.  </s>
<s> It may help to go back to the M&amp;S example of anonymous resources, namely: "The individual whose name is Ora Lassila, email lassila@w3.org , is the creator of http://www.w3.org/Home/Lassila."  </s>
<s> If you look at the equivalent graph in the M&amp;S, there isn't any "variable" to represent that "individual"; there's just a resource without an identifier (if anything is "unknown", it's the *identifier* of the resource; but there is a distinct resource you're talking about, not an unknown).  </s>
<s> However, if you wrote this in logic, you'd say something roughly like "There exists a [resource] x such that name(x, Ora Lassila) and email(x, lassila@w3.org) and creator(http://www.w3.org/Home/Lassila, x)"  </s>
<s> Here, the resource is represented by an existentially quantified variable x. Skolemization essentially says (ignoring scope issues that don't come up in this example) you can give the thing referred to by the existentially quantified variable a distinct name, use that name, and delete the quantifier.  </s>
<s> So if I give that resource a URI (or a gensym), or it already has one, I've essentially Skolemized it.  </s>
<s> In both cases, though, we're not talking about an "unknown" in the sense of an equation: the resource isn't unknown (I'm asserting one exists; it's this one right here), even though its identifier may be.  </s>
<s> A more faithful representation of the situation we have in RDF might be to say that there is a "built-in" predicate "URI" that we can use to specify the URI of those resources that have them.  </s>
<s> Then, the above expression represents the version where the resource is anonymous, and the next example in the M&amp;S where the resource is given a URI would be: "There exists a [resource] x such that name(x, Ora Lassila) and email(x, lassila@w3.org) and creator(http://www.w3.org/Home/Lassila, x) and URI(x, http://www.w3.org/staffid/85740) which simply adds the additional piece of information.  </s>
<s> What I've just said is based on the interpretation of RDF as making statements in an EC logic; but any quantification is *implicit* (so is the conjunction).  </s>
<s> I think that's the only sense in which we have quantification in RDF.  </s>
<s> We don't have *explicit* existential quantification (Sergey noted, and I agree, that this would be out of scope), and we don't have universal quantification in any form.  </s>
<s> We also don't have free variables (also out of scope, IMO).  </s>
<s> This isn't the same as a resource with an unknown identifier; since we don't have *explicit* variables in RDF, we'd need to invent a special notation for them.  </s>
<s> We'd also need to define an interpretation for them, an obvious one being as a placeholder in a query expression.  </s>
<s> E.g., if someone wrote just "name(x, Ora Lassila) and email(x, lassila@w3.org) and creator(http://www.w3.org/Home/Lassila, x)" this could be interpreted as "return any bindings for x such that these assertions were in the fact base" (as it would, say, in Prolog).  </s>
<s> Note, though, that x might be bound to one thing, a whole collection of things, or nothing.  </s>

<s> And 2 centimes from me...  </s>
<s> The sense of the Skolemization of the `unknown' resource is surely that is is given an identification which is in the `global' scope.  </s>
<s> The space in which it is said to exist (in the normal understanding of Ora's example) is the entire web.  </s>
<s> The `unknown resource' isn't a free variable in any sense.  </s>
<s> It is existentially quantified by the RDF segment but to Skolemize it you have to give it a global identification.  </s>
<s> Thus one imagines it has a real but unknown URI only because of one's intuitive understanding of the need to remove the existential quantification.  </s>
<s> It begs the question of how you would form this unknown URI.  </s>
<s> The essence of the Skolemization (do I have to type that word again?) is that the identifier be `new', which is what URIs do for yer every time.  </s>
<s> Not particularly clear, I guess: I'm trying to express the natural feeling that a `definition by properties' gives an anonynous resource a claim to a global identification.  </s>
<s> This may be the intuitive reading of the Skolemization process in the web scope.  </s>
