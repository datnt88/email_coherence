Hello, In the 31 March document [1], checkpoint 4.1.1 reads: Ensure that the software may be installed in a device-independent manner using any supported input and output devices. 
And checkpoint 4.2.1 reads Ensure that all functionalities offered by the user agent interface are available through all supported input devices. 
These include the installation procedure, access to documentation, and software configuration. 
The only reason 4.2.1 doesn't entirely subsume 4.1.1 is that 4.1.1 refers to output devices (covered partially by 4.2.2). 
I propose deleting 4.1.1.

W3C Web Accessibility Initiative http://www.w3.org/WAI MIT/LCS - 545 Technology sq., Cambridge MA, 02139, USA At the checkpoint level, I think it is better to separate installation from repeat use. 
You can have a common guideline about all user actions required to install, use and maintain... (check EITAAC report for sample language and cite at least in draft) http://trace.wisc.edu/docs/eitaac/ . 
In the dominant pattern of commercial practice the installer is a separate program, not one of the functions of the program. 
This colors public perceptions, and we should talk in publicly-understood concepts where we can. 
This was a point where at least one vendor spokesperson drew a line: making a distinction between repeat use where access support was obvious to them and install transactions which are a "one time thing" and were perceived as less meritorious of the necessary investment. 
If we wish overcome that perception, we will have to spell it out in two checks; not throw a blanket over them. 
Al Hi Al, One way to avoid the blanket is to enumerate the important cases in the general checkpoint. 
Something like the following: Ensure that all functionalities offered by the user agent interface are available through all supported input devices. 
This includes installation, access to documentation, and software configuration. 
Then, to repeat the discussion in the rationale section and techniques document.

Don't get me wrong. 
For my own use, I distinctly prefer a short (Occam's razor) list of powerful principles that generate all the necessary cases. 
I spend a lot of my life railing againsf over-atomization that destroys the gestalt. 
But this document has to communicate to lots of people and not just me. 
The popular definition of a checklist item is something you can or would normally observe by itself. 
On balance I think it is better to show the unity in a theory section and split these particular two in the checklist for the reasons I stated. 
This is just an indication of my individual opinion on something I regard as a "better" not a "showstopper" distinction.
