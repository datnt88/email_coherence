I have now verified that Amaya does not experience the exposure problem with an amaya.css 
file containing BODY { magnification : 0 } but the problem occurs with BODY { magnification : 1 } or larger numbers. 
Once again, this is a condition where Amaya claims that it is finished but the page contents does not display. 
Anyone else seeing this problem?

Ok, this is a bug, we are tracking it ... This should not appear on Linux machines. 
On other platforms one should avoid the bug by recompiling amaya after removing the pair of #ifdef linux and the corresponding #endif from Thot/amaya/css.c in function ApplyFinalStyle around line 1550 ... Daniel
