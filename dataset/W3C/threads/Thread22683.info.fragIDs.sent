<s> I can't speak to the intent of the API designers, but I've always seen it interpreted as "there is no set operation for 'attributes'".  </s>
<s> This makes more sense to me; setting the list would be a fairly expensive operation to make available through what may be syntactically innocuous in some language bindings.  </s>
<s> For example, this would appear as someNode.attributes  </s>
<s> = someAttributesList in Python; most Python programmers will consider this a "cheap" operation.  </s>
<s> Actually, I'm not sure how else to get ahold of the children of a node in a general fashion, so this behavior would make the DOM nearly read-only in practice.  </s>
<s> What I *would* like is a way to determine that a DOM object is read-only; this should be exposed at the Node level (to see if a  </s>
<s> particular Node is read-only, perhaps because it is a descendent of an EntityReference), at the Document level (some particular Document is read-only), or at the implementation level (the impl.  </s>
<s> only supports read-only operation).  </s>
<s> This would be useful at least for developing a test suite to determine if an arbitrary implementation is operating as expected.  </s>
<s> There are enough nuances that a thorough test would need to be conditionalized for that more introspective features would be useful for.  </s>
<s> A set of standard "feature" names would be useful for this.  </s>
<s> Another would be persistence beyond a process, as we're starting to see more DOMs built on top of relational databases or other non-transient data structures.  </s>

<s> Yes. Whether the NamedNodeMap is readonly (your second question) is a seperate issue, and is gated by whether the Element itself is readonly (eg because it's within the value of an EntityReference).  </s>

<s> Currently, the only officially-blessed condition under which nodes become readonly is when they're within the value of an EntityReference.  </s>
<s> There is some interest in coming up with a more official definition of read-only documents or subtrees -- it's on the Open Isses list -- but at this time it's unclear how much of that might or might not be included in DOM Level 3; it's not currently one of our top priorities, though the XSLT folks have inquired about it since they want a way to say that their input tree Must Not be altered during stylesheet processing.  </s>
