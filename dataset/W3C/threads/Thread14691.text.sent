I suggested the addition of content modes to Gudeline 4.1 as a possible way of dealing with the vowel mark problem in Hebrew and Arabic, which was brought to our attention by Lisa Seeman (vowel marks are required to support screen reading in user agents, and for accessibility to people with limited reading ability.) If there is no objection, I would like to see Gudeline 4.1 updated as follows: 4.1 Choose content modes, languages, API's, and protocols that support the use of these guidelines. 
Content modes (e.g. Hebrew with and without vowel marks,) markup languages, multimedia formats, software interface standards, etc., vary in their support of accessibility. 
When choosing which technologies and content modes to use, consider how easy it is apply these guidelines. 
Where feasible, favor content modes and technologies that: * support assistive technology in user agents; * permit equivalents to be associated with or synchronized with auditory, graphical, and multimedia content; * allow the logical structure of the content to be defined independently of presentation; * support device-independence; * are documented in published specifications and can be implemented by user agent and assistive technology developers.

Context matters. 
Seldom does *anything* have only one cause. 
Yep, this makes sense to mme.

In the line: should say: * permit equivalents to be associated with or synchronized with auditory, graphics, multi-media and text content; Text needs an equivalent as much as other content does.
