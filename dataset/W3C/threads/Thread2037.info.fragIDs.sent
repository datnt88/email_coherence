<s> Well, it's really a question of what should a proxy do when it receives a syntactically invalid Request-URI.  </s>
<s> My preference is that it make no changes whatsoever to the path part of the Request-URI when it forwards the request.  </s>
<s> However, this would mean the proxy would be sending a non-compliant request, which is also bad.  </s>
<s> I guess that the best thing to include is a paragraph saying A proxy may encode portions of the Request-URI prior to forwarding the message if and only if such encoding is necessary to make the message compliant with HTTP.  </s>
<s> Where possible, proxies should attempt  </s>
<s> to use the same characters in the forwarded Request-URI as were received from the client, since some servers improperly apply special semantics to characters outside the "reserved" set.  </s>
<s> Note, however, that "#" is never allowed in a Request-URI.  </s>

<s> This language doesn't really go together.  </s>
<s> "If and only if" implies necessity, at least to any mathematically oriented readers, so it ought to be "must", not "may", or else you should get rid of the "if" part.  </s>
<s> --Shel  </s>
<s> I think that it is a question of what people can encode into URIs.  </s>
<s> URIs do not specify a canonical form so that there can be several URIs which logically mean the same thing.  </s>
<s> If we are clear on the "meaning" part then two syntactic variants of the same URI should be interchangeable.  </s>
<s> If something breaks because of this problem then it is something which relied upon a syntactic variation and was therefore broken.  </s>
<s> For example I might embed a href="http://foo.bar$"  </s>
<s> into a document where $ is some ambiguous character.  </s>
<s> I might know that the xyz browser will canonicalize differently if the URI comes from the browser or from the bookmark file and have one of those $5million venture capital "companies" wrapped arround this hack (don't laugh I've seen this type of thing more than once).  </s>
<s> Personally I think that trying to provide support for such constructs is ill advised.  </s>
<s> It is likely to close up options down the line.  </s>
<s> In  </s>
<s> particular I'm thinking of HTTP-NG here.  </s>
<s> I can think of many reasons why a proxy might choose to canonicalize URIs internally, cache matches for one.  </s>
<s> If one considers the action of a caching proxy I think that canonicalization of URIs in passed on requests is likely to be highly desirable.  </s>
<s> Since Larry reports that there are already proxies doing this sort of transformation I think it best to leave things as they are but include a warning to state that problems might occur.  </s>
<s> Phill  </s>
<s> Absolutely! A proxy that did not return the cached document http://foo/%7Euser in response to a requset for http://foo/~user is not behaving efficiently.  </s>
<s> So proxies need to canonicalise the URL for the cache key.  </s>
<s> Hence it would be confusing if the proxy did not use this canonicalised URL in requests it issued.  </s>
<s> This is why the proxy in Apache 1.1 beta does a lot of URL rewriting; not only %xx - char as appropiate, but also and (perhaps dubiously) http://foo/bar?  </s>

<s> HTTP/1.1 Authorization: uri="/public.txt",  </s>
<s> nonce="deadbeef", response="0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef" If the server checks the authorization header and its URI, but then uses the URI from the Request-URI in the request line, the whole exercise will have been wasted.  </s>
<s> And if proxies are allowed to munge the URI in unknown ways, the server can't compare the request-URI with the uri in the Authorization header.  </s>
<s> The Digest draft should say the the server MUST use the URI from the Authorization header, as that is the only one that has been authenticated.  </s>

<s> So proxies need to canonicalise the URL for the cache key.  </s>
<s> Hence it would be confusing if the proxy did not use this canonicalised URL in requests it issued.  </s>
<s> I think it would be more "confusing" if by canonicalizing a URL the proxy turned it into something that identified a different resource.  </s>
<s> I.e., we should be quite cautious about pursuing "efficiency" here.  </s>
<s> Efficiency is great as long as it gets the right answers.  </s>
<s> This is why the proxy in Apache 1.1 beta does a lot of URL rewriting; not only %xx - char as appropiate, but also This might be appropriate in some cases, but it's clearly not appropriate for every instance of %xx.  </s>
<s> RFC1738 specifically states, for example, The character "#" is unsafe and should always be encoded because it is used in World Wide Web and in other systems to delimit a URL from a fragment/anchor identifier that might follow it.  </s>
<s> The character "%" is unsafe because it is used for encodings of other characters.  </s>
<s> so a proxy that converted to would be non-compliant with RFC1738.  </s>
<s> I'd like to see a specific citation to a standard or even an I-D that makes this a compliant transformation.  </s>
<s> In draft-ietf-http-v11-spec-01.txt, for example, I find this BNF: URI = ( absoluteURI | relativeURI ) [ "#" fragment ] absoluteURI = scheme ":" *( uchar | reserved ) which suggests that the URI need not end in "/".  </s>
<s> and (perhaps dubiously) http://foo/bar?  </s>
<s> - http://foo/bar Very dubiously, especially since we also have a well-understood heuristic that caches do not store responses to GETs with "?" in the URL.  </s>
<s> If you have a series of caching proxies in the path, and the first one does this transformation (dropping the "?"), the second one will not realize that the GET is a potentially non-cachable query.  </s>
<s> -Jeff  </s>
<s> I would say we have to let this pass.  </s>
<s> Principally because of the large number of proxies out there which already do this.  </s>
<s> There is a principled reasoning behind this.  </s>
<s> We distinguish a proxy or gateway from a tunnel by the level at which the agent acts.  </s>
<s> Tunnels act purely at the syntactic level.  </s>
<s> Proxies and gateways act at the semantic level.  </s>
<s> We permit a proxy to perform any action provided it is semantically neutral and in addition may permit a number of semantic transformations.  </s>
<s> [Another area to consider is using URLs as a subliminal channel or a basis for steganography.  </s>
<s> The URL above effectively allows us to encode 0s and 1s.  </s>
<s> There may well be cases where we don't want that to happen.  </s>
<s> This is a fairly pointless nit to pick but I thought I would get in first] The reason why the semantic transformation stuff matters is that a firewall proxy may want to strip out all header lines it does not understand, effectively down-rating the connection to HTTP/1.0 or some other known safe subset.  </s>
<s> This requires a complete parse of the request and regeneration of the passed on request.  </s>
<s> The parser may wish to specifically check URLs for strict validity to avoid possible holes occurring with illegal escape sequences.  </s>
<s> Thus it is a legitimate proceedure to parse out the URL, cannonicalise and regenerate.  </s>
<s> I think that if we want strict syntactic netrality in a proxy we have to use the wrapped method.  </s>
<s> Phill  </s>
<s> Personally, I don't think proxies *should* rewrite URLs, and that origin servers should decide on logical equivalence and report it.  </s>
<s> This is the only way that servers that are not 'multihomed' but happen to have multiple DNS entries can be declared to be equivalent.  </s>
<s> Otherwise, we have to define equivalence for URLs unambiguously, and I'm reluctant to engage in that because it's likely we'll get it wrong.  </s>
<s> In the example I quoted, I showed GET http://foo.com/test#frob  </s>
<s> HTTP/1.0 turned into GET /test%23frob HTTP/1.0 but this wasn't actually the example; it was a proxy that turned GET http://foo.com/test!place  </s>
<s> HTTP/1.0 into GET /test%21place HTTP/1.0  </s>
<s> In general, I'm inclined to agree.  </s>
<s> IF the proxy believes the request to be a protocol violation which would require re-writing, it should instead reject the request with appropriate diagnostic insight.  </s>
<s> BUT the current specs indicate that: should become: If I understand they wording.  </s>
<s> I would not that at least one browser in common use does the opposite.  </s>
