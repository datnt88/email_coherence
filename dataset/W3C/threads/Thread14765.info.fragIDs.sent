<s> Hello all, Congratulations on the publication of Requirements for WCAG 2.0 [1].  </s>
<s> I wish the group continued progress.  </s>
<s> I have a couple of comments below.  </s>
<s> - Ian [1] http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-wcag2-req-20020426 1) Section 6: "Therefore, WCAG 2.0 must not completely change the definition of accessible content."  </s>
<s> The WCAG 1.0 defines "accessible [content]" to be: "Content is accessible when it may be used by someone with a disability."  </s>
<s> This seems pretty immutable to me.  </s>
<s> Perhaps what section 6 should say is "Therefore, what WCAG 2.0 requires and what WCAG 1.0 requires must not differ substantially."  </s>
<s> As usual, I prefer avoiding the "definition" of accessible content and instead leaning on the set of requirements that makes up WCAG 1.0 or 2.0.  </s>
<s> I think it's quite sufficient to say: a) WCAG X defines a set of requirements that, if met, will reduce barriers to accessibility for some users.  </s>
<s> b) Therefore, conformance to WCAG X is very likely to improve accessibility for many users.  </s>
<s> c) Conformance is not a guarantee of accessibility.  </s>
<s> d) "Accessible" means can be used by a person with a disability.  </s>
<s> 2) Appendix A, Section "N": The entries that are deleted due to changes in structure (e.g., N1, N3, ...) are not useful because there is no context and no links.  </s>
<s> I suggest just getting rid of them unless there's some background why they were there in the first place.  </s>
<s> At least put the titles of the things that were deleted; as is there is no useful information.  </s>
<s> 3) Appendix A, C4: "Should not be able to claim conformance by disability."  </s>
<s> I suggest that this be merged with C5. Please clarify in the document why conformance based on disability is considered a bad thing.  </s>
<s> 4) Appendix A, M1: "It should be possible to use metadata to claim conformance".  </s>
<s> All claims are (represented in) metadata (whether in English, HTML, RDF, etc.).  </s>
<s> I'm not sure what this requirement means.  </s>
<s> The next entry (M2) hints at machine-readable formats, which is what I thought M1 was about.  </s>
<s> I suggest merging M1 and M2 into something like: "Claimants should be able to represent their conformance claims using either a (primarily) human-readable format or a machine-readable format.  </s>
<s> The Working Group does not yet know whether a machine-readable format should always be required."  </s>
<s> I suggest strongly *not* requiring a machine-readable format for every claim.  </s>
<s> The TAG has been discussing whether all namespace documents should include machine-readable or human-readable information or both.  </s>
<s> Since there are many applications when one or the other is preferable, the TAG is making no absolute requirement (for now); they are simply indicating the advantages of each.  </s>
<s> 5) Appendix A, M4: "It should be possible for authors to decide not to implement a particular checkpoint."  </s>
<s> This is very much in the UAAG 1.0 model: indicate what you don't do in the claim.  </s>
<s> However, it is not possible to exclude a checkpoint "arbitrarily" and still conform.  </s>
<s> Please clarify in M4 that excluding a checkpoint based on author's decision means the content doesn't conform.  </s>
<s> (Unless that's not what's intended, in which case I don't understand how conformance will work.) 6) Appendix A, S1: "can be obtained by visiting the same URI".  </s>
<s> This seems unnecessarily strict.  </s>
<s> This implies that content negotiation is required, and I don't think that's necessary (I oppose this requirement).  </s>
<s> I think that if there are 10 versions of content, and all 10 links are available from some home page, that meets the accessibility need.  </s>
<s> If you really mean that content negotiation is required, please provide very clear rationale.  </s>

<s> RE SUGGESTION #1 - THAT DEFINITION OF ACCESSIBILITY IS NOT REALLY CHANGING.  </s>
<s> - agree completely.  </s>
<s> From top to bottom.  </s>
<s> Except I make the bracketed edits.  </s>
<s> a) WCAG X defines a set of requirements that, if met, will reduce barriers to accessibility for some users.  </s>
<s> [CHANGE "SOME" TO "MANY..." OR "MOST USERS WITH DISABILITIES".] b) Therefore, conformance to WCAG X is very likely to improve accessibility for many users.  </s>
<s> [ CHANGE "IS VERY LIKELY TO" TO "WILL"] c) Conformance is not a guarantee of accessibility.  </s>
<s> d) "Accessible" means can be used by a person with a disability.  </s>
<s> [PERHAPS - ADD THE WORD EFFECTIVELY AFTER THE WORD USED]  </s>
<s> RE; SUGGESTION #2 - REMOVING NUMBERS FOR DELETED ITEMS FROM APPENDIX We cannot change the numbering without scrambling the record of discussion in the archives.  </s>
<s> So we just leave them like this.  </s>
<s> True it provides no information - but if there is no harm, then I think we should leave them because renumbering would remove information from the others (when renumbered) and deleting the numbers leaves one wondering if something got dropped by accident.  </s>
<s> Make sense now?  </s>
<s> Or do you still think they should be removed?  </s>
<s> RE SUGGESTION #3 - EXPLAINING WHY CONFORMANCE BY DISABILITY IS NOT GOOD.  </s>
<s> I guess we could.  </s>
<s> I'll make a note to discuss this as an issue in the conformance section.  </s>
<s> RE SUGGESTION #4 and #5 ABOUT COMBINING AND REWORDING First, these are not requirements.  </s>
<s> They are just statements of consensus.  </s>
<s> We do not spend a lot of time wordsmithing them since they are not the deliverable.  </s>
<s> Only things we agreed to and wrote down for guidance and communication.  </s>
<s> (and memory).  </s>
<s> Often the statements referred to are arrived at during successive discussions.  </s>
<s> So they are piecemeal sometimes.  </s>
<s> Unless there is a problem we usually don't go back and clean up grammar or style.  </s>
<s> If you see a problem - then we need to address these.  </s>
<s> Otherwise they are just internal communication items that we share externally so people can track what we are thinking.  </s>
<s> Is there a problem with these?  </s>
<s> if so please repost.  </s>
<s> Thanks  </s>
<s> RE SUGGESTION #6 - CAN BE OBTAINED FROM THE SAME URI Your suggestion of having all the versions available from the same home  </s>
<s> page does satisfy this item.  </s>
<s> As does having an "accessible version"  </s>
<s> link off of an inaccessible page - as long as the link is accessible.  </s>
<s> So I'm not sure you do disagree.  </s>
<s> Do you?  </s>
<s> As always, thanks for the comments.  </s>

<s> [snipped editorial suggestions on #1]  </s>
<s> I still think they should be removed since there's no information except somehow if you've followed the pre-history of the document.  </s>
<s> So presumably, this information is only for WG participants.  </s>
<s> How about a note in the next version that says "The following issues were subsumed: Nx, Ny, .... Please refer to the WG issues list (or archives or wherever this information is found) for information about these issues."  </s>
<s> Otherwise they distracted me more than if some numbers had been skipped.  </s>
<s> [snip]  </s>
<s> Both of my suggestions #4 and #5 reflect my confusion about statements in the requirements documents, and therefore I do think those statements should be reviewed.  </s>
<s> The metadata comments confused me.  </s>
<s> The comment about being  </s>
<s> able to choose to not satisfy a checkpoint concerned me since it seems inconsistent with conformance (unless it isn't inconsistent, but that's not clear from the document).  </s>
<s> Here's what I think I understand: a) For some users, alternatives will be necessary.  </s>
<s> b) In terms of WCAG 2.0, it doesn't matter whether the alternatives reside on the client-side or server-side, as long as the user can get them.  </s>
<s> What is confusing is the expression "at the same URI".  </s>
<s> I first read this to mean "by dereferencing a single URI" (which implied content negotiation) rather than as "there must be a single Web page that includes links to all alternatives" (or something similar).  </s>
<s> Thus, I think clarification is necessary.  </s>
<s> Meanwhile, if I were to rate the requirement, I would give it a P2.  </s>
<s> It seems like a P1 that the alternatives exist (and perhaps I should have to provide URIs to all alternatives in a conformance claim).  </s>
<s> It seems like a P2 to have access to all alternatives from a single location.  </s>
