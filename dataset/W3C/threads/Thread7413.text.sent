Would it be a good idea to add 'execute' rights to the ACL protocol, to indicate whether a principal is allowed to execute a resource (e.g. CGI scripts). 
Or should this be implemented as live properties? 
Seems more appropriate in the ACL protocol to me.

This seems to be fairly useful -- of course, the ACL protocol does allow for extension of the access control rights by adding XML namespacse, if the WG as a whole doesn't want to do "execute" rights. 
Any other input on this one?
