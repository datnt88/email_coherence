<s> There was one more comment/question I meant to include, Ian.  </s>
<s> The article really does not include any concrete code examples for users.  </s>
<s> Was that your intent?  </s>
<s> - Mike  </s>
<s> To be honest, when I wrote this, I didn't have much intent in any direction.  </s>
<s> Now, the purpose of the piece has become more focused: education.  </s>
<s> Therefore, examples would be appropriate so I'll try to incorporate a couple into the next draft.  </s>
