<s> I think you are muddled because you are confusing some browsers (somewhat flawed) rendering of alt with it's purpose.  </s>
<s> NS2 (I think that was the first) introduced the practice of displaying the alt text for an image as a toolTip/Balloon-Help.  </s>
<s> This wasn't a terribly bad idea, for while alt should be equivalent to the image itself (as much as possible) the toolTip idea handled  </s>
<s> cases where poor authoring meant information could be gained from the  </s>
<s> alt text that could not be gained elsewhere.  </s>
<s> It was also of use to some partially-sighted users who wanted to see pictures, but who had difficulty with text-as-images (and in the case of some images that would include those of us with 20/20 or 20/20 corrected as well!).  </s>
<s> The problem with this is that the best text for a toolTip isn't necessarily, or even all that often, the best text to replace an image if only text is available for rendering (as it is on Lynx, screen-readers, and Braille devices).  </s>
<s> Since most designers (web-pages stopped being "authored" and started being "designed" around this period as well) think, intentionally or not, primarily about users of graphical browsers, they started thinking of alt as the toolTip text, not as ALTernative text.  </s>
<s> Others didn't like the toolTips (and they are annoying when you don't need them) and would deliberately leave out alt text.  </s>
<s> Since there is a place for toolTips, or other means to elaborate on possibly confusing objects, as well as for textual alternatives for images the title attribute was created.  </s>
<s> The purpose of the title attribute is to provide additional information, whereas alt provides the same information in a different way.  </s>
<s> The obvious way to render this on graphical browsers working in windowed environments is as a toolTip, this is recommended by the W3C (but not mandated IIRC) and IE4+ does this, although if no toolTip is specified it will use the alt-text for reasons of backwards-compatibility.  </s>
<s> No, title is very useful, but serves a completely different purpose to the alt text.  </s>
<s> Consider the following: a href="/" img src="logo.gif"  </s>
<s> alt="Company Name" title="Go to home page" / /a Assuming the logo is "Company Name" in a particular format then if you can't get the image you may well wish to display the name to have a branding effect, and to head the page with that name.  </s>
<s> Our logo is following the convention that top-left logos link to the home page, and the title provides a cue to this behaviour, on IE4+ this will be displayed as a toolTip for the image.  </s>
<s> The sighted user of IE4+ doesn't need to be told what the image says (if the image is reasonably large), but may gain from the *additional* information in the title.  </s>
<s> The text-based user gets the logo rendered as well as possible through text.  </s>
<s> They may also have some way of receiving the title information as well.  </s>
<s> (One thing about this though is that if there isn't another clear way to get to the home page on that page then the alt text probably should include that information so people don't get orphaned deep in the site).  </s>

<s> AG:: Here is your essential contribution.  </s>
<s> You have users who still need the ALT information first, even 'though the  </s>
<s> image has been seen.  </s>
<s> To back up the User Agent Accessibility Guidelines, we need to document that this case actually happens.  </s>
<s> The conventional behavior, of writing an annotation and not a title in TITLE, and showing the additional information, not the naming or summary information as the transient display when the user mouses over, is predicated on the premise that the user has got the idea that is stated in the ALT by viewing the image.  </s>
<s> This is not so for all.  </s>
<s> There is language in the User Agent Accessibility Guidelines ensuring that the user has access to all content, regardless of what the author thought was useful, where need be.  </s>
<s> What this is is another use case we need to work up as a scenario and User Agent techniuqes entry where for your clients, there is a User Agent mode setting (policy) which a) displays ALT in preference to TITLE onMouseOver, and pushes the TITLE into the head of the context menu which is the next logical 'pull' protocol place to get at it.  </s>
<s> This is your thread, so do you wish to re-post a reply to this message to UA and not IG seeking partners to implement and evaluate this technique?  </s>
<s> Can it be done in a script as a prototype?  </s>
<s> That has to do with the way the browesr and the script handle onMouseOver that Jim Ley will know and I don't know.  </s>
<s> Al PS: Partly you are still muddled because the logical model of the format is muddled.  </s>
<s> Sorry.  </s>
<s> It is on file as a problem area in HTML, and we don't have a solution at the moment.  </s>
<s> A working UA technique that at least shows how it can work would be useful to the HTML folks in planning a migration to a model that works for both authors and user agents following different user policies.  </s>
<s> [sorry, the search.w3.org service is down, and I don't have this FAQ bookmarked.  </s>

<s> The problem as I see it is that authors and users are confused by the various ways that user agents [browsers] and assistive technology render the title and alt attributes.  </s>
<s> Some users ask for it in a certain order because that is the order that their assistive technology renders it.  </s>
<s> Other users ask for it in a different order.  </s>
<s> Sighted users see it another way.  </s>
<s> Sighted users with graphics off see it another way.  </s>
<s> Lynx users see it another way.  </s>
<s> HPR users see it another way.  </s>
<s> I believe it is spec'd correctly alt is the alternative longdesc is the description title is additional information  </s>
<s> The user agent has the responsibility to render all three, but not necessarily at the same time.  </s>
<s> HPR's default renders the alt first, if no alt, it renders the title, if no title it renders the source URL.  </s>
<s> HPR will render the title in addition to the alt if the users asks for more information about the item; which is similar to a sighted user moving the mouse over the image to get additional information.  </s>
<s> Internet Explorer 4 I think and definitely 5 and above renders the title attribute as the tool tip first, if no title attribute, then it renders the alt attribute, if no alt attribute it doesn't render a tool tip.  </s>
<s> If the IE 5 users doesn't move the mouse over the item, no tool tip is rendered.  </s>
<s> It was reported to me that Mozilla (Netscape 5) only renders the title as the tool tip and never the alt attribute in a tool tip.  </s>
<s> I believe the Lynx browser should add a user interface method to allow the user to ask for more information about the item.  </s>
<s> I've heard the argument that the HPR or Lynx user may not know to ask for more information - that's true, but the sighted mouse user doesn't know to move the mouse over the item to get additional information either.  </s>
<s> It would be useful for the WCAG techniques and Education &amp; Outreach working group to address all the various levels of support and recommend the best approach.  </s>
<s> I believe IE and HPR are two browsers that do it correctly per the HTML, WCAG, and UAAG specs.  </s>
