<s> Jeremy  </s>
<s> Re: You made substantial editoral comments that I'm mostly not dealing with here, primarily in section 2, which is new, and I expected that.  </s>
<s> I indeed hoped for corrections and help in improving the words.  </s>
<s> So this mail just responds to the "Technical errors or must fix comments."  </s>
<s> which I see as the priority to deal with, some of which I need further clarification on before I can understand them and then decide how to address them.  </s>
<s> 2 An XML syntax for RDF [[(Informative)]] I see it as both informative - it tells people how the syntax works and normative in that it defines such terms as Node Elements, Property Elements and so on.  </s>
<s> I think I've seen support for keeping it this way, with editorial improvements since it is brand new text.  </s>
<s> 2.1 [[I see it as a bug that you use the term URIs above without any qualification or additional text.  </s>
<s> ]] Agreed.  </s>
<s> I am going to change URI to URI-reference throughout, point to something in RDF-CONCEPTS 2.5 [[False: rdf:type may take a typed or untyped literal or a blank node.  </s>
<s> Rephrasing this para to allow for non-standard usage of rdf:type is hard work.  </s>
<s> The text also does not account for the case where two property elements have different xml:lang and so can not both be compounded on the parent node]] I will rephrase.  </s>
<s> 2.7 "RDF/XML uses XML's xml:lang attribute as defined by 2.12 Language Identification of XML 1.0 [XML] to allow the identification of content language.  </s>
<s> This can be added to any XML element" [[False: XML WG get to specify XML and they say that xml:lang must be declared in the DTD; RDF/XML permits xml:lang on any element.]]  </s>
<s> I will replace with: "RDF/XML permits the use of xml:lang attribute as defined by 2.12 Language Identification of XML 1.0 [XML] to allow the identification of content language.  </s>
<s> This can be used on any node element or property element."  </s>
<s> 2.8 "the object node labelled with XML content beginning a:Collection" [[False: suggest change example.]]  </s>
<s> (Apart from labelled, which I will remove) I don't understand this problem, you will have to explain further what is wrong here and tell me what is needed in an example.  </s>
<s> 2.11 Omitting Blank Nodes - rdf:parseType="Resource" "This is done by putting an attribute on the containing property element rdf:parseType="Resource" ..." [[ The jena code that uses this production to serialize RDF as XML does not do it this way; hence a normnative "This is done" is unacceptable since it makes Jena non conformant.  </s>
<s> Even an informative "This is done" is difficult to swallow, given that the only code that we know of that does this, does not do it this way.  </s>
<s> The method used is that you examine the productions you might use, you see whether the graph you are trying to serialized meets the preconditions and then you expand the production.  </s>
<s> Doing it the way you suggest is an interesting, but very slow exercise.]]  </s>
<s> I will replace with "This can be done" since 2.12 also gives another way to omit blank nodes and this abbreviation remains optional.  </s>
<s> (I'll remove "the difficult to read" sentence) 2.12 Omitting Blank Nodes - Property Attributes on an empty Property Element "If all the property elements on a blank node have string literal values (or at most one is rdf:type) " [[False: the actual constraint is significantly more complicated.  </s>
<s> variations in xml:lang and non-standard usage of rdf:type need to be taken into account, also you have forgotten the at most one occurrence of any property]] "... , these can be abbreviated by moving them to be property attributes on the containing property element which is made an empty element."  </s>
<s> I will try to reword and handle these constraints.  </s>
<s> Something like "If all of the property elements on a blank node element have string literal values with the same in-scope xml:lang value (if present) AND each of these property elements appears at most once AND there is at most one rdf:type element with a URI-reference object node, then all of these property elements ..." (or list the constraints in a ul since this sentence is rather convoluted) 2.14 Abbreviating URIs - rdf:ID and xml:base [[and rdf:ID]] Yes.  </s>
<s> Also rdf:bagID with xml:base "This provides an additional check since the same name can only appear once in a single RDF/XML document " [[this is not what you say below, where you permit reuse of a name with a different xml:base]] Yes, I'll put in a phrase that the IDs are per xml:base (where did we get this from?  </s>
<s> All I can see is (3) the scope of xml:base attributes should be taken into account when checking for duplicate rdf:ID values -- http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-xml-base 2.16 Closed Collections - rdf:parseType="Collection" "The [[value]] is the collection of nodes given inside" [[I don't know what value is meant to mean here, but I can't think of a meaning of value that makes this sentence true.]]  </s>
<s> Given there is still debate over if the RDF MT will give some entailments for these (yes?  </s>
<s> no?), I put down something which you are obviously unhappy with for various reasons.  </s>
<s> DAML+OIL defines it even worse, just giving an example without saying what it does.  </s>
<s> Apart from saying "this RDF/XML gives these N-triples", I need more help with the wording to use here.  </s>
<s> Re: closed: [[the WEBONT folks indicated that removing daml:collection would be a problem for them.  </s>
<s> As I understand things, the key requirements are: o a compact and relatively conventient xml syntax o a way to represent a closed collection, i.e. our present understanding of issue * rdfms-seq-representation Amongst the possible solutions, the ones I can see are: o bless daml:collection as defined as part of RDF -- http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Apr/0039.html which is what we did.  </s>
<s> 2.17 Reifying Statements - rdf:bagID and rdf:ID [[ once again you are neglecting the possibility of a change of base URI]] I'll add that reference for rdf:bagID 5.1 The RDF Namespace [[This "(no concepts in the graph)" is not what I thought we had agreed.  </s>
<s> I thought it was that if you use these terms in a graph, then: (a) an application may issue warnings and (b) the graph cannot be serialized in RDF/XML.]]  </s>
<s> I've removed that phrase from my later drafts and replaced with: Syntax names - not concepts Class names Property names Resource names -- http://ilrt.org/discovery/2001/07/rdf-syntax-grammar/#section-Namespace  </s>
<s> Although really the split could just be Syntax names, other names.  </s>
<s> 5.2 Identifiers [[Within RDF/XML, ]] Yes.  </s>
<s> "Blank node Identifiers (labeling nodes) These are given local identifiers in the N-Triples serialization which MUST match the name production in N-Triples."  </s>
<s> [[This MUST is much too strong.  </s>
<s> As I remember it, rdf:nodeID can expand to an NC_NAME (from namespaces).  </s>
<s> This is substantially more generous than name in NTriples e.g. permitting ihWhatsGoingOn .  </s>
<s> The treatment of mapping everything to Ntriples and then to the graph is not a requirement of RDF/XML and so there is no requirement to use Ntriple or to meet this constraint.  </s>
<s> ARP does not behave like this.  </s>
<s> The treatment of rdf:nodeID has to be modified to turn the unicode attribute value into a unique US-ASCII string for ntriple; but this ugliness is a feature of this document, not a feature of RDF/XML; and that needs to be clear.]]  </s>
<s> I can't convert this comment into an obvious change.  </s>
<s> If I require N-Triples to explain how RDF/XML maps to the RDF graph, and N-Triples has syntax restrictions, what do I fix?  </s>
<s> (Delete Note: yes) 5.4 Constraints constraint-nodeID "The names used as values of rdf:nodeID come from a set of names that are independent of those of rdf:ID and rdf:bagID.  </s>
<s> The syntax of the names must match the rdf-id production [[There is no constraint here.  </s>
<s> Any matching use of the production is valid.  </s>
<s> This subsection must be deleted, it is currently only a potential source of confusion.  </s>
<s> e.g. on first reading I thought you were saying that rdf:nodeID="foo" and rdf:ID="foo" could not both be used in the same doc.]]  </s>
<s> These words are all directly from WG decisions and reflect what was asked of us to clarify 1) The set of names (values of rdf:nodeID) are independent.  </s>
<s> 2) The syntax matches the same syntax as rdf-id Somewhere we have to say 1) - it could be in the rdf:nodeID production, but that might be too hidden away.  </s>
<s> 2) may depend on what you propose as the resolution of your previous comment.  </s>
<s> I guess I agree it is not a constraint.  </s>
<s> It is also unclear if you mean delete all of 5.4.  </s>
<s> If that is the case, then the restictions on the sets of names of rdf:ID, rdf:bagID would have to move somewhere else such as in the grammar productions.  </s>
<s> They previously were there but that's what Peter Patel-Schneider originally made his comment was about, and asked that they be pulled out.  </s>
<s> 6 Syntax Data Model "to create the N-Triples" [[suggest: RDF Graph (no requirement to use N-Triples)]] I'll replace with "to create the RDF Graph" (link to RDF-CONCEPTS section) and same later in same paragraph.  </s>
<s> "The N-Triples[[ suggest: arcs]] may be generated in any order" I'll replace with "The RDF graph arcs (N-Triples) may be generated in any order" 6.1.2 Element Event "language Set from the *attributes* as described above.  </s>
<s> If no value is given from the attributes, the value is set to the value of the language accessor on the parent event (either a Root Event or an Element Event), which may be undefined."  </s>
<s> [[ no, the way you've done it doesn't it have to be at least the empty string?  </s>
<s> ]] Will change to "...which may be the empty string".  </s>
<s> 6.1.4 Attribute Event "string-value set to the value of the attribute information item property [normalized value] as specified by ..." [[Do we need to discuss the problems of whether we do XML validation or not.  </s>
<s> The attrbite value normalization rules are different for validated XML or non-validated XML? [XML]]] ... (if an attribute whose normalized value is a zero-length string, then the string-value is also a zero-length string).  </s>
<s> " This is more of a comment.  </s>
<s> Do you want me to change or point to something here?  </s>
<s> Add something to RDF-CONCEPTS and point to it, point ot the normalization section there?  </s>
<s> 6.1.7 Literal Event "If *literal-language* is empty[[ the empty string ]]" Yes.  </s>
<s> 7.2.1 Grammar start "Note that if such embedding occurs, the grammar may be entered several times but no state is expected to be preserved."  </s>
<s> [[ This contradicts other statements that talk about things with scope RDF/XML document.  </s>
<s> e.g. constraint-id.]]  </s>
<s> So should I say more or less?  </s>
<s> More: "...times; only outer document-scoped state is expected to be preserved such as restrictions on the set of names for rdf:ID, rdf:bagID as defined in SECTION constraint-id, the in-scope base URI and the in-scope xml:lang" Less: Say nothing.  </s>
<s> 7.2.4 Production propertyElementURIs 7.2.5 Production propertyAttributeURIs [[We never disallowed rdf:nil did we?]] We didn't micro-decide everything, I asked one, got no replies so made a choice.  </s>
<s> rdf:nil is a sentinel, we can either: 1) not encourage its use as a class or property and forbid it everywhere 2) not care, and allow it everywhere.  </s>
<s> Do you want to change to 2) ?  </s>
<s> 7.2.18 Production parseTypeOtherPropertyElt "All rdf:parseType attribute values other than the strings "Resource", "Literal" or "Collection" are treated as if the value was "Literal".  </s>
<s> Processing MUST ..." [[ This MUST is incorrect - this processing is entirely optional, what MUST be achieved is an effect as if this processing was done, e.g. a first parse that replaced any unrecognised rdf:parseType attribute value with "Literal" is conformant.  </s>
<s> Suggest delete MUST]] "... continue at production parseTypeLiteralPropertyElt.  </s>
<s> No extra triples are generated for other rdf:parseType values.  </s>
<s> I did eliminate this grammar production once, only allowing the legal values but I had to add it back since M&amp;S clearly says: [[Other values of parseType are reserved for future specification by RDF.  </s>
<s> With RDF 1.0 other values must be treated as identical to 'Literal'.]] -- http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-rdf-syntax-19990222/ and this is not optional.  </s>
<s> 7.2.33 Production rdf-id "An attribute *string-value* matching any legal [XML] token Nmtoken" [[This incorrectly permits q:name as an rdf:id.  </s>
<s> Suggest use NC_NAME from namespaces.]] Yes. 8 Serializing an RDF Graph to RDF/XML [[Suggest: use of NCName in text as well as href.]]  </s>
<s> Yes.  </s>
<s> Dave  </s>
<s> Thanks Dave for your fast turn around.  </s>
<s> I'll try and clarify my unclear comments.  </s>
<s> I guess I should note continuing unhappiness at your insistence that section 2 is normative.  </s>
<s> I do not believe we should publish like that (maybe it's just as well that I won't be at the telecon).  </s>
<s> Most of your msg is acceptable to me, thanks for accepting many of my comments.  </s>
<s> I would prefer major surgery.  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> 2.8 "the object node labelled with XML content beginning a:Collection" [[False: suggest change example.]]  </s>
<s> (Apart from labelled, which I will remove) I don't understand this problem, you will have to explain further what is wrong here and tell me what is needed in an example.  </s>
<s> The problem is that the XML content in the example begins with whitespace.  </s>
<s> There is widespread misunderstanding about how whitespace is treated in RDF/XML, and careless phrasing will add to that.  </s>
<s> I suggest ensuring that there is no whitespace between the two relevant tags in the example.  </s>
<s> 2.16 Closed Collections - rdf:parseType="Collection" I think you have not understood my point.  </s>
<s> This section 2 starts the document.  </s>
<s> The terminology you use has not been introduced.  </s>
<s> The word "closed" comes out of the blue.  </s>
<s> Is it "closed" like a closed door, or a closed and unreasonable lover?  </s>
<s> I don't think we want to describe what closed means, or what we were trying to do, or why - just what we have done.  </s>
<s> Thus all I would like to see is the XML and the triples - never apologize, never explain.  </s>
<s> The amount of text required to give an adequate explanation of this production is very large, and you will certainly hit the semantic issues which we are still struggling with.  </s>
<s> Don't go there, save your time, and save me my time correcting you.  </s>
<s> 5.1 The RDF Namespace sounds OK, but I might come back to this on the next review cycle.  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> I can't convert this comment into an obvious change.  </s>
<s> If I require N-Triples to explain how RDF/XML maps to the RDF graph, and N-Triples has syntax restrictions, what do I fix?  </s>
<s> I see brian has picked up on this one too.  </s>
<s> One, somewhat cludgy way of fixing it is to define an escape sequence from NC_NAME to Ntriple-NAME - would something like encode an NC_NAME in UTF-8 and then base64 encoding do it?  </s>
<s> (I don't really know what base64 encoding is, so I am speaking out of the wrong orifice!) The mapping just needs to give a unique Ntriple Name for each NC-NAME, since both sets are infinite there are lots of these mappings.  </s>
<s> constraint-nodeID The bit I was suggesting deleting was the bit labelled constraint-nodeID.  </s>
<s> It is referred to in just one place, (the nodeidAttr production) where deleting the reference leaves has no impact.  </s>
<s> i.e. this paragraph is technically redundant - the grammar with this constraint is identical (accepts the same strings and assigns them to the same graphs) as the grammar without this constraint.  </s>
<s> The constraint-ID paragraph on the other hand, is necessary; and it is nice having it called out separately.  </s>
<s> (I had to look back at the doc I sent - I made a mess with the end tags didn't I - you must have patched up your copy) XML validation and attribute normalization We are claiming that we are done with the technical issues - but this is one that we have yet to resolve (in my view).  </s>
<s> I guess we should escalate to Brian.  </s>
<s> Not reached 7.2.1 Grammar start (will do tomorrow) Jeremy  </s>
<s> From where I left off ...  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> 7.2.1 Grammar start So should I say more or less?  </s>
<s> I prefer less.  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> [[We never disallowed rdf:nil did we?]] We didn't micro-decide everything, I asked one, got no replies so made a choice.  </s>
<s> rdf:nil is a sentinel, we can either: 1) not encourage its use as a class or property and forbid it everywhere 2) not care, and allow it everywhere.  </s>
<s> Do you want to change to 2) ?  </s>
<s> 2) seems to be more consistent - it is only syntactic terms like rdf:Description that cannot be used as a property; I don't see why using rdf:nil as a class is any more wrong than using rdf:subject as one.  </s>
<s> 7.2.18  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> MUST My problem with the MUST was not what you were trying to say, but what you actually said.  </s>
<s> What you were trying to say is (more or less) that the grammar treats "FooBar" like "Literal"; what you actually said is that processing MUST (i.e. all implementations have to do this way) continue at a rule which some implementations won't even have.  </s>
<s> (e.g. SNAIL does not follow this framework at all; a conventially parser like VRP works over strings and so cannot be said to have production parseTypeLiteralPropertyElt and so cannot follow this MUST).  </s>
<s> Yes you have carefully said that implementations only have to have the same effect, that observation makes the MUST incorrect.  </s>
<s> This is really linked to my observation that the MUST, SHOULD etc terminology is not used sufficiently in this doc to justify its inclusion.  </s>
<s> It is possible to rephrase in a way that does not use this MUST, cf. Dan's I try to use the word MUST to constrain agents in processes, not to just make declarative statements; i.e.  </s>
<s> I think it's a misuse of RFC2119 to say things like "2 + 2 MUST be 4" Jeremy  </s>
