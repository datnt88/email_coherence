The Government Computer News, July 20,1998 has and article, "Web Page Authoring Software, Feds say easy formatting is out-of-sight" by Richard Walker. 
There is a matrix that says "What features do you consider when choosing Web Page Authoring software". 
The list does not contain any features that would help it be compliant with the American Disabilities Act. 
Once more, this matrix lends proves that ADA is not on many Agencies or Federal Web Designer's priority list. 
For example, besides the ALT Tag, as a minimum, I want the ability to edit the HTML so I can add table summarys, titles, etc... 
There is also no mention of the ability of web authoring software to assist the author in developing ADA compliant code.... Wouldn't it be great if Composer or FrontPage allowed you to add table summary, row and column ids, titles, etc.... HotMetal Pro is a relational database and does not permit you to touch the code. 
You have to exit and edit the code then re-import. 
I havent used hotdog since the 2 release. 
Suggest GCN provide an article that discusses the ADA compliance issues and the interviews persons with disabilities, highlights tools, WAI, etc... 
I copied the editor's e-mail address. 
If enough people write in and voice an opinion, maybe we can convince them to devote a section! 
Telephone Number is 301.650.2000. 
cheers, rob to follow up on what Robert Neff said: What model of HoTMetaL Pro did you use? 
In my limited experience using HoTMetaL Pro 4, I have been able to migrate between source, fully formatted, and a "tags on" view while I have the document open for editing. 
The "tags on" view iconifies markup but indicates where it is in the document, similar to displaying hard line breaks and spaces on the edit screen. 
I wind up using all three views before I am done with an edit. 
There was a report on this list that the new editor from Macromedia is also round-trip-safe. 
By that I mean if you use it to edit an HTML document, it only changes what you changed. 
There is evidence that if the site is generated by scripts written by someone who is aware of accessibility issues, one can get a pretty good site. 
Examples are Kent State and the Christian Science Monitor. 
There is looser, less structured plan which seems like it might work. 
This is for the access-savvy webmaster to prepare page templates and the content experts to create pages by editing the templates with a round-trip-safe authoring tool. 
The webmaster would still probably need to check and fix the pages, but this job would be doable as opposed to dealing with HTML that was never meant to be touched by anything but the originating tool. 
Does anybody here have experience with this sort of a site template approach?

Al I just heard of vector graphics for the first time ever. 
Apparently a graphic format that could replace bitmaps, and also apparently being proposed as a specification to the W3C. 
Does anyone know more about these and particularly any positive/negative impact on accessibility? 
Patrick Patrick J. Burke burke@ucla.edu 
University of California Los Angeles Disabilities &amp; Computing Program Analyzing Usability Since 1994 I would imagine that it would have zero impact. 
Vector graphics are simply a different compression scenario / scheme. 
The other option are rastered graphics that are basicly saved pixel by pixel. 
Bitmaps are raster based images.

Patrick Patrick J. Burke burke@ucla.edu 
University of California Los Angeles Disabilities &amp; Computing Program Analyzing Usability Since 1994 Well, we can hope there is an impact, in the sense that it's a symbolic representation of a graphics, so one could access the meaning by knowing the language. 
example, if I write (making up syntax as I type) then a voice agent could read aloud that there is a diagram made of several groups, that the first group is a circle attached to a rectangle with a line, etc. a near-sighted user can scale this graphic up withou losing the definition too. 
so it's better that a bitmap. 
but I also heard people saying that if the circle is there to represent a pie-chart about market share values and such, it's going to be really hard to extract that semantics from the markup, an order of magniture harder than a complex table... what needs to be provided in this case is the souce data about the market-share figures, in XML for instance, and the vector graphics is just one presentation of it (which doesn't mean it falls into style language land, but that's another story) to follow up on what Patrick Burke said: Vector Graphics is actually older than raster graphics, in many application areas. 
Vector graphics work like a plotter whith a pen that moves in two dimensions as it draws. 
The "vector" in vector graphics is "where to move the pen next," which can be anywhere on the page. 
Raster graphics work like an old WirePhoto machine. 
The pen sweeps straight across the page and is either up or down to make black and white pixels in that row. 
Then the paper inches forward and another row of black and white dots is laid down. 
These horizontal rows of pixels are the "rasters" this kind of format is named after. 
Current laser and ink jet printers are a raster format where the PostScript are vector formats. 
As Daniel explained, vector graphics formats are friendlier to zooming and retain more structure than raster formats. 
For example, if you have a scene from a virtual furniture showroom, and there is a chair for sale, there is a set of draw instructions which is the representation of the chair. 
In a raster format, there is no subset of the commands that you can lay your hands on easily that is "the chair." 
So while the chair as represented in the vector format may be inaccessible if it only contains the geometry of the draw instructions, at least the vector graphics format gives you a logical place to hang the verbal attribute "chair" and maybe a make and model. 
Even better, from an understanding point of view, are VR formats such as VRML and Java3D where the system knows the 3D shape of the chair and generates what goes on the the screen by rendering the chair's solid shape in terms of a user-controlled point of view. 
This VR style of format would let you push a virtual grocery cart through the virtual grocery store and when you run it into the shelves you hear the sound coming from the point of impact. 
So you know which way to steer away from on the next push. 
Since aural perception gives you a sense of three dimensions, if user interfaces migrate to three dimensions there is some potential for accessibility gains and richer eyes-free computation and browsing. 
This is why Raman put spatial stuff in ACSS so that the sound can come from different places. 
HTH Al I believe vector graphics will have positive impact on accessibility. 
In raster graphics, texts in the graphics are expressed as bitmap data, so we can't read the text unless we can see the rendered graphics. 
But in vector graphics, texts could be expressed as TEXT. 
There are so many graphics which include textual information, so we might be able to extract some textual information from those vector graphics.
