<s> Hi, experts, Does anyone know some software tools that can edit OWL files?  </s>
<s> and OWL parser(just as xml parser)?  </s>
<s> Thank you in advance.  </s>

<s> Emacs does quite well as an editor :-).  </s>
<s> Seriously though, OilEd [1] is a tool that supports (most of) OWL.  </s>
<s> It was originally built as an editor for OIL and DAML+OIL, so there are one or two things that it doesn't yet do, but we are working on it.  </s>
<s> As a basic editor for OWL ontologies it should do fine.  </s>
<s> If you're interested in an OWL parser, our OWL API [2] provides functionality for parsing OWL in RDF/XML.  </s>

<s> Sean Bechhofer seanb@cs.man.ac.uk  </s>
<s> There is an OWL Plugin for the open-source Protege system available from http://protege.stanford.edu/plugins/owl/  </s>
<s> This tool allows you to load, edit, save and classify OWL ontologies in a graphical user interface.  </s>
<s> A very popular OWL parser is Jena from HP Labs: Holger  </s>
