I'm trying to install an instance of the annotea server almost 2 years after this posting, but I still have the same problem. 
Would you know if it got fixed and cvs committed ? 
Thanks, Bruno

I tried to submit the form for access [1], but received an error: Access to "/etc/apache/conf/users" failed. 
No such file or directory Can someone look into this error? 
Sorry about that. 
I was cleaning up some code and took it upon myself to clean up some directory after running my tests. 
Please let me know if you have any more problems. 
I believe my first response was assuming you were having the problem with our annotest.w3.org. 
If you are installing this on your systme, I need to know a little about the system. 
Is it a standard apache install? 
Does /etc/apache exist? 
/etc/apache/conf? 
/etc/apache/conf/users*? Note: on some systems, /etc/apache/conf is symlinked to .. Does `dbmmanage /tmp/users add username password` create such a file? 
What dbm format is it using [1] ?

Eric may correct me but it seems to me that the "users" file needed for access it not where it is supposed to be by default:"/etc/apache/conf/users". 
Maybe because apache is installed somewhere else and paths need to be changed accordingly or some definition files are missing from your installation. 
Can you look the new documentation and see if it helps: General documentation in configuring the Web server: Here are some instruction for finding the locations: Marja
