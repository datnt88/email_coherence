I have a Word document from which I want to remove from Microsoft Word 2000 special tags. 
When I use the option "word-2000" in my configurationfile, some data are removed. 
I've added an example below. 
I want to have "2 ?"-data in my output, but it's removed. 
Is this really right?

What version did you use? 
Using a recent version of TidyLib I get p class="Paragraf" style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm' ![if !supportLists] b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal' 2 &amp;otilde; /b ![endif]Demo /p regards. 
I duplicated the behavior, which is long standing. 
Tidy removes the conditional sections and their content: But Tidy needs to identify the document as a Microsoft Office doc before it will actually remove the conditional sections (again, the long standing behavior). 
It needs to find either a generator meta tag or a namespace declartion. 
take it easy, Charlie
