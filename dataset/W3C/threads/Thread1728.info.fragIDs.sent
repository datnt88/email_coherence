<s> Is there any standard which search engines use when sending HTTP requests during spidering, in order to tell the receipient HTTP server that they are search engines.  </s>
<s> I can see multiple uses of this.  </s>
<s> In our particular case, we sometimes intentionally create slightly varying URLs of the same document, in order to stop an old version in the cache to be used.  </s>
<s> (Yes, I know there are cache control standards, but they do not seem to work in all cases.)  </s>
<s> This might mean that a search engine would store multiple copies of nearly the same document, and would not recognize that a new version replaces an old version of the same document.  </s>

<s> No. Some try to use a heuristic, with varying success (the big ones are pretty easy to get).  </s>
<s> There are ways to assure cache freshness.  </s>
<s> See If that isn't good enough, vary the reference's query string, most search engines will understand.  </s>
<s> Also, you might try using robots.txt  </s>
<s> to shape which documents will be fetched.  </s>
<s> Mark Nottingham, Research Scientist Akamai Technologies (San Mateo, CA USA)  </s>
<s> After experimentation, we found the best success with adding ";12345678, where 12345678 is a number which changes every time the document is modified, at the end of those URLs which refer to pages which are frequently updated.  </s>
<s> You can look at for example http://salut.nu/forum/uno/2/  </s>
<s> to see how our pages look like.  </s>
<s> If you click on a link in those pages, ";12345678" with a new number is added at the end of most of the pages whenever the page is changed, in order to avoid users getting old, cached versions of the document they ask for.  </s>
<s> But the document you referenced might teach us a method of avoiding stale pages to user without adding ;12345678 at the end of our URLs.  </s>
<s> It seems like a very comprehensive tutorial on how to get your documents to be handled correctly by caches.  </s>
<s> At present we are also using robots.txt  </s>
<s> to suppress search engines.  </s>
<s> Some of our content might however be suitable for search engines, and then we must ensure that we do not send the ";12345" URL-s to them, because this would cause them to store multiple references to almost the same document (something which already is a big problem for search engine implementors), and which all would in reality refer users to the same document.  </s>
<s> I can guess that a standard method of recognizing when a HTTP client is a search engine might be controversial, since spammers would of course be very happy to be able to deliver different content to search engines than to ordinary users in order to pull users to their sites.  </s>
<s> But they probably already have learned to do that using various heuristics, as you suggest.  </s>
