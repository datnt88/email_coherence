<s> Please note that while this email is somewhat long, my comments are mostly proposals for editorial clarification (including clarification of text in several checkpoints).  </s>

<s> Issue 1) Section 1.3 (Conformance to these Guidelines).  </s>
<s> Form 1 describes what information must be made available in a detailed conformance claim (AUGL version, conformance level, checklist, etc.).  </s>
<s> In the UA WG, we have been discussing ways to deliver this information (this was discussed at the 10 December UAGL face-to-face in Austin as issue 136).  </s>

<s> In the latter case, the claim would be accompanied by a URI to the claim information on the Web.  </s>

<s> Issue 2) Editorial change to checkpoint 2.2: change "inform" to "alert".  </s>
<s> Old text: "If markup generated by the tool does not conform to W3C specifications, inform the author."  </s>
<s> The term "alert" is well-defined, while "inform" is not.  </s>
<s> The term "alert" is defined as "draw the author's attention to an event or situation."  </s>
<s> Invalid markup is a situation.  </s>
<s> Issue 3) Checkpoint 3.3 a) In the Note, it is not clear that "movies" are movies that come with the tool.  </s>
<s> I propose adding the word "prepackaged" before "movies".  </s>
<s> b) Make "auditory descriptions" plural in the Note.  </s>
<s> Issue 4) Checkpoint 3.4: Both the checkpoint and note are unclear to me.  </s>
<s> Old text: "Do not insert automatically generated or place-holder equivalent alternatives." a) The term "automatically" is redundant since "generate" in this document means the tool created the content on its own.  </s>
<s> b) "place-holder" is not clear to me and is not explained in the Techniques document.  </s>
<s> I don't think it's necessary because either: 1) The tool generated the place-holder and therefore it's subsumed by "don't generate equivalent alternatives", or 2) The tool is reusing a previously authored equivalent.  </s>
<s> In this case, the requirement may be "Don't reuse previously authored equivalents without confirmation from the author."  </s>
<s> c) The first example in the checkpoint note is unclear and should be deleted.  </s>
<s> Proposed new checkpoint text and note: Checkpoint 3.4 Do not generate equivalent alternatives.  </s>
<s> Do not reuse previously authored alternatives without author confirmation.  </s>
<s> Note: For example, prompt the user for a text equivalent of an image.  </s>
<s> If the author has already provided a text equivalent for the same image used in another document, offer to reuse that equivalent and prompt the author for confirmation.  </s>
<s> Refer also to checkpoints 3.3 and 3.5.  </s>

<s> New text: Allow the author to manage, edit, and reuse alternative equivalents for multimedia objects.  </s>
<s> Note: These alternative equivalents may be packaged with the tool, written by the author, retrieved from the Web, etc. Issue 6) Checkpoint 4.5 Old text: "Allow the author to transform presentation markup that is misused to convey structure into structural markup, and to transform presentation markup that is stylistic into style sheets."  </s>
<s> I don't understand "presentation markup that is stylistic".  </s>
<s> Isn't that what "presentation markup" means?  </s>
<s> I propose dropping "that is stylistic".  </s>
