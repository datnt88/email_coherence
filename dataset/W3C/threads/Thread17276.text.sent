I certainly appreciate Al's efforts here (he can always be relied on to give a solid theoretical basis), but I don't think the proposed WCAG guideline deals with the same thing he's talking about. 
The right goal for our effort, as Tom has suggested, is "what tip of the information iceberg is most important to get articulated verbally, and how can we get authors over the hump to articulate that?" 
Unfortunately, that formulation assumes that a diagram or illustration (the canonical example that WCAG continues to flub) has one or two easy-to-summarize main points. 
A *gist*, you might say. 
There are lots of those, and I cover them in my book. 
But they are not the norm, and the entire reason we draw diagrams and illustrations is to make relationships that are hard to express in words visible and comprehensible. 
Through the diagram or illustration, the entire iceberg is available. 
It simply is not possible to reverse-engineer that iceberg into a simple "tip" that can be plunked into an alt text. 
Some things *cannot be expressed in words*. 
That's why words are not the only form of communication we use. 
It follows-- pay attention, Chaaalz-- that there aren't "alternatives" or "equivalents" for everything. 
If we can communicate the right questions to the authors, they will be able to articulate the answers. 
No, that perpetuates the fallacy. 
Some or indeed most diagrams and illustrations are permanently and unchangeably resistant to summation in words. 
You can't rephrase the question because the question cannot be asked. 
The piece of this job that looks doable in the near term is to coach the author through a bit of scene modeling and get them to articulate what is in their scene, some principal properties of each such thing, and principal relationships among these things. 
Then we will be getting somewhere. 
This will create a guide to their scene in an entity/relationship/attribute graph with navigable relationships and speakable attributes. 
People aren't going to put a full workday into modeling, in some as-yet-specified language, every relationship that is apparent in an illustration. 
Nobody's gonna write some kind of script for a screen reader (similar to Jaws configuration files) to enable a single illustration to be read. 
Even then the experience won't merely fail to be the same, it won't even be adequate. 
*Some things can't be summed up in words*. 
[The URCC primitives: "What's there?" "What can I do?" are still the core of what we have to lure out of authors. 
Imagine yourself answering these questions over the phone...] I've used that model myself in other contexts. 
But it doesn't work here. 
Many or even most diagrams and illustrations (to continue with the canonical WCAG example) are too complex for that. 
Essentially, WCAG wants the entirety of technical and scientific illustration reduced to TV-news soundbites. 
Talking about creating a GIS-like infiltration of the scene presented on the web screen helps the content designer/developer think in graph terms and not be forced to take the harder conceptual leap to a linear narrative. 
I see what you're saying (not everything need be turned into lengthy prose to be "expressed in words"), but even that amount of metadata simply *will not be done* by authors. 
They've got better things to do, and some will realize the futility of equating illustration with words. 
Anything we do to lower the potential barrier to getting over the belief that it's too hard is golden, is critical to our success. 
WCAG WG and WAI need to accept that "express[ing] in words" isn't merely hard some of the time, it's impossible. 
*Some things can't be made accessible to everyone*. 
That's why, for example, we have undue-hardship exemptions in human-rights legislation. 
Presented with a tree-view presentation of the objects they have identified in their scene, an author can readily from this view create a sensible tour, a linear reading order. 
There isn't a "linear reading order" inherent in everything. 
It's a bit late in the day to suggest that the Web-- a non-linear medium-- must be reduced to a straight line. 
"Linear reading order" is another of those WAI shibboleths that needs to be de-emphasized. 
*Cough*.

Expect criticism if you top-post It seems that everything starts with language of one form or another. 
Images stand for words, words stand for images, groups of each stand for each other. 
I have not encountered an abstract graphical representation that cannot be put into words. 
I have not looked at the guideline being discussed here but we've already got plenty of textual transposition mechanisms for the web and they are being less than half used and often miss used.

Expect criticism if you top-post Hey, we're on the same page!! Nearly. 
I certainly agree that equivalence is a bad way to characterise the relationship between a brief set of notes on the "flight of the bumblebee" and the actual piece of music. 
(And I have never considered trying to explain what I like about Marianne Faithfull to a deaf person, although I believe it could be approximated). 
There isn't a strict verbal equivalent to Picasso's 'Guernika'. 
For that matter, nor is there a strict visual equivalent to Tolkein's "Lord of the Rings". 
Fortunately there is a difference between "expressing something completely" and "expressing something adequately". 
Describing the colour scheme used for a page is generally doing more than is needed, in that it doesn't add to the user's experience of the page, and may not even be meaningful to them. 
Ditto for the pretty ribbon chosen instead of a normal horizontal line. 
Describing Picasso's 'Guernika' as "black and white picture of people and animals" is probably doing less than is needed. 
But in many cases we communicate in roundabout ways, through rhetorical figures (Joe). 
While we might not convey the full beauty and superior nature of our communication, we can often convey the essence in words. 
For people whose experience of the Web is based solely on communicating through words, this is generally adequate. 
There are of course exceptions. 
When we are producing pure art it is difficult to directly express it, although there may be value in giving some idea what it is about or the sensation it produces in a viewer. 
And when we are talking just for the sake of it, without saying anything valuable, or just to stir up argument, it is an open question whether it is more useful to summarise the statements made, or to note that "somebody made their usual pointless contribution". 
The goal is to make our communication good enough. 
(I happen to dislike the phrase "able to be expressed in words" rather intensely, but until I have something better to propose I figure that it is good enough to convey the idea.I could of course be wrong). 
And describe ways that can be done. 
An alternative is expected to be good enough, and in that sense it has a relation of equivalence (which is a broad concept).

Would "brief description" be helpful? 
alt could then be changed to Jonathan
