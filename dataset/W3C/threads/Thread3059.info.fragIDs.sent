<s> I just wrote a few tests [1] for 2.1 [2], and I'm interested in knowing how I'm doing, especially with regard to the guidelines [3], and especially from the authors of said guidelines.  </s>
<s> A few issues where I'm particularly unsure of myself are: * are my title elements good?  </s>
<s> * are my filenames good, especially regarding my choice along the a-b-c-d-e-f spectrum (for which the tests I wrote are perhaps an unusual case)?  </s>
<s> * is my lack of consistent wording a problem?  </s>
<s> I've written multiple variations of the sentences "This paragraph should have a green background." and "The next two paragraphs should look identical."  </s>

<s> I think those are the best tests I've ever seen.  </s>
<s> My only comments -- and don't get me wrong; these are nit-picking comments, the equivalent of someone saying you should fix the spelling in a comment during a code review -- would be: Instead of "NOT be in a bold font" I would just say "be in a thin font" or "be in a regular font weight", as negatives tend to make understanding the test harder.  </s>
<s> Instead of "This should be 10em wide.",  </s>
<s> I would just say "Test".  </s>
<s> This is for two reasons: first, it is nigh on impossible to know how much 10em is anyway, and second, you want to have as few pass conditions per test as possible, so that the reader can quickly establish the result.  </s>
<s> I haven't yet put this in the public version of the guidelines, but there are some assumptions you can make about the test environment: In particular, you can assume the default text color is black, so there is no need to explicitly set it in the tests.  </s>
<s> You should make a third test line which makes no use of generated content at all, and preferably change the sentence to a dummy one such as "This is a test paragraph".  </s>
<s> They seem fine to me.  </s>
<s> To be honest the titles aren't that important.  </s>
<s> ...should probably be a "b" not a "c", but they seem fine to me in general.  </s>
<s> It's a judgement call, and the judgement is almost always going to be based on how many browsers actually fail the test -- my "Evil" tests from back in 99 when I was making the Evil Test Suite were simply the tests that everyone failed, as opposed to the Wet Blanket Tests, which were the tests that only a few people failed and thus "reduced the enjoyment of others", as it were.  </s>
<s> That all looked fine to me.  </s>

<s> I concur with Ian's comments have only two other quick short comments to make:  </s>
<s> 1. serve the files as text/html for ease of trying them out in more browsers (alternatively, conditionally serve as application/xhtml+xml only if http accept headers allow for it -- folks have documented this on the net.) I know, this violates what is allowed for XHTML 1.1, but it helps usability (a good tradeoff), and will only make a difference in browsers that don't handle XHTML anyway.  </s>
<s> Another possibility is to use content negotiation so that URLs without a file extension, e.g.: are sent as text/html to browsers that don't handle XHTML.  </s>
<s> 2. possibly add more link rel="help" tags for some of the tests.  </s>
<s> e.g. your border shorthand test should also link to the sections on the 'border' and 'border-color' property in spec, because that's really what it's testing, in fact, I might put the link to the border-color property first since that's really what is being thoroughly tested.  </s>
<s> I'm busy with prepping for my presentations at SXSW so I didn't do a detailed review and will hopefully have more comments later.  </s>
<s> Definitely a very nice start though.  </s>
<s> Makes me want to write some tests.  </s>
<s> Thanks, Tantek  </s>
<s> Well, the files will get converted to (amongst other things) HTML4 files before publishing, so this won't be a problem.  </s>
<s> All modern browsers support XHTML, so in the meantime while developing the tests it doesn't matter that it's only available in that format.  </s>
<s> I don't want accurate rel="help" links to become a burden on the test writers...  </s>
<s> I wouldn't want to push this too strongly.  </s>
