<s> Hello Jerome Thirion,  </s>
<s> SGML is a language to write structured documents DOM may be used to build up the structure of a document in program memory as an object tree.  </s>
<s> As XML is a "subset" of SGML one may answer your question "yes, but".  </s>
<s> The difficult part arises where you try to use any SGML features which are missing in XML.  </s>
<s> But as far as i know you will meet these problems only if you try to generate a SGML document out of the DOM representation instead of an XML document.  </s>
<s> Bye, Axel Zeilner (az@cri.de)  </s>

<s> The DOM is designed for XML (as well as HTML).  </s>
<s> XML is a subset of SGML, therefore the DOM will work with that subset of SGML.  </s>
<s> The DOM was not designed to work with features of SGML that are not in XML.  </s>
