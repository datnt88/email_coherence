Is DOM is compliant to SGML? 
In the negative why?

Hello Jerome Thirion, 
SGML is a language to write structured documents DOM may be used to build up the structure of a document in program memory as an object tree. 
As XML is a "subset" of SGML one may answer your question "yes, but". 
The difficult part arises where you try to use any SGML features which are missing in XML. 
But as far as i know you will meet these problems only if you try to generate a SGML document out of the DOM representation instead of an XML document.

The DOM is designed for XML (as well as HTML). 
XML is a subset of SGML, therefore the DOM will work with that subset of SGML. 
The DOM was not designed to work with features of SGML that are not in XML.
