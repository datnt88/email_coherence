Vidur, I have not seen any document describe a common way to normalize HTML that is poorly formed w.r.t. the DOM. 
This seems important if all DHTML clients are to respond to JavaScript in the same way. 
For instance, does not produce a valid DOM tree. 
I can see two ways of representing this: b i four ----- three one i two This gives proper style inheritance, but JavaScript access to i will not be correct unless i remembers it is in multiple parts of the tree. 
On the other hand: b four one i two /b three Gives proper style inheritance and proper JavaScript access, but results in nodes under b that aren't really bold, and introduces end-tags to the hierarchy, as well as bounding box calculation complexities. 
Is this a question for the DOM working group? 
Do all clients need to build a normalized DOM tree the same way? 
Or should clients do whatever they think makes most sense, as long as the JavaScript behavior is the same? 
Thst is, getting the inner/outer text works as expected, changing the text color works as expected, etc. David David Mott, Network Computer Inc. mott@nc.com http://www.nc.com 
Actually, the rule is that it must be a valid HTML, which is always properly nested. 
If it isn't I believe it errors (obviously since it's very clear that XML must nest correctly, there's not problem there). 
If the text doesn't nest right, the browser is at fault for interpretting it incorrectly. 
Netscape and Microsoft don't worry about nesting order, but the spec does. 
This is partially true (or at least I think it is. 
I couldn't completely parse the entire response). 
It is true that the spec currently only discusses well-formed HTML and XML. 
Our supposition was that most of the content that uses the DOM will be new and, hence, forcing the markup to be well-formed is a reasonable constraint. 
This doesn't address scripts or applications that attempt to deal with (potentially illegal) legacy content. 
It also doesn't address cases (like FORM tags that don't have clean nesting boundaries) which are acceptable based on current practice. 
The issue of having a cannonical way to deal with non well-formed content (at least for HTML) has been brought up in the working group. 
We haven't come to a resultion on how or if it should be done.
