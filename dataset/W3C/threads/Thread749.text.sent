What is with the W3C website? 
I went on there to direct some of my students to tidy and the whole site is changed. 
It is impossible to find the stuff that was normally very easy to access. 
It seems that whoever took it upon themselve to redesign the website planned this thing for new users, not experienced users who don't give a crap about all the hoo-haw intro stuff. 
What gives? 
The damn search engine doesn't even work. 
Put in tidy and it comes up blank. 
This sucks. 
Chris Brown Hi Chris, At http://www.w3.org/ as from this very moment I find a yellow naviagtion bar on the left side with the item "HTML Tidy" which leads to thge tidy page http://www.w3.org/People/Raggett/tidy/. Are we looking at different sites?

Looks fine to me I must be looking at a different site.... 
I see the HTML Tidy link along with all the links that were there before. 
I don't see any hoo-haw intro stuff? 
Not sure what you're saying about about the design for new users.... does this mean it's so simple experienced users can't find anything?

Chris Brown Hmmm. 
I searched for the word 'tidy' and got 81 results. 
The first pointed to the Tidy home page. 
I see a clear list of links -- including one to HTML Tidy -- to all areas of W3C activity, as well as news on recent project updates and changes. 
I don't consider that 'hoo-haw intro stuff'. 
My only real complaint about the new version thus far is the lack of link indicators in the news-style presentation on the home page.
