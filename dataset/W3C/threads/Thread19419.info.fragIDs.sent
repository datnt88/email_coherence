Amaya 1.3 binary won't run on NT 4.0 sp 3 on a P2/330 w/64 mb. 
Clicking on the app causes it to run briefly and then exit with no message.

At a guess this has to be machine specific, I've just installed it and run it on an array of 3 Win NT 4 SP3 machines all around the same spec.

om Hi, I think that your problem comes from the HOME environment variable. 
Try to open a Command Prompt, Set HOME to "" and execute Amaya from the Command Prompt Suppose that you've installed Amaya in C:\Program Files C: set HOME= C: cd Program Files\Thot\Windows\bin C:\Program Files\Thot\Windows\bin amaya This problem is known and will be solved for the next release.
