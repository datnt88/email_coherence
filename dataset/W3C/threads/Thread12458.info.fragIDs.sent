Hello all, Recent AUWG discussions of implementation and evaluation techniques for Wombat seem to reveal shortcomings in the ordering of the guidelines. 
In an attempt to rectify this, I (with some help from Matt May) am making the following reordering proposal: The primary thrust of the proposal is to organize the seven guidelines into four "Tiers" that will build successively upon the ones before. 
- Tier 1 includes those guidelines that address ways to ENABLE accessible content production, but which do not actively support or promote it (from the author perspective). 
= Implementation Techniques for these guidelines involve reference to W3C language recommendations and to WCAG. - Tier 2 builds upon Tier 1 by including those guidelines that address ways to actively SUPPORT accessible content production by prompting, checking and documenting. 
= Implementation Techniques for these guidelines general strategies (see Prompting appendix), the AERT, and general themes in WCAG. 
- Tier 3 builds on Tiers 1 and 2 by addressing the manner in which the Tier 1 and 2 checkpoints should be integrated with the tool. 
= Implementation Techniques for these guidelines involve User Interface integration ideas. 
- Tier 4 builds upon Tiers 1, 2 and 3 by addressing the accessibility of the user interface of the tool, as a whole. 
= Implementation Techniques for these guidelines involve third-party platform-specific guidelines as well as access-friendly authoring interface mechanisms. 
*NOTE 1*: This step-upon-step approach is the way that I tend to explain the document to others. 
But up until now, it was not made explicit by the document structure. 
*NOTE 2*: Grouping the "Guidelines" into "Tiers" means that the wording of guidelines may remain essentially the same as it was in ATAG 1.0. 
The checkpoints will likely still need to be fine-tuned. 
Several minor changes were required for the reordering to work: - The order of Guidelines 1 and 2 will need to be switched to place the choice of output format and the production of valid markup first, as precursors for the rest of the ATAG requirements. 
- The order of Guidelines 5 and 6 will need to be switched, since Guideline 5 (dealing with integration) is actually a modifier for Guideline 6 (dealing with documentation) in the current Wombat draft. 
- Note that checkpoint 5.1 is now numbered 6.X. 
This was done because I believe the checkpoint is now unnecessary.

I like it. 
I am wondering if there is some paralell with the XML accessibility guidelines - http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/XML - which are in many ways about using XML as a specific tool for a certain type of authoring.

Charles, There do seem to be parallels between ATAG and XAG and these should be investigated - but ATAG does go further than XAG in specifying the relationship between tools and authors. 
By the way: An interesting side effect of the reordering proposal is that it helps to explain why we were having such trouble coming up with categorizations for our implementation techniques... ...we were trying to categorize techniques written at differing conceptual levels. 
For example: - Tier 1 (enable accessibility) techniques are probably most appropriately divided by FORMAT TYPE (i.e. "consider using SVG for graphics"), whereas - Tier 2 (support accessibility) techniques are probably most appropriately divided by the TYPES OF ACCESSIBILITY PRACTICES ("i.e. here's how to prompt for or repair short labels vs. long text descriptions"), whereas - Tier 3 (integrate accessibility features) techniques are most appropriately divided by the USER INTERFACE METAPHOR employed (i.e. "here's how to integrate prompts of different kinds into a text-based editor vs. a WYSIWYG editor"). 
Perhaps this will lead us to a different categorization scheme for each "Tier"?

Right - it seems to me clear that ATAG and XAG have intersting parallels but are not doing the same job. 
For example, XAG doesn't talk much about interfaces for authoring tools, and where it does, as in checkpoint 4.8 "Document techniques for WCAG, ATAG, and UAAG with respect to the XML application" it refers to ATAG as the W3C Recommendation on the subject. 
(No relative priority because there are no priorities in XAG). 
But yes, the feature I liked most was the way that it seemed to suggest clearer ways for creating and dealing with techniques.

I agree - this is very nice. it will help those trying to use the checkpoints a lot, I think. 
I's logical but it also allows for yet another good way to talk about the checkpoints so that everyone can have a good sense of what will be achieved by compliance.
