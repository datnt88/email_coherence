<s> Hi, Charles I'm not sure I would totally agree with the areas you listed in agreement.  </s>
<s> If someting is good, that doesn't necessarily mean it should be everywhere.  </s>
<s> If at one point of time, it is possible to meet people's needs with one item, that doesn't necessarily mean it is the best solution.  </s>
<s> One possibility is cutting download time with smaller versions rather than one big version.  </s>
<s> Also, if the needs change over time, early preparation may be easier with multiple versions.  </s>
<s> Shared experience is only one aspect.  </s>
<s> What are people willing to give up in order to have a shared experience?  </s>
<s> Scott  </s>
<s> Scott, Let us first examine areas where we all seem to be agreed: 1. Something that is helpful to a group of people, and does not cause a problem for others, is good, and should be everywhere.  </s>
<s> It is particularly important for such a thing to be where those people are or are trying to be. 2. Different people have different needs, and one of our basic goals is to work out how to meet those needs, in particular with respect to using the web.  </s>
<s> 3. Doing something that meets people's needs is good, even if it is possible to do something better that meets people's needs.  </s>
<s> But doing something better is better (by definition) Now, consider a couple more propositions that I think will meet agreement, but I'm not certain: 1.  </s>
<s> Where it is possible to meet those needs by making one thing that everyone can use, instead of making differnt things for different people, that is preferable.  </s>
<s> I suggest that this is true substantially because people are social, and want to be able to share their experience with other people, and in many cases do not want to be constrained to sharin them with other people who have the same set of needs.  </s>
<s> In addition, people don't live to work - they want to do what is necessary and be done with it.  </s>
<s> This gives rise to a risk of the "good enough" solution that works for "enough" people, in place of an actual solution, that solves the problems people face.  </s>
<s> 2. In producing material for the web, presentation and semantic content should be as separate as possible.  </s>
<s> I accept this on faith from computer scientist and information scientists, but it seems to make sense as a basic requirement for being able to represent information in various different types of system.  </s>
<s> (I'm still trying to tease out what I think are a lot of issues you initial questions raise, and so I'm trying to home in by establishing some common ground or at least some reference points).  </s>
<s> Cheers Charles McCN  </s>
<s> This thread was discussed at today's meeting.  </s>
<s> Details can be found in the minutes, to which Wendy has posted a reference.  </s>
<s> Those present at the teleconference were in broad agreement that: 1.  </s>
<s> The use of "alternative pages" as supplied by a web server, is permitted in the existing guidelines as a "last resort" option (checkpoint 11.4).  </s>
<s> Appropriate technical advice may therefore be given in the Techniques document.  </s>
<s> 2. Any acceptance of the proposition that "alternative versions" of web content should be deployed as the principal means of satisfying diverse user needs, would entail substantial revision of the guidelines and a radical departure from the principles of universal design which lie at their foundation.  </s>
<s> More specifically, control over presentation, instead of residing in the hands of the user, would be transferred to the author and the server administrator.  </s>
<s> Instead of supplying semantically and structurally rich markup to the client software, the server would provide presentationally-oriented markup, constituting one of several alternative presentations defined by the content developer.  </s>
<s> 3. Participants in the teleconference were unanimously of the view that, while recognising the need to provide alternative versions of content in order to accommodate the limitations of certain user agents, for example those in mobile devices, client-side style sheets, combined with appropriate XML/HTML/XHTML markup to convey significant semantic and structural distinctions, offer a more flexible and general solution than would recourse to server-supplied presentational formats in meeting the needs of diverse user populations.  </s>
<s> 4. If the present discussion of server-generated content is to proceed further, then it must be formulated as a specific proposal to change the guidelines and/or techniques document, rather than as a general thesis concerning web accessibility.  </s>
<s> Though acknowledging the general value of the discussion so far, working group members considered that a concrete proposal would need to be offered if the issue were to be pursued farther in the context of this group and its deliverables.  </s>
<s> In replying privately to a query, it came to my attention that whilst cognitive disability occupies me professionally, having a three year old daughter also is a concern.  </s>
<s> Surely we must recognise that children require significantly different material?  </s>
<s> What efforts is wai making to meets this need?  </s>
<s> As it is likely that currently these pages would need to be in a separate area, does this not answer the "one size fits all" personalized web page?  </s>
<s> query?  </s>
