<s> I have been using Tidy GUI with Word 2000 for a few years.  </s>
<s> For SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION HTML documents, you have to "Save it down" to HTML 3.2.  </s>
<s> Tidy does a wonderful job with Word 2000.  </s>
<s> There are minimal tags that need to be changed.  </s>
<s> Occationally, a few smart quotes or (&amp;#146, &amp;#147, etc., slip though) My newest delima is that I have a new laptop -- XP -- Word 2002 XP.  </s>
<s> I have tried saving the Word document as Web Page, Filtered, and then take through Tidy GUI.  </s>
<s> My problem is that codes such as o:p and span , style and these tags are not allowed by the SEC.  </s>
<s> ANY SUGGESTIONS.  </s>
<s> MANY THANKS.  </s>

<s> When Tidy fixes Word XML it is very agressive in removing markup that otherwise would be acceptable HTML.  </s>
<s> For this reason, when it is told to fix Word 2000 output it checks to be sure that the file it is fixing really was created by M$Word.  </s>
<s> If it doesn't find an M$Word signature at the beginning of the file it does not perform the Word cleanup.  </s>
<s> When you use the HTML filter with Word 2002 it strips from the output the signatures that Tidy uses to detect Word XML, while leaving in much of the content that makes M$Word output so objectionable.  </s>
<s> As a result, Tidy doesn't perform the Word cleanup, even though you asked it to.  </s>
<s> Try saving your output from Word "as Web Page", but not filtered.  </s>
<s> I think you may find that this will solve your problem.  </s>
