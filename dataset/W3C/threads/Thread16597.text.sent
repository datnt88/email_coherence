So what does this have to do with the WCAG? 
Well, take a look at the current working draft of version 2.0: Although nothing in there is "secret", it should be noted that this is still a work-in-progress, and as a draft which does not yet reflect consensus (even among the members of the working group), it's hard to discuss what this does or doesn't say. 
(And comments on what it should say should probably go to the working group mailing list, at w3c-wai-gl@w3.org, so that your viewpoints can be reflected in upcoming discussions.) --Kynn, WCAG working group member, not speaking for the working group Kynn Bartlett kynn@idyllmtn.com http://kynn.com/

What's on my bookshelf? 
http://kynn.com/books/ 
Over the past few weeks this list has seen much discussion about the meaning of accessibility and the role that graphics and multimedia play in helping people with cognitive disabilities. 
One of the points made in this discussion is that text-only sites are unfair to people with cognitive disabilities. 
I don't think that this is necessarily the case, and I'd like to explain why. 
I realize that I will be vilified by some for expressing a view that may seem at first rather politically incorrect. 
Over the past fifty years great strides have been made in making our societies fairer and more just. 
The civil rights movement, the feminist movement, the gay rights movement, and the efforts to increase access for people with disabilities have brought us much closer to a truly egalitarian society. 
In the process, the word "discrimination" has become associated with narrow-mindedness, bigotry, and injustice. 
The result is a sort of knee-jerk reaction on the part of many whenever an action appears discriminatory. 
I propose, however, that discrimination is not only positive, but also vital to our survival as a species. 
We discriminate thousands of times a day, most often without any conscious thought. 
When I choose what I want to eat, where I want to go, what I want to say or do, I am discriminating. 
When we grade our students, critique our art, reward the winners of contests, or present awards and prizes for outstanding performance, we are engaging in discrimination. 
Yet who would argue that these acts of discrimination are wrong? 
In fact, our laws are discriminatory. 
That's their entire point. 
They discriminate between acceptable and unacceptable behavior. 
Should we do away with laws because they discriminate? 
Discrimination is only a problem when it is *unfair* discrimination, that is when the basis for the discrimination is irrelevant to the situation at hand. 
For example, if I charge a higher price to some clients because of their sexual preferences (or their sex or their color, etc.), I am discriminating unfairly. 
Sexual preference, sex, color, etc. is irrelevant to the service I provide. 
Put another way, there is nothing unfair about imprisoning a rapist, but there is something very unfair when an African-American rapist gets life while a European-American rapist committing the same crime gets five years. 
In both instances we are discriminating, but in one we are discriminating very unfairly. 
Viewed in Web terms, if I design a real estate site in a manner that makes it inaccessible to the blind, I've discriminated unfairly. 
Vision or lack of same is not relevant to the sale of real estate. 
On the other hand, if I'm building a site to train city bus drivers, is it unfair to deny access to the blind? 
It might be if there were information available not directly related to driving a bus, but in the absence of such information, I contend that it is not unfairly discriminatory. 
Blind people do not drive buses. 
When we are dealing with issues such as vision, hearing, or physical disabilities, it is not that difficult to decide when discrimination is unfair. 
But when we get into the realm of cognitive disabilities, things get tricky rather quickly. 
To me, the key to deciding whether a site is discriminating unfairly or fairly is audience. 
To whom is the site addressed? 
If a site is intended to bring doctors up to date on the latest techniques for microsurgery, I don't think it's reasonable to expect them to rewrite the text to make it understandable by lay persons, let alone by a user with Down's Syndrome. 
But that's an extreme example. 
Let's try one a little more complicated: Should the IRS site be designed to accommodate those who cannot read? 
I say: maybe. 
Or rather: partially. 
I am a reasonably bright guy with a good grasp of English. 
Frankly, the standard 1040 form is pretty close to Greek to me already. 
Yes, I'm all for explaining the form simply (or better yet, simplifying the form itself), but I must ask, if a person can't read or write, how is he to complete the form? 
And if a person has a serious learning disorder, should he even attempt such a task? 
Perhaps a better solution is to provide free filing assistance to people with cognitive disabilities (or better yet, to everyone). 
If there is a reasonable chance of making a part of the IRS site understandable to a person with a learning disability, then by all means make it understandable. 
But where do we draw the line? 
Some seem to think that all such lines are evil, but I disagree. 
There is a point where such efforts become an exercise in futility. 
Another consideration is cost. 
In a perfect world, cost would be no object. 
But then in a perfect world, there would be no disabilities. 
The reality is that most web sites are cash strapped to begin with. 
Providing multiple translations, commissioning graphics or multimedia, etc. is expensive. 
Most of my clients can barely afford a site, let alone expensive graphics and multimedia. 
I'm not concerned about scaring away giant corporations with the WCAG because a) frankly, they can afford it and b) no-one is going to scare them away anyway. 
But I am concerned about pricing small businesses, non-profit organizations, and individuals out of the Web. 
If you think that telling people NOT to use graphics is off-putting, try telling them that they MUST use graphics. 
So what does this have to do with the WCAG? 
Well, take a look at the current working draft of version 2.0: Pay particular attention to Guideline 3: Design for ease of comprehension. 
There are many items here that give me pause, but to keep this posting to an only slightly outrageous length, consider 3.7: Supplement text with graphic or auditory presentations where they will facilitate comprehension of the content. 
Let's say that I wrote a novel and I decide to put the full text on-line for people to download. 
Is my site inaccessible because I didn't supplement the novel with pictures? 
But as published on paper it had no pictures. 
The reason? 
The intended audience was readers. 
The on-line version is identical, but suddenly it's inaccessible? 
Would my site be denied a AAA rating based on this? 
And if the WCAG should at some point become enforced by law (certainly within the realm of possibility), would my site be illegal? 
And if so, would my paperback novel be illegal also? 
Should all novels be forced into comic book format from here out? 
As you can see, this is not a simple issue and the answers are not, IMO, obvious. 
I think that Wayne Myers was right on the money when he wrote about accessibility vs. understandability. 
It is one thing to ensure that documents are available to everyone regardless of disability. 
It is quite another to try to make them understandable. 
The current draft of WCAG 2.0 blurs the line between these two concepts even further than WCAG 1.0 did. 
As I see it, Guideline 3 is more "nice to do" than "need to do." 
Whether it's suggestions apply depends on both the purpose of a site and it's intended audience. 
A government site intended for the general public might need to follow all of these guidelines (and the funds to make that possible should be made available). 
But another site, such as my hypothetical on-line novel, might not need to follow any of the suggestions in Guideline 3 to satisfactorily serve it's intended audience. 
Finally, consider this: What if a person with a cognitive disability wants to put up a web site? 
Should he or she be required to comply with the WCAG? 
(Not an easy proposition since the guidelines are text-only and the language is certainly not "the clearest and simplest language appropriate for a site's content.") 
If a blind man builds a web site, does he have to include graphics? 
If a deaf woman builds a site, must it include audio? 
I don't know that I have the answers to these questions or even that there are simple answers. 
As the current draft of WCAG 2.0 stands, I like section 3. I think the suggestions are good suggestions. 
But I also think that they require good powers of, yes, discrimination. 
I worry about how they may be i nterpreted in a world where most people seem to prefer black and white. 
I also wonder how we are going to measure understandability. 
It is one thing to say that site A doesn't work on screen reader B or that site C provides visual information not accessible to blind users. 
How do we decide when a site is understandable enough? 
WCAG 2.0 says "appropriate for a site's content," but who decides this? 
I wonder if anyone else on this list has had any thoughts on this matter... Sincerely, Charles F. Munat Seattle, Washington I have dealt with this quite a bit and you raise some points which I shall quote below. 
NOte, the first point is merely philosophical. 
dp would that this were true. 
I can think of a thousand reasons why this might be unfair. 
I might be writing a book. 
I might be helping to train a driver. 
I might be studying this in a course setting. 
... dp yes, plainly more subjective. 
dp not to mention telling them what graphics to use. 
dp can it be more specific? 
dp The intended audience of the web should be anyone who can get to it. 
There is nothing more exasperating than to come to what for me is a blank page or a page that says I am using the rong browser or some such nonsense. 
I figure that if it isn't intended for us all, it is wasting space on the World Wide Web. 
dp This is my point. 
if you are going to produce in a medium, you need to be able to use the medium. 
you learn to use the medium before you produce in it. 
would you ask a person who knows nothing about hair styling to write a book about it? 
or do it? 
bad alalogy I know, but it achieves the purpose of looking at the matter. 
any site should follow accessability guidelines. 
dp Speaking as a blind man, Yes. the law exempts no one. 
dp Yes! she does not have to hear it to mark it up. 
she can get the length of the file and the title of the piece and all kinds of info about it. 
This is not a stretch for either the blind man or the deaf woman because the information is available in a medium that they can use. 
On the other hand, for someone to really build a site who needs the access that a person with a severe cognative problem needs, would be a real stretch because developping a site requires some use at least of text. 
This does not however exempt that person from following the guidelines. 
What shall we say. 
Oh, I don't have any text on my site because I don't use text so be forewarned. 
We'd have to get someone to write that one up for us or may we put it in an audio file and or use a signed audio/video? 
I am not making gest here. 
I think as a blind person, I'd be a pitifull excuse for a designer if I said, "I hate graphics therefore, you won't see any of the little buggers on any page I write.". dp To put this another way, good web design including current accessability cpractices can be learned and illusrated. 
beyond that, unless you are specially trained in it, It would be mearly if not impossible to churn out designers that could meet the cognative need as it has been expressed and is now percieved. 
dp I hope to see more.

"It might be [unfair] if there were information available not directly related to driving a bus, but in the absence of such information, I contend that it is not unfairly discriminatory. 
Blind people do not drive buses." 
David Poehlman replied: "Would that this were true. 
I can think of a thousand reasons why this might be unfair. 
I might be writing a book. 
I might be helping to train a driver. 
I might be studying this in a course setting." 
Reply: Agreed. 
But that brings up the question: Is it the responsibility of the site builder to make the site accessible for purposes other than its stated purpose? 
OK, if you were helping to train a driver, that might make sense. 
But if this site is to train drivers does the site owner have an obligation to make the site useful for potential authors and anyone else who wants to check it out? 
It's just an example and obviously not a very good one. 
It's difficult to think of instances where being blind would obviate all need for information. 
But you made another point later that bears on this. 
I'll comment further below. 
"The intended audience of the web should be anyone who can get to it. 
There is nothing more exasperating than to come to what for me is a blank page or a page that says I am using the rong browser or some such nonsense. 
I figure that if it isn't intended for us all, it is wasting space on the World Wide Web." Reply: I have a really hard time with this concept. 
Wasting space? 
How can one waste space on an infinite resource? 
It seems to me that the presumption here is that by making documents accessible via the Web, you are publishing them. 
I don't know how the law views this, but that seems a bit restrictive to me. 
With the increase of full-time, high-bandwidth connections, it gets even trickier. 
My computer has been assigned a static IP address. 
I have a web server on my computer for my own personal use. 
I like my brother to be able to pull stuff off my server, so I've allowed access via the Web. 
Nothing on my server is really personal, so I haven't password protected the pages. 
Or maybe I don't even know how to do that. 
Now, let's say that somehow a spider found my pages and indexed them. 
These are really for my personal use. 
Am I now responsible for making sure that they are accessible just because you might stumble across them someday? 
Isn't that like saying that my front door has to be accessible so that paraplegic solicitors can ring my bell? 
I'm not asking them to come visit me. 
It's different if one is running a business. 
Clearly, businesses should not discriminate unfairly. 
But what if I'm just putting up pages for fun? 
Please note that I'm not advocating any particular position here, just wondering about the limitations. 
Look at it another way. 
Do I have to post my pages in all 4000+ languages? 
Obviously, that's impossible. 
But a speaker of virtually any language might stumble across my pages, so don't I have an obligation to him? 
You see what I mean? 
It is a very complicated issue. 
When it's just a matter of making the document accessible, it's not that difficult. 
But when it comes to making it *understandable*, well, that's a lot more complicated. 
I want to encourage as many people to come on-line as possible. 
I draw a distinction between commercial sites and non-commercial sites. 
I agree with you, David, that commercial sites should be built by professionals, and that professionals should have to know what they're doing. 
And I think that commercial sites ought to be accessible AND understandable *within reason*. 
It's the "within reason" part that's complicated. 
What is reasonable? 
It seems to me that this is where audience comes in to play. 
If my audience is the members of my country club (I don't really belong to one) and none of them speaks Swahili, why should I have to put up a Swahili version of the site? 
And if one of them does speak Swahili, does that mean that I must include a Swahili version? 
As for non-commercial sites, I think we should let anyone do pretty much anything they want. 
I don't want to tell the man with Down's Syndrome that he can't put up a personal page because he doesn't understand HTML well enough. 
And I don't think that the deaf woman I mentioned should have to include audio on her personal site if it's her *personal* site. 
But I'm open to other ideas... (I'm sort of thinking out loud here.) Charles F. Munat Seattle, Washington This is actually a good question to pose and we should be careful that we don't dismiss it too easily with a glib answer. 
As part of the web design process, you make a site which can be used by your chosen audiences. 
If it can be used by other audiences, that's good, but it's not the main purpose; the primary audiences and the site owner's choices for the site's function determine the purpose of the site. 
In nearly all cases, the primary audiences will _not_ fall along disability lines; if you are making a web site on topic X , there's usually a good chance that the audience consisting of "people who care about topic X " will be fairly evenly distributed. 
This means that you can't exclude specific disability types; they are part of your core audience. 
(This is a stumbling block for many designers who want to justify their lack of accessibility; they feel that by saying "I have a specific audience in mind" that it is okay to say "...and that doesn't include disabled people." 
They couldn't be more wrong!) However, in a few cases there -are- some sites which, because of the content, simply can't be made to be useful by people with certain disabilities, or -won't- be useful to those people. 
For example, a web site that teaches -- through the use of a Flash program -- how to drive defensively along a crowded, accident prone street. 
Or for an example that hits closer to home, the Virtual Dog Show site is set up as a photographic contest. 
It is difficult to imagine how a blind user could get full benefit from either site, even with the most accessible coding possible. 
Actually, David, this concept violates a number of good principles for usability and audience-centric design. 
Any site that is designed "for anyone and everyone!" will most likely be a very poor site. 
My web management course stressed not only defining which audiences you want, but also which audiences you don't want -- the ones who you don't want wasting their own time by coming to your site; they should be able to tell quickly if they can't find what they need there, just as other users should be able to tell if they _can_ use the site. 
Yeah, this discussion came up recently on another mailing list I'm on. 
Basically, such sites do have it in their best interests to use standard practices of accessibility, but they have no obligation (legal or possibly moral) to maintain the same level of accessibility as sites which provide services to the public. 
I got dinged myself, for my pages on my site which show photographs from my recent trip to Europe, and the house which my wife and I are buying. 
You can view these at http://kynn.com/photos/ -- originally I just had the raw directory listing, but I found a freeware Mac program which makes index pages and thumbnail images. 
The problem is that it doesn't insert alt text. 
My excuses are as follows: (1) It's not my program, I didn't write it, and this is just a quick- and-dirty job anyway. 
(2) If someone can't see images, well, they're going to be disappointed with _any_ display of photographs, aren't they? 
(3) The file names are meant to be descriptive, and thus are nearly as useful as any alt attributes I'd add anyway. 
(4) I don't have the time to go back and do the job the right way, so a half-assed attempt is better than nothing. 
(5) It's just a personal site and nobody really cares that much; I'm not denying any services or vital information to the public. 
I'm actually not that happy with any of these excuses, although #4 is closest to satisfying my guilty urges.

What's on my bookshelf? 
http://kynn.com/books/ 
first, the space issue. 
Saying a waste of space was another way of saying something like providing dead ends or clogging the super highway with my ill fitting capabilities. 
This is not as critical but the point here is that of knowing. 
I am carefull to stress that there are certain things that if done or not done cause or do not cause x y or z and What happens once that information has been imparted is up to those who use or don't use it. 
I should use another word than space but cannot think of one. 
I understood your point when you made it about the blind person. 
I also understood the point about people putting up web sites. 
I my self have put up pages for fun. 
I don't however want to opt anyone out of a potential obligation because of a disability. 
It seems to me that we are in contradiction if we provide empowering accessability and than obviate the need for it by excusing those with disabilities from providing the same. 
Not on fun or personal sites or even dare I say it inter community sites necessarily but if they know it it might bee good to use it but on those sites when and if they publish them that will be of interest to or read by the general populous. 
I too have a hard time drawing limits around when and when not to publish accessably. 
If you tell someone they don't have to publish accessably than it is possible that others will try to draw lines that make excusing themselves possible. 
Many commercial sites for instance could claim that they are following their printed litterature and thus need to be exempt from the requirements. 
It is their right to make this claim but Inaccessable is inaccessable. 
That helps somewhat because that cannot be excused away. 
Thanks!

Here is a related question: what about mailing lists like this one? 
Most mailing lists require (or at least suggest) the use of plain text. 
There are sound reasons for this wrt accessibility. 
But to make these posts more understandable, wouldn't HTML email be better? 
Then we could include graphics, add color, use different fonts (perhaps even embedding them). 
Or why not use a format such as PDF? 
But this brings up many more questions. 
If I post to an email list, should I have to come up with graphics to accompany my post? 
What if I can't draw? 
What if I can't see? 
And doesn't this further complicate the task? 
Would that tend to exclude some people who couldn't figure out how to work the technology? 
The issues discussed on this list are important, and no-one should be excluded from the discussion (*especially* those with disabilities). 
But how does a person who can't read participate in this list? 
And what about the level of knowledge required to participate? 
For most lists, you're expected to read the archives before posting to avoid repeating topics. 
And you're expected to have familiarity with the lingo. 
Should our posts explain what WCAG stands for every time we mention it? 
Should we be defining the meaning of each topic in the context? 
Should we be using headings, etc. in every email? 
Then there's the time aspect. 
Writing well requires rewriting, proofreading, etc. 
If each email turns into a mini web page, the time required to produce one goes up dramatically. 
Wouldn't this tend to quell discussion on this list and exclude those with limited time? 
The more I think about the implications of making everything understandable to everyone, the more complicated it gets. 
Start thinking about language barriers on an international list such as this one and it gets even more complicated. 
Where do we draw the line? 
What is accessible/understandable enough? 
If there is a conflict between making a page/post more accessible and making it more understandable, which way do we go? 
Charles Munat, Seattle, Washington In theory, yes. 
Properly marked up text is ALWAYS (well, almost always, if we looked hard enough we may be able to find exceptions) going to be "more accessible" -- in theory -- than plaintext. 
In practice, of course, we know there're several problems (size, user agent support, security, privacy) with HTML mail which makes it hard to deploy as a general solution. 
A smart mailing list system would be able to take either HTML text or plaintext, and send users the output in the appropriate format according to that user's preferences upon subscribing. 
--Kynn Kynn Bartlett kynn@idyllmtn.com 
It's nothing like as clear cut as this. 
For instance, businesses discriminate against certain classes of people by not advertising in their neigbourhoods, or not providing outlets in those neighbourhoods. 
Discrimination by not investing is quite normal practice. 
There is a system in the UK, probably from the states, called ACORN (a classification of residential neighbourhoods), and some free to recipient advertising magazines make a point that they are only distributed in certain classification; there are many other examples. 
It may affect the cost of selling. 
Most businesses would probably argue that discrimination that tends to maximise their profits is fair. 
They only move from this when their other customers learn of this and get a conscience, or their cost structures are distorted by governments. 
(For many years, DIY stores in the UK traded illegally on Sundays, because the state imposed fines were less than the extra profit; Sunday trading is now legal.) 
Only lawyers will profit from this sort of clause. 
Contractors do not like contracts with open ended conditions like this. 
At least in the UK, there is a tradition of allowing individuals to do things which are not allowed to businesses. 
There is also the point that non-business pages act as self training, and are more likely to carry real information. 
There are public policy advantages in only enforcing rules against businesses. 
Once you do that, the people whose goal is supplying information may well improve, as they tend to learn their bad habits from the commercial pages. 
Vanity pages are generally harmless. 
Governments probably don't care if dodgy sites remain of low accessibility! 
What they do in theory is arrange the population in order of the likely profit from each of them++. 
That profit depends on their spending power and the cost of selling to them. 
They then define a cut-off after which they reckon that they will make more money by investing in the next generation of product for the most profitable customers rather than in reaching the remaining prospects with the original product, or will lose the market to competitors because their development timescales will be too long. 
In practice, the process is much less scientific than this, with gut feeling used to rank people, profits not properly balanced against costs, and heuristics, like the 80:20 rule, used to decide when to consider the market sufficiently saturated. 
Looking after the pennies to save the pounds is an easy way of managing projects; it allows decisions to be devolved. 
Making sites accessible to the disabled is perceived as increasing costs. 
The disabled are perceived of as being less affluent, and I think there is a lot of truth in this. 
(Businesses are probably a lot less rational than they would like to be. 
One employee may over do the ornamentation, because they are fun for them, and another may put in more accessibility than the brief calls for.) ++ You may end up with more than one dimension, which I'll ignore. 
Most HTML email client produce HTML that is only designed to produce a rich text effect (at one stage, I believe, Outlook worked with HTML but not the official MIME rich text format!). 
As such, it tends to represent the personality of the author much more than the structure of the content. 
Unstructured HTML is very common on the web, but even more common in email. 
Choice of body text font, background textures, and ornate "signatures" are the most common results of HTML email. 
I don't think I've ever seen an embedded image, and the de facto standard user agent (Outlook) makes them difficult to do, if they can be done at all. 
Also, mailing lists tend to be fairly spontaneous things. 
Doing HTML properly means creating a proper outline for the article, etc. 
It is actually not that uncommon to find HTML email with absolutely no markup that wasn't in the plain text version. 
If one took it to the extreme, requiring a carefully constructed article would discriminate against anyone not paid to discuss accessibility or sell related products or services. 
I've actually moved handling this list to home because it was taking too much time. 
The typical way that business correspondence handles the case of a more formal email is to attach a Microsoft Word document containing the main message. 
But I don't think mailing lists should be that formal, and MS Word is proprietory, and in its latest versions, a closed format. 
I do note though that an increasing number of people seem to expect email to be written in the style of a formal business letter, with proper salutations in the body, etc. Personally I think that this is losing its role as an intermediate stage between spoken communication and formal writing. 
a quick note on profets, the disabled have friends, coleagues and families and other associates. 
I have raised the bar on many occasions when I envoked the gosip theory in my discussion.
