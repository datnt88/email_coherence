<s> Hi all, there's a new XML Signature implementation in town ;-)) Late, but anyhow, here it is.  </s>
<s> I did not yet prepare the documentation for it completely, I do not have a markting label, but what I can tell you is the following: - The (old) website is at [1]; there are also download instructions how to get the sources using CVS. - Today, I packed an HTTP-downloadable package [2] which includes everything you need (except of the JAVA Development Kit).  </s>
<s> For easy compiling and testing, please use the Ant make-tool.  </s>
<s> The ZIP is 2.8 MB (sorry for this inconvenience).  </s>
<s> This is because Xerces and Xalan are included.  </s>
<s> - The sources can be browsed online using the Web-CVS Front on Apache [3].  </s>
<s> For discussion on this peace of software, there are mailing lists on xml.apache.org  </s>
<s> [4].  </s>
<s> - The complete project is a new XML Apache project under Apache License.  </s>
<s> See [5] for more on the License.  </s>
<s> We will lauch the web-site in 1-2 weeks when the documentation is nicer to read... Joseph, I hope you had nice vacation and that this is a good start for the new week..  </s>
<s> About the inter-op:  </s>
<s> Simply to say what did _not_ work from the three tables on [6]: - merlin-xmldsig-sixteen.tar.gz - Manifest DigestValue valdiation: NO (not yet, ask again in a week) - The Rest: Y1 - merlin-xmldsig-sixteen.tar.gz - Canonicalization minimal (deprecated): NO - The Rest: Y1 - merlin-xmldsig-fifteen.tar.gz - Everything: Y1  </s>
<s> I hope you can successfully check it out... Best regards, Christian [1] http://www.xmlsecurity.org/  </s>

<s> Hi all, forgot to attach some samples ... Sorry.. Christian  </s>
<s> Thank you, I've updated the Overview and Interop Matrix.  </s>

<s> Hi Joseph, Update of the Matrix ;-)) Canonical XML with comments is Y1 and Manifest DigestValue generation/valdiation is Y1, too...  </s>
<s> The URL for my implementation is (at the moment) and will move to when I'm finished with the documentation.  </s>
<s> Please do _not_ use because this was the old project page which was not really used and has no pointers to the source code... Best regards, Christian --On Freitag, 12. Oktober 2001 12:07 -0400 Joseph Reagle reagle@w3.org  </s>
<s> Hi all, in [1] I attached some samples.  </s>
<s> Sorry, I have added a Base64 transform at an inappropriate place and didn't recognise that.  </s>
<s> Here, attached is the corrected sample.  </s>
<s> Best regards, Christian [1]  </s>
<s> Hi all, hi Merlin, I have to attach the sample, again.  </s>
<s> The former one did not verify cause I tried to re-create a very sophisticated Reference from Merlin, and my implementation is not able to create something like this.  </s>
<s> Merlin, the Reference: Transform Algorithm="http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-xpath-19991116" ancestor-or-self::dsig:SignedInfo and count(ancestor-or-self::dsig:Reference | here()/ancestor::dsig:Reference[1]) count(ancestor-or-self::dsig:Reference) or count(ancestor-or-self::node() | id('notaries')) = count(ancestor-or-self::node()) DigestMethod Algorithm="http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#sha1" / was really horrible.  </s>
<s> I could not generate something like this... Do you see a case where something like this is needed?  </s>
<s> I can verify it, but I can't create that from scratch, because the References are filled with DigestValues sequentially.  </s>
<s> Did you create that Reference at last and then insert it in the middle of your SignedInfo?  </s>
<s> Wow - geek stuff ;-)) Best regards, Christian  </s>
<s> Hi Christian, Apart from the manifest and the reference below, your signature verifies for me.  </s>
<s> In response to your questions; no, it is a useless example that should never have a real-world use; and no, it was generated automatically from the template.  </s>
<s> It was just a test of here(), id() and prioritization of references during generation.  </s>
<s> Temporarily interesting, but of no practical use.  </s>
