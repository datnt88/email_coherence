<s> The main difference is whether the "pipe" offers responsive interaction with the server, such that "missing" URI objects can/cannot easily be resolved by just asking for the "missing" URI item across the available "pipe".  </s>

<s> Jacob, 1) HTTP vs. "web browsing" It would be useful to consider separating "HTTP" out from the application of "web browsing", in the same way that "SMTP" is separate from the application of "mail".  </s>
<s> Currently, the world commonly uses "HTTP" and "HTML" and "URL" and various other common components to deploy the "web browsing" application.  </s>
<s> HTTP is also used for many other applications, and the "web browsing" application can be supported using many other protocols, as indicated by the URL scheme employed.  </s>
<s> HTTP places no restrictions on what media types it transports.  </s>
<s> MHTML defines a new media type, "multipart/related".  </s>
<s> The definition of "multipart/related" must be independent of the protocols which are used to transport it.  </s>
<s> I would urge that the definition of "multipart/related" be separated from the application of "mailing someone a web page" (MHTML).  </s>
<s> The definition of "multipart/related" should make clear that it is a general extension to MIME multipart, and applies to *all* applications that use MIME (including web browsing).  </s>
<s> I would object to having the MHTML say that it 'applies to HTTP' since such a statement would contribute to the existing confusion between the transport protocol (HTTP), the media types it is used to transport, and the applications that are being supported by such a combination.  </s>
<s> Regards, Larry  </s>
<s> I agree with Larry's analysis and conclusions (though so agreeing may surprise almost everyone;-)... Our agreeing may actually be shocking!  </s>
<s> Larry and I have not discussed what I am going to say here, but I hope he will find that it agrees with his statements included below.  </s>
<s> We did not discuss his message before he mailed it either;-)...  </s>
<s> I think that we have been slowly converging on our positions over time, to the point of understanding that HTTP and SMTP/RFC822 and other different application transports must be kept separate from MIME Content-Typing.  </s>
<s> Perhaps part of what we are recognizing is that there are two classes of "TRANSPORT" protocols.  </s>
<s> One just above the IP level that deals with data streams and user datagrams that deal with interoperability, and another class just below MIME that deals with transport of Application Information Objects to provide what I like to call "interworkability".  </s>
<s> The whole idea of MIME Content-typing is to achieve transport independence from this application transport level, and our new Multipart/Related specs (et al) must fully support this idea.  </s>
<s> That "web browsing" and "mail" are very different user paradigms for exchanging end user application information should be now be a well established fact, and the need to be able to use both to exchange the same information objects in different situations should also be well established.  </s>
<s> Neither of our two primary application transports (HTTP and SMTP/RFC822) will ever replace the other and we should expect that many new variations will be invented between these two extremes to add lots more variety to the ways that we transport MIME wrapped entities.  </s>
<s> So, MIME looks to me to be a higher level second "neck" for the Internet "hourglass" model, with IP at one neck and MIME at the other.  </s>
<s> Looking at things this way seems to be very helpful to me.  </s>
<s> The main thing is to step "out of the box" and see that the Internet Protocol Suite need not be limited to having only one "neck".  </s>

<s> My initial reactions to your questions Jacob are:  </s>
<s> Yes. We have implemented it (Internet Explorer 4.0 for Win32 supports it).  </s>
<s> I belive the Netscape folks said that Navigator/Communicator would support this too.  </s>
<s> Yes. It should be generic for anything that supports MIME.  </s>
<s> One however must question whether FTP really supports MIME, but for example it is clearly supported for POP3 &amp; IMAP.  </s>
<s> Yes.  </s>
<s> It certainly would be a good idea for other folks to be aware of this work.  </s>
<s> I'm not sure what other MIME related groups should be told about it.  </s>
<s> I also think that we have enough of the "right people" who are pay attention in this group to apply these results broadly, especially given that folks like myself, Larry and Roy are (/ have become) involved.  </s>
<s> I think posting messages to various groups is appropriate, but I don't see any need for formal/informal liason.  </s>
<s> Alex  </s>
<s> Excellent!  </s>
<s> Why just TWO classes?  </s>
<s> Within this expanded idea of a "transport" protocol (which I accept) I would suggest that "transport" protocols can be identified at several levels within an extended protocol stack.  </s>
<s> As new "applications" are constructed and become widely deployed, I would hope to see layered architectures within those applications which separate issues of control, data transport, information representation, user interface, etc. Hence these new applications would define protocols which themselves can be used as a basis for future developments.  </s>
<s> I think what you describe is just a step in a continuing evolutionary process of building new applications upon the infrastructure of previous applications.  </s>

<s> I can see your point about the possibility of proliferating transports between TCP and MIME, but we need to be careful to rememeber that in the hourglass model of the Internet, there has to be only one protocol at each neck.  </s>
<s> I propose IP and MIME as two such "necks".  </s>
<s> I can speculate that there may be additional such necks above MIME, but I do not see any more necks between IP and MIME.  </s>
<s> I have no concern about proliferating transports like SMTP, FTP, HTTP, SMXP, et al, between the IP and MIME necks.  </s>
<s> These have the effect of supporting usefully different styles and modes of interworking among application users, without causing the application information objects that they work with to become dependent on such verious transports.  </s>
<s> But, it is critical to recognize the parallels between necks which provide tagging and bagging tools to provide "good-enough" typing, and "datagram" chunking, which at the MIME level allows us to deal with structured content (which parallels Object Modeling in APIs) and the IP neck, where datagram chunking allows us to deal with both streaming content and with user datagrams, among other things.  </s>
<s> We also need to remind ourselves to not confuse PROTOCOL with APIs.  </s>
<s> Best...\Stef PS: As MHTML Chair, I wonder if we are getting a bit far off topic, though I am vitally interested in these issues.  </s>
<s> Is this a topic that should be sponsored by some higher level group like the IETF APP Directorate?  </s>
<s> I think we are really working on an abstract model for application support protocol, which as a meta level issue does not have a natural home in any of the APP WGs.  </s>
