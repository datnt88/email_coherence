<s> Hello All, The ALT "texst balloon" that was talked about during the conference call has been posted to the web site at: It is a slightly shortened version of the image recommendations already posted (with some of the stronger language mentionned by William).  </s>
<s> Please comment to this list so we can hammer out the quinks.  </s>

<s> We have been reminded (in the GL group) that client-side image maps are not backwards compatible and that text-links are a good idea for them also.  </s>
<s> However, we haven't yet adjusted the guidelines to reflect this since we are working to determine a "least common denominator" (if possible.  </s>
<s> we are synthesizing as much browser usage data for this year as possible to get a feel for which versions of browsers are still in use.  </s>
<s> if you have data to contribute to this, please contact me.  </s>
<s> we are targeting sites related to disability access and universal design).  </s>
<s> The recommendations for images used as bullets have changed since the 0414 release.  </s>
<s> The most recent text is included after this paragraph.  </s>
<s> From what I've gathered, this is satisfactory to the group, but we'll see what happens when we actually get it out there smile .  </s>
<s> This has changed *a lot* due to tests we performed to determine how browsers handle style sheet generated bullets.  </s>
<s> There are outstanding issues here as well - but that seems to be the nature of the beast.  </s>
<s> Begin included text from most recent version of guidelines.  </s>
<s> this is taken from the "Bullets" section of Appendix B: Mark up list items correctly.  </s>
<s> For unordered lists use style sheets to provide alternative bullets (Example 1).  </s>
<s> If images are not loaded, the browser will draw a default bullet.  </s>
<s> Avoid using images as bullets (Example 2).  </s>
<s> However, if this method is used, the alternative text for the image should be "Item:".  </s>
<s> In the future, aural style sheets may be used to provide audible cues preceeding bullets.  </s>
<s> Example 1: Example 2: (Deprecated) DD IMG src="star.gif"  </s>
<s> alt="Item:" Audrey DD IMG src="star.gif"  </s>
<s> alt="Item:" Laurie Avoid lists where bullets provide additional information.  </s>
<s> However, if used, provide the meaning of the bullet as a short phrase in the alternative text (Example 2).  </s>
<s> Provide a label before or after the list item phrase (Example 1) to ensure everyone gets the message while the bullet provides additional distinction between old and new items.  </s>
<s> This example also shows the use of style sheets to create stylized text instead of using bitmap text.  </s>
<s> Example 1: STYLE ... !-- .newtxt  </s>
<s> { font-weight : bold; color : red; background : yellow } .newbullet  </s>
<s> {list-style : url(yellow.gif)  </s>
<s> }-- /STYLE Example 2: (Deprecated) End included text.  </s>

<s> I have discussed our proposal with Judy who seems quite positive and will pass it by Daniel.  </s>
<s> The proposal is that we will publish one guideline in great detail and take the guideline through the entire process: editing, evaluation, adoption, advocacy, implimentation with target developers, and evaluation of author compliance and reaction to prompting.  </s>
<s> Choosing one guideline makes the task less daunting and harder to ignore or dismiss for the developer, also we are choosing meaningful Alt-text because it is an area where there is no wiggle room: it is essential.  </s>
<s> When we publish our guidelines we will include a short list of other guidelines in far less detail.  </s>
<s> Jan has posted the trail guideline at: please review it in detail and send your comments to the list so we can finalize the document in the next few days.  </s>
