The current requirements section is a list of "candidate requirements" not a complete list of all we will cover. 
Rather than requirement 3.7, which names calls out date and time datatypes, I suggest we include a requirement to identify a core set of XSD datatypes that implementations will support. 
At the F2F, we had just before the date/time requirement: * Queries supporting datatypes xsd:integer and xsd:float with operations: less than, equal, greater than [DATATYPES-IF] which we didn't explicitly vote on (its not recorded anyway). 
I am neutral as to whether we should identify any datatypes now. 
If it is a matter of debate, let's not and leave space for a debate, including liaising with other groups. 
If we do identify some datatypes now, and I'm not an XSD expert, I suggest some numeric types and string at least. 
Maybe a mention of date/time. 
(I would prefer to see date/time in the final recommendation as users ask for them but date/time is not trivial.) Suggestion: 
3.7 Support for XSD Datatypes The query language design must identify a set of XSD datatypes and operations on these datatypes. 
Test case of queries involving datatype operations will be developed.

I'd reword the heading as 
3.7 Support for a subset of XSD Datatypes just to reinforce the notion we're not going to be implementing support for all of them.

Good point - I support the rewording.

Andy, I agree with your rewording 3.7 Support for XSD Datatypes The query language design must identify a set of XSD datatypes and operations on these datatypes. 
Test case of queries involving datatype operations will be developed.
