<s> OK, thanks to a lot of effort and comment, there's a draft XML FAQ at There's obviously lots of bits missing at this stage, and probably a lot of mistakes too, so I'd be grateful for all comments.  </s>
<s> PLEASE, if you've got stuff to say, could you use a subject line of XML FAQ like this one, so I can filter it to /dev/nuHHHH the right place.  </s>
<s> THose who have Panorama might want to give it a try too, as it's done in DocBook, use http://www.ucc.ie/xml/faq.sgml  </s>
<s> ///Peter  </s>
<s> Thanks to everyone who contributed to the FAQ and to Peter Flynn for putting it together.  </s>
<s> This is going to me a major resource.  </s>
<s> Peter, when do you plan to go public with this?  </s>
<s> Jon  </s>
<s> I guess when people agree it's usable enough to start with.  </s>
<s> Thanks to all those who have been sending in stuff.  </s>
<s> I guess I'll make the mods next weekend and launch it on an unsuspecting world next Monday unless anyone feels strongly... ///Peter  </s>
