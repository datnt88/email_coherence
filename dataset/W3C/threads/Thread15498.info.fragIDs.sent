<s> Dan Connolly, chair of the HTML working group has ruled that the 4.0 spec should strictly adhere to RFC2070 for the required treatment of the Q element which is used for excerpts that are inlined as part of a paragraph.  </s>
<s> My concern is that requiring browsers to insert quotation marks around the contents of each Q ... /Q element will strongly discourage authors from using this element.since  </s>
<s> as most browsers don't yet do this, they will have to include  </s>
<s> the quotatation marks in the content directly.  </s>
<s> Following Dan's  </s>
<s> ruling would then lead to doubled up quotation marks.  </s>
<s> Which in my opinion will put authors off.  </s>

<s> This post from Dave is the quickturn issue that Judy gave us a heads-up about.  </s>
<s> Look it over.  </s>
<s> What do you think?  </s>
<s> -- Al  </s>
<s> I have now read some of the messages which Dave has helpfully cited, though not all of them, due to a local network problem.  </s>
<s> However, I have several comments to make.  </s>
<s> 1. The Q element is important for purposes of accessibility, since it allows audio and braille styles to control the rendering of quotations.  </s>
<s> This functionality can not be achieved if the quotation marks are inserted directly.  </s>
<s> 2. In respect of audio user agents, the quotation marks are irrelevant.  </s>
<s> Thus, regardless of whether or not it is decided that the HTML 4.0 specification should adhere strictly to RFC 2070, it is obvious that speech-based user agents will employ changes in voice characteristics rather than quotation marks to highlight in-line quotations.  </s>
<s> To that extent, they constitute an exception to the user agent behaviour mandated by RFC 2070.  </s>
<s> 3. In English braille, the conventions concerning quotation marks are slightly different from those of print.  </s>
<s> Double quotation marks are used to denote the outermost level of quotation; inner quotations are indicated by single quotation marks.  </s>
<s> This is the inverse of print conventions.  </s>
<s> Thus, when formatting a document in braille, it would be preferable that the insertion of quotation marks be the responsibility of the user agent, subject to any applicable style sheets.  </s>
<s> 4. It is the responsibility of the HTML working group to decide whether the specification should conform to RFC 2070 in requiring the user agent to introduce the quotation marks.  </s>
<s> From the standpoint of accessibility, the most important point is that the Q element be implemented by user agents and deployed widely by authors in their HTML documents.  </s>
<s> Whether compliance with RFC 2070 would constitute a significant obstacle to its widespread acceptance, and if so whether this justifies a departure from the RFC requirement, is an issue that is best resolved by the HTML WG in negotiation with vendors of user agents, authoring tools, etc.  </s>
<s> My personal opinion is that by default, user agents should detect whether quotation marks have already been supplied at the beginning and end of the quoted passage, and insert them only if they are not already present.  </s>
<s> A superfluous set of quotation marks is as undesirable in braille as it is in print.  </s>
<s> Here is a solution that may be worth considering: 1.  </s>
<s> The user agent must delete any quotation marks that occur in the text immediately adjacent to the start and end tags of the Q element.  </s>
<s> 2. Once any such quotation marks have been deleted, the user agent is required to insert quotation marks in accordance with any applicable style sheet.  </s>
<s> Speech-based user agents are of course exempt from this requirement.  </s>
<s> Incidentally, the practice of misusing the BLOCKQUOTE element as a means of indenting text in circumstances in which no quotation is intended, should be strongly discouraged.  </s>
<s> This issue ought to be discussed in the WAI markup guidelines.  </s>
<s> In braille, block quotations are treated identically to in-line quotations.  </s>
<s> They are never indented, and are always enclosed in quotation marks.  </s>
<s> Sometimes a long quotation is treated as though it were a separate paragraph, in which case the first line only is indented, and the text is surrounded by quotation marks.  </s>
<s> Thus, the misuse of BLOCKQUOTE would be of concern to braille readers.  </s>
<s> to follow up on what Jason White said:  </s>
<s> If you are using styles, the styles would recognize a SPAN with a CLASS indicating quotation, would they?  </s>
<s> Aha! another area where English is not English.  </s>
<s> To get the quote styling correct one will need to distinguish national variations in English style.  </s>
<s> The Braille quoting is done in U.S. style.  </s>
<s> See e.g. "The Chicago Manual of Style" rule 10.26.  </s>

<s> to follow up on what Dave Raggett said:  </s>
<s> Does the chair always wield peremptory decision powers, or are you in some kind of a crunch to get the Proposed Recommendation release out?  </s>
<s> -- Al  </s>
<s> Thank you for reminding me of this possibility.  </s>
<s> Unfortunately, most HTML authors and style sheet creators would probably not think of it either, unless of course it were documented in WAI markup guidelines.  </s>
<s> In any case, I still prefer the Q element, which is specifically intended to represent quotations and is included as part of HTML itself.  </s>
<s> It would be best for accessibility if Q were used widely.  </s>
<s> Al,  </s>
<s> We had a heads-up that this might be coming through for quick review, and yes, there is some time pressure on the HTML 4.0 spec and so Dan has had to make a procedural determination here.  </s>
<s> In any case, I appreciate that the HC WG is already working this issue over, and hope that with Jason's and other's suggestions we will be able to come up with a solution that addresses the concern that Dave has raised.  </s>
<s> - Judy  </s>
<s> to follow up on what Judy Brewer said:  </s>
<s> I believe that reasonable accommodation requires reasonableness on both sides.  </s>
<s> What we decide now is a procedural choice as well.  </s>
<s> If this problem is an absolute show-stopper for access reasons, we need to tell the HTML group NOW.  </s>
<s> If it is marginal, we can still raise a concern after the PR goes out.  </s>
<s> As I understand it none of the suggestions about smart styling (adapting to quotes at the edges of the Q tag content) are new, compared to what has been considered by the HTML group.  </s>
<s> Attempts at smart styles will also result in some broken formatting.  </s>
<s> The depressing effect on Q tag usage will not be entirely removed by the specification provisions as stated in the October 17 draft.  </s>
<s> Dan didn't just rule on the procedure, he ruled on the substance.  </s>
<s> I personally believe he is mis-reading the subject RFC as saying what should be done when quotes _do_ appear, framing the rest of the Q tag content.  </s>
<s> I think it doesn't say.  </s>
<s> But that is not what we have been asked to decide.  </s>
<s> We need to decide whether the _access denial_ caused by this specification provision requires that we ask for reconsideration.  </s>
<s> Everybody please put on your thinking caps, not so much to re-craft the spec, but to try to evaluate the severity of the damage.  </s>
<s> Is it a serious _access_ issue?  </s>
<s> Or is it a style issue that Braille and audio users care about along with every one else -- maybe even a little more.  </s>
<s> In the latter case, it may not be appropriate to ask for immediate reconsideration by reason of inaccessibility.  </s>
<s> -- Al  </s>
<s> We are in a crunch and the group agreed to grant Dan special powers ... (now where have we heard that before :) Regards, -- Dave Raggett dsr@w3.org  </s>
<s> http://www.w3.org/People/Raggett World Wide Web Consortium (on assignment from HP Labs)  </s>
<s> to follow up on what Jason White said:  </s>
<s> It would be best for accessibility if Q were used widely.  </s>
<s> How can we assess the severity of accessibility damage if Q is wounded and on the "injured reserve," off the playing field?  </s>
<s> For the purposes of isolating one question, let's stipulate some assumptions: ASSUMPTIONS: Let's stipulate that using Q and styles is the best all around.  </s>
<s> Let's stipulate that under the transitional situation migrating from browser rarely inserts quote marks for you around Q content to browser always inserts quote marks for you around Q content that authors largely avoid Q. Let's assume the worst case, that they just insert literal quotation marks in the text content of their HTML.  </s>
<s> QUESTION: What happens?  </s>
<s> What I have learned so far suggests that there are the following negative consequences: Braille: Users get quotes with single quotes where double quotes should be and vice versa.  </s>
<s> Speech: Some paragraphs with inline quotes have to be re-read with punctuation on to grasp the flow.  </s>
<s> Is that the full extent of the degradation?  </s>
<s> Or are some pages now simply incomprehensible?  </s>
<s> How would you characterize the severity of impact?  </s>
<s> That's what I would like us to understand better.  </s>
<s> -- Al  </s>
