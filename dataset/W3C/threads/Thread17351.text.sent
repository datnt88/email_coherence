-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- Hash: SHA1 Hi, I'm trying to create a little website with my CV and other information. 
I'm trying to make it as accessible as possible, but now i'm in doubt if i should use a table for my cv or do it using divs and css. 
I want to create a cv similar to the examples at looks like: Firstname: Jeroen Lastname: Budts Birthday: 1983-10-19 Kind regards, Jeroen Budts Person xmlns="http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/"

I envision a header element followed by a table containing a column of dates and a column of jobs/schools/other. 
This would be repeated some number of times in the document. 
You could even use a table caption instead of a header element in some cases, but right now there is better support for viewing and navigating document structure by headers than by table captions.

IMHO a dl is more appropriate. 
I used one at http://www.hackcraft.net/cv/ , and while only the print rendering has the dd directly across from the dt (to make it look like the above) this could of course be done on the screen rendering if you wanted as well.

Now this confuses me. 
Are you saying that in the above "Jeroen" is a description of the term "Firstname" ?

: The use of definition lists for general name/value pairs is a bit of a stretch of the semantics, but a common one (em, I thought, maybe I'm completely wrong on this). 
I've seen it similarly used for heirarchical data and it's only just occurring to me that perhaps this is HTML abuse. 
You mean my old-fashioned spelling of vit?? Well using the ligature in a Latin word seems correct to me from my very limited knowledge of Latin orthography. 
Using it in English words such as arch?ology is something I did once in what I realise now was a pretentious affectation, but still do because I'm used to it. 
So whether I'm being correct or pretentious depends on whether you consider "curriculum vit?/vitae" to be Latin or English derived from Latin. 
If the Americans can defend reducing ligatured ae and oe to a mere ugly e then I can much more easily defend retaining the ligature. 
I did worry about how it might appear given that I was looking for a job at the time I first wrote it and at the time google could find no English-language use of "curriculum vit?" rather than "curriculum vitae" though of course it could find plenty of uses of vit? 
(in particular with regards to Vatican documents). 
Now "curriculum vit?" appears to be a lot more common, I wonder if I've started a trend.

Quoting Jon Hanna jon@hackcraft.net : From http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/lists.html : "Another application of DL, for example, is for marking up dialogues, with each DT naming a speaker, and each DD containing his or her words." 
That clearly isn't a matter of terms and descriptions, so I think it justifies the use of dl for general name/value pairs. 
I'm now happy again that this isn't HTML abuse, and indeed is quite appropriate.
