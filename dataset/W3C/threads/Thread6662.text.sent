Hi, The markup validator at http://validator.w3.org showed a result page containing a link to Unfortunately this html document does not have an anchor called "not-allowed-contained" (although it does have "not-allowed" and "not-contained"). 
I was trying to validate http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au (which is missing a DOCTYPE, so I forced it to HTML 4.01 Transitional). 
Regards, Luke.

This is a known problem; it has been fixed in the current beta version of the validator, running at http://validator.w3.org:8001/ Thanks for the feedback.
