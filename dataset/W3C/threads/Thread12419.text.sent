I like Dave Raggett's plain English writing style, and approach to the guides. 
This usually doesn't make a difference in HTML but as a developer, I've found that having the elements be in CAPS and the attributes lowercase makes it a heck of a lot easier to edit an HTML document by hand. 
As David mentions at the top of the document, many people still write HTML by hand. 
In order to easily distinguish actual content from the markup, having the elements be in CAPS are important. 
Thoughts?

NAW is the North American "chapter" of the World Organization of Webmasters From Agenda for WAI EO WG meeting August 27 1998 Requested comment on sample tutorials - Dave Raggett's draft tutorial on HTML http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Guide/ - and CSS http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Guide/style.html I like Dave Raggett's plain English writing style, and approach to the guides. 
I am unclear as to whether the material on accessibility is to be left implicit in some areas and made explicit in others. 
For example - providing a distinctive title for a page is useful for everybody (bookmarks etc.), so is there no need to stress the accessibility advantages? 
Or should they be mentioned to reinforce the justification for the overhead of providing a meaningful title for every page? 
To people who are aware of accessibility issues, it may seem as if the text is belabouring the point. 
To people who are not aware of the issues it is novel material which would not ordinarily have occurred to them. 
I've been working on a sample html document which is annotated for accessibility techniques etc. 
I wondered if it might be useful for the reader if the Raggett 10 Minute Guide had something similar which used examples from the text? 
The comments should probably be shorter and the language is not plain enough, but I offer the following as an outline of what I suggest. 
For example: !-- Title aids navigation because a brief, descriptive page title can reflect the name and hierarchy of the web site. 
Good titles also make it easier to recognise pages in a history list or collection of bookmarks. 
-- !-- Heading levels should only be used to structure a document, and not to contrive formatting effects such as font size. 
Style sheets are a more elegant solution for formatting-- p This is the first paragraph. 
p This is the second paragraph. 
p Another paragraph li the first list item li the second list item li first nested item li second nested item li the third list item !-- List elements should only be used to create lists, and not to contrive formatting effects such as indentation. 
Style sheets are a more elegant solution for formatting -- p Another paragraph img src="peter.jpeg" 
width="200" height="150" alt="My friend Peter" longdesc="peter.html" 
!-- Paragraph text with an illustration. 
Use of the alt and longdesc attributes means that people who can not see the screen have access to both short and more detailed descriptions of the picture, and its information. 
-- p Another paragraph This a link to a href="peter.html" 
Peter's page /a !-- Paragraph text with a link. 
The descriptive name means that users have a good idea of the content of the link and where it will take them. 
-- Stella O'Brien, KO2 Thanks for the suggestion. 
I carried out a spot of user-testing on the html guide and found that people preferred examples to be more realistic. 
The guide currently uses descriptive values to indicate the role of markup, e.g. versus I suspect that mixing the commentary text with the example markup may confuse people. 
I hope to revise and extend the guide as soon as I can get some time free. 
Unfortunately, this may take a while as things are pretty hectic for me right now.

http://www.w3.org/People/Raggett World Wide Web Consortium (on assignment from HP Labs) We used this convention for the HTML 4.0 spec. 
However, when editing by hand, it is much easier to use lowercase through out. 
My HTML tidy utility [1] makes it trivial to change your mind though. 
The next generation of HTML will be written in XML which is case sensitive. 
The HTML working group will have to formally decide which case to adopt. 
My expectation is that lower case will prevail.
