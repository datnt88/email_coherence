<s> I think 2 and 3 are clearer, but 1 is slightly simpler.  </s>
<s> Whichever you choose, it is important to use the term "content" rather  </s>
<s> than "site" because the latter implies that the conformance claim applies to the entire site, whereas in fact the implementor has complete flexibility in defining the scope of the conformance claim, which can encompass anything from a single document to a whole web site.  </s>
<s> As a related issue we need to be careful where we use the term "site" in the guidelines, and work out whether there are any contexts in which we really mean it.  </s>
<s> The term isn't defined anywhere, which just makes it worse and adds to the ambiguity.  </s>
<s> Hi, i think option 2 is more "clear" but tecnically i think is best to use option 1.  </s>
<s> Also, about my IRC message in the last meeting: "I suggest for "conformity" of the document to use in Appendix B the same style of paragraph of level 2 and three, starting level one with "At level 1,..." have the group considered this change?  </s>
