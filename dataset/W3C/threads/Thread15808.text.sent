Hi everyone. 
I have only one accessiblity problem with my web sites. 
I was wondering if anyone knew how I could correct it. 
I use Pagecount counter and it will be not approved by Bobby cause it needs to be formatted into a client-side image map. 
I have tried to do this and I even have the nice people at Pagecount working on it, but they are not sure how to do it either. 
**Smile** Does anyone know how to do this and let me know? 
I would be most appreciative.

Hey folks. 
Remember that Bobby is not perfect, but an attempt to automatically check your code. 
For that matter the guidelines are probably not perfect either. 
The difficulty here is that Bobby has in the past given 4 stars to inaccessible websites, and only one to very accessible ones. 
These things need to be tempered with a bit of old-fashioned rainpower to work as well as possible. 
I had a look at Richard's deafwatch front page ( http://www.deafwatch.com/ ), and thought that it was not too bad. 
Improvements could be made by removing MARQUEE as it is not an HTML element, giving IMAGES titles and longdesc/D-links as well as ALT text (more work, but hopefully it can be partially automated. 
My _personal_ feeling is that LONGDESC and a D-link should both be used, pointing to the same thing, that TITLE should provide the functional description of a resource and that ALT should attempt to capture whatever is most important in a few succinct words) and by using style sheets instead of hard-formatted styles. 
But so far as I can see there is nothing actually inaccessible about the page as it stands. 
(Any thoughts folks?) Charles McCathieNevile I'm not clear what you are asking for. 
The guidelines do include an example of client-side image maps: IMG src="welcome.gif" 
alt="Image map of areas in the library" usemap="#map1" AREA shape="rect" coords="0,0,30,30" href="reference.html" 
alt="Reference" AREA shape="rect" coords="34,34,100,100" href="media.html" 
alt="Audio Visual lab" The idea is simple. 
The img alt attribute is used to name the text menu, with each entry labelled by the alt attribute for each area element. 
A further point is to keep the alt text to 12 characters or shorter. 
This will be important for access by cell phones and devices with small displays.
