Just as an FYI, I ran a copy of the (current) "Quick Tips" list in the HTML Writers Guild's monthly newsletter for December; it will be interesting to see if anyone takes notice.

Thanks for helping get the word out. 
Please be sure to include in any mention of the WAI QuickTips that they're still in "pilot" version, and that we appreciate feedback to wai-quicktips@w3.org during January 1999. 
After that we'll finalize.
