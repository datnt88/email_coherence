<s> The guidelines are split between meeting the different needs of users and the different abilities of their computer interfaces (UIs)  </s>
<s> people 1,2,4,7,12,13,14 machines 2,3,5,6,8,9,10,11  </s>
<s> That is my first impression, and at this stage of our understanding that is a mess.  </s>
<s> It is crucial that people can find the information they require.  </s>
<s> Just as the techniques have been separated, peoples needs and machine abilities must be separated.  </s>
<s> This will lead to some duplication, people must come first.  </s>
<s> B provide working examples It is important that the guidelines are a good example of what they intend Guideline 3 has two useful examples ie (using a table for layout or a header to change the font size) (e.g., constructing what looks like a table of data with an HTML PRE element) However they are textual rather than graphical..  </s>
<s> ^ are excellent tools for navigation once learnt.  </s>
<s> However, it is not clear how one navigates without a scroll bar, though javascript could provide screensize and v could provide next page, for those with javascript.  </s>
<s> Naturally this means there should be bad examples.  </s>
<s> Why not have an example of an irritating and meaningless flickering animation, with a disable button.  </s>
<s> There is frequent mention of the need to cater for cognitive disablity, but no link to the example guideline site.  </s>
<s> C mention cultural issues Where is the mention of cultural artifact.  </s>
<s> Most of our students live in flats, but house/home is still gingerbread style.  </s>
<s> Chopsticks/KFS... white weddings/funerals... Some of these concerns are cross-media.  </s>
<s> D encourage automated navigation (storytelling) gl 7.  </s>
<s> People with physical disabilities might not be able to move quickly or  </s>
<s> accurately enough to interact with moving objects.  </s>
<s> In fact people with physical+cognitive disabilities need more specific motivation.  </s>
<s> Moving objects are better able to provide a context.  </s>
<s> Scroll bars are a complete barrier to many.  </s>
<s> 7.1,7.2  </s>
<s> excellent Perhaps mention should be made of the need to provide programmatic movement through a site with a speed control.  </s>
<s> (also covers 7.3, 7.4, 7.5) gl 10. automated navigation is essential for some users see 7 E encourage use of appropriate images gl 1  </s>
<s> Provide equivalent alternatives to auditory and visual content.  </s>
<s> The porisma or corollary is that we MUST provide visual content that is equivalent, and this is very much more time consuming and difficult.  </s>
<s> Providing non-text equivalents (e.g., pictures, videos, and  </s>
<s> pre-recorded audio) of text is also beneficial to some users, especially nonreaders or people who have difficulty reading.  </s>
<s> This rather brief in comparison and does not discuss the inherent difficulties, it is certainly not rated a 'must'.  </s>
<s> 14.2  Supplement text with graphic or auditory presentations where they will facilitate comprehension of the page.  </s>
<s> why is this not priority 1?  </s>
<s> This is hardly encouraging, a picture tells a thousand words, in many cases pictures are a huge benefit.  </s>
<s> Non-readers, children...  </s>
<s> For the sighted vision is a large part of their native (pre-educational) understanding.  </s>
<s> People with cognitive disability make extensive use of this ability, in order to navigate the real world.  </s>
<s> Making use of this ability offers an opportunity to enhance education.  </s>
<s> This area is extremely complex and needs enormous expansion.  </s>
<s> F dilectics The Guidelines seem to occasionally and regularly miss out on dilectical arguments, that is if a group needs, or has a problem with one feature, it is almost certain that another group will need that feature disabled or actioned.  </s>
<s> (I use porisma in a similar sense to corollary, but where the solution is either irrational, or difficult to attain.) G priamble The following notes concern the priamble, they are not guideline notes but 'chapter' notes.  </s>
<s> 1.0  </s>
<s> They may have difficulty reading or comprehending text.  </s>
<s> Excellent, but having noted a disability, it is important to meet its needs.  </s>
<s> 2.1...  </s>
<s> Provide text (including text equivalents).  </s>
<s> Text can be rendered in ways  </s>
<s> that are available to almost all browsing devices and accessible to almost all users.  </s>
<s> This plainly does not help those with cognitive difficulties why is the opposite not mentioned ie providing pictures and sounds?  </s>
<s> 4.  </s>
<s> Each checkpoint has a priority level assigned by the Working Group  </s>
<s> based on the checkpoint's impact on accessibility.  </s>
<s> Says who, no but seriously this needs to be expanded.  </s>
<s> ie are we just identifying what is possible?  </s>
<s> JC:: "This plainly does not help those with cognitive difficulties why is the opposite not mentioned ie providing pictures and sounds?"  </s>
<s> WL: It is "mentioned" but since there is no *widely useful, acceptable* way to do it objectively there is nothing to do but hold these kinds of discussions and hope that something useful develops - as of now there is not universally understood graphical communication method - your KFS/chopsticks example is almost enough proof of that.  </s>
<s> JC:: "...are we just identifying what is possible?"  </s>
<s> WL: Absolutely.  </s>
<s> That may be unfortunate and deplorable but dealing in the *not possible*(yet?) may get grants but it won't feed the bulldogs.  </s>

<s> ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE  </s>
<s> At an early stage in the development of the guidelines it was decided that examples should be contained either in the techniques document, or in a sample web site that would be supposed to illustrate the techniques.  </s>
<s> The techniques document has been well prepared by the editors, but to my knowledge, no one has yet constructed a sample web site, and indeed it lies entirely outside this group's charter (this is probably another action item for EO).  </s>
<s> I am not currently privy to decisions as to the method of communication determined by w3c for their site.  </s>
<s> However if you have tried flash3 it has an excellent interactive tutorial.  </s>
<s> It is not impossible to provide text alternatives, however difficult.  </s>

<s> If that's not "impossible" then please show an *EXAMPLE* using some significant portion of the WAI site.  </s>
<s> We are not saying that we *shouldn't* do it, but that we "can't" and there is still no evidence to the contrary.  </s>
<s> Even just using text there is a running thread about misunderstandings in many checkpoints so that a "popularized" version beyond the QuickTips cards has been bruted about - to go another step and make the presentation simultaneously ideographic is, at least in practical terms, in fact *impossible*.  </s>
