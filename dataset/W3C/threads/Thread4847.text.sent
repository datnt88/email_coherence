A client wishes to discover resources which are denoted by URIs which match a particular regular expression and obtain descriptions of those resources. 
The client is aware of a source of knowledge from which such resources might be discovered. 
Following the DAWG recommendation, the client formulates a query which describes one or more example templates which reflect the desired characteristics and submits the query to the knowledge source. 
The knowledge source returns a set of zero or more resource descriptions, each description describing a resource which matched an example template.

While the content selection/site description communities may not need all of regular expressions, historically, they have made use of substrings ala $uri =~ m/http:\/\/playboy\.com\/pictures.*/

I'm sorry, but I don't understand the significance of this comment. 
Are you saying regular expression comparison is a bad thing because some folks might do bad things with it? 
Or are you saying it's a good thing because it allows folks to do things they already do and find useful? 
Patrick Patrick Stickler Nokia, Finland patrick.stickler@nokia.com the latter. 
It was supposed to be without value judgement, just an observation that there are folks who have a need for a subset of that expressivity.

Right. 
That was why I had included it in RDFQ in the first place, and why I offered a use case for it. 
We've also had "fringe" applications that need to break the best practice of URI opacity for very special purposes, so having a standardized way to do that is I think a good thing.
