<s> I prefer the theory that URIs mean exactly what their registered definition (as listed in the URI scheme registry) says they mean.  </s>
<s> In this theory: * URIs with unregistered schemes have no meaning.  </s>
<s> * URIs with schemes whose definition is unclear have unclear meaning.  </s>
<s> In this theory, the meaning of a 'mailto' URI is defined -- as good as it gets -- in RFC 2368.  </s>
<s> No additional meaning need apply, no further interpretation, projection, or findings.  </s>
<s> Similarly, the meaning of a 'http' URI is defined completely in RFC 2616.  </s>
<s> In this theory, the meaning of a URI does not depend on the URIs having an 'owner'.  </s>
<s> Requiring an 'owner' adds a great deal of theoretical complexity, especially when you also add the concept of 'say' -- that the 'owner' of the URI has to 'say' what it means, and that before the 'owner' 'says' the URI meaning, the URI (presumably) doesn't mean anything.  </s>
<s> In this theory, there doesn't have to be an owner, and no one has to say anything.  </s>
<s> In this theory, any other meaning or interpretation comes from the context.  </s>
<s> If some representation system wants to add some additional meaning to the URI, that additional meaning comes from the representation system, and not the URI itself.  </s>
<s> However, I would prefer updating the definition of the 'urn' scheme to make it clear that, for a URI that starts with "urn:", that the next thing in the URN syntax is a token identifying a 'namespace authority'.  </s>
<s> In this particular URI scheme, the  </s>
<s> 'namespace authority' does 'say'.  </s>
<s> The act of registering a URN in the namespace authority's registry is the act of 'say'ing what the URN means.  </s>
<s> So "urn:" is an exception -- because the definition of the scheme makes it clear who the 'owner' is and what it is they have to 'say'.  </s>
<s> What do you think of this theory?  </s>
<s> Larry  </s>
<s> Hmm... that seems a little like sticking our head in the sand, but maybe it's OK...  </s>
<s> Well, that makes this theory pretty uninteresting; the question we've been asked to discuss is how representation systems, particularly RDF, contribute to the meaning of URIs.  </s>
<s> I don't see any motivation for treating the bit after urn: as different from the bit after http:// , nor for treating that differently from the xyz bit in http://example/xyz/ and so on.  </s>
<s> Dan Connolly, W3C http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/  </s>
<s> Well, it relieves you from having to decide on any intrinsic semantics of the URI beyond the semantics already defined.  </s>
<s> If RDF is adding meaning by using URIs, then RDF can define that meaning, without having to discover and define any intrinsic meaning.  </s>
<s> RDF could say "any place in RDF where I want to talk about a concept, I can use a URI which should point to a web page which describes the concept".  </s>
<s> (This is the 'implicit tdb' theory).  </s>
<s> In this formulation, RDF assertions about W3C (as a consortium) could just use 'http://www.w3.org'.  </s>
<s> RDF assertions that wanted to talk about the web page at http://www.w3.org would have to use something other syntax.  </s>
<s> I think data:text/url,;http://www.w3.org is pretty ugly, but perhaps you could either come up with some other syntax, or else define rdf:about to be an exception, or some other formulation.  </s>
<s> However, I think that no theory of meaning of URIs in RDF should be allowed to avoid being clear about whether a reference to you or about your web page.  </s>
<s> Because the definition of 'http' is tied up with the HTTP protocol, while the definition of 'urn' describes the role of naming authorities.  </s>
<s> You treat them differently because their definitions are different.  </s>
<s> I'm not sure I can 'motivate' this in isolation.  </s>
<s> My main motivation is that you don't have to provide a stronger theory of meaning for URI than the one that is already defined.  </s>
<s> Any theory of meaning that relies on all URIs having an 'owner' and requiring the owner to 'say' what the URI means is weak.  </s>
<s> I'm trying to suggest an alternative.  </s>
