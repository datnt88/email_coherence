<s> Is there anyone out there who can tell me whether I have this right?  </s>
<s> As I understand it braille is usually abbreviated, and that there are different conventions for abbreviation depending on the language.  </s>
<s> In other words there is French braille and German braille.  </s>
<s> If this is the case, is there a poassibility that a sentence written in one language and contracted will appear to be logical in another language, but have a different meaning.  </s>
<s> And if so, will this occur more than once in any person's lifetime?  </s>
<s> Charles McCathieNevile  </s>
<s> Yes, Charles McCathieNevile's understanding is correct in that braille in many (though not all) languages is abbreviated, and that the abbreviation system varies quite naturally from language to language according to their common letter groupings, pronunciation patterns and such.  </s>
<s> Moreover, the appropriate and customary braille treatment is not only a function of language but also of context.  </s>
<s> For instance, French braille in France is a little different from French braille in Quebec, rather different again from French as done by the British for English-speaking French students, and as you might guess the Americans do it still a fourth way.  </s>
<s> The result is that ambiguity is certainly possible, though I would have to doubt that that fact commonly leads to a lot of confusion because the human brain is wonderfully capable of sorting out, from the semantic context, which of several theoretical possibilities actually makes sense in the current instance.  </s>
<s> You don't actually have to mix several languages to encounter this phenomenon.  </s>
<s> For example, in regular contracted English braille, the slash or stroke (/) has the same braille representation as the letter-group "st".  </s>
<s> The creates a theoretical ambiguity, and I have indeed heard stories where the ambiguity caused the reader trouble -- primarily when unfamiliar proper names, such as for products or companies, were involved.  </s>
<s> But in the overwhelming majority of instances, it's obvious that "and/or" makes sense and "andstor" doesn't.  </s>
<s> (But notice, special care would be needed to render that last sentence intelligibly in braille.) Present work in braille code design is in the direction of removing these kinds of ambiguities, mostly because they can cause problems in the context of technical notation.  </s>
<s> See the work by the Internation Council on English Braille towards a Unified Braille Code (UBC) for English at and note in particular that the UBC project is still debating the point as to whether language switches should have an explicit signal in braille.  </s>

<s> Joe Sullivan's reply is good, since he has made a career out of writing braille translation software.  </s>
<s> There is some probability of confusability for short sentences, but people can figure out what is going on.  </s>
<s> Also, I wouldn't expect much contracted braille to be encoded as HTML.  </s>
<s> Rather, when people talk about Braille presentation, my understanding is that they are dealing with uncontracted, otherwise printable, text in the language of interest, with an eye toward contracting and rendering it "on the fly", or making hard copy from downloaded HTML/CSS files.  </s>
<s> In the WebBraille project here at NLS, we provide contracted braille material from a website, but it is not HTML.  </s>
<s> Rather, it is ready for embossing on braille devices at 25 lines per page, 38 to 40 characters per line.  </s>

<s> In addition to the ICEB, there is BANA (Braille Authority of N America) which recently approved signs and rules for brailling electronic addresses (e-mail &amp; URLs) and filenames in nontechnical contexts.  </s>
<s> This group governs brailling music, chemistry, mathematics, etc. -- all different "languages".  </s>
<s> BANA's website is: annual meeting in Boston Nov. 10.  </s>
<s> In the U.S., the National Library Service (part of the Library of Congress) is one key contact -- among much else, it certifies Nemeth (scientific braille), music and literary ("standard") braille transcribers.  </s>
<s> Are ICEB, BANA, etc. invovled with or aware of this WAI group?  </s>
<s> Virginia Rodes Maryland Library for the Blind  </s>
<s> (I probably should have mentioned that BANA actually started the UBC project, and remains actively involved in it through ICEB.) Yes, both ICEB and BANA are aware of WAI, and obviously share its goal of promoting accessibility.  </s>
<s> The UBC project is grounded in part on the recognition that automatic rendering in braille from the Web and other electronic sources is already important and growing more so all the time, and so in that sense it may be regarded as a symbiotic effort.  </s>
<s> Likewise, work with existing braille codes is increasingly along the same lines (even though more incremental in scope), because UBC itself is still a research project in the development and evaluation stages.  </s>
