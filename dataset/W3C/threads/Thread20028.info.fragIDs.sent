Dear Sir, Will you please help me getting the detail architechture of both the Amaya and Thot? 
Yes I have your supplied one with the source archieve but to follow your huge codes, I failed to track all. 
Now Please if you have any Top Level Modular Architecture/ Diagram, Document level Architecture/Diagram, and some other documentation regarding the design and coding of Amaya, I would be very glad. 
Even if you have any documentation which describes which module is doing what please send me asap. 
I'm a Software Engineer and have completed my M.Sc. in computer science. 
I'm using Amaya for a long days in my Redhat linux PC. I've compiled my own binary for amaya. 
But now I want to contribute Amaya and want to customize my Amaya. 
So please help me getting information. 
My mail address : zulker@bdonline.com or zulker9@yahoo.com 
Thanking you, Zulker 94/B North Jatrabari, Dhaka-1204 Bangladesh 
In the Amaya CVS repository, there used to be the files Amaya/doc/amaya/Overview.html Amaya/doc/amaya/AmayaArchi.html 
Since these files contained valueable information about Amaya's architecture, I hope that they are put back soon. 
Fortunately, if you do use CVS, you don't have to wait until they are replaced. 
To get copies of these files at the time they were deleted, you can use the following commands (under UNIX): $ cd Amaya/doc/amaya $ cvs update -p -r 1.27 Overview.html  
OverviewCopy.html $ cvs update -p -r 1.6 AmayaArchi.html  AmayaArchiCopy.html 
Or I could just send you a copy of the files.

Mail - Free email you can access from anywhere! 
These two pages are available on the Web: I guess it's not necessary to duplicate it on the CVS base. 
Irene. 
The page http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/Overview.html points to a set of useful pages. 
I suggest also you to subscribe to www-amaya-dev and send us messages when you need more information on a specific point. 
If you need information about Thot you can find it at Irene.
