<s> Dear Sir, Will you please help me getting the detail architechture of both the Amaya and Thot?  </s>
<s> Yes I have your supplied one with the source archieve but to follow your huge codes, I failed to track all.  </s>
<s> Now Please if you have any Top Level Modular Architecture/ Diagram, Document level Architecture/Diagram, and some other documentation regarding the design and coding of Amaya, I would be very glad.  </s>
<s> Even if you have any documentation which describes which module is doing what please send me asap.  </s>
<s> I'm a Software Engineer and have completed my M.Sc. in computer science.  </s>
<s> I'm using Amaya for a long days in my Redhat linux PC. I've compiled my own binary for amaya.  </s>
<s> But now I want to contribute Amaya and want to customize my Amaya.  </s>
<s> So please help me getting information.  </s>
<s> My mail address : zulker@bdonline.com or zulker9@yahoo.com  </s>
<s> Thanking you, Zulker 94/B North Jatrabari, Dhaka-1204 Bangladesh  </s>
<s> In the Amaya CVS repository, there used to be the files Amaya/doc/amaya/Overview.html Amaya/doc/amaya/AmayaArchi.html  </s>
<s> Since these files contained valueable information about Amaya's architecture, I hope that they are put back soon.  </s>
<s> Fortunately, if you do use CVS, you don't have to wait until they are replaced.  </s>
<s> To get copies of these files at the time they were deleted, you can use the following commands (under UNIX): $ cd Amaya/doc/amaya $ cvs update -p -r 1.27 Overview.html   </s>
<s> OverviewCopy.html $ cvs update -p -r 1.6 AmayaArchi.html  AmayaArchiCopy.html  </s>
<s> Or I could just send you a copy of the files.  </s>
<s> Do You Yahoo!? Get Yahoo!  </s>
<s> Mail - Free email you can access from anywhere!  </s>
<s> These two pages are available on the Web: I guess it's not necessary to duplicate it on the CVS base.  </s>
<s> Irene.  </s>
<s> The page http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/Overview.html points to a set of useful pages.  </s>
<s> I suggest also you to subscribe to www-amaya-dev and send us messages when you need more information on a specific point.  </s>
<s> If you need information about Thot you can find it at Irene.  </s>
