<s> Following RFC 2732 &amp; integrating with HTTP 1.1:  </s>
<s> The problem I have is in the Host field in the HTTP 1.1 header It says: Host hostname or Host hostname:port If hostname is an IPv6 literal address, then there is an ambiguity due the colon example: Host 3ffe::1:8080 Does this mean hostname is 3ffe::1 and port 8080 or hostname 3ffe::1:8080 and default port 80 ?  </s>
<s> The only way to remove the ambiguity is to make the use of [ ] around the IPv6 literal address madatory.  </s>
<s> Such as: Host [3ffe::1]:8080 or Host [3ffe::1:8080] We ran into this problem at Connectathon 2000.  </s>
<s> What useful purpose does sending an IP (v anything) address in a Host header field perform?  </s>

<s> Being able to make a HTTP/1.1 request at all using an IP address... since you need a Host: header of some sort.  </s>
<s> And it is definitely useful or even necessary to allow requests using an IP address.  </s>
<s> But that is another debate that comes up over and over in general, especially with IPv6...  </s>
<s> This was the solution recommended at IETF-47.  </s>
<s> Of course, you also have the problem with userland utilities that accept host:port designations as well.  </s>

<s> That's not what I meant.  </s>
<s> Is this just a question about what to put in the field value, or is there some functionality/semantics desired behind the server interpreting this value (which we have discussed in the past as being a bad thing).  </s>
<s> The syntax for host is defined by reference to RFC 2396, which in turn is updated by the IPv6-within-URI specification (RFC 2732), so the answer for HTTP syntax has already been defined.  </s>
