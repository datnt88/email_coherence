Following RFC 2732 &amp; integrating with HTTP 1.1: 
The problem I have is in the Host field in the HTTP 1.1 header It says: Host hostname or Host hostname:port If hostname is an IPv6 literal address, then there is an ambiguity due the colon example: Host 3ffe::1:8080 Does this mean hostname is 3ffe::1 and port 8080 or hostname 3ffe::1:8080 and default port 80 ? 
The only way to remove the ambiguity is to make the use of [ ] around the IPv6 literal address madatory. 
Such as: Host [3ffe::1]:8080 or Host [3ffe::1:8080] We ran into this problem at Connectathon 2000. 
What useful purpose does sending an IP (v anything) address in a Host header field perform?

Being able to make a HTTP/1.1 request at all using an IP address... since you need a Host: header of some sort. 
And it is definitely useful or even necessary to allow requests using an IP address. 
But that is another debate that comes up over and over in general, especially with IPv6... 
This was the solution recommended at IETF-47. 
Of course, you also have the problem with userland utilities that accept host:port designations as well.

That's not what I meant. 
Is this just a question about what to put in the field value, or is there some functionality/semantics desired behind the server interpreting this value (which we have discussed in the past as being a bad thing). 
The syntax for host is defined by reference to RFC 2396, which in turn is updated by the IPv6-within-URI specification (RFC 2732), so the answer for HTTP syntax has already been defined.
