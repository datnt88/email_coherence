<s> Hi guys, man I know this has been covered a few times here... But now I'm in a jam...  </s>
<s> I normally get very dirty word files to convert into web form... Now the process I use is as follows: -Receive the word file -Save word file as webpage (html filtered) -I load up http://www.textism.com/resources/cleanwordhtml/  </s>
<s> (this site has been a god send) and I clean my file of word's horrid xml or smart tags, whatever is slaps in there... -I then copy and paste this file into homesite and run tidy on it.  </s>
<s> This is a serious time saver, and up to about a week ago worked flawlessly... Now it would seem, I'm loosing ' before my characters, such as 'Jay's wild design', is coming out as 'Jays wild design' And is creating havoc!  </s>
<s> Now it would seem I can't trust my system to make accurate web pages from the doc files.  </s>
<s> I noticed it's also truncating paragraphs with a  on the end...  </s>
<s> So I'd get 'This is a sentence in a websi ' as apposed to the whole paragraph of 'This is a sentence in a website about wildness' So after blabbering on about how I do my stuff here, my question is, is there another way to get wordXP files converted to web pages accurately and quickly?  </s>
<s> What is everyone else using?  </s>
<s> For me to do these pages by hand, I'd never have anough time... Preserving formating like bolds and bullets and links is a serious time saver.  </s>
<s> Any help appreciated guys...  </s>
<s> Hi Jason, When did you update Tidy so that this broke?  </s>
<s> Unless you update it, HomeSite uses 04Aug2000 version of Tidy.  </s>
<s> There have been several bug fixes and enhancements to the word-2000 processing since that time.  </s>
<s> You can update HomeSite by simple copying a newer version of tidy.exe for Windows into the HomeSite directory.  </s>
<s> Be sure to back up the original file first.  </s>
<s> If you didn't update Tidy, did the textism website change?  </s>
<s> Take it easy, Charlie  </s>
<s> Hey Charles...  </s>
<s> When did you update Tidy so that this broke?  </s>
<s> --yeah I'm running: meta content="HTML Tidy for Windows (vers 1st February 2003), see the end of the meta tag?  </s>
<s> Why not at the front?  </s>
<s> If you didn't update Tidy, did the textism website change?  </s>
<s> --that could very well be, I did send a note, we'll see what happens...  </s>
