Here, as promised, is a *draft* of the WS Choreography specification that expands on the sample XML for a Choreography definition that I provided in April [1]. 
It includes a number of additional features that were not illustrated by the earlier example but is essentially the same. 
The zip file at [2] contains: 1. 
The draft WS Choreography spec as a PDF 2. The Choreography XML Schema 3. Sample XML choreography definitions. 
Also please note that the copyright statement in the spec reserves Commerce One's rights to the specification. 
However, if the WS Choreography group sees fit to want to take this specification further, then Commerce One will donate their IP in the spec to the W3C.

I'm afraid it is not sufficient to say that if the group wants the spec then y'all will submit the IP since this means that the group could potentially not want the spec and having read it I could be contaminated with your IP. So I must ask that you officially submit the spec for consideration by the WG under W3C's IP guidelines. 
That way there will be no IP issues.

I need to do a more detailed check, but I don't think Commerce One has an patents in this area, so really we are talking about copyright. 
Also the spec is not complete, and there are some issues and gaps in it, although I think there are a lot of good ideas big grin . 
Finally, as it might help to read the licence in the spec without actually downloading it, I attach it below. 
Is this enough so that you can read it Yaron? 
Finally, can anyone point me towards the procedure/process for making a submission.

Commerce One changes our IP statement on the WS Chor from "undeclared" - which coincindentally is the same as BEA's - to one of "non-declared (RF)", i.e. if there are any patents which Commerce One owns in the ideas in the spec (which I don't beleive there are) then they would be made available on RF terms - I don't have the precise legalese but I will get it. 
Also please note that my original email stated an intention, which still stands, that IF the spec was adopted we would give the relevant IP to the W3C. 
This means, more specifically, that we would give the copyright to the W3C (since that is the only real IP we have) and also make available on RF terms any "essential claims" in patents that are required to implement the spec that might exist - which is what you really need to do. 
However, as I don't believe Commerce One has any patents (I'm double checking) you seem to be demanding, before you read the spec, that we give away IP to the W3C that we can't give because it doesn't exist. 
This does not make sense. 
Now let's look at this from a Commerce One perspective. 
If I adopt your reasoning, it would suggest that Commerce One (or anyone else for that matter) should not read any BEA specs for the same reasons as you state - we would run a risk of "polluting" our ideas with BEA IP without knowing what the consequences are. 
Removing this risk would require that BEA make an immediate declaration that any IP you have that could affect the development of the choreography spec be made available on RF terms. 
Is BEA prepared to do this? 
If you don't does it mean I shouldn't read any of your emails as I might be polluting my thinking with BEA's ideas which could mean that BEA will charge me royalties later? 
This is getting really crazy !!!!! Regards David Unfortunately the license isn't sufficient as it only covers the text itself and not the ideas contained therein.

I think this is a consequence of the fact that we were amongst the first folks to join and the process wasn't quite functional yet. 
In any case, I'm now a happy camper. 
I will read your spec as soon as I dig my way out of the mail backlog for WS-Chor. 
Yaron Yaron How about this as an idea ... Commerce One changes our IP statement on the WS Chor from "undeclared" - which coincindentally is the same as BEA's - to one of "non-declared (RF)", i.e. if there are any patents which Commerce One owns in the ideas in the spec (which I don't beleive there are) then they would be made available on RF terms - I don't have the precise legalese but I will get it.
