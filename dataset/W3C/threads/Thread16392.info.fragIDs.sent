<s> This paper sets out an ambitious tableaux.  </s>
<s> It is concerned with SLD or fairly serious cognitive problems.  </s>
<s> We need to formalise this somehow within the guidelines and also ensure that the WAI homepage meets the need of a variety of users not only the techies.  </s>
<s> Otherwise we fail.  </s>
<s> The quotes below are out of context however, the meaning is as intended.  </s>
<s> There are three quotes with comments.  </s>

<s> Guidelines and Frameworks The EITAAC report (1999) is notable for two things.  </s>
<s> First, it contains some technology-specific standards and implementation details.  </s>
<s> Second, it sets an accessibility goal.  </s>
<s> A person with a disability should be able to "perform the same tasks, access the same information, with the same approximate ease and in the same approximate time and at the same cost" as someone without a disability (?4.3.1).  </s>
<s> This implies that designers should especially pursue solutions that help to close the gap in task performance between those with(cognitive) disabilities and those without.  </s>
<s> Are we sure that we really are meeting this need, with regard to advice on publishing a web page?  </s>
<s> Due diligence is a popular american phrase, and its meaning probably not right for this context however, given that there is a continuum of CD is the WAI homepage, and its linked pages designed to meet a range of ability?  </s>
<s> 2. GUIDELINES &amp; STRATEGIES 2.1.  </s>
<s> REDUNDANT, USER-CONTROLLED MODALITY OF INFORMATION Use visual examples (diagrams, icons, drawings)in addition to text descriptions.  </s>
<s> Please note that this is the first item on the list.  </s>
<s> 4. SPECIFIC COGNITIVE DISABILITIES Designers need to know the population they are designing for, and who to recruit to help test or evaluate the result.  </s>
<s> This assertion is one that I have tried to bring to members attention.  </s>
<s> The context given should enable everyone to get some idea of the size of this problem.  </s>
<s> This paper is a valuable collection of knowledge.  </s>
<s> However it remains very academic, and does not attempt to meet the needs it identifies.  </s>
<s> There is no reason why an abstract should not.  </s>

<s> JC:: "We need to formalise this somehow within the guidelines and also ensure that the WAI homepage meets the need of a variety of users not only the techies."  </s>
<s> WL: I believe our paraphrase is that rather than "the" homepage being a certain "way" the semantic content of all of the Web must be posted in such a form that it may "meet the need..." of *everyone*.  </s>
<s> If the content, structure, and presentation are maintained (this requires the specific demands the Web standards make on the authoring tool and the latter's teasing out these three factors from the author during site creation), everyone will be connectable with everything.  </s>
<s> Making the presentation of the content, when it is necessary that it be different from the authors' picturalizations/audiolizations/realisations is much like any form of translation - simple but not easy.  </s>
<s> The translator must be able to understand what the author *means* not just what she *says* or how she says it.  </s>
<s> To this end all the elements of discourse ("'tain't whacha do, it's the way howja do it") must be available in the forms we seek to have present in the marked up document.  </s>
<s> As WCAG and ATAG working groups we must not move from the doughnut of content/structure/presentation to the hole of "Final Object".  </s>
<s> Of course certain conventions of illustration and identification and elucidation are necessary for different users but *what is it that must be illustrated, identified or elucidated*? is the question the Authoring Tool must put to the author.  </s>
<s> *what do you mean by (: ) (oh, it's Sir Walter Raleigh sideways) *does that there .gif mean "rose" or "spring"?  </s>
<s> *is that a link to "further resources" or foobar.txt?  </s>
<s> The job of explaining what "cuantos anos tienes" means to a Mexican child requires certain markups that are naggingly demanded by an adequate authoring tool, but the published marked-up site must be presented to different users in a plentitude of guises not just some "final form" pictogram of the (too often retinally conceited) author's insistence on how it "looks" rather than what it's supposed to say.  </s>
<s> When we make up our examples showing how the WAI homepage (or whatever) can be presented for different audiences the emphasis is going to be on how we can ferret out what to present - the *how* is for specialists in Jonathan's position.  </s>
<s> Only a deafspeak mediator can translate all those obscure audiophones into proper ASL, only a... Content, structure, presentation.  </s>
<s> In this case "separate but equal" is not a hated pejorative but a necessity.  </s>
<s> Love.  </s>
<s> ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE  </s>
