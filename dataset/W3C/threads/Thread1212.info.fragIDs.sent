Published specification(s): The standard below is in Japanese but draft-ohta-jcs-jis-x-0213-00.txt, which is intended to be an Informational RFC, gives some explanation 
on the charsets in English. 
[JISX0213] Japanese Industrial Standards Committee, "7-bit and 8-bit double byte coded extended Kanji sets for information interchange", JIS X 0213:2000, Japanese Standards Association, (To be published in January 2000, draft accessible through http://jcs.aa.tufs.ac.jp/).

In 3.5 of RFC 2278, there are usage and implementation requirements. 
A charset should therefore be registered ONLY if it adds significant functionality that is valuable to a large community, OR if it documents existing practice in a large community. 
Note that charsets registered for the second reason should be explicitly marked as being of limited or specialized use and should only be used in Internet messages with prior bilateral agreement. 
I think that proposed charsets should be explicitly marked as legacy 
(they are new, but extensions of legacy encodings).

Murata san; 
A charset should therefore be registered ONLY if it adds significant functionality that is valuable to a large community, OR 
You seems to be saying that the entire IT community of Japan is not so large or JIS is not valuable to the community. 
Maybe. 
:-) But, 
FYI, ISO-2022-JP is already included in JIS X 0208:1997.

It's good to see that this has found it's way to this list. 
Some comments: - There is some confusion about MIME. 
All six proposed encodings are listed as 'MIME charsets', but it says that only two of them are suitable for use in MIME. 
Also, while I don't know all the details of the proposed encodings, the base encodings EUC-JP and Shift_JIS are definitely suitable for use with MIME, and it would surprise me if the new, related encodings were not. 
- I agree with MURATA Makoto that some comment on how/when the encodings should be used (or not) are appropriate. 
However, simply labeling them as legacy encodings may be highly confusing. 
On the other hand, saying something like 'ISO-2022-JP-3 is the encoding for Japanese text' is definitely also confusing. 
- The draft does not give very many details about the actual encodings. 
The draft should be expanded to contain enough details so that implementers not able to understand Japanese can implement the encodings. 
- It may be very helpful for a wide audience to include some other details about JIS X 0213 in the draft. 
As I haven't see the final version of JIS X 0213, I cannot give further details at the moment. 
- As JIS X 0213 is not yet published, I think the registration should wait until that has happened, and people have had a chance to have a look at it. 
Of course, that doesn't preclude to continue to prepare the registration as much as possible.

Martin; This is a formal answer from the JCS committee. 
First of all, the Internet Draft is intended to be published as an Informational, NOT Standard Track, RFC containing opinions of JCS, not IETF. 
Your comments on the content of the Internet Draft should better be sent to Authors or JCS mailing list, not IETF. 
Answers to your comments on procedures or formalities follows. 
A requirement for the registration is "publish". 
There is no requirement that the publication must be in English. 
However, we are kind enough to prepare an RFC-to-be Internet Draft in English. 
All the information is contained in publicly available draft in the home page of JCS referenced in the Internet Draft. 
We are at the final stage of the standardization that there is no change between the published draft in our home page and the paper publication except for bug fixes. 
The draft is already published through WWW, as you know and as is written in our Internet Draft. 
The publication is to solicite public comments and is detailed one. 
You can argue that RFC publication by FTP or WWW is not publication. 
However, we should thank you and other people sending us comments on the detailed draft by having a chance to have a look at it. 
Masataka Ohta 
Well, I already sent them to you. 
I have included the two other authors of the internet-draft. 
I hope this helps. 
I am copying the ietf-charsets list according to Section 4.1 of rfc2278.html. 
I apreciate your kindness. 
There is indeed no requirement, not even for an informational RFC. 
However, as you are planning to publish an informational RFC, I thought it would be a good idea to give some more details. 
I personally don't care, because I can read Japanese, but I think a lot of people would apreciate it, and it would greatly help the adoption and uniform implementation of the new standard and the new 'charset's. 
This would be in the tradition of RFC 1468 and RFC 1554 and others. 
While the first public review page at of pointers, on the final public review page to submissions to the ISO registry and to ISO/Unicode. 
Can you give me a pointer to the actual draft? 
And can you update the pointer in the internet-draft to make things easier to find? 
I wouldn't dream to do so. 
W3C only publishes via the WWW, so I have no problem with a publication on the WWW, as far as I can find it. 
Regards, Martin.

As far as I know, even in Japanese, JIS X 0213 has not been published yet. 
I would like to have a look at it very much. 
Today, I read "Comments on JCS Proposal" from UTC. Ohta-san, would you be kind enough to expand the I-D and introduce further information about the current situation? 
Makoto Fuji Xerox Information Systems E-mail: murata.makoto@fujixerox.co.jp 
Murata san; 
Who said JIS X 0213 published? 
I don't know what UTC means but I'm sure that it has nothing to do with the publication of JIS X 0213. 
The I-D contains information on the current situation. 
They should learn to use plain text.
