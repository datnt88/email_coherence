Hello, These are minor editorial comments for your OWL Candidate Recommendation [1,2,3,4,5,6], I hope in time for your deadline. 
Overview [1] s/publically/publicly/ s/members of this working group/participants in this Working Group/ s/Grahm/Graham/ s/emposed/imposed/ s/indivual/individual/ s/simililarly/similarly/ For the References section, there is an example here: Guide [2] s/intepreted/interpreted/ s/likeliehood/likelihood/ s/modificatons/modifications/ s/subClsssOf/subClassOf/ s/Workng/Working/ s/Ontolgoy/Ontology/ s/URI's/URIs/ s/members of this group working group/participants in this Working Group/ For the References section, there is an example citation here: Links outside, like rdf:ID need a reference and section. 
There is an example here: Section 7.2 most likely needs to be rewritten to point only to IANA reserved sites per RFC 2606 (example.org, 
example.com 
and example.net 
or if you need evocative names, e.g. wine-portal.example.com). 
The examples and links here could be omitted. 
If they can't be omitted and you can assure persistence then they can be references. 
If I can be of assistance please let me know and I will help rewrite this. 
I am sorry to have to say this at CR. A number of sites exist today that call themselves wine portals. 
Google for example, provides 152,000 matches for the query "wine portal". 
One of the top matches, a site called "Wine-Portal.com", 
provides access to a number of sites. 
Many sites claiming to be wine portals are mostly informational sites. 
For example, wine-portal.com's first featured site, called 'cork cuisine' (www.corkcuisine.com/), 
provides information about matching wines and foods, wines as gifts, etc. 
Another site billed as "the Internet Wine Portal" ( www.cyberbacchus.com/) provides a nice organization of a substantial amount of wine information on numerous topics. 
Similarly, links like these should be omitted or made into citations. 
wine agent listing Marietta OWL Reference [3] is beautifully done!

I made the word changes you suggested to the overview document that were not already in the editors draft. 
I did not make the "members" to "participants" change since there are some people who are members of the working group although I have never seen them participate. 
(I did made the working group to Working Group change.) 
I will ask internally for one consistent phrasing for the last paragraph within all of the working group documents. 
The Overview document update is in its usual editors draft location - Concerning the paragraph in the Guide section you mention below, I can rewrite it but I had never heard of "IANA reserved sites per RFC 2606" before. 
I do need some examples in that section and could provide more description and drop the URLs for which I can not control persistance if that is preferable. 
Are you suggesting taking the functional url example - non functional url you mention wine-portal.example.com 
that has the appropriate naming? 
This means that people could not click through to the site and would just mean I need to do a bit more description in the example. 
thank you, Deborah "Participant" is the W3C Process Document term used instead of "member" to differentiate from "W3C Members." 
I ought to have mentioned that. 
Yes, that's exactly right. 
Thanks very much. 
(The reasons for this request are one non-RFC domain in another spec causing harm when it changed hands, and a domain that is something of a surprise, that was used in the CSS1 Recommendation.) If can help let me know. 
Best wishes, Susan Lesch http://www.w3.org/People/Lesch/ World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) http://www.w3.org/ 
I also s/working drafts/Working Drafts/ all these are done, see editors draft dated 22nd September. 
Test Cases [5] s/web/Web/ s/web-site/Web site/ s/working group/Working Group/ s/favourable/favorable/ s/members of this group working group/participants in this Working Group/ A question, I saw you commented on the compound document structure of OWL Semantics &amp; Abstract Syntax. 
[S&amp;AS] Is the one I've used OK for OWL Test Cases. 
For many earlier drafts , not having a compound document was perceived as a problem. 
The current solution involves generating the three single document versions M.html L.html and XXL.html and then xslt-ing the (informative) XXL.html version with the script below to make the normative compound document. 
However, I didn't find any guidance as to W3C policy for such things, and basically just copied S&amp;AS and some other TR but I forget which. 
I would be happy to entertain changes to the xslt, less happy with suggestions that could not easily be addressed that way. 
Jeremy Susan, Thanks for the careful read. 
Re your comments on the Guide. 
I have corrected all the typos, members- participants, and am nearly done with the references. 
I am using the citation form suggested. 
While it turns out to be a little verbose, I agree with the rationale. 
The references particularly needed fixing and I now need to run through the various verifiers before publishing to the web site. 
The following is pending, per Deborah McGuinness' earlier email.
