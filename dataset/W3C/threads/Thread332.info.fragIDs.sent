Hi, to get a compliant XML document, you need to specify "-asxml" and "-numeric".

I am pretty new in the xml scope. 
I have made a very simple experiment: 1) Took an HTML page form MSDN help 2 )clicked: "view source" got the source into a notepad document. 
3) sent this HTML to tidy - no changes in the default config parameters. 
4) Got a "tidy converted" page which should be compliance to the XML standard. 
(the "tidy" tag was into the page - which means that dity has been working on it , no significant errors in the errors.txt ) 5) run a very simple VB program which loads an HTMLpage into a DOM object 6) here is the most significant code: Dim xmlDoc As New MSXML.DOMDocument 
xmlDoc.Load 
("c:\tidy\msdn_help.html) 7) the MSXML parser failed while loading this page. 
Some of the errors were reasonable and easy to fix but the other (see below) caused me a real problem. 
9) Here are the main errors: Line like this link type="text/css" disabled rel="stylesheet" href= "stylesheets/msdn_ie3.css" 
caused the error: Missing equals sign between attribute and attribute value Every line like this: meta name= "( any string. 
e.g)" caused the error: End tag (something. 
e.g. ) does not match the start tag 'meta' Every line like this: li Click the b Options /b button. 
br br /li caused the error: End tag 'li' does not match the start tag 'br' Every line like this : the Msjaval.dll as the control&amp;resqu server, with the name and path... caused the error: reference to undefined resqu I also got errors like this : A string literal was expected, but no opening quote character was found few tags were missing in the end of the file, (somewhere there was a tag without /tag ...) 8) After fixing all the errors the page was successfully loaded to the parser. 
My question is: is tidy and MSXML are compliance to the same standard (XML 1.0 ) ? 
Is this should be possible to load an HTML page after working with tidy on it? 
Did I something wrong ? 
Any Idea will help me a lot. 
Thanks in advance Eli.

Sounds like the errors found are proper. 
For instance: link type="text/css" disabled rel="stylesheet" href= "stylesheets/msdn_ie3.css" 
caused the error: Missing equals sign between attribute and attribute value You have to create XHTML legal syntax. 
In this case, adding disabled="disabled" is necessary. 
Most of the others come from not ending META tags with / (blank space, forward slash, angle.
