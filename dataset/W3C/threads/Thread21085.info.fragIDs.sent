<s> Hello List, My fansite http://www.hoehnermusikfan.net/index.xhtml with many images looked nice in previous versions, but it is a complete mess in Amaya 8.0 I downloaded yesterday, though I did not change anything.  </s>
<s> XHTML 1.1 and CSS validate.  </s>
<s> It is served it as application/xhtml+xml and looks nice in Opera 7.0 and Mozilla 1.3, but now in this new Amaya release it is really terrible.  </s>
<s> I think a very terrible bug must exist in this version, especcially in floating images.  </s>
<s> Greetings Ineke van der Maat  </s>
<s> Hallo John Thanks for your mail with attachment.  </s>
<s> Your are right, in previous releases the images did not float left and right.  </s>
<s> But the site was shown nice with text below the not floated images.  </s>
<s> I thought that you know that msie 6.0 also can not show sites served as application/xhtml+xml.  </s>
<s> Therefore you can see the same site served as text/html.  </s>
<s> Look http://www.hoehnermusikfan.net.  </s>
<s> Even this is a mess in Amaya 8.0.  </s>
<s> with the floating images.  </s>
<s> But also previous Amaya versions showed the real html-version as a mix between the stylesheet for Netscape 4.7/WebtV and other browsers, due probably to the javascript in the html-version that sends the stylesheet  </s>
<s> to browsers.  </s>
<s> Amaya is the only browser I know that shows this fansite differently when it is served as text/html or as application/xhtml+xml.  </s>
<s> Besites line 85 is empty in the xhtml version, in one of the 2 css-files for the homepage I can find: .HeadNavbar  </s>
<s> { and in the other CSS-file on that line 85 : color: #c00;.  </s>
<s> I don't see any error.You perhaps?  </s>
<s> Greetings Ineke  </s>

<s> I'll have a look at the floatting boxes problem as soon as possible.  </s>
<s> Thanks for the report Irene.  </s>

<s> One difference should be the default encoding: UTF-8 for xml and ISO-8859-1 for html.  </s>
<s> A second difference is a control of wellformness.  </s>
