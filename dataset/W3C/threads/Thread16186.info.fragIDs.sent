<s> To those who are not familiar with the slang "Air Hug", here is an example.  </s>
<s> If you appreciate what someone has done and this act warrants a hug but are separated by distance (short, long, or over the internet) and cannot render the hug.  </s>
<s> You can extend your arms and pretend to hug and say "Air Hug" As I have not seen an ascii representation for an "Air Hug", I propose \../  and for a "GREAT BIG AIR HUG"  \\..//  </s>
<s> Obviously I am in a good mood!  </s>
<s> Rob  </s>
<s> The idea of an 'Air Hug' may be great but ..those slashes and dots are not very helpful for those of us who use screen readers.  </s>
<s> I would not like to see their use expanded.  </s>

<s> In terms of proposing ASCII representations for things in online  </s>
<s> communication, without regard to whether or not the 'Air Hug' suggestion is something that will or will not catch on, the following things occurred to me:  </s>
<s> Things divide into two categories here - the small scale, 'inline' emoticon type ASCII stuff, like smileys, and the large scale graphical extravaganzas of full-blown multi-line ASCII artwork.  </s>
<s> Neither one is intrinsically accessible, and in terms of the second, I believe that the fact that there are as many accessiblity problems as there are with other kinds of graphics will not stop anyone from using it.  </s>
<s> ASCII art is out there and will not die - it is a shame that it is in the category of artwork that cannot necessarily be appreciated by all, but perhaps those who cannot see it will come to regard it in the same way that I personally regard opera - I ignore it and save time.  </s>
<s> The sensible compromise seems to me to suggest that ASCII art should only be used in sites and documents that either relate to ASCII art itself or that have some other kind of intrinsic accessibility issue.  </s>
<s> A special kind of PRE tag would be good, with an ALT of some sort, and then we could use ASCII art, and would have some way of making it accessible and dealing with the large online legacy of currently inaccessible-due-to-ascii-artwork documents.  </s>
<s> Meanwhile, the inline emoticons and smileys are so widely distributed online as to have attained, as far as I can tell, the equivalent of language status, in a sense, so it isn't a question of telling people to stop using them, because they wont.  </s>
<s> Perhaps a solution might be to get screen readers to have a list of the most commonly used ones and translate them accordingly.  </s>
<s> Such a list could be managed centrally by the WAI, in the form of a simple text file, with each line containing the emoticon and the description seperated by tabs (or something), which screenreaders could update the latest version of on a regular basis and use to translate every :), :-) X| and ~;) they come across.  </s>
<s> and it should be two way - with an 'insert' smiley option - after all, why shouldn't users of screenreaders be able to use 'winking smiley' or whatever as well as anyone.  </s>
<s> Maintaining this file would be a reasonable amount of work, I imagine, especially as there may not be universal agreement on the best way to translate each of the major emoticons into each language required, but it seems to me worthwhile in the sense that I feel strongly that solutions to accessibility issues ought to try to bring everyone in to what is already there, not to reduce what is already there to what everyone can already see, as well as making sure that all the new stuff is universally accessible too.  </s>
<s> I would be happy to help sort this out to the extent that I am able, though I am not an expert on either emoticons or screenreaders - certainly there already exist many listings of 'yer basic online emoticons' - and I thought I'd seen one on the w3c site itself once (though I can't find it right now) - surely it's just a question of finding a list to build a canonical central list from, making sure the suggestion gets directed at screenreader writers and sorting it out with next versions of screenreader software.  </s>

<s> ASCII art is inaccessible.  </s>
<s> I propose AIR HUG and GREAT BIG AIR HUG.  </s>
<s> (The thing on the line above is an inaccessible smiley.) --Kynn  </s>
<s> "ASCII art is inaccessible.  </s>
<s> I propose AIR HUG and GREAT BIG AIR HUG." I second the motion.  </s>
<s> But I suggest "A hug from me."  </s>
<s> Or "Hugs."  </s>
<s> First, why do we need to standardize an expression of emotion?  </s>
<s> If it is real, express it in your own words.  </s>
<s> Perhaps this is why I'm so appalled by emoticons and consider them so fake.  </s>
<s> They are akin to McDonald's hamburgers or Hallmark cards.  </s>
<s> Convenient, but of little real value.  </s>
<s> Second, I think the whole emoticon issue brings up questions about communication in the wired age.  </s>
<s> We become more an more isolated in our own feelings, less and less connected to others on an emotional level.  </s>
<s> In a way, the emoticon is the "smiley face" on the flip side of the email rage coin.  </s>
<s> In the same manner that we often feel freer to trash others by email, the emoticon acts as a sort of intimacy cop-out, in which a symbol is used to distance us from any real intimacy, from saying what we feel in an honest and open manner with respect for others.  </s>
<s> Personally, I think that those who find emoticons inaccessible have been spared rather than robbed.  </s>
<s> I'll take a real, well thought out dialogue over attempts at pithiness and emoticons any day.  </s>
<s> And people can now stop sending me junk mail full of sappy sayings, "touching" stories, lewd jokes, and all that other crap I have no time and no use for.  </s>
<s> Why do so many people feel the need to pass that stuff on?  </s>
<s> I suspect that it comes from a feeling of disconnectedness which is exacerbated by the superficial nature of what's being sent.  </s>
<s> So it becomes a vicious circle, with more an more crap being exchanged and less and less real communication.  </s>
<s> Ugh.  </s>
<s> Finally, I lump animated greeting cards in with emoticons and all that other junk.  </s>
<s> If you can't spare the time to write three lines telling me what you really feel, why bother?  </s>
<s> Most of the time I discard animated greeting cards without even bothering to view them.  </s>
<s> (How accessible are animated greeting cards?  </s>
<s> But then I guess you wouldn't send one to someone who couldn't see it.  </s>
<s> Should we demand accessible alternatives for people who want to send on-line greeting cards but can't use the currently available ones?) Charles Munat Puerto Vallarta  </s>
<s> I disagree.  </s>
<s> I enjoy emoticons and find them to be a part of life.  </s>
<s> Its a perspective, one that I find to be humorous or to apply a point.  </s>
<s> I do also appreciate emotional communications that is well written.  </s>
<s> However, an air hug is not a serious or deeply moving message.  </s>
<s> Rather i find them to be a humorous and a part of communication or expression, like slang or an idiom.  </s>
<s> Some people will like to use emoticons and some people do not like to use emoticons.  </s>
<s> I can write a moving letter and i can also write a humorous one.  </s>
<s> Therefore, I am one that likes to use emoticons.  </s>
<s> But we can agree to disagree.  </s>
<s> Rob Neff, and air hug  </s>
<s> OKOKOK.  </s>
<s> I was going to keep silent but, regretably, I can't.  </s>
<s> Rail all you want, but you cannot keep language and language use from changing.  </s>
<s> Language is a living thing which grows, changes, and sometimes dies over generations.  </s>
<s> Consider how the Anglo-Saxons protested speaking French, or how the French still oppose other languages creeping into theirs (Vive Le Weekend!).  </s>
<s> For a while, I was collecting computer words which popped into the language: cyberkiosk, e-tailing, infobahn, etc.  </s>
<s> And, for what it's worth, the New York Times used emoticons in their crossword puzzle two years ago.  </s>

<s> "Rail all you want, but you cannot keep language and language use from changing.  </s>
<s> Language is a living thing which grows, changes, and sometimes dies over generations."  </s>
<s> This suggests that there is nothing we can do about it.  </s>
<s> Of course languages grow and change (I presume you were being metaphorical in calling it a "living thing").  </s>
<s> The question is, are "emoticons" helpful or hurtful to our language and our culture (whichever language and culture you happen to be part of)?  </s>
<s> I stand by my original contention that emoticons cheapen the language.  </s>
<s> And because I believe there is a strong connection between what we can express and what we can experience, I think that things that cheapen our language also cheapen our experience of life.  </s>
<s> And I think that we, as a society, are NOT helpless with regard to changes in our languages, our cultures, our ways of life.  </s>
<s> I vote for consciously choosing our behaviors after thinking about their ramifications.  </s>
<s> So far, I've not been too impressed with the laissez faire method of growing cultures (of people, that is... let's leave my refrigerator out of this).  </s>
<s> Why not take an active role?  </s>
<s> If I can boycott company A's products or company B's services, I can certainly boycott emoticons.  </s>
<s> I am all for changing and improving the language.  </s>
<s> That's why I don't like emoticons.  </s>
<s> I don't think that they are an improvement.  </s>
<s> But I appear to be in the minority on this subject.  </s>
<s> "I can write a moving letter and i can also write a humorous one.  </s>
<s> Therefore, I am one that likes to use emoticons."  </s>
<s> I don't see the connection here, unless you mean to say that emoticons are necessary to writing letters that are either moving or humorous.  </s>
<s> I, for one, also occasionally write letters that I hope will be humorous or moving, and they seem to have had that affect on others, judging by their responses.  </s>
<s> Yet I managed to do it without ever having to resort to emoticons.  </s>
<s> I still believe that they detract from, rather than enhance, the impact of what you want to say.  </s>
<s> In fact, many a well-written letter has been diminished (for me) by the addition of an emoticon, a smiley face, or the ubiquitous x's and o's.  </s>
<s> [Re: emotica, ASCII art and accessibility - some suggestions] "No-one 'relies' on them.  </s>
<s> People use them though, as part of a palette of ways of expressing things.  </s>
<s> Just because you don't want to extend your personal palette of expression - which is your right - by what right do you suggest that on that basis these things shouldn't be extended - if possible - to be accessible to include everyone."  </s>
<s> Balderdash.  </s>
<s> Are you saying that emoticons are not a form of shorthand?  </s>
<s> That what they represent cannot be expressed in standard English (or French, whatever)?  </s>
<s> If I make liberal use of acronyms in my prose, am I not relying on them to convey my message?  </s>
<s> Why would it be different for emoticons?  </s>
<s> And is using acronyms instead of verbalizing equivalent to extending one's palette?  </s>
<s> I think not.  </s>
<s> Emoticons shrink, not extend, the writer's ability to express feeling.  </s>
<s> Where words have a nearly infinite variety of shades, tints, nuances, emoticons are the equivalent of crayons.  </s>
<s> I am hardly a Luddite, but I do think that we should consider the ramifications of changes before we all leap on board.  </s>
<s> Emoticons may have served a purpose in certain type of electronic communication, and they can be amusing (though that has worn rather thin with their repetition), but I see no reason to move them out of their original arena and into the mainstream (alas, too late!).  </s>
<s> But, getting back to accessiblity and the lexical equivalent of plastic pink flamingos (emoticon-lovers: please retain your senses of humor): With regard to the third sentence: 1.  </s>
<s> Last I checked I have the right to suggest anything, but maybe I misread the first amendment.  </s>
<s> to point out that some level of accessibility can be attain even with current technology.  </s>
<s> An unusual suggestion for someone purportedly trying to prevent some from their God-given right to "see" emoticons.  </s>
<s> 3. Finally, I did not mean to imply that the current technology was up to the task or that improvements shouldn't be made.  </s>
<s> I am more interested in ASCII art than emoticons, for obvious reasons, but I have no problem with and would support efforts to, if people insist on using them, at least make them more accessible.  </s>
<s> I'm just sorry that it is necessary.  </s>
<s> And I think that some of those who haven't been able to see them may be just as sorry when they dicover how omnipresent they are becoming.  </s>
<s> Then again, I may be the only person in the known universe who hates emoticons.  </s>
<s> Just ask my wife.  </s>
<s> For those who have difficulty reading this without emoticon clues, I provide the following: Please scatter these throughout the above message as necessary to make it comprehensible.  </s>
<s> Just doing my part.  </s>

<s> Charles F. Munat, You are particularly good with language and I respect your opinion.  </s>
<s> There are lots of grammar changes over the years that I have found annoying.  </s>
<s> I to do not use those phrases.  </s>
<s> However, I recognize that a phrase that starts out as something grammatically incorrect (split infinitives for example) may become a part of our spoken language and are becoming accepted as a proper use of the english language.  </s>
<s> Perhaps Email is a passing thing and we will jump into Phone mail in the next 10 years.  </s>
<s> Then there will be more band width to the information with out emoticons.  </s>
<s> But we will still need devices or schemes to include this information for the hearing impaired.  </s>
<s> As I see it the problem is with Email and our culture, not our language.  </s>
<s> We are given a technology that is convenient fast and free, while we are given less time to express our selves.  </s>
<s> We have less time to consider and choose our words to express our selves adequately.  </s>
<s> And some of us have less incentive to be considerate since we will not have to meet them face to face and suffer the consequences on a physical level.  </s>
<s> Additionally, the art of conversation and to a lesser extent the written word has suffered because of the environment we are exposed to.  </s>
<s> I think that without these pressures we would need and use Emoticons less and our use of language would change as well.  </s>
<s> I'm sure we can come up with a technical solution to the Emoticon problem.  </s>
<s> The larger picture of our use of language may be more difficult to deal with.  </s>
<s> I will teach my children proper use and Email etiquette as a start.  </s>
