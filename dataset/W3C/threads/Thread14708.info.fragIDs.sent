<s> Let me try to address this issue at two levels.  </s>
<s> The first level is what to say in the next draft release.  </s>
<s> The second is how to understand and organize our subsequent work, at least in terms of what do do next, in this area.  </s>
<s> *A.? For the short term, there should be two sub-items under Guideline 3, which under the current numbering are 3.3 and 3.4.  </s>
<s> 3.3 says in effect (not necessarily these words) "Use language in such a way as to maximize understandability to the widest audience."  </s>
<s> 3.4 says in effect "Illustrate your points by extra-verbal means such as sounds and pictures."  </s>
<s> Between them they are the both-and which address both partial reading function and no reading function.  </s>
<s> THEN however we are indicating 'notes to the reviewer' there is a statement to the effect that "We realize that 3.3 and 3.4 do not fit our general requriements for checkpoints, in that there is no clue here as to how much is enough.? The group failed to come to consensus on 'an objective statement of how much is enough' in this area.? The identified techniques are expected to improve performance in this area, however."  </s>
<s> That is how I would deal in the short term with the problem of "is it a checkpoint" interacting with "how do we say it." *B.? For the long term, We seem to be agreed that this area needs work and we should come up with some sort of a management model for how to organize the work in this area.?  </s>
<s> I would suggest that a) maintaining the current working base of techniques as a hints engine in queryable form**, not answering "tell me what to do" but rather "just give me a clue," and b) dedicating a sub-team to working on techniques for Guideline 3 would be appropriate management decisions.? Somehow we need to use technology to let us work more at a technique prototyping and evaluation level and less at a debating society level.?  </s>
<s> This can be done, but deciding how is not an instant matter.  </s>
<s> ** discussing what this would mean is a separate issue.  </s>
<s> CMunat - stated The problem with checkpoint 3.3 is that it says nothing.  </s>
<s> We have simply Restated the goal, we are not providing any new information.  </s>
<s> What we need are METHODS for making content clear, simple, and understandable.  </s>
<s> GV:: We need to be careful here, The techniques doc is to provide ways of accomplishing something.  </s>
<s> I believe the guidelines should say what is to be accomplished,?  </s>
<s> -? but they should not specify HOW to do it, unless accessibility can only be served by doing things a particular way.??  </s>
<s> There ARE reasons for requiring things be done in a particular way sometimes... but we should not go there unless there is a good reason for it.  </s>
<s> I may not have picked up on it, but have we mentioned that for many instances images are preferred, ie buttons for toolbars and where screens are very small, to say nothing of those examples such as airplane fitters use, and when learning about for instance a new laptop ?  </s>
<s> ie consider whether an illustration might enhance a text description, and use less screen area.  </s>
