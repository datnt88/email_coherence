<s> If seamless accessibility means presenting different material to different audiences, each audience not knowing what the other is getting, then I am not at all in favour of it.  </s>
<s> LQ:: That's okay, because seamless accessibility doesn't mean that.  </s>
<s> With seamless accessibility, everyone gets the same content.  </s>
<s> It's just that users get content presented optimally for their browsing environment rather  </s>
<s> than a description of how that content might be presented in some foreign  </s>
<s> browsing environment.  </s>
<s> CMN::  </s>
<s> I am, like I suspect most people here, in favour of solutions to accessibilty problems which do not rely on the 'get a life - download hotbrowser version 567 for the BBC Micro to see this website' approach.  </s>
<s> LQ:: Exactly.  </s>
<s> When we describe how a page looks visually to the non-visual user, we're simply saying "Get a life--download eyes now" in a nicer way.  </s>
<s> D-links are obtrusive because they tell the non-visual user that he or she is viewing a visual page.  </s>
<s> For this reason, D-links should never be automatically rendered all the time; they should only be rendered when the user requests more information on how the page looks visually (as with the "*" key command in Lynx).  </s>

<s> LQ:: Sure, but what about my last sentence:  </s>
<s> When we start mixing an object's description and replacement (as has long  </s>
<s> been  </s>
<s> done with IMG's ALT attribute), we make it difficult for user agents to render content without the seams from a visual Web becoming a  </s>
<s> distraction.  </s>
<s> LQ:: I won't use long descriptions if it means that seamless accessibility becomes impossible.  </s>
<s> (This is why I don't use D-links.)  </s>
<s> Liam Quinn Web Design Group Enhanced Designs, Web Site Development  </s>
<s> LQ:: An author would use the LONGDESC attribute of IMG rather than an explicit D-link.  </s>
<s> With OBJECTs, the author has no method to give a long description since there is no LONGDESC attribute on OBJECT; perhaps a future version of HTML will fix this.  </s>
<s> WC:: Within the body of the OBJECT element, an author can provide as much  </s>
<s> text as they would like, or even alternative OBJECTs.  </s>
<s> If the OBJECT is of  </s>
<s> type "image/gif" and the user wishes not to load graphics, then the content  </s>
<s> of the OBJECT could be displayed or the user agent could create a button that will cause the text to be displayed on request.  </s>
<s> The user agent could do a number of things: pop up a window with the description, include the  </s>
<s> description in-line, or however the user wants it presented (ala style sheets, user agent configuration, or whatever else comes about).  </s>
<s> I think HTML has included the appropriate provisions for the user agents to do something interesting and useful.  </s>

<s> to follow up on what Wendy A Chisholm said:  </s>
<s> Let me expand the example a little.  </s>
<s> As seen from A title="sales trend analysis" href="/analysis/reports/1997/sales/year.html#trends" comparison with prior years /A , sales in 1997 were down, subsequent to...  </s>
<s> The linked year-end sales report paragraph is an HTML text that fulfills  </s>
<s> the role of a long description and references the GIF of the figure.  </s>
<s> The generic pattern is: OBJECT data :is: reference to image, and OBJECT content :is: summary message (action caption), and OBJECT content :links to: long description, and long description :is: hypertext, and long description :links to: image.  </s>
<s> The argument was, that with the freedom to put full HTML in the content of the OBJECT, one could include articulate references to all appropriate information of whatever form.  </s>
<s> The case we may not have paid sufficient attention to is the one where the user is displaying GIF images but still wishes to be aware that a description of the image is available.  </s>
<s> Al  </s>
<s> The other case which Al did not account for (and nor have I in thinking about OBJECT before, but I will be working on it Monday ;) is where users are not viewing any images etc to speed their browsing, but still want to know when to pick up an image.  </s>
<s> A link to the image inside the content of the object would be very helpful for such users, as well as a link to the description.  </s>
<s> Charles McCathieNevile [Some stuff about using objects]  </s>
<s> Of course, the DATA attribute of the OBJECT element provides a URL for the resource to which it refers.  </s>
<s> However, Charles has made an important point, for he correctly recognises that when image viewing has been deactivated, the reference to the graphical resource will not be available to the user.  </s>
<s> Two questions follow.  </s>
<s> Firstly, should this not be considered a "user agent" issue, given that in the case of a series of nested OBJECT elements which refer to different versions of the same resource (E.G. different image file formats) it is the responsibility of the user agent,  </s>
<s> not the author of the document in writing the textual content of OBJECT, to choose the version which is compatible with the available software?  </s>
<s> Secondly, if browsers were to provide an option whereby images could be requested individually, despite the user's having decided that they should not be displayed by default, how should this link be presented visually by a browser?  </s>
<s> It might also be asked whether the foregoing is an "accessibility" issue or just a question of good design practice.  </s>
<s> to follow up on what Jason White said:  </s>
<s> Yes, what browsers do with LONGDESC and OBJECT will affect what we should tell authors to do with them.  </s>
<s> And the consistency across browsers in how these elements are handled will affect our success in getting authors to follow the guidelines.  </s>
<s> So, I would like to encourage people who have found this thread "seamless..." interesting to follow through and pay attention to what the Browser Guidelines say or should say about these features.  </s>
