<s> Looks good.  </s>
<s> We can't machine check all the priority 1 items and will have to assume that the author does some manual checks.  </s>

<s> I have a comment with the step two (2) of the algorithm [which also relates to how BOBBY currently works]:  </s>
<s> 2. .."give the user the option to" seems to contradict "all manual check-off [items] shall require an explicit".  </s>
<s> The example is exactly the one I have a comment about, namely checking if ALT="text" is suitable for all images or if LONGDESC is needed.  </s>
<s> I shouldn't be forced to look at each and every single IMG tag to determine if LONGDESC is required.  </s>
<s> At a recent Internet rally in Austin where professional web design teams created web sites for community based non-profit organization [i.e. Goodwill] and were judged on accessibility - complained about the verbosity of BOBBY, especially the listing of ALL the IMG tags on every page to manually determine if the LONGDESC and again if the D link was needed.  </s>
<s> The report is overkill and turns off the author to accessibility with too much information.  </s>
<s> In my opinion it is OK to ask one time the question - are any of images in need of a LONGDESC?  </s>
<s> And if the author asks for it, to get a list of IMGs to consider - but not require the author to answer to each and every IMG used on the page.  </s>
<s> Proposed rewording for no. 2: 2. The tool shall give the user the option to manually check [deleted all] items on the web page that require manual checking.  </s>
<s> Irrelevant items shall be omitted (e.g. if there is no audio or video, manual checking of the textual equivalents is irrelevant.) [deleted All] Manual check-off items shall require an explicit action by the user for each checkpoint item the user asserts satisfies the guidelines (e.g. it is not necessary to manually check-off each and every image to assert that the ALT text is suitable and that a longer description is not necessary.  </s>
<s> One manual check for long descriptions per page with images is sufficient.  </s>
<s> ).  </s>
