I'm not sure if this has already come up, but a decent thing to require if text-in-images is used is that there be some pointer to a vector based alternative. 
Sometimes it is difficult to convey the same semantics from pictures to text, but if there were a slightly more accessible version of that image, it would be a help. 
I thought of this as I was preparing to draw yet another node and arc diagram for EARL, and realised how difficult it would be for a complex graph to put into words. 
Using SVG for this would be brilliant. 
Could you use longdesc for that, and then embed the SVG into the longdesc page?

Sure you could use longdesc for that. 
Or you could embed SVG directly - it can be done to transform reasonably nicely and include a link to the image for a browser only capable of handling it via a plugin/helper, like IE and Lynx. 
It is an open issue I think whether it is good to use longdesc for something that isn't HTML as a tatrget. 
There has already been work done on this - RDFViz, the text-only SVG browser written last year, etc. Cheers Charles McCN

Isn't this an appropriate use for the object tag?

TAKE CONTROL. 
There are tags, pseudo-tags, and "limbo-tags" and it sometimes seems as if object is currently sort of the latter g . 
Not quite a "vapo(u)r-tag" any more but it's interesting that it's supported by a coupla famous browsers but not in their Mac incarnations! 
(so I'm told). 
Love. 
ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE 
The generic requirement is for [markup and/or external metadata, if reliably usable] indicating a range of relationships to cover but not necessarily be identical to the notion of "equivalency" as used in WCAG 1.0. 
Longdesc is as presently defined inappropriate. 
html:object and smil:switch fit to some degree. 
These are also not dead center in their connotations. 
We need the capability to know the relationship in some subtlety, but also to be able to say vague things. 
What you are getting into is the need for a better information model concerning accessible content, and implementation of this information model via Web format syntax(es).
