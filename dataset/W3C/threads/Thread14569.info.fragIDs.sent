<s> Sure you could use longdesc for that.  </s>
<s> Or you could embed SVG directly - it can be done to transform reasonably nicely and include a link to the image for a browser only capable of handling it via a plugin/helper, like IE and Lynx.  </s>
<s> It is an open issue I think whether it is good to use longdesc for something that isn't HTML as a tatrget.  </s>
<s> There has already been work done on this - RDFViz, the text-only SVG browser written last year, etc. Cheers Charles McCN  </s>
