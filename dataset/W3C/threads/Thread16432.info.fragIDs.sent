Supposing that I wanted to provide both iconic and textual clues on a navigation bar, how would I go about it? 
It seems like an idea that might be good: provide an icon of a magnifying glass sext to the word "search", etc. Might speed up identification for the 
average user as well as one with cognitive disabilities. 
But under current guidelines, how does one provide meaningful "alt" text for an image that's only there to enhance a nearby text (link)? 
Having a screen reader render "Icon: Magnifying glass", "link: search", etc. for 5 or so icon-link pairs seems like a waste of the user's time, especially for something emphasizing brevity like a navbar. 
Would using alt="" carry that feeling of, "I don't know what this image was supposed to be"?

alt="", I would think. 
However, before you do this, given that many GUI browsers treat alt as "tool-tips", you should make sure that it is totally clear that the text duplicates the icon, even if the icon image is only displayed as a placeholder. 
If it really is only there to enhance, an nearby really means so near as to be obviously part of the same construct, there is no need for a non-empty alt string. 
I agree with Dave. 
In particular, I would make sure that it is clera that the image and the text are associated by including them in the same link, rather than having two seperate links to the same place.

Using ALT="" in the example you cite is quite reasonable.
