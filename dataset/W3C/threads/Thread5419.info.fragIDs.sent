<s> Would web-services be covered by this....  </s>
<s> This is my technical opinion.  </s>
<s> The way the patent is described, NO and YES, it depends.  </s>
<s> If I just have a URL on a why site that activates a side-side process (web server, cgi, ANYTHING) and the XML OUTPUT is strickly dumped in the BROWSER window, then NO.  </s>
<s> It is not covered.  </s>
<s> Now, with the new Microsoft XML components in IE, which takes the XML data and transforms it into a "visual tree outline", this YES.  </s>
<s> Any remote client applet that takes data and "transforms" it is covered.  </s>
<s> If the IE Browser "detected" that XML was coming to the BROWSER and it did not have a XML component and IE automatically went back to the WEB SITE to download the XML component, then MAYBE.  </s>
<s> I say MAYBE here because I see nothing in the patent that claims the automatic transfer of requirement component to the client machine as part of the business method.  </s>
<s> However, this may not matter and probably intentionally left out as it would had limited the scope of the patent.,  </s>

<s> Hi Hector and Hemant, Web Services is more about server-to-server processes.  </s>
<s> Although there are methods for calling a Service directly from MSIE, this is not the "standard" practice.  </s>
<s> A client, such as MSIE, may make a request to a Server that subsequently invokes a call to another Server - but the results of that call is not conveyed directly to the client.  </s>
<s> In fact, many of the webpages you may interact with may be making Web Service calls, but you'd never know it unless the page Author notified you deliberately.  </s>
<s> Web Service activity is not typically evident even if you look at page's "view-source".  </s>
<s> I'm a programmer and not a legal expert by any means (you should have seen my divorce settlement :-P), but based on what I've been gleaming from this list - I think Web Services are generally exempt.  </s>
<s> Web Services may use XML as the transmission protocol, but the XML called by a Webpage is not necessarily the result of some Web Service activity.  </s>
<s> Webpages that make calls to a Server to return XML, I think have to be treated as a separate topic.  </s>
<s> Like I mentioned in an earlier posting, MSIE strongly supports capturing external XML data.  </s>
<s> One method does employ the use of an embedded OBJECT/ , but the common use is a Microsoft extension for the HTML XML/ tag, which I understand is a "built-in" capability of MSIE.  </s>
<s> The HTML XML/ tag can be manipulated by Script to make Server calls, and then you can take the XML returned to the XML/ and then do a number of things like make a decision in Script, dynamically add or change the current HTML or initiate XSLT.  </s>
<s> Also, from what I understand, even client-side XSLT is a "native" capability of MSIE.  </s>
<s> Isn't this Patent more about invoking embedded (external) applets and controls, and not about the built-in native capabilities of MSIE?  </s>
<s> Or is all the technical definitions I've come to understand, more in control of the lawyers then the programmers?  </s>
