Folks, I am planning to make a new draft of the Techniques document available on Tuesday for people to get a feel for where it is heading. 
Please note that this is a working draft, and nothing in it need e final or perfect - the goal is to get a sense of how we think the techniques document might work in a revised edition. 
In order to get as much idea as possible, please send everything you have done, completed or not, to the list on Monday.

I have attached it here. 
There is one html document and a number of illustrative images. 
The piece is still rough with only a short description of the images appearing above them, as well as some ALT text.

One of the questions we will end up with is whether to use longdescs, d-links, or just describe images in the document text. 
Having something that may not be complete will still allow us to include it and get a feel for how the techniqeus document is developing, which is fairly important. 
Anyone else who has some stuff, please send it along. 
In fact I am not going to do the work until the end of the US east coast day today, so you have a few hours.
