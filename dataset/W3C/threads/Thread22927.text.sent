Here is a question about the copyright issues involved when creating a DOM implementation. 
The copyright notice creation of "modifications or derivatives". 
My perception is that the creation of a DOM implementation involves making a derivative work of the DOM API published in are published under the mentioned copyright notice, so how can any legal DOM (level 1) implementation exist? 
Regarding DOM level 2, there is a distinction between the "document" and the "bindings", with the latter being published under a different license that permits modifications. 
The copyright notice the "IDL binding", while the table of contents speeks of "Java Language Binding" and "ECMA Script Language Binding", but "IDL Definitions" instead of IDL binding. 
Are these "IDL Definitions" really meant by the term "IDL binding", and if they are, could this be made more clear in the level 2 document? 
Thanks for your thoughts, Tobias It seems fairly clear that the first "notice" refers to the documents on the W3C site. 
It is understandable that W3C would not authorize changes to the documents posted on its site, since this would lead to confusion about the official standard. 
The second "notice" refers to the "software and documentation." 
This is a software implemenation of the W3C standard and the documentation to use the implementation. 
This does authorize modification, but only on the conditions stated. 
By the way, there is a technical difference between a "notice" and a "license." 
A "notice" is merely notice to the user that a claim of copyright exists. 
Under the Berne Convention, no "notice" is required to secure copyright protection, although one is often used in some circles. 
Under the recent WIPO Copyright Treaty, a "notice" now becomes "rights management information" whose unauthorized removal is actionable in itself. 
A "license" is a contractual commitment, enforced by contract law in addition to enforcement allowed under copyright law. 
The W3C "Notice and License" appears to be both a notice and a license. 
Lorin Brennan This is not exactly true. 
"modifications or derivatives" is about the document itself. 
So yes, according to the DOM Level 1 copyright, you had no right to modify or create derivatives of the DOM Level 1 bindings. 
It doesn't prevent you to use them, btw. 
yes, we discovered that the DOM Level 1 document copyright statement is too restrictive for the bindings (in others words, the copyright for the bindings in DOM Level 1 was an error). 
So, following a comment from the Debian community, we changed the copyright statement to match their requirements of open source softwares. 
Good catch, this needs to be synchronized before the REC ! 
Thank you, Philippe While it does not prevent me from using this API in a given DOM level 1 implementation, but it actually prevents me from creating such an implementation. 
Here is a concrete example: I began to create a DOM level 1 wrapper in C++ around Daniel Veillards libxml. 
I used the IDL definitions file from the w3c website and modified it using an editor so that it becomes C++ class declarations. 
However, I realize now that I have created a modified copy of a part of the DOM level 1 specification document, and that I had no right to do that according to that document's copyright notice, thus I must not distribute the result. 
Using an IDL compiler won't help, since such a compiler does nothing else than creating a modified copy of the IDL definition file. 
Reading the Level 1 recommendation and creating a matching class hierarchie won't help either, it is also nothing else than creating a modified copy. 
I cannot see a way to create a DOM level 1 implementation without breaking copyright laws. 
So my question is: How have the existing DOM level 1 been created? 
Is there a way to achieve this without breaking copyright laws, a way that I simply fail to see? 
Tobias As I said, this is a known error in the DOM Level 1 spec (and it's going to be fixed soon since the DOM WG is planning to update the DOM Level 1 spec). 
The bindings of the DOM specification are under the Software notice: See also: btw, for the update, we never received any answer from the open source organization (http://www.opensource.org/osd.html) 
after our request to obtain the OSI certification ... Regards, Philippe Philippe Le Hegaret - http://www.w3.org/People/LeHegaret/ World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), DOM Activity Lead
