<s> Where is my dashes?  </s>
<s> Netscape Editor (from Netscape Navigator Version 3.0 Gold package) converts my "&amp;mdash;" into "&amp;amp;mdash;".  </s>
<s> How can Tidy be programmed to correct this substitution if any?  </s>
<s> Where is my named entity references?  </s>
<s> It seems that the same Netscape Editor translates a good deal of my named entities into text.  </s>
<s> E. g. "&amp;radic;" - "&amp;amp;radic;".  </s>
<s> How Tidy could help me to fix this problem if any?  </s>
<s> Where is my 'border="0"' attribute?!  </s>
<s> So, could Tidy be programmed to insert 'border="0"' attribute into  </s>
<s> table " tag when or where this attribute is omitted.  </s>
<s> It is because of  </s>
<s> the same Netscape Editor again.  </s>
<s> The Editor eats 'border="0"' attributes (with value "0").  </s>
<s> From http://www.w3.org/People/Raggett/tidy/ : "Tidy supports a small set  </s>
<s> of character encoding options.  </s>
<s> The default is ASCII, which makes it easy to edit markup in regular text editors."  </s>
<s> So, Tidy will not convert Windows cp1251 and Windows cp1253 pages into UTF-8 pages in future?  </s>

<s> You may ask me why I insert here form tag before td tag and don't do that after td tag.  </s>
<s> Well, I explain it with pleasure :).  </s>

<s> Tidy has no way of knowing if &amp;amp;mdash; is an editor bug or what the user actually wanted.  </s>
<s> Also, stylesheets and other things could be effecting table borders, so assuming border="0" when it's not specified could easily mess things up.  </s>
<s> In short, I can't see any of that being put into tidy.  </s>
<s> Luckily it sounds like those are bugs in Netscape 3. If possible, try upgrading to Mozilla - it's Netscape without the corporate crappyness.  </s>
