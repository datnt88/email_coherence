A.10.1 said: 1. 
For auto-refreshing or timed response pages, provide a second copy of the page where refresh only happens after a link has been selected (until user agents provide this ability themselves). 
[Priority 1] And I promised to write some techniques for it. 
Actually Daniel had asked for a lot of detail. 
So here is my short essay... Redirection of users can be very disorienting. 
It is quite common to find a page which contains META HTTP-EQUIV="REFRESH" CONTENT="7;url=somewhere.com.nu" and a note on the page explaining that the page has moved, and asking the user to update their bookmarks. 
This in fact violates the principle that standard mark-up should be used. 
While META HTTP-EQUIV is standard HTML, REFRESH is not standard in HTTP - it is simply recognised by many User Agents. 
There is a REDIRECT statement which can be used analagously. 
The actual accessibility problem is that reading speeds vary. 
What may seem adequate time to let a user read the page could be completely inadequate for somebody using a screen reader which doesn't get to the line before the page has vanished, or somebody with a reading difficulty who has been unable to get the message before something completely new has appeared. 
Similarly with timed-response requirements in active content. 
Although there is often a strong motivation for the timing requirement, it can cause problems for a number of groups and should be used with great care. 
In pages which do this I have two suggestions: 1. Don't. 
Leave the user to follow a link to the new page [CMN:: I don't know how well this will sell] 2. Provide, first thing on the page, a link like "SLOW DOWN", to a version of the page which doesn't change. 
CMN:: This is really a problem that User Agents should solve. 
But they generally don't, although Lynx does it beautifully. 
One of the interesting things I have had happen with JAWS is that it is reading a page which is two or three links behind where I am. 
That's confusing to me. 
Sigh. 
Another of Daniel's judgement call problems.

W3C Web Accessibility Initiative - http://www.w3.org/WAI 545 Technology sq., Cambridge MA, USA Since the problem is mostly confusion, as the page that disappears abruptly is usually void of information, I would say "don't" with a P2. 
It's also bad design, should be done by the server, and it's really annoying when using the back button, as one as to hit back twice before the page move forward again... 
I don't think that's a valid approach, as the time for someone with a disability to read and activate this "slow down" link is probably greater than the time author are willing their mainstream audience to stay on this page.

CMN:: The checkpoint does not apply to instant redirects (eg PURLs) - they are part of the medium with which one needs to become familiar. 
I didn't think of suggesting them here since they are explicitly exempted by the guideline, but maybe we should.

CMN:: It might be valid if there is enough time, but i don't think it is very good.

W3C Web Accessibility Initiative http://www.w3.org/WAI MIT/LCS - 545 Technology sq., Cambridge MA, 02139, USA Well, according to the specifications there isn't. 
The mechanism in teh Recommendations is to do exactly as Nir suggests. 
What is often used is the pseudo-HTTP command refresh, which has been implemented by a number of browsers directly, and does allow for a timed redirect. 
Perhaps we should recommend not using the timed redirect more strongly. 
Charles With all due respect, there is no such thing as "instant rediction" or "timed response". 
The optimal way to redirect the user to a new page when a URL is moved permanently is by returning the status code 301 as per HTTP/1.1 (some older servers like CERN's can't do that but can give a 302 status code which is almost as good) Whether this is instant or not is up to the user agent. 
For example the W3C validator recognizes the HTTP status codes 301 and 302 but informes the user of the new location rather than validating instantly the document in the new location. 
I would recommend using the appropriate redirect HTTP status, and if this is impossible, just to place a page with a normal link to the new URL, indicating that this technique is suboptimal as link checker programs and indexing robots are less likely to update their records timely if at all. 
For the sake of completeness I would mention the the META refresh thing is non-standard (without a disscussion) and that it is not supported by many agents.
