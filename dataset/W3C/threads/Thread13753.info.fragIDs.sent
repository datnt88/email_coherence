<s> Three of these comprise the present Appendix, with checklist, acknowledgments and references; but a fourth gives a brief introduction to the issues for authors who are unfamiliar with the technology.  </s>

<s> I think that my original position has been somewhat overlooked in the ensuing discussion.  </s>
<s> What I am suggesting is: 1.  </s>
<s> A paragraph of two of text introducing assistive technology, in the appendix to the guidelines.  </s>
<s> 2. A sentence referring to this information, included in the introduction.  </s>
<s> Given that the appendix already includes (1) checklist, (2) acknowledgments, and (3) references, and that it is not part of the guidelines proper, I do not think that the issue of unduly lengthening the guidelines genuinely arises.  </s>
<s> An author who wishes to do so can retrieve the document via the web, read quickly through the introduction and the guidelines, and then ignore the appendix, without any loss of efficiency.  </s>
<s> I would also reiterate Judy's point that "how does a person with a visual disability use a computer, let alone the web?" must be placed at the top of my list of frequently asked questions, in any discussion of these issues with people who are unacquainted with assistive technology.  </s>
<s> A brief explanation would not only satisfy understandable curiosity, but also provide insight into the rationale for the guidelines.  </s>
<s> The more interested readers can then refer to the level 2 document or the central reference document for a more detailed analysis.  </s>
