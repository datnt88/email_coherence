Verry nice, the switch between edit and browse mode. 
One question on it: Can it be automatic? 
I think of the nedt options: If the file (on read) is readonly, switch to browse mode If the file (on read) is writable, switch to edit mode Files fetched with from internet should be regarded as 'readonly' by default, except for given domains: in the thotrc file: "writable domains". 
With respect to this, the domain ftp://user:passwd@host.domain/ is an other domain as ftp://host.domain/. 
Once the file is saved (with save as) it is a new (writable) file and a switch to edit mode is expected accordingly.

I'm not sure it's a good idea to automate it. 
It should be experimented. 
Are your ready to do that? 
Regards Irene. 
It's no problem to have it as it is, i just compared amaya with vi or nedit, both ascii editors on unix. 
They switch to view mode on read-only files and switch back to R/W mode after a 'save-as'. 
I just find this comfortable and easy to use and therefore placed the request. 
If Amaya has a statement on it, I'm only one user vote to change this.

I would have to vote against such a mode sensitive behaviour (if we really have a vote) as changing from one to two clicks for link traversal. 
Consistant UI operation is very important from a usability point of view. 
I understand that such a UI thing is down to personal preference. 
Personally, I use IE quite a lot, and I like single-click browsing. 
I 
was not suggesting that the change of click-operation should be the only one we support, or even the default. 
I was just pointing out that this kind of thing would be possible, and would (I believe) work better if the mode switching was automatic. 
Automatic switching from r/w to view would be nice but hard for a user to manage in the long run I would think. 
I'm not sure I agree, but I am willing to differ on you here. 
How about we consider adding such functionality, but on a user configurable basis? 
I would perfer that the Amaya team concentrate on completing implementation of the core functions such as css1/2 style sheets (my favorite) and all of html4.0. 
Of course. 
In my case however, I do not have the time (or the knowledge) to add such core features. 
However, small changes, as these seem to be, are well within my range. 
I am not suggesting that people such as Irene or others spend time on such things whilst core functionality is missing, but I may well be able to find the time for these things.

[ Snip ] This behaviour seems sensible to me, too; those who only use Amaya to edit will find that the behaviour is exactly as it was before (always read-write), whilst those that browse will gain the benefits of read-only mode. 
I have recently been thinking that I would like Amaya to change certain factors of its behaviour when in read-only (browsing) mode. 
For example, following links and pressing buttons could be single-click actions instead of double-clicks. 
The toolbar could also change. 
For example, the save button could be replaced by a "home" button. 
These features would make Amaya more comfortable to use when browsing. 
All of the functionality could of course be activated or deactivated depending upon the user's configuration. 
I think that the automatic RO/RW switch would complement such features, and that such a switch is acceptable. 
Vote 2 :-) Ewan Mellor.

I think Amaya is great so far and have starting using it extensively except for editing things that take too much time and trouble with a GUI. 
Just my 2 cents. 
Hmmmm, what would that be in Euros?

In many environments the activate metaphor is associated with the double-click and not the simple-click. 
I guess Web browsers are exceptions, surely due to 
the first Mosaic implementation. 
Regards Irene. 
How true. 
but where is the border between a mode and UI operation? 
I think that's up to the design team. 
Users can always ask for change but it is still up to the design team to accept or reject the change. 
True again but there is a (growing) difference between creating/editing and viewing/debugging. 
They are both required. 
On this issue, I vote for changing the default window. 
Now it is the 'with pictures' view. 
I'd like to change that to one of the other views like the structure or the text only (alternate) view. 
While editing tables and other sturctures, there is no need to update the other views while I'm editing this. 
Still 2 cents. 
The 1/100 part of an Euro is the Euro-Cent. 2 us-dollar cents round to 2 euro cents. 
2 dutch-guilder cents round to 1 euro cent. 
what other cents are there around the world? 
What is the HTML definition of the EURO sign? 
Like the Cent symbol is &amp;#162; the pound is &amp;#163; the yen is &amp;#165;

This makes sense to me. 
Click - erm (thinking sound)(select) Click Click - Yes (do something) The other option is to support the three button mouse world [select][menu][adjust] Left mouse would activate a link Middle mouse would pull up a menu in the context of a link Right mouse can extend a selection or tick off options in a pop up menu without dismissing it. 
But this is probably too far from the Microsoft UI hegemony. 
To digress. 
Most young people, in my experience, don't know where the concept of cut &amp; paste comes from!

It's actually already in the HTML 4 spec: Also, for confusion, Unicode seems to define both a "euro-currency sign at A0 and a "euro sign" at AC!

There's an addendum at the unicode site the clarifies the encoding for the Euro symbol.
