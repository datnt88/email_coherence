Hi I thought I had the same problem but I checked with the Amaya new version I'm using (5.1 for windows) and it works: Open the source window, Resize it to your will, Go in the main window, Special menu and save the current geometry. 
Close the source window or exit amaya and start it again, the source window has now the customized size. 
True, the command "Save current geometry" (see Special/Preferences/Window geometry) saves the geometry of all open views for the current document. 
This command is only available in the main view of the document but it works on all views. 
What is not 'customable' is the size of the font in the source window. 
I always have to 'alt' + '-' several times in order to have a workable source window. 
You can customize the default font size in Special/General/General by changing the value of "Font zoom". 
This applies for the Amaya running on windows only. 
The amaya I use on unix has a suitable font size in the source window (and I just checked the 'Special menu\save geometry' in the main window works as well for source window). 
Shall I send a mail to amaya-dev or whichever list it is? 
This answer is sent to www-amaya@w3.org. 
Thanks Coralie.

: [continuing a private thread with Irene] Using amaya 5.1 on linux, the Special menu of the view source window is always inactive (so I cannot save the current geometry of this window). 
I know at least Max has the same problem. 
Anybody else ?

'-1' is OK, '-2' makes the font too small. 
'-1.5' would be just fine if it worked... I've never loaded fonts with a font-size equal to 10.5pt. 
Irene. 
I'm afraid I don't understand your point. 
Do you mean that the font-zoom I would like to set ('-1.5') is equal to 10.5 pt in font-size, and that it is impossible to get it? 
I'm a bit confused here as 'font-size' is a concept I'm aware of (it is expressed in ponits) whereas 'font-zoom' is a concept I would be tempted to express in percent. 
Of course font-zoom is a percentage. 
As Amaya uses integer values for font sizes we considered that a minimum percentage step of 1% was okay. 
The main problem remains the use of integer values for font sizes, but current APIs used by Amaya on Windows and X-Window platforms require integer values. 
When we'll change to OpenGL we could reconsider this choice. 
Could you confirm that font zoom -1.5 equals font-size 10.5 pt and that it isn't possible to set it? 
The font zoom is an integer value so today you cannot choose a decimal value. 
If the initial font size is 12pt and the font zoom is 1 the loaded font-size will be 11pt. 
If the initial font-size is 12pt and suppose you can give a font zoom 1.5 the loaded font-size would be be 11pt too.
