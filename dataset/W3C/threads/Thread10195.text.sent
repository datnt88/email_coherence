I attach a marked up copy of the concepts doc containing a lot of green ink. 
The good news is that its green which makes it stylistic rather than substantive comment. 
The bad news is that there is a lot of it. 
I've only got about half way through. 
I'll try to find time tomorrow to mark up the rest, but may have to steal it from working on schema with Danbri. 
Brian Brian I hope that Graham and I will be able to work out a detailed response soon - however I wanted to make a high level comment, partly because I feel relatively neutral and can see both sides of a philosophical disagreement. 
Back in July we had extended e-mail and telecon time on this document, with the main contention being its scope and purpose. 
Some of Graham's original hopes were scaled back, but I don't think your puritanism (which I could support) was endorsed by the WG. 
I felt that there was support for some of Frank's recorded comments: 14:45:38 dajobe-la fmanola: material in M&amp;S which was explantory in nature which has exlcuded from other specs 14:45:59 dajobe-la ... and should be kept around, but primer was being overloaded - too long 14:46:37 dajobe-la .. needed a different home but end up with a kind of scrapbook 14:46:57 dajobe-la ... so need to fill it out to make it look more coherent 14:47:04 dajobe-la which tends to duplicate other stuff I believe that Graham and I should look at whether your comments can help us reduce duplication, but I do not believe that the WG wants the normative documents to be anoerexic; and I will be very surprised if we accept all of your comments. 
Personally I would support an editorial style across our normative Recs which said that discursive and non-normative material is, where possible, omitted. 
This would impact all the specs except for vocabulary, and maybe test cases. 
I think syntax would be approx halved, concepts possibly more serverely, the model theory would be somewhat thinned - the proposed lbase appendix would be aborted. 
I doubt that such a policy would get wg support, not least because too many of the WG are editors who would lose some of the text with which they intend to educate the world. 
A further problem with such a policy is that at least parts of our discursive material (such as the introductory parts of the model theory) have been very well received. 
(In fact, if we were to have such a policy, I would hope an exception would be made for that part of the model theory). 
I might need to consult with the ink and toner divisions before casting HP's vote for such a policy. 
As always, there is time pressure; and given that we haven't had such a policy as clear in advance I think it is unrealistic to expect the next batch of WD to follow it. 
Jeremy I have given up on getting the kind of minimalist specs I would prefer. 
However there is a matter of degree. 
So will I. 
I'm not looking for such a policy. 
I have come to accept some discursive material. 
It is the quality of that material that is now my concern. 
I don't. 
I'm highlighting these issues now so the editors have a sense of the scale of work required to get to last call. 
Brian Brian, I find a majority of your comments to be helpful. 
There are some where, no surprise, we fundamentally disagree. 
I'll respond here to the problematic ones, and those where I seek further clarification; the others I'll work on with editorial discretion. 
Section 2, references to background material. 
Recalling the difficulties I had when originally learning about RDF, I think references to background information are really important. 
I will look to de-emphasize them so that they may appear less ostentatious, but I strongly resist removing them. 
(But if anyone feels they are not the most appropriate references I would be happy to entertain others.) Much of the material in section 2.2.7 was included in response to a reasonable comment, though I agree mostly belongs in concepts. 
I'll reorganize it rather than remove it. 
Terms, definition/introduction and use: I have tried to use HTML styles dfn and cite for these; the formatting is just what's in the stylesheet. 
These happen to be easy to apply using my HTML editor. 
Section 2.4.4: 
Datatypes, means and ends: I don't agree with, or misunderstand, your comment. 
I think a datatype *is* a _means_, the _end_ being to do roughly what I said. 
I'll try for some wording that finesses the distinction. 
Section 2.4.5: 
I think this section makes an important point. 
I can massage the words. 
Section 2.4.6: 
Most of this was in response to an observed confusion. 
Entailment is a different kind of specification from those found in other protocol definitions, and I felt that it needed some exposition. 
#g Graham Klyne Why? 
The job of a spec is to specify. 
If we wanted to explain why things are the way they are we should have written a rationale as well. 
I feel pretty strongly about this. 
Ah that sounds right. 
Well you say [[Datatyping in RDF is the use of a datatype to associate a lexical form with a denoted value.]] 
That is a means to achieve the end I suggested [[Datatypes are used in RDF to represent values such as integers, floating point numbers and dates.]] 
Then goal is to express values. 
What point? 
Err, RDF isn't a protocol. 
You are right it needs some mention, but as I suggest, perhaps fewer more focussed words. 
Brian Short answer: because it's information that I would have found very helpful when I was trying to understand about RDF. 
I'll spare you a long answer, and suggest a compromise: (a) I separate the citations into a separate section titled something like "background reading". 
(b) We coordinate with Frank to put that section into the Primer. 
(a) there may be alternative serialization forms (b) RDF/XML is the (only) one that is standardized by this family of specifications #g Graham Klyne gk: There is a need to counterbalance a view that N-triples is a normative serialization. 
N-Triples get used by: RDF test cases; RDF Syntax; OWL test case and OWL abstract Syntax (sort of). 
Given that RDF/XML is disgusting and N-triples (and N3) aren't if we don't emphasis that N-triples is not a standard then there is a danger of misunderstanding. 
Whether this belongs here or not is another issue. 
Some of my comments on the syntax doc had the intent of emphasising the lack of normativity of N-triple.
