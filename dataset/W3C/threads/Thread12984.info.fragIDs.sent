For our EOWG teleconference today, please review the revisions which I have incorporated into the EOWG Deliverables list from our recent discussion: Note also the expanded "done" section at the bottom -- cheers.

Under the heading "Tabbing through structural elements (scenario -- ", it is stated that: 1. "...one strategy for rapidly scanning through links, headers, list items, or other structural items on a Web page is to use the tab key to go through the items in sequence." 
Comments: 
- As I know, whether one is using AT or not, one can only tab through anchors (hyperlinks) and form controls on a page and not to headers, list items, or other structural items . 
2. Refer to next statement :"People who are using screen readers -- whether because they are blind or dyslexic -- may tab through items on a page, as well as people using voice recognition." 
- the statement needs to be reconstructed so that "people using voice recognition" is listed before the words "may tab through".

I suggest that Accountant with blindness be redone to bring out more clearly how a blind user surfs the Web. 
It refers to more checkpoints (listed at end). 
Of course if it is acceptable then it can be put in the format as the rest of the personna. 
Rewrite of Accountant with blindness: She uses the speech output, combined with navigating by headings (3.5)on a page , to quickly orient herself to the contents and its structure for rapid scanning of a document, and has become accustomed to listening to speech output at a speed that her co-workers cannot understand at all. 
She uses refreshable braille output to check the exact wording of text, since braille enables her to read the language on a page more precisely. 
She uses special key combinations of the screen reader that makes it announce the title(13.2) of every unfamiliar page that loads. 
It also reads other information like number of links, headings and forms on the page that helps her determine a navigation strategy. 
She tabs through the links on a page or often uses a feature of the screen reader to list all the links and then uses first letter navigation to quickly get to the one she needs to. 
She can do this because the targets of every link is terse and clearly identified. 
(13.1) 
Much of the information on the Web documents used at her company is in data-tables, which can sometimes be difficult for non-visual users to read. 
However, since the tables on this company's documents are marked up clearly with column and row headers ( 5.1 and 5.2) and captions and summaries (5.5) which her screen reader can access, she easily orients herself to the information in the tables. 
Her daily tasks include usinng Web based forms to enter journal entries into the company's accounting system. 
She knows what data she needs to enter in each input box as she tabs through them as their field labels are read out to her because the labels are explicitly associated with the controls. 
(12.4) 
Since the insurance codes she must frequently reference include a number of abbreviations and acronyms, she finds the expansions of abbreviations and acronyms the first time they appear on a page allows her to better catch the meaning of the short versions of these terms. 
(4.2) As one of the more senior members of the accounting staff, Ms. Laitenen must frequently help newer employees with their questions. 
She has recently upgraded to a browser that allows better synchronization of the screen display with audio and braille rendering of that information. 
This enables her to better help her colleagues, since the screen shows her colleagues the same part of the document that she is reading with speech or braille output.

Opera allows the user to do what Internet Explorer does with the Tab key (with the A and Q keys) but also through section headings using the S and W keys. Whether readers of the document will know this is another matter.

Hello Allan, But the doc specifically refers to the tab key. 
With screen readers too one can jump to headings, lists, tables etc using alphabet keys or number keys but that is not "tabbing through the doc". 
That's why I made the suggestion.
