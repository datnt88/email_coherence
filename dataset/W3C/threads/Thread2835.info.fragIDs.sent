In section 13.3.3 
"Weak and Strong Validators", the statements "The weak comparison function MAY be used for simple (non-subrange) GET requests. 
The strong comparison function MUST be used in all other cases." and "A cache or origin server receiving a conditional request, other than a full-body GET request, MUST use the strong comparison function to evaluate the condition." 
state the same requirement.

It isn't quite the same thing. 
One states requirements on the client, and the other on origin servers or proxies. 
It is a bit confusing, and may be redundant. 
Jeff, what is the right thing to do here?

Jeff, what is the right thing to do here? 
It may be a bit confusing, but it's not really redundant. 
The problem is the passive voice (i.e., lack of explicit subject). 
One might change the first statement to read: Clients MAY use the weak comparison function for simple (non-subrange) GET requests. 
They MUST use the strong comparison in all other cases. 
However, on reflection, it's a little more complicated than this. 
Since the comparison is normally done at the server, what we really want to do is to prevent the client from issuing a request that cannot be properly evaluated. 
So, how about moving this paragraph up before the previous one (begins with "The only function"), and changing it to read: Clients MAY issue simple (non-subrange) GET requests with either weak validators or strong validators. 
Clients MUST NOT use weak validators in other forms of request. 
Which makes it basically a formal statement of the informal description in the next previous paragraph.
