Hello all, I just subscribed to the list (in the process of actually), so please copy me in any response as well as the list, for a day or two. 
I have just started using Amaya, I am hoping to use it as my editor of choice. 
I'm impressed thus far, but have one area of concern. 
How do I handle links that reference the top of the web tree but not the server? 
An example: On our server we have (like everyone else) a logo at the top of the page. 
I specify the link as src="/graphics/logo.gif". 
I don't include the server as this page is eventually mirrored on other servers and making an absolute link wouldn't work when moving the site. 
On the same token, I don't want to use a relative link, as this page may move around in the structure of things, but the top graphics directory will never move. 
So, when working locally on my machine, is there a way to tell Amaya that /home/mystuff/ is the top of the web tree?

That is effectively a problem. 
The '/' references the top level of the web server when you have http pages, but the root of the files system when you have local pages. 
What you're proposing is to let the user defines his default root when he works on local pages. 
I guess it's a good idea and we're considering that in the next release.

Maybe Amaya could handle the "~" in a configurable way as well? 
Like /~collection1/... ---- dir1 /~collection2/... ---- dir2

Sounds to me like what we really want is a completely configurable and general URL aliasing scheme. 
Apache has a mechanism for doing that sort of thing - perhaps we want something similar.
