<s> Hello all, I just subscribed to the list (in the process of actually), so please copy me in any response as well as the list, for a day or two.  </s>
<s> I have just started using Amaya, I am hoping to use it as my editor of choice.  </s>
<s> I'm impressed thus far, but have one area of concern.  </s>
<s> How do I handle links that reference the top of the web tree but not the server?  </s>
<s> An example: On our server we have (like everyone else) a logo at the top of the page.  </s>
<s> I specify the link as src="/graphics/logo.gif".  </s>
<s> I don't include the server as this page is eventually mirrored on other servers and making an absolute link wouldn't work when moving the site.  </s>
<s> On the same token, I don't want to use a relative link, as this page may move around in the structure of things, but the top graphics directory will never move.  </s>
<s> So, when working locally on my machine, is there a way to tell Amaya that /home/mystuff/ is the top of the web tree?  </s>

<s> That is effectively a problem.  </s>
<s> The '/' references the top level of the web server when you have http pages, but the root of the files system when you have local pages.  </s>
<s> What you're proposing is to let the user defines his default root when he works on local pages.  </s>
<s> I guess it's a good idea and we're considering that in the next release.  </s>
<s> Regards Irene.  </s>
<s> Maybe Amaya could handle the "~" in a configurable way as well?  </s>
<s> Like /~collection1/... ---- dir1 /~collection2/... ---- dir2  </s>

<s> Sounds to me like what we really want is a completely configurable and general URL aliasing scheme.  </s>
<s> Apache has a mechanism for doing that sort of thing - perhaps we want something similar.  </s>
