Hi all, ever wanted to know why XML Signature is an evil technology authored by Microsoft to "rule the world of authorization"? 
Sorry, just kidding, but anyhow, consider a look at this funny article: Best regards, Christian In a message dated 07/12/01 09:26:40 GMT Standard Time, Hm. :( When I see an article that refers to "Draft Standard" (capitalised) stage for a W3C specification, I have to ask if the author understands W3C process. 
When I see an article which recommends, as the first resource to be read, XML Schema Part I REC .... 
I have to doubt the author's sanity. 
:) ... If you have ever tried to read XML Schema Part I REC you will probably know what I mean. 
It certainly isn't an easy read even if you want to understand W3C XML Schema. 
But as first thing to read about XML Signature ... ShakesHeadInAmazement/ Andrew Watt On the other hand, if you know the first thing about IETF process then you know that "Draft Standard" is the step after "Proposed Standard" and before "Standard", and it's a lot more official than the word "Draft" makes it sound. 
The above was sent to me off list and raises, from my point of view, an issue relating to IETF process which I hope isn't too off topic. 
Some list members may be aware that a reason W3C issues "Recommendations" rather than "Standards" is that W3C is a non-governmental body and, so I understand, only inter-governmental bodies have an official right to issue "Standards". 
What is IETF's viewpoint on issuing "Standards"? 
Is it, implicitly, claiming that an IETF "Standard" is legitimately so named? 
I am not trying to start a flame war or any such thing. 
But it does seem potentially confusing that IETF issues "Standards", given what I understand to be the status of IETF. 
Andrew Watt I agree about Schema. 
But on "Draft Standard", XML Digital Signature is being developed by a joint IETF/W3C working group and going up both standards ladders simultaneously. 
As well as its W3C status, it is an IETF Proposed Standard (via RFC 3075) and would probably have already been approved as a Draft Standard if it were not for some bureaucratic delays. 
I expect it to be approved during the IETF meeting in Salt Lake City next week. 
I haven't read it all but the author of the cited article seem opposed to standards having any flexibility so they can be extended, for example, by Microsoft... And they seem to think that the use of URIs (actually they always say URLs...) to identify and label things like algorithms implies dereferencing them and dependence of the site specified in the URL. 
I don't agree. 
Since there is a provision for feedback, I posted a negative comment on the article including pointing out that I couldn't possibly be biased by being a co-author of the XMLDSIG standard :-) Donald From: Svgdeveloper@aol.com Resent-Message-Id: 200112070940.EAA23197@www19.w3.org Message-ID: 134.5dffff7.2941e86a@aol.com

The IETF is hardly the first non-governmental agency to do this. 
Industry and professional groups issue technical standards all the time, and even the American National Standards Institute is non-governmental although it has some government representation. 
There is nothing wrong with W3C entitling its work products "Recommendations" rather than "Standards", but it's not a necessary consequence of its non-governmental status. 
Any members of the W3C who think that it is are unreasonably modest.

Date: Fri, 7 Dec 2001 07:04:03 EST The opinion of may people in the IETF is that the above is superstition. 
In fact, the status of something as being mandated by government immediately makes some IETF people suspicous. 
After all, if a network protocol was worth anything, people would use it spontaneously and the greatest strength of the early IETF efforts was that they were not even just purely voluntary but their adoption was activley discouraged by most civil governments. 
Surely it's implict and obvious from the IETF documents which give the procedures for the issuance of what the IETF and virtually everyone else in the unvierse calls standards? 
Are you actually being so pedantic as to make a distinction based on the captialization in English of the word S/standard? 
How is this different from the PKCS series of Public Key Cryptogrpahic Standards issued by RSA or the zillions of other standards issued by consortia and companies? 
Given the demonstranted incompetance of governments at promulgating successful internetworking protocols, why should they have some magic monopoly on the word "standard"? 
Although it was common in the early days of the IETF, I haven't heard anyone raise the issue you do for over five years. 
It's sort of refreshing, actually... If governments want to impress people who are impressed by governments, they should label their stuff "government standards" to avoid confusion. 
Donald Basically it comes down to quibbling over terminology. 
What makes a specification a standard is the degree to which compliance is a achieved, not how that compliance was achieved. 
For example, the Simple API for XML (SAX) is not a W3C Recommendation in the way that DOM is, but it is clearly a standard XML API in the sense that the majority of programmers and software component vendors have agreed to adopt it. 
Another example would be Sun's J2EE specification. 
Whether you call a standard a 'Standard', or a Recommendation or a Specification it is the level of compliance that is the only true measure. 
If you stop and think about it. the government couldn't possibly afford to rubber stamp every standard. 
Every sector, industry and professional group has a body of standards that are maintained by appropriate consortia, working groups and standards organizations, just for the government to give a nod of approval to all the standards that exist would cost billions each year to administer. 
In the US this nod of approval is usually delegated to the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), a private non-profit organization. 
Governments will only intervene in the standards process where the mutual interests of commerce are threatened, the canonical example being 'weights and measures' and the standard national currency that were first formalized in the Magna Carta: "Let there be one measure for wine throughout our kingdom, and one measure for ale, and one measure for corn, namely 'the London quarter'; and one width for cloths whether dyed, russet or halberget, namely two ells within the selvedges. 
Let it be the same with weights as with measures" And also within the US constitution: "To coin money, regulate the value thereof, and of foreign coin, and fix the standard of weights and measures? 
" Note the lack of capitalization on the word 'standard' :-) In most cases this is abundantly clear already. 
The federal government via the Department of Commerce standards agency, the National Institute of Standard and Technology (NIST) publish standards for use with federal government computer systems (Federal Information Processing Standards or FIPS). 
The FIPS are published in the Federal Register and only govern standards for use within government agencies and private organizations that communicate with those systems; they do not restrict the standards activities of industry. 
In fact, NIST are legally mandated to adopt voluntary industry standards where they are available and only publish FIPS in the absence of such standards: "In accordance with the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 (Public Law 104-113) and Administration policies, NIST supports the development of voluntary industry standards both nationally and internationally as the preferred source of standards to be used by the Federal government. 
The use of voluntary industry standards eliminates the cost to the government of developing its own standards, and furthers the policy of reliance upon the private sector to supply goods and services to the government." 
(http://www.itl.nist.gov/fipspubs/geninfo.htm) 
Clearly federal standards are considered the special case and not the norm. 
Voluntary standards constitute the vast majority of current standards with which even the federal government prefer to comply.
