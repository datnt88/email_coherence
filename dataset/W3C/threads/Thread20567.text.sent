I followed the instructions for unix install but I got stuck on both the tarball and CVS installs at make all, because it had alot of errors like ../../thotlib/include/thot_gui.h:134:24: 
Xm/MwmUtil.h: 
No such file or directory ../../thotlib/include/thot_gui.h:135:26: 
Xm/BulletinB.h: 
No such file or directory I don't have an Xm directory nor a MwmUtil.h file anywhere. 
I have LessTif 0.92.32 installed, not openmotif. 
LessTif should provide same include files (it does if you get the development kit). 
You can also test to compile the GTK version. 
This time I installed Amaya 6.2 via rpm but in the future I may want to try the CVS version. 
Suggestions for next time? 
thank u, george p.s. on step 1 of http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/cvs.html it says "On i both /i Windows and Unix" run winConfigure.pl 
but then at step 2 it looks like Unix users should have run libtoolize first, so step 1's reference to unix users should be removed. 
It's probably a problem of presentation. 
Point 2 is not the step after Point 1. 
We should define only one Point 1 with two options: Windows platforms, Unix platforms. 
Irene. 
are the openmotif/lesstif and GTK versions the "same" functionnaly speaking ? the question is about SVG support : from amaya web site it is unclear to me if -- or not -- svg support is better on openmotif version ? 
I've tried to install amaya with the openmotif flag however i rais to the GTK (default) ? 
Both version offer now the same support (including SVG edition support) Yes they are now. 
It was true before the release 6.2.

You and CBee are correct (thank u) -- in addition to the Lesstif rpm i had to install the lesstif-devel rpm, because that has the missing files. 
But after installing that rpm and re-running ../configure and make, I get the same missing file errors, from both configure and make. 
../configure returns "Motif includes were not found Amaya might not compile". 
So I re-ran ../configure with the --with-gtk option, but I then get the same errors from make: ../../thotlib/include/thot_gui.h:156:19: 
Xm/Xm.h: 
No such file or directory ../../thotlib/include/thot_gui.h:157:23: 
Xm/PushBG.h: 
No such file or directory until, that is, I deleted the Options file and re-ran ../configure. 
(Since I didn't touch that Options file, I didn't have any settings in there i didn't want overriden, so maybe configure should warn the user when it won't write new settings.) 
Now make worked and amaya runs. 
(Its warnings were mostly of type ../../thotlib/base/registry.c:1498:8: warning: extra tokens at end of #endif directive.) 
So i'm all set, thanks alot.

This is the list of directories where configure looks for Motif include files (Xm/*.h) 
/usr/lib/Motif1.2 \ /usr/Motif1.2/lib 
\ /sw/Lesstif/Motif2.0/lib 
\ /usr/motif/lib \ /usr/X11R6/lib \ /usr/X11R5/lib \ /usr/lib/X11R6 \ /usr/lib/X11R5 \ /usr/local/X11R6/lib \ /usr/local/X11R5/lib \ /usr/local/lib/X11R6 \ /usr/local/lib/X11R5 \ /usr/X11/lib \ /usr/lib/X11 \ /usr/local/X11/lib \ /usr/X386/lib \ /usr/x386/lib \ /usr/XFree86/lib/X11 \ /usr/lib \ /usr/local/lib \ /usr/unsupported/lib \ /usr/athena/lib \ /usr/local/x11r5/lib \ /usr/lpp/Xamples/lib \ /usr/lesstif/lib \ /usr/local/lesstif/lib\ /usr/gnu/lesstif/lib \ $HOME/lesstif/lib \ It seems that your include files are located in another place. 
You have to clean up the whole object directory to avoid confusion with the previous configure.

I just tried this with make clean (since object files, but keep the binaries in Amaya/obj /bin"). 
# make clean, however, leaves as is the LINUX-ELF/Options file (a file which, again, was auto'ly generated). 
A subsequent ../configure also leaves the Options file as is. 
Running # make all, therefore, still uses old options. 
So I had to delete the Options file to put a new ../configure -- options command into effect. 
fyi, george This time I installed Amaya 6.2 via rpm but in the future I may want to try the CVS version. 
Suggestions for next time?
