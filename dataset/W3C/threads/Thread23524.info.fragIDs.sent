<s> From returns of compareDocumentPosition: Returns how the given node is positioned relatively to this node (i.e., "the reference node").  </s>
<s> From constants: DOCUMENT_POSITION_FOLLOWING: The node follows the reference node.  </s>
<s> The first sentence would indicate that "this node" and "reference node" are synonyms.  </s>
<s> However, the second sentence expects "the node" to be distinct from "reference node".  </s>
<s> I'd recommend using "this node" (the node on which the method is invoked) and "other node" (the node passed as a parameter) and remove mentions of "given" and "reference" nodes in this context.  </s>

<s> DOCUMENT_POSITION_FOLLOWING: The other node follows this node.  </s>
<s> As an alternative to "other node", we could also consider "parameter node" or "node passed as a parameter"... a bit more verbose but avoids any question about the intent.  </s>
<s> (I'd almost be tempted to render "this" in boldface when we're using it as a keyword to signify the-node-which-is-performing-the-operation, but I don't think I can see the WG on that idea.)  </s>

<s> Couldn't the name of the parameter be used?  </s>
<s> This seems an easy way to keep the text both simple and clear.  </s>
<s> Ugh. It would have to be defined somewhere as well; not all languages prefer "this" as the name for the object on which the method is being called.  </s>
