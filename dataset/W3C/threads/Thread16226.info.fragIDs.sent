I recently set up JAWS on my machine at home, and it seems to have interfered with my homepage somehow. 
ie the background and foreground color settings have been changed. 
Could somone please confirm this and advise me how to reset.

Hello Jonathan: When I first installed JAWS on the machine I use at work to do web development, I think it changed some settings with regards to colors. 
I don't remember the specifics, but I think it reduced the number of colors available. 
I ended having to install it on a second computer that wasn't used for web design.

reset your browser colors. 
if you are using ie which it seems from your message that you are, jfw sets accessability options for maximum performance. 
to reset these items, go to tools, internet options, general tab and click accessability, uncheck "ignore specified colors on web pages". 
make sure when you are done, to press ok and press ok again at the general tab. 
this should drop you back to your page. 
reload the page and it should work normally. 
while in accessability options, be sure to re-enable or disable anything else that might block your code. 
I hope this is of help to all but beware of the danger with regard to jfw performance. 
to really test pages for jfw, you need someone who is experienced in it. 
I'd like to teach people how to use jaws for web interfacing. 
there are some documents that work towards this but I have discovered that when one of my roles is to work with people who do development or testing they learn a lot from my use of jfw. 
Kathleen is a shining example of how this can work.

The changes that JFW makes to Internet Explorer settings are no longer really necessary for performance of the screen reader. 
Since the company introduced a virtual cursor mode, I've found that I can leave all the IE settings in any fashion I want with no negative impact on JFW performance. 
I'm not entirely sure why the company still makes the adjustments they have.
