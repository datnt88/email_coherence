<s> Hello Jonathan: When I first installed JAWS on the machine I use at work to do web development, I think it changed some settings with regards to colors.  </s>
<s> I don't remember the specifics, but I think it reduced the number of colors available.  </s>
<s> I ended having to install it on a second computer that wasn't used for web design.  </s>

<s> reset your browser colors.  </s>
<s> if you are using ie which it seems from your message that you are, jfw sets accessability options for maximum performance.  </s>
<s> to reset these items, go to tools, internet options, general tab and click accessability, uncheck "ignore specified colors on web pages".  </s>
<s> make sure when you are done, to press ok and press ok again at the general tab.  </s>
<s> this should drop you back to your page.  </s>
<s> reload the page and it should work normally.  </s>
<s> while in accessability options, be sure to re-enable or disable anything else that might block your code.  </s>
<s> I hope this is of help to all but beware of the danger with regard to jfw performance.  </s>
<s> to really test pages for jfw, you need someone who is experienced in it.  </s>
<s> I'd like to teach people how to use jaws for web interfacing.  </s>
<s> there are some documents that work towards this but I have discovered that when one of my roles is to work with people who do development or testing they learn a lot from my use of jfw.  </s>
<s> Kathleen is a shining example of how this can work.  </s>

<s> The changes that JFW makes to Internet Explorer settings are no longer really necessary for performance of the screen reader.  </s>
<s> Since the company introduced a virtual cursor mode, I've found that I can leave all the IE settings in any fashion I want with no negative impact on JFW performance.  </s>
<s> I'm not entirely sure why the company still makes the adjustments they have.  </s>
