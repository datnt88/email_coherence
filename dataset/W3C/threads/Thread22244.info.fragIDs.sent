<s> Dear all As I've indicated in previous messages, I've anticipated sometime in January to be the date of release for the first version of the DOM Level 1 TS.  </s>
<s> I believe we can do this as soon as we resolve the issue of the HTML tests.  </s>
<s> What we need in order to do this, except for the issues I raised earlier about documentation, is: 1. Wait for NIST to tell us how long a transition of their submitted level 2 HTML tests to level 1 HTML tests would take 2. Wait for Netscape, whose representative managed to build the DOM TS after downloading an earlier version of Xalan, to indicate if they are willing to submit HTML tests.  </s>
<s> 3. Finally resolve the issue on Xalan; my setup consists of Ant 1.4 and Xalan 2.2.0, any developer release after that fails miserably.  </s>
<s> Can Curt, Mary and Rick please communicate to the list their particular setup so that we can document required software accordingly?  </s>
<s> As far as level 2 is concerned, I anticipate for us to be able to release it fairly quickly after the first Level 1 suite, since we will have learned and we will not have that steep a learning curve.  </s>
<s> I've indicated February/early March as a release date candidate.  </s>
<s> In addition, I hope to have some feedback from teh public once they see that we have a framework that is up and running.  </s>
<s> Level 3 is due to be released somewhere between Candidate and Proposed recommendation status of the level 3 specifications.  </s>
<s> Any thoughts?  </s>
<s> /Dimitris  </s>
<s> I have the following: Ant 1.4 Alpha xalan 2.1.0 --Mary  </s>
<s> I'm using XALAN 2.1.0 and ANT 1.4  </s>
