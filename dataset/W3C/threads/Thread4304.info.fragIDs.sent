<s> [82] 7.4.11 normalize-unicode: 'full normalization' needs a defition of the relevant constructs.  </s>

<s> Hello Ashok, Thanks for checking back with us.  </s>
<s> The Character Model contains various definitions of normalization.  </s>
<s> (http://www.w3.org/TR/charmod/#sec-TextNormalization).  </s>
<s> In particular, 'full normalization' is designed so that pieces of a format (for example, element content in XML) can easily be concatenated without creating normalization issues at the point of concatenation.  </s>
<s> As an example, in the 'u' and the combining grave accent (&amp;#x300;) would have to be normalized to a precombined "u with grave" when the content of the foo and bar elements are concatenated.  </s>
<s> So a) bar &amp;#x300; and some more text /bar is not fully normalized.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, b) bar and some more tex&amp;#x300;t /bar is fully normalized, because there is no "x with grave" precomposed character in Unicode, and "x&amp;#x300;" is the only way to denote an 'x' with a grave.  </s>
<s> But how do we distinguish between case a) and case b)?  </s>
<s> This distinction is made in the relevant format (e.g. XML 1.1), which defines the 'relevant constructs', in this case "element content".  </s>
<s> Relevant constructs cannot start e.g. with a combining grave character, but they can contain such a character internally, unless of course in a case such as a&amp;#x300;, where it would clearly not be in NFC.  </s>
<s> So XQuery should define the relevant constructs when it speaks about text normalization, the same way XML 1.1 defines the relevant constructs (see http://www.w3.org/TR/xml11/#sec2.13).  </s>
<s> My understanding is that in the case above, you are dealing with simple strings, so the only thing you need to say is that the relevant construct for the purpose of full normalization is the whole string.  </s>
<s> Hope this helps.  </s>
<s> Regards, Martin.  </s>
