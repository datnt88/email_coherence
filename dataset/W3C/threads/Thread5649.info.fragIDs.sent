<s> Yes, this is intended.  </s>
<s> The more-complex construction in OWL DL is strictly convenience, as there it can always be replaced by an intersection.  </s>
<s> However, in OWL Lite, this replacement is not always (easily) possible, leading to difficulties as to just what can be said in OWL Lite.  </s>
<s> Yes, this is as intended.  </s>
<s> The Value(_) construction augments the expressive power of the language and was not put in OWL Lite for this reason.  </s>
