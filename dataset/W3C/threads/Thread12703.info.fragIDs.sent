I cannot think of a guideline which is specific to Maths/Science. 
In so far as the content is conveyed by images, animations, markup languages, applets and complex language, i think the problem is already addressed. 
As I recall the teleconference it was resolved that we would attempt tobroaden some of the examples away from images and towards some of the other areas, such as equations of various kinds, which are important to groups who don't have a 'guideline just for them'. 
On the other hand, Historians are not represented very well either. 
I don't think the argument that visibility is important beats the argument that accurately reflecting the requirements for accessibility as concisely as possible is the best approach for these guidelines. 
Getting people to read the guidelines, and interpreting them for specific groups, seems to me primarily the responsibility of the Education and Outreach group, once the Guidelines group has given them the best possible material. 
It may be that the EO group requests the PAGL group to produce a specific interpretation for some group such as chemistry teachers, but that seems to be beyond the scope of the current PAGL group.

I think it should be considered for a guideline since: 1. 
The first people who may be required the guidelines are people in education and there is alot of math and science representations in education. 
2. I think math and science issues are just as important as "blinking" text and animations. 
3. Visibility is important. 
If people do not clearly see math or science issues being addressed in the guidelines document, most will probably not go looking for help in the techniques document.

I agree that it would become difficult to try to have specific items for every interest group. 
While science is maybe too specific for the current guidelines, I think at least the issue of math is broader and used by many groups. 
I think at least math should be considered for a guideline. 
The guidelines will be used extensively and I think we want people to get this item right for the previously stated reasons. 
If math is burried in the techniques document many people may not find the information they need to do math correctly. 
Jon P.S. By the way charles do you have a history degree?

I think we identified someplaces where a discussion of including Mathematical content could be included within the Guidelines document. 
I still don't see a Guideline which relates to Math. 
Maybe a Checkpoint.

There are two issues related to math in the guidelines. 
Issue 1: The specific recommendations on how to author mathematical representations. 
Issue 2: Where will the recommendations appear in the guidelines. 
Will there be a guideline (primary document) directly referencing math, or will math be mentioned only in the techniques document( examples of how to do things)? 
In the later approach the primary guidelines document would probably have no mention of math.

This thread is confusing me. 
Maybe it's just the semantics. 
I do not consider "math" to belong to any particular interest group. 
Even historians use math on occasion. 
Math and scientists use it more, but... My understanding of the latest conversation is that people writing "math" should use mathML. 
If they use images instead, they should reproduce the math as LaTeX. 
Am I correct here? 
I have no major problem with this recommendation. 
My only concern is that authors who don't know LaTeX (e.g. probably most historians) might just ignore the recommendation, but if the recommendation were broadened to permit words as a less desireable alternative, they might not ignore it.

I don't see any reason to single out "Math" and "Science" in the Guidelines. 
What particular accessibility issues do they raise? 
What distinguishes those subjects from Architecture or Philosophy or Art History? 
I could see adding a checkpoint to the guidelines that reads something like: "Where it's possible to mark up content (for example mathematical equations) instead of using images, use a markup language." 
Then, in the techniques document, one could talk about using MathML to mark up math content.
