<s> Here's something that has puzzled me about HTTP server implementations.  </s>
<s> What happens if the server encounters an error after it sends, say, a "200 OK" response and part of the entity body?  </s>
<s> Example cases include an origin server that gets a timeout from a CGI part way through relaying the CGI's output, or when a proxy acts as a pure relay and, for example, its connection to the next hop server (is that upstream or downstream?  </s>
<s> :-) breaks.  </s>
<s> The server has no way to signal to its client that the previously claimed success has now turned into an error.  </s>
<s> Dave Kristol  </s>
<s> One could always invent a 1xx response which says "This current response just went south." Yaron  </s>
<s> No, then it's too late.  </s>
<s> Because the server has already sent the response headers, the client would be looking for the entity body, not headers.  </s>
<s> My whole point was that, once the server began sending the entity body, there's no way for it to inform the client, "Whoops, things have gone bad." Dave Kristol  </s>

<s> First of all, note that RFC2068 requires that (section 14.14) It must be possible for the recipient to reliably determine the end of HTTP/1.1 requests containing an entity-body, e.g., because the request has a valid Content-Length field, uses Transfer-Encoding: chunked or a multipart body.  </s>

<s> would assume that if the server runs into an error, it can terminate  </s>
<s> the TCP connection before sending the specified number of bytes; the recipient should pay attention to the discrepancy.  </s>
<s> In fact, section 13.8 says: A cache that receives an incomplete response (for example, with fewer bytes of data than specified in a Content-Length header) may store the response.  </s>
<s> However, the cache MUST treat this as a partial response.  </s>
<s> Partial responses may be combined as described in section 13.5.4; the result might be a full response or might still be partial.  </s>
<s> A cache MUST NOT return a partial response to a client without explicitly marking it as such, using the 206 (Partial Content) status code.  </s>
<s> A cache MUST NOT return a partial response using a status code of 200 (OK).  </s>
<s> I.e., the current specification seems to cover the case where a Content-Length doesn't match the number of bytes sent.  </s>
<s> I'm not sure that RFC2068 has similar language for non-caching clients, but it would seem reasonable to implement the same kind of sanity checking.  </s>
<s> (In passing, I note that at least one of the existing browser caches that I have used does not do so!)  </s>
<s> In the case of a server sending a chunked response intending to put the content-length in the footer (which is allowed by section 3.6 of RFC2068 (Transfer Codings)), it seems reasonable  </s>
<s> that the server could signal an error by sending a completely bogus Content-length.  </s>
<s> E.g., if you have sent 4096 content bytes before recognizing the error, send a chunk footer with Content-length: 1000000000000 and the recipient should know that something is wrong.  </s>
<s> In some cases, the server might have to pad the chunk past the point where the error occurred.  </s>
<s> I would imagine that in some server implementations, it's hard to tell that a sub-process (e.g., CGI script) screwed up.  </s>
<s> But in a UNIX-based server, if the CGI process exits with an error status, then the server should presumably find some way of sending a bogus length value before closing the connection.  </s>
<s> I doubt this is possible in all cases, but we can't specify sloppy programming out of existence.  </s>
<s> -Jeff  </s>
<s> "Henry Sanders (Exchange)" henrysa@EXCHANGE.MICROSOFT.com  </s>
<s> pointed this out to me:  </s>
<s> Umm, where do you see this in section 3.6?  </s>
<s> I read it as saying that you're only allowed to send entity header fields in the footer which are explicitly defined as appropriate, as I don't see any wording anywhere explicitly defining Content-Length: as appropriate.  </s>
<s> I know our server doesn't check for Content-Length: in the footer, and I don't think our client will either.  </s>
<s> I may have misread this section.  </s>
<s> But, it says: The chunked encoding is ended by a zero-sized chunk followed by the footer, which is terminated by an empty line.  </s>
<s> The purpose of the footer is to provide an efficient way to supply information about an entity that is generated dynamically; applications MUST NOT send header fields in the footer which are not explicitly defined as being appropriate for the footer, such as Content-MD5 or future extensions to HTTP for digital signatures or other facilities.  </s>
<s> Content-length is definitely an entity-header (see section 7.1), and I think it is clearly "information about an entity that is generated dynamically" (although whether "that is generated dynamically" refers to the "entity" or the "information" is ambiguous).  </s>
<s> What's interesting is that there seem to be NO fields in RFC2068 that are "explicitly defined as being appropriate for the footer", including Content-MD5.  </s>
<s> I searched the document for the word "footer", and (besides section 3.6) it appears in only one other section (8.2).  </s>
<s> There is no mention at all in the section on Content-MD5 (section 14.16).  </s>
<s> Does your server or client actually have a list of headers that it *does* allow in the footer?  </s>
<s> Where did this list come from?  </s>
<s> I think we have some document-editing to do.  </s>
<s> Either we have to remove the "MUST NOT" from section 3.6, or remove the example of Content-MD5, or add a list of "explicitly allowed in the footer" headers.  </s>
<s> Anyway, it seems quite reasonable to allow Content-Length to appear in a footer.  </s>
<s> And it seems to solve the "midcourse correction" problem, in most cases.  </s>
<s> -Jeff  </s>
<s> I looked at the wording in 3.6, which, after translating double negatives, says that applications can only send header fields in the footer if the header field is explicitly allowed for that purpose.  </s>
<s> I probably didn't look in the right place for it, but I saw no such words in 14.16 Content-MD5 (mentioned in 3.6), though I'm sure the intent was there to use it that way.  </s>
<s> However, I seem to recall discussions about Content-Length as a chunked footer, and I seem to recall it was considered a bad idea.  </s>
<s> Presumably if it  </s>
<s> were present, it should be ignored, since the chunking overrides it.  </s>
<s> That's a long-winded way of saying I don't think your idea will work to signal a failure in the chunked case.  </s>
<s> Dave Kristol  </s>
<s> Around the time of the LA IETF there was some desire to remove footers entirely from chunked T-E.  </s>
<s> Phill Hallam objected strongly to this, and a compromise was reached where Content-MD5 was allowed in the footer for 1.1 and future versions of HTTP might allow other headers.  </s>
<s> The issue was considered closed for draft 04 in The wording has changed a bit since then (I vaguely remember that happening as an editorial change) , but I believe the intent is still the same, which is that only Content-MD5 is valid in an HTTP 1.1 chunked footer.  </s>

<s> I'll bug Jim Gettys to add that.  </s>

<s> I seem to recall discussions about Content-Length as a chunked footer, and I seem to recall it was considered a bad idea.  </s>
<s> But if the consensus is that Content-Length doesn't belong in the footer, then perhaps we need to define a new "footer-eligible" header that serves purpose that we are looking for: "Stop this response, I didn't mean it when I said '200' back in the header".  </s>
<s> E.g., a new header called "Failed:" which can convey an updated status code and message.  </s>

<s> Well, independant of whether Content-Length belongs in the footer, I was uncomfortable with the side-effect usage proposed earlier.  </s>

<s> With appropriate status codes (appropriate to be defined), a replacement response would immediately follow and might be a full error response with optional content.  </s>

<s> Our present implementation just closes the connection without sending the terminating (zero-length) chunk.  </s>
<s> Browsers all seem to display some sort of error when you cut off a response in the middle if you've passed Content-Length in the header; we assume that they would do the same for this case.  </s>

<s> Actually, those words were mine.  </s>
<s> That's different.  </s>
<s> A proxy can collect the entire chunked response and, once successful, can add a Content-Length header in the message headers (and eliminate chunking).  </s>
<s> If there's a Content-Length as a footer, then we have to decide what to do if that length disagrees with the entity body length gathered through chunking.  </s>
<s> Jeff Moguls's solution, "consider the response to be broken", is one choice.  </s>

<s> Browsers all seem to display some sort of error when you cut off a response in the middle if you've passed Content-Length in the header; we assume that they would do the same for this case.  </s>
<s> This makes sense as long as the content that *is* received is non-corrupt.  </s>
<s> I guess the worrisome case is if the failing content-generation mechanism generates bogus content, not just truncated content.  </s>
<s> The browsers I've used, when they see a premature close for a non-chunked response, display the data received so far, and a "Transfer Interrupted!" warning.  </s>
<s> This doesn't necessarily warn the user "and by the way, what you already have on your screen might be bogus".  </s>
<s> But this is probably just "advice to client implementors", not something we need to put into the spec.  </s>
<s> (And I've seldom seen any content-generator realize when it has generated bogus data, although I have certainly seen enough cases where the output was clearly broken.)  </s>
<s> -Jeff  </s>
<s> Probably because if the server/application cares enough to know the data might be bogus, it has made provisions to purge the partial output and start over.  </s>
<s> If you've been busy generating HTML and forwarding it to a client and discover some kind of error condition, it is really tough in the general case to generate additional HTML which one can be sure will be seen by the user in a meaningful way.  </s>
<s> (For example, if one is in the middle of generating a table but the error routine doesn't close the table, the browser may not display the error message, etc.) My latest project takes the effort to queue all output until the response is complete.  </s>
<s> If an intermediate failure is detected.  </s>
<s> the queued output is purged and an error response generated.  </s>
<s> Dave Morris  </s>
<s> The only useful thing a server could say at that point is the equivalent of 500 Internal Server Error, which is no better than just cutting-off transmission of the message and closing the connection.  </s>
<s> If the message is properly delimited, the client should be capable of seeing that something is missing and act appropriately.  </s>
<s> A multiplexing HTTP should be capable of terminating a "thread" early without harming the rest of the connection, so I think trying to get HTTP/1.x to handle it would be a mistake.  </s>
