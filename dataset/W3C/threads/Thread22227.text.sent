We've acquired some steam woth keeping up, so once we've released the Level 1 TS for core, we should start working with HTML. 
There's been two major options brought to the list so far: 1. Convert as many as possible of the existing NIST level 2 tests to level 1 HTML 2. Convert some of Netscape's HTML tests to our markup How long would this take? 
Also, since both are open options, it seems a good idea to try to minimize duplication by stating what tests would be relevant and within what time frame. 
Best, /Dimitris With respect to the NIST tests, there are two issues: 1) DOM Level 1 HTML -- these tests are pretty much the equivalent of the DOM Level 2 HTML tests - 90% of which just require pointing to the Level 1 DTD -- there are a few tweaks necessary for level 2, but not too much -- minimal effort to convert ~ 1 week. 
2) DOM Level 1 Core (HTML only implementations) -- much more difficult, as the Level 1 XML tests would have to be converted -- these tests currently load an xml file and manipulate the file via dom calls. 
In order to convert, the xml file must be converted to an html file, and each of the tests would have to be changed. 
Most of the tests start with a getElementsByTagName call - these would have to be changed to be consistent with the HTML version of this file. 
Other tests try to get attributes from various element names -- I'm not sure the best way to represent this in HTML. 
So essentially the logic of these tests can be reused, but probably all of them will have to be recoded. 
--Mary Hi, As Mary said there is no difference between level2 html and level1 html testcases, all the testcases in level2 can be applied to level1 with out changes Thanks Siva Hi, We are expecting to post around 100 level 1 HTML testcases by 15th of March. 
The coverage in Level2 HTML and Level1 HTML are more or less the same. 
Thanks Siva Hi Siva, Thanks for the update. 
Are these level 1 HTML testscases for the HTML Module or are they HTML cases for Core?

of the within Hi Mary, They are the testcases for DOM HTML not Core Siva Hi Siva Thanks, sounds good. 
If you ned any help in the meanwhile, just send an email to the list. 
Also, check with the list for the most appropriate form to submit the tests to the CVS (you could either send them in zipped form to the submission list and have one of the moderators submit them for you if all are ready at once, or submit them yourselves which would mean we have to create an extra account. 
Logistics..) /Dimitris Hi Siva Thanks, sounds good.

Regarding submitting of the testcases. 
Thanks Siva
