Is there a good resource that tracks state regulations and university policies on accessibility and ADA compliance? 
I'm putting together some resources for our product strategy team, and need some specific information to convince them to move accessibility closer to the top of the priority list. 
Best case scenario: is there a central repository of accessibility requirements by state or by university?

Blackboard builds online teaching and learning platforms for schools, corporations, and other clients. 
What exactly does this mean? 
One of our product lines is an web application designed to help teachers place their courses online and to interact with their students over the internet. 
Since this is a complete teaching and learning environment, we're very concerned about making it accessible. 
I'm interested in the state and university regulations pertaining to online educational resources, because we want to make certain that we are meeting the needs of the educational community. 
We're trying to position ourselves ahead of the curve on accessibility, and to do that we need to know both current regulations and anticipated future requirements. 
In addition to current recommendations, requirements, and regulations, I'm also very interested in feedback from teachers, web/technology coordinators, and other members of the educational community.
