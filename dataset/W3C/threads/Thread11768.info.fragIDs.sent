<s> Any reason why we don't use the model of guideline, checkpoint, technique used in PA ?  </s>
<s> 2.1 Generate standard markup [Priority 1] The first step towards accessibility is interoperability.  </s>
<s> Authoring tools should ensure that content is created in accordance with W3C specifications  </s>
<s> checkpoint/technique: validate with validator.w3.org, css validator.  </s>
<s> checkpoint: list them all: HTML, CSS, MathML, XML, SMIL, PICS, etc  </s>
<s> (or other standards when applicable).  </s>
<s> What do we have in mind here ?  </s>
<s> Java, EcmaScript, VRML, Shockwave ?  </s>
<s> Since we don't have PA for these, what are we going to say ?  </s>
<s> We could say, refer to their own accessibility guidelines, and if there is none, say just don't use ?  </s>
<s> Mechanisms that can be employed by authoring tools to support accessible authoring practices are discussed in Section 5.  </s>
<s> Pointer to Section 5 looks broken.  </s>
<s> 2.3 Emphasize accessible authoring practices [Priority 1]  </s>
<s> (in addition to my earlier message about overall structure of section 2) I wonder in which way this isn't a superset of "2.2 Support all accessible content recommendations."  </s>
<s> If one needs to emphasize, one needs to support.  </s>
<s> [Technique: 2.5.1] [Priority 1] The author must be prompted, on a configurable schedule, to provide "alt"-text for images, image maps, and image map links.  </s>
<s> [Technique: 2.5.2] [Priority 1] The authoring tool must never insert rule-generated description text into the document (default "alt"-text) or a properties field (place-holder "alt"-text).  </s>
<s> Automated processes may place pre-authored (by a person) text when the meaning or function of the described object is known with certainty.  </s>
<s> [Technique: 2.5.3] [Priority 1] The author must be prompted to provide captioning or transcriptions for any video or audio segments.  </s>
<s> [Technique: 2.5.4] [Priority 3] The author should be given the option of providing a long description for any graphic element.  </s>
<s> To give water to my argument for why a 2.5 is not needed, these technique are applicable to native editing as well, not just conversion time.  </s>
<s> 2.7 Package multimedia files with pre-written descriptions [Priority 2] Techniques:  </s>
<s> I'd add "remembering description of the same image/sounds/etc", under pre-written (already written once, by the author)  </s>
<s> [Technique: 2.8.1] [Priority 1] Allow the author to display the site map in text form (e.g., as a structured tree file).  </s>
<s> If it's to "publish" the site map, then it should be included in other guideline, if it's for accessibility of the environment, then it should be mentioned there (I think it is already)  </s>
<s> [Technique: 2.12.2] [Priority 1] Authoring tools must never remove or modify structure or content that is necessary for continued accessibility.  </s>
<s> We need to talk about the issue of a tool wanting to generate HTML valid for the HTML 3.2 spec, and therefore needing to remove longdesc, table stuff, etc, on the ground that they are only in HTML 4. Maybe we should say that HTML 4 stuff should never be removed and that's it's a fallacy to want to be compliant with older HTML releases.  </s>
<s> 3.1 Ensure that users may configure accessibility mechanisms [Priority 1] In supporting the creation of accessible Web content, authoring tools must take into account the differing authoring styles of their users.  </s>
<s> Some users may prefer to be alerted to problems when they occur, whereas others may prefer to perform a check after the document is completed.  </s>
<s> This is analogous to programming environments that allow users to decide whether to check for correct code during editing or at compile time.  </s>
<s> This is not about an accessible environment, is it ?  </s>
<s> This is usability and it needs to be good so that things in section 2 are adopted.  </s>
<s> 3.2 Integrate accessibility solutions naturally [Priority 2]  </s>
<s> same thing  </s>
<s> 3.3 Provide optional views of the edited document When creating or editing a Web page the desired ultimate rendering of the page may not be optimal for creating and editing.  </s>
<s> Techniques: [Technique: 3.3.1]  </s>
<s> [Priority 1] The authoring tools should support at least two views: 1. an authoring/editing view 2. a publishing or browser view, (similar to the normal and page view or print preview of popular word processors).  </s>
<s> same thing, in fact, this is a P2 in section 2 in the area of checking accessibility.  </s>
<s> [Technique: 3.3.2]  </s>
<s> [Priority 1] In the authoring/editing view, the font size, letter and line spacing, and text and background color should be independent of the final format of the document.  </s>
<s> this one is really about accessibility of the environment.  </s>
<s> 3.4 Offer text representations of elements Graphically represented elements cannot be identified by third-party assistive technologies that translate text to Braille, speech, or large print.  </s>
<s> Some authoring tools display the start and end tags as graphics.  </s>
<s> Techniques: [Technique: 3.4.1]  </s>
<s> [Priority 1] Allow the author to display tags in a text format.  </s>

<s> Overall, since the bulk of accessibility of the environment will be somewhere else, I still think this should be an annex in this document.  </s>
<s> I think in this restructuring we inappropriately catagorized guidelines that refer to either: 1. making the authoring tool interface accessible to authors with disabilities or 2. Making sure that the authoring tool produces accessible web sites.  </s>
<s> 2.8 refers to guidelines to make the tool accessible for authors with disabilities not to making the site accessible and is in the wrong place 3.1 and 3.2 do not refer to accomodating authors with disabilities, but to encouraging all authors to use the access prompting and support in the tool and therefore belong in section 4. I agree with Daniel that we can probably merge a number of guidelines.  </s>
<s> Jutta  </s>
<s> Actually 2.8 can be read both ways.  </s>
<s> Site-management tools frequently provide a site map to the author, and publish one as part of the site.  </s>
<s> In the first case it is section 2, and in the second it is section 3. But I agree that this may not warrant a whole guideline to itself.  </s>

<s> Here are a few comments on the latest draft.  </s>
<s> - Ian GENERAL COMMENTS - Table of Contents I don't think the priorities should be listed in the TOC.  </s>
<s> Perhaps they will "disappear" if it turns out that the guidelines aren't prioritized (now the case with the Page Author and User Agent guidelines) - "Techniques" in the guidelines document should be replaced by "checkpoints" (the change was intended for Jutta in fact!). - All checkpoints should be expressed using the same grammatic form (whatever that is).  </s>
<s> For instance, if the imperative voice is chosen, they should all start with "Ensure" or "Allow" or "Implement" or whatever.  </s>
<s> Today, the language used to express the checkpoints varies greatly from checkpoint to checkpoint - Checkpoints should not contain rationales.  </s>
<s> Thus, for instance, for 2.10.1, the rationale part: "In order to ensure that documents are made accessible according to the WAI Page Author Guidelines" should be stated elsewhere, for example, before the checkpoints in section 2.10.  </s>
<s> Checkpoint 2.10.1 should be reduced to: "Include an automated tool that identifies and helps correct accessibility problems" - Some of the checkpoints contain "too much information" and should be broken down into several checkpoints.  </s>
<s> As an editor, I can understand the urge to combine similar checkpoints.  </s>
<s> However, the UA WG has expressly asked for simpler statements that may be checked individually rather than compound checkpoints.  </s>
<s> - Like the other guidelines, this document needs an introduction that explains how the guidelines are to be used.  </s>
<s> I hope to write an introduction (soon) that may be used with few modifications in all three guidelines.  </s>
<s> - I think many of the Priority 1's are too strong for the content of the checkpoints.  </s>
<s> SPECIFIC COMMENTS  </s>
<s> 2) Ensure that content produced by the tool is accessible - In the first guiding principle, change "to free authors to" to "so that authors may" - Rewrite the second guiding principle as follows:  </s>
<s> "Once accessibility is integrated into authoring tools, authors will be much more likely to produce accessible documents."  </s>
<s> 2.1) In the first sentence, change "Authoring tools should" to "Authoring tools must" since this is a Priority 1. 2.2) Support all accessible content recommendations.  </s>
<s> While the title speaks of "content", the prose in the section speaks of "markup".  </s>
<s> Choose one, probably "content" since images might be involved.  </s>
<s> - Checkpoint 2.3.1 : The text is too vague.  </s>
<s> What does "most accessible mean"?  </s>
<s> Perhaps this should be a guideline.  </s>
<s> - Checkpoint 2.3.2 : What does "user input is ambiguous" mean?.  </s>
<s> This text is also so vague that I think it's more of a guideline or introductory prose 2.4) "Note. the therm checking below does not necessarily ...." This note is out of context since we don't know yet know enough about the difference is between checking and alerting.  </s>
<s> - Checkpoint 2.5.2 : Too much info in this technique.  </s>
<s> Break it up.  </s>
<s> - Checkpoint 2.5.3: Separate into two: one for video, one for audio.  </s>
<s> - Checkpoint 2.6.1:  </s>
<s> Too much info.  </s>
<s> Break it up.  </s>
<s> The last sentence belongs in the (future) techniques document.  </s>
<s> - Checkpoint 2.6.2:  </s>
<s> This is not a checkpoint but a real technique that belongs in the techniques document.  </s>
<s> - Checkpoint 2.6.3: Same as 2.6.2 - Checkpoint 2.7.1: Lots of rationale text that belongs in the paragraph before the checkpoints.  </s>
<s> - Checkpoint 2.7.3:  </s>
<s> First part is rationale: "Increate user acceptance of pre-written ..." This should not be in the checkpoint.  </s>
<s> - Checkpoint 2.10.1:  </s>
<s> The first part of the sentence is rationale and should be moved.  </s>
<s> Reduce this to "Include an automated tool that identifies and helps correct accessibility problems."  </s>
<s> Note that "identify" and "help correct" are very different issues and this and similar checkpoints should be divided accordingly.  </s>
<s> - Checkpoint 2.10.2:  </s>
<s> Change "The correcting tool must be designed in such a way that authors can correct" to "Allow authors to correct" - Checkpoint 2.11.2:  </s>
<s> Delete.  </s>
<s> This one amounts to "Authoring tools must produce accessible markup" which is the point of the guidelines.  </s>
<s> I don't think talking about "algorithms" changes anything (and is only about implementation).  </s>
<s> - Checkpoint 3.2.1:  </s>
<s> Move the rationale elsewhere - Checkpoint 3.2.2:  </s>
<s> Change the wording to use the imperative voice.  </s>
<s> - Checkpoint 3.4.2:  </s>
<s> This is not a checkpoint but a technique that is one good idea related to 3.4.1.  </s>
<s> This belongs in the techniques document.  </s>
<s> - Checkpoint 4.1.2:  </s>
<s> Too much rationale.  </s>
<s> Move elsewhere.  </s>
<s> Rephrase the technique as "Emphasize universal design principles in help text."  </s>
<s> Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)  </s>
<s> I propose that we change the order of sections 2, 3, 4 to the following: 2. Ensure that content produced by the authoring tool is accessible 3. Encourage authors to create accessible documents 4. Ensure that the authoring tool is accessible to authors with disabilities The first two sections logically follow each other.  </s>
<s> We should then also fix  </s>
<s> the categorization of the various guidelines as discussed here on the list.  </s>
<s> Jutta  </s>
<s> They not only follow each other, they fit with each other: in fact, 3 is under 2, somehow.  </s>
<s> I still prefer 2 sections: generate accessible document, have an accessible interface.  </s>
<s> The new organization and merging proposed would result in a document core that looks like this: 2 Ensure that content produced by the authoring tool is accessible Guiding Principle: The authoring tool user interface can be used to guide and encourage the author to create accessible web content.  </s>
<s> Guiding Principle: The power of automation should be utilized so that authors may concentrate on description writing and other higher-level aspects of Web accessibility.  </s>
<s> 2.1 Generate standard markup [PRIORITY 1] The first step towards accessibility is interoperability.  </s>
<s> Authoring tools must ensure that content is created in accordance with W3C specifications (or other standards when applicable).  </s>
<s> 2.2 Support all accessible content recommendations [PRIORITY 1] Methods for ensuring accessible content vary with different markup languages.  </s>
<s> An authoring tool must support all accessibility features that have been defined for the markup language(s) supported by the tool.  </s>
<s> Listing the accessibility features of specific languages lies beyond the scope of this document.  </s>
<s> However, an informative list of documents that address accessible Web authoring practices follows.  </s>
<s> Page Author Accessibility Features: (The actual accessible markup solutions) General: WAI Page Authoring Guidelines: Techniques HTML4: HTML4 Accessibility Improvements CSS2: CSS2 Accessibility Improvements SMIL, MathML Page Author Implementation Priorities: (The priorities placed on the accessibility markup solutions) General: WAI Page Author Guidelines Mechanisms that can be employed by authoring tools to support accessible authoring practices are discussed in Section 5. 2.3 Identify all inaccessible markup [PRIORITY 1] Many authoring tools allow their users to create documents with little or no knowledge about the underlying markup.  </s>
<s> To ensure accessibility, authoring tools must be designed so that they may automatically identify inaccessible content, even when the markup itself is hidden from the author.  </s>
<s> Checkpoints: [Checkpoint: 2.3.1]  </s>
<s> [PRIORITY 1] Existing documents are checked when they are opened for editing.  </s>
<s> [Checkpoint: 2.3.2]  </s>
<s> [PRIORITY 1] Documents are checked during all types of editing, including hand-coding, paste operations, and code insertions.  </s>
<s> [Checkpoint: 2.3.3]  </s>
<s> [PRIORITY 1] When problems are detected, the author should be alerted according to a user-configurable schedule.  </s>
<s> See the section on ensuring that users may configure accessibility mechanisms and Alert Techniques.  </s>
<s> [Checkpoint: 2.3.4]  </s>
<s> [PRIORITY 1] Correcting tools are designed so that authors can correct accessibility problems without necessarily understanding the underlying structure of the language or the details of markup accessibility.  </s>
<s> 2.4 Ensure that all markup inserted by the authoring tool is accessible [PRIORITY 1] If markup is automatically generated, the author will be unaware of the accessibility status of the final product unless they expend extra effort to make appropriate corrections by hand.  </s>
<s> Since most authors are unfamiliar with accessibility, these problems are likely to remain.  </s>
<s> Checkpoints: [Checkpoint: 2.4.1] [PRIORITY 1] Automated markup insertion functions make use of appropriate accessible solutions, even if this means presenting the author with extra prompts for necessary information or structure during or following the process.  </s>
<s> 2.5 Integrate accessibility solutions into relevant automated tools and wizards [PRIORITY 1] Accessibility issues often arise in complex markup tasks.  </s>
<s> Many authoring tools provide automated tools or wizards to guide authors in creating the relatively complex syntax needed to insert items such as objects, tables, or frames.  </s>
<s> Checkpoints: [Checkpoint: 2.6.1] [PRIORITY 1] All automated tasks for which there are page author accessibility guidelines include the required relevant accessibility solutions.  </s>
<s> 2.6 Provide mechanisms for managing alternative content [PRIORITY 1] Alternative content, including "alt"-text, long descriptions, video captions, and transcripts are absolutely necessary for the accessibility of all images, applets, video, and audio files.  </s>
<s> However, the task of writing these descriptions is probably the most time-consuming accessibility recommendation made to the author.  </s>
<s> This is especially true in the case of conversion tools that can quickly produce large amounts of content that is lacking alternative representation.  </s>
<s> To reduce the demands on authors, automated tools for managing alternatice content should be included.  </s>
<s> Checkpoints: [Checkpoint: 2.7.1a] [PRIORITY 1] The author is prompted, on a configurable schedule, to provide "alt"-text for images, image maps, and image map links.  </s>
<s> [Checkpoint: 2.7.1b] [PRIORITY 1] The author is prompted, on a configurable schedule, to provide captioning or transcriptions for any video segments.  </s>
<s> [Checkpoint: 2.7.1c] [PRIORITY 1] The author is prompted, on a configurable schedule, to provider transcriptions for any audio segments.  </s>
<s> [Checkpoint: 2.7.1d] [PRIORITY 3] The author is given the option of providing a long description for any graphic element.  </s>
<s> [Checkpoint: 2.7.2a] [PRIORITY 1] The authoring tool never inserts rule-generated description text into the document (default "alt"-text) or a properties field (place-holder "alt"-text).  </s>
<s> [Checkpoint: 2.7.2b] [PRIORITY 1] Automated processes store and suggest pre-authored text that has previously been associated with an object by the author or content developer.  </s>
<s> This may only occur when the meaning or function of the described object is known with certainty.  </s>
<s> Techniques: [Technique: 2.7.1] Professionally written descriptions should be included for all multimedia files packaged with the authoring tool (e.g. clip art) so that: 1.users will be saved time and effort 2.a significant number of professionally written descriptions will begin to circulate 3.users will be provided with convenient models to emulate when they write their own descriptions 4.users will see evidence of the importance of description writing [Technique: 2.7.2]  </s>
<s> The authoring tool should make use of the pre-written descriptions by suggesting them as default text whenever one of the associated files is inserted into the author's document.  </s>
<s> [Technique: 2.7.3] Increase user acceptance of pre-written descriptions by allowing authors to make keyword searches of the description database, thus simplifying the task of finding relevant images.  </s>
<s> 2.7 Ensure that conversion tools produce and retain accessible markup and content [PRIORITY 1] Many applications feature the ability to convert documents from other formats (e.g., Rich Text Format) or proprietary formats into a markup format, such as HTML.  </s>
<s> Markup changes may also be made to facilitate efficient editing and manipulation.  </s>
<s> These processes are usually hidden from the user's view and may create inaccessible content or cause inaccessible content to be produced.  </s>
<s> Checkpoints: [Checkpoint: 2.8.1] [PRIORITY 1] Conversion utilities generate documents that respect the WAI Page Author Guidelines.  </s>
<s> [Checkpoint: 2.8.2] [PRIORITY 1] Authoring tools never remove or modify structure or content that is necessary for continued accessibility.  </s>
<s> [Checkpoint: 2.8.3] [PRIORITY 1] The authors is provided with the option of a receiving a summary of all automated structural changes that may affect accessibility.  </s>
<s> 3 Encourage Authors to Create Accessible Documents Guiding Principle: Help files, justifications and examples are critical if authors are to become more aware of and implement Web accessibility principles.  </s>
<s> Guiding Principle: Once accessibility is integrated into authoring tools, authors will be much more likely to produce accessible documents.  </s>
<s> 3.1 Emphasize accessible authoring practices [PRIORITY 1] Recommended accessible authoring practices (and their priorities) must be taken into account during the design of relevant user interface components and program functionality.  </s>
<s> Checkpoints: [Checkpoint: 3.1.1]  </s>
<s> [PRIORITY 1] All authoring practices discouraged by [Page-Author-Priority 1] are not recommended or otherwise encouraged by the authoring tool.  </s>
<s> [Checkpoint: 3.1.2]  </s>
<s> [PRIORITY 1] The most accessible authoring practices are the most visible and easily initiated by the author.  </s>
<s> [Checkpoint: 3.1.3]  </s>
<s> [PRIORITY 1] When predicting author behaviour, the goal of maintaining content accessibility is assumed.  </s>
<s> 3.2 Provide comprehensive accessibility help to authors [PRIORITY 1] The issues surrounding Web accessibility are often unknown to Web authors.  </s>
<s> Providing convenient links to clear and concisely written help files will contribute to author acceptance of, and education about, markup accessibility.  </s>
<s> Checkpoints: [Checkpoint: 2.5.1] [PRIORITY 1] Context sensitive help is implemented for all special accessibility terms, as well as tasks related to accessibility.  </s>
<s> Techniques: [Technique: 2.5.1] [PRIORITY 1] Mechanisms used to identify accessibility problems such as icons, outlining or other emphasis within the user interface should be linked to help files.  </s>
<s> [Technique: 2.5.2] [PRIORITY 1] The accessibility help files should explain the accessibility problem or accessibility feature quickly, with emphasis placed on the solutions available rather than placing emphasis on elements that have been incorrectly marked up.  </s>
<s> [Technique: 2.5.3] [PRIORITY 1] The help files include many examples.  </s>
<s> [Technique: 2.5.4] [PRIORITY 1] The help files include links to any automated correction utilities.  </s>
<s> 3.2 Provide rationales that stress Universal Design [PRIORITY 1] Most users are unfamiliar with accessibility issues on the Web.  </s>
<s> By incorporating explanations of Universal Design benefits into authoring tools, authors will better understand the value of accessible page design.  </s>
<s> The Universal Design principle of flexible display and control choices are critical for: hands free, eyes-free, voice-activated browsing devices such as Web phones the large number of slow Web connections (not everyone has a fiber connection) Web users who prefer text-only browsing to avoid "image clutter" the aging population (with the accompanying decrease in visual, hearing, motor, and cognitive abilities) the relatively high Web presence of people with sensory and motor disabilities.  </s>
<s> Checkpoints: [Checkpoint: 3.2.1] [PRIORITY 1] The help system explains the importance of utilizing accessibility features generally and for specific instances.  </s>
<s> [Checkpoint: 3.2.2] [PRIORITY 1] Explanations emphasize accessibility benefits for multiple groups.  </s>
<s> Techniques: For more information on Universal Design, visit the Trace Center.  </s>
<s> 3.3 Promote accessibility in all Help examples [PRIORITY 3] In addition to a help section dedicated to accessibility, accessibility principles should be followed for all applicable markup examples in the rest of the help system.  </s>
<s> This will increase integration and help show authors that accessibility is a normal part of authoring, rather than a separate concern.  </s>
<s> Checkpoints: [Checkpoint: 3.3.1]  </s>
<s> [PRIORITY 3] Help files for markup practices that require accessible solutions appear with those solutions.  </s>
<s> (ex.  </s>
<s> IMG elements should appear with "alt"-text) [Checkpoint: 3.3.2]  </s>
<s> [PRIORITY 3] Help files include lower priority accessibility solutions.  </s>
<s> 3.4 Ensure that users may configure accessibility mechanisms [PRIORITY 1] In supporting the creation of accessible Web content, authoring tools must take into account the differing authoring styles of their users.  </s>
<s> Some users may prefer to be alerted to problems when they occur, whereas others may prefer to perform a check after the document is completed.  </s>
<s> This is analogous to programming environments that allow users to decide whether to check for correct code during editing or at compile time.  </s>
<s> Checkpoints: [Checkpoint: 3.4.1]  </s>
<s> [PRIORITY 1] The tools is designed so that users can indicate their preferences regarding both the nature and timing of accessibility alerts.  </s>
<s> [Checkpoint: 3.4.2]  </s>
<s> [PRIORITY 1] The priority level given to accessibility recommendations for a given language is taken into account when determining the level of user control.  </s>
<s> Specifically, the user has the option of determining the extent of alerts for [Page-Author-Priority 2] and [Page-Author-Priority 3] recommendation items.  </s>
<s> [Checkpoint: 3.4.3]  </s>
<s> [PRIORITY 1] Users are prevented from disabling the lowest-level of non-intrusive alerts for [Page-Author-Priority 1] items.  </s>
<s> 3.5 Integrate accessibility solutions naturally [PRIORITY 2] When a new feature is added to an existing software tool without proper integration, the result is often an obvious discontinuity.  </s>
<s> Differing color schemes, fonts, interaction styles and even application stability can be factors affecting user acceptance of the new feature.  </s>
<s> Checkpoints: [Checkpoint: 3.5.1]  </s>
<s> [PRIORITY 2] All functionality associated with accessibility is properly integrated into the overall "look and feel" of the authoring tool.  </s>
<s> [Checkpoint: 3.5.2]  </s>
<s> [PRIORITY 2] Accessibility features never interfere with any of the expected operations of an author's editing environment.  </s>
<s> For example, fundamental operations such as saving, closing, and pasting should not be canceled or postponed due to the existence of accessibility problems.  </s>
<s> 3.6 Provide the author with progress feedback [PRIORITY 3] Achieving accessibility requires some extra effort and cooperation from the author.  </s>
<s> In order to maintain user goodwill and acceptance of accessible authoring practices, the user should receive progress feedback regarding satisfied accessibility objectives.  </s>
<s> Checkpoints: [Checkpoint: 3.6.1]  </s>
<s> [PRIORITY 3] The user is provided with progress feedback as accessibility goals are accomplished.  </s>
<s> 4 Ensure the Authoring Tool is Accessible to Authors with Disabilities Principles to consider in making the authoring tool accessible to authors with disabilities relate to 3 classes of functionality: 1) The authoring tool is a software program with standard user interface elements and as such should follow relevant user interface accessibility guidelines (links to TRACE guidelines, Microsoft, SUN, DACX, Apple, IBM guidelines) 2) The authoring tool frequently encompasses the functionality of a user agent or browser and as such should follow the user agent guidelines.  </s>
<s> 3) The authoring tool has unique functionality as a Web content editor.  </s>
<s> Access to this unique functionality will be addressed in these guidelines.  </s>
<s> 4.1 Provide optional views of the edited document When creating or editing a Web page the desired ultimate rendering of the page may not be optimal for creating and editing.  </s>
<s> Checkpoints: [Checkpoint: 4.1.1]  </s>
<s> [PRIORITY 1] The authoring tools supports at least two views: 1.an authoring/editing view 2.a publishing or browser view, (similar to the normal and page view or print preview of popular word processors).  </s>
<s> Techniques: [Technique: 4.1.1]  </s>
<s> In the authoring/editing view, the font size, letter and line spacing, and text and background color should be independent of the final format of the document.  </s>
<s> 4.2 Provide text representations of tags Graphically represented elements cannot be identified by third-party assistive technologies that translate text to Braille, speech, or large print.  </s>
<s> Some authoring tools display the start and end tags as graphics.  </s>
<s> Checkpoints: [Checkpoint: 4.2.1] [PRIORITY 1] Allow the author to display tags in a text format.  </s>
<s> [Checkpoint: 4.2.2] [PRIORITY 1] Surround tags with text brackets to help distinguish the start or end tag from the remainder of the document.  </s>
<s> 4.3 Provide text representations of site maps Graphic representation of Web pages or Web site elements in site management tools cannot be identified by third-party assistive technologies that translate text to Braille, speech, or large print.  </s>
<s> Techniques: [Technique: 2.8.1] [PRIORITY 1] Allow the author to display the site map in text form (e.g., as a structured tree file).  </s>
