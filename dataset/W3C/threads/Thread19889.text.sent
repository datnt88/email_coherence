i saw amaya support several foreign langauge. 
i am korean. 
i want amaya support for korean language. 
please answer... 
I see your english is limited. 
What language support do you need? - Do you need Amaya to be able to create korean language pages? 
I think that is already possible. 
There are English and French spelling checkers since there is a spelling checker and there are english and french word-lists. 
Provide it with a korean word-list to spellcheck korean. 
- Do you need Amaya to have korean options, menus, messages and korean help? 
I think that needs translation of all the messages in the source and rebuilding. 
Since Amaya updates more than once a year, I don't think it is worth doing.

Hmmm. 
I see your Hangul knowledge is limited... 
I guess that part of the original question is more related with hangul typeing and unicode compliance. 
Having the GUI in korean does not help a lot if you're still obliged to compose in a latin alphabet !

We're just starting to work on it. 
Regards Irene. 
No offence, I just recognized the need. 
True: Hangul? 
I was thinking that some azian countries use the latin alphabet besides an own alphabet. 
But that still leaves the question: needs Amaya to be translated or do you need special aid in Amaya to create pages in your alphabet or languate. 
I recognize some languages (arabic, chinese..) read and write in a differen direction besides the different characters. 
After all, I was just wondering, I don't know non european languages at all and from the eropean only a few a little.

please answer... Hello There Nova, I believe supporting Korean language is no matter since everything works quite well, You can purchase bunch of unicode support option packs for your unix platform systems, Otherwise invent yourself using your Hangul(Korean) language knowledge. 
To just support pull down menus with Hangul language i suggest modifying the source codes and libraries.
