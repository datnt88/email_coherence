Hello, I've updated the following documents to prepare for Candidate Recommendation. 
Please note that, while review is welcome, I don't anticipate making any changes to the document before advancing to Candidate Rec. 
However, if you find some urgent bugs that need fixing, please let me know. 
Otherwise, thank you for understanding that additional edits will be possible once we've gone to Candidate Rec. 
Also, the issues lists and list of changes are up to date. 
Thank you all for you hard work! 
- Ian
