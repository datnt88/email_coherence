I've checked/foundOK Also w.r.t. to the test case document I believe that I already mentioned that is now a PET (PositiveEntailmentTest) according to our resolution that Language tags *don't* affect the denotation of an rdf:XMLLiteral Other than that, I haven't found other test case document issues.
