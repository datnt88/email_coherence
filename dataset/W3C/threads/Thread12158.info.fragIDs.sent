The short answer is: there is no new rep. 
Allaire no longer exists since the "merger" with Macromedia became effective as of last Wednesday. 
I resigned as Allaire's representative for that reason; Macromedia has not asked me to be theirs. 
If Macromedia are interested in being represented on this group I'm sure they'll put forward someone and I'm sure a Macromedia representative will be quite welcome (I understand there has been an open invitation for a long time).

Susan Morrow from Macromedia attended a Washington pf meeting. 
I wonder if she would be interested? 
Which way round was the 'merger'? 
Macromedia took over Allaire or the other way round?
