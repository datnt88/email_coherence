<s> Hi everyone, I have suggested several times in the past the concept that WCAG 2.0 (or 3.0, or whatever) could be used as a modularized "toolkit" for constructing an accessibility policy.  </s>
<s> This is what we saw the federal government do (with arguable success) with WCAG 1.0 to create Section 508 regulations.  </s>
<s> Since WCAG 1.0 was not intended to be used as such (witness the de facto implementation policies embodied by the compliance scheme), the effort was difficult.  </s>
<s> After me proposing this enough times, someone (Jason or Gregg?) finally got through to me that merely talking about it was not enough, and a fleshed out straw man proposal would be helpful.  </s>
<s> Therefore, I've spent the last few days working on "FWAP" -- Framework for Web Accessibility Policies, based on WCAG 2.0 (draft 24 August 2001).  </s>
<s> FWAP is a modularized approach to accessibility policies, one that takes into account that different policy-setting entities may have different priorities and may have different interpretations of the WCAG 2.0 guidelines.  </s>
<s> Thus many of these modules are broken up along PRACTICAL considerations rather than DOGMATIC.  </s>
<s> For example -- a company may wish to require the use of lang="fr" on all their pages (assuming French is the default language) but may not wish to require xml:lang="fr" as that assumes the use of XML.  </s>
<s> A strict reading of the guidelines could require both, as well as requiring XHTML Strict, etc, etc.  </s>
<s> The concept of "exclusion statements" is introduced in this document as well.  </s>
<s> Basically those are a way of saying "if you make an exclusionary policy, you've got to admit to yourself and the world."  </s>
<s> These are marked as optional specifically because the idea is new and reflects even less concensus than modularized accessibility policies, and because they are not a key component of the FWAP system.  </s>
<s> I ask you to consider the issue of exclusion statements as a separate proposal from the FWAP framework in general.  </s>
<s> You will notice that I've rewritten checkpoints to create FWAP "requirements" -- this is intentional.  </s>
<s> I don't claim that my rewrites are perfect, but they serve the straw man purpose of illustrating what I mean -- and what I mean is that the way you write a FWAP requirement is different from the way you write a WCAG 2.0 checkpoint.  </s>
<s> For example, it's one checkpoint to say "provide text equivalents for  </s>
<s> non-text content" -- but it's multiple FWAP requirements.  </s>
<s> This is  </s>
<s> not an aesthetic choice but one of pure practicality -- web developers don't think in terms of "do all my non-text content bits have text equivalents?" but rather in terms of "do I need alt text for my image?  </s>
<s> do I need longdesc?  </s>
<s> do i need functional equivalents for my Java applet?  </s>
<s> do I need HTML versions of PDF files?"  </s>
<s> Any good policy created for use within an entity MUST answer those questions and cannot stay as vague as WCAG 2.0 does.  </s>
<s> (This is not a criticism of WCAG 2.0 phrasing -- it is a statement, and a true one, of the type of additional material that policy-makers must provide to web developers beyond what WCAG 2.0 states.)  </s>
<s> I welcome your comments on this.  </s>
<s> If I've left out any requirements, or written them poorly, or whatever, those comments are accepted but not requested, because what it comes down to is whether or not we like this type of APPROACH.  </s>
<s> If we do, the specifics (which requirements go with which modules, how we phrase things, what terminology we use) can be worked out -- and if we don't like it, it doesn't really matter if I got your favorite checkpoint "wrong."  </s>
<s> So -- any feedback on the FWAP proposal?  </s>
<s> --Kynn PS: I call this "deconstructing WCAG 2.0" because it's necessary to take apart WCAG checkpoints and break them down into their  </s>
<s> necessary policy implications as part of the guideline - policy practice.  </s>
<s> I call this "FWAP" because it's moderately pronouncable, and because sometimes I want to *fwap* entities which do not have sound web accessibility policies.  </s>
<s> Kynn Bartlett kynn@idyllmtn.com  </s>
<s> Kynn, Thank you for investing the time and effort needed to write up a proposal.  </s>
<s> This provides the material necessary to allow the working  </s>
<s> group to consider the merits of the "policy framework" analysis.  </s>
<s> There was much discussion of the relationship between WCAG and policy at last week's face to face meeting.  </s>
<s> It was also made quite clear at the interest group meeting, by developers themselves, that they need clear guidance regarding how to formulate an implementation plan and how to determine the order and priority with which to address various checkpoints.  </s>
<s> It was also argued that organizations should be provided with some flexibility in defining policies, but that entities with fewer resources would benefit significantly from a limited range of pre-defined policy options' being laid down in advance.  </s>
<s> There was also disagreement over whether the working group should, or should not, prioritize the checkpoints of the 2.0 guidelines.  </s>
<s> Opposition to the establishment of priorities arose from two distinct but complementary arguments.  </s>
<s> First, as noted above, it was asserted that policy makers, whether at a governmental or organisational level, would inevitably determine priorities based on a variety of pragmatic considerations, which depend on context and circumstances that the WCAG working group is in no position to foresee or take into account.  </s>
<s> At an organisational level, for example, implementation priorities will be determined by a variety of factors, including the authoring  </s>
<s> tools and implementation technologies in use, whether the content is  </s>
<s> being created anew or "retrofitted", etc.  </s>
<s> Given the perceived inevitability of policy setting, it was argued that the guidelines should support these efforts by providing some flexibility, but without allowing unconstrained subsetting or modification of the requirements.  </s>
<s> It was correspondingly argued from a user's point of view that any prioritization within the guidelines would necessarily be discriminatory, since almost every checkpoint represents an absolute barrier to accessibility for some identifiable group, and by establishing priorities, the working group would not only be legitimising, but also engaging in the practice of determining whose access needs should be treated as of foremost importance, and whose, by contrast, carry less weight.  </s>
<s> It was recognised that policy setters will inevitably make such decisions, but these, it was suggested, should be required to be transparent as to whose needs will and will not be satisfied by any particular policy formulation.  </s>
<s> Metadata was favoured as the preferred mechanism through which to match users' needs with the policy implemented by a particular site.  </s>
<s> An analysis of the interdependencies among the checkpoints of the 2.0 draft indicated that most could be implemented independently of one another, but that the benefits of some checkpoints could not be realised unless certain other checkpoints were regarded as prerequisites.  </s>
<s> It was acknowledged that any implementation and conformance framework provided by WCAG must take cognisance of these interdependencies, as well as the more specific dependencies arising at a technology-specific level.  </s>
<s> My impression of the meeting is that proponents of priorities were willing to consider alternative proposals that did not involve the prioritisation of checkpoints as in WCAG 1.0.  </s>
<s> The underlying concern was that content developers be provided with firm policy guidance, and there were suggestions that this could be achieved by offering a well-defined framework for decision making, including one or more sample policies.  </s>
<s> Some participants were also concerned to ensure that the prioritization and policy-setting process carried out by organisations would not be completely open-ended, so that content which was tailored for access by a specific group defined according to disability, could not be regarded as conforming to the guidelines.  </s>
<s> The upshot of these deliberations appears to be that the guidelines should impose constraints upon, and offer guidance in, the formulation of policies, whether by governments, organisations or individual developers.  </s>
<s> It was agreed that there should be clear and explicit "success criteria" with which to determine whether web content conforms to each checkpoint.  </s>
<s> There was no consensus as to whether the guidelines should have an over-arching conformance scheme requiring anything more than that developers be able to assert (via metadata or otherwise) which checkpoints they claim to have implemented.  </s>
<s> A possible solution not discussed at the meeting would be to regard web content as conforming to the guidelines if it satisfies those requirements defined in a policy that accords with the framework provided by WCAG.  </s>
<s> This would be broadly consistent with Kynn's proposal and generally reflective of the ideas arising from the face to face meeting.  </s>
<s> It should be pointed out that I am not necessarily advocating this idea, but merely raising it as a possibility which accords with the arguments reported above.  </s>
<s> Full details of last week's deliberations will appear in the minutes of the meeting, which will be published as soon as Wendy, Charles and Cynthia have compiled their notes and made them available on the web site.  </s>
<s> Kynn, Aside from having some problems with the specific PDF modules you included, there is a lot I like about this approach.  </s>
<s> However, I'm a bit confused about the relationship between general modules and technology specific modules.  </s>
<s> For instance, you included both a module on abbreviations and on HTML abbreviations, with a dependency noted.  </s>
<s> Is that the way to indicate a module which is a technology-specific implementation of a more general requirement?  </s>
<s> This seems to be a slightly different relationship than, say, the Strict HTML's dependency on Valid HTML.  </s>
<s> This also seems to scatter technology-specific requirements, rather than gathering them together in one place so someone using that technology can be sure to catch all the requirements, and someone who isn't using a specific technology can ignore the related requirements.  </s>
<s> But this may just be a problem of presentation, not of content.  </s>
<s> Loretta  </s>
<s> I figured that would be the case -- I threw those in to say "hey, we could do modules about PDF" but I don't have the expertise to say what those modules would be, and on that I defer happily to you.  </s>
<s> Yes, I'm not sure about how to do this, which is why I gave various example of "how it could be done" with the intent to illustrate possibilities.  </s>
<s> I'm not sure I like how it came out exactly; I think some work on the "dependencies" is necessary, as well as specifically on the issue of technology-specific modules.  </s>
<s> That is why this is a rough draft.  </s>
<s> ;) On the issue of abbreviations, as I see it, there is a non-tech dependent way to do the checkpoint -- indicate abbreviations as we do in plaintext -- and a tech-dependent which is "use the ABBR tag."  </s>
<s> The two modules are meant to reflect this but maybe it is not clear.  </s>
<s> It probably is.  </s>
<s> :) However, ideally what you'd have is something using this approach to CREATE the actual policy which humans are meant to use, and that should be arrangable in any way desired.  </s>

<s> This is a fantastic job Kynn, My first impression, before I nit pick etc is - cool well done Lisa  </s>
