<s> We are in the process of redesigning a multiple company extranet and have learned that a huge number of our users have Netscape 4.X as their browser.  </s>
<s> Consequently, some of our team is reluctant to design using standards (the main concern is using CSS) since it will mess up the design we have already created.  </s>
<s> The concerns include CSS becoming overhead and that keeping track of how the various workarounds for Netscape 4.x work and don't work, along with the inheritance issues, will take a huge amount of time.  </s>
<s> I would love to know what some of our options are, but don't have the technical expertise to make a strong case.  </s>
<s> Any advice?  </s>
<s> Give up Netscape 4 or give up standards.  </s>
<s> First, it *is* possible to code for NN4 using valid, strict (X)HTML and CSS.  </s>
<s> Of course, you can't create the same sofisticated layouts and visually perfect designs as for modern browsers, but your documents can still be fully accessible and usable.  </s>
<s> Second, is not HTML 4.0 Transitional a valid standard?  </s>
<s> We may consider XHTML + CSS layout a better standard, however the transitional specs are standards as well and there is nothing wrong with a table layout, provided it's done properly.  </s>
<s> Best, Marek Prokop  </s>
<s> Give up Netscape 4 or give up standards.  </s>
<s> We are in complete agreement on those points ;)  </s>
<s> I think this is where I got off on the wrong foot on the interpretation with Austin.  </s>
<s> In my opinion (and personal as well as professional situation), we  </s>
<s> have moved beyond HTML4 and into XHTML + CSS.  </s>
<s> The only browser we had to  </s>
<s> leave behind was Netscape 4, and considering that Denmark has less than 1% Netscape users (combined), that was hardly a difficult choice.  </s>
<s> Of course HTML 4 Transitional is still a valid standard, and if Mike wants Netscape 4 support he will most likely have to settle for it.  </s>
<s> I just hope he is now aware of the limitations and degredations that he willingly impose on himself through that decision.  </s>

<s> I wanted to ask the group about this.  </s>
<s> What version of (X)HTML should a competent web designer use this days?  </s>
<s> Assuming that his/her design would work in all versions.  </s>
<s> I've been reading a lot about XHTML and liking it, but is any compatibility sacrificed if I leave HTML behind and go straight to XHTML 1.1 for all my work?  </s>
<s> Will Netscape 4 survive this, thanks to the transitional backwards-compatibility of XHTML?  </s>
<s> Or is it safer, at this junction, to still use HTML 4.0.1?  </s>
<s> I've being doing this gig since the early nineties, so I'm used to waiting (and waiting...) for good technology to be adopted across all pertinent browsers.  </s>
<s> Is the time right for universal use of XHTML?  </s>
<s> Or are there still caveats?  </s>
<s> Wondering... -Joseph  </s>
<s> I've never had problems with using XHTML for web-authoring.  </s>
<s> I would stay away from XHTML 1.1 right now since it cannot technically be served  </s>

<s> XHTML 1.0 Strict is essentially the same thing and if the  </s>
<s> rules are followed, it can be served as text/html.  </s>

<s> Hello, Using XHTML don't guarantee me being a competent designer, but personally I've been using XHTML 1.1 DTD[1] for some time.  </s>
<s> There has been no problems with older browsers, excluding thead-tfoot-tbody -structure.  </s>
<s> Last weekend I had to make one compromise using "border" attribute for an anchored image to prevent it being bordered with NN4.x.  </s>
<s> As we know, CSS's border property don't render properly in NN4.x  </s>
<s> When one should re-write a HTML 4.01 -document straight to valid XHTML, there may appear some problems.  </s>
<s> For instance, CSS is treated partly differently[2] with XHTML DTD, and "converting" element's attributes to CSS can also bring problems.  </s>
<s> If people keep waiting and asking "Has the time come for ...", nothing actually evolves.  </s>
<s> Start using XHTML when you think it'd be appropriate - not when someone tells you to do so.  </s>
<s> Best Regards, Samuli Hakoniemi [1] http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml11/DTD/xhtml11.dtd [2] Eg., overflow property acts differently in BODY and TEXTAREA elements depending on DTD.  </s>
