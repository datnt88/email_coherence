<s> At the closing session of the W3C DRM meeting, I well recall the final whiteboarding session which concluded with drawing up three top level activities which we felt should be reconciled, converged, recognised, or at  </s>
<s> least talking to each other.  </s>
<s> These were W3c (of course), MPEG-21, and indecs (each of which had been described in the meeting at length).  </s>
<s> I was disappointed therefore to see that the published final Report makes no  </s>
<s> mention in "Related Activities" of indecs, or of DOI which is implementing many of the key issues discussed.  </s>
<s> The final whitebaorded diagram seems to have been erased from history.  </s>
<s> Although there is scattered mention in the detailed minutes, I believe the final report should reflect this more in line with the actual discussion.  </s>
<s> In particular indecs is I believe very relevant as a study for the development of a Rights Data Dictionary (RDD), a  </s>
<s> common dictionary or vocabulary for intellectual property rights, based on  </s>
<s> the indecs Framework [which outlined the fundamental principals and key terminology implemented in DOI applications and ONIX (widely used in publishing and increasingly with audiovisual products)] is even now under way.  </s>
<s> (see http://www.doi.org/news/010418-multimediaIP.html.  </s>
<s> One of the aims  </s>
<s> of this study is to provide input to MPEG 21 and other standards activities.  </s>

<s> Rigo, all, Thanks for publishing the report.  </s>
<s> Although I have some comments, I think it reflects a good job in accurately conveying what was discussed over the twoworkshop days.  </s>
<s> The one thing that is really missing in my view (and I am echoing Norman's comments) is the summary that we did in the end.  </s>
<s> I really think that list belongs in this summary, with appropriate qualifications (it was the result of a braindump after two days of intensive discussions).  </s>
<s> Please add that summary.  </s>
<s> Then, I am anxious to learn about W3C's next steps.  </s>
<s> Detailed comments follow below.  </s>
<s> W3C will now take these recommendations and discuss it internally before making any formal decisions.  </s>
<s> Any view on the time schedule for this?  </s>
<s> There were a considerable amount of voices requiring, that a system should work offline as online.  </s>
<s> This is not a "should", this is the very definition of DRM: persistent governance.  </s>
<s> Was this the conclusion?  </s>
<s> We did discuss the 'digital mangement of rights' versus the 'management of digital rights' yes.  </s>
<s> Privacy DRM is also processing personal information.  </s>
<s> It needs to treat consumer as a "first-class" object.  </s>
<s> That is, a consumer's profile have access usage conditions, and other (user-) rights linked to it.  </s>
<s> Consumers need to be able to express and manage their rights and interests, and DRM can help them do just that.  </s>
<s> To learn about DRM issues use "simulated interoperability".  </s>
<s> No, this was postulated as a potential solution (though I do not understand well how it can be)  </s>
<s> Architecture Interoperability is a key DRM requirement (see discussion below) A digital Rights Language is seen as a good first step for DRM standardisation (see discussion below).  </s>
<s> "... a good first step for interoperability, but not nearly enough"  </s>
<s> Security DRM needs a Trust Infrastructure (see discussion below).  </s>
<s> Yes, true, but the real issue was that *Standardized* DRM needs a Standardized Trust Infrastructure, which makes it such a challenge.  </s>
<s> Multimedia MPEG is addressing DRM needs and should work closely with W3C.  </s>
<s> Good header :-) But the statement strikes me as funny.  </s>
<s> "MPEG should work closely with W3C"?  </s>
<s> This can be read in a number of ways.  </s>
<s> "W3C should work closely with MPEG" is something I have heard as well.  </s>
<s> Please make this comclusion more balanced, so that it doesn't (unintentionally) sound like a requirement on MPEG alone.  </s>
<s> Identifiers The identification of content is a critical requirement for Currently there is no single system that can provide all needed features for all sectors.  </s>
<s> (Note that MPEG has begun to address this issue in the Digital Item Idnetification and Description)  </s>
<s> DRM Interoperability It is clear that a shared architectural model or abstract framework is required, if only for people to fully understand the depth and breadth of the rights management arena.  </s>
<s> A number of position papers explored this in depth; they considered a layered, abstract model that consisting of policy expression, transmission, interpretation/enforcement, and thus introduced "multiple" levels of well-defined interoperability.  </s>
<s> But we did not agree on a framework.  </s>
<s> We just know it has many layers.  </s>
<s> MPEG's presentation of their MPEG-21 "Digital Item Declaration Model" proposal suggests another pathway to interoperability, which is consistent a call for a  </s>
<s> word missing ("with") ?  </s>
<s> higher-level framework.  </s>
<s> It is important for W3C to be engaged in that activity, while working toward a framework context.  </s>
<s> Note that the Declaration work in itself is not about DRM.  </s>
<s> MPEG-21 *is* though.  </s>
<s> Good points, well captured.  </s>
<s> Also, note that trust isn't automatically transitive or even reflexive.  </s>
<s> [...] Trust-structures are actually such a big task, that they should be considered outside a DRM-Activity.  </s>
<s> Said who?  </s>
<s> I think (said) no DRM standardization will work without regard for this issue.  </s>
<s> MPEG-4: IPMP (Intellectual Property Management and Protection) MPEG-7 Multimedia Description Schemes  </s>
<s> MPEG-7 MDS is only one of several MPEG-7 parts, and there are DRM implications also at MPEG-7's Systems layer.  </s>
<s> MPEG-21 Digital Item Identification and Description  </s>
<s> MPEG-21 DIID is only one of several MPEG-21 parts.  </s>
<s> Notably, the Rights Language and Data Dictionary will be imortant too.  </s>
<s> *suggests* a piece of the solution.  </s>
<s> For example, MPEG-4 IPMP may come close to standardizing DRM APIs, but doesn't treat many other aspects of the problem (such as rights vocabularies, rights messaging, etc).  </s>
<s> True about MPEG-4, much less true when taking into account the complete set of MPEG activities, designed to complement each other.  </s>
<s> (Rights messaging *is* actually addressed in MPEG-4 IPMP now)  </s>
<s> Next Steps There were opinions voicing, that the W3C is the best existing forum to define a forward-looking Framework.  </s>
<s> There was also concern that this may not be as clear to the broader W3C. Rights management presents a broad set of problems.  </s>
<s> , and a "Web-is-Everything and Everything-is-the-Web" view, if present, would surely generate conflicts in process and politics.  </s>
<s> Note that the same could be said of MPEG processes and politics (for example);  </s>
<s> I am unclear as to what "the same" exactly refers to.  </s>
<s> MPEG has cetainly recognized that the MPEG-21 vision goes beyond MPEG alone.  </s>
<s> The specialized WG's - possibly just one, but surely several  </s>
<s> (a somewhat contradictory statement)  </s>
<s> - would address individual missing pieces, such as a rights expression language - while some will see this as essentially a set of rights primitives with agreed-upon semantics (eg a rights data dictionary mapped onto an XML Schema), others will see this as including object definitions.  </s>
<s> Both interpretations are correct, but at different levels.  </s>
<s> I thnk this is taking one specific element and putting it sort of down as the conclusion of the workshop - see my first comment above.  </s>
<s> Best Regards to all who made it to the end of this mail, Rob  </s>
<s> Norman, indecs was a major input and we are aware of it.  </s>
<s> This is reflected in the position-papers and the minutes.  </s>
<s> I think a table with related activities would help a lot.  </s>
<s> The interpretation I would make of your statement is, that indecs is not well represented in the summary report.  </s>
<s> I would ask for a suggestion from you and/or Godfrey.  </s>
<s> I therefor would appreciate, if you could help me reconstruct the table you mentioned.  </s>
<s> This table was not minuted nor photographed.  </s>
<s> As I was standing with my back to it as I was chairing the session, I have a somewhat incomplete memory of it.  </s>
<s> Thanks in advance for your help.  </s>

<s> You asked for my proposal on this.  </s>
<s> My recollection, possibly not photographic after three months [so others feel free to correct], was that the whiteboard containied a simple diagram of major initiatives in this sphere of digital rights management.  </s>
<s> It wasn't a table, mopre a free hand thought bubble diagram.  </s>
<s> The top three ovals were: on the left W3C; in the middle indecs; on the right MPEG-21 The W3C oval then had a link to IETF, indicating existing liaison; the indecs oval had a link to IDF (DOI) and to ONIX, indicating implementation the MPEG oval had a link to ISO, indicating a formal role.  </s>
<s> I recall, that ODRL and XRML were on the chart too; being a whiteboarded diagram it no doubt lent itself to a more flexible interpretation than text.  </s>
<s> So my suggestions: that under "Related Activities" in the report we add indecs/DOI/ONIX, and that the report include the following: "The workshop concluded that liaison and collaboration to prevent needless duplication of effort should be encouraged.  </s>
<s> In particular, three top level activities were noted in this sphere of digital rights management: W3C - infrastructure and syntax standards, link to IETF etc. indecs - semanatic and content industry standards, link to practical implementations e.g. DOI, ONIX MPEG-21 - ISO standards, proposed development of multimedia framework standards As an example of such collaboration now taking place, the development of a Rights Data Dictionary (RDD), a common dictionary or vocabulary for intellectual property rights, based on the indecs Framework [which outlined the fundamental principals and key terminology implemented in DOI applications and ONIX (widely used in publishing and increasingly with audiovisual products)] is even now under way.  </s>
