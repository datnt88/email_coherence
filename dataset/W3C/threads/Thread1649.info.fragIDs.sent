<s> In our group we are discussing about the exact meaning of the additional precondition(s) DAV:supported-live-property for PROPFIND and PROPPATCH (3.11 and 3.12 in RFC 3253).  </s>
<s> In particular, the meaning of "the semantics of a property being supported by the server".  </s>
<s> Is the following an example?  </s>
<s> A PROPPATCH request intends to modify the value of a "checkout-fork" property of a checked-out VCR to something different than DAV:forbidden or DAV:discouraged, say, to an empty value.  </s>
<s> Then the DAV:supported-live-property precondition is violated.  </s>
<s> Another interpretation is, that it has to do with properties which are not REQUIRED (...but there are not such properties as fas as I can see!). Thanks, Peter  </s>
<s> As I understand it, the precondition will prevent that a resource can have dead properties of the same name as a deltav live property.  </s>
<s> So, on a deltav compliant server, you cannot retrieve or set the property DAV:version-history on a non-VCR resource (e.g. plain, unversioned resource of RFC 2518 style).  </s>
<s> A server, just followin 2518, would allow the setting of such a property.  </s>
<s> It would be a dead properties without any meaning, but returned on a PROPFIND nevertheless.  </s>

<s> Speaking of PROPPATCH preconditions, I can't help noticing that (DAV:cannot-modify-version-controlled-property): If the request attempts to modify a dead property, same semantics as PUT (see Section 3.10).  </s>
<s> (DAV:cannot-modify-version): If the request attempts to modify a dead property, same semantics as PUT (see Section 3.10).  </s>
<s> are identical.  </s>
<s> Which one should be reported?  </s>
<s> By inference from Section 3.10, it looks like DAV:cannot-modify-version-controlled-property should be reported when the request-URL identifies a resource with a DAV:checked-in property, and DAV:cannot-modify-version should be reported when the request-URL identifies a version resource.  </s>
