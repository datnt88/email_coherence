<s> Hi All Have just been checking out the RNIB site but cant find any recommendations as to the best font family to use.  </s>
<s> Currently, I use this... font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;  </s>
<s> Can I do any better than that?  </s>
<s> It didn't look very good on Win IE 5.5.  </s>
<s> Doesn't seem half bad on the Mac though.  </s>
<s> Any advice?  </s>

<s> Hi Carl  </s>
<s> The consensus points to 'open' fonts (sans serif ones) as are your examples.  </s>
<s> Maximum Accessibility (Slatin &amp; Rush, pub: Addison Wesley) recommends these fonts for those with low vision.  </s>
<s> Mencap's "Am I Making Myself Clear"* says to use a 'clear' typeface such as Arial or Univers for those with learning disabilities.  </s>
<s> (I guess that Univers is another sans-serif font.) The Mencap document appears to be done in Helvetica.  </s>
<s> Can't check my other books because my wife's just turned the lights out - bedtime over here!  </s>
<s> Hope this helps.  </s>

<s> Hi, Thanks all for your responses.  </s>
<s> I understand that for accessibility users own choices of fonts should be respected, and that's fine, their own style sheet of browser settings can presumably force that.  </s>
<s> My website is not specifically designed for disabled people, I just think good design practice should just be accessible, without the fuss.  </s>
<s> So, my users are just regular web users and I wont be expecting them to install a font to look at the page.  </s>
<s> It does seem like my choice perhaps isnt too bad after all, from what I skim  </s>
<s> read in Jim's article but it doesn't look great on IE 5.5.  </s>
<s> font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; I just thought I might be missing something.  </s>
<s> I personally don't much like Jacob's Nielsen's font choices.  </s>
<s> I thought there might be guidelines as to which are the clearest and most accessible commonly installed fonts on people's computers.  </s>
<s> I guess The BBC and RNIB have made some sensible choices  </s>
<s> so I'll perhaps go take a peak there.  </s>
<s> I just thought there might be a definative answer from this group (am still a bit of a newbie!).  </s>
<s> Having been an interaction designer 11 years I still struggle with the answers the colleagues in my community offer on the subject of which colours  </s>
<s> work best.  </s>
<s> The answer is invariably 'it depends'.  </s>
<s> Rather than being a template set of colours that work quite well for most people.  </s>
<s> The latter I can use immediately, the former is an interesting idea but doesn't lead me away from my bad taste and ignorance!  </s>
<s> I fear this font issue is similar.  </s>
<s> 'It Depends' is my pet hated expression over-used by Interaction Designers!  </s>

<s> Dear Carl!  </s>
<s> I guess your fonts choices are the best!  </s>
<s> Though you should begin thinking about "Readability".  </s>
<s> Here is an interesting link: Kind regards, John P.S. If you have a minute, please visit the "Webnauts Net Accessibility and Usability Initiative" forum at: http://www.webnauts.net/phpBB2/index.php  </s>

<s> Designers!  </s>
<s> That's why Microsoft commissioned fonts like Verdana, which are specifically designed to be read on low resolution raster devices.  </s>
<s> However, for high resolution devices, like normal text in printed books, serif fonts are easier to read and sans-serif fonts are normally used for headlines (and other material that must stand out but doesn't have to be read easily, like advertising copy! - Printed adverts are normally sans-serif for reasons other than readability!) One should probably use different fonts in the print style sheet from those in the screen one.  </s>
<s> One should always specify fallbacks for vendor fonts.  </s>
<s> One should also strongly consider whether one should be specififying a font at all, as the user will get the most consistent fonts, and if educated, the best for them, if their choices are respected.  </s>
