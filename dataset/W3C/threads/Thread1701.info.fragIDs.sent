<s> Here are some questions about the plic minutes:  </s>
<s> TCP over Wireless draft.  </s>
<s> The working group charter specifies that PILC will produce a 'TCP over Wireless' RFC that is a meta list of the existing PILC recommendations.  </s>
<s> This was reported in Adelaide as being completed in October 1999 because Aaron had confused it with the LTN draft.  </s>
<s> Actually, it requires some work.  </s>
<s> Gabe Montenegro has volunteered to sync up with the WAP forum to see if we can build this document on a work in progress that already exists in that body.  </s>
<s> The document should be only 3 or 4 pages long and should go to wg last call by January 2001.  </s>
<s> Gabe noted that there is currently no buy in by the WAP forum as yet, he will attend a forum meeting in September and try to resolve.  </s>
<s> Several members of WAP were in the room and volunteered to assist if needed.  </s>
<s> Is this WAP "work in progress" available for public inspection and review?  </s>
<s> If not, would someone who can see it please abstract it and post (anonymously if need be) please?  </s>
<s> Does any WAP product use TCP at all?  </s>
<s> Discussion on DoCoMo draft (draft-inamura-docomo-00.txt) Aaron noted that DoCoMo would like to publish this as informational RFC, but we don't want to get in a mode of publishing RFCs each time someone does this and requested input from the group.  </s>
<s> I would certainly support doing anything that would encourage DoCoMo to use end-to-end Internet protocols, and if they are as close as that draft suggests, publishing it as an Information RFC might help them provide TCP application services more easily.  </s>
<s> A speaker noted that the recommendations are pretty generic and suggested the working group use this as a starting point for the TCP over wireless document, or as an appendix to this document.  </s>
<s> Aaron suggested it might be necessary to take the simulation results out in order to use this document for the TCP over wireless document.  </s>
<s> Another speaker suggested using path MTU discovery instead of fixing it at 1500.  </s>
<s> Question: Maybe your tcp stack in the Opnet simulator is not the best TCP.  </s>
<s> Have you run this on real stacks, rather than on a simulator.  </s>
<s> Imaura - yes they have, but no published results.  </s>
<s> Aaron noted that another alternative was that the DoCoMo would be sent forth as informational, and would not be a recommendation.  </s>
<s> Tim Shepard asked why would one want to disseminate this information?  </s>
<s> Doesn't seem to make sense to have multiples of TCP/some link technology.  </s>
<s> Is this advice on how to tune TCP for the handset?  </s>
<s> Response from author: yes.  </s>
<s> Comment: This shows that tcp stack works over wireless error prone links.  </s>
<s> Comment: Doesn't think these results are any different from what a modern TCP stack does anyway.  </s>
<s> I think the TCP parameters and resulting behavior might be more different than typical TCP stacks than whoever made that comment  </s>
<s> might think.  </s>
<s> There seems to be a lack of understanding about the parameters involved, and most if not all of the important ones are at least touched on in the DoCoMo I-D and the documents it cites.  </s>
<s> Gabe: This is similar to what was done in ecn document  </s>
<s> What is the ecn document?  </s>
<s> Question: What bandwidth was used in the simulations?  </s>
<s> Imaura: 384kbs Comment: Doesn't think this is realistic, since this is only the rate if you are the only one in the cell.  </s>
<s> WAP is designed to use slower links.  </s>
<s> WAP is designed as if Moore's Law didn't exist.  </s>
<s> Discussion on Long lived TCPs draft (draft-magret-pilc-lltcp-00.txt)  </s>
<s> Comment: this is probably not a good idea -- leads to ICMP flooding.  </s>
<s> Is there any evidence to back this comment up?  </s>
<s> It seems that ICMP traffic is specifically addressed by Magret and Yang.  </s>
<s> Also, if there is a long outage you do want to go through slow start again, because the network has changed.  </s>
<s> There are better link level solutions to this problem.  </s>
<s> Like what?  </s>
<s> Thanks.  </s>
<s> Cheers, James  </s>
<s> Reiner, Thanks for your reply:  </s>
<s> You need to be more precise.  </s>
<s> Which parameters are you talking about?  </s>
<s> These from http://search.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-inamura-docomo-00.txt  </s>
<s> Feature Parameter/Recommendation RFC/Status MTU size 1500B N/A Window size 64KB RFC 793 Standard Initial window 2 mss RFC 2581 Proposed Standard Initial window up to 4380B RFC 2414 Experimental Use of SACK Recommend RFC 2018 Proposed Standard So, given the ECN-like properties of Radio Link Control -- 3G TS 25.322; which also seems to be incorporated in current versions of GSM -- -- is there really any need to add explicit link condition adaptation at the TCP or ICMP protocol levels?  </s>
<s> I don't want to be in a position of advocating the change or addition of anything to those protocols unless absolutely necessary.  </s>
<s> As far as robust wireless TCP goes, you are absolutely right that good service requires a maximum RTO shorter than the standard 64 seconds.  </s>
<s> What is that value in your TCP-Eiffel?  </s>
<s> And one parameter that the DoCoMo draft doesn't mention (perhaps it goes without saying to most people) is a total retransmit timeout much longer than the typical 2-9 minutes.  </s>
<s> Again, what do you use; an hour?  </s>
<s> Cheers, James P.S. Please keep at least ietf-mmms@imc.org in on this, as the lack of ubiquitous wireless TCP is related to Mobile Multimedia Messaging applications.  </s>
<s> Why should the maximum RTO be less than 64 seconds?  </s>
<s> If the RTO gets to that point it was because of exponential backoff.  </s>
<s> So, one of two things has happened... * Extreme congestion.  </s>
<s> In this case you want your RTO timer to be backed off to a large time to avoid aggrivating the congestion even more.  </s>
<s> * An outage.  </s>
<s> In this case, it is potentially painful when the link is re-established because you have to wait for some (likely large) amount of time before re-starting transmission.  </s>
<s> So, for this case, we'd like to have a lower maximum RTO.  </s>
<s> But, how does the end host figure out which situation it is in?  </s>
<s> There may be heuristics, but it seems to me that having an explicit mechanism that "kicks" TCP in the second case is likely the way to go (i.e., an ICMP or holding on to the last segment(s) to trigger the restart of the connection).  </s>
<s> allman  </s>
