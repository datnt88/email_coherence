These look like interesting possible additions to the URI specification. 
URI Resolution: The process of determining the access mechanism and appropriate parameters necessary to dereference a URI. 
e.g. in the case of an HTTP URI, this process resolves the URI into an IP address, a port number, a host name (possibly optional) and a request URI. 
Resolution may require several iterations. 
URI Dereference: The process of using the access mechanism and parameters generated by URI resolution to create, inspect or modify resource state. 
URI Retrieval: The use of URI dereference to retrieve representations of resource state. 
Interesting, if one could tell what they meant. 
The access mechanism is not necessarily unique. 
[example: HTTP 300 response; html:object element] Can't tell one is done with this until the intended query, be it to create, inspect, or modify "the state of the resource," (actually, some neighborhood in The Web) has succeeded or one has exhausted options and none has succeeded. 
The nature of the desired operation may be implied by the URI itself or may be determined by the context in which the URI-reference is found. 
The action described here is the elaboration of a transaction for which the URI is part of the initial representation. 
The URI does not always contain all the assertions which govern this concretion step. 
This language is circular. 
Retrieval is to retrieve. 
But what is that? 
What is actually happening is creating a 'local' resource, that is to say a resource within an address space decided by and convenient for the using process, which is a faithful replica of the state of the resource and meets certain concreteness or representation vocabulary constraints of the using process as well. 
[Think endian flips.] 
From the 'defining' language given, it is not clear how to distinguish this from the previous. 
And the 'create' and 'modify' cases would seem to call for terms parallel to this 'inspect' version. 
Of course in the case of web Forms, what one retrieves is not just resource state but the opportunity including method handles to change the state. 
These are all flavors of elaboration or expansion of a compact utterance: migrating an expression in the specific direction employing through known, applicable generic-specific relationship patterns. 
A URI-reference constrains, but does not necessarily complete the constraints on, the fragment of the Web that is being elaborated in this line of development. 
The whole discussion is unfortunately tainted with network communication residues. 
This is not necessary, and it is not the Architecture of the Web until this aspect is defined independently from network and database specifics. 
What is happening is that there is a local web within which a neighborhood (a context+expression containing a URI-reference) is being expanded, and because of the embedded URI-reference, the expansion is being done subject to constraints linking the local expansion with a large, persistent web in which URIs are globally non-colliding in their interpretation (to a sufficient degree). 
The URI serves to key the view into the persistent, shared Web with which the local-web expansion is to be synchronized. 
The 'done-ness' or stopping criteria for when the expansion has succeeded are determined by the local transaction, not by the URI. 
Al Hi Al, Given that the message Larry referred to was from me, maybe I should say a The terms resolution, dereference and retrival all seem to get used in conjunction with URI. 
I was enquiring whether there were fine-grain differences in meaning in the use of such terms, and if so whether good definitions existed already. 
The TAG (of which I am a member) have said things like "Dereferencing a URI is safe", "Following a link is safe" or "retrival using HTTP GET is safe" (for some concept of safety). 
But I think that we may have a loose or different notions for what it means to dereference a URI. 
It is also evident that the IETF is working on "URN resolution" (DDDS part 4) which seems related. 
The (virtual) world view that you present below, neatly avoids having to use this terminology... which is nice. 
But the terms float around in common usage, maybe ill-defined, and do percolate into such documents as TAG findings and the emerging document on Web architecture. 
-----Original Message----- From: Al Gilman [mailto:asgilman@iamdigex.net] Sent: 14 July 2002 16:31 Subject: Re: definitions for operations on URIs Ok... could change "...the access mechanism..." to "...an access mechanism...". 
In your response I find it interesting that (to you) resolution seems involve some operation on the resource that needs to complete successfully in order for resolution to complete successfully. 
Ok... its a fair cop... So... the "'defining' language" arose from the existence of terms like "deferencable URI" and "URN resolution" (cf DDDS part 4) and the association of 'safety' with retrieval or dereference (depending on who one is listening to) in common use. 
What you present (here and below), and I have no problem with it, is a world view that avoids notions of resolution, dereference and retrieval. 
I chose 'create', 'modify' and 'inspect' to avoid the use of PUT, POST, GET, DELETE... The reason to pick on retrieval as such is the expectation of 'safety' assoicated with the retreival of state representations e.g. http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/get7#safety, or originally http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Axioms.html#state or the relevant part of RFC2616 and its predecessors. 
*If* "Dereferencing URIs is safe" is to mis-speak, what is it that should be described as being 'safe'. 
I think thats a very nice picture. 
Yes... but there seem to be two 'levels' of activity here... the longer running sequence of actions that result in further expansion and so-forth which could go one for a while before one regarded the activity (buying some shoes) as having concluded... and the more immediate expansion, keyed by URI and some context, along with the immediate result of that 'single' expanding step. 
It seems to me that there can be a sense of 'done-ness' at both these levels. 
Thanks, Stuart Al, I don't think the purpose of including these definitions would be to give complete instructions for URI handling in all situations, but to help all readers (and writers) of URI-related documents to be in broad agreement about the terms they use. 
Hence: I don't think that harms the definition as given. 
Ditto. 
OK, I suggest: URI Retrieval: The use of URI dereference to obtain representations of resource state. 
I think retrieval is a common enough case to deserve special mention. 
Tainted?
