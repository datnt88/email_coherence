<s> We need to create a relationship between the HTML techniques and the WCAG 2 guidelines so I've created a table that attempts to show how they go together[1].  </s>
<s> I'm sure there will be some disagreement on this mapping so please don't take this document as anything final.  </s>
<s> It's meant to start discussion.  </s>
<s> Some of the things I noticed... - Several guidelines (about a third of them) have no techniques yet.  </s>
<s> - Two of the techniques don't seem to fit under any guidelines: [2][3] - Some techniques that don't seem very important are still given level 1 priority because there is no level 2 success criteria.  </s>
<s> Examples of this are "misuse of the blockquote element" and "misuse of the pre element".  </s>
<s> I think they fit under the guideline 4.1 (use technologies according to spec) and, IMHO, are not that important for accessibility.  </s>
<s> There is no level 2 success criteria so I've had to put them as level 1. - There are still no guidelines or techniques that deal with relative/absolute sizes.  </s>

<s> For my action item from the 02 July 2004 Techniques Teleconference, I have proposed a revision to the mapping of HTML Techniques to WCAG 2.0 success criteria started by Chris in this thread.  </s>
<s> There are two attached files, which contain identical information but in a different way.  </s>
<s> The gl-to-htmltech file presents Principles, guidelines, and success criteria and shows the techniques that map to them.  </s>
<s> The htmltech-to-gl shows the HTML techniques and the success criteria or guideline that map to them.  </s>
<s> Almost all the mappings are at the success criteria level; I only used the guideline level if I couldn't find a success criterion, but it seemed pretty clear the guideline mapped.  </s>
<s> Although the information is the same the two presentations make different issue pop out.  </s>
<s> For me there are a lot of issues raised by these mappings (both for techniques and for guidelines).  </s>
<s> I will send those in a follow-up as soon as I can.  </s>
<s> Meanwhile this mapping can be used for our agenda in the 09 July 2004 call.  </s>

<s> Hello All, As part of my action item, I have compiled the attached htm file.  </s>
<s> It is a start and perhaps some more techniques can be listed when I get more time.  </s>
