<s> There was some related discussion in the telecon this afternoon, and I was kind of unable to explain my point...(I'm really hopeless in that respect) The thing about anonymous nodes is that they are ***variables*** if they would be constants, we would be able to identify them with ***URI constants*** Now they are actually existentially quantified variables, something like: there exists an _:a or (using existing vocab): this log:forSome _:a So I think we should say that *explicitly* is the testresults (and in the model theory) (the general case?)

<s> Hi Brian, Great, I really find this interesting too!  </s>
<s> I think there are 3 kinds of variables [1] free variables [2] existentially quantified variables [3] universally quantified variables  </s>
<s> and I think the misunderstanding is that anonymous resources are (sometimes) 'treated' as [1] whereas I think they should always be treated as [2].  </s>
<s> If somebody writes the following .nt  </s>
<s> _:a uriref1 uriref2 .  </s>
<s> and says that this is a statement, then (s)he is basically talking a free variable (somewhere floating around in triple space)  </s>
<s> I think this is wrong because there is no quantification: the floating thing should be existentially quantified and I think  </s>
<s> the best way to do that is to *point* to it.  </s>
<s> That can be simply done with a statement *using* that term e.g. uriref3 uriref4 _:a.  </s>
<s> or it can be done with scope-uri the-log-forSome-uri _:a.  </s>
<s> I have recently experimented with implicit scoping, but I think this is not a scalable approach.  </s>
<s> If we have terms existentially quantified, then I think that a lot can be done with such terms, but that's another topic...  </s>

<s> Hi Jos, With regard to the recent discussion with Jan, I think there might be some miscommunication.  </s>
<s> What I think than Jan is saying is that, given the model: http://descr1 http:/prop _:anon .  </s>
<s> http://descr2 http:/prop _:anon .  </s>
<s> it is not possible to express this exactly in the RDF/XML syntax.  </s>
<s> The reason is that the only way this can be done is to assign an ID or a URI to the anonymous resource.  </s>
<s> That 'resource' then ceases to be anonymous.  </s>
<s> In effect, it is no longer a variable.  </s>
<s> Try translating the above n-triple example to RDF/XML and you will see what I mean.  </s>
<s> Reading your message again, maybe I get an inkling of what you are saying.  </s>
<s> We are talking here about what is an anonymous resource.  </s>
<s> We have been saying that it is an existentially qualified variable.  </s>
<s> I have been understanding that to mean that it denotes some specific resource with certain properties, i.e. _:anon rdf:type rdf:Class .  </s>
<s> says there is some specific resource, _:anon, which has type class.  </s>
<s> Is that what you would call a 'constant'?  </s>
<s> Ah.  </s>
<s> This is beginning to make sense to me.  </s>
<s> If it were a constant, then you wouldn't mind at all that a URI had been assigned to it.  </s>
<s> That would not change its nature.  </s>
<s> I think you may be saying that what I thought of as a variable is not really a variable.  </s>
<s> It does not bind to multiple values.  </s>
<s> Instead it represents a single value (constant) though I don't know what the value is.  </s>
<s> Hmmm.  </s>
<s> Now consider: 5+x=1 Is x a variable?  </s>
<s> No. Its an unknown, until I solve the equation.  </s>
<s> Have we been calling anon resources variables, when we should have called them unknowns?  </s>
<s> If what I previously thought of as a variable, is not really a variable, how would you explain what a variable is, without having to refer to concepts defined in a logic layer above rdfcore?  </s>
<s> This is really very interesting.  </s>
<s> Have a good weekend.  </s>

<s> Hi Jos,  </s>
<s> So just to help me a little along the path to understanding, could you explain a bit more about what you mean by a free variable.  </s>
<s> Some examples that I can relate to would be good.  </s>
<s> For example is the x in 5x+1=6 a free variable?  </s>
<s> Thats what I was calling an unknown.  </s>
<s> Wheras the x in x+y=0 is a variable.  </s>
<s> At least that's the distinction I thought you were making.  </s>
<s> Can you give examples of the difference?  </s>
<s> Not being sure about what you mean by a 'free variable' I don't understand that.  </s>
<s> I would have said _:a is an unknown.  </s>
<s> The difference between a free variable and an unknown is that a free variable may be bound to many things, an unknown can bind to just one.  </s>
<s> Doesn't existential quantification turn a free variable into an unkown?  </s>
<s> That's why skolemization works - we can give an existentially qualified variable a name (assuming for the moment we are not in the scope of a universal quanitifer, because we don't have any of those in rdf).  </s>
<s> Now if that were true, then you and I have the same model for what what is going on here.  </s>
<s> _:a is both an existentially qualified variable and an 'unknown' because they are the same thing (in this context - because we have no universal quantification) So if that is the case, then what's the problem here?  </s>
<s> Maybe the problem is that you are of the view that it does no hard to assign a name to an anonymous resource.  </s>
<s> That's just skolemization.  </s>
<s> You might then argue, with Sergey, that there is no need to represent anonymous resources in the model.  </s>
<s> And Jan's problem that RDF/XML cannot represent an arbritary model is not a problem.  </s>
<s> By the way I've changed the title from log:forSome.  </s>
<s> This may be another misunderstanding on my part, but I'm talking about anon resources as they would be defined in the lowest layers of the rdf model.  </s>
<s> At that layer log:forSome is not defined so we can't use it here.  </s>
<s> If you are taling about a logic language layered on top of the core, that could explain a lot.  </s>
<s> Now you have lost me.  </s>
<s> What is a term?  </s>
<s> RDF doesn't define such a concept.  </s>
<s> Brian  </s>
<s> that's indeed a very good point about skolemization in the case that 'we are not in the scope of a universal quanitifer' we have indeed a full blown *constant* but I think that in general you can not make that assumption (your piece of RDF *could* fall in the scope of many univerally quantified variables (I mean when used by outside-core things)  </s>
<s> WHAT??!!!???? How??? (How can anything outside a document project a quantifier scope across that document??) That is an amazing idea, and suggests an entirely new picture of how the semantic web might work, but if we really think this is possible then we should get it clear ASAP, as it completely changes the ground rules.  </s>
<s> For example there is no such thing as an assertion, since anything might be only a subexpression of something outside the document.  </s>
<s> A SAP would help here (such a hot weather...)  </s>
<s> OK, let's take e.g. the following piece of RDF (which is at http://www.agfa.com/w3c/n3/ext.n3)  </s>
<s> :s0 :is [ :p1 :o1; :p2 :o2].  </s>
<s> :s0 :p3 :o3.  </s>
<s> and onother one (which is at http://www.agfa.com/w3c/n3/ext-rules.n3)  </s>
<s> {{:u :is [ :p1 :x; :p2 :y].  </s>
<s> :u :p3 :z} log:implies {:u :is [ :p1 :x; :p2 :y; :p3 :z]}} a log:Truth; log:forAll :u, :x, :y, :z.  </s>
<s> then the query (which is at http://www.agfa.com/w3c/n3/ext-query.n3)  </s>
<s> {:s0 :is :z} log:forSome :z.  </s>
<s> will result in (which is at http://www.agfa.com/w3c/n3/ext-result.n3) {:s0 :is [ :p1 :o1; :p2 :o2].  </s>
<s> :s0 :p3 :o3} log:implies {:s0 :is [ :p1 :o1; :p2 :o2; :p3 :o3]}.  </s>
<s> :s0 :is [ :p1 :o1; :p2 :o2].  </s>
<s> so there is some kind of changed 'extension of objects'  </s>
<s> (there must be some link with SKIF here) OK, we have identified an anonymous node by its content in the sense of a (not *the*) thing which has as 'least common' certain descriptions and it is kind of 'by value' (not 'by reference') but is that a problem?  </s>

<s> Hey, you should be in Florida, 98F and 100% humidity, even the buildings sweat.  </s>
<s> Just as an aside: that universal quantifier is scoped by the outer pair of { }, ie it is entirely inside the document  </s>
<s> What indicates that this is a query?  </s>
<s> (Is there any syntactic distinction?)  </s>
<s> Not just a quibble, because in many usages, calling something a 'query' effectively inverts all its quantifiers, so that an existential in a query is like a universal in an assertion.  </s>
<s> If you are following this common convention, then the log:forSome, while logically correct, is potentially misleading: it is 'functionally' exactly like a universal, so that the :z variable can be bound to anything.  </s>
<s> (In Gentzen terminology, it is on the other side of the sequent, so all the intro/elimination rules are inverted.  </s>
<s> In LP terms, the goal is negated and then you test for unsatisfiability.) Notice it would be a logical error to skolemise an existential *in a query*; a query isn't being asserted.  </s>
<s> No, you are just doing conventional reasoning here, with universals in the axioms (assumptions) and existentials in the goals (queries, conclusions) , both of which mean that all variables can be freely matched to anything.  </s>
<s> All your quantifiers are 'universal' in this sense, and all their scopes are local to their documents; nothing projects or extends from one document into another, but since the variables are all universal, they can be bound to terms (names) occurring in other documents.  </s>
<s> (All of this assumes that all the documents are talking about the same universe, so it is kosher to just smurge together assertions from different sources and draw conclusions from them as thouh they were all in one document.  </s>
<s> This is probably too naive a perspective for the entire web; but that gets us into a minefield which is beyond the scope of this WG.)  </s>
<s> I think that your use here of universal quantifiers goes way beyond RDF.  </s>
<s> All your variables are universal.  </s>
