Hi, I seem to recall hearing/seeing something about the idea of defaulting the cursor focus into the first form field on a page as an ease-of-use recommendation, but I cannot find any references to it. 
Are there any WAI recommendations about this? 
I have tried pages out that have search fields as well as login screens, and they seem to work quite well with screenreaders: the screenreader first reads the "label+edit" and then proceeds reading the rest of the page until a user starts entering their search criterion or login info. 
Thanks for any pointers, -Kerstin It's actually the other way around. 
Setting the focus may _disturb_ and confuse users. 
Since setting the focus is a Javascript operation, it is performed (if ever) after the page has loaded and has been at least preliminary rendered. 
As usual, unexpected delays are to be expected on the Internet; something might intervene and cause even several seconds' delay before the focusing takes place. 
Thus, in common use on screen, it may well happen that the user starts filling out a form and, as he has proceeded to, say, the fourth field, something happens and he is taken back to the first field. 
People with cognitive disabilities, and even people without them, can get very confused then.

The only recommendation I know of is to ensure that there is a logical navigation order. 
Individual browsers (or browser/screenreader or browser/asssistive technology combinations) may provide specialised configurations, which reflect a user's experience and preferences, if the content they work on works in standard ways.

Gah! You're half-way through filling in the second field when the page finishes downloading, document.onload 
kicks in and the focus moves in the middle of your typing. 
Making the first form field the first item in the tab order is often, but not always, a good idea, but switching focus for no obvious (to the user) reason isn't.

True. 
And since javascript is a required to implement this irritateUserByRefocusing(), there's no reason why the script can't check where the focus is first before resetting it. 
Using a bit of logic like "Well, if the focus is already on a form element, don't move it!" will certainly be more useful to a visitor. 
and though some sites do it and some screen readers love it, I find it quite disorienting. 
I want to decide where my focus is going to go on the page so would rather have it at the top or beyond the repetative links at least. 
I may be accessing the site for reasons other than to type something in.

Really you'd have to make sure that nothing was focused (users focus links as well). 
Even then it creates confusing behaviour :(
