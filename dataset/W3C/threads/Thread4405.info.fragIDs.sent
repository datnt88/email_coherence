Can a root node which is not a document node be a parent node? 
The last sentence in 4 implies that a fragment has a "root node" which is not a document node. 
Can such a "root node" have child nodes or, more precisely, be a parent node? 
Andrew Watt 
Yes, it can. 
The XQuery expression yields an element node a which has no parent (and is therefore a root), and which has a child b. 
Since the latest XSLT 2.0 draft it is also possible to create such structures in XSLT: Michael Kay

The answer is yes, and I'm not sure how the confusion arises. 
That a node is a root is independent of its other accessors. 
In any event, the sections on both the parent accessor and on root nodes have been reworded in the 12 Nov draft. 
Is the new wording clear?
