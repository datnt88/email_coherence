Gentlemen, The following editorial issues still need to be resolved by us and incorporated into the spec. 
261, 262 and 264 Editorial issue 284 is closed but the resolution still needs to be incorporated into the spec. 
Issue 320 is closed but the resolution still needs to be incorporated into the spec. 
I know how I want to resolve 262, and I think I will incorporate that resolution into the proposal I am making regarding Comments, prefixes, namespace attributes and other infosetisms. 
I believe Henrik will be making proposals for closing Issues 261 and 264. 
Can someone step up to incorporate the resolutions for 284 and 320? 
Cheers Gudge P.S. It would be really great if we could get this stuff done by the con-call on Wednesday. 
That way we ( the editors ) would have no outstanding work items. 
I just sent out proposals for 261 and 264 and can incorporate resolutions for 284 and 320 today. 
262 seems to be a dupe of 210, no? Henrik OK, those proposals haven't shown up in my inbox yet :-( If you can do 284 and 320 today that would be great, although tomorrow would be early enough, I know today is a holiday for you guys. 
210 seems to be about attributes while 262 is about whitespace, so I don't think it's a dupe. 
Gudge Sorry, I meant 208 " Clarify that whitespace IS (potentially) significant in Header and Body blocks" :) I will try and get to the editing tonight.

Ah, OK. 
I think the whitespace issue is a bit wider than just Body, but perhaps I can reuse/modify the text Marc put in for 208. 
Gudge Reading my email this morning; I guess I've been beaten up by Henrik to incorporate these! 
Thanks Henrik! 
We can all get carried away but "beaten up by Henrik"? 
...I thought I was a friendly guy ;) Oh, dear me, didn't mean to say that at all! 
I meant the way you executed! 
Hmm... but not to mean that I was "beaten up and executed"! 
;-)
