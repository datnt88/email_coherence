<s> BlankIt a appears another interesting case goes to court today where a wheel chair user is seeking compensation from London Stanstead Airport and Ryan Air for charging ?18.00 for the use of a wheelchair and lift to get onto the plane.  </s>

<s> I think he has an open and shut case, but the outcome will be interesting, and I believe the airline and airport are only contesting the case as this sets a precedent to supply a reasonable service for all disabled travellers, world wide.  </s>

<s> When I worked for a tourism dot-com some years ago we weren't shy about suggesting that customers sue over this (it wasn't our company policy to do so, but individually we were outraged and didn't hide it).  </s>

<s> They charge the airlines for the use of the wheelchair lifts, I don't think any other airline passes the charge on the customer, whereas Ryan Air pass *everything* onto the customer.  </s>
