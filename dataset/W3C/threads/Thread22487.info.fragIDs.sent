In the specification: "Parameters tagname The name of the tag to match on. 
If the string "*" is given, this 
method will 
return all elements in the document" Does it really mean that "*" returns all elements in the Document, even the 
elements in the 
parent chain of the element instance, or does it mean all elements 
descending the 
element instance? 
That is just an error in the doc. 
It will be fixed in the next release. 
Also: I presume that the method is recursive, please tell me if i am wrong. 
That is an implementation issue.

Documentor and I am 
a bit confused about the Element::getElementsByTagName method.

All sub-elements of the Element in this case, not the document (that's what Document.getElementsByTagName is for).

If by recursive you mean does it do the entire sub-tree, then yes.
