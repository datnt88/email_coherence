The Amaya team is proud to announce the availability of the 2.0 release of the Amaya editor/browser for both Unix and Windows platforms. 
Binaries are available at: Source is available at: A FAQ is available at http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/FAQ.html An important milestone associated with this release is the opening of the Amaya CVS base (read only mode for the moment). 
We'll send a follow-up message later this week giving more information on how to retrieve Amaya from the W3C CVS server and how to compile it. 
To know more about the features of this and older Amaya releases, see http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/New.html N.B. 
Due to some technical problems, we won't be able to upload this Amaya distribution to our ftp server until tomorrow. 
It's available thru HTTP, though. 
Many thanks to the feedback from our users, which has helped improve many aspects of Amaya. 
Keep it coming! 
Extensions 2.0: * First implementation of a multi-document, multi-level Undo/Redo command. 
* WAI guidelines on Image and Maps. 
* COLGROUP and COL elements are accepted and can be created within TABLE elements. 
The rendering is not implemented yet, though. 
* CSS properties "left-margin", "top-margin", and "display: none" are now interpreted. 
* Amaya is now able to load, edit, print and save CSS files and plain text files. 
* The entry "Style Sheets" in the menu Style allows one to o link a CSS file using the standard Amaya paragdim: Click to select the target or display a form allowing us to type the URI. 
The corresponding LINK element is automatically created and CSS properties are applied to the document. 
o open a CSS file used in a document. 
o open a CSS file used in a document. 
o disable CSS properties of the CSS file. 
o enable or re-apply CSS properties of the CSS file. 
o remove a CSS link. 
* After a "Make Book" the document is automatically switched to the Read-Only mode. 
This will avoid the user to edit it or save it by error. 
* Publication thru the net now uses the HTTP/1.1 etags and conditional headers to avoid the lost updates problem.. * The 409 HTTP error message (conflict) is now shown in a popup window. 
* Added DEFLATE content encoding support under Windows. 
* First support of disconnected browsing mode thru the libwww cache. 
* Command SaveAs allows you to save a document in XHTML, following the specifications and guidelines of the latest XHTML draft. 
* Adding new menu entries: o Back and Forward: navigation commands o Editor/Browser mode: setting Amaya mode (read only or read/write) o Amaya at W3C: link to the menu. 
* Implementing a new policy of colors allocation. 
* First version of Preferences configuration menus. 
* The Verfiy each PUT with a GET option is now turned off by default * It's now possible to browse with a simple-click or a double-click. 
By default Amaya uses the double-click, but it could be switched to simple-click in the General preference menu. 
* Using the Publishing preferencesmenu, it's now possible to choose the default name for saving URLs that end in "/". 
* New version of the Thot API: o Changing of TtaAddButton and TtaChangeButton to merge Windows and Unix dialogue API. 
o New functions: TtaGiveNextElement, TtaGetFirstLeaf, TtaGetLastLeaf o A new Thot event: TteElemClick * All user Amaya preferences and personal files are collected into a home directory. 
By default this directory is $HOME/.amaya on Unix platforms and C:\TEMP\amaya on Windows platforms. 
These files are: o a personal amaya.css 
o a personal amaya.keyboard 
(amaya.kb on Windows) o a personal dictionary o thot.rc personal preferences. 
This file is generated and updated thru the Special/Preferences menu o other temporary files and directories used by Amaya. 
* After a paste command, the selection is now set at the end of the pasted text where the user could continue to insert text. 
* The Amaya CVS base is now available in read-only mode at and the libwww is no longer considered as a part of the Amaya code. 
The source tar file includes the libwww code (libwww is a directory next to Amaya) and one who acceedes the CVS base needs to get the libwww code (cvs get libwww) to compile Amaya. 
Fixed bugs 2.0: * Scripts can now be created within the document Body and are no longer moved into the Head at parsing time. 
* When creating a new polyline in an area map there was a bug which generated wrong coords values on Windows platforms. 
* Comments in files amaya.keyboard and amaya.kb are now allowed. 
* When a document included the sequence form .. table .. /form .. /table Amaya closed the table at the end of the form. 
Now it reports a parsing error on the end tag /form and avoids to split the table. 
* Copying an image from a remote document to a local document didn't work. 
* When following a link which had a "?foo" ending, Amaya treated that ending as a query string. 
* Some attributes values appeared with strange names in the Attribute menu. 
* When the current position was in a sequence of empty blocks (paragraphs, for instance), the Backspace key deleted two of these blocks at once and did not select anything. 
* When pasting a paragraph with an attribute at the beginning of a table cell or list item, it was turned into a pseudo-paragraph, and produced wrong HTML code when the document was saved. 
* Amaya locked up when one applied the strong command to a text displayed at the beginning of a line. 
* CSS selectors like "PRE SPAN.test" didn't work. 
* The CSS parser didn't parse well the rule url("..."). 
* SMALL elements could be displayed too small. 
* basefont face="...." was saved as basefont facee="...." . 
* When putting an attribute on a text string, the attribute was generated as text in the HTML output. 
Now a SPAN element is generated to carry the attribute. 
This bug occured with attributes title, dir, and most event attributes (onclick, ondblclick, onmousedown, etc.). 
* Amaya crashed when loading an isolated image with a filename without a suffix. 
* People who compiled Amaya on Windows platforms couldn't display jpeg images. 
The problem is fixed now. 
* The authentication handlers were desactivated while doing a HEAD pre-check during the lost update PUT procedure. 
* While browsing an image, pressing the reload button didn't show the image again. 
* It wasn't possible to browse images when the request was redirected to a URL having a different end name.

Argghhh!! Bloody Janet Cache again, then. 
All I can get is the Page for the 1.4a version from 12 January -- cache presumably refusing to check for a new version of the Page. 
It doesn't matter how I do it (lynx, netscape, all local caching zapped, either of the above URLs, ... ). 
Thanks for the news ... I'll pass it on. 
Ted. 
E-Mail: (Ted Harding) Ted.Harding@nessie.mcc.ac.uk Date: 03-May-99 Time: 18:56:30 ------------------------------ XFMail ------------------------------ Hello Ted, You must be going thru one of our mirrors or clicked on the ftp server links? 
No, it was the UK Janet Cache (possibly the Manchester contingent since apparently Cambridge doesn't have the problem). 
See below. 
I was using the HTTP server. 
Anyway, I've found a work-round which may help anyone else stuck up the same blind alley. 
I begged time on my son's Win98 machine which uses a commercial ISP instead of the University (which enforces caching) and got through to the right thing immediately. 
For anyone who needs to know, the direct URL for The Right Thing is and this works, even over the Janet National Cache! 
As I said before, the URLs given in the announcement of 2.0 lead, via the Janet cache, only to the 1.4a version of 12 January, bacause that cache is not updated. 
Many thanks, Jose, for your response and advice. 
Best wishes, Ted.

Have you got precompiled binaries for older versions of IRIX? 
Roy Platon In-reply-to: Your message of Tue, 04 May 1999 11:27:57 -0400." 
Hi Roy, Yes the distribution is for IRIX 6.5. 
We don't have any other IRIX box here, but fortunately sources are available. 
Regards Irene.
