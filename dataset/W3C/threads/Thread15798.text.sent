From the web page Claims Against Common Sense By William Raspberry Monday, November 16, 1998; Page A25 If I promise to go back to being my old sweet self tomorrow, would you let me get a little meanness off my chest today? 
Thanks. 
Randy Tamez: Get a grip. 
Tamez, left blind by treatment for a brain tumor a dozen years ago, has sued the Bay Area's Metropolitan Transportation Commission for violating his rights. 
The basis, according to the Associated Press: He can't access the system's Web site for bus and train schedules. 
That, in his view, is a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). 
It is, in my view, a clear violation of common sense. 
Of course I sympathize with Tamez's difficulties. 
Who wouldn't sympathize with a 36-year-old guy suddenly rendered unable to see anything beyond shapes, shadows and light? 
Blindness must be a terrible handicap, and I would applaud any genius who comes up with a device to make it less burdensome. 
But someone already has come up with something that works quite well for most of us: Web sites with lots of graphics, sound, video clips and such that make it possible to provide useful information in user-friendly ways (and also to facilitate the advertising that makes many Web sites worth providing in the first place). 
Apparently a return to a text-based system would make it easier for the visually impaired, though arguably less attractive for the rest of us. 
Is that a violation? 
I hope you don't think I'm just being nasty to Tamez. 
I've been waiting nearly a year for a chance to be nasty to the disabled folk who complained about Rick Fink's nice-guy gesture. 
Fink, divisional maintenance manager for the 97 Wendy's restaurants in Kentucky, West Virginia and North Carolina, decided that while the company was undertaking renovations to make the bathrooms and other facilities more accessible to wheelchair users, he'd go an accommodating step farther. 
He positioned two regular tables near the door and marked them with the stylized wheelchair symbol. 
You know what? 
Some representatives of disabled groups accused Fink of establishing a "disabled ghetto." 
"We want the opportunity to be there without the stigma or labeling," one of them said. 
Are those choice near-the-door parking spaces a "disabled ghetto" as well? 
Get a grip. 
Look, I think the ADA is a terrific idea. 
The wider doors, ramped entrances and roomy, handrailed toilet stalls must be a godsend for those who need them -- with no skin off the noses of those who don't. 
Similarly with wheelchair-accessible curbs and other modifications -- particularly in cases of new construction. 
I still remember a column by Charles Krauthammer praising the subtle ramping at Washington's Kennedy Center -- an architectural boon for wheelchair users and utterly unnoticed by others. 
What sparks my meanness is the insistence by some among the disabled that (1) their disability be accommodated and (2) that we take no notice of it. 
I mean, for instance, the people who insist on putting chair-lift devices on all public buses -- even when relatively few wheelchair users are among the riders and even though it can be significantly cheaper for local governments to furnish door-to-door transport by taxicab or limo than to retrofit all the buses. 
I mean the deaf guy who wanted to discuss some controversy with a colleague of mine, using one of those phone devices that involve speaking to an intermediary who then teletypes the message to the caller's phone screen, and then waits for a typed response that he reads to the callee. 
It can take awhile. 
My time-pressed colleague finally offered a deal: Put your comments in a letter, and I'll respond in detail by return mail. 
The guy was furious. 
He didn't have time to write letters, he said, clearly resenting the fact that other readers who wanted to talk to columnists didn't have to write letters. 
Get a grip. 
A part of my problem, I suppose, is that I am utterly unable to extract a useful principle from any of my resentments. 
Sometimes I'm happy for the accommodations our society is making for the "differently abled." 
Sometimes I think they ask too much or are ungrateful and whiny. 
And sometimes I think, with Krauthammer: Why, what a sensible, nonobtrusive, nonhumiliating solution. 
Shouldn't all our accommodations be like that? 
But, of course, they can't be. 
Sometimes the handicap means that you can't do things the way everybody else does them, that you have to accommodate to your own situation. 
By picking up the phone and calling the transit authority's information line, for instance. 
There, I feel so much better. 
(c) Copyright 1998 The Washington Post Company Although, we are trying to change that perception, this is one that is rather hard to defeat. 
IMHO, Mr. Raspberry isn't arguing the case for general Web accessibility, he is arguing against convenience of access when there is inconvenience to the information provider. 
Does everyone have the right of convenience of access to information or is it just access that is a basic right? 
I think what is essential to his frustration is that there were other means of access to this information, and his perception is that Mr. Tamez is "whining" because it has not been provided to him in the manner he would rather access it. 
This is an argument that rages in other forms throughout the Web world. 
It has to do with the necessity of Web as a medium of communication rather than seeing it as a luxury or gimmick. 
Try convincing 50+ CEOs they need a Web site when they have paper advertisements and other means of access to the information about the company! 
The general public doesn't yet see the Web as essential as an information source. 
It's close, but not there yet. 
When Web is a necessity, rather than a luxury, Mr. Raspberry will change his opinion. 
It's almost written there in the article. 
The argument here is not about the Web. 
It is about whether convenience of access is a right or a priviledge, and whether the Web is a necessity or a luxury. 
All for Web, and Web for all, I say.

Excuse the crudity of my expression, but this editorial has got me riled. 
When I calm down, I'll write a longer, more reasoned response to the newspaper, and explain to them exactly why he's so, so, so wrong in assuming the World Wide Web is a visual medium, which seems to be the entire basis of his petty, mean-spirited argument. 
--Kynn, more to come Here's a letter to the ditor I just sent to the Post. 
There's so much that could be said, but I tried to raise what I see as the issue around the necessity ot including everyone in the community of dialogue that I think the Web is. 
To the editor: William Raspberry's column "Claims Against Common Sense" is both patronizing and off the mark. 
How obnoxious is his "sympathy" for Randy Tamez, the visually handicapped San Jose man who filed a complaint that he could not access transportation schedule information from the Bay Area's Metropolitan Transportation Commission Web site. 
But after all, says Raspberry, we already have "something that works well for most of us, Web sites with lots of graphics, sound, video clips and such that make it possible to provide useful information in user-friendly ways." 
I seem to recall a time when America had a segregated school system that was thought to "work well for most of us." 
The point then, as now with the World Wide Web, was not making changes simply to redress the "unfairness" or "inequality" of separate school systems (as important as that was and is.) The significant social questions "equal opportunity" and "equal access" raises are who is included in our society and who is not, who makes the decisions and how those decisions are made. 
In the case of computers and the Internet, the question can also be framed as "who is the user to whom user-friendly applies?" 
All of which goes far beyond how pretty Mr. Raspberry thinks Web pages should be and whether he "sympathizes" or not with someone who is visually impaired. 
I made a less pationate and more direct, technical approach to his editorial. 
I e-mailed it directly to him and his editors: William, I wanted to repond to your column from yesterday about how Randy Tamez needs to "give up" with his ADA complaint regarding Web sites. 
Since you're not a professional Web developer, you may not realize that there are hundreds of people across the country working to make it so the Web is more accessible for people with disabilities like Randy. 
Because the Web is graphically-oriented and many Web developers wish to continue designing big, flashy sites....we've all been saying the only way we'd ever get legislation regarding the accessibility of Web sites would be if someone were to file an ADA complaint. 
People with disabilities have just as much a right to view information as those who are fine. 
The best way to make a Web site accessible is NOT to make a seperate text page. 
This requires extra work on behalf of the developer both to create and maintain. 
The Web Accessibility Initiative of the Web Consotrium, (W3C), has developed a set of page authoring guidelines to teach Web developers how to make sites more accessible without sacrificing their beautiful designs and powerful graphics. 
Unfortunatly, because certain people perpetuate the myth that text is the only way this can be accomplished, Web developers are ignoring the topic of accessibility.
