Subscribe Hi, I would like to know if there is a C++ DOM binding spec. 
Ming-fang Wang No, there isn't. 
We often agree that this would be a good idea, but nobody has volunteered the time to do this yet.

Texcel Research It seems to me the there is already a C++ mapping for IDL. 
What appears to be problematic concerning the W3C usage of IDL is that supplementary language mappings are being defined. 
Aside from political wangling, there is one and only one valid technical reason for this that I am aware of, namely the requirement to be able to map exceptions from attributes - a feature not currently supported by IDL. 
As a result the DOM IDL spec carries a number of ambiguous exception declarations as comments in the IDL. 
The good news is that proposals currently under the OMG Component technology adoption process includes revisions to IDL to include exception declarations on attributes. 
Details of the Component proposal are available under ftp://ftp.omg.org/pub/docs/orbos/98-12-02.zip. 
With the inclusion of these changes to IDL we can envisage a complete alignment of the activities within OMG and W3C. 
Cheers, Steve.

Behalf Of Jonathan Robie Sent: Wednesday, 06 January, 1999 02:54 Subject: Re: C++ DOM Binding We developed a C binding using the Java bindings as a guide. 
The first argument is always the object (which is a vtable like self descriptive object), and overloaded method names were extended to include type in the name: value = PDOMgetValue(textObject); PDOMsetValue(textObject, "new value"); etc... 
It would seem a C++ binding based on the Java bindings as starting place would be straight forward. 
djw It might be good to follow the OMG-IDL binding to C a bit more closely; it defines the method naming and how exceptions get handled, for example.
