<s> One of the major comment was that it will be hosted by the W3C and will gain an implicit endorsement from the W3C (which you can't have  </s>

<s> Philipe  </s>
<s> Interesting... I seem to be the editor of the Python DOM bindings; should I be involved in this, or would such a restriction be limited to W3C members?  </s>
<s> Actually, would it make sense to break out the Java and ECMAScript bindings into separate documents?  </s>
<s> These are of no interest to large portions of the DOM-using development communities.  </s>
<s> This would be acceptable.  </s>
<s> This would be problematic, as many of the players in the Python/XML community are not members of the W3C and will not be able to join just to work with the DOM bindings effort.  </s>
<s> What is a "public review" in this context?  </s>
<s> Does it simply mean that it would be easier to find information on bindings for languages not directly handled by the W3C?  </s>
<s> The Python community already has a working group for XML topics, and  </s>
<s> there hasn't been any discussion there about requesting endorsement from the W3C -- the Python community generally ahbors adding process to what is essentially a technical issue.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, I'm not at all opposed to a repository of  </s>
<s> bindings documents, regardless of it's endorsement status with the W3C.  </s>
<s> -Fred Fred L. Drake, Jr. fdrake at acm.org PythonLabs at Digital Creations  </s>
<s> What I would suggest is that the W3C keep supporting the three types of  </s>
<s> bindings that they currently support (OMGIDL/ECMAScript/Java) for consistency and speed sake.  </s>
<s> Then, after a working draft becomes a  </s>
<s> recommendation, have a bindings recommendation referenced from the DOM recommendation.  </s>
<s> This would consist of having three "areas" stored for the recommendation.  </s>
<s> The DOM recommendation itself, a bindings reference page that the recommendation refers too, then the DOM bindings.  </s>
<s> In this manner the DOM recommendation itself would not change, just a reference (the binding reference page) would change.  </s>

<s> Regarding the Python DOM Bindings discussion, Uche Ogbuji included your email address in the offline thread.  </s>
<s> Regarding the DOM Bindings repository, it would  </s>
<s> be a public repository, with public-only comments.  </s>
<s> Hum, rereading the proposal, this is not obvious.  </s>
<s> I need to clarify that.  </s>
<s> On one hand, I would say yes.  </s>
<s> It would also resolve the case of the numbers that are possible to be included in the DOM spec.  </s>
<s> with separate documents, there is no more limits.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, having separated documents increase  </s>
<s> ... the numbers of documents.  </s>
<s> Our communication team wasn't pleased at all of the split of DOM Level 2. It will increase the number of documents in /TR a lot.  </s>
<s> So, for the moment, the only reason why we didn't do that is a practical reason.  </s>
<s> An other possibility would be to remove the bindings from the specs and put them somewhere else (let's say /DOM).  </s>
<s> They will be no longer normative in that case and I don't think that we want that.  </s>
<s> "public review" is that it will give a chance to people to reject the proposed bindings.  </s>
<s> If someone sends an other (incompatible) version for the Python DOM bindings, I won't a good reason to not list them in the DOM page.  </s>
<s> Philippe  </s>
<s> I've now dug back through my inbox and found those emails, and read them.  </s>
<s> Thanks for the pointer.  </s>
<s> I understood that the repository would be public; I still don't know what the comments are -- comments *by* the public, or comments by the W3C *to* the public?  </s>
<s> [In response to my suggestion to move the bindings out of the DOM spec...]  </s>
<s> There are no limits either way, unless your bits are heavier than mine.  </s>
<s> ;-)  </s>
<s> Ah... a classic document management problem.  </s>
<s> I'll consider that a W3C internal matter, and keep out of it.  </s>
<s> I have no reason to suggest that the status of the Java or ECMAScript bindings be changed; I think careful standardization is a good thing.  </s>
<s> This is a little odd.  </s>
<s> If there is a reason for the public to reject a particular binding, that implies that non-rejection is meaningful in some sense.  </s>
<s> If W3C endorsement is not meant by keeping the bindings document in the repository, I'm not sure what is being rejected.  </s>
<s> If it's a matter of people saying they don't like a binding for whatever reason, that's fine, but I'm not sure what is gained over having a mailing list archive for that.  </s>
<s> (Which is not to say there shouldn't be a forum associated with the repository; it's just unclear what the goal is.) -Fred Fred L. Drake, Jr. fdrake at acm.org PythonLabs at Digital Creations  </s>
<s> Yes. grin/ More accurately, it should be an ongoing discussion of whether what's being proposed makes sense from both the DOM and the user-community points of view, and iteration toward a solution which is a good fit (or at least an acceptable fit) to everyone's requirements.  </s>
<s> Joe Kesselman / IBM Research  </s>
<s> Yes, a DOM Bindings Repository is indeed what the community is looking for, Philippe.  </s>
<s> I do not, however, agree that publicly reviewed bindings for which a listing is posted on the W3C site will garner an implicit endorsement.  </s>
<s> Endorsements come with inclusion in the spec.  </s>
<s> Not so for disclaimed listings.  </s>
<s> Please seriously consider solution #3. smirk These comments have absolutely nothing to do with the fact that I'm probably just a few days away from making what would be a formal DOM Binding Submission for Lingo.  </s>
