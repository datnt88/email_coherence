I need to extract text from HTML documents and do this from a platform portable C program. 
I've been all over the web -- dejanews, yahoo etc., and the closest thing I've found is libwww. 
However, I notice in libwww (http://www.w3.org/Library/User/Start.html) that libwww isn't recommended for use as an HTML parser. 
It recommends Amaya as a full HTML parser. 
Is there some part of the Amaya source code that would be suitable for extracting the text from HTML documents from a C program? 
Any tips, hints, etc would be greatly appreciated. 
TIA, Howard Rubin You might try to write a Perl (or sed/awk) script for the purpose. 
I should have a look at the print code. 
There is a special executable in the bin directory. 
You should strip all the postscript code it generates and there you have your text.

Corne' Beerse| Alcatel Telecom Nederland Sorry for the delay. 
I'm not sure that Amaya is the best platform to do what you want. 
Of course Amaya is able to extract the text from HTML documents, by loading HTML documents an saving them into the text form (see Save As command). 
But I think you can easily do that with a more simple C program.
