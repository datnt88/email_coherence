Hi All I'm setting up a spider for our internal use that passes html pages onto tidy for validation. 
I just updated my tidy.exe to the February 1 2003 version and am now getting numerous messages such as: Warning: Text node in body in HTML 4.01 Transitional Warning: Text node in form in HTML 4.01 Transitional My gut feeling is this is DOM related, but the DOM is not one of my strong points yet. 
Any advice on what this means &amp; how correct the issues is appreciated.

The messages are not accurate. 
Do you have a small sample HTML document? 
What config options did you use? 
Thanks Bjoern I solved the problem last night with the help of a list member. 
I'm still not 100% sure of what was causing triggering the message as it seemed to only occur when two separate issues were present together in the code. 
These were: - Invalid attributes on the body tag - a and br immediately within the body If I removed either one of these the errors disappeared. 
I'm more concerned about the invalid body tag attributes and have removed them. 
But, yes you are right these messages are somewhat ambiguous, especially if you have never seen them before. 
Is there a list of standard error messages and probable causes somewhere?
