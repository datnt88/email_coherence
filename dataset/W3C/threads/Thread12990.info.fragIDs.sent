<s> Dear EOWG, I have a question about metatags.  </s>
<s> Is there one dedicated to ADA compliance?  </s>

<s> In short, no.  </s>
<s> But there is a project going on in the WAI ERT group called EARL - evaluation and report language.  </s>
<s> The idea is to provide a way, in metadata, of asserting conformance - to pretty much anything that has a URI, but the reason we developed it and are working on it is for asserting conformance to various WAI guidelines.  </s>
<s> It is fairly trivial to use it for conformance to any other set of requirements, such as ADA rules, or Section 508 rules.  </s>
<s> The trick is in figuring out how to use it in a standard vocabulary.  </s>
<s> Information, mostly of a technical kind at the moment, is at the EARl homepage http://www.w3.org/2001/03/earl and I will try to remember to work on an example that shows how to use it for looking at 508 conformance and WCAG conformance and how it can help compare the two.  </s>
<s> I expect to be doing that the week after next.  </s>

<s> Does anyone else know of any recent or planned update that does consider it?  </s>
