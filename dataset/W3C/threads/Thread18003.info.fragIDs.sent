<s> It is an important issue.  </s>
<s> I trust that if we can agree on what needs to be said, a sensitive way of saying it can be devised.  </s>
<s> Whether it is OK to use the term "all users" instead of "people with disabilities" depends on the context.  </s>
<s> It is fine to refer to the _secondary benefits_ that might flow to "all users" from following UAAG.  </s>

<s> The UAAG document should only include requirements that are important for people with disabilities.  </s>
<s> If we use benefits for people without disabilities as reason for a requirement, then we have gone beyond our charter and we have no authority or credibility.  </s>
<s> Our charter is to address issues of accessibility of user agents (where something is accessible if "can be used by people with disabilities", definition of Accessible, WCAG 1.0).  </s>
<s> Our charter is _not_ to make user agents more usable for people without disabilities.  </s>
<s> Regarding people who have limitations associated with normal aging as opposed to pathology: Our mission is related to people with "disabilities", regardless of the cause of disability.  </s>
<s> If the limitations are sufficient to be classified as a disability, then we have a charter to guide developers of user agents on how to address them.  </s>
