To the GL Group: Here is a comment or discussion that I put to the EO Group. 
Dan prefers this go to the GL. 
My discussion is where the Page Authoring Guidleines state If a table is used for layout, do not use any structural markup for the purpose of visual formatting. 
wai-pageauth-tech.html#tech-table-layout 
For example, in HTML do not use the table header (TH) element to cause the contents of a cell to be displayed centered and in bold. 
Other attributes of a table, such as a caption describing the layout purpose and content of columns is valuable, particularly if some cells become navbars, frames, images, imagemaps, or lists of links. 
[Priority 1] And the QuickTips state 
9. Tables Avoid using tables to format text columns. 
Make sure cell-by-cell reading order makes sense for tabular data. 
I would like to see an example where a Table is made with a navigation bar on the left and text in on right where one cell is used. 
Please see my discussion below. 
I feel this would clarify something (navbars and text) that is commonly used. 
I see navbars widely used and they are used in conjuction with multiple text columns and rows. 
For an example, see www.dol.gov http://www.dol.gov 
Please feel free to contact if anyone would like to discuss this further. 
Many thanks, Rob Neff US Mint - Robert Neff This discussion should really happen on the GL list, not here. 
I think as a rule, we should only put in this card things that really stable in the guidelines. 
In 9. we might find a shorter version of: Organize tabular data to make sense when read cell by 
cell. 
Perhaps: Make cell by cell reading of tabular data sensible. 
rob neff I hate to be a stickler for redundant conversation on 
this. How 
are we providing input to people who use tables that have two 
columns? 
The 
example I use is Table Width is 600 Pixels. 
Left column is 150 and 
contains 
navigation bars. 
Right Column is 450 and uses the cell width to 
contain the 
text. 
When I discuss with people the need to not use tables to format 
text, then 
the next question is what about tables with navigation bars. 
Designers can 
understand not using tables to format tables, but what about 
navigation bars 
in HTML 3.2. 
As this is heavily used, these people need to be 
provided more 
concrete direction. 
Please note that I do not see "in HTML 4" as the appropriate 
answer, 
because, intranets and internets are using HTML 3.2 and some will 
not go to 
IE 4. So I need to stress, HTML 3.2 is the bridge for at least 
another 
year. 
If you need more proof, some government offices will not go 
to HTML 
because they do not have the disk space for all computers and some 
have 
security fears for IE 4. Like it or not, this is the environment. 
On our just released redesign, I took out tables which also 
decreased 
download time, except for when the servers are slow - which is 
almost always  at my former job frown

P.S. The internet web site, www.usmint.gov 
http://www.usmint.gov , is not universally accessible 
and we will be starting a redesign soon to address these issues, 
but it 
takes time. 
Rob, I'm not sure what you are asking for. 
I looked at dol.gov and although it uses a TABLE to do a column layout, it does so in a way that permit a graceful degradation when the table is linearized (actually, ignored, as with lynx). 
So it complies with the guidelines and the tips: 
We say "Avoid" in the tips, rather than "Don't" because it's a legacy situation: people with user agents that can linearize table (such as Opera, Lynx, WebSpeak, EmacsSpeak, Mosaic, etc) are just fine, but people with user agent or combination of UA and assistive technology that can only layout your data in columns are getting non-sensical information ala: Quick Guide Most of us know more about DOL Agencies the TV drama 'ER' than we do etc which requires them to jump to the line by guessing when the column actually ends (like, right after Quick Guide) 
by "complies" I really meant "do not break any P1". which is just my personal definition. 
GL: Please see the correspondence below, first my message then Charles McCathieNevile's comments with my original comment. 
This concerns using "tables with navbars" versus not using "tables to format text". 
I feel we are sending mixed messages and if "tables with navbars" as described below are not acceptable, then just about everyone in the Federal Government and commercial world is not in-line with the soon to be published guidelines. 
For the benefit of designers who are designing web sites and who also redesigning web sites, I respectfully request a response. 
I feel this is an area where we need to clarify the WAI's position. 
Very Truly Yours, Robert Neff Rob, can you forward your message to the GL group, since I think you raise a valid point. 
You could also add my 2c worth which is as follows: It is there because you can tell people not to use tabless for layout until you are blue in the face. 
It won't stop them. 
So if they are going to, they could at least try to solve the other problems. 
I agree with you that we may be sending out mixed messages, thereby priveliging the wrong one. 
Charles Understand. 
Then why is this stated as such in the Page Authoring GL, "If a table is used for layout, do not use any structural markup for the purpose of visual formatting. 
wai-pageauth-tech.html#tech-table-layout 
For example, in HTML do not use the table header (TH) element to cause the contents of a cell to be displayed centered and in bold. 
Other attributes of a table, such as a caption describing the layout purpose and content of columns is valuable, particularly if some cells become navbars, frames, images, imagemaps, or lists of links. 
[Priority 1] " If I am interpreting this properly, then they are stating that it is ok to use tables for these (navbars, frames, images, imagemaps ) but don't use any structural markup for the purpose of visual formatting. 
I think a stand should be taken so as not to confuse the audience. 
These are questions I am being asked and maybe have convoluted this? 
Could use some help here, rob -----Original Message----- The fact that it is a navbar rather than a columnar paragraph does Not change the problem, which is that the screen is read one whole line (or as near as the reader can get) at a time, so the links are interspersed apparently at random into the text. 
I don't mind seeing it, but having it read to me makes life difficult. 
Charles. 
I would like to see an example where a Table is made with a navigation bar on the left and text in on right where one cell is used. 
Please see my discussion below. 
I feel this would clarify something (navbars and text) that is commonly used.
