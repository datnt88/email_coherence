Hello - I've been looking through this mailing list archives about EARL. 
It seems that it is what we might adopt in our project. 
That is generating an output from Bobby and HTML Validator that can be machine readable (like stored in a database and so on ...). 
So far I know that I need to read about XML, RDF and Notation 3. I have a little knowledge of XML but that's all ! 
I don't have to much time, so could anyone tell me where can I find some documentation about it ? 
I know that on the W3C web site are a lot of recommendations and I have been using the ones referring to HTML and CSS and I think that they are great (structure and content). 
So if u could tell me exactly which one should I read it would be WONDERFUL ! 
:) Thanks a lot - Carmen 
Hi, You don't need to know anything about N3 unless you want to read the eamples that we swap in email - it is just a form of RDF that is easy to write by hand. 
What you need is to understand RDF model (the concept part of the RDF Model and Syntax specification) - http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-rdf-syntax - and the EARL properties and model - http://www.w3.org/2001/03/earl - and look through the examples to see what needs to be generated (at the moment - we are still using a draft, and might change the vocabulary when we have more implementation experience). 
There are a bunch of tools around that can do things like manipulating and storing RDF (EARL is an RDF vocabulary, and not a very big one) - information is available from the RDF page - http://www.w3.org/RDF/ (at least I think that is enough) Can you tell us a bit more about the project?

Thanks for the reply ! 
I am a postgraduate student and I am doing my masters in Web Accessibility in R.I.N.C.E. - D.C.U. (Research Institute for Networks and Communications Engineering - Dublin City University) We are 2 students working on this research project. 
A part of this project is to see the accessibility of some web sites in Ireland. 
Well... now we are more concerned about our university web site ! 
:)) We are using Bobby and HTML Validator to test the web sites. 
And we have to keep evidence of all these reports. 
Now I am trying to find a way to make a script (or more) to do that. 
I saw the mails about EARL and I thought that it sounds good. 
I'll start looking on the references that you sent me. 
Thanks again for them.
