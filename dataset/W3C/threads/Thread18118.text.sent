Hello, In the 29 September draft [1], checkpoint 8.7 reads: 8.7 Provide a mechanism for highlighting and identifying (through a standard interface where available) the current viewport, selection, and content focus. 
I'd like to propose the following simplification: 8.7 Provide a mechanism for highlighting the current viewport, selection, and content focus. 
Here's why: 1) I'm not sure what "identification" means. 
I think it means "provide a selection mechanism", which is covered by checkpoint 8.6 2) The new version of 8.7 is only about highlighting through the UI. Checkpoints 5.4 and 5.5 cover communication of selection and focus information through an API. 
Checkpoint 5.4 covers the "standard interface" requirement. 
Therefore, I think the change simplifies 8.7 and all requirements are still covered.

In this case less is more.
