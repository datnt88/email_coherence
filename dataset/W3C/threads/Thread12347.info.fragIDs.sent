<s> unquote i don't know how quote still-rather-radical unquote the notion that we live in a society where persons with disabilities are regarded with both fear and loathing is -- during the lead up to, and during the week of, the tenth anniversary of the americans with disabilities act (ADA), there were a rash of stories on the radio and in other media on how much of an effect the ADA has had on disabled individuals... the universal consensus was that, while a veneer of accessibility has been laid over public places (braille in elevators, for example, when less than thirty percent of the blind in the U.S. read braille), while it may be easier to get to some places and have some services provided in a suitable (TTY information lines, braille bills, etc.), there are 2 major obstacles still to be overcome: 1. fear and loathing (a lot of it, it is true, is based on a simple [some say instinctive] fear-of-the-other, but quite a lot of it based on a lack of exposure to or interaction with persons with disabilities, as well as plain old ignorance, indifference, and disdain) 2. the inadequacy of the cookie cutter approach to the provision of reasonable accommodations (such as: "why are you complaining?  </s>

<s> i know that i've already given y'all my ha'penny's worth, but now that i think of it, there isn't much difference between braille on the keypad connected to a touch screen kiosk without voice output and an alternate means of input (such as chording the keypad or using something more technologically sophisticated), and a user agent/browser/authoring tool's browser-emulation mode which exposes ALT text, but limits the real estate accorded for the rendering of the ALT text to the absolute measurements defined by the author _for the graphic_ -- ALT text is meaningless (at least in the GUI environment) if it can't be expanded (what's the old rule of thumb, if you can't see it, it ain't there?) the user MUST have control over the way that ALT text is rendered (i.e. size, font, foreground and background colors, etc.) so that it is displayed in whatever manner best suits that individual user -- some, for example, may want the same rules they've defined/set for the display of elements to be inherited by any ALT text contained in that element, while others may want to distinguish ALT text from other text in a way that is meaningful to them -- whether the rendering is being performed by an authoring tool or a user agent; otherwise, a lot of people are only seeing part of the picture, as it where, especially as i do not believe it to be a common behavior for user agents to expose ALT text in a ToolTip if image loading is turned off onMouseOver of the partially exposed ALT text ... gregory  </s>
