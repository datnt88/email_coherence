<s> Hi, In XPathEvaluator interface, the the method evaluate has last argument 'result' of type XPathResult.  </s>
<s> The spec says: "*result of type XPathResult* The /result /specifies a specific XPathResult which may be reused and returned by this method.  </s>
<s> If this is specified as nullnor the implementation cannot reuse the specified result, a new XPathResult will be constructed and returned."  </s>
<s> What does term *reuse *mean in evaluate function?  </s>
<s> Does it mean that evaluate method will resuse /result /parameter to refine the result object or something else?  </s>
<s> It means that the evaluate method may reuse the result parameter as the result object.  </s>

<s> Thats what i understood from the spec.  </s>
<s> But i am not finding info on: * How does result object passed as parameter be reused by the evaluate function?  </s>
<s> I mean can it be used by the application for iterative evaluation?  </s>
<s> * Is the *reuse *of result object is implementation dependant?  </s>
<s> * In *Issue XPath-30*, the Resolution says for some use case it may be required.  </s>
<s> Is there anywhere i can find more info?  </s>
<s> * The purpose of reuse of XPathResult is that, for efficiency, your implementation may be able to reuse a previously-created object instead of creating a new one.  </s>
<s> A number of implementers thought this was important.  </s>
<s> Others thought it was not important.  </s>
<s> It is implementation-dependent whether the evaluate method reuses and returns the passed-in XPathResult (if any) or creates a new one.  </s>
<s> In the official last-call issues list for DOM Level 3 XPath, there is no Issue-30.  </s>
<s> The use case for which people want to use it is the one described above, that I marked with *.  </s>
<s> For example: var result = null; var i = 0; for (i = 0; i  e.length; i++) { result = e.evaluate(expression[i], mynode, 0, resolver, result); In this type of a loop, an implementation that can easily reuse a result object would only create a single result instead of creating one every time evaluate was called.  </s>
<s> An implementation is free, however to reuse all, some, or none of the results passed to it.  </s>
<s> In some implementation, therefore, result would be a different object each time the loop was executed.  </s>
<s> Or an implementation may choose to only reuse the result when the resultType was the same, etc.  </s>
<s> If we are not going to rely on normal deallocation / allocation every time, the application is the only one to know when the result might be reused, which is why the application has to pass it in as a parameter for reuse for implementations to reuse it if they so choose.  </s>
<s> I hope that this is helpful.  </s>
