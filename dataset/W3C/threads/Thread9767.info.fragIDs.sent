<s> Can someone remind me what we decided about whether literals were resources or not?  </s>
<s> Specifically, I'm trying to revise a sentence in the  </s>
<s> Primer that says:  </s>
<s> "All classes are implicitly subclasses of class rdfs:Resource (since the instances belonging to all classes are resources)" against which there is a question concerning rdfs:Literal.  </s>
<s> Thanks. --Frank Frank Manola The MITRE Corporation 202 Burlington Road, MS A345 Bedford, MA 01730-1420  </s>
<s> Actually it kind of follows from the MT that simple literals must be resources, since 1. they denote themselves, and 2. anything that is denoted must be a resource.  </s>
<s> Typed literals are another kettle of fish, of course.  </s>
<s> There shouldnt be.  </s>
<s> Anything that can be in a class must be a resource.  </s>

<s> This seems to me to mean that the following holds  </s>
<s> rdfs:Literal rdfs:subClassOf rdfs:Resource .  </s>
<s> which I guess I'm OK with, given the current definition of literals (typed or otherwise).  </s>
<s> Perhaps that should be explicitly stated in the semantics doc?  </s>
<s> Patrick  </s>
<s> Well, all such subClassOfs and rdf:type's which refer to rdfs:Resource are omitted, since they are all vacuous.  </s>
<s> Everything has type resource and (hence) every class is a subclass of resource.  </s>

<s> Well, see my comments about the text in the Vocabulary doc about rdf:object.  </s>
<s> It seems to presume that rdfs:Literal and rdfs:Resource are disjunct.  </s>
<s> If they are not, then that text (and possibly other text) needs to be adjusted accordingly.  </s>
<s> Yes, this text has my mind reeling.  </s>
<s> My understanding of the reification vocabulary was that the rdf:subject and rdf:object of a reified triple were the things that the subject and object of the original triple denoted.  </s>
<s> In which case the rdf:object is always a literal VALUE rather than the literal itself, so yes, indeed, it can be said to be in rdfs:Resource.  </s>
<s> So the range is rdfs:Resource, and  </s>
<s> this should be altered.  </s>

<s> The vocab doc needs work.  </s>
<s> It will get it.  </s>

<s> Right.  </s>
<s> The point was simply to confirm that we all agree that rdfs:Literal rdfs:subClassOf rdfs:Resource .  </s>
<s> and secondly, if that's the case, that perhaps the MT should say so explicitly.  </s>
<s> Patrick  </s>
<s> There is now a sentence about subsets of rdfs:Resource generally, in section 3.3: Since ICEXT(I(rdfs:Resource)) is the universe, everything has rdfs:Resource as an rdf:type value, and every class is a subclass of rdfs:Resource.Such assertions would be redundant, therefore.  </s>
<s> Similarly, some domain and range assertions are omitted from the above table; in those cases, the domain or range of the property may be taken to be rdfs:Resource, i.e. the universe; such range and domain assertions are essentially vacuous.  </s>
