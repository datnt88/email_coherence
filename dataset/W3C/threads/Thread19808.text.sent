* ' ' or ''; Stand-alone ' ' characters in text are left as-is when Amaya saves it to a file. 
Unfortunately Word 97 treats this as an invalid character when reading HTML. 
I now found the place where the conversion from ' ' to '' should occur, and created a patch (which is attached to this mail). 
I didn't manage to compile Amaya on my Linux machine, so I cannot check if this fix is O.K., but it looks streight-forward. 
In reality this 'bug' is in libwww, so I'm not sure whether I am reporting it to the right place or not. 
If not where else should I report this? 
Is it possible that this patch will be evaluated for inclusion in the next release of Amaya ? 
Or, even better, in the next release of libwww.

There is no need to escape ' ' characters in HTML.

This is not an Amaya bug but a Word bug. 
Anyway, if you plan to change that in Amaya, the libwww is not the right place to do it; Amaya doesn't use this part of libwww code. 
If you accept to rebuild your Amaya version the right place is in the source file Thot/amaya/Text_SGML.inc which lists SGML encoding translations. 
We, Amaya team, don't plan to integrate this patch because other Amaya users could disagree with that.
