<s> Hello all, Regardless of how an unparsed entity is indicated, a copy of the entity must be brought into the XML document.  </s>
<s> XFDL uses base 64 encoding to transform unparsable entities into character content for inclusion in the hash value.  </s>
<s> It is important to capture non-human-readable resources such as images in the hash as an essential part of capturing the context leading to a signature.  </s>
<s> The user does not see start tags, attributes, and character content.  </s>
<s> In a legal sense, a user who affixes a digital signature is authorizing that *what they are looking at* is correct.  </s>
<s> It is necessary to combine the input values given by the user with the questions asked, foreground and background colors, fontinfo, images, GUI object locations, etc.  </s>
<s> A repudiation argument could then include graphically rendering the hashed message.  </s>
<s> Here's an example.  </s>
<s> Suppose we didn't include images in the signature.  </s>
<s> This could be the image that tiles the background, the image of the company logo, the image that shows which credit card will be used, a drawing or picture of what is being negotiated, etc. Removing the image can directly alter the meaning of the transaction, and it is even possible to have indirect consequences.  </s>
<s> For example, not having the image could cause other objects whose positions are based on the image's bounding rectangle to change positions.  </s>
<s> This could alter the meaning of the agreement.  </s>
<s> If only a reference to the object is kept, then the object can never be moved.  </s>
<s> If it does, then changing the reference breaks the signature.  </s>

<s> Hi Donald,  </s>
<s> All the world is not a form see by a human being.  </s>
<s> Many uses or potential uses of XML DSIG are for protocol messages, such as in IOTP or eCheck, where internal structures are being signed.  </s>
<s> Later messages are frequently constructed containing some pieces and signatures from previous messages (which particularly motivates canonicalization in some cases).  </s>
<s> The form is a useful paradigm in terms of getting human developers to understand the problems that may arise in systems which are not forms based.  </s>
<s> I use the form example because, A) I'm good at it, and B) everybody understands it.  </s>
<s> But transaction non-repudiation is transaction non-repudiation regardless of how you choose to represent the transaction.  </s>
<s> You either have or you do not have sufficient information to make assertions about the nature of a transaction.  </s>
<s> According to the digital signature guidelines of the American Bar Association, a digital signature provides authentication and authorization.  </s>
<s> It authorizes that a given signer intends for the transaction to have a legal effect.  </s>
<s> If we cannot accurately say what the transaction was, then the digital signature does not achieve its essential purposes.  </s>
<s> Also, based on your other email to me, let me reiterate that I've been talking all along about the ability to sign parts of the document.  </s>
<s> Multiple overlapping signatures using signature filters, inclusion versus exclusion of elements (be they form elements, structure elements, or whatever two parties mutually decide represents a transaction).  </s>
<s> The basic signature structures have to be able to sign things that are  </s>
<s> sometimes  </s>
<s> present and sometimes absent.  </s>
<s> You can't sign it if it is absent.  </s>
<s> Furthermore, how can two parties agree on it being part of a transaction if it is absent?  </s>
<s> How can they resolve a dispute about the nature of the transaction if a component necessary for the interpretation of the transaction is absent?  </s>
<s> Although it happens in the paper world (e.g. not actually reading the fine print), it is at least supposed to be the case that we don't sign if we don't see the whole agreement.  </s>
<s> With respect to signature filters, we can't write a generic XML syntax that prevents the developer from excluding essential pieces of an agreement (because this requires an understanding of semantics, and XML doesn't have that understanding).  </s>
<s> But we can do our best to understand how signed XML will get applied and try to make behaviors that result in good signatures within the body of XML applications that we can envision.  </s>
<s> If it is desired that something be bound into a signature, it suffices to include its hash.  </s>
<s> It does not always suffice, as you point out below, and which is the only real point I'm trying to make.  </s>
<s> Whether you also need the original bits is application dependent.  </s>
<s> It depends on whether you want to provide and prove the original message or merely be able to prove there was a message and disprove false claims about its contents.  </s>
<s> OK, so now I think we are agreeing.  </s>
<s> It is necessary for a signed XML spec to include the ability to incorporate externally defined/unparsed entities achieving transaction non-repudiation.  </s>

<s> John, I am certainly pushing a bit too far but, considering the lack of conformity in the rendering of document by commercial browsers, I feel that you'd better save a copy of the user-agent along with the transaction.  </s>
<s> The point is that in most circumstances, signing at the presentation layer does not make a lot of sense or, at least, does not increase the overall security of the system.  </s>
<s> For form signing by human being, I would rather propose signature of the message semantics and ensure the reliability and conformity of the user-agent (i.e. plug-ins or style sheet).  </s>
<s> As we already do with smart card readers, it shall be possible to require authentication of the user-agent in the signature process.  </s>
<s> This is certainly a requirement, which is actually considered by the Digital Signature for XML Proposal.  </s>
<s> However, the ability to package external/unparsed entities does not imply that the Signature Standard shall require compliant implementations to "chase" such external entities.  </s>
<s> This only implies that the Signature Standard should allow authentication of packaged entities.  </s>
<s> Chasing and embedding such external entities in the signed document shall fall under the responsibility of the application framework that defines such a requirement in the first place.  </s>
<s> Sincerely, Richard D. Brown  </s>
