It has been a while since we didn't publish a new version of the Core draft. 
This new version contains almost our current state of thoughts regarding the Core module: New bits: - Merged DOM Level 2 Core and DOM Level 3 Core. 
- prefix/namespaceURI resolution algorithm - normalizeNS algorithm - Merged Embedded DOM and Core (section 1.1.10): 
* Improved Java bootstrapping for Embedded DOM * Embedded DOM function on Node interface (getAs) We are still working on a full conformance with the Infoset, especially for Namespace nodes. 
Next version should contain the complete mapping. 
Some issues from this mailing list are still on our agenda: default attributes, attribute value normalization, setNodeName, lots of clarifications... Feel free to send a reminder if your issue is not addressed yet. 
Philippe Are you ever going to combine all the drafts into one document? 
It makes it difficult to navigate around the multitude of drafts having them all in different pages.

There is a PDF version which contains the whole draft. 
I guess the question really was: "are you ever going to combine all the DOM specifications into one document?" 
The appropriate response is: no, we have no plan to combine them. 
The document would be too big. 
If you're really looking for it, I suggest to take the XML sources, change one of the main documents as appropriate and regenerate a document using the DOM generator.
