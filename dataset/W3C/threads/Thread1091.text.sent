I just downloaded HTML-KIT build 292 and have some TIDY problems that did not occur in build 290. 
I received error and warning messages in JavaScript code that is being interpreted as HTML. 
Do you have any suggestions? 
Below is sample code. 
!-- function MM_preloadImages() { //v3.0 var d=document; if(d.images){ if(!d.MM_p) d.MM_p=new Array(); var i,j=d.MM_p.length,a=MM_preloadImages.arguments; for(i=0; i a.length; i++) if (a[i].indexOf("#")!=0){ d.MM_p[j]=new Image; d.MM_p[j++].src=a[i];}} 
function MM_findObj(n, d) { //v4.01 var p,i,x; if(!d) d=document; if((p=n.indexOf("?")) 0&amp;&amp;parent.frames.length) 
{ d=parent.frames[n.substring(p+1)].document; 
n=n.substring(0,p);} if(!(x=d[n])&amp;&amp;d.all) x=d.all[n]; for (i=0;!x&amp;&amp;i d.forms.length;i++) 
x=d.forms[i][n]; for(i=0;!x&amp;&amp;d.layers&amp;&amp;i d.layers.length;i++) 
x=MM_findObj(n,d.layers[i].document); 
if(!x &amp;&amp; d.getElementById) x=d.getElementById(n); return x; //-- Hello world Below are errors and warnings: ' ' + '/' + letter not allowed here unescaped &amp; which should be written as &amp;amp; unescaped &amp; or unknown entity "&amp;parent.frames.length" 
unescaped &amp; or unknown entity "&amp;i" In regards to this question, is it good HTML practice to escape all your script tags with a CDATA markers? 
I started doing my script tags like the following /* ![CDATA[*/ /*]] */ If this is incorrect, please let me know. 
I was in the process of trying to conform more to the standards and I read somewhere that you should escape your Script sections with the CDATA directive. 
Below I am showing the doctype I used... !DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" HYPERLINK "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd" html xmlns=" HYPERLINK "http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="en" lang="en" Thanks.. Richard Norman P.S. When I sent the file to the validator, it ended up passing as valid...

When a DOCTYPE or HTML tag is included, the text gets chopped for some reason. 
Those are legitimate warnings. 
If you have an end tag within a SCRIPT element, you should escape it. 
E.g. document.write( 
" p foo \/p " ); Note the \/p . 
Also, in URLS, you should use the &amp;amp; character entity to represent URL argument delimiters. 
E.g. take it easy, Charlie This is a known bug, see http://tidy.sf.net/bug/630990 No, script and style are already CDATA in HTML. 
Using XHTML, you need them if your script or style element contains markup characters, i.e. any of "]] ", "&amp;" or " ", but you should use external scripts/styles if it contains them, thus, CDATA sections are never good practise. 
The only thing to add is that you can fix your document by adding a space after your "less than" operators. 
Change: for(i=0;!x&amp;&amp;d.layers&amp;&amp;i d.layers.length;i++) 
To: for(i=0;!x&amp;&amp;d.layers&amp;&amp;i  d.layers.length;i++)
