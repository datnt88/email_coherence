<s> Hello, Would there be any chance that the node tree traversal methods in the Node interface be deprecated and sent to some sort of work camp for bunk code patterns?  </s>
<s> It seems to me that NodeIterator could handily replace them and be much more efficient for most implementations.  </s>
<s> The aggregate/iterator pattern is pretty standard these days (C++ STL, Java JGL, Java 1.2 Collections, etc.) [See Gamma et al] and is not only easy to use but implementing it is a snap!  </s>
<s> IMHO the following methods can be summarily deprecated: Node.getFirstChild() Node.getPreviousSibling() Node.getNextSibling()  </s>
<s> Also, I saw some previous posts requesting that reference counting be somehow tacked on to the DOM.  </s>
<s> I vote no on that.  </s>
<s> Thanks, Claude Zervas, UTL Co., Seattle  </s>
<s> This "bunk code pattern" is well-beloved by untold generations of SGML weenies ;~) who would prefer to deprecate the idea of used indexed arrays to represent document structures.  </s>
<s> It's a dilemma for us -- there's no single acceptable paradigm for document structuring and navagation that we've been able to find, and we don't want to bloat the spec by supporting everything, and (while I happen to agree with you about the iterator design pattern) iterators are not supported in any of the legacy APIs from which we're trying to build.  </s>
<s> Mike Champion  </s>
<s> Ok. I'm not really familiar with the legacy APIs and how much current software depends on them so I was a little hasty in condemning them.  </s>
<s> Thanks for the clarification.  </s>
<s> But I would still like to know if the Attribute interface should inherit from Node or not because Element.getAttributes() is very handy but since it returns a NodeIterator (in the current spec)  </s>
<s> I'm kind of confused.  </s>
<s> I'm assuming there is a typo either in the declaration of the Attribute interface or in the declaration of Element.getAttributes() but I can't know which.  </s>
<s> Kent Tamura's (IBM) implementation of Attribute inherits from Node but this may just be to facilitate the implementation.  </s>
<s> Am I missing something here?  </s>
<s> The prose is pretty unhelpful on this, it mentions "attrubute node"  </s>
<s> but does not explicitly state or show inheritance of Node.  </s>
<s> Anyway, I'd like to thank all the folks at W3C for putting in the work to get the DOM out!  </s>
<s> Thanks, Claude Zervas, UTL Co., Seattle  </s>
<s> This was a typo.  </s>
<s> Give us a week; there's a face to face DOM WG meeting coming up, and this will be resolved.  </s>
<s> My best guess is that individual attributes will continue to be Nodes, the set of attributes will be a NodeList with associative array semantics (or AttributeList).  </s>
<s> To answer your question in another message, the whole point of AttributeList is to provide associative array semantics so that attributes can be looked up by name.  </s>
<s> NamedNodeList was once used as the name for this, but we found that attributes were the only objects that needed these semantics.  </s>
<s> Mike Champion  </s>
<s> Ok, but NamedNodeList is used all over the place in HTML DOM and Arnaud Le Hors says that AttributeList is archaic (now basically just a typo).  </s>
<s> I have the feeling that there is severe disagreement among y'all at W3C over DOM collection models.  </s>
<s> Some sort of simple and clean  </s>
<s> way is needed to traverse node trees that can also be *efficiently* implemented by a DOM vendor.  </s>
<s> This is clear.  </s>
<s> I think level one DOM needs to solve this otherwise users will find other solutions (ie non-standard extensions a la Microsoft).  </s>
<s> The NodeIterator is easy to implement, easy to use, and can be adapted over or to existing collection models (JGL, STL, etc).  </s>
<s> NodeList is less useful because you still need an iteration mechanism and it does not lend itself to associative collections because of the indexed access method ( NodeList.item( int n ) ).  </s>
<s> I think that any mechanism that limits or overly complicates implementation will cause a proliferation of non-standard implementations which will, in the end, just limit the spread of DOM use.  </s>
<s> And a DOM that lacks key features such as a clear node traversal model will end up the same way.  </s>
<s> I would suggest three basic interfaces for a collection model: NodeList, NodeMap, and NodeIterator.  </s>
<s> - NodeList more or less what it is now.  </s>
<s> - NodeMap would be the associative collection.  </s>
<s> It should not have to implement NodeList.item()  </s>
<s> however - instead the user should use a NodeIterator.  </s>
<s> - NodeIterator would, of course, be a way to traverse *any* collection of nodes and should be the preferred way to access DOM nodes.  </s>
<s> I won't write any IDL here because its obvious what the interfaces would look like and this message is already pretty dang long-winded.  </s>
<s> And, lastly, the HTML DOM should use the ***same*** model as the core!  </s>
<s> What is it with the HTML guys anyway?  </s>
<s> BTW, thanks for your replies to my questions!  </s>
<s> Regards, - Claude Zervas  </s>
<s> P.S. I don't really understand what Mr. ANOQ of the Sun is suggesting about AttributeLists...  </s>
<s> P.P.S. People are already using the draft spec for implementations so the need for a speedy resolution can't be over emphasized.  </s>
<s> Claude,  </s>
<s> Gee, what makes you think that?  </s>
<s> g  </s>
<s> Since I have implemented NodeIterator several times already, I can definitely say that NodeIterator, as it stands now, is NOT easy to implement.  </s>
<s> I do prefer NodeIterator over all other methods but implementation options are severely limited if current design is adopted.  </s>
<s> BTW, STL is not thread-safe last time I checked and JGL is not very efficient IMHO.  </s>
<s> Just a few million users and about hundred thousand lines of code just waiting to enter alpha, I believe.  </s>
<s> I got projects left and right just waiting for the DOM API to settle down which I hope will happen after the June WG meeting.  </s>
<s> The problem is that people like us are part of the problem: implementing before the standard.  </s>
<s> The dog is running backward with its tail swing madly ahead.  </s>
<s> The good news is that Microsoft and Netscape folks are hanging onto the tail with the rest of us.  </s>
<s> The bad news is that hindsight makes poor foresight.  </s>
<s> All we can do is pucker up and hope for the best.  </s>
<s> Best wishes, Don  </s>
<s> I guess it can be a little hard to imagine just from the IDL interface and my quickly written descriptions... But which parts didn't you understand?  </s>
<s> I will gladly elaborate.  </s>
<s> I just know from Delphi, that this kind of architecture really _kicks ass_!  </s>
