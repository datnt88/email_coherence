<s> This assumes that you have access to the processing, and that it does indeed use this system.  </s>
<s> but it is possible to use arbitrary code, for example to convert the coordinates on a map into latitude/longitude pairs.  </s>
<s> I suspect this is more like what happens for mapping sites, which are one of the legitimate uses for server-side maps that I can see (i.e. it is rather difficult to convert them to client side maps).  </s>
<s> In general, for applications where there is a dynamic interpretation you might not be able to do a straightforward conversion and may need to rethink the process.  </s>
<s> In fact I also think that this conversion technique is a WCAG technique really (which is just to say that it is more broadly useful than just ER tools).  </s>

<s> I performed a couple of tests in IE5 and Netscape 4.7 and they both support image map area rectangles of 1 pixel (e.g. 10,10,11,11).  </s>
<s> Empty rectangles (e.g. 10,10,10,10) did not seem to work.  </s>
<s> So it is possible to convert the server-side image map 'point' over to a client-side 'rect'.  </s>

<s> As Chaalz noted, this only solves the problem if someone is using those specific types of image map software and if the file is available to the repair tool.  </s>
<s> In a number of other cases this will not be true and thus this is only a partial solution.  </s>
<s> However, it's a somewhat workable incomplete solution.  </s>
<s> Only problem  </s>

<s> How would you generate this from a server-side map?  </s>

<s> "live" areas and hence of alt texts for them is of course in general meaningless for a serverside map] This could use a technique I am proposing to deal with TITLE and ALT attributes (possibly also more obscure things such as LONGDESC).  </s>
<s> The repair software will keep a lookup table of URL - title (easy) and URL - alt (more problematic).  </s>
<s> When it encounters a missing alt or title, it will first look them up, and enter them in the page if found.  </s>
<s> The interesting part of this is how to populate the database.  </s>
<s> In the case of TITLE there's often an easy way: for every link to an HTML document, use the TITLE of the target.  </s>
<s> For ALT, and for TITLE in the case of non-textual documents, it will make *provisional* entries in the database whenever it encounters any link having credible values for the attribute, and will use these thereafter in the absence of anything better.  </s>
<s> Going back to the specific case of an imagemap, wherever it links to an HTML document, the TITLE of the target could be suggested also as an ALT value.  </s>
<s> I will implement at least this TITLE repair in the Site Valet in the not too distant future.  </s>
<s> But it's also part of an altogether more exciting proposal, about which I will try and get around to posting in due course.  </s>

<s> Kynn, Yes, the conversion algorithm I described is only a partial solution.  </s>
<s> Server-side processing of image maps may be quite different from the processing of client-side image maps and a 'map' file may not be used at all.  </s>
<s> Yup, the server-side 'map' file has no ALT text so you must get it from the user.  </s>
<s> With A-Prompt we do ask the user for ALT text after doing the conversion to a client side map.  </s>
