<s> Hi, Amaya is based on a generic tool.  </s>
<s> So, as explained in to build compilers then compile generic files.  </s>
<s> After that you can go into the Amaya work space and build the application.  </s>

<s> I downloaded the NT version of the source code.  </s>
<s> I tried to build compilers project/workspace using .dsp/.dsw.  </s>
<s> When compiling compilers.rc it complained that resource.h is missing.  </s>
<s> Adding \amaya\amaya\amaya to the resource include directory path successfully included resource.h but now I am getting an error 'Undefined keyword : COMP_OPEN and COMP_COMPILE.  </s>
<s> Is it because I am including the wrong resource.h  </s>
<s> file and I am missing the correct version of it?  </s>
<s> Also I am using MSVC++ 5.0 and not 6.0.  </s>
<s> Is this a problem?  </s>
<s> Thanks, siva  </s>
<s> I had this problem originally and could only fix it by downloading the CVS version.  </s>

<s> You're right the file resource.h  </s>

<s> Could you check with the new tar file http://www.w3.org/Amaya/Distribution/amaya-src-2.5.tgz Irene.  </s>
