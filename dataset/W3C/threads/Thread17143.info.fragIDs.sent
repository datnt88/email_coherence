<s> The BBC's text only content quality and findability is rather variable, e.g., there are no links to it from some of the World Service transcripts, even though the pages exist, and, because the main pages have a very narrow central column, are more suitable for printing.  </s>
<s> The BBC also suffers because the text only page is only a mechanical transformation of the graphical page.  </s>
<s> Generally, it depends on individual authors being aware of the issues, and this awareness drops off the further you get away from the centre of the organisation.  </s>
<s> I've found that ukonline is a very poor shadow of the original open.gov.uk, which it replaces.  </s>
<s> I had to resort to Google to find a departmental site, because the necessary indexing doesn't exist - even the last resort of going to the site map produced only a minimal document.  </s>
<s> This would have been relatively easy on the old open.gov.uk site.  </s>
<s> At the moment I'd treat it as a dumbed down graphical site with a token text alternative.  </s>
<s> My own view is that it shows the bad effects of governmental organisations outsourcing to big commercial web site designers.  </s>
<s> Why not go to Google and check out their news linkk?  </s>
<s> You probably have a better chance at finding what you want by searching for a newsire, since all the commercial news web sites are pretty graphics-intensive, and few provide a text-only alternative that I have ever found.  </s>
<s> Of course, it is easy to miss such a thing when there are a few hundred links and graphics all smooshed on one page.  </s>
<s> Come to think of it, Salon.com is pretty low-graphics.  </s>
