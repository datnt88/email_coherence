Pat, It's late, but are we missing 0a | xxx aaa yyy. 
| xxx rdf:type rdfs:Resource. 
| 0b | xxx aaa yyy. 
| aaa rdf:type rdfs:Resource. 
| 0c | xxx aaa yyy. 
| yyy rdf:type rdfs:Resource. 
| or not? 
If yes, that would mean that LV is a subset of IR (the trouble is to express the "IR union LV" in the consequent) Jos De Roo, AGFA http://www.agfa.com/w3c/jdroo/ 
Jos, you are basically right, thanks for catching it. 
I've found a patch (detailed below) and put up a version of the document with this fix (and the fix to rule 9) at Dan, can we can go to press with this version, or is it too late?? 
Pat Hmm. 
I had thought that this was all derivable, but I see that maybe it is not. 
0b is, I think: 1: xxx aaa yyy. 
2: aaa type property . 
(1, rule 1) 3: property type class . 
(2, rule 7) 4: property subclass Resource (3, rule 8) 5: aaa type Resource (2, 4, rule 11) but one can do this for the others only if you can infer that they are in a class, and of course they may not be. 
If nothing is said about classes or the range and domain of aaa (which would provide another path using rules 5 and 6, then 7 etc., then as above) then I think the rules would be stuck. 
Damn. 
They would have to be stated like rule 9b, using 'uuu' to rule out the literal case for yyy, and then I think this would not be required. 
Ah, just noticed, rule 9a should be stated NOT using uuu. 
I will change that. 
OK, heres my suggestion: expand rule 1 into 3 cases, like this: 1a xxx aaa yyy . 
-- xxx rdf:type rdfs:Resource . 
1b xxx aaa yyy . 
--- aaa rdf:type rdf:Property . 
1c xxx aaa uuu . 
--- uuu rdf:type rdfs:Resource . 
where 1b is the current rule 1 of course. 
OK with you?

Pat, I'm OK with just maybe the example following the table, wit added foo rdf:type rdfs:Resource. 
baz rdf:type rdfs:Resource. 
We now try to testcase by using http://www.agfa.com/w3c/euler/rdfsrules.n3 (which is not able to express uuu (not being a literal)) Jos no, it's not too late. 
I basically have not started. 
Dan Connolly, W3C http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/ Jos &amp; Pat appear to agree on: | 0c | xxx aaa yyy. 
| yyy rdf:type rdfs:Resource. 
| I don't. 
:-(. 
I had taken the position of the WG as being agnosticism as to whether Literals is-a-subset-of Resources or not. 
[Although looking back at a heated debate which I was not part of - it is unclear to me what the resolution was - no no no - don't restart that one]. 
This change appears to me to be unnecessary, particularly at this stage. 
The agreement of the teleconference was to publish the draft with minor editorial changes. 
I do not perceive this change as minor since it steps on a landmine. 
Hence I *OBJECT* to publication of a working draft including rule 1C from html?rev=1.4&amp;content-type=text/html#rdfsentail 
Sorry, &amp; I really want publication to go ahead, but without 0c/1C. 
[I am also aware that there are complications in these area even without rule 0c. 
I was waiting until after publication to start discussing those complications, since in my opinion, what we agree on is very worthy of publication, and raising hornet's nest will be more productive once we have the model theory out of the door.] 
Jeremy Oops - my mistake - I withdraw my objection. 
Jeremy Jeremy, that is indeed true, and I think the current MT is reflecting that position: 1c | xxx aaa uuu. 
| uuu rdf:type rdfs:Resource. 
| where uuu for any uriref or bNode (but not a literal). 
so 1c does,t apply for LV (and I had to know that and not cause the confusion with 0c, but I was biased by my implementation problerms,...) Jos | 0c | xxx aaa yyy. 
| yyy rdf:type rdfs:Resource. 
| Right, so do I. See below. 
I don't want to open this hornet's nest either. 
I think you will find that 1c is OK. 
It deliberately uses the form xxx aaa uuu . 
--- uuu rdf:type rdfs:Resource . 
where uuu is required to NOT be a literal, in order to block the case that you object to, and leave the question open. 
The rules already did this in places that would have produced a triple with a literal in the subject position, for just this reason. 
In any case this is required by N-triples syntax at the present: the form xxx rdf:type rdfs:Resource . is syntactically illegal, and hence not a triple, if xxx is a literal, right? 
I agree.

Good man. 
There are now three versions you can choose from: which has the example after the RDFS table fixed, as Jos suggested which only has the table fixed, and which is the old buggy version. 
If its still possible to choose, the first is better than the second.

I just grabbed that one and checked it in... $Id: rdf-mt.html,v 
1.10 2001/09/25 17:42:48 connolly Exp $ next step: set up this version/latest version, status, maybe change the TOC markup from &amp;nbsp; to real ol , ... Dan Connolly, W3C http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/ OK, done.
