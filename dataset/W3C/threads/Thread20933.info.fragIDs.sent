<s> Hello, Amaya team, Spaces in markup are significant.  </s>
<s> I have noticed Amaya adding spaces in the headlines on http://www.w3.org/.  </s>
<s> Is this something that could please be fixed?  </s>
<s> In the example below, the sequence " X" was intentional, but Amaya made it " \r X". h3 img alt="" width="17" height="11" src="/Icons/right" / XInclude Is a W3C Candidate Recommendation /h3 became: XInclude Is a W3C Candidate Recommendation /h3 Susan Lesch http://www.w3.org/People/Lesch/ World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) http://www.w3.org/  </s>
<s> Hello Susan, I'm looking at this bug.  </s>
<s> I have found a scenario to reproduce it but I still haven't found the reason.  </s>
<s> Unfortunately, I can reproduce it with the current version (8.4).  </s>
<s> I will discuss this problem with Irene.  </s>
<s> Thanks, Laurent  </s>
<s> Hello Susan, This bug has been fixed and we plan to make a snapshot shortly.  </s>
<s> Thanks, Laurent  </s>
<s> Hi, Question: Is the support of the white-space CSS property planned?  </s>
<s> RFE: The Amaya beaviour of deleting automatically multiple white-spaces is sometimes annoying.  </s>
<s> For instance, when I want to copy word1 over word2, I would like to double-clik the word1, copy it, double-click te word2 and paste, but Amaya deletes the space after the word2 and word1 is concatenated to the following word.  </s>
<s> I would prefer that multiple white-spaces were only deleted when the document is saved (with CSS white-space support, of course :-).  </s>
<s> Best regards, Bartolom?  </s>
<s> Sintes  </s>
<s> Hello Bartolome, Thanks for the report, the fix is available in the upcoming release.  </s>
