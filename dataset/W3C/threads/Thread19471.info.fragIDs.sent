Hi Everyone, I've been compiling Amaya the last couple days and have made little progress. 
I have the latest lesstif installed and I've gotten somw ways into amaya. 
Now I'm hitting a wall. 
Here's the output. 
Thanks for the help.

Hi Peter, 
It seems that you forgot to create the Thot/obj directory and go into this directory to star "../configure" See http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/Autoconf.html for more information Hope this helps Irene. 
I did that previously with the same result. 
I decided to try again from scratch and it failed again. 
I think I'm missing a source file. 
It looks like i'm missing HTMLAPPS.c . 
make may not be looking in the right place but I can't find that file anywere on my system ether. 
Here's the output. 
Thanks.

Hi Peter, HTMLAPPS.c is automatically generated while compiling Amaya. 
I guess that your problem comes from some dependencies between files. 
I think that you have to use following commands: make depend make amaya Ramzi.
