Part 1 of the recommendation leaves us with people that could say they are supporting two versions of the same user agent. 
I would recommend that we add something that strengthens the thought that the user agents must be from different vendors using different engines. 
Definitely we don't want people that say well it works in IE 5.5 and Jaw 3, which both use IE as the engine. 
Part 2 of the recommended success criteria still leaves us with developers that program for IE or developers that want to be so backward compatible that they will develop so everything works in Netscape 4.x. 
I'm still inclined to go with the "one version prior to the current version" because as we move forward in versions like Netscape 7 and Opera 7, due out this Autumn, and IE 7, due out early next year, we will find that the success criteria will call for more standards compliance and require the developers to meet those standards. 
As more user agents begin to support the standards, the Internet will become a better place and developers will have to comply with the standards. 
If we leave it open so that they can fall back on well IE 5.5 or Netscape 4.7 is still within the three year period there will be more problems as time goes by and become more costly to the organization trying to be compliant. 
Since, for example, Netscape 7's previous version would be Netscape 6 there would be no question as to which version Netscape 6 or Netscape 4.7 would be the previous version. 
I do concur witht the idea that we should require at least two user agents. 
I'm just concerned that with the broad term of user agents we are limiting what will be used for the baseline. 
As I mentioned the problem with IE being the engine for many user agents. 
Now, if JAWS and the other user agents were developed using a standards compliant engine like Mozilla everyone would be better off and accessibility would become an easier task to achieve for the higher success levels. 
Just my two cents. 
Sincerely, Lee Roberts Rose Rock Design, Inc. Building web sites accessible by EVERYONE [mailto:w3c-wai-gl-request@w3.org]On 
Behalf Of Jason White Part of the working group's consensus on checkpoint 5.2 was that success criteria would be drafted at level 2, specifying a stronger backward compatibility requirement. 
Here is my first attempt, reflecting ideas that have been raised previously on the mailing list and at teleconferences. 
You will have successfully met checkpoint 5.2 at level 2 if 1. 
The technologies and features below the baseline have been independently implemented in at least two user agents. 
2. At least two such implementations have been available to the public for a period of three years or more, and have been localized to support the primary natural language of the content. 
Have I omitted anything important? 
So if we adopted Lee's proposal, the success criteria would read: 1. 
The technologies and features below the baseline have been independently implemented in at least two user agents. 
Note: Independent implementation means that those components of the user agent which implement the relevant technologies and features, must have been written independently, e.g., by different vendors or suppliers. 
2. Technologies and features below the baseline must be supported by at least one prior version of two or more user agents which, in their latest versions, provide such support. 
3. At least two user agents implementing the technologies and features below the baseline support the primary natural language of the content. 
The wording can probably be improved, but I think this is a reasonable specification of what Lee is proposing. 
"2. 
Technologies and features below the baseline must be supported by at least one prior version of two or more user agents which, in their latest versions, provide such support." 
i think that this could be implemented as: "2. 
Tecnoligies and features below the baseline must be supported by at lease one prior version of two or more user agents in two or more O.S. platform which, in their latest versiones, provide such support." 
This is due for the cross-browsing support to the tecnologies. 
While some people may have access to various OS platforms I'm sure your speaking more to the fact that we should consider Microsoft versions as Microsoft and Mac version as Mac. 
The small developer would be excluded from this due to cost factors. 
I think if we throw the OS into the picture it should be at Level 3 versus Level 2 because of that specific issue. 
There are more independent developers than there are those that work for corporations and governments. 
The only large government organization I've ever worked for was the US Navy. 
While there I was able to afford the various testing platforms. 
Now, I do good to have one computer. 
The various browsers I can handle, but not the various OS. Thanks, Lee Behalf Of Roberto Scano - IWA/HWG "2. Technologies and features below the baseline must be supported by at least one prior version of two or more user agents which, in their latest versions, provide such support."
