I have been working through my projects web site with Bobby in order to meet access standards. 
The web page counter, provided by Pagecount, keeps falling foul of Bobby, because it is a server-sided image map. 
I have provided text hyperlinks to all the links contained in the image, but the a href=.... (as shown below) keeps failing Bobby. 
TAG EXAMPLE: The href allows the counter image to be clickable to 5 links, removing it leaves the counter image but inactive. 
Is there a ways to pass Bobby with this type of counter? 
Obviously there has been some sort of profile built up on the counter and we would prefer to carry on using it, as long as it passes Bobby. 
A large part of the project has been promoting web accessibility and the Bobby checker. 
Alex McDonald Project 'On-Line information on Employment and Training Opportunities for Disabled People' alex@toucan2.globalnet.co.uk Alex, Bobby does not have the intelligence of a person. 
We understand why server-side imagemaps are used in cases like this and suggest that authors put a note somewhere on the page explaining what the imagemap is. 
The page still will not pass Bobby, but it will be accessible. 
Hope this helps.

I wouldn't really call that accessible to be told there is a picture of a counter but not told what the number count is. 
Is anyone doing anything about getting this server side tool to be put out in a readable format? 
Joe Roeder Access Technology Specialist National Industries for the Blind Kynn Bartlett gave us a pretty good rundown on counters once before.

If you can get the number from the counter people (some counters will do this) then you could include it using a text object, or some kind of server-side script, as alternative content. 
If not, the information cannot be accessed except through an image. 
Which is a pretty good solid reason declaring it to be inaccessible. 
I agree that it is a shame. 
Technologically it is fairly easy to put couting into your own page. 
But it requires cooperation between the page author and the service provider, which is not always forthcoming.
