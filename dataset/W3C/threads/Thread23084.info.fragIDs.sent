<s> Firstly, I want to admit an oversight -- I could just as easily write a NodeFilter to accept the Event object and return FILTER_ACCEPT or FILTER_REJECT based on the target and currentTarget properties.  </s>

<s> A use case?  </s>
<s> Consider an HTML form, where one group of input elements in a table have one class, and another group of input elements in the same table have another class.  </s>
<s> (Say, a table of namespace URIs and prefixes.)  </s>
<s> With a little scripting and some elbow grease, you could make sure each URI corresponds to an appropriate prefix.  </s>
<s> (I'm doing something very similar in developing a widget for Mozilla's DOM Inspector to create nodes.) If the user enters into a field, it would be wise to figure out which column (URI column or prefix column) he or she is altering.  </s>
<s> In HTML we have the oninput event handlers, but it would be easier and less code-intensive to file an event listener on a common ancestor.  </s>
<s> It's even more significant when the form also has input fields which are not part of the table.  </s>
<s> A NodeFilter (or conventional DOM Core) can easily sort out which to apply the event listener to.  </s>
<s> Incidentally, the DOM 3 Events WD includes new methods for namespaced events -- an interesting concept.  </s>
<s> A NodeFilter operating on the Event object could check the namespace URI of the Event object just as easily.  </s>
