Dear W3C DRM-ers, After coming back home form our workshop, I learnt about: The mission of this working group is to develop a process for encrypting/decyrpting digital content (including XML documents and portions thereof) and an XML syntax used to represent the (1) encrypted content and (2) information that enables an intendent recipient to decrypt it. 
A W3C DRM activity is apparently about to start. 
To the best of my recollection, this was not mentioned at the workshop. 
What is the relation with the discussion we had planned to have on this mailing list? 
Thanks and Regards, Rob Koenen There is a connection between: XML Signature XML Encryption XML Protocols This has nothing to do with DRM in a strict sense. 
These are modules, that are needed for the overall W3C Architecture and it's technology. 
They are building the infrastructure, that DRM can use. 
If there will be an activity on DRM within W3C, it will surely have dependencies to those technologies... Note, that I'm also responsible for our relation to ETSI [1] and CEN[2]. 
They are currently developing a Certificate - Format and Requirements for Electronic Signatures in the sense of the EU-Directive[3]: [1] http://www.etsi.org/sec/el-sign.htm 
[2] http://www.cenorm.be/isss/Workshop/e-sign/Default.htm [3] http://europa.eu.int/comm/internal_market/en/media/sign/index.htm 
If you take DRM in the widest possible sense, this is also important and could be named DRM.... Best, Rigo Rigo Wenning W3C/INRIA Policy Analyst 2004, Routes des Lucioles mail:rigo@w3.org

What triggered my question is the statement that the work is about "digital content (including XML [...])". 
Depending on what is actually being done, this could either be a building block or a considerable DRM activity in itself. 
Where does the notion of digital content stop in this context? 
BTW - I am aware of the XML Signature activity; it was mentioned in the invitation of the workshop and during the workshop itself (in fact, MPEG is looking at using that specification in the context of MPEG-7). 
Best, Rob Koenen
