Secondly you do not need alternate content. 
I do not know who is distracted by non animated, relevant, illustrative pictures. 
People who don't want to see them, that's who. 
alt texts are hidden unless needed; titles are not shown until selected in all implementations I have seen; longdesc must be explicitly called up. 
On the other hand, an image on a page sits there and stares at you. 
It is not the same as a sound file or a Flash animation that plays as soon as you load a page, but it is in the same category: It's unwanted non-text content. 
If text works for you, great, ignore the illustrations. 
The presence of illustrations alters the layout and continuity of the text and adds text equivalents of its own that may be visible or readable. 
Accessibility does not mean removing or minimizing pictorial content. 
Accessibility means that the removal or minimization of pictorial content must be accommodated. 
These provisions take into account an absence. 
The plan to require the addition of images is not the converse. 
The two are not parallel or equivalent. 
To sum up a well-argued position: * If WCAG 2.0 requires the addition of IMAT (image or multimedia alternatives to text), people will either ignore the requirement or refuse to comply with any group of requirements, priority level, or module that includes it. 
* If WCAG 2.0 strongly encourages the addition of IMAT (the terms "whenever possible" will work wonders here), lo and behold page authors will actually do it. 
* Charles's list of techniques http://www.w3.org/2001/11/334-wcag must be considered illustrative; they're a partially helpful how-to listing for befuddled authors who don't know where to begin. 
It is nonetheless trivial to find counterexamples to many of those guidelines, which betray an anti-*writing* as opposed to an anti-*text* bias. 
Talented, experienced, and/or professional writers, as actual experts in the practice of writing, will reject the advice outright if it is advanced as a requirement. 
(WAI has a history of setting requirements and listing examples that are unrealistic and betray inexperience.) * In simple terms, requiring authors to provide text equivalents for images and the like is not the same as requiring them (a) to write a certain way and (b) to use IMAT. 
In fact, both of those requirements, if enacted, will trigger an unprecedented firestorm of opposition, much of it principled and on the money. 
Strong encouragement, on the other hand, will actually result in the addition of IMAT to Web pages. 
As usual, these objections will be immediately and falsely interpreted as calling the entire enterprise of IMAT into dispute. 
I would say a very strong case has been made that IMAT is necessary. 
It's *requiring* IMAT and telling people *specifically* how to write that will not work and will incur intense public objections. 
And now we wait for Gregg to write in about one's "tone."

Right on, sister! 
One "strong encouragement" is for the WCAG itself to find it "possible" and that's what I meant by "eating our own dog food". 
All of the requested/recommended/required features being discussed *MUST* be included in the document itself - full stop! 
Love. 
EACH UN-INDEXED/ANNOTATED WEB POSTING WE MAKE IS TESTAMENT TO OUR HYPOCRISY 
Yes, that page was a list of the ideas we put together in a small group in a short breakout session. 
If they are useful for people who are not sure where to start then that's good going, and I agree with Joe that we could use more expertise. 
What I know comes from believing usability folks and people who teach technical writing and writing for journalists. 
Although I don't think it is "anti-writing" as Joe suggests, it certainly does put conveying information on a higher priority than writing with style and flair. 
We should be explicit about that. 
In the breakout session we discussed the role of art, and agreed that it was a wider issue than just writing style, and that art may not be completely accessible (although that doesn't seem like an excuse not to make it accessible at all, and many museums are working on doing just that). 
Real experts in the craft of writing will recognise this information for baby steps and will rely on their own skills, but they are few and far between. 
At the moment I think we are at the stage of techniques that we can provide, which are a clear beginning.

This is something of a philosophical point, but anyway... 
In my experience of talking to people about accessibility and trying to practice it myself, I have found that there are two objections to including alternative content - textual or otherwise. 
One is that it disturbs the flow and layout of the information being presented, and the other is that it is a lot of work (which people don't always know how to do). 
The first objection can be readily resolved if presentation of alternatives (of any form) is optional, and besides, the range of different devices being used to read the Web means that there isn't nearly as much consistency as some designers like to believe. 
The second is real, and we need to work as hard as we can on ways to make it easy, and make it an habitual part of the design and development process. 
Prescribing or suggesting a different writing style is seen as more intrusive, and I agree that it is a different kind of requirement. 
This is where the way we present our information is important, as Joe points out.
