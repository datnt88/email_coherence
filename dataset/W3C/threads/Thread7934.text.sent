The RFC says 13.6 getetag Property Name: getetag Namespace: DAV: Purpose: Contains the ETag header returned by a GET without accept headers. 
Description: The getetag property MUST be defined on any DAV compliant resource that returns the Etag header. 
Value: entity-tag ; defined in section 3.11 of [RFC2068] Unfortunately, the example in section 8.1.1 (page 27) says zzyzx which is not a valid etag. 
(Etags are quoted-strings, or quoted-strings preceded by the literal W/.) But fixing this example raises one of those classic "XML-ification" issues: should it be or and how about Can we get this issue listed and can someone (I vote for Julian :^) resolve it and also explain to idiots like me where &amp;-entities are required to be used, where they are allowed to be used, and what clients should do with them if their parser can't be told to do entity elimination??? Thanks!

Same XML Infoset. 
Same again. 
You don't need "", unless you are in the content of an attribute value which uses double quotes. 
My XML parser resolves them for me (Xerces). 
Which parser do you use? 
Julian Thanks, Julian!! (My parser does do entity-elimination by the way, but I just wanted to keep you talking long enough to clarify everything. 
:^) Lisa, Jim, can we add this issue as "resolved" and update the "current source" of the RFC to have the "zzyzx" form?
