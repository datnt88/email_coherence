<s> Just some thoughts.  </s>
<s> It would be a very good use of time to run users through some of the more challenging areas of the site that we have brought up in past calls.  </s>
<s> We know there are a couple of items that will benefit from the validation of placement.  </s>
<s> At minimum it would be great to do a run through of our baseline usability test on the proposed information architecture.  </s>
<s> If we can... - A closed card sort would benefit us as it would validate the sorting we have done to date with users.  </s>
<s> - If we can do rapid prototyping that would be great for validating the site structure from a task perspective.  </s>
<s> If we do prototypes, they should be devoid of visual design to allow the users to focus on information, versus presentation.  </s>
