5.4 Ensure that tables are accessible [Rather than the first paragraph jumping into complex tables, I'd start with 
the distinction layout table vs data tables.] 
Tables are used to organize data, and in HTML have been used to layout pages where the parts of the table are unrelated. 
Data tables have distinct TH head cells and TD data cells. 
The TD cell content gains gain implicit identification from TH cells in the same column and/or row. 
Tables are also used to achieve limited control over two-dimensional layout of information otherwise unrelated. 
For these layout tables, a user agent can assist the reader by indicating that no relationship should be expected. 
Use of TH cells just for their formatting purpose in layout tables is discouraged, as those TH cells imply that some TD cells should gain meaning from the TH cell content. 
5.4.2. 
Provide access to header information for a given cell. 
Suggest that the user may choose the form and amount of this information, possibly announcing the row heads only once and then the column head or its abbreviation abbr="..." to announce the TD content. 
5.4.3 [Priority 1] Allow the user to navigate among tables in a document. 
I question the need to navigate among tables, "table-tabbing". 
Most tables stand alone. 
I certainly doubt it is Priority 1. 
If an author feels it is important to link the tables, that author should provides a list of tables (LOT) with hyperlinks to the tables. 
If such is present, then the table order is deemed significant for the reader, and that list should suffice. 
I believe there is no need for a user agent to facilitate this. 
If the author is concerned, an a href="..." rev="LOT" ... /a pointing back to the list of tables should suffice. 
5.4.4 Allow the user to navigate among table cells of a table (notably left/right within a row and up/down within a column). 
Navigation must maintain cognizance of encountered cells with implicit content resulting from spans. 
That assumes that the table writing direction is left-to-right. 
The natural language of the table may cause the table to have dir="rtl", right-to-left for order of the cells in a row (and order of letters in a word, and words in a phrase.) 
Any row stub TH cells will by default be on the right, rather than on the left. 
The colspan horizontal spanning direction is leftward, so the right-most cell contains the content. 
That content is not repeated in cells to its left. 
That can get further obscured if the writing directions change row-to-row, say to allow boustrophedon writing (as the oxen plow)!

Harvey, While it is certainly true that some data tables use TH cells, I don't think that we should suggest that any table without TH is a layout table, which this wording seems to imply. 
We might want to say something like "Data tables may have distinct TH and TD cells..." As I recall, TH cells are new to HTML 4.0, and many designers are using the conventions of 3.2 as standard.
