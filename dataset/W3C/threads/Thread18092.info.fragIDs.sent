<s> Hi Peter, I like your comments.  </s>
<s> Full keyboard access is required in the User Agent Guidelines, so in this respect we are covered from a requirements perspective.  </s>
<s> In addition to the DOM effort, the PF group is working on addressing semantics wrt XML.  </s>
<s> We are targetting the DOM as the conduit from which to extract this information.  </s>
<s> I have also asked that an editorial team be set up in the DOM WG to investigate an accessible web application architecture derived from the DOM.  </s>
<s> Your comment about stopping to rely in reverse engineering is well taken.  </s>
<s> I spoke with Jim and he accurately stated that the reverse engineering technology has served the disabled community well for a long time but that he felt that an engineered approach was needed for the Web.  </s>
<s> I do believe, in the long run, that AT vendors will welcome an engineered solution because it will allow them to focus on real usability features and not hacks.  </s>
<s> Jim mentioned that many of the vendors are communicating directly with GUI components where possible as opposed to using the OSM.  </s>
<s> It may also allow them to reduce development costs on legacy systems for handling complaints and new hacks.  </s>
<s> It may also let them get into other markets like pervasive rather than spending all their efforts on supporting a single operating system.  </s>

<s> OSM  </s>
<s> was more effective than tying to get through a bizarre API or an undocumented one, then it may be a better solution.  </s>
<s> There is a significant issue with the OSM approach: responsibility for problems in accessibility are almost never clear.  </s>
<s> If one screen reader's OSM is able to capture information on the screen through some particularly tricky heuristics, then it is to the benefit of the users of that particular screen reader, but it may not work in other screen readers (to the detriment of those users).  </s>
<s> Then the question becomes who should change - the poorly behaved application putting that information on the screen, or the OSMs of the other screen readers?  </s>
<s> If there is a standard way for applications to describe their contents via a programming interface (API), then it is much eaiser to figure out what is going wrong and fix it.  </s>
<s> The API may be insufficiently expressive, the app may not be implementing the API properly, or the assistive technology may not be utilizing the API.  </s>
<s> Those three things I claim are eaiser to test and verify than the finger-pointing we get via the OSM model.  </s>
<s> When we have an API, assistive technologies can always go beyond the API (as happens already today), if the API or the application implementation(s) of the API do not meet their needs.  </s>
<s> I think a DOM which includes access to the chrome is a great benefit to accessibility, and using itis a very good way to meet the needs of users.  </s>
<s> However I am not sure that it is always a requirement.  </s>
<s> Should we not require full keyboard access?  </s>
<s> After all, the functionality of one screen reader - outSPOKEN for Macintosh - provides features like Find that make keyboard access less critical (especially since on the Macintosh there isn't that much support in the OS for keyboard access to controls).  </s>
<s> Also, an assistive technology could potentially assign their own keyboard access mechanism on top of ill-behaved apps (just as screen readers build information in their OSMs that by rights should be directly exposed by applications).  </s>
<s> I think going forward we need to require that applications provide *all* of their semantic information directly via a clear and easy to use API to assistive technologies.  </s>
<s> Assistive technologies have a long, proud, and painful history hacking around operating systems and applications so as to provide their users with access.  </s>
<s> The engineering staffs of these companies have tremendous expertise in reverse engineering behavior, and these techniques have provided tens of thousands of users with workable access solutions and thereby employment and general access to information.  </s>
<s> But it is time we stop relying on this expertise, and leaving users with a mish-mash patchwork of access quality to applications that are supposedly complying with a new set of guidelines on how to be compatible with assistive technologies.  </s>
<s> We can do better than that, and require better than that, of the next generation of applications.  </s>
<s> Peter Korn Sun Accessibility team  </s>
<s> Nothing is ever then end-all to a solution and I am not suggesting that we preclude other accessibility infrastructures native to particular environments.  </s>
<s> The Web needs a common agreed upon standard that is agreed upon by all members in the absence of native assistive technology (MSAA or Java) or for applications that are compiled on a cross-platform development mode that is non-Java.  </s>
<s> Mozilla is a perfect example.  </s>
<s> We also need a Web accessible conduit for pervasive computing.  </s>
<s> I am not advocating a single standard to replace existing accessibility work.  </s>
<s> A solution is needed where these standards do not apply.  </s>
<s> Within the Web environment we have the ability and responsibility for providing this to assistive technologies and their customers.  </s>
<s> I suspect, however, that I am preaching to the choir.  </s>

<s> Charles McCN Regarding the OSM.  </s>
<s> I have these concerns: Prone to errors Very difficult to create from scratch Each platform has an entirely different graphics subsystem requiring an incredible amount of rework There is no OSM on pervasive devices or UNIX systems We absolutely need the DOM to be able to support the chrome.  </s>
<s> This is not just for GUI interfaces but it is also for audio browser interfaces that need to access information beyond the document such as history lists, etc.  </s>
<s> In fact, it was amazing how many of the other companies present at the DOM 3 working group meeting had a need for an application architecture based on DOM.  </s>
<s> This is not to say that IE would not be accessible because it uses MSAA for the chrome.  </s>
<s> An accessible application framework is absolutely critical to address the needs that I am referring to.  </s>
<s> The fact is the construction of an OSM requires reverse on engineering on every new platform.  </s>
<s> The cost of creating accessibility for each new platfrom based on the DOM is expensive.  </s>
<s> New accessible infrastructures like the DOM, Java Accessibility, and MSAA target accessible objects and not an OSM because: They are more accurate They are less costly to implement They create an engineered conduit through which to make applications accessible I am very proud of our work on the OSM too.  </s>
<s> However, I am not comfortable with its limitations and the future accessible web we are all trying to create it does not fit.  </s>
<s> I working cross-platform accessible application model for the web is needed.  </s>

<s> I would hardly call Off-Screen Model technology "antiquated."  </s>
<s> I suspect that having put so much effort into developing the most stable and robust OSM in the business, you didn't remember that Screen Reader/2 used OS/2 messages and queries to get at chrome.  </s>
