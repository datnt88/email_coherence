<s> Hello, Nine people attended the 31 October 2003 HTML Patent Advisory Group (PAG) teleconference.  </s>
<s> First the group approved past meeting minutes and reviewed reactions to the W3C briefing [1], filing [2] and letter [3].  </s>
<s> The Chair suggested possible next steps for the PAG and asked for other suggestions: * Wait to see if the USPTO takes action.  </s>
<s> * Gather and analyze other prior art.  </s>
<s> * Invite Eolas to come to one of these meetings.  </s>
<s> * Determine what would need to change in W3C specifications to make compliance with them not require a license.  </s>
<s> The group decided that assembling prior art from the public-web-plugins mailing list [4] is the next step and the Chair took an action item to compile it.  </s>
<s> The HTML PAG meets next on 7 November.  </s>

<s> All, See the following story from oreillynet.com Regards, -Bob Monsour P.S. Here's the relevant snippet from the story.  </s>
<s> Apparently, the PTO responded to this request, saying "a substantial outcry from a widespread segment of the affected industry has essentially raised a question of patentability."  </s>
<s> This order, issued on October 30, reviewed the claims and declared that the prior art introduced by Berners-Lee and Raggett raised "a substantial new question of patentabity."  </s>
<s> The order, signed by Steve Kunin, Deputy Commissioner of the US PTO, called for a reexamination of all claims relating to the '906 patent.  </s>
<s> A patent lawyer that I spoke to said that the quick response by the PTO was unusual, and he thought it was a good sign.  </s>
<s> He said that the order seemed to give a clear indication of support for the claims against the patent.  </s>
<s> We'll now have to wait for a patent examiner to examine the evidence in more detail and rule on the patent.  </s>

<s> In my opinion, Microsoft needs to fix the recent IE compatibility problems or risk making the efforts of W3C of challenging the patent worthless.  </s>
<s> But then again, it isn't in their strategic interest to keep a status quo with world wide compatibility as recent IE updates have proven to show.  </s>
<s> Microsoft may be shooting itself in the foot, or maybe it is all done on purpose, but recent Microsoft IE security updates have caused a havoc on the internet, in some cases making obsolete legacy web servers and forcing changes in 3rd party non-IIS web servers.  </s>
<s> Just google the internet for all the IE problems being reported, "Page cannot be found," "Blank Pages," "Authentication problems," etc.  </s>
<s> If you go to Internet Explore support forum news://news.microsoft.com/microsoft.public.windows.inetexplorer.ie6.browser  </s>
<s> You will see something like 20 message in the past 5 hours complaining about IE compatibility problems with Web sites, including my own messages.  </s>
<s> We had to make a design change to our Wildcat! Interactive Net Web Server, engineered since 1996 without a browser compatibility problem, to support "TCP Half Close" operations because of recent strange IE browser behaviors not exhibited by other browsers.  </s>
<s> Now with the recent November 11 IE Security Updates, they have made the IE browser behave so strange there is no pattern behind it.  </s>
<s> In my opinion, if Mr. Doyle plays his cards right, he can probably use this as argument against the W3C claim the patent will force changes in IE not beneficial to the internet community.  </s>
<s> It might be too late!  </s>
<s> It was already done and I have strong "sneaky" suspicion Microsoft is doing this intentionally to force updates giving Microsoft an opportunity to sneak in .NET  </s>
