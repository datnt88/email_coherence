<s> Guys, I know I said I would alter the MT to conform to the other docs, but after reading the other docs and the incoming comments, I really think that it might be worth standardizing on the simpler view of the RDF graph syntax that we already had worked out.  </s>
<s> Let me suggest that we all say some verbal variation on the following.  </s>
<s> 1. An RDF graph is a set of triples.  </s>
<s> That is the basic definition.  </s>
<s> 2. a triple consists of three parts A B C where B is a uriref, A is a uriref or a blank node, and C is a literal-thingie, uriref or blank node.  </s>
<s> 3. We call them 'graphs' because they have a natural graphical (ie pictorial) rendering as a collection of nodes and arrows with labels written on them.  </s>
<s> But we are careful not to say that they ARE graphs in any mathematical sense, because they aren't.  </s>
<s> 4..  </s>
<s> As far as the syntax is concerned, blank nodes are just anonymous syntactic 'things'.  </s>
<s> They are rather like existentially quantified variables in logic, but one can also just think of them as blobs that are used to connect the graph together.  </s>
<s> 5. Linear notations like Ntriples and XML use bnodeIDs to keep track of the blobs, but those ID s shouldn't be thought of as names or references, and they are local to a particular document.  </s>
<s> The basic point of this is that it does NOT distinguish between nodes and their labels, and this is a real advantage, I suggest, in keeping the exposition clear.  </s>
<s> It certainly avoids what is otherwise going to be a minefield of getting the exact mathematical sense of 'graph' correct, and since we don't need to go into this minefield, I suggest that we keep out of it.  </s>
<s> In an earlier draft of the MT doc I had an appendix which really did use graph-theory notions to explain the syntax, and it was unreadable.  </s>
<s> It is fine to be informal and talk about 'labels' in the primer (or anywhere else) as long as one is careful to say somewhere that since two nodes never have the same label, that we can (and do) *formally* equate labelled nodes with their labels.  </s>
<s> Pat PS.  </s>
<s> I could try to draft rewordings/patches if other editors felt it might be useful, but I don't want to tread onto sacred ground or anything.  </s>
<s> I think it can all be done with a few sentences here and there, unless anyone really *wants* to get persnickety about distinguishing references to a node from references to the label of that node.  </s>

<s> yes, please.  </s>
<s> Dan Connolly, W3C http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/  </s>
<s> My understanding was that most of the other editors currently use nodes with labels.  </s>
<s> I think we can do this in three ways: a) hold Pat to his previous commitment !! b) get everyone to change c) I finesse it in the Abstract Data Model and permit both (isomorphic) views elsewhere I suspect that we do not have time in this round to do any of these, and so suggest that we leave it as it is, and fix it before last call.  </s>
<s> There is a note in the Concepts highlighting this as an unresolved document issue.  </s>
<s> I am concerned that the traffic that we have already seen suggests most WG members would like this round of publication to have a level of cross-document editorial consistency (including avoiding duplication, and use of identical terminology) that I think we cannot meet giving the timescale.  </s>
<s> I believe many of the issues raised can be postponed until Last Call.  </s>
<s> Personally I think that (c) is the best fix.  </s>
<s> I would be happy to accept an action at Friday's telecon to attempt (c) next week - if I don't succeed we would have to back-up to not fixing this time round.  </s>
<s> Jeremy  </s>
<s> I agree that many/all of these issues can be postponed to last call document.  </s>
<s> But I ask that people highlight them when we spot them in this reviewing cycle so that we can get started on fixing them as soon as this round of drafts is published.  </s>
