I use both Unix (Linux RH5.1)and Windows 98 versions Hello, Make book problem I have a "site" made of a main directory (/) and subdirectories (/toto/ etc..). 
I have a HTML file in the main directory (/foo.html) that have "chapters" links to documents in subdirectories (/toto/foo.html). 
These "chapters" have pictures stored into the main picture file (/pictures/bar.gif) 
and also "chapters" in sub-sub directories (/toto/titi/bar.html) or in the same sub directory (/toto/bar.html). 
When I launch "Make Book" it 's a real mess, sub documents are incuded but sub-sub documents are not. 
When I check the HREF's I find "/toto/titi/toto/titi/bar.html" or "/toto/toto/bar.html" images and ".." directories are also bad handled. 
Unexpected crashes unexpected crashes too and other thing I will investigate more precicely myself. 
File system handling A deep rethink of all file system function is to perform because it sucks everythink it can. 
Perhaps on windows it's possible to call standard Save As an Open boxes that will causes less problems. 
On Unix it's not better, I got the directory not listed error (already reported). 
Image incertion When we insert images the default filter is ".gif" perhaps it should be "*.gif" not speaking about "*.jpg, *.jpeg". 
Pierre Wargnier PS 1: It is possible to have more often binary RPMs release (Linus style) so it can allow peoples with little "CVS &amp; compiling competence" can repport and have last updates too. 
If there are more peoples all bugs will be obvious, Just script automated building and FTP;) It can be done like mozilla.org with "Nightly build" and "Milestone release" (like 2.0). 
PS 2: Implement new features is cool but there are still too many "stability" bugs.

They are actually a nuisance for other Linux distributions in that you need special tools to extract their content.

The problem is that "Make book" includes a page from a subdirectory in the context of the first page (the main directory), but the relatives URL arenot modified to take the change in directory.
