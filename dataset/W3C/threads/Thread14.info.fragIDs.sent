<s> Hi, I was wondering if there's a way to use Tidy to remove all HTML from a page and just get the text.  </s>
<s> In other words, I like to use Tidy as an HTML to Text conversion utility that I can call problematically.  </s>
<s> Actually, I am planning on using JTidy so that I can do this conversion as part of an application I am working on.  </s>
<s> Thanks in advance.  </s>

<s> However, you could adapt Tidy to do this via a new routine for pretty printing the parse tree.  </s>

<s> You could use the DOM interface of Java tidy and traverse the parse tree for TEXT_NODE's, or use getElementsByTagName("p"). Andy Quick  </s>
<s> Dave already mentioned this.  </s>
<s> But Lynx does a great job of converting to text.  </s>
<s> It even includes a list of references at the end of the page.  </s>

<s> Can you not just display the HTML in a browser, and use the "Save as Text" option?  </s>

<s> Or NoteTab Pro (a button to remove all markup), or "Save As..." in any common browser, or a 3-line XSLT stylesheet, etc., etc. /Jelks  </s>
