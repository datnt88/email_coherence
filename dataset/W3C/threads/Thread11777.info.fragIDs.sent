I have been thinking that the sample implementation section belongs in a Techniques document. 
Irene Vatton suggested that we should spread it through the current document as examples. 
It seems to me that the sample implementations as a single group is a useful thing to have as a whole, as well as individual examples illustrating each of the guidelines, which is how techniques documents work in the other two WAI guidelines. 
I would like the Techniques document to use a numbering system which matched the Guidelines, since it can create confusion to work with two different numbering systems. 
Any other general (or specific) thoughts?

What do you mean by two numbering systems? 
The PAGL and UAGL have different tables of contents in the two documents. 
One reason for this is to give users two views of the information (e.g. for the UAGL: a "user" view, namely, user needs, and a "developer" view, namely interfaces the developer should be aware of). 
Two tables of contents means that section 4 in one document will be talking about something else than section 4 in the other. 
This was a conscious decision. 
It was also a conscious decision to define (and number) the checkpoints in the guidelines document and use the same numbers to refer to them in the techniques document. 
I can see this causing some confusion, but the checkpoints are not redefined in the techniques document, only referenced.

I have though about it a bit more. 
What I find confusing is that there are two numbering systems which use the same conventions, but technique 4.3.2 
does not refer to checkpoint 4.3.2. 
I undeerstand the reasoning behnd the different ordering of things in the techniques document. 
It might be more intuitively obvious what was going on if the numbering system were boviously different - eg checkpoint 4.3.2 
referred to techniques E.f(b) and B.f(e) or something. 
(Of course it is possible this is a foolish idea.) Charles McCathieNevile
