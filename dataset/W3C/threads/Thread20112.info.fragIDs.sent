This Amaya version doesn't support UTF 8 and if your document doesn't have a defined encoding, the default value is UTF 8, so some characters can be misinterpreted. 
It's the reason of the Amaya warning.

I fixed it. 
Amaya does not like the space in this: alt="Valid HTML 4.0!" 
Why is Amaya rejecting the space? 
How do I give this document an encoding declaration? 
What is the dark mark in the middle of equation 11? 
Regards, Jim FitzSimons 
The problem is not with the space in the alt attribute, but with the border attribute in the previous line: all attribute values must be quoted, including this "0". 
If the document is XHTML, just add an XML declaration at the very beginning (1st line, before the DOCTYPE), for instance: 
It's an empty table cell. 
Amaya being first of all an editor, it allows you to enter the content of those cells by displaying a small grey box. 
These cells are not in the source code. 
They are added by the editor in case you would like to complete the table. 
I guess that when Amaya is in browser mode, those empty cells should not show up. 
That's probably something to be fixed.

Why does Amaya not like the /a ? 
It is a  img  /a . 
That looks like ok html to me.

Is there a possibility of having a pre-configured version of tidy in the "save chain" of Amaya?

In XHTML, it has to be a img alt="" / /a . 
Is it defined as XHTML? 
It does not like the /a because it is expecting a /img before, or img .../ instead of img ... It may look like ok html, but the issue is that the file claims to be XHTML, i.e. it is supposed to follow at least the well-formedness rules of XML. 
And XML requires that every element be closed properly or explicitely marked as empty by a / at the end of the start tag.

In XML you must either write img  /img or write img / 
Irene. 
Since your document is written in XHTML, you need to use img / rather than img  .

The problem is not with the Amaya output. 
Amaya respects this rule when it generates attribute values. 
The problem occurs during the XML parsing. 
Normally any XML application must reject a not well formed document. 
Irene. 
I suspect the document in question was not authored with Amaya, as Amaya usually generates correct mark-up. 
Therefore there is no need 
to include tidy in the "save chain" of Amaya. 
One could consider 
however using tidy in the "read chain" of Amaya, prior to parsing a html file. 
This would probably make sense for old HTML files, but with XHTML, documents have to be well-formed. 
If there are errors they have to be pointed out. 
This is what Amaya does. 
One of the reasons for the move to XHTML is precisely to get rid of all those invalid files.

Vincent, I would not like tidy in the receive chain since I change Amaya output. 
I do not want Amaya changing what I did without telling me. 
Not all valid outputs are possible with Amaya. 
Netscape changes the file without telling you. 
The file starts out valid and netscape ruins it.

So if he loads his XHTML into amaya then it will require him to fix img into img / before it lets him save it?

ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE 
This is an intersting topic. 
There is not too much value in adding tidy to the output chain, since Amaya outputs clean code anyway. 
Having it as an option in the input chain would be good. 
As the Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines require, a tool should not change the markup it reads without asking the user about it anyway (this itself is one of the tasks to bring Amaya to double-A conformance with those guidelines). 
In fact, exposing a way to provide filtering of content would be very helpful. 
At the moment there is the transformations language, that can be applied to selected content, or the source view, that takes the entire document, and synchronises back and forth. 
It would be useful to be able to take a section that was selected, and instead of applying a transformation in the Amaya transformation language apply a transformation in XSLT using an external engine. 
Or to take a fragment that happened to be in an XML music language and pass it to a music playing helper application. 
Or to pass the entire document to an application that rendered X3D... cheers Charles
