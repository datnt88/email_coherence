WL: Hurry! 
It's almost tomorrow and I'd like to be able to review them. 
I would like to throw into the mix the hastily-crafted one I did a few months back: http://dicomp.pair.com/wai.htm 
an example of truly minimalist approach. 
The link to "mission" went to a no-longer-extant document so I made all the links work but that one is a non sequitir. 
Love. 
ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE I'll second that - my computer at work is down for the count, so all I have is about another hour here at home tonight.
