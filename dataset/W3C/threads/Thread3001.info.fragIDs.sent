<s> So that section would read: 3.2.2.2 A1 This creates a 'session key' for the authentication of subsequent requests and responses which is different for each "authentication session", thus limiting the amount of material hashed with any one key.  </s>
<s> (Note: see further discussion of the authentication session in section 3.3.)  </s>
<s> Because the server need only use the hash of the user credentials in order to create the A1 value, this construction could be used in conjunction with a third party authentication service so that the web server would not need the actual password value.  </s>
<s> The specification of such a protocol is beyond the scope of this specification.  </s>
<s> If we're opening this section for revisions, can we please also address the issue of whether the session key is recalculated when the server sends an Auth-Info header with nextnonce?  </s>

<s> I agree that such behavior is logical; however, the text that you just sent out says: If the "algorithm" directive's value is "MD5-sess", then A1 is calculated only once - on the first request by the client following receipt of a WWW-Authenticate challenge from the server.  </s>
