The mailing list search [1] results are now available in triple languages. 
The accet header tells it how to render the results. 
The following accept headers are defined: application/rdf+xml application/n3 application/soap+xml You can try this with the GET script that comes with perl's LWP CPAN module: GET -H Accept:\ application/rdf+xml http://www.w3.org/Search/Mail/Public/search?keywords=hommeaux 
You can use the form [1] to generate the above URLs in a conventional browser and then script it as above. 
You may also want to try it with the advanced_search script [2]. 
You will simply get longer URLs. 
The SOAP serialization is interesting as it uses SOAP for some of the transaction information and keeps the queried data in RDF in a SOAP Body: GET -H Accept:\ application/soap+xml http://www.w3.org/Search/Mail/Public/search?keywords=hommeaux env:Envelope xmlns:env="http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope" xmlns:search="http://www.w3.org/Team/2001/09/search/search.pl#" xmlns:session="http://dev.w3.org/cvsweb/perl/modules/W3C/Util/W3CDebugCGI.pm" 
Perhaps Philippe has written some WSDL for this but I can't remember.

Er, has anyone submitted a MIME type registration for application/n3 ? 
It's not listed at: (Given N3's not-quite-stable status, maybe application/vnd.w3c.n3 would be more appropriate?) (Consider this a gentle nudge in the style of, say, Dan Connolly's exhortations not to use unregistered UIRI schemes ;-) #g Graham Klyne PGP: 0FAA 69FF C083 000B A2E9 A131 01B9 1C7A DBCA CB5E fussy! 
done, but here's why it may change back: Tim told me he had applied for it. 
I changed it per your suggestion without asking him. 
I reallized that I was serving them all as text/html do to a thinko. 
I fixed said thinko and picked application/vnd.w3c.n3 for n3. -eric office: +1.617.258.5741

Eric, I don't think the /n3 vs /vnd.w3c.n3 issue is a big deal. 
I just thought using the vnd tree might make registration easier if there isn't a stable specification to point at. 
Hmmm... let's check: 2.1.1. 
IETF Tree The IETF tree is intended for types of general interest to the Internet Community. 
Registration in the IETF tree requires approval by the IESG and publication of the media type registration as some form of RFC. -- http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2048.txt 
and: 2.1.2. 
Vendor Tree The vendor tree is used for media types associated with commercially available products. 
"Vendor" or "producer" are construed as equivalent and very broadly in this context. 
A registration may be placed in the vendor tree by anyone who has need to interchange files associated with the particular product. 
However, the registration formally belongs to the vendor or organization producing the software or file format. 
Changes to the specification will be made at their request, as discussed in subsequent sections. 
Registrations in the vendor tree will be distinguished by the leading facet "vnd.". 
That may be followed, at the discretion of the registration, by either a media type name from a well-known producer (e.g., "vnd.mudpie") or by an IANA-approved designation of the producer's name which is then followed by a media type or product designation (e.g., vnd.bigcompany.funnypictures). 
While public exposure and review of media types to be registered in the vendor tree is not required, using the ietf-types list for review is strongly encouraged to improve the quality of those specifications. 
Registrations in the vendor tree may be submitted directly to the IANA. 
-- ibid. 
So unless you're requesting publication of the registration (not the specification) as an RFC, the vnd tree may be easier. 
In this context, I guess w3c would count as a "producer". 
Here's another thing to contemplate: 2.1.5. 
Additional Registration Trees From time to time and as required by the community, the IANA may, with the advice and consent of the IESG, create new top-level registration trees. 
It is explicitly assumed that these trees may be created for external registration and management by well-known permanent bodies, such as scientific societies for media types specific to the sciences they cover. 
In general, the quality of review of specifications for one of these additional registration trees is expected to be equivalent to that which IETF would give to registrations in its own tree. 
Establishment of these new trees will be announced through RFC publication approved by the IESG. 
-- ibid. 
A W3C tree, anyone? 
(e.g. application/w3c.n3) 
(BTW, I forgot to say, great work on the search results! 
Now, how to use them?) #g Graham Klyne PGP: 0FAA 69FF C083 000B A2E9 A131 01B9 1C7A DBCA CB5E Tim, were you intending to go the RFC route with n3? tx! 
I'm finishing up the implementation of a query language that I will use as a query interface to the script. 
This way you can use predicates to indicate the search parameters instead of CGI parameters. 
Of course, the whole search string will be burried in a CGI parm, but at least you can express arbitrary search criteria that may not be expressible in the expert query mode. 
I hope this shift of burden to the query mechanism doens't hurt too much. 
We'll see. 
By way of documentation, I can point you at a fairly complex search example [1] and the grammar [2] and code [3,4] that parse it. 
I have a few nits in the grammar to work out (looking for help) and need to test a federated query scenario before I'll be ready to add support for algae2 to the search script.

[2003-07-29 18:17-0400] Eric, I heard a rumour this might be applicable to spam tagging. 
In fact I remember volunteering to follow up your post to this thread pretending the idea was mine all mine. 
Sadly that was some time ago, before the last spamstorm trashed our lists, and I no longer quite recal what we were thinking of in that space. 
Perhaps something along lines of doing RDF / fulltext searches here and taking the results and human-checking or spamassasin checking and then feeding an Annotea server with claims about msgs that appear to be spamlike...? Or did I/you/we/they have something else in mind? 
cheers, memoryboy ps. http://www.w3.org/2001/12/rubyrdf/util/foafwhite/intro.html whitelist filtering stuff related but distinct i think...
