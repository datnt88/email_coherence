<s> Technique 1: Sequential Method In the sequential method, every user interface event handler becomes a tab stop in the sequential movement of focus to elements, for example with the TAB key.  </s>
<s> As each event handler is given focus the user is alerted to which event handler has been given focus.  </s>
<s> The user could then activate the event handler, for example with the ENTER key.  </s>
<s> An element that is a link and also has a onMouseOver and onMouseOut event handlers defined, would have 3 tab stops: one for the link and two for the event handlers.  </s>
<s> Technique 2: Query Method In the query method, the user moves the focus to an enabled element and then the user can query the event handlers associated with element.  </s>
<s> This could be done using the TAB key to move focus and a context sensitive menu with an event handler option could be used to provide a list of available event handlers (Shift-F10 in Windows).  </s>
<s> Each enabled event handler would be available from the list.  </s>
<s> An event handler could be executed by selecting from the menu, for example with the ENTER key.  </s>

<s> I like the tabbing option but would like the option of skipping that three part tab if I don't want to activate it.  </s>
<s> so if I tab to a link that has three possible sources of activation, I'd like to do something to prevent it from expanding?  </s>
