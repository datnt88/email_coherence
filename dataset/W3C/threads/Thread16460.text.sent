We have a number of data tables on a file that we are converting to an html document that use shading to indicate information. 
For instance the shaded rows mean the information contained in those rows is optional (for a task). 
We have brainstormed as to how to impart that information without making the html version look different from the original version. 
As part of our brainstorming, the html coder wondered how a typical blind user would approach a properly marked up data table on a web page. 
Would he or she read it line by line? 
Cell by cell? 
Any ideas of how to convey the information about the shaded cells to a visitor using a screen reader? 
One idea we came up with was to put an invisible GIF with alt text giving the information, but would this need to be done in each cell or would it be ok just at the beginning of the row? 
Thank you, Dona Patrick what happens if I use a black and white monitor or color scheme?

I think you need to be concerned of both blind, low vision, color blind, and cognitive users. 
So I would suggest adding an asterisk or super script 1 on the row header and a note at the bottom of the table that that row is optional. 
The addition of the background shading is useful, but not sufficient. 
If it wasn't a whole row of cells, I would also consider using the word "optional" in parentheses in each cell.
