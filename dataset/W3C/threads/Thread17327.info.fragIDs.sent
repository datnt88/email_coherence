<s> I've been off the lists for a while due to an SMTP problem here at work, so I missed something important: yesterday, Jim Allan told me Aural CSS was deprecated.  </s>
<s> I searched and found this brief mention, but it doesn't explain much.  </s>
<s> It looks as though all aural properties are now assigned to a 'speech' media type.  </s>
<s> Is this correct?  </s>
<s> Does it map directly?  </s>
<s> Were any properties removed?  </s>
<s> My panic-attack is over (now that I know there is a replacement), but can someone fill me in on why the change happened and the details of what exactly has changed?  </s>
<s> I'm looking for a link to a page or to an email thread archive.  </s>
<s> Thanks in advance, James Craig  </s>
<s> I don't think it is deprecated in 2.1, I think it has just been made non-normative because CSS 2.1 is supposed to represent the CSS that you can reasonably expect to be supported in browsers, and to meet the two compatible implementations requirement.  </s>
<s> I expect it will go back in (to later versions of CSS) if and when there are multiple real world implementations.  </s>
<s> The current public draft of the speech module is here: Bill Mason Accessible Internet w3c@accessibleinter.net  </s>
<s> It's right in the spec that the entire aural media type is deprecated.  </s>
