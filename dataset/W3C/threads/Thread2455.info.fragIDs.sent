<s> At one of the HTTP-WG sessions at the IETF meeting in Memphis, we had a brief discussion of Year-2000 issues (although I don't think this appeared in the minutes, so I can't remember who brought it up).  </s>
<s> Although HTTP/1.1 requires the use of "rfc1123-date", which has a four-digit year field (section 3.3.1):  </s>
<s> HTTP/1.1 clients and servers [...] MUST only generate the RFC 1123 format for representing HTTP-date values in header fields.  </s>
<s> older implementations used RFC 850 dates, which have a 2-digit year field (e.g., "Sunday, 06-Nov-94 08:49:37 GMT").  </s>
<s> The question that came up was "how prevalent is the use of the 2-digit year field?".  </s>
<s> I.e., what is the likelihood that users will be faced with buggy results after the end of 1999?  </s>
<s> In December, I made a trace of the contents of the HTTP requests and responses flowing through our proxy servers.  </s>
<s> This trace covered about 2 days, and about 500K requests (from several thousand different users).  </s>
<s> Since I have full header information, I realized that I could find out roughly how prevalent the use of 2-digit year fields is.  </s>
<s> As a crude test, I looked at one subset of this trace (about 2% of the total responses), and pulled out all of the Date, Last-Modified, and Expires headers seen there.  </s>
<s> This resulted in 6282 separate values.  </s>
<s> I then used "grep" to find the values that had a 2-digit year field between 1993 and 1997; about 1247 values used this obsolete format.  </s>
<s> In other words, around 20% of the values are not "Year-2000 ready".  </s>
<s> It would take somewhat more effort for me to answer other questions, such as how many different sites on the Internet are not Y2K-ready?  </s>
<s> which server implementations are not Y2K-ready?  </s>
<s> but I would rather not get into a public naming of names (i.e., listing the non-compliant server implementations).  </s>
<s> Anyway, this may not be a true disaster.  </s>
<s> Any new HTTP client ought to recognize that if the current year is 2002, and it receives an "Expires: Sunday, 06-Nov-94 08:49:37 GMT", then  </s>
<s> that "94" means "1994".  </s>
<s> My guess is that most of the client and proxy population will be updated during the next 3 years, except perhaps for some embedded systems.  </s>
<s> Unfortunately, it's  </s>
<s> hard to tell from these traces whether any naive client implementations are lurking out there.  </s>
<s> -Jeff  </s>
<s> I recall the change was made to the HTTP spec sometime in 1992.  </s>
<s> Perhaps you could state which clients were producing the buggy fields.  </s>
<s> I wouldn't bet on people being that smart... If people could produce buggy code despite being warned in 1995 they can probably continue  </s>
<s> to do so in 1999.  </s>
<s> After all the problem will go away in 2000 for the rest of our lifetime.  </s>
<s> Phill  </s>
<s> I recall the change was made to the HTTP spec sometime in 1992.  </s>
<s> Perhaps you could state which clients were producing the buggy fields.  </s>
<s> As I stated elsewhere in that message, I don't intend to "name names".  </s>
<s> At any rate, most of the "buggy" (2-digit-year) date fields came from servers, not clients.  </s>
<s> My main concern is actually with the proxies that have been embedded in various firewall products.  </s>
<s> I know that in at least some firewall designs, it's not possible to replace the existing HTTP proxy with an off-the-shelf upgrade from an arbitrary vendor; you need to get the firewall vendor to do the upgrade.  </s>
<s> Which might slow down the adoption of new proxies.  </s>
<s> If any of these hard-to-upgrade proxies (1) do caching and (2) are not year-2000-aware, we could be in for some interesting results.  </s>
<s> -Jeff  </s>
<s> .. how about 32-bit problems in 2038, if our hardware lasts that long ?  </s>
<s> (I hope that's within my lifetime, with a bit of luck!)  </s>
<s> Andrew  </s>
<s> Well, this may be a slightly inappropriate remark, but I'll be pretty damn pissed off if we're still stuck using HTTP/1.x in 2038.  </s>
