<s> In this configuration, provide an option to alert the user when executable content is available (but has not been executed).  </s>
<s> So I propose that it be left as a priority one requirement, and that we explain that it is in fact a special case of an existing requirement.  </s>

<s> just one of many collective sighs--most sighs of relief, i should add, and only a few of frustration--shared by the three of us during the course of the face2face, but each was eloquent testimony to the fact that the issue which inspired it, like some of the other lingering issues, aren't in fact "new" issues or "new" requirements at all, but key crucial concepts, principles, and realities which we have been attempting to explain to the working group as a whole for at least the past 2 years... so, when the decision to reconstitute 7.3 and 7.4 into 3 checkpoints was made, we felt as if we had finally been able to fully communicate, and the working group was finally able to articulate, the following key concepts: (1) the user has to be able to get to every enabled interactive element on/in a page/document/application; (2) that there is a huge difference between getting to an enabled interactive element only to have the event associated with that element's event handler fire instantaneously/automatically/without warning or foreknowledge and the ability to query an enabled interactive element in order to ascertain its nature and function--as best can be communicated either strictly through markup, or explicitly, thanks to an author-defined description--BEFORE making a conscious decision to make a leap of faith... there's a reason the verbs "fire" is metaphorically employed to describe that functionality! (3) that, given the state-of-the-art all around, the only practical way to accomplish this is to establish focus -- especially if there are multiple events from which the user can choose... and the moral of the story is: configuration is nothing but a cascade, in which the user gets the !important -- the user MUST be able to establish focus upon an enabled interactive element without causing it to fire, even if the author has explicitly expressed authorial intent by defining an automatically triggered event handler for that element, full stop (read: end cascade) it doesn't mean that the author can't ultimately get what he or she desires, simply that, as in real life, instant gratification isn't assured on the web, either... jon also observed/argued, quote  </s>
<s> unquote i could as easily cite chapter and verse to trumpet a P1 -- "Make all content available through the user interface" springs to mind, as well as the underlying tenor of the document: "first, do no harm" in relation to the neccessity of minimizing disorientation .... as i've said before, suggesting that the user disable ALL scripting support in order to avoid this PARTICULAR or ANY isolated behavior is far too draconian... we don't ask users to suppress background images by turning off all image support, do we? decapitation is an effective cure for acne, as frank zappa pointed out to tipper gore some time ago, but it's hardly the most efficacious... i vote it (remain) a P1, as it is an explicit (and necessary) requirement until either the DOM resumes work (in collaboration or alone) on the suspended Views module [reference 1], or until either XBL [reference 2] or Spice [reference 3] is widely implemented (and if so, best in accordance with a public spec...

<s> With 3.4 you can achieve the same affect as the new checkpoint since it turns off all scripting, the new checkpoint is only a convenience to turn off only the processing of event handlers.  </s>
