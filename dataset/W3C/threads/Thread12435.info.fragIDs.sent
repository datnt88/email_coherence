<s> The WAI Education &amp; Outreach Working Group (EOWG) has been working on a "quick-tips" mini reference card for accessible page authoring.  </s>
<s> The idea is to put very concise rendering of some high-priority guidelines onto a business card, both sides, so that people can carry a reminder around.  </s>

<s> For a HTML version that attemps to render the look of the business card at (just using CSS1 for layout, was not easy...)  </s>
<s> TO:danield@w3.org My suggestion is that the message should be: Validation before browser rendering tests.  </s>
<s> Or change the last tip to: Evaluate youe site for accessibility.  </s>
<s> Run it through a validator, run it through a validator, run it through a validator, and take some other optional tests as well, such as Bobby, and rendering in some browsers/cofigurations.  </s>
<s> The reason for this is that my Opera3.2 sometimes (yes, its random) calls this tip number 5 instead of 10. (in the HTML version ofcourse) That's what happens when a DIV that starts before OL ends before /OL , or if you check your page in many browsers with images on and off, and Lynx, and a speaking browser, the big two, but not in a validator.  </s>
<s> Regards, Nir Dagan  </s>
<s> I don't understand.  </s>
<s> I did check my page with validator.w3.org, that's how I found out I could claim HTML4 strict compliance because OL start and LI value are deprecated (with no CSS1 equivalent BTW).  </s>
<s> ...I *couldn't* claim....  </s>

<s> _Page organization_ Use headings, lists and summaries to keep the visitor oriented.  </s>
<s> Use clear and consistent page structure across pages.  </s>
<s> _Hypertext links_ sensitive _text_ in each link should _say_ where it will take you.  </s>
<s> Use TITLE for links containing only images.  </s>
<s> _Imagemaps_ Use a client-side MAP to give text to the links from image hotspots.  </s>
<s> _Frames_ Label each frame with TITLE or NAME and include a working hypertext start-page in a NOFRAMES section.  </s>

<s> Let them follow the URL if they want to ask why.  </s>
<s> This is also why I suppressed marginal points like advanced table markup.  </s>
<s> Stating the link text requirement first, and in general terms, makes the image-map requirement a corollary.  </s>
<s> Make them consecutive with the link text rule first.  </s>
<s> Style note: Emphasis in LHS (topic name that leads off) is greater e.g. bold.  </s>
<s> Emphasis in RHS (e.g. _text_) is italic or color or something milder than in the LHS.  </s>
<s> Do use ALL CAPS for HTML keywords such as ALT and TITLE where the technical meaning is intended.  </s>
<s> Al  </s>
<s> I don't see in the card: -for image maps, use ALT text for all AREA elements.  </s>
<s> (item 4 doesn't do it for me) -also, repeat links as text on page -for images of text, put all text in ALT - pausing or freezing of blinking, scrolling, etc. which is priority 1 in GL I question how much we want to - tell people to not use tables for format.  </s>
<s> It's only priority 2 in guidelines, and it allowed until "a majority of browsers in use" support style sheets".  </s>
<s> I'm afraid so many authors rely on tables that they will rebel at card, with some justification.  </s>
<s> - spend card space talking about "consistent page organization" The only people who would respond to that design their pages consistently already, or at least think they do.  </s>
