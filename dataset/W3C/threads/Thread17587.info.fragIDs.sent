<s> Some comments on the tables and conformance proposal: Checkpoint 6.2.7: [Priority 1] Provide a means for the user to execute a script at the end of loading (onload event in HTML 4.0 specification) and document changed (may not be defined in current W3C standards) events.  </s>
<s> I would assume that the assumption, though it is not stated, is that the script would be in JavaScript.  </s>
<s> This rather begs is issue of what this script is supposed to do.  </s>
<s> Is the intent to use the script to reformat the page in some way so that it is more accessible to legacy technology?  </s>
<s> Probably some idea of what sort of reformatting is involved would be desirable.  </s>
<s> If the script is run after each "document changed" event, would that be triggered by any cyclic graphic or decorative gizmo such as many pages use?  </s>
<s> Greg Vanderheiden's "spinning globe" comes to mind.  </s>
<s> If the script runs each time the page changes, even for trivial changes, it could easily make legacy technology crazy!  </s>
<s> One of the things that I think we might have to come to grips with is the issues of AT devices having to determine what they are talking to in order to know what to look for.  </s>
<s> Having the DOM exposed is fine, provided that an AT product knows that the thing being looked at is a browser.  </s>
<s> Microsoft Word can open web pages, and display them.  </s>
<s> Is it a browser?  </s>
<s> Does it expose the DOM, and does it expose similar information in other documents?  </s>
<s> To some extent, this is not our problem, but for us to recommend a "solution" that no one can figure out how to use.  </s>
<s> On another matter, one of the points that we have been promoting is that the user can implement a style sheet under CSS, so that there is some local  </s>
<s> control over rendering of the document.  </s>
<s> However, my reading of the CSS book says that the priority is for the author stylesheet, the user style sheet, then the default browser style sheet.  </s>
<s> Does this mean that if the author creates a style sheet, the user's sheet will be over-ridden?  </s>
<s> This seems  </s>
<s> like a bad idea, from an accessibility point of view.  </s>

<s> Hi We've done a quick once-over your list (URL below), and believe you have a very good list.  </s>
<s> There may be some re-wording or re-organizing you can do, as per Charles M. 's response, but we think your checkpoints are solid and agree with the priorities you've suggested.  </s>
<s> As an FYI, we are hoping to "complete" several "proof of concept" tools which deal directly with your checkpoints 4.3.x,  </s>
<s> 5.5.x, and 5.2.x, and add to them to the Trace web site by the end of next week.  </s>

<s> Response in JRG:  </s>
<s> JRG: There was discussion on this issue yesterday at the telecon.  </s>
<s> I think that this checlpoint will need further revision and it may not make it in the final draft.  </s>
<s> It is an attempt to use the built-in scripting capabilities to create user defined custom interface for people with disabilities or to provide compatibility with legacy technology.  </s>
<s> There was concern in the call yesterday that this was maybe too specific of checkpoint and reads more like a technique .  </s>
<s> Personally I think this kind of feature allows the development of more grass roots solutions and allow current AT developers a bridge to better interfaces.  </s>
<s> But we shall see what happens.  </s>
<s> JRG: I think embedded technoloies are important and our work shouldn't ingnore the issues, but right now I think we need to keep the desktop graphical user agent as our primary model for access.  </s>
<s> In the case of embedded application environments, there are usually accessibility APIs the assistive technology is also using that could identify the embedded HTML and pass on the DOM to the assistive technology.  </s>
<s> JRG: Our current guidelines require that the user have the final control over font rendering by asking that the user be able to turn off author supplied font information.  </s>

<s> There were several points raised at the teleconference yesterday on this topic.  </s>
<s> The most important, in my opinion, was that the proposed checkpoint can be generalized and that users should have final say over scripts.  </s>
<s> The guidelines already state that users should  </s>
<s> have the final say about styles.  </s>
<s> This would extend that control to scripts.  </s>
<s> The W3C CSS and FP Working Group is currently working on proposals (called "Behaviors" and "Action Sheets") that would allow users  </s>
<s> (and authors) to associate scripts with elements and event handlers in a manner very similar to style sheets (using selectors, for example).  </s>
<s> I have sent email to the Chair of that Working Group indicating a possible dependence with WAI on this matter.  </s>
<s> - Ian Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)  </s>
<s> The CSS1 Recommendation runs as Denis says.  </s>
<s> This was changed in CSS2, which became a recommendation in mid 1998, to give the author final control.  </s>
<s> We should suggest that CSS is used to implement a number of the checkpoints, and that if this is done then the CSS2 Cascade order should be used, not that of CSS1.  </s>

<s> Most definitely so.  </s>
<s> I believe the document already emphasizes this point: "Implement the !important rule as defined in CSS2 ([CSS2], section 6.4.2).  </s>
<s> These rules offer a way for users to override author styles and user agent defaults."  </s>
