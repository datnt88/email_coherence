Greetings, The attached tiny xhtml 1.1 file (validated) shows what I believe to be three bugs - 1. 
The alignment of the float is wrong - the heading ('Culture') is well below the place where the object text ('Man') should be - instead of on its left - and the 'same' line! 
Note that if the alternative text is actually being 'displayed' it is well above the top of the window - an image actually shows the bottom dozen rows of pixels right at the top of the window. 
2. The structure view reveals two spans inside an object instead of the single object element inside a span element. 
3. The object element structure refers to an img element - which is just not there! 
Regards, Keith Hopper City Desk Waikato University [PGP key available if desired] Amaya doesn't support float, which explains the first problem. 
Lots of people would like it, but nobody has time to code it. 
Do you have a student who is intersted in a project? 
The other two are bugs I guess - the img bit is in fact longstanding - since version 1.3 I think.

You're right 2 and 3 are bugs. 
We'll have a look at them.
