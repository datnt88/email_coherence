<s> Here's the way I wish things worked:  </s>
<s> Collections are resources, and their members are resources, and membership in a collection has nothing to do with what identifiers are used for the collection or its members.  </s>
<s> Methods are defined for creating and deleting collections, adding and removing collection members, copying and moving collections, listing collection members, and listing the collections a resource belongs to.  </s>
<s> (Only the last of these is missing today.)  </s>
<s> So we never have to rely on the syntax of identifiers for any of these operations.  </s>
<s> MOVE resource R from collection C1 to collection C2 just means if you do a PROPFIND on C1, you will no longer see R in the result set, and if you do a PROPFIND on C2, you will see R in the result set.  </s>
<s> It implies nothing about  </s>
<s> identifiers for R.  </s>
<s> DELETE collection C1 means that C1 and all of its member resources are gone,  </s>
<s> not just that certain identifiers for those resources don't work any more.  </s>
<s> Eventually we need to ask, can there be collections that weren't created with MKCOL?  </s>
<s> In particular, may the file system directory hierarchies that many Web servers expose be collections?  </s>
<s> We want to say, yes.  </s>
<s> All that's necessary is that the Web server support PROPFIND, etc., for those resources.  </s>
<s> May a server decide that some of the resources in the file system directories are collection members and others are not?  </s>
<s> Yes, that might be confusing to users, but it could be done.  </s>
<s> We expect that mostly servers would decide to have their URL namespaces exactly mirror collection hierarchies, so that mostly it would be possible to deduce collection  </s>
<s> membership from the URL syntax, but no one should ever rely on this.  </s>

<s> OK, but from a protocol standpoint, there is no way to talk about resources without using identifiers (URLs).  </s>
<s> As a result, I cannot see how to meaningfully discuss the membership of a collection without using URLs.  </s>
<s> But PROPFIND returns a URL, identifying the resource on which properties are defined.  </s>
<s> The requirement would have to be written "any URL which identifies R will no longer be seen in the result set".  </s>
<s> collection  </s>
<s> OK, to make sure I understand, this is an argument against strict consistency for DAV resources, right?  </s>

<s> If we can't rely on the URL to name collections and resource, then how would we locate them?  </s>
<s> Judy, I'd have to roughly agree with my interpretation of everything you said except...  </s>
<s> gone,  </s>
<s> more.  </s>
<s> I'd hope that this DELETE actually only removes the collection resource and it's references (for lack of a better word) to it's member resources.  </s>
<s> (And as a result, various URI's would become invalid.) I'd also hope that no actual member *resources* would be destroyed... except possibly those that no longer have any (strong?) references to them.  </s>
<s> Maybe that's what you meant also?  </s>

<s> # May a server decide that some of the resources in the file # system directories are collection members and others are not?  </s>
<s> Well, for example, I've seen systems that exclude all 'RCS' subdirectories in their enumeration.  </s>
<s> It's often the case that there are particular files or file patterns that are accessible, but aren't included in the default directory enumeration.  </s>
<s> So it would be reasonable to map this into WebDAV, too.  </s>
