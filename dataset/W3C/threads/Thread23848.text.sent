(E-mail : rahul@iucaa.ernet.in ) Dear Rahul Moray: I want to implement a japanese font that can be used on the web. 
If in Windows, you need a program that will produce text in the standard Japanese coding, either JIS or Shift-JIS. 
Then your readers can read it with their browsers if they have Japanese Windows or a Japanese Macintosh. 
We can provide Japanese Windows to you, or a US Windows application called TwinBridge Partner Japanese, which will help you work with Japanese. 
On the Macintosh, you need the Japanese Language Kit and a WorldScript-compatible word processor to create JIS or Shift-JIS coded text. 
Another way to do this is to create the text using the above tools and then turn the text into a .GIF 
file. 
Then anybody in the world can view your Japanese text as a graphic. 
They would not have to have Japanese Windows or a Japanese Macintosh. 
We can provide the products named above. 
We will mail you brochures. 
Thank you for your inquiry.

(available soon) Rahul, I'm afraid that I don't know a complete answer for you -- since I don't know what encoding you should use - or exactly how you expect to use the font "on the web" -- but the only part of the puzzle I can suggest a solution to is what font tool to use. 
The only available tool that I know of -- is FontLab Composer -- from Pyrus International (www.pyrus.com). 
It is a Windows-based font editor and font generation tool -- that allows you to create CID-keyed fonts. 
I believe the price is about $799 US. 
I don't know of anything else that will do it -- all commercial font developers have proprietary tools to create CID or TrueType double-byte fonts.
