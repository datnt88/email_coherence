<s> I don't think he's asking about whether he can *read* php documents, but whether he can *edit them locally.*  </s>
<s> I can edit a local php file with my Amaya (v6.1 rpm (Linux)) if I rename it so it has a .txt  </s>
<s> extension.  </s>
<s> Otherwise, if the file has a .php  </s>
<s> extension, Amaya interprets the file to be plain html, and so doesn't show its ?php  </s>

<s> Yes, it's because you declared your file as a XHTML document and in that case you have to conform to XML rules.  </s>
<s> The solution could be to declare your document as a simple HTML document.  </s>
<s> Richard Davis:  </s>
<s> My guess is that you are using ?  </s>
<s> ?  </s>
<s> instead of ?php  </s>
<s> ?  </s>
<s> to declare PHP code.  </s>
<s> This is in conflict with XML... If I remember correctly, the PHP manual (or was it the Apache manual?) warns people about using the shortcut in an XML environment.  </s>
<s> Since XHTML is XML, the result would be logical.  </s>
