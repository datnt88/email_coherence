Members will be aware that by far the majority of the w3c site is text based. 
For non readers with cognitive disability, it comes close to being a paradigm or inaccessability. 
I wish to draw the attention of all of you to this deficit. 
The code for a(ny) site is textual and essential, however if we all had to read and understand this before visiting a site, no one would bother. 
Could we please try to demonstrate by example before explaining the method. 
This system has a very ancient precedent QED. 
quad erat demonstrandum, or what was to be shown. 
Two examples of the problems that will occur presently, 1 Recently there was a request for information on colour, to attempt to define this with words is derisable. 
It is difficult enough to penetrate the methods used by experts. 2 I have been asked offline to help identify games sites that are w3c accessible. 
I consider this to be virtually impossible, however without specific examples it is nonsense. 
first demonstrate what you wish then explain. 
W3C desperately needs to simplify its goals and practice what it is preaching.

Anne - I have been reading all the threads with great interest. 
Your examples of children and adults with different learning abilities are wonderful. 
As a former teacher with a speciality in reading, I am always delighted with how computer access both on and off line has opened up worlds for all sorts of learning. 
gayley knight It does not require "literacy" to learn to use computers and the Internet for many everyday tasks people want to use them for ... but it does require good software and good web sites so that people can find what they are looking for. 
I was gone all day yesterday, so you were spared my interactive dialogue on this subject. 
However, I remain unconvinced that every single page on the World Wide Web has an obligation to make itself understandable to every single person in the world of every cognitive/understanding level. 
I view "understandability" as a completely different issue from "accessibility", and while I have compassion for those who are unable to comprehend everything presented to them, I cannot possibly fathom the idea of instructing web designers to "dumb down" every single page they create, irregardless of the intended audience. 
Yes, everyone should be able to _access_ the information, and there should be a guarantee of _that_, but I cannot stomach the idea that it is _my_ obligation to make _every_ piece of information "understandable" in a way that is obvious to someone with a learning disability.

Director, Accessible Web Authoring Resources and Education Center Group: The exchanges under this topic, as with all mail from this list, are available on the web as email archives. 
How do those of you advocating for folks with cognitive disabilities believe the accessibility of such an archive should be handled? 
Some may think this a pointless and silly question but it gets at something I wonder about under this entire topic. 
Should someone be appointed to rewrite each post to a level appropriate for the cognitive understanding of each population? 
How about conversion of each post to some symbol system? 
When approaching the folks at a place like Dejanews, what should be mentioned with respect to the accessibility of their offerings. 
They archive much of Usenet and numerous email discussion lists. 
Even with proper encoding, there are vast parts of the web that I don't have a chance of understanding. 
Recently I helped a college with some accessibility issues related to the posting of various PhD theses. 
There were more than a few of the documents that were of limited understanding to me because I lack the knowledge and experience to understand the field of discussion. 
How do you address this issue when exploring the needs of people with cognitive disabilities? 
Then too, what about the fact that different content sources are intended for different audiences and the fact that part of being a good information consumer is finding the sources that treat the material with a degree of depth and quality of writing that you desire. 
The Wall Street Journal treats economic news much different from USA Today. 
There's an implicit level of understanding assumed by the folks who put out both of these resources and the folks at the Journal assume the average reader has more of an existing understanding of economic workings. 
I am blind and there's little chance I'll ever independently fly a plane or drive a car safely. 
I don't think that the web accessibility guidelines are intended that I be able to do so say on a web site that simulates either activity. 
What about a college course taught online? 
My understanding of existing case law and judicial rulings in this area indicates that modifying the course material to a lower level of cognitive performance is not acceptable i.e. you can have extended time, the material read outloud, sometimes be given essay questions instead of multiple choice exams and occasionally a course substituted but you must still complete material at the functioning level of the course. 
A post or two back I think I answered your question. 
Jonathan may differ because he works with the lower-level populations than I have. 
I said then my main concern was for information sites, news and especially government sites with information that was useful to such folks, should be accessible. 
I would include any sites that provide useful local information, such as bus, train, airline, or TV schedules. 
Whether the sites that collect PHD dissertations are accessible is not my concern because they do not usually include information of interest to the population in question. 
I have also said that the FIRST PAGE, or homepage of the site is most critical, so the user can determine if there is anything of interest or to move on. 
Let me add one point, tho, that I don't think I've made before. 
The guidelines that David Poehlman created, that would make the web more accessible to the cognitively impaired, would also make the web more accessible to students in the K-12 category whose cognition isn't developed yet. 
When I developed the Five Forks site (mentioned in my last post to Kynn) I had in mind high schoolers using the site, but the most recent SOLs in Virginia now include studies of the Civil War in the 3rd and 4th grades, and my site probably isn't as useful to the new younger students as it should be. 
It's something I need to address when I do the next update of the site.
