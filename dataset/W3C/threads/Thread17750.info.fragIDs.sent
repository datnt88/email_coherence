<s> Hi, I realize that this isn't totally on the subject of ua, but this problem has taken up a lot of my past couple of days.  </s>
<s> I was hoping that some knowledgable fellow committee member might have some advice or suggestions.  </s>
<s> I've been working on a project to help blind chemists using web pages.  </s>
<s> We're developing web pages which use javascript as part of the project.  </s>
<s> The web pages show up in explorer and netscape, but JAWS doesn't seem to realize the pages are changing.  </s>
<s> Is there something special that needs to be done to get JAWS to work with javascript and browsers oe have we stumbled across a JAWS bug?  </s>
<s> Thanks very much, Scott Here are two test HTML files we've been using.  </s>
