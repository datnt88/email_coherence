I've been working in a task force in the Education and Outreach WG on redesigning the WAI portion of the W3C site. 
Part of that has been to work on introductory pages to the guidelines documents, instead of throwing users into specifications without explaining thoroughly enough what they are. 
I took an action item to write up the page for UAAG 1.0, and would like the group to review it: Note that this has no visual style. 
This is by design. 
We're concerned with the content in these documents first and foremost. 
Does it have all the relevant links? 
Is the text simple and descriptive enough? 
Is anything missing? 
Should anything be taken out? 
Please have a look and send me any comments. 
Thanks, m Um, thats: Sorry for the mangled URL. 
m Matt, What will this page be used for?

I think there needs to be section for purchasing agents and information technology directors. 
They should use the guidelines to provide feedback to developers on what they want implemented.
