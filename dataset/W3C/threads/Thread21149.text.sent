this version executes aok but first new bug is seen on there is a logo image beside a navigation section. 
This is a one row two column table. 
cell one for image and cell 2 for the navigation info. 
however the left table cell does not have its coordinates calculated correctly and there is overlap of right cell into image ..... this occurs thruout site as the navigation table is used to give consistent look.... is this one to add to bug list --- table cell width precalculation for content other then strictly text as it is image that determines size in this case ?????

The bug is in the image ratio recalculation that doesn't resize correctly its box. 
Until a bug fix, you could precise "by hand" the height in you css file on the image nav class, so that amaya doesn't have to incorrectly resize the cell based on the aspect ratio. 
Thanks for the report. 
-Paul ok -- i prefer to leave the bugs in if the display is good on the major browsers. 
this way i can spot when things are fixed rather than filling my documents with workarounds. 
I have recently dropped doing most of the net4 workarounds cuz they aren't needed as only dead guys are using it. 
Thanks for info though ... hoping fix comes fairly soon. 
each version of amaya becomes more readable (except for forms of course).
