<s> The value space for float is, indeed, a subset of the value space for double.  </s>
<s> We spent a long time trying to specify how float could be derived from double and could find no facets that we could be used to do this.  </s>
<s> And even if we were able to find such facets how could we then prevent people from deriving other nonsense types from double that would be impossible to implement.  </s>
<s> We talked a lot to the Java 2 folks when we did this in XML Schema and they convinced us that float and double were really independent primitive types whose value space happened to overlap.  </s>
<s> The fact of the matter is that float and double are two specific binary formats.  </s>
<s> If you have a float in a 32 bit format there is no direct method for converting it into a double in a 64 bit format and vice versa.  </s>
<s> This is the reason for the rule that goes via xs:string.  </s>
<s> I'm not crazy about this.  </s>
