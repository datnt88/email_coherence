I am editing in XHTML 1.1 and Amaya is allowing me to add the language attribute to the script element. 
It is my understanding that language has been removed.

In XHTML 1.1, the lang attribute has been removed in favor of the xml:lang 
attribute. 
Even if the menu says "lang", Amaya generates the right attribute.

Right. 
It is fixed in the CVS base. 
Thanks, Laurent
