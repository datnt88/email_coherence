Better still to save the Word doc as html and then run it through MS Office filter (assuming it's Word 2000) and Tidy then put it up as a web page. 
That's what I do to Word documents and it sorts them out good and proper :p That said, if the original Word doc is marked up properly with headings etc and contains no images won't the resulting pdf be OK for screen readers? 
Please tell me if I'm wrong people.

c.uk It probably would be better to use the save as word option and then run the document through HTML Tidy rather than use PDF. 
Or even if it is in word Select all ...Copy it to Notepad to make it into straight text and then copy it to your favorite HTML editor....Of course any images would need markup.

c.uk Dear ALL, Thankyou all for you taking the time to read my paper (if you could). 
Sorry to those who are unable to read the Word Doc, unfortunately I use Word as my native word processing format and my intention was to allow those who wanted - to send me an edited version as some have done. 
I posted the origonal posting up while on the move and as such don't have access to produce other formats. 
If you looked at the web page you should have seen that I do intend to put up a PDF version, but I have not been in my office for over a week and I do not have a PDF maker on the move. 
I shall post a PDF version as soon as I can get a chance (I will then post a note to notify you all it is up). 
I have had quite a few comments so far (especially thanks to Joe Clark) and will be attempting to encorporate them.

Well that's ok for one way working (publishing) but is not very practical for collaborativelyy working on documents which I have to do a great deal andy Andy Heath Sheffield Hallam University andy@andyheath.org.uk this was though a discussion about distribution? 
pdf won't work for collab either. 
Well that's ok for one way working (publishing) but is not very practical for collaborativelyy working on documents which I have to do a great deal andy Andy Heath Sheffield Hallam University andy@andyheath.org.uk it was about word wasn't it (which is both ways). 
However, you have a fair point.

They are intended ONLY for the individual or entity named All web users can read HTML... I think you meant to say that non-Windows users cannot make use of the accessibility features in the latest version of PDF (except in as much as they are also used to improve the creation of PDA versions). 
In my experience, non-Windowws users are much more likely to be able to read PDF documents visually, as many of them have ghostscript, if not Acrobat Reader, whereas, unlike Flash, people only end up with Acrobat Reader on Windows if they install non-Microsoft products that use PDF for documentation, or download the reader for themselves. 
(Home users of Windows are also unlikely to be able to do better than use Wordpad to read Word - the last time I tried that, all the images failed. 
A reader is available, as an explicit download.) 
My impression is that Adobe are holding out against Microsoft. 
PDF is emminently readable on non-Windows plattforms, but it is a page *description* language, not a *content* description one. 
PS: May I make an appeal to the readers of this list ? 
Can we agree on quoting letters to which we answer in the traditional fashion ? 
It takes time and costs money to download multiple copies of each letter in a thread. 
Thankyou in advance.

They are intended ONLY for the individual or entity named Unless I am mistaken - and I may very well be; I'd love a reference to read up more on this - isn't a PDF file inaccessible to ALL platforms unless it is coded as "tagged" ? 
- Tina H. Many pdfs can be read if they are pure text or a a dirivative of textual content. 
The tagging helps to descramble the order and impose a bit of structure on the content.
