<s> Hi, I've noticed what may be a little bug in HTMLTidy.  </s>
<s> That when it inserts it's own "meta" tag saying the page was generated by HTMLTidy, it puts it as the first element in the head, before the "title" tag.  </s>
<s> Now I'm sure I've read in the standard that the "title" tag must be the first element in the "head" tag, but when I read back through the standards (HTML 4.01 and XHTML 1.0) I could not find such a rule.  </s>
<s> If I'm right, then HTMLTidy should put the "title" tag first.  </s>
<s> If I'm wrong, then I'm losing my mind and seeing things!  </s>
<s> Best Regards, Nick Read Hobart, Australia  </s>

<s> There is no such rule.  </s>
<s> You've read it somewhere.  </s>
<s> There are lots of sites citing this non-existent rule.  </s>
<s> You're mind is OK, but theirs are not.  </s>

<s> There is no such rule.  </s>
<s> I'm glad someone with some confident knowledge said that.  </s>
<s> :-) I too read the same rule (and even printed it) from fairly reputable sources but when I went looking in the specs myself, I found not a trace of that rule.  </s>
<s> Makes sense.  </s>
<s> Sounds too arbitrary!  </s>
