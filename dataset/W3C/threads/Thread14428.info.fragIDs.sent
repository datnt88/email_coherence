<s> This draft is starting to take shape well.  </s>
<s> Suggestions: 1. Combine HTML and CSS as they are so often used together (this was discussed at last week's meeting).  </s>
<s> 2. Should frames count as auditory/visual content for which an alternative is needed?  </s>
<s> The requirement is that frame layout be explained to facilitate navigation of the content.  </s>
<s> This probably shouldn't be subsumed under checkpoint 1.1.  </s>
<s> 3. With respect to the XHTML requirements, how many of these are simply needed to ensure validity, and how many are truly access-related?  </s>
<s> Consider combining HTML and XHTML, noting their differences where relevant, instead of creating two lists of checkpoints.  </s>
<s> The resultant checklists would, in outline, be as follows: 1.  </s>
<s> The HTML/XHTML/CSS checklist, characterizing the requirements common to these formats when used with CSS as tye style language.  </s>
<s> 2. Extensibility checklist: reuse of access-related components from XHTML and other languages, discussion of modularization and the design of new markup languages.  </s>
<s> 3. SMIL checklist.  </s>
<s> 4. SVG checklist.  </s>
<s> 5. User interface checklist: either one checklist, treating both DOM and HTML forms; or two checklists, one covering DOM (scripts etc.) and the other discussing forms.  </s>
<s> 6. XSL could be included in 1, 2, and 4, possibly in 3 as well.  </s>
<s> Authors are able to choose between CSS and XSL, though the latter is likely to be used in connection with the XML-based formats rather than with HTML.  </s>
<s> Other checklists may be needed, but the foregoing, perhaps, provides a suitable starting point.  </s>
<s> I would very much like to see the content of this draft added to the proposed revision version of the guidelines - the trimmed down one that we did a couple of months ago.  </s>
<s> I think that would make a reasonable basis for a preliminary working draft as well, not least because it should still (we ned to test this...) provide "backwards compatibility" with WCAG 1.0 (I have some other thoughts on that topic, but I will hunt out the right thread for them).  </s>
