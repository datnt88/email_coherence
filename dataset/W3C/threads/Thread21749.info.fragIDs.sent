<s> Ralph, Browsing around the swbp-wg archives, I found this interesting note:  </s>
<s> We've done some similar writing in the ESW wiki, and we actually found 3 patterns: "NaryRelations can be reduced to binary using various patterns: ArgumentList, CurriedFunction, RecordDescription." -- http://esw.w3.org/topic/NaryRelations RecordDescription is pretty much the same as "Pattern 2".  </s>
<s> Perhaps CurriedFunction is like "Pattern 1" but I'm not sure; I think it's somewhat novel.  </s>
<s> It's perhaps too obscure or contrived to recommend as best practice.  </s>
<s> I like it a lot but I don't think I have figured out how to explain why.  </s>
<s> But I suggest you incorporate ArgumentList.  </s>
<s> It's quite straightforward.  </s>
<s> Dan Connolly, W3C http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/ see you at the WWW2004 in NY 15-21 May?  </s>
<s> Dan  </s>
<s> Thanks. * I agree RecordDescription is essentially the same as "Pattern 2".  </s>
<s> * I think CurriedFunctions are different and would prefer to avoid them in a simple primer because  </s>
<s> a) They get messy except in functional programming languages that can deliver functions as values of other functions.. b) In an SW/RDF/OWL context there is the question about whether the curryFunction created by one resource on the SW is equivalent to the curryFunction created by another.  </s>
<s> I see all sorts of namespace and equivalence problems here I wouldn't want to face at this stage.  </s>
<s> c) They put one in OWL-Full without delivering obvious benefit that I can see.  </s>
<s> * The argument list is a common programming trick - e.g. functions that deliver tuples - but I think distorts the spirit of either RDF or OWL.  </s>
<s> For OWL it has the added disadvantage of moving immediately to OWL full and - I think - requiring a data type property to hold the list for what is otherwise semantically an object property.  </s>
<s> (If I am wrong on this, somebody please correct me.) It also leaves the semantics of the different arguments implicit whereas any of the other mechanisms make them more explicit.  </s>
<s> I wouldn't oppose including it, but I would want those 'health warnings' attached.  </s>
<s> (There is a notion related to curriedFunctions which is a trick involving hierarchies of properties.  </s>
<s> e.g. at-least-associated at-least-partly-caused-by directly-caused-by But I think that this should be delayed for a separate pattern.  </s>
<s> It would just confuse things here.  </s>
<s> It also raises some nasty technical questions for classifiers if it leads to a transitive property as the child of a non-transitive property, etc.) Alan Alan L Rector Professor of Medical Informatics Department of Computer Science University of Manchester Manchester M13 9PL, UK Room: 2.88a, Kilburn Building web: www.cs.man.ac.uk/mig www.opengalen.org  </s>

<s> fair enough...  </s>
<s> Huh? Distorts the spirit?  </s>
<s> It's quite straightforward and it works well.  </s>
<s> Really?  </s>
<s> I don't think so.  </s>
<s> Can you explain how the use of a list as the subject of a property moves to OWL full?  </s>
<s> Maybe I'll check with a tool or something.  </s>
<s> More explicit?  </s>
<s> I don't understand what you mean by that.  </s>
<s> I don't see how using lists puts anybodys health at risk.  </s>
<s> ;-) Please do include it.  </s>

<s> Dan, all  </s>
<s> See below under explicitness.  </s>
<s> I think it makes the meaning much less clear and extension much more difficult.  </s>
<s> (unless of course, one of the values really is a list, but that's not the case we are considering)  </s>
<s> Oops - what it does move us is out of the things currently supported by the common reasoners, FaCT &amp; Racer.  </s>
<s> I sometimes mistake the capabilities of existing tools for the specification of OWL-DL.  </s>
<s> This may be fixed relatively soon, but is certainly true now.  </s>
<s> Simply that in the list, the roles of the arguments are indicated by position rather than by being labelled by a property.  </s>
<s> To somebody reading the expression, it isn't necessarily obvious which argument has which role.  </s>
<s> Likewise, it much harder to extend for programming.  </s>
<s> If the role of each argument is indicated by a separate property, then additional roles can be added by adding additional properties without changing anything else.  </s>
<s> If they have to be added to a list, it is likely to require much more complications - e.g. there might have been a length limit.  </s>
<s> Also, in the list case, it is harder to see how semantics of subsumption works.  </s>
<s> When do two lists subsume each other?  </s>
<s> I'd need one of the rdf:logic folk to check that out.  </s>
<s> I presume super-lists entail sublists, but I am not sure.  </s>
<s> I do suspect it will be some time before reasoners catch up and support it.  </s>
<s> Similarly, if the graph for a value needs to be extended , the result is a single graph.  </s>
<s> In the list form, if a value needs to be extended, we have a graph inside a list.  </s>
<s> Possible but messy.  </s>
<s> Again, given the split between object properties and datatype properties in OWL, I think this is going to be nasty.  </s>
<s> I am prepared to be convinced of the feasibility by some well worked out examples, but the more I think about it at my current understanding of what would be involved, the more sceptical I am, except for the case in which the value really is naturally a list (or some other complex datatype) - which is clearly not what this note is about.  </s>
<s> Even if it is feasible, when would this approach have an advantage?  </s>
<s> Why add the complication of a list datatype when we can just add ordinary properties, object or datatype as required?  </s>
