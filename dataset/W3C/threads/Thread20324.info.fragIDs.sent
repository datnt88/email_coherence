<s> Hi, We effectively omited to update that part of the help documentation when we introduced the menu Preferences.  </s>
<s> By default the multi-key functionality is disabed and the user can now dynamically set and unset that functionality using the the menu Special- Preferences.  </s>
<s> We will update the documentation.  </s>
<s> Thanks for the report and Happy new year  </s>

<s> Thank you for your response Irene.  </s>
<s> I neglected to mention in my first communication, that i am actually using the Unix version of Amaya under the Linux OS. Sorry about that.  </s>
<s> I had upgraded from version 2.2, in which 'ENABLE_MULTIKEY=no' had been pre-set.  </s>
<s> I wanted to bring the fact that this line is missing from the v2.4 .thorc  </s>
<s> file to your attention because the help file in v2.4 tells the user to change the "no" in this line to "yes".  </s>
<s> I thought this could possibly cause some confusion since the entry, 'ENABLE_MULTIKEY=' doesn't exist.  </s>
<s> I find the multikey function to be extremely useful, since i compose documents in Italian and German aswell as English.  </s>
<s> For this, i would like to thank everyone who has contributed to building the Amaya program.  </s>

<s> Hi, That's right the multi-key is available only when there is an entry "ENABLE_MULTIKEY=yes" in a configuration file.  </s>
<s> The file Amaya\config\win-thot.rc gives the default configuration for windows platforms and the file Amaya\users\$name\thot.rc gives the specific configuration for the user $name.  </s>
<s> The normal way to build your specific configuration file is to select your preferences in the menu Special- Preferences.  </s>
<s> For example "ENABLE_MULTIKEY=yes" is set by clicking Special- Preferences- General- MultiKey Regards Irene.  </s>

<s> Irene, The problem Danton Nunes is complaining about is the same I had already posted about a month ago (I repeat the post at the end).  </s>
<s> In our Brazilian/Portuguese keyboard we have 2 keys which hold 2 accents each: one with grave and accute, the other with tilde and circumflex.  </s>

<s> However, and amazingly, when editing in the dialogue windows (or the Address and Title sections) the dead keys work allright !  </s>
<s> :-) Amaya is a great piece of software, which I am still using because of its unique "views" and unique features in the Unix world, but lacks a kind of robusteness and coherence that makes me hate it many times.  </s>
<s> :-( (the above glitch in the handling of keys is an example of its lack of coherence).  </s>
<s> I will talk about it in a future post.  </s>
<s> But the work of Amaya's team and the way you quickly try to answer to the posted questions, albeit your lack of manpower, is surely to be praised.  </s>
