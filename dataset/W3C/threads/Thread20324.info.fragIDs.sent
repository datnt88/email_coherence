Hi, We effectively omited to update that part of the help documentation when we introduced the menu Preferences. 
By default the multi-key functionality is disabed and the user can now dynamically set and unset that functionality using the the menu Special- Preferences. 
We will update the documentation. 
Thanks for the report and Happy new year

Thank you for your response Irene. 
I neglected to mention in my first communication, that i am actually using the Unix version of Amaya under the Linux OS. Sorry about that. 
I had upgraded from version 2.2, in which 'ENABLE_MULTIKEY=no' had been pre-set. 
I wanted to bring the fact that this line is missing from the v2.4 .thorc 
file to your attention because the help file in v2.4 tells the user to change the "no" in this line to "yes". 
I thought this could possibly cause some confusion since the entry, 'ENABLE_MULTIKEY=' doesn't exist. 
I find the multikey function to be extremely useful, since i compose documents in Italian and German aswell as English. 
For this, i would like to thank everyone who has contributed to building the Amaya program.

I must send this message from _Windows so i am unable to double check the line ' i believe it is "ENABLE_MULTIKEY= " in any case it is missing from the .thotrc 
file in the 2.4 release. 
I typed it in myself, including "=yes", and the function works fine. 
Hi, That's right the multi-key is available only when there is an entry "ENABLE_MULTIKEY=yes" in a configuration file. 
The file Amaya\config\win-thot.rc gives the default configuration for windows platforms and the file Amaya\users\$name\thot.rc gives the specific configuration for the user $name. 
The normal way to build your specific configuration file is to select your preferences in the menu Special- Preferences. 
For example "ENABLE_MULTIKEY=yes" is set by clicking Special- Preferences- General- MultiKey Regards Irene. 
OK, the multikey feature does work but deadkeys don't, what makes 
my Brazilian/Portuguese keyboard (with four dead accents) almost useless. 
I'm running Amaya on Linux, XFree86 3.3.3.1.

What do you call deadkey? 
If you want to insert a dead accent you have to press the accent key then a space. 
Let me know if that answer your question. 
Regards Irene. 
Irene, The problem Danton Nunes is complaining about is the same I had already posted about a month ago (I repeat the post at the end). 
In our Brazilian/Portuguese keyboard we have 2 keys which hold 2 accents each: one with grave and accute, the other with tilde and circumflex. 
Pressing those keys has absolutely no effect whatsoever in the main screens of Amaya (for instance: you don't get a dead accent if you 
press the accent key then a space. 
:-( 
However, and amazingly, when editing in the dialogue windows (or the Address and Title sections) the dead keys work allright ! 
:-) Amaya is a great piece of software, which I am still using because of its unique "views" and unique features in the Unix world, but lacks a kind of robusteness and coherence that makes me hate it many times. 
:-( (the above glitch in the handling of keys is an example of its lack of coherence). 
I will talk about it in a future post. 
But the work of Amaya's team and the way you quickly try to answer to the posted questions, albeit your lack of manpower, is surely to be praised. 
Regards Jos?
