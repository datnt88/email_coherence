<s> Dear Terry, i recently have used tidy (Windows version from 12th July 2003) to validatemy HTML.  </s>
<s> Given is the DOCTYPE XHTML 1.0 Transitional in my code, tidy validatesits fine (it means succesfully).  </s>
<s> Then I have changed the Doctype to HTML 4.01,tidy still validates the code as HTML 4.01 Transitional, but using W3C-Online HTMLvalidator the validation for HTML 4.01 fails (but for XHTML 1.0 Transitional the validation by W3C is succesful), especially the XHTML-Notation for col width="20%"/ causes the errors.  </s>
<s> My question is, is my code still valid HTML 4.01or do I have to do some rework on my html-code to validate at W3C as well.  </s>
<s> Please let me know your opinion.(sorry for my bad english) Thanks in advance  </s>
<s> I have forwarded your EMail to the appropriate mailing lists for comment.  </s>

<s> First of all, people should know that HTML Tidy does not actually validate HTML or XHTML.  </s>
<s> It tries to output valid code, but it is well known that it doesn't force the content to match the constraints imposed by the chosen Doctype.  </s>
<s> The XHTML notation for empty elements like img .. / and col .. / is valid in the XML syntax used for XHTML, but invalid in the syntax used for HTML.  </s>
<s> It should be img ..  and col ..  instead.  </s>
<s> And this syntax is invalid for XML, which requires either an explicit closing tag ( /img ), or the / notation to close the start tag of the empty element.  </s>
<s> So when going from XHTML to HTML, and the other way around, the closing of empty element like IMG, COL, META and LINK has to be adjusted.  </s>
<s> If Tidy doesn't do this (IIRC, Tidy only fixes it when going from HTML to XHTML, not the other way around), the author has to manually do this.  </s>
<s> A search an replace of "/ " with " " should do the trick.  </s>

<s> Dear Thomas, when you run tidy against the file where you have changed the doctype, do you get any informational or warning messages?  </s>
<s> Did you submit the output of running tidy again to the W3C validator, or the input document in which you had manually changed the doctype?  </s>
<s> HTML 4.01 Transitional and XHTML 1.0 Transitional are very similar, except that HTML is parsed according to SGML parsing rules whereas XHTML is parsed according to XML parsing rules.  </s>
<s> Elements with empty context models must not have end tags in HTML, but have end tags in XML, so HTML 4.01: br XHTML 1.0: br /br or, for better compatibility with HTML browsers, br /  </s>
<s> My question is, is my code still valid HTML 4.01 or do I have to do some rework on my html-code to validate at W3C as well.  </s>
<s> Unless you need to use HTML 4.01 Transitional, I would recommend that you go with XHTML 1.0 Transitional instead, which is recognized by all current browsers, and when following the recommendations for backwards compatibility outlined in the specification, also by older browsers.  </s>
