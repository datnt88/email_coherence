<s> Hi Everyone, Sorry for the length of this text, but this has been a bit of a hard concept to express.  </s>
<s> Tom  </s>
<s> This is a proposal developed by Tom Croucher and Michael Cooper to provide a normative mechanism for ensuring compliance with the WCAG without a requirement for us to provide normative techniques documents.  </s>
<s> We suggest instead a normative process for verifying techniques that have been applied.  </s>
<s> The problem we face is that the ability to claim conformance to the WCAG will be important to many consumers.  </s>
<s> Since WCAG 2 is technology-agnostic, there is no direct way for many of the guidelines that one can achieve  </s>
<s> conformance except via implementation in a specific technology.  </s>
<s> This has raised the issue that particular technology implementation techniques for WCAG need to be considered sufficient for conformance.  </s>
<s> One mechanism that has been proposed is that Checklists of technology-specific techniques be normative.  </s>
<s> In discussion with the Techniques Task Force, we consider normative checklists highly undesirable.  </s>
<s> The checklists are closely tied to the techniques themselves.  </s>
<s> The techniques should not be normative for a few reasons: * we would require authors to apply only the techniques we happen to have considered and could preclude other viable ways of conforming to WCAG;  </s>
<s> * we would have to go through a more stringent process to update techniques, dramatically increasing the likelihood that the techniques will fall behind the level of current technology, which is one of the things the technology-agnostic structure of WCAG was designed to avoid;  </s>
<s> * we would preclude WCAG conformance for any technology for which we have not provided techniques, whether as a result of lack of resources or because the technology is not an open standard.  </s>
<s> However, we are aware that the techniques as currently conceived are intended to fulfill some normative requirements of WCAG.  </s>
<s> For instance, the determination of the testability of a guideline is likely to be made through our ability to create techniques for the guideline, and test files for the techniques against which demonstrations of our testability requirements can be made (including an acceptable degree of inter-rater reliability).  </s>
<s> We intend that the techniques we create will fulfill these requirements (in spite of not being normative).  </s>
<s> The challenge is to provide a way to ensure that people using techniques not created by us will have the same assurance of WCAG conformance.  </s>
<s> The proposal is to make a normative conformance requirement that web sites use only techniques that have demonstrable proof that they have followed a sufficiently rigorous QA process to ensure that they do, in fact, meet the WCAG requirement.  </s>
<s> This is, in practice, asking web sites to show that they can prove all the techniques used for the accessibility of their content have been tested with due diligence.  </s>
<s> This, of course, does not preclude checking that all content can be proved to be accessible under the success criteria of the main set of guidelines, it merely adds a more manageable approach to checking conformance.  </s>
<s> This proposal would require the guidelines to provide a skeleton model of a QA process for technique development.  </s>
<s> This would likely be drawn from the methods already in use for validating the techniques and techniques documents.  </s>
<s> This skeleton model would then be used as a basis for QA methodologies used to validate techniques used in conformance claims.  </s>
<s> Sites claiming WCAG conformance would be expected to be able to prove on demand that their techniques have been tested and determined to meet our inter-rater reliability requirements.  </s>
<s> This process would not impose any specific additional requirements on the nature of conforming content and we do not propose to require there be a statement on the site indicating they have followed this process.  </s>
<s> But if the site claims WCAG conformance and that is challenged, documentation of the testing process would need to be provided.  </s>
<s> Of course, sites that choose simply to use our own techniques could simply refer to documentation we would provide as part of our techniques development process.  </s>
<s> This proposal is certainly not complete, and there are known challenges (#1: is it really ok to make a normative requirement for a process, not a state?).  </s>
<s> But it does seem that it provides a way out of the extremely  </s>
<s> undesirable alternative of making techniques and checklists normative.  </s>
<s> Tom: The techniques should not be normative for a few reasons: * we would require authors to apply only the techniques we happen to have considered and could preclude other viable ways of conforming to WCAG; * we would have to go through a more stringent process to update techniques, dramatically increasing the likelihood that the techniques will fall behind the level of current technology, which is one of the things the technology-agnostic structure of WCAG was designed to avoid; * we would preclude WCAG conformance for any technology for which we have not provided techniques, whether as a result of lack of resources or because the technology is not an open standard.  </s>
<s> Roberto C: That is an important issue; actually in Italy we're discussing a lot - in the list webaccessibile@itliste.org - about Web standards, W3C, and how to follow raccomandations and guidelines.  </s>
<s> The point is that some people believe that W3C raccomandations, including WAI project and WCAG, should reflect every aspect of today's Web situation and provide developers with examples of every possible application; of  </s>
<s> course it's not possible to guess every kind of Web application and give the correct way to develop it.  </s>
<s> That's why the techniques cannot be normative, I agree with you, Tom.  </s>
<s> W3C guidelines and techniques cannot suggest all the possible solutions for today's and tomorrows technologies, but can (I'd say must) show the right way to follow for eny kind of Web sites/applications.  </s>
<s> On the other side, every developer, building any kind of web sites/applications, must find in W3C raccomandations, guidelines and techniques a mentor which is able to show them the goal to achieve, and providing them some good example.  </s>
<s> Tom:  </s>
<s> This proposal would require the guidelines to provide a skeleton model of a QA process for technique development.  </s>
<s> This would likely be drawn from the methods already in use for validating the techniques and techniques documents.  </s>
<s> This skeleton model would then be used as a basis for QA methodologies used to validate techniques used in conformance claims.  </s>

<s> Roberto C: Well, let's try not to make this process too complicated, and to make everyone understand that we're building it up to give developers much more possibilities to get WCAG conformance.  </s>
<s> We should be able to present it as an opportunity rather than a bureaucratic constraint.  </s>

<s> Indeed, however it is necessary to ensure as much as possible people are using good solid techniques.  </s>
<s> The idea behind this proposal is that the comparitively few accessibility experts will provide and validate the techniques used by the masses.  </s>
<s> This gives us the best of both worlds, techniques that have been through QA but without causing individual developers to jump through hoops.  </s>
<s> Obviously we don't want to make the QA methodology too hard either, but it does need to be rigerous to have any merit.  </s>
<s> Tom  </s>
<s> Tom and Michael, Thanks.  </s>
<s> This is an interesting proposal.  </s>
<s> You identified one issue:  </s>
<s> Are there other issues that you are aware of?  </s>
<s> I like the idea of looking at the design process rather than just looking at the outcome.  </s>
<s> However, I'm having a hard time imagining how we would implement it.  </s>
<s> So, help me out: 1. Do you think it should be a new guideline or success criterion or part of our conformance scheme or something else? 2. Would the "skeleton model of a QA process for technique development" be in the guidelines or in the techniques gateway or in technology-specifics or elsewhere?  </s>
<s> If in the guidelines, would it be a (using the current conformance scheme) level 1, level 2 or level 3 requirement?  </s>
<s> 3. Could you provide examples of statements that might be used to make a normative requirement for a process?  </s>
<s> 4. What are examples of statements that would be in a "skeleton model of a QA process for technique development?" 5. How would we test the process that we define to ensure that following it creates content that conforms to the success criteria?  </s>
<s> 6. Is a normative WCAG evaluation process the answer to the needs of authoring tool/development environment/cms developers trying to implement ATAG? 7. How would policy makers react to a normative evaluation process?  </s>
<s> 8. Previously, we've thought about creating decision trees instead of or in addition to technology-specifics checklists.  </s>
<s> Is this proposal similar but not technology-specific? Thanks, --wendy wendy a chisholm world wide web consortium web accessibility initiative  </s>
<s> On the whole, Sidar agrees that the results are important to determining conformance, and that it is beyond the capability of the WCAG group to exhaustively list every possible technique for achieving those results.  </s>
<s> I think the approach being taken by EuroAccessibility to make it clearer whether or not conformance has been achieved to WCAG 1.0 seems a good model to continue with.  </s>
<s> Essentially it breaks down checkpoints into more specific questions, which may or may not apply depending on the technology used, the content in question, etc. Identifying the requirements first at a general level, and then at a more detailed level, and testing that these different levels actually match, seems the work of the WCAG group.  </s>
<s> I'm not convinced that some QA process can be adequately specified to ensure that something meets a set of requirements unless that set of requirements is clearly detailed enough to test them directly.  </s>
<s> Beyond this, I repeat the position of the Sidar group studying WCAG2 in spanish, that until the working group has identified the requirements on content it is not ready to consider assigning priorities to particular requirements, and I add that WCAG should not be overly concerned about particular conformance schemes, until that point.  </s>
