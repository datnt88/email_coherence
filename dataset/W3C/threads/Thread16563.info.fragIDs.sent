<s> This isn't necessarily the case, William.  </s>
<s> There is a lot of reading that is non-textual.  </s>
<s> I _highly_ recommend, to everyone on this list, the book "Understanding Comics" by Scott McCloud.  </s>
<s> It deals with the (U.S.) comic book medium and has some interesting thoughts and concepts on the "language of comics" as a blend between graphical and text media.  </s>
