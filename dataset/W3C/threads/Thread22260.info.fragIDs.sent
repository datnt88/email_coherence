<s> HTMLCollection03.xml and HTMLCollection11.xml have been changed and now run successfully on XERCES-J and IE6.  </s>
<s> However, when run on Mozilla 1.0 it causes the browser to crash.  </s>
<s> Can someone else try to run these two tests on Mozilla and see if their browser crashes.  </s>

<s> I don't think that anyone else has been running the tests on the old JSUnit and the new JSUnit isn't ready yet.  </s>
<s> Running the old tests on JSUnit on Mozilla definitely stressed the browser in unnatural ways and would crash due to issues not directly related to the implementation.  </s>
<s> Hard to believe that changing the case of an argument to an assertion would cause the browser to crash, though.  </s>
<s> Can you summarize the results of the tests against IE6?  </s>
<s> Rick, I can confirm the crash and the developers are aware of it.  </s>
