<s> The fact that there isn't a standardized DOM binding for C++ makes this difficult to answer without knowing exactly which DOM implementation you're using.  </s>
<s> Conceptually, you're doing the right sort of thing -- retrieving a Node from the map of attributes and casting it to an Attr.  </s>
<s> But the details of typecasting depend on the details of the binding, so you may get more and better answers if you ask in a mailing list which is specific to your tools.  </s>
<s> One suggestion: Try rewriting this as: DOM_Attr a_node = node.getAttribute(DOMString(name));  </s>
<s> That will avoid having to typecast in your own code.  </s>

<s> I assume you are using the xerces dom C++ implementation.  </s>
<s> Try this: DOM_Attr a_node = (DOM_Attr&amp;) attributeMap.getNamedItem(DOMString(name));  </s>
<s> For more information look at http://xml.apache.org/xerces-c/index.html  </s>
<s> There is a developer's mailling list and lots of great sample programs with their distributions.  </s>
