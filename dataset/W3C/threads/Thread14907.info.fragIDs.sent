<s> FWAP describes a modules-based method by which a content-providing entity  </s>
<s> in which anyone who provides content online  </s>
<s> Declarations may be site-wide or may be made per directory, per file, per business unit, etc.  </s>
<s> For "declaration," I guess we really mean "policy," yes?  </s>
<s> Exclusion Statement A FWAP 0.1 Exclusion Statement consists of specific statements regarding the accessibility of the content which must be asserted if certain modules are not used.  </s>
<s> These statements are identified within each module.  </s>
<s> Ideally, the purpose of exclusion statements is to make the site operator realize what groups are being excluded and own up to that fact by requiring explicit labeling -- similar, for example, to the Surgeon General's warnings on cigarettes sold in the U.S. ("The Surgeon General has determined that smoking cigarettes is dangerous to your health.")  </s>
<s> This really needs to be much clearer.  </s>
<s> Are we saying that an entity must post a policy stating what modules  </s>
<s> it conforms to, but also do penance by listing all the ways in which it lets the public down by failing to conform to *other* modules?  </s>
<s> This module adds the following requirement(s): * (2.4) Allow users the maximum time (infinite if possible)  </s>
<s> (unlimited if possible) I still think nobody is saying what they really mean with this requirement, which I've seen rewritten more ways than a Dear John letter.  </s>
<s> If WCAG really wants site authors never to use events with a deadline, say so.  </s>
<s> It is clear to me that this is the intention.  </s>
<s> Module: Distinct Choices in Forms This module adds the following requirement(s): * (2.7) Use pull-down lists and check-boxes instead of text fields for finite sets of possible values (such as states or provinces).  </s>
<s> This is not the best idea at all.  </s>
<s> Why should a screen-reader user have to wait until the word Utah or Saskatchewan comes up when it is so much easier to type UT or SK into a field?  </s>
<s> Pull-down lists of this sort are convenient for the developer since they preclude incorrect entries.  </s>
<s> They represent poor usability and very poor usability for screen-reader users.  </s>
<s> Module: HTML Table Annotation This module adds the following requirement(s): * (3.5) Use the summary attribute to describe the function and contents of each table.  </s>
<s> * (3.5) Use the abbr attribute to provide abbreviations for headers.  </s>
<s> Abbreviations are not always necessary.  </s>
<s> In any event, existing WCAG requirements state that accessible table markup should be limited to  </s>
<s> *data* tables.  </s>
<s> As written, the requirement above also applies to  </s>
<s> layout tables, and it shouldn't.  </s>
<s> Module: Extended HTML Tables This module adds the following requirement(s): * (4.3) Use the axis, colgroup, headers, etc. attributes on complex data tables.  </s>
<s> You can't say "etc."  </s>
<s> Either the full range of attributes-- very difficult to understand, hopelessly unwieldy to implement, unsupported by virtually every authoring program, ignored by screen readers-- is necessary or only bits and pieces are.  </s>
<s> Module: XML Natural Language This module adds the following requirement(s): * (1.4) Identify the primary natural language of the document using the xml;lang attribute.  </s>
<s> Colon, not semicolon.  </s>
<s> This module adds the following requirement(s): * (1.1) Provide reasonable alt attributes for all images.  </s>
<s> "Reasonable"?  </s>
<s> "Appropriate," I would say.  </s>
<s> Module: Image Descriptions Dependencies: Basic Images This module adds the following requirement(s): * (1.1) Provide longdesc attributes for all images which are not adequately described by the alt attribute.  </s>
<s> Exclusion Statement: "Some graphical content is undescribed and may be inaccessible to users without the ability to display or view graphics."  </s>
<s> Since we're improving in WCAG 1, I don't see why we can't propose using title first and longdesc only if necessary.  </s>
<s> Module: Basic Audio Required by [89]Minimal Set This module adds the following requirement(s): * (1.1) Provide transcripts for all non-streaming audio text containing spoken words.  </s>
<s> What is "audio text"?  </s>
<s> Module: Basic Video Required by [90]Minimal Set This module adds the following requirement(s): * (1.1) Provide text descriptions of all non-streaming video.  </s>
<s> Text descriptions *do not work* as a substitute for audio description.  </s>
<s> This requirement must be removed.  </s>
<s> Module: Audio Captions Dependencies: Basic Audio, Synchronized Multimedia (1.1, 1.2) Provide text descriptions for all non-streaming audio text containing spoken words.  </s>
<s> There is no such thing as an audio caption, and a "text description" is just as meaningless.  </s>
<s> Here, yet bloody again, the WCAG politburo refuses to use the very longstanding and *invariate* terminology in use for decades.  </s>
<s> Captions are captions (whether closed or open); there is no such thing as an audio caption.  </s>
<s> A "text description," whatever that is, certainly is not a caption.  </s>
<s> Module: Streaming Multimedia Dependencies: Basic Audio, Basic Video, Synchronized Multimedia, Audio Descriptions This module adds the following requirement(s): * (1.1, 1.2) Provide synchronized text streams and audio descriptions for all streaming video.  </s>
<s> Just say "captions," not "text streams."  </s>
<s> The exact presentation mechanism is outside the purview of these requirements.  </s>
<s> A "stream" may not be necessary, as with open captioning.  </s>
<s> Module: Accessible PDF This module adds the following requirement(s): * (4.1, 4.3) Create PDFs using the latest version of Adobe Acrobat, and use the full accessibility features available.  </s>
<s> * (1.1, 4.3) Provide a link or URL to the Adobe Access web site for PDF to text conversion.  </s>
<s> Exclusion Statement: This site may contain PDF files which are incompatible with assistive technology devices and software.  </s>
<s> I'm not sure there are many such PDFs given how PDF2txt and PDF2HTML work.  </s>
<s> Multi-column text is, I suppose, the exception, but only with some authoring programs.  </s>

<s> Thanks Joe -- what are your thoughts on the general concept?  </s>
<s> For the most part, I expect nearly all of my words (specific module composition, specific "requirements", etc.) to be knocked down and rewritten, and I am quite certain I excluded some things.  </s>
<s> :) I am most interested in finding out if the group (collectively) considers it worthwhile to make those kinds of edits and pursue this specific approach, or if I am going down a philosophical dead end.  </s>
<s> When I was writing the multimedia part of the proposal, I was thinking "someone like Joe really would be needed to write this part" -- I fully acknowledge that I'm not capable of doing the whole thing by myself.  </s>

<s> PS: Please don't refer to me as part of any "politburo" because of specific terms I threw together on a proposal that is meant to illustrate not my "vast knowledge" of captioning but rather a specific technique.  </s>

<s> Hi Joe Great set of comments.  </s>
<s> I have saved a copy separate along with Kynn's to refer to as we move forward.  </s>
<s> Couple of comments 1 - Overall your comments are very good and apply to our 2.0 as well as Kynn's posting.  </s>
<s> I have save a side copy of both of your comments for later review as we move forward.  </s>
<s> 2 - RE: time limit.  </s>
<s> You asked a question.  </s>
<s> My response is that I don?t think that we should be forbidding time limits or making them infinite.  </s>
<s> We do have to make sure they are sufficient to allow people to respond, -- yet handle the real needs of some site activities.  </s>
<s> There is a triplet of rules/options that I think should be used.  </s>
<s> I will post them separately for comment.  </s>
<s> 3 - RE pull down lists.  </s>
<s> I agree with many of your comments so I won?t list them here.  </s>
<s> But one I would like to highlight is 2.7 which dealt with pull down menus.  </s>
<s> I agree they shouldn?t  </s>
<s> be used alone but I think they can be used in their hybrid form where direct typing is also allowed (especially where they let the person typing know if what they are typing is a legal response from the list).  </s>
<s> Check boxes should be ok but should not be used for long sets of choices.  </s>
<s> They don?t allow type-to-jump feature which is important for non-visual, low vision and physical access.  </s>
<s> Since you commented on all of Kynn's points -- did that mean you found it interesting?  </s>
<s> I'm not sure what I think.  </s>
<s> I'm sure it has helped us move forward and advanced our thinking.  </s>
<s> Not sure if this is the approach we should go with.  </s>
<s> Doesn?t quite ring with me yet but I haven't had a long enough chance to think about it to separate wrongness from just different-ness.  </s>
<s> It is intriguing - and has a number of very interesting aspects to it.  </s>
<s> All for now Gregg PS Please watch the tone.  </s>
<s> You did great except for a one instance.  </s>
<s> But it was notable - especially since Kynn posted it as a restructuring to try out an idea and had all sorts of caveats about wording etc. Help us keep this list cool yet lively.  </s>
<s> Thanks.  </s>
