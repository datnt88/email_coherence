<s> Couple of general OWL questions: 1.  </s>
<s> If a property is declared as an owl:TransitiveProperty, will all sub-properties also be transitive?  </s>
<s> 2. If a property is declared as an owl:SymmetricProperty, will all sub-properties also be symmetric?  </s>

<s> I'm not sure about this one:  </s>
<s> different facets might have different preferred labels (the obvious problem).  </s>
<s> I am not sure if you can account for that in OWL, although I would have thought you can.  </s>
<s> But a single Concept might have a couple of preferred labels too.  </s>
<s> I am thinking of use cases that guess which Concept is being referred to, and being a preferred label is an obvious way to rank possible choices.  </s>
<s> Also, in merging two thesauri, is there really a need to choose a single preferred term, given that the RDF key to the meaning is the concept?  </s>
<s> The others all make sense to me.  </s>

<s> Hi Alistair,  </s>
<s> I don't think either are true.  </s>
<s> If s is a supProperty of p that means that each pair (sub,obj) in s is also in p but the subset of pairs in s can be arbitrary.  </s>
<s> For example, in a domain with two members a and b you could have: p = { (a, b), (b, a) } s = { (a, b) } Here p is symmetric and s is a subProperty of p but s is not symmetric.  </s>
