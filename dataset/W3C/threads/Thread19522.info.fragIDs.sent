<s> The Amaya team is proud to announce the availability of the 2.0 release of the Amaya editor/browser for both Unix and Windows platforms.  </s>
<s> Binaries are available at: Source is available at:  </s>
<s> A FAQ is available at http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/FAQ.html  </s>
<s> An important milestone associated with this release is the opening of the Amaya CVS base (read only mode for the moment).  </s>
<s> We'll send a follow-up message later this week giving more information on how to retrieve Amaya from the W3C CVS server and how to compile it.  </s>
<s> To know more about the features of this and older Amaya releases, see http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/New.html N.B.  </s>
<s> Due to some technical problems, we won't be able to upload this Amaya distribution to our ftp server until tomorrow.  </s>
<s> It's available thru HTTP, though.  </s>
<s> Many thanks to the feedback from our users, which has helped improve many aspects of Amaya.  </s>
<s> Keep it coming!  </s>
<s> Extensions 2.0: * First implementation of a multi-document, multi-level Undo/Redo command.  </s>
<s> * WAI guidelines on Image and Maps.  </s>
<s> * COLGROUP and COL elements are accepted and can be created within TABLE elements.  </s>
<s> The rendering is not implemented yet, though.  </s>
<s> * CSS properties "left-margin", "top-margin", and "display: none" are now interpreted.  </s>
<s> * Amaya is now able to load, edit, print and save CSS files and plain text files.  </s>
<s> * The entry "Style Sheets" in the menu Style allows one to o link a CSS file using the standard Amaya paragdim: Click to select the target or display a form allowing us to type the URI.  </s>
<s> The corresponding LINK element is automatically created and CSS properties are applied to the document.  </s>
<s> o open a CSS file used in a document.  </s>
<s> o open a CSS file used in a document.  </s>
<s> o disable CSS properties of the CSS file.  </s>
<s> o enable or re-apply CSS properties of the CSS file.  </s>
<s> o remove a CSS link.  </s>
<s> * After a "Make Book" the document is automatically switched to the Read-Only mode.  </s>
<s> This will avoid the user to edit it or save it by error.  </s>
<s> * Publication thru the net now uses the HTTP/1.1 etags and conditional headers to avoid the lost updates problem.. * The 409 HTTP error message (conflict) is now shown in a popup window.  </s>
<s> * Added DEFLATE content encoding support under Windows.  </s>
<s> * First support of disconnected browsing mode thru the libwww cache.  </s>
<s> * Command SaveAs allows you to save a document in XHTML, following the specifications and guidelines of the latest XHTML draft.  </s>
<s> * Adding new menu entries:  </s>
<s> o Back and Forward: navigation commands o Editor/Browser mode: setting Amaya mode (read only or read/write) o Amaya at W3C: link to the menu.  </s>
<s> * Implementing a new policy of colors allocation.  </s>
<s> * First version of Preferences configuration menus.  </s>
<s> * The Verfiy each PUT with a GET option is now turned off by default * It's now possible to browse with a simple-click or a double-click.  </s>
<s> By default Amaya uses the double-click, but it could be switched to simple-click in the General preference menu.  </s>
<s> * Using the Publishing preferencesmenu, it's now possible to choose the default name for saving URLs that end in "/".  </s>
<s> * New version of the Thot API: o Changing of TtaAddButton and TtaChangeButton to merge Windows and Unix dialogue API.  </s>
<s> o New functions: TtaGiveNextElement, TtaGetFirstLeaf, TtaGetLastLeaf o A new Thot event: TteElemClick * All user Amaya preferences and personal files are collected into a home directory.  </s>
<s> By default this directory is $HOME/.amaya on Unix platforms and C:\TEMP\amaya on Windows platforms.  </s>
<s> These files are: o a personal amaya.css  </s>
<s> o a personal amaya.keyboard  </s>
<s> (amaya.kb on Windows) o a personal dictionary o thot.rc personal preferences.  </s>
<s> This file is generated and updated thru the Special/Preferences menu o other temporary files and directories used by Amaya.  </s>
<s> * After a paste command, the selection is now set at the end of the pasted text where the user could continue to insert text.  </s>
<s> * The Amaya CVS base is now available in read-only mode at and the libwww is no longer considered as a part of the Amaya code.  </s>
<s> The source tar file includes the libwww code (libwww is a directory next to Amaya) and one who acceedes the CVS base needs to get the libwww code (cvs get libwww) to compile Amaya.  </s>
<s> Fixed bugs 2.0: * Scripts can now be created within the document Body and are no longer moved into the Head at parsing time.  </s>
<s> * When creating a new polyline in an area map there was a bug which generated wrong coords values on Windows platforms.  </s>
<s> * Comments in files amaya.keyboard and amaya.kb are now allowed.  </s>
<s> * When a document included the sequence form .. table .. /form .. /table Amaya closed the table at the end of the form.  </s>
<s> Now it reports a parsing error on the end tag /form and avoids to split the table.  </s>
<s> * Copying an image from a remote document to a local document didn't work.  </s>
<s> * When following a link which had a "?foo" ending, Amaya treated that ending as a query string.  </s>
<s> * Some attributes values appeared with strange names in the Attribute menu.  </s>
<s> * When the current position was in a sequence of empty blocks (paragraphs, for instance), the Backspace key deleted two of these blocks at once and did not select anything.  </s>
<s> * When pasting a paragraph with an attribute at the beginning of a table cell or list item, it was turned into a pseudo-paragraph, and produced wrong HTML code when the document was saved.  </s>
<s> * Amaya locked up when one applied the strong command to a text displayed at the beginning of a line.  </s>
<s> * CSS selectors like "PRE SPAN.test" didn't work.  </s>
<s> * The CSS parser didn't parse well the rule url("...").  </s>
<s> * SMALL elements could be displayed too small.  </s>
<s> * basefont face="...." was saved as basefont facee="...." .  </s>
<s> * When putting an attribute on a text string, the attribute was generated as text in the HTML output.  </s>
<s> Now a SPAN element is generated to carry the attribute.  </s>
<s> This bug occured with attributes title, dir, and most event attributes (onclick, ondblclick, onmousedown, etc.).  </s>
<s> * Amaya crashed when loading an isolated image with a filename without a suffix.  </s>
<s> * People who compiled Amaya on Windows platforms couldn't display jpeg images.  </s>
<s> The problem is fixed now.  </s>
<s> * The authentication handlers were desactivated while doing a HEAD pre-check during the lost update PUT procedure.  </s>
<s> * While browsing an image, pressing the reload button didn't show the image again.  </s>
<s> * It wasn't possible to browse images when the request was redirected to a URL having a different end name.  </s>

<s> Argghhh!! Bloody Janet Cache again, then.  </s>
<s> All I can get is the Page for the 1.4a version from 12 January -- cache presumably refusing to check for a new version of the Page.  </s>
<s> It doesn't matter how I do it (lynx, netscape, all local caching zapped, either of the above URLs, ... ).  </s>
<s> Thanks for the news ... I'll pass it on.  </s>

<s> Hello Ted, You must be going thru one of our mirrors or clicked on the ftp server links?  </s>
<s> No, it was the UK Janet Cache (possibly the Manchester contingent since apparently Cambridge doesn't have the problem).  </s>
<s> See below.  </s>
<s> I was using the HTTP server.  </s>
<s> Anyway, I've found a work-round which may help anyone else stuck up the same blind alley.  </s>
<s> I begged time on my son's Win98 machine which uses a commercial ISP instead of the University (which enforces caching) and got through to the right thing immediately.  </s>
<s> For anyone who needs to know, the direct URL for The Right Thing is and this works, even over the Janet National Cache!  </s>
<s> As I said before, the URLs given in the announcement of 2.0 lead, via the Janet cache, only to the 1.4a version of 12 January, bacause that cache is not updated.  </s>
<s> Many thanks, Jose, for your response and advice.  </s>
<s> Best wishes, Ted.  </s>
