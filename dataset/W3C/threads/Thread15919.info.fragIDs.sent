<s> I think you've done a wonderful job of creating a page that looks good in Netscape and Lynx.  </s>
<s> If it looks good in Lynx, it probably sounds good, too.  </s>
<s> I have three criticisms, and they are all very minor - take them all with the understanding that I think your site looks great.  </s>
<s> (1) The description "typing pc" is very unclear.  </s>
<s> I use Lynx as my primary browser, and this was the only thing I didn't understand.  </s>
<s> Maybe "cartoon PC typing on its own keyboard" would be better.  </s>
<s> (2) This is the reason I'm posting this here instead of mailing Joyce directly.  </s>
<s> img alt="purple line" .  </s>
<s> While designing for access, it's important to consider the sighted viewers too!  </s>
<s> I see three audiences for the alt text: graphic browser users with image loading turned off, text browser users, and visually impaired users.  </s>
<s> Those with image loading turned off want to know whether to load the image.  </s>
<s> For them, an indication of whether or not a line is interesting enough to load is worthwhile.  </s>
<s> But for text browser users, a snippet of text doesn't have the same effect as a rule does - it doesn't break up the page in the same way.  </s>
<s> Using ASCII-graphic alt text helps them.  </s>
<s> And I think that most screen readers skip most punctuation.  </s>
<s> I think a combination alt text would work well for all three audiences: maybe something like  </s>
<s> img alt="purple line________________________________" and img alt="zig-zag line /\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\" would work well.  </s>
<s> (3) Change the background graphic.  </s>
<s> It's distracting to me - I'd go with something non-textual.  </s>
<s> Toning it down may have prevented screen  </s>
<s> readers from trying to read it, but now it's nearly unreadable to the  </s>
<s> sighted, and I spent a little while trying to figure out what it was.  </s>
<s> When it first loaded, I honestly thought it was Hebrew.  </s>

<s> Comments about point 2. Other comments below.  </s>
<s> I haven't gone to the page under discussion yet.  </s>
<s> LR: Sorry, I think ASCII art should be deprecated.  </s>
<s> You don't know which punctuations will or won't be turned on in a particular browser/screen reader combination for a particular user.  </s>
<s> Repeat filters can remove multiple occurences of *identical* characters, but your mixture of punctuations goes through without repeat filtering; it gets in the way.  </s>
<s> I don't mind verbal descriptions in the alt text, but since they are spacers, they should be extremely terse.  </s>
<s> Even an alt text like ". ." would be effective in some situations, causing a pause in the speech stream at the horizontal rule.  </s>
<s> I don't guarantee that ". ." will always work either.  </s>
<s> On Wed, 25 Mar 1998 10:59:45 -0500,  </s>
<s> LR: I could dig that.  </s>
<s> LR: If there is text on a page, even in an invisible color, a screen reading program will probably read it.  </s>
<s> Whether you hear it before or after the main foreground text of the page, I don't know, but if the browser renders it as text, it will be in the display and the off-screen model somewhere.  </s>
<s> This is one of the places where bitmapped text might actually be useful; we wouldn't have to listen to it.  </s>
<s> LR: Don't get me wrong.  </s>
<s> If there are pictures or audio clips that I am encouraged to download or print to paper or show to sighted students, I want them to be labeled with more than a cryptic filename.  </s>
<s> But many of the decorative devices on web pages are best skipped and not described.  </s>

<s> I received a couple of emails after my reply to your initial request for review suggesting this probably isn't the most appropriate discussion for this list.  </s>
<s> Well, maybe not, but you asked, so we're dealing with it.  </s>
<s> I'm  </s>
<s> sure somebody will spank us or move this to another list if this isn't topical.  </s>
<s> One quick follow-up, then we're probably done.  </s>
<s> Most importantly, I wanted to give you public praise for your dedication to making your site accessible.  </s>
<s> AttaJoyce!  </s>
<s> pat pat pat What fast implementation!  </s>
<s> My hat's off to you for effecting the changes so quickly.  </s>
<s> I'd still take issue with the background, however, and suggest something non-textual.  </s>
<s> Noticed you validated this time too.  </s>
<s> Yippee!  </s>
<s> organizing the "Joyce passed validation" parade...heh, I actually wrote it on my *calendar* the first time I got the "No errors found!" message  </s>
<s> Wasn't mentioned in Bobby, but it would be nice if you included a text-only version of the page as well and had that link in the upper-left hand corner of your page so it's the very first thing someone encounters.  </s>
<s> Heck, though, if it's readable in Lynx, don't knock yourself out.  </s>
<s> Since you use Notepad  </s>
<s> and don't have a nifty html-to-text formatting tool, I've found the easiest way to make the "conversion" is to highlight the page in your usual browser, then do a copy/paste and save it as filename.txt.  </s>
<s> Just make sure you go back and add the URLs to the text version since the addresses aren't seen in the hypertext links and won't be listed in the "paste."  </s>
<s> Chris Maden suggested you use ALT="--------------------" or something like that in place of "line.gif,"  </s>
<s> saying most voice synthesis software is programmed to ignore punctuation.  </s>
<s> Typically, that's true and the general default configuration, but for someone like me who frequents Internet Relay Chat (IRC) and encounters nicknames which include punctuation characters  </s>
<s> (`Avers, for example, or Avers^), I have to set up my software so it DOES  </s>
<s> read punctuation so also hear it pronounced in other applications.  </s>
<s> Quite frankly, If I encountered ------------ on a web page, it would annoy me, so I stand by the advice I give in my tutorial on creating speech- and text-friendly web sites by suggesting use of an empty ALT tag (ALT="") in this instance.  </s>
<s> Okay, stick a fork in me, I'm done!  </s>
<s> Again, good job, Joyce.  </s>
<s> Good luck with retrofitting the rest of the site.  </s>

<s> [Lloyd G. Rasmussen]  </s>
<s> My point is that the rule should not only provide separation for the visually impaired users and graphical users, but *also* for the text browser users.  </s>
<s> The short alt text *doesn't* work for me in Lynx; it looks almost like a heading called "purple line", not like a divider.  </s>
<s> Moreover, ". ." is inadequate description for those who are using a graphical browser but have image loading turned off.  </s>
<s> They have no idea what the graphic is - it could be a pair of eyes, a male upper torso, a couple of pebbles, or two distant UFOs.  </s>
<s> The ASCII graphics in alt text make a separator apparent to the Lynx user, but this may get in the way of screen readers.  </s>
<s> I'm looking for a solution that will provide visual impact in a text browser, a description for those with graphics turned off, and appropriate behavior for an aural user.  </s>
<s> Anyone have any other suggestions?  </s>
<s> The text in this case is bitmapped in the background; I was a little surprised at the suggestion that a screen reader might attempt to read it.  </s>
<s> I didn't think GUI screen readers relied on OCR - browsing the Web would be a sort of dadaist hell.  </s>
<s> I found the graphic distracting as a sighted user.  </s>

<s> [Suzan Dolloff]  </s>
<s> Messages that are purely reviews of Joyce's site probably are inappropriate.  </s>
<s> However, a lot of good points about general accessibility design have been raised, and messages relating to those should be kept on the list, IMO.  </s>
<s> I find that a strange suggestion.  </s>
<s> If the page is readable in Lynx (as you note), why make yet another version?  </s>
<s> And one without hyperlinks, at that?  </s>
<s> Is there anyone browsing the Web without the capability to parse HTML?  </s>
<s> I suppose some desparate soul may be telnet'ing to port 80 and downloading the text into a file, but that would be odd and unusual.  </s>
<s> More importantly, suggesting that alternate file versions are important for accessibility damages the accessibility initiative in two ways.  </s>
<s> First of all, if HTML is insufficient for access, then there's no point in designing accessible HTML.  </s>
<s> Why not go for an all- out, rendered into GIF with JavaScript orgy?  </s>
<s> If I need a text-only version any way, I might as well.  </s>
<s> Secondly, ACCESSIBILITY MUST BE EASY.  </s>
<s> Most people can see.  </s>
<s> While I want my site to be visible to as many as possible, every extra piece of work necessary moves the border of "possible".  </s>
<s> Making duplicate versions of every file quickly pushes the visually challenged into the "impossible" side, especially for large Web sites.  </s>
<s> Right now, Lynx renders hr as a series of underscores.  </s>
<s> Does this bother you - does your screen reader read underscores?  </s>
<s> The best solution, it seems to me, is hr src="..." , which will still render as an ordinary hr in Lynx.  </s>
<s> Unfortunately, this proposal wasn't adopted for HTML 4.0.  </s>
<s> The second best solution seems to be img alt="some description _______________" .  </s>
<s> Underscores will get in the way of a screen reader and Lynx to exactly the same degree that other rules do, since that's how Lynx renders hr s.  </s>
<s> I was hoping with the varying ASCII graphic versions of the line to convey more of the author's intent, but if that's detrimental, than underscores will suffice.  </s>
