<s> Hi, I am new to the owl subject and I don't know if this is the appropriate  </s>
<s> place to ask my question.  </s>
<s> As far as I understand, OWL DL is the part of OWL that enables a sound and  </s>
<s> complete inference calculus and where the entailment of statements is decidable.  </s>
<s> I just couldn't find any proofs for these properties of OWL DL.  </s>
<s> Can anyone give me directions?  </s>
<s> Thanks Chris Christoph Mangold  </s>
<s> Hi , OWL-DL is considered equivalent to the SHOIN(D) description logics ( an extension of ALC including transitive roles, role hierarchies, nominals, inverse roles, unqualified number restrictiones and datatypes).  </s>
<s> A mapping can be established between OWL-DL entailment and concept satisfiability in SHOIN(D) and thus the decidability of OWL-DL  </s>
<s> entailment can be proved from the known decidability of SHOIN(D).  </s>
<s> For more details, there a couple of interesting papers published this year that provide a deep insight on these topics: -" From SHIQ and RDF to OWL: The Making of a Web Ontology Language" writen by Ian Horrocks, P.F. Patel-Schneider and F.Van Harmelen "Reducing OWL-entailment to Description Logic Satisfiability" by Ian Horrocks and P.F. Patel-Schneider These papers can be downloaded from Ian Horrock's web site.  </s>
<s> If you are not familiar with description logics get a copy of the description logics handbook.  </s>
