Hi, I am new to the owl subject and I don't know if this is the appropriate 
place to ask my question. 
As far as I understand, OWL DL is the part of OWL that enables a sound and 
complete inference calculus and where the entailment of statements is decidable. 
I just couldn't find any proofs for these properties of OWL DL. 
Can anyone give me directions? 
Thanks Chris Christoph Mangold 
Hi , OWL-DL is considered equivalent to the SHOIN(D) description logics ( an extension of ALC including transitive roles, role hierarchies, nominals, inverse roles, unqualified number restrictiones and datatypes). 
A mapping can be established between OWL-DL entailment and concept satisfiability in SHOIN(D) and thus the decidability of OWL-DL 
entailment can be proved from the known decidability of SHOIN(D). 
For more details, there a couple of interesting papers published this year that provide a deep insight on these topics: -" From SHIQ and RDF to OWL: The Making of a Web Ontology Language" writen by Ian Horrocks, P.F. Patel-Schneider and F.Van Harmelen "Reducing OWL-entailment to Description Logic Satisfiability" by Ian Horrocks and P.F. Patel-Schneider These papers can be downloaded from Ian Horrock's web site. 
If you are not familiar with description logics get a copy of the description logics handbook.

sound and 
OWL DL. 
The proof is by reduction to known decidable Description Logics.
