<s> In looking at the Level 3 working draft, I see that the DocumentOrder and TreePosition enums defined in the Node interface both use the names SAME and UNORDERED, but the numeric values will be different given the IDL as specified.  </s>
<s> I'd like to suggest that the ordering of the names be the same for those names that are shared between the two enums, or that using enums be avoided for this purpose.  </s>
<s> The constants should share values if they share names; this will make it easier to create readable language bindings for the DOM.  </s>

<s> Looking at this further, the use of the same names for two enumerations in the same scope is illegal IDL -- no IDL compiler should accept this.  </s>
<s> (There's also a minor error with extra semicolons between the enum definition and the typedef name, but let's consider that a simple typo!)  </s>
<s> I'll propose that a single enumeration should be used, and should define the names that are defined for TreePosition, but perhaps call it TreeOrder.  </s>
<s> That type can be used for both compareDocumentOrder() and compareTreePosition().  </s>

<s> "Tree order" doesn't seem to capture the meaning like "tree position" does.  </s>
<s> The distinction in names is intentional.  </s>
<s> While ancestors and descendants have order within a document using conventions of document order (which start tag was encountered first), they have no sequential order within a tree hierarchy.  </s>
<s> Being an ancestor or a descendant does not feel like "order" to me, but rather relative position of the nodes, which can be in one of four directions.  </s>

<s> OK. The name itself is of limited interest for me, but the current IDL isn't usable.  </s>
<s> If there are to be two different enumerations, there needs to be some prefix on the names from each ("ORDER_" and "POSITION_" come to mind, but I won't be terribly picky).  </s>
<s> I concur; there is a semantic problem with collapsing the two types.  </s>
<s> There could be two types if the names don't clash, or there could be a specific set of values, as for the NodeType constants.  </s>
<s> I'm not tied to either approach.  </s>
