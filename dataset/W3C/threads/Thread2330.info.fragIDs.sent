<s> The shorter length of most of the names is good.  </s>
<s> I really don't understand why x and y size for the display were separated.  </s>
<s> I can't really see caching using Vary based only on x or y.  </s>
<s> So, I'd suggest: UA-pix: x-size x y-size because it's shorter and no significant loss of functionlity.  </s>
<s> I also don't understand the rationale behind UA-media- type introducing many extra header names, instead of UA-media: type which seems like it works just as well conceptually, and fits perfectly into Vary based caching.  </s>
<s> Bottom line -- I'd like it to be more like it was before, but with the shorter names.  </s>

<s> Most of the syntax changes in the draft are to provide compliance with the transparent content negotiation method for features described in: draft-holtman-pre02-19.txt.  </s>
<s> It's not possible to supply more than one numeric argument, or any non-numeric argument to features.  </s>
<s> UA-pix was broken into two numeric arguments, and UA-media was split into  </s>
<s> a set of unique feature tags.  </s>
<s> I would like to see non-numeric values for feature tags allowed.  </s>

<s> UA-media-screen is inadequate to distinguish between scrolling and paged UI presentations.  </s>
<s> This is needed to obtain different versions of documents or style sheets etc. according to the presentation type.  </s>
<s> I suggest that the list of media tokens is extended to allow UA-media-screen-paged with UA-media-screen being taken to imply a scrolling presentation.  </s>

<s> I don't believe I understand the issues a non-scrolling display raises when interacting with other attributes such as screen size.  </s>
<s> If for example, the available vertical size of the URL is longer than the size of the display, how is this resolved?  </s>
<s> Is a paged resource with pages longer than requested better or worse than a vertically long resource?  </s>
<s> How does one calculate the vertical length of a resource when local treatment of fonts will cause the length to vary?  </s>
<s> I agree non-scrolling displays are relevant and the tag UA-media-screen-paged will be added to the draft.  </s>

<s> I'll put non-numeric values in the next transparent content negotiation draft.  </s>
<s> Your UA-media-* tag family is an excellent example of why they need to exist.  </s>
<s> It is much nicer, and more efficient, to say Accept-Features: UA-media=stationary than it is to say Accept-Features: UA-media-stationary, !UA-media-screen if you are going to print the response on stationary paper.  </s>
<s> Where appropriate, I'll rewrite the examples in my transparent content negotiation draft to use your feature tags.  </s>
<s> I plan to submit an updated transparent negotiation draft as an internet draft soon.  </s>
