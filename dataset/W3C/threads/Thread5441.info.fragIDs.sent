<s> Thank you Mike, Your observation about the "second" distributed hypermedia file puts things into perspective for me.  </s>
<s> I kept reading this, but wasn't "seeing" it because my legal-eze is not very polished.  </s>
<s> You idea about the Web Server fix is interesting, but I think this may only apply affectively to static files, like *.html Application files that write dynamic content (e.g., ASP, ASP.NET, PHP, ColdFusion, Witango, etc...) would be another issue.  </s>
<s> I personally would not want to see my Server interfering with my dynamic output.  </s>
<s> From a Designer/Programmer point of view, replacing OBJECT with some dynamic IFRAME mechanism is the probably the excellent perspective for implementing a work-around.  </s>
<s> Thank you again.  </s>

<s> Uhmmm, no, JavaScript and Flash could still talk fine, just like using JavaScript with frames, iframes, etc.  </s>

<s> Oh - I'm sure we can change our old scripts to deal with iframes - I was just hoping that whatever will be the solution for this mess won't force us to re-visit all our client's sites to rip out some long-forgotten scripts... Personally I felt rather insulted by how lightly it has been talked about "changing the plug-in mechanism", pretty much disregarding what will be involved organizationally and technically on the web development side.  </s>
<s> It's not like we'll just wave our magic HTML wand and everything starts working again.  </s>
<s> Due to the fact that there may be JavaScript-Flash interaction in many of these pages (among other things like Information Architecture and Design considerations), we may have to do individual fixes for each instance of Flash in a client's site, or may even be forced to consider a complete redesign of sections of sites - which will have to be explained to clients...  </s>
<s> I'm sure you are all looking forward to that aspect of the problem... :-) Will _any_ of the solutions offered by Microsoft leave the DOM intact so that current scripts will just continue to work?  </s>
<s> I thought the user-prompt method described by Microsoft would maybe do that.  </s>

<s> This is really a pedantic interpretation of the patent, but if a "second" hypermedia document is required as a workaround, perhaps a new HTTP request header could be used so that compliant browsers would instruct servers to reformat responses containing OBJECT tags into a secondary document.  </s>
<s> Accept: text/html; isolateobjects=1 -Mike Cubic Compass Software (BTW- Ideally, I'd prefer a settlement between MSFT and Eolas to avoid such a workaround altogether.  </s>
<s> My proposals are in no way meant discredit Eolas' patent or deny their right to a "David and Goliath" battle for licensing their alleged IP.)  </s>
<s> As I understand it, the problem (for Microsoft at least) is that the *browser* infringes the patent so it has to have the capability to process an OBJECT tag removed or modified so it doesn't work the same way.  </s>
<s> As such, even if every server in the world was modified as suggested, the browser as it stands would still be liable to a $1.47 per browser licence fee (because it has the capability).  </s>
<s> I would lose no sleep over Microsoft but, in principle, the same applies to all other browsers.  </s>
<s> So, if all browsers have to be changed anyway, there is no point in ALSO changing servers.  </s>
