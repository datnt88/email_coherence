Yes, 3253 leaves the definition of versioning behavior for live properties up to the standard that defines those live properties. 
So we should probably try to define the versioning behavior for 2518 properties in 2518bis. 
In general, the simplest default versioning behavior for a property such as DAV:displayname is to treat it the same as a dead property, i.e. it is an immutable copy of the value of that property on the VCR at CHECKIN time. 
Does this work for folks currently doing versioning? 
(I couldn't quite tell from Lisa's description whether this is the Xythos behavior or not).

However, no specification requires that to be either writable or protected on a version, so on some servers it won't be writable. 
Also no specification requires it to be either static or dynamic, so it's possible on some servers that the property would be protected, and it would change whenever the value on the VCR changed. 
I believe on Xythos WFS the displayname property is protected and static on versions. 
It will always have the same value as the displayname property of the VCR. 
From: Geoffrey M Clemm There is no concept of a "global" property of a version. 
Each version is a separate resource, with its own properties. 
So each version has its own DAV:displayname property. 
But there is a natural place to put a "global" property of a version, namely, as a property on the VersionHistory of that version.

That isn't quite the Xythos WFS behavior. 
If you MOVE a VCR, its displayname changes to the current name. 
Thus the displayname changes for all the versions as well. 
They aren't entirely immutable, in other words. 
I wouldn't put the versioning behavior of properties in RFC2518bis, however, we need to keep changes there down so we get finished in finite time and get draft standard status with tested interoperable features. 
If we think we can specify property behavior for versioning it could just as easily be done in a separate short draft. 
Speaking of this, what are the issues for the binding draft and the behavior of live properties? 
Does the binding draft sufficiently cover what happens with versioning in the mix?

May I ask what this is good for? 
If the DAV:displayname always equals the last path component, it's much simpler not to have it at all. 
[WYes, I know that IIS behaves the same -- however this doesn't make it right] behavior happens Which reminds me that having the DAV:displayname change with MOVE is deeply incompatible with bindings. 
In particular, consider one resource A with bindings a' and a''. 
How does the DAV:displayname obtained from a' change if you rename a''? 
Don't tell me that the property value will vary depending on the URL you use. 
Julian Yes. 
I'd really like to see a use case that conflicts with Geoff's definition. 
Julian I agree that we want to finish RFC2518bis in a finite amount of time, but I disagree that versioning behavior of RFC2518 properties should be defined in a separate draft. 
Any new WebDAV draft should fully define the behavior of any live property it defines, and versioning is a standard part of the WebDAV family (after all, it is "WebDAV", not "WebDA" :-).

Yes, but support for RFC3253 is not required for support of RFC2518. 
The core or base specification is responsible for core functionality. 
I think it encourages implementation of RFC2518 to keep it as simple as it can be, and keeping description of optional functionality (other than locking) outside of RFC2518 is one way to continue to keep it simple. 
Another reason is that versioning functionality is newer and has seen much less interoperability testing. 
One of the considerations for RFC2518bis is whether each feature specified meets the interoperability bar for IETF draft standard publication. 
For drafts like binding and ordering, I agree that new properties should have their versioning behavior specified as well as their non-versioning behavior if necessary. 
And for drafts after that, new properties may have to be defined with their binding behavior as well as versioning.
