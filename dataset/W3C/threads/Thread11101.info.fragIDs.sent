<s> For instance, let's say Jane Author is working in Word for Windows.  </s>
<s> The document she is creating does not conform to any DTD I know of.  </s>
<s> When its done, however, she wants to deliver it as XML.  </s>
<s> Why?  </s>
<s> Not a chance!  </s>
<s> Because:  </s>
<s> * Because XML is widely supported (we hope).  </s>
<s> RTF is available on every non-Unix system (and maybe on Unix systems too.)  </s>
<s> RTF is VERY poorly standardized and RTF import/export is a risky proposition.  </s>
<s> * Because XML is compact (we hope).  </s>
<s> She has no idea of the size of her files.  </s>
<s> If she's delivering them on the Web she does.  </s>
<s> If she's a half-decent web-master she knows exactly how long it takes to download her site on a 14.4K modem.  </s>
<s> Let's call her "Jane Webmeister" if it makes her seem more web-knowledgable.  </s>
<s> * Because XML will preserve whatever structure exists in the document (and Word allows quite a bit).  </s>
<s> She doesn't know what structure is, nor does she care.  </s>
<s> If it looks right, it is right.  </s>
<s> But it DOESN'T LOOK RIGHT because HTML can't allow it to look right.  </s>
<s> I have never seen a document exported from a word processor to HTML that "looked right."  </s>
<s> It's just too hard to map wordprocessor semantics into HTML primitives.  </s>
<s> WordProcessor users want to be able to export their documents and get something recognizable (as their document) out on the other end.  </s>
<s> (the [generated HTML] seldom is)  </s>
<s> * Because XML is more portable, more device-independent and more widely supported than Word for Windows format.  </s>
<s> We might create an XML that is more portable and device-independent, but more widely supported than the flagship application of the world's largest computer company ... pure fantasy!  </s>
<s> As I understood it, it was our goal that all browsers should support XML just as they do HTML.  </s>
<s> Since even Internet Explorer cannot open either RTF or Word files, I think that accomplishing our goal will have accomplished my  </s>
<s> "fantasy"! HTML is already more widely supported than Word and I don't see why XML shouldn't follow in its footsteps (though perhaps not displace it).  </s>
<s> * Because XML is "open" and standardized.  </s>
<s> Not important ... she'd rather have the latest vendor goodies.  </s>
<s> (Consider the experience with Netscape and HTML.)  </s>
<s> But XML _is_ the latest vendor goodies.  </s>
<s> It would play very well in the press release war for Microsoft to announce that they support not only HTML, but it's extensible cousin, XML which will allow intranet application deliverers to build fine-grained object model according to their own schemas and systems (I believe that this is Len's unburgled house), and for authors to create their own tags to dramatically reduce the amount of markup they have to do for a particular task.  </s>
<s> Think of it another way: XML could be the obvious delivery platform FOR the latest vendor goodies.  </s>
<s> XML gives Netscape the opportunity to claim that BLINK is a "standard" (since an XML document could certainly include BLINK ).  </s>
<s> In other words, XML is a standard that gives vendors flexibility to play their games, whereas HTML does not.  </s>
<s> For better or for worse, XML will be a W3C carte blanche to start the tag escalation war again.  </s>
<s> Luckily we will have a rich enough language that we can ignore that stuff and use what we want.  </s>
<s> I think the sooner we abandon the fantasy that anyone but SGML users will want XML the sooner we can focus on designing a viable language.  </s>
<s> I think that if we design a language that is meant to be used by the "traditional SGML users" it will get exactly as much vendor support as SGML.  </s>
<s> What will have been the point?  </s>
<s> XML must go beyond the SGML niche or it will be the last in line for vendor support behind CorelDraw graphics and RTF files.  </s>
<s> But I think you are wrong that other people don't want it.  </s>
<s> HTML users already want reliable fragment trasclusion and the ability to make their own tags.  </s>
<s> Traditional database users already want the ability to define their own schemas. .  </s>
<s> Microsoft and W3C are trying to [move processing "smarts"] into the document to work with the data in the document on the client side.  </s>
<s> The simpler the document format, the simpler that is.  </s>
<s> Working with crud like the typical HTML page would be VERY PAINFUL.  </s>
<s> Microsoft would love to use a [single language] for the delivery of all of their online documentation.  </s>
<s> Since they have already embraced SGML for their CD-ROM products, and the gap between Windows Help and HTML is large, XML seems the obvious choice.  </s>
<s> Here is my reasoning: 1.  </s>
<s> No vendor with a dominant market share will voluntarily adopt a standard  </s>
<s> that  </s>
<s> will open his market to competitors.  </s>
<s> Luckily, at this point Microsoft does _not_ have a dominant market share, and they have proved themselves willing to adopt a "standards pose" in order to play the good guy.  </s>
<s> They have even mentioned the acronym SGML in a [major press release] in that vein.  </s>
<s> Since they are already strolling down the [stylesheet street], I don't see why they wouldn't take an XML detour once we explain its benefits.  </s>
<s> 2. No users will press a vendor for XML support except those who already understand the value of a structured, renditionless information representation -- in other words, SGML users.  </s>
<s> Not true.  </s>
<s> SGML has always been easy to sell.  </s>
<s> Almost everyone who hears about it understands its value.  </s>
<s> It's the cost of using it that traditionally scares them off.  </s>
<s> Delivering SGML documents to Web clients is _expensive_ and _cumbersome_.  </s>
<s> If we can make it cheap and easy, I don't know why anyone would voluntarily limit themselves to a subset.  </s>
<s> 3. They won't get that support unless we make XML absurdly easy to implement.  </s>
<s> That means a delivery form of an SGML instance with no tricky parsing,no SGML declaration, and no DTD.  </s>

<s> Internet Explorer 3.0 can open any ActiveX enabled control, including Word.  </s>
<s> Word (or Excel, or whatever) will then take over the entire client viewing area, adding its own toolbar, i.e., there is seemless integration within the original window.  </s>
<s> It's also worth noting that URLs are now recognized in non-HTML documents (some mail systems support this feature as well).  </s>
<s> So Word  </s>
<s> users do not need to convert their documents in order to post them to the Web.  </s>
<s> Conversely, what user's think of as the browser has been de-coupled from the formats it reads.  </s>
<s> An ActiveX control can be created to support any document markup.  </s>
<s> So a new markup could be created and popularized, not by creating a dedicated browser that supports it, but by supplying an ActiveX control that supports it.  </s>
<s> XML could be introduced to the market in this way.  </s>

<s> And Word can now open Web documents.  </s>
<s> Sure has improved printing.  </s>
<s> ;-)  </s>
<s> Right. Welcome to framework design: to the notations, and beyond!  </s>
<s> The trick is, an XML viewer that just renders XML isn't as interesting an XML-handler that understands/inteprets other semantics of the XML elements.  </s>
<s> IOW, not just AN active-X, but lots of them, some dedicated to very simple XML aggregates.  </s>
<s> XML, IMO, allows us to send property values where some properties are complex as could be the case for a nest.  </s>
<s> Anyway, the Active X way is one way.  </s>
<s> It is a solid commercial way.  </s>
<s> VRML (which is actually an object language), so far is having a devil of a time with the issue of that interface.  </s>
<s> Best we leave it for the next phase.  </s>
<s> Yes, XML will go beyond SGML users, but because we are letting it go beyond SGML.  </s>
<s> We will find a lot of the same users.  </s>
