Hello All, We had a user of the CynthiaSays.com tester ask us an interesting question. 
The user asked us if when running CynthiaSyas could the tell the tester to ignore some specific lines even though they were not accessible! 
Upon further research we found the errors were caused by their host. 
The host included Advertising at the top of every page, say, Line 10-20 of the code. 
It was not accessible, and it appeared that there was no effort to make it accessible. 
We understood the Web Developers request and basically recommended that they: 1. 
Note it in their accessibility statement 2. Create a Skip Ad Link 3. Notify the host on the importance of making the add accessible (And of course real business reasons) 4. To send a request to the Host to make their ads accessible It would be easy to say get a new host, but this is simply not an option for all developers/web site owners. 
With this in mind we have made the advanced version of the CynthiaSays.Com tester allow a user to define lines to ignore, so that they can see how they are doing without the constant errors of the ad to confuse things. 
Now the Question: Has anyone had experiences with getting a host to make these ads accessible? 
Best Regards, Rob Yonaitis Remember when all validation tools were reserved for local basic content (and some still are)? 
How quickly you will forget. 
The AccVerify DS2 System is so advanced that it can differentiate between all content types and scripting on entering any content.

My feeling is that anyone with a serious site ought to be able to afford the relatively small annual cost of doing things properly, at least as far as having their HTML served exactly as they wrote it. 
Hi David, I cannot agree with you when you say: "My feeling is that anyone with a serious site ought to be able to afford the relatively small annual cost of doing things properly, at least as far as having their HTML served exactly as they wrote it." 
I believe that the seriousness doesn't have anything to do with the quantity of money that one has. 
And this can be specially excluding if we takes as norm, because there are places created by people or for organizations (for example organizations representatives of people with disabilities) that cannot approach what supposes a relatively small annual cost for you, for diverse circumstances. 
I believe that, in fact, one of the objectives of the accessibility is to facilitate the access to that type of people, to those that are not as fortunate as us and they don't have access to new computers or devices, connections of wide band, and services of payment hosting. 
But this it is only my humble opinion.

On Cost vs. Seriousness On Cost, I wonder what it would take to make the ads accessible. 
Perhaps we should look to the 50 Million a quarter company to go ahead and update their ad delivery process and the advertisers should demand it perhaps. 
For some people it is a real had decision where 10 bucks a month goes. 
Just my two cents. 
As we do more with flash, vs.net, all dev environments it seems like mere childs play for a web host to deliver accessible ads, and perhaps make more money in the long run. 
Cheers, Rob Yonaitis It attracts stares and hides from system bottlenecks. 
Traditional Desktop Apps struggle with system limitations, the AccVerify DS2 Professional System has been designed to be more stable, not to mention more striking. 
For the popular sites that I am thinking of, it would be quite a difficult AI problem. 
Currently the scripting that pops up the ads is just prefixed to the user's file and it's unlikely that they would give up scripted popups as banner-blindness is now so high that embedded adverts would be relatively ineffective (scripted popups are becoming ineffective amongst power users as they use browsers and proxies that suppress them). 
Doing it using scripting in a syntactically valid way is probably not too difficult, but doing it embedded, given that the site authors are not cooperating in the insertion of the adverts, would be quite a difficult AI problem in the general case.
