Hello, Tidy does not correctly work when I have a script ... /script nested inside a table ... /table . 
See the following example. 
The version is dated 30-April-2000. 
Thank you, Hubert. 
INPUT: document.write(" 
tr td text 1 /td /tr ") OUTPUT: document.write("") 
HTML (4.01) does not allow a script element directly inside a table . 
You'll need to either move the script inside a table cell ( th or td ), or have the script write the table element. 
Either of these changes needs the script to be modified, which is beyond Tidy's abilities.

Thank you. 
Since my table is designed to contained a variable number of rows, it would be no use putting the script inside a td cell. 
I think I shall opt for generating the whole table by script.

Daniel, upon second thought: should Tidy not generate an ERROR, when a script is found directly nested inside a table ?
