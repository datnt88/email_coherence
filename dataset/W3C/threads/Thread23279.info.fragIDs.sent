<s> Hallo, is there a common way to map the DOM IDL definitions to C++ abstract classes?  </s>
<s> There is a one from the OMG, but that one is too CORBA oriented.  </s>
<s> If there is none, could you please provide one?  </s>
<s> I would like to be sure that my C++ DOM applications are conformal to the DOM standard.  </s>
<s> Thanks.  </s>

<s> There have been several DOM bindings for C++.  </s>
<s> The problem is that there isn't a clear agreement on whether to make them behave like the Java and Javascript bindings, with automatic memory management, or like a more traditional C/C++ design with the requirement that users explicitly keep track of when data goes out of use and discard/free its memory at that time.  </s>
<s> Since the DOM WG left memory management as a topic to be addressed by the language binding, both approaches are entirely legitimate, and each has advantages and disadvantages -- implicit is significantly easier to use, explicit is easier to implement (and may be more efficient).  </s>
<s> There are also debates over which version of UTF-16 text strings should be used as the binding for DOMString, and a few smaller issues.  </s>
<s> So far, those disagreements -- and the fact that it's often a matter of picking an application niche rather than there being a clear better/worse choice -- has kept the DOM WG from officially recognizing any one specific solution and blessing a set of abstract classes to represent it.  </s>
<s> I'd love to see that gap closed, but we need to find some way to get the C++ community to duke it out and come up with a consensus proposal ... or at least a small number of proposals.  </s>
<s> You might want to look at existing C++ implementations of the DOM, to see where the disagreements are.  </s>
<s> Some (probably not all) of them are listed at Joe Kesselman / IBM Research  </s>
<s> Why does the DOMString type needs to be defined at all?  </s>
<s> I'm in  </s>
<s> the middle of adding support for non-ascii character sets to my DOMC module and decided the best thing to do was just support the locale dependant encoding (and wchar_t as a compile time option).  </s>
<s> I'm not sure if I'm going to do UTF-16 because there are no support functions in my env.  </s>
<s> anyway.  </s>

<s> The nature of a language binding is that it brings everything down to language-specific interfaces and types, so that code written against that binding will compile and run against all instances of that binding.  </s>
<s> If you don't nail down DOMString to _something_, you don't have a binding.  </s>
<s> The solution we've used in the past is for the binding to state what specific type DOMString is mapped to.  </s>
<s> Another solution would be to say that DOMString will itself be a specific interface in this binding, derived from or wrapped around whatever the implementation wants to use.  </s>
<s> There's nothing inherently wrong with providing a DOM-like API that supports only 8-bit characters in a specific encoding, if you know that's all your customers are going to want... but if you do so, be sure to clearly document that divergence and don't claim to be a fully compliant DOM implementation.  </s>
<s> You'll benefit from folks not having to relearn the API architecture, but you'll lose interoperability with other systems... and interoperability is part of the point of the DOM.  </s>
