<s> Thanks Marti for the suggestion.  </s>
<s> JCPenny wasn't as bad as I was hoping for.  </s>
<s> I am looking for examples where what looks like straight text is pulled from a separate .js  </s>
<s> file.  </s>
<s> I am also looking for examples where there are buttons (or links) that can't be tabbed to and can't be activated from the keyboard.  </s>
<s> I understand that events like "onMouseUp" can cause this effect, but I couldn't find a site that uses that sort of code (I suspect onClick has better cross-browser support).  </s>
<s> I have, of course, come across plenty of sites with these kinds of accessibility problems -- but I can't find one now that I am looking for a clear counter-example!  </s>

<s> Try JCPenny.com - they have a JavaScript navigation that uses a large noscript section that should make it accessible, however you have to turn off JavaScript to get that, even then the links don't show up in the link list for JFW.  </s>

<s> Thanks for all the great assistance with making JavaScript "pop-up" help usable with a text-only browser.  </s>
<s> Now I am looking for examples of the opposite kind... Can anyone point me towards sites where the JavaScript is of the sort that even with IE5+ and JFW 3.7 the pages are inaccessible?  </s>
<s> I am looking for examples where: (1) a screenreader cannot get at text, and/or (2) buttons cannot be tabbed to (that is, they must be activated by the mouse cursor).  </s>
<s> Also, if people can advise as to what the code would use to create these highly inaccessible pages, I would be most appreciative.  </s>
<s> For what it's worth, the "onClick" attribute is not what I am looking for.  </s>
<s> Said links can be tabbed to and activated with the return key!  </s>
<s> Thanks very much.  </s>

<s> try www.internet.com  </s>
<s> I think the menus across the top of the screen might be what you are looking for.  </s>
<s> They only appear when the mouse cursor runs across the dots beneath the menu titles (they are the diaganol ones...).  </s>
<s> I work in an adaptive technology lab and have users using Jaws 3.7 with refreshable brail and voice.  </s>
<s> We haven't figured out a way to access those menus yet.  </s>
<s> -brian  </s>
<s> Try http://www.hass.usu.edu/main.htm the top two links around the circle use a mouseover that show additional links.  </s>
<s> There is no way to get to those links using JAWS.  </s>
<s> Jeff Isom  </s>
<s> Thanks Brian!  </s>
<s> The "Select a Channel" is exactly the kind of counter-example that I am looking for at URL: For those using a screen reader, there are about two hundred choices (in fourteen drop down menus) between the links for "Dig Deeper: Power Search" and "internetnews.com".  </s>
<s> Much to my amazement, these hidden links ARE accessible in Lynx.  </s>
<s> (The category headers are lost however, due to missing ALT tags).  </s>
<s> The underlying JavaScript is quite daunting.  </s>
<s> From what I can tell, large JavaScript is used to hide the blocks and float them to assigned areas.  </s>
<s> OnMouseOver events toggle the hide attribute.  </s>
<s> Can any JavaScript junkies on the list boil the techniques being used down better than this?  </s>
<s> Are there things to look for in the source code that indicate that the JavaScript will be problematic?  </s>
<s> It seems to me that none of the individual techniques are necessarily inaccessible, but the combination of them is quite problematic.  </s>
<s> Is this assessment correct?  </s>
<s> By the way, the raw text IS in the source code.  </s>
<s> I was have some interesting effects using the browsers "Find (on this page)" command.  </s>
<s> I am curious as to how JFW handles these phantom finds.  </s>
<s> Since the hidden text is real text and not images, it is also worth noting that the drop-down menus scale nicely (except at the largest setting, the lowest items drop off the screen and are not available).  </s>
<s> Cheers, Bruce  </s>
<s> Thanks Jeff!  </s>
<s> This site is particularly problematic.  </s>
<s> This is a fair example of the other kind of JavaScript problem I was looking.  </s>
<s> Here, an OnMouseOver invokes a document.write  </s>
<s> from an external file.  </s>
<s> (In this case, http://www.hass.usu.edu/hierArrays.js or http://www.hass.usu.edu/hierMenus.js  </s>
<s> .) Despite being text, it is completely unavailable to the screen reader (and doesn't scale in the browser).  </s>
<s> It seems to me that JavaScript references to external files are particularly inaccessible.  </s>
<s> I say that this is only a "fair" counter example, because there are so many other problems with the page!  </s>
<s> It is my understanding that static document.write  </s>
<s> blocks (not sure why anyone would do this) are also totally inaccessible to screen readers.  </s>
<s> Can anyone confirm this for me?  </s>
<s> Other problems with the page include scrolling text on the left side bar.  </s>
<s> Can JFW read that text?  </s>
<s> The scrolling text is even more problematic since the two short paragraphs are themselves discrete links not available elsewhere on the page!  </s>
<s> Also, "Information for Students" and "General College Information" seem to be real hypertext (one can even tab to them), but they link only to false anchors within the page ( a href="#"...) so they don't do anything!  </s>
<s> In additional to all the above problems, Lynx has an even harder time since the actual homepage http://www.hass.usu.edu/index.htm  </s>
<s> doesn't redirect one to the "main" page http://www.hass.usu.edu/main.htm  </s>
<s> and instead comes up as a black screen (without any errors or warning) so one has to view the source to confirm that there isn't some other problem.  </s>
<s> Apparently, the author intended that users without scripting be instructed that they "Need a different browser" http://www.hass.usu.edu/sorry.htm , but since they use JavaScript to generate this information via redirection, people using older browsers won't even get this lame message!  </s>
<s> We have covered the problem repeatedly about OnMouseOver revealing/hiding significant content, be it text (both real and contained in graphics) or important images.  </s>
<s> To my mind, no really great (i.e., accessible _and_ compatible with Netscape 4x) work-arounds have suggested (except, of course, the fall-back to an alternative page).  </s>
<s> Is it fair to summarize the WAI experience and advice to be something like "onMouseOver may only be used for cosmetic, content-free effects"?  </s>
<s> Thanks very much.  </s>
<s> -- Bruce  </s>
