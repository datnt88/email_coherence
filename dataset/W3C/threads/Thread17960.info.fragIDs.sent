<s> 1. Define "claim" as it is ?or is it a set of claims are?  </s>
<s> applied from a particular guideline as meeting the applicable checkpoints for that level: A (all priority 1 checkpoints), AA (all priority 1 and priority 2), AAA (all checkpoints, priority 1, priority 2, and priority 3) All checkpoints at a priority level are applicable unless that functionality is explicitly inappropriate for the hardware/software and the claimed level.  </s>
<s> 3. Details of a claim It is not clear that only one claim applies to a particular UA.  </s>
<s> If many claims are required, as I understood it above (1 claim per applicable checkpoint), then much of the details of each claim are shareable.  </s>
<s> Why must they be repeated?  </s>
