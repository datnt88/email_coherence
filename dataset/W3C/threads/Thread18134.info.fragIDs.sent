A list of other DOM implementations can be found at, including DOM level 2 implementations can be found at: 5.2 If the user can modify HTML and XML content through the user interface, provide the same functionalityprogrammatically by conforming to the W3C Document Object Model (DOM) Level 2 Core and HTML Specifications and exporting the interfaces they define. 
[Priority 1] a. Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.0 for MS-Windows provides access to at least DOM level 1 through a COM interface. 
Once source of the implementation completeness of DOM level 1 specification can be found at: b. Amaya supports DOM. 
No information on DOM level supported or exporting of the DOM to other applications c. Mozzilla supports DOM level 1 and provides interfaces to other applications d. Opera plans on supporting DOM 2, current implementations do not allow for modification of the DOM e. 
A list of other DOM implementations can be found at, including DOM level 2 implementations can be found at: 5.3 For markup languages other than HTML and XML, provide programmatic access to content using standard APIs (e.g., platform-independent APIs and standard APIs for the operating system). 
[Priority 1] a. Accessibility plug-in for Acrobat PDF reader. 
It allows embedded text to be rendered as text for magnification and translation to speech and Braille by assistive technologies. 
b, Microsoft Office 2000. 
It uses active accessibility for assistive technology to access content. 
5.4 Provide programmatic read and write access to user agent user interface controls using standard APIs (e.g.,platform-independent APIs such as the W3C DOM; standard APIs defined for a specific operating system; and conventions for programming languages, plug-ins, virtual machine environments, etc.) [Priority 1] a. Microsoft Internet Explorer for Windows. 
Supports active accessibility and standard controls. 
b. Opera for Windows. 
Screen readers can access controls and text on screen. 
c. Microsoft Office 2000. 
Supports active accessibility and standard controls. 
5.5 Using standard APIs, provide programmatic alert of changes to content and user interface controls (including selection, content focus, and user interface focus). 
[Priority 1] a. Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.x for Windows. 
Supports active accessibility and standard controls. 
b. Microsoft Office 2000. 
Supports active accessibility and standard controls. 
c. 
Most browsers do this (NN, Amaya, Lynx, etc.) 5.6 Ensure that programmatic exchanges proceed in a timely manner. 
[Priority 2] a. 
For information about Microsoft IE 5.0, refer to b. IBM Home Page Reader project uses marking DOM nodes to improve access using Microsoft DOM in IE 5.7 For user agents that implement Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), provide programmatic access to CSS style sheets by conforming to the W3C Document Object Model (DOM) Level 2 Style Specification and exporting the interfaces it defines. 
[Priority 3] a. Refer to Jackaroo (a Scalable Vector Graphics viewer) for DOM access to CSS 1 [CSS1]. 
b. Microsoft Internet Explorer provides a partial implementation of the CSS style sheet module of DOM level 2 Checkpoints for user interface accessibility: 5.8 Follow operating system conventions that benefit accessibility. 
In particular, follow conventions for user interface design, keyboard configuration, product installation, and documentation. 
[Priority 2] a. Microsoft Internet Explorer for Windows. 
Supports active accessibility and standard controls. 
b. Microsoft Office 2000. 
Supports active accessibility and standard controls.

Jon, Home Page Reader 3.0 makes extensive use of the Document Object Model. 
This is a big change from HPR 2.5 and it allows us to support dynamic changes to the document due to dynamic page extensions such as those due to JavaScript implementations. 
Home Page Reader 3.0 also responds to standard input API. 
Both of these are required in our guidelines.
