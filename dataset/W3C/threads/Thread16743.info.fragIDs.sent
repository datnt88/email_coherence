[I've been wondering about this for ages now] 
hr has a semantic meaning - 
My current thinking is that sometimes, hr / represents "new context". 
A horizontal rule is a separator between two less related parts of a document, hence the big horizontal rule in the way. 
It is unfortunate that it is called "hr", for "nc - or newcontext" would have been much better, but there you are. 
If you use it as a newcontext marker, you should set some kind of aural property as well:- hr { pause-before: 2s; } To show that it marks up a new context, or even play some kind of sound. 
I still don't often use " hr / " preferring instead to use div class="newcontext" or div class="islandcontext" or whatever, because I'm a purist and I still see hr / as being defined [1] in HTML 4.01 [2] as a horizontal rule across the page, rather than a semantic element indicating a change in context. 
hr / is not included in XHTML Basic, and as part of the presentational module of XHTML m12n, I consider it to be deprecated.

It is a pity that the 4.01 spec only describes the visual rendering of hr / . 
The fact that it is not deprecated in 4.0, which deprecated most of the visual elements and attributes, indicates that it was not thought of in purely visual terms. 
I think all sighted readers know what a horizontal rule means (and that it is not the same as a horizontal line with no meaning) when they come across it in text, if only subconsciously, and indeed most people would automatically pause for longer when they came across it if reading aloud. 
Unfortunately it is a very much abused element, which is presumably why it was mentioned previously separately from other elements, and was used solely for presentation in the era when all presentation code had to come from the HTML. 
Ironically this has led to it now being under-used, as the graphically focused would tend to consider it lacking in functionality compared to a very wide image, etc. 
I wouldn't like to see it deprecated, as it has a firm semantic meaning when used correctly. 
In practice one use I put hr / to is separating elements which on graphical browsers are separated by position on screen. 
In the classic layout that most clients want (top banner, left hand navigation, money area to the right of the navigation) I place hr / elements with a display style of none and size=0 width=0 (to prevent them from rendering on non-CSS graphical browsers) after the top banner area and after the navigation menu. 
I find this makes the pages much more readable for sighted users of text-only browsers, though I doubt it has any effect on people using Braille or screen-readers.

I agree that the purist should go with div elements, and some kind of border seperating them. 
I guess that is what is anticipated by the newer specifications - I also recognise that in a visual rendering the line that appears is extremely helpful. 
Actually I thought hr stood for Have a Rest - in other words step back and start in some slightly fresh context. 
So, to rely on CSS, or to use hr for now - that is the question... (at least as I see it) Charles McCN [I've been wondering about this for ages now]

So, to rely on CSS, or to use hr for now - that is the question... Personally, I just moved from using pure div /CSS to using hr because at least with hr , there is at least the chance of getting some semantics into the document. 
Even though the hr brings along some presentational bits, these can be overriden with CSS. 
With div /CSS, one totally misses out on any semantics; this is a much greater loss, in my opinion. 
There is also the niceness about using empty elements (such as hr ) for dividers, than nesting elements (such as div ). 
The hr needs to have no knowledge of what comes before or after it, or how far it the new section extends into the document; it is merely a separator for the document at the current level of nesting. 
div's, on the other hand, need to encapsulate the entire block they are separating off. 
While this might seem clean from a clean-nested-block mentality, it makes the document unnecessarily complex, I feel.
