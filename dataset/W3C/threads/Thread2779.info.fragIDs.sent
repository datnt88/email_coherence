ISSUE: TE-IDENTITY. 
Action on Henrik: Add OPTIONAL for how the server handle it. 
That is, it is optional for the server to look at it but if it does then it SHOULD send 406 if it can't respond in the transfer encoding. 
We shouldn't disallow identity; q=0. 
In section 14.39 Change The TE request-header field is similar to Accept-Encoding, but restricts the transfer-codings (section 3.6) that are acceptable in the response. 
to The TE request-header field is similar to Accept-Encoding, but indicates the transfer-codings (section 3.6) that are preferred in the response. 
The client is not guaranteed that the server recognizes the information in a TE request header field. 
Comments?

Convoluted wording. 
How about The TE request-header field is similar to Accept-Encoding, but indicates the transfer-codings (section 3.6) that are preferred in the response. 
The server MAY ignore the TE request-header field. 
Isn't that what you mean?

Much better.
