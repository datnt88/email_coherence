People who are interested will be submitting pages and whilst the group would be able to help. 
it is important to build some form of search function as the the work is in progress and from the start. 
ie a box to type a keyword into, with responses limited to WAI pages, or possibly including members pages. 
it is very difficult to pre-define the interests of users woth such a broad 
based project.

group have a search their area facility on their homepage - Is this the sort of thing you mean?

Jonathan, Do you mean a search function for information on the WAI site, for instance 
as on the User Agent Guidelines Working Group home page at http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/ ? 
That is very easy to do and something that we'd planned to add to the WAI home page, and it could also be added to other working group pages, or to planning pages such as for the Review Teams and the Gallery. 
Alternatively 
we can just add a link to the W3C search function from any of our pages. 
Or do you mean something more specific to the review topics, for instance a 
way to search for Web sites that are undergoing review? 
Or a way for Web masters to search for information to help make their sites 
more accessible? 
That could also be addressed by the "Getting started on Web accessibility" or "How to make your site accessible" page that we've discussed a few times recently. 
That might be more effective than just telling people to search for the information.

I like the suggestions about what it might be. 
As I said I feel it's a little early to define what and how it is to work. 
However it is important to include it in the draft proposal.

Jonathan, Does your e-mail program allow you to keep part of the thread intact from 
the e-mail you are replying to? 
It would make some of your messages easier to follow.
