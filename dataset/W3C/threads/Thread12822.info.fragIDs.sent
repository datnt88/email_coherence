<s> Jonathan, Do you mean a search function for information on the WAI site, for instance  </s>
<s> as on the User Agent Guidelines Working Group home page at http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/ ?  </s>
<s> That is very easy to do and something that we'd planned to add to the WAI home page, and it could also be added to other working group pages, or to planning pages such as for the Review Teams and the Gallery.  </s>
<s> Alternatively  </s>
<s> we can just add a link to the W3C search function from any of our pages.  </s>
<s> Or do you mean something more specific to the review topics, for instance a  </s>
<s> way to search for Web sites that are undergoing review?  </s>
<s> Or a way for Web masters to search for information to help make their sites  </s>
<s> more accessible?  </s>
<s> That could also be addressed by the "Getting started on Web accessibility" or "How to make your site accessible" page that we've discussed a few times recently.  </s>
<s> That might be more effective than just telling people to search for the information.  </s>
