<s> Sent to xtech because it is a public list and talking about ideas based on a public spec (the last call spec http://www.w3.org/TR/xptr-framework/ on which comments are formally overdue - sorry) A possible issue, more related to EARL, with the Xpointer spec...  </s>
<s> It is mor reliable (given smart editors) to point to an ID than another kind of reference.  </s>
<s> Perhaps we should suggest that an Xpointer SHOULD point to an ID rather than another kind of pointer where possible.  </s>
<s> This could be checked automatically by testing whether the element in question, so could be a syntactically testable constraint.  </s>
<s> What do people think?  </s>

<s> Charles, have you been looking at my new EARL[1] stuff, or are we just thinking in parallel?  </s>
<s> It is indeed possible for a tool to generate its own IDs for every node in a DOM, and use these internally to reference them.  </s>
<s> An EARL tool can also export them, provided it makes available the IDs themselves (as in my latest tool[1]) and/or machine-readable instructions for reconsructing them as previously discussed ([2], etc).  </s>
<s> The former simplifies a document snapshot, whereas the latter is still necessary if we want rubustness across document changes.  </s>

<s> Nothing parallel about it.  </s>
<s> I'm shamelessly following on from your ideas.  </s>
<s> I'm looking at the simple case where an Xpointer constructed by counting elements or something points to a thing with an ID already.  </s>
<s> (if the tool constructs an ID it is not certain that other tools will have this available to refer to without having an agreed way of assigning ID, and that gets circular...)  </s>
<s> IDs are normally the most robust things over changes.  </s>
<s> So an Xpointer tool could check for an ID and ask if there was any reason not to use it...  </s>
<s> Chaals  </s>
<s> Is this really true?  </s>
<s> Where the pattern one wishes to persistently access is "the introductory subsection in the conformance section of the document" it is likely not.  </s>
<s> An example where an ID would be an inferior reference is the example from the RFB&amp;D website where, for dyslexic accomodation, they were putting the first word of a paragraph in one step larger font and the first letter of that word in yet a larger presentation.  </s>
<s> But this was all position-in-paragraph in its sense.  </s>
<s> For this, a contextual pattern is the more stable or persistent reference to what is the matter at hand.  </s>
<s> Relatives of the 'first-letter' pseudo-property are better referenced by pattern than by atomic ID.  </s>
<s> The use of relative URLs is analogous.  </s>
<s> Relative-role patterns are the highest and best expression for some references.  </s>
<s> It is not possible in general to say #id references are always better.  </s>
<s> They are better as of now in terms of down-level compatibility.  </s>
<s> This alone argues for the authoring technique as a transitional measure.  </s>
<s> An authoring technique that offers the ID as a reference handle where there is one does not have to be wired into the framework for XPointer.  </s>
<s> It can be tried and be deployed on its own merits independently.  </s>
<s> So far, The argument from general Web quality is debatable, and the argument that there is an access dependency even weaker.  </s>
<s> Can someone explain why this technique should have standing to be a WAI issue against the pointer framework.  </s>
<s> There are competing optimizations to be looked at, not a true generic preferece.  </s>
<s> Binding associations as locally as possible, in as context-independent a way as possible, is good for resource reusability by cut and paste.  </s>
<s> But there are processing reasons for define-before-use rules and getting things in the processing pipe associated to the root of the scope where they are generally available.  </s>
<s> The canonical form of reference includes acceptors articulating conditions on the context, and not just an identity of "a thing."  </s>
<s> The latter is efficient where it works, but we are as dependent on the fact that it doesn't always work as we are dependent on its advantages when it works.  </s>
<s> Al  </s>
<s> I've no objection to 'preferring' id's, but to say should is diminishing the point of xpointer imo.  </s>
<s> One of its uses is to specify the third para element, or the nth word in the mth para in the pth section.  </s>
<s> Seems like quite a restriction Charles?  </s>
