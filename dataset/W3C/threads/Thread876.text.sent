I need to update script section of the html through the tidylib for eg. function funct1() should be updated to function funct1() function new_function() ie I need to add one more function programmatically to script section of html document . 
can i use function tidyNodeIsSCRIPT( structTidyNode.htm 
TidyNode tnod ); and proceed please help me Renjith. 
Great question. 
One thing Tidy is _not_, nor will it become in the foreseeable future, is a Javascript parser. 
That said, I think you could do what you want much more easily with a Regex library and by separating the Javascript from the markup. 
Thus, my lo-tek(tm) suggestion, would be to keep your Javascript in a separate file, which you can generate as needed using your own code. 
hth, Charlie That function is usefull for me , I have set the value of an attribute of the node by NOT using public interfaces. 
How can i set the value of a node ? 
Note that even though public functions are not available i have set value to attribute of a node by following way , how can i apply this technique for our problem ? 
Which structures which member variable should be updated ? 
AttVal *controlVal; controlVal = GetAttrByName(child, "value"); controlVal- value = "renjith"; Renjith. 
There was just a long thread about this. 
My suggestion: tidyNodeGetText(). 
Problem 1: there is not way to _update_ a node in the public interface. 
But I thought you knew this. 
Problem 2: Your code may run into trouble if it is run on the same file more than once. 
I.e. you will add the same function every time. 
So you may still want to use a regular expression - or at a minimum strstr() - to make sure the function is not already present.
