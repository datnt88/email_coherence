<s> Yes, you would have to write a network redirector, which might involve modifying the application, or install WEbDrive.  </s>
<s> I don't believe Microsoft makes its Web Folders API available for common use, but you might look into that as well.  </s>
<s> The reason Word works but Notepad doesn't, is because Word has special code to use Web Folders (part of Network Places in some Windows OS) and Notepad doesn't have that special code.  </s>
<s> In other words, Web Folders can't be used by just any application automatically -- special code has to be added.  </s>

<s> documents the Web Folder object, which you should be able to use.  </s>
<s> I stopped on this one, but there should be more, especially in Office Developer if not elsewhere.  </s>
<s> You might want to look at making your application ODMA compliant as well.  </s>

<s> Sometimes.) This won't get you to Web Folders directly, but we are looking at building an ODMA DMS Driver that provides Web Folders / WebDAV access.  </s>
<s> I don't have a promise on when we will have done that, though I would like prototype code running by AIIM 2002 in the first full week of March.  </s>
<s> Let me know whether the C Language ODMA API is something that is usable in your application.  </s>
<s> (There is a dormant project to make an ActiveX / Automation interface, but I need to put a bomb in that volcano.) If the API is usable, I can sketch a way to migrate if you are interested.  </s>
<s> Otherwise, you might dig into using Web Folders directly.  </s>

<s> Hi all Some of you have helped me out in the past, so I am hoping this group will help me again.  </s>
<s> I need to build an IIS database-based webDAV server, for want of a better description.  </s>
<s> My fundamental problem seems to be that I can't stop IIS from taking the webDAV request, and, i) on the one hand, locking my script files as if they were the files to be manipulated rather than a script to be run, and ii) on the other (if I lock webDAV down in attempt to let the header rewrite pass to my script), forbidding passage of any webDAV HTTP at all to my header-rewriting ISAPI filter.  </s>
<s> I have to pass the webDAV traffic to a script where I can parse the headers and translate them into database calls.  </s>
<s> I don't want to have to write my own webDAV client to do this, as I would like the system to interface with Dreamweaver 4 and Homesite 5 webDAV clients, where the locking phenomena appears.  </s>
<s> I don't see any other way of implementing the multi-user, version-controlled asset management that my application needs.  </s>
<s> yours hopefully Simon  </s>
<s> Do you want to handle the Webdav calls by a script or an ISAPI extension?  </s>
<s> I think the ASP-dll won't let you do this - maybe perl or php via cgi or isapi... but what you can do is: build an ISAPI-filter manipulating the requested file by adding a new extension - saying ".dav" and than let IIS handel all incomming calls by a second ISAPI extension that does your job.  </s>
<s> This works fine throughout IIS3+.  </s>
<s> Henrik  </s>
<s> If by script you mean .ASP  </s>
<s> script, I don't think .ASP will let you intercept HTTP requests soon enough in the IIS chain of events.  </s>
<s> I'm feel pretty confident that you will have to get inside of IIS via ISAPI filters and C++.  </s>
<s> HTH, Steve  </s>
