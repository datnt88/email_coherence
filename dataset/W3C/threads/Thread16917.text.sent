Hi, all! 
I just had this exchange with my webmaster, who is trying to make my under-development site accessible: I said: "- all links that are live need to be the standard blue and underlined, going to the usual color (can't remember what that is at the moment) when clicked" He asked: "Is this an accessibility thing? 
I'm using the hover tags from CSS to get the menus to change colors during selection process. 
The drawback is that the underscoring disappears on regular text until the mouse appears over it. 
Any suggestions?" 
The site is at www.accessall.net/work/ 
Can any of you suggest what to do or who else to ask? 
This is 'way beyond my expertise. 
Thanks for whatever help you can give.

Your links don't need to be any particular color, though they need to have sufficient contrast against the blue bar. 
And since it's pretty obvious that the links are part of a navigation bar, They don't need to be underlined either. 
The text size does need to be bigger, though. 
Your webmaster shouldn't go below 1em in his font sizes or should use another method of determining font size.

What mouse? 
He's just told you that he thinks it is inaccessible to people with poor, or no, control of their hands. 
As it happens, Mozilla treats focus by tabbing from the keyboard to be :hover as well, but there is the potential for hunt the link here, and other browser may differ - older ones will ignore the :hover, but might act on the other colour information. 
My real concern would be people, particularly older people, but there are a lot in younger ages as well, who have not been brought up on a diet of Windows and GUI web browsers. 
Whilst not knowing the many, many, many conventions for hiding links on web pages, may lock them out of nearly all commercial web sites, if you hope that your site will bootstrap them into using the web, you need to be able to work within a set of instructions, for using the browser and web, that fits into less than half a page of handwriting. 
Looking for blue underlined text (given their instructor knows that their browser defaults that way) doesn't use up that much space, but the only realistic alternative to listing all the conventions for menu bars, etc., is to tell them to wave the mouse around watching the status line - not I think something that will encourage them to use the web, but something I've been forced to do, on occasions, even though I have used the web for a long time.
