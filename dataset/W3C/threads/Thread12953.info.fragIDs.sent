Hello Shawn and all, I could at last read the business case documents "from top to toe", as Judy says. 
I have some comments that you can find below. 
Regards Sylvie 1. 
General questions: a) On title change. 
Question: Now that we have decided to change the title of the document from "Presenting the Case for Web Accessibility" to: "Developing a Web Accessibility Business Case for Your Organization", should the following sentence (for example in technical factors) in the introduction be changed too? 
Actual sentence: "This page describes financial factors relating to Web accessibility. 
It is part of a resource suite that also describes the social, technical, and legal and policy factors for consideration in presenting a case for Web accessibility." 
Changing to: "This page describes financial factors relating to Web accessibility. 
It is part of a resource suite that also describes the social, technical, and legal and policy factors for consideration in developing a Web accessibility business case for your organization". 
I suppose that such phrases occur several times through all the documents. 
As I said at last call, I can live with the title change, although I think it is very long. 
But I wonder what the phrase "in your organization" exactly means? 
Does it mean that you talk directly to the people responsible of one organization? 
If so, we cannot speak about one organization anymore but all the time state: if your organization is a governmental organization, you should think about this or that. 
Example: in financial factors you have the phrase: "An organization's efforts to make its Web site accessible often has a financial impact, and can result in positive return on investment and cost efficiencies." 
Does the new title mean we would have to write: "The efforts of your organization to make its Web site accessible often have a financial impact, and can result in positive return on investment and cost efficiencies." 
I am not sure if this comment is understandable. 
My question here is in relation to the world "your" in the title of the document. 
2. Comments to the different pages: a) In social factor page: I still have difficulties (when reading it) remebering what CSR (corporate social responsibility) and SRI (socially responsible investing) means. 
Is it a current phrase in English? 
Question to those who want to translate it into other languages: what effect do we intend with those acronyms? 
Should we invent an acronym in the translations of the document? 
b) In technical factors. 
Introduction : "For example, an organization with very limited personnel resources might be more interested in reducing site development and maintenance time, while another organization that focuses on cutting-edge technology might be more interested in interoperability and being prepared for advanced Web technologies" To my mind, this is a very long sentence, and it seems to me not easy to follow what it exactly meant. 
In particular, I wonder how I could translate "cutting-edge technology" and if it is a current wording in English or rather jargon. 
- in: "Reduce Site Development and Maintenance Time" First list, first bullet: "? Reduce site-wide style change time and effort by defining presentation through a style sheet and using proper HTML to markup structure. 
(WCAG 1.0 Checkpoint 3.1, 3.3, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 5.4) [@@ need to explain that can change in one style sheet, rather then in each HTML page @@]" The sentence is not clear to me. 
Moreover, after the list of checkpoint there is still an action item. 
Will it be edited after Wednesday or will it stay as it is? 
- In bullet: "reduce redesign and translation time" there is also an action item. 
Do you expect us to write something or is it planned to be edited after Wednesday? 
- In the paragraph: "Be Prepared for Advanced Web Technologies" first bullet: "Allow for syndication of information by using metadata and representing it using resource description framework (RDF) . 
(WCAG 1.0 Checkpoint 13.2)" Is the term "syndication of information a current term that can be understood by anybody? 
- Second bullet: "? Simplify migration and backwards-compatibility by defining presentation through a style sheet, using proper HTML@@ to markup structure..." Is the term "migration and backwards-compatibility" usual term and can it be understood by anybody? 
Translation questions: In financial factors: viral marketing. 
For those who are not native speakers is this clear enough and do you think it is possible to translate it in your language? 
c) In financial factors: In the part "initial cost" in "Potential initial capital expenditures related to Web accessibility include:" Purchasing assistive technologies". 
We should not forget that it is not enough to purchase assistive technologies. 
But people should also follow a training on how to use and implement assistive technologies to test their Web site. 
Or something should be written on asking people using those technologies to test the sites. 
What do you think? 
- In section "on-going costs" in the bullet: additional testing time. 
Wouldn't it be useful to add something explaining how tests should be fullfilled with assistive technologies: in inviting users or in asking people of the organization to test the prototypes with assistive technologies they have learned to use? 
Or does it imply that the organization has employees with disabilities using those assistive technologies? 
If they ask people outside of the organisation to test their prototypes is there a cost to add (pay people who do the test) or is there a problem of confidentiality because people are testing internal Web sites? 
If the tests are done inside of the organisation: it means that people who do the test have to know the assistive technology, that is they have to be trained to use assistive technologies. 
(that costs time). 
Or if they are disabled it means that they have to invest time testing the site (this should be included in the part on additional time to make Web sites accessible). 
- In section Identifying Legal and Policy Factors for a Specific Organization, bullet: Identifying Legal and Policy Factors for a Specific Organization Bullet: @@ think this needs to be a section below &amp; not a question@@ Is it helpful to include the risk of failing to provide accessible Web sites?." I do not understand what this exactly meeans. 
[End of comments] 
Is the term "migration and backwards-compatibility" [or whichever arcana now in place] usual term and can it be understood by anybody? 
This is the crux of the clear/simple dilemma. 
It plainly bedevils the WCAG WG and probably ALL W3C documents. 
I hope we can "repair" some of this language (that, particularly people with other languges, is troublesome) that is more easily located than corrected. 
Love.

Version: 6.0.620 / Virus Database: 399 - Release Date: 3/11/2004 
A. Social Factors page Following wording seems odd : - enhanced reputation to potential customers... - Corporate social responsibility (CSR), also called corporate citizenship and other terms ... B. Financial Factors: 1. Too long and winding: "This page provides questions to help focus how financial factors are covered in the business case for a specific organization, and examples of how financial factors can be addressed in a customized case for Web accessibility." 2. I suggest a replacement for "The following points can help determine how financial factors are covered in a specific organization's business case for Web accessibility:" SP: Answers to the following questions might helpidentify the impact of Web accessibility on the org.'s financial costs and benefits. 
(This suggestion applies to other pages as well) 3. Questions (e.g. for Financial factors page): Can the org.'s website be made to increasingly influence its revenues and the manner in which it conducts its operations? 
- What is the present state of Web accessibility? 
- Can the org.'s accessibilitty initiative be made to dovetail with the org.'s wider usability initiative? 
- Does the legal risk of operating an inaccessible website have a financial impact ? 
I strongly feel listing questions in abulleted form helps to focus better. 
The material following the questions can be moved to an introductory / background part. 
C. Legal Factors page Questions re-phrased as under to avoid explanation: - Is the organization required by law or other mandate to make its Website accessible? 
- Does the organization have a formal Web accessibility policy? 
- What are the risks of not having an accessible website? 
2. Repetition: Last question again says easier to build accessibility from start... 
This is said in other pages too. 
The document should be as concise as possible and should make a point at the appropriate place and go on. 
It should not depend on repetition to get the point across. 
D. Technical Factors 
1. Replacement text suggested for para starting with "The technical performance benefits related to Web accessibility vary according to the type of organization and type of Web site." 
SP: Web accessibility solutions often result in improved technical performance; its impact differs from organization to organization and by the nature and size of the website. 
Serverload is critical for an organization that depends heavily on its extensive website for its business but may not be critical for a not for profit organization with just a few pages of Web content which it hosts through a service provider. 
Efficiency of Web content maintenance might be important for a news organization whose content changes several times a day. 
Enabling content on different configurations might be important to another enterprise. 
E. Editorial: (only one so please pardon its inclusion here) 1. 
This word needs to be corrected in many places throughout the suite: organziations Thanks, Sailesh Panchang Senior Accessibility Engineer Deque Systems,11180 Sunrise Valley Drive, 4th Floor, Reston VA 20191 E-mail: sailesh.panchang@deque.com

On the other hand, the sections might be completely independently used in the formation of a particular business plan, which might imply that it's not actually one document being repetitive, but several separate "bags" from which are selected those applicable to the business plan being built, therefore needing "repetition".
