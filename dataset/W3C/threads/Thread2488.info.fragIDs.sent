At different points during the Memphis meetings we talked about the need/possibility of splitting state management into a seperate working group. 
As a straw poll, what do people think the work of such a group would be, and is that work best dealt with in a different group? 
regards, Ted Hardie 
I don't think a new WG is needed with all the salient overhead ... but we do need to take the task 'offline' to a reconsituted and more open subgroup. 
What I think we primarily need is is an offer to host the mail list serving the group along with a list archive. 
(The largely dormant mail list used by the original state managment sub-group is actually run as a sendmail alias with heavy duty manual effort required as a result to add to the list. 
No echo back to submitter, no archive, etc.)

I'm setting up a mailing list and will send a message to http-wg when it's available (within a day or two).
