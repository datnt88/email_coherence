<s> Looks good.  </s>
<s> Would it be useful to tag the last pre-CR copy so that we can easily call it back if needed.  </s>
<s> It had some resolution text and the like that may be useful if questions are brought up.  </s>

<s> No problem, I'd blanked out the time for the virtual F2F anyway so when Wed call was cancelled I just used that time.  </s>
<s> I think we can send closing for 410 (no action req'd) and I think we closed 411 during Tues call so we can do that too.  </s>
<s> 412 is a non-issue for the spec.  </s>
<s> Yup, all done.  </s>

<s> Indeed! I had hoped to find some time next week, but you beat me to it.  </s>
