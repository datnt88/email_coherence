I've updated the edtodo[1] list with everything that I know about. 
If I've missed anything, either let me know, or update the file yourself. 
I've also converted it xhtml 1.0 strict.

Looks good. 
Would it be useful to tag the last pre-CR copy so that we can easily call it back if needed. 
It had some resolution text and the like that may be useful if questions are brought up.

Done. Rev 1.148 is now tagged with the tag 'PreCR' Gudge 
Marc, 
I see we're all done now? 
Thanks for having completed the 
remaining AIs. 
So you did udpate the stylesheet as well? 
Jean-Jacques. 
No problem, I'd blanked out the time for the virtual F2F anyway so when Wed call was cancelled I just used that time. 
I think we can send closing for 410 (no action req'd) and I think we closed 411 during Tues call so we can do that too. 
412 is a non-issue for the spec. 
Yup, all done. 
Marc.

Indeed, great job Marc!

Indeed! I had hoped to find some time next week, but you beat me to it. 
So, I can go back to planning the F2F. 
Thanks!
