Even though this may (or may not) be DOM Level 1 compliant, it will get you nowhere with Netscape 4.x. 
This browser simply doesn't support anything close to DOM Level 1, instead having its own proprietary DOM. 
Wait for Gecko (Netscape 5's new rendering engine by Mozilla)! 
We are using a JavaScript function to resize a frame in real time. 
This works well in IE4.x but not in Netscape 4.x. 
We want to be sure this type of method for modifying attributes is DOM Level 1 Compliant (my client needs this guarantee). 
Anybody can help? 
The function is: function resize() { if (high==100) high =300 else high=100 parent.innerFr.rows 
= high +",*"; Guzm?n Salvador WebMedia Spain http://www.webmedia.es/

See Arnaud Le Hors - W3C, DOM Activity Lead - I suspect the original poster wanted something that works in Netscape 4.X. 
For those that just want to test the JavaScript DOM interface in mozilla now you may obtain a build of Mozilla from mozilla.org (www.mozilla.org) 
or the DocZilla alpha (www.doczilla.com). 
The DocZilla alpha is time-bombed to expire at the end of this month but there will be a fresh version put in place sometime in the very near future. 
The DocZilla alpha contains demos showing the use of the DOM through JavaScript. 
The DOM, in my experience, has reached a very high level of completion and reliability in either recent mozilla builds or DocZilla.
