Checkpoint 4.4 Slow Multimedia The response is either to drop this requirement or to make the requirement broader. 
I am not sure how we make it broader. 
We may have more implementation if we look at talking book technologies. 
I suggest we keep and see if we can improve our implementation experience by looking at talking book technologies. 
Any suggests on how to make this broader? 
What are the implications of this for real time streaming technologies?

I was thinking of adding it in somewhere else as part of a requirement. 
as far as I know, you can do this with daisy ebooks.

Control over playback speed gets some attention from Daisybook players. 
I'll ask around and try to get a list of exactly who is doing it now. 
As of this fall, we hope to have it integrated with the AMIS project (new Daisy player from JSRPD). 
Control over speed of streaming media could be an issue that we will run into, depending on how the media player components (ex, windows media player, Java media framework) behave.

Marisa, That would be great.

WWW: http://www.w3.org/wai/ua "Jon Gunderson" jongund@uiuc.edu it now. 
(new run Windows Media Player as an application doesn't support slowing of streaming media. 
However DirectAnimation which can also playback windows media content can play it back slower * so hopefully for WMP at least it's not too much of a technical issue. 
DA is no longer "supported" by MS though - You could currently build an interface to a WMP player that could control speed - I've done one with audio. 
Jim. 
(Apologies for the meeting, I am always unavailable then.) * There may be a live problem actually, I _think_ I've seen it done with live rather than just archive but I'm not completely positive. 
Here are Daisy players that support time-scale modification: Hardware players: PlexTalk by Plextor (http://www.plextalk.org/) 
Victor Reader by VisuAide (http://www.visuaide.com/dtbsol.html) 
Software players: Victor Soft reader by VisuAide (http://www.visuaide.com/dtbsol.html) 
LpPlayer by Labyrinten (http://www.labyrinten.se/english/index.html) 
There will soon be a third addition in the hardware player category (Telex). 
These are all solid consumer products that have been implemented internationally. 
It might be worth noting that speed control is a feature of SMIL playback capabilities, as the DAISY format uses SMIL to represent synchronzed multimedia types. 
Also, the above examples all use local media, not streamed. 
For more about DAISY, www.daisy.org. 
-marisa There is a plugin from eNounce (http://www.enounce.com/) 
that allows time scale modification in windows media player and real player. 
I haven't tried it yet, but their website implies support for streaming.
