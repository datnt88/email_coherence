<s> Well, there are two approaches.  </s>
<s> An example is that some users prefer well-animated content, and others prefer non-animated content.  </s>
<s> In some instances this can be decided by the users themselves - decent browsers allow the user to specify that they don't want content to be animated, or even that by default they don't want types of content that are likely to be animated.  </s>
<s> And the other approach, as Lisa pointed out (beating Kynn to the jump - hi  </s>

<s> This introduces complexity, you need some way to manage the choice of the users, whilst I acknowledge there's a CC/PP proposal, we have no implementations (and I hope we never do, it goes against my own views on accessibility) so you have to provide a user interface, this interface is likely be its very nature to be confusing and complicated for a user to relearn on each site they may visit, and that's where the site designer is happy to compromise their basic interface/design of what the site's actual content is about to provide these additional options.  </s>
<s> For things like animation, the solution surely has to rest with the user in the UserAgent, I can't see how any recommendation could credibly suggest that it be done on a page by page basis.  </s>

<s> The one you send them to isn't really "concrete examples" either - no code.  </s>
<s> By putting the checklist into tabular form it's two clicks deep to from checkpoint 1.1.  </s>

<s> Lets take a table layout, not good for some who have old screen readers, that just read strait across the page or have linearization problems.  </s>
<s> To achieve the same effect in CSS implies that in reality many browsers will  </s>
<s> not implement the layout as intended, and that is a real life problem for  </s>
<s> designers with a professional image to keep up.  </s>
<s> To have a more linerized page layout is a problem for people with low motor skills for whom scrolling down is hard.  </s>
<s> In each of these implentaions some users will be left with a implementations level which is doable but difficult.  </s>
<s> Some things just contradict - keep the bandwidth low, but illustrate.  </s>
<s> So as I said basic accessibility works on one page.  </s>
<s> But I want ALL my users to surf and not crawl.  </s>
<s> In terms of how I do this personally, I have a link to more accessible renderings.  </s>
<s> If the user selects it, I can set an option to default to this rendering on any GF site.  </s>
<s> Lisa DISCUSSED  </s>
<s> Script or not using tables could be used to solve this, how many of these screen readers are there really in use whereby they have screen readers who can't manage that, for windows I could write a table reader in about an hour, would be about a 5k download and cost nothing, if there are really are users with that limitation, please put me in touch I could help them a lot...  </s>
<s> will  </s>
<s> for  </s>
<s> There are plenty of representations that "professionals" manage without resorting to tables that linearise very poorly, this kind of HTML is the result of authoring tools generally, rather than human design, in any case what exactly are you suggesting of CSS that really fails that often?  </s>
<s> Jim.  </s>
<s> They only contract if you take a data-centric model of the web instead of a user-centric model.  </s>
<s> In a user-centric model, the server and/or client processes _transform_ the data to meet the needs of the user (this is the Edapta model I've been talking about since before I even heard of Edapta).  </s>
<s> In a data-centric model, the user, server, and client have to adapt themselves to fit the needs of the data.  </s>
<s> Data-centric typically says "here's the data first, we'll pretend it's all complete, and if you can't use it then there's probably something wrong with you."  </s>
<s> A user centric model says "let's give you the best access possible even if it means we have to compensate for something on your end or even a factor that's beyond your control."  </s>
<s> In the user-centric model, illustrations and bandwidth do not conflict but rather complement.  </s>
<s> There is a trade-off, yes -- if you're low bandwidth _and_ you want pictures, a choice needs to be made.  </s>
<s> But that choice should be the user's choice and the server should respect it, not a single decision made by the web designer for all models of user interaction.  </s>
<s> (Technical scenario: User has set preferences via CC/PP to indicate what the optimal level of graphical content is -- a continuum should exist from "no graphics" to "any graphics possible" -- as well as the characteristics of the network connection being transmitted in the CC/PP profile as well.  </s>
<s> The end server recognizes the user's preferences and the constraints of the connection and provides the appropriate level of graphical detail.  </s>
<s> The user should be able to EXCEED the default as well, to allow for an "extended graphical version" which is beyond the base visual experience, such as filling in illustrative pictures whenever possible [*].  </s>
<s> This is how you produce an optimal user interface based on the needs of the _specific_ user.) --Kynn [*] Many news services automatically add links to news stories about companies or famous people -- see Yahoo! news for example.  </s>
<s> It wouldn't be hard to similarly include a small thumbnail of George Bush, the trademarked logos of corporations, or a link to a map of Afghanistan or wherever, if producing an extended graphical version.  </s>

<s> It would also be trivial to write a proxy that changes tables into CSS which could be accessed by people with screenreaders -- screenreaders which don't linearize properly are, in my opinion, a Solved Problem.  </s>
<s> Now, that doesn't mean _tables which don't linearize properly_ aren't still a problem, and by that I mean poor HTML coding.  </s>
<s> I myself have been guilty of that in the past, once with a proposed redesign for an employer's site, which went: START OF TABLE ROW ONE: CELL ONE: Header A CELL TWO: Header B CELL THREE: Header C ROW TWO: CELL ONE: List of items in category A CELL TWO: List of items in category B CELL THREE: List of items in category C END OF TABLE Now, if you'll notice, that's actually fairly "correct" HTML.  </s>
<s> It's not really broken via spec, but it's borken when it comes to interpretation by screenreader.  </s>
<s> (It's actually a limitation both of HTML and of screenreaders that the above didn't work correctly; the screenreaders can't take the full blame because the HTML spec is far too loose for the kind of data association we need here.  </s>
<s> More on this if I can make Reef's single authoring markup languages public.) --Kynn Kynn Bartlett kynn@reef.com  </s>
