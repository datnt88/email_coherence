Jany Usually it's just a matter of restricting postings to people subscribed to the list.

Jany The list is open, i.e. anyone can send to it. 
I am sending a complaint to yahoo.com - I have had 21 of these messages so far. 
They all seem to be advertising websites on geocities.com 
If we all complain, maybe they'll take action. 
* kate [Mon, 31/03/2003 at 07:23 -0500] That's what I don't understand. 
All this garbage seems to come through the list. 
I believed that such messages were bounced to the sender. 
Jany I had 33. 
I thought my machine had contracted a virus. 
I don't usually post to this group, I'm just learning HTML. 
I thought the "poster spam" warranted attention.

I looked into it. 
The way to report the spammer is to forward one of the messages to abuse@yahoo.com. 
Had I read any of the messages, I would be sure to boycott all products or services advertised! 
hth, Charlie Not to beat a dead horse, but we should probably count ourselves as lucky. 
Some public lists I have seen are 99% spam, and I would never post to those lists. 
It is unfortunate that the html-tidy archives are publically available for spam harvesters to troll - a technique that works for Apple Computer's public list archives, is to simply password protect the archives with a documented password that must be entered to continue; other mailing list archives obscure the poster's EMail address. 
I maintain the "tidy-develop" mailing list - this is a closed list, and the users never get to see the spam that gets sent to the list administrator - on a good day I receive 1 piece of spam, on a bad day, it is currently running at about 3-4 pieces. 
I see spam from the same senders occasionally, both to personal EMail addresses, and to lists I am a member of - I recently rejoined the "html-tidy", and I hope that didn't trigger this latest event.

To which address will you send your mail ? 
abuse@yahoo.com 
I originally sent a covering note with one of the spams as an attachment. 
I got a reply saying the full headers were not there (they were, of course: I checked) and they cannot receive attachments. 
I resent the complaint, with the entire message (including headers) cut-and-pasted in. 
They haven't bothered to reply. 
[Apologies for slow response: Pipex mail servers had a problem] I had another bunch just now and will be complaining about *all* of those. 
Fortunately I don't get bothered with much spam of late. 
I have discovered after blocking just some of them (I have set up my yahoo account to operate from within Outlook Express, which I would recommend others to do also) a lot of the other spam no longer comes through, this confirms that a lot of them are originating from the same organization/s, just with spoofed headers &amp; sender names etc. 
Maybe you should get to know some of the hacker/s and or hacking groups and after finding out the spammer/s true identity, anonymously mailbomb them (with some sort of subtle warning message included in the email/s), giving them some of their own medicine.
