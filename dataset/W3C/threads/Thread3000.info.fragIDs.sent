<s> As I think I mentioned before, the IETF revised policies on us in RFC 2434, in the time between when we submitted the draft standard and its approval.  </s>
<s> No one noticed this change at the time.  </s>
<s> In sections 3.5 and 3.6 of we define content and transfer coding values that require registration.  </s>
<s> RFC 2435 requires us to specify whether new values need to be reviewed, for what purpose and/or if they need approval.  </s>
<s> We are silent on the approval process.  </s>
<s> From looking at section 2 of 2435, I believe we are  </s>
<s> In 3.5 we now say: "New content-coding value tokens SHOULD be registered; to allow interoperability between clients and servers, specifications of the content coding algorithms needed to implement a new value SHOULD be publicly available and adequate for independent implementation, and conform to the purpose of content coding defined in this section."  </s>
<s> Unless there are complaints, I plan to revise this to say: "New content-coding value tokens SHOULD be registered; to allow interoperability between clients and servers, specifications of the content coding algorithms needed to implement a new value SHOULD be publicly available and adequate for independent implementation, and conform to the purpose of content coding defined in this section.  </s>
<s> New registrations are reviewed and approved by the IESG according to these criteria."  </s>
<s> Since other standards bodies may define documents that might be very appropriate for content and transfer codings, it seems to me that just leaving it to the IESG to evaluate is the correct approach.  </s>

<s> I think this is a reasonable approach.  </s>
<s> I do have concerns about the IESG's ability to keep up with registrations in general, but it's not likely that there will be a flood of new content-codings and transfer-codings (I hope).  </s>
<s> It may be helpful to review the "purpose of content coding defined in this section" to make sure that it gives complete and accurate guidance to the IESG.  </s>
<s> In particular, I've seen some interest in the definition of format-specific content- and transfer-codings (for example, one that allows more efficient transfer of XML, based on the structure of the body).  </s>
<s> There isn't any text in 3.5 that disallows non-generic codings; can this be taken to mean that the IESG shouldn't have any problem with registering such a coding?  </s>
<s> Regards,  </s>

<s> It might also be a good idea to point out (in the revised version of RFC2616) that there is a soon-to-be?  </s>
<s> BCP "Registration procedures for message header fields" Klyne, Nottingham, Mogul According to the IETF ID Tracker, the IESG has approved an earlier draft as a BCP (back in May) but there are some minor revisions that require "AD followup".  </s>
<s> I think it would be safe to add a non-normative reference, given that this ID is far enough through the IESG process that it should have an RFC number long before the Full Standard for HTTP/1.1 could be an RFC.  </s>
<s> (Yes, it might be naive to trust the IESG process this much.)  </s>
<s> I would suggest putting something in 4.2 (Message Headers) along the lines of: All HTTP header field-names SHOULD be registered according to the procedure in [draft-klyne-msghdr-registry-07].  </s>
<s> I believe that one of my co-authors on this I-D has already prepared an initial list of field-names including fields from all extant HTTP-related RFCs.  </s>

<s> Unless there are complaints, I plan to revise [3.5] to say: "New content-coding value tokens SHOULD be registered; to allow interoperability between clients and servers, specifications of the content coding algorithms needed to implement a new value SHOULD be publicly available and adequate for independent implementation, and conform to the purpose of content coding defined in this section.  </s>
<s> New registrations are reviewed and approved by the IESG according to these criteria."  </s>
<s> I note that if the reference is non-normative, we can't say SHOULD.  </s>
<s> First of all, I'm not really sure if a reference to a BCP must be non-normative.  </s>
<s> What's the IETF rule about this?  </s>
<s> I did a quick skim of RFC2026 (especially section 5.1) but I couldn't figure this out.  </s>
<s> Note that RFC2026 is itself a BCP but people seem to treat it as normative :-) More important, if you look at the language you proposed for 3.5, you have a normative (SHOULD) requirement for registration, but a non-normative (passive-verb) statement about how this registration will take place.  </s>
<s> That seems odd -- requiring registration but not requiring people to follow a specific registration procedure?  </s>
<s> -- but perhaps this is the best we can do.  </s>
<s> If so, I'll change my suggestion for 4.2 to mirror your language for 3.5: All HTTP header field-names SHOULD be registered; header field-names are registered according to the procedure in [draft-klyne-msghdr-registry-07].  </s>
<s> Still, on the whole I would prefer to find a way to make both of these statements "normative all the way down." -Jeff  </s>
<s> If you can save it as XML using a recent version of Word (maybe someone at MS can help there) and send it to me, I will convert it to XML RFC form.  </s>
<s> ....Roy  </s>
<s> Certainly, I have no copy of word so recent.  </s>
<s> Donations of XML greatly appreciated :-).  </s>
<s> Anyone who can do so I'd be happy (relieved) to send the Word file to... - Jim  </s>
