<s> Telecon with Scott Luebking 10 October 97 He is at Berkeley.  </s>
<s> He wrote a browser and got to observe blind people using it.  </s>
<s> It had both absolute and relative motion commands to move around from cell to cell within a table.  </s>
<s> It had a variable level of header regurgitation with cell contents.  </s>
<s> The users seemed to get the hang of the tables with this.  </s>
<s> The header regurgitation was based on header data propagated to the browser's runtime data structures for the cell.  </s>
<s> It was all there all the time with variable levels of what got shown or hidden.  </s>
<s> This at least requires that one knows which headers go with which cells.  </s>
<s> His idea for how to clearly indicate this header/row association is to have attributes in the TABLE declaration (root) itself saying which rows contain column heads and which columns contain row heads.  </s>
<s> -- Al Gilman  </s>
<s> This matches my understanding too.  </s>
<s> This is too limited.  </s>
<s> It doesn't say how to deal with cases where a column contains both column and row headers.  </s>
<s> The scope proposal is more flexible in this respect and simple to support with the current desktop word processing software table editing paradigm.  </s>
<s> The tables that fit Scott's suggestion can in fact be handled without any additional markup, using the following algorithm from section 12.3 of the 4.0 draft spec, see: In the absence of the axes attribute, user agents may search for pertinent headers according to the following algorithm.  </s>
<s> The goal of the algorithm is to find an ordered list of headers.  </s>
<s> (In the following description of the algorithm the table directionality is assumed to be left-to-right.) First, search left from the cell's position to find row header cells.  </s>
<s> Then search upwards to find column header cells.  </s>
<s> The search in a given direction stops when the edge of the table is reached or when a data cell is found after a header cell.  </s>
<s> * Row headers are inserted into the list in the order they appear in the table, e.g., the leftmost headers are inserted before the header to their right.  </s>
<s> * Column headers are inserted after row headers, in the order they appear in the table.  </s>
<s> The topmost header is inserted before the header below it.  </s>
<s> * If a header cell has an axes attribute, then the headers referenced by this attribute are inserted into the list and the search stopped in the current direction.  </s>
<s> * TD cells with axis attributes are treated as acting as header cells.  </s>

<s> to follow up on what Dave Raggett said:  </s>
<s> I agree.  </s>
<s> I think that your "scope" proposal, give or take minor munges, should go forward in our package of proposals.  </s>
