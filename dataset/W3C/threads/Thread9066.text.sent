The XML Signature XPath Filer2 spec[1] is in Last Call, however, since we're tweaking/improving something that already exists, and the tweaking we did was fully informed by implementation, I'm not expecting any comments, and if I get two more interop reports, I might even "skip" Candidate REC. 
Presently [2], we have reports from Christian and Merlin, any others?

IETF/W3C XML-Signature Co-Chair http://www.w3.org/Signature/ W3C XML Encryption Chair http://www.w3.org/Encryption/2001/ Joseph, I hope that I can provide such a report by early next week. 
Sufficient?
