In my view the guidelines may be improved in everthing related to style sheets. 
I listed down a few tips for style sheets and some examples. 
Wording needs more work. 
I think it is better not to have bad examples in the guidelines, but I included them here for comparison. 
Stylesheet tips: Consistent style throughout the site increases usability, easier to maintain, and faster download for the users: * use a centralized stylesheet for the whole website. 
use linked stylesheets. 
* Avoid inline style. 
To assure good rendering when your site is read without your stylesheets: * Use DIV and SPAN *only after* you run out of HTML meaning- carrying elements. 
If you want to strongly emphasize text use the STRONG element and assign styles to it, rather than using SPAN. 
Make it possible to use the same classes in stylesheets designed for different media: * Define class and id to mark *content related concepts* that are not covered by HTML elements. 
Define classes site-wide and not in each page. 
Do not define classes by the typographical features of a particular medium. 
bad class choices: redline newbullet dropcap good class choices: new warning summary chapter toc HTML and Stylesheets examples: Bad Example: .newtxt 
{ font-weight: bold; color: red; background-color: yellow } .newbullet 
{ list-style : url(yellow.gif) 
} End bad example. 
Good Example: STRONG {font-weight: bold;} UL LI.new {list-style : url(yellow.gif);} 
UL LI.new STRONG {color: red; background-color: yellow;} End good example. 
Bad example: P This is an IMG src="BigRedExample.gif" 
alt="example" of what we mean. 
/P End of bad example. 
Good example: STRONG IMG {font-weight: bold; font-size: bigger; font-color: red;} P This is an STRONG IMG src="BigRedExample.gif" 
alt="example" /STRONG of what we mean. 
/P End of good example. 
Some browsers may apply style rules to alt text. 
e.g., Lynx would show the alt text "example" strongly emphasized. 
Opera3.5 even applies the style sheet to the alt text. 
Bad example: .dropcap 
{ font-size : 120%; font-family : Helvetica } P SPAN class="dropcap" O /SPAN nce upon a time... Good example: .story 
P:first-letter { font-size: 120%; font-family : Helvetica } P Once upon a time... Bad example (IMG has no alt among other things): End bad example. 
Another bad example: HR.redline { color : red } End bad example. 
Good example: DIV.chapter {border-bottom: thin solid red;} DIV#chapter-7:after {content: "End of Chapter 7 - Visual Displays"} DIV#chapter-8:after {content: "End of Chapter 8 - Auditory and Tactile Displays"} End good example. 
Nir Dagan, Ph.D. "There is nothing quite so practical as a good theory." -- A. Einstein I agreed with most of what you say, but I wonder if this is bound to Universal Design/Accessibility, or just to CSS good design guidelines, which is related, I understand, but is getting a little far fetched in terms of what we're asking author to do. 
Better wording: "Instead of using DIV and SPAN elements to add style, try subclassing existing HTML elements though the CLASS attribute. 
For example, if you want to stronly emphasize a text, use the EM element with CLASS set to (say) "extra" instead of using SPAN." 
I'm unhappy with both of these formulations, sorry. 
They're expressed negatively, and it's better to start with a positive statement of what is being aimed at, IMHO. 
I'd want something like (but it still needs work): "Give priority to expressing the structure of your content by means of an appropriate HTML tag. 
Enhance these, where appropriate, with a CLASS attribute and stylesheet suggestion(s). 
Only resort to DIV or SPAN when HTML has no more-appropriate tag." (and then your example, by all means). 
hope that was useful OK.
