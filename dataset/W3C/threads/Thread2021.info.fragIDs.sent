<s> Well, I get this position from page 73, "If no variants remain with a value of Q greater than 0 the server should respond with a 406 None Acceptable." Additionally to support my interpretation there are references to empty Accept-Charset and Accept-Encoding headers allowing user agents to refuse resources (no mention of a multiple-variant requirement), so there is some implication that those headers must be looked at even for non-varying resources.  </s>
<s> But given that Content Negotiation is labeled an optional feature, that some of the statements int the spec could be interepreted the way you did, and that some people may not feel negotiation applies to non-varying resources, I realize the intention of the spec might not be as I had perceived.  </s>

<s> But since this is optional, the client must be prepared to receive junk anyway.  </s>
<s> Assuming this is the interpretation or clarification, Jeff's original comment basically still holds as the proxy would know that the origin had only one choice and it wasn't acceptable.  </s>
