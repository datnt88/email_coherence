<s> Please review and comment on the charter to the group.  </s>
<s> There will be some time for discussion of the charter at the next telecon wednesday.  </s>
<s> Two goals in the draft that are important: Publication of second working draft in september Publication of recommendation in December/January Charter process: Currently the WG (you) and the WAI staff are reviewing the charter and will probably make some changes.  </s>
<s> The charter will then be send to the W3C director for possible revisions and approval.  </s>

<s> Some comments:  </s>

<s> 2.2 Criteria for success Criteria for success of user agent WG include: Adoption of guidelines by user agent developers Inproved [sic] access to the WWW by persons with disabilities  </s>
<s> How do we measure success?  </s>
<s> Items 2 "improved access to the WWW by PWD" is really vague and unmeasurable.  </s>
<s> Also:  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> 13.0 Level of involvement of Team 5% Ian Jacobs 5% Daniel Dardailler 5% Judy Brewer In my opinion, 5% of someone's time is unrealistic for meaningful input.  </s>
<s> If meaningful input is not expected, then change to reflect that.  </s>
<s> Charles Oppermann  </s>
<s> Program Manager, Active Accessibility, Microsoft Corporation "A computer on every desk and in every home, usable by everyone!"  </s>
<s> I agree that measuring "improved access" is vague.  </s>
<s> The charter also says  </s>
<s> that we will "Evaluate the usability of accessibility features" under 2.1  </s>
<s> scope of work items.  </s>
<s> What if instead we say something like, "Establish a mechanism for having users with disabilities test the usability of user agent features."  </s>
<s> I think it would be important to get feedback formally or informally from users who are not directly connected with the WAI activities.  </s>
<s> And then, under "Criteria for success of user agent WG include:" say something like,  </s>
<s> -Adoption of guidelines by user agent developers -Documented use of user agent accessibility features by persons with disabilities with or without assistive technology.  </s>
<s> Actually I don't know if documenting feature use is beyond our scope, but it seems like it would be important to determine whether or not certain features were being used successfully.  </s>
<s> Kitch  </s>
<s> Charles::  </s>
<s> There are some techniques people have used to measure this.  </s>
<s> At the Federal WWW Consortium Seminar on Universal Access last Tuesday, Educational Testing Service (the people who brought you the SAT) briefed what they have done as a part of quality improvement project for the accessibility of their web publishing.  </s>
<s> They have an approach to consolidating user evaluations that seems to make some sense.  </s>
<s> There is also some work out of Cork, I hear.  </s>
<s> I suppose the questions are: Do we want to listen to actual users?  </s>
<s> If so, how?  </s>
<s> Kitch::  </s>
<s> This is one area where it will be good to coordinate with the  </s>
<s> Evaluation and Repair Interest Group.  </s>
<s> The WAI may or may not be organizing user testing, but somebody is going to be doing it somewhere, and we probably want to make it part of our plan to find out what they are learning and use that knowledge here.  </s>
<s> Al  </s>
<s> Kitch::  </s>
<s> What is to be tested?  </s>
<s> Existing browsers, mockups, paper walkthroughs?  </s>
<s> Who will run these tests?  </s>
<s> It should be expected that the browser developer perform usability testing of their own product (we do, I am sure the others do too), which is inclusive of the intended user population.  </s>
<s> When we hit design issues we can't resolve ourselves, we turn to outside research.  </s>
<s> If we can help explore an issue through quick changes in our code, we are more than happy to do so.  </s>
<s> Al::  </s>
<s> The WAI setting up usability testing is not the answer.  </s>
<s> Facilitating the exchange of information between the groups doing this work is a better use of resources.  </s>
<s> Perhaps we can say in 2.1: "Identify and develop resources to support the implementation of the user agent guidelines by developers.  </s>
<s> This includes industry, governmental, and university groups who will participate in the exchange of information and research findings relevant to guideline implementation."  </s>
<s> If we need to include "evaluation" in 2.1, perhaps it should be based on 6.2, where it says the guidelines are: "... consensus-based, technically sound, and reflect the most current technology."  </s>
<s> This implies some analysis/evaluation led to the adoption of given guideline.  </s>
<s> Where we don't have any findings (or where they are unclear) it would be of value to have a "hit list" of design issues in need of research, which are not presently addressed by any group.  </s>
<s> Mark  </s>
