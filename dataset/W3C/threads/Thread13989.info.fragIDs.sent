I have just visited the GL page, following the recent announcement of the updated guidelines, and noticed the following: 1. 
The GL home page has not been updated to provide links to the January 98 version of the various documents. 
This should be done so that a member of the public who visits the GL page will be able to read the latest drafts. 
In this respect it is noteworthy that the WAI home page, which is publicly accessible, provides a link to the GL work area. 
2. The January 98 documents still claim to be version 8 of the Trace Centre guidelines. 
As Daniel pointed out late last year, the introductory paragraphs should be changed to reflect the status of the documents as WAI working drafts. 
In the acknowledgments, it should, however, be clearly stated that this document is based on the Trace Centre's unified accessibility guidelines, in order that the invaluable and continuing contribution of the Trace Centre to their development be fully recognised. 
As far as version is concerned, I think we need to target a version 1.0 for the Recommendation itself. 
Working Draft are usually referenced by their release date, the version doesn't change. 
For the version released today, the ID should be WD-WAI-PAG-980123 For the upcoming Public Working Draft, I suggest a full title and an ID as follow (supposing it's released on Jan 31st). 
WD-WAI-PAG-980131 Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) Page Author Guidelines - version 1.0 W3C Working Draft 31-Jan-1998 It should eventually resides in and later on in: and (Same thing with WAI-PACL for the check list) 
I'm not sure why these guidelines are called "Page Author" guidelines instead of "HTML Author" guidelines. 
While some of the guidelines might be useful for XML or other languages, most are specific to HTML and the term "page" doesn't capture that sufficiently. 
For that reason, during my edits, I changed the title to "HTML Author Guidelines".

HTML was not deemed ideal because it's also about CSS, XML as you say, but overall, maybe we better call a cat a cat (is that an english proverb as well ?) and I agree we can use the name HTML which has a better marketing appeal. 
HTML Authoring Guidelines sounds better, so that it's not confused with guidelines for HTML designers (that is, the HTML WG). 
Too far-fetched maybe ?
