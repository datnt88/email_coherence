Hello, 
Today, I created a forum at Deja News where we can discuss things online. 
It's our own forum and is called: dejanews.members.career.rbutters.access-disabilities 
and I described it like this: 
To identify, access and report resources needed and found valuable by individuals in the higher education community with disabilities. 
Forum seeks to place emphasis on interaction with students, professors, administrators and specialists and resources not found elsewhere. 
Major questions guiding discussions are: What references have participants found to be valuable that can be shared with others? 
Relative to the expressed current informational needs of participants, where can relevant resources be found? 
Identification and disclosure of immediate concerns and helpful Internet resources are the highest priorities. 
If you are already registered for My Deja News, go here to join our new forum Or, if you haven't registered for My Deja News, go here Now, here's some stuff Deja News wants to tell you to help you out. 
By joining Robert's new discussion forum you will automatically get a Free My Deja News account. 
This means you will also be able to read and participate in more than 50,000 other high quality discussions on almost every conceivable topic, from sports to parenting to java development. 
We will also give you a free email account you can use to participate in any discussion on the Internet without worrying about people sending spam email to your permanent account. 
You can even create your own free discussion forum.

I tried this and I had some problems registering using Lynx. 
The form says that required fields are in "red", but I don't see any red text on my screen. 
For some reason I can't specify anything for my occupation or industry. 
Once I completed the entire form (since I had no way to know what was required or not), I submitted it, but DejaNews refused to accept my registration information, and kept bouncing me back to the same form I'd just completed. 
So I'm afraid I can't be joining you on the disability access discussion group, since it seems to be inaccessible to lynx users.
