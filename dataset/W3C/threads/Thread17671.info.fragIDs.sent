<s> Hello, I received an action item at the 28 July teleconf [1] to propose a checkpoint that would merge checkpoints 9.16, 9.17, and 9.18 as defined in the 16 July draft [2].  </s>
<s> In that draft, they read: - Make available whether a chosen link (target) has already been visited - Make available whether a chosen link (target) is local to the document.  </s>
<s> - Make available whether following a link will involve a fee.  </s>
<s> In light of decisions at the 4 August teleconf [3], I propose the following checkpoints: 1) Make available information about a link that will enable the user to decide whether to follow the link.  </s>
<s> [Priority 3] NOTE: Useful information includes: whether the link has already  </s>
<s> been visited, whether it leads to a different document, and  </s>
<s> what is the expected natural language of the link target.  </s>
<s> 2) Allow the user to know whether following a link will involve a fee.  </s>
<s> [Priority 2].  </s>
<s> NOTE: This information may be provided through the standard user interface provided the interface is accessible.  </s>
<s> Thus, any prompt asking the user to confirm payment must be accessible.  </s>
<s> For checkpoint 2, please note that this was agreed upon at the 4 August teleconference.  </s>

<s> Hello, The proposal below addresses link-related checkpoints in guideline 9 (Orientation).  </s>
<s> However, in [2], there are link-related checkpoints related to graphical rendering of link information: 7.12 Provide a mechanism (e.g., through style sheets) to distinguish visited links from unvisited links.  </s>
<s> [Priority 3] Note.  </s>
<s> Using color as the only distinguishing factor does not suffice since color may not be perceivable by all users or rendered by all devices.  </s>
<s> 7.13 Allow the user to specify (e.g., through style sheets) that images used in links must have borders.  </s>
<s> [Priority 3] Should these checkpoints be folded into the ones proposed below, or do they merit a separate existence?  </s>
<s> As written, 7.12 would fit into the first checkpoint proposed below.  </s>
<s> However, 7.13 says "Use a visual highlighting mechanism to tell people this image is a link."  </s>
<s> Checkpoint 7.13 doesn't quite fall under 1.2: "Ensure that the user can interact with all active elements of a document in a device-independent manner."  </s>
<s> since it suggests (to me) activation, not recognition of a link.  </s>
<s> I propose that we modify 7.13 and move it to guideline 6 (user control of styles) or guideline 9 (orientation, where similar checkpoints reside): Provide a mechanism for highlighting and identifying (through a standard interface where available) active elements of a document.  </s>
<s> For example, allow the user to specify that images in links be rendered with borders.  </s>

<s> Responses in JRG:  </s>
<s> JRG: 7.12 seems to be dealing with the same issue as the new checkpoint proposed for determining whether a link should be followed or not.  </s>
<s> SO I think they should be combined.  </s>
<s> JRG: I like the change, since it is device dependent.  </s>
<s> This could even relate to auditory interfaces saying "link" before saying the link text.  </s>
<s> I think wherevere possible we should minimize the use of visual references.  </s>
