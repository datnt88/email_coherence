<s> Section 3.2.2  </s>
<s> I'm of two minds about supporting other non-ASCII character sets.  </s>
<s> On the one hand, lots of people are doing this already, and you can't very well expect them to stop.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, formalizing this will impede the goal of getting to internationalization of the WWW, where any client can talk to any server.  </s>
<s> You would get into the situation where clients and servers spoke different character sets, just like now (although you'd know it up front, rather than finding out when garbage showed up on your screen).  </s>
<s> Unless non-Latin-based languages are treated as equal to Latin-based languages, WWW should be renamed.  </s>
<s> I think the Accept-charset would address this well: also, it suggests an architecture/protocol, and so is inherently enabling rather than fettering.  </s>
<s> I suppose that if the number of supported character sets was limited (unlikely), clients could support them all, translating through Unicode.  </s>
<s> This doesn't seem like it's a probably outcome.  </s>
<s> I think Gavin's solution comes down to that every WWW server should be able to negotiate and supply: * some ISO 646 based lowest-common-denominator encoding, e.g. ISO 8859-1; * some ISO 10646 encoding for rest-of-world documents; and * the local national character set (in English-speaking countries, this is not needed).  </s>
<s> The first allows good support of English readers, and majority-white countries and their ex-colonies well.  </s>
<s> (I mention "white" not to impute racism or at least parochialism, but to emphasise that for WWW to be able reach a browsership in non-Western countries other than the technical and educated classes, the small Latin-based character sets are of no use.)  </s>
<s> The second allows support of international access of documents.  </s>
<s> The third allows national support of local languages.  </s>
<s> This feature is probably necessary to support existing practice, but I worry it will lead to "Balkanization" of the WWW, namely clients and servers that don't speak to each other.  </s>
<s> Local/regional character sets and encodings won't go away in the forseeable future.  </s>
<s> WWW should have a "lingua franca" character set, and that character set shouldn't be a national or regional character set: ISO 10646/Unicode is the only choice.  </s>
<s> Such a three character set approach (LCD, internationals, national/regional) is also fairly efficient: it means that clients and servers can negotiate the character set for the least amount of character mapping.  </s>
<s> Gavin goes further and specifies particular encodings of ISO 10646 that every server should support: I think that naturally follows.  </s>
<s> Of course, even with Unicode, if your server is serving up Thai, and I don't have any Thai fonts, I'm out of luck.  </s>
<s> It would be nice, though, if that didn't happen just because you and I use different character sets.  </s>
<s> Perhaps a smart server could serve the fonts too: it could have "Accept-charset" for the character sets and encodings it will handle, and "Display-charset" for the character sets it can display.  </s>
<s> The smart server would figure out what is needed.  </s>
<s> Alternatively, it could be done on an exception basis: if a client can't display a character, it sends a request somewhere to a font-server (back to the WWW server?): this may be slow, but this is handling exceptions not normal operation.  </s>
<s> As a side comment, I'd mention that the Extended Reference Concrete Syntax (ERCS) proposals I am involved in developing have as an aim to allow SGML tagging using native-language tag names (GIs), if the name characters also appear in Unicode.  </s>
<s> This is in part to allow structure-based searching of documents by non-English speakers using meaningful (to them) tag names.  </s>
<s> At the moment, it is a reasonable assumption that SGML markup will only use ISO 646 characters: the ERCS would hopefully change that, as far as SGML documents go.  </s>
<s> If some version of HTML allows arbitrary tag names, I hope that there are no ISO 646 dependencies.  </s>
<s> -ricko  </s>
<s> Sorry to take so long to reply to Gavin Nicol's proposal; first there were the holidays, then things got busy at work.  </s>
<s> In general, I think the document does a good job of discussing the issues, and I agree (not surprisingly) with the idea of using Unicode for this purpose.  </s>
<s> I do have some specific comments on aspects of the document.  </s>
<s> Section 3.2.1  </s>
<s> There is no character set "UNICODE-1-1-UCS-2"; the UCS-2 form is identified by "UNICODE-1-1" (cf.  </s>
<s> RFC 1641).  </s>
<s> There is also no "UNICODE-1-1-UTF-8", but I am in the process of getting it registered right now.  </s>
<s> I don't particularly consider UTF-7 a good candidate for WWW work, since HTTP is an 8-bit-clean protocol, but if someone had another context in mind where a 7-bit safe form was needed, I'd like to know about it.  </s>
<s> Similarly, later in the section it says that "[UTF-7] is perfect for WWW and MIME uses".  </s>
<s> The same comment applies.  </s>
<s> It says at the end of 3.2.1 that the costs of translating documents to Unicode might appear prohibitive, but that caches would solve the problem.  </s>
<s> I guess I don't understand why transcoding a typical HTML document using a table would be expensive.  </s>
<s> I would expect it to be much cheaper than the time needed to push the document out over the wire.  </s>
<s> Why would this be prohibitively expensive?  </s>
<s> Section 3.2.2  </s>
<s> I'm of two minds about supporting other non-ASCII character sets.  </s>
<s> On the one hand, lots of people are doing this already, and you can't very well expect them to stop.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, formalizing this will impede the goal of getting to internationalization of the WWW, where any client can talk to any server.  </s>
<s> You would get into the situation where clients and servers spoke different character sets, just like now (although you'd know it up front, rather than finding out when garbage showed up on your screen).  </s>
<s> I suppose that if the number of supported character sets was limited (unlikely), clients could support them all, translating through Unicode.  </s>

<s> Of course, even with Unicode, if your server is serving up Thai, and I don't have any Thai fonts, I'm out of luck.  </s>
<s> It would be nice, though, if that didn't happen just because you and I use different character sets.  </s>
<s> Section 3.2.4  </s>
<s> This is probably the section I have the most problem with.  </s>
<s> Unicode specifically was designed with the idea that attributes such as language, fonts, etc. would be encoded out-of-band, via high level tags or even out  </s>
<s> of the character stream entirely (see section 2 of the Unicode Standard, volume 1).  </s>
<s> In particular, the private use area is specifically reserved for use by corporations and end users, by private agreement, and trying to assign a code in the private use area for general public use is contrary to the spirit and probably the letter of the standard.  </s>
<s> I know that there has been considerable resistance to other attempts to include formatting codes in the standard, so I don't think this is the right approach.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, using embedded escape sequences (like HTML) is perfectly all right, and in fact on page 15 of volume 1 there is an example of this kind.  </s>
<s> The only difference in this example is that a character code is not assigned as an escape sequence.  </s>
<s> Although the proposal could be amended to be compatible by using existing character codes, I think this would duplicate work being done for HTML, so I think this problem should be dealt with at a higher level.  </s>
<s> Furthermore, I don't think it needs to be dealt with before Unicode can start being used for WWW purposes.  </s>
<s> The only time such a tag will be used is (for example) if a client could display both Japanese and Chinese; the tag would then help specify which one to choose.  </s>
<s> For the vast majority of monolingual clients, you'll use whatever font is available, so the tag would be ignored.  </s>
<s> Plain Unicode is more than capable of basic legibility when displaying text, without additional language or font tags (again, see the design principles in section 2 of the standard).  </s>
<s> Such display may not be typographically ideal, but then HTML is nowhere near rich enough for advanced typography anyway (right now, anyway).  </s>
<s> For now, then I propose that this issue be deferred.  </s>
<s> High-level tags are the right way to deal with it, because like other font, size, style, etc. information, it's not critical to the basic legibility of the information.  </s>
<s> If HTML 3.0 has a language tag, all the more reason not to invent another mechanism.  </s>
<s> It certainly doesn't belong at the level of character codes.  </s>
<s> Section 5.1 I'm pleased to hear that the issue on not requiring stict MIME line break rules has been dealt with.  </s>
<s> It would be nice if there were a reference of some sort here so that people could see the decision in writing (assuming it's written down somewhere).  </s>
<s> Section 6 It's worth adding the URL for the Unicode WWW page, http://unicode.org/, in addition to the ISBN numbers for the two books.  </s>

<s> This is certainly possible, and after a certain amount of time, good caching clients will build up a "working set" of glyphs.  </s>
<s> In the Plan 9 documentation, they mention that this working set is generally not large.  </s>
<s> Of course, once free Unicode fonts become available, this will not be needed (except in cases where we specifically want to use different glyph images).  </s>
<s> [ Apologies if this is seen more than once.  </s>
<s> ]  </s>
<s> This has already happened to a degree: information from Japan seldom leaks out in anything other than English, and that is but the tip of a growing iceburg.  </s>
<s> Unicode provides a good common ground.  </s>
<s> Yes, and I am very hesitant to suggest using any special purpose codes.  </s>
<s> The problem is that there does need to be some standard (low level) way of saying that some text is in Japanese, and some text is in Chinese.  </s>
<s> Now, the real debate is how to represent this, and I think the recent idea I proposed is not bad.  </s>
<s> We *could* say that these codes are simply an artifact of the encoding (ie.  </s>
<s> this is UCS-2-HINTED encoding), and say that they *should* be removed from the data stream once it's received... or we can say they are STAGO and STAGC for a high-level tag.  </s>
<s> Do you have any complaints about including hints in a transfer encoding?  </s>
<s> This is really the crux of the matter.  </s>
<s> Why do you think there needs to be a *low level* way of differentiating Japanese and Chinese text?  </s>
<s> The WWW seems to operate quite well now without any way to differentiate German, English, French, or Italian text (all handled by 8859-1).  </s>
<s> What problems -- specifically -- would arise in typical WWW applications if such text is not tagged?  </s>
<s> How would lack of this information impede you when writing Unicode-capable servers and clients, and how would it impact end users?  </s>
<s> I fully agree that language (and font, and style, and ...) tags are useful and highly desirable at a high level, and support for this should be added to HTML (or at whatever level is appropriate).  </s>
<s> I don't think that language is any different from these other attributes, nor does it need special treatment.  </s>
<s> Doing it at a low level adds complexity and complicates clients and servers that use Unicode.  </s>
<s> There has to be a compelling reason to add this complexity.  </s>
<s> There has to be a problem that it solves.  </s>
<s> Given that work is in progress to add language information at a higher level (HTML 3) it seems to me that there would have to be an extraordinarily strong reason to add this information at a low level as well.  </s>
