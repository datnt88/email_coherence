Could this be more general? 
E.g. provide shortcut links for bypassing groups of related information or jumping directly to certain information.

This gets to the difference between things which are required for improving accessibility and the things which improve useability (there is, of course, a substantial cross-over). 
The general useability is part of good hypertext authoring. 
The specific jump for groups of links is related to problems experienced by users of screen readers, which is definitley within our scope. 
I am not sure that the broad solution is within the scope of this activity. 
Does someone have a good answer to that question?

Yes, the highest and best practice is more general. 
Yes, we want to make special mention of navigation link-clusters as obstacles (tank traps). 
My hunch is that we shold develop a few good references that this paragraph should lead to and leave it pretty much at that. 
One reference is to the discussion of structural navigation in the UA guidelines. 
The point is that for web pages of a sufficient complexity it makes sense to institutionalize this with internal links as well as having the User Agent able to walk the structure tree. 
Another reference is to the "table of navigation" requirements in the DAISY/NISO Digital Talking Book document model That gives an idea of what targets should be navigable. 
One or more other references would be to HTML design courseware on the Web that treats this well. 
Kynn Bartlett and Tom McCain could maybe help with suggestions for the latter.
