<s> This gets to the difference between things which are required for improving accessibility and the things which improve useability (there is, of course, a substantial cross-over).  </s>
<s> The general useability is part of good hypertext authoring.  </s>
<s> The specific jump for groups of links is related to problems experienced by users of screen readers, which is definitley within our scope.  </s>

<s> Does someone have a good answer to that question?  </s>

<s> Yes, the highest and best practice is more general.  </s>
<s> Yes, we want to make special mention of navigation link-clusters as obstacles (tank traps).  </s>
<s> My hunch is that we shold develop a few good references that this paragraph should lead to and leave it pretty much at that.  </s>
<s> One reference is to the discussion of structural navigation in the UA guidelines.  </s>
<s> The point is that for web pages of a sufficient complexity it makes sense to institutionalize this with internal links as well as having the User Agent able to walk the structure tree.  </s>
<s> Another reference is to the "table of navigation" requirements in the DAISY/NISO Digital Talking Book document model That gives an idea of what targets should be navigable.  </s>
<s> One or more other references would be to HTML design courseware on the Web that treats this well.  </s>
<s> Kynn Bartlett and Tom McCain could maybe help with suggestions for the latter.  </s>
