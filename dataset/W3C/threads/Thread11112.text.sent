I mentioned this in my laundry list, but CMSMcQ thought it worth bringing up separately. 
Clause 4.6: I *strongly* feel that MIME types should be allowed for notation system IDs. 
Unless someone can send me a URL for a GIF processor that will work immediately on any OS. Change %ExternalID in production [73] to %NotExtId, which in turn is: [73a] NotExtId :: = 'SYSTEM' S (MimeType | SystemLiteral) In more detail, I've always thought that the identifiers for notations were a little weird. 
In a fixed environment, it's fine to put, say, "xv" as the system identifier for GIF. 
But in a language defined primarily to enable Internet transfer, this makes NO sense. 
URLs are great because they work (or don't) everywhere on the 'net. 
But URLs for notations point to - what? 
A specification of the notation? 
That's useful, and good luck finding a URL describing the binary structure of proprietary formats. 
A MIME type, registered or unregistered, seems much more appropriate for Internet use for notations. 
What do other folks think?

There is a problem of notations that are not registered Mime-types, but they are not likely to interoperate well, anyway. 
Maybe we could _allow_ URLs instead of Mime-types (the : after the scheme name would disambiguate, no?) -- If and _only if_ there is no Mime-type available for a data format. 
Insofar as the notation labelling problem has been solved _anywhere_ Mime types are the solution. 
I will be _very_ surprised if anyone can find an argument _for_ URLs referencing some unknown resource, rather than a Mime-type -- especially when we are explicitly targeting the Web and HTTP. 
-- David Note: now that we have PUBLIC, we could state that PULBIC IDs for notations are Mime types and leave the SYSTEM ID as the one that is not well-defined as to semantics.... Seems an ironic reversal of the other case, but this is a place where the Naming probelm is better solved than the resolution problem.

I have found MIME types an extremely valuable tool for building my XML system with as it is often otherwise impossible to identify the type of a document (e.g. the target of a link). 
(I take it that XML systems are allowed to point to non-XML targets so long as they are of know NOTATION?) P. Peter Murray-Rust, domestic net connection Virtual School of Molecular Sciences I'd rather leave PUBLIC for the formal name of the notation, as defined in ISO 9573-9, and rely on the associated SYSTEM id to identify the MIME type.
