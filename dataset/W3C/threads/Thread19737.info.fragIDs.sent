<s> Thank you very much, I downloaded tar.zip and ran 'tar -xf' on the file previously 'gzip -d' and it built a directory structure of sorts.  </s>
<s> Now for the next questions.  </s>
<s> (I need to take this one step at a time in order to understand what is going on).  </s>
<s> During the tar process there were a myriad of 'cannot create' errors.  </s>
<s> The resulting amaya directory has the following .h  </s>
<s> files:  </s>
<s> AHTERROR.H HTMLSTYLE.H AMAYA.H AMAYAMSG.H CSS.H JAVAAMAY.H LIBWWW.H LIBJAVA.H TRANS.H and the following .c  </s>
<s> files AHTBRIDG.C AHTFWRIT.C AHTMEMCO.C AHTTOURL.C EDITORAC.C EDITIMAG.C EDITSTYL.C HTMLACTI.C HTMLBOOK.C HTMLEDIT.C HTMLFORM.C HTMLLIST.C HTMLIMAG.C HTMLPRES.C HTMLSAVE.C HTMLSTYL.C HTMLTABL.C MATHEDIT.C UICSS.C ANSWER.C CSS.C JAVAAMAY.C HTML2THO.C INIT.C P2CSS.C QUERY.C TRANS.C TRANSPAR.C  </s>
<s> 1. Is this all of the .h and .c  </s>
<s> files for amaya?  </s>
<s> 2. If there were any long file names they were lost in the tar process, is there a different procedure that would conserve them.  </s>
<s> 3. In compiling, should there be a particular directory created for the source or is it sufficient that all these .c,  </s>
<s> .h  </s>
<s> be in the same directory.  </s>

<s> Again, you should consider getting WinZip from Niko Mak at www.winzip.com.  </s>
<s> It understands tar and gzip formats as well as PKZIP and preserves long filenames and directories correctly.  </s>
