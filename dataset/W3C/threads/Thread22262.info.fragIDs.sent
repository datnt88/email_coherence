<s> Bringing the source document into compliance MIGHT eliminate the case case normalization, but might not.  </s>
<s> The HTML DOM document does not hint at any particular normalization of color values.  </s>
<s> For example, it does not say that if bkcolor="aqua" appears in the source document, whether it is appropriate to return "#00FFFF".  </s>
<s> The previous HTML link mentions that the color values are case-insensitive.  </s>
<s> I would recommend: a) changing tablecell.html  </s>
<s> and tablecell.xml  </s>
<s> to add missing hash on color codes.  </s>
<s> b) changing ignoreCase to true (not auto) c) Running parallel cases where red and aqua are used instead of their hex equivalents and see if you get hex or color names back.  </s>
<s> d) Maybe some statement in the spec about the acceptable normalization of color values.  </s>
<s> Continuing a thread started in  </s>
<s> This is similar to the color tests described earlier in the day.  </s>
<s> There is no specific instruction in addresses the allowable changes to the case of attribute values (though element and attribute tag names are explicitly addressed).  </s>
<s> I think it would be good to extend a case-insensitive comparision cause to include any attribute value designated as case-insensitive in the HTML recommendation.  </s>
<s> Otherwise, we are just bending the tests to meet the deployed implementations.  </s>
