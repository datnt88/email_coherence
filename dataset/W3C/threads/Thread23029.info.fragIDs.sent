<s> Multiple layers is not part of DOM.  </s>
<s> Netscape 6 supports DOM.  </s>

<s> As Ray says, "layers" aren't standardized by the DOM spec.  </s>
<s> You might want to read through the DOM Level 2 Recommendation to get an idea of what it actually does cover, or find a good DOM tutorial in lieu thereof.  </s>
<s> I believe most modern browsers support the DOM APIs.  </s>
<s> There is a partial list at http://dmoz.org/Computers/Programming/Internet/W3C_DOM/, but your best bet for a complete answer would be to contact the folks actually supporting each browser and ask them which level of the DOM they support and what limitations (if any) exist in their implementation.  </s>
