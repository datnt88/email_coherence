amaya 1.0b (Linux-elf) consistently segfaults on several jpeg images if the pages are loaded from a server. 
Everything works fine if I load the same page with the same images as a file. 
Another situation where it crashes is on clicking the reload button to reload a page from a server. 
Sometimes it works, sometimes it says (64) NETREAD: Broken pipe if I try to reload a file from the server and dies with a broken pipe if I click reload again. 
And: a construction like TR TD A HREF="braun/index.html" IMG SRC="img/braun.jpg" width=100 height=100 /A TD some text is only displayed correctly if the optional closing /TD tags after the images are present, otherwise the text is printed somewhere in the image. 
If at least one of the /TD tags is present, the table rows are displayed correctly, but the vertical spaces are too big.

I found out something new: This only happens if amaya and the apache-server run on the same computer (in my case a Pentium 90). 
It seems as if amaya can't handle fast responses from the server while decompressing jpg or gif images. 
I installed an apache on my laptop with a 386SL which is connected via a PLIP-line, and now the identical files are displayed and reloaded just fine.

Ok, I had the same problem at home ... A RedHat linux box with apache installed by default ... Could you tell me wether the same problem occurs with the amaya-java version (I guess you're using the libWWW based one). 
At least at home, using the java version (it uses Jigsaw Java classes for network accesses) works fine now, Daniel Daniel Veillard@w3.org | W3C / INRIA Rhone-Alpes | Today's Bookmarks : Daniel.Veillard@inrialpes.fr| 655 av de l'Europe | Linux, WWW, Java, Tel : +33 (0)4 76 61 53 85 | 38330 Montbonnot | badminton, Kaffe, Home: +33 (0)4 76 63 05 86 | http://opera.inrialpes.fr/veillard
