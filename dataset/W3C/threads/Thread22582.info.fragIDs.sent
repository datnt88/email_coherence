<s> hi, can anybody let me know,how do i retrieve the value of the xslt style sheet type and href ,which is along with the xml file using dom.  </s>
<s> there is a createProsessingInstruction() returning a processionInstuction referance,but there is no getProcessingInstruction() in the Document interface eg: ?xml  </s>
<s> version=\"1.0\"?  </s>
<s> "); ?xml-stylesheet  </s>
<s> type=\"text/xsl\" href=\"xslt1.xsl\"?  </s>
<s> ") here i need to get the type and href for the xslt.  </s>
<s> Thanks in advance Sridhar  </s>
<s> Here are two Java methods you can add to your code that will do it.  </s>
<s> * Gets the value of a given processing instruction.  </s>
<s> * @param document the Document to be searched * @param target the name of the processing instruction * @return the value of the processing instruction.  </s>
<s> private static String getProcessingInstructionValue(Document document, String target) { NodeList children = document.getChildNodes();  </s>
<s> int childCount = children.getLength();  </s>
<s> for (int i = 0; i  childCount; i++) { Node node = children.item(i);  </s>
<s> if (node instanceof ProcessingInstruction &amp;&amp; node.getNodeName().equals(target))  </s>
<s> { return node.getNodeValue(); return null; * Gets the value of a given processing instruction attribute.  </s>
<s> * @param document the Document to be searched * @param target the name of the processing instruction * @param attribute the name of the attribute * @return the value of the processing instruction attribute.  </s>
<s> private static String getProcessingInstructionValue(Document document, String target, String attribute) { String value = getProcessingInstructionValue(document, target); if (value != null) { String searchString = attribute + "=\""; int index = value.indexOf(searchString);  </s>
<s> if (index != -1) { value = value.substring(index  </s>
<s> + searchString.length());  </s>
<s> index = value.indexOf('"');  </s>
<s> value = value.substring(0,  </s>
<s> index); return value;  </s>
<s> node instanceof ProcessingInstruction is dangerous here and make expectation on the underlying DOM implementation.  </s>
<s> Nothing prevents a DOM implementation to implement several DOM interfaces in the same class.  </s>
<s> Instead, I would suggest using if (node.getNodeType() == Node.PROCESSING_INSTRUCTION_NODE &amp;&amp; Philippe  </s>
