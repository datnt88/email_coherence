(215} 204-2247 (voice) (800) 750-7428 (TTY) Hey everybody is our phone conf ON right NOW??? 
I just dialed 001 617/252-1038 and hear a beep but then nothing. 
Did I miss the hour, 3 PM EST is 9 PM CET, no?

Yes, it's on, but you phoned in early. 
It's 3PM EST which is 15:00 in 24 hour time, which something like 21:00 (+-1 hour) in western Europe ( I don't know the exact conversion with daylight savings time, etc.) I hope you will still be able to be with us then, since the Altifier is a major topic. 
I apologize for our primitive and confusing American time system :-).

(215} 204-2247 (voice) (800) 750-7428 (TTY) US east is 6 hours behind you, not ahead of you. 
So the call will be 9pm for you. 
to follow up on what Leonard R. Kasday said: People may want to talk about this today, or defer it, but I have a potential application scenario that I have been thinking about and would like others to think about. 
You could call it "distance user testing." 
Toronto has a setup like this now. 
I think we want to think about how our modules could flow into such an environment for industrial-strength evaluation of techniques. 
This is a situation where people with various ability profiles participate in systematic, structured-sample user testing and _they are the only person at their location involved_. 
What does one want in such a workstation? 
Session logging? 
Remote administration? 
Shrink-wrapped Aps and rapid-prototype modifications? 
Anyhow, that's one of my answers for "where do we see this stuff going _next_ if someone codes something and someone else likes it?"
