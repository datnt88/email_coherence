<s> I am simply amazed at how many sites post the bobby approved icon on their site.  </s>
<s> The sites I am seeing are not compliant and never were as they are missing the basic level 1 subjective requirements.  </s>
<s> Even if they were compliant, they are not using a positive quality assurance program!  </s>
<s> While I love the people at CAST and I think Bobby is a useful tool, I am often worried that misuse of Bobby might do more harm than good.  </s>
<s> As an example, my wife recently read over a review of certain governmental web sites (not federal), that reviewed them for various quality metrics.  </s>
<s> According to Liz, the metric used for accessibility was "do they have a TTD phone number listed, OR do they display the Bobby icon?"  </s>
<s> If one or the other was there, the site was rated as "accessible."  </s>
<s> The problem we face is that "Bobby Compliant" may become more important than "accessible."  </s>
<s> (Note that I think there is also a danger with "WCAG Compliant" in the same way, but at the moment that risk is smaller than the Bobby problem.) In other words, people get confused and they think that what they are trying to do is get a Bobby logo for their front page, when really what they -should- do is try to make their web pages more accessible.  </s>
<s> I, personally, never use the Bobby logo on sites I design; both because I think it's too easily mistaken for a real accessibility claim, as described above, and because I find that it is aesthetically unappealing on most web sites.  </s>
<s> (Sorry, CAST folks, but a little cartoon policeman rarely fits in with the visual style I'm shooting for.) Idyll Mountain Internet sites (designed primarily by my wife) typically use either a WCAG logo or a simple text link, such as that on the Virtual Dog Show site.  </s>

<s> Dear Marti et al., I've been as much a critic of Bobby as anyone.  </s>
<s> Still, I would disagree with  </s>
<s> your statement that "passing Bobby does not mean a site is accessible".  </s>
<s> Passing Bobby _IS_ a fair test for accessibility!  </s>
<s> The problem is usually some combination of: (1) Ignoring the manual checks.  </s>
<s> (2) Testing only the homepage and not the site (this is NOT in conformance  </s>
<s> with how CAST says the logo should be used).  </s>
<s> (3) Not re-testing pages when new content is added.  </s>
<s> (4) Using the logo as some sort of award badge -- without deserving it.  </s>
<s> Please note that ALL of the above could happen with the WCAG conformance logos or, the "valid html" buttons, or any "award" type graphic for that matter!  </s>
<s> I don't think it's fair to blame CAST for any of these abuses.  </s>
<s> Seeing a "top 10 web site" graphic doesn't REALLY mean that the site is in the top ten!  </s>
<s> Seeing a "valid html" button doesn't REALLY mean that the site  </s>
<s> uses syntactically correct HTML!  </s>
<s> Presumably, in both cases, one has some way to check on an author's claim.  </s>
<s> This is the case for Bobby as well!  </s>
<s> (Which is why it's a good idea to link the Bobby logo to a live test of the  </s>
<s> page that claims conformance.  </s>
<s> It is too bad that CAST hasn't done much to encouraged this practice.) On the other hand, a Bobby graphic is a good indication that the site owner  </s>
<s> will fix the problem if approached in a business-like fashion.  </s>
<s> My personal  </s>
<s> experience with this has been very positive (although there were a few sites  </s>
<s> who just took down the Bobby logo rather than fix the problems).  </s>
<s> With regard to Kynn's understandable distaste for the cartoon policeman: CAST offers alternatives that are more tame -- and I've posted a few to this  </s>
<s> list that I made up myself that I thought were better (smaller, easier to read, more muted).  </s>
<s> Please CC your thoughts on Bobby to CAST.  </s>
<s> They do listen, even if they don't obey! -- Bruce  </s>
<s> It is my understanding that this is exactly why CAST removed the prominent "Bobby Approved" (with large "thumbs-up" graphic -- and before that the stars) from the report.  </s>
<s> One has to scroll down significantly, past all the manual checks, before reading "This web page does not contain any Priority 1 accessibility errors that Bobby can detect" -- which is in plain body text.  </s>
<s> The first thing in the report reads, "To be Bobby Approved, a page must pass all of the Priority 1 accessibility checkpoints established by the WAI." CAST has sincerely worked hard to promote the manual checks portion.  </s>
<s> Really, what else they could do?  </s>
<s> Oh yeah, I almost forgot.  </s>
<s> They could consolidate about nine-tenths of the manual checks so that people were more inclined to read that section!  </s>
<s> In all fairness, this is much more a user problem than something CAST is doing wrong.  </s>
<s> Hmm - I guess I sounded more derogatory of Bobby than I really meant to be.  </s>
<s> I think it is a very useful tool, the problem I see is not so much with Booby but with the way it is mis-used, mis-understood.  </s>
<s> It seems to me that the manual checks portion is often ignored, or least not taken seriously, leading to sites with the Bobby logo that are not really accessible.  </s>

<s> No, that's not correct.  </s>

<s> Hi - Michael here with the CAST perspective on the "Bobby Compliant" thread.  </s>
<s> I agree completely with the issue raised here - that "Bobby Approved" does not always mean accessible, and many sites incorrectly view it as such.  </s>
<s> Bruce outlined a number of reasons for this, and I'll add that "Bobby Approved" is based on passing the Priority 1 checkpoints.  </s>
<s> Most of us believe that a site that is largely accessible should pass the Priority 2 checkpoints as well.  </s>
<s> Bobby checks for those but it isn't part of getting the icon.  </s>
<s> We are in the process, in fact, of writing a disclaimer about this - "Bobby Approved" does not guarantee accessible.  </s>
<s> In fact, though we think we've done a good job in Bobby, we can't even guarantee that a site has passed the WAI checkpoints Bobby has evaluated, since Bobby is an _interpretation_ of the checkpoints.  </s>
<s> Given the new Section 508 requirements in the U.S., and litigious American culture, CAST more than anyone else does not want people to be confused about these issues.  </s>
<s> I think Bobby is a useful tool to speed along the process of making a site accessible, and that is really how it should be used (and is the way people in this forum use it, I think).  </s>
<s> The "Bobby Approved" stuff really comes out of CAST's educational focus, encouraging users who bring their site to a certain level, stuff like that.  </s>
<s> I think we do need to take under advisement that it isn't being perceived just in that way and figure out a better way to approach that goal.  </s>
<s> By the way, on use of the Bobby Approved icon - I agree with many of you that it isn't very attractive.  </s>
<s> We've had a designer do a new one which we'll  </s>
<s> release shortly as an additional option, but many of us believe it is worse, so don't get your hopes up!  </s>
<s> We're going back to square on on that whole thing, and I think the W3C icons accomplish the goal better for many purposes right now.  </s>
<s> Also, on linking the icon to a dynamic Bobby report to the page in question, I think it's a cool idea, and this context (seeing how the page does _right now_) is another reason to do it.  </s>
<s> The reason we haven't is the Bobby server is running at full capacity and we are afraid of overloading it if we do that.  </s>
<s> We continually improve its capacity and if we get it to a point that we think it can handle the load, we'll offer the feature.  </s>
