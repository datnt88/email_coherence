Hello, with the new Amaya 1.3 binary (amaya-RS6000-1.3.tar.gz) 
I got the following error message after issueing the command "amaya" (under AIX 4.1.4) and additionally the starting page ("AmayaPage.html") 
looks different from that of version 1.2a under AIX or 1.3 under Linux. 
*** Errors in /usr/local/privat/lib/Thot/amaya/AmayaPage.html

Under Amaya 1.2a and AIX 4.1.4 all works as expected. 
Any ideas ?

Sorry, it seems that the AIX version was badly generated. 
I've redone the job and the version is now available form the http server. 
I guess you have to wait a while to download this new version from ftp servers. 
Could you check the date before downloading the version (the right one is July 13 or later). 
Thankx for quick report Irene. 
... great, works now as expected. 
Thanks for your fast response Jens Dr. Jens Schleusener (WT-DV) DLR (German Aerospace Center)
