<s> Dear All, Here is my first go around at shortening the card sort list for the closed card sort to be done at CSUN.  </s>
<s> Please take a look (it's an Excel Spreadsheet) - if you would like a different type of file please tell me.  </s>
<s> If you have questions about the closed card sort please contact me.  </s>
<s> Here's a brief summary of what I've done with this file: - I took out references to version 2.0 for simplicities sake - I took out odd outliers - such as Errata - total of 40 cards removed - I think we can cut more.  </s>
<s> The more we cut the more we can test because time will be shortened per test.  </s>
<s> Here are the group names I suggest for the closed card sort - please give feedback on this as well (from http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/UCD/site-map): 1..  </s>

<s> Carol &amp; WSTF, Looks like a good start to me!  </s>
<s> I'm in favor of cutting down the numbers, perhaps significantly.  </s>
<s> I like your idea of running a pilot to see how long it will take (will be important to be able to tell potential participants, too).  </s>
<s> WSTF: Please send you comments to the list, including suggestions on how to cut down the scope/number of cards/time.  </s>
<s> A few questions: - How do you propose to overcome the problems that folks had last time we tried card sort, for example, people not understanding what the documents are from the title?  </s>
<s> - Have you planned methods to conduct the card sort with participants with various disabilities?  </s>
<s> - Have you thought about recruiting participants at CSUN?  </s>
<s> Charmane: are you interested in conducting card sorts at CSUN?  </s>
<s> Do you want to talk to Carol ahead of time, or at CSUN?  </s>
<s> Blossom, Michael, others: are you interested in conducting card sorts at CSUN?  </s>
<s> Please coordinate with Carol.  </s>

<s> MessageAnswers to a Shawn's questions: SH: How do you propose to overcome the problems that folks had last time we tried card sort, for example, people not understanding what the documents are from the title?  </s>
<s> CS: I'm hoping that by eliminating many of the cards we can simplify the excercise to such an extent that there is much less confusion.  </s>
<s> However, given the fact that most users of the site are familiar with only one of the 3 main working groups I think we will still need to act as facillitators more than a "normal" Card Sort excercise would entail.  </s>
<s> SH: Have you planned methods to conduct the card sort with participants with various disabilities?  </s>
<s> CS: Partcipants who are unable to physically manipulate the cards, could either have their assistants act as their "hands" or we could depending on the situation.  </s>
<s> Participants who are Deaf or hard-of-hearing who know English shouldn't be a problem as we can create written instructions (I've done this before for these types of participants).  </s>
<s> Blind or sight-impaired participants who have a good memory and hearing could still do the excercise verbally.  </s>
<s> Also, I could prepare text documents that they could manipulate on a laptop or other device - does anyone think that would be a good idea?  </s>
<s> Participants with cognitive disabilities will be challenging.  </s>
<s> This would need to be done in a quiet room with lots of time.  </s>
<s> Participants who are not literate in English for cultural (ASL or other language is first) reasons is easier.  </s>
<s> I've done usability testing with participants in this area and with a translator it is no problem - it's difficult at best without.  </s>
<s> SH: Have you thought about recruiting participants at CSUN?  </s>
<s> CS: Yes - at a previous conference I set up a table with posters and signage asking for volunteers to help with research.  </s>
<s> If we can create some similar signage with the W3C/WAI logo's and also ask for volunteers we should be fine.  </s>
<s> At such a large conference I suspect we may have to turn people away since we are limited in the amount of tests we can physically run.  </s>
<s> If we can create post-cards or similarly sized paper to hand out with a time and place before testing that would help get the word out as well.  </s>
<s> Looking forward to continued conversations on this! Carol Smith carol@kognitive.com  </s>

<s> SLH2: And some people will not be familiar with _any_ of the working groups, and maybe not even any of the documents!  </s>
<s> I think it would be good to plan ahead of time what will be said to explain the "cards" - 1. so the task force can agree ahead of time, 2. so there is consistency between what the different facilitators say.  </s>

<s> CS: Partcipants who are unable to physically manipulate the cards, could either have their assistants act as their "hands" or we could depending on the situation.  </s>
<s> SLH2: Would be good to have all the "cards" and groups also available in accessible HTML &amp;/or text in case that is easier for people.  </s>
<s> CS: Participants who are Deaf or hard-of-hearing who know English shouldn't be a problem as we can create written instructions (I've done this before for these types of participants).  </s>
<s> SLH2: Could you (or someone!) draft these instructions - 1. so the task force can agree ahead of time, 2. other facilitators can use this as an introduction to the card sorting process so there is consistency.  </s>
<s> (Also, probably good if Carol, Charmane, Blossom, and anyone else conducting card sorting get together before conducting card sorting to make sure "all on same page".) CS: Blind or sight-impaired participants who have a good memory and hearing could still do the excercise verbally.  </s>

<s> SLH2: Again, we need to get all of this approved ahead of time - with WSTF, with Judy, and with CSUN folks.  </s>
<s> Carol, since there is so little response on the list, you might want to contact some people directly for help &amp; review comments.  </s>
<s> Thanks for all the work, Carol !  </s>
