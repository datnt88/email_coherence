<s> Hello everyone, I wonder if someone can point me to a URI/URL validator?  </s>
<s> I've checked the W3C URI and Architecture site, but didn't find one.  </s>
<s> Is one (or more) available that you know of?  </s>
<s> Kind regards, Aaron Aaron E. Walsh http://www.mantiscorp.com/people/aew/  </s>
<s> 617.350.7119  </s>
<s> I don't know any.  </s>
<s> The problem is that the only thing that the URI spec says is that if it has a colon somewhere, then there can be only letters before the colon.  </s>
<s> All the other stuff is scheme- specific, with some commonalities with schemes.  </s>
<s> Regards, Martin.  </s>
<s> Thanks, Martin.  </s>
<s> In particular I was hoping to do some validation of URL+URN combos without having to bug the list, but maybe it's best to post those here as I did in the past.  </s>
<s> We're looking for full URI/URL compliance for our Web3D URL+URN combo identifiers, so I'll pass on those to this list in hopes of interoperability.  </s>
<s> Thanks again,  </s>

<s> Aaron - Could you explain what an URL+URN combo is?  </s>
<s> I never heard about such a thing, although I have been following quite a bit of discussion in various lists.  </s>
<s> Regards, Martin.  </s>
<s> Hi Martin...  </s>
<s> No problem; I've been calling this the "URL+URN combo" informally for lack of imagination on my part: It's the combination of a URL and URN, which I'm now comfortable recommending to Web3D and MPEG based on feedback from you and Michael Mealling when I asked if this was legal per rfc2396.  </s>
<s> We needed a way to place URNs inside of URLs, which seems straightforward enough based on the document above.  </s>
