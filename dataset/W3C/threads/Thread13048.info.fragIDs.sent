<s> Hello I was wondering if anyone on the list can help me with this enquiry.  </s>

<s> The document features use of  </s>
<s> 'strikethrough' to indicate to people reading the document that some phrases  </s>
<s> are no longer valid.  </s>
<s> However, some screenreaders are unable to interpret strikethrough correctly.  </s>
<s> Can anyone suggest an effective solution?  </s>
<s> I was wondering about the acronym  </s>
<s> tag... should this be used to support the strikethrough text so that screenreaders can read it?  </s>
<s> Kind regards  </s>

<s> What about del (and ins for insertions) tag in html?  </s>
<s> Would that work?  </s>
<s> Then it would be possible to use CSS to present the del as strikethrough.  </s>

<s> The del element is correct HTML for dong this - applying a strikethrough style to something else is risky and contravenes a WCAG priority 1 checkpoint.  </s>
<s> (So the question becomes whether there should be a specific note that some screenreaders will not give a correct presentation of the document).  </s>
<s> Many browsers do implement ins and del - Lynx inserts a word at each end, and most visual represenations I have seen use strikethrough.  </s>
