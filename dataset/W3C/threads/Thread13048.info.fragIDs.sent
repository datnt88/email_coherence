Hello I was wondering if anyone on the list can help me with this enquiry. 
A member of staff at a local council in the UK has contacted me. 
They are 
putting a legal document on the web. 
The document features use of 
'strikethrough' to indicate to people reading the document that some phrases 
are no longer valid. 
However, some screenreaders are unable to interpret strikethrough correctly. 
Can anyone suggest an effective solution? 
I was wondering about the acronym 
tag... should this be used to support the strikethrough text so that screenreaders can read it? 
Kind regards

What about del (and ins for insertions) tag in html? 
Would that work? 
Then it would be possible to use CSS to present the del as strikethrough.

The del element is correct HTML for dong this - applying a strikethrough style to something else is risky and contravenes a WCAG priority 1 checkpoint. 
(So the question becomes whether there should be a specific note that some screenreaders will not give a correct presentation of the document). 
Many browsers do implement ins and del - Lynx inserts a word at each end, and most visual represenations I have seen use strikethrough.

Hello, It is possible to configure JAWS to say changing attributes of caracters as the reading goes on. 
If you put a note at the beginning explaining this and the signification of strikethrough, i think it is acceptable.
