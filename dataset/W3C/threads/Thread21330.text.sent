Hy, I'm Francesca Bonifazi, I have a question about Annozilla. 
Can I create local annotation or just remote? 
Thanks, Francesca Hy, I usually work with Amaya/Annotea and Mozilla/Annozilla, and it seems to me that Annozilla don't create local annotations. 
Maybe you could try Amaya (www.w3.org/Amaya), since it allow local annotations. 
Manuele Annozilla only does remote annotations (unless of course you set up an annotation server on your local machine).
