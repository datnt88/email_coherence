<s> * We need to guarantee platform independence of our tests.  </s>
<s> Tests should not rely on the tree structure unless explicitly specified by the spec.  </s>
<s> (I agree with the first sentence, not quite sure what you mean by the second; DD.) Are you pointing to the problems that are exposed as a result of whitespace issues and entity expansion issues?  </s>
<s> If so, do you think that this could be handled by toggling expected results based on whether an implementation has these features turned on or off, or is it more difficult?  </s>
<s> [mb] I think the issue being addressed here is that tests shouldn't expect elements in any particular order.  </s>
<s> For instance, a test should not expect a list of attributes on an element in any particular order.  </s>
<s> It should only expect that the attributes are present.  </s>
<s> [jb]  </s>
<s> I agree, the spec is the final authority on these matters.  </s>
<s> * The idea is that the test suite is platform independent.  </s>
<s> How do we provide tests for definitions, like the attribute collection?  </s>
<s> The number of returned attributes is dependent on the DTD of the given platform.  </s>
<s> Is there a min-bar, like the attribute collections exists or not to validate these kinds of tests?  </s>
<s> (DD to W3C WG) Can you forward a concrete example of this in the form of a test?  </s>
<s> [mb] I think this issue goes along with the last bullet under technical details.  </s>
<s> Attaching a test case for the attributes collection: In IE, this case will alert approximately 80 attributes because assign all (or nearly all) attributes a default value of an empty string.  </s>
<s> Netscape 6 assigns no default attributes.  </s>
<s> A min-bar would dictate a minimum set of attributes that should be defined (either by default of by declaration).  </s>
<s> [jb]  </s>
<s> My initial reaction is as I stated elsewhere: if the spec expects a certain set of attributes, this is what the implementation should expose.  </s>
<s> I suppose the min-bar would be this set.  </s>
<s> Dimitris, The attached file demonstrates the issue related to attributes.  </s>
<s> When the file is loaded in Internet Explorer 6 Beta 2, 98 attributes are listed.  </s>
<s> When the file is loaded into Netscape 6.01, 2 attributes are listed.  </s>
<s> Internet Explorer assigns a default value of an empty string to all attributes for a variety of reasons.  </s>
<s> Netscape does not do this.  </s>
<s> The DOM Level 1 spec is ambiguous about what attributes would show up in the attribute collection.  </s>
<s> The min-bar in this case should be "id" and "bgcolor" since they are specified on the tag; however a user agent should not fail the test because extra attributes appear.  </s>
