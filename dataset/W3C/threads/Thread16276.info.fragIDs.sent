<s> Ann, I respectfully disagree.  </s>
<s> I think Web site owners *should* devote whatever resources and money are necessary to make their sites accessible.  </s>
<s> But it is simplistic to say that sites can be Single-A compliant just by using valid HTML and "even marginal design sense."  </s>
<s> There are all sorts of goals to consider when designing a site, and accessibililty is just one of them.  </s>
<s> Other goals include making money, appealing to diverse audiences, being visually appealing, and fitting in with a corporate image.  </s>
<s> Web developers are not magicians - they have to work hard to balance the design requirements of those various goals.  </s>

<s> I disagree.  </s>
<s> Accessible design is not different, nor difficult.  </s>
<s> Sites can be single-A compliant without even trying if they use valid HTML and even marginal design sense.  </s>
<s> If it's *costing money* to do that, then we should be looking at the skills of those hired, not at whether or not one should design accessibly.  </s>

<s> Without any disrespect to Dick or Lakespur, this is pretty disheartening coming from usability and program manager staff at the major browser vendors.  </s>
<s> Web designers are not magicians, but nor is fitting accessibility in with those goals a magic act.  </s>
<s> I'll happily hold up the HTML Writers Guild site as a site that a: makes money (and we're not talking pennies here), appeals to a diverse audience, is visually appealing, and fits in with our corporate image.  </s>
<s> It's valid, it has some fun design elements (a few that work better currently in IE than NN (though that's not an endorsement :) )), and it's single-A compliant.  </s>
<s> It *cost us* no more to produce the site in that manner than it would have to leave off ALT attributes, not include a doctype, and rely on color alone for meaning, etc (see the checkpoints for priority 1 guidelines).  </s>
<s> If *we*, as people who are interested in accessible design, and as people who are in a position to influence other designers say 'well, it can cost money, and often that's just asking too much', we've skewered our own efforts before even beginning.  </s>
<s> Lead by example.  </s>

<s> Without any disrespect to my esteemed colleague on the HTML Writers Guild board, I must disagree with her at least in part.  </s>
<s> As the person responsible for the HWG site, site design, site templates, site CSS, and site accessibility standards, I need to correct a few points here myself.  </s>
<s> This is a specious argument because all of the work on the HTML Writers Guild web site has been done via volunteer labor.  </s>
<s> (Most of it mine.) It would *cost* no more to produce the site inaccessibly than accessibly because it *cost* us nothing in the first place.  </s>
<s> Also, most web sites do *not* have the luxury of having (in all modesty) one of the top experts in accessible web design as their primary web site architect.  </s>
<s> It may not have cost the *Guild* any money to gain the services of a web accessibility expert, but it did cost -me- a commitment of time, energy, practice, and learning to reach the point where I am now.  </s>
<s> If the Guild -did- have to pay for the web site, it -is- possible that it -could- cost more, for certain accessibility considerations.  </s>
<s> Again, I have to respectfully disagree with Ms. Navarro.  </s>
<s> It -can- cost money in some cases to make sites accessible, and at times that -is- going to be asking too much, depending on the site.  </s>
<s> In my estimation, in most cases it will NOT be asking too much, and most sensible accessibility considerations are worth the cost and should be done.  </s>
<s> HOWEVER, this points out what I consider one of the biggest problems with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines as they stand now -- they present an incomplete view for making business decisions, and they propose unworkable implementation plans (in the form of the single-A, double-AA, triple-AAA priority-based checkpoints).  </s>
<s> How is it incomplete?  </s>
<s> Most businesses will do some variant of a cost-benefit analysis when considering actions to take.  </s>
<s> How does it benefit the company -- or benefit our users (which really should be the same thing) -- if we take some action?  </s>
<s> And how much does it cost to achieve that benefit, in terms of work, time, effort, knowledge, and money?  </s>
<s> The WCAG only offers the "benefits" part of the equation -- not the costs.  </s>
<s> This leaves anyone trying to create an implementation plan in the untenable position of having to judge for themselves how much each will "cost" and thus, in effect, requires them to be accessibility experts (or hire me *grin*) in order to figure out what to do.  </s>
<s> The fact that we have three compliance levels that equate to VERY poor implementation plans compounds the problem and leads to even less sensible accessibility plans, and CAN turn web accessibility into a burden instead of a benefit to the company.  </s>
<s> One size does not fit all when you are talking about companies!  </s>
<s> Each one has to consider their own needs and benefits.  </s>
<s> Now, I'm not trying to say it's all doom and gloom, or that every company should feel free to ignore accessibility if they feel it is inconvenient.  </s>
<s> Why do I say that?  </s>
<s> Because I feel that there are very many WCAG checkpoints (and techniques) which will produce benefits which far outweigh the cost, and are worth doing from purely a business standpoint.  </s>
<s> ALT text, for example, is a no- brainer if you're a business.  </s>
<s> The benefits, versus the costs, are so much greater if you can understand -- if you're AWARE of -- the rewards you reap from appropriate ALT text on images.  </s>
<s> Other things are not so cut-and-dry.  </s>
<s> ABBR can be -hard- to use, and hard to know when to use, on most web sites.  </s>
<s> And if you know already that nothing uses it, it's even more difficult.  </s>
<s> LONGDESC attributes are another example -- even fewer user agents utilize LONGDESC (and are there any elegant ways to use this attribute?) than implement ABBR.  </s>
<s> (I -think- pwWebSpeak uses ABBR.) As a data point, the HTML Writers Guild makes -very- minimal use of the ABBR element (I think it's only on the HWG homepage, which I spent slightly more time on, and likely nowhere else on the site), and it's not part of the Guild's policy requiring our sites (and our partners' co-branded sites) meet at least a minimal standard of accessibility.  </s>
<s> The HWG's homepage uses ABBR inconsistently.  </s>
<s> The W3C's homepage uses it three times at the very bottom of the page and not on  </s>
<s> any of the very technical terms such as CSS, XML, SVG that  </s>
<s> could USE some expansion -- just on the copyright notice to tell us what "MIT" stands for.  </s>
<s> The WAI homepage doesn't seem to use ABBR at all, even though terms such as ATAG and W3C are used before being introduced.  </s>
<s> The Idyll Mountain Internet homepage doesn't use ABBR (although some IMI client pages do, when my wife, who tests on pwWebSpeak, feels it's necessary).  </s>
<s> The WebGeek homepage doesn't use ABBR at all, and it could for terms such as W3C or XHTML.  </s>
<s> So, maybe it's -not- so trivial to use this particular tag, and maybe the benefits are -not- worth the cost.  </s>
<s> I don't know.  </s>
<s> In theory, I'd like to go through the HWG site and mark up all the abbreviations we use, and train our volunteers who maintain parts of the site to use ABBR.  </s>
<s> In practice, there are far more pressing things to use my own time and the HWG's resources on, and when we have to make a cut somewhere, an element such as ABBR that does not do much to affect the accessibility of the site -might- be left behind on the cutting board.  </s>
<s> It's not as simple as saying "we must use everything that we can to make a site accessible."  </s>
<s> Business considerations -will- be incorporated into the decisions of what should and should not be done.  </s>
<s> The role of the WAI and other web accessibility education groups (such as the AWARE Center) is to give those business decision-makers the ability to make INFORMED decisions -- including telling them that most accessible web techniques are not a huge burden.  </s>
<s> --Kynn PS: I mentioned before that Idyll Mountain Internet doesn't price accessibility as an "optional add-on package."  </s>
<s> This doesn't mean that I don't think it's worth something -- it -does- have a cost that we pass along to our clients.  </s>
<s> Building an accessible site for a client is a VALUE-ADDED SERVICE that Idyll Mountain provides, thanks to our experience and expertise in the field, which few other companies -can- provide.  </s>
<s> We -do- consider it a selling point; we just don't price it separately.  </s>
<s> It's part of the package, and it's figured into the prices for work we do.  </s>
<s> It's -not- valueless and there -is- a cost to our client; that's because you pay for quality and we are quality web designers.  </s>

<s> This is a point of contention.  </s>
<s> :) I don't know if there is an official ruling on what constitutes an ACRONYM and what constitutes an ABBR, is there?  </s>
<s> In my opinion, something that is pronounced as a word is an ACRONYM, something that is spelled out as letters is not an ACRONYM.  </s>
<s> Any shortened form of a word that is not an ACRONYM is an ABBR.  </s>
<s> E.g., "MIT" is pronounced "em eye tee", so it is an ABBR; "WAI" is sometimes pronounced "way" and sometimes pronounced "dubya ay eye", so it can be either; "AWARE" is pronounced "uh ware" and never "ay dubya ay are ee", so it's an ACRONYM.  </s>
<s> The spec for HTML 4.01 lists elements and includes the following description for ABBR, which supports my interpretation and not yours: ABBR abbreviated form (e.g., WWW, HTTP, etc.) In the description of the two elements, the following is stated: ABBR: Indicates an abbreviated form (e.g., WWW, HTTP, URI, Mass., etc.).  </s>
<s> ACRONYM: Indicates an acronym (e.g., WAC, radar, etc.).  </s>
<s> WCAG 1.0, however, offers an example that supports YOUR interpretation and not MINE: Example.  </s>
<s> P Welcome to the ACRONYM title="World Wide Web" WWW /ACRONYM !  </s>
<s> I submit that the WCAG Techniques document is out of spec with the HTML 4.01 document, and HTML 4.01 should be considered definitive -- and the Techniques example changed from ACRONYM to ABBR! Clearly, according to the definitive reference for HTML, "WWW" is an ABBR not an ACRONYM.  </s>
<s> In real world usage, an ACRONYM would be considered a specific type of ABBReviation.  </s>
<s> I -believe- that the reason we have both is that they are both ways of conveying the semantic meaning "this is an abbreviated form of something," but ACRONYM has the additional -presentational- meaning of "...and pronounce this text as a word, not as a string of letters."  </s>
<s> That's how I think they should be used -- and thus I think you're wrong in saying HWG, W3C, or HTML should be marked up with ACRONYM.  </s>

<s> I haven't found anything in the HTML spec that references the Mirriam- Webster dictionary as a definitive source for HTML element definitions.  </s>
<s> No, they're not.  </s>
<s> Do you say "en ay tee oh"?  </s>

<s> However, one of the first statements in the HTML specs 'cover/toc' is that the English version is the normative reference.  </s>
<s> This implies that perhaps it follows English rules.  </s>
<s> M-W can be considered an authoritative English reference by many.  </s>
<s> If the specs follow English rules then it is natural to expect an English authority to be a definitive source.  </s>
<s> Perhaps, there is a misunderstanding as to what we are calling English (see below).  </s>
<s> I do not.  </s>
<s> However, I do not (likely could not) pronounce TAOCP.  </s>
<s> It isn't an abbreviation, and, it fits the definition of acronym given by many authoritative English references.  </s>
<s> Yes, I natively speak American English.  </s>
<s> Is English the primary language of all of the HTML spec authors?  </s>
<s> Which English dialect(s)?  </s>
<s> This may have something to do with why we all have this ABBR vs. ACRONYM blood-letting every 6 months or so.  </s>
<s> Perhaps there is some level of clarity missing in that definition.  </s>
<s> Ah, you bring up an excellent point!  </s>
<s> This very same dictionary defines acronym differently for the two most popular dialects of English.  </s>
<s> American English (which I speak), according to your Cambridge dictionary, does not specify that acronyms must be pronounceable.  </s>
<s> International English does specify them to be pronounceable.  </s>
<s> I do not believe this is an oversight; it appears that they went to some trouble to specify the difference.  </s>
