<s> I want to construct ontology on annotea server and annotate document or html to metadata using this ontology and annotea client tool(ex: amaya).  </s>
<s> Or, Can I define or modify ontology using amaya?  </s>
<s> When I used amaya on default setting, annotated just tile, author, etc. (maybe..this ontology define w3c.org or default local host) I don't know how I can construct ontology on annotea server or amaya.  </s>
<s> I want to know how I can modify or define ontology.  </s>
<s> There are tools that allow you to post annotations in different forms than the ontology that Amaya uses.  </s>
<s> I don't know how Amaya determines which ontology it presents in the user interface.  </s>
<s> Annotea servers can (but don't have to, as I understand the protocol) restrict the ontologies of annotations they accept - for example there is a server taht only accepts annotations which are in the form of EARL assertions... cheers Charles McCathieNevile  </s>

<s> Our Annotea servers are generic RDF data stores.  </s>
<s> They will accept any valid RDF that you send to them.  </s>
<s> They do, however, have special handling for the and the http://www.w3.org/2000/10/annotation-ns#body property.  </s>
<s> The simple "what annotations exist for this document?"  </s>
<s> query uses the http://www.w3.org/2000/10/annotation-ns#annotates property.  </s>
<s> The http://www.w3.org/2000/10/annotation-ns#body property goes through special code to see if the server should "host" the body by giving it a new URI.  </s>
<s> Other than this, you are free to use whatever properties you like in an ontology of your own.  </s>
<s> No changes to our Annotea server should be needed.  </s>
<s> At the present time, our Amaya Annotea client does not have general-purpose annotation display capabilities.  </s>
<s> It is looking for properties from the http://www.w3.org/2000/10/annotation-ns# namespace to display.  </s>
<s> Any other properties it finds in the annotation will be ignored.  </s>
<s> Other clients may do a better job of displaying additional properties.  </s>
<s> So, to get Amaya to display, edit, and save new properties from a different annotation ontology requires writing some C code.  </s>
<s> Annotea server accepts annotations basically with any properties.  </s>
<s> The client user interfaces I have seen may only present some of them to the user or let user create an annotation with only some properties.  </s>
<s> With Amaya client it is possible to define new annotation types with RDF schema (as we did ourselves in http://www.w3.org/2000/10/annotationType#) and and also tell Amaya to read this new schema, which changes the annotation types available in the user interface.  </s>
<s> Amaya loads the schemas listed in Amaya/config/annot.schemas.  </s>
<s> You can tell Amaya to read more RDF schema files in the following way: Add line to the end of annot.schemas to read from local file: Or if you want to read them from Web add: What we would like to have is some kind of profile definition telling what are the core properties for certain applications and then a ui definition language telling how we would like to present them (like gss for IsaViz) without needing to program the client each time new types are added.  </s>
<s> Also nicer user interfaces for defining new annotation types would be needed (as well as new bookmark or reply types).  </s>
<s> But cannot promise when we get there unless we get some help.  </s>
