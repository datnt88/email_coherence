<s> Dear translators, in our translation of HTML 4.0 into Italian we are experimenting some difficulties about the following paragraph: |line 418 - file: "links.html"  </s>
<s> |type = content-type [CI]  </s>
<s> When present, this attribute specifies the content type of a piece of  </s>
<s> |content, for example, the result of dereferencing a  </s>
<s> resource.  </s>
<s> Content types are defined in [MIMETYPES].  </s>
<s> Can you explain in other words this sentence: "the result of dereferencing a resource"?  </s>
<s> What does "dereferencing" mean?  </s>
<s> Thank you in advance.  </s>
<s> Best regards, Michele Diodati - Liber Liber (http://www.liberliber.it)  </s>
<s> Please don't use line numbers for referring to HTML documents :-).  </s>
<s> It's an "educated" way to refer to what happens when you take an URI (a reference) and turn it into the thing it references (generically called a resource).  </s>
<s> So strictly speaking, the text above is a bit incorrect, as it's not the resource, but the reference to the resource, that is dereferenced.  </s>
<s> Regards, Martin.  </s>
<s> Dear friends..  </s>
<s> I'm in traslation Group since 2 of 3 days.  </s>

<s> My mail, it should be arrived in late.. but I don't know the rules Who can help me to keep clear?  </s>
<s> Thanks 4 your Times! Alex Rivoltella  </s>
