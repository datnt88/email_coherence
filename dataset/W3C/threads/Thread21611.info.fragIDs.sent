<s> Jos I've done a load of work on the doc.  </s>
<s> I've added: - a few more tests (e.g. cardinality) - OWL Lite/OWL DL/OWL Full - conformance statements The abstract syntax constraints are horrible - it's nearly impossible to write OWL Lite or OWL DL by hand - take a look at the cardinality tests.  </s>
<s> All I wanted to say was that cardinality=1 =:= minCardinality=1 + maxCardinality=1 In OWL Lite (or OWL Dl for card=2) (tests 001 002 003 004) it takes 30 triples to say this.  </s>
<s> Whereas in OWL Full it takes only 16 (test 005 006).  </s>
<s> in short OWL Full is light and OWL Lite is heavy.  </s>
<s> I moved to Jena2 (pre-alpha) because I needed some datatyping support.  </s>
<s> You will need to download the jars in the lib dir in the editors draft.  </s>
<s> The version on sealpc09 is currently down.  </s>
<s> Also near the beginning of CachedURLs.java  </s>
<s> I put a cheat to improve the performance by first trying a local copy of the w3c cvs hierarchy.  </s>
<s> It's got my directory path hardcoded at the moment, I assume you have one too.  </s>
<s> With the conformance statement I've currently commented out the old section on running the tests.  </s>
<s> That's needs reinstating with some idea of which tests should pass at which conformance level.  </s>
<s> I am not sure if we need to talk about OWL Full conformance.  </s>
<s> Peter says: The abstract syntax here is less general than the exchange syntax for OWL.  </s>
<s> In particular, it does not permit the construction of self-referential syntactic constructs.  </s>
<s> It is also intended for use in cases where classes, properties, and individuals form disjoint collections.  </s>
<s> An OWL Full system needs to be able to overcome these restrictions - even if its just an editor.  </s>
<s> I guess an OWL Full system also needs to be able to impose these restrictions if OWL DL mode is in place.  </s>
<s> I am going to work through the OWL Feature synopsis tomorrow starting with the sameXXXAs ... Jeremy  </s>
