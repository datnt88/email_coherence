Greetings, It's time for another gentle reminder: please, when quoting threads, put your new comments at the top. 
Just try the example below with a screen-reader. 
Some of us have other things to do as well.

said: Part of the message that WSP is trying to get across, is that the demands of design sometimes require implementations that don't validate: in part, because of inconsistent support of the standards in the major browsers. 
IOW, to make a design present consistently, what otherwise might be seen as "bad habits" and "invalid HTML" may need to be used. 
Okay, so the WSP suggests that web authors ignore the published vendor-neutral standards, and instead use specifics hacks just to get around problems in implementation? 
No, I didn't say that. 
I said that inconsistent implementations of those vendor-neutral standards, proffered by a body that many of the user-agent publishers belong to, cause significant extra development effort that costs an enormous amount of time and money. 
and what exactly is WSP planning to do to make this happen? 
The web site gives solid information on what the group is about. 
It does not have "we plan to contact Mr. Jones, at Company X, and tell him Y." To expect that is unrealistic. 
The steering committee has influential contacts at the companies we wish to form a dialog with, and intends to use those to get our message across. 
I know, I know, it'll be on the website tomorrow. 
Hopefully I'll find something that makes me think this isn't just another case of "form an official sounding organization because it makes us look more impressive, despite not having any way to accomplish the goals we've for ourselves." 
That statement assumes much, including "not having any way to accomplish..." As a supporter of WAI, I find it puzzling that you would deride an effort that could result in more developers embracing CSS and other techniques that lend themselves to more accessible web sites, should those standards be fully and consistently implemented in browsers. 
Any further constructive commentary on the group's activities is welcome on it's mailing list, info available from the site.

Vice President, Marketing and Outreach, HTML Writers Guild Kynn, it's not an issue of whether or not this is doable in software, of course it is, this is an issue of how much it would cost Peter and other blind users of this list to upgrade their sofware or read through all the    , vs. having us follow a simple convention of moving long    dialog at the end of our messages. 
sounds to me like software that doesn't autmatically quote the message under the comments is broken.

On the other hand, this is the way I've been writing email (and Usenet) messages for 12 years now, and I'm not likely to change my style any time soon. 
--Kynn, maintaining that liability rep Kynn Bartlett kynn@hwg.org 
Vice President, Marketing and Outreach, HTML Writers Guild However, that goes against long-running common practice of mailing list responses. 
When someone is answering two distinct portions of the message, it's more helpful to most readers that the response be organized in a logical manner: hence the quote, response, quote, response format.

Pointgrrl, Central Coast Webgrrls to follow up on what Kynn Bartlett said: Funny, the last time this topic went around it was someone from "the other culture" that expressed disbelief that we would ask people to change their email-writing behavior. 
However, it is appropriate for email lists to have behavior norms and for different lists to have different norms. 
You're not a liability, Kynn, unless all of us are liabilities. 
Remember Pogo: "We have met the enemy, and they are us!" 
I have been doing business by email for a few more than 12 years and I am actively engaged in learning how to do it. 
Some observations on what I have seen during that time: People who learned email in a desktop and LAN context tend to assume that prior correspondence will be attached, not edited. 
Those who learned in a mainframe, Unix, or internet context tend to assume that prior correspondence will be interleaved with new commentary. 
Both protocols work, but they don't cross cultures well. 
We want to be a team drawing people from both worlds. 
We need to come to some understanding that fits our mix of players. 
Mailing lists are infrastructure to serve groups of people. 
It is appropriate for such groups to form and articulate norms that vary from group to group. 
Email is not Usenet, tends to be more socially bonded within the group and tends more to variation in group norms from group to group. 
Many people learned manners before they learned email, and they think it is impolite to discuss manners in public (on the list). 
It is still best practice to write privately to an individual if you feel offended by their manners, etc. but "guidelines for participation in _this group_" is a topic which should be addressed openly by the group. 
This usually means that some traffic on the list will be on this topic and "the authorities" should treat some of this as "on topic." 
If we won't sit still long enough to listen to one another about email habits, then we are never going to get the Web population to sit still and listen to us about Web practices.
