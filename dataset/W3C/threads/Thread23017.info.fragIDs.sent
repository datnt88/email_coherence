<s> Hi Parpart, I am also not understanding this namepsaceNormalization alg, I feel only auther can understand it,hope editor too, one thing i am very clear ,this algorithm is not covering all scenarios, even if u implement also it will not normalize...i am sure... i wasted almost 1 week, DONT give up, bye pavithran  </s>
