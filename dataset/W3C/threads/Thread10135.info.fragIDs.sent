<s> In the last round of specs we lost something ... between the cracks ... The previous round had Concepts doing more work with XML Literals.  </s>
<s> In the last round I did not discuss the mapping from RDF/XML to an rdf:XMLLiteral, but Dave pointed to my (non-existent) discussion ... :( I did have an action to propose text to Dave: I suspect he didn't see the text which was here (two versions): l#ForDave (also in the archive) On reflection, here's yet another vesion, I'll number the paras for discussion.  </s>
<s> In replace the last paragraph with: [1] The result of a literal l from rdf:parseType="Literal" content is an implementation dependent XML Literal.  </s>
<s> [2] Implementations MAY use the exclusive canonicalization with or without comments [XC14N] of the literal text l to find the lexical form.  </s>
<s> [3] Implementations MAY choose to ignore namespaces that are not visibly  </s>
<s> utilized (as defined by [XC14N]), XML comments, and aspects of an XML document that are not reflected in the canonical form (e.g. insignificant white space within element tags).  </s>
<s> [4] Implementations MAY choose to not ignore such aspects of the literal text l. [5] Implementations are NOT REQUIRED to perform canonicalization when creating an RDF graph corresponding to an RDF/XML document.  </s>
<s> [6] Implementations MUST preserve in the lexical form of the XML Literal the information found in the exclusive canonicalization without comments [XC14N] of the literal text l. [7] See the [RDF-CONCEPTS] section on XML Literals for further information.  </s>
<s> [1] Constrains implementations a bit.  </s>
<s> [2] - [5] are all just (normative) suggestions, to leave implementors with ideas about how to do this.  </s>
<s> They are normative in that an implementor will know that they have satisfied their obligations if they perform [2].  </s>
<s> [6] is the only paragraph that defines the minimum requirement, but I think it could be deleted.  </s>
<s> This would then, technically, allow an RDF implementation to always return an empty string.  </s>
<s> Given that this is (too?) long; it could be reduced to just say [1] [2] [5] [7].  </s>
<s> The problem is that the phrasing is inevitably daunting, [6] requires some study of an obscure recommendation to understand it.  </s>
<s> Jeremy  </s>
<s> Er, I think it's [6] that's normative in the respect you describe.  </s>
<s> Quite.  </s>
<s> Is that really acceptable?  </s>
<s> I think [6] is the entry that should be retained, and that [2]-[5] are possibly-useful discussion, in that they indicate some sufficient-but-not-necessary conditions for satisfying [6].  </s>

<s> Graham Klyne  </s>
<s> I'm reading this a bit out of context, but 'find' seems like a strange word.  </s>
<s> That seems like a bad thing.  </s>
<s> Maybe we could just try to say it more gently.  </s>
<s> This specification allows an implementation some freedom to choose exactly what string it will use as the lexical form of an XML Literal.  </s>
<s> Whatever string an implementation uses , its canonicalization (without comments, as defined in ...) must be the same as the same canonicalization of the literal text l.  </s>
<s> A minimal implementation is to use l without change.  </s>
<s> Brian  </s>
<s> (OK ...) hmmm, what about ... This specification allows an implementation some freedom to choose exactly what string it will use as the lexical form of an XML Literal.  </s>
<s> Whatever string an implementation uses , it must form an XML document when enclosed within a start and end element tag, and then its canonicalization (without comments, as defined in ...) must be the same as the same canonicalization of the literal text l.  </s>
<s> In some applications, an acceptable implementation is to use l without change.  </s>
<s> This is incorrect if, for example, l uses entity references or namespace prefixes defined in the outer document.  </s>
