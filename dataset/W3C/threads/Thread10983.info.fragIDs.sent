<s> We have two weeks left in our month of open discussion; I've been trying to see what topics need to be (further) discussed, and which probably don't need (further) discussion.  </s>
<s> I have arrived at a satisfyingly long list of things I think we don't need to discuss, and a mildly alarming list of things that haven't yet been discussed enough, or in some cases at all.  </s>
<s> I'm not going to post the first list, of things I think we don't need to discuss, since that could backfire badly.  </s>
<s> The topics I think we need to discuss before we close the voting booth, so people can make up their minds intelligently, fall into several classes: those relating to entities and their declarations, those relating to element declarations, those relating to attribute declarations, and a fourth group of general and miscellaneous issues.  </s>
<s> I'll separate out the other three groups into distinct postings, for the sake of mail archives with threading mechanisms.  </s>
<s> Here's my list of general and miscellaneous issues raised by the various specific proposals on the table, which I think the WG needs to address before the ERB actually starts drafting.  </s>
<s> Clause numbers are attached, for those who want to look at the voting booth to see how the proposals now deal with these issues, or at 8879 to see what it says.  </s>
<s> I've also added a few parenthetical comments; apologies to those who think I'm flogging any dead horses.) Participants may also wish to read the relevant proposals, if they haven't already.  </s>
<s> * Should XML use the markup-declaration syntax described by ISO 8879 clauses 10-11, or should XML define a specialized document type and let its markup declarations use the document-instance syntax, as proposed by MGML?  </s>
<s> (Using the same syntax for declarations and instances cuts the size of the grammar approximately in half.  </s>
<s> It also reflects a firm belief that structured information belongs in SGML documents.)  </s>
<s> * How should XML deal with the need for conditional inclusion of markup declarations, if XML has no marked sections (10.4.1)?  </s>
<s> (In instances, people seem happy to use elements to contain the conditional text.  </s>
<s> If XML uses instance syntax for markup declarations, such conditional-inclusion elements can be used for the purpose.)  </s>
<s> * Should XML change the delimiter-in-context rules to require the STAGO and ERO strings to be escaped whenever they are not to be recognized as delimiters (9.6)?  </s>
<s> (Some people have proposed this; certainly many user manuals I've seen prescribe this behavior for users, rather than explaining the d-i-c rules.)  </s>
<s> * Should XML use MSOCHAR, MSSCHAR, and MSICHAR strings (9.7)?  </s>
<s> (If MSSCHAR is '\', then \  and \&amp; are escaped in the expected way.  </s>
<s> Unlike most Unix-style backslash escapes, however, the MSSCHAR is not removed from the data stream; this means \ characters in existing docs are safe.)  </s>
<s> * Should XML require system and public identifiers to be FORMAL (13.5)?  </s>
<s> * Should XML restrict comment declarations to a single comment (10.3)?  </s>
<s> (Motivation: the hash made of SGML comments by some current HTML browsers; simplifying the syntax might make it harder to get wrong.) -C.  </s>
<s> M. Sperberg-McQueen  </s>
<s> No. I see no reason to try to define a new notation for declarations at this time.  </s>
<s> It is a *non trivial* exercise to define a document type or architecture for declarations, partly because the additional expressive power of SGML gives you a lot more options.  </s>
<s> Having spent quite a few hours putting together a DTD for DTDs that attempts to provide some useful features beyond simply reflecting the productions, I know that such an effort will either be unsatisfactory or take a long time (or both): it will either be a brain-dead transliteration of the productions (not useful, in my opinion) or it will be a time-consuming document type design-by-committee effort of the sort many of us have been involved with (and about which Eve has written an excellent book).  </s>
<s> I say no.  </s>
<s> The declaration syntax is understood and easy to teach.  </s>
<s> It's not hard to parse and it's compact.  </s>
<s> While I certainly agree with the last sentence, in principle, I think the counter arguments are compelling in this case.  </s>
<s> If such a thing is to be developed as a standard, it needs to be developed with careful consideration of the implications the design will have.  </s>
<s> It's not something we can do quickly.  </s>
<s> This seems like a good idea.  </s>
<s> It is easy to use short references to define escape sequences for these, e.g.: "~ ", "~&amp;", "~~" where "~" is the  </s>
<s> "escape" character (but is really just the first character of a  </s>
<s> two-character short reference delimiter).  </s>
<s> I think a shortref approach is better than MSO, for the reasons given below.  </s>
<s> This doesn't break SGML, only requires quoting where it might not otherwise be required (but where people usually do it anyway).  </s>
<s> No--escaping is easier and safer using shortrefs.  </s>
<s> I think the better questions are: A. Should public identifiers be FORMAL?  </s>
<s> B. Should XML support formal system identifiers?  </s>
<s> Formal system identifiers are defined in the forthcoming TC to the HyTime standard and would be very useful in a Web context because of the additional information they can provide for storage managers.  </s>
<s> I see no reason not to use FORMAL public identifiers.  </s>
<s> An informal public identifier is no better than a system identifier really.  </s>
<s> Formal public identifiers are functionally equivalent to URNs (to the degree I correctly understand URNs).  </s>
<s> In fact, URNs and FPIs could be identical were it not for an unfortunate syntax clash (both use "//" in different and unreconcilable ways).  </s>
<s> Note that the formal system identifier spec includes "URL" as one of the starter set of storage managers, so it already anticipates interoperation with the Web.  </s>
<s> Or should we pretend that comment open is " !--" and comment close is "-- "?  </s>
<s> While SGML *should* have different delimiter roles for comment open and comment close (and probably will after the revision), it doesn't today and this is an area where anticipating the standard would make XML documents incompatible with existing SGML processors.  </s>
<s> Thus, we *can't* do something like make "/*" COMO and "*/" COMC, because those delimiter roles don't exist in SGML.  </s>

<s> I can't see any difference between defining ~ as a MSSCHAR and defining it as an Escape character (given that we have no short references to decode the strings shown above, and will therefore rely on application conventions to define the escape mechanism).  </s>
<s> Incidentally, I prefer the tilde to any other escape character.  </s>

<s> herring to  </s>
<s> Ya, but Michael was not commenting on the implementations, only the grammar.  </s>
<s> Yes, exactly.  </s>
<s> That is what I would like to be able to do.  </s>
<s> SoftQuad developed an internal tool -- DTDocumenter -- to read a DTD and transform into a SGML instance with its own DTD just so that we could document a DTD.  </s>
<s> If the DTD were in standard SGML instance syntax, then we could use Panorama to display the DTD with whatever stylesheet we wanted to document it.  </s>
<s> A DTD for DTDs could also include a formal way to include a human readable description of the element and attribute declarations.  </s>
<s> That would be a good thing!  </s>
<s> The fact that so many users have trouble distinguishing these things should be telling us that these distinctions are not very important to them.  </s>
<s> Honestly, I don't see why they should be important to users.  </s>
<s> Users want something that they can understand and SGML is not something that can be easily understood.  </s>
<s> Before I get flamed for saying that, please allow me to elaborate on my position.  </s>
<s> I am not an expert on SGML by any stretch of the imagination.  </s>
<s> A brief conversation with any of the real experts in the crowd who know me will confirm that.  </s>
<s> I have been lurking on this list until now because I did not want to slow you all down with ill-informed questions.  </s>
<s> But... I want to use something that I can understand.  </s>
<s> To some extent, SGML is that.  </s>
<s> That is, to the extent that I need to understand it, SGML is understandable.  </s>
<s> My failure to understand starts when I can't do something that I think should be obvious or when I get a result that I don't expect.  </s>
<s> (RS/RE rules are a perfect example of that.)  </s>
<s> Now, back to DTDs.  </s>
<s> I want someting that I can work with in one tool.  </s>
<s> I want to be able to read and write a DTD.  </s>
<s> I want to be able to declare an element type and its attributes, and I want to be able to explain the whys and wherefores right there in the DTD in such a way that a downstream processor can produce reasonable documentation.  </s>
<s> I also want to be able to _add_ attributes to an element type.  </s>
<s> (That is, I want to be able to have multiple attribute declarations that affect the same element type.  </s>
<s> And no , I don't think that parameter entities are good enough.)  </s>
<s> Thanks for taking the time to consider what I have to say.  </s>
<s> Please carry on.  </s>

<s> I think we're all pretty much in aggreement that using SGML markup for representing a document type is probably a good thing.  </s>
<s> What Charles and I are saying is that XML is not the venue to do it because the design must be done with a degree of care that would make the effort take longer than we have to do the XML design.  </s>
<s> There are a lot of different ways such a thing could be done and a lot of subtle implications of doing it.  </s>
<s> It's not even a certainty that it is a good thing in the long run.  </s>
<s> I certainly apply the principle of representing non-SGML things with SGML (i.e., my DTD for VRML), but it's easy to it unilaterally and for your own purposes, as everyone whose already done their own DTD for DTDs has demonstrated.  </s>
<s> Doing something that will satisfy the requirements and constraints of a user base as large and varied as the SGML/XML/HTML community is a very different matter.  </s>
