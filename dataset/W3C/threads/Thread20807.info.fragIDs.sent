1) I've just got a computer with a scroll-wheel mouse and I notice that Amaya doesn't work with the scroll wheel. 
[Win XP] 
2) An annoyance that I constantly have problems with is the fact that at the end of file, the right arrow key goes back to the first character on the last line. 
Similarly, at the beginning of the file, the left arrow takes you to the end of the first line. 
Or worse. 
Try it with the Amaya opening screen, and position before the word 'Amaya', and then press [left] repeatedly. 
Odd behaviour. 
3) I personally like it when you are somewhere on the last line, if the [down] arrow takes you to the end of the last line, rather than just staying where you are. 
(And similarly with beginning of file and [up]). 
Best wishes, Steven Pemberton 
I have noticed this as well and would like this feature. 
I have noticed this as well and find it annoying. 
There are some similar problems with section numbering and pressing left at the beginning of the file as noted below. 
Hello Steven, Just a quick reply for your first point. 
It does work on Windows NT and Windows 9x. 
The code has an event handler for the wheel mouse event. 
It may be that this even is called different under Windows XP or that your driver doesn't send the correct one. 
We don't yet have a Windows XP test box here, so we can't make further progress on this issue. 
Do other users of Amaya have this same problem on XP? -jose 
This has been added in the CVS version and will be available with the next release. 
This is fixed too. 
Same. 
Not sure it's a good idea. 
We have now Ctrl e and Ctrl a for moving to the end and the beginning of the line.
