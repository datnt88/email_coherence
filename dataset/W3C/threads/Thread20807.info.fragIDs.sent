<s> 1) I've just got a computer with a scroll-wheel mouse and I notice that Amaya doesn't work with the scroll wheel.  </s>
<s> [Win XP]  </s>
<s> 2) An annoyance that I constantly have problems with is the fact that at the end of file, the right arrow key goes back to the first character on the last line.  </s>
<s> Similarly, at the beginning of the file, the left arrow takes you to the end of the first line.  </s>
<s> Or worse.  </s>
<s> Try it with the Amaya opening screen, and position before the word 'Amaya', and then press [left] repeatedly.  </s>
<s> Odd behaviour.  </s>
<s> 3) I personally like it when you are somewhere on the last line, if the [down] arrow takes you to the end of the last line, rather than just staying where you are.  </s>
<s> (And similarly with beginning of file and [up]).  </s>
<s> Best wishes, Steven Pemberton  </s>
<s> I have noticed this as well and would like this feature.  </s>
<s> I have noticed this as well and find it annoying.  </s>
<s> There are some similar problems with section numbering and pressing left at the beginning of the file as noted below.  </s>
<s> Hello Steven, Just a quick reply for your first point.  </s>
<s> It does work on Windows NT and Windows 9x.  </s>
<s> The code has an event handler for the wheel mouse event.  </s>
<s> It may be that this even is called different under Windows XP or that your driver doesn't send the correct one.  </s>
<s> We don't yet have a Windows XP test box here, so we can't make further progress on this issue.  </s>
<s> Do other users of Amaya have this same problem on XP? -jose  </s>
<s> This has been added in the CVS version and will be available with the next release.  </s>
<s> This is fixed too.  </s>
<s> Same.  </s>
<s> Not sure it's a good idea.  </s>
<s> We have now Ctrl e and Ctrl a for moving to the end and the beginning of the line.  </s>
