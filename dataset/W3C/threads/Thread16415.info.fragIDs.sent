Can we remove this individual from the list or is it possible to block his messages from our computer? 
I would hate to cease my membership to this forum, but this type of communication is not acceptable. 
I don't wish to receive this or any other type of advertisement on the w3c-wai-ig@w3.org 
forum.

Claude: This person is not registered on this list. 
The WAI IG list, as most of the other WAI lists, accepts public postings. 
This means that from time to time this list, as with most mailing lists, will receive spam. 
W3C already has extensive spam filtering in place, which blocks out hundreds of messages per day that would otherwise hit this list. 
New spamming addresses are periodically added to the filters and spam services that we use. 
If a spam message comes in, it is important not to reply to it. 
On the few occasions when members of this list reply to a spammer, it serves to validate both the w3c-wai-ig address and the respondents' address as valid addresses which can be sold to other spammers at a higher rate, thereby increasing the spamming. 
So it is important not to reply to spammers. 
Please just delete the messages and move on. 
For any further comments on this topic, please send to me directly instead of to the list, to reduce the list time on this topic. 
Thank you, - Judy
