Now that HTML 4.0 has become a W3C recommendation (http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-HTML40/), it is time to update the guidelines accordingly, in the following respects: 1. Modify the guidelines as required to take into account those aspects of HTML 4.0 which were changed following the release of the proposed recommendation on 7 November. 
2. This group should also consider whether it would be desirable to link each section of the detailed page author guidelines to the corresponding section of the HTML 4.0 recommendation, and similarly whether, as in the HTML 4.0 specification itself, every element or attribute mentioned in the guidelines should be linked to its associated definition in the specification. 
Linking from one document to the internals of another is an interesting topic by itself. 
It sort of has the effet to "freeze" the version of the target document the source document points to (we'd need indirect link, which I've seen proposed a while ago, to better manage that) 
The question we need to ask is whether or not we want to have a version of the guidelines that's specific to the HTML4 spec. 
JW:: The structure of the guidelines has already been designed to parallel that of the HTML 4.0 spec, so in that sense the two are already in a close relationship. 
What I am thinking is that a reader of the guidelines who is also in the process of learning HTML may appreciate being reminded, by following links provided in the HTML page authoring guidelines, of crucial element and attribute definitions, examples of usage, etc., which are given in the HTML 4.0 spec.
