I've placed a DOM L3 Core distribution (dom3-core.zip) 
containing the IBM submissions on http://homepage.mac.com/curt.arnold/FileSharing1.html A results matrix is available at Running the L3 Core tests on JDK 1.4 and later will result in method not found exceptions since the L2 DOM is part of the VM's default classpath. 
I avoided the problem by dropping back to JDK 1.3, but it would be nice to know a good solution to the problem. 
Once the suite settles down, I would suggest that the many of the URL's in the tests and test files (http://www.usa.com, for example) be replaced with URL's in the .example 
top-level domain. 
Dear Curt, You must override the default L2 DOM of the JDK by putting the jars in an endorsed directory (the override mechanism of the JDK). 
You can put the jars in JDKdir/jre/lib/endorsed, but that is probably not so handy for this setup where the jars are likely to change. 
You are probably better off adding something like -Djava.endorsed.dirs="../build/jars" in the JVM arguments with with you start Java. 
I am not sure whether you used ant to ran the tests, but then it would be something like: (I think the fork is required). 
The build/jars directory should then contain jars with both the L3 interfaces and the L3 impl (so e.g. xml-apis.jar 
and xercesImpl.jar). 
JDK 1.3 also accepts this param. 
Kind regards, --Sander.

There is a missing end quote on the version attribute. 
Oops, I had some unfinished L&amp;S tests that I inadvertantly committed as part of the changes to the IBM Core donation. 
I've fixed this error and a few schema validation issues continuing under bug 404.
