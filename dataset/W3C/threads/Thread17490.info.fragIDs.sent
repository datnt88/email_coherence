<s> I wrote to AOL using its e-mail address listed on its accessibility web page (AOLAccessibility@aol.com) and received the bounced message below.  </s>
<s> Apparently, AOL access is not functioning either as an e-mail address or as a company concept.  </s>

<s> I could  </s>
<s> indeed write to the radio station but where would they turn to for support?  </s>
<s> Their partner AOL?  </s>
<s> It seems that AOL provided no suggestion or information about accessibility to its AOL radio partners.  </s>
<s> Further, AOL provides no information in its help file about accessibility whatsoever.  </s>
<s> By contrast, the BBC radio player offers a link for those having trouble listening to the broadcast.  </s>
<s> When this link is selected, Real Player is launched as a separate application and the audio stream is now controlled from the stand alone Real Player rather than the imbedded BBC media player.  </s>
<s> Obviously,controls are accessible from the stand alone Real Player.  </s>
<s> inaccessibility  </s>
<s> **let's see what some of the problems have been in the last few days: *e-mail bounces from highly publicized address specifically established for accessibility.  </s>
<s> *No telephone contact on access issues if e-mail is inoperative  </s>
<s> *Highly publicized AOL accessibility website that speaks mostly about the AOL online service and not other products such as AIM or the AOL Radio product or AOL media player.  </s>
<s> *AOL Media Player help file that says nothing about accessibility.  </s>
<s> Taken together, these items represent something more than an isolated and specific issue.  </s>
<s> considering the enormous resources of Time Warner, the world's largest media and entertainment company of which AOL is a part, we should have a more coordinated and comprehensive response to accessibility.  </s>
<s> Kelly  </s>
<s> Based on another streaming media radio site, I think that many organisations  </s>
<s> providing these don't want you to be able to get at the underlying URL which would allow you to open the site in a standalone player.  </s>
<s> This might be a combination of ignorance and the liking for "designed" sites, but it may well also be because the streaming media is a loss leader to get you to the advertising on the embedding page.  </s>
<s> On the one I am thinking about, they intercept attempts to get at the media  </s>
<s> player controls, so, if you don't turn off scripting, you can't get a full screen display.  </s>
<s> Andrew,  </s>
<s> I feel a certain amount of empathy for you as you have grabbed a tiger by the tail and I do acknowledge it is not your tiger!! None the less here goes.  </s>
<s> I was generalizing true, but their overall performance against previous promises made are not exactly overwhelming, in fact they struggle to even make whelming!  </s>
<s> I quote directly from the AOL website days after the NFB/AOL settlement and or fiasco.  </s>
<s> "When the challenges confronted by people with disabilities are known, solutions can be incorporated in the research and design of information technologies.  </s>
<s> So we have taken steps to ensure that our employees are informed about the challenges faced by people with disabilities and aware of the technologies available to improve the user experience.  </s>
<s> We have also worked closely with people from the disability community whose input and feedback is essential to helping us design products and services that meet the needs of our users."  </s>
<s> So why close the feedback/email link if their own agreed settlement was being followed ?  </s>
<s> I quote.  </s>
<s> "Internet policy should foster individual choice and empowerment in the economic and social dimensions and rely on individual decision-making for determining the products, services and content available on the Internet.  </s>
<s> Practices developed in the crucible of the private sector and the marketplace can best direct the development of the interactive medium."  </s>
<s> This clause still amazes me as it is a set up for an escape clause.  </s>
<s> Which follows almost immediately.  </s>
<s> "Public policies should be market-driven and industry-led.  </s>
<s> Policies should be developed collaboratively, with input from industry leaders, government officials and, perhaps most importantly, consumers and other stakeholders.  </s>
<s> Public or private gatekeepers should not be allowed to prevent new entry, deny business opportunities or limit the free flow of information in the Internet."  </s>
<s> Please read the first sentence carefully and think.  </s>
<s> It overrides all the following sentences.  </s>
<s> I have in an effort not to be accused of cherry picking quotes or quoting out of context copied the whole section.  </s>
<s> This suspicion is confirmed later.  </s>
<s> "In sum, we seek to maximize the economic and social benefits of the Internet with industry-led, market-driven policies that allow this dynamic medium to reach its full potential."  </s>
<s> I translate that as "we will do a bit for you where it is economic to do so, but do not get in our way, as market forces rule the day, and we do not consider the disabled community as profitable or powerful enough, and we have a bigger pocket anyway."  </s>
<s> The agreement goes on to state.  </s>
<s> "We have designated an employee to serve as an accessibility officer, whose job responsibilities will include (i) the distribution to our employees of materials which describe the accessibility issues involved in the development of the our products and services; and (ii) the planning of seminars and classes at which disabled users of our products and services will be invited to discuss the accessibility issues which they have encountered, developments in assistive technology and how accessibility best can be addressed in AOL products and services; and (iii) monitoring AOL's application of this Accessibility Policy to its products and services.  </s>
<s> " So once again why close the feedback/email link, where is he/she now and how did this media player creep through the accessibility check system?  </s>
<s> Or do they feel enough water has passed under the bridge and with any luck no one will notice?  </s>
<s> I move on; "Employees with principal responsibility for the development of products and services will consider and address on a regular basis issues relating to disability accessibility.  </s>
<s> AOL has established a product development Accessibility Checklist.  </s>
<s> The Checklist enables designers and publishers to identify important access issues when designing new products and services."  </s>
<s> Hmmm....I don't think so.  </s>
<s> However there is more which could explain how this media player crept through the system.  </s>
<s> "AOL product group managers will consult and refer to the Accessibility Checklist when developing new products and services and consider that their decisions regarding accessibility reflect both intended applications and relevant business demands."  </s>
<s> I believe the last three words in that clause says it all.  </s>
<s> Prosecution rests.......for the moment anyway.  </s>
<s> Please, please would someone prove me wrong, nothing would make me happier  </s>
<s> than to send an email of apology and admit to this list I got it all wrong.  </s>
<s> By the same token it would be nice if I have not got it all wrong, then an apology was forthcoming from AOL.  </s>
<s> But pardon me if I do not hold my breath in anticipation.  </s>
<s> smiles Paul Davis  </s>
<s> Very true.  </s>
<s> there is a reason why organizations decide to embed streams rather than deliver media using a stand alone media application.  </s>
<s> Many difficult to use software packages that have the combined functionality of different software programs built into them.  </s>
<s> However, when the different programs are installed separately and used as stand alone applications, they can be used for the most part successfully and easily by a screen reader user.  </s>
<s> All of the benefits are available from the first program, the disabled end user just uses the applications differently.  </s>
<s> Media players are different though.  </s>
<s> They are not like anti-virus programs bundled with spyware and system utility programs.  </s>
<s> Offering media players in a different but accessible version certainly makes the technology accessible but, unlike the programs mentioned earlier, does not mean that the user with a disability can receive the same benefit as the nondisabled user.  </s>
<s> The content provider, in this instance, the Infinity Broadcasting unit of Viacom International Inc., may have clear business reasons why it only wishes to embed the stream rather than deliver it to a stand alone player.  </s>
<s> it may not be possible to listen to some audio streams using stand alone software so embedded players should be accessible in the event a stand alone player cannot be used.  </s>
<s> With media players, simply offering a stand alone solution only focuses on access to the technology itself and not the benefits realized or results achieved with the technology.  </s>
<s> Obviously people with disabilities use technology not to have access but to realize a certain benefit or to achieve a certain result, just like users in general.  </s>

<s> Not a good thing, although it appears to be an isolated incident.  </s>
<s> I'm not making excuses for AOL, but I see this more often all the time.  </s>
<s> They do have telephone numbers for support on the same page as the email address.  </s>
<s> The numbers are more general, but they are listed on the accessibility page, so one would hope that the operators are able to offer help or a referral.  </s>
<s> You're right, there could be better info there.  </s>
<s> Again, improvements are needed.  </s>
<s> There have been a few exchanges about this, and I feel like you have clarified additional points that you may have had in mind when you stated that AOL access was not a functioning concept.  </s>
<s> I think that you have stated  </s>
<s> the basis for your opinion much more clearly and with this additional information people can better make up their own mind.  </s>
<s> My reaction was to the idea that an inaccessible embedded media player and a bounced email equates to "AOL (or any company) doesn't care about accessibility".  </s>
<s> It's just not enough information.  </s>
<s> AWK  </s>
<s> Quite all right - I enjoy the debate and think that lots of interesting information gets out there this way.  </s>
<s> The email worked when I tried it.  </s>
<s> Did you try it?  </s>
<s> Compromises are made for every software product made anywhere.  </s>
<s> Some are related to usability, others to desired features, and others to accessibility.  </s>
<s> It is fair to say that functionality from the keyboard was probably not part of the specification for the embedded media player Kelly used, but I can't say why not - this one fell through the cracks somehow.  </s>
<s> Telling companies that they are wrong to consider accessibility and the project budget at the same time is going to be a tough sell.  </s>
<s> I believe that the way to get good decisions made regularly is to work with the companies and the people who are making decisions about whether to implement feature X or feature Y. The threat of a big lawsuit can be motivating, but working with the people on the ground is the real key.  </s>
<s> AWK  </s>
<s> Andrew, Thanks for finding an AOL webpage with substantive information on it.  </s>
<s> The only web page identified on the AOL home page or in the site's site map is: This is the AOL accessibility policy.  </s>
<s> I only could find an e-mail method to contact AOL on this page.  </s>
<s> It was this page on which I based my comments.  </s>
<s> It appears that the page you identified is not linked to from this page.  </s>
<s> Kelly  </s>
<s> stated  </s>
<s> err......no did not try it myself (mia culpa) I took Kelly's experience at face value, besides who is to say that this list is not monitored and corrective action has been taken.  </s>
<s> In which case job done!  </s>
<s> "I believe that the way to get good decisions made regularly is to work with the companies and the people who are making decisions about whether to implement feature X or feature Y. The threat of a big lawsuit can be motivating, but working with the people on the ground is the real key."  </s>
<s> I agree, in a perfect world.  </s>
<s> Alas Utopia is a long way off.  </s>
<s> Say what you like AOL have not honored the agreement with the NFB or at best translated it to fit into their business model, which was not the spirit of the original agreement.  </s>
<s> I feel wrists need slapping.  </s>
