During the conference call this coming Friday, the top item for discussion will be whether the document is currently in a sufficiently stable form that it should be sent along to the IESG for IETF-wide last call, and review by the Application Area Director(s). 
One of the most critical pieces of information I need to determine whether I personally believe the draft should go forward is a good sense of how many people have reviewed the *entire* specification, including all options. 
During the last call, I was only able to review the core capabilities, and some of checkin/checkout, and this took me a day. 
So, if you have reviewed the options part of the specification, please answer the straw poll question below. 
Please indicate which options you have reviewed. 
Geoff, I'll automatically assume you have reviewed the entire document :-) If I've cc'ed you on this email, that means you appear to have done a thorough recent review, and are likely to have reviewed one or more options. 
Hence, especially if I have cc'ed you, I would appreciate a straw poll response. 
Poll responses to the list are preferred. 
1. Have you reviewed all options in the DeltaV protocol specification 
(Yes/No). 
2. If no, which options have you reviewed? 
3. If you have implementation experience for one or more options, and can share this experience, which options have you implemented? 
Please reply by Friday morning, 7AM, US Pacific time. 
Thank you! - Jim 
As a note on this straw poll, I think that the question of whether you have reviewed all the options in the protocol is not very relevant. 
Virtually nobody has expressed an interest in implementing all the options (at least, not in their first release). 
The relevant number is whether a sufficient number of people have reviewed each option (which in fairness to Jim, was his question number two). 
And since the options are cleanly segregated into separate sections, I'd be happy to "defer" any option that does not have sufficient review/support. 
My criteria for sufficient support is that there are two different implementors planning on using it.

Um, 'yes', but not very recently. 
Mostly core. 
none. 
Well, ideally there will have been a number of reviews of the entire document, but a high average number of reviews/option is also a good sign. 
I'm not interested in defering options that haven't been sufficiently reviewed, I just want to make sure they have been thoroughly reviewed. 
If lack of reviews of one or more options is the critical path, I suspect these sections will get reviewed quickly. 
I really want to see this document progress as quickly as possible, but I also need to know that it has been reviewed by a couple different pairs of eyes. 
It's much cheaper to fix errors now, by several orders of magnitude, than after the spec. 
has been implemented N times.

1. Have you reviewed all options in the DeltaV protocol specification 
(Yes/No). 
Yes (12.1), but I was concentrating on syntax issues and neglecting semantic details. 
2. If no, which options have you reviewed? 
3. If you have implementation experience for one or more options, and can share this experience, which options have you implemented? 
Last year, I implemented the core part (server and client) as of draft 04.5, which includes checkout, update (as of 04.5, select-target), version-history (as of 04.5, implicit on VCRs), working resources, labels, reports (including DAV:expand-property REPORT). 
Greetings, Juergen 
No, even if I think I read every option at least once :-) 
I had a closer look at CHECKOUT, UPDATE, VERSION-HISTORY, WORKSPACE, LABEL and BASELINE. 
Which doesn't mean to say that all other options aren't important. 
The question is how much time you have. 
I implemented sort of workspaces and baselines based on RCS some years ago. 
So I was confined to local scope and would like to see these features also being available on the Web.

Yes, but in many cases my review was last fall, so I can't claim to be up to date.

Dear Jim, Here are my answers to the straw poll. 
1. Have you reviewed all options in the DeltaV protocol specification (Yes/No). 
Yes, but I have not had sufficiently reviewed the implications of the Variant option. 
2. If no, which options have you reviewed? 
3. If you have implementation experience for one or more options, and can share this experience, which options have you implemented? 
We (J?rgen Reuter and I) have a prototype for the previous core version with check-in check-out included. 
Sincerely, James J. Hunt 
I'm answering for myself and a colleague: 1. Have you reviewed all options in the DeltaV protocol specification Boris: No (Note: last time I read the spec in full its version number was in the 10s, but I tracked the changes as discussed on the list) Colleague: No (But read 12.2) 2. If no, which options have you reviewed? 
Boris: Everything except VARIANT and FORK-CONTROL Colleague: CHECKOUT, UPDATE, VERSION-HISTORY, WORKING-RESOURCE, WORKSPACE, MERGE, LABEL, BASELINE 3. If you have implementation experience for one or more options, and can share this experience, which options have you implemented? 
sorry, no comment
