<s> During the conference call this coming Friday, the top item for discussion will be whether the document is currently in a sufficiently stable form that it should be sent along to the IESG for IETF-wide last call, and review by the Application Area Director(s).  </s>
<s> One of the most critical pieces of information I need to determine whether I personally believe the draft should go forward is a good sense of how many people have reviewed the *entire* specification, including all options.  </s>
<s> During the last call, I was only able to review the core capabilities, and some of checkin/checkout, and this took me a day.  </s>
<s> So, if you have reviewed the options part of the specification, please answer the straw poll question below.  </s>
<s> Please indicate which options you have reviewed.  </s>
<s> Geoff, I'll automatically assume you have reviewed the entire document :-) If I've cc'ed you on this email, that means you appear to have done a thorough recent review, and are likely to have reviewed one or more options.  </s>
<s> Hence, especially if I have cc'ed you, I would appreciate a straw poll response.  </s>
<s> Poll responses to the list are preferred.  </s>
<s> 1. Have you reviewed all options in the DeltaV protocol specification  </s>
<s> (Yes/No).  </s>
<s> 2. If no, which options have you reviewed?  </s>
<s> 3. If you have implementation experience for one or more options, and can share this experience, which options have you implemented?  </s>
<s> Please reply by Friday morning, 7AM, US Pacific time.  </s>
<s> Thank you! - Jim  </s>
<s> As a note on this straw poll, I think that the question of whether you have reviewed all the options in the protocol is not very relevant.  </s>
<s> Virtually nobody has expressed an interest in implementing all the options (at least, not in their first release).  </s>
<s> The relevant number is whether a sufficient number of people have reviewed each option (which in fairness to Jim, was his question number two).  </s>
<s> And since the options are cleanly segregated into separate sections, I'd be happy to "defer" any option that does not have sufficient review/support.  </s>
<s> My criteria for sufficient support is that there are two different implementors planning on using it.  </s>

<s> Um, 'yes', but not very recently.  </s>

<s> Well, ideally there will have been a number of reviews of the entire document, but a high average number of reviews/option is also a good sign.  </s>
<s> I'm not interested in defering options that haven't been sufficiently reviewed, I just want to make sure they have been thoroughly reviewed.  </s>
<s> If lack of reviews of one or more options is the critical path, I suspect these sections will get reviewed quickly.  </s>
<s> I really want to see this document progress as quickly as possible, but I also need to know that it has been reviewed by a couple different pairs of eyes.  </s>
<s> It's much cheaper to fix errors now, by several orders of magnitude, than after the spec.  </s>

<s> Last year, I implemented the core part (server and client) as of draft 04.5, which includes checkout, update (as of 04.5, select-target), version-history (as of 04.5, implicit on VCRs), working resources, labels, reports (including DAV:expand-property REPORT).  </s>
<s> Greetings, Juergen  </s>
<s> No, even if I think I read every option at least once :-)  </s>
<s> I had a closer look at CHECKOUT, UPDATE, VERSION-HISTORY, WORKSPACE, LABEL and BASELINE.  </s>
<s> Which doesn't mean to say that all other options aren't important.  </s>
<s> The question is how much time you have.  </s>
<s> I implemented sort of workspaces and baselines based on RCS some years ago.  </s>
<s> So I was confined to local scope and would like to see these features also being available on the Web.  </s>

<s> Dear Jim, Here are my answers to the straw poll.  </s>
<s> 1. Have you reviewed all options in the DeltaV protocol specification (Yes/No).  </s>
<s> Yes, but I have not had sufficiently reviewed the implications of the Variant option.  </s>
<s> 2. If no, which options have you reviewed?  </s>
<s> 3. If you have implementation experience for one or more options, and can share this experience, which options have you implemented?  </s>
<s> We (J?rgen Reuter and I) have a prototype for the previous core version with check-in check-out included.  </s>
<s> Sincerely, James J. Hunt  </s>
<s> I'm answering for myself and a colleague: 1. Have you reviewed all options in the DeltaV protocol specification Boris: No (Note: last time I read the spec in full its version number was in the 10s, but I tracked the changes as discussed on the list) Colleague: No (But read 12.2) 2. If no, which options have you reviewed?  </s>
<s> Boris: Everything except VARIANT and FORK-CONTROL Colleague: CHECKOUT, UPDATE, VERSION-HISTORY, WORKING-RESOURCE, WORKSPACE, MERGE, LABEL, BASELINE 3. If you have implementation experience for one or more options, and can share this experience, which options have you implemented?  </s>
<s> sorry, no comment  </s>
