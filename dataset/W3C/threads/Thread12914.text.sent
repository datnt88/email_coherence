The WCAG 2.0 document is 32 pages on my browser...22" monitor about 1200 x 1024 Far too many pages. 
The document sets the bar too low/high - in the wrong place. 
If I have to scroll down more than 5-10 pages, it is candidate for a different structural delivery but this document says 50 pages. 
Required Success Criteria for Checkpoint 2.4 In documents greater than 50,000 words or sites larger than 50 perceived pages, the following are provided. 
I suggest that this document itself would allow easer navigation and things would be found more easily with a layout option more like the one below: or MSU: Advancing Knowledge.

But here we also have to make a version of the full document in case people wants to copy it onto their PC and read the document offline e.g. with a screen reader, and finally in different text versions for downloading and reading with word processors etc. Kind regards Helle Bjarn?
