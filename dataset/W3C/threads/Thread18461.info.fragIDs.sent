<s> Hi Working Group, It feels like ages since we last spoke (two weeks).  </s>
<s> As Jon will not be available to Chair this week, I'll be acting as Chair.  </s>
<s> I've been on the road and involved in other projects for two weeks, so I'm behind on UA work, notably processing the SVG WG's last call comments [1], which is the last chunk of last call comments we have to address.  </s>
<s> I will try to go through them prior to Thursday's meeting, and if I do so, I think that we shall have a full agenda.  </s>
<s> You should read and comment on the 4 June draft [2], and bring issues to the meeting in case we do not discuss the SVG issues.  </s>
<s> Other agenda suggestions are also welcome, - Ian [1] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001AprJun/0199 [2] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20010604/ Ian Jacobs (ij@w3.org)  </s>
