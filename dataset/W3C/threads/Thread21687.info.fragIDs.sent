Hi. 
After today's chat I updated the image region vocabulary proposal at [1]-[5]: 
- changed temporary namespace to 
- focus is on regions now, I removed the redundant terms Image, depicts, depiction, width, height. 
The DL version "redefines" Jim's width and height, this may be wrong, as they now have a domain of foaf:Image and the range is xsd:positiveInteger. we can still create imreg:width and imreg:height.

Hi all, 
Looks really nice. 
Great. Nothing like a w3 namespace to inspire confidence... 
I think we should, since otherwise inference-capable system will get confused, and think a region is an image that can be displayed - like we talked about earlier. 
The prose for coords property is really hard to understand (what's the exact difference between "separated" and "delimited"?). 
I know it's probably based on my own bad write-up, but still! :-) 
An example for each region type would go a long way. 
Regards, Morten

hey, thank you. 
:-) I hope you didn't do view-source.. 
I can see three options then: - create width and height with domain=Image 
- re-use width and height from Jim's SVG vocab (domain=Resource) 
- create regionWidth and regionHeight with domain=Region 
But there is probably no need for option 1 in the imreg vocabulary. 
and Libby said there will be an "official" image+EXIF schema at w3.org soon, 
which I guess will have width and height props. 
re-describing jim's width and height for the DL version should not change the semantics (what I just 
did. 
I will change the domain to owl:Thing). 
Do we need width and height for regions at all (re option 3)? 
It'd be another "boundingbox in 1D", I guess.. 
yes. sorry. 
I made it even worse ;-). 
will try to find a better description. 
examples would definitely be helpful. 
my doc-publisher doesn't support them yet. 
I'll try to add the feature at the weekend.

actually there's something up there already:: which does include image height and width. 
It's not complete yet but it would probably make sense to use the image height and width properties from the exif namespace.

Not an option, methinks, re the confusion issue. 
That could work, but not really desirable. 
That could also work, but then 'width' and 'height' would be better (the region part is already in the namespace). 
That's a very good point. 
We could very well use that instead, it'd help the adoption of boundingBox, and not confuse anyone. 
However, should someone wish to add widht and height properties, it'd be better to have them defined, but discouraged, than not at all. 
I'm not sure what the best approach would be. 
Great. Regards, Morten.

I included width/height in Exif vocabulary as convenient terms to describe those values from JPEG information, not Exif tags. 
But now I'm afraid 'exif:width' may imply this value is contained in the Exif data in a image, which could be misleading. 
I've been thinking to deprecate these properties (actually, my exif2rdf uses Jim's width/height instead), but the vocabulary went public ... 
I'm not sure whether this is a problem or not. 
If not, fine to keep these terms in Exif vocab, and use them in image descriptions.

I'm afraid I've not seen the page (none of that internet thingy - but I would suggest that height/width of a region wouldn't be particularly useful, the bounding box is much more relevant. 
I'd be happy with option 1. Cheers, Jim.
