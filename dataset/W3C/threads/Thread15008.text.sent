We're working on the German translation of our product and the translators are suggesting that "d-link" be translated to "b-link" (the German word for description is beschreibung). 
Instead of inserting a small 'd' in the document that links to the description file, they suggest we insert a small 'b'. 
Do you know if there has been any consensus on an international version of the 'd-link'? 
(Of course the LONGDESC attribute will still be used.) Wondering, Chris We're working on the German translation of our product and the translators are suggesting that "d-link" be translated to "b-link" (the German word for description is beschreibung).

(Of course the LONGDESC attribute will still be used.) Roberto: This is my *personal* opinion. 
In this case, i personally suggest (for international conformation) to use the "d" instead the "b" because is important to mantain an uniformity of the use of the code. 
Otherwise, for example, here in Italy we must use the "p"... and this can cause problems for people that visit international web sites and (i think) also for some application that recognize the [D].

Chris, I would suggest to stay with the "D". 
It is a convention you shouldn't break with. 
Consultants and web agencies widely recommend using the "D" here - so do we. 
Inserting a translated "B" for "Beschreibung" would only lead to a confused user experience. 
The "D" is well known here in Germany (especially amongst blind users to who it provides help). 
Hope that helps!
