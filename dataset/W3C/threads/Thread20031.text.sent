Hello I'm trying to use your web-browser. 
But, I can't open my Yahoo account (mail.yahoo.com). 
Why ? 
I want to understand if is it possible to go to Yahoo, because i'm trying this with an application, and i can't and i don't know why. 
I've seen that your browser has the same problem. 
Why ? 
Can u help me ?

Yahoo mail uses a lot of cookies and Amaya does not provide any support for cookies. 
I guess this is the reason of your problems. 
Vincent. 
In addition, Yahoo! 
Mail expects browsers to use the standard misinterpretation of status 302 redirects. 
But Amaya conforms to the formal standard.
