What return code should a BIND request return, if the precondition DAV:locked-update-allowed is violated, i.e. the collection identified by the request-URI is write-locked, but no appropriate token has been specified in an If request header? 
1) 409 "Conflict" with D:error D:locked-update-allowed/ /error in the response-body 2) 423 "Locked" 3) 423 "Locked" with D:error D:locked-update-allowed/ /error in the response-body My feeling is that 2) would be correct. 
Thanks, Peter I'd say that 3) would always be better (because more specific) than 2). 
I think that, while (2) is correct, (3) is more correct as providing greater detail is preferred.
