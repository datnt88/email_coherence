I've been working on a page that has a lot of fill in the blanks type examples on it and am wondering if the input type="text" size="n" tag makes good sense as a replacement for the underscores indicating where words and letters ought to be filled in. 
I know I'm not using the input tags in a form but I'm hoping that it'll improve the page's renddering via screen readers. 
The page is http://www.joneslibray.org/esl/stories.html. 
Thanks, Seth If you're supporting Netscape 4.x on this page, the INPUT tags won't render. 
In NN4, they only render if they're in a FORM. Bill Mason Accessible Internet w3c@accessibleinter.net I noticed that Netscape 4 wouldn't render the input tag. 
Will boxing the relevant parts of the page in a bogus form tag fix Netscape without breaking anything else? 
One alternative would be to use an image to provide the underline and then use appropriate alt text. 
Interesting. 
What alt text would make sense in a fill in the blank in a sentence like "The snow man melted in the underscore underscore underscore underscore." 
How about alt="blank," ? 
If you were reading the page to a class, how would you read it? 
Use alt text accordingly. 
Hope this helps, Phil That's true; it ignores all form fields when they do not appear within a form element. 
Although Netscape 4 is finally losing importance, this problem is still relevant here, since the fields have a very essential role in the plan.

It causes some risks, since the form might get accidentally submitted. 
In fact, several browsers submit a form if you hit Enter in an input field! 
And using action="" won't help, since it will be taken as referring to (the start of) the current document. 
There are different ways to cope with such problems, but some problems will remain. 
Perhaps most importantly, although the plan is an interesting invention and sounds good first, it has a fundamental problem: an input element still _means_ user input, not just a presentation of a placeholder. 
In particular, a normal speech browser can be expected to _stop_ whenever it encounters such an element and prompt the user for input, or at least go to a state of waiting for user input or user's explicit request to go forward. 
After all, this is what they really need to do for normal forms with normal input fields. 
Jukka Korpela, senior adviser TIEKE Finnish Information Society Development Centre That's a reasonable behaviour on NN4's part - input elements can't appear outside of a form so anything a browser does or doesn't do with them is unspecified. 
By HTML syntax, all form field elements _may_ appear outside a form too. 
I just checked this and indeed you are correct and I was wrong. 
(I know it's bad form to reply on-list to an off-list mail, but one must correct one's inaccurate statements). 
By HTML syntax, all form field elements _may_ appear outside a form too. 
This was an HTML 4 change, and I think the intention was to allow their use in server side scripting with no fallback for that field, making such fields redundant in a proper accessible design.
