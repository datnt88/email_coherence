![CDATA[The trick is to divide the token so it isn't entirely within a single CDATA block. 
One solution would be ]]]] ![CDATA[ , where we've split it right before the  character. 
Obviously you could divide the two ]'s instead. 
Or drop out of CDATA markup entirely for a moment, like so: ]] ]] or ]] ![CDATA[. 
Anything which correctly represents the text and is legal XML is an acceptable solution. 
Take your pick.]]

Joseph Kesselman scripsit: 
Almost. ]] ]] will not work, because ]] is illegal in ordinary character content; you must write ]], which indeed is why the gt entity exists.

Hmmmm. You're right; production 14 explicitly forbids ']] ' in CharData, as a "for compatability" rule (ie, XML per se didn't need to set this restriction, but older SGML tools do need it). 
Subtle. 
Thanks for the correction.
