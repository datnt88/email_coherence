<s> For example, assume that when op2 is invoked on the event "conference" it allows both for registering to the conference and for booking the hotel .  </s>
<s> Now, as explained before, if behavior is not modeled, the service S4TP_tourist can be returned to the researcher.  </s>
<s> But S4TP_tourist performs op3 (book a hotel room) first, therefore, when op2 (register for event) is executed, where the "event" is "conference", the hotel is booked again!  </s>

<s> Berardi says that "... all these services (S4TP, S4TP_researcher, S4TP_manager, S4TP_tourist) would be modeled..."

<s> It seems to me that the researcher, the manager, and the tourist all have different goals: researcher: Attend the conference, using a hotel in the usual way tourist: Stay in a hotel in area A for a period of length L during interval I manager: Meet with persons P1, P2, ..., Pk in city C at some point in the interval J, using the usual hotel What we need is a theory of how reasoning about these goals and their subgoals leads to a series of interactions with web services that can accomplish them.  </s>
<s> If all such interactions have to be figured out in advance, and indexed to the people requesting service, I will be disappointed.  </s>
<s> If I am correct, then the scenario doesn't really support the claim that the profile must mention the way the service is carried out.  </s>

<s> -- Drew McDermott Yale University CS Dept.  </s>
<s> One way to address this issue without having different representations for each different choreography of the same abstract service, that my group has studied and implemented in the context of multiagent interactions on the Web, is to have a user agent (an "interface agent" as is called in our RETSINA system) that gets the user's query/goal (the goal is expressed as "book my travel to Paris", in the case of the businessman in the example).  </s>
<s> The interface agent, knows that the user is a businessman (it also should know that this particular trip is a business trip; it can find this out from the user's calendar) and then it (the agent) arranges the choreography of invoking the services/operations in the appropriate order.  </s>

<s> Note these comments do not take into account Drew's remarks.  </s>
<s> SWSL members - these are the same comments I sent to our private list.]  </s>
<s> Daniela -- Thanks for putting forward this use case.  </s>
<s> I agree that it calls out some important issues, and when the HTML version is ready, the addition to our use cases page will be most welcome.  </s>
<s> I think you make a clear case that it's important to have behavior modeled, at least in some cases, for purposes of discovery and matchmaking.  </s>
<s> My only comment at present is that in the work on OWL-S, we've had some recognition of this problem, and we have talked about one kind of solution.  </s>
<s> We normally think in terms of preconditions and effects doing the work of specifying "behavior".  </s>
<s> That is, if we were describing any of your S4TP variants, an effect expression might say: [hotel_reservation_made, event_reservation_made, flight_reservation_made] where I'm obviously glossing over a lot of details.  </s>
<s> But you are quite right, it seems to me, that in an effect expression we would not distinguish the order in which these things happened (or at least I've never heard any discussion about how it might do so.) So S4TP_researcher, S4TP_manager, S4TP_tourist would not be distinguished in a registry, which is your point of course.  </s>
<s> So I'm just agreeing.  </s>
<s> However, we've always imagined a 2-phase approach to discovery, where the first phase would return S4TP_researcher, S4TP_manager, and S4TP_tourist.  </s>
<s> Then, if the requesting agent is smart and realizes that it needs to obtain a particular order of the events, it would obtain the process models to look at those orders, and thus determine which serfvice best meets its needs.  </s>
<s> I'm not claiming this is a fully-worked-out solution; in fact, it hasn't really gotten beyond the hand-waving stage.  </s>
<s> I'm just adding this context to the discussion.  </s>
<s> It seems to me the most obvious concern about the OWL-S approach outlined above is this: The "procedural" style of process model that OWL-S has might not be supportive of the kind of reasoning that the requester agent needs to do in Phase 2. Or, even if it is supportive, it might be unnecessarily complex for this kind of reasoning.  </s>
<s> I don't know if this is true.  </s>
<s> (Actually, the OWL-S PM is based on some work that is intended to support reasoning more-or-less of this sort, but we have never focused on that very much.)  </s>
