I am trying to clean up a document from word2002 which I exported to html. 
The program works great, but I can't figure out how to get rid of the tags listed below. 
Is there a setting I can change to get rid of them? 
Tags. 
Thanks for the assistance, David David - I had the exact same problem, and I could not get any filter (not even Microsoft's own word filter) to remove those tags or the smart tags that M$ thorws in there. 
My final solution was to use Funduc Software's Search and replace tool: The app is VERY useful and by using regular expressions (which can be learned via the the apps documentation, which is very good), i constructed a .bat 
file that automatically runs the Search and Replace app and removes all of the offensive word2002 formatting and other problems. 
let me know if you get the app and I will share my script file with you. 
peace, dude I found that if you remove the namespace tag o:p and /o:p magically disappear, but without removing it, they keep coming back even after being removed with a regualr expression. 
This was probably caused by MSHTML in my case. 
Greg Alton CFDev Thanks for the feedback guys. 
What I have been doing is using Tidy to remove the unwanted HTML garbage then using search and replace in notepad to remove the namespace tags ( o:p /o:p ). 
This seems to work fine, but I was hoping Tidy would pull off that removal. 
Anyhow, thanks again for the help and good luck!

Greg Alton CFDev ----- Original Message ----- Hi David, How about a sample doc? 
I am only up to Word 2000, so I cannot be sure why it doesn't recognize and remove the o:p tags. 
take it easy, Charlie
