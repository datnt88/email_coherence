<s> -- give an idea of how many steps there are in the process on the first page  </s>
<s> OK, changed "this step by step form" in "this four-step form" in the intro text.  </s>
<s> -- use email callback to verify the email address of the user?  </s>
<s> This thing makes it (too?) easy to forge a report on behalf of somebody else.  </s>
<s> Good idea, plus check the email address of the author, while we're there, to reduce the bounces.  </s>
<s> -- privacy statement?  </s>
<s> You're asking for quite a bit of info.  </s>
<s> What are you promising *not* to do with it?  </s>
<s> Sure.  </s>
<s> Where should it be ?  </s>
<s> off the first page or when we ask stuff (step 3 more likely).  </s>
<s> -- hmm...  </s>
<s> I expected it to be semi-automated.  </s>
<s> I'd like the machine to make a guess at the report.  </s>
<s> Here are some things that look automatable: -- missing ALTs -- check HTML validity -- notice that there are no imagemaps so that checkpoint is n/a -- determine which browser the user is using (which shouldn't prevent them from changing it, in case their doing the report with a different browser from the one they used to do their review) Ah... I guess this isn't so much of a general review tool as a tool to facilitate problem reporting.  </s>
<s> So I guess I just got the wrong impression.  </s>
<s> well, there is Bobby for that, this is more human oriented.  </s>
<s> -- I suggest a link from the "mobility imparied access" subjective rating section to some background about it; I don't know how to judge mobility impared access.  </s>
<s> The "not rated" option is good.  </s>
<s> that's the idea, you don't have a problem, you don't report anything.  </s>
<s> -- in the mail message, under "The reviewer found the following accessibility problems" you don't say what the impact of, e.g. "Missing or inappropriate alternative text for an Image or Animation".  </s>
<s> Yes, they can follow the link, but you could provide more motivation for them to do so than just the fact that one reader was inconvenienced.  </s>
<s> I appreciate the effort to keep the report short, but one sentence describing (at least the most significant part of) the impact of the improper markup seems worthwhile.  </s>
<s> I really want the report to be as compact as possible.  </s>
<s> What others think ?  </s>
<s> DD:: "I really want the report to be as compact as possible.  </s>
<s> What others think?"  </s>
<s> WL: The terser, the better.  </s>
<s> If you want a bunch of explanations, put them at the place from which one discovers this form.  </s>
<s> Love.  </s>
<s> ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE  </s>
<s> Agreed.  </s>
<s> Like the current format of clicking on links for more detailed explanations.  </s>
