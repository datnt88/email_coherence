<s> When a recipient receives an XML document containing a signature - perhaps containing an envloped signature, how does the recipient know there is an XML Signature in the content.  </s>
<s> Either the recipient can a. search for a ds:Signature element in the XML document b. or know that there is a XML Signature through some other mechanism.  </s>
<s> Which of the above two is the correct or prevalent model ?  </s>
<s> Thanks.  </s>

<s> Hi, There is no correct model.  </s>
<s> If you are of the extreme protocol point of view, b is always right and your protocol specification should tell you where signature(s) should be.  </s>
<s> If you are of the extreme document persuation, you obviously have to search for Signature elements.  </s>
<s> For what I mean by protocol/document, see ftp://ftp.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-eastlake-proto-doc-pov-04.txt .  </s>
<s> As for which is more prevalent, I don't know right now.  </s>
<s> It is possible that some document uses may be very "important".  </s>
<s> But if XMLDSIG is used in instant messaging or protocols like that, I would guess that the number of b cases would eventually be orders of magnitude larger than the number of "a" cases.  </s>

<s> Just discovered this reply never made it from my "Draft" folder to my "Sent" folder.  </s>
<s> Oh well, better late than never...  </s>
<s> The "short" (and incomplete) answer is that, yes, an application can "discover" a signature using DOM, XPath, XSLT, regular expressions, or whatever.  </s>
<s> HOWEVER, in my view, the "correct" answer is that a practical, secure system will use schemas or some other higher-level mechanism to dictate whether or not a signature must, or may, be at a certain node in the document.  </s>
<s> Further, such a system will dictate certain parameters of the Signature such as the algorithms used, and, of course, what that signature must cover.  </s>
<s> These parameters may be dictated through schemas and enforced through schema validation or through some other way of verifying the integrity of the structure.  </s>
<s> It isn't enough to simply find a signature willy-nilly and indicate only whether it is valid or not.  </s>
<s> Does this help?  </s>
<s> If I read too much into the question or misinterpreted it, let me know.  </s>
