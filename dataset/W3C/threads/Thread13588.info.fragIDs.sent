In the list of existing tools, there is a section called "filter and transform." 
where does a tool like "popup killer" fit? 
it's a tool for users. 
many of the filter and transform tools are also for users. 
should we add a new section to the list for tools like this? --wendy wendy a chisholm world wide web consortium web accessibility initiative seattle, wa usa 
I wouldn't add it. 
I don't consider it an accessibility tool. 
It's not transforming or filtering anything . 
It's more like turning off JavaScript or other settings in the browser. 
The question to ask is: "Can a user with a disability now use the site with this tool without breaking necessary functionality?" 
Perhaps it could be part of user agents - or add-ons to compliment user agents so they can meet UAAG. 
Tools are used by developers and content providers, browsers and plug-ins are used by consumers.

This distinction makes sense to me -- although it's possible we may have to revisit the distinction between content providers and consumers in the future, the Web is still far from that in practical use today.
