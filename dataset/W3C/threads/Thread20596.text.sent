I'm using amaya V4.3 with NT4.0 and I'd like to report the following : In the alt content the text right after the semi-column is moved between the quotes, leaving the text right before the semi-column after the closing bracket What is supposed to be : img src=".small/dsc20010602155437.png" width="100" border="0" height="75" alt="Th&amp;eacute;atre Royal" /a What I see in the source : img src=".small/dsc20010602155437.png" width="100" border="0" height="75" alt="atre Royal" Th&amp;eacute; /a (I hope this report is clear) Thanks coralie Coralie Mercier, Team Assistant mailto:coralie@w3.org

Could you send me more information about your document (or the whole document if you can). 
Thanks Laurent Hi Coralie, As explained Laurent we cannot reproduce the bug probably because we didn't play the same scenario. 
Do you remember how the bug was generated: It was the first time you created the image with its alt attribute? 
Or did you only update the alt value. 
Where is the image in the document structure? 
A paragraph, a table? 
Hi Irene, all, Irene Vatton a ?crit 
: I'm using a script that works on a directory containing described images (jpgs) and thumbnails and it produces the index.html 
(and index001.html, 
etc.). 
The page contains a table of 4 x 4 cells, each cell containing a thumbnail linked to its large image, an alt (that I am not supposed to edit, unless the descriptions I entered via rdfpic failed) and a title. 
The page (that I eventually corrected last night on the amaya running on unix (semir update at each release) which is amaya V4.3.2 of 23mar2001) is at I hope it will help you reproduce the bug.
