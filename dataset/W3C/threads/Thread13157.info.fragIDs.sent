<s> In reviewing the document, please: - check for internationalization of disability terminology - check for gaps in assistive technology and adaptive computing - review the "teenager" example - review (again) the "supermarket assistant" example Thank you, - Judy Judy Brewer +1.617.258.9741 http://www.w3.org/WAI  </s>

<s> I just asked a non-native speaker to read the supermarket assistant section and we think that the following are difficult to understand: * "[he] finds the number of product choices overwhelming" maybe we could say somthing like "[he] finds that there are so many product choices that he becomes confused" * Although the title is easier to understand with "supermarket", "store" is still used in the text.  </s>
<s> * "rearranges its product layout" could be "changes the layout of the products in the store" or "He has difficulty finding products because they are often in a different place" * "they used _consistent design_ and _navigation options_" the reader was confused by the link text as "consistent" becomes separated when reading the text of the second link independently (like "they used ... navigation options") * "few fresh daily items" could be "few fresh items each day" In the references (#intell, #supl, #search etc) the link text is still "clerk".  </s>
<s> One problem I've had with internationalisation of disability information is "seizure disorders" which doesn't translate easily into Spanish.  </s>

<s> Here are some comments: 1. Online shopper with cognition difficulties: spawning new windows / Pop-ups can be a barrier.  </s>
<s> So you can say the sites have them or do not have them 2. For vision impaired users: - device dependent event triggers on forms make keyboard use impossible - Links not grouped so skipping to content or desired group is a problem - Text sections not marked up with headers so need to read entire text - required fields on forms are bold faced or colored - PDF files and inaccessible Flash or multi media 3. For people with motor impairments Ref: ". forms that cannot be tabbed through in a logical order (Note: "Tabindex" solution not yet well supported in browsers.)"  </s>
<s> SP:Tabindex works at least with IE 5.5 and above (more than 90% market share?) 4. For people who are deaf: -audio webcasts that do not have transcripts 5. Assistive Technologies and Adaptive Strategies I think accessibility features built into OS like sticky keys, filtter keys, fontsize and color setting, sound sentry, mouse keys are not mentioned.  </s>
<s> General note:Will it be more helpful for all to get the documents for review at least 24 hours before the meeting ?  </s>
<s> It will surely help me to read the doc and have my comments ready before the meeting.  </s>
