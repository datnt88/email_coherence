Of course, we understand that this would not be available to all users but it might help even those for whom reading is a problem so that unique audation could replace the image or suplement it. 
this may play well in the easy reading and reading impaired segment. 
a plug in would have to of course be developped that would automatically process and sonify the image. 
Technically this should be quite feasible. 
For instance, if an image of the American flag is showing with something like Alt="Stars and stripes" in the HTML IMG tag, a blind user might at the same time hear a "wav tag" of "wave file as alt tag" like (88K file size) which is the sound generated from and corresponding to the usflag.bmp 
example image that can be downloaded from For bandwidth efficiency, for guaranteeing mutual consistency between image and sound, and to avoid adding a burden on any website developer, one would want this sound rendering done automatically on the client computer, based on the original image that the IMG tag was referring to. 
Linking a browser to a third-party add-on for the image based sound rendering would do the job. 
The browser would only have to pass on the image data when the user indicates he/she wants to analyze the audible counterpart of an image, perhaps zoom into it, hear it in inverse video, hear it line by line, apply OCR, or whatever else may help with understanding the content of the image through sound. 
All the necessary ingredients except for the browser link are already available.

Hi Folks, This use of audio files begins to move into the realm of the Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language (SMIL) This is a W3C recommendation. 
This is also the technique the DAISY Consortium (http://www.daisy.org) is using for development of Digital Talking Books. 
The .wav file is very large, but various compression techniques can reduce the size (mpeg, Realaudio) and these files could also be streamed.

In fact it is possible currently to use longdesc to refer to any URI. 
I am not sure if you can have multiple longdescs for a single element, but using Xlink would allow that.
