Dear folks, unless a member of the working group has a strong objection to us holding a meeting, and raises it this week, the working group will have a face to face meeting in Amsterdam on teh 18th and 19th of June. 
I will make a meeting page available shortly. 
For people who are unable to attend in person it is possible that we will have telephone access, but note that the meeting will be taking place in European business hours (naturally enough). 
cheers Charles Location: 21 Mitchell street FOOTSCRAY Vic 3011, Australia (or W3C INRIA, Route des Lucioles, BP 93, 06902 Sophia Antipolis Cedex, France) 
I will not be able to participate (or be there) if it is still 18-19. 
I would be able to attend latter that week or the next. 
I'm also trying to involve other tool developers in IBM to participate. 
I will report back by Monday.
