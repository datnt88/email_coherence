<s> What do you see as the problems caused by seven graphics that are avoided by a single image?  </s>
<s> I believe there are a number of benefits in _avoiding_ imagemaps whenever possible, and this case here would be an example of a time in which it's avoidable (and thus preferable to avoid).  </s>
<s> Some reasons include: * Better "packaging" of the content in scalable chunks [Important for nonstandard screen displays such as palmsize PCs] * Access to individual image links are better supported in every browser than access to imagemaps [Important for non-graphics users of graphical browsers as well as users of older versions of lynx] * Ease of maintenance -- if a new section must be added, it's just a case of adding a new graphic rather than requiring a remake of an imagemap [Important for designer maintenance and design flexibility] * Imagemaps _lack contextual clues of link status_ because they _do not display borders around hotspots_.  </s>
<s> Granted, most graphics these days are included with BORDER=0, but the use of user defined cascading style sheets enable a visual user to turn those borders back on if the visual clues are thought to be useful!  </s>

<s> I would make the following changes: * Get rid of the imagemap and break it into a row of six images; lose the radiating lines (unnecessary for the most part) and I'd probably put the hand graphic above, not below, the other icons for graphic design reasons.  </s>
<s> (As an "identity icon" for the page, it should be featured most prominently in the design.  </s>
<s> Also, the use of the hand as a separate icon allows for that particular graphic to be used as a link by someone who'd want to link to the site, as Jonathan suggests.) * If you must keep the imagemap, please label it correctly with ALT text on each area.  </s>
<s> If your FrontPage does not support this, then you may need to change web creation software and/or code the imagemap by hand.  </s>
<s> * As a side note, FrontPage is including a LOT of very extraneous, unnecessary HTML code -- such as tables for positioning -- which bloats the size and complexity of what should be a simple page.  </s>
<s> You may want to strip out as much as possible of that chaff, since it may be locking your design into a specific screen resolution.  </s>
<s> This has implications for users who have configured their screen width and display properties to their _own_ needs -- such as low vision users -- and may make the page harder for them to access, as well as slower for everyone to load.  </s>
<s> * The links in your imagemap are repeated as text header links lower in the page, which is good.  </s>
<s> I would place a copy of the picture next to each textual link, though, because it will increase comprehension for "baseline" users as well as non- textual users by associating the graphics above with the fuller descriptive text used later in the page, increasing comprehension.  </s>
<s> There's my 2 cents worth.  </s>
