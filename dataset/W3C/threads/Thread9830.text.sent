Item 8: June F2F The next F2F will be in June, 17/18th in Bristol (UK). 
Venue to be negotiated between ILRT and HP. Item 9: Status of primer WD After a brief diversion on the semantics of "publish"... APPROVED (no dissent): the WG approved the publishing of the current primer as a working draft. 
ACTION 2002-03-15#1 (em) to drive this process. 
ACTION 2002-03-15#2 (frankm) to sign up to rdf-comment mailing list (address to which feedback will be solicited) Item 10: Open E-Book forum Patrick Stickler gave some more information about Open E-Book; in particular, that they are going to be using RDF as the basis for their packaging format; they're currently looking at using RDF for their core metadata encoding. 
Pat S' email about the packaging format: And more information: Item 11: XML Base test cases The initial proposal was to approve these, as per modifications here: DaveB and Jos both indicated that test017 and error001 were still unclear. 
(But test017 wasn't crucial to this case) APPROVED: the WG accepted tests 1-16. 
ACTION 2002-03-15#3 (jang) update test cases to reflect approval (this action applies to the approval of items 12 and 13 too) ACTION 2002-03-15#4 (bwm) arrange resolution of test017 and error001 Item 12: Issue rdfms-not-id-and-resource-attr Review test cases at DaveB and Jos both said these looked OK. APPROVED (no dissent): the WG accepts these test cases. 
ACTION 2002-03-15#3 (jang) update test cases to reflect approval Item 13: Issue rdfms-nested-bagID Review test cases at: DaveB: (IIRC) these were OK; Jos: happy too. 
APPROVED (no dissent): the WG approves these test cases. 
ACTION 2002-03-15#3 (jang) update test cases to reflect approval Item 14: Updated n-triples notation for literals See: Jos indicated that his N3/ntriples parser was having trouble with the changes. 
DaveB indicated that he'd rather move on and then come back to revise the syntax if necessary; was eager for progress. 
APPROVED: the WG approved Dave's suggestion. 
ACTION 2002-03-15#5 (daveb) to go ahead with current format, to use with any new fancy literals in test cases Item 15: Datatypes Jeremy indicated that I18N people were somewhat divided on the language/locale issue; they're all looking for guidance, however. 
PatH indicated that if the only DTing mechanism was a constraint on lexical forms, there would be "howls of protest" (including his). 
There was some agreement with this. 
Brian asked if there were compelling use cases to establish the need for a better mechanism. 
ACTION 2002-03-15#6 (pat h) to integrate Pat S' XML examples into his document ACTION 2002-03-15#7 (pat h) remove references to octal, different language representations Discussion of Jeremy's entailment to be taken to email. 
Item 16: Contexts, quoting, unasserted triples PatH: the "next" language (OWL) has problems layering on top of RDF. 
We could vastly alleviate these problems by allowing collections of triples to exist as part of a graph, but not asserted. 
That is, to stick them in some sort of "contextual bubble". 
Discussion followed on reasons to do this. 
ACTION 2002-03-15#8 (pat h) write up this simple proposal in email FrankM also insisted that we show strong willingness to work with people to resolve this; the emphasis on "work with" - ie, sit down and talk in detail about it. 
ACTION 2002-03-15#8 (bwm) to figure out a way to get webont knowing that we want to cooperate [action quoted verbatim from transcript] Item 17: Issue rdfms-xml-literal-namespaces The discussion was based around the following set of proposals: - the exact form of the string value corresponding to any given XML Literal within RDF/XML is implementation dependent. 
- the string value is well-balanced XML - taking the exclusive canonicalization of both the original XML Literal in its containing document, and the string value of the literal produce the same character string. 
This will be used as the basis for test cases. 
- the canonicalization above is without comments Jeremy stressed that CONFORMANCE should be tested without comments; dropping comments was NOT mandatory. 
- this issue is closed - to raise a comment on the XQuery/XPath 2.0 data model that it does not adequately address the handling of namespace prefixes appearing in attribute values. 
There was no disagreement to this set of proposals. 
ACTION 2002-03-15#9 (jeremy) raise a comment on xquery/xpath about corner case on behalf of rdfcore The meeting was cut short due to a lack of time, but the WG discussed Eric's AOB. 
AOB: Move rdfcore discussion to W3C server. 
Eric outlined that the W3C server would serve just as well and would permit the delegation of some administrivia to Zakim, the new bridge. 
Thus: starting next week, the IRC meeting point for rdfcore will be #rdfcore at irc.w3.org, port 6665 [NB: not the default port!] DaveB will continue to provide logs of discussion. 
#rdfig will remain on openprojects.net

Unfortunately, I have a very good idea how fast my keys are moving. 
This action is completed. 
BTW, for the benefit of anyone else who wants to sign up to rdf-comments, the instructions for joining the list included in and pointed to from the list archives page at The instructions say: Subscription requests to automatically receive postings sent to this list may be sent to www-rdf-comments-request@w3.org; include the word 'subscribe' in the body of the message. 
Rather, put the word "subscribe" in the *subject* of the request, cf --Frank snip Frank Manola The MITRE Corporation 202 Burlington Road, MS A345 Bedford, MA 01730-1420 Some of the action id's are duplicated. 
I've straightened them out in my action list; just put them in numerical order of occurrence. 
Item 17: Issue rdfms-xml-literal-namespaces As I recall, the proposal was approved.
