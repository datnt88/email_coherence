<s> Hi Can someone tell me, if I have a number of pages on my site and I name them all for example Company - Section1 - Page Name 1 Company - Section1 - Page Name 2  </s>
<s> Company - Section2 - Page Name 3 etc Is that really annoying for those with speech browsers as it says everything all the time, or is it quite useful as it tells you exactly where you are?  </s>
<s> Any ideas?  </s>

<s> I believe it is a very helpful practice to be as descriptive as possible in page titles.  </s>
<s> Most screen readers and talking web browsers allow the user to determine the application/page title with a single key press that doesn't involve moving keyboard focus.  </s>
<s> Having the title indicate location can help for example when trying to ensure that you have navigated to a new page and are sorting through a standard set of navigation links repeated across a site.  </s>

<s> I would say it is up to the speech browsers to present such information appropriately.  </s>
<s> The correct use of titles is to describe the page out of context.  </s>
<s> Too short, or missing titles is actually the normal problem.  </s>

<s> Please don't post pseudo-HTML on public lists, especially when it is missing the very, mandatory, element that the article is about!  </s>
