<s> A fairly simple statement.  </s>
<s> There's also a bug in it - it doesn't say what  </s>
<s> level it conforms to WCAG at.  </s>
<s> (I recently adjusted the ATAG sources so that  </s>
<s> there is an explicit URI that can be used for asserting conformance at each  </s>
<s> of the three possible levels).  </s>
<s> There are some obvious bugs, but there are also obvious things we could do to improve on it, like list WCAG conformance checkpoint by checkpoint instead of in one hit - that would be a whole lot more useful in my opinion, and is how I intended to be able to use the thing.  </s>
<s> Also, it would be fairly easy to make WART output this information.  </s>

<s> As long as when the RDF parser sticks the URI back together it reaches the right thing, that's O.K. That was my arguement against people asking for a namespace subset of URIs that end in / or #. Namespaces are URIs: *any* URI.  </s>
