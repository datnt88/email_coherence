in teh SVG access note we included a link to metadata about the Note. 
The address of that is http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG-access/metadata.rdf and the stuff we included at the time is rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#" xmlns:conform="http://www.w3.org/1999/11/conforms/" conform:meets rdf:resource="http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WAI-WEBCONTENT-19990505"/ conform:meets rdf:resource="http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-CSS2-19980512"/ 
A fairly simple statement. 
There's also a bug in it - it doesn't say what 
level it conforms to WCAG at. 
(I recently adjusted the ATAG sources so that 
there is an explicit URI that can be used for asserting conformance at each 
of the three possible levels). 
There are some obvious bugs, but there are also obvious things we could do to improve on it, like list WCAG conformance checkpoint by checkpoint instead of in one hit - that would be a whole lot more useful in my opinion, and is how I intended to be able to use the thing. 
Also, it would be fairly easy to make WART output this information.

Instead of having a separate wcag URI for each level of conformance, could we use wcag to define a namespace? 
e.g. rdf:RDF xmlns:wcag="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10/#Conformance" xmlns:conform="http://www.w3.org/1999/11/conforms/" 
Is this legal? 
If so, any advantages or disadvantages?

As long as when the RDF parser sticks the URI back together it reaches the right thing, that's O.K. That was my arguement against people asking for a namespace subset of URIs that end in / or #. Namespaces are URIs: *any* URI.

This is legal, but it means that you go fetch the thing identified and there is a step required where a person has to read the document to understand where to find what triple-A means. 
(I should have used meets1 or meets2 - these are defined within the scheme already, and mean "meets to priority 1 level") Charles McCN Chaaz said:

True, they have to read the document but - maybe we want them to read the document wink / After all, they don't really know what it means unless they've read the document... Len
