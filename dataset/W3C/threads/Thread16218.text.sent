I can't seem to get JAWS to read my pdf document. 
It converts as well as can be expected using the Adobe conversion tool. 
What am I missing that I can't get JAWS to read it to me. 
Is it me, JAWS or PDF that is the problem? 
The document is at http://www.usmint.gov/reading_room/stratplan99.pdf http://www.usmint.gov/reading_room/stratplan99.pdf if that helps. 
Thanks. 
-Jamie Fox Hi, How are you trying to read it? 
If inside the PDF reader with the access plugin, make sure you've selected the Access View with ctrl-4 or from the View menu. 
I sent the URL you provided to pdf2txt@adobe.com and received back a text translation. 
I didn't read through the entire file but what I did read had text I could understand. 
Kelly Adobe doesn't advertise the fact that you can link to live translations of PDF. documents. 
Try surfing to (long URL follows: _room/stratplan99.pdf
