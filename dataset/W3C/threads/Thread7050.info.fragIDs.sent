<s> I hope Paul's monitoring this ;-) This message is a bit of a round-up.  </s>
<s> With reference to: Also previous messages starting with: Lacking someone who's coming forward as a clear authority on these matters, here are my preferences:  </s>
<s> I have seen some software than changes (say) C: to C| within a URI.  </s>
<s> That seems pointless to me and I prefer to leave the ':' as-is.  </s>
<s> I think this should read: file:///usr/local/bin/  </s>
<s> I think so.  </s>
<s> That's what I would expect.  </s>
<s> And looking to Israel's comments in:  </s>
<s> 1. What's the syntax for translating UNC paths ?  </s>
<s> \\hostname\share\file.pdf -- file://hostname/share/file.pdf  </s>
<s> I agree.  </s>
<s> That's pretty much what I've just done in my code.  </s>
<s> I don't think this is something the file: URI spec should try to tackle normatively.  </s>
<s> 2. What about Macintosh drives ?  </s>
<s> They don't have ":" as a drive letter separator.  </s>
<s> So should it look like file:///MacHD1/folder/file.pdf ?  </s>
<s> I'm not a Mac person, but that looks plausible to me.  </s>
<s> I assume the drive latter is the first level of a hierarchical storage partitioning *within* a given machine?  </s>
<s> Again, I don't think this is something the file: URI spec should try to tackle normatively, but a non-normative example might help.  </s>
<s> But *this document* is about specific schemes, including file:.  </s>
<s> It also should mention that not putting the terminating "/" in case of a folder may influence on the result of relative URL resolving.  </s>
<s> Ah, yes, I think that would be a handy reminder.  </s>
<s> The example should be file:///usr/local/bin/ (3 slashes), unless you mean the usr is the hostname.  </s>
<s> Yes.  </s>
<s> 4. OS with a single root drive There is a difference between OS that has a single root drive and OS that doesn't have it.  </s>
<s> For example file:///usr/local/bin/ has a well defined meaning in Unix OS but it is not defined in Windows or Mac, since there is no root drive in these OS. Maybe we can suggest that the System disk / drive will be regarded as the root drive for Windows or Mac.  </s>
<s> I don't think I agree with this.  </s>
<s> Another way to look at it is that Unix-like systems have a more uniform hierarchy than (say) DOS and VMS which have a drive designator as the top level of the hierarchy.  </s>
<s> Whether a given path is actually meaningful in the context of a given authority is always going to be for the authority to determine.  </s>
<s> The given example above would not be meaningful even on a Unix system that did not have a /usr path from the root (and I'm pretty sure it is *possible*, if unconventional, to construct such systems).  </s>
<s> This spec is primarily about the file: URI specification rather than file system architectures, so I think care is needed to not get sidetracked into too much detail of this kind.  </s>
<s> At most, I think it should be at the level of non-normative examples in the text.  </s>
<s> And to another point I raised:  </s>
<s> Test case: file:///dir/subdir/file Is it legitimate to rewrite this as: file:/dir/subdir/file More generally, is it legitimate to remove the '//' that introduce an empty authority string?  </s>
<s> I think the answer in general should be "no", in consideration of: Even though for the file: system, they may be defined to reference the same file.  </s>
<s> (Similarly for removing trailing '#', etc.) That's all I can find for now.  </s>
<s> #g Graham Klyne  </s>
<s> Hi,  </s>
<s> I think an area where rfc1738bis *should* say something is in the area of mapping non-ASCII (or reserved ASCII) characters in path segment.  </s>
<s> For instance, what are file URLs for the following Windows file names?  </s>
<s> 1) "c:/Dokumente und Einstellungen" 2) "c:/a#b" 3) "c:/?"  </s>
<s> I guess everybody agrees on the answers for 1) and 2) (hex-escape the reserved character), however things are less clear for example 3)  </s>
<s> (non-ASCII).  </s>
<s> IMHO, RFC1738bis should recommend to use UTF-8-encoding-then-hex-escaping).  </s>
<s> Note that similar considerations apply to other schemes in rfc1738bis (ftp) or other schemes currently proposed (smb).  </s>
<s> Regards, Julian  </s>
<s> I don't know about this.  </s>
<s> The perl URI module does this: $ perl -MURI::file -le 'print URI::file- new("c:/a#b", "msdos")' file://c:/a%23b The reason is that this is the only way that gave sane results when resolving relative URIs according to the standard URI rules.  </s>
<s> Alternative mappings are: file:/c:/a%23b file:/c:a%23b but these give strange results of you use them as base with relative URIs like "./foo" and "../foo".  </s>
