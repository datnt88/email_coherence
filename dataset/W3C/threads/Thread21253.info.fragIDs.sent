(Sent to W3C's annotations and copied to RSS-DEV; not sure where best to have this thread...) Just a quick note to share an in-progress experiment. 
At ILRT we've been looking at various forms of shared bookmark service, for ratings/recommendations etc. Eventually some of this code might get shrinkwrapped so others can run it; in the meantime here's a quick suggestion for an interoperability experiment. 
RSS (RDF Site Summary) is a data format for 'whats new' listings, news feeds and the like. 
The RSS 1.0 spec (http://purl.org/rss/1.0/) 
uses RDF to allow various other kinds of data (http://ilrt.org/discovery/2000/11/rss-query/ 
has an example) to be mixed into these "channels" of data. 
RSS is popular in the weblogs community, which is an application not a million miles away from annotations, shared bookmarks etc. 
So there's some shared ground between RSS and annotations that I'd like to explore as a practical 'semantic web' testbed. 
A couple of weeks ago (thanks to Libby Miller) I acquired a personal RSS feed corresponding to the shared bookmarks / recommendations I was adding into our experimental RDF metadata server. 
Rather than go into the details of that server (which is still being re-worked), it's enough to say that the data goes in via a WWW browser "bookmarklet" (Javascript fragment) and is exported using RSS 1.0. 
Bookmarklets are a neat hack; Netscape, IE (and I think Opera) browsers allow bookmarks to contain Javascript fragments that can solicit data from users when selected. 
See http://www.bookmarlets.com/ 
for details. 
Basically, when I browse an interesting site, I press a toolbar button in Netscape/IE, enter a comment and category into a pop-up window, and submit that to a database server for storage and subsequent access. 
The RSS channel at... ...is a general feed for recent bookmarks I've made. 
Other URLs give various subsets of the database (queries by date, topic etc.). 
There are some glitches (the sorting is currently wrong; as is the URI assigned to the channel) but you get the idea. 
While there are many ways one might represent this sort of data in XML/RDF, this is one simple way that seems to work. 
What I'm thinking is that regardless of the various bookmark/rating/annotation systems we're all using, a few of us could likely generate data in RSS format for some interop testing. 
This would work better for apps that use per-page annotations rather than annotatiosn attached to sections of a doc, though perhaps the idea extends to that too. 
RSS is interesting in that there are a growing number of tools (see http://purl.org/rss/) that consume RSS data. 
That's probably enough detail for now. 
There are a couple of links (with URLs to long to mail reliably) from my home page ([1]) to RSS viewers showing HTMLizations of the RSS feed mentioned above. 
What I'm hoping is to get a bit more data to play with from othesr on this list, so we could look at aggregating bookmark /recommendation feeds from multiple people with shared or complementary interests. 
Am I making any sense here? 
I could flesh out some details if anyone's interested in making such a testbed happen... all the best, Dan 
Consider a (small) group of co-workers busy with a task. 
They monitor several (web) newssources related to the task on daily basis. 
Old-way they have a newsgroup or mailing list there each can post a brief note with URL of what s/he has found interesting. 
A problem with it is that the url-ed page may be already visited by others (and presumably considered not interesting enough to be shared or annotated). 
New-way, there should be an awareness-spreading mechanism that will simply tell a group member who of the group have already visited the page. 
Looks like the long-time-here mechanism of marking visited links in any browser but extended group-wide (and, as mentioned, telling a user namely who have alreaday visited the link). 
At a glance, this could provide substantial time savings allowing to avoid duplicated efforts. 
Annotation feature should integrate with this quite naturally, though such coupling is not absolutely mandatory. 
Has anyone heard of tools enabling this?

Interesting concept...as a doctoral student interested in exploring the value addedness of annotations to electronic document, I have looked at quite a few research articles but have not come across such a tool. 
I was thinking that a group specific proxy server could easily provide such an option i.e. if the group size is big enough otherwise it probably would not be feasible.
