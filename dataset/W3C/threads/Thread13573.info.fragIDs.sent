<s> Hello everyone,  </s>
<s> The first EARL 1.0 Working Draft was published today.  </s>
<s> http://www.w3.org/TR/EARL10/ Please read and comment on the various "Editor's notes" throughout the draft.  </s>
<s> There is still work to do before this can be published as a W3C Note.  </s>
<s> Looking back at the questions and issues that were raised in august [1]:  </s>
<s> 1. severity Not incorporated into the schema but used as an example extension.  </s>
<s> 2. repairInfo, expectedResult, suspectAgainst.  </s>
<s> Did not have support.  </s>
<s> Nothing added to the schema.  </s>
<s> 3. operator, operatorInstructions, purpose.  </s>
<s> Did not have support.  </s>
<s> Nothing added to the schema.  </s>
<s> 4. testmode Had support and was included as a class, a property, and instances of the property.  </s>
<s> 5. TestCriteria, suite, level, excludes.  </s>
<s> OPEN ISSUE.  </s>
<s> This had some support but some felt it was going too far in the direction of a test point description language.  </s>
<s> 6. os, version.  </s>
<s> OPEN ISSUE.  </s>
<s> We agreed there is no unique way to identify a UA (i.e., URIs for each UA don't exist).  </s>
<s> Thus, I still think these are needed to help uniquely identify UAs.  </s>
<s> 7. snapshot.  </s>
<s> Did not have support.  </s>
<s> Nothing added to the schema.  </s>
<s> 8. date.  </s>
<s> TO DO. Agreed to use DC:date, but it's not explained in the spec nor is there any representation in the schema.  </s>
<s> 9. Uniquely identifying pieces of content.  </s>
<s> OPEN ISSUE.  </s>
<s> The draft says nothing about how to handle changes to content identified by an xpath that changes and breaks the xpath.  </s>
<s> I still think this is something that needs to handled separately (i.e., i don't think we want to propose a solution in the EARL 1.0 spec itself) I do think we need to raise awareness of the problem and pose possible solutions (e.g., 1. if a repair tool: add a unique id to each element you annotate, OR 2. use hashes to help determine what changed, OR 3. if interactive: ask the user to confirm that the element being referred to is correct, etc etc).  </s>
<s> I would like to send a request for review to the RDFIG, the annotations list (www-annotation), and the QAWG.  </s>
<s> Are there other groups that we ought to send this to?  </s>

<s> Some comments ahead of our IRC chat.  </s>
<s> It seems most of the editors notes deal with "should we explain something that EARL depends on or reference an external resource?"  </s>
<s> IMO where there's an existing stable resource we should not in general be reproducing it.  </s>
<s> Hmmm, I'm not using it myself (yet), but I thought there was a good case for including it.  </s>
<s> No, but a generic "note" property could serve for such things.  </s>
<s> But should be a property of Assertor, not Assertion!  </s>
<s> Add a "representation" property to TestSubject, that can be used to  </s>
<s> describe processing/derivation - e.g. a pointer or checksum.  </s>
<s> What goes into the "representation" will be an extension (unless we want to predefine simple things like Line/Column or XPath/XPointer).  </s>
<s> Final comment: A quick-reference list of EARL vocabulary would be more useful than anything.  </s>
<s> Could perhaps be one of those Appendices that appear to be missing between A and D:-) Nick Kew  </s>
<s> At yesterday's chat [1] we discussed the summary of issues sent last week [2].  </s>
<s> Agreed this was a good approach.  </s>
<s> [http://notabug.com/er/chatlogs/2002-12-11.html#T19-15-13]  </s>
<s> All agreed this should be handled by a generic "note" property.  </s>
<s> [http://notabug.com/er/chatlogs/2002-12-11.html#T19-14-37] "message" fulfills the basic purpose, but perhaps a more generic name like "note" is more appropriate?  </s>
<s> was not discussed yesterday.  </s>
<s> Discussion about making testmode a property of the Assertor or the Assertion.  </s>
<s> [http://notabug.com/er/chatlogs/2002-12-11.html#T18-29-39] 1.  </s>
<s> If the assertor only has one mode (e.g., a one pass syntax validator may  </s>
<s> only make automatic assertions), modifying each assertion with a mode property is redundant.  </s>
<s> 2. We considered creating a "default mode" that would modify the assertor and "mode" on the assertion that would override the default mode.  </s>
<s> However, there would be issues combining data if one set of assertions assumed a default mode and another did not.  </s>
<s> i.e., IF (assertor has a mode) THEN (assertion inherits it UNLESS assertion overrides it) ELSE (assertion SHOULD have its own) 3. assertedBy is already a property of assertion, so if mode modifies assertor then mode could be derived from tracing back to the assertor (through assertedBy).  </s>
<s> However, this is an extra step that we are not sure current tools would make.  </s>
<s> We had a 2-to-1 split on how to resolve this.  </s>
<s> The stronger position is to  </s>
<s> only allow mode as a property of assertion because allowing it on assertor  </s>
<s> requires an extra processing step that might not be handled by current tools.  </s>
<s> We did not have a resolution on this.  </s>
<s> I propose including this issue in the Request for Review that will be sent to the various groups (listed below).  </s>
<s> did not discuss.  </s>
<s> did not discuss.  </s>
<s> would be handled by the reprOf proposal (see issue #9).  </s>
<s> discussion begins at: I took an action to ask danbri or eric or someone and look at other schemas to see how they import terms from other schema.  </s>
<s> discussion begins at: http://notabug.com/er/chatlogs/2002-12-11.html#T19-16-58  </s>
<s> We had consensus to propose using reprOf as a property to TestSubject that can be used as a generic hook to describe processing/derivation - e.g. an XPath/XPointer, checksum, snapshot, line/column, set of HTTP headers, a description of process and results including a snapshot, a webservice that reproduces the processing, points to the piece of source code that provides the functionality in question (if TestSubject is software), etc.  </s>
<s> Thus, what goes into reprOf will be an extension.  </s>
<s> Currently, the schema says: We propose changing it to: Leaving the range open so that people can extend as needed.  </s>
<s> Also, we would include an explanation that describes a variety of possibilities for extensions (ala the above examples).  </s>
<s> added to the list: web-ont, validator, and niq may forward on to some usenet groups.  </s>
<s> I plan to send a request for review by next week.  </s>
<s> I would like to discuss the other open issues first.  </s>

<s> Assertion.  </s>
<s> to  </s>
<s> assertor  </s>
<s> tools.  </s>
<s> I'm inclined towards having it on the assertion, but the cost here is a lack of brevity so it would be nice if it could be inherited, I don't see much of a problem in having it in both places.  </s>
<s> The downside is that the naive tool won't know what type of test was done, that's hardly disastrous though.  </s>
<s> I understood you never used range rdf:resource="rdfs:resource" anyway, since everything is a resource so it's an entirely redundant statement.  </s>
<s> I could be wrong though, my experience is limited.  </s>
