- entailment tests and manifest files. 
Jos, in the directory there is another Manifest.rdf that describes both parser and entailment tests for your conjunctive range/domain issue. 
Hopefully this provides sufficient examples to describe your other entailment work; I'm writing words for all of this RSN. 
[wondering what RSN might mean...] you've made up a good test vocabulary Jan !! I'm trying to adapt our running code for that and for the moment it uses NT/N3 documents, so I have to do conversions using ARP and/or CWM for the .../rdfs-domain-and-range/Manifest.rdf 
I get some errors like error when processing attribute rdf:resource. 
Cannot have attribute rdf:resource in this context. 
so I've (*) added a couple of rdf:parseType="Resource" attributes (as well as test:NT-Document elements for the PositiveEntailmentTest) and that worked for ARP as well as for with CWM what I'm going to do is: o assert .../rdfs-domain-and-range/Manifest.nt o prove .../rdfs-domain-and-range/Manifest.nt but in the mean time also create/setup new engines per eee a ts:PositiveEntailmentTest . 
eee ts:premiseDocument [ ts:NT-Document aaa ] . 
eee ts:entailmentRules [ ts:NT-Document bbb ] . 
eee ts:conclusionDocument [ ts:NT-Document ccc ] . 
so that we can also prove the entailments at the end [coming back later] Jos (*) (See attached file: Manifest.rdf) - entailment tests and manifest files.

Doh! - late at night. 
Those should be rdf:about. 
Fixing now.

Hi Jan, hm... is that OK? 1. we get Jena's protest when processing general start element tag. 
Cannot have another XML element here. 
(Maybe one object has already been given as the value of the enclosing property).

2. isn't the intent to say testcase test:inputDocument [ test:RDF-XML-Document uri ] . 
which is what we tried in the version of last sunday (which I just overwrote BTW, but I guess it's still in W3C's CVS) Jos
