<s> Better still to save the Word doc as html and then run it through MS Office filter (assuming it's Word 2000) and Tidy then put it up as a web page.  </s>
<s> That's what I do to Word documents and it sorts them out good and proper :p  </s>
<s> That said, if the original Word doc is marked up properly with headings etc and contains no images won't the resulting pdf be OK for screen readers?  </s>

<s> c.uk It probably would be better to use the save as word option and then run the document through HTML Tidy rather than use PDF.  </s>
<s> Or even if it is in word Select all ...Copy it to Notepad to make it into straight text and then copy it to your favorite HTML editor....Of course any images would need markup.  </s>

<s> c.uk Dear ALL, Thankyou all for you taking the time to read my paper (if you could).  </s>
<s> Sorry to those who are unable to read the Word Doc, unfortunately I use Word as my native word processing format and my intention was to allow those who wanted - to send me an edited version as some have done.  </s>
<s> I posted the origonal posting up while on the move and as such don't have access to produce other formats.  </s>
<s> If you looked at the web page you should have seen that I do intend to put up a PDF version, but I have not been in my office for over a week and I do not have a PDF maker on the move.  </s>
<s> I shall post a PDF version as soon as I can get a chance (I will then post a note to notify you all it is up).  </s>
<s> I have had quite a few comments so far (especially thanks to Joe Clark) and will be attempting to encorporate them.  </s>

<s> I think you meant to say that non-Windows users cannot make use of the accessibility features in the latest version of PDF (except in as much as they are also used to improve the creation of PDA versions).  </s>
<s> In my experience, non-Windowws users are much more likely to be able to read PDF documents visually, as many of them have ghostscript, if not Acrobat Reader, whereas, unlike Flash, people only end up with Acrobat Reader on Windows if they install non-Microsoft products that use PDF for documentation, or download the reader for themselves.  </s>
