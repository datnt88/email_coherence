<s> I would like to write a program that goes to a web site and does an HTTP GET and instead of coming back with an HTML page, I would like to come back with a directory listing of files.  </s>
<s> The HTML page will contain links to the files  </s>
<s> in the same directory but instead of having to parse the HTML page for the file names I would like to just get a directory listing as this would make the downloading of these files easier.  </s>
<s> Does anyone know of a way to do this?  </s>

<s> This can't happen unless the server permits it.  </s>
<s> If you have control of the server, look into WebDAV (RFC-2518, http://www.webdav.org), which lets you use a PROPFIND method to list the files.  </s>

<s> You might try setting up a CGI script that gets the directory information and sends it back as plain text.  </s>
<s> Your program can then open a socket to the web server, and read the list of returned files like a text file.  </s>
