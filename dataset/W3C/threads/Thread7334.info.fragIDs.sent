<s> - Jim WWW Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WEBDAV) BOF Meeting Minutes San Jose IETF Meeting December 11, 1996, Reported by Jim Whitehead (U.C. Irvine) Jim Whitehead, U.C. Irvine chaired the meeting.  </s>
<s> The BOF on WWW Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WEBDAV) was held on Wednesday, December 11, 1996, from 09:00-11:30, with 79 people in attendance over the duration of the meeting.  </s>
<s> Jim Whitehead presented an overview and history of WWW Distributed Authoring and Versioning, including  </s>
<s> information on how to become involved in the work of the DAV group, which  </s>
<s> was followed by a detailed presentation on the current Distributed Authoring and Versioning (DAV) functional requirements.  </s>
<s> During the presentation of the DAV functional requirements there was lively discussion on many points:  </s>
<s> LOCKS. Meeting participants expressed the opinion that remote lock administration functionality is needed.  </s>
<s> At present, there seems to be an assumption that the webmaster will perform this lock administration role, which could become onerous if there are many active locks.  </s>
<s> There was some discussion  </s>
<s> on whether lock timeouts would help address the lock administration problem.  </s>
<s> Several comments addressed the need for some authentication technology to be used to identify and validate the user or agent operating on a lock.  </s>
<s> Existing HTTP authentication schemes (basic, MD5) were discussed in this context, and there was a suggestion that public key technology should be investigated for this use.  </s>
<s> There were some questions concerning what error codes and conditions might result from locking activities.  </s>
<s> Several participants stated that it would be helpful to have a model of access control which matches the locking model.  </s>
<s> It was observed that the proposed "read lock" was really a convenience access control function to modify the read permissions on a resource, and that a read lock might not really be a lock.  </s>
<s> MOVE.  </s>
<s> There was a thread of discussion concerning how intelligent an operation "move" should be.  </s>
<s> Some participants felt that HTTP should recognize the special nature of HTML media types, and automatically perform some link maintenance on links which are broken by a move.  </s>
<s> This intelligent move operation was referred to as a "magic move."  </s>
<s> Three link cases were identified: 1) links to a resource, 2) links from a resource, and 3) links within a resource.  </s>
<s> While it is impossible to correct all links pointing to a resource (since in general you do not know or have control over all of the links pointing to you), it is conceivable that links from a resource, and links within a resource might be corrected.  </s>
<s> Also, it might be possible  </s>
<s> to correct all links in documents that you do have control over (such as the documents on a single server).  </s>
<s> However, some participants expressed serious concerns over allowing a move operation to have side-effects which could modify the resource being moved, or even modify resources which were not being moved.  </s>
<s> These participants stated that what was most important was being able to know exactly what the consequences of an operation would be before executing the operation.  </s>
<s> As a result, each DAV operation must have precisely defined semantics.  </s>
<s> Finally, it was noted that this discussion had some similarity to the symbol table and link table issues which occur in compiler/linker development.  </s>
<s> MISCELLANEOUS.  </s>
<s> There was a recommendation that the DAV protocol be supportive of links to a discussion forum, so that remotely authored documents could be embedded in an issue discussion space, or a rationale space.  </s>
<s> One participant recommended that even if the DAV group is not planning on developing DAV-specific authentication or security technologies, that we should still develop requirements by which authentication or security technologies can be assessed for their usefulness to DAV activity.  </s>
<s> It would also be helpful to develop the hooks necessary to use some existing authentication and security technologies.  </s>
<s> There were recommendations of related protocols and systems to investigate: Andrew File System (AFS), Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP), and Application Configuration Access Protocol (ACAP) were recommended to be examined for their models of access control.  </s>
<s> FORM WORKING GROUP.  </s>
<s> At the end of the session, the attendees were polled on whether they thought it would be worthwhile for the IETF to work on WWW Distributed Authoring and Versioning.  </s>
<s> Overwhelmingly, the attendees thought the IETF  </s>
<s> should pursue work in this area (the vast majority were in favor, with 2-3 opposed, and a handful of abstentions).  </s>
<s> *** Meeting Adjourned ***  </s>
<s> More generally, I believe there was discussion regarding whether sufficient distinctions were being made within the DAV effort between access control functionality (designed to ensure changes are made by those who have permission) and database locking functionality (designed to ensure the logical integrity and consistency of all operations performed on possibly changing information).  </s>
<s> (For a SQL Server perspective on definitions for various kinds of locks, see the answer to question 6.3 of the Sybase FAQ, at e.g.  </s>
<s> This highlights the tension between the authoring and versioning communities represented at the meeting.  </s>
<s> From an authoring perspective, these "assisted move" operations will be required functionality of any competitive product.  </s>
<s> From a versioning perspective, assisted move operations appear as compound operations requiring the renaming of one document in a repository and the simultaneous modification of several others.  </s>
<s> Combined with the uncertain WEBDAV terminology regarding locking (and assisted moves would require locking, yes?) this lead some attendees to express skepticism about WEBDAV's chances for success in this area.  </s>
<s> I was opposed specifically because it seemed the tension (conflict?) between the authoring and versioning communities made the formation of a joint working group less likely to achieve ietf objectives than e.g. the formation of separate working groups.  </s>
<s> Both in the context of web content development and elsewhere, it might be beneficial to have "versioning aware" authoring tools, without having those authoring tools attempt to provide a complete set of versioning functionality.  </s>
<s> For example, how many users of e.g. Microsoft Word attempt to use its internal versioning capabilities for anything more than casual use?  </s>
<s> Sean Shapira sds@jazzie.com +1 206 443 2028  </s>
<s> Agreed. I'll clarify this in the minutes.  </s>
<s> I also agree that our locking was blurring the distinction between access control and serialization control.  </s>
<s> This was partly intentional.  </s>
<s> While I personally believe that defining a Web access control scheme would be very beneficial to the DAV activity, I also know that developing such a scheme would significantly delay the development of a DAV protocol specification.  </s>
<s> Hence there was an early decision not to explicitly address access control, at least in the first rev.  </s>
<s> of this working group's activities.  </s>
<s> Given this, the "locks" initially proposed can be viewed as both locks, and a simple access control scheme.  </s>
<s> The initial locking proposal has since received significant critical attention, much of it negative.  </s>
<s> At the recent Design Team meeting (notes from this meeting are currently being revised prior to being posted to the list) a decision was made to limit the scope of locking activity specified to only exclusive write locks, which can exist on either partial resources (byte ranges), or whole resources.  </s>
<s> The semantics of a write lock is that only the owner of a write lock may modify the locked resource.  </s>
<s> Locking is now completely orthogonal to access control, so it is entirely possible (but useless) to have a write lock on a resource on which a user does not have write permission.  </s>
<s> The question is really whether "assisted" | "magic" move should be in the HTTP interface to the repository.  </s>
<s> I totally agree with you that assisted move should be in the *user* interface of an authoring tool.  </s>
<s> However, I think the burden of proof rests on you to explain why assisted move should be part of the semantics of MOVE, especially since HTTP is an object-oriented protocol, and hence the scope of almost all methods is the resource to which they are addressed.  </s>
<s> Having side-effects on other, non-specified resources seems very undesirable from both an authoring and a versioning standpoint.  </s>
<s> When a user requests an operation, they need to know exactly what action will take place, and which resources will be affected.  </s>
<s> Failure to do this will result in a lack of user understanding and confidence in the functionality.  </s>
<s> - Jim  </s>
<s> Agreed.  </s>
<s> But perhaps examining a trivial assisted move example would help highlight the relationship between assisted moves and locking?  </s>
<s> Consider the case where foo.html and bar.html comprise the entire set of documents under DAV control, and the text of foo.html includes an "href=bar.html".  </s>
<s> An author decides it would be better if bar.html were renamed bat.html, and indicates an intent to make this change via some intuitive user interface.  </s>
<s> A sequence of operations to achieve this objective might include: 1. Rename the bar.html object (including its version history) to bat.html.  </s>
<s> 2. Update the foo.html object so that the text of its current version includes "href=bat.html"  </s>
<s> in place of "href=bar.html".  </s>
<s> 3. Create an object which ensures that http requests for bar.html are redirected to bat.html.  </s>
<s> If any of these operations fail while others succeed, the user will be unhappy with the result, so the client needs to ensure the server performs them in a way such that either all the operations succeed or all the operations fail.  </s>
<s> Does that match the concensus view of the WEBDAV community?  </s>
<s> Jim makes a convincing case above ("the scope of almost all methods is the resource to which they are addressed") that these should be handled by the client as 3 separate operations rather than hiding them within the server.  </s>
<s> So does current WEBDAV thinking have the client explicitly employ some sufficient set of locking mechanisms to ensure the success of all three operations (as a naive reading of draft-goland-http- webdav-00.txt  </s>
<s> might seem to indicate), or does the client use transaction-oriented operations (e.g. begin transaction, commit transaction, abort transaction) for this?  </s>
<s> Sean Shapira sds@jazzie.com (206) 443-2028  </s>
<s> This has been an area of open debate.  </s>
<s> We all realize that we are getting dangerously close to creating a transaction oriented system.  </s>
<s> Our current solution is to take all three commands and wrap them in a message/multi-part w/the atomic switch activated.  </s>
<s> However it should be pointed out that currently there is no way for the user to perform the third action.  </s>
<s> We do not support redirect in DAV.  </s>
<s> This decision was made at the last technical meeting.  </s>
<s> So the best the user could do w/DAV is send an atomic message/multi-part locking the two files.  </s>
<s> Then send two messages making appropriate changes.  </s>
<s> The redirection would have to be performed through another mechanism.  </s>
