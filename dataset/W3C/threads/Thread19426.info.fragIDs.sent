<s> Although I am impressed by the concepts and some of the implementation of Amaya (1.3), I am finding it tiring as a usable tool on Windows (NT4 SP3) because it just doesn't handle as a Windows application should at a basic level.  </s>
<s> I can't select, cut or paste with any degree of certainty and I've found the DEL key to force-quit Amaya a couple of times now.  </s>
<s> These are not killer problems, but they roughen its functionality so that it's an effort to drive.  </s>
<s> Is this just my installation or do others have this problem?  </s>
<s> If the latter, will a future release of Amaya be worked on so that it runs smoothly on Windows?  </s>
<s> Also, I'm unclear how soon the missing features will appear in Amaya.  </s>
<s> Will it be possible to get a view of the rollout schedule for features, or is it too much a research tool?  </s>

<s> Sometimes, it's difficult to manage.  </s>
<s> It's possible that Amaya still includes errors, but sometimes it's also due to Windows installation itself.  </s>
<s> Normally select, cut or paste should work.  </s>

<s> Amaya was the only application I have that exhibited these basic usability problems on my Windows NT system.  </s>
<s> I have abandoned it for the present.  </s>
<s> Select, cut and paste usually worked, but not instantly and not reliably where the cursor was.  </s>
<s> Thank you.  </s>
<s> When I hear that the next release has arrived I shall try it again in the hope for better Windows performance.  </s>
