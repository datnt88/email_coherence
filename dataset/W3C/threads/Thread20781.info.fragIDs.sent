Hello all, there is a small group who have undertaken a spanish translation of the help documentation, and taking responsibility for checking the messages and dialogues (there are a couple of those that turn up in english still grin/ The translators are an informal subgrop of SIDAR http://www.sidar.org - hopefully we will soon have some pages to add back.

Hi, I'm on the Winwriters team that is currently re-vamping the help documention for Amaya. 
I wanted to alert you to the fact that we have re-written much of the existing documention, and we are planning on having it be part of the next release in December. 
Your translation team may want to take this into consideration. 
If you have any questions, you can contact Matthew Ellison at matthew@winwriters.com. 
Best regards, Michael Spinella

Yes, I would like to pass this information back as soon as possible (before people get too far into the work). 
Is the new documentation committed to the CVS tree, or otherwise available? 
(They aren't "my" translation team - but I am as good a contact point as any since I am closely following the discussion of issues and questions) cheers, and thanks for letting me know Charles

As you see it's important to have access to this new documentation as soon as possible. 
To help you, I can take in charge the check-in of a first version in the Amaya CVS base if you send me a zipped file.
