On April 14, forming a team to present at the 8th annual Federal Depository Library Conference sponsored by the U.S. Government Printing Office. 
We will be presenting, "How to design web sites for People With Disabilities" As I get more details, will pass these along. 
Also if you are in the area, you are invited to attend or help us present smile . 
I would prefer to moderate rather than both present and moderate.

ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE Several Universities in Australia, and the Open University in the UK, have been doing a lot of distance learning over many years. 
I don't know if there are representative councils, although the Open Learning Project in Australia may function as such.
