<s> Although it doesn't contain any hard numbers, this is at least a resource you can cite: ROI on Accessibility, Russell Windman eWeek - 7/30/01 http://www.zdnet.com/products/stories/reviews/0,4161,2798040,00.html  </s>
<s> Anecdotally,--Sorry, I know this doesn't much help you--Kynn's house metaphor is perfect: if the layout is clever and the materials good, the building not only lasts but *remains useful* much longer--it's really  </s>
<s> quite  </s>
<s> remarkable the difference.  </s>
<s> Unfortunately, like you mention, lots of homeowners are willing to trade: bigger house for lesser quality.  </s>
<s> Best wishes, Liz  </s>
<s> Adam, you have provided us with some useful insight, although, as was pointed out, this represents the cost of implementing a completely new process.  </s>
<s> The up-front development time and learning curve are undeniably part of the cost, but you can't easily predict the future costs based upon the up-front costs alone.  </s>
<s> In my own development, I have been developing with accessibility in mind  </s>
<s> for  </s>
<s> at least a couple of years now, and it is impossible for me to put a percentage or price tag on the difference between an inaccessible design  </s>
<s> and  </s>
<s> an accessible design, because all of my designs are meant to be  </s>
<s> accessible.  </s>
<s> I don't add on anything to the process at this point, because  </s>
<s> accessibility  </s>
<s> _IS_ my process.  </s>
<s> When a company reaches this point, then there is almost  </s>
<s> no  </s>
<s> point in asking a question like this.  </s>
<s> I would venture a guess (non-scientific, but an educated guess), that a company which always  </s>
<s> designs  </s>
<s> accessibly will likely recover any and all additional development costs by virtue of being able to serve and attract a compensatory number of clients with disabilities.  </s>
<s> A very important point to underscore is that accessibility is not an  </s>
<s> add-on  </s>
<s> to the process.  </s>
<s> You don't design something and then at the end try to determine whether or not is accessible.  </s>
<s> By the time the developers get  </s>
<s> that  </s>
<s> far, it's already too late.  </s>
<s> Accessibility is implemented at every stage of the game.  </s>
<s> If the designers are thinking in terms of accessibility from the beginning, it really  </s>
<s> doesn't  </s>
<s> take "extra" time to tack-on accessibility, because the process is so intertwined with all of the other aspects of design.  </s>
<s> In fact, you're not "tacking on" anything at all.  </s>
<s> You are simply creating the desired result, which (oh, by the way) is accessible.  </s>
<s> That's the shift that has to occur.  </s>
<s> Once it does, then Glenda's question will be a thing of the past.  </s>
<s> It's like asking how much extra does it cost  </s>
<s> a  </s>
<s> company to make things work in both Netscape and Internet Explorer.  </s>
<s> No one asks this question anymore, because everyone knows that they just have to  </s>
<s> do  </s>
<s> it, and it's a part of the process.  </s>

<s> I still think it's important for Fed's to listen instead of comment.  </s>
<s> However, this is what I would do if a web developer told me it was too expensive:  </s>
<s> Ask lots of questions!  </s>
<s> Go into the details: How much will it cost?  </s>
<s> Why do you believe that is too much?  </s>
<s> What specifically are those costs for?  </s>
<s> - itemize labor per page For each item on that list, what is the basis for your cost estimate?  </s>
<s> What alternatives did you consider?  </s>
<s> Then I would start picking on the less expensive items and ask: What if  </s>
<s> you did these things -- would that be too expensive?  </s>
<s> If so, why?  </s>
<s> If they still say doing anything is too expensive, then the web site must  </s>
<s> not be worth much and why are they bothering having one?  </s>
<s> For each reason they come up with for having one, there must be some  </s>
<s> value, and so that value can be enhanced (or diminished) by making the site  </s>
<s> accessible to more (or fewer) people.  </s>
<s> When you challenge the conclusion that the cost is too much, and ask for  </s>
<s> the details, usually one of two things happen:  </s>
<s> You get specific information that you can use to determine YOUR  </s>
<s> alternatives (like, design an accessible web site for $25,000 vs. fix the current one for $50,000); or,  </s>
<s> The designer realizes that you are going to pester them with questions  </s>

<s> Glenda, If you have to repair pages assuming the work was initially done poorly, very inaccessibly, figure .5 hour per page to fix.  </s>
<s> And you put the $ value on those hours.  </s>
<s> It is relatively expensive to correct existing sites.  </s>
<s> Almost all sites have some form of template that most pages are based on  </s>
<s> or  </s>
<s> grow from.  </s>
<s> In the grand scheme of things it costs nothing to get that template correct and then produce pages ad nauseum that are accessible.  </s>
<s> The  </s>
<s> net - costs next to nothing.  </s>
<s> I have often heard a 10% - 15% figure for the cost of accessible stuff  </s>
<s> (web,  </s>
<s> software).  </s>
<s> But I think that is too high.  </s>
<s> Almost all access issues are  </s>
<s> found  </s>
<s> in the templates and when access is fixed there, hundreds/thousands of  </s>
<s> pages  </s>
<s> go by for free.  </s>
<s> So I am going to place a stake in the ground and estimate that generally accessible web is almost negligible.  </s>
<s> If you are producing page at a time  </s>
<s> and  </s>
<s> doing it accessibly it is just not that much work.  </s>
<s> If you are using templates it is even less.  </s>
<s> Think of a complex table.  </s>
<s> Think of how much time goes into planning on how to present that table, and how to code it.  </s>
<s> Then add a bit to have the correct accessibility coding.  </s>
<s> A nit relatively.  </s>
<s> Why don't people say that?  </s>
<s> Do y'all disagree?  </s>
