(I think) Mon 19 Jan is Martin Luther King Day in the US. 
Some people might be on holiday. 
If enough people can't make it, we could cancel the WSTF teleconference (which means we need to get more done this week! 
Please respond: __ I probably would participate in WSTF teleconference on Mon 19 Jan __ I probably would NOT participate in WSTF teleconference on Mon 19 Jan __ Other: _______ X I probably would participate in WSTF teleconference on Mon 19 Jan My school never takes holidays. 
-justin WSTF folks, A couple of people who initially thought they would be able to attend a teleconference on Mon 19 Jan have since sent regrets; therefore, WSTF will NOT meet this coming Monday. 
I sincerely hope you can take time in the next week to complete actions items (I'll e-mail an updated list periodically). 
Additionally, there are several opportunities for EVERYONE on the task force to contribute to work-in-progress: - Justin has the features matrix ready for your additions - Michael will be sending the feedback format to the list for your comments &amp; additions - I will send updates to the Analysis Summary for your comments Our next milestone is to complete the Analysis documentation and ask EOWG &amp; others for final review. 
We're getting really close to the fun part: design! 
Keep up the great work! 
Next meeting is Mon 26 Jan. 
Until then I hope you have a wonderful weekend and a productive week. 
Best, ~ shawn
