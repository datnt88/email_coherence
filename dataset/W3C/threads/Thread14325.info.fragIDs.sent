<s> I still have a strong preferences for maintaing the terminology of WCAG 1, for the following reasons..  </s>
<s> The Guidelines specify general principles of accessibility, in a way that is independent (more or less) of any particular technology.  </s>
<s> The Checkpoints are the actual requirements for accessibility, although still expressed in a way which does not presume a particular technology.  </s>
<s> These can be verified, although doing so requires knowledge of how the requirement may be met by using the technology in question each time.  </s>
<s> The techniques, however, provide specific ways of meeting the requirements for specific technologies.  </s>
<s> As Kynn used to ask, we need to be clear about whether a given technique meets the entirety of the requirement or not in some cases it will others not.  </s>
<s> For example, alt attributes cannot by themselves fulfill the requirements of WCAG 1 checkpoint 1.1 except in a limited, albeit large, set of cases.  </s>
<s> Otherwise we are still at the level of fundamentally approaching this from a particular technology, and then trying to add others as we figure them out.  </s>
<s> The approach outline is the approach taken by ATAG, which when combined with its current dependency on WCAG 1 for a quarter of the requirements means that testing an individual piece of software for conformance is a lot of work.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, it has given us a set of guidelines that is as useful for image and multimedia editing software as it is for HTML software (insofar as the WCAG can be appropriately applied to those areas).  </s>
<s> And it means we don't have to change terminology on people - if we are going to shift the meanings then we should simply use completely different words, and I do not think that is justified.  </s>

<s> I had a look through the checklist for WCAG 1 - the checkpoints were.  </s>
<s> There are 16 priority 1 checkpoints.  </s>
<s> On my first read, I thought that 6.1 and 12.1 are technology specific.  </s>
<s> 5.1 and 5.2 are about labelling tables - really special cases of a general requirement, but not actually technology specific in the same sense.  </s>
<s> At a stretch I could see an argument that 1.2 and 9.1 (dealing with image maps) are technology specific, but I don't buy the argument.  </s>
<s> Leaving at least 10 of 16 checkpoints, by my reckoning, as technology-independent yet verifiable.  </s>
<s> I thought that as I got into the priority 2 checkpoints it would change drastically.  </s>
<s> It changed, but not drastically.  </s>
<s> I think that the problem to be solved is about working out what is a special case, that got elevated to checkpoint or guidelines level because we were thinking about HTML, and what is a general requirement for accessibility.  </s>
<s> Shifting a few of our current checkpoints to techniques for meeting slightly more generally expressed checkpoints would already give us a good basis document (the WCAG 2.0 draft doesn't lose functionality from WCAG 1, and we haven't considered any substantive change in our requirements yet.)
