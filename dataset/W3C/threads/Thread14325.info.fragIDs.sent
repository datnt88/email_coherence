There is a problem of terminology which needs to be resolved. 
In WCAG 1.0 the most abstract and general requirements were called "guidelines". 
The more specific requirements were termed "checkpoints". 
In working group discussions subsequent to the publication of the WCAG 1.0 Recommendation, it was decided to develop a three-layered hierarchy of requirements. 
The first two layers were to be framed in terms that did not invoke the capabilities or limitations of particular, existing standards or technologies. 
The third layer, however, was intended to offer concrete and, so far as possible, readily verifiable implementation requirements, specific to particular standards or technologies (for example, HTML/CSS, XML, SVG, Smil, the DOM etc.). 
In working group deliberations surrounding these proposals, there emerged a tendency to speak of "technology-specific checkpoints". 
This led to a confusion of nomenclature, in that the term "checkpoint" thus became ambiguous, in so far as it could apply either to the second or the third layer of the three-tiered construction outlined above. 
This lack of clarity has been facilitated by the text of WCAG 1.0, in which some of the checkpoints are expressed in relatively general terms, whereas others are quite specific to existing standards and technologies, most notably HTML. 
Accordingly, in WCAG 2.0 it will be necessary to clarify the important concepts around which the requirements are structured and to use terminology in a consistent fashion. 
Inevitably, this will result, to some extent, in a departure from the usage conventions adopted in WCAG 1.0, as there are now three, rather than two, fundamental divisions along the continuum from generality to specificity, from the abstract to the concrete. 
Proposals currently on offer: 1. 
To use the terms "principle", "guideline" and "checkpoint" as defined in the current draft, thereby making an explicit departure from WCAG 1.0. 
2. To use the terms "guideline", "checkpoint" and "technique" to designate the three levels (proposed by Charles). 
This has strong historical roots in the early days of the guidelines. 
However, "techniques" (as in the "techniques document") have since come to be regarded not as numbered, verifiable requirements, but as implementation strategies which are explained and exemplified in the Techniques document. 
Furthermore, given that the technology-specific requirements constitute the level at which (manual or automated) testing is to be performed, it would seem counter-intuitive to regard the second of the three layers (which is not technology-specific) as checkpoints, a term which implies that these are the criteria against which to verify compliance, whereas the more verifiable (testable) requirements are to be called "techniques". 
3. To refer to the three levels, respectively, as "principles", "strategies" and "checkpoints" (proposed by Gregg). 
By designating the second layer as "strategies", it would be implied that not all of these requirements need be fulfilled in order for content to be accessible, but that certain combinations of requirements under each principle need to be met for purposes of compliance. 
Again (as I understand it) the checkpoints, being technology-specific, would provide the basis for testing, with satisfaction of certain combinations of (technology-specific) checkpoints having been deemed to constitute application of the strategies which in turn satisfy the requirements of the principles of accessible design. 
In conclusion, I would argue that none of the terminological options is entirely satisfactory, all involve some departures from past practices, and that precise definitions need to be established so they can be applied consistently in future drafts of WCAG 2.0. 
Note: the foregoing summary is intended to outline the relevant arguments and not to indicate any preference, on my part, for one solution over another. 
Specifically, I think they all have advantages and drawbacks, but that a clear decision needs to be made by the working group. 
I still have a strong preferences for maintaing the terminology of WCAG 1, for the following reasons.. 
The Guidelines specify general principles of accessibility, in a way that is independent (more or less) of any particular technology. 
The Checkpoints are the actual requirements for accessibility, although still expressed in a way which does not presume a particular technology. 
These can be verified, although doing so requires knowledge of how the requirement may be met by using the technology in question each time. 
The techniques, however, provide specific ways of meeting the requirements for specific technologies. 
As Kynn used to ask, we need to be clear about whether a given technique meets the entirety of the requirement or not in some cases it will others not. 
For example, alt attributes cannot by themselves fulfill the requirements of WCAG 1 checkpoint 1.1 except in a limited, albeit large, set of cases. 
Otherwise we are still at the level of fundamentally approaching this from a particular technology, and then trying to add others as we figure them out. 
The approach outline is the approach taken by ATAG, which when combined with its current dependency on WCAG 1 for a quarter of the requirements means that testing an individual piece of software for conformance is a lot of work. 
On the other hand, it has given us a set of guidelines that is as useful for image and multimedia editing software as it is for HTML software (insofar as the WCAG can be appropriately applied to those areas). 
And it means we don't have to change terminology on people - if we are going to shift the meanings then we should simply use completely different words, and I do not think that is justified.

JW:: "...all involve some departures from past practices..." WL: Good! 
That's the point. 
Or at least a point. 
The previous manifestations of the document lacked a layer that was sufficiently general and abstract. 
The new one has such a layer. 
It doesn't matter what they are called. 
The top layer (called "principles" so far) is not only not technology-specific it might not even refer exclusively to the Web. 
We need this and we're very close to it already. 
Love. 
ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE 
In the disussions where we created the structure of WCAG 1, we decided that we want ed abstract guidelines which were statements of principle, and more specific checkpoints, which were verifiable but independent of particular technologies. 
The idea was good, the first implementation could be improved. 
In the second one we have done a better job of shifting the tings that are abstract into the top layer, and the things that are verifiable into the second, and shifting things that are technology specific into the third. 
(Think about checkpoints in WCAG 1 like 1.1 - they are not based on a particular technology, are verifiable, and it is helpful to have techniques for them in specific technologies and situations.

What I am arguing is that the meanings have already shifted and that we need to make the best of the new situation. 
Checkpoints used to be (in WCAG 1.0) largely, but not entirely technology-specific; the Techniques were merely explanations and examples of the checkpoints in many, though not all, cases. 
Recent discourse within the working group has reflected the ambiguity by referring to "technology-specific" checkpoints". 
We need to clarify the terminology, either by using "checkpoint" to mean a technology-specific requirement, or a general strategy of accessible design which, though not at the most abstract level, is stated at a level of specificity that allows concrete implementation strategies to follow from it. 
I had a look through the checklist for WCAG 1 - the checkpoints were. 
There are 16 priority 1 checkpoints. 
On my first read, I thought that 6.1 and 12.1 are technology specific. 
5.1 and 5.2 are about labelling tables - really special cases of a general requirement, but not actually technology specific in the same sense. 
At a stretch I could see an argument that 1.2 and 9.1 (dealing with image maps) are technology specific, but I don't buy the argument. 
Leaving at least 10 of 16 checkpoints, by my reckoning, as technology-independent yet verifiable. 
I thought that as I got into the priority 2 checkpoints it would change drastically. 
It changed, but not drastically. 
I think that the problem to be solved is about working out what is a special case, that got elevated to checkpoint or guidelines level because we were thinking about HTML, and what is a general requirement for accessibility. 
Shifting a few of our current checkpoints to techniques for meeting slightly more generally expressed checkpoints would already give us a good basis document (the WCAG 2.0 draft doesn't lose functionality from WCAG 1, and we haven't considered any substantive change in our requirements yet.)

I sound like I'm dead or something, Chaalz. 
:) Hi everyone, by the way -- I had somehow lost my subscription, but I'm back now and hope to start participating again. 
In my experience the biggest disconnect when dealing with WCAG is what we're talking about now -- how to make it understandable what -exactly- is meant, and what people -must- do. 
Because the WCAG has been and will continue to be adopted as a legal or policy requirement, we need to present a form of our guidelines that does fill that need for "checkability" and "do-this"-ness. 
Otherwise the confusion will just continue to increase. 
(PS: Thanks for the kind words about the SUNY presentation. 
If I get some more time in the near future -- which is a faraway hope, yes -- I hope to increase the usefulness of that particular presentation with examples and graphical content.) --Kynn Kynn Bartlett kynn@idyllmtn.com http://kynn.com/
