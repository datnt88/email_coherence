<s> In the last draft [1], I had minimal canonicalization doing three things: * normalizing the character encoding to UTF-8, removing the encoding pseudo-attribute * normalizing line endings * normalizing white space I wasn't certain about the last item (white space normalization), and I'm happy to see it dropped as per the teleconference.  </s>
<s> The controversial item was removing the encoding pseudo-attribute.  </s>
<s> Normalizing to UTF-8 is not useful if we keep a reference to the original encoding (this is exactly what Don says in his last point below).  </s>
<s> Isn't the whole point of canonicalization to allow changes that don't affect the meaning?  </s>
<s> Selecting minimal canonicalization means that as far as the application is concerned the character encoding doesn't matter.  </s>
<s> I think part of the resistance to this is that it makes the minimal canonicalization slightly XML aware.  </s>
<s> But how will the minimal canonicalization determine the character encoding to convert from if the resource isn't XML?  </s>
<s> An arbitrary text resource may have no indication of how it is encoded.  </s>
<s> Basically, I think we MUST remove the encoding pseudo-attribute if the UTF-8 conversion is to be useful.  </s>

<s> From an implementors point of view, I see a difference between rules convenient for parsed XML (such as the signature itself and any embedded objects) and referenced external objects (which may be of any type -- and may not be well formed even if they are XML).  </s>
<s> For the signature and any embedded objects, which even a minimal application must parse in order to verify the signature, it seems most convenient to use the same normalizations required of XML processors: * [1] 2.11 says to normalize line endings to 0xA.  </s>
<s> * [1] 2.10 says to "pass all characters in a document that are not markup".  </s>
<s> I don't think that includes non-significant whitespace inside start/end tags, but I'm not fluent enough in SGML lingo to be sure.  </s>
<s> This would allow an implementation to easily work with parsed data.  </s>
<s> I would also throw in normalization to UTF-8, and removal of the encoding  </s>
<s> pseudo-attribute, since it makes it much easier to pass strings around in existing code that is expecting ASCII (but I realize that is a biased viewpoint).  </s>
<s> For external objects, even if they are XML, it seems most convenient to use something like the S/MIME rules:  </s>
<s> * Normalize line endings for text/* content to 0xA and treat everything else as binary data.  </s>
<s> This avoids the need to parse any external XML content that is being signed, unless some transformation is specified.  </s>

<s> (The proposal was to normalize white space between a close angle bracket and a following open angle bracket, where they are separate only by white space.  </s>
<s> Thus it would have not actually required XML knowledge or parsing but could be based just on simple character sequence.)  </s>
<s> I prefaced my previous remarks with a statement that you could go either way on this question.  </s>
<s> In addition to my previous arguments, I would point out that you are assuming that all changes in the encoding of characters are XML aware.  </s>
<s> Depending on the channels and storage XML signed data goes through, it might already be in an encoding different from the prolog attribute if the prolog attribute is even present.  </s>
<s> Many things signed will not be XML documents, either because they are binary data or because they are just a hunk of XML rather than a well formed document.  </s>
<s> I think that the encoding will have to be supplied as a parameter with the data in the general case.  </s>
<s> Transformation canonicalizations are steps in a pipline.  </s>
<s> The way to look at this is what do you get from the previous stage and hand to the next stage?  </s>
<s> Seems to me that it must be an octet string and an encoding.  </s>
<s> Otherwise, encoding transformations would have a hard time telling what to do.  </s>
<s> So minimal canonicalization, whether its the first, a middle, or the last Transmformation, could expect to by handed a string of bytes and the encoding they are in.  </s>
<s> Thus it is a substantial complexity and additional work for it to parse the material which might not even be balance or XML.  </s>
<s> By ignoring the possible presence of an encoding psuedo-attribute, you get a much simpler canonicalization (that happens to be quite useful for text also).  </s>
<s> It's true that leaving it in means that under some circumstances people will have to explictly ignore it or perhaps even the entire prolog if that is what they want.  </s>
<s> Of course, there is no additional effort to do this for a particular signed item if they are already extracting / filtering-to what they are signing or not dealing with a full document so there is no prolog anyway.  </s>
<s> If they are signing a form, wouldn't it be a common case to ignore all preceeding and following comments and the prolog, for example?  </s>
