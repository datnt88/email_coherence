Subject: Fwd: Web Design Accessibility is Cool Sender: owner-hwg-business@hwg.org Speaking of accessibility, I thought I'd pass on the URL to an article I was told about on another list: The article is written with the web designer in mind, and has examples of good looking sites that are also accessible. 
There's a link to the BOBBY site, which (if you don't know) is a great way to check your site automagically for accessibility issues.

Actually the way to do this in HTML is to use the OBJECT element, with a cascade that allows you to put something more useful than a simpe alt element. 
In fact a SMIL presentation is probably more accessible than flash - there are several players, including open-source stuff and the Real Networks G2 player. 
But you can put that into an object cascade along with the flash version, a quicktime movie (there are circumstances where that is a good alternative) and a number of other versions... Charles McCN i was thinking another way to make Macromedia Flash Accessible for those who do not want to download the software. 
Seems there is a way to make an image display if you do not have the plug-in. 
Of course, if you have an image then we can have an ALT tag, where we can describe the visual presentation.
