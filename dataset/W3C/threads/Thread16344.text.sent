Can anyone offer a reasonable explanation as to why readers can't be engineered to accommodate some of the more fashionable trends, e.g., frames, table formats, interactive forms, etc. ? 
actually, the newer ones are but our problem is that not only readers as you say but older browsers are also effected by the newer html constructs.

---sig off--- The basic reason is that it is difficult to impossible to write an algorithm that can deduce the meaning of these items from their visual appearance. 
Also, many times the screen reader doesn't have access to information about the structure of what is presented on the screen. 
For example, frames. 
As a sighted person, I cannot tell (by just looking at the screen) whether a web site uses frames or not. 
I can try to figure that out by, say, tabbing through (if my browser supports that - many don't). 
Or I could look at the source for the page. 
But screen readers don't have access to the source for the page - just the visual look of the page, and perhaps some GUI specific things like if there are multiple HWND's (in MS Windows). 
This is the kind of problem that Microsoft's Active Accessibility was supposed to solve - provide a way for screen readers to get information from an application. 
As someone who worked on that technology, I will be among the first to say that MSAA isn't a complete solution - there is a long way to go. 
But when you have two applications that support MSAA, it can go a long way to relieving some of these problems. 
Of course, when it comes to web pages, it also requires some assistance from the web page authors. 
MSAA in IE 5 will expose the alt text of an image to a screen reader that uses MSAA to extract that information, but the alt text must still be there, for example. 
Ditto for forms. 
When you look at a web form, you can usually tell which field labels go with which fields - but you do this by looking at lots of information - relative proximity, any repetitive features, etc. HTML4 allows an author to specify "this label labels this field" and I think that IE5 exposes that through MSAA, but again the web page author must put that information in.

Can anyone describe a "universal" one approach that solves all accessibility problems? 
If not, can spokespersons for each type of disability (vision, cognitive, physical, etc.) offer an opinion as to the precise solution that would be an acceptable accommodation for everyone with their specific disability? 
I would like to hear comments about accessibility issues related to using Windows, Macintosh, and other operating systems. 
What feedback can you provide about the browser you use? 
What positive and negative features of your browser relates to your personal access issues? 
What specific hardware and software have you used? 
What specific positive and negative issues have you encountered? 
I would like to take this information and request our local association of community colleges to consider developing a course that addresses access issues in terms of web design with the goal of launching a web site in cooperation with the County Board of Education. 
Your assistance would be appreciated. 
Claude Sweet Educational Technologist Mike, readers can be (and are) amde for many features. 
In most cases they rely on decent structure being present in the page they are trying to render, which is a constant problem. 
Another problem is to get such tools deployed. 
The User Agent Guidelines Working Group and the Evaluation and Repair Tools Working Group deal extensivley with how to read what is out there, and The Authoring Tool Guidelines Working Group deals with the question of how to get the tools that are used to put content out there to make sure that it is the sort of structured, valid content that is necessary for such readers to work.

W3C Web Accessibility Initiative http://www.w3.org/WAI MIT/LCS - 545 Technology sq., Cambridge MA, 02139, USA Claude, this more or less describes what the Web Content Guidelines Working Group does. 
I would suggest loking at the guidelines that group has produced, and the furether work that they are looking at doing. 
In addition, the Education and Outreach group has worked on some alternative presentations of the guidelines - the quicktips card is one, and there are a set of slides which are designed to teach people how to apply the web content guidelines to writing web pages.

W3C Web Accessibility Initiative http://www.w3.org/WAI MIT/LCS - 545 Technology sq., Cambridge MA, 02139, USA In many cases, a modern reader -can- accommodate the fashionable trends in web design -- assuming that the web designer has given the screenreader or voice browser enough information to accurately represent the page. 
Some ways of expressing information are very graphical -- frames are a visual metaphor based on 'physical' location on a screen, for example. 
These are fine to use as long as you realize the limits of the method, and provide adequate compensation for those limitations.

If I could, I would patent it and become amazingly rich. 
:) There are no approaches that can provide universal access for everyone under all conditions; all we can do is maximize the accessibility for as broad and comprehensive of an audience as we can. 
It is definitely useful to examine the needs of specific audience groups and see if there are techniques that can be used cross- disability in order to improve overall access; for example, being screenreader-friendly means benefits for both visually impaired users who can't see, and cognitivitely impaired users who can't read. 
It doesn't solve ALL problems, naturally -- there is no magic bullet -- but it's definitely a step forward so fits my personal definition of "improved accessibility." 
Was this what you were asking about or am I being dense again?
