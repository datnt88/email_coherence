Meeting 97/04/01 [printing deadlines for the WWW6 conference are creating 
severe time pressures] the ERB voted as follows: 
Add sections 6.1-6.17 
(draft forthcoming) enabling the use of the CONCUR feature in XML. 
Yes: Bray, Bosak, Clark, Maler, Sperberg-McQueen, Sharpe, Paoli, Magliery, DeRose, Hollander No: Kimber -Tim 
Earth to ERB: come in please, we seem to have accepted a garbled transmission. 
Joe Homepage needs concur. 
I thought that, in the interests of time and the WWW conference, the implicit agreement was that no BIG things, like PUBLIC, should be changed at this time. 
Seriously, is this haste wise? 
Is this major expansion of scope approriate? 
KISS.

This is a test right? 
You know, like the teacher who throws out an utterly ridiculous comment to see who is listening. 
Okay, I wasn't sleeping. 
I've been quiet, but I didn't miss the absurdity of this one.

Can you possibly imagine a proposal passing with only 1 dissenting vote? 
Best part of the joke: it was Eliot dissenting.

It wasn't the date or the one dissenting vote that gave it away. 
It was the fact that Eliot was the one who was dissenting.

It was the identity of the dissenter that was so funny :-) ///Peter
