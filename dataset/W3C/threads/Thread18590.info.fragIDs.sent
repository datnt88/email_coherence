<s> Thanks Gregg for both notes.  </s>
<s> I'm linking them from the WAI action items page.  </s>
<s> I have concern over strategy #2 being the prefered strategy.  </s>
<s> Strategy #2 is the most elegant from a programming standpoint.  </s>
<s> My main concern with #2 is visibility of the text description, which I beleive is important for people to know it's there.  </s>
<s> Especially for non-disabled peers not familiar with disability access options helping a person with a disability to learn to use a browser.  </s>
<s> Strategy #1 is the most visible to people.  </s>
<s> Strategy #2 is going to be highly dependent on browser implementation and I don't know how consistent browser developers will be in rendering the ALTSRC information or easy it will be to configure it to render ALTSRC information, since it will be a little used function by the general public (just try turning off images in Netscape 4.01, if you know how let me know).  </s>
<s> I have the opposite reaction: I prefer #2 (ALTSRC attrib) over #1 (D-LINK markup) because is it less invasive for non-disabled persons.  </s>
<s> The most important thing IMHO is get the LongDesc link into the HTML source.  </s>
<s> Anything that might slow down acceptation of this feature by Web authors should be avoided and having little D appearing all over the pages is not going to help us.  </s>
<s> How is it exploited by the client side is less important once the data is there and the lack of UI consistency can be reduced using Browser guidelines.  </s>
<s> In any case I think this is where competition might be useful and healthy.  </s>
<s> This discussion has raised the issue of the relationship between the proposed ALTSRC attribute and user interface considerations.  </s>
<s> It may be necessary to modify CSS syntax, if the ALTSRC idea is accepted, to enable this attribute to act as a selector.  </s>
<s> Such modification could be made to CSS syntax as a whole, or it could be a special feature that is available to ACSS styles only.  </s>
<s> If long descriptions are implemented by means of the OBJECT element as exemplified in one of my earlier contributions to this discussion, then clearly the existing CSS syntax would enable anchors with OBJECT elements in their ancestry to be selected.  </s>
<s> This possibility is particularly valuable when using ACSS, since it would allow anchors referring to long descriptions to be spoken in a different voice or indicated with an appropriate audio cue.  </s>
<s> Perhaps a link type for long descriptions needs to be defined so that anchors which relate to long descriptions can be properly differentiated from other anchors that might appear within OBJECT elements.  </s>
<s> (rel="longdesc")?  </s>
<s> Obviously, it would be important to have corresponding functionality with respect to the ALTSRC proposal, hence the foregoing suggestion to modify CSS or ACSS syntax.  </s>
<s> I don't think I am arguing against #2.  </s>
<s> It seems to be a reasonable approach to solving the general way to get alternative descriptions.  </s>
<s> I have 2 concerns: 1. #1 can be done now and can work with any browser  </s>
<s> 2. #2 could easily become an invisible accessibility feature if know one knows the information is there, since standard browser rendering would not include the ALTREF information.  </s>
<s> Most people with disabilities will also only know the ALTREF information is there if their non-disabled peers know it's there, since most don't have access to people with specialized disability access knowledge.  </s>
<s> Non-disabled peers will probably only know it is there if there is some visual presentation or highly visible information in a help file.  </s>
<s> But you can also say this of #1, since 99.999% of WWW authors don't even know about it.  </s>
<s> I think the key issue is how best to coax authors into adding the description information (development tools) and how users will know it's available (browser rendering).  </s>
<s> Since there is no clear benefit to this information for non-disabled persons (except people using low speed modems) I don't think browser developers will devote alot of creative resources to this project.  </s>
<s> I would argue it would be better to have a consistancy between browsers (guidelines and example) of how to do it.  </s>
<s> So if a person with a disability upgrades their browser or uses an unfamilar browser they could use their previous experience to access the ALTREF information (if available).  </s>

<s> It is precisely such lack of knowledge which the education and awareness component of the WAI will be intended to address.  </s>
<s> I agree with Daniel that the D-link solution would probably be regarded by authors as too invasive and as detracting from the aesthetic, presentational aspects of their documents.  </s>
<s> I therefore would not support it, except perhaps as a short term measure.  </s>
<s> Furthermore, it has been assumed in this discussion that the user is accessing the web via a visually-oriented browser and a screen reader.  </s>
<s> This assumption, though almost universally true today, is contrary to the direction in which web standards and technologies in general are developing.  </s>
<s> Browsers equipped with "audio formatting" or "braille formatting" software, which not only have access to the structural information provided by the HTML markup but are also guided by audio and braille style sheets, are likely to become the predominant means of accessing the web for those who require output in these media.  </s>
<s> This does not necessarily entail the use by people with disabilities of specialised, custom-designed web clients.  </s>
<s> I understand for example that the Document Object Model may provide a mechanism by which an audio or braille formatting system can acquire high-level content such as markup and style sheet information from a web browser.  </s>
<s> I am firmly of the opinion that "audio formatting" (a concept developed by T.V. Raman in his outstanding research into this subject) is far superior to the conventional concept of a screen reader, and it is toward such a solution that much of the WAI effort is directed, particularly in the development of ACSS, braille style sheets and many of the features that have been incorporated into the HTML 4.0 draft for the benefit of people with disabilities.  </s>
<s> The ALTSRC proposal is another such mechanism, which is primarily intended for use by web clients that are responsive to the user's access needs and which can thus generate an appropriate audio or braille presentation.  </s>
<s> Some comments.  </s>
<s> First, in the next release of CSS, CSS2, codename Frosting, ACSS becomes part of CSS, and is no longer a separate spec (printing and positioning too).  </s>
<s> Second, generic access to HTML attribute values from CSS (whether it's ALT or ALTSRC) is scheduled for CSS2, and our WAI role here is to make sure it stays in when the dropping features season opens.  </s>
<s> Third, I was told that ALTSRC was not a good name, it's (or something too close like X-ALTSRC) already used by Netscape and/or AOL as a way to indicate alternate graphic format.  </s>
<s> I propose to use instead something like LONGDESC as the attribute name.  </s>
<s> Another reason why ALTSRC should be regarded as an inappropriate name for the proposed attribute is that it might be regarded by some authors as a substitute for the ALT attribute.  </s>
<s> What I am here suggesting is that, at least in cases where the IMG element does not appear as the content of an anchor and a long description is deemed appropriate, it would be necessary to include both an ALT attribute and a link to the long description.  </s>
<s> Some people might therefore be confused by the need to include both ALT and ALTSRC.  </s>
<s> LONGDESC would be a better name.  </s>
