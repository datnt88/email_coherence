aloha, wendy, gregg, and ian -- i presume! 
been trying to get to http://www.browsercaps.com/ 
all day with a variety of browsers from a variety of dailups, but consistently receive a "Unable to contact remote host" error... will continue to attempt to get to browsercaps.com, but thought that you'd want to know that (at least right now) there is a problem with the server on which it is hosted... probably a temporary glitch, but worth checking out if you have a contact eddress for someone at browsercaps.com gregory.

Hello Gregory, It appears that browsercaps went defunct sometime this summer. 
It has been out of service for a while now, and I'm assuming it probably won't be back. 
In the meantime, we've been using data from the htmlcompendium (i believe the URL is htmlcompendium.org). 
It is not complete. 
The difference between the two is that browsercaps had a wider selection of browsers, but the compendium has a more complete listing of elements that are supported (both HTML and CSS). 
We'll update the links where we are able and put it in errata where we can't. 
Ian - should we keep a place holder for browser caps in hopes that it will come back or comment it out until/if it does return? 
--w wendy chisholm human factors engineer trace research and development center university of wisconsin - madison, USA I don't think so. 
People will be able to find the reference from the previous version of the techniques, but if it's dead, let's not send people there. 
- Ian I have commented out the reference to browsercaps in techreferences.src. 
I haven't added a link to htmlcompendium, yet. 
i think this might be better to link to from browser support page? 
--w Sounds reasonable. 
- Ian Actually, you shouldn't leave it in comments. 
You should just delete it. 
We have the CVS archives for previous versions. 
Make sure to log the deletion.
