<s> Howdy, Supposing (yet not to assume) you intend to use these in an accessible html document, ALT tags, D-Links and text-link alternatives will spare confusion as to what the symbols mean in the context of your document.  </s>

<s> A bit of a dichotomy I think Thinking about this a bit I can see an advantage to haing a standard set of Universal Symbols.  </s>

<s> Signed English (not ALS) is the closest method to universal symbolism I can think of.  </s>
<s> Signed English is taught to Down's Syndrome children from day one to help them communicate what they cannot speak.  </s>
<s> They become rather adept at it - it is amazing.  </s>
<s> But note - I have often seen the kids make up their own Signs for objects or actions they do not know the proper Sign for.  </s>
<s> Usually very creative, but like playing charades.  </s>
<s> Signed English and ASL also varies from region to region.  </s>
<s> I am sure not many people outside Texas know the Sign for "Chicken Fried Steak".  </s>
<s> And I would not know many signs used in other English speaking countries (ie; Australia).  </s>
<s> Yet, very basic Sign Language is universal.  </s>
<s> Replicating Signs as graphic images on the web is another thing because most signs require motion.  </s>
<s> Symbol Cards representing basic activities such as eating and toileting are also used and they prove to be very effective - placing them in a sequence to form a sentence, etc.  </s>
<s> But these too have thier flaws.  </s>
<s> ie; we have never owned an electric can opener - so, when our child was presented with a picture of one he said it was a radio.  </s>

<s> I have to disagree on this:  </s>
<s> There is no such thing as universal sign language.  </s>
<s> Each community's sign language is a naturally formed language with it's own phonology, morphology, and syntax.  </s>
<s> If a Deaf American and a Deaf German meet on the street, they *won't* understand each other.  </s>
<s> What they *will* be better at is a mutual gesturing.  </s>
<s> Since they both use language through a visual medium, they're more receptive to communicating physically.  </s>
<s> I realize this is off-topic, but I gotta use my MA in ASL Linguistics *somewhere*!  </s>

<s> Just a quick note to agree with Jessica Chaiken, working as a British Sign Language (BSL) interpreter, variation of Sign Language occurs within the UK, as well as internationally.  </s>
<s> With regard to;  </s>
<s> This 'signed english' does not represent BSL but rather a signed language in its own right, probably a signed system called Makaton.  </s>
<s> Lastly, within the UK there is also Signed Supported English (SSE) which varies from the phonology, morphology, and syntax in BSL.  </s>
<s> This may seem off topic but the understanding of the difference phonology etc, in Signed Languages is important for Deaf people's access to information.  </s>
