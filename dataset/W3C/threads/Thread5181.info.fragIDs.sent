I'm going to use QNames to abbreviate URIs. 
Assume each prefix univocally expands to a distinct namespace URI. 
Sally the ontologist defines some terms, including sally:Person which is, in her ontology, exclusively the unionOf wordnet:woman and wordnet:man. 
And suppose further, sally:RightsHolder is a subClassOf sally:Person. 
Now, it's not even exactly clear that Sally is using the two wordnet terms correctly, but grant that she is. 
People use Sally's term all over the place. 
It's adopted by that powerful vocabulary juggernaut, FOAF, and thus becomes the *de facto* standard for talking about persons. 
Now Molly comes along and notes the extreme chauvinism of Sally's definition, excluding as it does (arguably) eunuchs, hermaphrodites, intelligent programs, chimps, augmented chimps, Martians and the like. 
Molly proposes an alternative ontology for sally:Person. 
Now, if I understand the view as raised by tim in his issuing, Molly and the Foafsters are pretty much stuck. 
sally:Person just *means* whatever Sally wants it to mean. 
More interestingly, suppose Sally had just been a bit careless and really was aiming at a more expansive notion of Person, just blew it. 
However, before Molly detected the problem, Sally sold her now very popular domain to People for a Very Narrow Sense of People in Foaf Documents (PVNSPFD). 
They refuse to change sally:Person. 
Now, what concept does sally:Person identify? 
When? 
Does it matter? 
Is there anything Wrong with Molly (or *Sally*) putting out an alternative ontology, and the Foaf x.x ontology switch its owl:imports statement to point to the alt-ontology instead of the (now owned by) PVNSPFD one. 
Cheers, Bijan Parsia. 
I'm only going to pick on one thing: "The entire world has to allow the owner of a URI to say what its referent is supposed to be" This seems propose a theory of meaning based on an unspecified act ('say') by an unidentified party ('the owner') at an unidentified time. 
Most URIs don't have 'owners', and owners have no way to 'say' nor do receivers of communications containing URIs have any way to determine what the owner might have said, and not superceded. 
If you change 'owner' to 'utterer' you come up with a not very useful theory: When party A sends a communication containing a uri U to party B, then U means exactly what A says it means, nothing more or less.

I remember that when I first learned that I would someday receive a "Doctor of philosophy" degree (instead of Dr. of Science) I was quite disappointed. 
However, I then learned that pragmatism was a legitimate branch of philosophy and having read Dewey and a few other folks like that [*] I decided I could live with ... SUMMARY: I bring this up because in my simple, and somewhat pragmatic world view, the current discussion makes me uncomfortable - it borders on "aesthetic" rather than practical -- what I'd really like to see is if we could expose a couple of "test cases" where it makes a difference. 
DETAILS: Let me try this: 
I see URIs as a nearly infinitely large addressable memory - we have a naming convention to avoid simply numbering the spaces -- i.e. "Web memory location 33290948209842398" we then have bits that live inside these memory locations. 
Stating the obvious, it seems to me the goal of this group is to say something about the ownership of these memory addresses and the relation of that to what is contained in the locations. 
So Mary's person and Sally's person are different boxes -- the fact that Mary says in her box that Sally is wrong in hers seems to me to be a difficult issue in the aesthetic world of words and meanings, but not in the pragmatic world of boxes and their contents -- as long as my machine can tell me whether I'm looking in Mary's memory location or Sally's, then I can tell who is doing the asserting. 
If Mary asserts something about Sally who asserts something about Bijan who asserts something about Pat, etc -- I don't have a problem. 
Seems to me the issue of what is in the boxes is different -- in my naive way I read the TAG issue as "Is the owner of a box responsible for what it says in that box" (and what if that points at another box) 
I guess in my stupidly naive way, I don't see why this is drastically different than if on my Web Page I claim (in words) Bijan is my employee and on his Web Page he claims (in words) that he is my underpaid slave. 
We each are able to state our intended meanings, someone pointing to my page can tell the difference from if they are pointing to Bijan's page, and those referring to things on the pages have to be careful they point at the right place. 
I can steal content from Bijan's page, I can cut and paste from Bijan's page, the one thing I cannot do is "coopt" Bijan's page in any way that will fool your software. 
(I admit that I could fire Bijan, keep the URI he has, and change what it says - but that seems to me to be an extreme case and one way beyond the call of our software to handle. 
(It seems to me some of Bijan's intution pump is based on a scenario more like this one, which is why I mention it)) 
Anyway, my problem is that given my simple world view, I cannot find any interesting examples where Tim's solution would make smart people like Bijan and Peter so upset, yet it clearly does, which is why I ask for examples that can help a simpleton like me understand what the pragmatic effects are 
-JH p.s. So I guess there are two ways to convince me - get me to change my simple worldview, which many of you can testify is hard :- , or show me an example of a hard problem that I can understand from my naive stance - a much easier task :- [*] but I never liked Pierce :- Professor James Hendler hendler@cs.umd.edu

[snip] 
While coherent, it seems completely at odds with prevailing TAG and sw-meaning curretns, to wit, that URIs are names with referents that could be anything. 
Or is this just an analogy? 
I thought my case was trying to illustrate eminently practical question: MUST I import the freshest copy I can get of the URI owners ontology of every URI I use in a document. 
Weaken it further, SHOULD I? Weaken it further, IT'S IN SOME SENSE A DARN TOOTIN GOOD IDEA (I have no idea what RFC that one comes from :)) to do so. 
[snip] 
Acutally, it isn't *based* on such a senario. 
That's just a further development. 
The core scenario is of a case where someone wants to use someone else's URI in there own document with their own definition. 
Actually, I'm just trying to 1) interpret, 2) reject something I see implied by the following language from http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-tag/2003Jul/0022.html : """- that use of a URI in RDF implies a commitment to its ontology, and if there is doubt as to what ontology that is, the web may be used to resolve it. 
- that the web is not the final arbiter of meaning, because URI ownership is primary, and the lookup system of HTTP is though important secondary. 
(That is, if you hack a web server's ontology files, you do not change hat the URI means, you just break a machine for a while)""" To wit, that there's some strong claim on me (to try to import the freshest version of an ontology of the URIs I use). 
Note that it's a bit *more* general than that "I must try to hit the server" issue. 
I want to know what *commitment to its ontology* MEANS. 
What must I do? 
At the moment, I have no other axe to grind. 
At the moment, I don't CARE what *other* meaning there might be floating about these URIs. 
If I *have* to import that ontology, andI can't sensibly "override" it even when it's crystal clear what I'm doing, then we have a very very strong cost for using anyone elses URIs. 
I *suspect* that the restriction to properties is designed to try to reduce the cost a bit, but I don't see that working. 
I'll put this last bit in a separate message so we can have a clean thread. 
Cheers, Bijan Parsia.
