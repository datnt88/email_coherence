we currently have 2.3.4: 
[Priority?1] 
The tool must recognize accessibility markup for any language or format that it imports or converts. 
2.3.5: 
[Priority?1] 
Never remove markup supported by the tool that is known to promote accessibility I think these are both dealing with the same thing - preserving accessibility features during format, language, or structural transformations (For example turning a table into a set of lists, or vice versa. 
I propose that these two checkpoints be merged into a single one which says "Preserve all accessibility features in content which is converted or transformed into a different language, format, or structure". 
Priority 1 I think this checkpoint actually belongs under guideline 2.4 The fact that a tool needs to recognise these features in a markup language or format the it can import seems to be sufficiently obvious from this checkpoint - otherwise we should retain 2.3.4.

I definitely support combing the two checkpoints, and offer a proposed rewording to clarify a couple issues. 
How about: Preserve accessible content during conversions or transformations. 
The issue that I am trying to clarify is that a tool might make transformations either while importing or exporting. 
I interpretted Charles' proposal to only address exports. 
I'm not sure that my proposal makes it any more clear. 
I deleted the explicit mention of types of conversions/transformations to leave it open to all types. 
I don't feel strongly about leaving them out.

I like this wording. 
I would still be inclined to say "accessibility features of content" (as per Eric's suggestion).
