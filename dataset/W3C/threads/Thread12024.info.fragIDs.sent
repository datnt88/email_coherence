<s> The tool must recognize accessibility markup for any language or format that it imports or converts.  </s>
<s> 2.3.5:  </s>
<s> [Priority?1]  </s>
<s> Never remove markup supported by the tool that is known to promote accessibility I think these are both dealing with the same thing - preserving accessibility features during format, language, or structural transformations (For example turning a table into a set of lists, or vice versa.  </s>
<s> I propose that these two checkpoints be merged into a single one which says "Preserve all accessibility features in content which is converted or transformed into a different language, format, or structure".  </s>
<s> Priority 1 I think this checkpoint actually belongs under guideline 2.4 The fact that a tool needs to recognise these features in a markup language or format the it can import seems to be sufficiently obvious from this checkpoint - otherwise we should retain 2.3.4.  </s>

<s> The issue that I am trying to clarify is that a tool might make transformations either while importing or exporting.  </s>

<s> I would still be inclined to say "accessibility features of content" (as per Eric's suggestion).  </s>
