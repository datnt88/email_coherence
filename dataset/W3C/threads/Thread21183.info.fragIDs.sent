<s> Is what you are proposing an accessibility feature, analogous to the use a ruler or bookmark to keep track of the current line of text that the eye is scanning on a printed page?  </s>
<s> Or have I misunderstood and are you proposing an editing feature?  </s>
<s> In the case of an accessibility feature, I presume the line would be dragged by the mouse and stay in its last set position.  </s>
<s> The line therefore would need some kind of "handle" one could click on to reposition it.  </s>

<s> Not only a "red" line, but you can add as many as you need: each new one comes up in a different color, underlines the whole line across, and they are numbered sequentially; you'd probably have only 3 or 4 at any given time...drag one off the page, and it disappears.  </s>
