I read the Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines and the accompanying documents. 
I guess you did a great work. 
There is only one point which embarrassed the Amaya team. 
It's the fact that the ATAG refuses to consider an authoring tool which generates accessible information but it's not itself accesible. 
You can easily understand that the conformity will be harder to obtain for a WYSIWYG authoring tool than a simple converter. 
After a long internal discussion, the Amaya team finally agreed with that position, considering that a WYSIWYG authoring tool should be compliant with the User Agent Accessibility Guidelines too. 
The Amaya team will follow authoring tool accessibility guidelines. 
Our plan is to process step by step because we don't have the manpower to work at the same time on the user interface, XML, CSS, I18N, HTTP and accessibility. 
If there is a very very urgent thing that we have to introduce in the next November Amaya release, please let we know.

Being able to activate a link via the keyboard is pretty urgent, and making sure there is a focus in each window (that doesn't disappear). 
If it is easy, exposing the home and stop buttons for the keyboard would be good too.

aloha, irene! 
thank you for your comments on the AUGL... as you and the amaya team finally resolved, accessibility is a two-way street -- to have produced guidelines that did not address the accessibility of the tool being used to create accessible content would have been tantamount to telling those users, such as myself, who is blind, and judy, who cannot use the mouse, that it is sufficient to have accessible content created for us, but that it isn't important to endow us with our inalienable right to create that content for ourselves and for others... but enough with pilosophy (or is it sophistry?) the most urgent need is for a viable keyboard interface with which to interact with amaya... since i can't tab from link to link i can't test out hyperlinks, nor can i test navigation controls, such as ACCESSKEY and TABINDEX... so, i'm sorry to report that, at least from my perspective (or, rather, lack thereof), the most urgent things which need to be introduced into the November release are user interface enhancements -- to wit, (at least a modicum of) keyboard support, plus the introduction of a system caret / cursor that ensures that each window amaya opens is focusable... these enhancements would allow users such as judy and myself and countless others to actually use the authoring tool being developed and promulgated by the organization for whom we have been involved/working in drafting these guidelines... thanks again for your feedback, and for your willingness to work with us, gregory.

This discussion should really go on in www-amaya@w3.org 
- I have forwarded it there. 
Please drop the authoring tools group from the cc on replies. 
Actually Amaya provides a "links" view, so you should be easily able to move through the links. 
How to do that probably needs to be better documented. 
I will probably try to provide documentation for keyboard control in a single page, as well as noting it throughout the general documentation. 
In either event, the CVS tree is the place to get the latest version of the documentation, which I hope will have some substantial updates for the next expected release version, due in November I think.
