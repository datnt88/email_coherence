<s> such a thing happens what should/will be the behavior of the client/proxy  </s>

<s> sure it's possilble.  </s>
<s> If you've read the last chunk (the 0 chunk) and then the connection closes all is good.. if the connection closes before you've read the last chunk then the response has been truncated and you should do something about it.. what to do it up to the client.  </s>
<s> If you're a cache then marking it uncachable seems like a smart thing to do with it for starters.  </s>
<s> even if the server is going to close the connection, chunking dynamically generated content is still smart beacuse then the client doesn't need to rely on overloading the semantics of EOF to separate an error from end of response body.  </s>
<s> from your messages the last couple of days it seems that you're working on an http/1.1 implementation.  </s>
<s> I'd suggest you go buy _Web Protocols and Practice_ by Krishnamurthy and Rexford - you'll find it invaluable in answering all of your questions and, in addition, teaching you about the questions you should be asking that you haven't thought of yet.  </s>
