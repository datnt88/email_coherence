Hi 
from an Amaya newbie! 
I have the following problem: Amaya works only offline. 
I tried to install a 
downloaded version, which only gave me a file- open dialog on startup. 
Then I found an Amaya RPM on my SusE-Linux 6.3 distribution and installed it (without deinstalling the other one). 
Now it starts, but all I can see are html's on my disk. 
With or without wwwoffle proxy (registered under preferences as localhost:8080 or localhost or 127.0.0.1:8080) it refuses to load pages from the net. 
Netscape, Opera and KFM always work well online. 
TIA, Matthias 
Hi, 
On Thu, 11 Jul 2000, you, John Russell, wrote on subject "Re: Amaya only offline": 
when you are trying for pages from the net , are you including the http:// part ....... 
yes, I am! Btw, 3.2.1 behaves the same way. 
The wwwoffle proxy seems to work partially, on entering http://localhost:8080 it shows its welcome page and cache indexes, but activating links to cached pages by (double-) clicking them doesn'work (page could not be read.). 
Still it doesn't work on remote urls. 
Greetings, Matthias
