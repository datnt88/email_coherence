Dear all, Judy, The new draft is already online in the given URL: I have incorporated most of the suggestions of the last review, and also from the AUWG face-to-face meeting. 
There might be some typos (hopefully not), and some editing needed. 
The change log is available on: The only thing not reviewed are Alistair's comments: which can also be discussed tomorrow. 
regards, carlos
