<s> Never mind the question about support for style sheets.  </s>
<s> But controlling font and color through the UI is still okay isn't it?  </s>
<s> Jon, For several of the checkpoints under guideline 4, Ensure user control of styles, one of the minimal functional requirements is basically, allow the user to change the default style sheet or allow the user to specify through user style sheets.  </s>
<s> However, couldn't a developer meet this requirement by allowing the user to configure fonts and colors through the UI?  </s>
<s> Is that what you meant by "default style sheet"?  </s>
<s> The use of style sheets, while a good idea, is not a requirement, correct?  </s>

<s> I think that there are a number of checkpoints that address a configuration range, and if possible, we should address them uniformly.  </s>
<s> I'm still thinking about how to do this.  </s>
<s> In my opinion, in no case should support for style sheets be a minimal requirement for meeting any checkpoint.  </s>
<s> However, style sheets may be sufficient for satisfying many of them.  </s>

<s> There is a confusion between support for the Specification CSS (which is mandated already under support appropriate W3C specs) and the even more important individual features that need to be available, such as control over font face, size, colours, volume, speed and pitch... CSS is a technique for meeting these individual requirements, that exist independently.  </s>
<s> Implementing CSS does not necessarily require the user to ever see something that is CSS - it can be implemented entirely through a menu-driven, or wizard-based, or copy-example type interface.  </s>
