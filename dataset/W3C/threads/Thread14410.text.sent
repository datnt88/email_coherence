Marti's comment got me thinking about drawing parallels to other disabilities and what we do there. 
Adding visual descriptions of pictures is adding something to a page that was not there. 
Could something equivalent be done for cognitive access? 
Two things that are true for LONGDESCs (and ALT) are 1)it doesn't affect the appearance of the page for mass users 2)it is fairly easy to describe how to do it (though quality will obviously vary) 3)it takes 1% to 5% of the effort (or less) to put the page/site together to do it. 
so putting these together let me coin a term ALTCOGPRES (Alternative Cognitive Presentation) is there a way we can come up with a *straightforward*, *easy to describe* and *easy to do* technique for presenting information on a page in an alternate form that 1)doesn't affect the appearance of the page for mass users 2)is fairly easy to describe how to do it 3)takes 1% to 5% of the effort (or less) to put the page/site together to do it.

Some more brainstorming: SMIL already has an abstract attribute for some elements. 
Maybe that could be one way of adding information of major components of content as well as the whole page. 
Short simple text could help also users with small screen devices. 
If I have interpreted the demands right, the TTS should work with these alternative attributes (If they don't has anyone told the TTS developers that?) or there should be also an audio version of them. 
Then similar info should be also presented with images. 
Or maybe the abstract should always contain a clarifying image? 
Then it would be nice also to have a simple explanation of the navigational structure of the site that could be attached to each page. 
This could help many other users too. 
Marja There are metadata dicitionaries around that describe words in terms of subclasses - eagle is a subclass of birds of prey, which is a subclass of birds, etc. 
These things are all in RDF, and should therefore be able to have a URI. 
Which would enable us to use RDF to link keywords, meanings, and illustrations. 
Which means we could build tools to add this kind of stuff.

Marja W3C Web Accessibility Initiative http://www.w3.org/WAI Location: I-cubed, 110 Victoria Street, Carlton VIC 3053 Postal: GPO Box 2476V, Melbourne 3001, Australia Here's a link to my half-finished RDF interface to WordNet., entry for Eagle. 
RDF's hierarchical type system thinks of this as the class of things Eagle, which is a sub-class of the class Bird_of_prey. the system above and immediately below Eagle). 
I hope to fix this (currently I confuse WordNet synonym-sets with the terms that constitute them, which creates a broken type hierarchy) and make it widely known. 
In meantime, more on WordNet available at Dan
