<s> Section 8.1.1 may come across as slightly biaised, because it lists only advantages of persistent connections.  </s>
<s> In practice, these are balanced by drawbacks.  </s>
<s> For instance, if the timeout value of persistent connections is larger than the TCP connection timeout, denial-of-service attacks are more effective: by using up all possible connections, a malicious user can prevent access to a targeted server for a longer period of time.  </s>
<s> Perhaps a quick mention of this issue would make sense in section 8.1.4 (Practical Considerations)?  </s>

<s> The denial of service attack is the same between persistent connections and non-persistent connections.  </s>
<s> I can see no difference between the two situations; the attacker does exactly the same thing in either case, with the same result.  </s>
<s> In general, denial of service attacks are very difficult to deal with.  </s>

<s> Presumably, the timeout of persistent connections will be longer than the TCP connection timeout (that is, the recommended time to maintain TCP TIME_WAIT state, generally 4 minutes).  </s>
<s> So even though the technique used for the attack is the same, the effect will be amplified in the case of persistent connections with long timeouts.  </s>
<s> Agreed. Jean-Philippe Martin-Flatin  </s>

<s> No, actually, most of the benefit from persistent connections appears to be in the first 30 seconds to a minute...  </s>
<s> I don't think many busy servers will likely keep that long a timeout, even with persistent connections.  </s>
<s> Mogul's research showed that most the value for "click ahead" occurs in the first few minutes, so a reasonable timeout for a busy server (one which will likely have to time out connections at all) is likely shorter than the TCP TIME_WAIT state.  </s>
<s> As I said, the attack is the same, and the effect is the same...  </s>
