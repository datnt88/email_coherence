WAI Interest Group: This is a call for information on two policy-related questions, to assist the WAI Education &amp; Outreach Working Group in compiling resources: 1) Laws, regulations, and practices directly or indirectly related to Web accessibility: Please take a look at the working draft policy reference site at http://www.w3.org/WAI/References/Policy.html and let us know about any additional countries where there is legislation that has bearing on Web accessibility. 
Send information to wai@w3.org . 
The relevant legislation may be disability discrimination, but it could also be information society policy, or telecommunications reform, or government procurement regulations, etc. Please note that the page is an incomplete draft, for instance many URL's are not yet linked, but should be shortly and will be available as a WAI Resource at that time. 
2) Science and Technology Policies that may relate to disability: We are also interested in Science and Technology Policies that may relate to disability. 
For example, in 1976 the U.S. passed Public Law 94-282, the National Science and Technology Policy, Organization and Priorities Act, but disability needs were not incorporated at that time. 
Do you know of countries with similar policies? 
Do the policies incorporate disability within their mission? 
If there is not such a policy, is there a research or priority-setting mechanism for development of science and technology? 
Again, please e-mail any information to wai@w3.org , rather than replying to the mailing list.

Questions?

For the Canada legisletion, if I understand correctly, it is said that thw links to the Canadian Human Roghts Commission... I have tried them and they seem fine to me... Maybe I missed something... Sincerely Sophie Latulippe T?l/Phone :(514) 989-8117 Web: http://www.total.net/~lsophie 
I applaud the effort and work that went into Here is feedback and a question. 
1. Feedback. 
Under United States, would like to see to whom the law is applicable, for example, federal, state, local, commercial/industry or private? 
Please note I not sure what is the best way to identify the commercial or industry sector or private). 
I do believe this would help people when they try to determine if this applies to them. 
For example, does ADA apply to Federal government? 
There has been discussion in the WAI IG that it does (see From:w3c-wai-ig-request@w3.org on behalf of Michael Muehe [MMuehe@CI.Cambridge.MA.US] Subject:Re: Accessibility 2. Question. 
In the Federal government, contracts have been written and are being written that state the web site must be ADA compliant. 
ADA is a buzz word that managers and webmasters and policy analysts understand. 
Should this be amended to say ADA and Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act or just 508? 
Seems like we have some education to do here in the Federal government. 
Would very much appreciate guidance on how this should be answered. 
Karl, is Fed Web's universal accessibility track discussing this?
