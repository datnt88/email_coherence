<s> hi Jon and Tim see MN 2 times below:  </s>
<s> MN: Please keep in mind that MouseKeys is not a good long term solution for many, and that it is very difficult to use on laptop keyboards.  </s>
<s> Can you use the "spacebar" or some such configurable key to "emulate" a mouse click in these situations ?  </s>
<s> MN: Tim, have you looked at the problem with "input type = file", that went around on the UA/IG list discussion last week?  </s>
<s> MSAA was unable to "find" the button supplied by IE 5.5.....  </s>
<s> Mark, I think everyone agrees that this is a poor solution to the problem.  </s>
<s> But it is a demonstration that it is not something that is not impossible for user agents to implement.  </s>
<s> We certainly hope developers would not try to satisfy the guidelines using this combination of technologies, although there is nothing in the guidelines to stop a developer either.  </s>
