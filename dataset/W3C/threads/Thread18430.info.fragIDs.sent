Completed Action Items 1.DP: Review navigation checkpoints for techniques 2.TL: CSS 1 compliance of IE IE XP will when rendering HTML strict documents Minutes JG: want to document implementation plans for most recent draft JA: have developed a table for input of implementation reviews, inputting Opera information JG: want documentation. 
going through checkpoints. 
MQ for speech implementation, I was looking at HPR. 
Is IBM reviewing their document. 
JG: need to look for techniques MQ ok will do it 1.1 Ensure that the user can operate the user agent fully throughkeyboard input alone. 
[Priority 1] Bothcontent and user agent. 
JG: cp 1.1 - any browser for all functionalities through keyboard TL: IE yes except text selection. 
JG: IE plus assistive tech will do text selection. 
send details to the list 1.2 For the element with content focus, allow the user to activateany explicitly associated input device event handlers through keyboard input alone. 
[Priority 1] Content only. 
JG: cp 1.2 - event handlers that can be activated through keyboard in win2000 with IE and narrator - have mouse in mouse out, combine with mouse keys for clicking (a possible solution) accessible browser project- navigate to event handlers, get a list and activate event (UIUC accessible browser project. 
1.3 Ensure that every message (e.g., prompt, alert, notification, etc.) that is a non-textelement and is part of the user agent user interface has a textequivalent. 
[Priority 1] Useragent only. 
JG: cp 1.3 TL: IE - yes. 
media player ??, they are improving 2.1 For all format specificationsthat the user agent implements, make contentavailable through the rendering processes described by those specifications.[Priority 
1] Content only. 
JG: cp 2.1 use rendering in specs. 
html 4 is weak GR: opera follows html spec for no script and error recovery. 
if script does not execute then display "no script". 
broken script, turn scripts off, JG: this is a difficult checkpoint. 
question - abbreviation or acronym. 
html doesn't say what to do with it. 
Keep in DOM GR: yes, in DOM, then UA or at can GR:ab it. 
JG: what about longdesc. 
GR: will look into it. 
TL: 2.1 reviewing list. 
IE, first DOM will reflect what is authored, will hand off non-native to plugin, will do html, xml, most of the text stuff. 
IE does not support longdesc. 
planning for next version. 
trying to MQ webspeak would follow longdesc and open an new browser instance. 
needed improvement. 
JG: only thing html 4.0 spec says. 
accessing longdesc must be different from accessing href 
GR: HPR supports longdesc. 
treats it like an href. 
alerts user for activation. 
TL: parts of html 4 that are not implemented. 
support html 3.2 and css1 and parts of dom. 
JG: anticipate DOM for JA:va script - text note TL: don't know JG: any browser html 4 compliant JA: Netscape 6 ??? Action TL: css 1 compliance of IE JG: some will change as html and css are modularized. 
don't know how this will affect checkpoints and compliance. 
xhtml basic. 
JG: need to know about html version compliance for browsers. 
JG: is realmedia SMIL 1 compliant. 
GR: what about lpplayer, JA: supports SMIL as far check with issound for SMIL compliance - JA: 2.2 For all text formats that the useragent implements, provide a view of the text source. 
Text formats include at least the following: (1) allmedia objects given an Internet media type of "text" (e.g., text/plain,text/HTML, or text/*), and (2) all SGML and XML applications, regardless ofInternet media type (e.g., HTML 4.01, XHTML 1.1, SMIL, SVG, etc.). 
JG: 2.2 view of text source. 
- yes for nearly all 2.3Allow globalconfiguration so that, for each piece of unrendered conditional content "C", the user agent alerts the user to the existence of the contentand provides access to it JG: 2.3 global configuration content access, conditional content JG: what about object GR: Netscape 6 has some support, if you use map to render text it renders nothing JG: 4.75 will render it. 
GR: testing pages for guidelines GR:oup. 
JG: may have use ulist and div MQ webspeak may do this, list items, no script, no frames, alt JG: display alt, alternative content in object and image, captions, no script, no frames, JA: no switch for captions in smile JG: opera - no script, no frames (if no frame information included, will not generate a plac EHolder - no repair strategy), image, no longdesc. 
JG: - alt for image, ti TL:e through tool tip. 
no frames. 
TL: don't know if IE will display no script. 
GR: no frame only to be rendered if non support for frames (quotes from spec) 
JA: IE seems to work, Netscape action JA: test object in opera GR: iframe should be included. 
did pages for testing that are archived somewhere. 
wai/gl/test has test pages for browsers, assistive tech, user expectations, functionalities. 
access key test pages, div etc. JG: may frame, iframe, longdesc, alt, no-script, object, no-frames no frame - opera and lynx object - Netscape no-script - lynx, opera, action DP: support for no-script HPR action GR: support for no-script lynx longdesc - webspeak, HPR 2.4 For content where user input is only possiblewithin a finite time interval controlled by the user agent, allow configuration to make the time interval "infinite". 
Do this bypausing automatically at the end of each time interval where user input ispossible, and resuming automatically after the user has explicitly completedinput. 
In this configuration, alert the user when the session has been pausedand which enabledelements are time-sensitive. 
JG: 2.4 pausing JA: opera says they do JG: how JA: don't know. 
action JG: check with opera how they comply with 2.4 2.5 Allow configuration or control sothat texttranscripts, collated text transcripts, captions,and auditory descriptions are rendered at the same time as the associated audiotracks and visualtracks JG: 2.5 caption. 
configuration of caption real does - has a switch window media does quick time does, using pro version can turn on-off captions (by deleting captions?) EH don't know of any. 
magpie is a creation engine. 
there is information that serves role of transcript, but the player does not know what it is. 
2.6 Respect synchronization cuesduring rendering. 
JG: 2.6 synchronization real yes windows media yes 2.7 Allow configuration to generate repair text when the user agent recognizes that the author has failed to provide conditional content that was required by the format specification.The user agent may satisfy this checkpoint by basing the repair text on any ofthe following available sources of information: URI reference, content type, orelement type. 
JG: 2.7 repair text - alt text, does anyone generate IE if no alt then IE show href lynx - file name, nothing, or place holder text IE with JA:ws - similar to lynx, configurable ( GR: may revise previous posting about JFW configuration) 2.8 Allow configuration so that when the user agent recognizes that conditional content required by the format specification is present but empty (e.g., the empty string), the user agenteither (1) generates no repairtext, or (2) generates repair text as described in checkpoint 2.7. 
MQ HPR does something. 
2.8 configuration - generate repair text - if alt null IE render plac 2.9 Allow configuration to render all conditional content automatically. 
Provide access to this contentaccording to format specifications or where unspecified, by applying one of thefollowing techniques described in checkpoint 2.3: 1a, 2a, or 1b EH: older or not. 
IE with JFW - JFW says nothing, can configure to speak images without alt. 
2.9 configure - render all conditional content. 
??? discussion about what checkpoint means. 
about SMIL and language tracks. 
EH in previous version of documents, automating pulling up of content out of context. 
GR: if no frame has longdesc, provide some step through functionality. 
more for querying to ask for selected items from a list of alternative information to display. 
JA: selecting caption and language tracks from a movie with 3 languages of each. 
GR: in cases where you need to generate repair text, it is a way to find repair text. 
JG: someone want to write technique action GR: write different markup (list of elements) that 2.9 applies to, for clarification. 
2.10 Allow configuration not to render content in unsupported naturallanguages. 
Indicate to the user in context that author-suppliedcontent has not been rendered. 
JA: I am confused 2.10 configuration to not render content and inform user. 
if you don't support a font for a language, browser would not render language but render place holder. 
IE prompt to get different language, or auto download, or do nothing, GR: technique-need demarcation for unrendered text should be in same character set declared for page. 
TL: css conformance for windows xp, if strict mode declared, then css1 supported JG: organize a face to face in July or later, topic--conformance test suites for developers, purpose for f2f try to bring in developers to develop test suites 
and recruiting. 
at this point in guidelines need to not change text but get 
implementation (must be satisfied by 2 independent implementations). 
need this 
to move to candidate recommendation. 
not sure where yet. 
GR: sent uri for test documents. 
there is dom-ts@w3.org 
list. 
see W3 QA (quality assurance) for more info. 
working on gl pages with UA in mind. 
JG: AOL working with Henter-Joyce, need to develop special api and accessibility api because they do not meet their needs. 
TL: do not know about this. 
am very interested. 
JG: messaged Scott Totman (?) about this. may have both ST and TL: on call in two weeks to discuss. 
DP: adobe and AOL using MSAA and inte GR:ating it in their suites. 
TL: working with adobe to get MSAA on track. 
JG: AOL ask for relief from using standard API. 
concerned about proprietary API for assistive technology. 
want developer and at people to use standard. 
TL: IE 6 has beefed up DOM and MSAA support, round tripping to find either place. 
closing hole as we find them. 
GR: lynx supports no-script renders it inline.

hi Jon and Tim see MN 2 times below: 
MN: Please keep in mind that MouseKeys is not a good long term solution for many, and that it is very difficult to use on laptop keyboards. 
Can you use the "spacebar" or some such configurable key to "emulate" a mouse click in these situations ? 
MN: Tim, have you looked at the problem with "input type = file", that went around on the UA/IG list discussion last week? 
MSAA was unable to "find" the button supplied by IE 5.5..... 
Mark, I think everyone agrees that this is a poor solution to the problem. 
But it is a demonstration that it is not something that is not impossible for user agents to implement. 
We certainly hope developers would not try to satisfy the guidelines using this combination of technologies, although there is nothing in the guidelines to stop a developer either.
