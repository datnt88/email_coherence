<s> Jon, I have reviewed the test suites for Checkpoints 1.1 and 1.2 and have the following comments/issues:  </s>
<s> General test suite comments: - If we have written sample testcases to test compliance with specific checkpoints, do you want us to send them to someone, or are your students at the University of Illinois or Colin Koteles writing all the test cases?  </s>
<s> - Have your students at the University of Illinois created a list of comments about the test suites?  </s>
<s> If so, is that list published somewhere for review?  </s>
<s> If not, could it be?  </s>
<s> Checkpoint 1.1 Full Keyboard Access Additional ACCESSKEY test cases could be written for LABEL, LEGEND, and MAP AREAS.  </s>
<s> I have the same comment for Checkpoint 11.2 - Current author input configuration.  </s>
<s> The same testcases could be used for both checkpoints, especially if you combine some of the accesskey tests together.  </s>
<s> The FRAMESET test is not self-contained on the test page, and there is no source for the individual frames.  </s>
<s> So a tester would still have to create more HTML to run the test.  </s>
<s> Additional TABINDEX testcases could be written for AREA, BUTTON, OBJECT, SELECT, and TEXTAREA.  </s>
<s> Changing Text Size test - how does it show compliance with Checkpoint 1.1?  </s>
<s> Checkpoint 1.2 Activate event handlers ONCHANGE attribute for SELECT elements test - When the star color is selected in the select menu, the graphic changes to the right color, but the corresponding alt text always says "red star".  </s>
<s> The Javascript function should also change the alt text for the test to make sense and to be an accessible test.  </s>
<s> ONFOCUS and ONBLUR tests could be written for SELECT elements.  </s>
<s> ONCLICK and ONDBLCLICK tests should be written for some normally activatable elements (A, AREA, INPUT of all types, BUTTON, TEXTAREA, SELECT, OBJECT, OPTION) plus a few other types of non-activatable elements in addition to IMG, like H1, TD, TH, or LI.  </s>
<s> For ONMOUSEOVER, ONMOUSEOUT tests, the tester should be able to hear something different as well as see something different for the mouseover event.  </s>
<s> For example, the alt text could also change when the "Lamp is turned on."  </s>
<s> A pop-up menu is a more common and useful example, and there should be onmouseover event tests for some normally activatable elements (A, AREA, INPUT of all types, BUTTON, TEXTAREA, SELECT, OBJECT, OPTION) plus other types of non-activatable elements in addition to IMG, like H1, TD, TH, or LI.  </s>
<s> There should also be a test for ONMOUSEMOVE.  </s>
<s> There should be tests for ONKEYPRESS, ONKEYDOWN, and ONKEYUP.  </s>
<s> Cathy Laws IBM Accessibility Center, WW Strategic Platform Enablement 11400 Burnet Road, Bldg 903 Office 5B004, Austin, Texas 78758 Let us run with perserverence the race that is set before us.  </s>
<s> Thanks Cathy!  </s>
<s> I for one support contributions to the test suite.  </s>
<s> The UAWG does not yet have a process set up for handling them.  </s>
<s> This issue is addressed in guidelines 7 [1] of "QA Framework: Operational Guidelines", which is currently in last call.  </s>
<s> This is a good topic for discussion at upcoming meetings.  </s>
<s> [1] http://www.w3.org/TR/qaframe-ops/#Gd-plan-for-ts-transfer  </s>
<s> Jon, it sounds like we could use an issues list for the test suite, linked from the test suite home page (and the UAWG home page).  </s>
<s> _ Ian Ian Jacobs (ij@w3.org)  </s>
<s> http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  </s>
<s> Thanks for your great comments on the test suites!  </s>
<s> I will update the test suite issues list [1] with these comments.  </s>
<s> This list is public.  </s>
<s> Jon [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/2002/12/issues-ts-html  </s>
<s> The ability to change text is a requirement of UAAG and this test makes sure that functionality is accessible through the keyboard.  </s>
