<s> i've been attempting to register for the EO Face2Face since 8 this morning (boston time), but the registration process keeps stalling between steps 2 and three, with a blank page loading in response to the submission of my magic registration number -- the blank page's title is "Registration for 'General User Information'" and the URI listed in the address bar is: http://cgi.w3.org/Register/registration.pl has anyone else encountered this problem?  </s>

<s> Gregory, [Removing cc to webreq list, &amp; reminder please don't cross-post between lists, thanks] Just tried it -- if I go straight to the page you indicate, yes it stalls, but if I go to it through the steps of the reg process, it doesn't -- I will follow up more with webreq to see if they can figure out why it's stalling some of the time.  </s>

<s> aloha, judy!  </s>
<s> thanks for the follow-up... i experienced the stall whilst following the steps in sequence... as for posting to webreq, that is the only concrete contact information contained in the front matter for Step 1, and since you have a lot more on your plate than simply chairing EO, and much more important things to attend to than troubleshooting a registration problem, i simply thought it appropriate to notify them of the situation.... what are the proper steps?  </s>
<s> my reading of the front matter to Step 1 is that one should contact the chair of the group holding the event as well as webreq gregory.  </s>
