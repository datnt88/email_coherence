Hi, Perhaps any of you could help me with the LINK REV=xxx relationships. 
With the CERN server, Im able to record the web documents which refer to any page in our server (see or the recent posting in www-talk). 
So I could include dinamically in the HEAD of our pages a list of external pages linking with ours. 
This would made a nice tool for a user to find related pages, if some browser comes to supoort it in the future. 
But, I'm not sure about which REL/REV tag would be used to accomplish this. 
The REL=Previous seems restricted to guided tours, according specifications... 
It could be a decent candidate if browsers become able to support multiple Next/Previous relationships. 
Any clue or suggestion?

Hey. I don't know anything about LINK REV, so I hope I'm not misinterpreting your question. 
I do know that what your talking about sounds a lot like backlinks- there are a few folks on the web who have been talking for a while about making it possible for users to find all the web pages pointing to a given page. 
Is this what you're getting at? 
If so, a couple of useful starting points are: and Hope this helps.

I suppose you could go to AltaVista, manually enter a search for link:theURL and -host:yourSite to find all backlinks not including your own links, then copy the resulting query string and put that as an HREF in your page. 
That's just off the top of my head -- you should check the help pages there for the correct syntax.
