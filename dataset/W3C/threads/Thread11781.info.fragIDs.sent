<s> My personal suggestions are (in order of preference) Monday 22 Feb - 4 pm  </s>
<s> Wednesday 24 Feb After 2pm  </s>
<s> Tuesday 23 Feb - 4 pm (one hour later than our current time)  </s>
<s> None of these are in conflict with the times people have indicated they are unavailable.  </s>
<s> Does anybody want to make another bid, or support one of these times?  </s>
