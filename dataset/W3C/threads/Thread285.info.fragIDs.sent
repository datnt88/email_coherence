Is there a way to prevent Tidy (I am using it within the HTML-Kit) from wrapping text that is surrounded by quotes? 
I have identified td as an inline tag to prevent extra whitespace from being generated. 
We have a long td that contains img tags. 
These img tags imbed images that are in a directory structure that contains a blank in the name of one of the directory levels, for example: 
"Images/home gif/logo.gif". 
If I set Wrap at to anything reasonable then Tidy will break one of these img tags when it encounters the space between home and gif. 
I have tried several different options but the only thing I found that eliminates the problem is to set Wrap at very high, like 400. 
By the way Dave, thanks for adding JSTE support to your December version. 
I'm sure Chami will get it in the HTML-Kit version soon after. 
Re: spaces in names I thought that spaces were supposed to be represented as %20 in file names like that.

URIs must not have spaces. 
' ' (0x20) must be %-encoded to %20, e.g. HREF="http://www.foo.bar/my%20files/" regards, Bj?rn H?hrmann - mailto:bjoern@hoehrmann.de - http://www.bjoernsworld.de 
I presume that you are referring here to only to quoted attribute values rather than contained body text. 
Having taken note of the %20 requirement for spaces in URIs, there are other situations where wrapping attribute values can have a visible impact on the browser. 
e.g. ALT and TITLE text. 
This can be eliminated by switching off wrap altogether by setting it to zero but that is taking a sledge hammer to crack a nut. 
My editor would like a wrap of about 60 for perfect readability so I think some sort of wrap-attribute-value: bool is needed just to suppress this particular action but allow contained body text still be tidied up.

Sorry about the recall message, obviously that is a feature of Outlook that doesn't work (to lists at least). 
I only wanted to change my autosig to the public one so you knew who I was.
