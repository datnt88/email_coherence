Hi DAV folks, Sorry for cross-posting this message but I hope that you may be interested! 
A new PEP draft is ready - I have submitted it as an ID and also as an W3C WD. 
You can find it in both txt, html, and ps as or You can also find general information about PEP at Thanks for the input on the previous PEP draft - you know who you are! 
The main new feature is that the mode of "long lived" mappings no longer is there as it was too hard to get to work through a proxy. 
A PEP extension declaration is now for a single message, which makes all extended messages understandable by any other PEP agent. 
Another new feature is that the mapping of PEP into HTTP/1.1 has been made explicit so that it is clear what is part of the PEP model and what is part of the mapping. 
Since the last draft, issued April 28, we have gained significant amount of implementation experience working with a small PEP demo developed by Eric Prud'hommeaux. 
The demo will be made available at Have fun! 
Thanks, Henrik Henrik Frystyk Nielsen, frystyk@w3.org 
World Wide Web Consortium What is the relevance of PEP to XML? Please explain.

Davenport and DocBook: http://www.ora.com/davenport/index.html Ah, sorry, wrong list. 
But it's a good question anyway; what is the advantage of PEP in the context of WEBDAV, and could you not acheive the same or better functionality using XML markup?

Davenport and DocBook: http://www.ora.com/davenport/index.html Oh - I thought that it was one of those philosophical questions that you always fear late Friday afternoon :-) Good question - short answer: part of it no and part of it yes. 
The "yes" part is the metadata part (using the "PEP-Info"), which can be expressed using XML or any other format for describing metadata without affecting the "no" part. 
The "no" part is the mechanism for introducing new features into a protocol message explaining what they are and allowing the recipient to potentially interpret the message correctly with no prior agreement. 
That is, you can extend HTTP dynamically in a decentralized mechanism.

World Wide Web Consortium In the context of WEBDAV, it allows applications to specify additional semantics on top of DAV which can be used to extend specific features like locks, reservations, and how to manipulate metainformation, etc., and also to query whether a server does DAV and at what level.

World Wide Web Consortium To me, PEP is going to be *very* useful in the context of WEB-DAV. 
Otherwise, I don't believe that we will be able to achieve enough consensus to ship out a version of WEB-DAV that everybody is happy with. 
I will be posting a longer note shortly that summarizes why we feel this way. 
Excellent! - It would be very interesting to actually test out some essential features based on the latest PEP spec and see that it fits the purpose. 
There are a few scenarios at the end of the spec in chapter 17, which we will be able to demonstrate this with some real code shortly.
