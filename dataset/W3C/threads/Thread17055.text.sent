All can someone help me with the validity of this as an html comment I have a list of valid sgml comments but the structure of the above doesn't seem to be included in that list. 
If the above isn't a valid comment is it likely to cause any problems. 
The comment is being put in by a CMS vendor who assures me that it doesn't cause problems with Bobby (which I don't doubt) but I'm not sure about it being valid markup.

It's not a valid HTML comment. 
Nor is it something that could be even be part of any XML document of any kind. 
It is what is technically known as "some random rubbish some idiot thought it would be a good idea to put there". 
It works because browsers are supposed to ignore element tags that are obviously wrong and although that can't be an element tag (begins with an invalid character) pretty much all browsers (but not all html tools) will recognise it as an obvious error and pretend it isn't there. 
Any tool that produces that is buggy. 
This should have occurred to me before but in your bug report you could recommend they use an xml processing instruction: Which wouldn't interfere with xhtml1.0 validity.
