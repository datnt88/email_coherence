<s> Anyways, the question at hand, why isn't this document validating a Strict?  </s>
<s> Well, the " !--"/"-- " commenting style isn't allowed in XHTML Strict.  </s>
<s> The  </s>
<s> new syntax is, as I understand it: [CDATA[comment goes in here]]  </s>
<s> Also, with Strict, deprecated attributes are not allowed (CSS must be used  </s>
<s> instead).  </s>
<s> On the IMG tag, these include align, border, hspace, and vspace.  </s>
<s> And, of course, your DTD should be set to "strict" as well.  </s>
<s> So, I dunno if that'll solve all your validation problems, but it's a start :).

<s> I'm trying to be a good little netizen and make few pages that conform to "4.01 strict" as determined by the w3 html validator.  </s>
<s> I noticed that in addition to center being deprecated the align="center" is also deprecated from div, and p tags.  </s>
<s> The page layout is something like this (cheesy ascii drawing:)  </s>
<s> The outer box represents the page dimensions.  </s>
<s> I orginally had a div align="center" around the whole page so that the 400px block would sit centered on the page, with the text wrapped within it, left aligned, and the banner centered.  </s>
<s> How do I accomplish this without using the align attribute?  </s>
<s> The only style setting I can find is "text-align: center" which seems to have no affect.  </s>
<s> so basically its like this right now: Text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text and I want that DIV centered on the page.  </s>
<s> anyone?  </s>

<s> But, anyhow, a CSS resource would be most useful to me at work.  </s>
<s> However, I don't have Usenet access here.  </s>
<s> Deja.com offered free newsgroup access via the Web, or at least they did until they folded two days ago.  </s>
<s> I would imagine, though, that there are other similar services around.  </s>
<s> An Altavista search for "+free +usenet +news +post" turned up 157 hits, for example.  </s>
<s> Going to http://www.deja.com now takes you to http://groups.google.com/ where they have "a beta version that allows high speed, high quality access to newsgroup postings already archived by Google since August 2000."  </s>
