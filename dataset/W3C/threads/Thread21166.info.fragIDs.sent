Hi, All 
I'm using Amaya 7.2 GTK as HTML editor. 
Till version 7.1 I was able to see background images, with 7.2 I only see a "neutral" color. 
Why??? 
On the same problem... is there a way to set the default background to white? 
Thank you. 
Ciao. Stefano.

check menu: Special - Preferences - General [Show background images] 
menu: Special - Preferences - Color [Document background color] 
If you use the palette remember to choose the colur with the other mouse button, otherwise you'll be changing the foreground color. 
Good luck!

It doesn't work. 
May be I wasn't able to explain the problem. 
Well... On a page I have: but Amaya doesn't display this image. 
In 7.1 abd previous versions it was OK. Other images are shown correctly. 
This works. 
Ciao. 
Stefano.

I made several tests and didn't detect this bug. 
Could you point me to a file that shows this bug.

That problem is fixed in the CVS version.
