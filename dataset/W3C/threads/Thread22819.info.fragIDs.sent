<s> It seems to me that it would be useful if MouseEvent class had a property that would enable listners to learn about coordinates of the event within the element's own coordinate system.  </s>
<s> Currently, there are only properties clientX, clientY that show coordinates relative to document and screenX, screenY that show coordinates with respect to screen.  </s>
<s> However, it would be very useful to have something linke offsetX, offsetY that would show mouse coordinates relative to the origin of the element (e.g. a DIV element) within which the event occured.  </s>
<s> Netscape already  </s>
<s> offers this in form of Event.layerX, Event.layerY and Internet Explorer offers this in form of Event.offsetX, Event.offsetY.  </s>
<s> However, none of those properties are standard part of DOM.  </s>
<s> You may be able to extract that information using the DOM Level 3 "Views" features, when that becomes available.  </s>
<s> It's _NOT_ a simple problem; remember that there's nothing which obligates the displayed form of elements to be cleanly nested, or even contiguous, Joe Kesselman / IBM Research  </s>
<s> I understand that the display of elements does not need to be cleanly nested visually.  </s>
<s> However, this doesn't mean that DOM implementation could supply coordinates of mouse evvents in coordinate system of the target element.  </s>
<s> To be able to do so one should simply subtract the sum of all offsets of the top left point of all ancestor elements.  </s>
<s> In that way DOM users could work with coordinate systems that have origins at the top left corner of each box.  </s>
<s> Also, Netscape and IE support this (although in an incompatihle way).  </s>
