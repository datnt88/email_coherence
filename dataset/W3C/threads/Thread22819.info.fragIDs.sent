It seems to me that it would be useful if MouseEvent class had a property that would enable listners to learn about coordinates of the event within the element's own coordinate system. 
Currently, there are only properties clientX, clientY that show coordinates relative to document and screenX, screenY that show coordinates with respect to screen. 
However, it would be very useful to have something linke offsetX, offsetY that would show mouse coordinates relative to the origin of the element (e.g. a DIV element) within which the event occured. 
Netscape already 
offers this in form of Event.layerX, Event.layerY and Internet Explorer offers this in form of Event.offsetX, Event.offsetY. 
However, none of those properties are standard part of DOM. 
You may be able to extract that information using the DOM Level 3 "Views" features, when that becomes available. 
It's _NOT_ a simple problem; remember that there's nothing which obligates the displayed form of elements to be cleanly nested, or even contiguous, Joe Kesselman / IBM Research 
I understand that the display of elements does not need to be cleanly nested visually. 
However, this doesn't mean that DOM implementation could supply coordinates of mouse evvents in coordinate system of the target element. 
To be able to do so one should simply subtract the sum of all offsets of the top left point of all ancestor elements. 
In that way DOM users could work with coordinate systems that have origins at the top left corner of each box. 
Also, Netscape and IE support this (although in an incompatihle way).

All the more reason for W3C/DOM to address this issue, right? 
"Brokered compromise"?
