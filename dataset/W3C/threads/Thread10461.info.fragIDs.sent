summary: no show stoppers. 
1. FIX: subject of a statement (after last call) In concepts defines the subject of a *triple* to be an RDF URI Reference. 
In Schema defines the subject of a *statement* to be the resource named by the URI that is the subject of the triple. 
Primer describes the subject of a *statement* to be a URI reference. 
This mixes the two definitions. 
I suggest the text in section 4.3 on Reification needs to be reviewed against the text in the schema doc to ensure consistency. 
2. Amused [[ ex:fred is an ex:primaryDriver of the instance ex:companyVan ]] If you read that aloud, it sounds like there has been a serious accident :) 
3. remove changes section at the end 
Brian-- Thanks for the review. 
Right, we need to fix this (both "triple" vs. "statement" and "URIref" vs. "resource named by URIref") There are other places that may need fixing as well. 
Concepts section 3.1 starts off saying "The RDF graph is a set of *triples*", but goes on to talk about "a value that is the subject of *the statement*". 
Perhaps there should be some text at this point that more explicitly defines the connection between "triple" and "statement" (since there are a number of other places in Concepts where "statement" rather than "triple" is used). 
Good point. 
This is what comes from my too-uncritically following suggestions from the Series Editor in his last review :-) (the prefix was xyz: before; should we change it back? 
Or perhaps we should actually use your comment in the Primer as an illustration that you shouldn't try to read English meanings too literally into RDF statements!)

I suggest you don't change this. 
Brian 
I won't change it this time around anyway. 
We can re-think if it bothers people after Last Call.

Brian-- A couple of questions: 1. 
Peter Patel-Schneider made the following comment about the references section of the Primer: 
It is very weird that a non-normative document has normative references 
I recall asking about this distinction (as far as the Primer went) but don't recall getting an answer. 
I had been using "normative" references to refer to those that were normative as to RDF and RDFS (and specs we *use*, such as URIs and XML), but not to those that were normative as far as RDF applications were concerned (like PRISM; the PRISM specs are normative for PRISM, but not for RDF). 
However, I'm not clear as to whether there is a separate concept of "normative as to a given document", which Peter's comment seems to imply. 
Do you have any opinion on this? 2. Is there specific boilerplate text we should be using in the "Status of this Document" section for the Last Call drafts (or should I just concoct something similar to what is now in the Concepts and Syntax LCC versions)? 
--Frank Frank Manola The MITRE Corporation 202 Burlington Road, MS A345 Bedford, MA 01730-1420 
Brian-- In your review of the Primer LCC, you'd noted something about the subject of a statement that need to be fixed "after last call" (copied below). 
Now that we're in the last call period, I want to make sure this doesn't get lost, particularly since it seems to involve a question of consistency among Primer, Schema, and Concepts. 
Does this need an issue?

My take is that it doesn't need WG review - its editorial, so I would be happy with a change id token from primer. 
However, if you feel it should be referred to the WG, I will create an issue on your request.
