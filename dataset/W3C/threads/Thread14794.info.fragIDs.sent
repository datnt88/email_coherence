<s> Question: Does a background image need alt text?  </s>
<s> If so, how should it be recognizable?  </s>
<s> Regards/Harvey Bingham  </s>
<s> No, it does not - unless the text is *essential* to understanding the page (few background images are however - they are mostly presentational).  </s>
<s> If the image is essential (does the page make no sense if you removed it?), then you could include separate text on the page, providing the same function of the image.  </s>

<s> The same would apply, I assume, for images that are the backgrounds of table cells.  </s>

<s> More to the point, by using styling effects to convey information needed to understand the page you are breaking the checkpoints that require seperation of style and the page's information... If your background image conveys information it shouldn't be a background image - it should be a part of the information of the page.  </s>
