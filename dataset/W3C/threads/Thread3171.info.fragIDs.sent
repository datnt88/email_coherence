TLS working group members: For personal reasons, I will be unable to attend the IETF meeting in San Jose in December. 
After talking this over 
with Jeff Schiller (Security Area Director) , I have decided that the working group will not meet in San Jose. 
Instead, 
I would like to review the outstanding issues on the mailing list and reach some conclusions on moving a document forward on the standards track. 
I realize that this is unfortunate, and I apologize for any inconvenience.

I consider this quite unfortunate, as so many people involved with SSL will be able to attend the San Jose meeting as it is in the heart of Silicon Valley. 
I'd be willing to schedule a specific evening to meet with any parties interested in talking during the IETF conference about SSL 3.0 or TLS. 
Any suggestions as to day and time?

Chris: Great idea! 
How about during the same time slot so that people who aren't on the list but were planning to attend the wg meeting can come?
