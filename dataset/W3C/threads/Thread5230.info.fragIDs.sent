<s> John's definitions are slightly different than those used in North America:  </s>
<s> Sorry, in subtitling the start of presentation of a subtitle is referred to as its on-air (or in-cue), the time at which the subtitle is removed from display is the off-air (or out-cue).  </s>
<s> Here, we use in-time and out-time (or erase time), although the effect is the same.  </s>
<s> On-air and off-air are probably more correctly used when talking about Open subtitling (where the subtitle is burnt in to the video image prior to transmission) -  </s>
<s> At some point, the working group must adopt a standard definition of "caption" vs "subtitle" to prevent international confusion.  </s>
<s> What John is calling subtitles is what  </s>
<s> we call captions: the textual representation of speech and non-speech information  </s>
<s> (such as sound effects) in the same language as the audio.  </s>
<s> Captions are for deaf and  </s>
<s> hard-of-hearing people, and can be closed (viewable with a decoder only) or open (visible to everyone, no decoder necessary).  </s>
<s> In NA, subtitles are a textual translation of the audio into a different language.  </s>
<s> Subtitles are for hearing people; as such, they don't always contain the information required by deaf or hard-of-hearing viewers, such as sound-effect cues.  </s>

<s> Captions are always in the  </s>

<s> motion pictures.  </s>
<s> I propose the following definition for captions:  </s>
<s> "Textual representation of dialog, narration and other audio events, in the same  </s>
<s> language as the original presentation."  </s>
<s> And for subtitles: "Textual representation of dialog or narration in a language different from the original presentation."  </s>
<s> We should also provide examples in the final recommendation, something we don't necessarily need to deal with right now.  </s>

<s> Sent: Monday, February 03, 2003 10:34 AM Subject: RE: TT and subtitling I'm not sure we need get to concerned about defining captioning vs subtitling, since TT should be agnostic to the 'higher' meaning of the text being transmitted :-) I would suggest that the terms subtitle and caption do not appear in the TT standard - since both carry a number of connotations.  </s>
<s> (In the UK a caption is the label to a picture).  </s>
<s> Captioning is NOT always in the language of the program audio - for example in the UK it is perfectly feasible on DTT (digital terrestrial TV) to have English subtitles AND English captions (as separate user selections) for a Welsh language (audio) program.  </s>
<s> To adopt the above definition would mean that any 'foreign language' program that is **not** dubbed could only be termed 'subtitled' - regardless of the inclusion of audio events and narration (which are indicative of captioning cf subtitling).  </s>
<s> Talk about head-spinning...  </s>
<s> It is becoming apparent that we should consider a broader definition of subtitle vs  </s>
<s> caption.  </s>
<s> That is, not differentiating subtitles from captions based on language, but  </s>
<s> based on content:  </s>
<s> -- captions contain additional information (sound effect cues, identifiers) -- subtitles contain no additional information  </s>
<s> In other words, the language of the original soundtrack *could* become irrelevant.  </s>
<s> Arguments?  </s>

<s> Well, we do know that we will have independent variation in natural language and on the above axis.  </s>
<s> But we have markup structures and terms for natural language.  </s>
<s> I don't believe that we have got to the bottom of this, yet, though.  </s>
<s> You do have your hands on a key aspect of differentiation.  </s>
<s> But even this has two factors.  </s>
<s> One is coverage: does the text track cover what is said in the sound track, or does it cover more by way of sounds or action.  </s>
<s> [And terms/language to describe the answer to "if more, then what?"]  </s>
<s> But aside from texture, there is the granularity of comparison in determining the goodness of fit.  </s>
<s> Some captions will abridge the dialog.  </s>
<s> The same information in different words.  </s>
<s> That is to say, they will describe what is said in the sound track in other words, even 'though in the same natural language.  </s>
<s> These are useful in educational and learning-difficulty applications.  </s>
<s> So the dimensions of the problem at least subdivide into - relationship between the natural languages of the two tracks .. this can be based on comparing values of a unary 'naturalLanguage' property of the tracks - relationship between the coverage of one track relative to the kinds of sounds in the other track.  </s>
<s> - other distinctions such as the reading level of the diction used in the variant as distinguished from the related variant track.  </s>
<s> Candidate primitive terms in a Dublin Core sense in this application are - natural language (done) - language level [TBD -- education community in the lead -- ISO/IEC JTC1 SC36 LCFA] - kinds of sounds (speech, [other categories to be named -- effects?  </s>
<s> sonicons?  </s>
<s> wallpaper?  </s>
<s> action?  </s>
<s> -- Dublin Core -like process of intercommunity harmonization of concepts]  </s>
<s> - rough order of coverage [fragmentary, substantial, partial] And all of these things are qualified by scoping them to media objects we can point at.  </s>
<s> Captions and subtitles are both supplemental resources that find their principal use in conjunction with other tracks.  </s>
<s> Al for more on the variety of use cases: No, we can't command changes to usage canonized in existing accredited standards.  </s>
<s> But the precision of the language used in their definitions is inadequate to capture distinctions that are important in assitive applications and adaptation choices.  </s>
<s> So we need to create a mapping [with noted ambiguities] between their definitions and the axes of distinction that matter in our applications.  </s>
<s> Then they might join us in DCMI to define a migration path to more universal language.  </s>
<s> However these distinctions are IMHO far removed from the requirements of a TT standard - which should be to define an agnostic mechanism for the timed delivery of text.  </s>
<s> Using XML, tags to provide distinction between the text categories (for want of a better term) should be optional, but undefined by the standard.  </s>
<s> The TT standard should IMHO only **define** tags that are necessary for the temporal control of the display of text.  </s>
<s> I'm not so sure we can get away with this.  </s>
<s> There are examples today of multi-level line-21 captioning (e.g., verbatim vs edited to a specific reading level), with no way to easily indicate what's in the data streams.  </s>
<s> We could perhaps solve that with metadata that defines at least two types of data... verbatim:true/false level: x, xx, xxx, etc., where x=editing level, reading speed, whatever ...indicating to the user that two or three or four streams of data exist.  </s>
<s> Of course, this opens up the problem of defining levels.  </s>
<s> I'm not sure that's appropriate for this group.  </s>
<s> But we could at least leave space for the options.  </s>

<s> Here's my understanding:  </s>
<s> Subtitles - Intended for all viewers who speak a given language* - Displayed by default for those viewers  </s>
<s> - Includes dialog only Captioning - Intended for hearing-impaired viewers - Displayed on request** by those viewers - Includes both dialog and audio events (generally visually differentiated by style, color, etc.) *For example, English translations of French dialogue for English- speaking viewers, which are unnecessary for French-speaking viewers.  </s>
<s> **Why isn't there a "I am hearing impaired" system preference?  </s>
<s> This needs to be defined as part of the standard since content may include both subtitles and captioning (although they will generally be exclusive).  </s>
<s> -- Charles Wiltgen  </s>
<s> Similarly I am hoping that the style of the displayed text is defined by an optional mechanism (e.g. style sheets) and that the end presentation of the text is primarily the responsibility of the **viewer** implementation (and could be much different to the authors conception).  </s>
<s> I think putting the burden of text-display characteristics on the viewer is an unfair one.  </s>
<s> I am not against viewers overriding author choices, perhaps by using style sheets to control the style characteristics of the text, but I think it's incumbent on the author to provide captions or subtitles that convey information in a logical manner.  </s>
<s> ("Logical manner", of course, will differ from author to author and agency to agency, but that's another story....) If viewers want to change the appearance of the captions (just as they can change the appearance of a Web page today), fine.  </s>
<s> Otherwise authors might as well just provide a plain transcript and nothing more.  </s>
<s> I am hoping that the TT standard is **unlike** SMIL, RealPlayer, Quicktime.  </s>
<s> These existing standards IMHO already provide competent solutions where the **authors** intended presenation of the material is preserved totally through the transmission chain to the display surface.  </s>
<s> I, too, am hoping for a format unlike RealText, QText and SAMI.  </s>
<s> Yes, they provide  </s>
<s> competent solutions for the display of text, but they're incompatible with each other.  </s>
<s> It's a real pain creating three different caption/subtitle files for a single presentation.  </s>

<s> The distinction is that you classify captioning as a type of subtitle because you own "subtitling.com"?  </s>
<s> :O) Seriously, they're for different audiences (subtitles are dialog intended for all speakers of a given language, captions are for the hearing-impaired and contain more than just dialog) and have different mechanics (subtitles should be displayed for all viewers who speak a given language, while captions are specifically for the hearing-impaired), and TT must differentiate between them unless accessibility is not a goal.  </s>
