<s> Yes. Briefly:  </s>
<s> PNG has such a capability (embed metadata in the image file).  </s>
<s> RDF is in general viewed as how we would standardize the data  </s>
<s> dictionary and/or information model for the information to be bound in in that way.  </s>
<s> There have been proposals for filename conventions to put metadata in parallel files but I think that is not reliable enough.  </s>
<s> Host capabilities to annotate persistent objects will vary among hosts.  </s>
<s> That is why to create an abstract information model and let author tools and servers query the persistent metadata via physical methods that are localized to the host.  </s>
<s> Consider the metadata capabilities of Hierarchical Storage Management products.  </s>
<s> Yes it would be better.  </s>
<s> The author tools do some of this in a limited way already with tool-peculiar databases of ALT/image pairs, all uses of a common URI-reference, etc.  </s>
<s> But the full systematization is in the future and we need an approach to defining information coverage requirements that is not dependent on the developers choice of persistent data technology.  </s>

<s> Marja, the tool/project I am working on (specification to be published for discussion here soon) will have this possibility; a simple side-wide ALT database, basically just a textfile with mapping IMG-SRC to ALT, and the ability to put the given ALT automatically into all IMG occurences of your site, for you as an HTML author.  </s>
