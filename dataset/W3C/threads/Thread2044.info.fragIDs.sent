<s> The TITLE entity header field, like the LINK field have an explicit correlation with the same HTML tag; but MUST a server process an HTML file to extract these values or a Server can ignore them even if it receives an explicit request of these fields ????  </s>
<s> I think the title field is poorly motivated wrt a HTML document.  </s>
<s> I see little advantage in getting the Title of the document up a few packets earlier.  </s>
<s> There is an issue with the HEAD method however, if one does a head then one wishes to obtain meta-information relating to the entity without obtainig a body and hence Title does have some use.  </s>
<s> Title and link are rather more usefull when dealing with content types which do not provide for header or link attributes.  </s>
<s> It is usefull to add a title to a JPEG or GIF, it would have been nice if Link could be used to add links into such objects - ie client side image maps.  </s>
<s> Overall I'm not too keen on the link tag/header because I don't think that anyone has proposed a comprehensive and coherent semanitcs for them.  </s>
<s> My view of what link should be is annotations in the Hyper-G model.  </s>
<s> Ie they should be used to inform a client about links which relate to an entity which are not a part of it.  </s>
<s> Annotations are one example.  </s>
<s> This model would indicate a need to incorporate a position indicator into the tag: Link: http://www.cern.ch/TheBook/chapter2 ; rel="Previous"; pos=1654-1754 Where pos in this case is a simple character offset.  </s>
<s> I suspect that we really need a comprehensive notation for describing positions within a hypertext structure.  </s>

<s> yes, I was thinking about it.  </s>
<s> The problem is how a server can extract this meta info?? doing a full text parsing?  </s>
<s> isn't it too heavy??  </s>
<s> A robot could have many advantages using only HEAD request to retrieve all the meta info related to an html file...but which server handle this kind of info??  </s>
