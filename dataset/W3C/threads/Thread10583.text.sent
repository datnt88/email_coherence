Hi all, as expected the I18N formally asking for our opinion on their treatment of our comments. 
I am not sure when we next might have a telecon, but this is a potential agenda item. 
I suggested in a response accepting their decisions. 
(Since this is the default I guess we only *need* to discuss this, in the next two weeks, if someone disagrees with that) Jeremy Dear Jeremy, Many thanks for your comments on the 2nd Last Call version of the Character Model for the World Wide Web v1.0 [1]. 
We appreciate the interest you have taken in this specification. 
You can see the comments you submitted on behalf of the RDF Core Group, grouped together, at (You can jump to a specific comment in the table by adding its ID to the end of the URI.) PLEASE REVIEW the decisions for the following additional comments and reply to us within the next two weeks at mailto:www-i18n-comments@w3.org (copying w3c-i18n-ig@w3.org) 
to say whether you are satisfied with the decision taken. 
C028, C029, C030, C031 Information relating to these comments is included below. 
The Character Model has recently been split into two parts. 
These comments relate to the editor's version at Best regards, Richard Ishida, for the I18N WG DECISIONS REQUIRING A RESPONSE C028 Na Na C Jeremy Carroll RDF Core WG PMDVariousEndorsement from RDF Core Comment (received 2002-05-27) -- Endorsement from RDF Core For the sections 3.4, 4, 6, 9, C, D RDF Core endorses the last call working draft. 
We have found earlier drafts helpful in identifying how best to meet our responsibilities to RDF users world wide. 
(However, we do not intend to address all the requirements of these sections in the version of the RDF recommendations currently in working draft). 
Decision: Not applicable. 
Rationale: We thank you for your endorsement. 
We have classified this comment as 'not applicable' because it does not suggest or imply any changes. 
We would like to note that the Character Model is written so as to make clear that specifications do not have to follow all the requirements, just those that apply in their specific case. 
C029 Na Na C Jeremy Carroll RDF Core WG PMD2breadth of scope Comment (received 2002-05-27) -- breadth of scope Concerning sections 1 and 2 RDF Core is concerned that the scope of charmod is overly broad. 
In particular, there appears to be no acknowledgement that some languages being defined by W3C working groups may not be intended as web languages and hence not have a need to address internationalization issues. 
There may be an implicit (and false) assumption that all W3C recommendations specify (only) web languages with processing models. 
Our response (sent 2002-05-27) -- Re: breadth of scope Comment (received 2002-05-28) -- RE: breadth of scope Decision: Not applicable. 
Rationale: We have classified this comment as 'not applicable', because it is too general. 
Each CharMod requirement applies only where applicable. 
For example, if a specification doesn't deal with sorting, then requirements related to sorting do not apply. 
Also, specifications that don't deal with text (e.g. a bitmap format) would therefore not have any applicable requrements (except e.g. for textual comments and other metainformation embedded in the format). 
We would also like to point out that the term 'processing model' is taken very widely here. 
Even if a specification does not have an explicitly defined processing model, it implicitly defines how to process (e.g. match) characters. 
As an example, RDF conforms to the processing model, on the level of the abstract syntax by virtue of the fact that the abstract syntax is expressed in Unicode, and on the level of RDF/XML by virtue of being based on XML. 
C030 E N C Jeremy Carroll RDF Core WG PMD3.5non-universality of processing model Comment (received 2002-05-27) -- non-universality of processing model For the section 3.5 RDF Core WG notes that the language is somewhat offputting for us as specification developers given that our specification explicitly does not have a processing model. 
We have no particular suggestions about this, nor would we object if the I18N WG chose not to address this issue. 
Our response (sent 2002-05-27) -- Re: non-universality of processing model Comment (received 2002-05-28) -- RE: non-universality of processing model Decision: Noted. 
Rationale: We have classified this comment as 'Noted', because it did not contain any suggestions for changes. 
However, in order to address the misunderstanding that we think this comment exposes, we have added some text (just before C014): "Also, while this document uses the term Reference emph Processing /emph Model and describes its properties in terms of processing, the model also applies to specifications that do not explicitly define a processing model." 
We hope that this clarifies the situation for RDF: Even if there is no processing model for RDF, on the level of text processing, RDF conforms to the Charmod Reference Processing Model because of the way the abstract syntax is defined in terms of Unicode characters and because of the way XML is used. 
C031 S P C Jeremy Carroll RDF Core WG PMD8no dependency on IRI draft See also the following comments: C059 C170 Comment (received 2002-05-27) -- no dependency on IRI draft The main concern of the RDF Core WG is section 8. 
Any normative section of charmod MUST NOT depend on the IETF IRI draft which is not finished and is not yet stable. 
We draw attention to 'SHOULD use Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRI) [I-D IRI]'. 
The IRI draft is only a draft, the reference to it is not normative, and the strength of this SHOULD dependency appears excessive ('not optional'). 
In particular, the IRI draft does not adequately address IRI equality (not merely functional equivalence in retrieval). 
Moreover, the bidi section presents a learning curve which developers are unlikely to want to climb before IRI has consensus around it; We have found the text in Xlink section 5.4 and XML Erratum 26 adequately clear for some of the IRI questions, particularly those that are most pressing for RDF and believe that charmod should merely: - reiterate such text; - reiterate the early uniform normalization model for the iris when regarded as unicode strings Decision: Partially accepted. 
Rationale: Our plan is that the IRI ID, referenced in this section, will have been submitted for Proposed Standard by the time CharMod moves to the next stage. 
IRI equality is fully addressed in the latest IRI ID version. 
USEFUL LINKS [1] The version of CharMod you commented on: [2] Latest editor's version (still being edited): [3] Last Call comments table, sorted by ID: In my case, silence is consent on this issue. 
(I took a quick look and it seemed OK, though I didn't cross-check the issues in great detail.) #g Graham Klyne I agree with it, ie we should accept their decisions. 
Take this as a vote if required.
