<s> I just sent in two IETF drafts, and got them rejected by the IETF secretariat because they were not in the right format according to  </s>
<s> Here are questions about some of the requirements in that document:  </s>
<s> They say that IETF drafts must have 58 lines/page with form feed between pages.  </s>
<s> I fully agree that this is the format for published RFCs, but for IETF drafts it is very common to have no pagination at all.  </s>
<s> To paginate a document is quite a lot of extra trouble unless you have software which will do it automatically.  </s>
<s> I suggest that either IETF relax this requirement to be only valid for RFCs, not for IETF drafts, or recommend some software which will do the pagination for me, preferably as a Word macro.  </s>
<s> The document says "The Internet-Draft should neither state nor imply that it has any standards status."  </s>
<s> Does this mean that it is not permitted to write, in an IETF draft, sentences like "this standard only is valid for e-mail, not  </s>
<s> for Usenet News" or "to comply with this standard, an implementation must ..." or phrases like that?  </s>
<s> If the answer is yes, should I change all occurences of "standard" with the word "specification"?  </s>
<s> Does this mean that it is not allowed to write for example "Category-to-be: Proposed Standard" or "This document is intended to become a Propised Standard if accepted by the IETF" or something like that?  </s>
<s> Surprisingly, the document says nothing about copyright statement.  </s>
<s> Does this mean that the requirement for an IETF copyright statement in each draft is not valid any more?  </s>
<s> The document says that the word "INTERNET-DRAFT" should appear in the upper left corner.  </s>
<s> Does this mean that the format of the head must be changed from:  </s>
<s> Network Working Group Name Internet draft Affilition file-name-00.txt  </s>
<s> Country Expires August 1999 February 1999 to: INTERNET-DRAFT Name Network Working Group Affilition file-name-00.txt  </s>
<s> Country Expires August 1999 February 1999  </s>

<s> Did you fulfil the following requirement?  </s>
<s> Please clearify.  </s>
<s> Patrik  </s>
<s> Unless they changed the rule the other day, this is not a requirement.  </s>
<s> That's probably what nailed you.  </s>
<s> "This standard" is inappropriate for a draft.  </s>
<s> "This document" or "this specification" is much better, since you don't know what status the draft will get (if any).  </s>
<s> Personally, I would say that those are also inappropriate.  </s>
<s> A draft is a draft.  </s>
<s> I also do not think they are sticky on this, but they may have changed the rules in the past two weeks.  </s>
