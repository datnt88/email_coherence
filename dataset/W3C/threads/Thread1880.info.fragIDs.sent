I just sent in two IETF drafts, and got them rejected by the IETF secretariat because they were not in the right format according to 
Here are questions about some of the requirements in that document: 
They say that IETF drafts must have 58 lines/page with form feed between pages. 
I fully agree that this is the format for published RFCs, but for IETF drafts it is very common to have no pagination at all. 
To paginate a document is quite a lot of extra trouble unless you have software which will do it automatically. 
I suggest that either IETF relax this requirement to be only valid for RFCs, not for IETF drafts, or recommend some software which will do the pagination for me, preferably as a Word macro. 
The document says "The Internet-Draft should neither state nor imply that it has any standards status." 
Does this mean that it is not permitted to write, in an IETF draft, sentences like "this standard only is valid for e-mail, not 
for Usenet News" or "to comply with this standard, an implementation must ..." or phrases like that? 
If the answer is yes, should I change all occurences of "standard" with the word "specification"? 
Does this mean that it is not allowed to write for example "Category-to-be: Proposed Standard" or "This document is intended to become a Propised Standard if accepted by the IETF" or something like that? 
Surprisingly, the document says nothing about copyright statement. 
Does this mean that the requirement for an IETF copyright statement in each draft is not valid any more? 
The document says that the word "INTERNET-DRAFT" should appear in the upper left corner. 
Does this mean that the format of the head must be changed from: 
Network Working Group Name Internet draft Affilition file-name-00.txt 
Country Expires August 1999 February 1999 to: INTERNET-DRAFT Name Network Working Group Affilition file-name-00.txt 
Country Expires August 1999 February 1999

Did you fulfil the following requirement? 
Please clearify.

Unless they changed the rule the other day, this is not a requirement. 
That's probably what nailed you. 
"This standard" is inappropriate for a draft. 
"This document" or "this specification" is much better, since you don't know what status the draft will get (if any). 
Personally, I would say that those are also inappropriate. 
A draft is a draft. 
I also do not think they are sticky on this, but they may have changed the rules in the past two weeks.
