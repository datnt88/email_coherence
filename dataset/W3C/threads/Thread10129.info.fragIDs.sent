<s> I'd prefer to leave this at "language" rather than "framework".  </s>
<s> I admit that RDF has "framework" in it, but we never actually say what a "framework" is (and the Concepts document starts off immediately talking about "syntax", which seems more of a "language" notion).  </s>
<s> If we're going to describe this as a "framework", I'd feel some compulsion to say what we mean by that (including how the "language" aspects of RDF fit into that "framework").  </s>
