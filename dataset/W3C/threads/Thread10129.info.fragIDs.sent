Did that thread resolve satisfactorily ... Concepts start off now "The Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a framework for representing information in the Web." 
I note this is logically equalivant to, the slightly less clumsy: "The Resource Description Framework (RDF) represents information in the Web." 
However, it's much more important that we all have the same one.

The two other docs that have such an introductory sentence both use the term language, not framework.

I'd prefer to leave this at "language" rather than "framework". 
I admit that RDF has "framework" in it, but we never actually say what a "framework" is (and the Concepts document starts off immediately talking about "syntax", which seems more of a "language" notion). 
If we're going to describe this as a "framework", I'd feel some compulsion to say what we mean by that (including how the "language" aspects of RDF fit into that "framework").
