Dear IPO/WAI working group members I found out about something yesterday which I would like to share with you to ask for you comment: In today's browsers the use of the so called "tool tip" is introduced. 
This is a a text that pops up as soon as your mouse pointer 'hits' an object e.g. an image. 
The Alt text attribute is used to store the text shown to you. 
This means several things: - This problem already exists for HTML 3.2 and currently available browsers use it. 
- There is another reason for designers to use ALT texts. 
This reason might easily conflict with the use of ALT text as used in ALTernative ways of reading HTML. 
- The argument ALT text can so serve to targets does not work since designers will ONLY serve and follow their main group of potential users and use local guidelines for the contents of the text in the ALT-attribute. 
What is your opinion on this as far as both HTML 3.2 and HTML 4.0 are concerned?

I think that what the GUI users would expect to read in a tool tip is something we don't know. 
We should understand it better before we assume it is different from the information we need; Or assume it is the same, for that matter. 
There are a variety of ways that the HTML can provide text content for a tool tip: ALT on images, TITLE on anchors, onmouseover scripts on almost anything. 
We should not assume that the demands for information from the GUI-using browsing public will be different from the demands of the eyes-free browsing public. 
We should first try to do some market research on the visual-presentation information fields like this tool tip. 
Find out what the browsing person that is looking at a GUI screen would want in that space. 
If it fits our need, we should use that information in the eyes-free context, too. 
We should not ask for fields dedicated to eyes-free consumers unless we have exhausted our possibilities for sharing information with the majority. 
I am hopeful that the information the eyes-free browsing individual needs is information that the eyes-first browsing individual will want at certain times. 
This is content that is presented to the eyes-free customer all the time and to the eyes-first customer part of the time. 
If we can express our needs in terms of information topics that the GUI user wants, at least sometimes, and associate HTML text spaces (elements and attributes) with those topics, we have maximized our "universal design" quality rating. 
And we will get the information the eyes-free need in more HTML pages than if we define the categories or topics to be filled in in some other way. 
There is an unresolved area that the markup guidelines and browser guidelines working groups need to team up on. 
This has to do with what goes in ALT as we have richer options in terms of other attributes with related uses. 
We need a migration plan by which we can get from A: the situation now when information demands are fighting over the space in the ALT string because that is all that gets consistently displayed by browsers, to B: a better future situation where the breadth of attributes including not only ALT on images but also TITLE on links etc. are displayed enough by browsers so that authors use them in discriminating ways and the eyes-free browse presentation has the information it needs in a syntactic place it can count on. 
We aren't at B yet. 
It takes sending compatible messages to the browsers writers and page writers to get there. 
I think that with 4.0, including the attribute additions that the HC team recommends, HTML gives us enough information buckets to fill. 
We still need a better story as to what information goes in what buckets so that browsers can pull the right information at the right times. 
There is time to publish this story in the Markup Guidelines and Browser Guidelines. 
We don't have to have the answer all worked out by Wednesday. 
But we do need to recognize that there is work remaining to be done to get our story straight. 
-- Al Gilman I should be more concrete. 
In my experience, tool tips are used to answer the question "What does this button do?" 
I believe that you were referring back to the controversy over what text should go in the ALT string when an IMG functions as a button to activate a hypertext link. 
In this case, if the author things of the ALT as a tool tip, they are more likely to answer the question "What happens when I activate this link?" than to answer "What does this image show?" 
So, if the eyes-free Web browser is more concerned about the link target than the image description, having sighted authors think of ALT as a tool tip is probably friendly. 
It is still possible that they want to answer either or both of those questions in a tool tip. 
I think that the presence of tool tips in the GUI presentation of a page is on the whole a positive influence on our success in getting needed information into HTML pages. 
People using GUI screen readers need to have the capability to turn them off, and things like that. 
But I think that we can make the tool tip a friend if we approach it right. 
-- Al Hi AL, CONTAINS PROPOSAL This is not an approach I expect in this group. 
At first I would like to stress the need for an alternate descriptive text feature. 
For this the ALT-attribute can be used unless other groups of users do not want to use it for other perposes. 
The reason I found out about it was in my own office where they use: - small images as button (looks great) - use the "tool tip" to describe the action, but have the reasonable rule NOT to use the tool tip if the text is the same as the button shows since this looks stupid to a gui-user. 
The approach we need is that we have a solution that assures an accessibility add-on in stead of other rules to fight against. 
I feel free to express the opisite: We already experience what GUI-users expect, want and use. 
We do not have the time nor the means to do any research in this field. 
You might well expect GUI-users will expect/need something else than we do. 
We work here to find solutions for us not to find solutions for others. 
Why is the ALT-atrribute used (ihn image)? 
===== My proposal to the HTML groups is to add the "TOOL_TIP"-attribute to reach homogeenieous use for this useful thing and to free other attributes (like ALT) for there origional use. 
I heavily support this argument, but not if it costs accessibility. 
In the current approach the ALT-attribute will most likely not serve anymore. 
I fully agree on the buckets philosophy. 
If this problem is not solved in HTML 4.0 it is up to us to highlight this if we are about to have negative spin offs. 
In theory you are right, but A: Turning of pictures is only requested if line performance problems occur. 
This problem will disappear in the near future. 
B: If GUI-users / designers use the ALT-attribute for alternate objectives GUI-specific rules will apply. 
This is the problem. 
So not a technical problem but a disign conflict. 
I do hope my explanation is clear enough not to move this from the agenda.

ALT text on IMG is being used by most GUI browser as source to display balloon-help/tool-tip text. 
Therefore, content providers, knowing that, tend to adapt their ALT text to this use, and not to the "alternate textual description" usage for which it was designed. 
Examples: - if the IMG represents a button displaying some fancy text (say W3C logo), it is likely that the content designer will not put any ALT text ("W3C") since that would make its GUI looks dumb/redundant when the mouse is passed over the logo - some page designer just drop the alt semantics altogether and chose to use the balloon function to display some short ads ala "Buy the new Ford Escort!", over an IMG that has nothing to do with Ford or buying. 
My personal take: I don't think there is much we can do about the short-ads case, this is just feature abuse. 
For the redundant case, I think we have enough buckets with TITLE, ALT, and onmouseover attributes on IMG, and the markup/browser/tool guidelines can clarify how to use them to achieve the best coverage (e.g. if ALT is left empty because of fear of balloon redundancy, then TITLE should be used to convey textual short description, and onmouseover takes precedence over non scripting method). 
I don't think adding a TOOL-TIP attributes will help in the long run, since I think they're too close to each other, and content providers will either use it or use ALT, but not both, and in the end, it will become a replacement for ALT, under a new name. 
Jaap, We put in the ALT ToolTip into IE3 to raise the "visibility" of the importance of the attribute. 
With IE4, we use the TITLE attribute if both ALT and TITLE exist on the same element and ALT if TITLE is not present. 
Using Active Accessibility, the same information is formatted into the Name and Description properties of the MSAA interface. 
Of course, the information is also available through the Dynamic HTML object model.
