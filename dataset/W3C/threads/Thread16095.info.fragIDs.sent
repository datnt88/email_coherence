<s> I very much appreciate that the "WCAG 1.0" Fact Sheet (http://www.w3.org/1999/05/WCAG-REC-fact#text) goes so far at to say:  </s>
<s> Text-only pages should not be necessary to ensure accessibility of Web  </s>
<s> pages that follow the "Web Content Accessibility Guidelines," except in very rare cases.  </s>
<s> In fact, text-only pages are frequently counterproductive to accessibility since they tend to be kept less up-to-date than "primary pages," or in some cases leave out information that is on primary pages.  </s>
<s> Many sites that have made a commitment to accessibility in the past have  </s>
<s> used text-only pages as a solution; however, by following these guidelines it should be unnecessary in almost all cases, or even inadvisable, to set up and maintain a separate set of text-only pages.  </s>
<s> I agree with all of the above.  </s>
<s> I accept it as true.  </s>
<s> Now, how do I prove it to others who would advocate for text-only pages?  </s>
<s> Can anyone point to me to URLs that present evidence that "text-only" pages are usually NOT in parallel with the default version?  </s>
<s> Is there any published research that the "text-only" approach, while perhaps having noble intent, is counter-productive?  </s>
<s> We had an interested thread here not long ago (starting with the case was made that "text-only" did not mean accessible anyway!  </s>
<s> Is this a consensus position that is documented any where?  </s>
<s> Thank you very much.  </s>

<s> A blind individual and a deaf individual and a person with mobility problems and a group of people who suffer from cognitive impairments may have very different needs, which would be better served by a single version which transforms gracefully across media, and provides orientation, simplicity and consistency as appropriate.  </s>
<s> Testing by individuals, or with a variety of browsers, is a good way to understand the types of problems that may arise.  </s>
<s> Without exhaustive testing across a range of people with various disabilities and across a range of technologies it is not a test of whether a site is accessible, merely whether it is accessible to a certain group of users.  </s>
<s> is my general 2c on that topic.  </s>
<s> For XML...  </s>
<s> A page created in XML is simply a page - it depends on how it was done.  </s>
<s> The  </s>
<s> same rules apply as with HTML - device independence, markup of structure  </s>
<s> explicitly rather than by presentation conventions, etc. XML allows these, but as with any technology sufficiently powerful to be useful it also allows completely inaccessible design.  </s>
<s> When writing XML applications follow the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines.  </s>
<s> Which makes 4 cents worth of my personal opinion.  </s>
<s> Enough for now I think.  </s>

<s> Two questions, one on the text-only issue and one about XML.  </s>
<s> At the beginning of this thread it seemed the problem with "text-only" was keeping them up to date.  </s>
<s> I understand this problem, and spent a considerable  </s>
<s> effort at providing a text-only site that kept up to date, not by producing  </s>
<s> copies, but by offering two seperate views of the same information.  </s>
<s> Now, I am getting the feeling that the issue isn't maintainability- it seems to have turned to some nebulous design issue.  </s>
<s> I have tried my best (maybe it's not good enough eh?) to promote web accessibility on all the projects I have worked on.  </s>
<s> I have studied the ins and outs of HTML4, CSS, and WAI guidelines (again, probably not to the extent this group would have one study) and fought to work with the new techniqies and within the guidelines.  </s>
<s> The results have been clean, well organized sites that  </s>
<s> stress accessibility to information beyond accessibility to blind, deaf and  </s>
<s> mobility impaired users- the thing I stress to clients most often when discussing accessibility is that accessibility comes down to the accessibility of information, and that this includes all the ADA issues as well as information  </s>
<s> architecture and general usability.  </s>
<s> Why isn't a text-only view of information  </s>
<s> (not a text-only copy) which does not use visual or audio data as its core  </s>
<s> elements now considered bad?  </s>
<s> Second question regarding XML: I remember there was something called XSL which I found very exciting especially as related to web accessibility.  </s>
<s> The way I initially saw it, an XML document was never "viewed" in a browser, but was a strictly formatted structured document (probably written by a program) from which various things could be communicated to either another program or a human user.  </s>
<s> But the human user would never "see" the XML, would never come in contact with the structure of the document (unless that was the purpose of the document (a table of contents as a poor example) or the interface to the XML (a nested list view of the same table of contents whose structure was defined in the XML- another poor example).  </s>
<s> I immediately realized that an XML subset document (take SMIL for instance) could be presented in many different ways with XSL- a series of paragraphs in a SMIL presentation could be rendered one after the other down a page instead of being placed along a timeline.  </s>
<s> I was confused by "device independace, markup of structure explicity rather than by presentation conventions" not seeing any presentation conventions belonging in an XML document (except maybey presentation instructions kept in a presentation element(s)).  </s>
<s> In this case, I would say the XML is not where the accessibility is addressed but in the presentation of the data kept therein.  </s>
<s> (accessible extensible stylesheets for example).  </s>
<s> A rhetorical question: Take the vector graphics work- how would one present this information in a way accessible to a blind user?  </s>
<s> I hope I'm not overstating the obvious, I'm just concerened that I don't understand "accessibility of XML documents", which seems like a very strange concept.  </s>
<s> -nick  </s>
<s> That's one point, yes.  </s>
<s> It's another issue, too.  </s>
<s> I (and others) maintain that properly  </s>
<s> done HTML means accessible HTML, and that means no need for a  </s>
<s> text-only copy.  </s>
<s> Three words: "Separate.  </s>
<s> But.  </s>
<s> Equal."  </s>
<s> You will people who very strongly consider the idea of "ghettoization" of the disabled to be a worse sin than inaccessible pages.  </s>
<s> While I am not quite so dogmatic about this, I can certainly see the point and I think there is an implicit assumption that "disabled folks cannot use the web as well as others can, therefore we need to make special accomodations for them" and that is insulting when in reality, NO SPECIAL ACCOMODATIONS ARE NEEDED, JUST PROPER APPLICATION OF HTML IN ALL CIRCUMSTANCES.  </s>

<s> And of course browsers which support the mechanisms available to make work those pages which require no text-only views.  </s>
<s> While they are getting better, I am (as I am sure many here are) disillusioned by the progress of both Microsoft and that other company that I can't remember at the moment (started with an N I think...).  </s>
<s> I am sure this has a lot to do with the fact that although it seems old hat to me, HTML4 and CSS etc... are young reccomendations.  </s>
<s> But this is a real problem right now- some (business) clients demand hacked HTML- in this case, text-only looks like a good solution, especially if you  </s>
<s> can do it without duplication.  </s>
<s> They aren't concerned that the AOL 3.0 browser that doesn't support CSS will render a page readable- they're concerned that it will render the page "ugly"- image is very important to them (though I do fight against 'marketing creep' as much as possible, in favor of accessible information).  </s>
<s> This is not so much a usability issue then as it is a political issue (not to imply political = not important).  </s>
<s> By offering a text-only view of a site, you  </s>
<s> are creating information ghettos.  </s>
<s> Interesting point- one I would not have  </s>
<s> considered, being disability-impaired.  </s>
<s> My view is that until everyone supports  </s>
<s> the proper application of HTML/CSS special accomodations may be neccessary for those web authors who must work within the constraints of a customer with high-visibility (actually the trick is getting them to constrain themselves).  </s>
<s> No problem, just as long as the voices aren't so loud that no one hears what is being said.  </s>
<s> -nick  </s>
<s> Except there are more browsers than just those two out there.  </s>
<s> If  </s>
<s> you consider the special needs of many users with disabilities, you'll find that they might very well not be using Netscape or MSIE.  </s>
<s> The web is meant to work with whatever client the user finds best suits his or her needs, right?  </s>
<s> Slap them around a little.  </s>
<s> If they're concerned about "ugly", introduce them to a screenreader and their eyes (or ears) will be opened.  </s>
<s> Load a demo version of pwWebSpeak, show them that they _cannot_ guarantee presentation of their pages EVER, and then let them hear how bad their site sounds in pwWS.  </s>
<s> Why is it okay to sound/look ugly to some people and not others?  </s>
<s> Why is are those people who you look awful to determine by their disability?  </s>
<s> Ugh!  </s>
<s> It's always something to consider, especially when we are making certain people feel like they're not the primary users of the site.  </s>
<s> That is TERRIBLE business sense.  </s>
<s> Read my "selfish reasons for accessible web design" at http://www.kynn.com/+selfish for a quote about how much money users with disabilities have to spend, and note that they'll spend it places where they feel welcome.  </s>
<s> To me, multiple views of a site are sorta like having two doors to a store.  </s>
<s> One is at the front, under the sign, with all the signs and people to greet you.  </s>
<s> The other one says "DISABLED ENTRANCE" and is around the side, with a ramp that leads up to a plainly marked door at the back of the store.  </s>
<s> If I were designing that building, I'd just make one big attractive door in the front, with a ramp up to it, that anyone could use.  </s>
<s> Wouldn't you?  </s>
<s> Then the accomodations are being made for the sucky browsers (MSIE, Netscape) -- so why are we making it look like there's something wrong with disabled folks?  </s>
<s> If I were blind, I would say, "The disability isn't that _I_ can't see the web -- the disability we're dealing with here is _your_ inability to create a good page.  </s>
<s> My disability doesn't prevent me from getting information -- yours does."  </s>
<s> I think the same thing applies here -- why not have two views of the site, one that reads "for REAL web browsers that can handle HTML correctly and accessibly" and the other labeled "for MSIE, Netscape, and other crappy browsers"?  </s>
<s> (Be careful with your answer, you may inadvertently state that it's better to alienate standards-compliant browser users and/or alienate disabled users!)  </s>

<s> Hmm, I'll have to be more careful answering this than the last question in this message, but the issue is well understood by all here, and is unfortunate (Bruce Bailey's followup which just appeard as I'm writing this eloquently addresses the issue in terms of segregation).  </s>
<s> It might work well to address this in terms of minorities- perhaps a poor word choice, but effective for this illustration.  </s>
<s> Those other browsers are the "minority" and they are so often cast aside as "inconsequential", though I keep stressing that customers would be surprised if they knew how many people browse their sites with Lynx.  </s>
<s> (not to mention so many of the 1000 or so others out there)  </s>
<s> YES! And this is what I have been realizing.  </s>
<s> I was once an HTML hacker myself, taking considerable pride in being able to get Netscape to do tricks it wasn't supposed to do- and the ironic thing is that this is, at first, what made people notice our work.  </s>
<s> So true with so many other HTML writers- and so unfortunate.  </s>
<s> Not until I "understood the WWW", i.e., understood the power of sharing information on a world-wide level, instead of looking at the WWW as an extension of television- as a "visual medium" did my HTML hacks disappear overnight.  </s>
<s> How do we get everyone to take advantage of the real strengths of the WWW?  </s>
<s> (And I'm getting horribly off topic).  </s>
<s> Something wrong, or something different?  </s>
<s> Different kind of person, different kind of site.  </s>
<s> I'm not saying that this is correct- but it seems the root of the text-only idea.  </s>
<s> When we discuss accessibility with a client, text-only versions are mentioned not only for use by the blind but also for slow connections, telephone/pda browsing etc... Besides, just becasue it is text doesn't mean its accessible to the blind anyway- consider (as I'm sure has been many times on this list) ALT attributes which refer to color.  </s>
<s> In reviewing the WAI guidelines, I noticed that 9 out of 10 items had little to do with HTML- most having to do with contextual issues- *writing* issues.  </s>
<s> This is a wonderful example of the "state of the art".  </s>
<s> Though very much out of context, I always want to parallelize the "Transistional" flavor of HTML with puberty.  </s>
<s> The issue is not simply accessiblity, but equal accessiblity.  </s>
<s> The answer to the above question is well-known and answering it the way it would be answered in most business cases threatens to incriminate me- MSIE/NN and all the other crappy browsers would win.  </s>
<s> My question would be  </s>
<s> "Do the crappy browser makers realize the urgency of getting the standards-compliant browsers out there?"  </s>
<s> -nick  </s>
<s> In general, no, although some of them pay lip service to it.  </s>
<s> I recently received email from Netscape gushing about how accessible Nav5 will be.  </s>
<s> I hope it will be, but in honesty, I'm not holding my breath.  </s>
<s> I have higher hopes for accessible browsers from ProdWorks, Opera, iCab, and others than I do from either of "big two" browsers.  </s>
<s> BTW, have you seen iCab?  </s>
<s> It's pretty nifty (I have it on the HWG's new mac) and it almost makes up for the fact that there's no Opera for Macintosh machines.  </s>
