<s> The more I read about BOS, ilink storage strategies, multi-pass XML parsing etc. the more I see a tension between client-side and server-side implementation of XML processing.  </s>
<s> I mean, an XML document - as authored - might perhaps have ilinks spread willy-nilly but that does not mean it has to be served to the client in that form.  </s>
<s> Equally, AF processing could be organised for maximum authoring convenience in the "raw" XML document and then SPAMM'ed to attributes before  </s>
<s> the client sees it.  </s>
<s> The disadvantages of server side processing have already been discussed on this list.  </s>
<s> The advantages, in terms of simplicity, for XML browser tools however, would surely be significant.  </s>
<s> What I am trying to get at is that XML docs as seen by the client can either be "raw" XML or "cooked" XML that simplifies (and speeds up!) client-side implementation.  </s>
<s> Cooked in terms of AFs.  </s>
<s> Cooked in terms of BOS.  </s>
<s> Cooked in terms of ... The transition from raw to cooked - if done at the server side - does not complicate the client.  </s>
<s> Simple client - more complex servers.  </s>
<s> Having said  </s>
<s> that, BOS (I like DJD's term "document working set") or multiple parsing of XML docs, will be, IMO, kinda tough on the client end.  </s>
<s> Analogies abound.  </s>
<s> The first that springs to mind is the difference between a networked database application that downloads records looking for matches and one that sends SQL to the server and retrieves matching records only.  </s>
<s> Whether or not cooked XML is an option seems to me to depend on what client are advised to do with XML docs over an above browsing.  </s>
<s> Are they intended to be thrown away NC style or harvested once for local re-use?  </s>
<s> For throwaway docs, cooked is fine.  </s>
<s> For harvesting, cooked is perhaps, far from fine.  </s>

<s> Simple browsers will be useless without any data to feed them.  </s>
<s> Only Gavin has emerged to defend the notion that the server infrastructure of the WWW is likely to change significantly to accomodate XML.  </s>
<s> I don't believe that enough specialized servers (or custom cgi-scripts, for that matter) will be deployed to make XML a going venture.  </s>
<s> For someone who wants to deploy XML in a restricted environment (like Sun's documentation viewers, for instance) it will be easy to create the custom server, and simple client to talk to it.  </s>
<s> But if we want to affect the WWW as a whole, we need to slot XML into as much of the current infrastructure as we can, as a data format like all the others out there, so it can win on its own merits.  </s>
<s> I see nothing that prevents a server from providing custom normalized data streams or fancy address resolution as desired, even if we define  </s>
<s> things in terms of nominal client processing.  </s>
<s> But I see real problems with wide XML acceptance if we make definitions that require specialized server just to put up XML documents.  </s>
<s> I'm also not convinced that the problems we are proposing that clients be able to solve are very difficult.  </s>
<s> To get XML established we need just one of the two big browser vendors to devote their (quite massive) resources to a client implementation.  </s>
<s> The other will then probably have to  </s>
<s> follow suit, and we will be in good shape.  </s>
<s> Even the most ambitious proposals we've made are not beyond Netscape and Microsoft's reach, I think.  </s>
<s> If we factor in the 3-10 significant server platforms as well, we have a real opportunity to slow XML acceptance.  </s>
<s> Why is it hard to keep more than one abstract syntax tree around?  </s>
<s> sounds like a hash table from docnames to pointers to me.  </s>
<s> This is a misleading analogy, If only because of the difference in scale factors between the database example (frequently 1000s-100,000s of records) and the typical document examples (I imagine 1-5 documents as the typical numbers of documents parsed in parallel on almost any reasonable scenarios).  </s>
<s> We're not talking about search, but essentially an author guided form of pre-caching.  </s>
<s> Equivalents to ilink are a standard staple of proposals to extend the web -- I've seen at least 3-5 in the last year and a half, and I don't spend any time looking for them, either.  </s>
<s> Seems to me that the current client-cache model is already "harvesting" and that the XML BOS stuff fits into that pretty nicely.  </s>
<s> But note that nothing prevents a server from cooking documents now (and people do) or in the future, reagardless of how we define things.  </s>
<s> I think the extra work will be worth it because of the power that separately stored links can give -- the other things strike me as easy once you do the work to handle separate links at all.  </s>
<s> For XML to fly at all, the code for all this processing has to be written by someone, anyway, whether this happens at the server, or the client doesn't seem to make that much difference, but...  </s>
<s> I don't see any technical reason that we _have_ to move things to the servers (or that failing to do it now prevents us from doing it later, once XML is regarded as essential by the whole world).  </s>
<s> And I see real practical drawbacks to requiring new code to be deployed on servers _as well_ as clients.  </s>
<s> KISS is good, but if we can't offer benefits over HTML, we may look stupid, since HTML has already got simple all wrapped up (and deployed).  </s>
<s> We already have significant benefits to offer for docuemnt representation, but I think we should offer linking benefits to match them... -- David I am not a number.  </s>

<s> I believe though, that support for other HTML semantics (e.g., SCRIPT, OBJECT, APPLET - elements whose be behavior can't be replicated with just a stylesheet) will need to be included as well.  </s>
<s> In other words, an XML browser would default to the HTML-defined content model  </s>
<s> and behavior associated with these elements.  </s>
<s> If you want something else, you have to *override* that behavior, either through a stylesheet or by specifying compliance with an architectural form.  </s>
<s> Regards, Ralph E. Ferris Project Manager, Electronic Publications Fujitsu Software Corporation  </s>
<s> I am hoping that MS participation in this group, and their desire to hotfoot Netscape with standards means that IE will implement XML support -- it's sure easy, and they already have a start on stylesheets.  </s>
<s> Following is a long list of questions amounting to: "How do I easily start with current HTML capabilities, and use XML instead, getting additional capabilities without forgetting what I already know about HTML tags?"  </s>
<s> The answer is that you download the XML version of the HTML DTD, and the default stylesheet that implememts those features.  </s>
<s> Anything you want to leave unchanged, you leave unchanged, and anything you want to change, you change.  </s>
<s> Thus XML does not have to have HTML tags built-in, but we can still make the HTML- XML transition easy.  </s>
<s> The points about form and applet semantics are very good, however.  </s>
<s> We must not forget that these must fit into our stylesheet language somehow.  </s>
<s> But we should stay away from namespace pollution, if we can possibly manage it, though.  </s>

<s> I don't consider my proposal to be "namespace pollution."  </s>
<s> I consider it to be method over-riding, in the manner of object-oriented programming.  </s>
<s> The HTML "tags" I mentioned - FORM, APPLET, SCRIPT, OBJECT - are much closer conceptually to method invocations that they are to "conventional" SGML elements.  </s>
<s> I don't believe their behavior can be defined in a stylesheet - unless the stylesheet has a string saying, in effect, "Default: HTML."  </s>
<s> One solution is to define these tags as architecural forms, and make these architectural forms part of a default set that's used by XML.  </s>
<s> The limitation in using architectural forms is that they only allow behavior to be expressed as "conventional comments."  </s>
<s> (SMSL is supposed address this, but SMSL isn't here yet).  </s>
<s> Pre-defined interfaces with over-rideable methods are what make component software work.  </s>
<s> Call these "component DTDs."  </s>

<s> This issue has been raised several times on the list.  </s>
<s> In MID, we set up the xeno element types.  </s>
<s> For XML, we could use arc forms.  </s>
<s> Whatever: o Should XML spec an API? o Should we adopt the object/embed conventions?  </s>
<s> o OLE/COM or Corba?  </s>
<s> Kick all anyone cares to, but OLE/COM works very nicely in VB4.  </s>

<s> This may not seem like a big deal if there is only one predefined element type ("use any GI you like, as long as it's not ALINK") but if, as I suspect, there end up being many different XML sub-architectures each with its own collection of forms, protecting authors from unforeseen nameclashes will be important.  </s>

<s> A formalism for declaring a document's derivation from an architecture or architectures is defined in the forthcoming HyTime TC (largely as documented for the architecture processing support in the latest releases of SP).  </s>
<s> Unfortunately, the full form of these mechanisms depend on the use of data attributes ( !ATTLIST #NOTATION archname ... ), which means that XML documents cannot use the full form unless we add notation attributes to XML.  </s>
<s> However, the minimal part of the declaration simply uses a processing instruction to indicate which architectures are in use, e.g.: !DOCTYPE MyDoc [ ] Where the name "ArcBase" is effectively normative as XML doesn't allow SGML declarations, which is where you would change the name of the PI (don't you love indirection?).  </s>
<s> A full architecture processor then expects to see notation declarations corresponding to the architectures named (e.g., !NOTATION MyArc PUBLIC "..." ) with notation attributes defining the document-specific values for the architecture control attributes.  </s>
<s> The architecture control attributes are needed to do renaming, specify options used, and so on.  </s>
<s> However, since these attributes can all have default values, you could always derive an XML-specific version of your architecture that set the default values to something appropriate for XML use, following the XML philosophy that no options are good options.  </s>
<s> Thus the notation attribute declarations would be superfluous because the architecture engine for each such architecture would know what its base default values are because they would be built in.  </s>
<s> Thus, I could have: !DOCTYPE MyDoc [ !NOTATION XML-Link PUBLIC "-//W3C::SGML ERB//NOTATION XML Link Architecture//EN" !NOTATION XML-MyArc PUBLIC "-//ME//NOTATION My Architecture, XML Profile//EN" !NOTATION XML-InfoMaster PUBLIC "+//ISBN 0-189773::IBM//NOTATION InfoMaster Architecture, XML Profile//EN" ] It would conform to the ISO/IEC 10744 requirements and fit within the XML constraints.  </s>
<s> The notation declarations could be considered superfluous in this case as the PI is sufficient to identify the architectures as long as the names used are normative.  </s>
<s> In the general case, you can use whatever name you want because the architecture is actually identified by the external ID of the notation you declare.  </s>
<s> However, we tend to expect the notation names to be used consistently.  </s>
<s> Or, you could consider the names in the ArcBase PI to imply notation declarations with omitted system identifiers if no notation declaration is present, at which point things like catalog lookup come into play and you could put the name-to-public ID mapping in an external catalog if necessary (which it's probably not 99.99% of the time).  </s>
