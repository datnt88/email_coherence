This just in... 
I'm noodling on whether it's sufficient new information for me to reconsider my position on I encourage others to do likewise. 
DanBri, perhaps we could discuss this under 7: Document Status 7f: Concepts Dan Connolly, W3C http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/ 
I don't think there's any new information there (in the first three points) that we didn't have when we considered this during LC. (FWIW, I have considered my position on #rdfms-literal-is-xml-structure, but I don't plan to say anything more unless it comes up for discussion.) #g Graham Klyne With regards to rdfms-literal-is-xml-structure there is IMO absolutely nothing new here. 
The wrapper proposal that they suggest is (a) an earlier design that we discussed in great length and (b) not the kind of solution that we should be responsible for, as it concerns the general problem of capturing contextual information of arbitrary XML fragments -- and if/when the XML community agree on a standardized solution to that problem, it will work flawlessly with our present design. 
I'm not the least motivated to reopen this issue.
