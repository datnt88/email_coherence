First, my apologies for not being on the telecon today - I have several tasks due tomorrow, and will be pleasantly surprised if I actually complete them both. 
Ian has asked me to comment on the topic of 'standard API' as it relates to 6.6. 
I am unable to add anything to Rich's comments on this, and agree with him completely. 
For all the reasons he gave, the implementation of standard API's is critical to interoperability, which in turn is core to creating an accessible web experience. 
One thing I used to hear over and over again from AT vendors was that they had to special-case everything in order to work with all the different DOM's (not just www, but all application DOM's). 
By going to standard API's (and in our case, implementing API improvements based on AT vendor feedback), this problem is finally starting to diminish. 
The key is that the programmatic interface between the AT and the system needs to be robust, full-featured, rigorously tested, and widely adopted. 
I am unaware of any 'custom' API's that even come close to this. 
My dos centavos, anyway.

the rsvp I got says the meeting is tomorrow?
