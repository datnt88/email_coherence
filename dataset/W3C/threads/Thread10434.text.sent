(with apologies for slight delay) Agenda: Transcript: orhttp://www.ilrt.org/discovery/chatlogs/rdfcore/2003-02-14.txt 
Roll call: Participants - Dave Beckett Mike Dean Jos deRoo Jan Grant (scribe) Pat Hayes Frank Manola Brian McBride (chair) Eric Miller Aaron Swartz Regrets - Dan Brickley, Jeremy Carroll, Dan Connolly, Patrick Stickler, Graham Klyne Review agenda: No AOB tabled. 
Next telecon: 28 Feb 2003, scribe Eric Miller [Note the bridge on the 21st will probably be used for RDF-in-HTML discussions, see below] Minutes of last telecon: With correction: Mike Dean also present APPROVED Item 6: XML Schema 1.1 Requirements ACTION 2003-02-14#1 (daveb) respond immediately to XML Schema 1.1 with a date for "we'll get back to you" ACTION 2003-02-14#2 (daveb) liase with jjc to work up a response on the XML Schema 1.1 requirements Item 7: RDF in HTML ACTION 2003-02-14#3 (em) set up a discussion between RDFCore and (x)HTML, with the objective to understand each other on the subject of "RDF in HTML" Item 8: WebOnt update Jos gave a pointer to a recent summary: Eric added Some discussion, no actions (see transcript) Item 9: Actions from last week On action 2003-02-07#3: DaveB dropped "node labelled with URIref" from syntax some time ago. 
Summary of the terminological confromance we're seeking: Brian: "The key [terminological] thing is to ensure that the subject of a triple is a URIref, not a resource" ACTION 2003-02-14#4 (bwm) [sorry for vague record of action] terminology: check "a resource" [in schema?] 
Item 10: Format of references in documents Summary of how to do inter-document references: Eric: "Please make the links into the DATED versions of documents" ACTION 2003-02-14#5 (em) Follup to -core with a definitive summary (recipie?) for the format of inter-document references On referring to externally-authored documents (low priority): Brian: "if you DO tidy these up, please conform to the pattern in the Primer and Semantics" Item 11: Responses to comments LC comment period ends next week, it'd be good to be on top of things by then. 
PLEASE check the brief weekly conspectus - especially for items requiring followup, needing clarification, etc. Item 12: Schedule for processing comments Most WG members could commit to the schedule (particularly the two-hour telecons), although PatH wasn't around on the 18th or thereabouts. 
ACTION 2003-02-14#6 (bwm) update schedule page to reflect the current plan; seek feedback from the missing editors at today's telecon The meeting closed with "Dirty Frank" Manola advising Eric on suitable "persuaders" :-) jan grant, ILRT, University of Bristol.

I shave with Occam's Razor. 
I'm afraid I was only partially successful re this action item. 
Organizing an informal discussion in place of Friday's teleconference was not possible. 
As such I suggest that we (the small few that were able to make it) cancel this teleconference. 
It does look, however, like we'll be able to allocate some collective time at the tech plenary. 
The current plan is to identify a time that is conducive to both the HTML and Semantic Web meetings, open up the wall partition separating the two meetings and have a structured discussion on the issues. 
I'll post the details of this time and discussion as soon as they are locked down.

Well, that's an idea that's been suggested. 
I think there's a lot of risk associated with it. 
Don't put too many eggs in that basket, please. 
Has anybody offered to run the session, EricM? 
We have 40+ people registered for the SemWeb arch meeting. 
Too many to make useful progress on an issue like this, IMO. 
Perhaps a break-out on this topic would work or something.

That sounds like a good idea. 
Are there other breakouts planned, e.g. social meaning? 
Brian Meanwhile, a volunteer to run the session has emerged... 10:45 - 12:15 Second morning session RDF and HTML - Ralph Swick * Syntactic Inclusion (e.g. RDF/XML in XHTML, PNG, PDF, Mpeg, etc.) * background: RDF in HTML: Approaches -- http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/meetings/tech-200303/ DRAFT $Revision: 1.22 $ of $Date: 2003/02/10 22:01:18 $ We're not planning any break-outs at this time; Jeremy's running the session on social meaning: 16:00 - 18:00 Second afternoon session formal meaning meets social context J. Carroll, RDF Concepts co-editor, has volunteered to lead a discussion; see the call for position statements of 13Feb.

It's still possible we'll rearrange the times, but things are generally converging/stabilizing.
