<s> Hello, I believe what you are describing would be of extremely limited value in terms of accessibility.  </s>
<s> Just about anyone with the ability to navigate to your web page is already going to have the necessary equipment to display your web page in the fashion desired, be that auditory or some other means.  </s>
<s> The small part of the population that wouldn't have such capabilities would require some method of directly navigating to your site, not to mention launching the web browser and getting connected to the net.  </s>

<s> I'm new to the list and accessibility issues and will briefly introduce myself.  </s>
<s> My name is Michelle Podd and I am a Web Designer in Canada for a relatively new Internet company.  </s>
<s> I've been asked to research the issue of Accessiblility for two reasons: the first is that we want to make all of our sites accessible and second, we are creating a portal site for the purpose of being a mass resource for people with vision and hearing impairments to reach the many resources out there, to learn, to find SAP programming schedules for their area, etc.  </s>
<s> The infant site uses an audio embed with a Play / Stop area - the default is Off.  </s>
<s> I believe it's purpose was to provide anyone, anywhere with the ability to have the content read to them in a human-type voice (we use iSpeak from Fonix Corp)without having to have any special hardware or software on their end - besides a sound card and speakers, of course.  </s>
<s> Anyway, in my research travels, I'm learning that disabled persons surfing the web will most likely have what they need on their end to do so.  </s>
<s> Besides, this equipment is used in all of their other computer applications - the internet is just one of them.  </s>
<s> This project recently fell in my lap and the manager who originally created this vision is no longer with us so I'm not able to inquire about some of the decisions he made.  </s>
<s> I'd like to provide quality guidance to my company as well as meet the needs of the disabled web surfer.  </s>
<s> So my question to the list is this: Is the use of an audio embed (with an on/off switch) that reads the content of the web page a help or a hinderance to accessibility?  </s>
<s> Is there an audience for this type of application?  </s>
<s> Thank you in advance for your help in this matter.  </s>

<s> Is there an audience for this type of application?  </s>
<s> Assuming it's coded sensibly, it's roughly neutral, but tends to be more  </s>
<s> of a "help" than a "hindrance".  </s>
<s> It's usually true that most users with  </s>
<s> special needs have assistive technology, but not always.  </s>
<s> There are certain  </s>
<s> user groups -- e.g. people who can't read as well -- who could benefit from what you describe.  </s>
<s> The whole trick is in the "coding sensibly" caveat.  </s>

<s> As a partial answer to your question, you may want to refer to an article written by Jeff Isom of WebAIM entitled "To Embed or Not To Embed - A Comparison of Media Player Technologies ".  </s>

<s> I want to amend this.  </s>
<s> It's usually true that most _blind_ users have assistive technology, or  </s>
<s> at least that they would need it to get that far.  </s>
<s> Without some sort of  </s>
<s> assistive tech (screenreader, etc) won't be able to get to your web site  </s>
<s> in the first place; simply starting an application (such as a web browser) would be next to impossible.  </s>
<s> However, it's also usually true that most users who have _other_ disabilities likely _don't_ have an appropriate assistive technology program or device.  </s>
<s> In this case, talking about the benefits of an audio track, there are two groups who would benefit from such a thing: 1.  </s>
<s> People who can't see the text.  </s>
<s> 2. People who can't read the text.  </s>
<s> The first group are the blind users; these are the ones who _probably_ already have a solution, in the form of a screenreader (or Braille terminal or whatever).  </s>
<s> The second group includes a NUMBER of people -- adult non-readers, people reading in a foreign language, children, and people with cognitive disabilities that prevent them from being able to read text easily, but who may be able to understand spoken words -- or spoken words PLUS text -- easier than text alone.  </s>
<s> These audiences overwhelmingly do NOT have access to screenreaders and the like, and for those people, embedded audio would indeed prove beneficial.  </s>
<s> So while I make the correction above, I still stand by my suggestion that you not remove this, as it could help some people.  </s>
