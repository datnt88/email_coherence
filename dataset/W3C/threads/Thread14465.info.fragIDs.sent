<s> Hi, Wendy While I agree that research into most effective user interface for  </s>
<s> people who are blind is definitely needed, it is a fair amount of research of research.  </s>
<s> I think there are some key differences between how blind people and sighted people use web pages which affect the design of the web pages.  </s>
<s> By doing some research into these key differences, it would be possible significantly improve the accessibility of the web pages for blind people.  </s>
<s> The resulting web pages may not be the absolute most optimal, but could be substantially better without expending considerable resources for comprehensive research.  </s>
<s> For example, one key difference has to do with how sighted people can skip over sections of a web page where blind people may have to read through a fair amount of the page before reaching the sections of the page which have the most semantically significant information.  </s>
<s> A web page designed for a blind user should have the information roughly in order of semantic importance.  </s>
<s> Decisions of this type can only be performed by a human being or a server appropriately programmed.  </s>
<s> I think that identifying the ways that blind users can get confused, lost on the page, be inefficient or inaccurate, etc, could be very helpful to know.  </s>
<s> While doing additional research into the various combinations of user agent and access technology could be useful in the disabled world, I'm not quite sure how the information would be applied in the real world of web developers.  </s>
<s> While it might be possible to get web developers to create a couple alternate types of web pages for blind people and other people with disabilities, it is doubtful that they would be willing to address issues created by the various combinations of user agent and access technology.  </s>
<s> I agree that the issue is not dynamic versus static delivery.  </s>
<s> The introduction of dynamic just opens up more opportunities than were easily achievable through static means.  </s>
<s> I would probably expand the fundamental research question from blind people accessing information to accessing and interacting with the information.  </s>
<s> The issue of interaction is going to be more critical as the web pages act more and more like GUI's rather than just magazine pages with hyperlinks to other pages.  </s>
<s> The feedback I've gotten so far has been fairly consistent on my demo.  </s>
<s> Some people are surprised at how a some simple changes can improve using the web pages.  </s>
<s> One problem that I have with my methodology is that the original analysis was based on just my observations.  </s>
<s> I'm usually uncomfortable when there is only one observer.  </s>
<s> From my experience, when there are multiple observers each brings an awareness of certain aspects that other observers may miss.  </s>
<s> What I would like is if a small team of observers watched different blind people using web pages to identify what problems they hand and why.  </s>
<s> One possibility, if the observers are in different locations, is for each observer to watch few different blind users.  </s>
<s> Then the observers could compare notes to see if there are patterns and to learn from each other.  </s>
<s> The each observer would watch a few more blind users.  </s>
<s> The group of observers could again compare notes and see what conclusions they could come up with.  </s>
<s> Some of the problems can be addressed by user agents / assistive technology.  </s>
<s> For example, building a mechanism into a user agent to help identify when the user has reached the end of a form.  </s>
<s> Most of the user agent issues I've passed onto the user agent group for them to use as they choose.  </s>
<s> Other accessibility issues can only be addressed in the web page.  </s>
<s> Most of what I've done in my demo has been with regards to the semantic content of the web page.  </s>
<s> For example, organizing the web page roughly in order of importance of each semantic sub-unit.  </s>
<s> Or providing a mechanism which displays the order of semantic sub-units (rather than the order of HTML elements).  </s>
<s> Again, because of the semantic nature of the decisions made in creating the blind version of the web page, user agents and access technology would have a hard time making similar decisions.  </s>
<s> I believe that there are other features which could be built into web pages to help blind users.  </s>
<s> Another technique I've been looking at is providing special links on a web page with a form which has entries with errors.  </s>
<s> The special links would link one form entry with an error to the next form entry with an error.  </s>
<s> This would make it much easier for a blind user to correct errors on a form.  </s>
<s> More work into other possible features is needed.  </s>
<s> In the situation where dynamically generated web pages provide versions for sighted and blind users, I believe that it would be reasonable to  </s>
<s> expect that the sighted version much fewer of the priority 1 items, if any.  </s>
<s> This would be the carrot for web page developers to offer a blind version of dynamically generated web pages.  </s>
<s> They would have much more flexibility in the sighted versions.  </s>
<s> (Did I hear a collective gasp?  </s>
<s> smile )  </s>
<s> Because of what I'm suggesting, there might need to be changes in both the guidelines and the techniques.  </s>
<s> I kind of disagree with your view of this being as much a future issue as you might be perceiving.  </s>
<s> I believe that there are certain aspects which are pretty current, e.g. structure of the web page.  </s>
<s> One thing that has been somewhat bothering me is that the feedback I've gotten on my demo web page has been pretty much from blind people not involved with the guidelines.  </s>
<s> The blind people involved with the guidelines haven't seem to take the time to look at the demo.  </s>
<s> Since I come from a very user-centered approach, I always prefer to hear both the good and the bad from a wide range of users.  </s>
<s> It is the way something improves.  </s>
<s> I will give some thought to a proposal which will come from the various views I've mentioned here.  </s>
<s> In your fourth point you mentioned formal testing and research as a way discovering developing general principles.  </s>
<s> This may not be the best way, depending on your definition of formal.  </s>
<s> I'd start off with making observations first.  </s>
<s> Some observations might bring out priniciples so obvious that further testing is not necessary.  </s>
<s> In other situations, the obversations hint at possible principles which need to be teased out and confirmed by testing.  </s>
<s> Scott  </s>
<s> I think the underlying argument that Scott is presenting is that someone needs to research, develop, and test the most effective user interface for people who are blind.  </s>
<s> The discussions of this issue have been confusing because we have been looking at solutions without clearly stating the question.  </s>
<s> If the question is, "what is the most effective user interface for a person who is blind to access the Web?" I don't believe we can point to a widely used, concrete solution.  </s>
<s> There are many variables involved: 1. user agents, 2. assistive technologies, 3. individual differences and preferences, 4. various markup solutions, 5. technological changes over time, 6. combinations of all of these variables.  </s>
<s> The crux of this issue is not dynamic versus static delivery.  </s>
<s> There are two issues: 1. fundamental research in how people who are blind access information is a research question that needs to be answered.  </s>
<s> 2. what is possible today and what is expected to be possible in the future are very different.  </s>
<s> Scott, your experience watching users who are blind access your example pages is very useful.  </s>
<s> I would like to see your results generalized and not interspersed with proposed solutions.  </s>
<s> We need usability information on individual differences of people with disabilities.  </s>
<s> This information could greatly improve how user agents and assistive technologies support user interaction with information.  </s>
<s> Dynamically generated pages is a technique to address a current need.  </s>
<s> I believe many folks on this list are anticipating future needs and are reluctant to press authors to do so much work today that they will not need to do in the future.  </s>
<s> However, there is also the need of people who need to access information em today /em .  </s>
<s> Although, Scott is primarily addressing an ease of use issue (priority 3 or priority 2) and we still have lots of work to do to bring the Web into conformance with at least Priority 1 items.  </s>
<s> The future is an idealistic place where user agents and assistive technologies work seamlessly together to provide an easy to use auditory user interface (or braille user interface) that is not confined by or an interpretation of the graphical user interface.  </s>
<s> Therefore I propose that the following things happen: 1. Scott, please write a proposal for the WCAG techniques document that uses W3C technologies to create dynamically generated pages.  </s>
<s> I anticipate that this proposal will include example markup as well as general information about how to structure the page (formed from the results from your observations).  </s>
<s> Look at CC/PP [1] to see if this is in synch with your ideas.  </s>
<s> Some mobile groups are already using gateways to perform XSLT transformations based on device type.  </s>
<s> Show us how to do something similar based on a user profile of preferences.  </s>
<s> 2. People have been investigating auditory user interfaces for years (see the International Community for Auditory Display (ICAD) [2] for more information).  </s>
<s> We need to ensure that the User Agents working group is aware of these projects.  </s>
<s> (However, none of these have caught on like the GUI.  </s>
<s> I anticipate we will see more auditory user interfaces with the adoption of mobile applications).  </s>
<s> Therefore, the discussion of this topic is best suited for the UA working group list.  </s>
<s> 3. What about research into braille user interfaces?  </s>
<s> Off the top of my head I can not think of any research projects that have investigated this.  </s>
<s> What am I forgetting?  </s>
<s> Again, the UA working group list is a better venue for this discussion.  </s>
<s> 4. It would be great if we could verify Scott's results or discover other general principles with formal testing and research.  </s>
<s> Any volunteers?  </s>
<s> I believe the WAI Interest Group list is the best venue for this discussion.  </s>
<s> 5. People need to document observations of people with various disabilities accessing the Web.  </s>
<s> This information is valuable for several reasons: a. we need to identify the technological problems - is this an assistive technology problem, a user agent problem, or a problem with the markup?  </s>
<s> Once identified we can pass the problem on to the appropriate group/organization.  </s>
<s> Some of this information is appropriate for our user agent support page.  </s>
<s> This topic spans both this list and the UA working group list.  </s>
<s> b. where there are general principles that we can apply to user agents or page markup, we need to pass that information on to the appropriate group/organization.  </s>
<s> thoughts?  </s>

<s> It seems to me that the issue is linear versus nonlinear approaches to accessing information.  </s>
<s> It seems that most everything flows from that distinction.  </s>
<s> Screen readers provide some options for skipping around a web page(JAWS has a feature so that users can jump quickly jump around between links on a page) -- but skipping around also assumes that the user already has some idea about what information is provided on a particular page.  </s>
<s> While I agree that there is certainly a need for more research on usability issues, there are companies with many years of experience designing interfaces for blind users (such as my own, Duxbury Systems) which are also designed to be highly functional for sighted persons.  </s>
<s> I realize that the web presents different challenges than DOS or Windows applications, but the issues are not entirely different.  </s>
<s> Bringing folks from Henter-Joyce or GW Micro (makers of leading screen readers) into this discussion could possibly be very fruitful -- as they have spent years examining the issue of how to make the web accessible to blind users.  </s>
<s> Our own experience redesigning our corporate website (which we hope will go live within the next month) has reaffirmed my belief that visually appealing design and accessibility can co-exist harmoniously.  </s>
<s> While I share the goal of wanting to give users exactly what they want (versus what I think they need) -- I am not optimistic that mainstream web developers will avoid the trap of having their primo pages for sighted persons and their "charity" pages for all other persons.  </s>
<s> Are we venturing into the "separate but equal" zone here --- I am not sure that we are, but I think we should tread carefully.  </s>
<s> That's it for now.  </s>
