In the process of preparing a draft of the spec for full standard, (yes, Petunia, we should get this puppy to full standard someday, hopefully soon) and checking updated references, I uncovered the following inconsistency: RFC 1766, which is referenced by RFC 2616 section 3.10 as the source for its definition of language tags has a BNF has been updated by RFC3066 (a BCP). 
RFC 3066 defines these as: Language-Tag = Primary-subtag *( "-" Subtag ) Primary-subtag = 1*8ALPHA Subtag = 1*8(ALPHA / DIGIT) HTTP/1.1 RFC 2616 defines these as: language-tag = primary-tag *( "-" subtag ) primary-tag = 1*8ALPHA subtag = 1*8ALPHA Is there any danger in relaxing the HTTP BNF to remove the inconsistency (the hob-goblin of small minds :-))?

HP Labs, Cambridge Research Laboratory I think that would be safe - I doubt anyone is depending on there not being digits in there, and even if they are, the fallback rules should make them match on the less-specific primary tag. 
Scott Lawrence No danger -- it may even be possible to replace them with a reference to the new RFC if it is now a BCP.
