<s> This is a very interesting question to me, right now, because I am currently writing about the Action Sheets modularized scripting for HTML and XML proposal (paraphrase on purpose) from Netscape, and I'm having trouble swallowing this (from the spec) can anyone help me to understand if this is true or maybe how it was meant to be taken (and yes I've tried the Netscape guys first....)  </s>
<s> While HTML contains a SCRIPT element and HTML elements may contain attributes that specify event handlers (onClick, onMouseOver, etc.), XML contains no way of including an external scripting language.  </s>

<s> You might want to check out the AHDM which we presented at this year's WWW conference: Right now, we are building a reference implementation and parts of this are already finished (though the code is more or less still in an alpha stage).  </s>
<s> The basic building block for the AHDM is the Kino 2 widget, which handles XML, most of CSS1 and DOM-like access and modification.  </s>
<s> Future work would include the usage of namespaces, but we are still waiting for the specification to settle down a bit.  </s>
