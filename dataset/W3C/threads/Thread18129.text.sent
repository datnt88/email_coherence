Dear all, I have had meetings with some developers this week, most notably from Internet Explorer and Real Player. 
With luck we will have a rough conformance evaluation from each of those groups, but there were some checkpoints that raised questions, so I am listing those here. 
(They have the same order as in the checklist of the 25 january draft). 
Charles Checkpoint 2.2: For presentations that require user interaction within a specified time interval, allow the user to configure the time interval Does a pause function satisfy this? 
Checkpoint 3.3: allow the user to turn on and off rendering of video In a window-based environment, is it satisfactory to hide the rendering window, or does there have to be control over the video rendering separately to other parts (e.g. caption track) Checkpoint 4.5: Allow the user to slow the rate of audio, video and animations In the case of animations, does this mean a requirement to step through or slow the speed as well as being able to turn it off? 
(My own thought is yes - if there is content in an animation it is important to step through it). 
CHeckpoint 7.2: For user agents that offer a browsing history mechanism, when the user returns to a previous viewport restore the point of regard in the viewport. 
In a timed presentation does this mean return to the time that the user was at (where possible - it wouldn't necessairly work in live streaming for example) Checkpoint 1.5: Ensure that the uesr interfaces provides information through redundant output modes This could be worded a bit more clearly. 
Checkpoint 6.2: Conform to W3C specifications when they are appropriate for a task It is a bit unclear how to verify when the specification is appropriate to the task. 
Is the requirement to conform to the specification, or is it to use appropriate W3C specifications for graphics if you render graphics, or is it both requirements? 
(Actually, if it means use W3C specifications does it mean exclusively, or does it mean include handlig of those?) Checkpoint 10.7: Allow the user to configure the User agent through a profile It is not clear what the minimum satisfaction is - allowing the user to configure their name? 
The window size? 
at least both of those? 
Use a local CSS stylesheet? 
Checkpoint 8.4: Make available to the user information that will help the user decide whether to follow the link. 
Does this mean make available all the information the tool has? 
Or just some of it? 
Checkpoint 10.8: Provide default input configurations for frequently performed tasks There is by definition a default input configuration. 
The wording of the checkpoint itself (rather than the additional information) should make it explicit that what is required is a "simple, obvious, rapid method" to activate the functionality. 
Charles, Was there any questions reguarding checkpoint 5.5 on timely access?

There was a significant question on how to verify it. 
Everyone claimed to provide it, but it was unclear exactly what the functional requirement was. 
Charles Charles, Was there any questions reguarding checkpoint 5.5 on timely access? 
Jon Thanks Charles. 
My comments below. 
The note in the checkpoint says it does. 
Was the question whether that really addresses the issue? 
My first reaction is that hiding does suffice (the issue is distraction, isn't it? 
Not one of performance where you might want to stop the processor from handling video). 
If the caption is part of the video (i.e., a single track with both), I don't know how you could still have the captions if you turn off the video. 
If there are separate tracks, you should be able to view captions alone. 
Yes. 
One question: do you think it's a violation of a spec (e.g., GIF) to control the rate of the animation? 
Note that our applicability clause would cover this case; the user agent doesn't have access to the properties of the content (i.e., might not be able to regulate the speed). 
If the technology doesn't allow, then the requirement wouldn't apply. 
Otherwise that's a good point and should be mentioned in the techniques. 
Any suggestions? 
I think it's both. 
I propose this clarification: "Use and conform to W3C specifications when they are available and appropriate for a task." 
We could drop the conformance part, but the whole reason we're pushing them is that they promote interoperability and have accessibility built-in. 
If you don't conform, what's the point? 
I do recognize that conformance is hard in some cases. 
It makes that the conformance part is P2. 
As to the exclusive part, I don't think that's implied. 
However, for checkpoint 11.1 we do make the clarification that there must be "at least one" version of the documentation that's accessible. 
We might make a similar clarification in the checkpoint or a note after. 
That is true. 
A couple of ideas: 1) Demote to P3 and the text as is. 
2) Identify the key requirements, for example presentation and input configuration. 
Since it's a P3, why not all of it? 
I propose the following clarification: 1) I think "a default input configuration" makes more sense than "default input configurations" since there is only one default. 
Even if several modes may be covered (voice, keyboard, etc.), there's still only one default input configuration. 
2) Every browser comes with a default configuration. 
What are we requiring exactly? 
I propose that a) Either we drop this checkpoint, or b) We make the requirement much more specific. 
For example: "Ensure that the default configuration allows the user to navigate content and user interface controls simply, obviously, and quickly." - Ian Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org) http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs Cell: +1 917 450-8783 My new comments interspersed and marked CMN (my old ones all start with checkpint x.y) within a  specified time interval, allow the user to configure the time interval   Does a pause function satisfy this? 
IJ The note in the checkpoint says it does. 
Was the question whether that really addresses the issue? 
CMN Actually this one was raised in a rushed look through the checklist. 
As I recall it wasn't clear that pause was sufficient. 
IJ My first reaction is that hiding does suffice (the issue is distraction, isn't it? 
Not one of performance where you might want to stop the processor from handling video). 
If the caption is part of the video (i.e., a single track with both), I don't know how you could still have the captions if you turn off the video. 
If there are separate tracks, you should be able to view captions alone. 
CMN This sounds sensible to me. 
IJ Yes. 
One question: do you think it's a violation of a spec (e.g., GIF) to control the rate of the animation? 
Note that our applicability clause would cover this case; the user agent doesn't have access to the properties of the content (i.e., might not be able to regulate the speed). 
CMN I don't think it is a violation of the spec to control the final behaviour, since we are not altering the actual content, and since it is still possible to render it as specified where that is desired. 
Except in a live presentation, where they only possiblity may be to use a stop-motion approach (leading, at the right speed, to that rather cool effect discos achieve with strobe lights, but presumably at even lower speeds to an improvement) there is no reason the technology cannot control the rate of presentation. 
It is a particular piece of work required of the devlopers, and it can be complex in cases where there is acompanying audio. 
IJ If the technology doesn't allow, then the requirement wouldn't apply. 
Otherwise that's a good point and should be mentioned in the techniques. 
CMN The technology allows it if it is built that way (the technology can be built to buffer endless amounts of live stream as well, but only at considerable cost). 
The question is when it is appropriate to go back to the middle of something and when it is appropriate to start it again, or let it keep running and return to its new state. 
IJ Any suggestions? 
CMN Ensure that user interface information is available in a device-independent manner (I'm not sure that's ideal either, but it seems to convey the requirement. 
THis seemed really incomprehensible the first time I looked at it, and my first guess at what it meant turned out to be wrong.) IJ I think it's both. 
I propose this clarification: "Use and conform to W3C specifications when they are available and appropriate for a task." 
We could drop the conformance part, but the whole reason we're pushing them is that they promote interoperability and have accessibility built-in. 
If you don't conform, what's the point? 
I do recognize that conformance is hard in some cases. 
It makes that the conformance part is P2. CMN I don't think conformance is P2 becuase it is hard. 
I think there may be a case that it is P2 becuase it is possible to provide accessibility without it (which is how P2 is actually defined - in terms of end user requirements, not easy development paths) IJ As to the exclusive part, I don't think that's implied. 
However, for checkpoint 11.1 we do make the clarification that there must be "at least one" version of the documentation that's accessible. 
We might make a similar clarification in the checkpoint or a note after. 
IJ That is true. 
A couple of ideas: 1) Demote to P3 and the text as is. 
CMN I think that is a terrible idea. 
If it is unclear, then changing the priority will not make it clearer, it will just give people the justifiable understanding that P3 requirements are things that were never properly specified and may as well be ignored. 
IJ 2) Identify the key requirements, for example presentation and input configuration. 
CMN This sounds like a good approach IJ Since it's a P3, why not all of it? 
CMN Because if I happen to meet the other P3s, and happen to allow the user to find out the expected size of the resource (where available) then I could claim triple-A conformance for nothing, without providing much benefit. 
What does the user need? 
(type, filename, whether it is local or not?) IJ I propose the following clarification: 1) I think "a default input configuration" makes more sense than "default input configurations" since there is only one default. 
Even if several modes may be covered (voice, keyboard, etc.), there's still only one default input configuration. 
2) Every browser comes with a default configuration. 
What are we requiring exactly? 
I propose that a) Either we drop this checkpoint, or b) We make the requirement much more specific. 
For example: "Ensure that the default configuration allows the user to navigate content and user interface controls simply, obviously, and quickly." 
CMN I prefer the secon solution, but I think we should try to specify it better. 
My attempt that I would like to see improvements on is "ensure that the most often used functions are the most obvious and easily actvated in the default configuration" Charles McCN
