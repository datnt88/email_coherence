<s> Hi, I would like two see two simple commands into amaya: - a comment/uncomment element item wich places the selection in comment or remove the comment - remove the englobing element.  </s>
<s> This would allow to avoid going in the source view to remove a div around an element.  </s>
<s> Cheers  </s>

<s> The second command already exists in Amaya.  </s>
<s> You have to select the englobing element and to use the "transform" command (Edit menu).  </s>
<s> Laurent.  </s>
<s> The first command also exists, but it is normally only available in the structure view.  </s>
<s> You would have to add the structures menu to the foramtted view.  </s>
<s> This is probably a reasonable idea anyway, although it becomes a question of how to make it work.  </s>
<s> Maybe like the annotations interface, where adding content is done by opening a dialogue...  </s>
