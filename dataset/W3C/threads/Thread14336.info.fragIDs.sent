<s> close quote Well, I like to think that it's class that's being made accessible and CSS is simply the means used to accomplish that.. Theoretically, class is independent of CSS... HTML 4.01 says that user agents can utilize class in other ways (tho it doesn't specify them) And other means could be used to make the class accessible, like the RDF I described (tho I favor using class).  </s>

<s> User agents shall present to the user on demand a list of all titles classes without the title attribute shall be ignored the class name itself shall be transparent to the user.  </s>
<s> This allows us to change what the user hears (or sees of feels) without editing the page.  </s>
<s> Users shall be able to choose any class and then step through all elements of a particular title.. /quote Love the principle.  </s>
<s> The above has me a little confused in terms of usage.  </s>
<s> 'A list of all titles', would present to the user something akin to a toc, or list of available specially marked items.  </s>
<s> 'Step through all elements of a class'.  </s>
<s> I'm unsure of the utility of this, expansion please?  </s>
<s> And the one thats missing :-) when 'reading' an element with such a class, the 'title' info is presented to the user (as I note visually that this element is 'green with yellow polkadots' or whatever).  </s>
<s> The first two appear to me as navigation assistance, which IMHO is very personal.  </s>
<s> The missing one is the equivalence case for the sighted user.  </s>
<s> I like the 'missing' one, I'd like to be sure that its more than a nice to have for non visual browsing before I'd support the other two.  </s>
<s> I note the 'how' is missing.  </s>
<s> Would they be presented as per alt text for an image?  </s>
<s> Would ua's want to know how this should be presented?  </s>
