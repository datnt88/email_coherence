<s> Date: 15 May 2000, 18:00 hrs From: Eric Hansen Re: Suggested Revision to Definitions of Control and Configure I have been becoming uneasy with the document's distinction between "control" and "configure" and would like to propose a revision.  </s>
<s> Al Gilman's comment helped crystallize some of my thinking.  </s>
<s> He noted: 3. Question using control/configure distinction in setting minimums, here.  </s>
<s> The forced distinction between "control" (i.e. adjustment through the UI that affect the current behavior) vs. "configure" (adjustments that may have to be done out of line with a use session, but persist) is unfortunate.  </s>
<s> The strongest user requirement is that they be able to adjust the UA behavior somehow.  </s>
<s> Whether it fits into the narrower categories of "control" or "configure" as discussed above is secondary or tertiary, relative to this requirement.  </s>
<s> In the most usable implementation, and this is also quite common today, there is not a lot of difference between the user interface to current-session and next-session adjustments, aside from a prompt as to whether the user intends the adjustment to be temporary/local or global/permanent.  </s>
<s> (http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000AprJun/0369.html)  </s>
<s> Instead of viewing "control" and "configure" as very distinct concepts, I would like to propose a softer distinction wherein to "configure" is to "control", but with greater emphasis on the persistence of the setting.  </s>
<s> I am inclined to think that, generally speaking, we want the checkpoints (especially the _minimum_ requirements!) to focus on control.  </s>
<s> We can encourage configurability and the use of profiles, etc., but control is the fundamental issue.  </s>
<s> I am hoping that with this revised definition, some of the other decisions that we are struggling with will resolve more easily.  </s>
<s> Following is may fix to the definitions of "configure" and "control".  </s>
<s> I invite comment.  </s>
<s> Configure In the context of this document, to configure means to choose, from a set of options, preferences for interface layout, user agent behavior, rendering style, and other parameters required by this document.  </s>
<s> This may be done through the user agent's user interface, through profiles, style sheets, by scripts, etc. Users should be able to save their configurations across user agent sessions (e.g., in a profile).  </s>
<s> The range of available configurations (e.g., colors, font families and sizes, sound quality, etc.) may depend on system or hardware limitations.  </s>
<s> Control In this document, the noun "control" means "user interface component" or "form component".  </s>
<s> Control (and Configuration) The term "control" is used in two major contexts in this document.  </s>
<s> (1) governance, such as a user may exercise over interface layout, user agent behavior, rendering style, and other parameters required by this document.  </s>
<s> Such control may be exercised through the user agent's user interface, through profiles, style sheets, by scripts, etc.  </s>
<s> The degree and kind of control that is possible (e.g., colors, font families and sizes, sound quality, etc.) may depend on system or hardware limitations.  </s>
<s> Control that persists, especially across user sessions, may be termed bold configuration /bold .  </s>
<s> A users may be able to save configurations across user agent settings in a bold profile /bold .  </s>

<s> thanks Eric and Al.  </s>
<s> I like the direction this discussion has gone, and I especially like the new definition of "control"  </s>
<s> I suggest a different approach.  </s>
<s> some things that are now not controllable are setable and some of that subset should be controllable.  </s>
<s> I proppose we use set to mean obtain persistence as in set font family and controll to mean dynamically interact with or change.  </s>
<s> We need this distinction.  </s>

<s> David, I am a little concerned about trying to make individual checkpoint point level more complicated and using them to tell developers what needs persistence along with another functionality.  </s>
<s> I think if we use the word control and put our persistence requirements in the configuration section we will make the document much easier for developers to understand.  </s>
<s> If we start to talk about persistence in individual checkpoints then we might as well get rid of checkpoint 10.7, since it would be duplicating the requirements in other checkpoints.  </s>
<s> I would rather see the emphasis on control in other checkpoints and then use 10.7 determine what should be persistent and use the minimum requirements in 10.7 as the means to define persistent features required.  </s>
<s> 10.7 For the configuration requirements of this document, allow the user to save user preferences in a profile.  </s>
