Reviewing the issue document (as of 16 Jun) I note that a couple of items on the "issues postponed" list seem to have been resolved by the current WG: - rdfms-abouteachprefix: has been discarded, no? - rdf-containers-otherapproaches: we've just decided to include a daml:collection like syntax I suggest these be regarded as closed. 
#g Graham Klyne No. We decided to remove aboutEachPrefix from the language, but postponed the issue so that a future WG may consider providing the functionality in some other form. 
We have, but that is not the same thing. 
This issue is about designing a new container mechanism from scratch which might well have bag like things done better. 
Brian Maybe we should send a note to the WebOnt folks, passing on the baton? 
(or at least offering it...).
