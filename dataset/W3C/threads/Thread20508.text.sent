Is it possible to add a confirmation window to the print icon and the print shortcut in order to prevent accidental printing? 
The print icon is directly beneath the save icon and the two icons are easily confused. 
Thanks, Karl-Michael I vote against this request. 
I hate those 'are you sure', 'are you realy sure', 'are you realy realy sure' windows for non destructive actions. 
To prevent accidental printing in the current release is easy: define a 'to file' printer on your local system and use it as the default printer. 
For future amaya versions, the icon bar can be made customizable just like M@Office applications. 
Then remove the 'print to the default printer' button and replace it with the 'File- Print' action which invokes the printer selection menu. 
BTW: The amaya on my system (5.3, 18 dec 2001) asks what to print, isn't the cancel on this window enough to prevent accidental printing? 
CBee I don't want to define a 'to file' printer as the default printer for all applications just because of Amaya. 
BTW, my system is Linux. 
I second this. 
My Amaya (5.3, Linux) does not ask me what to print, it prints the current document. 
Karl-Michael Well, technically printing is a destructive action. 
You use both paper and ink that can't be recovered. 
Though I think we are all used to the destructive use of electrons most actions involve so I don't think we have to worry about that.

Karl-Michael I suggest to attach the command SetupAndPrint instead, so you will have to confirm to print. 
What do you think? 
Irene. 
Probably yes but we (the core team) don't time to work on this kind of feature currently. 
It works that way on Windows platforms and I propose to adopt the same method for Unix platforms. 
Irene. 
Good thinking, The core team should be focused on the amaya core. 
Why is there a difference between the unix and the M$Windows variants here? 
Remove the difference and work on one source. 
Or is it an external print method? 
CBee Good idea. 
But if the windows behaviour, i.e. Amaya asking what to print, with a cancel option is built into the Linux version, that would do it as well. 
Karl-Michael There is a difference here because we want to use the standard Windows interface to select the printer and its options.

What about a "Don't ask me again" checkbox like in Mozilla's Ctrl+Enter-Send Message?

(Sir Winston Leonard Spencer "Winnie" Churchill) I vote on this, besides, this seems to be becoming a way to give confirmation to those who want it and eliminate it for those who don't.
