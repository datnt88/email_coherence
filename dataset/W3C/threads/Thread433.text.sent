To Whom It May Concern, Sybex, the computer book publisher in California, would like to include the latest demo of HTML Tidy on its upcoming CD-ROM to accompany the book "Mastery XHTML-Premium Edition" .

Thanks for your help-- Jason Holt Permissions &amp; Licensing Specialist Sybex Inc. 1151 Marina Village Parkway Alameda, CA 94501 ph: 510-523-8233 x450 For the benefit of Jason and others on the mailing list listening in : HTML Tidy is available on multiple platforms, and in multiple forms. 
All based on the base Tidy source code. 
The base source code was principally authored by Dave Raggett, and is copyrighted and covered by the W3C software license : Distribution of the base Tidy code and derivations are allowable as per : I won't speak for other authors of HTML Tidy based software, but I would be more than happy for you to distribute on your CD, the versions of Tidy for Mac OS that I author. 
I will contact you off the list regards formalizing the request for Tidy for Mac OS; I suggest other authors also contact you off the list. 
A new version of the base Tidy code is about to be released soon - depending on the timing of the release of your CD, this may some impact on what versions of derivative works of Tidy actually end up on your CD. Thank you for your interest in HTML Tidy.
