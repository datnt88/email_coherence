<s> I have been asked by a WG member whether a general purpose XML tool such as JUMBO supports EXTENDED links, the idea being to use it in a complex hyperlinked context.  </s>
<s> When reviewing examples of the proposed input I was unclear about whether certain constructs had well-accepted implied semantics.  </s>
<s> If so, I think it important that they appear in the spec.  </s>
<s> I know the ERB are rightly concerned about not specifying behaviour, APIs, etc.  </s>
<s> The draft says 'express *policies* rather than *mechanisms*'.  </s>
<s> This implies that there are no generic approaches to implementing XML-LINK.  </s>
<s> However I believe that some of the components can be implemented in a generic manner but that guidance as to which and (to some extent how) should be in the revision If this is not done, then a multitude of different approaches spring up, often incompatible.  </s>
<s> We have already seen this in XML-DEV which has seen at least 5 public XML parsers emerge (and doubtless many more unpublished).  </s>
<s> The approaches were significantly different.  </s>
<s> XML-DEV, catalysed by John Tigue, is (hopefully) pulling together the basis of a parser API (both input and ouptut).  </s>
<s> IMO XML-LINK is even more difficult than a parser API.  </s>
<s> Without ERB guidance in certain areas, we may get confusion and diversity.  </s>
<s> It will make it difficult to get consensus on common constructs in XML-LINK if they behave differently in different link-processors.  </s>
<s> It may be inevitable, but if the first generation of XML-LINK documents contain: 'The links in this document can only be processed with Browser X' then I think we have lost something.  </s>
<s> [If this is just my confusion, there is no problem, but I suspect that the webhacker community may also have some problems in implementing XML-LINK consistently.]  </s>
<s> The main question is 'are there generally accepted semantics/behaviour for XML-LINKs, or is everything application-dependent?  </s>
<s> If there *are* GENERIC components, which are they and how are they to be interpreted?' I accept that it may be possible to produce general purpose engines (perhaps HyBrowse is one?) that are customisable by particular applications, but this is not the primary purpose of my question.  </s>
<s> The question is how far, if at all, can independent JUMBO-like tools go without diverging in their interpretation of a given XML document.  </s>
<s> Another way of looking at it is to ask what the major browser manufacturers might be able to include in XML-LINK-aware browsers without divergence or local customisation.  </s>
<s> I will try to summarise what I believe a generic XML-LINK processor can do without customisation.  </s>
<s> I stress that not all 'display' is necessarily browser-like and may not be graphical.  </s>
<s> All 'USER' options are probably to be carried out by a human and I will assume the browser metaphor.  </s>
<s> (I suppose it is possible that 'USER' could be a robotic command from another XML processor).  </s>
<s> I will label by 'GENERIC', those commands that I think any XML-LINK processor should be able to implement in a uniforma manner.  </s>
<s> I shall assume that the evaluation of the HREF argument is one or more locations.  </s>
<s> (location(s)) are addressable point(s) in the grove of an XML document and could be a node, a span, multiple nodes (TEI/ALL); alternatively it could be a single non-XML document (e.g."foo.gif")  </s>
<s> possibly using an XML NOTATION, but without internal XML-addressable structure.  </s>
<s> SIMPLE: USER/NEW (GENERIC) This creates a new display space for the target (grove or non-XML) which can be manipulated indendently of the current grove (i.e. where the SIMPLE link was located.) If the grove happens to be the same as the current, then a model/view might be used to manage them independently.  </s>
<s> I would assume that traversal of the target grove started as it was constructed and that other XML-LINks (AUTO) were processed as soon as they were encountered (i.e. a 'depth-first' strategy).  </s>
<s> USER/REPLACE (GENERIC) This removes the current grove from the display and starts processing the target into that display space.  </s>
<s> Again, if the target contains XML-LINKs (AUTO) they should be processed in a depth-first strategy.  </s>
<s> AUTO/NEW (GENERIC) When this is encountered in displaying the current grove, a new display space is immediately created and processing switches to it.  </s>
<s> When this processing is (recursively) complete, processing of the current grove continues.  </s>
<s> AUTO/REPLACE (GENERIC) When this is encountered while traversing the current grove, the current traversal is immediately halted and processing of the target begins, using the current display space.  </s>
<s> Any recursive XML-LINKs are treated on a depth-first basis, similar to the above.  </s>
<s> All links are treated as INLINE=TRUE and so have at least two ends.  </s>
<s> It is application-dependent as to whether this information is used, but if it is it represents a (GENERIC) method of traversing the link in the reverse direction EMBED.  </s>
<s> I have problems with this that I think would benefit from clarification in the spec.  </s>
<s> My interpretation is as follows: IF the target of an EMBED is a non-XML object, then that object (e.g. a GIF) is 'physically' embedded in the document.  </s>
<s> Thus and carry out identical operations.  </s>
<s> (There is an application-dependent or target-dependent problem as to how physically the target is embedded, and it is possible that it might still have an actuation button for conciseness - e.g. a thumbnail gif) *** when the target of an EMBED is an XML-grove I have the main problem *** Example: WF document target.xml:  </s>
<s> !DOCTYPE target [ ] I am a target WF document current.xml  </s>
<s> !DOCTYPE current [ ] I am the current document I am a resource /A *** is there a GENERIC way of processing this?  </s>
<s> *** My understanding is that there are two separate groves (target and current) and that there is a link from the A node in current to the TARGET in target.  </s>
<s> In some way target is 'embedded' in current.  </s>
<s> This is what I (and some of my fellow webhackers) do not understand.  </s>
<s> One way of embedding would be to use an entity: !DOCTYPE current [ ] I am the current document &amp;target; but this clearly misses something.  </s>
<s> The USER/EMBED option suggests that the user has a document which is rendered like: [Current Icon] I am the current document [I am a link; Press me and I will embed target.xml]  </s>
<s> I am a resource [I have stopped being a link] [I am no longer current] [EOF] The user presses!  </s>
<s> Do they get a new version of the displayed document?  </s>
<s> IMO this seems essential.  </s>
<s> So the new document might look like: [Current Icon - I obey the CURRENT DTD] I am the current document [I am a clicked link!  </s>
<s> target.xml is embedded here!  </s>
<s> You can now read it!] [Target Icon - I obey the TARGET DTD!!] I am a target [I have finished being a target] [end of embedding] I am a resource [I am no longer a link] [I am no longer current] [EOF] (I am not clear whether the contents of A ("I am a resource") should be deleted.)  </s>
<s> Alternatively, as I understand it from Eliot's posting, there is simply a link between A and T. In which case why the word 'EMBED'?  </s>
<s> If the link is REQUIRED to be traversed (either AUTO or after the USER action) then we have effectively got a larger grove (rather similar to the file above) which may contain documents with different DTDs.  </s>
<s> It gets harder with EMBED/AUTO which is what my correspondent was enquiring about.  </s>
<s> This can be potentially extremely powerful if the target documents (recursively) describe sets of XML-LINKs.  </s>
<s> But its value will be limited if the traversal is not GENERIC.  </s>
<s> In conclusion, the XML-LINK spec should specify which bits are GENERIC and which are application-dependent.  </s>
<s> The ACTUATE/SHOW axes only make sense if they describe a GENERIC mechanism (otherwise people would simply roll their own).  </s>
<s> Since I know don't know how to treat parts of SIMPLE, I shan't consider EXTENDED.  </s>
<s> But it will be important to know whether there are GENERIC implementations to any of these.  </s>
<s> The long posting from MichaelSMcQ was very useful - I haven't had time to work out whether it can be processed by a GENERIC mechanism or not.  </s>
<s> There are clearly a group of people on the ERB/WG who have a picture of how GENERIC solutions are to be implemented.  </s>
<s> However, I think that the dirty webhackers like me will not pick them up.  </s>
<s> [And XML-LINK won't be very useful if there aren't any implementations or they all behave differently.]  </s>
<s> Any clarity on WHICH aspects are GENERIC will be valuable, and for these some additional implementation guidance, please.  </s>

<s> Peter Murray-Rust, domestic net connection Virtual School of Molecular Sciences  </s>
<s> Without getting into the details of Peter's attempt to define generic expectations for link handling, I think that all such specifications belong in a document separate from the ones we're currently working on.  </s>
<s> I believe that there is a general consensus among the ERB that we will need to agree eventually on some default behaviors for various categories of user agents such as Web browsers, but that this is not the time or place to be engaged in that activity.  </s>
<s> Perhaps xml-dev is the right place to discuss early informal agreements among the developers of particular kinds of applications.  </s>
<s> Jon  </s>
<s> Thanks Jon, Understood and agreed.  </s>
<s> I think that any early implementations (from a document labelled DO NOT IMPLEMENT :-) can expect to be transient.  </s>
<s> I expect these discussions will have some of the flavour of discussions about APIs (which seem to be making good progress).  </s>
<s> If XML-DEV does throw up agreement, I am sure enough ERB/WG members will take note.  </s>
