<s> I'm uncomfortable that "Level 1 RDF Schema on Steroids" focuses on global domain/range restrictions rather than local restrictions.  </s>
<s> I've found general consensus that local restrictions are preferable.  </s>
<s> I think we want as seamless a progression as reasonable/possible from Level 1 to Level 2 (so users can graduate as they appreciate and/or need additional features).  </s>
<s> If we only support global restrictions in Level 1, I'm tempted to suggest that we drop local restrictions from Level 2. I think cardinality (preferably arbitrary, but at least 0+/0-1/1/1+/n) needs to be addressed in Level 1.  </s>
<s> Most current DAML+OIL ontologies include cardinality restrictions.  </s>
<s> XML Schemas typically include cardinality restrictions.  </s>
<s> I'm torn on the functional property issue.  </s>
<s> While I think a global restriction could be a useful hint to reasoners, I think this would often be misused.  </s>
<s> For instance, a usSocialSecurityNumber property uniquely identifies a Person but not a BankAccount.  </s>
<s> As suggested by others in the past, I'd prefer a local property like :usSocialSecurityNumber owl:uniquelyIdentifies :Person  </s>
<s> Generalizing and going out on limb a bit, I'm concerned that we're giving RDF too much sway (ignoring charter issues).  </s>
<s> If WebOnt is successful, I expect most folks will use it rather than RDF.  </s>
<s> This is typical in layered systems (compare the amount of application code written to use 10baseT, Ethernet datagrams, IP, TCP/UDP, and HTTP which are (roughly) successive layers in the ISO OSI Reference Model).  </s>
<s> I'm a bit concerned that we're making decisions that will inconvenience millions of future WebOnt users for the sake of hundreds of current RDF users.  </s>

<s> Frank,  </s>
<s> I like very much the way you grouped functionalities.  </s>
<s> I think it provides the right level of granularity for this discussion on compliance level.  </s>
<s> However, I am not sure about the new proposal.  </s>
<s> My idea of a level 1 was something like a 'basic frame language', one which however is not as 'basic' as RDFS.  </s>
<s> Your proposal, as Mike also points out, focuses on properties, rather than additional machinery for slot specification.  </s>
<s> My intuition is that this is not what 'basic' users of OWL will need.  </s>
<s> What I would like to see is the RDF Schema stuff + machinery for specifying value/range/cardinality restrictions.  </s>
<s> We could then discuss whether to add (In)equality &amp; Property characteristics, but I guess these extensions will greatly complicate the implementation of reasoners for basic OWL, and may make pointless to have a distinction between level 1 and 2. - Enrico  </s>
<s> I very strongly agree with this point and indeed I said similar things at the f2f in Amsterdam.  </s>
<s> It is crazy that we are making our life difficult by imposing a RDF syntactic compatibility constraint, which may only be worth enforcing for a short period anyway.  </s>
<s> We should rather focus on semantic compatibility (and indeed we do!) Enrico  </s>
