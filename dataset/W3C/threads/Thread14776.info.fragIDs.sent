<s> Question -  </s>
<s> How does the document at the following link apply to xhtml?  </s>
<s> I am being required to comply with said document for accessibility reasons but in many ways it seems out of date.  </s>
<s> Where can I locate a set of guidelines regarding Accessibility, that is pertinent to xhtml?  </s>

<s> The document doesn't address XHTML specifically, since XHTML was not yet a Recommendation when it was originally published in 1999.  </s>
<s> The HTML techniques[1] document for WCAG 2.0 will contain XHTML techniques, but it's not presently in a state I would call authoritative.  </s>
<s> I think that the best way presently to claim compliance to a set of guidelines relating to XHTML right now would be to follow both the HTML techniques for WCAG 1 and the XML Accessibility Guidelines [2], and where the HTML techniques are lacking or the two conflict, taking guidance from XAG. XAG is designed for developers creating their own XML-based language, but may point you in the right direction.  </s>
<s> It is important to note, however, that support for XHTML may be sporadic among assistive technologies, and some may need to make use of out-of-date techniques.  </s>
<s> Are you having any specific hangups that someone could clarify?  </s>

<s> As of version 1.1, the features of XHTML are identical to those of HTML 4.01, for which the original WCAG 1.0 techniques were written.  </s>
<s> Thus unless you plan to create your own modules (in which case I would suggest reading the draft XML accessibility guidelines) it should be entirely possible to apply the existing HTML techniques to XHTML content.  </s>
<s> Of course, if you use any of the basic modules (i.e., basic tables) rather than the full version), you won't be able to apply techniques that rely on features which are not included in your chosen XHTML modules.  </s>
<s> Usually however, alternative techniques are provided for each checkpoint in the guidelines.  </s>
<s> I also agree with Matt that reviewing the WCAG 2.0 HTML techniques draft, of which he is the primary author, would be useful.  </s>
