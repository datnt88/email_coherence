<s> No, the word "not" IS needed.  </s>
<s> As noted in the previous paragraph of Section 8.2.4, "ISO-8859-8-i" denotes implicit bidirectionality, and "ISO-8859-8-e" denotes explicit directionality.  </s>
<s> "Unicode bidirectionality algorithm" means implicit bidirectionality algorithm, thus, "ISO-8859-8-e" should NOT be used.  </s>

<s> Yes. I read RFC1556 to understand the usage of "-i" and "-e".  </s>
<s> I still have two questions.  </s>
<s> (1) Are there many language that can be encoded by "-e" encoding or only Hebrew and Arabic have "-e" (and "-i") encoding ?  </s>
<s> (2) Now my understanding about section 8.2.4 with your help: Section 8.2.4 says "we can use NO '-e' encodings to express explicit directional control, because HTML uses the Unicode 'inolicit' bidirectionality algorithm only".  </s>
<s> Is it right?  </s>
<s> Thank you for your kindness.  </s>
<s> By the way, could I write to you in both English and Japanese (by ISO-2022-JP) ?  </s>

<s> Hello Uchida-san, Ishikawa-san is quite right that the text of the HTML 4 specification is correct as it is.  </s>
<s> But his explanation is maybe not exactly right.  </s>
<s> The Unicode bidirectionality algorithm contains both an implicit and an explicit part.  </s>
<s> The implicit part is used when no BIDI control codes or higher-level protocol giving explicit information is used.  </s>
<s> Both BIDI control codes (strongly discouraged) and higher-level protocol (DIR attribute) can be used in HTML, but they have nothing to do with the 8859-8 encoding as such (they can as well be used together with ASCII encoded HTML text, which also is not labeled as US-ASCII-E), so this is the reason why iso-8859-8-e should NOT be used.  </s>
<s> By the way, this was cross-checked with Hebrew experts during the work on HTML 4.0, so I am quite confident it is correct.  </s>
<s> If you have any other question, please feel free to ask (also in Japanese if you want).  </s>
<s> Many thanks again for helping translating HTML 4.0.  </s>

<s> expressed with ISO 8859-8, so "ISO-8859-8-e" should not be used.  </s>
<s> There are many languages that use the Hebrew or Arabic script and therefore need Bidi support.  </s>
<s> There are also some more scripts (mostly historic) that are written right-to-left.  </s>
<s> In practice, only Hebrew email uses both visual and implicit ordering.  </s>
<s> RFC 1556 was written by somebody mostly familliar with Hebrew, but not so much with Arabic.  </s>
<s> While Hebrew and Arabic have more or less the same problems for Bidi, Arabic needs more work for character- glyph processing.  </s>
<s> In actual practice and early implementations, Hebrew therefore mostly was based on simple ASCII software, with some keyboard hacking and a different font.  </s>
<s> This resulted in using visual ordering in the data.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, for Arabic, a more sophisticated renderer was needed anyway, so in most cases, Bidi was also built in.  </s>
<s> Therefore, visual ordering is not much used for Arabic, while it was and still is in use for Hebrew.  </s>
<s> In contrary to what RFC 1556 says, the "-e" and "-i" was only used for Hebrew, but never took on for Arabic.  </s>
<s> This is mentionned in the HTML 4.0 spec.  </s>
<s> As for the distinction between "-i" and "-e", please see my previous mail.  </s>
<s> As far as I know, there are some standards that allow explicit reordering combined with 8859-8, but they never really came into much use, and are not relevant in connection with HTML 4.0.  </s>
<s> No, this is not right, as explained in my previous mail.  </s>

<s> Martin, thanks for your follow-up.  </s>
<s> And just FYI: in the list of registered charset values[1], "ISO_8859-6-E" and "ISO_8859-8-E" are only encodings which use explicit directionality ("EBCDIC-JP-E" is not for bi-directional data, I believe ;-).  </s>
<s> Yes, sorry for confusion.  </s>
<s> And for me, ISO-2022-JP-2 is also acceptable, if you need.  </s>
