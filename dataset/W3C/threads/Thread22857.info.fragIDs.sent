<s> Why was it deemed necessary to close this transitive relation in the model?  </s>
<s> It's really an early-binding/late-binding issue.  </s>
<s> We could have bound the URI to the name, and said that every time you try to get the namespace URI, we would resolve it in the context of the namespace declaration attributes at and above that node.  </s>
<s> This might have been more elegant, but would definitely have involved more computation.  </s>
<s> Also, it's unclear that's the right behavior.  </s>
<s> What if you move a node from one point to another, and thereby into a context where the same prefix is bound to a different URI?  </s>
<s> It's "the same node object", so one can argue that its behavior shouldn't change -- and that therefore it should stay in the original namespace.  </s>
<s> (This is more important if you have a DOM which subclasses nodes based on which namespace they belong to -- we aren't sure whether anyone will do that, but we didn't want to rule it out.)  </s>
<s> We really did consider trying to define things such that the behavior would always be consistent with writing out to XML text, making a change at that level, and reading it back in.  </s>
<s> But our conclusion was that the DOM represents the infoset -- the data model of the XML document's contents, rather than its syntax -- and that the early-binding approach was most practical for most DOM applications.  </s>
<s> Complications only arise if you really want to change a node's namespace URI (in which case we feel you should create a new node, since the URI is part of the node's identity in the same sense that localname is), or at serialization time (see below).  </s>
<s> Any "namespace" attributes are superfluous.  </s>
<s> They could well be trashed upon element modification and generated (with caching if so desired) as requested.  </s>
<s> True. Note that the Infoset says that the namespace declarations are not really attributes, and some folks did argue that they shouldn't appear in the DOM at all.  </s>
<s> But we wanted to allow Level 1 "pseudo-namespace" code to continue working with Level 2 DOMs, and that meant retaining the declarations.  </s>
<s> Why normalize?  </s>
<s> ever?  </s>
<s> Valid question.  </s>
<s> But there were requests -- e.g. from those who (like Deiter) don't like the look of attributes with qualified-name collisions -- for such a mechanism.  </s>
<s> Since the Load/Save chapter of Level 3 is going to  </s>
<s> have to deal with that anyway, our current guess is that exposing it as a separate method ought to be easy.  </s>
<s> If it isn't, we'll have to do a more serious cost/benefit analysis.  </s>
<s> In Level 2, that normalization task is left as an exercise for the reader,  </s>
<s> poor soul...  </s>
<s> In fact, I expect that most folks will use a serializer that was packaged with their parser... so this is mostly an exercise for the experts, who probably have a pretty good handle on how to deal with it.  </s>
<s> Shouldn't be bad.  </s>
<s> During the tree-walk, if you see a prefix-to-URI binding that isn't currently declared, issue a declaration at that node (or, in the case of an Attr, at the owningNode -- yes, this requires a tiny bit of lookahead).  </s>
<s> While you're at it, you can reconcile any Attr qualified-name  </s>
<s> conflicts.  </s>
<s> There's room to get more sophisticated about it but that just-do-it-locally approach will work, and the fancier you get the more likely someone will quibble about how your style doesn't match theirs.  </s>
<s> grin/ At the other extreme, you can discard _all_ the existing declarations and create new ones at the top of the document, with entirely synthetic prefixes... but the prefixes might be meaningful to a human reading the document (xsl:, for example), and DTD validation breaks down if you don't use the prefixes the DTD expects (comment withheld).  </s>

<s> There is a peculiar asymmetry in the way the DOM models namespaces.  </s>
<s> It is said, for example, that a given element node (as any node) is bound to a namespace.  </s>
<s> This although it is not the node which stands in a relation to a namespace, but the node's name.  </s>
<s> Why was it deemed necessary to close this transitive relation in the model?  </s>
<s> You have confused me here.  </s>
<s> If the URI is bound to the name, then there is no resolution necessary.  </s>
<s> Or did you mean the prefix?  </s>
<s> In any case, the issue of early/late binding is independent of where the URI (or prefix) is bound.  </s>
<s> The dom binds it to the element node.  </s>
<s> The alternative would have been to make the name itself a first class node and bind the URI there.  </s>
<s> Whether it is then late or early bound is a separate issue.  </s>
<s> I agree with the above, but, as said, it's not the issue which I was adressing.  </s>
<s> If the URI is bound to the name, then the name is static, as the namespace spec implies it should be.  </s>
<s> All the questions re prefixes don't signify as the prefix has no defined meaning in the DOM.  </s>
<s> When the model is defined such that the prefix/uri bindings exist independent of the names, and the infoset is defined to include "namespace attributes", complications must arise each time one introduces a name into the scope of an element without having the appropriate prefix/uri bindings present.  </s>
<s> Until the namespace attributes are "normalized" the DOM is invalid.  </s>
<s> For a simple "attribute added to an element node" this is no real problem.  </s>
<s> A synchronized "add attribute" operator could be defined to clean up on the way out.  </s>
<s> For general tree mutations, on the other hand, this will be a lost cause.  </s>
<s> Any "namespace" attributes are superfluous.  </s>
<s> They could well be trashed upon element modification and generated (with caching if so desired) as requested.  </s>
<s> I wonder how long that will last.  </s>
<s> Why normalize?  </s>
<s> ever?  </s>
<s> "Qualified name collisions" are an artifact of incorrect serialization.  </s>
<s> As I noted above, the prefixes (where they are prefixes) have no defined meaning in the DOM.  </s>
<s> Where they are part of the name proper, they are intrinsically invalid, but I'm not concerned with that case.  </s>
<s> Where the DOM is namespace aware no operations based on prefixed can have a defined result and the prefixes attain significance once serialized only.  </s>
<s> At which point correct serialization never generates collisions.  </s>
<s> In Level 2, that normalization task is left as an exercise for the reader,  </s>
<s> poor soul...  </s>
<s> A method which would work with the proposed SAX2 api is to - push a namespace frame with any asserted prefix/uri binding prior to processing an element node - serialize each name (element, attribute) in turn - if the uri is bound, there's nothing to do - if the uri is unbound then bind it in the frame with either a pretty nickname, if that is unique in the frame, or with a canonical name otherwise. the canonical names are generated when the namespace is first encountered.  </s>
<s> - serialize the namespace frame Whether this is said to involve lookahead depends on ones view of namespace frames.  </s>
<s> If one is not concerned with the pretty names, one also never needs to check for prefix uniqueness - "normalization" is a side-effect of namespace uniqueness.  </s>
<s> The "name" is an attribute of the Node, and is made up of the namespace URI and the localname.  </s>
<s> The binding of Node (and thus name) to namespace URI occurs at the time the Node is created.  </s>
<s> It isn't expressed as a seperate "name" object, but I think it's equivalent to what you're asking for.  </s>
<s> Since  </s>
<s> object creation can be expensive in some environments, and names are immutable, I don't think a separate name object would be an improvement.  </s>
<s> Until the namespace attributes are "normalized" the DOM is invalid.  </s>
<s> The DOM doesn't currently check for validity; that's a Level 3 issue.  </s>
<s> Did you mean "not well formed"?  </s>
<s> Under the current design, the DOM doesn't  </s>
<s> enforce all the XML well-formedness rules; that too is a Level 3 issue.  </s>
<s> If your point is that validation currently interacts badly with namespaces, I agree.  </s>
<s> But until schemas are released or someone redesigns DTD validation to be namespace-aware, there isn't a lot we can do about that.  </s>
<s> Joe Kesselman / IBM Research  </s>
<s> I believe that I was the one who introduced the terminology of early/late binding in this situation, and it was in recognition of something that didn't get brought up yet on this thread: folk regularly implement DOM using specialized subclasses to express behaviors of element types.  </s>
<s> So for example an XHTML "img" node might well know how to render itself and incrementally fetch an image -- but the "p" node would instead be smart about reflowing contained inline text content.  </s>
<s> Good non-browser examples exist too, not limited to additional methods in HTML DOM nodes.  </s>
<s> Given that recognition, it's clear that "early" bindings need to be accomodated in some way, since the class implementing a DOM node can't be changed after-the-fact ... and those behaviors are exactly the ones that folk intend to associate with elements, based on namespace IDs.  </s>
<s> For nodes that don't implement such specialized behaviors, it is true that "late" binding could work just fine; names could just be another kind of attribute for elements (and attributes etc).  </s>
<s> At this time, DOM doesn't support such a notion though.  </s>
<s> - Dave  </s>
<s> Well, only sort of.  </s>
<s> Since  </s>
<s> As they are immutable, were they to be interned, there would't need to be recreated.  </s>
<s> It's an old argument.  </s>
<s> Until the namespace attributes are "normalized" the DOM is invalid.  </s>
<s> I meant "not conforming to the namespaces in xml specification, as the 'prefix declared' constraint is not met".  </s>
<s> Keeping a DOM in conformance with said spec is not a reasonable endeavour.  </s>
<s> As such, the namespace attributes have no purpose in the DOM.  </s>
<s> One might one to keep them around as hints to the serializer, but they're not of much other use.  </s>
<s> No, that's a separate issue.  </s>
<s> I think that's a detail of how the DOM is implemented and how the application drives it, rather than of how the API behaves.  </s>
<s> But your milage may vary.  </s>
<s> As such, the namespace attributes have no purpose in the DOM  </s>
<s> They have one important purpose: If anyone has written level-1 code that provides its own namespace layer, discarding these attributes would break it.  </s>
<s> We wanted to allow existing Level 1 code to continue running with a Level 2 DOM, even if intermixing Level 1 and Level 2 calls more freely is difficult.  </s>
