<s> Hi! Duncan Grisby from ORL (the creators of omniORB), has warned me about using wstring in my IDL code for the reasons listed below.  </s>
<s> Please consider using sequences of unsigned short instead of wstring in the DOM spce:  </s>
<s> As for wchar and wstring support in omniORB, it's been done, and should be publicly available soon.  </s>
<s> However, I would advise sticking to a sequence of unsigned shorts for a couple of reasons.  </s>
<s> Firstly, sequences give you a length field, and bounds checking on member access, which you don't get with string or wstring.  </s>
<s> Secondly, the CORBA wchar spec is a complete mess -- the on-the-wire format is defined to be anything between 1 and 4 bytes per character, or variable bytes per character; the language mapping is system- specific -- on Solaris, wchar maps to a 4-byte character, but on Windows it's 2 bytes, so as to fit in with system libraries.  </s>
<s> I don't think Linux has sufficient support for such things for it to be defined at all.  </s>
<s> All in all, there's _lots_ of overhead to wchar, which I think is best avoided.  </s>
<s> The (non-)overhead of using a sequence of unsigned long:  </s>
<s> The overhead should be quite small, especially if the optimiser is good.  </s>
<s> If you think the overhead of the bounds checking is too much, you can get at the C++ array inside the sequence with the proprietary NP_data() function.  </s>
<s> (NP stands for non-portable.  </s>
<s> Look at omniORB2/seqtemplates.h.) The CORBA spec has no such function, but most ORBs allow you to do it.  </s>
<s> With a bit of macro cleverness, you could make the code portable between ORBs.  </s>
<s> Doing this, you still get the advantage that you know the length of your wstring without having to iterate over its members.  </s>
<s> The relevant bits of the spec are at: ftp://www.omg.org/pub/docs/formal/98-02-08.pdf page 25 and ftp://www.omg.org/pub/docs/formal/98-02-18.pdf pages 5, 6, 10, 11  </s>

<s> Or better yet, use the "wstring" type but stipulate that the characters encoded in it must just be regular UCS-4 characters, perhaps constrained by the XML or HTML specs as appropriate.  </s>
<s> Then we still don't get that length field etc.  </s>
<s> I vote for 2 typedefs domchar and domstring (perhaps other names but...)  </s>
<s> You'll note that a nonconventional mapping of IDL to Java is in use, and the same is true for IDL to JavaScript.  </s>
<s> Arrrgh!  </s>
<s> Is this supposed to be a standard or just Yet Another Non-Standard (tm)!?  </s>
<s> The advantage of defining APIs in IDL, is that it it possible to grap any stub compiler for  </s>
<s> generating an API in any programming language.  </s>
<s> Then you just use CORBA to use, say a C++ implementation of DOM from Smalltalk or whatever.  </s>
<s> I'm still waiting for an IDL- SML97 mapping, so that I can use a C++ implementation of DOM from SML97, but that's another story...  </s>
<s> I think it is very unattractive to use a Java API which "more or less" maps to the DOM IDL files.  </s>
<s> Dot y'all agree with this?  </s>

<s> Hello XML'ers I am new to both CORBA and XML so my question might be off target.  </s>
<s> This discussion of wchar/wstring in IDL worries me.  </s>
<s> If it is true that the various operating systems implement wide characters in various byte  </s>
<s> lengths and encodings, how does proposing that a sequence be used in the DOM IDL help anything?  </s>
<s> It seems to me that by using the sequence in the DOM IDL spec.  </s>
<s> you are then asking each implementor to handle the data  </s>
<s> marshaling/unmarshaling for wide characters to/from any other platform.  </s>
<s> Is this true?  </s>
<s> Many thanks.  </s>
<s> -- Bennett Bennett Smith  </s>
<s> It would seem to be that either a) one is calling a DOM function via CORBA,and the ORB will handle the marshalling/translation .. or b) one is calling DOM from the same platform, so whatever wstring maps to on that  </s>
<s> platform is the same on both the calling side and the DOM implementation side.  </s>
<s> So I don't see that this is a problem, but maybe I'm missing something.  </s>
<s> Mike Champion  </s>
<s> And I don't think there's an IDL-to-ECMA Script mapping yet either.  </s>
<s> The reason we did the handcrafted Java bindings was because we thought the DOM interfaces, in general, don't need all the CORBA overhead.  </s>
<s> Lauren  </s>
<s> The DOM abstractly assumes a Unicode implementation.  </s>
<s> It shouldn't give any overhead to use the correct language mapping.  </s>
<s> You don't need to use CORBA, just make sure that the API is the same as if you were using CORBA, so that you won't end up having multiple "standards" / APIs.  </s>
<s> You might need some CORBA::Long, CORBA::Short etc. types etc., but I think that it really.  </s>

<s> As I see it, you will only be converting text when reading input  </s>
<s> from somewhere (an XML-file or whatever) and building a DOM hierachy.  </s>
<s> You might need this conversion anyway, depending on the file format etc.  </s>
<s> Then there's a conversion when rendering  </s>
<s> text output from a DOM hierachy, but that might still be necessay, depending on how / where it is rendered.  </s>
<s> If at least the DOM spec. is consitent, you have rules to follow.  </s>

<s> A message I meant to send to the entire list...  </s>
<s> OK, I have seen this...  </s>
<s> I just thought it was temporary, because your compiler / whatever didn't have wstrings yet (omniORB doesn't either...)  </s>
<s> I was planning to have this automatically generated in the IDL binding (which I am in the process of cleaning up so that omniORB will handle the DOM IDL correctly).  </s>
<s> Perhaps we should define this as DOMString instead?  </s>
<s> At least not wstring, since this is a reserved IDL word... Should this also go to the DOM-list?  </s>
