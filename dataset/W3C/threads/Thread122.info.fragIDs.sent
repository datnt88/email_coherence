<s> Hi Dave, first I have to tell that I really appreciate using TIDY.  </s>
<s> It is a wonderful tool.  </s>
<s> So I hope you don't mind when I report a problem to you that I got: I have to convert some Word 97 files to HTML and I use TIDY to clean them(means: I let TIDY create styles).  </s>
<s> That really works fine if there is no list included.  </s>
<s> If there is one TIDY does not convert the font attributes.  </s>
<s> I tried to set the options "--enclose-text true --enclose-block-text true" and hoped to get p class="xxx" ... p before the li tag but nothing like this happened.  </s>
<s> Do I have to set another option?  </s>
<s> I attach an example code (just if you want to try): TIDY's output: p class="c2" Experimente: /p li Autoabgase bilden mit Wasser S&amp;auml;uren /li li Schadstoffmessungen mit Nitritst&amp;auml;bchen /li li Bildung von Stickoxiden bei der Verbrennung von Benzin /li li Messungen mit der Gassp&amp;uuml;rpumpe /li li Quantitative Bestimmung von bodennahem Ozon in der Luft /li li Absorption von W&amp;auml;rmestrahlung durch Kohlenstoffdioxid /li  </s>

<s> Hi Bodo, your problem is not the style behaviour of tidy but the HTML syntax checker.  </s>
<s> Font containing list may give the desired effect on most browsers but is illegal HTML.  </s>
<s> You should fix the HTML first (use div with style options rather than font is probably easiest).  </s>
<s> What tidy does is the following: First it sees font ol .  </s>
<s> This is illegal.  </s>
<s> It thinks you forgot /font .  </s>
<s> So it changes it to font /font ol .  </s>
<s> It sees the empty font tags and deletes it.  </s>
<s> So your opening font is gone.  </s>
<s> After passing through the list it sees /font .  </s>
<s> Well no font is open any more so /font is also deleted.  </s>
<s> Now all font stuff is gone.  </s>
<s> Only finally tidy changes font stuff to style.  </s>
<s> But now no font stuff remained, so you cannot get the desired effect.  </s>
<s> For you tidy's behaviour might seem undesirable, but it is intended.  </s>
<s> Tidy is a very complex tool performing many tasks: * Pretty printing code * HTML markup corretions * HTML - CSS conversion Since there does not exist a flag for only HTML - CSS conversion, you always get the HTML markup corretions - whether you want them or not.  </s>
<s> Perhaps you might ask Dave for a flag that tidy performs only one of its various tasks (or all but one).  </s>
<s> To give you another example: The pretty printing of tidy introduces linebreaks which according to HTML should not matter - but which have effects for some browsers.  </s>
<s> Somoe users therefore might want a flag to use all of tidy's features but pretty printing...  </s>

<s> I can't really help you your Tidy problem, but I have a comment about your FONT tag.  </s>
<s> Firstly, I get the feeling that the FONT tag is generally frowned-upon by many in the "strict HTML compliance" community.  </s>
<s> I get the impression that using CSS instead is more desirable.  </s>
<s> Nevertheless, I still use FONT myself (my reasons for that are at the end of this email).  </s>
<s> Anyhow, I notice that you specify the "Arial" font.  </s>
<s> However, though I haven't been able to verify this personally, apparently the "Arial" rendering on Macs is pretty nasty.  </s>
<s> And, as such, it's recommended that you list other font alternatives in your FONT tag.  </s>
<s> For instance: FONT FACE="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica" ... More about this is font problem summarized here:  </s>
<s> So, that's my comment about your HTML code ;).  </s>
<s> But, I'd also like to briefly talk about the FONT tag in general, and why I use it.  </s>
<s> I would really like to use CSS in my pages, but it seems that Netscape and IE render font sizes differently (arghh!).  </s>
<s> Is there some solution around this, so that the fonts appear the same size on both Netscape and IE, while still using style sheets?  </s>

<s> Bodo uchc01@pop.uni-dortmund.de reported a problem with TIdy "losing" font information.  </s>
<s> Alexander Biron biron@ifh.de  </s>
<s> explained why that happens.  </s>
<s> But I wonder.  </s>
<s> Putting font ... /font around block-level stuff is an *extremely* common mistake.  </s>
<s> I very frequently see it wrapped around table , p , center , and other block level tags.  </s>
<s> Perhaps it would be possible to make a special case of font... Block-Level-Tag... ... /font and automatically convert it to div ... Block-Level-Tag... ... /div instead?  </s>
<s> No, I haven't a clue how to do that.  </s>

<s> Is there some solution around this, so that the fonts appear the same size on both Netscape and IE, while still using style sheets?  </s>
<s> There certainly isn't any solution using font .  </s>
<s> The people over in our IT Services unit don't understand why I complain about their use of absolute font size=N .  </s>
<s> *They* can read the result.  </s>
<s> But on my screen, it's microscopic.  </s>
<s> CSS was supposed to fix this by giving better, more portable, ways to specify font sizes.  </s>
<s> Don't forget the people using Opera, ICab, and Amaya (which seems to agree with Netscape most of the time on my SPARC/Solaris box).  </s>
