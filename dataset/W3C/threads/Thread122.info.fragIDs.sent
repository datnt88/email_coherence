Hi Dave, first I have to tell that I really appreciate using TIDY. 
It is a wonderful tool. 
So I hope you don't mind when I report a problem to you that I got: I have to convert some Word 97 files to HTML and I use TIDY to clean them(means: I let TIDY create styles). 
That really works fine if there is no list included. 
If there is one TIDY does not convert the font attributes. 
I tried to set the options "--enclose-text true --enclose-block-text true" and hoped to get p class="xxx" ... p before the li tag but nothing like this happened. 
Do I have to set another option? 
I attach an example code (just if you want to try): TIDY's output: p class="c2" Experimente: /p li Autoabgase bilden mit Wasser S&amp;auml;uren /li li Schadstoffmessungen mit Nitritst&amp;auml;bchen /li li Bildung von Stickoxiden bei der Verbrennung von Benzin /li li Messungen mit der Gassp&amp;uuml;rpumpe /li li Quantitative Bestimmung von bodennahem Ozon in der Luft /li li Absorption von W&amp;auml;rmestrahlung durch Kohlenstoffdioxid /li 
li W&amp;auml;rmeabsorption von Kohlenstoffdioxid in Abh&amp;auml;ngigkeit von seiner Konzentration /li li Modellversuch zum "Treibhauseffekt" /li li Weitere Experimente befinden sich in den angegebenen Artikeln /li Input: LI W&amp;auml;rmeabsorption von Kohlenstoffdioxid in Abh&amp;auml;ngigkeit von seiner Konzentration /LI LI Weitere Experimente befinden sich in den angegebenen Artikeln /LI /OL (The text is wirtten in German, I didn't translate it, because I thought it is not important ) I hope that there exists an easy solution for this problem :-) Thanks for your attention, so far.

Hi Bodo, your problem is not the style behaviour of tidy but the HTML syntax checker. 
Font containing list may give the desired effect on most browsers but is illegal HTML. 
You should fix the HTML first (use div with style options rather than font is probably easiest). 
What tidy does is the following: First it sees font ol . 
This is illegal. 
It thinks you forgot /font . 
So it changes it to font /font ol . 
It sees the empty font tags and deletes it. 
So your opening font is gone. 
After passing through the list it sees /font . 
Well no font is open any more so /font is also deleted. 
Now all font stuff is gone. 
Only finally tidy changes font stuff to style. 
But now no font stuff remained, so you cannot get the desired effect. 
For you tidy's behaviour might seem undesirable, but it is intended. 
Tidy is a very complex tool performing many tasks: * Pretty printing code * HTML markup corretions * HTML - CSS conversion Since there does not exist a flag for only HTML - CSS conversion, you always get the HTML markup corretions - whether you want them or not. 
Perhaps you might ask Dave for a flag that tidy performs only one of its various tasks (or all but one). 
To give you another example: The pretty printing of tidy introduces linebreaks which according to HTML should not matter - but which have effects for some browsers. 
Somoe users therefore might want a flag to use all of tidy's features but pretty printing...

I can't really help you your Tidy problem, but I have a comment about your FONT tag. 
Firstly, I get the feeling that the FONT tag is generally frowned-upon by many in the "strict HTML compliance" community. 
I get the impression that using CSS instead is more desirable. 
Nevertheless, I still use FONT myself (my reasons for that are at the end of this email). 
Anyhow, I notice that you specify the "Arial" font. 
However, though I haven't been able to verify this personally, apparently the "Arial" rendering on Macs is pretty nasty. 
And, as such, it's recommended that you list other font alternatives in your FONT tag. 
For instance: FONT FACE="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica" ... More about this is font problem summarized here: 
So, that's my comment about your HTML code ;). 
But, I'd also like to briefly talk about the FONT tag in general, and why I use it. 
I would really like to use CSS in my pages, but it seems that Netscape and IE render font sizes differently (arghh!). 
Is there some solution around this, so that the fonts appear the same size on both Netscape and IE, while still using style sheets?

For that matter, my X window system comes with neither Geneva or Arial. 
There is, however, Helvetica.

Bodo uchc01@pop.uni-dortmund.de reported a problem with TIdy "losing" font information. 
Alexander Biron biron@ifh.de 
explained why that happens. 
But I wonder. 
Putting font ... /font around block-level stuff is an *extremely* common mistake. 
I very frequently see it wrapped around table , p , center , and other block level tags. 
Perhaps it would be possible to make a special case of font... Block-Level-Tag... ... /font and automatically convert it to div ... Block-Level-Tag... ... /div instead? 
No, I haven't a clue how to do that.

There certainly isn't any solution using font . 
The people over in our IT Services unit don't understand why I complain about their use of absolute font size=N . 
*They* can read the result. 
But on my screen, it's microscopic. 
CSS was supposed to fix this by giving better, more portable, ways to specify font sizes. 
Don't forget the people using Opera, ICab, and Amaya (which seems to agree with Netscape most of the time on my SPARC/Solaris box).
