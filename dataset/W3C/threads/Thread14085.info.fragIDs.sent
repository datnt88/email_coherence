Chairs, I noticed Jason White mentioned in the WCAG minutes having a tool to maintain the issues list. 
The User Agent working group has been using a tool for the past 6 months. 
It is CGI based on perl scripts, if your interested in trying it, I set up a demo at: It creates both linear and table versions of the issues list and not can even mark issues that were raised during last call and proposed recommendation.
