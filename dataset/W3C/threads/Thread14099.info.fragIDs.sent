<s> Why is it necessary to provide alternate text for all images?  </s>
<s> I  </s>
<s> have been using JAWS for windows with Internet explorer.  </s>
<s> For example, at the top of every page on the kingston regional police site there is a banner surrounded by two thin blue lines.  </s>
<s> I feel that the lines are  </s>
<s> mostly aesthetic.  </s>
<s> Having 'thin blue line' read to me every time I visit a page doesn't mean much to me, it just takes up time.  </s>
<s> Is there a  </s>
<s> situation where alternate text for those thin blue lines would be useful?  </s>
<s> Thanks, Andrew.  </s>
<s> If the thin blue line is not a selection (link) or display spot, the alt can be ALT=''.  </s>
<s> If that banner is a link or supplies info (such as  </s>
<s> identifying the page name or contents), then there should be some text in the ALT associated with the Banner Image.  </s>
<s> Quoting an earlier mail that I don't seem to have seen,  </s>
<s> Well, trivially "because the HTML specification requires it"; more indirectly because there were good reasons for the HTML specification to require it.  </s>
<s> But in particular situations, it may well be reasonable for the provided text to be empty.  </s>
<s> And this seems to be such a case.  </s>
<s> So, why would the specification require it?  </s>
<s> Some thoughts... At least the presence of an ALT attribute may be some indication that the author has given the matter appropriate consideration.  </s>
<s> Text-mode browsers, by default, in the absence of an ALT attribute will typically display an indication such as [IMAGE], [INLINE], or [LINK] according to circumstances.  </s>
<s> This calls the reader's attention to the fact that the author had no sympathy for text-mode browsers!  </s>
<s> Right.  </s>
<s> The HTML4.0 spec, in an appropriate place, says: "Several non-textual elements (IMG, AREA, APPLET, and INPUT) require authors to specify alternate text to serve as content when the element cannot be rendered normally."  </s>
<s> Note that term: "alternative text to serve as content".  </s>
<s> This does not, in general, mean a visual description of the graphic.  </s>
<s> Rather, the appropriate thing to do is to provide text that stands as an alternative way of providing the _functionality_ for which the image is there.  </s>
<s> There are other parts of HTML syntax where the image can be described, if a description is appropriate: a brief description in the TITLE attribute, and the LONGDESC pointer to an extended description.  </s>
<s> Fully agree.  </s>
<s> Yes, but having the ALT text be "thin blue line" is probably not what's wanted in this context.  </s>
<s> If the author wanted to provide a figurative description of the Police Force as the "Thin Blue Line", they would have put that into their text already!  </s>
<s> If the image serves as a link, then its ALT text should be composed just along the same principles that you'd use in composing any normal link text: concentrate on the function of the link, not on the appearance of the image.  </s>
<s> If there's already some appropriate text within the scope of the same link, then the appropriate ALT attribute might still be an empty one.  </s>
<s> I hope this doesn't sound too dogmatic.  </s>
<s> I realise that some other commentators consider that a web page is an inherently visual experience, and that their job is to describe it in every detail to the reader.  </s>
<s> I take the other view (and it seems to be consistent with the issue that provoked this thread), that a web page possesses content, and that the author's job is to get that content to the reader, in whatever way is consistent with the facilities at the reader's disposal.  </s>
<s> The page "morphs" to fit the browsing situation, so as to get its content over optimally to the reader.  </s>
<s> Of course, if the web page is a picture gallery, then the pictures _are_ its content, so the result would be much the same by either set of principles.  </s>
<s> all the best  </s>
