<s> 1.) Some form of scripting.  </s>
<s> It would be very useful to be able to offer techniques for making scripts directly accessible.  </s>
<s> Yet, WCAG 1.0 says that you shouldn't do anything in script that you can't also do in noscript tag.  </s>
<s> This rules out a lot of useful features, so of which may even make a page more accessible to a user with a browser and accessibility aid that support it.  </s>
<s> There are browsers for all major platforms (including Windows CE handheld devices) that support these forms of scripting.  </s>
<s> Here's one possible way to define minimal script support: *ECMAscript (standards-based javascript) *some level of Document Object Model accessible by script (maybe the intersection of script supported by netscape 3 and the DOM level-1 spec?) *links in the javascript: format 2.) tables, including nesting.  </s>
<s> Note that this does not remove the requirement that tables linearize well for voice rendering.  </s>
<s> It just moves the onus to the assistive technology instead of the author.  </s>
<s> On a somewhat related topic, we should spend some time considering what to do about accessibility features that have been implemented in some browsers and not others.  </s>
<s> For example, IE 5 has implemented tabindex, accesskey, label, and other accessibility features that degrade gracefully on other browsers.  </s>
<s> It would be nice to see some techniques that say "use this spiffy new feature" instead of "don't use this crumby old feature".  </s>

<s> Thank you Cynthia for a "breath of light".  </s>
<s> Let us now praise discussing resolutions.  </s>
<s> She actually proposed something concrete and the resolutions are: some form of scripting; tables, including nesting; accessibility features that have been implemented in some browsers; I think all three proposals have a lot of merit.  </s>
<s> There may be others that would move the "line of backward compatability" forward a bit, for instance, Java enablement and security/signature/forms stuff.  </s>
<s> A "feature comparison"with the UAG might prove useful.  </s>
<s> Of course the devil in details and the wordsmithing of all this will be a big effort but perhaps this more generalized way of looking at any other possibly unspoken assumptions about what a browser must accomplish would help us resolve the "until" part of the user agent equation.  </s>
<s> The clearest "forward compatability" issues IMO are CSS, SVG, and XML (in all its flavors).  </s>
<s> There are already full-blown documents on their "accessibility-enhancing features" so we will decide just how strong our espousal of these *inevitabilities* should be.  </s>
<s> Polish the crystal balls and keep in mind the time line of getting WCAG 2.0 to recommendation (minimum of 2 Webyears) and the "when" of widespread use of CSS (already a huge start done) and vector graphics (Flash, anyone?).  </s>
<s> Love.  </s>
<s> ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE  </s>
<s> Hmm. The WAP forum sstates publibcly that they expect the next version of WML to be more or less the same as XHTML basic.  </s>
<s> I would like us to be able to use tables.  </s>
<s> I think we need to heavily push the use of assistive technologies such as tablin, in order to make this reasonable.  </s>
<s> I propose that the issue of who tracks that go to the coordination group.  </s>
<s> I agree that scripting would be very valuable.  </s>
<s> We need to determine still whether there is scripting support realisitically available.  </s>
<s> In particular, I have come across a lot of people using script-capable software but turning off the scripting becuase it interferes with their assistive technology, or because the operation of scripts is too disorienting.  </s>
<s> I am still hopeful that by the time these guidelines become a Recommendation this will have changed.  </s>
<s> I still believe that it is important that a solution is more or less freely available - particularly for countries where the cost of a computer is in fact higher than the cost of expertise to make it work.  </s>
<s> (In the USA, the cost of a computer is a small fraction of the cost of that expertise.  </s>
<s> In Vietnam, the cost of the expertise is a small fraction of the cost of the computer.  </s>
<s> And as a result of recent history there are a lot of people with disabilities in Vietnam.) cheers Charles Here's my very tardy action item on browser characteristics.  </s>
