Comments on Part 1: Encoding declaration The current draft requires that all text entities have encoding declarations unless they are encoded in UTF-8. 
(1) Internal entities Does this requiement apply to internal entities? 
Is it possible to apply different encodings to internal entities? 
The current draft is not very clear about this. 
(2) Duplication of encoding declarations. 
Suppose that we have a document comprising one document entity and one hundred external text entities. 
I believe that these external text entities should not be required to duplicate the same encoding declaration. 
The encoding specified for the root entity or an external text entity should be inherited by directly-referenced external entities, unless they have encoding declarations or they begin with a Byte Order Mark. 
(3) Autodetection Encoding information might be given by Internet protocols (http, SMTP, etc.). 
In Japan, there are many programs that automatically detect EUC_JP, Shift_JIS, and ISO_2022_JP. 
Some future implementations of XML will perform even more educated guess, as XML documents have a number of !,  , /, and / . 
(4) Proposed changes If an external text entity does not begin with a Byte Order Mark or an encoding declaration, XML processors may assume that this entity is in the same encoding as the entity that references to it. 
If a document entity does not begin with a Byte Order Mark or an encoding declaration, XML processors may assume that this entity is in the UTF-8 encoding. 
XML processors may use other information to detect the actual encoding method, but are not required to do so.

How could it? 
An encoding converts a sequence of bytes into a sequence of 
characters. 
The replacement text of an external entity is a sequence of bytes, so it needs an encoding to convert it into a sequence of characters. 
But the replacement text of an internal entity has been parsed and so is already a sequence of characters. 
SP does this. 
If you don't specify an encoding it gets inherited. 
I think of this as being similar to relative URLs.

You are right and I am not disagreeing. 
But I would like the draft to be clearer. 
Again, the draft should be clearer.
