Simple file length may not suffice, so it would be better to determine the checksum. 
Although the client could calculate this, it makes more sense to do so on the server side, to preserve bandwidth. 
The use of a simple checksum might be too prone to false positives. 
I'm not an expert on the topic, but apparently people have developed "fingerprinting" algorithms that have very low probabilities of mapping two texts to the same value. 
I found one citation on the topic: Rabin, M. O. "Fingerprinting by Random Polynomials" Center for Research in Computing Technology Harvard University Report TR-15-81, 1981 but I suspect there are others.

A "Last-modified" header currently exists to provide information on the modification of a file. 
However, this information can be inaccurate if the document is produced periodically by an automatic generator, as in the case of user's homepages.

This "ckecksum" information could be implemented either as a header to be provided by the GET and HEAD methods. 
However, since few clients would require such information, it makes more sense to restrict it to special methods: either HEAD, which anyway exists for such purposes, or perhaps some new method.

The content-MD5 document, RFC 1544, describes exactly such a header. 
Is this what you are looking for? 
Harald T. Alvestrand 
Yes. 
However, it's optional, and in fact, I've never seen it included with any HTTP-generated header. 
It would be nice if such a mechanism were formally included as part of the reply to a HEAD request, not for purposes of error-chjecking, but merely to know if the document has changed.

It's hard to RTFM when you can't find the FM.. 
According to Mordechai T. Abzug: 
Are there servers that produce an incorrect last modified date for files? 
I don't know of any, but if they exist then they are broken and the proper solution is to have them fixed. 
Of course the last modified date for a CGI script may be problematical, but I don't see how checksums could help this.

Both for: (1) automaticaly generated pages, which have new modification dates even when nothing new is added; and (2) CGI script outputs that represent a search.

I am new to this group, and need just a clarification... What is content-MD5 document? 
And where can I find more info on this? 
Thank you for any responses!! Vasu.
