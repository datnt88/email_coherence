<s> A "Last-modified" header currently exists to provide information on the modification of a file.  </s>
<s> However, this information can be inaccurate if the document is produced periodically by an automatic generator, as in the case of user's homepages.  </s>

<s> This "ckecksum" information could be implemented either as a header to be provided by the GET and HEAD methods.  </s>
<s> However, since few clients would require such information, it makes more sense to restrict it to special methods: either HEAD, which anyway exists for such purposes, or perhaps some new method.  </s>

<s> Both for: (1) automaticaly generated pages, which have new modification dates even when nothing new is added; and (2) CGI script outputs that represent a search.  </s>
