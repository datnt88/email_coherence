<s> Drawing a line in the sand to divide what is OK from what is not OK may not be the most appropriate response to all needs.  </s>
<s> Perhaps publishing reading-level information in page metadata is a way we can offer relief to the non-reader without banning reading from the Web.  </s>
<s> Al  </s>
<s> Several questions come to mind.  </s>
<s> First, can we come up with an objective rating system, vs a subjective one, in the area of readability ?  </s>
<s> An objective system is one that can be used reliabily by different persons and still give the same answer: e.g.  </s>
<s> I look at a page, I looked at the definition of reading level 0 to 4, and I say, this one is a 3, and so would anyone with the understanding of the definitions.  </s>
<s> In the field of metadata for protection of children (i.e. level of sex, nudity, violence, etc rating), the example would go like: a subjective rating system: 0 level of violence ok for toddler 1 level of violence ok for pre-teen 2 level of violence ok for teen 4 level of violence ok for adult an objective rating system: 0 No aggressive violence; No natural or accidental violence 1 Creatures injured or killed; damage to realistic objects 2 Humans or creatures injured or killed.  </s>
<s> 3 Killing with blood and gore 4 Wanton and gratuitous violence Whereas I wouldn't be able to come up with the same answer as my neighbour with the first system (what I find OK for my kids is my business), I would probably arrive at the same conclusion with the second (either I see gore - as defined out-of-band, either I don't).  </s>
<s> Anyway, that's the first issue, and the effort required to come up with a standard rating system in a given field is proportional to the difficulty of attaining objectiveness in the ratings.  </s>
<s> Conversely, without an objective rating system, we won't go very far there.  </s>
<s> The second point is deployment: say we have an objective rating system, how to we go about having people using it on their pages ?  </s>
<s> That means a syntax to encode it (PICS is possible, RDF too), promotion, tools to produce it, tools to filter on it, etc.  </s>
<s> I don't want to paint a dark picture here, but I've been on this path before with deployment of PICS and it's all but an easy path.  </s>
<s> DD:: "First, can we come up with an objective rating system, vs a subjective one, in the area of readability?"  </s>
<s> WL: Although probably not, it doesn't matter if what we are trying to do is to encourage authors to label *their* notion of "difficulty level" so that those who surf looking for *anything* to use for people with cognitive/learning/etc. problems can find something to look at.  </s>
<s> The biggest problem we've been hearing about is that there is a paucity of stuff out there.  </s>
<s> If we simply urge (without priority levels above three) inclusion of metadata to help find certain materials it might be useful to teachers, etc. who are sort of begging for more *stuff*.  </s>
<s> Love.  </s>
<s> ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE  </s>
<s> Hello all, This is my first post to this list, but felt I could answer the following questions.  </s>
<s> Objective rating system exists; text is measured in "grade levels" for readability.  </s>
<s> It's even possible to rate your own writing when you run the spell and grammar checker when you are finished writing.  </s>
<s> Both Word Perfect and Word 97 offer the option for Readability Statistics to be included with the spelling and grammar check.  </s>
<s> This site, found by looking up readability test in alta-vista, seems to be helping folks in the medical field do reradable documents: The page tells you how to use either Word Perfect or Word to determine the readability of a document, and suggests that you use a readability level less than 10.0 in medical office documents (with a caveat to limit medical jargon) so that patients with less than an PHD can understand what they are signing.  </s>
<s> And pages with a little advice on increasing readability of text at: Hope this is some help in understanding that the task is do-able.  </s>

<s> Enabling Support Foundation  </s>
<s> Daniel and others, CAST has done a bit of work in this area and remains unhappy with the readability measures that currently use fixed lists, special vocabulary matches, sentence length, and other wildly differing methods to determine readability.  </s>
<s> The best methods are expensive and time consuming and are not based on simple algorithms.  </s>
<s> We will settle on one (or more) shortly because we feel that those who use our text-to-speech eReaders should be provided with clues about how easy content might be to read prior to using tts support.  </s>
<s> It will provide an estimate at best.  </s>
<s> It is a very imperfect science but educational publishers have to do it for textbooks using controlled vocabulary, sentence length, paragraph length, concept difficulty, etc.  </s>
<s> All of this is made more complicated by the mix of readability and intended audience.  </s>
<s> We don't really want adults reading material which was originally written for 4th graders simply because that is the appropriate reading level for their skills.  </s>
<s> This might be ok if they are still struggling with learning  </s>
<s> to read but it is not ok if they are trying to figure out why there was a War Between the States.  </s>
<s> By the way, I am convinced that metadata wrappers should be used for this purpose.  </s>
<s> Our commercial affiliate, Universal Learning Technology (ULT), created a tool that creates IMS compliant metadata for text and media objects stored in databases so that they can be used to create web pages on the fly or re-purposed by professors and/or publishers for course creation.  </s>
<s> It is now part of a product called Bravo but will soon be joined with ULT's newly acquired WebCT to provide this capability to web course authors.  </s>

<s> Correction, Chuck, we really DO want adults with a 4th grade reading level  </s>
<s> to be able to access information on the causes of the Civil War, and if they must read material which was originally written for 4th graders in order to do so, they should not be dissuaded.  </s>
<s> An aside: Even among the PHD's who can write well above the head of the 4th grader, there is no ready concensus on the "why's" of that war!!!! Anne Anne L. Pemberton apembert@crosslink.net  </s>

<s> Not sure I can agree with you on this one.  </s>
<s> An intelligent adult with reading difficulties should have access to content that was prepared for someone who is a bit more worldly than a 4th grader - especially if they want to understand that the Civil was caused by reasons more complex than might be exposed by a 4th grade history textbook.  </s>
<s> As you point out, even scholars disagree on this and I would want the adult to be exposed to the complexity of factors.  </s>
<s> I speak from the point of view of my experience as a teacher and administrator in elementary, middle and high schools and as an instructor for both undergraduate and graduate courses in education, learning disabilities, and educational technology.  </s>

<s> Drawing a line in the sand is a foolish way to go, but not the only way to use the metadata.  </s>
<s> One of the smarter uses of PICS was in ordering serach engine results.  </s>
<s> This could be done similarly.  </s>
<s> An interesting project for the ER group might be to take the Robot, attach a program which makes some basic guesses at readability (I don't believe the scales used are incredibly reliable, but if they can be automated for MS Word I assume they can just as easily be automated on their own), and build a labelling bureau.  </s>
<s> It could use PICS, or use RDF to build a "what's related" service, and it could be used as a filter over a set of search results.  </s>
