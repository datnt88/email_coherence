I cant seem to get APACHE 1.3.17 
Linux to allow WRITING. 
Ive searched the web and despite a few HOW-TO's, I cant get webDAV to work write. 
Has anyone experienced the same with APACHE? 
Is there any good sites for setup for ISP's? 
Thank you in advance mj@newsnet2000.com 
We use Apache 1.3.17 
(on solaris tho) here with mod_dav i assume thats what you mean ? 
we allow some of our users to "publish" and use WebFolders to manage some of the files... 
I had a problem a while back with the DAV database file beeing owned by the wrong user, this caused a similar problem... "Dav locks could not be engaged....." Hope this helps, -Steve Check out webdav.org, and email Greg Stein gstein@lyra.org .
