Amaya 7.2 is much better than 6.3 on Windows XP. However there remains a major problem with the configuration and installation. 
It affects many users and should be simple to fix. 
My amaya is using C:\AMAYA as it's user configuration directory. 
WHY!? 
This will ruin any chance of using amaya with either multiple users on one machine, or with network roaming user profiles. 
Actually, on the 'General Preferences' panel it shows 'C:\\amaya' for the 'Amaya user directory'. 
Why the double \\ ? 
INSTEAD, amaya should do what any good windows software does and use the Windows environment variable APPDATA as the path to the parent directory of the amaya user directory. 
This works with Windows2000 and XP. OR, if you want to read the registry there is an entry that works with Win98 and WinME as well as Win2K and WinXP. 
It should point to the same place as the environment variable APPDATA: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Shell Folders : AppData PLEASE make this single change to the next version of Amaya and I can recommend it to the network administrators to add to their campus-wide lab image. 
And thank you for making the www a better place.

(864) 656-0550 voice Hello Charles, Following some requests on this list, the Amaya user directory for NT, 2000, and XP architectures is now being stored at: $HOMEDRIVE:\$HOMEPATH\Amaya\config This is documented in the Configuration help page (note that I have a typo there and added two \\... cut and paste problem from the source code). 
Can you tell me if those environment variables exist in your box? 
The double \\ seems to tell that you don't have a HOMEPATH environment variable defined. 
The problem is that this is the third change we do to this code for finding the Windows user home dir. 
It seems it's not always the same even in the same architecture. 
Some of the solutions that were proposed require a new system library. 
That is, all users would need to apply a service pack on their boxes to be able to install Amaya if we used functions from that library. 
This didn't sound reasonable to us. 
I'm willing to change it again, but we need to make sure it's the standard way. 
I've not found much documentation on this so far. 
Ideas are welcome. 
-jose Well, I just looked at the environment vars in XP, and I found no APPDATA :-) Probably the best way to cope with this is a multilayer approach: - if the environment variable AppData exists, use it as home directory; - otherwise, if the environment variable UserHome (or something like that) exists, use it as home directory; - otherwise, complain with user and tell her to set up a suitable environment variable; - if she forces a "go on", use C:\Amaya\ . 
ciao, .mau. Let's take advantage of other open source projects and see how Mozilla or some other program does it. 
From what I see, the starting point to find this out is somewhere around Brant Langer Gurganus If "Actions speak louder than words," how is that "The pen is mightier than the sword."? 
I think Brant Langer Gurganus is on the right track. 
The one and only CSIDL you want to use is CSIDL_APPDATA (0x001a): from CSIDL_APPDATA (0x001a) Version 4.71. 
The file system directory that serves as a common repository for application-specific data. 
A typical path is C:\Documents and Settings\username\Application Data. 
This CSIDL is supported by the redistributable Shfolder.dll for systems that do not have the Microsoft? 
Internet Explorer 4.0 integrated Shell installed. 
Basically 'Version 4.71' means it will work in any version of Windows except Win95. 
And it will work in Win95 if the user has the IE4 integrated shell. 
In the rare case of Win95 without the IE 4 shell, MS provides Shfolder.dll.
