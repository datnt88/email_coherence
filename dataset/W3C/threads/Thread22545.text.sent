Miles, I wasn't aware that there was anything in HTML4 that had a case-sensitive name; could you provide an example or two? 
Neither was I, until a couple of weeks ago when I started going through the spec with a fine-tooth comb. 
Because you raised the issue, I went back and 'scanned' the spec again and found nothing about case-sensitive names. 
Aren't you perhaps refering to case-sensitive ATTRIBUTE VALUES and not case-sensitive NAMES? 
If so, then only that affects the HTML layer of the DOM spec are the following facts: 1. 'id' attribute value is case-sensitive. 
2. 'name' attribute value may or may not be case-sensitive depending on the element. 
Agree? 
Don Park Docuverse Seemingly so. 
Unfortunately, the HTML DOM documentation uses the term "name" in the sense "value of the 'name' attribute" rather than the sense employed in clause 3.2.1 of HTML 4.0. 
For example, the getElementsByName method returns elements with a given attribute value for the 'name' attribute, rather than a given HTML name (= SGML general identifier, XML element type).
