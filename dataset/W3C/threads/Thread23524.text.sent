From returns of compareDocumentPosition: Returns how the given node is positioned relatively to this node (i.e., "the reference node"). 
From constants: DOCUMENT_POSITION_FOLLOWING: The node follows the reference node. 
The first sentence would indicate that "this node" and "reference node" are synonyms. 
However, the second sentence expects "the node" to be distinct from "reference node". 
I'd recommend using "this node" (the node on which the method is invoked) and "other node" (the node passed as a parameter) and remove mentions of "given" and "reference" nodes in this context. 
Like: Returns how the other node is positioned relative to the node on which the method is invoked. 
DOCUMENT_POSITION_FOLLOWING: The other node follows this node. 
As an alternative to "other node", we could also consider "parameter node" or "node passed as a parameter"... a bit more verbose but avoids any question about the intent. 
(I'd almost be tempted to render "this" in boldface when we're using it as a keyword to signify the-node-which-is-performing-the-operation, but I don't think I can see the WG on that idea.) Joe Kesselman, IBM Next-Generation Web Technologies: XML, XSL and more. 
"The world changed profoundly and unpredictably the day Tim Berners Lee got bitten by a radioactive spider." -- Rafe Culpin, in r.m.filk Couldn't the name of the parameter be used? 
This seems an easy way to keep the text both simple and clear. 
Ugh. 
It would have to be defined somewhere as well; not all languages prefer "this" as the name for the object on which the method is being called. 
(Of course, I don't know of any really good way to refer to that object with having a defined keyword of some sort in the text.) -Fred Fred L. Drake, Jr. fdrake at acm.org PythonLabs at Zope Corporation
