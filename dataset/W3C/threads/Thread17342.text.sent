Hi all, We are in the process of developing a non-US government web site that facilitates the exchange of large amounts of information, most of which exists as either Word or PDF files. 
While the word documents contain mostly textual information, a significant proportion of the PDF files contain detailed geographic maps and plans. 
Understanding the information contained in these maps and plans is central to effective use of the system. 
We have no control over the authoring of these Word and PDF files (the web site simply facilitates the movement of them), and it is critical to the success of the system that users are able to provide information in both Word and PDF format. 
Our question is this: what steps should we take in order to ensure that the site is Level-AA compliant? 
We are proposing that a short summary be provided of all textual Word &amp; PDF documents, along with clear directions to users on how to get in touch with someone to request the information in another format or to have it read to them (an email link or telephone number). 
For maps and plans, we are proposing that a short two sentence summary be provided, along with clear directions to users on how to get in touch with someone to either request the information in another format or to have the maps and plans described to them (an email link or telephone number). 
From a practical standpoint, it is going to be extremely onerous to provide detailed descriptions of the visual information contained in the system. 
Given the above considerations about the system itself, would the suggested steps above be considered Level-AA compliant? 
If the proposed approach is not Level-AA compliant, what steps should we take to ensure that the system does conform with the relevant Level-AA checkpoints? 
Thanks, Rachel Seems to me that there are two different types of questions being asked. 
One more policy related and one technically related. 
The first is "What do I do about non-HTML format documents, Word and PDF? and the second, "What to do about complex images of geographic maps and plans - regardless of the format?" 
[by the way, what is a geographic plan?] 
Let me discuss the second question first. 
If the complex images were in HTML documents would they be any more easier to describe? 
No - from your statement "it is going to be extremely onerous to provide detailed descriptions of the visual information". 
So the harder issue seems to be about providing the detail descriptions - not so much the format. 
If that is the main issue, and you are still going to provide a contact to get the detail description; then it would seem to me that you could "capture" the detail descriptions as they are requested and publish them to the sight so you only have to "capture &amp; create" the detail descriptions once. 
If the issue is more complex than my assumption; for example, say the images are so complex and have so many uses that you don't know for sure, until asked, what information the person is looking for. 
If it was a satellite photograph of an area, the person could be looking for a comparison with a street map, or to see the outline of the islands compared to their recollection of their last holiday in the area, or to see the land use in agriculture vs native jungle, or what ever. 
You need to ask yourself what information are you trying to provide by including the geographic maps? 
Is that information available in text somewhere else? 
For example the satellite image may be redundant to the tabular data about the agriculture percentages in the area, or the population density in the area, etc. so that the information you are trying to provide may be available in another means. 
If the information is not available in another means, then you need to decide what you are trying to provide and start collecting, creating, or capturing the information and publish it along with the geographic maps. 
If the site is public, then I would recommend HTML format for the detail descriptions. 
Now my first policy related question about non-HTML WORD and PDF documents. 
If its an internal intranet site, then you may have more knowledge and/or control over the configurations of your users - so non-HTML formats may not be an issue. 
For example, your users have the technology for displaying the Word and PDF formats and they are compatible with the deployed screen magnifiers, screen readers, and keyboard navigation aids. 
The Word and PDF documents still have to provide the short and detail descriptions of the images, i.e., the geographic maps. 
If it is a public site, then in my opinion this W3C WAI list does not have a mission to discuss the policy question. 
In other words, is it a policy debate about whether you need to provide HTML formats of the Word and PDF documents? 
You already seem to have a policy or at least a goal to comply with WCAG 1.0 level-AA based on your question. 
Since WCAG 1.0 doesn't contain checkpoints for making Word and PDF directly accessible, then you need to consider extending your policy or converting the whole system so it can handle the W3C HTML format. 
I'm not sure from your statement: "it is critical to the success of the system that users are able to provide information in both Word and PDF format." if the definition of system includes the end users or just the software? 
If the software can only handle attaching and moving Word and PDF files, then it would seem to be a poorly (as in it should handle more file types) architected software system.

Regards, Phill Jenkins, IBM Accessibility Services To make the thing accessible you are going to have to take onerous steps it seems. 
Currently maps are an interesting, but difficult part of accessibility. 
The problem is, as Phill said, knowing what the critical information in the map is. 
Likely it is more than a couple of sentences. 
However, I would strongly suggest that you look at how to collect geographic information in a re-useable way, and not just a description of the map. 
Looking at Semantic Web technology, the work of groups like OpenGIS, or similar, is likely to help in the medium term to reduce the workload, since you will begin to re-use existing information. 
If you don't have a functional alternative form for the map you can't claim level A conformance to WCAG... Cheers Chaals On Monday, Sep 1, 2003, at 16:38 Australia/Sydney, Carey, Rachel Charles McCathieNevile Fundaci?n Sidar charles@sidar.org http://www.sidar.org 
I'm assuming the site is an Australian government site. 
If that's the case, you should be aware that the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission have given some advice on the use of PDF, viz: "The Commission's view is that organisations who distribute content only in PDF format, and who do not also make this content available in another format such as RTF, HTML, or plain text, are liable for complaints under the DDA." See: http://www.hreoc.gov.au/disability_rights/standards/www_3/www_3.html 
One of the main problems with PDF concerns accessibility issues associated with the document format--but this is only part of the problem. 
Even when users have the technology required to access information presented in this format, there can be content elements which have not received appropriate treatment to support accessibily (like using structural formatting for headings, etc. or text equivalents for images). 
Inappropriate treatment of non-text content elements also apply to the use of Word, RTF and HTML documents (although when using Word .doc 
format, the additional barrier of requiring the user to have the relevant software to open to the document is added into the mix). 
From my (completely non-legal) understanding of the DDA, any site whose publishing policy was to publish inaccessible content in inaccessible formats and then ask disabled users to (a) take the extra time and effort required to make contact with the organisation, and (b) wait until their request for accessible information was processed, would have a hard time trying to resist a strong legal challenge. 
Legal issues aside, I don't think there's any way that such a site could claim Level-A let alone Level-AA compliance. 
My advice--if the organisation is concerned about policy approaches that support accessibility, rather than just being able to make conformance claims--would be to contact HREOC for advice. 
If you are able, contact Bruce Maguire. 
He has an extremely pragmatic, balanced approach. 
Hope that helps. 
Cheers, Dey * be provided, along with clear directions to users on how to get in touch * with someone to either request the information in another format or to * have the maps and plans described to them (an email link or telephone That would probably meet the legal requirments in the UK (IANAL), as long as the phone service was available on all days and at all times that the web page was available, but it doesn't, in my view, allow you to claim compliance with the checkpoint. 
It would probably also meet the accessibility requirements. 
However, publishing the map topology in some agreed standard format, whilst possibly raising intellectual property protection issues, would get closer to providing accessibility with the online version. 
(There is always a conflict between intellectual property protection and accessibility.) Wide definition accessibility (the "Access Systems", not the Joe Clark one) might not fit well with the use of such a format, though, and there is probably no solution that is ideal for everyone.
