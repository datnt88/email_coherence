I wish Freedom Scientific would specify the date of issuance of documents like these, *but* the release notes for version 4.51 of Jaws are up. 
I'm presuming this is a relatively new document. 
Googling for previous mentions on this list found nothing. 
At any rate, lots of apparent improvements in HTML interpretation.

I use a Mac and even I think that there's nothing wrong with operating-system-specific software. 
I'm having a hard time imagining a world in which everything works on every imaginable system. 
Access Systems' complaint here has nothing to do with improved accessibility for disabled people. 
It's purely an anti-Windows reflex.

Author, _Building Accessible Websites_ although the target is not a bulls eye, we will not achieve comparable and equivilant access till we knock down that barrier.

Author, _Building Accessible Websites_ as a Mac user (as is my daughter) I would think you would also be a little tired of a M$centric computer philosophy. 
as long as they still remember the other systems if a significant portion of people with disabilities cannot use the accessible features and I complain why is this not improved access for people with disabilities. 
oh I complain about stuff that is written only for the latest and greatest windoze versions, will the newest Jaws work on windoze 95, or 98, or heaven forbid, 3.1???? many many people in other countries still consider it a major upgrade to be able to finally be able to use W95.
