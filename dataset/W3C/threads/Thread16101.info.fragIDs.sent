There is currently no mention of WWW robots in the UA guidelines. 
I am 
not sure exactly what the accessibility issue is related to robots and user 
agents. 
If you feel there is an issue please send it to me or the group for consideration. 
Thanks, Jon

Hi Jon 
Robots should benefit from accessible HTML design (i.e. they don't understand "click here"; often they can't follow framed sites or clever Javascripted sites, etc.) So an accessible site following WAI guidelines should result in a site being indexed. 
However there is also the issue of whether developments which will aid robot software (such as site mapping standards) will also potentially provide accessibility benefits. 
For example would the ability to process link information independently of the HTML resource be of use? 
IE5 provides the capability now (using the DOM, although it could be done in other ways). 
For example an RDF-based sitemap schema which defined relationships between related resources would be of use for indexing purposes (no point in indexing the same resource in HTML, Word and PDF formats more than once) and might also be of use for accessibility purposes. 
Definitions for site mapping is not happening within W3C. 
Netscape are doing something for Mozilla and various library communities are working in this area. 
My question is whether any of the W3C WAI groups should be involved in ensuring that these (third-party) sitemapping schemas are developed with the needs of the disabled communities taken on-board. 
(Note that this may be out-of-scope for WAI, as W3C are unlikely to be standardising a sitemapping schema). 
Note that I *think* that there should be benefits (based on informal discussions with people) but would find it helpful if there was some discussion on this topic.

I think this issue is probably better suited for Web Content, or Protocols and Format.

The issue of generating accessible site maps is already addressed by Authoring Tools. 
The use of metadata is already addressed to some extent by Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (although not with specific reference to robots). 
I would encourage you to look into those and see if there is something further which those groups should be covering.
