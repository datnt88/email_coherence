<s> ---sig off--- Abstract This document provides guidelines to user agent manufacturers for making their products more accessible to people with disabilities and for increasing usability for all users.  </s>
<s> This document emphasizes the accessibility of interoperability between two important classes of user agents - graphical desktop browsers and dependent assistive technologies (screen readers, screen magnifiers, braille displays, and voice input software).  </s>
<s> However, it is meant to be applicable to user agents in general, including text and voice browsers, multimedia players, and plug-ins.  </s>
<s> *dp* lang I propose we change manufacturers to either developpers or manufacturers / developpers or manufacturers and or developpers or some permutation there of?  </s>
<s> This being as some will develop for manufacturers and some will develop for other reasons.  </s>
<s> If a manufacturer, of course, it is the primary responsibility of the manufacturer to put the stamp of approval on the product.  </s>
<s> 1. Introduction For those unfamiliar with accessibility issues pertaining to user agent design, consider that many users may be using documents in contexts very different from your own: * They may not be able to see, hear, move, or may not be able to process some types of information easily or at all.  </s>
<s> * They may have difficulty reading or comprehending text.  </s>
<s> * They may not have or be able to use a keyboard or mouse.  </s>
<s> * They may have a text-only screen, a small screen, or a slow Internet connection.  </s>
<s> * They may not speak or understand fluently the language in which the document is written.  </s>
<s> * They may be in a situation where their eyes, ears, or hands are busy or interfered with (e.g., driving to work, working in a loud environment, etc.).  </s>
<s> *dp* lang the use of the word document above fits well with the wcad, but since this is the ua document, shouldn't the word application be here instead?  </s>
<s> Or even better, user agent sans browser?  </s>
<s> The guidelines in this document are designed to help developers understand and thereby reduce accessibility barriers that impede access to the Web.  </s>
<s> The associated Techniques Document ([UA-TECHNIQUES]) provides practical solutions based on existing and upcoming technologies.  </s>
<s> Though developers may believe that implementing accessibility features in their products is difficult or of limited use, considering accessibility during the design phase of a product leads to more flexible, manageable, and extensible software.  </s>
<s> *dp* slant earlier in the document, we tallk about hands busy and eyes busy, so I propose that we change the above and similar wording to reflect a more positive move integrating features that make access more universal?  </s>
<s> I have taken a stab at this below: The guidelines in this document are designed to help developers understand and thereby impliment solutions which broaden accessibility to the Web.  </s>
<s> The associated Techniques Document ([UA-TECHNIQUES]) provides practical solutions based on existing and upcoming technologies.  </s>
<s> Though developers may believe that implementing accessibility features in their products is difficult or of limited use, considering accessibility during the design phase of a product leads to more flexible, manageable, and extensible software.  </s>
<s> these guidelines include information relevant to a wide class of user agents: graphical desktop browsers, screen readers, speech synthesizers, multimedia players, text browsers, voice browsers, plug-ins, etc., with a particular focus on two classes of user agents: 1. Graphical desktop browsers 2. Dependent user agents, which rely on other user agents for input and/or output.  </s>
<s> Dependent user agents include: + screen magnifiers, which are used by people with visual impairment to enlarge and change colors on the screen to improve readability of text and images.  </s>
<s> + screen readers, which are used by people who are blind or with reading disabilities to read textual information through speech or braille displays.  </s>
<s> + alternative keyboards, which are used by people with movement impairments to simulate the keyboard.  </s>
<s> + alternative pointing devices, which are used by people with movement impairments to simulate mouse pointing and button activations.  </s>
<s> *dp* lang in the document's opening , we discuss dependant assistive technology, should not the nomenclature be more consistant?  </s>
<s> 3.3 Describe product features known to promote accessibility in a section of the product documentation.  </s>
<s> [Priority 2] Techniques for checkpoint 3.3 *dp* lang a note here about action description though we may not want to be this specific.  </s>
<s> I propose we add something here about writing the documentation so that it is clearly designed in an approach that is device independant such as not using click here or press enter here unless alternatives are also specified.  </s>
<s> Guideline 4. Allow the user to configure the user agent Next guideline: 5 | Previous guideline: 3 | Go to contents Subhead here.  </s>
<s> Individuals with disabilities have a wide range of functional capabilities and so they must be able to configure the user agent to meet their particular requirements.  </s>
<s> Users must be able to configure rendering, mouse, keyboard, user interface control position, etc. to facilitate their daily use of the software.  </s>
<s> *dp* slant see above comments for a slant on this but perhaps the words web users instead of individuals with disabilities could be used.  </s>
<s> One of the problems with selling accessibility is that it has the smack of catering to a particular clas or classes of individuals.  </s>
<s> Refer also to guideline 2. Refer also to checkpoint 9.10.  </s>
<s> Guideline 5. Allow the user to turn off features that may reduce accessibility Next guideline: 6 | Previous guideline: 4 | Go to contents Subhead here.  </s>
<s> Some rendering behavior may make the user agent unusable or may obscure information.  </s>
<s> For instance, people with photosensitive epilepsy must be able to turn off flashing within certain ranges, otherwise the flashing may trigger a seizure.  </s>
<s> Users who require specific color contrasts or who have low vision need to be able to turn off background images if those images interfere with their ability to read text.  </s>
<s> Dynamically changing web content or opening windows can be a problem for people using some types of dependent user agents and may be disorienting to users with cognitive disabilities.  </s>
<s> *dp* clarification also, flashing causes my screenreader to repeat the flashed material every time it flashes.  </s>
<s> User agents are only expected to provide this control for content or user interface controls that it recognizes.  </s>
<s> Please also refer to guideline 6 and guideline 4. 5.1 Allow the user to turn on and off rendering of images.  </s>
<s> [Priority 1] Techniques for checkpoint 5.1 5.2 Allow the user to turn on and off rendering of background images.  </s>
<s> [Priority 1] Techniques for checkpoint 5.2  </s>
<s> 5.3 Allow the user to turn on and off rendering of video.  </s>
<s> [Priority 1] Techniques for checkpoint 5.3 *dp* question what is the justification for this?  </s>
<s> 5.4 Allow the user to turn on and off rendering of sound.  </s>
<s> [Priority 1] Techniques for checkpoint 5.4 5.5 Allow the user to turn on and off rendering of captions.  </s>
<s> [Priority 1] Techniques for checkpoint 5.5 5.6 Allow the user to turn on and off animated or blinking text.  </s>
<s> [Priority 1] Note.  </s>
<s> This is particularly important for users with screen readers.  </s>
<s> *dp* note this makes my earlier point.  </s>
<s> Techniques for checkpoint 5.6 5.7 Allow the user to turn on and off animations and blinking images.  </s>
<s> [Priority 1] Techniques for checkpoint 5.7 5.8 Allow the user to turn on and off support for scripts and applets.  </s>
<s> [Priority 1] Note.  </s>
<s> This is particularly important for scripts that cause the screen to flicker, since people with photosensitive epilepsy can have seizures triggered by flickering or flashing in the 4 to 59 flashes per second (Hertz) range.  </s>
<s> Techniques for checkpoint 5.8 5.9 Allow the user to turn on and off support for user style sheets.  </s>
<s> [Priority 1] Techniques for checkpoint 5.9 5.10 Allow the user to turn on and off support for author style sheets.  </s>
<s> [Priority 1] Techniques for checkpoint 5.10 5.11 Allow the user to turn on and off support for spawned windows.  </s>
<s> [Priority 1] Techniques for checkpoint 5.11 *dp* question What happens if a window is not spawned and that action predicates something that must be done by the user such as filling a form?  </s>
<s> 5.12 Allow the user to turn on and off rendering of frames.  </s>
<s> [Priority 2] Techniques for checkpoint 5.12 *dp* question similar to above?  </s>
<s> 5.13 Allow the user to turn on and off author-specified page forwards that occur after a time delay and without user intervention.  </s>
<s> [Priority 3] For example, when turned off, offer a static link to the target resource instead.  </s>
<s> Techniques for checkpoint 5.13 *dp* question is this not a wcad issue with regard to what is rendered or can the ua make this call?  </s>
<s> 5.14 Allow the user to turn on and off automatic page refresh.  </s>
<s> [Priority 3] For example, when turned off, allow the user to refresh the page manually instead (through the user interface).  </s>
<s> Techniques for checkpoint 5.14 Guideline 6. Ensure user control over document styles  </s>
<s> Next guideline: 7 | Previous guideline: 5 | Go to contents Ensure that the user has control over the colors, fonts and other stylistic aspects of a document and can author styles and user agent default styles.  </s>
<s> In order to access a document, some users may require that it be rendered in a manner other than what the author intended.  </s>
<s> Users with visual impairments, including color blindness, may be insensitive to certain colors and may not be able to perceive author-specified or user agent default color combinations.  </s>
<s> Users with reduced visual acuity, including people who are older, may require larger fonts than user agent defaults or those specified by the author.  </s>
<s> Users who are blind may require audio or tactile rendering.  </s>
<s> Users who are deaf may require captions for audio files.  </s>
<s> User agents must therefore allow the user to control: * The document's style (e.g., fonts, colors, aural parameters, etc.) * The document's formatting: whether the document is presented textually, graphically, linearly, aurally, for tactile use, or some combination of these.  </s>
<s> * The document's content.  </s>
<s> This means whether primary content or alternative representations of content or both are rendered.  </s>
<s> * The user interface.  </s>
<s> Since authors may make changes to the user interface through scripting (e.g., by spawning new windows, causing dialog boxes to appear, etc.), users must be able to override changes that make the user agent or document inaccessible.  </s>
<s> Otherwise, users who are blind, have low vision, color deficiencies, some types of learning disabilities, or any user who cannot or has chosen not to view the primary representation of information will not know content of the information on the page.  </s>
<s> *dp* lang insert the word "the" above?  </s>
<s> Guideline 7. Ensure user access to document content Next guideline: 8 | Previous guideline: 6 | Go to contents Ensure that users have access to primary as well as author-supplied alternative representations of content (descriptions of images, captions for video or audio, etc.) Otherwise, some users cannot perceive the primary content due to a disability or a technological limitation (e.g., browser configured not to display images).  </s>
<s> The primary or alternative content may be rendered to the user though character, graphic, audio, speech, or braille devices.  </s>
<s> The differing characteristics of these devices mean that user requirements and capabilities will vary.  </s>
<s> *dp* proof though above should be through.  </s>
<s> For example, speech is a temporal medium.  </s>
<s> Speech output based browsers must convey sub-structures of text content like paragraphs, sentences, words and the spelling of individual words to the user as certain words or phrases may not be properly converted from their original text to their correct speech pronunciation.  </s>
<s> By conveying sub-structures of text, user agents allow users to replay and even spell words and phrases until the user understands the content and context.  </s>
<s> Speech-based user agents must use auditory nuances - including pitch, articulation model, volume, and orientation - to  </s>
<s> convey meaning the way fonts, spacing, and borders do in graphical media.  </s>
<s> For example, a user agent might speak the word "header" before the text content of a header or "item 1.4" before a list item to convey context.  </s>
<s> Speech-based user agents must also heed author-specified markup that indicates changes in natural languages,  </s>
<s> and should render appropriately for supported languages.  </s>
<s> *dp* lang the word link before a link is a good example of this.  </s>
<s> *dp* comment general I like 9. Guideline 10. Notify the user of document and view changes Next guideline: 11 | Previous guideline: 9 | Go to contents It is important to alert users, in an output device-independent fashion, when important events occur during a browsing session.  </s>
<s> To avoid confusion that the effects of scripts may cause, users should be notified when scripts are executed (or be able to disable scripts entirely).  </s>
<s> This is also important for security reasons; users should be able to decide whether to allow scripts to execute on their machines.  </s>
<s> 10.1 Provide information about document and view changes (to the user and through programming interfaces).  </s>
<s> [Priority 1] For example, inform the users when a script causes a popup menu to appear.  </s>
<s> Techniques for checkpoint 10.1 *dp* proof should not users be user?  </s>
<s> or drop the word the in the users and just leave users?  </s>
<s> 10.2 Ensure that when the selection or focus changes, it is in the viewport after the change.  </s>
<s> [Priority 2] Techniques for checkpoint 10.2  </s>
<s> 10.3 Allow the user to configure the user agent for notification of certain types of document changes only.  </s>
<s> [Priority 3] Techniques for checkpoint 10.3  </s>
<s> *dp* Lang This is unsettling to me.  </s>
<s> I feel it should be differently put because it doesn't convey exactly what is meant or what I percieve it to mean.  </s>
<s> I'd like this to allow me to have the opportunity to pick one or several from a list of things I want to be notified about?  </s>
<s> It has something to do with the word only.  </s>
<s> 10.4 When loading a document, make available what portion of the document has loaded, whether loading has stalled, and when the user may begin to browse.  </s>
<s> [Priority 3] Techniques for checkpoint 10.4 10.5 Make available what portion of the document the user has viewed.  </s>
<s> [Priority 3] Note.  </s>
<s> Depending on how the user has been browsing, the percentage of document viewed may be calculated according to focus position, selection position, or viewport position.  </s>
<s> Techniques for checkpoint 10.5 10.6 Allow the user to request to be prompted before a form is submitted.  </s>

<s> Your comments are preceded by *dp*.  </s>
<s> Question 1) 5.3 Allow the user to turn on and off rendering of video.  </s>
<s> [Priority 1] Techniques for checkpoint 5.3 *dp* question what is the justification for this?  </s>
<s> IJ: I believe that the idea here is that video may be distracting and that some users may want to turn it off.  </s>
<s> There may also be bandwidth issues and one would want to turn off video in order to get, say audio or captions more rapidly.  </s>
<s> Question 2) 5.11 Allow the user to turn on and off support for spawned windows.  </s>
<s> [Priority 1] *dp* question What happens if a window is not spawned and that action predicates something that must be done by the user such as filling a form?  </s>
<s> IJ: I agree that could be a problem, but the same might be said for scripts that are turned off but that perform some vital function.  </s>
<s> Authors shouldn't write pages that way.  </s>
<s> I've just written a proposal to delete this checkpoint in any case since I believe it's intention is covered by a later checkpoint.  </s>
