makes clear that this stuff isn't clear for non-geek/nerd folks. 
begins to look a bit more like human language but still the various ":, @, and #" symbols aren't all that friendly. 
The effort to explain the function/process/structure of our central language is now going to move forward. 
Sean will try to answer all our naive questions and anybody who has a better grip than I is encouraged to leap right in with proposals for a "prose" rendition. 
Len wrote a sort of introduction some time back as to what its purpose is but the details are only clear to folks like him, Daniel, and Sean with Charles able to convince anyone except DanBri that he also can speak this dialect. 
We have to get this through what Wendy can write down, Gregory can figure out, and Al can explain to me. 
For example, the idea that the above URIs reveal a schema that somehow fully describes this language and that it is so simple (only two {count 'em 2} possible "statements"), yet looks like the recipe for flying to Mars is a bit daunting. 
Its very simplicity enables it to evaluate and report on just about anything - from document through language via guidelines! 
It is a fundamental tool for the Semantic Web in that it gives "power to the people" who can say anything about anything. 
Love. 
ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE 
It also makes it clear that XML RDF is less than adequate for communicating RDF model ideas on a person to person basis. 
Too many pointy brackets. 
This is certainly something that needs Wendy/Al/Gregory-izing: how to explain the concept of a *data-model* to a public that doesn't even know where to begin. 
My own extraordinarily crude and sub-standard attemps are attached as  0.95primer.html  . 
These are more like "notes" than an attempt at a cohesive reference document - I abandoned it early on. 
We have a couple of problems with "EARL for dummies":- 1) The syntax. 
To create a model, you need a syntax, but then people get bogged down in it, and forget what it was they were learning about. 
I want to learn about EARL, and now you're telling me to go read up on XML Namespaces, RDF Model and Syntax, and Notation3? 
Why can't it just be EARL? 
We have to explain that EARL is built on top of these thing, but also to provide people with just enough information so that they can understnad EARL. 
No more. 
If they want more information, they can always follow the links. 
2) The model. 
How do we represent this in a media-independant manner? 
Clearly, we need some easy-to-understand text... simple introductions, lots of examples. 
Daniel/Charles hit upon this in the teleconference. 
Anyway, that's a little bit to be thinking about. 
The attached primer isn't all that good... but it's a start.

You ought to carve that on a rock somewhere. 
These little "pockets" of SW philosophy are starting to show up all over the place, so it's clear that the notions behind the coding are stating to become more pervasive - more accessible. 
As for the complexity... it reminds me of when Homer was working on his tax return, and accidentally proved that God didn't exist. 
Even processing small stuff on the CWM scale, you can get unexpected (sometimes good, sometimes bad) results. 
For example, I wrote my little RDF Lint thing, and ran it on a schema that I'd been writing... the stuff that it outputted had some extrememly important triples that I wouldn't have spotted in a million years! 
What was incredible to me though is that I wrote both the schema, and the parser... and yet my own invention pointed out something to me. 
Scary. 
With EARL, the actual power of the instances will be very low. 
In fact, the system is almost achingly simple - I really can't understand why it's taking so long for the idea to spread. 
Maybe it is too simple. 
Still, the fact is that, yes, the schema is pretty complex in parts to someone who has no concept of RDF or the Semantic Web. 
But its power will hopefully enable it to convert EARL 0.9 statements into EARL 0.95, and for machines in the future to make even more outstanding conclusions based upon it. 
And the funny thing is, even the Semantic Web ideals are a total flop, we still have a format that works just as well as any other data model. 
We can't lose. 
Still, I hold onto the hope that 99% of the Semantic Web "principles" of evolution, transformation, and inference will be realized. 
On a small scale, the assertions aren't actually all that grand... the main thing needed to go from 0.9 to 0.95 is the following filter (I think - haven't tested anything yet):- { { :x a earl9:TestResult; :y :z } log:implies { :x a earl:ResultProperty; :y :z } } log:forAll :x , :y , :z . 
It's certainly not long, and not really all that difficult that it can't be 80% explained to a layman/woman in a few seconds (if I were Al maybe). 
One important thing though is that you need to be able to bootstrap yourself into the Semantic Web - to understand the rules behind the terms. 
At the moment, we're severly lacking in terms that allow people to make inferences - we have DAML equivalentTo and some of the logic stuff, but we need more if we're going to do this properly. 
More primitives, please :-) Still, it's looking pretty darn good.

There is a chunk of my page on the conformance thing that Danbri and I did which explains it in words and pictures (for those with Amaya - most others just get the derived text equivalent) without referring to syntax at all. 
I think this is a smart way to go in explaining EARL for dummies. 
How to make an actual EARL expression can follow later for those who want to write tools, or want to hand-code stuff. 
(Actually the image I have is not unlike the text that Sean used, and breaks back to almost exactly the same - http://www.w3.org/1999/11/conforms/ for the curious) Chaals We have a couple of problems with "EARL for dummies":- 1) The syntax.
