<s> Hello: I am wondering if I could get feedback on these issues below: As far as anyone knows are there any devices, such as PDAs ,Cell phones etc that are built for people with disabilities?  </s>
<s> And, does the section 508 law require mobile devices to comply?  </s>

<s> I have forwarded your question to Doug Wakefield, who is one of the folks leading up the effort for the Access Board.  </s>
<s> I have asked if there has been consideration for a FAQ page or way to submit questions.  </s>
<s> I am seeing many more questions on 508 and fear folks may be speaking for the Access Board with having permission or being half right or whatever.  </s>
<s> I would rather err on the side of caution and prefer to have an official opinion rendered from the Access Board.  </s>
<s> We can discuss this but I am not the authority ? the access board is.  </s>
<s> Cheers, rob  </s>

<s> That's an excellent point -- the W3C is _not_ responsible for Section 508 compliance, and yet many people ask for "official" answers on the WAI lists.  </s>
<s> The definitive word on 508 has to come from the Access Board, not the W3C.  </s>
