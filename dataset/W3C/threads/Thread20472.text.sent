Hi, I'm using Amaya 5.3 with jigedit and still occassionally losing the very end of my docs. 
It tends to be the $Id: $, but that's just what I usually put at the end. 
Is this an amaya bug or a jigedit bug? 
Anything to do about it?

Hi Dany, It's difficult to say immediately if it's a amaya or a jigedit bug. 
We need more information to find the origin of the bug. 
The best would be to have a document that always generates the bug, but that could be a dream. 
In any case point us to the document that caused the trouble. 
We will try to save it in a temporary directory on the server available for testing this kind of things. 
Hi Irene, I believe that the doc on which it happened was but I fixed the source manually, so I don't know if there will be any evidence left. 
As I recall, when the file was damaged the end looks something like: p $Id: I added back the /body /html and all was well. 
Next time this happens, I'll try to save the document in its buggy form.
