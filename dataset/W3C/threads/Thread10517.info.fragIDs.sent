Character Model for the World Wide Web 1.0 W3C Working Draft 22 August 2003 First one since April 2002. 
Interesting wording: [[This is a W3C Working Draft published between the second Last Call on 30 April 2002 and a planned Candidate Recommendation. 
This 
interim publication is used to document the progress made on addressing the comments received during the second Last Call, as well as other modifications resulting from continuing collaboration with other working groups. 
A list of last call comments with their 
status can be found in the disposition of comments (public version, Members only version). 
Work is still ongoing on addressing the comments received during the second Last Call. 
We do not encourage comments on this Working Draft; instead we ask reviewers to wait for being informed about our disposition of their comments, or for Canditate Recommendation in case of new comments. 
... ]] maybe we could have something similar? 
The changes aren't entirely clear since they are in a member only web page that could be updated at any time compared to the above.

They got very close to CR a month or two ago ... I would certainly prefer this sort of wording in our SOTD for the 5th Sept publication. 
I guess that is Eric's call, as advised by the chairs. 
Jeremy 
The difference between the txt below and that they're anticipating a CR as their next phase, whereas LC2 looks more likely for us. 
I don't feel the need to nail that one down at this stage though... 
There are a few phrases might be worth borrowing though. 
This 
Perhaps dropping 'interim' since we don't name our next stage?

Sorry, I had missed that you had already sent a satisfactory draft for SOTD. 
I've reread and commented on the (section of the) process document. 
Your suggeted text This Working Draft consolidates changes and editorial improvements undertaken in response to feedback received during the Last Call publication of the RDFCore specifications which began on 23 January 2003. is more elegant (IMHO) than the text you copied out below. 
Let's pretend I hadn't spoken!

Thanks. http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/TR/templates/sept-wd-sotd.html seems ok by you, Graham and Brian. 
I suggest we go with it, if Eric and others have tweaks they shouldn't be too big. 
Ok next job, RDFS tweaks from Graham then revisit pubrules then Lbase... Dan

Looks OK to me. 
Incidently: I didn't receive Dan's original email in this thread and only got this one since it was sent direct to me. 
The W3C list archives don't have any September emails so I couldn't check. 
Seems like something is still amiss.
