<s> This is in the guidelines as a P1, with the relative priority description spelled out.  </s>
<s> I think that it should really be marked as relative priority (although I am not too concerned either way).  </s>
<s> The Pro is that the requirement is one that has relative priority, and the contr is thatrelative priority is defined in termsof WCAG.  </s>

<s> I think it would further confuse, as 7.1 is relative to UA not WCAG, but I agree it should not be listed as a P1, that gives the wrong impression.  </s>

<s> Folks, We didn't have much actual meeting today - Jan, Gregory, Jutta and I turned up, and briefly discussed meeting timelines a little, and whether anyone had a good idea about how to label the priority of 7.1 - mostly in terms of how it should appear in the checklist.  </s>
