Attached is a document mapping the 5 November 2003 draft of HTML techniques for WCAG 2.0 [1] to the 17 November 2003 draft of WCAG 2.0 [2]. 
This is work done by Ben Caldwell, David MacDonald, and me a couple months ago. 
These mappings should appear in the next draft of the HTML techniques. 
Note that this is only a set of possible mappings to use as a starting point for discussion. 
The document is a working document but should be ok to figure out.

I disagree with "The title element: 2.4.1.x ? 
need to create a success criterion" Guideline 4.1 says, "use technologies according to spec." "title" is a required element in HTML 4.01 [1], thus html:title must be used and is covered by success criterion/guideline 4.1.

(Okay...HTML 4.01 Title element specs) Every HTML document must have a TITLE element in the HEAD section. 
( title A web page /title so far I'm using the element according to spec. 
But wait, there's more...) Authors should use the TITLE element to identify the contents of a document. 
Since users often consult documents out of context, authors should provide context-rich titles. 
Thus, instead of a title such as "Introduction", which doesn't provide much contextual background, authors should supply a title such as "Introduction to Medieval Bee-Keeping" instead. 
( Okay time to revise. 
title A new page on David's site. 
/title Yes, HTML 4.01 spec compliant and being so, Guideline 4.1 met!) Might there be a need to expand on what the title element specs are in HTML 4.01 and Guideline 4.1's "use technologies according to spec." to improve access. 
Expanding on "Authors should use the TITLE element to identify the contents of a document" to perhaps identify that when you publish a report from hard copy to html, one success criteria might be to ask the question...Are the titles the same? 
If they are not, why not? 
Also, "context-rich titles" is extremely subjective.

I disagree with "The title element: 2.4.1.x - need to create a success criterion" Guideline 4.1 says, "use technologies according to spec." "title" is a required element in HTML 4.01 [1], thus html:title must be used and is covered by success criterion/guideline 4.1.

(not related to David's question): I should clarify that in my previous message I was disagreeing that we need to write a new success criterion and that I believe Guideline 4.1 is sufficient. 
(responding to David)... 
Could you explain why this should be a success criterion? 
I think this is too specific for a success criterion and propose that we generalize the idea and expand on it in Techniques. 
In other words, we can provide examples and general guidance about writing good titles. 
Publishing a report online could be one example. 
Yes, "context-rich" is subjective. 
We could provide guidance in the HTML Techniques document.

(responding to wendy) 1. 
Because the original document already has a title given by the document author. 
2. So people who know the title of the document can search and access the document from a search engine that displays the correct title in the title element. 
I would agree that the idea needs to be generalized, but I still think there should still be some success criteria for the title element beyond relying on Guideline 4.1. 
As you noted... "Guideline 4.1 says, "use technologies according to spec." "title" is a required element in HTML 4.01 [1], thus html:title must be used and is covered by success criterion/guideline 4.1." 
Yes, "title" element must be used is covered, but I think how it used to improve accessibility is not covered to the extent it should be in HTML 4.01.

Just to explain the thinking on this - it's true that title is required by the HTML spec and that is enough to require it in HTML techniques under Guideline 4.1 (use valid code). 
If we thought title was important solely for that reason, we would have mapped it that way, as we did with some other elements. 
But we were thinking that, in addition to being part of valid code, there are specific accessibility benefits of this element. 
It was for that reason that we were trying to map to 2.4.1 (facilitating orientation in content). 
A parallel situation is the "alt" attribute of img . 
That, too, is required for conformance to the HTML 4.01 DTD, but it is also important for accessibility beyond simply that, and so we map that to Guideline 1.1 (text alternatives for non-text objects). 
Perhaps the thing to do is, for those techniques that have an accessibility benefit beyond simply leading to valid code, we should map those techniques 
to the appropropriate guideline/success criterion, as we were trying to do with title . 
If there is a technique for valid code that does not otherwise have a specific accessibility benefit we can think of, we should map it to 4.1, or perhaps just have a general technique mapped to 4.1 that says "validate your code". 
A current technique that might be an example of this case is 2.3, the !DOCTYPE statement: unless we find that browsers handle 
accessibility features of documents differently based on doctype, we might not see a need to explicitly call out a requirement for it but would expect that to be captured in the validation process.

This rationale makes sense to me.
