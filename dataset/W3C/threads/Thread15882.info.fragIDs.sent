<s> ... 99% will never write a stylesheet for the non-visual media, at  least in the near future.  </s>
<s> WL:: Because humans still have 12-month years and we are working in a medium with 90-day years, this perception of "never" in connection with style sheets (and HTML 4, for that matter) can work to our advantage.  </s>
<s> It just *seems* like accessibility is a back burner item because the WAI itself is less than one human year old!  </s>
<s> Yet we are already implanted in lots of minds.  </s>
<s> While individual authors may be unaware of the problem (let alone the Initiative grin ), the possibility of new authoring tools trumpeting that they are "HTML 4.0 READY" is going to be a big plus, particularly if we get them to join us in publicizing the importance of accessibility to everyone, with the inclusion of people with disabilities as a fortunate side-effect.  </s>
<s> In the year since WAI's intro things have moved positively and if you think back ten years (an easy task as you age) Web Access was unheard of because the Web was mostly a fantasy!  </s>
<s> Style Sheets will be used because their application will be made transparent to authoring tool users by the programs themselves.  </s>
<s> Workarounds to get the paragraphs placed "properly" on the page will be unnecessary because the competition among authoring tool makers will lead to almost trivial inclusion of CSS without the user even knowing what the "C" stands for.  </s>

<s> I was talking to a person from Lotus and they said they were rewriting all their applications to save in the HTML/CSS format as their native format.  </s>
<s> So even if you never publish to the WWW users of those tools will be using these standards.  </s>
<s> So HTML/CSS is being used for more than the WWW.  </s>

<s> While this is good, it's also a danger.  </s>
<s> Because HTML/CSS doesn't allow for everything that advanced document tools need, a lot of "meta" data is thrown in.  </s>
<s> In the form of meta-blocks and custom tags that can only be read by the applications themselves.  </s>
<s> It's good that it'll advance HTML/CSS eventually.  </s>
<s> For example, when AOL and MSN announced that they would support "open" internet standards, everyone cheered because they felt that the sites would be accessible via any browser.  </s>
<s> As it turned out, both services loaded up their sites with ActiveX controls and Java applets and forced you to use their own browsers to work with the sites.  </s>
<s> Yes the were using HTML, but just as a carrier for closed objects.  </s>

<s> Responses to chuck are marked by JRG  </s>
<s> JRG: I think that Chuck makes a good point is that many compainies will use the customization capabilities (loop holes) in the standards to try force people to their companies products.  </s>
<s> This will probably only get worse as XML gains popularity.  </s>
<s> JRG: If the semantic information is separated from the presentation information it will probably be good.  </s>
<s> My main point of the message was that HTML/CSS could be used for more things than just WWW publishing.  </s>
<s> This would increase its popularity, but as chuck points out may not improve universal access.  </s>
