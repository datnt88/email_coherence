<s> Why can't I copy text from the "PARSING.ERR"  </s>
<s> window in Amaya (from the "Views" menu) in Windows?  </s>
<s> What I mean is, there's a list of errors, and I wish to select them with the mouse, and click control-C and then paste them someplace else (or peraps save the whole window as a text file, and open it there).  </s>
<s> It doesn't work, however, and I have to re-type them all by hand.  </s>
<s> Is this a feature or a bug?  </s>

<s> The "PARSING.ERR" window is a sort of Text window.  </s>
<s> On Unix platforms you can copy the content of that window like in other windows.  </s>
<s> I'll see why it doesn't work on Windows platforms  </s>
<s> Yes. Irene.  </s>

<s> Curious.  </s>
<s> I noticed that on my copy of Emacs in Windows, I could not use control-V to paste text into Emacs from the Windows clipboard; but I could do it if I used "Paste" from the edit menu.  </s>
<s> Later I realized that in Emacs, this was done with control-Y --just like in Linux!  </s>
<s> :) Later today I'll try doing a middle click (I've only got two buttons on my laptop, but I think I can reconfigure them to do a middle-click in combination with a control key or something).  </s>
<s> I'll try that and other Unix-y things to try &amp; get copy &amp; paste to work with Amaya.  </s>
<s> Thanks,  </s>
