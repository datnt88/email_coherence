Why can't I copy text from the "PARSING.ERR" 
window in Amaya (from the "Views" menu) in Windows? 
What I mean is, there's a list of errors, and I wish to select them with the mouse, and click control-C and then paste them someplace else (or peraps save the whole window as a text file, and open it there). 
It doesn't work, however, and I have to re-type them all by hand. 
Is this a feature or a bug?

The "PARSING.ERR" window is a sort of Text window. 
On Unix platforms you can copy the content of that window like in other windows. 
I'll see why it doesn't work on Windows platforms 
Yes. Irene.

Curious. 
I noticed that on my copy of Emacs in Windows, I could not use control-V to paste text into Emacs from the Windows clipboard; but I could do it if I used "Paste" from the edit menu. 
Later I realized that in Emacs, this was done with control-Y --just like in Linux! 
:) Later today I'll try doing a middle click (I've only got two buttons on my laptop, but I think I can reconfigure them to do a middle-click in combination with a control key or something). 
I'll try that and other Unix-y things to try &amp; get copy &amp; paste to work with Amaya. 
Thanks,

Problem solved in the CVS version.
