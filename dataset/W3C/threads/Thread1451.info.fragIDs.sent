<s> What happened to the DAV:version-controlled-binding-set Working Collection property, in draft 17? Section 14.3 ends a bit abruptly, and  </s>

<s> Thanks, Alison.  </s>
<s> The statements and opinions expressed here are my own and do not necessarily represent those of Oracle Corporation.  </s>
<s> Unlike a collection version (whose member state is defined in its DAV:version-controlled-binding-set), the member state of a working collection is defined by its actual bindings (i.e. internal members).  </s>
<s> This allows a client to atomically add new members (i.e. members added to the working collection by PUT and MKCOL), delete old members, or rename members, in a single atomic operation (i.e. the CHECKIN of the working collection).  </s>
<s> There was a draft that incorrectly associated DAV:version-controlled-binding-set with working collections, but that was fixed in draft 17.  </s>
<s> The working collection is no longer in the Resource Classification appendix because it is just a working resource that happens to be a collection.  </s>
<s> So we could say that a working collection has the properties/methods of both a working resource and a collection, but this was felt to be obvious enough to not require a section in the appendix.  </s>
<s> We could add it back in if this is not in fact as obvious as was originally thought.  </s>

<s> In Xythos first generation server, locking a VCR locks the VHR and all VERSIONS.  </s>

<s> Note that we have been told that in order to support global properties we should have people do a PROPPATCH on the VHR.  </s>
<s> In my model of how that would work, the real resource being modified is the VCR and all versions of the file -- not the VHR -- and a PROPFIND on the VCR should see the global properties.  </s>
<s> If the VCR is locked, a PROPPATCH that modifies its state should fail.  </s>
<s> It has been pointed out to me that this was probably not what the list meant.  </s>
<s> If such properties (set on the VHR) were not visible on the VCR and you had to access the VHR to get them then someone implementing that should allow a lock on the VHR.  </s>
<s> However, in that case I wouldn't see 'setting VHR properties' as being a way to implement global properites.  </s>
<s> I'd drop my plans to support PROPPATCH on the VHR, hence the reason to lock the VHR.  </s>

<s> From: John Hall [mailto:johnhall@xythos.com] In Xythos first generation server, locking a VCR locks the VHR and all VERSIONS.  </s>
<s> DeltaV defines these as completely different resources, and it has been previously mentioned that they should be locked independently.  </s>
<s> Yes, it is fine for your client to present a model to the user that a lock on a VCR also locks the VHR, but to be compatible with the protocol, that should be marshalled as two LOCK requests, one to the VCR and another to the VHR.  </s>
<s> A VHR is not appropriately a target of a PUT or a PROPPATCH on my system.  </s>
<s> What meaning could they have?  </s>
<s> A PUT is undefined on a VHR (just as PUT is undefined on a collection and an activity).  </s>
<s> PROPPATCH is meaningful ... it gives the VHR a property (DAV:displayname, or some custom property).  </s>
<s> Note that we have been told that in order to support global properties we should have people do a PROPPATCH on the VHR.  </s>
<s> The way this would work is that your GUI would display both the properties of a VCR as well as the properties of the VHR, thus effectively displaying the VCR as "inheriting" the properties of its VHR.  </s>
<s> You would have to make some decision about what to do in the case of conflicts (i.e. when both the VCR and VHR have the same property with different values).  </s>
<s> A client would be responsible for deciding whether a the property is a "global" (on the VHR) or "local" (on the VCR) property (assumedly based on some GUI gesture from the user).  </s>
<s> In my model of how that would work, the real resource being modified is the VCR and all versions of the file -- not the VHR -- and a PROPFIND on the VCR should see the global properties.  </s>
<s> If the VCR is locked, a PROPPATCH that modifies its state should fail.  </s>
<s> Your client can present any model that it wants, but to interoperate with multiple servers, it needs to adhere to the DeltaV semantics, in which the VCR and VHR are separate resources with their own locks.  </s>
<s> Similarly, your client can do whatever it wants in terms of displaying a global property model, but to provide an interoperable form, it must use DeltaV/WebDAV compatible requests (such as modeling global properties as properties of the shared VHR).  </s>

<s> meant.  </s>
<s> If such properties (set on the VHR) were not visible on the VCR and you had to access the VHR to get them then someone implementing that should allow a lock on the VHR.  </s>

<s> Either the operation is moot, or (in the case of guidance we have received on global properties) the proper lock is on the VCR not the VHR.  </s>
<s> I agree that being able to lock a VHR is of neglibible value.  </s>
<s> Someone might decide to implement global properties by placing them on the VHR, in which case being able to lock a VHR would be of value to that client, but not a very compelling use case for me.  </s>
<s> Next, we have past versions.  </s>
<s> Past versions are not mutable (there goes PUT and PROPPATCH).  </s>
<s> A non-forking server such as mine does not allow past versions to be checked out.  </s>
<s> LABEL isn't supported, but is LABEL supposed to honor a write lock?  </s>
<s> I'm not so sure.  </s>
<s> See section 1.8, Versioning Methods and Write Locks: If a write-locked resource has a non-computed property defined by this document, the property value MUST NOT be changed by a request unless the appropriate lock token is included in the request.  </s>
<s> Since every method introduced in this document other than REPORT modifies at least one property defined by this document, every versioning method other than REPORT is affected by a write lock So yes, labels are controlled by write locks, but since the LABEL method gives you incremental add/delete capability, there is little or no reason to "lock" the version for a LABEL request.  </s>
<s> So I see no reason to support a LOCK on a past version.  </s>
<s> I agree.  </s>
<s> Locking a version is even less likely/important than locking a VHR.  </s>
<s> A CHECKOUT creates a 'state that can be modified'.  </s>
<s> In the case of Checkout-In-Place, that is logically the VCR.  </s>
<s> I'm told that there shouldn't be a real version in this case that can be accessed independently of the VCR.  </s>
<s> Again, only a VCR lock makes sense.  </s>
<s> I agree.  </s>
<s> Locking a VCR is the prime locking use case.  </s>
<s> Yes, I note that I must provide for a lock on a working resource.  </s>
<s> Yes, although since a working resource has an obscure URL, it is unlikely that anyone will try to use your working resource, so locking is probably not all that important for working resources.  </s>
<s> I'm just trying to find a reason whey I should allow it anywhere else.  </s>
<s> I'm not seeing one.  </s>
<s> If you only handle locking of a VCR, I believe you will handle 98% of the important use cases.  </s>

<s> 'Modeling' global properties as properties of the VHR in such a system is necessarily a proprietary design.  </s>
<s> It is simpler to just say that DeltaV does not provide global properties, period.  </s>
<s> For properties to be global, I have to be able to get them by doing a propfind on the VCR or any particular VERSION.  </s>
<s> If I have to go to two completely different places with two completely different requests, then they are not behaving as global properties.  </s>
<s> Pretending that they are would only confuse people.  </s>
<s> Global Properties are still useful, though.  </s>
<s> But the only real way I can see them being implemented is adding something like a scope attribute to the prop element like: I assume that servers that don't support global properties would just ignore the scope attribute.  </s>
<s> The concept of global properties is not defined in the protocol, so either your clients or your servers (or both) will need to adopt some non-standard convention to support the concept.  </s>
<s> An advantage of the "VHR property" approach is that only the clients need to understand the convention (you can use standard DeltaV servers).  </s>
<s> An advantage of the attribute approach you describe below is that any client can see the global properties (but only special servers can be used).  </s>
<s> So either approach has its advantages and disadvantages.  </s>
