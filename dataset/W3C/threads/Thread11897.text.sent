Ian and Charles, here is my re-wording, refer to the 14 Oct draft for the original http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/WAI-AUTOOLS-19991014/ Note: I asked an "IBM editor" to review this also for a second opinion, but don't have any feedback yet... 1.2 Checkpoint priorities Each checkpoint has a priority level. 
The level reflects the impact in meeting the goals of this document. 
Goals of the Authoring Tools Accessibility Guidelines: That the authoring tool be accessible That the authoring tool generate accessible content by default That the authoring tool encourage the creation of accessible content The three priority levels are assigned as follows: [Priority 1] If the checkpoint is strong essential /strong to meeting those goals [Priority 2] If the checkpoint is strong important /strong to meeting those goals [Priority 3] If the checkpoint is strong beneficial /strong to meeting those goals [Relative Priority] Checkpoints that refer to the generation, providing, or checking of Web content have multiple priorities. 
The priority is dependent on the priority in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines [WCAG]. 
It is a priority 1 for some Web content to be available in alternative formats otherwise, one or more groups strong will /strong find it impossible to access the information. 
For example alternative text for images is a priority 1. 
Therefore, it is a priority 1 for the authoring tool to generate, provide, or check for alternative formats of some types of information. 
It would be a priority 3 for the authoring tool to generate, provide, or check for formats that one or more groups strong may /strong find somewhat difficult to access the information. 
For example, expansion of abbreviations and acronyms with ABBR and ACRONYM elements by using the "title" attribute is a priority 3. It is priority 1 to implement that part of the checkpoint for content which is a priority 1 requirement in [WCAG]. 
It is priority 2 to implement that part of the checkpoint for content which is a priority 2 requirement in [WCAG]. 
It is priority 3 to implement that part of the checkpoint for content which is a priority 3 requirement in [WCAG].

I propose a slight rewording: Some checkpoints that refer to the generation, providing, or checking of Web content have multiple priorities. 
The priority is dependent on the priority in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines [WCAG]. 
For example providing alternative text for images, and audio is a priority 1 requirement in WCAG since otherwise one or more groups will find it impossible to access the information. 
Therefore, it is a priority 1 requirement for the authoring tool to check for (4.1) or ask the author for (3.1) alternative formats of these types of information. 
Expansion of abbreviations and acronyms with ABBR and ACRONYM elements by using the "title" attribute is a priority 3 in WCAG. 
Therefore it is only priority 3 for the authoring tool to check for (4.1) or ask the author for (3.2) this information. 
Where the numbers are linked to the relevant checkpoint. 
Thoughts?

while i don't have an issue with your rewording (it is, i think, somewhat clearer than what is in the 14 October draft [reference 1], i do object to the P3 example you chose, as i (and there are others who share this view) do not think that the expansion of ACRONYMs and ABBRs should have been rated a P3 by WCAG... while i know that that is a fact of life that i have to live with -- at least for now -- i would prefer if you used a less contentious example of a P3 authoring practice, such as: Checkpoint 13.10: Provide a means to skip over multi-line ASCII art [reference 2] or Checkpoint 5.6 Provide abbreviations for header labels. 
[reference 3] i realize that i am probably over-reacting to an arbitrary choice (ACRONYM and ABBR expansion is the first-listed P3 in the checklist), but i did want to air my concerns... gregory.

WebMaster and Minister of Propaganda, VICUG NYC I understand the concern about the ABBR and ACRYN example, another example would be fine. 
I found the "skip over the ascii art" a little more confusing for tool developers since it would required too much author intervention to satisfy. 
I.E., how does the tool know it's an ASCII ART? 
But adding the ABBR tag for complex table headers should work... it just seemed trivial except for "long" table headers. 
I.E. how does the tool determine "long"? 
- more than two words? 
I'll review the P3 list one more time to see if I can find a better example. 
Two quick choices include 4.3 Identify the primary natural language of a document. 
[P3] [the tool could prompt/check for lang= in the HTML tag, but who cares] 13.5 Provide navigation bars to highlight and give access to the navigation mechanism. 
[P3] [this would actually be very useful if the tool would help "highlight" nav bars, but the techniques in WCAG need more work Regards, Phill Jenkins, aloha, phil! 
thanks for your reply... personally i like the ABBR for table headers example, but i guess it is up to the editors!
