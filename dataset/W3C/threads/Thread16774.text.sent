Greetings, accessibility crusaders. 
This is my first post to the list, but I lurk with much interest as I try to get my knowledge of Web access beyond the basic level. 
Apologies in advance for asking such a basic question on the list, but it's been driving me nuts and I'm sure someone will be able to answer it easily. 
Do most screen readers always need a full stop to know whether a sentence has ended? 
Does this apply to vertical lists as well? 
I'm a writer who specializes in plain language and clear design. 
Often we use vertical lists with bullet points to break down longer constructions, and lately people who review my drafts have taken issue with the fact that I always add a period after the last bullet point. 
My argument has been that, from what I understand, if the info will be posted online a screen reader will need the period to register and thus convey that it's the end of the sentence; if the period weren't there, the reader would just continue reading to the next line without a pause. 
I have often used similar logic in deciding to put periods in other parts of Web information where I want a full pause after the word, where I might normally use other punctuation such as colons or em dashes. 
Was leaving the period in a vestige of older screen readers, or an older version of HTML? 
Or is my assumption still accurate? 
Many thanks for your help, Michelle Black Dear Michelle, Firstly, I am sure that everyone will join me in saying that no question is too stupid - we all have to start somewhere. 
Now, to your question... 
It is my experience that a screenreader will require a full stop in order for the user to know that a sentence has ended, otherwise it just keeps on reading. 
I have also found that this is true for vertical lists, although other punctuation - such as comma, semi-colon and colon - will cause the reader to pause slightly. 
If you are writing for clear and concise purposes, then a full stop will help people distinguish where they are and also aid you in keeping sentences clear and simple. 
Forgive me if someone else out there knows different, but when taken in the context of the rest of your message, I feel that this would be the correct answer. 
Anyone else? 
Kind regards to all Sime Behalf Of michelle.black@sickkids.ca

Many thanks for your help, Michelle Black The better question to ask is Yes, a period in the punctuation will always cause all synthesizers (as far as I know) to stop or pause longer than a comma. 
But some screen readers can also be configured to stop or pause at other times: end of a heading? 
end of a list item? 
end of meta information? 
For example, a user can configure Home Page Reader to "add trailing text - such as a period" after headings, list items, meta text, etc. 
So now every list item will "full stop" at the end because the synthesizer will stop when it encounters a period. 
I would recommend against an author adding the period since it isn't recommend in most modern grammar books. 
Interestingly, if the author adds a period, and the user configures the synthesizer to stop at each list item, the second period encountered may be spoken as a "dot". 
list item with two periods.. 
In my opinion, authors should NOT be making accommodations that are clearly in the realm of responsibility of the synthesizer and screen readers.

Many thanks to Simon and Phill for their feedback on this question. 
It sounds like some user agents can be set to detect ends of lines even without periods, and others may not. 
I agree that fundamentally the software that reads information should be set to accommodate the user's needs, and that introducing new ways of writing just to try and make it work for all might be tricky and ill-advised. 
Just to clarify, I wasn't considering putting the period at the end of each bullet point, just the final one. 
Might this be a good compromise for those users whose equipment is not set to impose the full stop? 
That way, at the very least they will get a pause at the end of the stream of bullets, if not after each individual bullet. 
I know that proponents of strict grammar might say that all lists should be punctuated as if they were in their longer, multi-clause form, which would include the final period anyway. 
I tend to favour only the bare minimum, especially for low-literacy readers, and am happy to drop that final period if it will only make things more complicated for most users. 
Thanks again for the help, and for any further input. 
Michelle for now at least, I think what is deemed is proper grammar is the way to go. 
Why confuse things.
