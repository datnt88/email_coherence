Love. 
ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE 
Explain the reason for the two lines: URL, then the "translated to"? 
Seems to be related to file naming case changes For URLs on my site, the values were the same when I had gone to the pain of file renaming to all lower-case for my ISP's unix system. 
When I use the Microsoft "feature" of behind-my-back forcing mixed-case file names, (such as done by powerpoint and others) that messes up many things, particularly links in tools where case becomes sensitive.
