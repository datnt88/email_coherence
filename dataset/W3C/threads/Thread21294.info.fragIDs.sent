All, Below are some more (mainly editorial changes) to the latest version of the spec (the one with Henrik's changes in). 
I haven't made the changes in the spec, but could do so tomorrow (UK time) unless someone else volunteers first ? 
Regards, Marc.

Int: x23740 1. Introduction Text: "used in a large variety of systems ranging from messaging systems to Remote Procedure Calls (RPC)." 
Action: decapitalise "Remote Procedure Calls" 
Done ( although I don't see why... ) 
Text: "expressing *what* is in a message, *who* should deal with it, and *whether* it is optional or mandatory." 
Action: move bold style from "whether" to "optional" and "mandatory" 
Done. 
Text: "either with or without the HTTP Extension Framework" Action: insert "experimental" before HTTP Extension Framework 
Done. 
1.2 Text: "with the XMLP/SOAP " Action: only "XMLP" is struck-out, should be "XMLP/" 
Done ( moved / into strikeout, did not *remove* struck out text ) 
Text: "and "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" respectively both of which are defined " Action: insert comma after "respectively" 
Done. 
1.3 Text: ""alert" which both are are application defined " Action: second "are" is already struck out, swap "both" and "are" around to read ""alert" which are both application defined " 
Done. 
Text: "The example shows a sample SOAP/HTTP " Action: change to "Examples 1 and 2 show a sample SOAP/HTTP " 
Done. 
Text: "contains an block" Action: change to "contains a block" 
Done. 
Text: "the GetLastTradePrice is not " Action: replace with "the GetLastTradePrice element is not " 
Done 
1.4.2 Text: Mixed use of syntactical and syntactic Action: decide on syntactical or syntactic - I prefer the latter. 
Done ( changed two occurences of syntactical to syntactic ) 
2.3 Text: "either a SOAP header blocks or a SOAP body block" Action: remove "s" from "blocks" 
Done 
2.4 Text: "fully conform to and fully implement the specification according to the semantics conveyed by the fully qualified name " Action: doesn't read right, replace with "fully conform to and implement the semantics conveyed by the fully qualified name " 
Done ( also removed hfn-in/hfn-out span tags ) 
2.5 Text: "fault if one or more SOAP block targeted " Action: replace "block" with "blocks" 
Done 
Text: "force processing of other SOAP headers " Action: change to "force processing of other SOAP header blocks " for consistency 
Done. 
3 Text: "Schema document for these namespaces " Action: replace "document" with "documents" 
Done 
4.1.2 
Text: "A SOAP VesionMismatch " Action: typo should be "VersionMismatch" 
Done. 
4.4.2 Text: "Each block has an attribute with a local name of qname. 
It has an attribute whose name is "qname", and whose value is the QName of a header which the faulting node failed to understand." Action: Repetition, change to "Each block has an attribute with a local name of "qname", and whose value is the QName of a header which the faulting node failed to understand." 
Done ( also removed hfn-in/hfn-out span tags. 
Also added 'unqualified' before 'attribute' ) 
6 Text: (thoughout section 6 and it's subsections) "the HTTP Extension Framework" Action: change to "the experimental HTTP Extension Framework" 
Done. 
Appendix C Text: "QName of the env:Envelope element " Action: would this be better as "QName of the SOAP envelope element " ? the "env:" is a bit incongruous. 
Hmmmm. 
I just removed the 'env:'. 
We may need to wordsmith this further. 
see below Gudge 
4.4.2 Text: "Each block has an attribute with a local name of qname. 
It has an attribute whose name is "qname", and whose value is the QName of a header which the faulting node failed to understand." Action: Repetition, change to "Each block has an attribute with a local name of "qname", and whose value is the QName of a header which the faulting node failed to understand." 
I propose we change to "Each block has an attribute with a local name of "qname", and whose value is the QName of a header block which the faulting node failed to understand." Action: added "block" after header 
Done. 
Also, 1st paragraph of 4.4.2 should change to "When a SOAP node generates a MustUnderstand fault, it SHOULD provide, in the generated fault message, header blocks as described below which detail the qualified names (QNames, per the XML Schema Datatypes specification) 
of 
the particular header block(s) which were not understood." 
Action: change "entries" to "blocks" and changed "header(s)" to "header block(s)". 
Was already like this in the version I downloaded. 
Note that we did not change "detail entry" to "detail block", which is 
fine 
with me. 
I searched for "entries" and found some use of "entries" associated with the "detail" sub-element of "env:Fault" body block. 
Can we bold the word "detail" when used to refer to this sub-element? 
I see where you're going but we don't highlight any other element names right now... 
Not Done. 
Other places where we should change "entries" to "blocks": - Table of Content for section 2.3 (be consistent with section title within the document) -- Recommend section 2.3 title be changed to "Targeting SOAP Header 
Blocks" Done. 
( TOC now matches section title both use 'Blocks' instead of 'Entries' ) 
- section 2.2, "It is expected that SOAP header entries ..." 
Could not find above text in section 2.2 ( or anywhere else for that matter ) Not Done. 
Yes, I think I had spotted these already, and Henrik had fixed it; so we(re ok.
