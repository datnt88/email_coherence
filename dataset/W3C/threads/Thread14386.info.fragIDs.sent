<s> Interesting question.  </s>
<s> At the moment there is no way to make this happen on the client side - you  </s>
<s> always need some kind of server-side solution (such as the submenu, although  </s>
<s> there are fancier things you could do which would hit your server harder).  </s>
<s> You could make this more directly accesssible for those with script-capable browsers by adding an onfocus method, but I need to think for a minute how that works for turning things off (since the focus will shift to a bit of the submenu...).  </s>
<s> It might not be very easy to do this in HTML.  </s>
<s> An interesting question is that  </s>
<s> use of submenus that are not available on the main page unless you process  </s>
<s> scripts, and the effect this has on the accessibility of the site.  </s>
<s> The  </s>
<s> obvious issue is that you are required to use a different navigation path if  </s>
<s> you have a browser that canot handle scripts.  </s>
<s> But then, you can use both paths if you do handle scripts.  </s>
<s> thoughts anyone?  </s>

<s> I was working on this problem last year.  </s>
<s> The work-around that I created used style sheets and scripting.  </s>
<s> When scripts are on, the submenu would appear after a mouse click (rather than mouse over) or a keyboard event (pressing the enter key).  </s>
<s> This event caused the submenu, as defined as a style sheet "layer," to be displayed.  </s>
<s> When scripts are off style sheets are also not loaded and the submenus appear with the menu bar in an outline.  </s>
<s> refer to http://sun.trace.wisc.edu/mwc an outdated write up is available at: touched in over a year wendy blushes from embarrasment .  </s>

<s> anyone want to play with it?  </s>
<s> help me bring it up to date?  </s>

<s> I wanted to make one additional point with regard to cognitive disabilities and a suggestion.  </s>
<s> Apologies in advance to those who find this all far too obvious.  </s>
<s> It's not just that content and tools need to work together to support the individual but we must also consider: 1.  </s>
<s> The purpose or intent of the page author, and 2. the purpose or intent of the page/site visitor (reader, learner, etc.).  </s>
<s> Otherwise, it is impossible to measure the importance of various cognitive style and ability differences.  </s>
<s> Since this is all likely to become quite complex, I would suggest beginning with a simple approach.  </s>
<s> Using CAST's UDL framework, I am attempting to categorize some of the key cognitive topics.  </s>
<s> This needs more work but I think I should put something out there.  </s>
<s> As the discussion with iconic representations shows, this work will not be easy and great caution must be exercised lest these efforts are seen by others as extreme or goofy.  </s>
<s> My suggestion is to take a list of cognitive topics and attempt to agree on a few that are likely to create the most significant barriers for the greatest number of users.  </s>
<s> This may require a bit of guesswork but I suspect that stepping back from the details of one approach or issue may prove productive.  </s>
