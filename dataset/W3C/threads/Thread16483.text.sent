Hello, Vision Australia Foundation has decided that it needs to prepare a set of guidelines for internal use to help staff make Word documents more accessible. 
MS has material to assist disabled users to use its Office products, but I could not locate any guidleines for authors to ensure that the documents, spreadsheets, etc were accessible in the first place. 
While we could write them from scratch (and WCAG would form a good starting point - thanks Charles), we figure that there must be some material 'out there somewhere' that we could re-use. 
Can anyone point me anywhere useful? 
Or has anyone done this for their organisation?

I found this article helpful Also There is an assumption when using Word that everyone has it (which is ok in an intranet type environment) but if Word docs go outside the office it may be useful to give people a link to the Word Viewer.
