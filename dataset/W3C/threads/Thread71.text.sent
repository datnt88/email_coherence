Using the facility to parse report to an error file (-f), the report is not filled with any message. 
This applies for a single file or a batch of files using wild cards eg command line tidy -config localtest.txt 
-f f:\chap1\errschap1.txt 
f:\chap1\*.htm 
Tidy 8th July 2000 version win2000 o/s NTFS5 Any thoughts please? 
Cheers Mike B I also ran into similar behaviour. 
I have only briefly played with the Windows version of Tidy08Jul00 (under W95), but it seems to ignore the -f option, unlike previous versions. 
To me this smells like a bug. 
I haven't looked at the source code yet. 
Regards, Terry the report wild cards tidy -config localtest.txt 
-f f:\chap1\errschap1.txt 
f:\chap1\*.htm

Apply the following patch: *** tidy.cTue 
Aug 01 17:30:17 2000 --- tidy.c.oldTue Aug 01 17:34:53 2000 *** 895,901 **** /* and try to open the new error file */ fp = fopen(errfile, "w"); ! 
if (fp != null) errout = fp; current_errorfile = errfile; --- 895,901 ---- /* and try to open the new error file */ fp = fopen(errfile, "w"); ! 
if (input != null) errout = fp; current_errorfile = errfile;
