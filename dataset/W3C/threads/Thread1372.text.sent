I am completely neutral on whether we use the term "configuration" or the term "component" to mean "a collection and all members of that collection". 
I would still use the term "baseline" to mean "component version", since the term baseline is commonly used, and it ties our concepts to common usage. 
Acceptable. 
Perhaps we shouldn't be too puristic. 
Is anyone else either for or against switching from "configuration" to "component"? 
Cheers, Geoff Yesterday a posting told me that 15 is already availabe. 
(For some time already it seems if I look at the DELTA-V page). 
The introductory part on baselines is much clearer now. 
Nevertheless I still would like to drop 'configuration' which only appears in this context and replace it by 'component'. 
As Geoff seems to be neutral on this topic, I really would like to see at least one or two other opinions.

Sent: Sunday, April 22, 2001 5:42 PM Subject: Component instead of Configuration/Baseline/Component Hi, I know that it's late and probably Geoff is busy rewriting 14.1 to produce 15, but nevertheless here I have a proposal which would make some concepts easier to understand IMHO. 
In 11 (Baseline feature) a couple of new terms appear: Configuration, meaning a tree of resources rooted at a root (:-) collection, a technical term. 
Baseline, a technical term which probably is just there because the feature is called like that, because basically it's just another word for 'configuration version' Components, a logical term which is used to rationalize subbaselines. 
So I would like to introduce just one new term: Component. 
And define it like the old Configuration (So Configuration disappears) Instead BASELINE-CONTROL use COMPONENT-CONTROL. 
The necessity for Baseline disappears. 
It's just a 'component version'. 
Subbaseline-set becomes subcomponent-set and so on. 
A 'Component feature' would show better I think what we want to gain than 'Baseline feature'. 
So the beginning could e.g. be: 11 COMPONENT FEATURE A "component" is a set of resources that consists of a root collection and all menbers of that root collection which aren't a component themselves. 
... This would just be a (Not so small I admit) editorial change. 
No different functionality. 
I hope I didn't miss something you can't do if you drop Configuration and Baseline.

Yesterday a posting told me that 15 is already availabe. 
(For some time already it seems if I look at the DELTA-V page). 
Actually, I got the "dates" a bit wrong when I updated the deltav page (those dates are entered by hand to the html page)... but after I noticed it, I figured it was close enough (at least the month was right). 
The introductory part on baselines is much clearer now. 
Good!

Yes, I am neutral. 
I believe Jim Amsden was the only one who responded so far (and he wanted to keep it "configuration", because "component" is so overused as a term). 
Just to expand a bit on my "neutrality", on one hand, the term "configuration" emphasizes the fact that it is "a set of things", but on the other hand, the term "component" emphasizes the fact that this is something you can plug in and plug out, which is exactly what you do when you create and select different baselines for a baselined collection. 
So on a purely technical basis, I probably prefer the term "component", but on an inertial basis (i.e. we've been calling it a configuration for a while now, and people seem OK with it), I prefer the term "configuration". 
So, either way is fine with me (:-). 
Cheers, Geoff FWIW I'm similarly indifferent to the term used.
