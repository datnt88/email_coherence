I checked with Lars Borg, one of Adobe's color scientists, about the best way to evaluate the contrast between two RGB colors. 
Here is his advice: Convert each color to Lab, then calculate the length of the difference vector in Lab (also known as deltaE). 
The distance is a fairly consistent measure of color difference. 
Contrasting colors may need a deltaE of 40 or more. 
(This needs to be verified.) Interesting. 
But how does that control for color blindness? 
The problem is contrast, not color difference. 
Are they the same?

On Behalf best way As I recall there were three types of color sensors, the red yellow and Blue. 
Any or all off these can be low impaired or missing entirely. 
For people who are completely color blind (no color vision at all) it is only the gray scale that counts, so a red on black is completely invisible I actually wrote to them a year ago or so, and got some conformation on this) If someone has no blue vision, then having a high contrast just biased on the blue scale is not sufficient. 
Of course the same is true for the other cones. 
So you need sufficient contrast in each of the fundamental colors, to guarantee contrast for all color disabilities (not just the common ones). 
All the best Lisa Seeman Behalf Of Gregg Vanderheiden Interesting.
