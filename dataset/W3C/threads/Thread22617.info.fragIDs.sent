<s> Good morning, As many readers of the W3C public forums do, we strongly believe that the DOM is one of the major improvements of the document's world and we would like to propose possible extensions of the actual W3C standards (and activities) that would, in our opinion, make things move forward in an even more powerful direction.  </s>
<s> First of all, we would like to see a bootstrapable DOM.  </s>
<s> In other words, we would like to be able to describe the DOM itself in a XML document conformant to a DTD.  </s>
<s> DOM level 1 Core could be described by one XML doc, DOM level 1 core+html by another one, and so on.  </s>
<s> It not yet clear to us if all the DOM can be bootstrapable or if a core is has to be determined.  </s>
<s> About the DTD itself and how it can be built, our second suggestion just below makes a proposal.  </s>
<s> Secondly, and because that description of the DOM will obviously need XSLT, we would like to see a meta-circularity of the couple DOM+XSLT.  </s>
<s> The DOM could be described in a XML document with XSLT inside and XSLT could be (obviously...) described using the DOM.  </s>
<s> That way, the coherence of these so important W3C recs can be achieved.  </s>
<s> Some other people could say that DOM and XSLT are then provable... Last point, we believe that CSS then needs a XML representation.  </s>
<s> Please do not read that we propose to XMLize CSS and drop the actual CSS formalism.  </s>
<s> We just propose to be build an isomorphism between the actual CSS and a fully XMLized representation of the same data.  </s>
<s> Then the CSSOM can also be bootstrapable, meta-circular and provable...  </s>
<s> We believe that such mechanisms could dramatically increase the eXtensibility of the DOM, XSLT and CSS, and the implementability of the new versions of these W3C standards.  </s>
<s> From our user's point of view, something highly desireable if software solutions take advantage of that and appear faster on our desks ;-) Claude Bahloul and Daniel Glazman Electricit? de France  </s>

<s> May I point out that, as a matter of fact, the DOM is already defined in XML?  </s>
<s> As described in the Production Notes [1], the spec (HTML), the IDL definition, the Java and ECMAScript bindings are generated from a single XML source document.  </s>
<s> For historical reasons, this is not achieved with XSL, but I would expect this to be possible.  </s>
<s> The DOM WG has actually discussed several times the idea of switching to XSLT, the only reason we haven't done so is a lack of resources.  </s>
<s> A lot of time has been spent on developing the tools we currently use and, while admittedly it would be very neat to do, we just can't afford doing so.  </s>

<s> Yes, and this is an excellent starting point.  </s>
<s> But things stop on the  </s>

<s> We would like to see a XSLT solution for each  </s>

<s> Arnaud, who's that "we" ?  </s>
<s> IMHO the cost of such an extension is worth doing it, if compared to the possible benefits.  </s>
<s> BTW, how are things going ?-) Correctly installed ?  </s>
<s> Sorry, I don't understand what you mean.  </s>
<s> We generate the actual IDL [1] and Java [2] files as well as the textual description (in HTML).  </s>
<s> We only have a textual description of the ECMAScript binding because the language doesn't have any such thing as an interface we could use.  </s>
