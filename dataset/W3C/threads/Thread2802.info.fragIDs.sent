<s> The spec says that all 200 level warnings must be retained after a successful revalidation.  </s>
<s> However, it also says that all end-to-end headers (Warnings are end-to-end) must be replaced after by the corresponding end-to-end header in a revalidation.  </s>
<s> So if we had a cached copy of an entity that has a 200 level warning associated with it and when we revalidate, we get a Warning header w/o the 200 level warning, are we supposed to keep it or not?  </s>
