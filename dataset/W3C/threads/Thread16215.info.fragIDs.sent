It may not be an example of excellence as far as universality, but for accessibility it covers many of the holes in the WAI site. 
The homepage offers a choice of nine languages. 
It has a a limited number of links, each with a great graphic. 
It loads quickly. 
It does not use alt tags The topics and text labels are less well chosen than they could be. 
The coding is lengthy...... 
A student &amp; fan found it easy and exciting to navigate.

I am very glad to see that the separation of universality and accessibility seems to be continuing appace. 
I should perhaps apologise for only testing the non-flash version. 
Most of the student's computers at colleges I teach, in have not had sound cards, or any plug-ins. 
I should perhaps add that it seems to work fine in linux navigator and KDE, though it probably is not very useful within lynx unfortunately.

"I am very glad to see that the separation of universality and accessibility seems to be continuing appace." - Jonathan Chetwynd This is an interesting comment. 
Where is the line between making web sites accessible and universal? 
I suppose there is no harsh line, but how can I learn to make my sites accessible without going to extremes? 
I'm looking for a source to help me better understand this separation.

If this is based on my comments, then I am probably being misinterpreted. 
Jonathan had pointed to a site that, as I understood it, was good at providing accessibility to a specific group of people (at the expense of certain others). 
I was not suggesting that this is a good way forward, just that we need to understand who (if anyone) is not well served by the current work we are doing, and how to ensure that they will be in the future. 
Looking at what is good about a site that helps people more than the current WAI work, and learning how to do that, is not the same as accepting what is clearly not accessible in some way about it. 
I do not believe that accessibility requires that we divide the world into different groups, and target our "accessibilty" to one or the other - I think that if we cannot do better than that then we will have failed.

rest assured chas it had nothing to do with your online comments.

I agree with this except for one caveat -- the accessibility of the -content- is primary, and not necessarily of each page; thus there may be cases in which dividing the world into different groups -on the same site- may work best, if you have users with special needs that can't be adequately met by the single-source method and graceful degradation. 
When dealing with users with different needs and those with multiple needs, there are some cases in which it might indeed be good to say "this is a type of presentation that -best benefits users who are blind-" or "this is how you can make a site more accessible -for users who have learning disabilities-". 
Many of these techniques may prove to be very powerful and useful, and with evolving technologies that enable server-side transformations of the user experience, we can't just discard a solution that works for one audience because it doesn't fit in our model of "single source universal design." 
Jonathan's various demonstrations are good examples of this. 
Most all of what he's presented as possible (partial?) solutions for users with cognitive impairments are highly inaccessible to users who are visually impaired. 
However, if we consider the option of delivering custom, personalized user interfaces, then we find a way to use some of the suggestions made here that aren't compatible with single source design. 
Jonathan's idea works for learning disabled users but not for people without vision? 
Great! 
We'll add it to our toolbox called "optimizing sites for people with learning disabilities" and not our toolbox called "optimizing sites for people who are blind." 
--Kynn PS: The catch, of course, is to do this selection/optimization in an accurate, inclusive, and "correct" way. 
And that's not easy to do reliably -- it takes a lot of work and a lot of understanding of the issues, not to mention employing various protocols and technologies that have rarely been tied together in this way. 
By the way -- this is what we're working on at Edapta.

I think Kynn has clearly identifed what could be a good path for solving these problems, and equally clearly identifed the largest obstacle to success using that path.
