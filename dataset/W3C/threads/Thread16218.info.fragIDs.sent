<s> Hi,  </s>
<s> How are you trying to read it?  </s>
<s> If inside the PDF reader with the access plugin, make sure you've selected the Access View with ctrl-4 or from the View menu.  </s>
<s> I sent the URL you provided to pdf2txt@adobe.com and received back a text translation.  </s>
<s> I didn't read through the entire file but what I did read had text I could understand.  </s>
