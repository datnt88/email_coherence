<s> I would like to propose that we discard the Tidy DOM classes altogether.  </s>
<s> The DOM is about to have a Level 2 Recommendation with Level 3 coming not too far after that.  </s>
<s> The functionality is rapidly increasing and I don't think that there's any way that we can or should keep up.  </s>
<s> DOM now offers the whole traversal specification with NodeFilters, NodeIterators, etc. What I propose is that we add a SAX 2 output capability to JTidy and discard the DOM classes altogether.  </s>
<s> The SAX 2 interface would fit in nicely with the current XML/XHTML output options and we would be done with it.  </s>
<s> If someone wanted a DOM implementation, they could use a parser like Xerces and drive it with SAX 2 events.  </s>
<s> Then, they could have a full-blown DOM implementation supported by a team that is focused on that.  </s>
<s> Ouch! I depend very heavily on the JTidy DOM classes.  </s>
<s> If they disappeared, I would have absolutely no use for the library.  </s>
<s> What is the C version doing?  </s>
<s> I had rather assumed JTidy to be a Java port of it rather than a parallel implementation.  </s>
<s> I don't think that the c version of tidy implements the DOM at all!  </s>
<s> I suppose we could keep the existing DOM classes and continue to support them as is and enhance them as time allows.  </s>
<s> But for people who need full DOM support, it would be much easier for us to build in SAX 2 events.  </s>
<s> Russell, for your application, you'd just need to add in a few lines of code to a handler that can accept SAX 2 events (like Xerces) and that can build a DOM tree from that.  </s>
<s> Then, you'd use the Xerces DOM tree and have a full blown DOM implementation with all of the features that Xerces supports.  </s>
<s> It could be somewhat slower and consume more memory because we'd first be building the tidy tree and then walking it to generate the SAX events.  </s>
<s> But HTML pages are usually small and I think the increased benefits would outweigh these disadvantages.  </s>

<s> Greetings,  </s>
<s> Gary, do you think that SAX is less of a moving target than DOM?  </s>
<s> If yes, I think your proposal sounds very good.  </s>
<s> It has the following advantages: - The DOM implementation would be left to the folks who know it best (e.g. Xerces) - Maintenance of the JTidy DOM support would be easier.  </s>
<s> The disadvantages are: 1 Work required to design the SAX2 event generator 2 Speed 3 Existing application base.  </s>
<s> The solution to 3) would be to either support the existing DOM classes in parallel or providing a smooth migration path to the DOM functionality.  </s>
<s> Can you give a work estimate?  </s>
<s> How about the speed/memory penalty?  </s>

<s> Sami -- Another disadvantage (probably goes with 2) is memory, depending on what is used as the ContentHandler.  </s>
<s> I'm notoriously bad at work estimates.  </s>
<s> In this case it would be even worse because I basically haven't looked at the JTidy code at all.  </s>
<s> I'll need to study the structure and then fit the code in in the proper place so that we can maintain sync with c tidy.  </s>
<s> I'll look at this in the next few days and have a better idea then and report back.  </s>
<s> On the speed/memory penalty, I have no clue.  </s>
<s> I really want to spend my free time in the next few days studying the JTidy structure so that I can get a good feel for the architecture.  </s>
<s> Measure twice, cut once.  </s>
