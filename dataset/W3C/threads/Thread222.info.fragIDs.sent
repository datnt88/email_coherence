<s> It is exactly those situations that you point out that are breaking the code, as much of the dynamic page generation does not allow the luxury of using the SCRIPT /SCRIPT tags as the small elements of dynamic changes are "embedded" in the HTML, that is, not multi-line.  </s>

<s> It worked fine, so perhaps it's just a matter of using a recent version of Tidy?  </s>
<s> On the other hand, perhaps Tidy still fails for more complex examples of PHP3.  </s>
<s> One thing to note is that Tidy works by building a clean parse tree and then pretty printing it out.  </s>
<s> This means that if you PHP3 code generates HTML markup for the start tag for some element, you should also include PHP3 code for the end tag, as otherwise Tidy will be surprised by an unexpected end tag and will delete it, most likely causing your page to fail.  </s>
<s> Tidy is only software after all and not a mind reader.  </s>
