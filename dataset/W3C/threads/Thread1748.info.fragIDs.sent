<s> Hi, does the checkout behavior of a version-controlled collection be the same as the checkout behavior of a version-controlled resource with DAV:apply-to-version flag?  </s>
<s> (Because of working-collection sounds similar to working-resource) Is there the same behavior for parallel development (parallel checkouts, checkin behavior) as for working-resources?  </s>
