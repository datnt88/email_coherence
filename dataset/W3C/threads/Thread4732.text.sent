Suppose that at some point in the execution of a stylesheet this element is added to the result tree: Later on in the execution of the stylesheet something is encountered that causes it to want to update that Member element in the result tree so that count is incremented by 1, i.e., the result tree should be updated so that the Member element now looks like this: This may occur many times. 
Each time the Member element in the result tree is updated. 
Recap: As my stylesheet executes I want it to add things into a result tree, and then as it executes further I want it to update things that were previously placed in the result tree. 
By the time the processor has completed executing the stylesheet the result tree has undergone all desired additions and updates, and is then serialized. 
Would someone please explain how to do this? 
/Roger did you mean to ask this on xsl-list? 
it doesn't appear to be a comment on the working drafts (the subject of this list). 
xslt doesn't update existing trees, only generates new ones so you can't do what you ask, but there should be no need. 
As XSLT has full access to the whole input document before processing starts there is not really any "later on" you should be able to generate the correct attribute without needing to update it. 
Of course you can use variables and/or parameters to store intermediate results without writing to the result tree (easier in xslt2) David (Not a member of the WG so I wouldn't normally reply except I'd written half the above before noticing it wasnt on xsl-list) XSLT is a declarative, functional language: the concept of updating variables, or nodes in a tree, is therefore alien. 
The form of your question "as my stylesheet executes..." shows that you are thinking in a procedural model. 
Please try to rethink your problem description so that the result tree can be described as a function of the source tree.
