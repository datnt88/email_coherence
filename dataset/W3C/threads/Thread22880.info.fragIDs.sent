<s> If I understand you the substantial problem seems to be that there is no way to obtain an instance of these interface types as the CSSOM stands, with out a succession of 'guessing' casts (as opposed to casts with a type code involved).  </s>

<s> Each get method could be specified to throw an UnsupportedOperationException() if the type is not realised in a particular implementation.  </s>
<s> The compelling use case here is simple: there is no use case at all without access through the published API.  </s>
