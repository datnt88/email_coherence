Windows normally uses the tab key to move around different parts of a dialog - for example in the "open" dialog, I expect tab to cycle me through the URI text entry, and the four buttons. 
Using version 5.1 the tab key isn't working to do this - I presume it is to do with the way that tabbing between links was enabled, but I am not sure. 
I didn't try re-assigning the function to some other key yet.

using the win32 binary version of Amaya the tab key does move around the open dialog but not in the top down, left to right manner. 
its first stop is at the clear button !!! but i suspect that it is a key equates problem in linux as functionality is still there.

We tried to update the tab order with Visual C++ but that break down all dialogues. 
We're looking for another method.
