<s> Introduction: This discussion proposes that we use XML for structured data and lists a number of issues related to such use.  </s>
<s> These have come up recently in many contexts and under many names such as "web collections," "metadata," "schemas," "ontologies," "profiles," "lexicons" etc. XML can handle these needs, but it needs some extensions to do so.  </s>
<s> We have discussed this subject extensively with two groups in the W3C: the Digital Signatures Initative Group (designers of PICS, and more generally, electronic signatures on assertions about documents) and W3C-Labels (representation of structured data about web resources, for instance electronic libraries and their indices).  </s>
<s> Correspondents include Ralph Swick, Ora Lassila, Philip DesAutels and Eric Miller.  </s>
<s> We are also particularly indebted to two individuals: Tim Bray and Henry Thompson.  </s>
<s> This discussion lists several known issues for XML, and often makes concrete proposals both to illustrate the issue and so that we have something to start with and to criticize.  </s>
<s> These proposals are not meant to read as final thoughts but as beginning ones.  </s>
<s> A word on terminology: We here use "schema" to denote the information that must be known before a document can be read (e.g. DTD).  </s>
<s> I specifically avoid all use of the term "meta-data" since it currently has at least three widely-different meanings depending on speaker.  </s>
<s> XML is a format for tagging text so that the structure of its semantic parts is identified in an easily-parsed way.  </s>
<s> The document's structure, that is, the relationship of elements in the document can be mechanically discovered without reference to any outside information beyond the XML specification.  </s>
<s> (See following is a valid XML document: <NAME> Number, the Language of Science </NAME> <NAME> Tales of Grandpa Cat </NAME> The base level of XML is only enough to express containment and text.  </s>
<s> A number of issues immediately arise: How to represent more complex structures; how attributes of elements should be represented; how to identify a namespace (schema) used in a document; how to present a schema in a machine readable form; how to create a open, extensible mechanism for adding and extending schemas; and how to integrate multiple schemas in one document.  </s>

<s> /P LI A HREF="#appendix-xml" Appendix A: Correspondence to the XML Web Collection Proposal /A /LI P The first question to ask is: what is metadata?  </s>
<s> Metadata is data about data, or specifically in our present context, data about web resources.  </s>
<s> /P P I The broad goal is to define a metadata mechanism which makes no assumptions about a particular application domain, nor defines the semantics of any application domain.  </s>
<s> The definition of the mechanism should be domain neutral, yet the mechanism should be suitable for describing information about any domain.  </s>
<s> /I /P P Metadata can be used in a variety of application areas; for example:&amp;nbsp;in I resource discovery /I to provide better search engine capabilities, in I cataloging /I for describing the content available at a particular web site or page, by I intelligent software agents /I to facilitate knowledge sharing and exchange, in I digital signatures /I , in I content rating /I , and in many others (for example, metadata can be used for specialized tasks such as organizing a group of web pages for purposes of printing them as a single unit, or for producing a visualization of the link relationships between them).  </s>
<s> /P P This document introduces an model for representing metadata, and a syntax for expressing and transporting metadata based on this model.  </s>
<s> In a way, this is a new version of the PICS content rating label mechanism and motivates its use as a general metadata description formalism.  </s>
<s> The new PICS - which we shall here call PICS-NG (for Next Generation) - is based on a conceptual object model for metadata, suitable for expressing information about web resources as well as other PICS-NG formulations.  </s>
<s> The model is highly extensible, and also more general than the implied model behind A HREF="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/TR/REC-PICS-labels.html"  </s>
<s> PICS version 1.1 /A [Krauskopf 96]; hence this document will first describe the model in general and then proceed to give a specialization for implementing content rating labels.  </s>
<s> /P P A mechanism is needed to permit encoding and transport of web metadata in a manner that maximizes the interoperability of independently developed web servers and clients.  </s>
<s> Specific applications are free - and indeed encouraged - to impose additional semantics on a subset of the metadata above that required by the model described in this document.  </s>
<s> /P P The I metadata object model /I defines a conceptual framework for objects called I labels /I .  </s>
<s> Labels are collections of I attributes /I and their corresponding I values /I .  </s>
<s> The domain of values consists of instances of a small set of I primitive types /I , other labels, as well as I lists /I .  </s>
<s> The primitive types are: I strings /I , I numbers /I (both integers and floats) and I booleans /I .  </s>
<s> By definition, an attribute/value pair contained in a label makes a I statement /I .  </s>
<s> Using labels it is possible to make statements about I resources /I (which have a URL) as well as about other labels.  </s>
<s> /P P The set of attributes for a given label, as well as any characteristics or restrictions of the values themselves, are defined by a I schema /I , referred to by the label using a URL.  </s>
<s> This URL&amp;nbsp;may be treated merely as an identifier or it may refer to a machine-readable description of the schema.  </s>
<s> A label may have more than one schema, and similarly a schema may be defined in terms of any number of other schemata.  </s>
<s> By definition, an application that understands a particular schema used by a label understands the semantics of each of the attribute statements contained in that label.  </s>
<s> An application that has no knowledge of the particular schema will minimally be able to parse the label into the attribute and value components and will be able to transport the label intact (e.g. to a cache or to another application).  </s>
<s> In the presence of multiple schemata, an application may choose (in a left-to-right order) the first schema it has knowledge of, and interpret the label using that schema [ B Note: /B see the Open Issues section for a discussion on multiple inheritance].  </s>
<s> /P P An actual machine-readable description of a schema may be accessed through content negotiation by dereferencing the schema URL contained in the label.  </s>
<s> If the schema is machine-readable it may be possible for an application to learn the semantics of the schema on demand.  </s>
<s> How the learning happens is beyond the scope of this document; furthermore, no claim is made that it is always feasible to encode the full semantics in a machine-readable schema.  </s>
<s> The URL&amp;nbsp;referring to a schema may actually refer to a file containing definitions for several schemata (i.e. a library of schemata).  </s>
<s> In this case, embedded labels may refer to any of the contained schemata definitions using URL&amp;nbsp;fragment identifiers.  </s>
<s> /P P A I type /I is an identifier designated by a schema to name a component of a I type system /I .  </s>
<s> The basic type system of PICS-NG contains the following types (many of these types are not unlike those found in various Lisp systems): /P TD A sequence of characters [ B Note: /B a discussion of character sets will be included in a future version of this document].  </s>
<s> Syntactically strings are case-sensitive and may contain whitespace.  </s>
<s> /TD TD A sequence of characters acting as a unique identifier.  </s>
<s> Syntactically symbols are case-insensitive.  </s>
<s> The particular syntax used for metadata restricts the set of characters allowed in a symbol.  </s>
<s> Furthermore, symbols may not contain whitespace.  </s>
<s> /TD TD A tuple of two numbers, representing lower and upper bounds of an interval.  </s>
<s> /TD TD A boolean value.  </s>
<s> The names of the two possible values are and TT false /TT .  </s>
<s> /TD TD A Uniform Resource Locator.  </s>
<s> Syntactically this is a string, but only those characters are allowed which are legal as specified in the A HREF="http://ds.internic.net/rfc/rfc1738.txt"  </s>
<s> URL&amp;nbsp;specification /A [Berners-Lee 94].  </s>
<s> /TD TD Objects of this type represent points in time.  </s>
<s> Syntactically the type looks like a string (with additional restrictions on their contents as defined in the syntax section below), internally it may be represented in any way the implementation sees fit.  </s>
<s> Syntactically this type is currently defined as I quoted-ISO-date /I in the A HREF="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/TR/REC-PICS-labels.html"  </s>
<s> PICS version 1.1 /A specification.  </s>
<s> /TD P In addition, the type called I any /I is understood to denote the set of all of the above types.  </s>
<s> /P P In certain applications it may be desirable for some attributes to hold multiple values simultaneously.  </s>
<s> In this case the order of the values is significant, that is, an application is required to preserve the ordering (please note that the order of I attributes /I is not significant).  </s>
<s> To assign multiple values to an attribute the list type is used (in other words, an attribute with multiple values is an attribute with a single list value).  </s>
<s> /P P A label is a collection of statements (attribute/value pairs).  </s>
<s> These statements are being made about an object called the I referent /I .  </s>
<s> We can identify three different types of referents: /P LI B Referent Value: /B the statements apply to the object named by the referent; if the referent is a label describing a set, the statements are about the set as a whole.  </s>
<s> /LI LI B Indirect Referent Value: /B the statements apply to the referent of the referent; if the referent is a label describing a set, the statements are about each of the items in that set.  </s>
<s> /LI LI B Immediate Value: /B the statements apply to the referent object; if the referent is a label, the statements are about the label object itself.  </s>
<s> /LI P If the referent is a list it is understood that the statements are being made of each of the items of the list.  </s>
<s> The following table clarifies the differences between the three cases based on the type of the referent object: /P TD ROWSPAN="2" The referent label makes statements about the object (e.g. unit of a numerical value) /TD TD The symbol or number is the name of another label which is considered the actual referent (see below) /TD TD The symbol or number is the name of another label which is considered the actual referent (see below) /TD TD String is a URL, and the statements apply to the resource at that URL /TD TD String is a URL referring to a label describing a set; statements apply to the items of the set /TD TD Statements are made about the string (e.g. type of string, language) /TD TD If the label defines a set, the statements apply to the set as a whole /TD TD If the label defines a set, the statements apply to the elements of the set individually /TD P If I x /I is the referent of I y /I , then we will say that is the I parent /I of I x /I .  </s>
<s> In general, the immediately enclosing label of any label is called the I parent /I (regardless of what attribute holds the label as its value).  </s>
<s> /P P When label naming is used (in the above table, when the referent is a symbol or a number), the scope of name visibility is within the peers of a named label as well as within the locally (lexically) enclosing labels.  </s>
<s> References through URLs do not transmit name visibility.  </s>
<s> In addition, a label is not allowed to make I forward references /I (only labels introduced lexically before the referring label can be referred to), nor is a label allowed to refer to itself.  </s>
<s> /P P In order to avoid needless proliferation of metadata a mechanism is introduced which allows the sharing of common fragments of metadata among several labels.  </s>
<s> This feature is inspired by various I inheritance mechanisms /I found in object-oriented programming systems as well as various knowledge representation systems.  </s>
<s> /P from a schema to a label, and values may be inherited from one label to another.  </s>
<s> Using inheritance statements can be made of groups of objects without having to repeat the statement individually for each object.  </s>
<s> The following algorithm defines the exact mechanism of inheritance: given a label I lab /I and an attribute I att /I , the value of I att /I for I lab /I , as given by the function B AttributeValue( /B I lab /I , LI The local value of I att /I for I lab /I , if I att /I is a local attribute of I lab /I .  </s>
<s> /LI LI B AttributeValue( /B schema of I lab /I , I att /I B ) /B I , LI B AttributeValue( /B parent of I lab /I , I att /I B ) /B , if LI Unspecified, since a label always has either a schema definition or is enclosed by another label.  </s>
<s> /LI P As stated in the model definition section, in the presence of multiple schemata an application may choose the first schema it has knowledge of, and interpret the label using that schema.  </s>
<s> /P P A label refers to schema(ta) for the purpose of grounding the terms used by the label, to provide semantics for the statements the label makes.  </s>
<s> It is our intention that the PICS-NG metadata formalism be extremely simple, yet powerful via extensibility.  </s>
<s> It is expected that metadata implementors will define new schemata to introduce additional semantics for metadata expressions.  </s>
<s> We assume a formalism will exist for defining schemata, but this formalism is not described in this document (possibly the same formalism is used for schemata as is used for metadata instances).  </s>
<s> For maximal extensibility, the schema definition mechanism may take on features of I metaobject protocols /I .  </s>
<s> /P P For the purposes of bootstrapping the model, it will be necessary to define a small set of attributes which are available in all labels (and which conceivably could be used by any label).  </s>
<s> These attributes cannot be redefined or overridden by new schemata (to indicate the fixed nature of the definition of these attributes their names start with the * character; the use of the character *&amp;nbsp;is reserved for this purpose and no schema should use it as the first letter of an attribute name).  </s>
<s> The common core attributes of labels are: /P TD Contains a reference to the schema of the label.  </s>
<s> A list value is understood to be a list of URLs.  </s>
<s> /TD *for-indirect BR *for-immediate /TD TD Contains the I referent /I of the label, i.e. the object about which the statements in the label are being made.  </s>
<s> See the explanation at the end of section 2 describing the three different kinds of referents: a value (for), an I immediate /I value (for-immediate) and an I indirect referent /I value (for-indirect).  </s>
<s> Note: Specialized schemata may define other attributes the values of which can also be considered referents.  </s>
<s> /TD TD Names the label.  </s>
<s> Named labels can be referred to by just using their name (see explanation on referents at the end of section 2).  </s>
<s> The scope of the names is the lexical context of the label (everything within the outermost lexically enclosing label).  </s>
<s> /TD TD This attribute holds a digital signature which signs the label.  </s>
<s> The digital signature is a label itself and thus conforms to this specification.  </s>
<s> The actual schemata and sematics of digital signatures will be specified later.  </s>
<s> /TD P In order to implement an extension of A HREF="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/TR/REC-PICS-labels.html"  </s>
<s> PICS version 1.1 /A using PICS-NG, a schema has to be defined to introduce the old options as label attributes.  </s>
<s> We will call this schema the PICS&amp;nbsp;2.0 Schema.  </s>
<s> A&amp;nbsp;PICS 2.0 rating label is expressed as a single label.  </s>
<s> A label-list is a label whose referent is a list of labels.  </s>
<s> The attributes of the PICS 2.0 schema are: /P TD The last modification date of the item to which this rating applies, at the time the rating was assigned.  </s>
<s> /TD TD An identifier for the person or entity within the rating service who was responsible for creating this particular rating label.  </s>
<s> /TD TD If this option is set to true, the rating label can be applied to any URL starting with the prefix given in the for option.  </s>
<s> This is used to supply ratings for entire sites or any subparts of sites.  </s>
<s> /TD P The PICS-NG metadata object model provides an abstract, conceptual framework for defining and using metadata.  </s>
<s> A concrete syntax is also needed for the purposes of authoring and exchanging metadata.  </s>
<s> Several syntaxes are obviously possible, and we may not have to limit ourselves to a single syntax.  </s>
<s> There are, however, certain goals to keep in mind when designing the syntax: /P LI B Brevity: /B over-the-wire characteristics are important despite advances in telecommunications technology.  </s>
<s> /LI LI B Ease of parsing: /B to make metadata efficient to use, parsers have to be simple and fast; to promote widespread interoperability, parsers have to be easy to write.  </s>
<s> /LI LI B Suitability to direct human authoring and comprehension: /B this is probably less important than the previous goals, yet we should avoid unnecessary verbosity or anything else that needlessly complicates authoring (the ability to reliably author metadata with the Windows Notepad editor is B not /B a goal).  </s>
<s> /LI P This document defines an s-expression syntax for PICS-NG.  </s>
<s> This syntax satisfies the above requirements.  </s>
<s> /P P The syntax of PICS-NG is greatly simplified from that of PICS version 1.1.  </s>
<s> Basically PICS-NG syntax in a straightforward manner consists of s-expressions where additional restrictions are placed on the types of values of certain elements of s-expression structures.  </s>
<s> PICS-NG parsing is a multi-step process.  </s>
<s> Parsing of a single label happens as follows: /P LI A simple s-expression parser is used to parse (and verify) the overall syntactic structure (given below in the form of a BNF definition).  </s>
<s> This is the only step necessary if one is not interested in any semantic interpretation of the label (if the data is only passed through, if the parsing agent has no knowledge of the schemata used, etc.).  </s>
<s> /LI LI Information from each of the schemata of a label is used to verify that attribute values have legal values.  </s>
<s> /LI LI Any other information from the schemata is used for semantic interpretation of the label.  </s>
<s> /LI P This syntax has been chosen because it is simple to parse, provides a straightforward correspondence between the model and the syntactic form of the data, is brief (good over the wire -characteristics), and (by not being too verbose) is easy for humans to read and write.  </s>
<s> A BNF definition of the overall syntactic structure is given below (despite that fact that BNF&amp;nbsp;rather poorly lends itself to describing s-expressions): /P TD Possibly the version symbol in this version is TD I String /I | I Symbol /I | I Number /I | I Range /I | TD B Note: /B is this really a general thing or a content rating thing?  </s>
<s> /TD P Here are definitions for the literal entities of the syntax:&amp;nbsp; /P TD any sequence of characters not containing whitespace nor any of the following characters: TT ( )  /TT /TD TD defined as B I quotedname /I /B in the A HREF="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/TR/REC-PICS-labels.html"  </s>
<s> PICS 1.1 specification /A .  </s>
<s> Basically anything limited by doublequotes.  </s>
<s> /TD TD defined as [ ' TT + /TT ' | ' TT - /TT ' ] I DigitCharacter /I * [ ' TT .  </s>
<s> /TT ' I DigitCharacter /I + ] where I DigitCharacter /I is any of the characters ' TT 0 /TT '...' TT 9 /TT '. /TD TD similar to I String /I , but with contents identifying a Uniform Resource Locator, as defined in the A HREF="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/TR/REC-PICS-services-961031.html"  </s>

<s> RFC 1738 /A [Berners-Lee 94].  </s>
<s> /TD TD a I String /I , representing a date but restricted from the ISO&amp;nbsp;standard, as described by the A HREF="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/TR/REC-PICS-labels.html"  </s>
<s> PICS 1.1 specification /A .  </s>
<s> /TD P Another possible approach to metadata syntax is to use XML (the Extensible Markup Language).  </s>
<s> This language is attractive because of its political appeal and the fact that it may find other uses in the Internet arena.  </s>
<s> The full definition of an XML&amp;nbsp;syntax for PICS-NG will be included in a future version of this document.  </s>
<s> See A HREF="#appendix-xml" Appendix A /A for a discussion of PICS-NG compared with Microsoft's XML Collections proposal.  </s>
<s> /P P Section 6.2 illustrates a proposed XML syntax [contributed by Andrew Layman, A HREF="mailto:andrewl@microsoft.com" andrewl@microsoft.com  </s>
<s> /A ].  </s>
<s> This recommendation relies on several I proposed /I features of XML which are described in a separate document: /P DD Tags beginning * identify attributes (in the SGML sense) of the enclosing element, not content.  </s>
<s> /DD DD E.g. x a=b/x is the same as x*ab/a/x.  </s>
<s> With the second form, b can contain XML tags.  </s>
<s> /DD DD Element names can be optionally qualified by the name of the defining schema.  </s>
<s> Any element can have a /DD DD I xml-schema /I attribute which introduces the schema, gives it a shortname and makes the schema usable /DD DD Elements set the namespace for their contents.  </s>
<s> The default namespace within any element (the one that /DD DD can be used without qualification) is the namespace in which the element is defined.  </s>
<s> /DD DD Element names can be omitted from closing tags.  </s>
<s> E.g. xb/x is the same as xb/ /DD DD A bodiless element is the same as an empty element.  </s>
<s> E.g. foo/ == foo/foo /DD P With the above syntax proposals, the XML encoding can be nearly a transliteration of the s-expression encoding.  </s>
<s> The suggestion has been made to eliminate some of the special tokens (e.g.  TT label /TT ) and use a TT reference= /TT  attribute on TT for /TT rather than three separate TT for /TT , TT for-immediate /TT , and TT for-indirect /TT tokens.  </s>
<s> These ideas are illustrated in section 6.2.  </s>

<s> /P P In the main, names and other characteristics of section 6.1 are used here to make comparison with the s-expression syntax easier, since our main goal is to verify that XML is able to express the same statements as s-expressions can.  </s>
<s> /P P Schema shortnames are illustrated in these examples.  </s>
<s> The shortnames are chosen according the Java conventions for package names.  </s>
<s> It is overkill for these examples, but shows how one can absolutely avoid any possibility of name conflicts, even as schemas evolve.  </s>
<s> /P P The s-expressions examples use an element called label.  </s>
<s> Obviously, a I label /I is meant to be the root type of all elements: Devoid of any particular properties or attributes, it can be subclassed to become anything, with subclassing effected by the *schema attribute.  </s>
<s> That is, all labels are really particular kinds of things, identified by their *schema attribute.  </s>
<s> Each schema evidently describes one kind of object.  </s>
<s> In contrast, in the XML proposal, all elements are explicitly of some particular type, drawn from the namespace of an xml-schema attribute of a parent element.  </s>
<s> For instance, the first s-expression example has a label of type http://www.w3.org/authors-and-stuff (in the s-expression model, element types are URIs).  </s>
<s> The first XML example introduces an http://www.w3.org schema, then draws from it a particular element type, authors-and-stuff.  </s>

<s> In this case the order of the I same /I attributes is significant.  </s>

<s> /P P Inheritance takes place in a hierarchy of lexically enclosed labels.  </s>
<s> Propagating inherited values is simple if onesees the entire hierarchy.  </s>
<s> From an individual label's standpoint, however, inheritance works using unidirectional links the label has no knowledge of.  </s>
<s> This is confusing: since a label does not know of all the links pointing to it, it can not alone determine the values it inherits (this is the reason why we do not allow inheritance over links expressed as URLs).  </s>
<s> /P P As currently defined in this document, the multiple schemata mechanism does not allow for the use of mixin schemata.  </s>
<s> For flexible means of extending metadata, a full multiple inheritance mechanism may be necessary.  </s>
<s> /P P Error tokens defined by PICS version 1.1 as well as the former version of the PICS-NG proposal are not included in this document.  </s>
<s> There are two ways to introduce error tokens and other similar constructs: errors could be represented by labels (referring to a special error schema, defined together with the other basic PICS&amp;nbsp;schemata), or by allowing additional prefix operators (such as TT error /TT ) in addition to the ones defined by this document (i.e., TT label /TT , TT list /TT and P Since the PICS 1.1 metadata architecture is easily extensible, the old extension mechanism of PICS 1.1 is no longer needed.  </s>
<s> The multiple schemata approach can be used for optional extensions, a single new schemata should be used for mandatory ones.  </s>
<s> /P P Some people have expressed concerns about the fact that old PICS options are now mixed with the transmit names of ratings.  </s>
<s> Technically this is B not a problem /B because we have a way of determining which attributes are which, but from a metadata author's standpoint this can be confusing.  </s>
<s> A possible solution is to put all options into a separate label and make that label a value of a new attribute (called, say, label-attributes).  </s>
<s> The options-schema can be defined in the same definition file as the basic content rating schema, and referred to using the fragment identifier syntax (say, #options).  </s>
<s> Inheritance of individual label options becomes difficult if they are placed in a separate label.  </s>
<s> /P P A minimal, canonical form of the syntax used has to be defined, for purposes of signing PICS-NG labels and for mechanically producing label representations.  </s>

<s> Commentary also includes information acquired in private discussions with Alex Hopmann.  </s>
<s> /P TD FONT SIZE=-1 Web Collections provide a hierarchical structure for storing properties that describe objects.  </s>
<s> A collection is simply an association of field names to values.  </s>
<s> The meanings of these field names are defined by the profile is specified for the given collection.  </s>
<s> /FONT /TD TD In this respect the two models are identical.  </s>
<s> The word profile is used in the same meaning as our term schema, and the word property is used in lieu of attribute.  </s>
<s> /TD TD FONT SIZE=-1 A collection is not required to contain properties correlating to each field in its profile.  </s>
<s> Similarly, a collection may contain properties that do not correspond to any field in its profile.  </s>
<s> A collection may also contain more than one property that correlates to a single field in its profile.  </s>
<s> /FONT /TD TD Unknown attributes are permitted if an application is not concerned of the semantics of a label.  </s>
<s> Lists take the place of multiple occurrences of a property.  </s>
<s> /TD TD FONT SIZE=-1 The order of properties in a collection can be significant in specific applications but is not necessarily significant in all applications.  </s>
<s> Likewise, applications will determine the meaning of multivalued properties, missing properties, and properties that do not correspond to fields in the profile; applications may deem a collection invalid if does not contain appropriate information.  </s>
<s> However applications MUST be able to at a minimum gracefully ignore additional properties that they do not understand.  </s>
<s> TD Schemata define all semantics.  </s>
<s> See the Open Issues section regarding ordering.  </s>
<s> /TD TD FONT SIZE=-1 A primary collection must explicitly refer to its profile.  </s>
<s> Secondary collections usually have implied profiles (such as the profile of the collection which encapsulates them), though they may explicitly refer to a profile.  </s>
<s> /FONT /TD TD The label model has a loosely similar inheritance mechanism.  </s>
<s> The XML Collection model does not specify inheritance very clearly.  </s>
<s> /TD TD FONT SIZE=-1 Web Collections support aggregate profiles.  </s>
<s> This is the ability to specify that a given collection has a properties from a first profile, and furthermore additional properties from other profiles.  </s>
<s> TD FONT SIZE=-1 This Web Collection specification draws a sharp line between the Web Collections syntax and the semantics implied by a particular application.  </s>
<s> A computer program must be able to parse and manipulate the Web Collection data without understanding the specific application.  </s>
<s> It need not however be able to do anything with the data unless it understands that specific profile.  </s>
<s> /FONT /TD TD Without knowledge of semantics, we do not believe any useful manipulation is feasible.  </s>
<s> /TD TD FONT SIZE=-1 Web Collections draw a distinction between two types of URIs.  </s>
<s> This distinction is based on the needs of a syntax parser.  </s>
<s> A URI can be used to point to some other resource (behaving like a link) in which case it is just normal data in the collection (a value), or a URI might be used to include some other resource within the collection (an inline reference).  </s>
<s> A Web Collection parser might use this information to determine whether to encapsulate additional resources with the Web Collection.  </s>
<s> TD Inclusion by reference will be a barrier to adoption by firewall vendors.  </s>
<s> This feature should be excluded from the model.  </s>

<s> This is a first reaction to the hyper-proposal and isn't a fully considered reply.  </s>
<s> The overall approach seems very valuable, if somewhat overwhelming and I think it will be important that the discussion has some structure.  </s>
<s> My main question is to ask for more detailed clarification on the impact on the current status of XML-lang, because it seems that there are significant changes proposed not only to the language but the requirements of processing software.  </s>
<s> I'm mainly addressing 'it shall be easy to write software that processes XML documents'.  </s>
<s> At first sight some of the proposals seem quite forbidding even to a mythical CS student :-) I'm also ignorant of parts of SGML and am not clear how some of what is proposed fits into SGML (I assume it's all legal SGML).  </s>
<s> SD1.  </s>
<s> No problem.  </s>
<s> I found myself doing this all the time when I write on paper serviettes at mealtimes in Barcelona and no-one complained.  </s>
<s> I think it's a selling point for human readers of XML files.  </s>
<s> SD2.  </s>
<s> Please can we have more clarification?  </s>
<s> I have found myself wishing to use something like this in the past, but cannot see how it fits into the SGML language.  </s>
<s> So questions: - is this valid SGML? - if so, can it be represented in the ESIS stream?  </s>
<s> If so, I assume it is a post-parsing process, rather than a parsing process.  </s>
<s> As a greater number of XML-legal constructs are hardcoded into the language, the requirement for a post-parser (or pre-application) grows.  </s>
<s> There is now a substantial amount of processing required for XML-LINK (e.g. is the containment correct, how are attributes inherited) and SD[1-5] puts another substantial burden on the processing.  </s>
<s> SD3.  </s>
<s> Fully supportive of this as a starting point.  </s>
<s> SD4.  </s>
<s> This appears not to require any changes to XML-lang, and is in essence a meta-application.  </s>
<s> I think there is a role for identifying such areas which can perhaps be worked on in parallel to the syntax development.  </s>
<s> The scale of this looks like being beyond the ability of the CS grad to do in less than a few weeks.  </s>
<s> SD5.  </s>
<s> This is almost identical to something I was going to post when the floodgates were opened for discussion.  </s>
<s> I love it.  </s>
<s> It solves one part of the namespace problem - identifying the semantics.  </s>
<s> To solve the namespace collision there has to be some processing at parser level, because presumably the DTDs have the shorter names and need to know they are aliased in the document.  </s>
<s> So running the following through (n)sgmls would presumably throw the error that mml.VAR and cml.VAR were not declared int the DTDs.  </s>
<s> Or is this only intended for WF documents?  </s>
<s> In any cases I see a significant amount of processing required and it's important to highlight where it needs to take place.  </s>
