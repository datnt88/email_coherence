Here's an update on where we are in the process of moving the DeltaV spec to Proposed Standard. 
All IESG documents start their lives as "Internet Drafts". 
Standards-track document goes through a number of life-cycle phases starting at "Proposed Standard", then progressing to "Draft Standard" and finally full "Standard". 
According to RFC 2026 ("The Internet Standards Process -- Revision 3"), a Proposed Standard has the following characteristics: A Proposed Standard specification is generally stable, has resolved known design choices, is believed to be well-understood, has received significant community review, and appears to enjoy enough community interest to be considered valuable. 
However, further experience might result in a change or even retraction of the specification before it advances. 
Usually, neither implementation nor operational experience is required for the designation of a specification as a Proposed Standard. 
However, such experience is highly desirable, and will usually represent a strong argument in favor of a Proposed Standard designation. 
We have gone through a number of working group last calls, and at this time have no outstanding issues. 
We believe the spec is well understood, has received sufficient community review, and has a number of in-progress implementations. 
To make further progress, we need interoperable implementations. 
Implementors, are generally more comfortable dealing with stable specifications, hence the reason for Proposed Standard. 
It provides a specification sufficient for implementation and indicates intent to progress to full Standard. 
The process and rough schedule include: 1. Candidate DeltaV Internet Draft submitted to IETF Application Area Directors for initial review - 4/24/2001. 
2. The area directors give the document a review and send it back to the working group for any changes. 
The working group will respond to these changes through the mailing lists, working group meetings, and or design team meetings as necessary. 
The updated internet draft is then submitted to the Area Directors for further review. 
If there are a number of significant changes, we may want to have an additional working group last call. 
3. Once the document has been approved by the application area directors, it goes out to an IETF wide last call that lasts for a time specified by the area director (at least two weeks). 
The working group will then respond to any feedback from the IETF last call, update the spec as needed, submitting new Internet Drafts. 
If the IETF wide last call results in significant changes or issues, we may have to cycle through the process again to address their issues. 
4. Once we have completed the IETF wide last call, the document is submitted to the full IESG for consideration as a Proposed Standard. 
Depending on the results of the IESG vote, it may be necessary to update the document and resubmit. 
Once the IESG votes to approve the document, it becomes a Proposed Standard, and we're ready to begin moving to Draft Standard. 
Jim, I think that trying to do too much "pipelining" in the process may actually slow you down. 
I don't think it is appropriate to wait until "during IESG last call" to respond to the 6-7 issues that have been raised on the mailing list since the -15 draft of 4/17/01. 
An IESG last call is appropriate when you have a document that you believe has "resolved known design choices". 
Not revising the document now means that you're asking people to review something when you expect to change it. 
The issues I see on the mailing list are: add a DAV:updated-set and DAV:ignored-set in the UPDATE response body. 
# should use # dav:resourcetype to indicate multiple pieces of type information # The response to a VERSION-CONTROL request does not carry # a Location header similar to CHECKIN (Draft 15). 
# Cache-Control: no-cache is not # needed for the VERSION-CONTROL response. 
# "A collection has all the properties of a version." 
# should say "A collection version has all the properties of a version." 
# both the "checkout" and the "working-resource" features # introduce a CHECKOUT method that is affected by these properties, # the fork-control properties should be identified in # both features. 
although perhaps you have a different (longer) list? 
Larry add a DAV:updated-set and DAV:ignored-set in the UPDATE response body. 
Agreed -- though I suspect this will be uncontrovertial. 
Agreed -- ideally it would be sent to the WebDAV WG so that it may apply to ACLs and friends equally well. 
I believe that this was agreed as a non-issue, or rather that Stefan wanted to know when VERSION-CONTROL had affected a resource and when it had not. 
Again, a trivial change that I believe will be non-controvertial.

I'm kicking myself for not keeping the list, but I guess I was expecting Geoff to do so. 
I have asked him to make it generally available as I believe that there are other issues that were raised (but don't ask me to name them without searching g ) Your point is well taken, but I don't think it is as bad as you make out. 
Tim Larry, I didn't mean to imply that we would wait for IETF last call to address issues. 
Only that issues that come up in that last call would need to be addressed, potentially resulting in the need for spec revisions and an additional last call. 
I expect to address issues as soon as they come up, refresh the internet draft, and re-submit to the area directors as needed. 
So I think we're in agreement.

Larry I agree with Tim. 
The changes proposed since version 15 have been minor marshalling changes, editorial changes, or changes with generic WebDAV impact (and therefore are more appropriately handled in the rev of 2518 and not in the DeltaV spec). 
I've been keeping this list just as a folder of email messages, but I'll try to get it posted in summary form to the website this weekend or next week. 
Cheers, Geoff add a DAV:updated-set and DAV:ignored-set in the UPDATE response body.

Tim I've followed Larry's advice, and posted a 15.1 working draft to the web site. 
This contains the editorial changes suggested since the 15 draft was submitted (and a section enumerating these changes), as well as an "issues list" (with proposed resolutions of those issues). 
(The issues Larry enumerated below appear in either the changes list or the issues list).
