Here's my take. 
(I'm still catching up with the archives, so apologies if I go over ground that's already been gone over before.) _The_ most important thing that the Guidelines can ever provide are a set of checkpoints which, if followed by a responsible web designer, will result in increased accessibility for all users, particularly those with special needs. 
That's our mission as _I_ see it, and we need to be careful to _not_ lose track of it. 
Broad principles are very good and very useful. 
They help to give context to the checkboxes and explain why exactly things are done, in addition to heightening awareness and providing web developers with the ability to make their own judgment if they are encountering new technologies or situations not covered by WCAG. 
However... I don't think they're necessary at all in a document that primarily deals with _how to do the right thing_. 
And I think that HTDTRT (acronym for "how to do the right thing") document is of immense value as a formalized, definitive standard for the web, and the list of vague principles is of questionable value to what we are trying to accomplish, by comparison. 
I propose that we focus on the HTDTRT document, but that we also create a Principles of Web Accessibility document that is published as a W3C note and which is referred to extensively in our HTDTRT document. 
A way to visualize this -- if we look at the original strata of the WCAG, the "techniques" were on the bottom and got pushed out to a non-normative W3C Note. 
I simply propose that we do that with the top of the strata as well, putting the broad principles into another Note, which is considered good and valuable, and which can explain the HTDTRT checkpoints, but which is not part of that document itself. 
Then we get to the HTDTRT checkpoints. 
I believe that we need to group related checkpoints together under "strategies" as has been suggested, and I furthermore believe that checkpoints _must_ be technology-based. 
For each group of strategies there should be a set of HTML checkpoints, a set of CSS checkpoints, a set of XML checkpoints, a set of SVG checkpoints, and so on. 
If this means that we will need to publish an addition to the WCAG whenever a new technology is released, then so be it -- it may mean that we need to define WCAG itself in modules a la modular XHTML! 
Checkpoints must be specific and they must be checkable. 
They must be understandable with reference to the WCAG Principles document and the WCAG Examples document. 
(Oh, that's right, we should drop the term "Techniques" for that document because that's not the plainest, most straightforward term for what it does. 
WCAG Examples nee Techniques should be a set of sample code and example which show how to meet each checkpoint.) 
There's my pie-in-the-sky description of how I'd restructure WCAG to make it easier to understand.

Writing individually (and not in my capacity as co-chair): This is ground which has been well covered. 
Providing the practicing web site designer with guidance is only one of the purposes of the document. 
Its other functions include: (a) defining what it means for web content to be "accessible", more abstractly than can be achieved by a set of technology-specific requirements so that the guidelines can continue to apply as technologies evolve; (b) offering technology designers (including those creating, or extending, data formats) criteria with which to ensure that their technologies are accessible; and (c) providing input to other groups concerned with the design and development of accessible technologies, authoring tools, etc., associated with the web. 
These may include educational or policy-oriented groups--whoever finds a precise specification of what "accessible" design amounts to, in the web arena, to be valuable. 
One of the central shortcomings which this working group has identified with WCAG 1.0 is its failure to specify what "accessible" design means, independently of (or more abstractly than) requirements which pertain to particular, existing, standards and technologies. 
At the other end of the continuum, it has been argued that the checkpoints in WCAG 1.0 are not sufficiently specific and verifiable. 
This led to the so-called three-level hierarchy of requirements, its having been generally agreed that the upper two levels should comprise the guidelines. 
The guidelines themselves cannot be changed without proceeding through the W3C process. 
They are supposed to be (and must comprise) a stable document, subject to change only infrequently. 
Consequently, it is not practical to generate a new version whenever a new technology or standard emerges. 
However, this working group has also undertaken to publish checklists and a techniques document which should address the need for specific and precise, technology-specific requirements. 
These must be founded in, and constitute an application of the guidelines--but unlike the latter, as they are non-normative, they are more easily subject to change. 
Of course, as Charles has often pointed out, most web content developers should not be expected to read the guidelines, just as most content designers don't (and are not expected to) read the HTML specification. 
Rather, it is the task of authoring tools, training materials, checklists (including those furnished by this working group) and the techniques document to give practical guidance. 
When these sources are inadequate (for example under circumstances in which one is extending a markup language, proposing a technique of implementation and querying whether it should count as accessible, etc.), that it becomes necessary to consult the "official" (normative) guidelines. 
Which is why the WCAG document is currently useless to a number of audiences. 
It tries too much to be everything to all people. 
I'm not sure if it is possible to define "accessible" in this way in any sort of definitive manner. 
I also question whether or not it is worthwhile to attempt to do so. 
I think we have too many goals here. 
Trying to do too much at once means that nobody gets an adequate answer. 
The information you give a data format designer is vastly different from that you give to a web content developer. 
We're not just talking about presentation or "translation" here, we're talking about very different kinds of content itself. 
Yes, it may be generally agreed, and I certainly don't want to upset applecarts just for the sake of upsetting them, but I also don't feel that the current approach is going to meet the needs of the various constituents that you describe. 
I feel that the fact that we get arguments from BOTH sides indicates not that "we're doing it right" and it shouldn't be touched, but rather that the current approach is simply too complicated to make it worthwhile. 
(I think the fact that the proposed 2.0 outline is ready to rename and restructure the existing setup is proof alone that the matter is NOT nearly as cut and dried as your reply would make it seem.) Then we should not have such things as "compliance with the WCAG" if the WCAG is meant to be a stable, unchanging set of principles. 
We should have compliance with the "techniques" and WCAG should be entirely theory. 
However, that's not the current case now and I don't think it will be in the future. 
WCAG as "a set of principles which you should agree too, and some vague natterings about what might fulfill those principles" is really of little value to _anyone+. 
People are, like it or not, expecting for WCAG to be something you can _conform_ to. 
Perhaps all conformance claims should be taken out of WCAG? 
Which makes me wonder why the W3C AC would even want to approve such a document as the WCAG you describe. 
I don't see the value in a philosophical statement about good web design being of the same caliber as the XHTML spec, for example. 
Except when they need to refer to the spec when they have a question; really, it does happen sometimes. 
I don't think this reasoning is a valid excuse for deliberately making the WCAG inaccessible to the average web content developer. 
The idea that we are writing guidelines which are not meant to be read is frankly preposterous. 
Yes, people have been proposing that for years. 
While it certainly has kept _me_ busy with things to do, I honestly don't think that it's a good excuse either. 
"Our document is meant to be inscrutable, because some unspecified third parties will be translating it into something that real people can read?" 
Come on now. 
Where are these third parties to come from, and how will they know that they are accurately stating what the WCAG really says? 
Do we just take it on faith, for example, that my SUNY presentation is accurate and complete? 
Do I tell my web accessibility students, "Don't even BOTHER reading the WCAG -- it wasn't written for you to be able to understand, they don't really want to reading it, and here, instead just listen to what I tell you?" 
I find such an approach preposterous and a very dangerous attitude for us to have regarding the creation of a standard for use on the web. 
I think we are doing a grave disservice if we continue to allow ourselves this "excuse" indefinitely as a way of avoiding serious issues regarding how we present this material. 
I hope I don't sound hostile -- I mean to sound opinionated and very strongly opposed to this current course of action. 
Naturally I support the W3C's work and will continue to do so; I just think that continuing on the current strategy will do more harm than it will increase accessibility.

I must admit that when I first joined the Web Content and Accessibilty Guidelines group, what I expected was to be working on was, more or less, two documents. 
The first document would be explaining what something had to accomplish to be accessible, and the second one would tell you how to do it. 
As a web designer/content writer/web application programmer for the lion's share of my professional career (not very long, mind you, as I'm only 29 years old), I know that what I want is something to tell me how to follow the 'straight and narrow'. 
Ideally, we would have something like the HTML validator, where a user can point to a URI and have an automated system point out the problems. 
However, accessibility I feel like an 'Accessibility Validator' would feel like a grammar checker... it would point out the glaring errors 'You didn't use an alt attribute', but could only suggest in other places 'This alt attribute is only 3 characters long. 
Are you sure it fully describes the 158kb image it is associated with?' Because it's simply not going to be possible to have a foolproof validator, the average web designer is going to need this list of checkpoints (what do I *have* to do?) and techniques (how do I do it?). 
In my opinion, both of these have to be accessible to the average web designer. 
We can't count on the tools... vi, emacs, and notepad aren't going to be helping you, and yes, a lot of web design is still dne by hand. 
And we can't count on companies having a team, with one person specializing in accessibility... we can't even count on companies having a person that CARES about accessibility. 
As such, the documents we create, to fill the need that I see, have to be accessible (ahem) to the average web designer... and by this, I mean the freelancer who works for the local ISP in his community and is responsible for half the local businesses websites. 
The single webdesigner/programmer who works for the 200-person company. 
An awful lot of content in the world is written by these types of people, and unlike the major portals or the government sites, they don't have a global audience, so accessibility isn't going to be something they are going to feel any real pressure to conform to. 
Basically, the point of my statements here are: An abstract, normative document, that explains what accessibility on the web means, is important. 
However, it is important mostly as a backdrop for which the actual usable documents we create will conform to. 
The average web designer, when told that his code is not valid and is pointed to the W3C validator and given some guidance, will gladly write valid code from then on... it makes sense, and is relatively easy. 
We need to provide the same thing for accessibility, if we want it to be bought into. 
And that means a usable checklist that can be read and understood. 
If we wait until the tools themselves do it all for you... well, let's just say I'm not very optimistic on the time frame. 
Having a three-tiered method, then, is admirable, and I think all three portions are very important. 
But the third tier, the actual 'How Do I Do This?' document is something that we need to have for the content developers. 
Content developers DO go to the specs. 
The HTML and CSS specs tend to be arcane to the user, but if you need to know how to do something, that's one of the best places to find it... I'd like to see the WCAG documents be something that we can use as soon as they are complete, and to that end a checklist is what the web content developer needs.

KB:: "There's my pie-in-the-sky description of how I'd restructure WCAG to make it easier to understand. 
What do you think?" 
WL: I think that's just fine. 
The various components (Principles, Guidelines, Checkpoints, Examples/Techniques) can be gleaned from the total document by means of template query access to the entire corpus if it is appropriately stored. 
Let's agree, if we can that there should be Principles. 
Further that there should be specific coded examples of how to comply with WAI intent whichever technology is being considered. 
How it is "organized" is not only not worth arguing about, it is quite possible trivial to do. 
The new visitor can be presented with the results of a query for the "WAI for dummies excerpts" if that's what's called for. 
However I want to reiterate that what I hoped we were starting to do was to make an abstract, general set of statements ("principles" at this time) and use those as the basis for all the rest. 
So far I've been unable to get anyone to post *just the principles* so we can attack the task of making them "simple but not too simple". 
IMO the rest will go smoother when it springs from those. 
Love. 
ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE JW:: "Providing the practicing web site designer with guidance is only one of the purposes of the document." 
WL: Kynn must remember this just as I must remember that this is one of the purposes g . 
JW:: "The guidelines themselves cannot be changed without proceeding through the W3C process. 
They are supposed to be (and must comprise) a stable document, subject to change only infrequently." 
WL: Kynn's idea that there should be new accessibility examples for every new technology does not fly in the face of this problem. 
If the strata are from most to least general then the top two or so "normative" parts need only infrequent change and the tagged-on parts needed when all the acronyms come out to play will be created on demand - based on the upper, abstract levels. 
We've got to start somewhere and I hope/pray that it is with the abstract statements currently called "principles", which though probably not perpetually immutable, can be comprehensive and *normative* (whatever that means g ). 
Love. ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE 'Principles', stated in reasonable, commonly understood terms should form the basis from which to develop 'checkpoints', 'techniques' - whatever you want to call them. 
If you consider some future group trying to write techniques for technologies we have not yet dreamed of the 'principles' should provide their foundation. 
It is really not very different from our complex legal system which has developed from a few simple rules intended to govern behavior among humans. 
(and thats my 2 cents) Could somebody repeat the current state of the 'principles' for those of those who have fallen a bit behind on the reading?
