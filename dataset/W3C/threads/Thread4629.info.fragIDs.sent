At the risk of huge groans from members of the WGs is there a publicly available Charter or Activity Statement for the XSLT 2.0 / XPath 2.0 / XQuery 1.0 
triumvirate? 
I assume that at least a Charter exists. 
Is that correct? 
Is there anything 
that hinders it being made public?

The one interesting private part of the charter is the projected date, which is not public. 
I think that's a good thing - it's more important to get things right than to hit the date, and we don't want to have to deal with the press if the date moves back. 
Pretty much everything else is reflected in other publicly available documents. 
A lot of the document essentially says we follow the W3C Process Model, spelling it out point by point.

The most recent (July 2002) XML Query WG Charter is public and is available at [1]. 
The dates in the charter reflect the thinking when it 
was adopted and have not been updated. 
The overall XML Activity charter is available at [2] and it references [1]. 
Sorry if that is hard to find - I will try to get our public home page updated with a direct link to the charter. 
The XSL WG charter [3] is somewhat older but it is also publicly accessible.

Ooops - I apologize for my earlier response. 
I had thought this was still private.

The XML Activity charters are public. 
Start at www.w3.org/XML/Activity or www.w3.org/XML/ to find them.
