<s> The one interesting private part of the charter is the projected date, which is not public.  </s>
<s> I think that's a good thing - it's more important to get things right than to hit the date, and we don't want to have to deal with the press if the date moves back.  </s>
<s> Pretty much everything else is reflected in other publicly available documents.  </s>
<s> A lot of the document essentially says we follow the W3C Process Model, spelling it out point by point.  </s>
