The main HTML document is available at: Jan, the pubrules checker indicates [1] : - a missing anchor reported as "Broken Fragment" [2] OK, that fragID is in place now. 
- a few 404 refering to http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/example1/ 
Those were ficticious; the examples have been changed to use "w3.example.org" 
where they didn't point to anything. 
The reattached file has the updated fixes; it's also checked into your CVS as WWW/2001/08/rdf-tests/Overview.html Cheers, jan jan grant, ILRT, University of Bristol.

Thanks, Henri Fallon W3C Webmaster Henri, before publishing this doc (or rdf-primer, rdf-schema or rdf-mt all also on the queue), I'll need to edit all of these docs and include a link to the IPR disclosures (per new pub-rules) associated with the deliverables of the working groups. 
eric miller http://www.w3.org/people/em/ semantic web activity lead http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/ w3c world wide web consortium http://www.w3.org/ OK - actually, they are RDF identifiers. 
Is there some other tool you're using to identify these - it'd be handier if I could run the same linkchecker against the document in future. 
Should all work now.
