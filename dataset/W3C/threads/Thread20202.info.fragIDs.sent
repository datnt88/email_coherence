It is good to hear that Amaya will be getting a new version soon. 
I hope that severl things in the user interfaced are fixed for the Windows 9x version. 
These bugs are: 
1] checking for video color capabilitiies and choosing a better pallette when 256 color mode. 
2] checking for video size and positioning windows inside the frame -- windows that open to right side are off edge when small screen in effect. 
Examples are 'alternate' view and 'structure'. 
The geometry manager needs tweeking here. 
3] Attach horizontal scroll bar funtions so wide text screens can be scrolled. 
This occurs when vieing preformated blocks or .txt 
files 
4] The style instruction background needs to be fixed. 
For example: BODY { background: URL("ivy.gif") 
white } uses the background file only. 
BODY { background: white URL("ivy.gif") 
} also uses only the background file. 
To be consistant with netscape/explorer interpretation both file and color should be used. 
Or you could specify it as first valid one is used... either way Amaya is busted here. 
And hopefully more work is also being done on the help files to ease the new users into Amaya. 
Documentation is detailed for advanced users but is awkward for new people.

That's more or less how I'd expect it to work, as the image will completely overlay any background colour. 
The advantage with what IE and NS do is that you can get an approximate colour whilst you are waiting for the image to load, but the final result is just the image. 
nope -- if the gif is created as a transparent object then it can be used as a watermark, parchment, or in the case of ivy.gif as a border..... the color part would then determine the working area .... for example ivy.gif could be used with a light blue background on some pages and a white background on others ... i use color backdrops to determine area of website one is in ......

I'm not sure that is fixed in the next release. 
The preference dialogue allows you to change the size of all windows by just opening them, resize them and call preference- geometry menu to register current sizes. 
For the position you must edit the file Amaya/amaya/HTML.conf 
This is in the plan of the future release (at the end of the year). 
That should be fixed. 
I agree with you. 
Everybody is welcome to contribute in that effort.

As far as I know, if the 256 colors mode is used, You have to use the system color palette. 
This is how things are supposed to go and this how Amaya deals with 256 colors mode. 
I swithced my display to 256 colors mode and Amaya works fine.
