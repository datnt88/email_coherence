<s> Hi everyone.  </s>
<s> I'm a (Mandrake) linux newbie, and I can't figure out how to install tidy.  </s>
<s> I downloaded the source and tried to compile Makefile with gcc, but got errors.  </s>
<s> I also tried the binary, but it says "cannot execute binary file".  </s>
<s> I know I'm probably way off, but I'm not sure what to do.  </s>
<s> Can anyone point me in the right direction, or is there already a set of instructions somewhere?  </s>
<s> Thanks for your help.  </s>
<s> -Ellery  </s>
<s> I don't think anyone is actively supporting a port of Tidy to Mandrake, at least according to the following link for Linux distributions of Tidy : And since I am not a Mandrake user, I will have some difficulty helping you.  </s>
<s> Specifically what version (date) of the source code did you download (from where), and what sort of errors did you get?  </s>
<s> Chances are, the errors could be fixed quite simply, since the code is quite portable (and appears to be maintained for some Linux distributions).  </s>
<s> And when you say binary, again what version, what platform was it compiled for, and where did you download it from?  </s>
<s> I'm sure if there are any Mandrake users out there, they will speak up.  </s>
<s> Regards, Terry Teague  </s>
<s> I downloaded the latest source code from the official tidy page (I believe it was June 7 or 9).  </s>
<s> When I get it, I just dont know what to do.  </s>
<s> There is a Makefile.  </s>
<s> Can I use this somehow?  </s>
<s> Can someone give me step-by step instructions or tell me if they already exist?  </s>
<s> like: 1. ./Makefile 2. gcc tidy.c 3. make install 4. tidy NOTE these are not even close to how to install.  </s>
<s> I dont think that there's any problem with my configuration, just that I dont know what I'm doing.  </s>
<s> I've found that most source distros have an INSTALL file with simple instructions to install the program, so I'm without a clue when there's no step-by-step instructions.  </s>
<s> I think practically everyone here has more experience with *nix than me, so you'll probably (hopefully) be able to figure this one out.  </s>
<s> Hi Ellery,  </s>
<s> "make install" should copy the binary file to /usr/local/bin.  </s>
<s> You can change the location by updating INSTALLDIR in the Makefile.  </s>
<s> It will also update the permissions to give group and world read/execute privs and change the group and owner to "bin".  </s>
<s> Have a look at the "install" make target for details.  </s>
<s> Have you got the build working yet?  </s>
<s> Also, for x86, you may be able to use one of the other Linux binaries directly - or am I showing my Linux ignorance?  </s>
<s> take it easy, Charlie  </s>
<s> While it isn't explicitly stated on the web site, these beta releases are primarily for people who know what they are doing grin .  </s>
<s> A real release in the future will likely to have some kind of "INSTALL" file.  </s>
<s> But Charlie basically has it correct.  </s>
<s> I don't use the Makefile much on my platform, but when I do, I typically just do a build of Tidy, and don't even bother installing it.  </s>
<s> e.g. make tidy I don't expect there should be any issues on your platform, but if you need to override settings in the Makefile, you can probably do so in the standard way.  </s>
<s> e.g. make tidy CC=cc And as Charlie says, a Linux_x86 pre-built binary may just work out of the box.  </s>
<s> Regards, Terry  </s>
