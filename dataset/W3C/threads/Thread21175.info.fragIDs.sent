<s> sure -- changing the look of the application helps when it leads to user comfort with a metaphor for accessing menus, changing items, or even a comfort zone with the look and feel... i am currently going thru the 'getting used to' java swing widget look instead of windows...... but fussing with an icon is just a time waster, unless the old one is under copyright challenge or there is a significant product line development.... apple still has its apple, cocacola has its outdated but well recognized script, as does mercedes benz star ... oh well .... off to spot more quirks...
