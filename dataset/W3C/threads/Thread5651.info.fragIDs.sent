<s> For example, suppose the classes Employee and EmployeeHistory both share the attribute hasSSN.  </s>
<s> One would like to be able to assert that 'hasSSN' is a key for instances of Employee, but not for instances of EmpoyeeHistory.  </s>
<s> InverseFunctionalProperty does not permit this.  </s>
<s> Currently, single valued restrictions on properties can be stated globally or with respect to instances of a Class.  </s>
<s> Similarly, range restrictions on properties can be stated globally, or with respect to instances of a Class.  </s>
<s> By analogy, keys should have similar flexibility.  </s>
<s> The property we have in mind for specifying a key would have domain Class and range Property.  </s>
<s> One might call it something like 'hasKey' or 'classHasKey'.  </s>
<s> However, if we are broad-minded, we will recognize that sooner or later we will also want to support compound keys.  </s>
<s> So perhaps it could be called 'hasSimpleKey' or 'hasAtomicKey'.  </s>
<s> When n-ary relational tables are converted into RDF format, each table maps to a class and each of a table's columns maps to a property.  </s>
<s> If a table has a compound key (a rather common-place occurrence), then one would like to be able to map its key restriction to RDF as well.  </s>
<s> That would require that we support the notion of a compound key.  </s>
<s> For example, the class EmployeeHistory might have the key hasSSN, historyDate .  </s>
<s> A property representing a compound key declaration might map a Class to a List.  </s>
<s> Perhaps this property could be called 'hasCompoundKey'.  </s>
<s> Provisions for supporting key declarations appear in the OWL "wish list".  </s>
<s> Given how fundamental they are in real-world modelling, they ought to become more than that.  </s>

<s> Dear Bob- Thank you for your comment, the working group has considered it carefully.  </s>
<s> With respect to qualified keys, we considered how this could be added to OWL - see the discussion thread starting at [1] and particularly [2].  </s>
<s> The group considered the addition of Qualified Cardinality Restrictions, which we believe are needed to implement the sort of global keys you need.  </s>
<s> However, the WG decided to postpone the issue of QCRs as discussed in my response to Alan Rector at [3].  </s>
<s> We also considered the issue of Compound Keys.  </s>
<s> We decided this was an important enough area to open an issue on our issues list explicitly.  </s>
<s> We did not, however, come up with a solution as to how  </s>
<s> to address these.  </s>
<s> Instead we also decided to postpone this issue.  </s>
<s> The issue text is:  </s>
<s> TITLE: Compound Keys DESCRIPTION: Relational Databases often use keys that are composed of multiple fields.  </s>
<s> OWL allows keys using owl:InverseFunctionalProperty for a single field (property).  </s>
<s> It would be desirable for OWL to provide the compound keys capability as well.  </s>
<s> STATUS: POSTPONED RAISED BY: J. Hendler based on a Last Call comment raised by Bob MacGregor: Closing Comments: While compounds keys would be desirable to add, there is some difficulty in adding them in the current OWL syntax, similar to the problem arising for "qualified" properties (see discussion under issue 3.2).  </s>
<s> In addition, for the OWL DL profile, it is still something of a research issue (c.f. how these are best realized by DL reasoners.  </s>
<s> There is also a question as to whether mixing datatype and object type in a compound key would be allowed, and whether it would cause difficulties to reasoners.  </s>
<s> Please let us know if this decision to (a) acknowledge that our design is lacking, but (b) postpone further design work to a future version is acceptable.  </s>
