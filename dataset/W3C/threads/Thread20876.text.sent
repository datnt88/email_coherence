Hi, Attributes window has a different behaviour in Amaya 8.1b than in previous releases. 
Before, when you clicked on the Apply button the window did not close. 
It was very useful when you wanted to apply the same attribute to several elements, because you did not have to write the value each time. 
Now, in Amaya 8.1b (windows XP), when you click on the Apply button, the Attributes window closes. 
I suppose there is a reason for this change. 
If it is not possible to return to the old behaviour, can a fourth button (apply without closing) be added?

This is a strongly rooted convention, of the kind that should respected. 
It would be fine to be able to close with esc every other window except the main one. 
For example all views like structure, errors, etc. 
Only exception might be a source view with uncommited changes. 
Notice that the source view is different to the other windows in that it has a means to be closed without resorting too the mouse, with alt f4 in windows, the official platform end-program message.
