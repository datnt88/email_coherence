<s> Dear UAWG, The W3C Team has just started a four-week W3C Advisory Committee review of a revised UAWG charter [1].  </s>
<s> The review (rather than simple extension) was necessary since the WG is being rechartered explicitly as a "Royalty-Free Working Group".  </s>
<s> The new charter duration is until 1 May 2003.  </s>
<s> We should be able to continue our work unaffected by this.  </s>
<s> Cheers, - Ian [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/charter-20011218 Ian Jacobs (ij@w3.org)  </s>

<s> That is certainly good news for me.  </s>
<s> Will/is RF be part of other WAI recharterings?  </s>
<s> I believe so, yes.  </s>
<s> That's not really a departure from the current charters, just a more formal statement of it in terms of W3C's "Current Patent Practice Note" [1].  </s>
