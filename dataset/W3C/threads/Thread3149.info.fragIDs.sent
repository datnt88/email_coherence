Just reread this more carefully from Leonard: In most conventional thesauri, "related" relationships are treated as 
symmetric, even though more precise specification would recognise that 
many of them are directional, e.g. activity/agent, process/product, cause/effect and so on. 
If such a conventional thesaurus is encoded in SKOS format, should such 
relationships be shown as "skos:relatedSymmetric", that being the way they are treated, or should they be given the more general coding "skos:related", leaving the way open to refine the nature of the relationship in future? 
Does anyone have any thoughts on this?

If we define skos:related as being symmetric, can we define subProperties as being inverse, or otherwise not entirely symetric? 
If we can do this at the same level (I think these are both in OWL, but I am not familiar enough with the specifications to know the answer to my question above) then I think it is the best solution. 
Otherwise, in the interest of not making the tricky (but often interesting) things impossible, I suggest we define relatedSymmetric as a subProperty of related, and make that a symmetric relation. 
(Alternatively we could define related as being symmetric, and a subProperty of rdfs:seeAlso, and non-symmetric relations as subProperties of seeAlso or 
of some relatedAsymmmetric property. 
The two proposals are just alternate labels for the same concepts, as far as I can tell).

Yeah, they are. 
It's a question of convenience.
