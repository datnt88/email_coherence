I am interested in choosing effective shortcut letters for AccessKeys. 
By effective I mean ones that don't interfere with either 1. Keyboard use of a browser 2. Keyboard use of JAWS and WindowEyes As an example I would rule out using F E V A T H becuase these provide access to the main menu bar in Internet Explorer 5.5 Also 'D' because this provides access to the address bar. 
Does this seem reasonable? 
If so, if anyone would like to post or send to me other shortcuts that are good not to use then I will post the results on line Cheers Graham Oliver 'Making on-line information accessible' Mobile Phone : +64 25 919 724 - New Zealand Work Phone : +64 9 846 6995 - New Zealand AIM ID : grahamolivernz Do You Yahoo!?

perhaps this is the time to review an experiment I am testing? 
our current home page http://www.peepo.com 
uses javascript to capture keystrokes, though one can still 'type' in forms. 
comments please, don't hold back. 
I find the system very useful, my students have learnt to use it, and do so frequently, though not all the time. 
you'd have to try it to explore it's functionality, (or lack of).

interesting, but it wasn't very "intuitive" I phuzzed around with it but if I were actually looking for something particular I'm not sure I would have been able to find it easily Bob

I had a play with it again. 
It is starting to make sense, with the audio clarifying some of what is going on. 
(Could you add a musical backing to the word "music" ?) I realise that it is a development project, but I was sorry to see that the keyboard navigability had gone again. 
Nice ideas. 
It is a shame that multimedia doesn't work in a more standard way at the moment.

Charles McCN Basically I throw snippets together to get a working prototype and then refine... the homepages only really worked in IE5.5 and then I added on a little code to get it to work in a few others. the beta site is being built up from scratch supposedly as 'fully' accessible, anyway as best as I can get it with my skills. 
for about 3 weeks I've been on holiday, and Phoebe is back to school middle of next week, then I have a couple of weeks supposed down time and hope to incorporate a few more modules. 
sound, and keyboard navigability have high priority, and might actually get done... the linking is currently down, can't remember why, but an attempt to fix some problem. 
thanks again, I didn't realise people liked it as much as they do.
