<s> NO. This is related to what Pat was complaining about.  </s>
<s> Basically, a "Positive entailment test" with premise document P and consequent document C passes if: - P has an interpretation (ie, contains no semantic errors wrt the constraints imposed by the interpretation rules used for the test case) AND  </s>
<s> - P entails C. A "negative entailment test" passes if: - P has no valid interpretations (contains a semantic error) OR - P is ok but does not entail C.  </s>
<s> The reason for this is to permit the following tests to be expressed: these are all the scenarios we want to be able to test (I think) - Document D1, semantically ok (wrt some interpretation constraints, let's say, rdf+rdfs+dt[xsd:integer] ).  </s>
<s> Document D2, contains semantic errors wrt the same interpretation constraints (the MT makes it always come out false).  </s>
<s> Document D3, a well-formed entailment of D1.  </s>
<s> Document D4, a well-formed document that is not entailed by D1.  </s>
<s> With the current test definitions, these can be expressed naturally by introducing an empty document, E. Then D1 is semantically ok (+ve ent test, D1 - E) D2 has semantic errors (encoded by -ve ent test, D2 -/- E) The relationship between D1 and D3 is captured by  </s>
<s> (+ve ent test, D1 - D3) The relationship between D1 and D4 is captured by (+ve ent test, D1 - E) (+ve ent test, D4 - E) (-ve ent test, D1 -/- D4) If you want to use straightforward _entailment_ (not this modified notion used for the test cases) then you can do so BUT this requires you to come up with a URI for a document that is abosultely false - ie, unsatisfiable under any set of constraints.  </s>
<s> While such a document, F, might be handy, it seems a bit beyond the scope of a test case document to slip it under the radar.  </s>
<s> It also means that most of the scenarios outlined above require multiple test cases to encode.  </s>
<s> It seemed simplest to avoid the need for F and to leave test cases captured using the current constructs.  </s>
<s> I'm happy to revise this if you think it's necessary.  </s>

<s> Is this _really_ the case?  </s>
<s> I thought we'd got _distinct_ literal nodes for "foo"^^ datatype , "foo"@en^^ datatype and "foo"@fr datatype in the abstract syntax; then it's down to a _datatype_ entailment to throw away the language tag if it's unimportant.  </s>
<s> That is, eg:foo eg:bar "10"@en^^ xsd:integer .  </s>

<s> analogously to the dataype[xsd:integer]-entailment of eg:foo eg:bar "010"^^ xsd:integer .  </s>
<s> Thus datatypes that care about language tags have them available for the lexical- value mapping if required...? I'd understood that we'd got tidy, lang-tagged, datatyped literals behaving themselves as of several telecons ago.  </s>
