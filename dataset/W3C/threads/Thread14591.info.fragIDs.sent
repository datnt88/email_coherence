<s> Interesting question on IG - Do we have ready-made comments on this, or is it an issue we should try to resolve as a working group?  </s>

<s> what does that mean: don't use hr for presentational purpose?  </s>
<s> when and how are you allowed to use it?  </s>
<s> hr has a semantic meaning - It means that what came before the rule  </s>
<s> was very different to what was after it, or a logically separate section of a long document, especially a numbered document.  </s>
<s> Putting it another way ... /p hr / p ... is far stronger a change in meaning than ... /p hr / p ... Really the quote: 'Do not use ... horizontal rule "HR" for presentation purposes.' should be 'Do not use any HTML tags for presentation purposes'.  </s>
<s> There were some HTML tags with presentation purposes, but thankfully they're being phased out.  </s>

<s> [I've been wondering about this for ages now]  </s>
<s> My current thinking is that sometimes, hr / represents "new context".  </s>
<s> A horizontal rule is a separator between two less related parts of a document, hence the big horizontal rule in the way.  </s>
<s> It is unfortunate that it is called "hr", for "nc - or newcontext" would have been much better, but there you are.  </s>
<s> If you use it as a newcontext marker, you should set some kind of aural property as well:- hr { pause-before: 2s; } To show that it marks up a new context, or even play some kind of sound.  </s>
<s> I still don't often use " hr / " preferring instead to use div class="newcontext" or div class="islandcontext" or whatever, because I'm a purist and I still see hr / as being defined [1] in HTML 4.01 [2] as a horizontal rule across the page, rather than a semantic element indicating a change in context.  </s>
<s> hr / is not included in XHTML Basic, and as part of the presentational module of XHTML m12n, I consider it to be deprecated.  </s>

<s> I agree that the purist should go with div elements, and some kind of border seperating them.  </s>
<s> I guess that is what is anticipated by the newer specifications - I also recognise that in a visual rendering the line that appears is extremely helpful.  </s>
<s> Actually I thought hr stood for Have a Rest - in other words step back and start in some slightly fresh context.  </s>
<s> So, to rely on CSS, or to use hr for now - that is the question... (at least as I see it) Charles McCN [I've been wondering about this for ages now]  </s>

<s> Chaals, Since the last time this subject came up, I worked on the visuals for some web pages for a blind woman.... her original text included a few hr / 's .... seems to me that if she can learn to insert them, some/many/most blind folks can understand what they symbolize.  </s>

<s> How do the most popular screen readers (JAWS for xample) currently render hr / ?  </s>
<s> Is there a way to control that with CSS or in the user settings somehow?  </s>
<s> Tokenization of hr / could be a good thing, but it would be outside the scope of its use as defined in HTML 4.01 - put a line across the screen.  </s>
<s> I take this as meaning don't do anything on any other media, which seems a very odd thing for the HTML 4.01 specification to allow... maybe I'm reading between the wrong lines?  </s>
<s> Anywa, I think that if there is a change in context somewhere in the document, it needsto be reflected in the markup somewhere because this is a structural change... but that structure obviously shouldn't say how it should be rendered.  </s>
<s> div class="context" is, to me, a bit of a hack... probably just as dirty as using hr / in the first place... Advantage: is media independant Disadvantage: relies on CSS: doesn't have a default behaviour or any attached semantics.  </s>
<s> I suppose that another idea would be to use (deep breath) an image, because then you can set CSS equivalents, an alt, and a longdesc.  </s>
<s> Ugh, this one has me baffled.  </s>
<s> Maybe it's time to put 4.01 on the bonfire?  </s>
