Hello all, I have not found any info about this in the archives. 
I have to post a large doc that contains redacted testimony. 
What would be the best way to accomplish this from a compliance standpoint? 
I could use a black pixel that I stretch and have an alt tag for it. 
Or would something else be preferred? 
Thanks in advance Michele Duell michele_duell@signalcorp.com What is redacted testimony?

We had just concluded a thread regarding this very subject, so no one responded to your query. 
Almost always, this is a very friendly and helpful group. 
Kynn even contributed a backward compatible style sheet! 
Please take a look at the archives with the thread name "Accessibility barrier?" posted by Melinda Morris-Black at URL: "Redacted" is lawyer-speak for taking a big, black magic marker and crossing out items in a document that the redactor thinks are confidential. 
A typical case is items released by United States government agencies under the Freedom of Information Act, where they cross out every word but "the". 
(In response to Mr. Bailey's separate post, the thread he cited concerned a blacklined document, lawyer-speak for INS and DEL . 
Jeez, and people think computers have jargon!) 
I'm not quite sure what stretching a black pixel means. 
Would this approach work properly where a user was using a large font? 
One alternate approach would be to use Cascading Style Sheets. 
The danceable example below seems to work okay on Netscape 4.7 and Internet Explorer 5.01. 
This approach allows the redacted material to scale with the font the browser is using. 
It would not work well where the browser was using a user style sheet which set colors. 
(There might be a JavaScript-based solution to this.)One word of caution: I read someplace that using the same background-color and text color is considered spamming by some search engines. 
I do not know if this applies to CSS. 
I also do not know if you want these pages spidered in any event. 
Would this approach be better from an accessibility standpoint, or am I taking the commandment that "Thou Shalt Use CSS Always" in too fundamentalist a spirit?

There is a basic problem here - if the content is shipped out as part of the source then it would only take a reasonably bright 9 year old to figure out how to find out what was hidden. 
I suggest you physically delete the stuff, and add a note saying "[redacted testimony]" in its place.

Dear Charles: recommended (and for precisely the reason you gave). 
I continue to believe that a CSS-solution is superior to Ms. Duell's original graphics-based proposal. 
The size of the black boxes would adjust with the user's font selection, so presumably would be easier to see. 
Would in-line text be easier than, the same as, or harder than an "ALT" for screen-reader users? 
Regards,
