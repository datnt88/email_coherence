Not a show stopper, but still a big nit... 
ACTION 2003-01-10#8 (gk) supply words for concepts section 3.3 to address PatS' concerns that we stress DTing is not XSD-only. 
Old: RDF uses the datatype abstraction defined by XML Schema Part 2: Datatypes [XML-SCHEMA2]. 
A datatype consists of a lexical space, a value space and a datatype mapping. 
New: RDF uses the datatype abstraction defined by XML Schema Part 2: Datatypes [XML-SCHEMA2], and may be used with any datatype definition that follows this pattern. 
A datatype consists of a lexical space, a value space and a datatype mapping. 
This still IMO reads that "any XML Schema datatype" rather than "any datatype that conforms to the definition of an rdfs:Datatype". 
Perhaps: 
RDF uses the datatype abstraction defined by XML Schema Part 2: Datatypes 
[XML-SCHEMA2], and may be used with any datatype definition that follows 
this model, even if not actually defined in terms of XML Schema. 
A datatype 
consists of a lexical space, a value space and a datatype mapping.

Looks like we could go as is and fix the wording in last call. 
However, if 
Graham and Patrick agree updated text, I can easily apply the change.

I'm fine with either scenario, though fixing it before last call will likely avoid explanations during last call...

I'm OK with Patrick's, modulo s/model/pattern/. 
(I think yet another use 
of "model" maybe unhelpful.)

Fair enough, though I had a very hard time reconciling any interpretation of 'pattern' I'm familiar with to the definition of rdfs:Datatype. 
Perhaps 'framework'? 
Or maybe just repeat 'abstraction', which is of course consistent with the beginning of the paragraph. 
Still, I'll leave that to editorial discretion.

I have updated the text to: [[RDF uses the datatype abstraction defined by XML Schema Part 2: Datatypes [XML-SCHEMA2], and may be used with any datatype definition that conforms to this abstraction, even if not actually defined in terms of XML Schema.]] Please shout if you disagree.
