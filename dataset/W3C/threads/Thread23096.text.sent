B.1.1: Scope of a binding "An element is said to be within the scope of the binding" this phrasing is poor. 
to which binding does "the" refer? the reader may be expected to understand it to be "the binding of the element' identifier's prefix to the element's identifier's namespace name", but that concept is ungrounded at this point in the text. the least one needs to do is to turn the sentence around, with which the "the" is more appropriately an "a": "If an element's identifier's prefix is bound to the same namespace URI in the [in-scope namespaces] defined in [ XML Information set ] as the namespace URI of the identifier itself, then the element is said to be within the scope of a binding." 
which calls attention to the root of the problem: that the concept "within the scope of the binding" is at odds with the definition of "the scope of a binding" as fixed in "namespaces in xml", according to which the inference flows from the other direction. 
the consequence of the draft's inversion is that the it suggests that, where the apparent binding (after all there _is_ a binding) conflicts with the contingent binding which would be imputed from the incidental element identifier, it is necessary to introduce a new binding. 
this is not true. 
one need only change the prefix to reflect the actual apparent bindings. 
as a change to the attribute appears to be the approach suggested when "polishing" attributes, it is why does the same not apply to the element identifier? 
Would "within the scope of a prefix-to-namespace binding" help? 
This is correct. 
Remember, the DOM does not require that all namespace declaration attributes be present. 
Thus, there may be implied bindings, which may conflict with explicit ones. 
The namespace fixup algorithm is about finding and "realizing" those; the namespace lookup algorithm behaves "as if" fixup had been performed. 
Yes, if a different prefix happens to be available which is bound to the same URI, changing the prefix would suffice. 
I know this was considered during the design of the namespace fixup/lookup algorithms, and various trade-offs were discussed; I'd have to re-read the pseudocode to refresh myself on what the current status is and why.

not really, because the next clause asserts a definition which is at odds with the standard definition. 
the problem is that being in the scope of an identical binding is not the same as being in the scope of a binding. 
for the purposes of normalization and serialization, the dependancy established by "namespaces in xml" must be reversed. 
that is, the logical requirements of serializing/normalizing are that "in the scope of a binding" mean that "some prefix is bound to the namespace name", not "the prefix is bound to some namespace name". 
anything else elevates the prefix to the universal name identifier, which contradicts the intent of "namespaces in xml". 
i'm not really arguing from "the dom", but from logical necessity. 
from which it follows that neither prefixes nor namespace attributes must be present. 
they can both be synthesized when serializing/normalizing. i understand the algorithm. 
i am surprised that the approach to eliminating overconstrained assignments if is to change the namespace attribute set (that is to add one) rather than to change the prefix. 
i'm curious.
