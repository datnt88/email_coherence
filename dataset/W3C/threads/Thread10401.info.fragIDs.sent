There is an updated version of the Lbase note at which passes all the W3C filters (except the pubrules seems unable to find pieces of boilerplate which are definitely there. 
) 
This version has all the links and references updated to 0905 , uses the same RDF/S translation as the semantics doc, has a little extra discussion of different translation styles, and has a bug in the description of strings fixed. 
Changes noted in a change log at the end.

Excellent. 
I think I can tweak it for pubrules; it can be fussy w.r.t. linebreaks and whitespace sometimes. 
Shall I check it into W3C CVS in RDFCore's shadow-TR space, or are you still fiddling with detail? 
cheers, Dan 
Oliver Corby found some XMLliteral /XMLLiteral typos which are now fixed. 
So, should be ready to go.

As of an hour ago (Monday 1900 US Central time) the version at that URL has some small fixes following comments by PFPS and Olivier Corby.
