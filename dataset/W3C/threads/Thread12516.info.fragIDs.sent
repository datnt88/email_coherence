<s> Hi Just a clarification here.  </s>
<s> Were we supposed to discuss this or was it just supposed to be posted?  </s>
<s> I don't see any discussion, so I'll just say that it is trimmed nicely as compared to what is currently at I speculated whether it could just be included in ATAG 2.0 and/or the TECHS 2.0 document.  </s>
<s> There is the bit at the beginning that states The Authoring Tools Accessibility Guidelines v2.0 (ATAG 2.0) includes five "Relative Priority Checkpoints": These checkpoints refer to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) as the "benchmark" for what constitues accessible content.  </s>
<s> However, it is important to notice that the ATAG 2.0 guidelines document, does not specify a version of WCAG with which to conform.  </s>
<s> Instead, it is left up to the evaluator to choose a whichever version of WCAG (listed in this document) is appropriate for their circumstances.  </s>
<s> This should help developers conform to ATAG 2.0, even if they have been working towards WCAG version 1.0.  </s>
<s> In addition, if future versions of WCAG are released, it will necessitate a new version of this note, rather than a new version of ATAG.  </s>
<s> That would mean this note does need to exist as an independent document.  </s>
<s> Couldn't it be trimmed even more to say that 2.0 "...includes checkpoints with "Relative Priority".  </s>
<s> These checkpoints refer to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) as the "benchmark" for what constitutes accessible content.  </s>
<s> Note, however, that the ATAG 2.0 guidelines do not specify which WCAG version to follow.  </s>
<s> The evaluator can choose whichever version of WCAG, as explained below, is appropriate for their circumstances.  </s>
<s> This should enable developers to conform to ATAG 2.0, even if they have been working toward WCAG version 1.0..." Then explain how in 1.0 they have priorities and in 2.0, levels.  </s>
<s> Everything that comes after "...rather than a new version of ATAG." in Jan's original posting.  </s>
<s> This could then be included in the ATAG 2.0 document itself, without being a separate note.  </s>
<s> Since [WCAG-REFS] is a reference item, the WCAG-REFS could just refer to the line in ATAG 2.0 where this text starts.  </s>
<s> Couldn't it?  </s>
<s> Just my .14 kroners worth!  </s>

<s> Resolving ATAG 2.0 References to WCAG Working Draft [Day Month Year] This version: Latest version: Previous version:  </s>
<s> Hi Karen, You were working from an older version of the references document.  </s>
<s> I had proposed an updated version in: However, I think your edits make things more clear, so I added them in to the new draft and have attached the result to this message.  </s>
<s> The reason that this document is contained within its own document (intended to be a W3C Note), is that ATAG 2.0, as a W3C Recommendation, will be a normative document.  </s>
<s> If we were to say tools can use WCAG 1.0 or 2.0 (when it comes out) and the WCAG-WG instead puts out a v1.5 or in the future puts out a v3.0, then our WG either needs to put out an errata document or publish again.  </s>
<s> Instead, we can publish ATAG 2.0 referring to WCAG abstractly.  </s>
<s> Then all we have to do is update this small note when future versions of WCAG are released.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, if it turns out that our techniques (also a W3C Note) are aimed a particular version of WCAG, we may end up having to update our techniques if the WCAG-WG puts out new versions.  </s>
<s> In that case, the WCAG references piece might as well go in the in the techniques.  </s>

<s> It was late and I had many windows opened while contemplating my response!  </s>
<s> Thanks for the clarification about the need for this note.  </s>
<s> Makes sense.  </s>
