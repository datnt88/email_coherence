<s> Discussion Status: awaiting discussion Evaluation: For any HTML element defined to take a %LENGTH, %PIXELS, %MULTILENGTH, or %MULTILENGTHS, a validated value should either end with "%" or begin with "+" or "-" or use the "em" unit.  </s>
<s> Exception: "width" and "height" attributes of IMG elements.  </s>
<s> Example Language: This element uses absolute units of measure rather than relative units of measure.  </s>
<s> Repair Technique: Allow user to change the units of measure.  </s>
