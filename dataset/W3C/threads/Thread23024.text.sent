This version introduces 2 new interfaces: TypeInfo and DOMConfiguration. 
The namespace algorithms has been modified and is in the process of being clarified. 
The draft is not ready to move to last call but we're getting there... Philippe Hi, Thanx for updating the namespaceNormalization alg, The example given for B.1.1:Conflicting namespace declaration is little bit confusing, It is telling we can have a same prefix pointing to more than namespaceURI..is it Correct? 
feel free to correct me if understood wrongly Suppose i have document fragment like this zeeJan:zeeKING xmlns:zeeJan="www.zee.com" 
FooJan:JustValue="Just A Value" FooJan:Pagal="MADYFOO" FooJan:Pagal="TestME" xmlns:FooJan="www.honeyFoo1.com" 
xmlns:FooJan="www.honeyFoo2.com" 
In the above fragment i have two attributes like FooJan:Pagal="MADYFOO" ,FooJan:Pagal="TestME" Prefix is same for both namespaceURI According to u r exapmle the above one is correct..(my understanding) when i open this in IE ,it giving error... kindly help me to understand correctly, Best Regards, Pavithran Hi Pavithran, Yes, it is possible if user edits a DOM tree. 
The above is not well-formed per XML 1.0 [1] and per Namespaces [2]. 
To understand the namespace algorithms you need to read and understand XML 1.0 and Namespaces in XML specifications.
