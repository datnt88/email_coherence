<s> Here's a short justification for XML Dig Sigs.  </s>
<s> Any comments?  </s>
<s> Rationale for XML Digital Signature.  </s>
<s> It offers a "visible" sign of commitment to the privacy policy.  </s>
<s> Transparency  </s>
<s> is all very well but many people see P3P policies as empty statements which are simply posted "to make Internet Explorer work".  </s>
<s> A digitally signed seal of approval offers users a more watertight legal route in the case of dispute and perhaps more importantly, gives companies an opportunity to "put their money where their mouth is" and thereby to differentiate themselves from other organisations.  </s>
<s> The impact of including this possibility in the specification would not be too great.  </s>
<s> The only necessary elements would be a simple url type attribute in a policy and a specification for policies which we almost have already.  </s>
<s> It could therefore be included to see what uptake there might be.  </s>
<s> In a sense this has been done already, but I think that people cannot be able to take up this suggestion without it being made a bit clearer with examples or a perhaps a java toolkit/web service for XML signing a policy and prf.  </s>
<s> Giles  </s>
<s> It does, and in as far as that happens that is a good thing.  </s>
<s> However, I have two comments:  </s>
<s> 1. Would it lead to the presumption that a unsigned P3P policy is somehow less committed to or binding?  </s>
<s> 2. Who exactly is validating the signature?  </s>
<s> This isn't something users are likely to comprehend or be able to easily do.  </s>
<s> (How is it that they are getting the service's public key for the validation, this presumes a level of infrastructure and knowledge which is not yet present.)  </s>
<s> So I think a signed privacy is a nice exercise, but don't find it that compelling in the b2c scenario and might weaken the interpretation of a unsigned policy.  </s>
<s> I don't think by adding non-repudiation to a P3P Policy one reduces the meaning or value of a non-signed policy.  </s>
<s> The signature does not add meaning to the policy.  </s>
<s> It is only a question of evidence.  </s>
<s> That's actually a good question.  </s>
<s> I would _love_ to see native XML Signature support in browsers to be able to sign XHTML-pages (for courts and laws e.g.).  </s>
<s> But I agree, we are far from there.  </s>
<s> It might create yet another incentive to implement XML Sig into an agent.  </s>
<s> I think the signature requirement is more or less a requirement to be able to link old-style paper procedures with digital ones without to much change.  </s>
<s> (see EU-Directive on Sig that create an _equivalent_ to handwritten signature) So for me, it's a nice enhancement, but not a must be.  </s>
<s> In fact, it might be nice to have a common way to do signatures on policies, if there are many ways to implement that.  </s>
<s> But Jo, you can tell better _if_ there are really many ways.. Rigo  </s>
