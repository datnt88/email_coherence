As I'm working with Amaya and Emacs for correction, I would like to know how to support Special ISO-8859-1 caracters input with Amaya like ?, ?, ... (I don't like to enter entities). 
Note that it looks a bit odd because under Linux, any X application supports this caracters input (even the big bugged Netscape 4)... Thank you, Alexandre Normally Alt-Right o ^ generates ?, etc. 
To support special ISO-8859-1 caracters input with Amaya, use the "Enable multi-key" option (see the "Configuring Amaya" page in the Help menu).
