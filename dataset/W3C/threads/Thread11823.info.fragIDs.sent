<s> One of the things we should have before wego to last call is a good set of techniques.  </s>
<s> These need to be both general abstracted principles which are explained, rather than listed for verification, and specific examples of how it might be done, which of course makes all sorts of a ssumptions about user interfaces etc.  </s>
<s> That is not a problem, so long as those assumptions are clear from teh technique text, since the techniques do not have to be implemented, but are merely provided in a separate document as further guideance to developers wishing to implement the checkpoints and looking for ideas, or for several different explanations in order to better understand the checkpoint.  </s>
<s> One of the questions that we might want to answer is whether the techniques are satisfactory as a list of points, or whether we should be trying to create a more flowing prose framework for them.  </s>
<s> Alternatively we can let the document go to the wider review audience of a last call and see if it is raised as an issue.  </s>

<s> Unfortunately, we don't have much data back about whether people like/find useful the WCAG Techniques document.  </s>
<s> I think that the document needs to be readable on its own, which to me implies that some wrapper prose is necessary.  </s>

<s> The major point I was trying to make is that there are cases where a broad-based, abstract introduction is helpful, and others where a minutely detailed example is the most use.  </s>
<s> Often different people will look for different types of technique in the same checkpoint, so I think we need to have them all.  </s>
<s> I am inclined to agree with Ian that we can add prose wrapping after the last call (and I expect that part of monitoring the guidelines in a post-recommendation phase will be to further refine the techniques based on longer and more extensive implementation experience, even if the guidelines themselves are perfect in version 1.0).  </s>

<s> Gregory, I agree - "we desperately need more of this type of review."  </s>
<s> But it is very difficult to get.  </s>
<s> When I visited the Top Page developers in Tokyo earlier this month, I tried to get them to be involved.  </s>
<s> They were not willing to take the time to participate.  </s>
<s> Top Page in the US is Home Page Builder in Japan.  </s>
<s> My understanding is that Home Page Builder is the top selling web authoring tool in Japan.  </s>
<s> They are implementing a neat accessibility checker for the next version.  </s>
<s> Checking alt text, for example puts the user in an situation to easily to fix the problem, when alt text not present.  </s>
<s> You can select which features you want checked.  </s>
<s> The default will be to check for alt text for active images, for page titles, EMBED Loops, and OBJECT Contents.  </s>
<s> I believe all Syntactic features can be chosen for checking.  </s>
