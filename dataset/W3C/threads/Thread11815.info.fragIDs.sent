<s> Do not insert place-holder equivalent text, except in cases where human-authored text has been written for a object whose function is known with certainty.  </s>

<s> This should then be caught as an accessibility error to be repaired.  </s>
<s> Where an object is part of a standrad library, for which alternatives have been included, those alternatives may be added.  </s>
<s> For example, a navigation bar might have a standard set of icons, with alternative text such as search, index, site map linked to automatically generated pages.  </s>
<s> Checkpoint 2.1.1 should cross-reference this, as well as the section on checking and repairing.  </s>

<s> I think 2.7.2 (Implement applicable accessibility features in any discussionof the help system) is really about integrating accessibility into the look and feel - covered by guideline 2.4 Maybe it is a technique for checkpoint 2.4.2, or a checkpoint under that section.  </s>
<s> Any opinions?  </s>
<s> I also think that this is one of the areas where the distinction between section 2 and section 3 is meaningless.  </s>
<s> I therefore think Ian's proposal to merge the two sections has merit, and should be revisited.  </s>

<s> Even in the sections where there might be a dubious overlap such as 'integrate help files' and 'allow user configuration', there are still clear distinctions and merging them would only muddy the waters and confuse the reader.  </s>
<s> Integrate help files and allow user configuration are general software accessibility principles that we will probably only cover by reference in section 3, so the overlap is a mute point.  </s>
<s> 3 does not fit into 2 in any other way.  </s>
<s> Trying to make 2 more general to accomodate the principles in 3 would weaken the message.  </s>

<s> I don't think merging the two would confuse the reader.  </s>
<s> I think that if done right it would strengthen the message that accessibility of the tool and accessibility of the output are parts of making a tool accessible, and that both things are necessary.  </s>
<s> The overlap is primarily in the sections identified by Jutta - 2.6 and 2.7, but it seems to me a clear overlap rather than a dubious one.  </s>

<s> Obviously the two parts are related and thus should remain part of the same document, but I have not heard a convincing reason why anyone would be helped by placing the two guideline sections into one long list.  </s>
