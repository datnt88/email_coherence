<s> CWMClone in SWI-Prolog posted by bijan at 2002-02-25 15:56 (+) bijan: Alpha release, temporary site ("Cool URIs may not change, but geeky URIs change all the time!"0 bijan: It actually reads and runs a reasonable subset of N3.  </s>
<s> I have some confusions about []/log:forSome, built-ins aren't built, er, in yet.  </s>
<s> Nor does it (yet) support any of cwm.py's cmd line interface.  </s>

<s> danbri_: Very cool!  </s>
<s> But have you considered rewriting this in Python?  </s>
<s> bijan: No. AaronSw: Sean has something similar in Python, though.  </s>
<s> bijan: Well, GEEZ, TBL has something similar in Python too!  </s>
