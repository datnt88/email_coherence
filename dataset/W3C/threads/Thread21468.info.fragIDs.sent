Tim, I missed this while we were in france... have you seen it? 
CWMClone in SWI-Prolog posted by bijan at 2002-02-25 15:56 (+) bijan: Alpha release, temporary site ("Cool URIs may not change, but geeky URIs change all the time!"0 bijan: It actually reads and runs a reasonable subset of N3. 
I have some confusions about []/log:forSome, built-ins aren't built, er, in yet. 
Nor does it (yet) support any of cwm.py's cmd line interface. 
It does have a REPL, though. 
A partial one, at least. 
bijan: It can handle rules12.n3, which isn't too shabby. 
bijan: Performance looks pretty good, thus far. 
Parsing is a bit slow, and using rdf_db.pl 
to write each result (even when filtering) isn't very speedy, but you can construct very fast Prolog queries against the n3 store. 
danbri_: Very cool! 
But have you considered rewriting this in Python? 
bijan: No. AaronSw: Sean has something similar in Python, though. 
bijan: Well, GEEZ, TBL has something similar in Python too! 
AaronSw: Silly bijan, his isn't a CLONE! 
bijan: Annoying Aaron, the original is similar to its clones. 
bijan: WOOHOO! 
Just got a hand-compiled, builtin-using rule to work. 
bijan: Still havn't a clue about existential quantification... Dan Connolly, W3C http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/ mobile: mailto:connolly+pager@w3.org 
Yes, it is linked from http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/doc/cwm.html Oh, I see you added something else too.
