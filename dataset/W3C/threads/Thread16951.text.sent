Dear All, I found this interesting Website accessibility poll on: Apologies now in case this page is not accessible - it's just that the results are very interesting and I would be happy to send an update to the list later on with the final results so we can all benefit from it.

The poll is halfway down on the right hand side of the page. 
Sorry, the page was designed by a person with idea on usability. 
A perennial portal problem... 
The poll is just visible without scrolling down, underneath the Internet Works magazine image. 
Are you viewing in graphics browser? 
Does anyone need better directions? 
Where exactly? 
VirusChecked by the Incepta Group plc Yes, please, an update to the list of the data would be beneficial to us who do not maintain the same browsers or have the same capabilities as those who coded that very, very interesting albeit ironic poll. 
So far, the poll results say that 47% of the participants have no idea how to even make their site accessible, or what it means. 
That's just wonderful news. 
Randal Where exactly? 
It was indeed interesting - I can't get at the results either with Opera or Lynx.

That's rather ironic considering the question. 
Tom Gilder Answers have gotten better. 
Web Site Accessibility Is your Web site accessible to the disabled? 
percent 1.) Yes 22% 2.) No - but it will be within the next 12 months 15% 3.) No - and I can't see the point of doing so 16% 4.) No - it would be too difficult to do 6% 5.) Not sure - How do I do it? 
41% Wonder how many of those have actually checked it, and aren't guessing (it might have been swayed by it being posted here, though)? 
:) Tom Gilder is there any way to find out how many people have voted?

Maybe if the site responds, he'll forward the answer to the list. 
Regards, Andy And that person is still waiting to hear from the Webmaster. 
I would also like to apologise for not posting the final results but Internet problems prevented me from accessing the site... that was my end of things and not the site that was having problems. 
I will email again today and see if I can get an answer for the list. 
Further apologies for those who could not access the poll, but I think that this is often typical of sites that run articles or polls on accessibility, and a complaint has been logged with the site. 
Kind regards Simon -----Original Message----- Somebody on the list emailed the website yesterday to find out.
