<s> and is nothing to do with linking (except insofar as EVERYTHING is to do with linking) I have received what I suspect will be the first of many questions from a well known user of SGML, the gist of which might be summed up as "Why on earth is XML the way it is?" (Specifically, this person hadn't understood the nittygritty of the empty-tag-kludge, was baffled by the white space rules -- particulary the -XML-Space attribute kludge, and wanted to use SDATA entities).  </s>
<s> I answered these enquiries to the best of my poor abilities and suggested he should seek wider discussion on the comp.text.sgml  </s>
<s> list.  </s>
<s> Is there a better place such enquiries should be referred to?  </s>
<s> Is the XML Q&amp;A  </s>
<s> document or an expansion of it available at a web site somewhere?  </s>
<s> Am I right in  </s>
<s> assuming that this list does *not* want to consume even more bandwidth fielding  </s>
<s> queries about done deals than it already has on procedural rules?  </s>
<s> Sorry to interrupt the discussion on link semantics (which is really impressive, by the way) Lou Burnard p.s. I have now updated my TEI x-pointer tutorial, following some useful suggestions from Eliot, Michael, and Hasse.  </s>
<s> The new version is at momentarily) Feel free to link to it at the new address if you want.  </s>

<s> No, comp.text.sgml is the only place at the moment.  </s>
<s> If you mean the Q&amp;A that I passed out at SGML 96, no.  </s>
<s> That was designed for SGML insiders and not something that I would want to make generally visible.  </s>
<s> Someone on this list would be doing a tremendous service if s/he would volunteer to start an XML faq.  </s>
<s> Yes! Jon  </s>
<s> I think we need an XML public discussion list, at least for a while.  </s>
<s> I think this has worked well for the TEI.  </s>
<s> I'm not sure when such a thing should start though.  </s>
<s> Once it has, every piece of XML literature needs to have the address blazoned on it though.  </s>
<s> That Q&amp;A from the conference was excellent and should certainly be on the web.  </s>
<s> This list is not the place.  </s>
<s> I don't know about the rest of you, but I've dropped comp.text.sgml,  </s>
