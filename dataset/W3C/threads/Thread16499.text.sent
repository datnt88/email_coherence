Does anyone have any tips for making PowerPoint presentations accessible on the Web? 
I know the stuff generated by the "save as HTML" feature in 2000 needs tweaking, but it doesn't seem to be in a format I can edit. 
This is what we are doing (for now).

i make the original ppt file available for downloading, but since not everybody uses / can afford / wants a bloatware product like ppt, and because 'save as webpage' turns what is mainly text into inaccessible graphics, i always produce a clean html version of it manually.

This would be another way to have accessible PowerPoint. 
The tool is available at http://www.rehab.uiuc.edu/ppt/. 
Here's what he says there. 
This Power Point Accessibility Wizard offers an alternative to PowerPoint's Web publishing feature. 
The standard Power Point Web Publishing option creates XML based web content that can only be used by Microsoft Internet Explorer. 
Even if non-XML options are selected, users cannot easily add information that is required for accessibility. 
This Power Point Accessibility Wizard simplifies the task of converting PowerPoint presentations to text pure HTML through an easy- to-use user interface, and automates much of the conversion of Power Point Presentations to an HTML format that includes required accessibility information.
