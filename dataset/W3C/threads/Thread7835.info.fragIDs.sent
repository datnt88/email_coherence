<s> Dear all, We have collected some network traces and have problems to interpret them.  </s>
<s> Perhaps you fellow WebDavers can provide us a helping hand:  </s>
<s> - Server response 1 adds some extra information after the XML body and does not add a content length attribute.  </s>
<s> How should/could one handle this?  </s>
<s> What does the "Trailer:" HTTP response attribute mean?  </s>
<s> (R1)  </s>
<s> - Are the DAV: properties within the XML body all valid (e.g. contentclass, nosubs, id, objectcount, isstructureddocument, uid, visiblecount and many  </s>
<s> more) or in what IETF document can they be found?  </s>
<s> (R1 and R2)  </s>
<s> - What does the xml: namespace have as valid properties and how are they related to DAV? (e.g. xml:v) (R1 and R2)  </s>
<s> - Where can we find a definition how to parse tags like DAV:ishidden b:dt="boolean" ?  </s>
<s> (R1)  </s>
<s> - Is it good behaviour to add so many additional namespaces, which obviously extend the original DAV protocol definition?  </s>
<s> (R2)  </s>
<s> - Should one mix different namespaces like in DAV:childcount b:dt="int" 13 /DAV:childcount (R2)  </s>

<s> These appear to all be server-defined, and hence implementation-specific properties.  </s>
<s> However, since there is no publically available place where these properties are defined, it creates an interoperability problem for you.  </s>
<s> We have an activity to create a procedure for registering new properties, so that there will be a public repository of property definitions.  </s>
<s> Having now personally experienced the need for such a registration procedure, I'm hoping you'll feel motivated to contribute to this effort.  </s>
<s> I've been contacted by Dennis Hamilton, who is planning on taking the lead on this activity (I'm hoping to see an I-D from him in the near future).  </s>
<s> The ishidden property is defined in: 00.txt But, this is just an I-D, and is not normative.  </s>
<s> In an ideal world, Microsoft wouldn't have used the DAV: namespace for these properties until the WG agreed.  </s>
<s> Details on when to use the DAV: namespace should be part of the registration procedures document.  </s>
<s> Based on my recollection, this is allowed by the XML namespaces document.  </s>
