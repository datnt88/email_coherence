Content negotiation and links to alt versions Issue raised by: Nir Dagan - 17 March 1998 I think one should use both content negotiation and include links to alternative versions. 
Content negotiation determines the default format served, but: a user may prefer French to English, but may still prefer to have access to both versions. 
User agents may not support content negotiation well and the format served to the user may be not the optimal one. 
Resolutions None at this time.

I agree with Nir - content negotiotiation is the best strategy for working out what is desired, but there also needs to be an explicit way of doing this in the web content - some people are unable to configure either their server or client, others may need to swap content types frequently. 
This is the sort of question that is brought up by negotiated delivery of the type that Scott Luebking talked about a lot recently - without being able to know what the options are users may be left in the dark, missing what is in fact available.

Hi, Yes, I also think using both the content negotiation mechanism and explicity links is preferable. 
There was some discussion on this issue last year.
