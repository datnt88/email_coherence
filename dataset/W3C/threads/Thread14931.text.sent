TO:w3c-wai-gl@w3.org When using accesskeys I have always stuck to the numbers zero through to nine - the reason being that the other ascii keys are used with the Alt key (or Apple key on Macs) in various instances. 
Perhaps we should include this in the guidelines? 
Gian All. 
A further query and item for discussion. 
Excluding the provision of a separate page with a list of accesskeys, how do you highlight the fact that keyboard accesskey shortcuts are available without making dramatic changes to a page. 
An example: I have seen one way to indicate to users that there is a keyboard shortcut combination. 
Place some text on the page explaining the alt-combination shortcuts, and also underline the respective character in the text of the label. 
What are your thoughts on the following example of underlining characters. 
... span style="text-decoration: underline; U /span sername... 
This is, of course, visual, and not descriptive to a screen reader user. 
So there are problems with doing this without non-visual equivalents. 
It would also be a problem with links, as link text is supposed to be underlined. 
Maybe you could use a bolded character instead of an underlined character? 
What do you all think? 
Cheers.

I have always included the accesskey as part of the alt text of an image. 
See www.visionaustralia.org.au. 
For accesskeys used in forms I have always included the information about accesskeys in the introductory text at the beginning of the form. 
that sounds sensable. 
However there are two issues: 1. Do the numbers 1 to 9 have any conceptual relationship to the actual form control meaning. 
2. How do you indicate to users what the accessskeys are, and what form fields they are being used for without making the page look very different.

Mat Mirabella Telstra Research 03 9253 6712 This shouldn't go in the guidelines as a permamnent requirement. 
But until more browsers are smarter about adapting the accesskeys to their own capabilities it is a useful technique - they are certainly the most widely available keys. 
For browsers that do a reasonable job of accesskeys there are plenty more though - and it is possible to implement accesskeys in a way that makes tsomething available for the user to find out what they are, and be able to use any control that has an accesskey assigned without having to restrict them this far - there is a lot of value in having mnemonic accesskeys, and as someone who uses them a lot (in iCab, where it is just the key with no alt or ctrl or whatever) I appreciate the functionality.

I have always shown that accesskeys are available by including them in the alt text of an image (that is a link) and including them in the title attribute of text links. 
For accesskeys in forms I have always specified what accesskeys are what in the introductory information at the beginning of the form.

I like the practice of providing somewhere (e.g. via a link, or the way that it is done by accesskeys - the major problem for blind users in particular is that by the time they have scanned all the links to find the acceskeys they don't need to have known them unless they keep coming back, whereas fora visual user this kind of presentation is often fine.
