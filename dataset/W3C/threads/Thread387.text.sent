Hi All Below are text from two BATCH files, then some comments, I'm not sure if I would pass the Microsoft batch file exam, but these files do work for me. 
================= run_tidy.bat 
============================== check_it fileName html rem check_it space FILENAME space EXTENSION ==================== check_it.bat 
========================== find /v /n "" %1.%2  %1-%2_num.txt 
copy %1.%2 oldver.htm 
tidy.exe -f %1-%2_notes.txt 
-modify %1.%2 copy %1.%2 new_%1.%2 
copy oldver.htm 
%1.%2 del oldver.htm 
===================== comments ============================= To run this as you would need of course "TIDY.EXE" also "RUN_TIDY.BAT" 
&amp; "CHECK_IT.BAT" also the file to be checked, it might be "NEW.HTML" 
To make the batch files you would need to make two text files with "note pad" copy &amp; paste the text given above save the work and change the file name to the two batch file names given. 
"RUN_TIDY.BAT" 
&amp; "CHECK_IT.BAT" 
BEFORE YOU START Edit the RUN_TIDY batch file and replace "fileName" with the name of your file like NEW ( you might also have to change HTML to HTM ) TO START Click onto the file "RUN_TIDY.BAT" 
WHAT HAPPENS WHILE YOU WAIT "RUN_TIDY.BAT will run the batch file "CHECK_IT.BAT" from the text given it will make %1= fileName and %2=HTML As it is running "CHECK_IT.BAT" 
A file called "fileName-html_num.txt" 
Then it copies "fileName.html" 
to "oldver.htm" 
Then it runs tidy &amp; makes notes to file called "fileName-html_notes.txt" &amp; fixes errors and modifies "fileName.html" 
Then it copies you modified version to "new_fileName.html" 
Then it copies your original html file back to your original "fileName.html" 
Then it deletes the file it made called "oldver.htm" 
NOTE The reason it makes a text file with numbered lines is if you are a computer that does not have a HTML editor. 
======================== Question ============================= Is there some other and better way maybe with click-on style "buttons" to change TIDY options easer? 
It would be great if TIDY printed to file the whole line that had any errors on it, From Eric You may want to try out some of the HTML editing tools that include Tidy along with dialog boxes for configuring it. 
Check the Tidy home page for links. 
I probably am misunderstanding you, but Tidy does already offer you the means to write errors to a file ( -f filename ) Regards, -- Dave Raggett dsr@w3.org
