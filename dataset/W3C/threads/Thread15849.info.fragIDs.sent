<s> ANNOUNCING WebMetrics 1.0 From the National Institute of Standards and Technology Free software at http://www.nist.gov/webmetrics  </s>
<s> NIST is pleased to announce that Release 1.0 of the WebMetrics Tool Suite is now available.  </s>
<s> The WebMetrics project is focused on providing tools to help with rapid, remote, and automated usability testing and evaluation of web sites.  </s>
<s> Please feel free to send out our url to others as appropriate and link to our web site.  </s>
<s> If you are using our tools, please contact us about participating in the collection of case study data to help validate our tools.  </s>
<s> We need your feedback!  </s>
<s> Please send your comments, bug reports, and questions to webmetrics@nist.gov.  </s>
<s> Here is an informal description of these tools.  </s>
<s> All run on Unix, Windows NT, and Windows 95. o The Web Static Analyizer Tool (WebSAT) checks the html of a Web page against numerous guidelines.  </s>
<s> The output from WebSAT identifies potential usability problems which should be investigated through further user testing.  </s>
<s> WebSAT can be executed from any web browser or downloaded to accommodate those behind firewalls.  </s>
<s> o The Web Category Analysis Tool (WebCAT) helps the usability engineer quickly construct and conduct a simple category analysis across the web.  </s>
<s> WebCAT should be downloaded and installed on your web server for local storage of your result files.  </s>
<s> Examples of WebCAT are available on the web site.  </s>
<s> o The Web Visual Instrumenter Program (WebVIP) helps the usability engineer rapidly instrument a web site for local or remote testing by employing visual instrumenting as well as automated techniques.  </s>
<s> WebVIP must be downloaded and installed on your web server before it can be run.  </s>
