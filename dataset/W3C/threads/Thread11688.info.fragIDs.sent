<s> Dir sir, As you may know, my company is publising an Antenna House XSL Formatter (that is XSL FO processor).  </s>
<s> And we plan to hold the first XSL School (one day seminor) on June 6, 2001 in TOKYO, Japan.  </s>
<s> We are now preparing tutorials mainly on XSL formatting objects in Japanese for the seminor.  </s>
<s> To explain on XSL in Japanese, we need Japanese translation of the specification of "Extensible Stylesheet Language" Candidate Reccomendation, published on 21 November 2000.  </s>
<s> The XSL specification is too long to translate it wholly into Japanese by ourself.  </s>
<s> But there seems to be no other organizations or persons who are willing to translate the specification into Japanese.  </s>
<s> Is it OK to translate partially the XSL specification into Japanese, and to refer to the translated material from our tutorial?  </s>
<s> May we summarize, in behalf of translation, the some part of the XSL Specification that seems to us unimportant for users of XSL Formatter?  </s>
<s> I am awaiting your reply, Tokushige Kobayashi President Antenna House, Inc. koba@antenna.co.jp  </s>
<s> This school?  </s>

<s> Partial translation should be OK, so long as you follow the requirements described in 5.6 of the W3C Intellectual Property FAQ, at:  </s>
<s> It sounds similar to annotation.  </s>
<s> 5.8 of the W3C Intellectual Property FAQ might be relevant in this case.  </s>
<s> I think so long as those summarized parts are clearly represented as such, i.e. clearly distinguishable that those are not literal translations but summaries, that should be OK.  </s>
<s> Regards, Masayasu Ishikawa / mimasa@w3.org  </s>

<s> Dear Mr. Kobayashi, Many thanks for your effort to start translation of the XSL specification.  </s>
<s> I agree with Masayasu that it is okay to make a partial translation.  </s>
<s> As a volunteer effort, and for a large spec, this is the best way to work towards an eventual complete translation.  </s>
<s> Other volunteers could contribute missing parts.  </s>
<s> In addition to the requirements in the W3C Intellectual Property FAQ, please make sure that you clearly say that it is a partial translation, and that it is clear which parts are translated, and which parts are missing.  </s>
<s> Yes. The summaries could either be in a separate document, or could stand in for those parts that are not yet translated fully.  </s>
<s> Later, somebody could replace them with the actual translations.  </s>
<s> Many thanks again and kind regards, Martin.  </s>
