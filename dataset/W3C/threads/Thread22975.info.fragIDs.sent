<s> Regarding the Core L1 recommendation: The third paragraph of the Interface Element section reads: "Elements may have attributes associated with them; since the Element interface inherits from Node, the generic Node interface method getAttributes may be used to retrieve the set of all attributes for an element."  </s>
<s> I don't believe there is a getAttributes method in the Node interface.  </s>
<s> As long as I'm being anal, here are two typos: The second paragraph of Interface Document reads: "...The Node objects created have a ownerDocument attribute..."  </s>
<s> I believe that should read "...an ownerDocuement..."?  </s>
<s> From Interface Node, Method replaceChild, Exception HIERARCHY_REQUEST_ERR reads: "...of the newChild node, or it the node to put in is one of this node's ancestors."  </s>
<s> I believe this should read "...or if the node..."?  </s>
<s> I'm desperately trying to dig up relavent reasons to post before I bombard you with my OT implementation questions :~P Mike  </s>
<s> There is an attribute attributes on the Node interface, readonly attribute NamedNodeMap attributes; In some language bindings (e.g. Java) this will be translated into  </s>
<s> getAttributes.  </s>
<s> Why it is defined on Node and not Element is another  </s>
<s> question.  </s>
<s> I suppose the text you mention should read "Elements may have attributes associated with them; since the Element interface inherits from Node, the readonly attribute attributes on the Node interface method may be used to retrieve the set of all attributes for an element."  </s>
<s> Must... resist.... temptation....  </s>
<s> Kind regards, --Sander.  </s>
<s> Why? Oh my, is "a" correct here?  </s>
<s> I thought "an" was used with vowels .. aeiOu so ... "an"???  </s>
<s> I must admit my native language is Java and c, not english :-P Mike  </s>
<s> Good catch; that should be rephrased slightly.  </s>
<s> There is an "attributes" IDL attribute.  </s>
<s> Most language bindings will probably implement that as a pair of accessor methods (getAttributes and setAttributes), but the spec should cite the IDL instead.  </s>

<s> Very deliberate.  </s>
<s> We wanted the DOM to be fully operable without requiring that folks downcast from Node.  </s>
<s> Casts are surprisingly expensive in some environments, and can be a distraction even when they aren't.  </s>
<s> In theory, if you have Node, NodeList, and NamedNodeMap you can retrieve or  </s>
<s> modify anything in your main document tree.  </s>
<s> I've seen some minimalist subsets of the DOM built on that basis.  </s>
<s> Of course they weren't DOM-compliant, but they _were_ DOM-compatable; anything that worked on them would work on a "real" DOM, though of course the reverse isn't true.  </s>
<s> (Is it worth adding this to the FAQ, is it documented in our design principles somewhere, or is it unnecessary trivia?)  </s>
<s> Joe Kesselman / IBM Research  </s>
<s> Ahh, I did not now this.  </s>
<s> Of course to really be able to modify anything you also need Document (to create new nodes).  </s>
<s> But it is good to know this, thanks.  </s>
<s> Too bad for the convenience attribute Node.childNodes, otherwise it could have been done with one interface less...  </s>
<s> I would add it somewhere, perhaps also saying why readonly attributes publicId and systemId are excluded from this three-interface completeness (plus DocumentType.internalSubset, plus Entity.notationName).  </s>
<s> This is probably because they are 'extended interfaces', but how about Attr.specified?  </s>
<s> Kind regards, --Sander.  </s>
