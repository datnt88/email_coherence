Folks, We need to get some of the outstanding test cases reviewed. 
Please can you take a look at pick you favourite unreviewed tests and volunteer to review them, preferably by Friday. 
Jan: is there a difference between PENDING and UNAPPROVED? 
Brian I have reviewed rdfms-xmllang/test001-test005 and believe they are correct. 
However I am unsure about test006 -- I'd have to do some more careful spec reading to be sure. 
The W3C Validator (ARP) and CARA disagree, although the former may simply have not been updated to support language codes. 
DaveB, could you make two more test cases like test006, but with parseType-and-xml:lang and just parseType? 
I think these would be useful.

Aaron Swartz said: Jeremy has noted a couple of times that the validator needs updating to match more recent RDF Core decisions. 
I'm not sure I understand what you mean. 
test005/test006 tests property attributes without/with xml:lang. 
parseType can't be used in that situation. 
test001 and test002 are the parseType without/with xml:lang for property elements. 
Dave No, except that I've been using "PENDING" because it sounds like a more positive active kind of adjective :-) If test cases are rejected then I'll explicitly record them as "REJECTED" and include a pointer to the decision/discussion.

If it's broken really badly - don't fix it either. 
OK, I've been through all the outstanding cases - my comments are below. 
I don't think that any are wrong, but I've raised comments in some cases. 
-- I agree with the UTF-8 mapping &amp;#xFC; -- %C3%BC -- Does agreement on this transform depend on current IRI debates (I've lost track)? 
If we are agreed to have all URIs in the graph use just URI-character-sequences then I think this is right. 
-- Looks OK to me. 
-- Looks OK to me, but I'm not sure what it's meant to demonstrate. 
-- Did we agree xml"foo" as the form for XML literals in N-triples? 
If so, it looks OK to me. 
-- ditto regarding xml"chat"-fr -- Looks OK to me. 
-- ditto regarding "chat"-fr -- Looks OK to me. 
-- Interesting case (i.e. good test case!): does xml:lang apply to attributes of the element to which it is applied? 
XML says yes, but that means that the language applies to multiple RDF properties specified as attributes. 
I think that's all OK. -- I agree with this (rdf:aboutEach is now an error). 
Does the group? 
-- ditto -- I agree with this. -- I agree with this. -- I agree with this. -- I agree with this. 
(It would help if the test file contained its URL) -- I agree with this. -- Hmmm... I agree that it should be allowed as legal RDF, but is there a case for producing a warning is repeated rdf:_n properties are used? 
-- I agree with this. -- I agree with this. 
But don't these cases duplicate xmllang tests? 
Does it matter? 
-- I agree with this. 
(I never noticed xml:space before!) (Should there be additional test cases with multiple consecutive whitespace and leading/trailing whitespace with and without the xml:space='preserve' attribute?) -- I agree with this. -- I agree with this. -- I agree with this. -- I agree with this, but can't see what it's supposed to be testing. 
Also there appears to be some filename confusion with the RDFS entailment tests. 
-- I agree with this, and note there appears to be continuing filename confusion. 
-- I agree with this. -- I agree with this. 
#g Graham Klyne given On 7th December 2001, the RDFCore WG decided to remove rdf:aboutEach from the RDF specification. 
]] -- http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-abouteach this testcase should be OK also given On 1st June 2001, the WG decided that aboutEachPrefix would be removed from the RDF Model and Syntax Recommendation on the grounds that there is a lack of implementation experience, and it therefore should not be in the recommendation. 
A future version of RDF may consider support for this feature. 
]] -- http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-abouteachprefix this testcase should be OK as well I agree with this one as well only that the MT speaks about rdfs:member as does the http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/ so an update is in order I think Also tests. 
looking at the main point is actually the "Positive RDFS-Entailment test" and the "Positive parser tests" are not testing this specific issue I think the whole idea should be to approve my recollection is that we have approved this one and that DanC and PatH agreed for the issue I have done i.e. 4 positive and 2 negative entailment tests this is indeed RDFS and OWL entailment (in our original etc mode) and I didn't know how to testcase this issue otherwise Jos De Roo, AGFA http://www.agfa.com/w3c/jdroo/
