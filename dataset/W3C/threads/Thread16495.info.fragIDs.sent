<s> I created a page to see how screen readers work with alternative text in a Java applet (www.webaim.org/tutorials/uofa/java/news_good.htm).  </s>

<s> A further test of the applet using object tags instead of applet tags (www.webaim.org/tutorials/uofa/java/news_good2.htm) showed the HPR 3.0 does read the content between the object tag.  </s>
<s> Does HPR 3.0 no longer support the deprecated applet tag?  </s>
<s> I suggest you use the HPR mailing list for the question you are asking about HPR.  </s>
<s> You subscribe to the list by sending a note to requests@talklist.com, and the body of the note should say "subscribe ibm-hpr yourName" without any quotes and filling in yourname.  </s>
<s> Once you have done that you can send a note to ibm-hpr@talklist.com with your question.  </s>
