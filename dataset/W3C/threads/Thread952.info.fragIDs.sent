<s> Hi, I have been looking at jTidy for the last couple of days and notice there is a serious lack of activity there by anyone associated with the project (sourceforge.net/projects/jtidy).  </s>
<s> Does anyone here happen to know if jTidy is still being worked on?  </s>
<s> If so do you know if they are working on a port from tidyLib or from classic tidy?  </s>
<s> The java version of the library would be great to have as it seems the jTidy library currently doesn't do a great job.  </s>
<s> Any information any of you have on the status of the jTidy project would be helpful.  </s>
<s> I have already looked at their forums and there are no answers to questions similar to this one there.  </s>
<s> The jTidy webpage suggests using this mailing list for further info.  </s>
<s> Thanks  </s>
<s> I imagine the answer to all of these questions is - "nobody knows" or  </s>
<s> "nothing is happening with jtidy" but I figured i shoud at least ask.  </s>
<s> Thanks in advance, Bill  </s>
<s> That's at least my answer; I suggest to contact the project developers for more information.  </s>
<s> I missed the original post but atleast one person is working with jtidy.  </s>
<s> I ported it to j# in .net  </s>
<s> (which was suprisingly easy - very few changes) so that I could use tidy on ISPs that didn't allow registration of DLLs (which is how TidyCOM is implemented) - it's also a cleaner implementaion in .NET  </s>
<s> architecture.  </s>
<s> It hasn't been extensively tested yet so I didn't bring it up... but if you want the J# .NET project I could send it your way.  </s>
