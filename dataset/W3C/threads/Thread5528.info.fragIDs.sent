WSTF folks, We will not take time during today's meeting for you to look over all the documents during the meeting. 
For many of the topics, we will open them up for discussion and if no one raises issues, we will move on. 
Therefore, please review the files before the meeting and be prepared with issues. 
Attached is a rough draft of an image showing the proposed relationship between the guidelines, intro pages, and working group pages. 
Note that the diagram does _not_ show all the documents. 
The diagram is attached in several different formats (all attachments are the same diagram). 
Looking forward to talking about design in a few hours! 
Best, ~ Shawn
