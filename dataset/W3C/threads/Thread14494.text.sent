Wendy, After reading the description, I think I could fit the role well, but since my interest is primarily with the "cognitive, learning, and intellectual" disabilities, I feel I may be left out of discussions which should include these groups but which may not be originally apparent to those who raise issues. 
I'm catching up with about a week's worth of posts to this list this evening, and responded to one about a prototype (from Scott) in which I raise what I hope are succinct issues about the range of variations in disabilities which would lead to omissions in considerations if a "prototype" type of approach to guidelines is ever adopted. 
Anne Hello, The chairs and I have been discussing a "Reviewer" role for the working group. 
I thought that this had been discussed at one of the telecons, but I don't see it represented in any of the minutes since January. 
I have drafted a new "how to join" that includes information about the reviewer role. 
it is available at here is an excerpt: blockquote How to become a WCAG WG Reviewer We realize that many people are unable to commit 4 hours per week to a voluntary project. 
To encourage participation by a wide variety of people, we have created a "Reviewer" role for this working group. 
Reviewers will be sent materials for review based on their particular interests and expertise. 
These materials will have specific questions for the reviewer to consider. 
We anticipate that a reviewer could go for a couple of months without hearing from us or hear from us a couple times in one month depending on which issues are under discussion. 
Please fill out a request to join as suggested above along with the following information: [ ] I would like to join the working group as a Reviewer. 
My specific areas of interest are: [ ] Issues for people with visual disabilities [ ] Issues for people with cognitive, learning, and intellectual disabilities [ ] Issues for people with hearing disabilities [ ] Issues for people with physical disabilities [ ] Assistive technology [ ] Authoring Tools [ ] User Agents [ ] Graphic Design [ ] Non-W3C technologies (Flash, PDF, ECMA/JavaScript, Java, etc.) [ ] Usability testing [ ] Other. 
Please explain. 
/blockquote are there other specific areas of interest we ought to include in the list? 
do people agree that a reviewer role would be beneficial? 
should we more clearly define the commitment or expectations? 
other thoughts? 
questions? 
comments?

thanks, --wendy wendy a chisholm world wide web consortium web accessibility initiative madison, wi usa A reviewer role is extremely helpful. 
Although we did not formalise it in AU we had seveeral people who had agreed to act in such a way, and the UA group also put considerable effort into securing commitments to review from people who were not able to be full participants in the working group. 
It would seem that if someone's interest is in Authoring Tools or User Agents perhaps they should be encouraged to join the relevant working groups (or act as reviewers for those groups). 
I think that there is a need for the different groups to review each others' work (in particular AU has a very heavy dependency on WCAG) but I think that review needs to be done by members of the actual working group.

[etc] Charles, Your comment suggests that we should not include "Authoring Tools" and "User Agents" in the list of interests. 
I can understand that and agree to delete those two checks. 
however, I'm not clear if you support formalizing the role or not. 
--wendy wendy a chisholm world wide web consortium web accessibility initiative madison, wi usa I am not clear if I support formalising the role or not. 
Probably on balance I do - at least avertising that this is a useful way someone can contribute to the group without being a full participant is a good idea. 
As an alternative to deleting user agent and authoring tools as possible areas of interest it may be worth adding a note to the end of the list pointing out that for those areas there are other groups that can provide more direct engagement in the interest area, and that they also welcome reviewers (but we would need to discuss this across the relevant groups) Cheers Charles McCN Charles, Your comment suggests that we should not include "Authoring Tools" and "User Agents" in the list of interests.

People who don't want the list mail but are willing to be resources and be asked occasional questions might be able to so indicate, but this doesn't sound all that realistic to me. 
Ususally these people you have to chase; they don't step forward voluntarily. 
Al to in AU group people Agents (or act members telecons, but I think it is useful for a working group to maintain a list of people, companies or other entities they would invite to review working drafts at particular milestones (Last call, Candidate Rec). 
This takes soem work by people in the working group.
