<s> Hello, This morning, Jon and I discussed the current efforts of the Working Group [1] to identify min/max values for various speech synthesizer parameters: speech rate, pitch, gender, pitch range, stress, and richness.  </s>
<s> Jon made the point (as he has in email [2]) that values for various parameters are usually attained through communication between the user agent and the speech engine (which I take to be software, hardware, or both).  </s>
<s> Based on Jon's comments, I propose the following: 1) We do not put minimal requirements for speech parameters in the Guidelines, but instead state how the range of values for the parameters in question is determined.  </s>
<s> In Jon's email [2], for example, he lists the parameters available through the SAPI interface [3].  </s>
<s> (Is there HTML documentation for SAPI on the Web, or do I have to download software or a big document to read about the interface?)  </s>
<s> I do not have a proposal for how to express this communication, and welcome input from those versed in speech synthesizer technology.ww  </s>
<s> 2) We should put some example ranges in the Techniques document.  </s>
<s> Thus, the min/max range for speech rate of 100 to 700 words/minute would be listed in Techniques, as well as any other data people submit.  </s>
<s> 3) We refer developers also to CSS aural style sheets.  </s>

<s> The documentation for SAPI is available in HTML, but it is a part of the Software Development Kit (SDK)[1] as a local resource.  </s>
<s> There does not appear to be a similar resource for SAPI on the Web.  </s>
<s> The requirement should be to allow the user to user to set parameters anywhere with in the range of the synthesizer and that the user agent should provide information on the ranges available.  </s>

<s> I agree with Jon I think - the range of useful values is very very slow to very very fast.  </s>
<s> I think for accessibility it is a clear P1 that it can go slow enough, whatever that is, and I think it is probably an important P2 that it can go fast enough.  </s>
<s> I find, using the speech built into Macintosh, that it is slower than I would like for real efficiency, but it does allow me access to the content (and I am not accustomed to using it yet - I am aware that for an expert user it would be like having a 300 baud telephone line - posssible, but very unpleasant).  </s>
