<s> I've had a comment regarding the way Page Valet reports WCAG accessibility warnings.  </s>
<s> My correspondent[1] thinks it should  </s>
<s> mention any WCAG points that are untested, as this is how some other accessibility tools work and it makes Valet seems less complete[2].  </s>
<s> As it stands, Page Valet will generate warnings when it detects an error (or potential error).  </s>
<s> When it applies a test that is passed it says nothing.  </s>
<s> When it doesn't apply a test, it says nothing.  </s>
<s> Now the suggestion is that is should - conceptually - test every point in the WCAG.  </s>
<s> In cases like #14.1/etc that self-evidently can't be tested by any tool, it should issue a nag message - whatever page is being tested.  </s>
<s> Now, I have several reasons not to apply this kind of completeness.  </s>
<s> But maybe I'm missing the wider view.  </s>
<s> Comments, please, on: * Nag messages are a turnoff.  </s>
<s> If more than a couple of messages are repeated in every evaluation, users will rapidly learn to ignore them.  </s>
<s> * If we say that Valet should exhaustively list every point in WCAG, are we not saying that WCAG itself is the best test tool - and the only one that is never wrong?  </s>
<s> * Valet applies tests to every element and attribute, and displays messages in place in the source code.  </s>
<s> This is designed to make it more useful to its users: "there is an error right here" as opposed to "there is an error somewhere" Listing tests per-document is an entirely different approach.  </s>
<s> * Because Valet applies per-element tests, there are tests that are both applied and not applied.  </s>
<s> For example, #4.1/#4.3 (the lang attribute) is tested for the html element[3], but not for other elements.  </s>
<s> Yet to be exhaustive, we should test *every* element, lest it contain a passage in another language.  </s>
<s> For the tool to be manageable at all, it needs to make compromises.  </s>
<s> * Bottom line: too many nag warnings will dilute the overall message of the tests - like useful content getting buried in waffle or (in our times) spam.  </s>
<s> Now, one possible solution here is to retain the present scheme (modulo updates) for the human-readable HTML reports, but to include the additional nag messages in the machine-readable EARL reports so they get into databases populated by Valet (such as W3C's Annotea).  </s>
<s> [1] She reads this list, so she'll doubtless reply if I'm misrepresenting her.  </s>
<s> [2] Section508 testing does take this more legalistic nagging approach.  </s>
<s> That works because 508 is much briefer, and expressed in terms that are easier to incorporate into an automatic tool than WCAG.  </s>
<s> [3] The lang attribute for html shouldn't be necessary at all in the presence of an HTTP Content-Language header.  </s>
<s> But testing for it  </s>
<s> seems to be a requirement for any WCAG testing tool.  </s>

<s> The Content-Language entity-header field describes the natural  </s>

<s> Yes, the reference to an *Entity Header* is exactly that: it describes an entity.  </s>
<s> However, that is a very general case.  </s>
<s> My reference was to its use as a *Response Header*, which is more specific.  </s>
<s> That would be appropriate to a multipart entity, perhaps comprising  </s>
<s> multiple copies of a document in different languages.  </s>
<s> It's dealing with bundled collections, and perhaps with HTTP PUT transactions.  </s>
<s> It is not dealing with single HTML or XML documents, which is all either a web browser or Page Valet normally deals with.  </s>
<s> In an entity that is a single HTML page, it serves exactly the same purpose as the lang attribute to html .  </s>
<s> Nick Kew Site Valet - the mark of Quality on the Web.  </s>
<s> The English/Maori example seems very much to me to refer to a single page, but, for a concrete example, try: http://www.ocrat.com/biling/pridprej/chap0101.html (note that this Whilst this particular example has a bias towards English users, if you look at it without the automation features it could be used in the learning of either of the languages.  </s>
<s> Basically, the ability to use the HTTP Content-Language is a last resort default, not, I believe, a suggestion that that is the preferred method.  </s>
<s> If it were the preferred method, then including it with meta would have to be the de facto preferred method, given the difficult people seem to have with specifying charset with real headers.  </s>
<s> As such, it would seem to me a much more ugly solution (in my view, meta was largely added for bad reasons, and, in some cases has actually caused the atrophy of much more hyperlink like alternatives).  </s>
<s> Yeah, I think in a user interface it is helpful to be clear about what hasn't been tested - especially in something that is basically involved in testing.  </s>
