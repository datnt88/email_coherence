Can you inform me of the desired behaviour of importing a node that has event listeners associated with it. 
And while on this subject can you answer this same question for Document.adoptNode() in DOM Level 3 Cheers Pat The newly created (imported) nodes will start off with no listeners. 
The DOM has no way of knowing which listeners should or shouldn't be attached in the new document , and some might actually cause aplication malfunctions if they were bound to the new nodes, so we leave this for the user to deal with. 
There has been discussion of trying to invent a callback scheme where each listener could say what it wants done in this situation,but I think we decided it was becoming overly baroque. 
Good quesiton. 
adoptNode() is intended to really move the node object from one document to another (in those situations where the DOM can do so without destroying its internal datastructures). 
One can argue that this means the listeners should remain attached. 
But I don't know if we've made a formal decision on that. 
Joe Kesselman / IBM Research [joe already replied to that question] Good point. 
We decided to not remove the listeners from the Node since we didn't see any technical argument to not do so: When a Node is adopted using the adoptNode method the EventListeners attached to the source Node stay attached to the adopted Node.
