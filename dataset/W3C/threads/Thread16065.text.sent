Today I went to the home page of the Web Accessibility Initiative (http://www.w3.org/wai) in search of some key reference and proposed documents concerning accessibility. 
I tried to find what is the most accessible reading format for me and many other blind people: complete, plain text files with a line length less than 80 characters. 
Unfortunately, I was generally not successful after much browsing of the site. 
Most of what I sought was available only as a series of HTML pages, requiring one to produce a rendered text version of each page and then arrange them sequentially in order to have a complete text to read, browse or search. 
Therefore, I would appreciate it if anyone can provide web addresses for complete, current, plain texts of the following documents: HTML 4 specification CSS2 specification SMIL 1 specification DOM 1 specification Page authoring guidelines User agent guidelines Browser guidelines I also encourage the W3C to regularly make complete plain text available as a standard format option for key public documents. 
Thanks, Jamal Good points! 
I am reminded that plain text is not optimal for hard copy braille or audio renderings. 
I do maintain that plain text is superior for universal accessibility over any other single format. 
In addition, I submit that this accessible format is also optimal for a lot of people, including folks like myself who like to read with our favorite reading utility, rather than a viewer that was not designed as a reading program for someone with a print disability. 
I also see that a format with a markup language can offer more structured navigation through a document. 
Eventually, I hope to have an HTML viewer that lets me navigate and edit text as easily as my favorite DOS tools (Talking Directory and WordPerfect Editor). 
Until this happens, however, I'll probably continue to use this plain text based reading environment that I find highly productive compared with other options of which I am aware. 
With help from others on this list, I have been able to find most, though not all, of the documents I was seeking in plain text. 
I am still looking for a complete, current version of the SMIL specification and the page authoring guidelines. 
I can produce these myself with a conversion utility, so am mentioning their abscence as a point of information, accounting for all the documents I was seeking. 
As a plain text formatting suggestion, let me encourage the flowing of paragraphs such that not more than 80 characters are output per line. 
This enables someone reading online to continuously scroll downward through the text, without losing information on lines that were too long to display on conventional 80 column text terminal dimensions. 
Most of the plain text documents I downloaded from the W3C had a maximum line length between 95 and 160 monospaced characters. 
Again, this is a minor formatting issue, but one I think is worth mentioning to anyone interested in producing high quality plain text. 
If anyone else interested in W3C/WAI issues would consider promoting the development of a plain text recommended specification, let me know. 
I think it would be a standard worthy of attention by the W3C and its constituencies.

NThe main disadvantage of ASCII text (with no markup) is that all of Nthe structural and semantic distinctions conveyed by the HTML are Nlost. 
It is therefore important to emphasize that plain text is Nonly minimally accessible. 
For instance, if one wished to produce a Nproperly formatted braille copy, it would be necessary to Nre-introduce the markup codes. 
Similarly, audio formatting software Nsuch as AsteR and Emacspeak/W3 require markup in order to produce Nan efficient rendering of the document that conveys the necessary Nconceptual distinctions and allows for structured navigation. 
NWhile I agree that some ASCII text documents can be read easily by a Ntraditional screen reader, it is important to be careful in Nensuring that Net-Tamer V 1.11.1 - Registered Actually, HTML is better because it allows for embedding of structure and meta-content that doesn't exist in plain text. 
Granted, there's a problem right now in that some of the tools that exist now are designed only to work with plain text and not with HTML -- but I suspect this will change soon in the future.

Markup, in use, can become a cover for laziness in verbalizing the message. 
The tags may siphon information out of the text, not just add new information. 
Tags are a little like Cookies in creating a way for programs to talk behind the user's back, and possibly abuse this capability. 
The cross-linking between the WAI guidelines and related W3C documents is a major benefit. 
I don't mean to dispute the upside potential of hypertext and multimedia. 
But there is more to the way people trust plain text than tool obsolescence. 
Al A convention I've developed is to use a .asc 
extension standing for "ASCII document" for files with carriage return/line feed delimiters at the end of paragraphs but not lines. 
I use a .txt 
extension to denote a text file with such delimiters at the end of each line. 
This approach is consistent with the common convention of identifying a file format by its extension.
