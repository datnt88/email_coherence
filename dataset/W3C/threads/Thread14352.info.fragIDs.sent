There is another example of using positioning now in place at Also, I would say that yes, it is ok to use the sizes xx-small, x-small, etc - they are designed to be relative although it would be nice if it were easy to set their actual representation in a user agent - I think some of them allow this and some don't. 
In the first specification of these they came up with a particular set of suggested sizes, but it feels a bit like a "one-size-doesn't-really-fit-anyone" solution - the differences are too great for some people and too little for others.
