<s> As Gregg mentioned in yesterday's message titled: "NOTE Last look and comment before LAST CALL", we will enter the "last call review" stage very shortly (possibly today).  </s>
<s> We have made a commitment to advance the guidelines to the "Proposed Recommendation" stage by Mid May.  </s>
<s> To accomplish this we must hold a special conference call to finalize the document at the end of the last call review period.  </s>
<s> Therefore we must schedule a conference call to be held on either Monday, March 22, or Tuesday, March 23, 1999.  </s>
<s> I would like those of you who wish to participate in this special meeting to contact me as soon as possible and tell me which of the two dates (March 22 or 23) you prefer.  </s>
<s> If you have no preference, please say so.  </s>
<s> Unless I hear otherwise, I will assume that the meeting would be held at our regular time (4:00 PM Eastern Standard Time) since that seems to have worked reasonably well for the majority of participants.  </s>
<s> When I see a consensus, I will book the meeting and get back to the list.  </s>
<s> Regards, Chuck Letourneau WG Co-chair P.S. To get the ball rolling, I vote for Tuesday, March 23, because my flight home from CSUN doesn't get in until 5:30 PM on Monday, March 22.  </s>

<s> I vote for March 22 because 23 is my wedding anniversary.  </s>
<s> But it's not a very strong vote.  </s>
