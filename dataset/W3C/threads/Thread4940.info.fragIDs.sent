<s> F&amp;O [9] Functions of Durations, Dates, and Times The dateTime, date, and time component accessors are not very useful, as they always return the values for Z (UTC) rather than for the implicit timezone or some specified timezone.  </s>
<s> Thus for 12/31/2003 at 9am (Pacific) you get 2004 rather than 2003 as the year.  </s>
<s> This is because they are defined in terms of the XML Schema canonical forms, which are always in UTC (if a timezone is present at all).  </s>
<s> Similarly, we find the description of the operation of the functions in section 9.6 (adjusting to timezone) and hence their utility unclear, as results are shown with strings, none of which is the result of casting a date or dateTime to a string, as none is in canonical form.  </s>
<s> Given the nature of the component accessors, it is unclear what the benefit of adjusting the timezone might be.  </s>
<s> Many of the date/time/duration-related functions and operators are of very limited utility and add a great deal of implementation cost and user confusion.  </s>
<s> Suggest removing all the functions in section 9.4, as the ISO8601 time formats are readily parsable as strings, perhaps replacing them with functions to map dayTimeDuration and monthDayDurations to numeric values.  </s>
<s> Suggest removing all the functions in section 9.6 as well as the multiplication and division operators in section 9.5 as being of very marginal utility for the cost.  </s>
<s> The net effect would be substantial reduction in the number of functions that implementors must implement and that users must be aware of, with no substantial loss of functionality.  </s>
<s> If the dateTime and time component accessors are kept, then please add a parameter indicating which timezone the accessor should be applied to, or specify that the accessor should be performed relative to the implicit timezone, or specify that the component should be the value of the component in the underlying value space.  </s>
<s> If the timezone adjustment values are kept, it might be appropriate to define them as returning string values, or to define functions that will render dateTime, time, or date values as string values relative to some timezone (the underlying timezone component in the value space, the implicit timezone, or a timezone given as a parameter to the function).  </s>
<s> Mary: You may have missed the paragraph at the start of 9.4 that explains that the extraction functions, in fact, work on the localized value of dateTime etc. See below.  </s>
<s> "The extraction functions specified below extract a single component from a duration, date or time value.  </s>
<s> For xs:dateTime, xs:date and xs:time the localized value is used.  </s>
<s> To get the value of a component from the normalized value, the xs:dateTime, xs:date or xs:time must first be adjusted to UTC or timezone Z. This is illustrated in some of the examples in this section."  </s>
<s> The "adjustment" functions in 9.6 take a date/time in one timezone and return the identical instant in another timezone.  </s>
<s> I think this is useful and we have not had any comments recently that they be removed.  </s>
<s> As for the other date/time/duration functions, yes, there are a large number of them.  </s>
<s> We have had considerable discussion on them (before you were a member of the WG) and the content of the F&amp;O reflects the status quo.  </s>
<s> I'm reluctant to reopen this issue, or we will never get done!  </s>
<s> All the best, Ashok [mailto:public-qt-comments-request@w3.org]  </s>

<s> Apologies and I wishdraw that part of the comment.  </s>
<s> Much as I recognize that the WG has likely tread this ground heavily before I joined and understand a reluctance to go there, I remain unconvinced of the value of devoting 25% of F&amp;O to the various and sundry date functions, and I suspect a radical refactoring could simplify this part of the rec dramatically.  </s>
