<s> Here?s a first draft of section 3.1 of Authoring Techniques for XHTML &amp; HTML Internationalization: Please review it for the obvious (completeness, accuracy, readability, style), but also for use of terminology.  </s>

<s> Steve, Excellent start!  </s>
<s> Thanks for kicking us off.  </s>
<s> 1) I like the breakdown and organization.  </s>
<s> 2) I am not clear on what we expect the reader to know.  </s>
<s> Perhaps we should have a section at the top that says what we think the reader needs to know, and if not where to get it?  </s>
<s> Maybe that will be more evident in the context of the  </s>
<s> outline, but also, I am not expecting people will read this doc linearly.  </s>
<s> 3) Do we want to suggest utf-8, or instead Unicode with all its transforms, or perhaps be specific about utf-8, utf-16?  </s>
<s> 4) user agents- I wonder how we are going to establish the details on the UA.  </s>
<s> For example NS 4 has some support for Unicode, but doesn't work well with it in forms.  </s>
<s> Should we say it can display it but not post it?  </s>
<s> I think even its display is suspect.  </s>
<s> Doesnt support bidi I believe.  </s>
<s> For that matter, no UA supports all of Unicode.  </s>
<s> What do we mean when we say a UA supports Unicode?  </s>
<s> 5) re Step1: Perhaps instead of choosing an encoding based on text languages, we should break it into smaller steps.  </s>
<s> a) identify the scripts used in your text.  </s>
<s> b) identify the encodings supporting those scripts.  </s>
<s> Similarly, implementation complexity is a mouthful: c) identify the encodings that are supported by your publishing architecture (web server, database, source control system) d) identify the encodings supported by your authoring environment and tools e) I think I might lump considering the user agent requirements with these considerations.  </s>
<s> f) Identify the encodings supported by all these environments and tools and supporting the languages in the text.  </s>
<s> g) consider other factors such as performance and error-proneness of the encodings (examples code-switching or double-byte), perhaps the need for encoding conversions (difficulty, reliability of round-trip, etc.) Not sure I like all this detail I am proposing however.  </s>
<s> I throw it out for discussion.  </s>
<s> 6) multilingual is about languages and does not map onto encodings so well.  </s>
<s> 8859-1 is multilingual.  </s>
<s> Maybe we should use the term multiscript?  </s>
<s> (I just made that up.) 7) Should this section consider the languages that might be input (into a form)?  </s>
<s> In choosing an encoding, I should consider that my user might not have the same language(s) as my pages.  </s>

<s> Hello Steve, others, I just have a few comments to your draft, sorry to be late.  </s>
<s> They are mainly about terminology.  </s>
<s> I would suggest the following changes: 'page' - 'document' (this is standard W3C terminology) 'character set': If possible, avoid this term altogether 'page encoding' - 'character encoding' or 'character encoding of the document' Regards, Martin.  </s>
