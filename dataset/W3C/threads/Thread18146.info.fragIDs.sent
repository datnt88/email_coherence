<s> I've been looking at the UAAG last call for lynx (2.8.3 but my comments apply to lynx in general as a tty browser).  </s>
<s> Lynx only supports the Text "Content type label" (or let's say the claim I want to make is only for Text).  </s>
<s> It sounds, when reading 3.1, that I should be only looking at checkpoint: 3.3, 4.1, and 4.2 ?  </s>
<s> Later on in 3.3, it appears as if it's not the case.  </s>
<s> So please clarify in 3.1.  </s>
<s> In 3.3, it would good to have the list of "core" checkpoint listed explicitly, in fact, maybe they should be listed in 3.1 under "Generic" or "Core", to make clear that they are relevant when reading 3.1 labels.  </s>
<s> In 3.3, reading the "Unless" rule feels like a hack and makes me think that maybe there is matter for unification of the "Content type" model and these exception rules.  </s>
<s> Maybe it's just a bad/hack feeling and it's not possible in the timeframe you have.  </s>
<s> Same for the Keyboard rule "exception" in 3.3.  </s>
<s> In 3.5, why does the claim need to list the "checkpoints of the chosen conformance level considered not applicable".  </s>
<s> Is there any ambiguity when they don't ?  </s>
<s> (I guess yes and that's related to the lack of a unified model for Content-type).  </s>
<s> In 3.7 Conformance icons, the "must link" part should be qualified for Web content only, not for product packaging for instance (on paper).  </s>
<s> Now onto the checklist (P1 only) * Checkpoint 2.1 Make all content available through the user interface.  </s>
<s> So the process here is to first determine if this checkpoint is "content type label" specific, right ?  </s>
<s> So again, a list of all the core ones, or some annotation along the checkpoint text (like next to the priority level) of the content type or the coreness would be useful.  </s>
<s> Since I only want to claim availability of text content for lynx, I guess this one is satisfied.  </s>
<s> Is that right ?  </s>
<s> * Checkpoint 2.2 For a presentation that requires user input within a specified time interval, allow the user to configure the user agent to pause the presentation automatically and await user input before proceeding.  </s>
<s> Yes, lynx doesn't change it's content without user action.  </s>
<s> Well, in fact, I don't think it allows one to configure it, it just doesn't do it.  </s>
<s> * Checkpoint 2.3 Provide easy access to each equivalent and each equivalency target through at least one of the following mechanisms: (1) allowing configuration to render the equivalent instead of the equivalency target; (2) allowing configuration to render the equivalent in addition to the equivalency target; (3) allowing the user to select the equivalency target and then inspect its equivalents; (4) providing a direct link to the equivalent in content, just before or after the equivalency target in document order.  </s>
<s> Lynx, as it only supports text, doesn't really have this issue.  </s>
<s> * Checkpoint 2.4 Allow the user to specify that text transcripts, collated text transcripts, captions, and auditory descriptions be rendered at the same time as the associated audio and visual tracks.  </s>
<s> Respect author-specified synchronization cues during rendering.  </s>
<s> Not applicable (no multimedia supported).  </s>
<s> * Checkpoint 3.1 Allow the user to configure the user agent not to render background images.  </s>
<s> In this configuration, provide an option to alert the user when a background image is available but has not been rendered.  </s>
<s> Another one of the kind: doesn't render them anyway (just text, no image support).  </s>
<s> N/A ?  </s>
<s> * Checkpoint 3.2 Allow the user to configure the user agent not to render audio, video, or animated images except on explicit request from the user.  </s>
<s> In this configuration, provide an option to render a substitute placeholder in context for each unrendered source of audio, video, or animated image.  </s>
<s> When placeholders are rendered, allow the user to activate each placeholder individually and replace it with the original author-supplied content.  </s>
<s> (Techniques for 3.2) same * Checkpoint 3.3 Allow the user to configure the user agent to render animated or blinking text as motionless text.  </s>
<s> (Techniques for 3.3) not supported.  </s>
<s> * Checkpoint 3.4 Allow the user to configure the user agent to render blinking images as motionless images.  </s>
<s> (Techniques for 3.4) OK, I'll pass on the unsupported stuff from now on (image/audio/video). * Checkpoint 4.1 Allow the user to configure and control the reference size of rendered text with an option to override author-specified and user agent default sizes of rendered text.  </s>
<s> Make available the range of system font sizes.  </s>
<s> (Techniques for 4.1) In lynx, the font size/color etc, is controlled by the host terminal (say xterm in unix).  </s>
<s> So it that unsupported or satisfied ?  </s>
<s> * Checkpoint 4.2 Allow the user to configure the font family of all text, with an option to override author-specified, and user agent default, font families.  </s>
<s> Allow the user to select from among the range of system font families.  </s>
<s> (Techniques for 4.2) * Checkpoint 4.3 Allow the user to configure the foreground color of all text, with an option to override author-specified, and user agent default, foreground colors.  </s>
<s> Allow the user to select from among the range of system colors.  </s>
<s> (Techniques for 4.3) * Checkpoint 4.4 Allow the user to configure the background color of all text, with an option to override author-specified and user agent default background colors.  </s>
<s> Allow the user to select from among the range of system colors.  </s>
<s> (Techniques for 4.4) same as above * Checkpoint 6.1 Implement the accessibility features of all implemented specifications (markup languages, style sheet languages, metadata languages, graphics formats, etc.).  </s>
<s> The accessibility features of a specification are those identified as such and those that satisfy all of the requirements of the "Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0" [WCAG10].  </s>
<s> ouch!  </s>
<s> Lynx doesn't support half of the HTML4 stuff for table/longdesc/etc.  </s>
<s> * Checkpoint 8.1 Make available to the user the author-specified purpose of each table and the author-specified relationships among the table cells and headers.  </s>
<s> (Techniques for 8.1) nada * Checkpoint 1.4 Ensure that the user can interact with all active elements in a device-independent manner.  </s>
<s> If keyboard access is considered as the bottom line device-independent way in, sure.  </s>
<s> BTW this checkpoint makes little sense to me as a particular UA may be relevant to only one device channel, so asking it to support others is weird.  </s>
<s> * Checkpoint 1.5 Ensure that every message (e.g., prompt, alert, notification, etc.) that is a non-text element and is part of the user agent user interface has a text equivalent.  </s>
<s> (Techniques for 1.5) ok * Checkpoint 4.15 For user agents that support style sheets, allow the user to select from (and apply) available author and user style sheets or to ignore them.  </s>
<s> (Techniques for 4.15) ok for lynx but a note: why the "if CSS" form here and not the "if media", "if java" elsewhere ?  </s>
<s> * Checkpoint 4.16 Allow the user to configure how the selection is highlighted (e.g., foreground and background color, voice pitch, etc.).  </s>
<s> For graphical viewports, offer at least three rendering options, including colors and fonts.  </s>
<s> Allow the user to select from among the range of system colors and fonts.  </s>
<s> (Techniques for 4.16) done by the terminal for lynx * Checkpoint 4.17 Allow the user to configure how the content focus is highlighted (e.g., foreground and background color, voice pitch, etc.).  </s>
<s> For graphical viewports, offer at least three rendering options, including colors and fonts.  </s>
<s> For graphical viewports, allow the user to select from among the range of system colors and fonts.  </s>
<s> The default focus highlight mechanism must be different from the default selection highlight mechanism.  </s>
<s> Done by the terminal, but the part on the focus/selection being different kind of annoy me.  </s>
<s> It's the same and I'm not sure it's lynx problem or xterm problem... * Checkpoint 7.1 Allow the user to navigate among all viewports (including frames).  </s>
<s> (Techniques for 7.1) ok * Checkpoint 7.2 Associate a point of regard with each state in a viewport's browsing history and when the user returns to a state in the history, restore the associated point of regard.  </s>
<s> ok * Checkpoint 7.3 Allow the user to navigate all active elements.  </s>
<s> If the author has not specified a navigation order, allow at least forward sequential navigation of elements, in document order.  </s>
<s> (Techniques for 7.3) yes * Checkpoint 8.6 Implement selection, content focus, and user interface focus mechanisms.  </s>
<s> Implement them according to system conventions (per checkpoint 5.8).  </s>
<s> (Techniques for 8.6) ok * Checkpoint 8.7 Provide a mechanism for highlighting the current viewport, selection, and content focus.  </s>
<s> (Techniques for 8.7) * Checkpoint 9.1 Provide information to the user about current user preferences for input configurations (e.g., keyboard or voice bindings).  </s>
<s> (Techniques for 9.1) * Checkpoint 9.2 Avoid default input configurations that interfere with operating system accessibility conventions.  </s>
<s> (Techniques for 9.2) ok * Checkpoint 1.1 Ensure that every functionality available through the user interface is also available through every input API that is implemented by the user agent.  </s>
<s> This checkpoint does not require developers to reimplement the input methods associated with the keyboard, pointing device, voice, and other input APIs.  </s>
<s> (Techniques for 1.1) I don't think there's any input API other than the terminal keyboard, so OK ?  </s>
<s> * Checkpoint 1.2 Use the standard input and output APIs of the operating system.  </s>
<s> Do not bypass the standard output APIs when rendering information.  </s>
<s> (Techniques for 1.2) scanf() is standard API in C. * Checkpoint 1.3 Implement the operating system's standard API for the keyboard and ensure that every functionality available through the user interface is available through this API.  </s>
<s> (Techniques for 1.3) * Checkpoint 5.1 Provide programmatic read access to HTML and XML content by conforming to the W3C Document Object Model (DOM) Level 2 Core and HTML Specifications and exporting the interfaces they define.  </s>
<s> (Techniques for 5.1) ouch * Checkpoint 5.2 If the user can modify HTML and XML content through the user interface, provide the same functionality programmatically by conforming to the W3C Document Object Model (DOM) Level 2 Core and HTML Specifications and exporting the interfaces they define.  </s>
<s> (Techniques for 5.2) no DOM Why is there a "if CSS supported" and not a "if DOM supported" ?  </s>
<s> * Checkpoint 5.3 For markup languages other than HTML and XML, provide programmatic access to content using standard APIs (e.g., platform-independent APIs and standard APIs for the operating system).  </s>
<s> (Techniques for 5.3) na For Accessible Documentation (Priority 1) * Checkpoint 10.1 Ensure that at least one version of the product documentation conforms to at least Level Double-A of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 [WCAG10].  </s>
<s> (Techniques for 10.1) I quickly checked the online lynx doc at lynx.browser.org  </s>
<s> and it looks fine (AA that is) * Checkpoint 10.2 Document all user agent features that promote accessibility.  </s>
<s> (Techniques for 10.2) It's there somewhere I'm sure (that one of the main the purpose of this browser).  </s>
<s> * Checkpoint 10.3 Document the default input configuration (e.g., default keyboard bindings).  </s>
<s> (Techniques for 10.3) ok  </s>
<s> OK, so lynx do not get even A, because of lack of support for HTML4 stuff and lack of DOM support.  </s>

<s> Lynx doesn't have any way of dealing with dynamic Web content.  </s>
<s> It doesn't have a particularly good way of understanding information in a table (unless you add tablin to it).  </s>
<s> It has a few other problems as a browser.  </s>
<s> On the other hand it is a good indicator of whether a site meets a certain number of accessibility requirements.  </s>
<s> And happens to be the browser I use as an everyday browser - we choose between sets of problems when we choose browsers... Cheers Charles  </s>
