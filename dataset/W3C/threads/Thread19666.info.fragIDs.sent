Because there was no reaction at my first mail, i remail it: I succeded in installing, but got the following problem: If typing a big "S", a small "s" is inserted. 
Each of the other chars behaves oK, only the "S" fails. 
Running a lot of other X apps, i never found any problem with "S". 
Existing documents containing "S" display properly in amaya. 
Am i the only one to deal with this fault?

It's not easy for us to detect and solve a problem that doesn't occur on our 
platform. 
Could you check your xmodmap table and the amaya.keyboard 
file 
($HOME/amaya.keyboard or Thot/config/amaya.keyboard). 
I apologize, but I cannot do more to help you. 
Regards Irene. 
Thank you very much, the fault was there. 
The strange thing was that no other X application had problems. 
Seems to be that amaya is the only one to read it correctly. 
I apologize for suspecting amaya wrongly. 
Best regards, Ulrich Backes
