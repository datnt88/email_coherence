<s> Because there was no reaction at my first mail, i remail it: I succeded in installing, but got the following problem: If typing a big "S", a small "s" is inserted.  </s>
<s> Each of the other chars behaves oK, only the "S" fails.  </s>
<s> Running a lot of other X apps, i never found any problem with "S".  </s>
<s> Existing documents containing "S" display properly in amaya.  </s>
<s> Am i the only one to deal with this fault?  </s>
