<s> someone has brought to my attention that there is a debate on a packet encoding for content.  </s>
<s> Here are my comments:-  </s>
<s> 1) Boundary delimiters (like mime) These are absolutely, fundamentaly and irrevokably unacceptable.  </s>
<s> They  </s>
<s> require the originator to be precient is choice of boundary marker, they require the recipient to scan for them.  </s>
<s> Ad-hoc arguments resorting to MD5 and probablistic considerations  </s>
<s> carry no weight with me.  </s>
<s> In the first place there is a very strong probability that a persistent TCP/IP stream will be self referential, that is make a response based upon the low level encoding of the stream.  </s>
<s> Consider two people in a chat conversation debugging HTTP connections, At some point somone will incorporate the message boundary into a message and the system will come to a grinding halt.  </s>
<s> In the second place there is the processing overhead of scanning a live MPEG feed for a boundary delimeter.  </s>
<s> This is simply not the right thing.  </s>
<s> The only argument for the boundary strings I have heard is to simplify MAIL gateways.  </s>
<s> I don't accept the argument that one compromises a system for a minor simplification of backwards compatibility.  </s>
<s> If a gateway likes boundary delimeters it can easily convert.  </s>
<s> The email system is horribly compromised already by the numerous concessions it makes to broken MTAs.  </s>
<s> One more should not hurt.  </s>
<s> Do not ask the clean protocol to start making the same concessions by proxy.  </s>
<s> 2) On binary vs human readable.  </s>
<s> I prefer that a protocol be faithful unto itself.  </s>
<s> Either be human  </s>
<s> readable or let us lose with ASN.1 BER or something like it.  </s>
<s> There is no point in half measures one way or the other.  </s>
<s> If you must consider  </s>
<s> performance at this level use base 16.  </s>
<s> Base 10 is probably as efficient since there is not the upper/lowercase ambiguity.  </s>
<s> If you don't think this can be done well in an ascii based scheme please make that statement.  </s>
<s> We can then decide how to produce a generic scheme for employing binary encodings as MIME/RFC822 achieves for ascii, human readable encodings.  </s>
<s> Please do not attempt to create a hybrid that is neither one thing nor the other.  </s>
<s> If you are going to have an ascii based scheme there will be an overhead.  </s>
<s> I don't think its a very large one but it will exist.  </s>
<s> There are a number of binarry encodings with worse overhead, ASN.1 DER for example.  </s>
<s> 3) Encryption Please remeber that people will want to encode streams using block ciphers.  </s>
<s> This?requires provision for specifying the number of padding octets.  </s>
<s> Note that PEM style padding cannot be used since is creates a security problem when used for repeated numbers of small packets.  </s>
<s> It is essential that this padding be random bytes.  </s>
<s> 4) On a fixed upper limit on the packet size.  </s>
<s> This is not an acceptable proposal.  </s>
<s> Whatever size you chose I can  </s>
<s> provide examples where there is a very good need for a bigger size.  </s>
<s> Since history is littered with standards whose creators did not anticipate future needs I don't think we should make an arbitrary restriction which has no rational justification.  </s>
<s> I have just helped order a pair of machines with 512Mb of RAM, I have used file systems with a capacity of 6 Tb.  </s>
<s> I have built systems with a bandwidth of 6Tb/sec.  </s>
<s> 32 bits is simply not enough for these purposes.  </s>
<s> Experience demonstrates that to build a system for the future we must at least be able to satisfy the most exotic needs of the day.  </s>
<s> Self describing binary length encodings are simple enough.  </s>
<s> ASN.1 has one, one of the sensible suggestions in the original design that survived the committee cycle?  </s>
<s> ASN.1 has two legth encodings, short and long.  </s>
<s> The first octet defines the length of the length.  </s>
<s> If bit 7 is clear the length is encoded in a single octet a bits 0-6 of the first octet.  </s>
<s> Otherwise bits 0-6 give the number of additional octets the length.  </s>
<s> A perhaps cleaner way to do it combines the recycling unused bits in the lead octet idea with the fact that most lengths will be most conveniently expressed using 1, 2, 4 or 8 bytes.  </s>
<s> The decision table is as follows: IF Bit 7 clear, length is 1 octet, bits 0-6 give value Bit 6 clear, length is 2 octets, bits 0-5 give msb of value, octet 2 gives LSB Bit 5 clear, length is 4 octets, bits 0-4 give msb of value, octets 2-4 gives LSB Bit 4 clear, length is 8 octets, bits 0-3 give msb of value, octets 2-9 gives LSB TRUE these are reserved for future expansion.  </s>
<s> Of these points the last is the most critical.  </s>
<s> If the first is not accepted it will not be a significant disaster because I don't think the protocol would be used.  </s>
<s> If a scheme with a fixed length gains popularity it will be very hard to remedy it later on.  </s>
<s> Thus I would like names of any proponents of a fixed length scheme with their rationale.  </s>
<s> I promise faithfully to retain said list and produce it in a suitable forum (eg IETF conference dinner) for an "I told you so" speach.  </s>

<s> Yes, this makes sense.  </s>
<s> Inventing YApacketization scheme seems silly unless we really feel all existing ones are clearly unsuitable.  </s>
<s> ? Not sure what you're hinting at here...  </s>
<s> I see this as a problem unrelated to packetizing data so you can tell where the end is.  </s>
<s> I'd like to see arbitrary limits removed to the extent that it's possible; that's one of the things I dislike most about SSL's record layer (particularly since SSL adds so much per-record overhead) and I'd like to see that mistake not get repeated.  </s>

<s> They  </s>
<s> Although I don't agree, as  </s>
<s> do carry weight with me, there are times when it is preferable to not have to scan for a boundary marker.  </s>
<s> In this spirit, I propose a simple (and perhaps simple-minded : ) method for a self-describing binary length encoding: 1.  </s>
<s> The initial octet shall be in the Base64 alphabet (RFC1341).  </s>
<s> It describes the length of the length string; and 2. The following octets of the length string shall be in the Base64 alphabet, such that "B"(64) = 1(10), "BA"(64) = 64(10), "BAAA"(64) = 262144(10), and so on.  </s>
<s> These examples would then be: octet# on wire octet value 0 B 1 B for "B"(64) = 1(10), octet# on wire octet value 0 C 1 B 2 A for "BA"(64) = 64(10), and octet# on wire octet value 0 E 1 B 2 A 3 A 4 A for "BAAA"(64) = 262144(10).  </s>
<s> This complies with the spirit of HTTP, as the length encoding will be in ASCII as Phill noted:  </s>
<s> A self-describing binary length encoding string of length 64 (1 octet for the length of the length + 63 length octets) represented in the Base64 alphabet can encode a transmission length of up to 64^63 - 1 octets, or 61565634681866373769186000156474396570437092610102260418669208444133\ 9402679643915803347910232576806887603562348543 octets if you prefer.  </s>
<s> This is around 6.16x10^112, whereas there are only around 10^80 particles in the known universe.  </s>
<s> By the time we run into this limit, it is likely we will want to switch away from HTTP :)...  </s>
<s> The Base64 alphabet was chosen because it is a compact printable representation of base 64 numbers that is portable between ASCII, EBCDIC, ISO 646, and ISO 10646 that should have multiple correct alphabet translation tables already available.  </s>

<s> No, if we are going to go with something simple(-minded), then a straight CRLF delimited number is more appropriate -- dicking with bits and base64 is a waste of time if all you'd every save is one or two bytes.  </s>
<s> Right-o then, here's where the perceived consensus lands us.  </s>
<s> Content-Transfer-Encoding: chunked BNF: Entity-Body = *( chunk ) "0" CRLF footer CRLF chunk = chunk-size CRLF chunk-data CRLF chunk-size = hex-no-zero *hex chunk-data = chunk-size(OCTET) footer = *( Entity-Header ) hex = "0" | hex-no-zero hex-no-zero = "1"|"2"|"3"|"4"|"5"|"6"|"7"|"8"|"9"  </s>

<s> Roy's perceived consensus C-T-E proposal looks okay to me.  </s>
<s> And he's stated that anything purporting to handle HTTP/1.1 must handle "chunked".  </s>
<s> Next questions: 1) Should the specification state when "chunked" must and must not be used?  </s>
<s> Although there's no consensus session/keepalive proposal, obviously any content sent from the server to the client for a held-open connection must either have a Content-Length or be chunked.  </s>
<s> 2) Can a client send chunked content in a POST in lieu of a Content-Length, or even with a C-L? (And what does it mean to have both, especially if they disagree?) 3) If (2) is true, does the CGI interface change to require a CGI script to interpret C-T-E, or does the interface stay the same, and the server processes the chunked content and passes the concatenated chunks to the CGI?  </s>
<s> If the latter, is it valid for the server to forge a Content-Length header for the CGI to use to read the concatenated content where none existed previously?  </s>
<s> Dave Kristol  </s>
<s> a) I think we should pay attention to Harald's request that we not call it a C-T-E.  </s>
<s> Even though we can justify that usage ourselves, there's no harm in using a different header in HTTP, is there?  </s>
<s> b) I'll give up calling for a string-terminated boundary marker if no one else thinks it is worthwhile.  </s>
<s> c) So far the HTTP WG has avoided specifying what happens with CGI -- it's out of scope of the WG, platform dependent, etc.  </s>
<s> However, changes to HTTP do affect CGI, so should be considered.  </s>
<s> C-T-E is a really gross but essential bit of cruft.  </s>
<s> Creating something similar but with elegant purpose should imply a new name.  </s>
<s> The MIME spec.  </s>
<s> expressly closes the category off for extension anyhow and it's a gesture that should be respected.  </s>
<s> I think it's essential not just worthwhile, but I suppose it can wait 'til HTTP-NG if necessary.  </s>
<s> Being able to start sending a stream before having the full wad in hand has too many applications to ignore support for it, particularly since we've got a functioning model, that's proven to work well, available to clone.  </s>
