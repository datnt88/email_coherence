Is it conceptually possible to make a "Filtered Interface REgistry" that would function as a "poor person's firewall", interpose an internally maintained proxy server with a registry of all one's name, address, etc. and properly secured credit card stuff so that a conforming interactive forms submission on a Web site could (at the whim of the client) access all that information without one having to repeatedly be entering "William Baldridge Loughborough..." (with a surname as long as mine this becomes a main reason for having wanted a computer in the first place!)? 
If such a feature became ubiquitous it might help accessibility. 
Love. 
ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE Probably so. 
By the way, have you tried the Opera browser? 
(Currently available only for Windows machines, both 3.X and 95/NT.) It has the ability to enter your information, including your name, address, phone number, etc., into the browser, and then quickly and easily paste that into any text field form. 
The way I do it is with a right-click and then a select, but I imagine there are probably keyboard shortcuts too, knowing how Opera is put together.

some sites cdnow for instance will provide you with an auto login allowing for the information you describe and much much more to be filled in only once and never again unless you need to change something.

to follow up on what William Loughborough said: Yes, these facts can be saved for you by a remote server, and they can be remembered for you by your PC. If you let somebody else remember this stuff, there are security and privacy issues. 
If these facts are going to be remembered on lots of PCs by software from competing companies, there are data definition issues. 
That's the point of defining an e-commerce schema using something like RDF so that all web tools would have a sufficiently interoperable idea of the data fields that go into a retail sales transaction, and whether you were operating from Quicken, CitiBank, Opera or whoever, the associations (through the schema) of the fields in the commercial website and the remembered personal profile in your cache somewhere would auto-fill those things that you had filled in on some other form. 
Al Internet Explorer includes Microsoft Wallet, which is a locally maintained set of personal information, including certificates. 
I'm not certain people will agree to having such information available on a separate proxy server. 
Remind me - how does this benefit accessibility?

does the wallet provide information in a way that is accepted by all forms? 
if so, it would be good for access as many forms are not accessable.
