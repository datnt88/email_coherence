How should the response for an activity checkin (as defined by 13.11) be marshalled? 
Should the response code be 201 or 207? 
Should there be a Location header containing the URL for each new version resource created? 
Should the response body be a DAV:multistatus element with a DAV:href for each new version resource created? 
Thanks, Roy Well it isn't defined, so I guess it can be whatever you like g . 
The only requirement is that: "If a response body is included, it MUST be a DAV:checkin-response XML element. 
!ELEMENT checkin-response ANY " The method is being applied to a single resource (the activity) with no depth implications, so a 207 does not 'feel' right. 
I realize that there are multiple resources affected, but would expect problems with them to be marshalled in the error response element. 
So if all is well, return '201 Created'. 
I wouldn't return multiple Location: headers. 
How would you know which checked-out resource led to which location? 
If there are checkin failures, you could return something like 409 Conflict DAV:... Regards, Tim From: Tim Ellison [mailto:Tim_Ellison@uk.ibm.com]

Yeah, we appeared to have omitted defining this case. 
I'm tempted to squeeze something into the final edit pass for this (assuming we can agree on what it should be :-).

I agree. 
Also, you can't return multiple Location headers, because that would require that the syntax of the Location header allow a comma separated list, which it does not. 
If there are checkin failures, you could return something like 409 Conflict DAV:... Note: One of the changes in the final editing pass clarifies that DAV:checkin-response is only returned on a successful request. 
So a 207 response on failure would be fine, indicating which checkin's failed (or for servers that support atomic activity checkin, which checkin's would have failed), and why. 
(I assume that like COPY/MOVE, only the error responses would appear in the 207). 
So to make this clear, we would need to say: - The Location header is not returned on an activity checkin - If the activity checkin fails, a 207 status must be returned, with a response for each checked-out resource that could not be checked in. 
Does anyone object to this?
