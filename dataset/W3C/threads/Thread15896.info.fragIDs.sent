During the last three months I've been doing two things: 1. 
I used the web and 2. I followed these mailing lists closely. 
I serve the net for more then two years now and unfortunately I must say: the longer I do it, the more difficult it becomes. 
But although the discussions were interesting, they did not really hit the real problems I had when using the web. 
Just some examples: 
1. More and more sites use JAVA, JAVA script and/or generated pages. 
With LYNX - or any other text-based or specific browser - no scripting support at all is available. 
When using e.g. IE results are rather unpredictable and depend on a lot of good luck and - as usual - the screen reader program used. 
In (nearly) all cases though I did not have the feeling that "I saw, what I'd got". 
Or to say it more clearly: I could not get through without sighted people's assistence. 
One additional remark must be that each screen reader had its own "good things". 
Major problem of course is I only visit such pages once ! 
2. For transactions of any importance SSL is required these days. 
This is quite useful, but do you know any text-based 
browser that supports SSL? 
3. I tried the - most recent - demo of PW Webspeak. 
I do not know 
if this demo is a good version to try, but - to my disappointment - it did not even support FRAMEs. 
I did not dare to try SSL ! 
4. When I use IE - with a frame-based environment - the tab order and frame navigation interfeers strange. 
First of all I'm of course not informed about frame changes; The screen reader is simply not aware and IE seems not to be really aware either: - When I tab it just jumps from the last tab-pos of one frame to the first tab-pos of the next frame regardless of the current focus in this frame. 
- When I go to a new frame the focus of this frame is destroyed. 
It simply goes to the first tab-stop in the frame. 
- The same is true for swithcing frames. 
YOu can use Ctrl-Tab to jump from frame to frame, but ... the focus will be ... lost. 
- By the way ... when using IE: if you follow an internal link in a page the destination does not get focus either. 
5. It is very useful to discuss ALT texts: how to add them and where to put them (and how to mentain them?). 
First you must ask though: How to present them to the user: Fullgrown ALT-text usage must become available through the browser; the browser must allow you to: identify an object, imform you there is an alternate text (of whatever type) and display this information properly: - LYNX: I do not even realize when ALT text is displayed; whether it concerns an active link (image with ALT text). 
- IE: shows it as a "tool tip" that is not picked up 
by my (?) screen reader. 
I'd like to approach accessibility requirements from another viewpoint: the ability to use the information and/or service on the web. 
This has been mentioned in the lists and meetings several times too: WAI should identify the problems first (didn't we discuss this in Nice) and then try to prioritize this list of problems. 
This must of course been based on importance of the items and not on possibilities to solve it.

As a sighted user and with other browsers, I have some comments/additions. 
JavaScript doesn't work with the latest Internet Explorer 4 and Netscape 4 if the user turnes it off. 
Same goes for Java. 
They cannot replace HTML. 
The only real solution here is in the hands of the authors, that should use these features as enhacing a well functioning HTML document. 
Opera 3.1 supports JavaScript and can be configured to a text based mode (almost). 
With images turned off, and all headings defined in the same font (face and size if you wish). 
Frames are visual by nature, and any linear support will not replace the necessity for a no-frames version. 
Again, its up to the authors to provide the real solution. 
Opera 3.1 supports frames, and allows to turn them off. 
It is rather disapointing that it just shows the NOFRAMES section when frames are off. 
It does not indicate that this is a FRAMESET document not it provides links to the different frames. 
With a well written 
site its not a problem, but I get many blank (or worse) pages from 
bad authors (who too often order me to upgrade my frame capable Opera 3.1 to a flawed frame capable browser like Nestcape 2.0...). 
With frames on: When you move from the initial position of the FRAMESET to another, Opera shows in the location bar the URL of the last document that was reached, and not of the FRAMESET. 
This improves orientation by a lot. 
Turning frames off again: Opera also allows to "disable generation of new windows from documents". 
It helps around lazy authors of frames, whose "no frames" section is the same pages of the framed vesrsion. 
Since the links in the framed version have targets they generate new windows when viewed independetly. 
With frames off, and disabling generation of windows these sites are navigationable using the "Previous" (or "back") key. 
I couldn't agree more. 
These tooltips (both Explorer and Netscape) are a big mess also for sighted users, who have to play around with the mouse for five minutes to convince the browser to do the favor and render them. 
Opera 3.1 with images turned off shows the ALT text as regular text marked correctly, e.g. H1 IMG src=foo.gif" 
alt="Welcome to Foo" /H1 is rendered almost as H1 Welcome to Foo /H1 , but it indicates the fact that it is an alt text of an image by drawing a border around the text. 
(if height and width specified it does the same. 
The box is around the text and the height and width are disregarded.) 
It is in my view a good implementation of alt for sighted users, (who may download the image, if they wish) but I don't know whether a screen reader will read it (probably not). 
Its more informative than Lynx, but does not break the flow of reading like Netscape and Explorer do, by showing the ALT text of headings like regular text in strange boxes, if at all. 
Opera has also an intermediate images off/on mode. 
It shows only cached images, and draws boxes for images with height and width specified. 
(this is Netscape's images off mode) which is helpful if the author screwed big in page layout considerations... (I.e. assumed that boxes of images are always drawn) or with image maps. 
I don't work for Opera. 
I just got an evaluation copy a few days ago, and I deinstalled Netscape 3.0. 
an hour later. 
(I still have Netscape 4.0 and MSIE4.0 but mainly for authoring, e.g., playing around with stylesheets.) I would be interested to hear a screen reader user's opinion on Opera.

AG:: I find this too pessimistic to accept as the long-term answer. 
Frames are simply too "right" an idea to relegate them to the problem list forever. 
Framesets are intrinsically contextual in nature. 
They capture the layers of the onion the way the largely 
ignored LINK REL=foo  structure tried to. 
The problem is that 
the relationships are not adequately articulated; too much is left to be implicit in the visual juxtaposition. 
Any problem we have with framesets today we are going to have in spades with multipanel multimedia presentations. 
Can anyone help me find some good [or as good as they get] examples of framed sites that are feasible, easy, or even gracious to navigate in [your choice of] adaptive environment? 
Start at www.microsoft.com and at www.cybermedia.com and tell me about a site that is better.

Al Gilman asked for people's recomendations about well-designed frmaed sites. 
The site www.teddyworks.com.au was a project that got shelved. 
It was a frame based site, which was intended to work equally well without frames. 
A major consideration in the original project was that for it to be maintained it would have to have a single version that worked properly, rather than be built as two versions of the same site. 
Although the representation of pictures probably leaves a bit to be desired I would be interested to hear how people find this site - what I did right and what I did wrong. 
As far as I can see it works very well, 
but my vision is always blurred a bit when I am looking at my own work. 
Thanks - awaiting the praise and criticism ;) Charles McCathieNevile RMIT University 
Hi Harvey, Thanks for your posting and noting that the credit for that framed site was !-- Lotus Domino Web Server Release 4.51 (Gold, Build 202 on Windows From some of the other responses to your post, I'm not sure everyone realize that you were pointing out that the "author" of that site was not a person, but a computer program. 
I think there is a very great threat to accessability on the web here. 
Automatic web authoring programs are bound to have a lot of appeal because of the obvious financial benefits. 
If these programs crank out inaccessable web pages, the number of inaccessable sites will proliferate at a very rapid rate. 
As I understand it, Lotus Domino can build a web page using elements of a data base and the data base can contain purely graphical elements. 
From all the discussion on alt text, etc., I don't see how a computer program is ever going to be smart enough to know how a graphic should be described. 
This would take a very sophisticated artificial intelligence 
program. 
Is anyone addressing how text descriptions are going to be linked to the graphics in this situation?

(My pet example of Framed sites I hate is www.melbourne.org and the 
depressing thing about it was that they asked my advice, and then 
it completely. 
Lynx users will have a particularly bad time with it, 
it is easy to demonstrate the problems by reference to such a site) 
Thanks for the pertinent URL. 
There is no body content. 
Before it is a noframes , with the message: go get a browser that supports frames, from Netscape or Microsoft. 
Bobby analysis finds no problems with no content, so this is worth 4 stars!

to follow up on what Joe Roeder said: 
For the case of multimedia presentations, the SYMM Working Group is working on an approach. 
For the general case that you are talking about, no, but it's on our radar screen. 
"Description - Next Generation" is one of the functional areas where I said to the Coordination Group that we need a development effort, and they directed me to develop a briefing package and run it through my WAI-PF group first. 
I have not discharged that action item yet. 
I would regard the scenario you describe as falling in the "Description - Next Generation" area. 
We will at least be batting ideas around in the meetings at CSUN which may result in more concrete work items in this area. 
Finding a solution involves looking at more than protocols and formats, I suspect. 
Other old business in my estimation includes Frames, Tables, and dynamic content. 
All are areas where the current achieved accessibility is below what we want and a planned development task may be required to make adequate progress, in my personal opinion.
