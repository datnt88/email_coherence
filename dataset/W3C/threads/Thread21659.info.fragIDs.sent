Tim, I have modified the easter testcase at in that it now uses math:integerQuotient (we now also support rules with more than one triple in the conclusion but without bnodes). 
I have also tested with cwm and it indeed gives 2003 a easter#Year ; easter#hasEasterOnDay 20.0; easter#hasEasterOnMonth 4 . 
2004 a easter#Year ; easter#hasEasterOnDay 11.0; easter#hasEasterOnMonth 4 . 
which is like we get with euler asking (just wonder why the day has got a dot and the month not)

Cool 
Great! I must put it into the tests. 
( There is supposed to be a routine to clean up floats which are really integers.) 
I'm going away on vacation for a week now. 
yes, N3 is really cool and there is now a great tutorial ;-) 
have a very nice vacation and a happy Easter!
