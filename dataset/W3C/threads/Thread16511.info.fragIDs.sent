I am looking for existing web based discussion forums (not mailing lists such as this one) used by people with disabilities. 
Any ideas?

I can't imagine that a screen reader user would be able to successfully register on the Lineone site because the registration form design doesn't look screen reader friendly. 
Do you know if anyone with a screen reader is successfully using either discussion site?

There is a site under development by another group in the UK to build an online community and enable on line discussion for people with learning difficulties. 
I have seen a beta, and would expect a launch within 12 months.

Hi Graham, Don't know if this is what you are looking for. 
It's a good Forum but a terrible site.

Graham - I'm glad you started this thread, because this is an area that needs renewed attention. 
Both collaborative and online learning environments are strategic areas that have poor records with respect to accessibility. 
Collaborative products fall into two categories, synchronous (real-time) and asynchronous (anytime), and present issues due to the human-human communication they enable that are distinct from the [individual] human-computer interface that has dominated the attention of the assistive technology community to date. 
Online learning environments also pose issues due to many of the most educationally (pedagogically) sound products being based almost exclusively on visual reinforcement. 
Fortunately, the work on multiple-intelligences (Howard Gardner and others) and learning preferences (such as the Auditory/Visual/Kinesthetic models of Dawna Markova) will be a primary driver leading to multimodal learning environments. 
Within the next few weeks, I plan to update portions of my website related to the accessibility of both collaborative and online learning, and will post another response once these updates are complete. 
In the meantime, I've provided a link to the paper that Susan Turnbull and I presented at CSUN 2000, and a link to a paper commissioned by the Knowledge Management Working Group (which reports to the CIO Council within the U.S. federal government).
