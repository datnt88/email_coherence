<s> Graham - I'm glad you started this thread, because this is an area that needs renewed attention.  </s>
<s> Both collaborative and online learning environments are strategic areas that have poor records with respect to accessibility.  </s>
<s> Collaborative products fall into two categories, synchronous (real-time) and asynchronous (anytime), and present issues due to the human-human communication they enable that are distinct from the [individual] human-computer interface that has dominated the attention of the assistive technology community to date.  </s>
<s> Online learning environments also pose issues due to many of the most educationally (pedagogically) sound products being based almost exclusively on visual reinforcement.  </s>
<s> Fortunately, the work on multiple-intelligences (Howard Gardner and others) and learning preferences (such as the Auditory/Visual/Kinesthetic models of Dawna Markova) will be a primary driver leading to multimodal learning environments.  </s>
<s> Within the next few weeks, I plan to update portions of my website related to the accessibility of both collaborative and online learning, and will post another response once these updates are complete.  </s>
<s> In the meantime, I've provided a link to the paper that Susan Turnbull and I presented at CSUN 2000, and a link to a paper commissioned by the Knowledge Management Working Group (which reports to the CIO Council within the U.S. federal government).  </s>
