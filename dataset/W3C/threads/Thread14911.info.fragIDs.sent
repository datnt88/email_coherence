<s> A message from you goes: You -- Server -- Everyone The first loop, the out-of-office loop, goes like this: You -- Server -- Someone else -- You The second loop, your own copy of what you posted, goes: You -- Server -- You Now, the tricky part is that the transmission from Server -- Everyone might not happen instantly.  </s>
<s> For example, if you are at the bottom of the distribution list, and I'm at the top, I might get my mail long before you get yours.  </s>
<s> An illustrative timeline: :00 Jonathan sends email to the list.  </s>
<s> :01 Jonathan's email is received by the server.  </s>
<s> The list server starts sending out copies to everyone on the list.  </s>
<s> :02 Kynn's name, 3rd on the list, is reached, and email is sent to Kynn.  </s>
<s> The server continues on down the list of subscribers.  </s>
<s> :03 Kynn's server receives the email.  </s>
<s> Kynn's "out of office" program sends email directly to Jonathan.  </s>
<s> :04 Jonathan's mail host receives Kynn's "out of office" email.  </s>
<s> :07 The list server, continuing to send email, gets down to Jonathan's address, near the end.  </s>
<s> It sends a copy to him.  </s>
<s> :08 Jonathan receives his own copy of the email.  </s>
<s> :10 The list server finishes sending copies out.  </s>
<s> That's just one way it could happen.  </s>
<s> Another way is that email delivery between points on the internet is not a constant amount of time; it varies a lot depending on speed of connection and network traffic.  </s>
<s> So another scenario could be: Jonathan sends his email to the server.  </s>
<s> It takes 5 seconds to get there.  </s>
<s> The server holds on to it for some amount of time (see above) and then sends it out again.  </s>
<s> It takes 1 second to deliver the email to Kynn.  </s>
<s> And it takes 2 seconds for a message to go from Kynn to Jonathan.  </s>
<s> So it arrives in 3 seconds, while Jonathan's copy took 5 seconds to reach him.  </s>
<s> The two scenarios aren't incompatible -- and in fact, both are likely at work here.  </s>
<s> To factor the second scenario into the first, you just have to adjust the timeline for the amount of time it took to transmit the message.  </s>
<s> In the first scenario, the transmission time is assumed to be a constant 1 second instead of a variable amount.  </s>
<s> --Kynn Kynn Bartlett kynn@idyllmtn.com  </s>
<s> Yeah great Kynn bar one thing.  </s>
<s> I sent a reply to Cynthia and the list at 20:43 I got a reply from her at 21:27 My posting has not yet reached me at 22:10 I sometimes even go and look at the archives, just to make sure I'm still in my tree.... see my point now?  </s>
<s> btw I have done a search for 'snippet' and it is not on my HD. Am I the only one, or does everyone have this problem... thanks jonathan chetwynd on the web" learning difficulty get the most from the web"  </s>
