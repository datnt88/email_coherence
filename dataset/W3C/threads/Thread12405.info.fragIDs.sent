It appears that a number of people are still in transit from the WAI face to face meetings and CSUN. 
Consequently we will postpone today's call until next Monday April the 1st, and no this is not an early April fool's joke.

Oh, noo! 
Several people have pointed out that Easter Monday is a holiday in many countries. 
How many people are actually available on April 1st? 
If we have enough confirmed participants we will hold a teleconference, if not we will shift it to April 8th and resolve issues on the list in the mean time. 
Jutta 
So far we have one positive and several negative replies regarding the teleconference on Monday. 
Can anyone else attend the call on Monday at noon EST? 
I would like to decide today whether we should hold the call. 
Thanks 
Jutta 
I can make it for Monday.

Regrets, I will be at the PF face to face meeting. 
Just a reminder that this group is required to record meetings and publish notes about them.
