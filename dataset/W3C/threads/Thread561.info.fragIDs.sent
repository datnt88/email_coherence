<s> where in the DOM data structures is href stored?  </s>
<s> For example, Where can I find "http://myurl.com"  </s>
<s> ?  </s>
<s> I find "a" listed as an element but I can't find an "href" node anywhere.  </s>
<s> If I understood your question correctly, you should be able to retrieve the attribute value using the getAttribute("href") method call on the Element that is "a".  </s>

<s> href is an attribute of the a element.  </s>
<s> In the DOM model (http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/PR-DOM-Level-2-Core-20000927/core.html#ID-637646024) an Attr is -not- a child of the element with which it is associated.  </s>
<s> If you have the Element for a, try getAttributes() which returns a NamedNodeMap, or getAttribute() which returns a String with the attribute value for a specified attribute, or getAttributeNode() which returns an Attr node for the specified attribute.  </s>
<s> The DOM specification referred to above explains all of this.  </s>
<s> Check the information under Node, Element, and Attr.  </s>
