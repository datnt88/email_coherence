where in the DOM data structures is href stored? 
For example, Where can I find "http://myurl.com" 
? 
I find "a" listed as an element but I can't find an "href" node anywhere. 
If I understood your question correctly, you should be able to retrieve the attribute value using the getAttribute("href") method call on the Element that is "a".

href is an attribute of the a element. 
In the DOM model (http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/PR-DOM-Level-2-Core-20000927/core.html#ID-637646024) an Attr is -not- a child of the element with which it is associated. 
If you have the Element for a, try getAttributes() which returns a NamedNodeMap, or getAttribute() which returns a String with the attribute value for a specified attribute, or getAttributeNode() which returns an Attr node for the specified attribute. 
The DOM specification referred to above explains all of this. 
Check the information under Node, Element, and Attr.
