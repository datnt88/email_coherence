<s> Hello all, I heard that it is better to specify the font-size in 100% in stead of em in the body.  </s>
<s> Due to a bug in special IE6 browsersettings em seems to be rendered very small.  </s>
<s> Other elements can have a property font-size em as those seem not be influenced by this special bug that appears in some IE6 settings.  </s>
<s> Has anybody experience with this bug and in what IE6 browsersettings this occurs?  </s>

<s> With text size set to smallest in IE, it's still readable - depending of course on your eyesight!  </s>
<s> At any rate, the font size shown on screen for IE will only "scale-down" to a certain size and no lower with this method.  </s>
<s> As always, test this method across browers, but I've found it to work quite well.  </s>
