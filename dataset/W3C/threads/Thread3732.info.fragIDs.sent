<s> I've put up the XML Validator at  </s>
<s> This is based on the existing experimental service at valet, but has been updated to use Xerces 2.1 and I've made some other long-overdue improvements.  </s>
<s> It's definitely alpha-quality, and liable to fall about in a heap just now.  </s>
<s> Questions: * Are people happy with the general format of this service?  </s>
<s> * If so, shall I put the code into qa-dev cvs at this point?  </s>
<s> * If not, what should be changed?  </s>
<s> * Has anyone put any XML catalogue stuff onto qa-dev?  </s>
<s> It'll run a lot faster and more efficiently if it can resolve entities locally!  </s>

<s> This has now been updated: - fixed bug in mod_xml's Xalan-1.4 bindings that was causing larger reports in HTML and EARL formats to break down.  </s>
<s> - Added web browser based validator.  </s>
<s> If noone on qa-dev is interested in this, I'd now be comfortable announcing it to a wider audience on www-validator.  </s>
<s> Is there an official policy concerning where I can/can't announce something like this?  </s>

<s> very interesting and nice interface  </s>
<s> Be careful to the auto validation things.  </s>
<s> Just to avoid trolls.  </s>
<s> I don't see any problems, it's nice to have this output.  </s>
<s> It would be good to have a detailed explanation of what we get in return, type of messages, type of errors, DTDs if any etc.  </s>
<s> A manual :p  </s>
<s> The output seems to come back on one line (maybe it's my terminal which sucks) if it's the case, maybe a formatted output would be better.  </s>
<s> For example rdf:RDF xmlns:r="modxml:validator#0.1" xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#" xmlns:val="http://valet.webthing.com/xmlns/validator.rdf#" xmlns:earl="http://www.w3.org/2001/03/earl/1.0-test#" earl:testMode rdf:resource .... .... etc  </s>
<s> if you put Earl as the defaut namespace it will make the syntax a bit more readable :)  </s>
<s> xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2001/03/earl/1.0-test#" Great.  </s>
<s> If I have forgotten things I will come back.  </s>
<s> Karl Dubost / W3C - Conformance Manager --- Be Strict To Be Cool! ---  </s>
<s> Thankyou :-)  </s>
<s> Ah, the xmlns: attributes.  </s>
<s> I've updated the stylesheet to suppress that.  </s>
<s> Ah yes, the drudgery bit of it.  </s>
<s> Keep badgering me, and things may happen - eventually.  </s>
<s> Recruit more bodies to it and things might happen faster:-)  </s>
<s> Hmmm, I never thought the EARL version was supposed to be human- readable.  </s>
<s> Too tired tonight to figure out whether there's a Right Way to do that; I'd rather not use a hack.  </s>
<s> Done.  </s>
<s> I'll look forward to it:-) Nick Kew  </s>
<s> Is the EARL produced by an XSLT?  </s>
<s> Karl Dubost / W3C - Conformance Manager --- Be Strict To Be Cool! ---  </s>
<s> Yes, both the HTML and EARL are produced by XSLT.  </s>
<s> The XSLT files I'm using are in /home/nick/httpd/modxml.  </s>
<s> I guess they'd better go under CVS once I get a round tuit.  </s>
<s> BTW, mod_xml precompiles and caches the stylesheets, so Apache has to be restarted when you update them.  </s>
