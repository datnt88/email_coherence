In compiling our notes from our teleconference last week, I realized that one of the things we had talked about was items that contributed to clear and simple writing, but that really belonged to other checkpoints. 
Items such as: - Structure your document well. 
- Emphasize the structure. 
- Include illustrations, etc. 
It occurred to me that, perhaps we are wording 4.1 wrong. 
Rather than saying write as clearly as simply, perhaps the 4.1 should really be talking about "Use clear and simple language". 
I believe that this was a comment made by others earlier, but we somehow didn't pick up on it the teleconference today. 
Should we be changing this one to: "Use language which is as clear and simple as [appropriate or possible] for the purpose of the content."

I would like to re-propose that we drop the bit about "appropriate for the content" since this seems to lead people to assume that it is OK to use complex language (even unnecessarily complex language) to talk about complex topics. 
And agree with Gregg that we should be saying something like "Use clear and simple language" - my original proposal at language that is easy to understand". 
The success criteria, naturally enough, should include the fact that any simplification still conveys what the author is trying to say. 
And I think that some of the things we talk about as requirements for documents, such as having a discernible structure, are also success criteria at the level of language use. 
For example the proposed criterion of one idea per paragraph, with the first sentence sumarising it, is a lot like having a document that uses headings to convey soome sense of the meaning of each section.

When we start thinking about success criteria such as the one Charles refers to below-- "one idea per paragraph," with the first sentence summarizing it-- we are talking about ideas of writing that are (or used to be) taught in this country at 7th and 8th grade levels. 
We also seem to be ignoring what colleagues in fields such as rhetoric &amp; composition and technical communication can offer us about both structuring documents and making their structures evident. 
I am actually more comfortable with checkpoint wording that includes something about appropriateness to the purpose of the document, for reasons I've already stated often enough so that no one will want to hear them again. 
I will talk to some of my colleagues in tech comm when I return from vacation to see if I can come up with concrete suggestions for success criteria instead of just whacking away at other people's proposals. 
But that will be when I get back from vacation, unless I happen to run into a tech commie here...
