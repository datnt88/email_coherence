<s> It drives me nuts to keep the following kind of thing in sync: loc href="http://www.w3.org" http://www.w3.org /loc I do this all the time in issue and comment resolution markup.  </s>

<s> loc href="http://www.w3.org"/ loc http://www.w3.org /loc  </s>
<s> What prevents you from writing the former?  </s>
<s> It's content is #PCDATA which can be empty.  </s>

<s> I have to say I liked that too, but it was decided to leave that out of XML.)  </s>

<s> What's missing is the convention to expand this appropriately.  </s>
<s> Of course such a convention can be added if we think that empty content isn't used otherwise.  </s>

<s> It's a very useful thing, but not something that needs special treatment.  </s>

<s> Is there an element similar to HTML's BLOCKQUOTE?  </s>
<s> quote seems to be a phrase-level element.  </s>
<s> None yet, but I'll treat this as a request and add something like it for the next release.  </s>
