<s> Hi, I am discovering Amaya software ... When i do a copy from another software, a text editor by example with 3 lines of text and then a past in Amaya, i loose the line break and get only one line of text.  </s>
<s> In other words, is there a feature (like in Netscape Composer) when you do a paste to get the br tag at the end of each line you copy ?  </s>
<s> Thanks for your answer Patrick GIRARD  </s>
<s> This was already discussed and today we apply the rule of HTML parsers: - If you paste within a paragraph line breaks are ignored, - but if you paste within a preformatted, Amaya keeps line breaks.  </s>
<s> It's exactly the same a HTML source file is parsed.  </s>
<s> I also had a similar problem with posting a message using a form.  </s>
<s> The message I was typing in ran out of the form box, and when I pressed "enter" the line jumped to the top of the page (over the top of other text/images).  </s>
<s> How "browser capable" is Amaya designed to be?  </s>
