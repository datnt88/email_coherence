I am writing to suggest that the tag: and urn:tag: schemes proposed in not necessary, being already subsumed in the existing urn:newsml scheme. 
urn:newsml has an unfortunately over-specific name, I admit from the beginning. 
But it has essentially the same structure as tag: and provides the same benefits. 
A newsml scheme URI looks like this: urn:newsml:whatever.com:20010911:anyoldstring:1 
This is, semantically speaking, a tag minted by whoever held "whatever.com" 
on 2001-09-11, and is named "anyoldstring". 
The 1 part is a positive integer representing a version number: this is not optional, but can always be set to 1 for people who don't need versioning. 
For those who do, it is guaranteed that it is monotonically increasing with time: any newly minted URI that agrees in its first five components with an existing URI must have a higher version number. 
The urn:newsml scheme is described in RFC 3085. 
All Gaul is divided into three parts: the part John Cowan that cooks with lard and goose fat, the part www.ccil.org/~cowan that cooks with olive oil, and the part that www.reutershealth.com 
cooks with butter. 
-- David Chessler jcowan@reutershealth.com There is a lot of overlap. 
This should be pointed out in the tag FAQ or the draft. 
The biggest practical difference is that newsml requires minters to own a domain name. 
This may be reasonable for publishers of news articles, but it's an unnecessary restriction in general, so the tag specification also allows owners of e-mail addresses to mint tags. 
Semantically of course there's a problem that RFC 3085 says urn:newsml resources are "NewsItems". 
The idea is to name lots of things (cars, stars, bars, guitars, ...) with tags. 
Most software will never understand or care that these things are not NewsItems, but ontology systems (see [1]) certainly will. 
3085 also says that urn:newsml URIs map 1-1 to their resources; this is not appropriate for many tag: applications. 
There is no way to stop people from naming things, in general, even if they already have names. 
Systems with unique names for things are nice, but impossible to construct in some situations. 
It seems to me, without really knowing anything about NewsML, like it wants to be using tags. 
I imagine the developers had to make a new URN NID to go with their markup language because they didn't know about tags, or because tags hadn't made it through the IETF process yet. 
I'd be interested to hear from a NewsML creator on this question.

I was one of the editors of the NewsML NID RFC. 
It was one of the first approved NIDs, and I don't remember that "urn:tag:" or similar had been mentioned at the time. 
News generates a lot of item IDs, so it was not inappropriate to have a NewsML NID. 
However, I wouldn't recommend using it for anything other than news. 
I don't see that it hurts if there is a more generic NID that just happens to have a similar RFC. 
Just don't copy the mistake in the productions in the NewsML NID RFC. 
Cheers, Tony.
