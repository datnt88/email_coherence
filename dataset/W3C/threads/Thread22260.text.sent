HTMLCollection03.xml and HTMLCollection11.xml have been changed and now run successfully on XERCES-J and IE6. 
However, when run on Mozilla 1.0 it causes the browser to crash. 
Can someone else try to run these two tests on Mozilla and see if their browser crashes. 
Rick Rivello I don't think that anyone else has been running the tests on the old JSUnit and the new JSUnit isn't ready yet. 
Running the old tests on JSUnit on Mozilla definitely stressed the browser in unnatural ways and would crash due to issues not directly related to the implementation. 
Hard to believe that changing the case of an argument to an assertion would cause the browser to crash, though. 
Can you summarize the results of the tests against IE6? Rick, I can confirm the crash and the developers are aware of it.
