Hello, my name is Hiroyuki Okamoto. 
I have a few questions about HTML Tidy. 
They are illegal cases, however content becomes strange after Tidying, so I report them. 
Thanks for the detailed feedback. 
(1) When I write the following content, OBJECT FONT TEST /FONT /OBJECT HTML Tidy moves the OBJECT element into the HEAD element like below. 
HTML HEAD OBJECT FONT TEST /FONT /OBJECT TITLE /TITLE /HEAD /HTML 
This is because object is allowed in the document head and hence Tidy doesn't know that an implicit body start tag is required. 
What should I do ? 
Place a body start tag before the object 
(2) When I write the following content, BODY TITLE TEST2 /TITLE /BODY HTML Tidy makes a new TITLE element like below. 
This is due to the way Tidy checks for a missing title before processing the body. 
In effect, Tidy generates errors during parsing, and then applies a few more checks afterwards. 
A work around would have been to log the error reports found during parsing and then merge them in line number order with those found in the subsequent checks. 
This would be major refinement to how Tidy works today. 
HTML HEAD TITLE /TITLE TITLE TEST2 /TITLE /HEAD BODY /BODY /HTML Title element should be only one in HEAD element. 
What should I do ? 
I am hoping that the next version of Tidy will fix this problem by checking for an empty title element when moving the title from the body to the head. 
Maintenance of Tidy has moved to Source Forge over work on dealing with bug reports and enhancement requests. 
(3) When I write the following content, FONT SELECT TEST3 /SELECT /FONT HTML Tidy deletes the text element in the SELECT element like below. 
HTML HEAD TITLE /TITLE /HEAD BODY FONT SELECT /SELECT /FONT /BODY /HTML I think deleting the text element directly inside the SELECT element is correct. 
However, if no element is inside the SELECT element, I think HTML Tidy should delete the SELECT element, too. 
Am I wrong ? 
I think Tidy could do better, and that further investigation is justified. 
(4) When I write the following content, BODY BR /BR /BODY HTML Tidy makes 2 BR elements like below. 
HTML HEAD TITLE /TITLE /HEAD BODY BR/ BR/ /BODY /HTML I think HTML Tidy should delete /BR end tag. 
Yes, that looks like a bug. 
And When will HTML Tidy's new version be released ? 
This is in the hands of the folks working on the Source Forge code base. 
You can get a prerelease version from the website and I am hoping that the official release will come shortly. 
See http://tidy.sourceforge,net/ 
I have agreed to change the W3C Tidy page to match when they do.

Do tidy file.html|tidy|tidy|tidy|diff - file.html notice anything growing? 
I do, e.g. -- comments like this -- sorry if this is fixed later than the Nov edition, my mailbox misfired. 
anyways, use my test above to check for many funny things. 
Known bug, which hasn't been fixed yet.
