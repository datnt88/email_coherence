<s> Mike Kay wrote over on xsl-list My own experience of migrating real stylesheets has been that there have been very few problems, and that they have generally related to use of extensions rather than to facilities in the W3C specs.  </s>
<s> If anyone does have any negative experiences of migration, I will be very interested to hear them (ideally, send them direct to the public-qt-comments@w3.org  </s>
<s> list).  </s>
<s> I just tried running a (set of) XSLT transformation (around 13000 lines of xslt 1.0) over a sample document using saxon 7.8, which implements most of the current draft.  </s>
<s> I have not yet compared the results to see if they are the same or equivalent (which is hard and would require visual checking) I am here just concentrating on cases where errors are raised where previously there were none.  </s>
<s> XSLT2 "backward compatibility" failed to produce a compatible result (or in fact, any result at all) due to a dozen or so instances of the same error.  </s>
<s> It is now an error to pass parameters to named templates if they are not declared in the template.  </s>
<s> I strongly believe that this should _not_ be an error in BC mode.  </s>
<s> Reviewing the cases that required change: one or two were "dead" parameters that had been used in earlier versions, but no longer appeared to be used.  </s>
<s> So their presence did no harm, but did no good either.  </s>
<s> Being warned of this might be seen as a good thing, but since it was a fatal error that stopped compliation of the stylesheet this would have been rather an expensive thing to test/debug and basically would mean that a production system using xsl1 will probably need to stay using xslt1 as long as possible.  </s>
<s> It might seem that this is a trivial change to make run on xslt2 (just remove the offending xsl:with-param) but in fact the hard part is distinguishing this class (which is a minority in my case) from the other class of constructs that triggered this error described below.  </s>
<s> The majority case was due to the fact that we produce two sets of documents (describing C and Fortran interfaces, as it happens) from the same source.  </s>
<s> The set up is the usual one, two top level stylesheets each importing a common one.  </s>
<s> However there are many parts of the transformation that are different in the two cases and need to be paramaterised diferently.  </s>
<s> The common code calls a named template with any parameters that might be useful in either interface.  </s>
<s> This now generates an error.  </s>
<s> A typical case is the named template which does something in the C interface but this is a no-op in the Fortran interface so that has (had) In XSLT2 this will have to be defined to take the same parameters (just id in this case) as the C interface.  </s>
<s> It is not clear to me that this requirement is necessarily a good thing (even in native xslt 2 mode) however I don't strongly object to it in 2.0 mode.  </s>
<s> As I say above, it did catch a couple of cases of dubious coding.  </s>
<s> However there is a real temptation to respond to the error message by commenting out the xsl:with-param only to find later that you have broken some other stylesheet that was expecting that parameter to be passed.  </s>
<s> This change is too much for backward compatibility mode.  </s>
<s> Having resolved all these parameter passing problems the stylesheeet then compiled and produced just one warning (twice).  </s>
<s> Warning: at xsl:for-each on line 3403 of file:/c:/engine-cvs/doc/xsl/libdoc-c-xml.xsl:  </s>
<s> Less-than and greater-than comparisons between strings have changed since XPath 1.0 which is checking that three "numbers" obtained from the source files satisfy a constraint that one lies between the other two.  </s>
<s> Is it really necessary for this to break in BC mode?  </s>
<s> Is it not possible for the mapping of = to the underlying F&amp;O operators is changed in BC mode to more closely match the behaviour in 1.0?  </s>
<s> While this is annoying it is actually less trouble to fix than the previous error, especially in this case, where the node sets such as @f in the expression really are only going to return one node so I would just need to add a couple of instances of number() (I hope:-) However if tehre are cases where the implicit existential quantification are used, it will be tricky for an end user to get right (easier for the system, I would have thought).  </s>
<s> While I do appreciate the facility to switch between native and BC mode on specific elements within the stylesheet, I believe that verion="1.0" on an xsl:stylesheet (or outer most element of a simplified stylesheet) should be treated differently: the stylesheet should be processed by an XSLT 1.0 processor, or an error raised if the processor does not support 1.0.  </s>

<s> David, This is the response to your comment on the XSLT 2.0 Last Call Working Draft.  </s>
<s> Your comment can be found in the following message: (Issue qt-2004Feb0856-01) Thank you for your comment.  </s>
<s> The XSL Working Group discussed your comment, and agreed that it would not be acceptable for it to be, in all circumstances, a static error to specify an xsl:with-param in an xsl:call-template if the named template did not have an xsl:param with the same name.  </s>
<s> As you pointed out, the effect on any existing XSLT 1.0 stylesheets that relied on the fact that no error would be produced would be too great.  </s>
<s> However, the consensus of the working group was also that this feature of XSLT 1.0 was a likely source of bugs, as simple typographical errors in the name specified for an xsl:with-param could easily go undetected.  </s>
<s> Therefore, the working group decided that ERR XT0680 (defined in Section 10.1.1) should be produced only if backwards compatible behavior is not in effect for the xsl:call-template instruction in question.  </s>
<s> As that is the proposal you made in your comment, I trust the decision will be acceptable to you.  </s>
<s> May I ask you to confirm that?  </s>
