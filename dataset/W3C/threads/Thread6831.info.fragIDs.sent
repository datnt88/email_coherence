<s> first, you really ought to be talking to the rfc-editor@isi.edu,  </s>

<s> second, the rfc editorial "rules", which you can find in rfc 2222, have some, but not a lot of overlap with the goals listed in  </s>
<s> in particular, you don't get to do pdf, or html, and postscript when publishing an rfc.  </s>
<s> (well, they'll allow postscript for figures, but you'll get so much feedback that you'll prefer to chew off your right arm rather than actually publish anything in postscript...) this means that the translater is going to have to be very, very smart, or you'll need to allow dual markup for the same content.  </s>
<s> messy.  </s>
<s> there are about a dozen or so people who write I-Ds/RFCs using the 2629 format.  </s>
<s> there is one translator for it that produces .txt  </s>
<s> &amp; .html  </s>
<s> versions  </s>
<s> from it.  </s>
<s> however, ascii art is the lowest common denominator.  </s>
<s> the entire RFC  </s>
<s> database is available in biblio format for including as references (which is  </s>
<s> a major selling point).  </s>
<s> it's not really clear to me that a harmonization effort would work, given the limitations in rfc 2222.  </s>
<s> however, i could certainly imagine someone writing some XSLT that would translate from the 2629 format to whatever the new format becomes, presumably because the new format would be a functional superset.  </s>
<s> /mtr  </s>
<s> Yes. And if the various constituencies are interested and as this is the only public forum I'm aware of for this, I'd recommend it happen here.  </s>
<s> The question is can we attract attention from the IETF (Marshall?) and Oasis so we can work together?  </s>

<s> I'm against creating large DTDs and would much prefer that we have smaller DTDs with more rigorous structure.  </s>
<s> Creating the "one- size-fits-all" DTD often ends up with a DTD that doesn't really fit anything, and people end up making subsets again.  </s>
<s> If we really can't transform from the current style of spec DTD to the IETF style of documents, then that says to me that they're so different that they should use different DTDs, i.e. they really are different classes of documents.  </s>
<s> Lauren  </s>
<s> In general, I agree; each DTD should stick to one "logical document type."  </s>
<s> But these are pretty close.  </s>
<s> We'll have to see how much the headers really differ, and if there's little overlap they may want to be developed separately.  </s>
<s> It would be nice to be able to hook them up to a common core, at least.  </s>
