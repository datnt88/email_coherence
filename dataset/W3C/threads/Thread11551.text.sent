Dear translators, in our translation of HTML 4.0 into Italian we are experimenting some difficulties about the following paragraph: |line 418 - file: "links.html" 
|type = content-type [CI] When present, this attribute specifies the content type of a piece of |content, for example, the result of dereferencing a resource. 
Content types are defined in [MIMETYPES]. 
Can you explain in other words this sentence: "the result of dereferencing a resource"? 
What does "dereferencing" mean? 
Thank you in advance. 
Best regards, Michele Diodati - Liber Liber (http://www.liberliber.it) 
Please don't use line numbers for referring to HTML documents :-). 
It's an "educated" way to refer to what happens when you take an URI (a reference) and turn it into the thing it references (generically called a resource). 
So strictly speaking, the text above is a bit incorrect, as it's not the resource, but the reference to the resource, that is dereferenced. 
Regards, Martin.
