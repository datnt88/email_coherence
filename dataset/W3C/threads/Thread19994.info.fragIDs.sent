<s> Another behaviour of Amaya that I find really annoying is that when it finishes loading a page into a window, this window puts itself in the foreground, i.e. rotates up to the top of the window hierarchy (I'm running under Unix/X11).  </s>
<s> This should be subject to the choice of the user in some configuration menu.  </s>
<s> Thanks, Karl-Michael  </s>
<s> In many cases, when you download a page you plan to read it?  </s>
<s> So I guess it's interesting to see the result when the download is finished.  </s>
<s> Isn't it?  </s>
<s> In the same way if you follow a link and the target page is already on your screen Amaya pops up the target page instead of doing nothing.  </s>
<s> Irene.  </s>
<s> Usually I have several applications running at the same time.  </s>
<s> So while Amaya is taking some time to load a page, I am typing input into another application.  </s>
<s> Then suddendly, Amaya pops up in the foreground and my typed characters go into the Amaya window instead into the other application where they should go.  </s>
<s> This is very annoying.  </s>
<s> What's the problem with making another menu entry to configure whether Amaya should go in the foreground when finished loading or not?  </s>
<s> I want to focus my attention to Amaya when I decide that it's time to do so, not when Amaya decides that I should pay attention to it.  </s>

<s> I think this popup feature is annoying as well.  </s>
<s> Who is in charge in this situation, the user or the computer?  </s>
<s> If my manager asks me for some kind of report I will provide it, but I won't interrupt his meeting to give it to him, unless he tells me to.  </s>
<s> If the browser is not on the top of the window stack it is because the user doesn't want it there right now.  </s>
