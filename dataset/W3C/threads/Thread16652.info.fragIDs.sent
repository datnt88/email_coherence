<s> I had to remove the xhtml header, !DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd" and replace it with html in order to retain drag and drop functionality, in mozilla.  </s>

<s> lynx 2.8.3 in default mode appears to render alt rather than title content.  </s>
<s> I had understood that title was more appropriate for describing purpose of link, and alt description of image.  </s>
<s> thus this seems contrary to what I've understood.  </s>
<s> title provides additional information about any element rendered element (i.e. those elements that relate to something seen, heard, or otherwise communicated to the user such as body , p , em but not such as head , meta , etc.), which can be rendered in any way that a browser chooses to aid a user.  </s>
<s> Not rendering title at all is a valid choice.  </s>
<s> alt provides an alternative to an image, not a description of it (longdesc does that).  </s>
<s> Generally a description of the image is a poor choice of alt text.  </s>

<s> However surely it is an accessibility issue, if we are being 'sold' a new 'strict' language.  </s>
<s> It may have many benefits(1), ease of implementation appears not to be one of them.  </s>
<s> html is very forgiving, and it is important that we consider any new language in that light.  </s>
<s> It is a more serious problem, if this: !DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd" can mean that a page is not rendered(2), when with html it is.  </s>
