Dan Connolly Someobdy asked about the phone number... W3C: +1-617-252-7000 (Tobin) also: we'll probably use IRC... at least I will... let's use the same channel as last time: #metadata on irc.w3.org:6665 i.e. irc://irc.w3.org:6665/metadata (IRC details are available at http://www.w3.org/Project/IRC/ in case you have trouble with member-only stuff... see windows client: http://www.mirc.co.uk/ unix client: http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Programs/Zircon/ mac client: http://www.ex.ac.uk/~jastaple/irc/irchelp.html IRC FAQ http://www.irchelp.org/irchelp/altircfaq.html ) Dan Connolly My regrets too.
