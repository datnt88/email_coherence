<s> The following are items to be briefly discussed and resolved in the first part of the face to face meeting entitled : Review of Document Structure and Scope.  </s>
<s> 1. How do we incorporate relevant existing Guidelines Reference but not duplicate other Guidelines Documents or provide summary of other documents in introduction or provide summary in appendix or restate relevant guidelines  </s>
<s> 2. If a critical point is not covered in the Web Content guidelines should we put it into the AU guidelines even though it belongs in another guideline?  </s>
<s> 3. Should we address access issues of XML/XSL, Schema, SMIL, MathML, and other standards other than HTML, if so how?  </s>
<s> 4. How many documents One document with Guidelines, Checkpoints, Techniques and Appendices or a separate Techniques document.  </s>

<s> One of the things we will do on Monday is go through the guidelines to see  </s>
<s> if we have sufficient checkpoints to address all aspects of the guideline  </s>
<s> (ie. if I do x y and z I will have met this guideline).  </s>
<s> Could everyone review the document with this in mind.  </s>
<s> Jutta  </s>
<s> I think this is a general documentation question: when to quote (and how much) vs. when to reference alone.  </s>
<s> I don't know that there is a general solution to this problem.  </s>
<s> Nonetheless, I suggest quoting where shared context is required, otherwise just reference.  </s>
<s> Also, there should be additional WAI NOTES soon to allow further referencing of some shared definitions.  </s>

<s> Please also alert the Web Content WG when you discover an important dependency.  </s>
<s> For reasons cited in another email (size, download times, readability), I propose two documents.  </s>
<s> Also, this would make the AU guidelines consistent with the other two, which is not primordial (the three look slightly different anyway), but would be beneficial, just like using the same nomenclature for the rating system (even if the meanings of the priorities differ slightly).  </s>
