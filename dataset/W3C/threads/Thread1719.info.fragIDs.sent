<s> Hi, A working-collection can have non-versioned-resources as its members.  </s>
<s> And when the working-collection is checked in, these non-versioned-members are automatically version-controlled.  </s>
<s> If the working-collection has a non-empty DAV:activity-set, then would it not make sense to copy this activity-set to each of the non-versioned-members which have been automatically version-controlled?  </s>
<s> This is especially meaningful when we consider the activity as a 'change set'.  </s>
<s> Surely the newly added resources are part of the same 'logical change' as their parent collection.  </s>
<s> Regards, Girish  </s>
<s> Yes, I agree that this would make sense.  </s>

<s> Hi, considering: - a versioned controlled checked-in collection /a - a version controlled resource /a/b with a version history resource of /vhr/123 - a server that handles deletion of version histories as request to un-version-control the VCR What should happen upon a DELETE on /vhr/123?  </s>
<s> - this would be considered to change the state of /a/b from being version-controlled to not being version-controlled, however the parent collection isn't checked out - returning Conflict with error condition DAV:cannot-modify-checked-in-parent seems to be a valid approach, however doesn't fit optimally (because the request was sent to /vhr/123, and /a -- which causes the error as not bein checked out -- isn't a parent collection of the request URI).  </s>
