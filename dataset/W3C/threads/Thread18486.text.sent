We may need to think about what we mean when we say that one checkpoint is an "important special case" of another checkpoint. 
I have identified one case in which a P3 checkpoint (checkpoint 9.6) is said to be an "important special case" of a P2 checkpoint (checkpoint 9.3). 
This seems illogical, since I would think that an important special case of a P2 checkpoint would be either P2 or P1. 
I did not find other cases of "important special case" that have this possible contradiction. 
I don't think this is a contradiction. 
I think that "important special case" means that a concept deserves its own checkpoint, but I don't think that it's related to priorities.

I tend to think of a special case as a 'subset' or a closer look at something and that an 'important' special case would be at least as important in terms of 'priority'..... Maybe we should say that checkpoint 9.6 (P3) is an "_unimportant_ special case" of checkpoint 9.3 (P2)....!? From: Ian Jacobs [mailto:ij@w3.org]
