<s> such things - but since we've known each other a long time - let me give you a quick response -- I personally believe that the single most interesting thing about the web is that symbol grounding (in web space) is doable, and that it is what the semantic web is based on in almost every respect (although I think many in the SW community don't realize it yet).  </s>
<s> You might want to take some time to wander through Tim Berners-Lee's writings about web design [1] - and particularly his ideas about why URIs are so important and how they can be used to anchor meaning (start with [2] and follow links).  </s>
<s> I think you'll see stuff relating to a lot of your interests -- the mapping to your definitions of symbol grounding are not immediate and 1-1, but I think you'll see a lot of interesting work there.  </s>
<s> I wish I had more time to discuss this with you in detail, but I'm busy trying to build the SW and not worrying as much about the philosophy and meaning as some people would like.  </s>
<s> Pat Hayes is very involved, he'd be a great foil for discussion of this stuff... [1] http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/ [2] http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Meaning.html  </s>

<s> Subject: The Syntactic Web X-ECS-MailScanner: Found to be clean Hi Michael!  </s>
<s> Your paper:  </s>
<s> Title: Where are the Semantics on the Semantic Web?  </s>
<s> looks very interesting (and I wish I could be there!).  </s>
<s> I have some questions (based on the abstract -- if you have links to full text, please send them to me!):  </s>
<s> In this paper, we address the question: How can we create a network of semantically integrated communities on the World Wide Web?  </s>
<s> We first clarify some confusion about what "semantics" means and introduce a semantic continuum ranging from the kind of semantics that exist on the Web today to a rich semantic infrastructure on the Semantic Web of the future.  </s>
<s> We clarify what is meant by "semantic integration" introducing and defining a "gold standard" whereby two agents that have never met before can successfully exchange information.  </s>
<s> As far as I can tell, this is about coordinating the symbol use of many (at least two) symbol-systems (software agents).  </s>
<s> Coordinated symbol use is certainly potentially very useful -- but it seems to me it is not semantics!  </s>
<s> Semantics involves 2 more components (actually 3, but the 3rd, conscious meaning, we'd better ignore!): (1) The real objects (referents) to which symbols refer (2) The means by which the symbols are connected to their referents  </s>
<s> We acknowledge that this gold standard will only be reachable in limited circumstances, and that a variety of approaches will be needed to achieve successful agent interaction in practical situations on the semantic Web.  </s>
<s> Towards this end, we introduce several architectures for achieving semantic integration.  </s>
<s> Each are defined and compared on the basis of how the following questions are answered.  </s>
<s> Who and when are semantic mappings created between agent ontologies?  </s>
<s> As is (to some no doubt yawnfully) well-known in ECS, I've always had problems understanding the notion of "ontologies": They seem to be used in computation with a meaning almost diametrically the opposite of their dictionary (or philosophical, for this is a term from philosophy) meaning: The dictionary meaning of ontology is: What there is, what exists, what "reality" actually contains.  </s>
<s> Examples of things there are would be people, chairs, storms, September 11 etc.  </s>
<s> (i.e., concrete objects, states, events) plus greeness, roundness, differentiable functions, prime numbers (i.e., parts and features of concrete objects, as well as abstract properties).  </s>
<s> Examples of things there AREN'T would be unicorns (I don't mean pictures of unicorns, I mean the creatures themselves), tachyons (particles that move faster than light: ruled out by current-best physics theory, when last heard from) and squared-circles (provably impossible).  </s>
<s> But the thing to notice is that "ontology" means those very objects, states, etc. (that exist).  </s>
<s> (It can also mean a theory of which things exist, Occam's razor, etc., but let's forget about that meta-theoretic notion of ontology here.) In terms of the above, an ontology would contain (1), above, the actual objects to which symbols (words) refer.  </s>
<s> And the symbol-grounding problem (the one I work on, on and off) is the problem of how to connect symbols to the real objects to which they refer.  </s>
<s> For otherwise, mere symbol/symbol connections are "ungrounded" -- their mean is not intrinsic to the symbol system, but needs to be "projected" on them by the mind of an external interpreter.  </s>
<s> Now, for coordinating the exchanges of software agents it may not be necessary to worry about the symbol-grounding problem at all.  </s>
<s> A great deal of mileage might be derivable from symbol/symbol interactions alone, without worrying about their meanings.  </s>
<s> Here "ontology" would simply be a set of symbols that REFERS TO objects; not the objects themselves.  </s>
<s> But then my only question is: Why would anyone want to call that semantics, rather than the SYNTAX that it really is?  </s>
<s> Syntax is the (algorithmic) manipulation of symbols purely on the basis of their SHAPES (which are arbitrary in relation to their meanings, they are merely a notational convention), not on the basis of their MEANINGS.  </s>
<s> "Semantics" is defined precisely in contrast to syntax: Syntax is symbol-shape-manipulation, independent of meaning (apart from what an external interpreter might project onto the symbols and manipulations).  </s>
<s> Semantics is defined as what it is that the symbols actually mean (i.e., (1) and (2) above).  </s>
<s> Is the architecture point to point between each agents, or mediated through another ontology?  </s>
<s> What is the nature of agreements among the agents?  </s>
<s> We conclude by making some predictions and reccomendations on how the semantic Web will evolve in the coming years.  </s>
<s> I have no doubt that your algorithms will help coordinate the interactions of software agents (i.e., of dynamic symbol systems, plus data, i.e., static symbol systems).  </s>
<s> But I wonder why everyone does not call the "Semantic Web" what it really is: the SYNTACTIC WEB!  </s>
<s> If the syntactic manipulation of ungrounded symbols is sufficient to accomplish all the things it accomplishes (in terms of coherent, semantically interpretable -- by us -- symbols and symbolic agent-interactions), then why not give the credit where the credit is due: to the syntax, not the "semantics"?  </s>

<s> Hi Jim, Nice to hear from you again!  </s>
<s> First, as I admire your and Tim's work, I want to make it clear that this is merely a "semantic" disagreement (about the semantics of "semantic"), and not (necessarily) a philosophical disagreement -- and certainly not a practical disagreement about the nature or value of the work.  </s>
<s> I think the URL you sent me says it all: "Grounding the meaning of a document in URI space" (or, as you put it, "symbol grounding (in web space)": That's grounding symbols in symbols, not symbols in their meanings!  </s>
<s> So all I'm saying is that "The Syntactic Web" would have been literally the right descriptor -- and still further testimony to how much semantically interpretable mileage can be gotten out of pure syntax alone!  </s>
<s> No shame in that!  </s>
<s> Cheers, Stevan PS The "Semantically Intrepretable Web" would be another straightforward way of putting it, without needlessly turning the meaning of "grounding" (or of "meaning") on its head...  </s>

<s> [snip] Hi folks, I stumbled across this thread on www-archive (an archival rather than discussion list :) but since I've longstanding interest in both RDF and the 'symbol grounding' debate, I can't resist jumping in.  </s>
<s> Steven, I share your concern that some folk are using the word 'meaning' in an over-generous sense, and that much of what we've done with RDF and OWL has been in the world of abstract syntactic structures.  </s>
<s> The piece of the puzzle that connects those to society and human practice is far from clear, at this stage.  </s>
<s> URIs are important, but don't provide the entire story.  </s>
<s> We claim that RDF has propositional content, but don't (yet?  </s>
<s> ever?) enumerate the factors relevant to fixing (and discovering) that content.  </s>
<s> Given an infinitely well funded scientist and an RDF document, how would s/he set about working out what the content of the document was, and whether it was true?  </s>
<s> (for related grumblings re role of model theories, see The closest we get to this topic in the RDF specs is a paragraph in our most recent working draft, RDF/XML documents, i.e. encodings of RDF graphs, can be used to make representations of claims or assertions about the 'real' world.  </s>
<s> RDF graphs may be asserted to be true, and such an assertion should be understood to carry the same social import and responsibilities as an assertion in any other format.  </s>
<s> A combination of social (e.g. legal) and technical machinery (protocols, file formats, publication frameworks) provide the contexts that fix the intended meanings of the vocabulary of some piece of RDF, and which distinguish assertions from other uses (e.g. citations, denals or illustrations).  </s>
<s> Nailing down more details of this 'combination of social and technical machinery' will be tricky (to put it mildly), but is critical if we want RDF documents to be the sort of thing people can wave around in court.  </s>
<s> Or, more generally, that can be used as records of obligations and commitments... Sorry to jump in.  </s>
<s> Maybe we could move this thread to www-rdf-interest@w3.org?  </s>
