I've got a problem with how I'm thinking about lists. 
I first came across it reviewing the primer, but I've got the same problem in schema. 
We say that the domain of rdf:first is rdf:List. 
My problem is whether the resource at the blunt end of an rdf:first property denotes (ok we are not doing the semantics but this is just about how I should think of this) a whole list, or just a link in a chain? 
I've been thinking of it as a link in a chain, and so the term rdf:List is misleading. 
But if it really denotes the whole list then there is nothing for me to worry about. 
Brian Some of the very little lisp I did a while ago has come back to me, and I think I'm ok with this now. 
Brian As it stands, I think it denotes just the "link", which (if the graph is true) happens to be related by rdf:rest to the next link in the list. 
I guess the name is misleading; I'm agnostic about changing it.
