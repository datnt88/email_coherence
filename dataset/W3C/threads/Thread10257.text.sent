This is a last call comment concerning the test case schema which I am making wearing the hat of an OWL Test Case editor. 
(Sorry I should have made this comment earlier). 
Within OWL Tests we reuse the RDF testSchema. 
Unfortunately the rdfs:comment-s within it, do not foresee such reuse. 
For example test:issue should be described as relating a test to an issue, rather than a test to an RDF Core issue. 
Please generalize the comments on the following resources test:approval test:issue test:status e.g. rdfs:comment xml:lang="en" Indicates the status of the test according to RDF Core WG process. 
/rdfs:comment = rdfs:comment xml:lang="en" Indicates the status of the test within a process, such as the RDF Core WG process. 
/rdfs:comment Jeremy Carroll, Editor OWL Test Cases I think doing so makes a lot of sense. 
I need some indication from chair or process expert as to whether this change should be done immediately (since the schema lives "outside" the LC WD) or at the end of LC process.

/rdfs:comment Jeremy Carroll, Editor OWL Test Cases As far as I can see, such a change seems both reasonable and timely. 
We're not going REC-track with this vocabulary, it's a means to support our ends (like Lbase in that respect, or Dublin Core, if we used DC in any of our RDF files). 
Unless someone else objects, I reckon 'go for it'... Dan Sounds like a go ahead to do this Jan. 
Its borderline whether its editors discretion or not, but I think its ok. 
You should respond on comments, on the same thread, accepting the change, adding [closed] to the subject line. 
I'm not planning to allocate an ID for this one.
