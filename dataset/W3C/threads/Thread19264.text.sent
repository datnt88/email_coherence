If you want to add your new dialogue it's urgent now to do it. 
Do you need some help?

I can commit the changes, I just need to know wha tthe right words are in languages other than english. 
Otherwise I might wait until the next release, and try to get some time inm Grenoble to work and have some other important accessibility things happen at the same time.
