I have begun fleshing out the template for a thesaurus task force. 
The URI is http://www.w3.org/2004/03/thes-tf/mission although it looks someone close to the original template. 
I've drafted some objectives, short-term and long-term (the latter in terms of document outputs). 
If you send comments, please cite version number. 
I don't have a list of members yet. 
Who would like to participate in this TF? Dan 
Hi All, Just a general q on the scope of the ADTF (was discussing this w/ Libby on 
irc) - does the ADTF see itself doing serious software development or will 
it be mainly pointing to existing cool apps/demos? 
Though the latter seems more reasonable to do, my concern is that most of the existing stuff 
might not be based on 'best-practice' theory/principles proposed in our 
TF drafts, and hence some sample applications based on our illustrative 
examples would be really useful. 
Even if this means some serious software dev, I don't mind joining in:) Ofcourse, the problem will be finding some 
really useful and somewhat generic real-world scenarios for which we provide complete semweb apps Cheers, Aditya

Hello, I suppose that creating an Ontology is not software development ? 
Anyway, perhaps that we can split the task into 2 phases, one part following more or less the other in time. 
First phase : we can reasonnabily hope that it will be possible through the activities of the other task to gather/define some well defined key point. 
I think than more than code we will mostly have (possibly small) parts of ontologies , perhaps some architecture use case description, and a very small number of "ready" to run code. 
Second phase : for each key point we can : - try to look for existing (pieces of) application/ontologies which can illustrate the point (but I agree with Aditya for "most of the existing stuff might not be based on 'best-practice' theory/principles proposed in our TF drafts" - try to look for existing (pieces of) application/ontologies which are more or less perfect illustrations of the "problem" that the point try to solve and for which we need a relative small investment for the WG members to "upgrade" it. 
- In the case we don't succeed in the first two points, try to evaluate the necessary work to developp something by by ourselves and try to find volunteers (i could be one of this). 
Anyway,i think that more than code it's a matter of Ontologies don't you think ? 
or if you prefer, except for a few case like dealing with enormous onotologies and perhaps resolving URI/URL , it's not really a matter of software (architecture) engineering. 
Note : I'm actually working for two projects : a pure KM project an a project relative to virtual organisations and firms. 
In both we are going to use SW technologies (but i don't know if our protoypes will be SW applications). 
I hope and i would like to work in way that their outputs will be good examples of good/best practices Thank you very much Best regards marco NANNI PS : I apologize for my bad comprehension of english during the last telcons but i must say that it's generally difficult for me and it was quite impossible with an IP telephone.So 
I hope, i haven't missed too much things and that i haven't too much ridiculous in my interventions. 
Thanks

Please count me in the potential participants for this TF. FYI I am invited to speak, among other topics, about Thesaurus, Ontologies and Semantic 
Web, at the Environmental Thesaurus/Terminology Workshop organized in Geneva by UN 
Environment Programme Regional Office of Europe, next week (April 14-15). 
BTW this 
conflicts with next WG meeting :( See http://ecoinfo.eionet.eu.int/ 
This workshop will focus on integration of environment terminologies and thesauri provided by UN organizations such as FAO (AGROVOC Thesaurus), UNEP (ENVOC Thesaurus), UNESCO ... 
and European Agencies like EEA (GEMET Thesaurus), and relevant technologies for such an 
integration. 
Representatives of those organisations, and more, will be present, and I 
think it's a good opportunity for outreach. 
I hope to bring some people from there into 
the game, or at least making them more aware of what it is about. 
Consider it as a preliminary action I take for this TF :) Bernard Vatant Senior Consultant Knowledge Engineering Mondeca - www.mondeca.com

From the April 1 minutes: ACTION DanBri get rdf-thes contacts from Guus Jan Wielemaker, best-known as developer of SWI-Prolog, is willing to participate in this task force. 
He brings in our Amsterdam experience with porting thesauri like WordNet, AAT, ULAN and MeSH.

At the workshop announced in the below message, we had the opportunity, with Alistair Miles, to present ongoing work in the SW, including SWBPD and SWAD Europe, and relevancy of SW technologies to deal with the environment terminology issues. 
There was a great interest in those presentations from workshop participants (40-50 people). 
The output of this very fruitful meeting was the creation of a new entity called ECOTERM (legal status and charter pending) of which objective will be to provide tools and framework for coordination, interoperability and availability on the Web of KOS legacy (thesauri, vocabularies, ontologies ...) in the domain of environment at large. 
Most interestingly, part of the consensus was to consider Semantic Web technologies and languages as most relevant tools to achieve those goals, and interest in cooperation/liaison with SWBPD WG has been formally expressed in the meeting final agreement document. 
IMO, this is an extremely interesting opportunity to test SW in a large, real world, multilingual, multidisciplinary and general interest use case. 
To be continued ...

Just to back Bernard up on this, and point the WG to a write up I did of the ECOTERM workshop (which includes links to related resources): Alistair.
