I have been experimenting with Dia (actually the windows version: http://dia-installer.sourceforge.net/ ) and this is meant to produce SVG files, which it does, but they start with !DOCTYPE svg PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD SVG 20000802//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/CR-SVG-20000802/DTD/svg-20000802.dtd" Which is not the 1.0 scheme as described on the SVG page: When I put the images into Amaya they come up almost invisible. 
I have tried changing the header in one file to agree with the 1.0 spec to fudge this, but it still displays incorrectly. 
So the question is: "is the bug in Amaya, in Dia, or are they using incompatible SVG specs?". 
To answer that I need a validator for SVG, but I cannot find one. 
Is this because there isn't one, or have I just not found it yet? 
If there is one, I can check the images are valid before asking anything else, otherwise, would the Amaya team like to have such an image to explore? 
Hugh This is not a Dia Bug. 
Dia's export filter seems to work pretty well, based on the august SVG specification, before that SVG 1.0 was released as a recommandation. 
That's why Doctype declaration differs. 
Amaya recognizes Dia's SVG, but the current implementation of SVG in Amaya is not yet complete. 
The Dialog named "Parsing error", that can be accessed from the view menu, diplays warnings for unsupported SVG tags in Amaya. 
There isn't any SVG validator for now. 
Regards, Paul Thank you. 
I think that answers everything I need to know at the moement.
