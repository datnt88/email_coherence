Hi Mike, 
Rohit, Henrik, Roy, Henry and I discussed this topic during the LA IETF last week, and came to the conclusion that the workshop is still very much worth holding. 
I can understand your concerns about the community of participants not being large enough or different enough from the HTTP-NG group to have a 
good discussion during the workshop, but there are several reason why I feel the workshop is still a very good idea. 
Addressing the lack of diversity concern, given that Rohit and I aren't part of the HTTP-NG effort yet have significant views on this topic, and since I Hugh Davis will bring a new an interesting perspective from the Open Hypermedia community, I tend to think there will be sufficient diversity of opinion at the workshop. 
Furthermore, we expect to gather a few latecomers to the workshop based on discussions we had at the LA IETF. 
One area where I think there can be much fruitful discussion at the workshop are the impact(s) of providing WebDAV support in HTTP-NG, since I don't feel the HTTP-NG group has had a full DAV advocate, and our experience with WebDAV is that there are several suboptimal choices that are made when you "bolt-on" to a non-DAV aware protocol like HTTP/1.1. 
Providing WebDAV support is far more complicated than the bullet on this topic in the "Goals" document. 
I'm currently working on my position paper on this very subject, but support for WebDAV has far reaching effects, including: - support for operations which affect more than one resource (e.g., have a source and a destination like MOVE and COPY) - operations which operate on a hierarchy of resources - operations which have a source and a destination and which operate over a hierarchy (e.g., COPY hierarchy A to B) - improved error reporting (the error could be on the source, or the destination, or both simultaneously) - error reporting precedence rules for handling cases where multiple simultaneous errors can occur - interactions between parameter encoding issues like extensibility, internationalization and ease of rapid parsing for security issues, or server efficiency - strong precondition evaluation support - caching of parts of resources, like properties - support for searching, and a new kind of resource, the "arbiter" - a data model which distinguishes between active (e.g., CGI, ASP, etc. and static resources) Many of these issues are not explicity addressed in the "Goals" document. 
So, my feeling is, though the turnout is less than expected, the "right" people are attending, and I expect the resulting discussion to be of high quality, more than justifying the expenditure of a day.

I'm given to understand that the signups for this workshop consist mainly 
of 
HTTP-NG folks and Australian on-lookers (I saw Jim's note saying Hugh 
Davis 
will be there for part of the day, but this is the only exception to the 
above 
rule that I'm aware of). 
This leads me to doubt whether much actual work 
can 
be done. 
Perhaps we should disband this workshop, freeing the 
participants to 
find a more productive use of the time? 
Group, 
I feel very strongly that the HTTP-NG working group at WWW7 should proceed. 
The main reason for my attending WWW7 is to get an idea of the direction that the HTTP protocol is taking. 
I recently became one of the people on my webserver development team to follow HTTP, become involved in standards groups concerning 
HTTP, and implement the new specs. 
FYI-The webserver is Domino Go Webserver which formally was IBM's Internet Connection Server. 
The benefits of a meeting like this will be much more substantial for myself than those of you who have been working with HTTP and many other Internet related ventures for years. 
Many of you have so much information to offer, please do not keep all of your experience and knowledge to yourselves. 
If you say RTFM then well I have been reading so much that I am single again. 
So I ask those of you who have so much to contribute to please attend the HTTP-NG workshop. 
If for some reason some of you do not attend the workshop, then please do not be unreachable during the conference. 
As I would like meet--to go out to dinner with--talk with--learn from some or all of you during the up coming conference. 
I am currently on the plane to California, and then to Sydney today ( 8 April 98 ). 
So the availability to my IBM mail in the next couple of days is undeterminable. 
However, please reply with any comments or status of the working group.

The workshop is definitely on. 
We have about 25 people and seven talks scheduled. 
Jim Whitehead and I have prepared a detailed schedule, but for now, here's an outline: (talks are generally 15 minutes each) Opening Remarks - EJW "We have met the enemy, and it is HTTP" - RK "Goals for HTTP-NG" - Mike Spreitzer break "High performance HTTP" - Spencer Dawkins, Nortel "Delta-encoding" - Fred Douglis lunch "Collaborative authoring support for the next generation" - EJW "Rights Management" - Shane Owenby break "Open Hypermedia Protocol" - Hugh Davis Closing Remarks - HFN plus a few roundtable sections on other requirements. 
I am confident this will be a productive day to think more widely about the future of HTTP than just the -NG prototypes from W3C and Spero's proposal. 
Discussion will center around Deployment, Programmability, Performance, Collaborative services, and Hypermedia application requirements. 
Rohit Khare 
Rohit, I'm looking forward to presenting at WWW7, but a better title for my talk is something like "A Systems View of client-agent-server computing and HTTP-NG", or (since most of these talks have nice, punchy titles) "Putting ten pounds of HTML in a five-pound bag". 
Just so no one thinks I'm talking about "HTTP on Cray/OS"! 
Spencer Dawkins, Nortel 
I'll assume you meant "ten lbs. 
of _HTTP_ in a five lb. 
bag" :-) The schedule I just sent out is provisional, and yes, we did pin a name on your talk out of the blue. 
The intent is that during the day, each talk kicks off themed discussion -- in the case of your statement, about network-layer performance and integration opportunities. 
Please feel free to retitle the talk -- nothing's binding -- but I just wanted to illuminate where we were coming from. 
Thanks, Rohit Khare
