<s> I think, this is a question for the UA-Guidelines.  </s>
<s> So if we have a relationsship proposal, this will be then considered by the UA-TF or the WG as a whole under the angle of our current UA-Guidelines proposal.  </s>
<s> 2) We use the term entity (and later in the agent relationship proposal - "agent") without providing sufficient guidance on what this means.  </s>
<s> Rigo suggests there may be ways around this but I think they would be unclear at best and difficult to explain to the end user.  </s>
<s> This suggests to me that point 1) may mean that UAs don't act on this tool if they had it.  </s>
<s> The issue here is that we have already the term agent in our specification, but it is not defined.  </s>
<s> So the concept of agent in a narrow sense already works for the vocab, but not for the PRF.  </s>
<s> I think like general federation is an issue, the term of 'agent' is also an issue.  </s>
<s> Therefor, I suggest we discuss that on the next call.  </s>
<s> 3) I think that there is an issue in that entity is today defined at the policy level.  </s>
<s> A PRF for a host can reference 2 distinct policies each of 2 distinct entities (data controllers) - how then can there be meaning to say at the PRF level this entity is the same as anything else?  </s>
<s> The same as which of the 2?  </s>
<s> This assumption is not quite correct.  </s>
<s> A PRF can point to a multitude of policies with different entities being responsible.  </s>
<s> So the question is, whether the element known-hosts should go at the top level or one level down into the policy about='uri' It is not impossible, that an entity is having their own site and getting some service from some other site.  </s>
<s> IMHO, this is rather common, if you get counting service, database inclusion etc.  </s>
<s> All depends on whether this is just an independend service used or whether there are contractual relationsships that also include rules for the use of the data collected.  </s>
<s> I think, this is too much overhead as we would have to write another IETF-Draft and push it through their procedures.  </s>
<s> I would rather stick with the PRF-expiry.  </s>
<s> 5) Headers are limited practically by the number of same hosts that they can declare.  </s>
<s> Also declaring multiple "same-entity" relationships would presumably require a validation against each full policy prior to accepting the accuracy of the header declaration.  </s>
<s> This is somewhat illogical, as, IF we where to accept the performance hit of policy prefetching, then we would have no need for CPs! Jack rightly points out that we may only need to validate against the PRF and not the policy - but I think that I may have brought that into question with point 3).  </s>
<s> Also note, that in case of headers, the evaluation is real time and does not need all the caching.  </s>
<s> In this case, it is easier to just evaluate the header CP that comes anyway instead of adding complicated agent relationsships.  </s>
<s> The relationsship proposal should not serve to circumvent shortcomings of the compact format that lead to blocking of cookies because they contain an overstatement leading to unacceptable policies.  </s>
<s> This should be solved in another way.  </s>
<s> It shouldn't be possible to hide a bad practice behind a good policy and some complex domain relationsships.  </s>
<s> 6) Again on the topic of CPs, once a same entity relationship has been established between cookie (set by A) and site B from which an asset appears, how they can a same entity relationship be established from a subsequent replay on site C (provided that PRFs or policies) for all these sites do indeed declare each other as same entity?  </s>
<s> Again, third party cookies are not a concept of P3P! P3P distinguishes between cookies with acceptable policy and those that haven't an acceptable policy.  </s>
<s> You try to solve the wrong problem here.  </s>
<s> Or P3P in 1.1 should accept and incorporate the notion of third party content and state on this.  </s>
<s> If you wish to discuss it, raise it on the mailing-list.  </s>
<s> Nice example for further improvements.. But this is rather a tip for implementers than a direct thing for the specification.  </s>
<s> Best, Rigo  </s>
