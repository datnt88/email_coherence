To the lasting disappointment of the humorists among us, the name squot was dropped in favor of apos, which occurs in 8879 Annex D, set ISOnum, as do the others. 
Note that  is a single quote, which does not occur in ASCII. 
(many implementations include a single quote at position 39 instead of an apostrophe, but this is in error) The apostrophe is normally the same as an open single quote, but this is not necessarily so. 
Hence, &amp;apos; is the correct entitiy for the ASCII ' character, as far as I can tell. 
I am very pleased with the decision to reduce the list of predefined entities to a manageable number. 
I'm not actually sure why any beyong and &amp;amp; are needed, although  is good for symmetry. 
The current situation is so much of an improvement that it seems almost churlish to ask this, but why is &amp;apos; included when it is not recognised in plain text?

from HTML 2.0 (RFC 1866): &amp;#34; Quotation mark op.cit., '13. 
The HTML Coded Character Set': &amp;#34; Quotation mark &amp;#39; Apostrophe Why do you say  is a single quote? 
ASCII 34 is a double quote.

Sorry if I wasn't clear. 
is defined as [single] quotation mark in ISO8879:1986(e) D.4.3.1, ENTITIES Numeric and Special Graphic, along with lsquo and rsquo for open and close single quote and apos for apostrophe. 
Joan Smith's book gives a squot as a single quote. 
The standard doesn't say which it is, only that it is a quotation mark, but the 10646 draft I have uses QUOTATION MARK for a double quote. 
I don't know which interpretation is correct, butif RFC1866 has quot being a double quote, we'd better stick with it. 
I still don't yet see why we need an entitiy for it. 
If it had been an SDATA entity, it would have been useful for escaping markup, but my understanding is that there are no SDATA dentities in XML. 
But I'm probably confused... (I think this works for &amp; because Ee isn't a NAME START character) Lee On Thu, 14 Nov 1996 20:54:23 -0500 lee@sq.com 
said: The documentation I checked said it's a typewriter double quote, ASCII x21 or whatever. 
Unfortunately I can't remember what doc that was; what's your source? 
ISO 10646 and other ISO character sets uniformly use 'quotation mark' -- which is what the comment in the entity set says -- for the " symbol, and 'apostrophe' for the ' symbol, and 'grave accent' (and possibly something else indicating its use as an open single quote) for the ` character. 
That seems to me reason enough to believe the  should be treated as ", and &amp;apos; as '. providing quot and apos makes it possible for attribute values to contain both characters; it also allows the user to choose which delimter to use, if they prefer to use the same one all the time. 
Strictly speaking, one would have sufficed. 
It is recognized in literals and may need to be escaped there.

quot is defined as in 8879 as quotation mark, which is ISO standard name for the ASCII " character. 
HTML also defines quot as the ASCII " character. 
gt is included because ]] is recognized even outside marked sections. 
apos and quot are included for escaping LIT and LITA in literals.
