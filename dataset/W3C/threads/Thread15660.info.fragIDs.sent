When responding to the list - please don't continue to include people who you know are on the list in the email addresses. 
They will already get a copy from the list.

We'll get right on that once you and others learn to quit top-posting-- an *actual* problem. 
In the case you're complaining about, people get two copies of a single message. 
Big deal. 
Were you unaware that many people read the Web version and aren't Loved the ALL-CAPS SUBJECT. 
Way to defend those netiquette protocols!

For what it's worth, Gregg, when I hit "Reply" in MS Outlook, the reply goes *only* to the individual sender of the message; when I hit "Reply all," the reply goes to both the list *and* the individual sender. 
I can't find anything in the Options that will let me configure this, and none of the other lists I'm on behave in quite the same way. 
So maybe it's something about the way the listserv is configured? 
(Well, and then of course there's the "broken user agent" problem, i.e., Outlook, but that's another story).
