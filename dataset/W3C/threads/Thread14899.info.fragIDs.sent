Hi all; I'm writing up the code for screenshots on my five assigned units for the "CSS Techniques for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2." document. 
I'm responsible for the first sections of this document: 1. Fonts 2. Color 3. Units of Measure 4. Text style effects 5. 
Text instead of images My question: does anyone know of a list of CSS Level 1 and Level 2 property values that also cross-reference the property the value can be used in? 
Here's my dilemma: I'm identifying the proper use of color, according to the CSS Recommendations and that demonstrate the WCAG 2.0 CSS Techniques document. 
It makes sense, I think, to hit the use of color as an attribute of (insert CSS property here: font, border, background, etc...). 
To accomplish this, each of the five areas I'm taking has a large table with the CSS Property and associated values below them. 
Columns across are links to the screenshots - all using the same code so we can compare user agent support. 
However, for me to crawl through both the CSS Recommendations in search of every instance of a color value ... you get the picture grin . 
Hoping someone has seen such a reference so I can cut the research for these tables and screen shots down considerably. 
Thanks! Have a good weekend.

joel you could try the evaluation version of TopStyle which may contain the reference you require. 
or the equivalent from Western Civilization This is the other place that may be useful Cheers Graham

Joel, isn't this part of the CSS 2 specification already? 
There is a table of properties that lists what kinds of values they can take, so maybe I am not sure what you mean.

I hereby hand this over to Libby to make some sense out of. 
I'm a ruthless so-and-so sometimes :-) 
Ugh, ruthlessness isn't in my nature :-) 
The goal is "properties listed by what value types they take". 
To go this extra step further, you'll have to decide whether or not it's worth losing the structuring information on the value lists. 
At the moment, I have kept the structure intact:- :counter-increment :values "[ identifier integer ? 
]+ | none | inherit" . 
However, it would be possible to modify the RegExp a bit further [1] to produce:- :counter-increment :values v:identifier, v:integer, v:none, v:inherit . 
which would then be queryable, but would lose the structure altogether. 
The next step would be to model the CSS value list syntax in RDF... that would require quite a bit more work, but might be worth it if this were going to be used in a serious application. 
Cheers, [1] Use something like r'(\w+?)'.

Yes, that struck me as the next step too. 
Breaking out the regexp looks useful, exploring the use of rdfs:range instead of 'values' as the property is the harder bit. 
I suspect it'd throw up some interesting issues (which may or not be interesting to this group ;-) 
Similarly, appliesTo is currently rather prosy. 
In RDF I'd be tempted to use rdfs:domain for this though that'd require defining classes for the (HTML? 
XHTML? 
XML?) elements the styles can be applied to. 
At this point I should admit to not having got my head around the application of CSS to 
generic XML markup (as against using it with HTML, where we're in more tightly defined territory). 
The range/domain stuff probably isn't necessary for the immediate goal of listing properties by the values they take, while breaking out the regex 
probably is. 
I'd also make the RDF define each CSS property as an RDF property explicitly, so other RDF/sw apps could re-use them. 
A practical application of this might be extending the 'circle and arrow diagrams using stylesheet rules' work by DanC, see: properties and classes for styling information (color etc). 
Why would a WAI group be interested in this? 
Imagine if everyone modeled (as per DanC's example) their organisational chart info in RDF, so it could be 
queried, re-used etc., derrriving visual presentations of if using RDF rules 
and the styling vocab. 
Right now, most of the org chart data I encounter seems to be primarily available as PNG/JPEG or MS Powerpoint, with associated accessibility difficulties... Dan 
"Applies to" is difficult because for some values there are no strictly machine readable definitions (e.g. "all elements, but see prose"), and for others, you can't implement it as a domain, because the solution for what this property applies to may be based on other property values (e.g. "positioned elements"), or something else. 
Well, in that case the domain would be the set of selected elements that has these certain properties applied to it. 
By "defining classes for the elements", you're of course right, and this would mean modelling CSS2 selectors in RDF... obviously, because if you want to use this as other-than-documentation-only, then you're going to want to port all of CSS2 over to RDF. 
out 
the regex probably is. 
Yeah... 
Good point... 
I should have specified a schema for it; here's a fragment of it that will cover your concern:- :inherited rdfs:domain css:Property . 
css:Property rdfs:subClassOf rdf:Property . 
Same domain for all the properties... css:Property [ daml:inverseOf rdfs:domain ] :values, :initialValue, :appliesTo, :inherited, :percentages, :mediaGroups . 
I'm not even going to bother with the ranges: just let me know when RDF Core is decided on what it wants to do with datatypes! 
Let's charter a new WG! :-) Kindest Regards, Sean B. Palmer @prefix : http://webns.net/roughterms/ .
