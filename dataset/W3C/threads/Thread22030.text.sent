I've made some changes to the DOM HTML Level2 test suite and committed them to the CVS. 
build.xml 
- changed to accommodate new spec and also dom-spec.xml 
file no longer exists in the DOM2-HTML.zip 
file dom-to-dtd.xsl 
added xmlns parameter to metadata The following tests changed due to attribute type changes in the spec. 
HTMLAppletElement07 HTMLAppletElement09 HTMLBaseFontElement03 HTMLImageElement04 HTMLObjectElement11 HTMLObjectElement16 Thanks Rick Looking through the DOM L2 Core branch, I realized my commit has some problems; instead of the IBM tests I updated existing tests that obviously had the same name. 
Trying to add the IBM tests to the L2/core directory fails on my local setup and hence on the CVS repository as well. 
I need to freshen up my CVS skills, obviously. 
/Dimitris Additional changes to test suite. 
***** HTMLButtonElement08 test changed below is the telecon minutes from 09/20/02 supporting the change 5. file:///C:/cygwin/home/Administrator/2001/DOM-Test-Suite/build/level2/html/ecmascript/tests/HTMLButtonElement08.html:HTMLButtonEleme nt08 failed Comment: The value attribute specifies the current control value. 
Retrieve the value attribute and examine it's value. 
Johnny: The tests has a button value="foo" bar /button and it expects .value to be "foo" even if the button is displayed with the text "bar" in it. 
Mozilla returns "foo" and IE returns "bar". 
Rob: the initial value of the button should be the content of the button element. 
you first set the value and then you use the content. 
Glenn: so if you change the value, do you change the text node? 
Rob: don't know. 
Glenn: I view this as setting the display of the button, no the value. 
Glenn: the value of the name returned should be original Johnny: if you submit, you submit what's visible. 
Philippe: sounds like to be more an HTML problem than a DOM problem. 
Johnny: we can say that we won't define which value will be sent. 
Mary: should we remove the test? 
Johnny: no, it should accept both value as ok. 
ACTION Johnny: to clarify HTMLButtonElement.value in the specification. 
Brad: You can probably reference the value. 
it doesn't say what happen. 
Johnny: we can try to make it consistency with how we deal with options value. 
***** HTMLIsIndexElement03 test changed below is the telecon minutes from 09/20/02 supporting the change 13. file:///C:/cygwin/home/Administrator/2001/DOM-Test-Suite/build/level2/html/ecmascript/tests/HTMLIsIndexElement03.html:HTMLIsIndexEle ment03 failed Comment: The prompt attribute specifies the prompt message. 
Retrieve the prompt attribute of the 1st isindex element and examine its value. 
Johnny: IE fails this due to the bug in IE explained in test HTMLIsIndexElement01. IE would pass this test if there was only one isindex element in this test. 
"Asize" Expected 2 (number) but was 1 (number) ACTION: Rick will rewrite the test to avoid problem from test HTMLIsIndexElement01.
