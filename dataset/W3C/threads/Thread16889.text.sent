I've always used ID and HEADER attributes when creating accessible data tables, but after reading the Access Board's bit for 508 compliant tables, I might user SCOPE instead. 
From what they say SCOPE is as widely recognised by user agents and it is definitely easier to implement. 
Any thoughts on why we don't all simply use SCOPE and code our tables in a tenth of the time?

Browser makers implemented headers first, so that is what people started recomending. 
When browser makers didn't implement scope people got laughed at for suggesting using it (understandable really) with the result that people who write sites got given the hard way first, and had to wait for the simple solution to be useful. 
Unfortunately (but again understanably really) users don't change their systems very often. 
So you don't get to take advantage of the newer features (well in terms of implementation - these were all proposed in '96 or '97) to make your life easier until users go through the process of upgrading, unless you are happy leaving a whole lot of users in the cold. 
Chaals Use ID and HEADERS. 
SCOPE is still not implemented widely enough to merit your relying on it at this time. 
This was the report of Ken Nakata and Doug Wakefield to the FedStats workshop of accessible tables as recently as the end of June. 
The 508 materials you refer to are older, hopeful, and not yet valid as reflecting implemented technology. 
You should regard what Ken and Doug reported to the FedStats workshop as a clarification with regard to the earlier technical information from the Access Board. 
Al I fear, Steve, that if you ask 5 different experts you'll get 5 very different answers. 
Below I have pasted a listing on how HPR, Window-Eyes and JAWS support various forms of table markup - these results are for versions a few months ago. 
The bottom line is that for programmatic identification of table headings, TH with scope is best because it is simplest and is supported as well as headers and id's. 
If the table is complex ("more than one Logical level of row and column headers") then your must use headers and id's because headings will not be properly identified with TH and scope. 
The chances of errors and the time required to touch each cell of a data table when using headers/id leads me to recommend that web developers revisit the design of the table; probably it can be simplified, possibly with multiple tables. 
The versions for this test are JFW 4.01, HPR 3.02 and Window-Eyes 4.11. 
1. 
No special markup - row one and column one for headings: JFW, Window-Eyes, HPR. 2. Scope attribute on either TH's or TD's - JFW and HPR. 3. Axis attribute on TH's or TD's - JFW. 4. Use TH for headings - JFW and HPR. 5. Headers attribute with id's specifying heading cells - JFW and HPR. 6. abbr attribute on heading cells - JFW and HPR.

Al at simple features to unless The answers may not be so different as they may sound. 
Let me hasten to say that what we were dealing with primarily in the FedStats meeting would come under Jim's 'complex' category, where HEADERS is the only way [at present] to ensure service to the customer. 
What I don't understand is what the cases are where SCOPE adds value, between tables handled fine by the first-row, first-column heuristic and the cases where HEADERS markup is required to make the connections right. 
At the FedStats Workshop there were multiple vendors showing tools that reduce the time and errors for this considerably. 
You read the table of "tests" correctly. 
The best thing today is to put headings in row one and column one as measured by assistive technology support. 
I tried to be careful and say, "for programmatic identification" use scope and TH. 
There are places where the scope "adds value" and one is in the corner, like row 1 column 1. 
With TH there and without scope, you can't tell whether that heading cell is a column heading or a row heading. 
I hadn't seen Nakata's Power Point Slides before, Thanks. 
They (Doug Wakefield and Ken Nakata) recommend the same as I said in my post - use TH and scope for simple tables and when the table is complex (where TH and scope are inadequate) then use headers/id.

in in laughed people Let me emphasize what Jim said: "If the table is complex ("more than one Logical level of row and column headers") then your must use headers and id's because headings will not be properly identified with TH and scope." 
That is a key point. 
The other point is that the screen readers do a pretty good picking up the top row of column headings and first column of row headings all by themselves, without even TH's - so the real requirement is if you can't design (or re-design) a simple table, use the headers= attribute on complex tables.
