<s> Jon, Howard: I also agree to the extent that ws-chor should not produce something that is complex to use for simple cases.  </s>
<s> The key in adopting new technologies is the "cost of entry" versus the benefits.  </s>
<s> I can speak from a specific experience that it is not that trivial to weight the benefits of BPM/ws-chor concepts with respect to the rigidity of a choreography definition for instance.  </s>
<s> I personally thought that it was clear, but obviously either I was wrong or it was harder for some other people to see these benefits or it required too complex of an infrastructure to deal with.  </s>
<s> It is important to distinguish a design benefit (which do not require a specific run-time implementation, i.e. could still hard code what is going on), from the benefit of a run-time enforcement/execution of the choreography.  </s>
