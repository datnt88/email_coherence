I noticed that went I use back and forth Amaya sometimes seems to get in an idle mode and refuses to display pages from there on. 
Has anyone seeing this behavior? 
On a different topic, How difficult would it be for the Thot library to support SGML? 
Tnks, Amancio In-reply-to: Your message of Wed, 14 May 1997 17:25:19 -0700." 
It seems that your system losts events. 
I don't know why. 
Thot has been designed to manage structured documents and it's a good candidate to provide SGML tools. 
But Thot syntax is not the SGML syntax and Thot uses Structure schemas written in language S instead of SGML dtds. 
Our plan, at W3C, is to support XML instead of SGML.

This is good news ! 
I guess that you use the Java version isn't it ? 
The java version, when interrupted shows amount of HTML code which is available when stopped. 
If empty it displays an empty page, this should be improved. 
This behavious is related with back and forth since when looking for next/previous document, if the current one didn't finished to load, it is interrupted, hence the white page. 
For some reason, sometimes, the next or previous document is not loaded when requesting a series of next and/or back actions. 
and you end-up with a white, empty page ... This is a matter of synchronizing HTTP request initiated from C code with the actual fetching done in the Java V.M. 
The DocumentLoaded global variable can get messed up and from that point new fetchings are not allowed. 
Only solution yet is to not go back and forth too fast :-\ Daniel Daniel Veillard@w3.org | W3C / INRIA Rhone-Alpes | Today's Bookmarks : Daniel.Veillard@inrialpes.fr| 655 av de l'Europe | Linux, WWW, Java, Tel : +33 04 76 61 53 85 | 38330 Montbonnot | badminton, Kaffe, Home: +33 04 76 63 05 86 | http://opera.inrialpes.fr/veillard 
Hi, Yes, I am using the Java version. 
I noticed that in init.c:LoadHTMLDocument, 
amaya gets a little confused with respect to determining if the cache directory is created or not. 
Not sure how to fix it however I would do a stat on the cache directory and if it is not there create one. 
The symptom is that amaya fails to display http:// urls however local files are displayed with no problems. 
Going back and forth with sites , I managed to get this core dump: ine 2055, char 104: Unexpected end tag /FONT Thot tool kit error: element does not match DTD Thot tool kit error: element does not match DTD Thot tool kit error: Element has no box Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.

On a different topic, and the one I am really interested on is why Thot was not originally designed with SGML in mind? 
This is what one of the FreeBSD hackers had to say: jfieber@indiana.edu 
said: when you get a chance, check out http://rah.star-gate.com/ 
languages.html it discusses the theory of their meta language thingy. 
Hm... 
I'm not sure what to think of this. 
They seem to have expended a great deal of effort to re-invent SGML. 
The S language implements most SGML concepts, but in an incompatible form with no obvious advantage over SGML. 
Similarly the P and T languages look to be an implementation of the concepts in DSSSL, although in a more limited fashion. 
So, the philosophy of Thot is more or less the same as SGML and DSSSL almost exactly, but with an independent implementation. 
DSSSL is quite new (1996), but SGML has been around over a decade so I find this re-inventing of the Tnks!
