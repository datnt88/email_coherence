Hi all, What do people know about fuzzy logic? 
It seems that we might want to investigate the topic for the guidelines. 
It is my understanding (this is from a conversation with Bert Bos yesterday) that you take decisions from several sources and factor them together. 
The basic idea is that truth is not black or white but that there are shades of grey. 
You poll a number of sources for their opinion and determine a shade of grey (0 through 1) that gets rounded to final answer that is either 0 or 1. 
For example: Checkpoint 14.1 Use the clearest and simplest language appropriate for a site's content. 
There are many methods to determine the reading level or legibility of a body of text (i don't know that any have been automated). 
We could take the results of several, and combine them in some way to determine the "clarity" of content.

As I understand fuzzy logic it actually adds a bit of randomness to the factorisation in general opening things a bit wider, and then testing the resulting conclusions, rather than deriving the validity of the conclusions from the presumed validity of the premises. 
There are several automated test for readability - have a look at a tool like MS Word.

Love. 
ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE like MS Word. 
FYI, Microsoft Word's Readability Statistics include: Counts -- Words, Characters, Paragraphs and Sentences. 
Average -- Sentences per Paragraph, Words per Sentence, and Characters per Word Readability -- Passive Sentences as % of all, Flesch Reading Ease, and Flesch-Kincaid Grade level.
