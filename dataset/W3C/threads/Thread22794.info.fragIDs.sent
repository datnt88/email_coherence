<s> I am using DOMDocument object.It has one method - save.  </s>
<s> But when I use it in Javascript in my Internet Explorer5 ,for saving the xml file after changes the browser shows permission denied error.  </s>
<s> Please help how to use the save method when noserver is involved.  </s>
<s> Thanks, chandan...  </s>
<s> This is a Microsoft DOM extension, not a W3C DOM method.  </s>
<s> Wrong mailing list!  </s>
<s> But FYI, I've been bit by this too ... it's not a Javascript or DOM issue, it's an IE security issue (can you IMAGINE the havoc if Javascript could insert little viruses on every machine that browses a website?).  </s>
<s> There may be some way to persuade IE that a particular script is safe for save(), but again this is the wrong crowd to ask.  </s>
<s> Since this method isn't a standard part of the DOM API, you should ask the authors of the DOM implementation you're using -- in this case, the Microsoft IE folks.  </s>
