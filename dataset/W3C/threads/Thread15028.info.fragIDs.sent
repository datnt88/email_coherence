<s> At last week's meeting I undertook to formulate and propose the following definitions: Web resource: any resource identified by a URI.  </s>
<s> Web content: any Web resource or collection of Web resources that comprises, is presented by, or otherwise becomes manifest in a user interface.  </s>
<s> Commonly occurring examples of content include hypertext documents, style sheets, multimedia presentations, Web applications and interactive user interfaces.  </s>
<s> See also "element content", "text content", "non-text content".  </s>
<s> (I think we already have definitions of the terms mentioned in the above cross-references).  </s>
<s> As a slight modification to the first sentence of the definition we could write: Any Web resource or collection of Web resources that comprises, is presented by, affects the behaviour of or otherwise becomes manifest in a user interface.  </s>
<s> Note the added reference to "behaviour", which may or may not serve to clarify the definition.  </s>
<s> Other modifications are possible.  </s>

<s> Maybe this has been covered already, but what about content developed using W3C technologies (HTML, CSS, etc.) but are not referenced using a URI?  </s>
<s> For example, many client applications use such technologies in their presentation.  </s>
<s> For example, Microsoft Outlook uses HTML, CSS and the DOM for several features, including the Outlook Today page, and the Find and Organize features.  </s>
<s> The source for these features are embedded in the binary files that are part of the application.  </s>
<s> Alternately, many things are referenced via URI's, XML schemas, and Microsoft Word and PowerPoint documents.  </s>
<s> SOAP-based web services are also referenced via URI.  </s>
<s> It seems to me that saying that anything referenced by a URI is covered by this document would make it impossibly generic.  </s>
<s> Again, apologies if this has been discussed already.  </s>

<s> Other modifications are possible.  </s>
<s> This and other borderline examples have indeed been discussed, but without reaching any consensus on whether they should be covered by WCAG at all or whether they ought to be firmly within the purview of other software accessibility guidelines, with WCAG applicable only to resources having a URI.  </s>
<s> My own opinion is that the decision whether to apply WCAG to anything that isn't directly covered by the definition of Web content, should be left to the developer.  </s>
<s> For example, the developer of a software application might decide that certain XML content used within that application can best be made accessible by applying WCAG to it.  </s>
<s> Whatever we decide to do, I think it belongs in the Scope section of the document rather than in the definition of "content".  </s>
<s> We might also want to add a statement to the definition of "content" asserting that this definition is not intended to restrict the scope or applicability of the guidelines, which it may be possible to implement in software or other resources that don't satisfy the definition of "content".  </s>
<s> The ultimate test, it seems to me, is whether it makes most sense to apply WCAG, or software accessibility guidelines, in any particular case, and this working group shouldn't curtail the flexibility of software developers in deciding whether, if what they are creating isn't a clear example of Web content, to apply WCAG to any part of it.  </s>
