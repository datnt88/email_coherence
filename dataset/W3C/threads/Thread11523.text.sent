Is it permissible to hotlink W3C logo and stylesheets in translation files? 
I mean to copy the original file, translate the text only and leave the rest of the code as it is... Thanks, Igor I didn't think the code was actually (bodily) translatable, apart from the actual documentation and rules. 
we will hear Marin's comments in due course!

However it's forbidden to modify the W3C logo, and your published version has to link to the W3C site, not your local copy of logo. 
Anyways, let's see what will the W3C folks say.
