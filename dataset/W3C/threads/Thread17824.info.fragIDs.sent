<s> Reference document: Based on discussions at the 17 June UAGL teleconference [1] here is a proposed modification to the checkpoints in Guidelines 7 (Navigation).  </s>
<s> The proposal leaves intact checkpoints 7.1, 7.2, and 7.3 which were discussed and "approved" during the teleconference.  </s>
<s> 1) Merge 7.4 and 7.5.  </s>
<s> Proposed text:  </s>
<s> "Allow the user to navigate all active elements in the document."  </s>
<s> Proposed Priority: 2. Techniques: sequential, direct, search, etc.  </s>
<s> 2) Delete 7.6 (Allow the user to search for active elements).  </s>
<s> 3) I propose that we leave 7.7 (text search) and 7.8 (document tree navigation).  </s>
<s> However, several issues persist about searching:  </s>
<s> a) Do we search on the document source or rendered content?  </s>
<s> At the teleconf, the Working Group expressed consensus that searching should be on rendered content only (recall: rendered does not mean only that which is in the viewport, but the entire document as rendered).  </s>
<s> b) Do we search on (some or all) attribute values (or even attribute names)?  </s>
<s> Attributes used to specify alternative content are of particular interest.  </s>
<s> There is a checkpoint that already ensures that UAs provide access to this content (6.3), which I assume means  </s>
<s> that it's somehow rendered.  </s>
<s> Which means that it would be  </s>
<s> covered by checkpoint 7.7.  </s>
<s> I don't see that searching on attribute names would reduce barriers to accessibility.  </s>
<s> I propose, therefore, not to restore a checkpoint on searching attribute values.  </s>
<s> Related questions: - Should we add a checkpoint about navigating all elements?  </s>
<s> Some thoughts:  </s>
<s> a) This may not be necessary since Checkpoint 7.8 (document tree navigation) would allow this.  </s>
<s> ISSUE: We talk about navigating the document tree which I assume means the source tree.  </s>
<s> However, we talk about searching the rendering structure.  </s>
<s> The rendering structure may not be "tree-shaped" and contains information that may not come from the source tree (e.g., content generated by style sheets, numbers in numbered lists, etc.).  </s>
<s> What exactly do we mean by navigating the document tree?  </s>
<s> b) Navigating all elements feels like a technique to me (for accessing/skipping information more quickly).  </s>
<s> I could imagine two (Pri 3) checkpoints for dependent user agents: i) Allow users to navigate elements in a document.  </s>
<s> ii) Allow users to configure which element types they wish to navigate.  </s>
<s> This already exists as checkpoint 2.4 and is meant to apply to all navigation checkpoints.  </s>
<s> However, it's utility would be made more evident with a general checkpoint about navigating elements.  </s>
<s> c) Why sequential navigation of all elements and not direct navigation?  </s>
<s> Is sequential navigation of all elements more beneficial (or just more prevalent/easier to implement/)?  </s>

<s> I think that we need in the introduction to this section information on the following navigation concepts: Sequential Direct Searching Tree navigation The introduction would summarize the adavantages and disadvantages for different types of users and task situations.  </s>
<s> This would high light the major techniques that we have discussed during the past year without  </s>
<s> necessarily burying the concepts in the techniques document or creating  </s>
<s> long lists of checkpoints.  </s>
<s> JRG: Agree  </s>
<s> JRG: Agree  </s>
<s> JRG: I think that the navigation of the document tree is just one techniques and that it we should just have one checkpoint stating: "Allow the user to navigate all elements in the document."  </s>
<s> Priority: 1 The tree navigation would be described as one way to acheive this.  </s>
<s> JRG: I think we say the text content of elements.  </s>
<s> With scripting some text content may not be rendered unless the user takes acton or turns off support for style sheets.  </s>
<s> JRG: I think this just a more advanced searching function.  </s>
<s> The highest priority would be attributes like: ALT, SUMMARY, TITLE.  </s>
<s> When you get past those your talking about a very small number of people who would understand the concept of what they were doing.  </s>
<s> The only other major technique that I think fits here, is Denis Ansons proposal of move to next thing like this.  </s>

<s> An introduction to those topics seems appropriate.  </s>
<s> Would this be for dependent user agents only?  </s>
<s> I don't think  </s>
<s> it's a Priority 1 since you can get at content through other means.  </s>
<s> I think perhaps Priority 2.  </s>
<s> My question remains on this point: what accessibility barriers fall by being able to navigate all elements?  </s>
<s> Or is this for the techniques document?  </s>
<s> I guess we should ask these questions: a) Are we talking about all user agents or dependent only?  </s>
<s> b) Should users be able to search text hidden by style sheets?  </s>
<s> c) Should users be able to search text in attribute values if not rendered?  </s>
<s> I could see search functionalities changing depending on whether the dependent UA or browser is offering the functionality.  </s>
<s> So if the dependent UA has access to the DOM, it could allow searching, say on attribute values.  </s>
<s> This would surprise me from a browser, however.  </s>
<s> I had hoped that that proposal would be subsumed by the checkpoint to allow users to configure search schemes.  </s>

<s> 4. Users could also configure what type of elements and attribute information they would like to have as a part of the "standard" search.  </s>

<s> In general I agree with Ian's proposals for guideline 7. I think we should only have a single checkpoint - provide a search function, and allow that search function to be configurable in the relevant guideline (I will post some stuff on this in a minute).  </s>
<s> Checkpoint 7.8: I think this should be "allow the user to navigate the document structure".  </s>
<s> To minimally satisfy it, make it possible to move from element to element.  </s>
<s> Techniques "for further credit" are to allow the user to navigate the formal tree structure of the document (in the case of an XML document, or well-formed HTML document) or to navigate an "outline" or table of contents, generated according to some other algorithm.  </s>
<s> For example in HTML it is possible to generate a table of contents based on the headings, and assuming that the levels H1 - H6 are used to specify the appropriate nesting level.  </s>
<s> (Yippee - my action item discharged at last!) I agree with Jon about the necessity of structure navigation in some form.  </s>
<s> Other strong cases are for people limited mobility, and screen magnification.  </s>
