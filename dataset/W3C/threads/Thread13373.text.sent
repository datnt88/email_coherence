(215} 204-2247 (voice) (800) 750-7428 (TTY) Phill will be there. 
Phill can be found at the IBM booth 45 &amp; 46, staying at the Marriot You will also find me during session 98 in the Atlanta/Boston room Thursday 10:40am I might also be able to reserve the IBM suite, if the group is small enough, for the er-ig group to meet. 
I would like to suggest that er-ig group meet after the Dardailler and Clark session 195 Saturday 9:20-10:20am in the Denver room in the Marriott Regards, Phill Jenkins 1-512-838-4517 Accessibility Program Manager 11501 Burnet Rd pjenkins@us.ibm.com

I'll be there, from Wednesday evening to Sunday. 
Thanks for the offer Phill, but W3C groups cannot meet on an adhoc basis like that, without informing the membership several weeks in advance. 
Anti-trust regulations are watching us! 
Lunch is OK, as long as it's informal. 
WAI has already scheduled meetings for Saturday/Sunday (including a update on ER on Saturday afternoon). 
Harvey Bingham is. 
You'll often find me proctoring the web playroom.
