<s> By definition an em is the width of the letter m. Normally one assumes that this is measured on the normal text font used (either determined by the browser user or defined by the page designer with their font settings)  </s>
<s> Amaya apparently uses the size of the letter m as it occurs in the current h1 sizing.  </s>
<s> Is this issue clear in the specification or is it up to browser interpretation.  </s>
<s> it really should be a well defined item as a margin setting will become a common feature of stylesheets i am trying to use it for those nice pages that have left side decoration john russell VE3LL@RAC.CA homepage: http://web.cgocable.net/~jrussel  </s>
<s> This is what the CSS2 spec says.  </s>
<s> Unfortunately you don't say what element you are setting the size on.  </s>
<s> (The sample style sheet uses the browser default as the reference for all sizes.) The 'em' unit is equal to the computed value of the 'font-size' property of the element on which it is used.  </s>
<s> The exception is when 'em' occurs in the value of the 'font-size' property itself, in which case it refers to the font size of the parent element.  </s>
<s> It may be used for vertical or horizontal measurement.  </s>
<s> (This unit is also sometimes called the quad-width in typographic texts.)  </s>
<s> here is the file i am testing on margin and paragraph are using em measures but they appear to be using width determined by h1 size and this continues even when i drop the heading entirely.  </s>
<s> my thought would be that they should use the size of the text in the paragraph itself, not what preceeds it....  </s>
<s> so calc of width done at wrong point ??? but i could be wrong and i find it inconsistant with other browsers... thus my question as to whether the spec is tight enuff Date forwarded: Fri, 24 Sep 1999 12:41:09 -0400 (EDT) From: Dave J Woolley DJW@bts.co.uk Send reply to: www-amaya@w3.org  </s>
