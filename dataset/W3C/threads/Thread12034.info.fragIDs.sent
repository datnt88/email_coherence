I propose that we add the following text after the goals: The priority of a checkpoint is a reflection of how important it is to meeting those goals. 
and the following after the definitions themselves: It should be noted that meeting the checkpoint does not guarantee that the goals will be met. 
In particular, if an author is trying to create inaccessible content a tool cannot necessarily prevent them from doing so. 
It is assumed that the user would prefer to create content which is accessible.

It was shot down. 
I don't think it's necessary here.

I am happy to lose the second piece. 
But I think the first link sentence makes it easier to read what is going on.
