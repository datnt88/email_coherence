<s> In fact, it would be possible to have data that should not be cached at all (such as a stock price, humidity, heart rate, etc.) retrieved from the origin server with each request, but information that can be cached can simply be revalidated.  </s>
<s> This is a good point.  </s>
<s> The current HTTP design does not have a way to provide meta-data (i.e., caching-related headers) for units with finer grain than an entire HTTP response message, and so it might be quite difficult to create a compatible extension that allowed cache validation of individual pieces of a Multipart response.  </s>
<s> However, if you view the problem more abstractly, what you are really asking for is a kind of data-compression mechanism.  </s>
<s> I.e., your actual goal is not really individual validation of the pieces, but rather to prevent the unnecessary transfer of the stable pieces when the unstable pieces change.  </s>
<s> When one takes that (more abstract) view, it can be applied to all sorts of resources, not just multipart ones.  </s>
<s> For example, imagine a one-piece HTML file showing a lot of information about a company, including its current stock price (which changes frequently).  </s>
<s> If we could somehow arrange to transfer just the stock price info on an update, and rely on the cache for the rest, then we could save a lot of bits.  </s>
<s> This is basically "delta-encoding": saving time by transmitting the "delta" (difference) between two successive data elements, rather than transmitting each in its entirety.  </s>
<s> And, in fact, several research projects have already been looking at this possibility.  </s>

House and D.B. Lindquist, IBM Corporation Although the basic concept is pretty simple, there are a lot of really hard research problems to solve.  </s>
<s> For example, what is the best way to compute and encode the difference between two instances of a resource?  </s>
<s> This probably varies based on Content-type!  </s>
<s> And how many different "base versions" should the servers and proxy caches keep around, and for how long?  </s>
<s> And how do the client and servers communicate the necessary meta-information?  </s>
<s> And, finally, how well would this actually work in practice?  </s>
<s> Or do most changeable documents change enough that delta-encoding doesn't save anything?  </s>
<s> I've been talking with the AT&amp;T folks and the Virginia Tech folks about capturing a day or so's worth of the content that flows through Digital's proxy server (we're up to about 1.5 million requests on a good day), and then trying to compute deltas based on various algorithms.  </s>
<s> But this is going to require some hacking on our proxy code, and a fair amount of disk space, so I haven't had a chance to get started on it.  </s>

<s> Of course, Jeffrey Mogul is correct that at least in part this really a URI issue in that there is no Content-ID scheme which will allow us to implement caching at this level of granularity.  </s>

<s> I think in the current web architecture, the granularity of caching is exactly 'what can be pointed to by a URL', and if you want to deliver a database record and cache some parts and not others, what you'd do is deliver a composite object that explicitly includes the other parts.  </s>
<s> If you want to use 'multipart/related' for the container, that's fine, but you might find each part being delivered as 'message/external-body;access-type=URL".  </s>
