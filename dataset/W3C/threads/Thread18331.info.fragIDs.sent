<s> In fact, in presentation-oriented languages like SMIL and SVG, it is often unclear where content ends and styling begins.  </s>
<s> It is meaningless to talk about UA not being required to satisfy the checkpoint for animations for purely stylistic effects as this is almost never recognizable.  </s>
<s> Response: That's fine and that means the style part of the checkpoint would not apply.  </s>

<s> I agree the substance of this proposed resolution.  </s>
<s> I would try to make the final wording just a bit more short and sweet.  </s>
<s> [details below at AG::]  </s>
<s> In the case of a SMIL proper, all actual content is deferred to externally referenced media objects.  </s>
<s> Here it can make sense to play this video object alone, or that audio track.  </s>
<s> But not to pause one alone.  </s>
<s> So one can pause [or stop] whatever is playing.  </s>
<s> In a SMIL one could contemplate pausing the ensemble, changing the content control on some track from "play" to "don't play" and resume the ensemble without the offending drum track or strobe light flickering in time with the drum track.  </s>
<s> In a multilevel SVG animation, I believe there is no content control logic comparable to what is in SMIL.  </s>
<s> So in that case it could be quite reasonable to consider the whole SVG _one animation_ for the purposes of 4.4 and 4.5.  </s>
<s> Here we may be having communication problems because of the overloading of 'element.' What one needs to be able to start stop pause and advance is a separately playable media object.  </s>
<s> Not every XML [syntactic] element in the construction thereof.  </s>
