<s> Hi John,  </s>
<s> That's normal.  </s>
<s> The dialogue is managed by a genereric Thot toolkit which uses the application name to connect the application to its dialogue file: the name is $(lang)-$(appli)dialogue  </s>
<s> When the application is named amaya it's looking for $(lang)-amayadialogue.  </s>
<s> When it's named amaya1, it's looking for $(lang)-amaya1dialogue.  </s>
<s> The file $(lang)-amayamsg is an additional dialogue file also managed by the Thot toolkit but its name is explicitly given by the application itself.  </s>

<s> Amaya builds some messages and configuration files names  </s>
<s> according to its exe name.  </s>
<s> The problem is that this name is supposed to be amaya and not amaya1.  </s>
<s> So if you change the exe name of Amaya some problems may happen and this si a problem.  </s>

<s> That's interesting that Amaya reads its own name and reads files in based on that name.  </s>
<s> Is there some design issue related to this?  </s>
<s> Also, is this the same case for amaya.profiles  </s>
<s> (is it read in like $(appName).profiles or just hard coded because I noticed that it wasn't reading amaya.profiles when the exe was amaya1.exe  </s>
<s> Thanks, John  </s>

<s> In our previous episode, John Logan said:  </s>
<s> This is a legacy issue.  </s>
<s> The thotlib can be used by a number of applications.  </s>
<s> Previously, many of the files that the thotlib opens were stored in the same directory and we used the application name to distinguish between those files.  </s>
<s> Later, on files that were opened only by amaya, we hardcoded the "amaya" prefix.  </s>
<s> We could try to harmonize the whole thing, for example by initializing the application name with a given string or using the bin executable name throughout.  </s>
<s> However, this doesn't seem to be a blocking issue so we'll let it as it is until the next rainy afternoon (unless someone objects).  </s>
<s> If someone wants to work on this, contributions are welcome :) -Jose  </s>
