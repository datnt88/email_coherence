<s> Check RFC1738: 2.2.  </s>
<s> URL Character Encoding Issues URLs are sequences of characters, i.e., letters, digits, and special characters.  </s>
<s> A URLs may be represented in a variety of ways: e.g., ink on paper, or a sequence of octets in a coded character set.  </s>
<s> The interpretation of a URL depends only on the identity of the characters used.  </s>
<s> In most URL schemes, the sequences of characters in different parts of a URL are used to represent sequences of octets used in Internet protocols.  </s>
<s> For example, in the ftp scheme, the host name, directory name and file names are such sequences of octets, represented by parts of the URL.  </s>
<s> Within those parts, an octet may be represented by the chararacter which has that octet as its code within the US-ASCII [20] coded character set.  </s>
<s> Er... well..  </s>
<s> I suppose so.  </s>
<s> But that seems like a pretty roundabout way to go about it.  </s>
<s> I'd much prefer to see a general purpose replacement for the application/x-www-form-urlencoded media type.  </s>
<s> Somethink like text/tab-separated-values might work nicely.  </s>
<s> Or something SQLish, or lispish, or Tcl-ish.  </s>
<s> text/tab-separated-values other encodings.  </s>
<s> Of course you'd have the same nasty interactions between octet 7 for the TAB character as octet 10 and 13 for CR/LF.  </s>
<s> Well... I gather you're still talking about the application/x-www-url-encoded media type.  </s>
<s> The only "specification" for that is in the HTML spec.  </s>
<s> (hang on... I'd better check the CGI spec... nope.  </s>
<s> It just says stuff like "Examples of the command line usage are much better demonstrated than explained.")  </s>
<s> I think the character encoding scheme is US-ASCII, or perhaps ISO-Latin-1, by convention.  </s>
<s> Like I said... I'd much prefer to see x-www-form-urlencoded replaced than having other character sets shoehorned into that hack.  </s>

<s> Dan, the file upload proposal includes a complete specification for 'multipart/form-data' which is intended as a general purpose replacement for application/x-www-form-urlencoded.  </s>
<s> We went through  </s>
<s> multiple iterations both in the HTML working group and also as a result of the review given by the folks reviewing new media type registration.  </s>
<s> multipart/form-data is completely capable of dealing with multiple character sets, unicode, or whatever coming back as the result of filling out a form.  </s>
<s> Check it out: ftp://ds.internic.net/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-html-fileupload-02.txt  </s>
<s> I have something written up on this that was going into the rfc.  </s>
<s> It is appended.  </s>
<s> P The URL specification allows arbitrary 8 bit data to form part of the TT scheme-specific-part /TT of a URL but requires that only octets which correspond to character codes for printable ASCII be used in the URL definition.  </s>
<s> Octets that fall outside of this set must be encoded using the EM URL-encoding /EM mechanism, which encodes the octet as a '%', followed by 2 hexadecimal digits.  </s>
<s> The '%' sign must also be encoded.  </s>
<s> /P  </s>
<s> P URL's often point to files on a file system, which increasingly, may EM not /EM have a name that uses printable ASCII characters.  </s>
<s> For example, on a Japanese systems, a file might have the name "insatsu.html", in which the "insatsu" might be represented in romanji, katakana, hiragana, or kanji.  </s>
<s> In such cases, the octets that fall outside the range of printable ASCII would be encoded as per the specification, resulting in something looking like the following on EUC-based systems: P In general, this does not present a problem, because URL's are seldom decoded on machines where the coded character set and encoding  </s>
<s> differ from that found within the URL.  </s>
<s> However, in such cases (for example robots), it may, or may not, be possible for the decoder to sense the coded character set and encoding used.  </s>
<s> Even if the decoder does correctly guess, it is not guaranteed that they will be able to successfully decode the URL, and then process the resulting text.  </s>
<s> /P P To allow the coded character set and encoding to be explicitly stated in the URL, the URL syntax should be expanded as follows: /P scheme :character-set-data scheme-specific-part would be: P character-set-data = "[" [ character-set ":" ] encoding "]:" character-set = name-string encoding = name-string name-string = 1*[ alpha | digit | "-" | "," ] P and the TT character-set-data /TT part of a URL should be optional, thereby resolving any backward compatibility concerns.  </s>
<s> An example of such URL's would be: /P P It would also be advisable for the HTTP protocol to provide some mechanism for indication the coded character set and encoding used with URL's that are parts of a request..  </s>
<s> For example, the TT PUT /TT method syntax could be extended such that the coded character set and encoding of the URL be an optional part of the method parameters: /P request-line = method SP request-uri SP optional-charset-data SP http-version CRLF optional-charset-data = "[" [ character-set ":" ] encoding "]:" character-set = name-string encoding = name-string name-string = 1*[ alpha | digit | "-" | "," ]  </s>
<s> I don't like this model, but prefer another one: Let me explain this via an 'ftp' example.  </s>
<s> The FTP protocol doesn't care what character set your file system uses.  </s>
<s> You open a 8-bit connection and send US-ASCII characters to the server.  </s>
<s> If you want to retrieve a file, you send 'RETR xxxx' and when you want to store a file, you send 'STOR xxxx', where 'xxxx' are characters *NOT* in the native character set of the file system, but rather in whatever transcription of that character set is made available by the FTP server.  </s>
<s> The *PROTOCOL* doesn't define the mapping between the bytes sent and the the file system.  </s>
<s> This is completely up to the implementation of the FTP server.  </s>
<s> Now, the FTP URL scheme defines yet another mapping.  </s>
<s> If you happen to want to send 'RETR /?#frob' to your FTP server, you have to actually encode the '#' in the FTP URL.  </s>
<s> Thus, there's another level of encoding in URL - ftp-protocol that sits on top of the encoding chosen by your implementation of FTP-protocol - file system.  </s>
<s> The same situation holds with the HTTP protocol.  </s>
<s> Implementors of HTTP servers which deal with files on file systems that allow file names to be written in other character sets will have to chose some mapping between those files and the HTTP protocol.  </s>
<s> That mapping is *not* part of the HTTP protocol, and I don't think it should be.  </s>
<s> Yep. In section 4.4 of "The Multilingual World Wide Web" I make mention of it as well.  </s>
<s> It is a good solution, and will certainly be in the RFC.  </s>
<s> I don't understand how this works, especially the "some transcription" part.  </s>
<s> How is the receiving server to know the name to store it under, or is "%B0%F5%BA%FE.html" translated to insatsu.html for storage purposes?  </s>
<s> There are 3 problems I have with this model: 1) It would probably require the use of some kind of database to map the local filename to the HTTP representation, because there are possible transcription collisions, and because HTTP is stateless.  </s>
<s> 2) Without some standard mapping it seems somewhat difficult for a browser to decide what to send to the server.  </s>
<s> Yes, I know people will say that the server decides, because they make the URL's available in the first place, but what happens if a server sends me an EUC URL, and I send it a SJIS one back?  </s>
<s> 3) URL's are *not* used solely in HTTP transactions.  </s>

<s> Date: Wed, 2 Aug 1995 19:37:40 PDT 'xxxx' are characters *NOT* in the native character set of the file system, but rather in whatever transcription of that character set is made available by the FTP server.  </s>
<s> OK. Say the transcription system used by both the FTP client and server says: (1) if an octet in the local encoding of a file name is in positions 0x20 - 0x24 or 0x26 - 0x7E of US-ASCII, then use that octet; (2) if an octet in the local encoding of a file name is in position 0x25 of US-ASCII (i.e., '%'), then use "%%" (3) otherwise, use %XX for each octet in the encoded file name (in big endian order), where XX is the hexidecimal value of each such octet.  </s>
<s> Now, say I am a Chinese version of Windows/NT using Unicode and I ask you for: RETR E-W%0B%00.%00T%00X%00T  </s>
<s> That is, in Unicode I have the following encoding of my file name: 4E2D 570B 002E 0054 0058 0054 Say you are a Taiwanese server using the BIG5 character set for you file names.  </s>
<s> How do you interpret my request?  </s>
<s> Do you interpret it as a BIG5 string?  </s>
<s> If so, then you think I just asked for the file "E-W??.?T?X?T" (assuming for a moment that you don't throw up on NUL and you interpret NUL and other C0 escapes as '?'.  </s>
<s> Even if both systems are using the same transcription system, we are still hosed because you have no idea of how to interpret the decoded results since you don't know what character set encoding applies.  </s>
<s> If, on the other hand, you know that Unicode was the source encoding, then, at least you know you shouldn't interpret it as a BIG5 string.  </s>
<s> You may respond: sorry, I don't grok Unicode path names.  </s>
<s> Or, if you have a Unicode - BIG5 translation table on hand, you could correctly translate it to the corresponding BIG5 encoding: %A4%A4%B0%EA.TXT.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, if you do misinterpret the original file name as a BIG5 string, then you are going to say: 550 E-W??.?T?X?T: No such file OR directory.  </s>
<s> And I'm going to be clueless about what went wrong.  </s>
<s> If the protocol doesn't communicate this information, then who/what will?  </s>

<s> Let me try again:  </s>
<s> How the http server for www.jacme.co.jp decides to translate strings into files in its local file system is COMPLETELY up to the  </s>
<s> implementation of the http server.  </s>
<s> www.jacme.co.jp could be running some object-oriented database operating system which doesn't have files at all.  </s>
<s> It could be running a file system where every file and directory was 'named' with a bitmap image rather than a string of characters.  </s>
<s> The URL standard makes no claims about the mapping of URLs to anything at all in the local file system of the local operating system.  </s>
<s> It defines how URLs are written, and how URLs are translated into sequences of octets that are sent in the protocol for the particular scheme chosen.  </s>
<s> If you want to build a HTTP server that accepts strings of the form [character-set:encoding]:name-string then feel free; however, it would have to be written  </s>
<s> This convention requires no changes to the HTTP or URL standards.  </s>

<s> True.  </s>
<s> Well, this is where we disagree.  </s>
<s> I think there should be a *standard* way to send this information, so as such, the *standard* does require  </s>
<s> changing.  </s>
<s> I don't mind where the information is put, but one reason for preferring: over is that the latter could very will be a legal name within the system, leading to ambiguity.  </s>
<s> In other words, the information about coded  </s>
<s> character set and encoding must be separated from the name itself, because *any* representation of the information could be legal in the context of a name (as you mention, anything is legal here).  </s>
<s> I disagree.  </s>
<s> The person in charge of www.jacme.co.jp is in charge of creating the object-name part of the URLs.  </s>
<s> They can make up unambiguous names.  </s>
<s> End users don't make up URLs, or if they do, they shouldn't assume anything about how the server will respond to their requests.  </s>
<s> In the case you give, the server administrator can specify that: - [EUC]%B0%F5%BA%FE.html is an alias/link to the file called %B0%F5%BA%FE.html - [anything] is truncated from all incoming URLs since it is only useful to folks looking at URLs, not the server - [EUC]%B0%F5%BA%FE.html returns a different result than [XYZ]%B0%F5%BA%FE.html  </s>
<s> All of these are decisions made by the server adminstrator and anyone who he or she allows to create URLs.  </s>
<s> That being said, I think it's fine for people who create URLs that might have different character sets to use a consistent naming character set scheme, and client makers can choose whether or not they want to do something smart about those names.  </s>
<s> However, it should not be a change to the current URL RFC at this very late date.  </s>
<s> Feel free to create a seperate  </s>

<s> --Paul Hoffman --Proper Publishing  </s>
<s> But surely the character set in use is a server issue and thus should be in the opaque data portion of the URL?  </s>
<s> The second scheme will be  </s>

<s> If the URL is valid for the server its pointing to there shouldn't be any ambiguity with legal names in the system as the server will be expecting the [EUC] or whatever.  </s>
<s> However, I'd rather see something tacked onto the _end_ of the URL rather than at the start of the opaque data section.  </s>

<s> In a language using the Latin script like Swedish almost 1/3 of all words contain non-ASCII letters.  </s>
<s> In languages such as Greek, Russian, Hindi and Chinese no ASCII letters at all are used.  </s>
<s> For ordinary users in these countries it will be unacceptable to see their everyday letters represented by %-headed hexadecimal digit sequences.  </s>
<s> We propose this solution: C) In the human form of URLs non-ASCII characters may be used provided a character set indicator is added to the URL immediately before the closing " ".  </s>
<s> This indicator shall have the syntax "%:" charset where "charset" is a value registered by IANA for MIME use.  </s>
<s> The corresponding coded character set defines the mapping of the non-ASCII character to a sequence of octets that can be represented by the %-mechanism in the program form of the URL.  </s>
<s> Take as an example a file called l a" s mig in the directory pub at host othello.admin.kth.se.  </s>
<s> Here a" is the character LATIN SMALL LETTER A WITH DIAERESIS, coded by the octet E4 hex according to ISO-8859-1.  </s>
<s> (The name of the file is Swedish for "read me".) The human form URL for this file preferred in Sweden would be a" here would in reality be the non-ASCII character.  </s>
<s> The program form would be Why is it necessary to include a character set indicator in these extended URLs containing non-ASCII characters?  </s>
<s> It's because that makes the URL resistent to character-preserving conversion between different coded character sets.  </s>
<s> Say that the URL in the example is included in a text file coded with ISO-8859-1, so the non-ASCII character is represented by the octet E4.  </s>
<s> Then this file is transferred to a Mac and therefore converted to the Macintosh character set.  </s>
<s> For the Mac user it will look exactly as intended, containing a lowecase a with diaeresis (which is necessary to form the Swedish expression for "read me").  </s>
<s> In the Mac file, however, this letter will be represented by 8A instead of E4. Thanks to the character set indicator %:iso-8859-1 a client program on the Mac will however be able to feed the right octet E4 to the FTP program to fetch the correct file from the FTP server (where ISO-8859-1 is used in file names).  </s>
<s> It could be argued that occasional non-ASCII letters is nothing to make a fuss about: European users can be taught to read and input %-sequences instead.  </s>
<s> But consider a Greek FTP server, where almost the whole path of a file is written with Greek letters using ISO-8859-7.  </s>
<s> In that case URLs will be almost three times as long and consist of mostly a soup of "%" and hexadecimal digits, interspersed with "/".  </s>
<s> Such URLs will be unusable for humans, unless some way of using the real non-ASCII letters is provided.  </s>
