<s> We have suggested adding an include element as child of propfind , which can be used to specifically add properties to those which would be reported by allprop .  </s>

<s> That prevents the server from ever having a property called "all-dead-prop", since the XML element with that name was used the way you're proposing.  </s>
<s> This one won't interoperate with old servers, because allprop is defined to be EMPTY (in RFC2518).  </s>
<s> So if you hit an old server, you'll have to two two additional requests ( allprop and prop with the three named properties), while with include , it will be just one additional request (using prop to get the three additional properties).  </s>

<s> Thus the most backward compatible solution is using include in its own namespace: where I don't specifically care what the namespace is (could also be "DAV:extended" or "DAV:addons-to-rfc2518").  </s>
