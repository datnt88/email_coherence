Hi folks, hi Judy in the "Why Standards Harmonization is Essential to Web Accessibility" document, I have read what follows as a problem for the W3C and WAI global knowledge: "the lack of an authorized translation of a guideline in a local language -- yet for WCAG 2.0, W3C/WAI expects authorized translations to be possible". 
It would seem, according to this phrase, that W3C is searching for "authorized" translators; but it's exactly the opposite: W3C does't allow not-english versions of its documents to become officially recognized as W3C documents. 
That's the real problem. 
And if we all think about it, we'll finally discover that W3C and WAI documents find growing difficulties: If a state or a nation cannot base its politics on an official W3C document in its own language, it's normal that many different standards will be born all over the not-english language countries. 
In Italy we're having great problems in making a law which should base itself on an American document; we all know that W3C is made of worldwide people (there are many italias too), but can we really pretend that Italian government may found an italian law on an english language only document? 
Actually, the only normative version of W3C documents is in english (it's clearly written in all W3C raccomandations); that's why we cannot say in an official WAI resource that one of the potential problem is "the lack of an authorized translation of a guideline in a local language". 
We will have the possibility to say it only when W3C will officially recognize its documents' localization (this work may be done by local W3C officies). 
In my opinion, W3C should immediatly find a good solution to this problem; it's a credibility matter, and the whole Web will make a great step ahead with a W3C more and more "strong" and credible.

Roberto, I believe you misunderstood the phrase and the intent. 
Additional comments below. 
No. We are not searching for "authorized translators." 
We are establishing a process whereby authorized translations of W3C/WAI documents may be allowed in languages other than English. 
A draft policy on this has been in progress for some time, and those attending the EOWG meeting here received a brief preview of the draft process whereby authorized translations might be developed. 
However, as the policy is still under development -- and obviously so prone to misunderstandings -- we are not quite at the point yet of circulating it for comment. 
We're already quite well aware of this problem, which is why we have been investing considerable time in developing a policy whereby it will eventually be possible to have authorized (official) versions of W3C/WAI documents in other languages. 
In fact our efforts on this question are a direct result of discussion with representatives of a number of countries including yours. 
WCAG 1.0 is not an American document, regardless of the issue of normative language. 
As you're well aware, W3C is an international organization, and WCAG 1.0 received extensive international input while under development. 
If we're listing real fragmentation drivers in the standards harmonization document, we obviously need to include this issue, since as you clearly agree, this is in fact a fragmentation driver. 
If we are in the midst of developing a process to address the problem, we also can indeed also mention this fact in our document. 
It's apparently not yet expressed clearly enough -- however, the point of a draft is to try to arrive at clear ways to express things. 
Comments are welcome, but are particularly helpful when they don't assume the worst. 
Roberto, this is exactly what we're working on.

I expose my naivety here: Might W3C offer an unofficial multi-language translation service as a starting version for translating any of their documents? 
For example, the following link shows a large selection of languages that might gain translations: Translation Software: English to/from Spanish, French, German, Portuguese, Italian, Polish, Russian, Japanese, Chinese, and Korean. 
Or must this function be only done by the individual who needs a particular translation?

Judy: No. We are not searching for "authorized translators." 
Roberto: I know it, Judy; I was simply trying to guess the worst things that someone could read in our document. 
You know, I'm getting used in meeting (and fighting with) people who try to say: "W3C? 
Not very important... 
They are american after all, and they believe their language and culture is the only one" and it's not always easy to make them understand they're wrong. 
And if such a comment comes from people involved in italian government and in the accessibility italian law, I must not simply say "you're wrong, i'm right"; the question I was asking myself and the group was "is it possible to make people understand that W3C is not only exponing a problem, but solving it?". 
Of course it is, and we all must find it, and be sure that document can transmit a positive and constructive message.

Roberto: That would be great, Judy: we should mention this situation in the document, saying that the problem does exists, but W3C is doing its best to fix it. 
This is the moment the document can be improved, and I believe that any "worst" but constructive comment may be welcome if its purpose is to come across some fundamental concept that may be expressed in a better way.
