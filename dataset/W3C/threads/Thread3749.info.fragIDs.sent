<s> Validator EARL shows traces of an RDF learning curve: XML striping  </s>
<s> is suppressed for no obvious reason, and overuse of rdf:parsetype="Resource" generates huge numbers of bnodes.  </s>
<s> Looking at the report generated by a page with a small number of errors (http://valet.webthing.com/invalid.html)  </s>
<s> I can't make too much sense of the picture generated by the RDF validator from the HTML validator report.  </s>
<s> I attach a patch to generate a compact but meaningful EARL report.  </s>
<s> I'm not quite sure how it'll go down with the EARL folks, but IMO it's worth putting to them.  </s>
<s> Rationale: (1) Validator asserts that {page} passes or fails {valid HTML} That is one assertion - no problem.  </s>
<s> (2) For the individual error messages, I've minimised the Subjects and Objects, on the grounds that they are known to be {points within the page} and {violations of the HTML standard} respectively.  </s>
<s> Not quite sure whether everyone will be happy with the minimisation, but it looks nice to me!  </s>

<s> I've asked Nick to redo the diff as a unidiff -- so I manage to read it; I can't stand context diffs -- and intend to apply it on the theory that Nick knows what he's doing.  </s>
<s> All those opposed say "cvs diff -u".  </s>

<s> I attach the updated patch.  </s>
<s> I'm not 100% convinced about my use of the rdf:About attribute (will have to get feedback on that one), and of course the EARL spec remains hopelessly incomplete in some areas, but this is now (I believe) significantly better EARL than my own Page Valet tool is producing.  </s>
