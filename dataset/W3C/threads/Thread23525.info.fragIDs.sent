<s> Test documentadoptnode28 (unintentionally?) adopts a node into its current document.  </s>
<s> Allowing this case seems undesirable, at best it acts  </s>
<s> as node.parentNode.removeChild(node),  </s>

<s> worse.  </s>
<s> Would it be possible to state that WRONG_DOCUMENT_ERR should be thrown on attempt to adopt a node into the same document?  </s>
<s> I'm not convinced that this is a Good Idea.  </s>
<s> It turns a mostly-harmless operation into an error condition, and prevents adoptNode from being used as a general safety net prior to insertion of a node obtained from an untrusted source.  </s>
<s> Making adopting a node into its own document be a no-op would seem to be a cleaner fix for Curt's concern about the side-effect... though leaving it as it now stands also strikes me as acceptable.  </s>

<s> I'm not sure if adoptNode() as-is on a node's source document is "mostly-harmless".  </s>
<s> The preconception behind adopt node is that we are willing to cannibalize the source documents in order to build our target document.  </s>
<s> In all cases expect the same document case, there is no mutation to the one document that we care about.  </s>
<s> If you were using adoptNode as a "safety net" on an insert operation, a malicious caller may exploits adoptNode's behavior to move or remove existing nodes by attempting to insert them insignificant places.  </s>
<s> Maybe the best solution is to specify that adoptNode in this scenario is equivalent to cloneNode.  </s>
<s> If you just returned the source node, you could get an IN_USE error on an attempt to insert that you could never get if adopted from a foreign source.  </s>
<s> I'm not entirely convinced.  </s>
<s> I think allowing it could be useful for writing simpler code in situations where you want an orphan node and you don't care where it's coming from.  </s>
<s> Experience shows destination.importNode(source)  </s>
<s> where source.ownerDocument  </s>
<s> can be destination to be useful even though the spec is (it seems to me) equally as unclear on the question of whether "another document" is allowed to be "this document".  </s>
<s> If the user expectation for adoptNode is "like importNode but the source disappears" I think it's reasonable to allow it.  </s>
<s> Certainly it should either be allowed or throw WRONG_DOCUMENT; a no-op or a clone are both undesirable as they leave the source document in an unexpected state.  </s>
<s> One shouldn't have the same parentNode after being adopted!  </s>
<s> Andrew Clover  </s>
<s> I guess that importNode to the same document ends up functionally equivalent to a cloneNode operation.  </s>
<s> In either case, the user's expectation is fulfilled in that neither the source or the destination document is modified.  </s>
<s> My take on it was that if you were using adoptNode, your interest was in the target document and you didn't care how badly you mangled or did not mangle the source document.  </s>
<s> That the user's expectation was the target document was unmodified, the returned node was null or could be inserted into the target document and any modification to the source document was just a necessary evil.  </s>
<s> A no-op would not result in an insertable node since you could get an IN_USE error.  </s>
<s> adoptNode as equivalent to cloneNode matched the expectation of no target document modification and an insertable node, but no longer changed the source document.  </s>
<s> adoptNode as equivalent to removeChild had the unexpected affect of mutating the target document.  </s>
<s> Returning null might be a good solution.  </s>
<s> adoptNode allows implementations to return null at their discretion anytime they do not feel like adopting a node, so good client code should always call adoptNode in a construct like: Node newNode = newDoc.adoptNode(otherNode);  </s>
<s> if (newNode == null) { newNode = newDoc.importNode(otherNode);  </s>
<s> The client code really wanted the source/destination mutation, they could do: Node newNode = newDoc.adoptNode(otherNode);  </s>
<s> if (newNode == null) { newNode = newDoc.importNode(otherNode);  </s>
<s> if (otherNode.getParentNode() != null) { otherNode.getParentNode().removeChild(otherNode);  </s>
