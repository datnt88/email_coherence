<s> I am new to the http world and looking for the draft version 1.1.  </s>
<s> I have not been able to locate this version, and thought that I might have found it at a site, but it is not available yet.  </s>
<s> Specifically, I am looking at the push server capability aspects of the protocol.  </s>
<s> Would appreciate any help on finding http 1.1 or this new feature.  </s>
<s> It is not available yet.  </s>
<s> Since I seem to have come down with a cold imported from California, it probably won't be available until Monday.  </s>
<s> That feature is documented somewhere at Netscape HQ.  </s>
<s> I have not received any requests to include that feature in HTTP/1.1.  </s>

<s> It's also not an HTTP issue.  </s>
<s> server-spewHHpush is implemented as a multipart object with a particular unregistered content type (multipart/x-mixed-replace), and since HTTP can transport any MIME object, it's no problem.  </s>
