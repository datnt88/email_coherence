<s> I'd appreciate it if changes from draft to draft were marked as such (maybe a different style) so I can get an idea of what has changed since the last time I read the document.  </s>

<s> Another approach would be to update the log of changes, although this would involve more work for the editors, who are already very busy.  </s>
<s> Perhaps a compromise would be, when announcing new draft of the guidelines, to include in the message sent to the list an indication of the major changes which have been made since the previous version.  </s>
<s> These could perhaps also be included in the changes log.  </s>
<s> Minor corrections would not need to be noted in this way.  </s>
<s> Before each release of a CSS2 (or HTML4) specification, I: a) Compile a list of changes since the previous version by reviewing the CVS logs.  </s>
<s> Not all the information in the CVS logs is appropriate for distribution (e.g., it's boring or editorial), so some filtering by the editors is useful.  </s>
<s> b) Attach the list of changes to the announcement of the release of the spec.  </s>
<s> What I should do, but don't is make each list of changes available from the Working Group's home page (or some other suitable location).  </s>
<s> People have to hunt through mail archives to find the changes, which they shouldn't have to do.  </s>
<s> I would rather keep the list of changes between drafts separate from the document than including them in an appendix, for example.  </s>

<s> I like Ian's approach to the problem.  </s>
<s> There are already two changes logs associated with the GL home page, one of which provides a detailed list, whereas the other is more of a summary.  </s>
<s> It these logs can be maintained, then it should be relatively easy to prepare a brief statement of changes that could be distributed via the list with each release of the document.  </s>
