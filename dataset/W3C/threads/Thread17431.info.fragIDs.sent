<s> There are a couple of contradictions (tiny and inane ones) between WCAG 1.0 and XHTML specs.  </s>
<s> XHTML 1.0 Strict and XHTML 1.1 deprecate LANG attribute ( html lang="en" ), in favour of html xml:lang="en" .  </s>
<s> However WCAG 1.0 specifies: 11.1 Use W3C technologies when they are available and appropriate for a task and use the latest versions when supported  </s>
<s> 11.2 Avoid deprecated features of W3C technologies.  </s>
<s> Although this is ridiculously pedantic, this basically states you cannot use XHTML 1.0 Strict or XHTML 1.1 with a WAI compliant site, yet WAI states you must use the latest technology.  </s>
<s> I'm only really raising it because the gizmos like Cynthia Says and Bobby fail a site if you don't have the lang attributes.  </s>
<s> I suggest the code is modified to search for just 'lang=" lang "', whether it is 'lang="en"' or 'xml:lang="en"'.  </s>
<s> ATM, in order to 'pass' tests, you have to use XHTML 1.0 Transitional and put html lang="en-gb" xml:lang="en-gb"  </s>
<s> Personally I think this is all useless anyway, since a global declaration is really the responsibility of the following META tag:  </s>
<s> The lang or xml:lang attribute should only be used when the language changes mid-stream as such (assuming the english META had been declared):  </s>

<s> Hi Jules, I'm not sure I follow your argument.  </s>
<s> Validators don't set standards.  </s>
<s> They just perform basic tests where they can.  </s>
<s> Both Cynthia Says and Bobby will pass an XHTML Strict document with an xml:lang attribute.  </s>

<s> Why would you expect the meta element to work?  </s>
<s> Dublin Core in RDF/XML, only for user-agents that care about metadata and not the content.  </s>
<s> Why have a global version of anything that can be scoped - just use the scoped method in the widest scope.  </s>
<s> So it you have this there, then what do you gain by inventing a new technique?  </s>
<s> Given that this is in addition to the HTTP content-language headers and in addition to Dublin Core I really can't see the point of any of this.  </s>

<s> Yes. Or, in other words: - If you are using HTML, apply the LANG attribute.  </s>
<s> - If you are using XHTML, apply the xml:lang attribute.  </s>

<s> There isn't any contradiction.  </s>
<s> There are, as you point out, bugs in some tools which don't properly recognise language tagging as specified (but they are testing tools - no worries with users' tools...).  </s>
<s> correct method for all XML (including XHTML) is to include the xml:lang attribute as appropriate.  </s>
<s> The correct method for HTML (up until bugwards-compatible XHTML 1) is the lang attribute.  </s>
<s> You should also have your server sending out HTTP information identifying the Content-language correctly.  </s>

<s> No it doesn't.  </s>
<s> It says that in XHTML 1.0 Strict, or XHTML 1.1, you should use xml:lang not lang, since that has been deprecated.  </s>
<s> It also states that you should be using XHTML 1 or 1.1, as you noted.  </s>
<s> Good suggestion.  </s>
<s> There is a mailing list for the WAI Evaluation and Repair Tools group - http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER for more information - which is where you might get the attention of the developers.  </s>
<s> Most of them also have a feedback mechanism as part of their tool sites.  </s>
<s> Few of them read this list.  </s>
<s> The tests you are ''passing' are clearly flawed...  </s>
<s> That is not correct.  </s>
<s> The specifications are pretty clear about that.  </s>
<s> For changing language mid-stream this is indeed the way to do it.  </s>

<s> My impression is that a lot of meta element properties were added into HTML to allow one to dump the meta information from MS Word into an HTMLised version of a Word document, without having to thing about whether the particular property was covered by HTML.  </s>
<s> In this particular case, the HTML specification says that the default language is take from the HTTP Content-Language header (with an equivalent provided by meta http-equiv taking precedence), provided that there is only one language.  </s>
<s> Documents can have more than one language from this point of view; the languages in this context represent the set union of the languages spoken by the intended audience of the page.  </s>
