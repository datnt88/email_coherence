3b. If the image is purely decorative and has no meaning to the content of ?the 
page, advise them to provide a brief descriptive text and suggest 
that 
they may also want to link to a longer description of the image with the "longdesc" attribute. 
seems to conflict with 
3d. If the author indicates the image has a function, advise the author 
to 
provide a functional text equivalent and if necessary link to a longer description. 
Why would we encourage "longdesc" for images that are purely decorative and have no meaning? 
I would move 3b to the end of the ordered list. 
After checking if it's part of a link, or used for spacing or formatting, then finally if it's just a "purely decorative" image, then shouldn't alt="" be O.K.? For example, I have a image of a LOGO several places on a page purely for 
visual effect, but don't want to "clutter up" the audio by having it 
rendered every time in-line with the HTML, I the author may choose to turn off the audio by using the alt="" on the redundant images. 
What I do with my eyes, skip over and ignore the purely decorative images, can only be supported by the screen reader by me the author using alt="". 
The user can always get the source HTML file and review the image file used if curious, 
but brief description and longer description should not be encouraged for 
redundant decorative images. 
Regards, Phill Jenkins, 
Although I agree that a brief description in alt values is redundant, I would 
suggest that a longdesc is often appropriate. 
However I feel that it would 
make more sense to use a more powerful construct than "img" anyway, which 
would allow for the selection of multiple content types.

Phil and Charles, I have reworked my proposal. 
does this cover your suggestions and questions? 
1. Flag images with: * the IMG attribute alt="", alt=" ", and alt="&amp;nbsp;" (or alt="&amp;#160;") 
* OBJECT (of type="image/gif" or "image/png" etc.) that has no text content. 
(Note that OBJECTs of other types should be handled elsewhere in the ERT document.) 2. If the image is part of a link that has text (e.g., a 
href="home.html" img src="button.gif" 
alt=" " Refer to our home page /a ) 
this is o.k. 3. If the image is not part of a link, query the author for the use of the image. 
3a. 
If the author identifies the image as a space between words and those words should not be separated, advise them to use &amp;nbsp; (or alt="&amp;#160;") instead of an image. 
3b. 
If the image is a space that is used to format the layout of text, advise them to use style sheets, IMG alt=" ", or spaces in the content of OBJECT. 
3c. If the author indicates the image has a function, advise the author to 
provide a functional text equivalent and if necessary a longer description. 
3d. If the image is purely decorative and has no meaning to the content of the page, advise them to provide either brief descriptive text, that they 
handle it as a "space" (see 3b), and suggest that they may also want to 
provide a longer description of the image (on IMG with the "longdesc" 
attribute or as text in the content of OBJECT). 
Exceptions to this rule are image effects that could be created with style sheets, such as graphical list bullets. 
Advise authors to use style sheets. 
(See examples in the WCAG 1.0 Techniques document). 
How does an author know when to do what for 3d? 
An example situation. 
I have a page where My Company's logo is displayed several times. 
The first use is a link to our home page. 
The text content is, "My Company's home page." 
I'm very proud of how detailed we made the logo, so I provide a longer description of it. 
On the bottom of the page we provide a row of the logos - the same image over and over again. 
It's a 
branding presentation effect. 
The first logo has the text equivalent "My 
Company" the rest have a space. 
I do describe the effect for my friends who 
used to have sight because I think I can describe it well enough for them to form a mental image. 
This is the "extremely friendly" version. the "basic" would be: I have a page where My Company's logo is displayed several times. 
The first use is a link to our home page. 
The text content is, "My Company's home page." 
On the bottom of the page we provide a row of the logos - the same image over and over again. 
It's a branding presentation effect. 
They all have a space for a text equivalent. 
I don't see a clear algorithm for how to walk an author through the decisions. 
Ideas?

Suggestions / questions: 2. If the image is the entire content of a link, and there is not another link in the document to the same target, harass the author. 
3a. Is &amp;#160; a unicode character for space? 
3b. THere is no defined handling for alt=" ", so it might no have the desired effect 
3d. If the image is decorative, use alt="" but ask if the author would like to associate a longdesc

see proposed changes, below. 
for nbsp 
using "" versus " " has been argued back and forth. 
It is my 
interpretation of sifting through the archives that if the "desired effect" 
is a space between two characters, using an image for this is inappropriate. 
We suggest style sheets. 
Also, some people have favored "" while others like " ". 
Most of the arguments have been based on the current state of the art handling of spaces. 
However, it appears that "" and " " are currently handled the same [http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/tests/spaces.html]. 
I was the only one to respond to the tests, so it only includes the 3 browsers I was able to test. 
Many people pointed to the HTML4 spec where it says that "leading or trailing spaces" may be ignored. 
However, is a single space trailing or leading? 
&amp;nbsp; is inappropriate since it is intended to be used as a typesetting hint as Nir described on 17 November: Alan Flavell also makes a good point about nbsp not being considered "white space" http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/1999OctDec/0069.html 
Therefore, I don't think it matters much if we suggest that people use "" or " ". Personally, it seems to be a matter of author preference. 
Neither one is going to cause horrible things to happen (although "" has historically - i.e. it supposedly used to be ignored by Lynx but doesn't seem to be anymore). 
If we look at the long term, I would suggest using a space since spaces are supposed to be preserved in XML. 
However, I also agree that it is a matter of separating content from presentation. 
A space seems to say, "there is formatting going on here" while null says, "it's decorative." 
Again, I think it boils down to author preference. 
I think it is up to the author, thus why I left it as either a blank or a short description. 
It is my understanding that some users appreciate knowing what is on the page. 
If the author wants to support short descriptions for them, it is their choice. 
As we look forwards to tools that will allow users to navigate the structure of a page, if a user chooses to navigate past images then we won't have to worry as much about users wading through alt-text that they don't care about. 
Therefore, I once again include a proposal for review: 1. Flag images with: * the IMG attribute alt="", alt=" ", and alt="&amp;nbsp;" (or alt="&amp;#160;") * OBJECT (of type="image/gif" or "image/png" etc.) that has no text content. 
(Note that OBJECTs of other types should be handled elsewhere in the ERT document.) 2. If the image is part of a link that has text (e.g., a href="home.html" 
img src="button.gif" 
alt=" " Refer to our home page /a ) this is o.k. 2a. if the link does not have text, look for other links on the same page that point to the same URI and use the text from those. 
2b. 
If no other links to the URI are found on the page, prompt the author for text to be included as a text equivalent of the image (or if the author wants to add it as text of the link.) 3. If the image is not part of a link, query the author for the use of the image. 
3a. 
If the author identifies the image as a space between words and those words should not be separated, advise them to use &amp;nbsp; (or alt="&amp;#160;") instead of an image. 
3b. 
If the image is a space that is used to format the layout of text, advise them to use style sheets, IMG alt=" ", alt="", or spaces in the content of OBJECT. 
3c. 
If the author indicates the image has a function, advise the author to provide a functional text equivalent and if necessary a longer description. 
3d. 
If the image is purely decorative and has no meaning to the content of the page, advise them to provide either brief descriptive text, or that they handle it as a "space" (see 3b), and suggest that they may also want to provide a longer description of the image (on IMG with the "longdesc" attribute or as text in the content of OBJECT).

I tested the page with Amaya release 2.1 running on Linux 2.2 (RedHat 6.1 and Gnome) and got nothing rendered each time (in the alternate view). 
I got the same results running Lynx 2.8 on linux as were on windows. 
Netscape 4.6 in linux gave me the same as your results for MSIE I agree that the behaviour does not seem completely specified for alt="" or alt=" ". Actually, why not use an object element instead (or use XHTML and namespaces to include SVG...) Charles McCN
