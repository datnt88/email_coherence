There are few function in spec with 'get-' prefix: get-local-name-from-QName get-namespace-from-QName get-namespace-uri-for-prefix get-in-scope-namespaces get-xxx-from-xxx does the prefix carries some meaning? 
Normally they are used for getter/setter pairs, but in core all functions are side-effect free. 
So why using longer and harder to remember names? 
Accessors are very similar set of functions but aren't using 'get-' prefix. 
For example get-local-name-from-QName should be analogous to local-name($n as node) Also hour/minute/second extractors should use singular forms. 
They are extracting named fields. 
SQL and most programming libraries already uses singular forms. 
I propose to change those names to: local-name-from-QName namespace-from-QName namespace-for-prefix in-scope-namespaces hour-from-XXX minute-from-XXX second-from-XXX day-from-XXX month-from-XXX year-from-XXX I think expression //visit[hour-from-time(@time)=12] looks more natural that //visit[get-hours-from-time(@time)=12] Second thing is doc() vs document() what is the rationale behind having two so similar functions? 
Especialy if you are trying to cut down function number. 
It could be very confusing for users using different languages Plus all functionality is available through another core functions so there is no extra work for implementators. 
Possibly it would be better to drop document(), but its not possible (compatiblility). 
So why not leave just document()?

... For example get-local-name-from-QName should be analogous to local-name($n as node) MK A personal view, I'm inclined to agree with you. 
(At one time, I proposed that where function names include a data type, we should write them in the form QName.local-name(), or dateTime.hour(). 
I still like that idea, but I don't think it found much favour.) NM Also hour/minute/second extractors should use singular forms.

MK Again, I'm personally inclined to agree. 
I do find it confusing that some are singular and some are plural.

MK XQuery wanted to have a simpler function. 
A lot of the complexity of the document() function is concerned with resolving a relative URI against a base URI, and that functionality is (rightly) now available in separate functions, resolve-uri() and base-uri(). 
This makes it possible to greatly simplify document(), and XQuery did not want to be unnecessarily constrained by compatibility with XSLT. 
The document() function has to be retained in its existing form in XSLT, but I could see it being deprecated at some time in the future. 
This is just a personal contribution, there will be a proper WG response in due course. 
Regards, Michael Kay Noe, The XML Query and XSL Working Groups discussed and decided to adopt your suggestion to eliminate the get- prefix on the functions you cited. 
Discussion is continuing on the other two issues you raised. 
Those decisions will be sent separately.

Regards, Noe Michejda 7th Portal S.C. Noe: Thank you for your comments. 
Pat Case has already replied to you informing you that the WGs agreed to remove the initial "get-" in function names. 
See As for the names of the extractor functions, we use the plural forms for extracting components from durations. 
This seems right, as durations typically have multiple years, hours, minutes, etc. 
We use the singular forms for extracting year, month and day from dateTime, date and time values. 
We use the plural forms when we extract hours, minutes and seconds from such values. 
This seems more natural to me but I'm happy to listen to arguments. 
fn:doc and fn:document - fn:doc is a simplified version of fn:document that the XQuery WG members found was sufficient for XQuery. 
fn:document() has been moved to the XSLT 2.0 specification. 
We agreed to adding a note there that explains why the two functions are needed. 
Please let us know if your comments have been satisfactorily addressed. 
All the best, Ashok From: public-qt-comments-request@w3.org [mailto:public-qt-comments-request@w3.org]

Regards, Noe Michejda 7th Portal S.C. extracting components from durations. 
minutes, etc. Yes, I agree. 
dateTime, date and time values. 
such values. 
This seems more If it is more natural depends on context. 
Hour sounds better in singular, but second and minute sometimes indeed are better in plural. 
My argument is that many existing APIs and languages uses singular forms, such as SQL or MFC libraries. 
And I think it will be nice to differentiate functions operating on duration and date/time, by using plural (quantity of seconds, minutes, hours in duration) and singular (value of component). 
that the XQuery WG members found was We agreed to adding a note there that explains why the two functions are needed. 
I rethinked this. 
Now I agree that complex behavior of document() can be undesirable in XQuery Regards, Noe Michejda 7th Portal S.C.
