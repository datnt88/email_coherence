<s> My two cents worth is - if you print a list of any sort, and most especially a long list, readers will possibly take that as an all inclusive list.  </s>
<s> If readers do so (consider the list to be all inclusive), we'll be getting all sorts of feedback along the lines of, "but, you forgot blah, blah, blah".  </s>
<s> It seems logical to assume that authors of materials in different languages only need to be asked to write clearly in their particular language, use common rules of grammar for their language and have web pages that follow the language of the particular web content (if it's scientific, write with that readership in mind and where possible write to a wider span of readers).  </s>
<s> Maybe a couple of examples but the issue there is in what languages will you promote this checkpoint?  </s>

<s> yn?lin=en&amp;url=http://www.neighborhoodnetworks.org) this page will redirect you to a translation page...but, the initial connection with this page is in English and no other language.  </s>
<s> Some might be able to muddle through it, even if they did not read English but accurate ideas about the links would be diminished if you were a non-English reader.  </s>
<s> But, maybe the HUD idea is better than no access at all...I dunno!  </s>

<s> Although it might fall somewhat outside their scope, we plan to consult with the W3C's internationalization working group in any case, so we could raise the question of checkpoint 4.1 with them on that occasion.  </s>
<s> I agree it should be clear which requirements/advice are relative only to a certain class of languages and which apply more generally.  </s>
<s> Perhaps one solution would be to state the assumptions specifically in the techniques, e.g., if the natural language of the content allows for certain types of grammatical constructs and these are relatively uncommon by comparison with certain other constructs then the latter should be used in preference to the former, where of course we would fill in the details as to exactly which constructs are under discussion.  </s>
<s> On the separate, but related, question of what goes in the advice section as opposed to the success criteria, it is important to recall the principles which the working group has agreed on, namely that success criteria must be machine/HIR testable: it must be determinately true or not true whether each success criterion is satisfied.  </s>
<s> Advisory items (in the "additional ideas") section are, by definition, not testable in this fashion, but ought to be taken into account in conducting a qualitative review of the content.  </s>
<s> So much has been agreed upon already.  </s>
<s> I think there is a dangerous temptation to conflate "advisory" with "low priority", and for people to argue that such-and-such an item should be "advisory", when what they really mean is that it should occupy the third conformance level.  </s>
<s> Let's keep considerations of testability separate from questions of conformance level.  </s>
<s> I am not accusing anybody in this discussion of confusing the two, just suggesting that there is a very real risk of doing so.  </s>
<s> With permission, I am forwarding this note from computational linguist Kurt Godden, Ph.D.  </s>
<s> I first met Kurt when he headed the Controlled Automotive Service Language (CASL) program at General Motors.  </s>
<s> He is now Principal Member of the Engineering Staff, Advanced Technology Labs, Lockheed Martin Corporation:  </s>
<s> I agree completely about the difficulties in trying to give specific success criteria based on syntactic constructs such as passive etc, where languages can differ so much.  </s>
<s> Given that you intend to cover content in any language, I think you are better off giving more abstract, higher-level success criteria, but you could use language-specific examples.  </s>
<s> An example of higher-level 'universal' criteria would be something like 'To the extent reasonable/feasible etc try to have no more than one clause per sentence.'  </s>
<s> That one may be a bit too restrictive, but it at least illustrates the principle.  </s>
<s> This rule would entail, for example, that you break up conjoined sentences, and (here is where it's probably too restrictive) would reduce/eliminate subordinate clauses.  </s>
<s> You'd also want to have some abstract guidelines that address issues of ambiguity and the need to reduce it, e.g. avoid noun phrases that consist of strings of noun modifiers.  </s>
<s> This is intended to reduce strings of nouns, which are often used in English technical literature, such as 'powertrain control module', because as these noun strings get longer, more and more ambiguity is introduced.  </s>
<s> Does the Nth noun modify its successor, or some other one?  </s>
<s> As a specific instance of this guideline, in the CASL project we had a rule for service authors not to use what we called "noun names" that consisted of more than 4 nouns in a row.  </s>
<s> We found sentences in published service manuals that had as many as NINE nouns strung together in a single NP.  </s>
<s> Only expert mechanics had a chance at understanding those things, and even they probably struggled.  </s>
<s> As an alternative, we gave examples in our author guidelines of how to break such long noun strings up into nouns with prepositional phrase modifiers.  </s>
<s> To the extent that long sentences also tend to be more complex than short sentences, you may want to consider something like a guideline on limiting the length of a sentence to being = some number of words.  </s>
<s> In CASL, we had a rule to write sentences no longer than 25 words, which seemed to work well in practice, and automatically forced simpler sentence structures.  </s>
<s> Of course, other languages won't work well for a guideline like this, e.g. Turkish or even German.  </s>
<s> Finally, you may want to say something additional about the selection of words/terminology.  </s>
<s> You do refer to giving explanations of new concepts/terms, but for non-technical terms you may want to say something about using commonly occurring words.  </s>
<s> The general idea I'm getting at is that I never liked those metrics like Flesch or the Fog Index that penalized words for having many syllables.  </s>
<s> By that criteria, the word 'automobile' is harder to understand than 'neem' (a kind of tree that grows in India, but the word appears in English dictionaries).  </s>
<s> What's important is the frequency of occurence of words in a language.  </s>
<s> Words with higher freqency of occurrence are more understandable, regardless of syllable length.  </s>
