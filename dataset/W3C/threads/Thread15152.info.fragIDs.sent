Update: I am seeking feedback from a few big guns (non-technical 
appelation) in the field of plain language and will report back as soon 
as I get answers. 
The issue in debate is the wisdom of listing elements that might seem weighted too heavily toward one language versus listing universal principles that might seem too weak to enforce across all languages. 
Any more thoughts from the list? 
Finally, I would appreciate any help from list members in Italy to translate elements of advice posted at the site for the Italian government's new plain-language campaign:

Hi, i must regret for the meeting of tomorrow... i think (i hope) that i can reach you by IRC... 
About this web site, this is done by the Ministry of Public Function and it means "clear". 
It has reference to the language used by italian public administration references when a citzen ask info. 
This is a web site created against the use of burocracy terms in documents and act. 
Need something of specific? 
let me know.

I am not suggesting that there is a problem of listing things that are 
specific to one language. 
I think it is sensible to do that. 
My opinion is 
that we should do it, and we should be clear about what languages things are 
useful for (so that nobody tries to apply rules for english to hebrew where 
they are not applicable).

I agree that it makes sense to list at least some elements by language -- that's 
where sites like the Italian "Chiaro" site and the U.S. government's 
plainlanguage.gov can come in handy as guides. 
I'll look for additional references for other languages ... any suggestions most welcome!

My two cents worth is - if you print a list of any sort, and most especially a long list, readers will possibly take that as an all inclusive list. 
If readers do so (consider the list to be all inclusive), we'll be getting all sorts of feedback along the lines of, "but, you forgot blah, blah, blah". 
It seems logical to assume that authors of materials in different languages only need to be asked to write clearly in their particular language, use common rules of grammar for their language and have web pages that follow the language of the particular web content (if it's scientific, write with that readership in mind and where possible write to a wider span of readers). 
Maybe a couple of examples but the issue there is in what languages will you promote this checkpoint? 
If you go to the government web site for HUD (http://www.hud.gov/cgi-bin/intercept?http://babel.altavista.com/translate.d 
yn?lin=en&amp;url=http://www.neighborhoodnetworks.org) this page will redirect you to a translation page...but, the initial connection with this page is in English and no other language. 
Some might be able to muddle through it, even if they did not read English but accurate ideas about the links would be diminished if you were a non-English reader. 
But, maybe the HUD idea is better than no access at all...I dunno!

Hi Avi, Well, next some references, - Make it Simple: European Guidelines for the Production of Easy-to-Read Information (in all the european languages, but I don't believe that they are applicable to all the document types, they are centered especially in people with cognitive deficiencies. 
In Sidar we are working to define what guidelines, of the version in Spanish, they would be applicable to all the documents.) - Guide de la redaction (Minist?re de la fonction publique et de la r?forme de l'Etat: - Fight the fog: (A very instructive and funny place, of the Service of Translation of the European Commission.) - Plain Language Commission I hope this helps you in their titanic task :-) Best Regards, Emmanuelle Guti?rrez y Restrepo Coordinadora del SIDAR | I agree that it makes sense to list at least some elements by language | -- that's | where sites like the Italian "Chiaro" site and the U.S. government's | plainlanguage.gov can come in handy as guides.

Thanks Emmanuelle (I didn't know about the Inclusion Europe and Guide de la redaction sites!) and thanks Doyle (linking to a translation page makes sense especially if the source language is written plainly or in a controlled language.) Avi 
Although it might fall somewhat outside their scope, we plan to consult with the W3C's internationalization working group in any case, so we could raise the question of checkpoint 4.1 with them on that occasion. 
I agree it should be clear which requirements/advice are relative only to a certain class of languages and which apply more generally. 
Perhaps one solution would be to state the assumptions specifically in the techniques, e.g., if the natural language of the content allows for certain types of grammatical constructs and these are relatively uncommon by comparison with certain other constructs then the latter should be used in preference to the former, where of course we would fill in the details as to exactly which constructs are under discussion. 
On the separate, but related, question of what goes in the advice section as opposed to the success criteria, it is important to recall the principles which the working group has agreed on, namely that success criteria must be machine/HIR testable: it must be determinately true or not true whether each success criterion is satisfied. 
Advisory items (in the "additional ideas") section are, by definition, not testable in this fashion, but ought to be taken into account in conducting a qualitative review of the content. 
So much has been agreed upon already. 
I think there is a dangerous temptation to conflate "advisory" with "low priority", and for people to argue that such-and-such an item should be "advisory", when what they really mean is that it should occupy the third conformance level. 
Let's keep considerations of testability separate from questions of conformance level. 
I am not accusing anybody in this discussion of confusing the two, just suggesting that there is a very real risk of doing so. 
With permission, I am forwarding this note from computational linguist Kurt Godden, Ph.D. 
I first met Kurt when he headed the Controlled Automotive Service Language (CASL) program at General Motors. 
He is now Principal Member of the Engineering Staff, Advanced Technology Labs, Lockheed Martin Corporation: 
I agree completely about the difficulties in trying to give specific success criteria based on syntactic constructs such as passive etc, where languages can differ so much. 
Given that you intend to cover content in any language, I think you are better off giving more abstract, higher-level success criteria, but you could use language-specific examples. 
An example of higher-level 'universal' criteria would be something like 'To the extent reasonable/feasible etc try to have no more than one clause per sentence.' 
That one may be a bit too restrictive, but it at least illustrates the principle. 
This rule would entail, for example, that you break up conjoined sentences, and (here is where it's probably too restrictive) would reduce/eliminate subordinate clauses. 
You'd also want to have some abstract guidelines that address issues of ambiguity and the need to reduce it, e.g. avoid noun phrases that consist of strings of noun modifiers. 
This is intended to reduce strings of nouns, which are often used in English technical literature, such as 'powertrain control module', because as these noun strings get longer, more and more ambiguity is introduced. 
Does the Nth noun modify its successor, or some other one? 
As a specific instance of this guideline, in the CASL project we had a rule for service authors not to use what we called "noun names" that consisted of more than 4 nouns in a row. 
We found sentences in published service manuals that had as many as NINE nouns strung together in a single NP. 
Only expert mechanics had a chance at understanding those things, and even they probably struggled. 
As an alternative, we gave examples in our author guidelines of how to break such long noun strings up into nouns with prepositional phrase modifiers. 
To the extent that long sentences also tend to be more complex than short sentences, you may want to consider something like a guideline on limiting the length of a sentence to being = some number of words. 
In CASL, we had a rule to write sentences no longer than 25 words, which seemed to work well in practice, and automatically forced simpler sentence structures. 
Of course, other languages won't work well for a guideline like this, e.g. Turkish or even German. 
Finally, you may want to say something additional about the selection of words/terminology. 
You do refer to giving explanations of new concepts/terms, but for non-technical terms you may want to say something about using commonly occurring words. 
The general idea I'm getting at is that I never liked those metrics like Flesch or the Fog Index that penalized words for having many syllables. 
By that criteria, the word 'automobile' is harder to understand than 'neem' (a kind of tree that grows in India, but the word appears in English dictionaries). 
What's important is the frequency of occurence of words in a language. 
Words with higher freqency of occurrence are more understandable, regardless of syllable length.
