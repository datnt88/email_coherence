I would expect that it would be more logical to do possibly split C into two steps: 2. bbbb 3. BBBB and then 2. bbbb 3. | 4. BBBB Reason: It is a simple Enter to create a new list item when cursor is at beginning of line and is already implemented. 
Cursor would be at beginning of line in my step C. I also think someone is more likely to immediately make something like this a new list item immediately before they insert a new list item in between. 
Thanks, though.
