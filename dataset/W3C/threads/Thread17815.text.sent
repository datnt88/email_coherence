I am not certain any more what checkpoints 7.2.2 and 7.2.6 are (since I believe they are not the ones currently in the document). 
I assume that they are to do with DOM, and perhaps navigation, but if there is to be a new Draft soon (i.e in about the next week) I would like to defer my action item until I can write in relation to that Charles I appologize, but the previous list of action items was not completely accurate.
