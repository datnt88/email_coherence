<s> Takes a few lines of code -- would you seriously expect DOM to save you the work of writing such a simple subroutine?  </s>
<s> If so, why?  </s>
<s> Dave, DOM allows me to access a childNode directly by using the item(index) method off of the nodelist that is returned from childNodes, rather than walking the nodelist.  </s>
<s> So, I was expecting that if I had the reference to the childNode, it would have an index property that I would be able to use for routines like this, rather than having to examine the nodelist itself.  </s>
<s> Am I really expecting too much?  </s>

<s> Right, the "list" can be implemented as an array (easy to implement the "item" method) or as a linnked list (more awkward) or some other data structure.  </s>
<s> Perhaps.  </s>
<s> If you got used to using it, the linked list implementation would accumulate some bizarre costs since it'd need to recompute that property pretty often ... but that'd be more reasonable than asking for a specific "is this child before that one" primitive, as you'd seemed to be suggesting!  </s>

<s> Furthermore, if the element is part of an entity, then no single index will work, as the element node may be in the tree in multiple places.  </s>

<s> Actually I tend to disagree on that one.  </s>
<s> There is some nasty text in the DOM spec saying that the "same" nodes are EntityRef children as are children of the respective Entity.  </s>
<s> Is that what you're thinking about?  </s>
<s> But that notion of "same" seems to me like it must be (equals?  </s>
<s> a b) rather than (eq?  </s>
<s> a b), to sneak in two LISP primitives ... since, unlike the case with LISP, DOM nodes have (non-null) ancestors that prevent them from being in more than one place at a time.  </s>
<s> A DOM is a tree, not a general graph.  </s>
<s> (Note to DOM WG: Perhaps the prose on that part of the DOM spec needs to say what it means by "same"?) - Dave  </s>
