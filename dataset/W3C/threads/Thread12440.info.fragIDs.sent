The recent thread of discussion on the IG list ("Aie it's HUGE", starting at demonstrates to me the need for a Content guidelines document that would sit between the business card quicktips and the full blown 50 pages Recommendation. 
Many people on the IG list have argued that this is something EO has to take care of. 
I don't see it in the current list, unless it goes under the article section. 
What do people think ? 
I'm inclined to agree. 
This whole issue came up when I sent Kynn Bartlett a copy of my powerpoint presentation that I am giving in 1/2 an hour here at Builder.com Live. 
I am giving an overview of the "A" section of the guidelines. 
Kynn went and looked through them on the Web and thus saw it in its hugeness. 
He has made some excellent points. 
People are not going to sit through the guidelines, trying to learn every detail on their own. 
Perhaps publishing these guidelines in some sort of book would be very helpful as well. 
More after my presentation. 
Also the authoring tools should help the designers so they don't have to read the whole system. 
Still I think writing a book could help the designers in understanding the issues. 
It could start from the different requirements that help understanding the users and the technologies, describe why it is important for the companies to consider these issues, then explain how the different guidelines form an integrated whole and finally go into the details of the guidelines explaining at least the most crucious issues. 
Also there should be a chapter explaining how the quicktips could be used as a heuristics in taking a quick look to the accessibility at the same time as the usability issues are considered by using usability heuristics. 
Maybe there could be a collection of writers.

I wonder if H1 , etc. will yield anything useful? 
One problem is that whatever gets done as an "in between" document will: take a lot of effort; be subject to the same quarrels; serve little purpose. 
The truth is that the guidelines are a reference work and that their size shouldn't be any problem since they should only be used from some sort of index.

ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE 
How about a booklet? 
Dena Shumila and I once produced concise "guidelines" on accessible html, without examples, that were two or three pages long. 
If I were doing it again, I would expand the business card by adding several additional points -- perhaps the ones we had to drop in the interest of keeping it short, and maybe -- MAYBE -- go into more detail. 
Again, the danger is that some people might conclude that this is it as far as accessibility is concerned. 
But again, if web designers were to adhere to these principles, our jobs would be much easier.
