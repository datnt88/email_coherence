<s> David- For what it is worth, the paper you cite is just the authors' opinions, not necessarily that of most of the others working on the Semantic Web.  </s>
<s> Personally, I would suggest you ignore it as far as practical impact goes - but my "scruffy" opinions on this issue have long been a matter of the public record.  </s>
