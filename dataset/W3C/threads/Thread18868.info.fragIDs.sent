The semantic meaning or concept underlying images is just as transferable, as texts are translate-able. 
The rich cultural context that images retain, means that their descriptions may well have no logical relationship. 
This adds rather than detracts from their importance, it just is not so convenient in a lexical theatre. 
Please take a look @ from a recent posting by David Poehlman Art in all its forms has much of this, and as a group WAI is significantly short of artists. 
3 problems: 
1  A document is accessible if it can be equally understood by its targeted audience regardless of the device used to access it. 2  having machine readable assertions of semantics .....is paramount for pervasive access. 
3  whereas non-textual content is often confined to a certain set of devices 1 
A document is accessible if it can be equally understood by its targeted 
audience regardless of the device used to access it. 
This seems too narrow a definition, in view of the various discussions on gl. (ie who is doing the targeting). 
Perhaps: A document is accessible if it can be understood by anyone, regardless of the device used to access it. 
Some might argue that a voiceless pda is useless to the blind, but that is a minor niggle, in any case the line that follows it: 
An accessible document is also defined as conforming to the Web Content 
Accessibility Guidelines. 
stands well enough on its own. 2 
This semantics knowledge can be provided through human readable 
documentation of course, but having machine readable assertions of semantics that can then be used to present the document in various media is paramount for pervasive access (that is, you don't need a programmer, you just need a program). 
Enabling others to map from your language to existing ones, or vice versa, is a useful accessibility feature. 
This glosses over the great difficulty we are having defining machine readable graphical objects.Work in this area is very useful, for all of us. 
I dispute the use of the word paramount as far too strong, it is convenient 
or do-able and nothing more. 
3 
Web content providers must able to offer alternative versions of their 
content if they wish to do so (as the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines tell them to do so). 
Textual alternatives, for instance, can be repurposed 
for many different output devices, whereas non-textual content is often confined to a certain set of devices. 
Thus, by allowing and encouraging 
synchronized textual alternatives, you allow your tagset to be more interoperable, and hence accessible. 
I suggest removing "whereas non-textual content is often confined to a certain set of devices" as unnecessarily biased, and trying to maintain a more neutral media bias.

Care when using "the" is urged. 
Yes, it is possible for text to have differing "semantics" in various situations but with images it is inevitable. 
A matter of degree and probabilities.

AG:: There is no one way about this. 
Understanding vs. misunderstanding is determined by comparing the divergence in interpretation with the precision requirements of the use to which the data are being put. 
Confusion over date formats have killed people in the coding of radiological devices. 
So text is just as misunderstandable as is an image. 
In fact, pictures have been added to drivers's licences in the U.S. in order to make the documents more secure: it is harder to misunderstand a comparison of the picture with the person than comparing, say, signatures. 
I believe that we can, however, say that what the XMLGL says is fact based on a more grubby, mechanistic analysis. 
The conventional .gif and .jpg 
representations used for images on the Web are not compatible with widely-deployed repurposing technology that does a reasonable job of recreating intelligibility the way that UniCode text is. 
This is just a statement of the state of the art in repurposing and media formats. 
There is a more mathematical theory that argues that text is more removed from experience, more highly encoded, and hence it is natural that it should be more repurposable on the whole, but we don't need to go there. 
If the test of repurposability is that it can be done so by techniques that it is reasonable to consider the user has available in their client, then the preponderance of image representations are more specific, less repurposable, than are words in text. 
This is not to say that the objective is not symmetrical. 
Text is not logically the foundation, experience is. 
But more indirect representation by means of encoded verbalisations about experience turns out to be more repurposable in the field today that a more direct emulation of visual sensort experience. 
Al 
I don't agree with what al has to say on this.* 
This definition of repurposable is highly questionable. 
ASCII may be more repurposable than kanji, however this is a remarkably reductionist viewpoint Moreover the issue is not which is more repurposable rather an other rather to raise awareness that all are useful representations. 
did anyone read any of the link @? the or perhaps a point being that whilst it has an absolute meaning namely 'at a cost of' it has cultural idioms, one currently prevalent being 'at the domain of'. 
Another being the rather more abstract naming of the symbol which has a cultural value. 
Now even words are names in themselves and share in this culture. 
Images seem to share far more richly, and are thus find more successful repurposing in complex situations. 
A reading of 'A Smile in Mind' would help here. 
A not so humourous imagery follows: *Uncle Sams trousers with a plane flying into them, makes little sense in text however it is a powerful image. 
Uncle Sam serves very many illustrators, and will continue to do so. 
Not everyone is an artist, however the collage of images is relatively easily achieved. 
The current repurposing (by machines) of images abilities are similar to amazons suggested book readings, not awful, but barely intelligent. 
There again screen readers are not human in their skills, and certainly navigation can be quite painful via this route.

- but will fight to the death for his right to say it? 
I am reminded of editorials written lamenting the disappearance of the old virtues contained in well-formed hand-written documents - but written by a person with an illegible hand using a word processor! 
The alt= "airplanes flying through Uncle Sam's legs" works for this audience at least as well as would the laboriously constructed political cartoon. 
And it could be readily repurposed with analogies about the underpinnings of the giant, etc. 
In fact that's what Jonathan did in lieu of making a drawing which would have required equal explanation. 
MOST graphics, in the context of the audience for our work, demand interpretation to a greater extent than much of our text. 
Else why don't we use hieroglyphics? 
All of which is an over-wordy say of siding with Al in maintaining that 
"The conventional .gif and .jpg 
representations used for images on the Web are not compatible with widely-deployed repurposing technology that does a reasonable job of recreating intelligibility the way that UniCode text is." [full stop] If that's what you disagree with, I think you need to re-examine your position.

To restate the 3 editorial points that I made, not just the one.... 3* Media like languages are alternatives, the title of a film tells me something about the film, but not a lot. 
Would you prefer to see the film or read the title? 
For those people that cannot see, the answer is perhaps clearer, though if they can hear, they might possibly prefer to listen, and not just have a machine read a text. 
Automated artificial voices are not generally preferred by many, though plenty like to listen to the professional voices of those they have never met. 
I don't feel that teletext is wildly successful, and if you asked the average punter to watch 'friends' in any xml repurposed form I think you'd have a problem. 
If you forced a nation to, you just might have a riot. 
All I am suggesting is that one could be more positive and say for instance: whereas non-textual content is less easily repurposed (by machines) at the present time. 
repurposing has a use, but no amount of xml will improve -on offering alternatives-. 
That is my case, they are alternatives and repurposing is only one tool in the kit bag. 
1 A document is accessible if it can be equally understood by its targeted audience regardless of the device used to access it. 
I don't think this makes sense, It is brief, but we've had problems defining accessibility, and this doesn't fit. 
2  This semantics knowledge can be provided through human readable documentation of course, but having machine readable assertions of semantics that can then be used to present the document in various media is paramount for pervasive access (that is, you don't need a programmer, you just need a program). 
Enabling others to map from your language to existing ones, or vice versa, is a useful accessibility feature. 
What efforts are being made to encourage semantic content of images to be exported? 
is it paramount? 
pervasive access often means providing a variety of media alternatives. 
Hope this doesn't all seem to contrary, but whilst recognising that tags normally contain text, I do feel that much is being attempted for the presentation of text, and little for the (cultural) dynamics of images, and all in the name of accessibility. 
No amount of text presentation will improve accessibility for people locked into a visual world.

AG:: Great, I think I have an idea now of what is eating you. 
On the last go, I couldn't grasp what the problem was, because the "text is convenient" truth and "definition of accessibility" are not on the same page, in my book. 
AG:: Whatever you disagreed with in what I said, I would like to agree with this. 
AG:: We should recognize that there is no feasible _definition_ of _accessible content_ and learn to work around this fact. 
AG:: Advocacy of image descriptions by advocacy groups. 
Check with EO to learn who. 
AG:: No. because most authors who provide information in images are sufficiently oriented to other modes of expression so that there is a usable resource without the images or graphics, aside from stupid things like images of text used as navigation links. 
AG:: Absolutely, Amen. 
Diversity is a master strategy. 
Text is convenient. 
They don't contradict one another. 
They address different levels in the flowdown. 
Yes, diversity, stated symmetrically with regard to rhetorical and media forms, is the higher principle. 
But that's no reason not to eventually state the other as we develop methods to address the need for diversity in both sense and rhetoric. 
There is a need for diversity in rhetoric. 
I hope that's not to psychobabble for you. 
The most direct way ordinary Joes can achieve a diversity in rhetoric is to "both show and tell" and pictures or diagrams are what often makes the most sense for 'show.' My beef is with the obsession with checkpoints. 
The appropriate response in terms of providing diversity in rhetoric is not readily captured in the "checkpoint" medium. 
So we need to generalize our notion of our product, or we are doing an unjust disservice to the people with cognitive disabilities whose needs are most readily addressed through the author-comprehensible devices of rhetorical diversity. 
Pictures are no the policy issue. 
Apropriate techniques to redress cognitive disability-linked inaccessibility vs. checkpoint religion is the policy issue. 
Sound files can help a lot. 
If the content is a poem, a sound file is more appropriate than a picture, probably. 
Alternatives to text are part of the agenda, and not completely solved by using graphics, just as diversity of content is not completely helped by text. 
But graphics is the long pole in the solution tent as regards cognitive barriers just as text is the long pole in the tent in the solution as regards sensory barriers. 
Each one is pre-emminent, but not all-sufficient, in its domain of competence. 
The chief advocacy opportunity here inside the W3C in this direction is to get the Consortium ot make a more substantive commitment, and expect a broader capability from, the Device Independence activity. 
Talk with William. 
Understanding the substitutability relations within a heap of multimedia fragments that can be assembled to tell a common story in different flows under different channel constraints is the core capability that Device Independence needs.

AG:: Mosaic, by putting The Web in contact with The GUI, precipitated a revolution which has made a large number of devices reach a large number of people with access to a shared body of lots of stuff, much more so than the text Internet including The Web did.

Al, This is my first attempt at coherent discussion since the events this week, so if I don't express myself well, please excuse .... Yes, I know that text is "re-purposable" by being representable visually, by sound (with special equipment), and in braille (with special equipment), but as unspecific as images and real-life visual experiences are, they are an important means of communication for many people. 
On Tuesday, when our nation was attacked by horrific terrorists, I was able to access only text until I got home from school and could see tv ... which was when I realized that my sister who lives in Pittsburgh had been vulnerable, and got offline to call her .... Another sister heard the news on the radio at school and groaned so deeply her students asked her what was wrong, and she said that Christy was in Pittsburgh ... We got a directive from our new superintendent to limit any "human" need to know what is happening on our part, and limit the exposure of our students to graphical images of the horror .... to limit the trauma that are happening to the children who saw their parents killed from the windows of their classrooms ..... images are what brought Americans together this week .... with words and text, but mostly images ..... think about it! 
Text didn't happen online until long after all events had transpired!

Would you prefer to see the film or read the title? 
If those are the only two choices, I would prefer to read the title. 
JC:: "Automated artificial voices are not generally preferred by many" WL: Several (most?) of the blind screen reader users I know much prefer synthetic voices. 
JC:: "repurposing is only one tool in the kit bag." WL: And that's a straw man because none of us ever suggested otherwise.
