<s> Hi There, The ability to follow links and pointers (or anchors) is probably worthwhile considering.  </s>
<s> Take a query such as - "get all paragraphs that contain a citation of a paper authored by Kohonen".  </s>
<s> This is a common requirement in bibliography searching where you want the exact context of the citation.  </s>
<s> If the citation reference is implemented as an anchor (XPointer?) then it will not include explicit author details and hence the paragraphs cannot be selected directly by using "Kohonen" as a search argument.  </s>
<s> Rather, having found Kohonen in the bibliography section of an article we need to take the citation-id and use it as a search argument in paragraphs selection (indirection).  </s>
<s> This may be too complex a requirement, but it is certainly a "nice to have".  </s>
<s> (This is akin to performing a join following a foreign key in an SQL query)  </s>
<s> It can be further enhanced if we were to support following links (XLink?) to other documents - for instance, extend the example above to include selection terms that can only be got at by inspecting the cited Kohonen paper itself (i.e, another document altogether).  </s>
<s> Indirection following XLinks and XPointers would be a really nice feature in a retrieval engine, albeit perhaps too complicated as an explicit and bare user interface feature.  </s>

<s> At one stage XQuery had a fairly general-purpose mechanism for following references from one node to another.  </s>
<s> However, it was never defined very precisely.  </s>
<s> The difficulty is that there are too many different ways of defining relationships in XML: IDREF, URIs, XPointer, application-defined foreign keys, schema-defined key/keyref, and so on.  </s>
<s> In fact there is a very general mechanism in XQuery that can handle all of these - the function call.  </s>
<s> I think this is the right mechanism, though if support for a particular technique such as XPointer becomes widespread, then we should probably provide a specific function to handle it within the core function library.  </s>
