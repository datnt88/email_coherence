<s> * "The URI syntax is organized hierarchically, with components listed in decreasing order from left to right."  </s>
<s> Should "in decreasing order" be "in order of decreasing significance"?  </s>
<s> * "If data for a URI component would conflict with the reserved purpose, then the conflicting data must be escaped (Section 2.4) before forming the  </s>
<s> URI." Shouldn't "escaped" be "encoded"?  </s>
<s> Doesn't "escaping" refer to the characters that actually appear, and doesn't "encoding" refer to what is represented, especialy if it doesn't actually appear?  </s>
<s> (An escape character "escapes" from the normal meaning of a following character.  </s>
<s> The special meaning of the escaped character may be to _encode_ some third character.  </s>
<s> - In the Unix shell input "echo \$PATH", the dollar sign is escaped by the backslash.  </s>
<s> (The backslash escapes from the normal meaning of the dollar sign (encoding a "command" to subsitite a variable) to a special meaning (encoding an actual dollar sign character).) - In C, in the escape sequence "\7", the backslash changes the meaning of the character "7" in the source from representing the character "7" (in the compiled code) to representing (encoding) a BEL character.  </s>
<s> - Similarly, in URIs, the escape sequence "%20" _encodes_ a space.  </s>
<s> The space isn't _escaped_.  </s>
<s> (It's not like the escaped spaces in "ls file\ with\ space".)  </s>
<s> - "...extends...to the first question-mark ("?"), number-sign ("#"), or  </s>
<s> the end of the URI string."  </s>
<s> probably should be: "...extends...to the first question-mark ("?") or number-sign ("#")  </s>
<s> or the end of the URI string."  </s>
<s> (Also, there are several similar non-parallel sentences.)  </s>
<s> - This: ...the URI mailto:fred@example.com has... would be less ambiguous if it were written with standard English quoting, as: ...the URI "mailto:fred@example.com" has...  </s>
<s> - "URI generating applications" should be "URI-generating applications"  </s>
<s> Daniel  </s>
<s> okay.  </s>
<s> Probably.  </s>
<s> I have replaced it everywhere with "percent-encoding" as  </s>
<s> part of yet another rewrite of the characters section.  </s>
<s> Your suggestion looks like bad grammar to me.  </s>
<s> Is this an obscure rule?  </s>
<s> Then it wouldn't be a fine example of the recommended quoting.  </s>

<s> ...-encoding" as  </s>
<s> Looking at it now, my suggestion probably could be clarified, but no, I don't think the principal of parallel construction is obscure.  </s>
<s> If you distribute "extends" over your "or" (like distributing multiplication over addition as in A x ( B + C ) = A x B + A x C), your wording: extends...to the first question-mark ("?"), number-sign ("#"), or  </s>
<s> the end of the URI string."  </s>
<s> yields: - extends to the first question mark  </s>
<s> or - extends to the first number sign or - extends to the first the end of the URI string.  </s>
<s> Note how that third branch comes out malformed.  </s>
<s> (In addition, note the reference to the _first_ end of the string, which doesn't make sense, confirming that one of your "ors" got grouped wrong.)  </s>
<s> You want the distributed version to be: - extends to the first question mark or - extends to the first number sign or - extends to the end of the URI string.  </s>
<s> That can be "factored" as: ...extends to the first question mark or number sign or to the end of the URI string  </s>
<s> (clearer than my original suggestion) or as:  </s>
<s> ...extends to the first question mark or number sign or the end of the URI string (my original suggestion, admittedly probably less clear).  </s>
<s> (Of  </s>
<s> course, other "factorings" are possible.) (P.S. "Number sign" and "question mark" aren't hyphenated (in English...at least in American English...at least in American English I know).) Daniel  </s>
