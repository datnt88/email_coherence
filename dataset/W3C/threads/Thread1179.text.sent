Hi all. 
I'm just a happy tidy luser. 
I've just upgraded to HTML Tidy for Linux/x86 released on 1st October 2003 and I'm seeing some breakage where I didn't before. 
When processing an XML document containing this:: application Creme /application is not so much a single application, as an emphasis integration /emphasis of a wide range of Open Source components. the result is this:: application Creme /application is not so much a single application, as an emphasis integration /emphasis of a wide range of Open Source components. 
When I generate HTML from this, I get "Cremeis" and "integrationof" instead of "Creme is" and "integration of". 
Is there a way to tell tidy not to throw the spaces away? 
I tried 'tidy -xml --indent auto' and 'tidy -xml'. 
Jean Jordaan * Jean Jordaan [Tue, 24/02/2004 at 14:50 +0200] Did you try this: tidy -i -xml -asxml This file: test application Creme /application is not so much a single application, as an emphasis integration /emphasis of a wide range of Open Source components. 
/test gives this: is not so much a single application, as an of a wide range of Open Source components. 
/test Jany Hi Jany The output you get is what I *used* to get before the upgrade. 
I'm not sure exactly what version of tidy I had before .. let's see .. I'm on Gentoo Linux. 
The Gentoo packaging setup says that I used to have this: app-text/htmltidy-0.8.4 Now I have this: app-text/htmltidy-3.10.29 '-asxml' is: "to convert HTML to well formed XHTML" but my output isn't XHTML at all, it's XML. 
It still gives me the same output, too .. The problem with the output you get (and which I used to get, and which actually prompted me to upgrade, hoping for a fix ;) is that this *inserts* spaces before punctuation following inline tags! 
This:: /application LDAP directory server /application , an would become:: , an which gives ugly HTML looking like "server , an". 
Jean Jordaan This is a known problem. 
Patches welcome... Hi Bjoern Ah. 
I'm afraid I'm not quite up to a patch :/ For now, this works for me (in Vim): :%s?\( /\a\{-} \)\([^ ,. ]\)?\1 \2?g Jean Jordaan
