I like the first proposal. 
The second one may be exactly appropriate in some circumstances, but I have a concern about it. 
SKOS seems to be an ontology representing the important things needed to represent thesauri (i.e. it creates a sub-language for representing specific thesauri.) 
That is to say, the classes in SKOS represent language constructs used to create thesauri, RATHER than representing things in the world that are of interest (e.g. lions). 
This distinction is evident by using the name "LionConcept" rather than "Lion". 
This use of RDFS is as a meta-language, used to define a thesaurus language. 
So the concern I have is mixing up use of RDFS/OWL as an ontology language for representing domains directly, vs. a meta-language for representing other representation languages/notations. 
A close analogy of this would be to say, use OWL (or RDFS) to represent another ontology language. 
For example, we could create an OWL ontology with classes that referred to Flogic language constructs. 
e.g. OWL classes named: 'FlogicCLass' and 'FlogicAttribute'... 
This is a very different use of OWL, than representing domains directly. 
It is certainly not the main intended use if OWL, and really is using OWL as a meta-language. 
Mike Sorry, resending this correcting some N3 syntax mistakes ... I believe the best way to express the fact that a particular image depicts a 
thing which is a member of the class of Lions would be to say (this is the 
FOAF model): LionImage aAnimalImage; foaf:depicts[aLion]. 
Lion aowl:Class; subClassOfMammal. 
Mammalaowl:Class. 
AnimalImageaowl:Class. 
The alternative way of expressing similar information is to use the dc:subject property along with the SKOS model [2] for describing concepts 
that are intended to act as 'subjects' or 'topics' for information resources. 
LionImage aAnimalImage; dc:subjectLionConcept. 
LionConcept askos:Concept; skos:prefLabel'Lions'; skos:broaderMammalConcept. 
MammalConcept 
askos:Concept; skos:prefLabel'Mammals'; skos:narrowerLionConcept. 
The SKOS vocab already defines a class 'Concept' and a set of properties for 
organising concepts into a hierarchy, without demanding that the hierarchy 
implies a subclass relationship. 
I refer the WG to the document [2] which 
outlines the SKOS-Core schema, although you should currently ignore the final section on 'using SKOS-Core with DC and FOAF' as this will change 
shortly to be in line with the model of usage that I have briefly described 
here. 
Yours, Alistair.

Mike's argument is the same I held for WordNet. 
One thing is considering wordnets, thesauri, terminologies as informal ontologies, and then reengineering them to get full-fledged ontologies, and another thing is trying to describe their current structure. 
The second one can have interesting uses, provided that we do not mix ontologies and structures in the same domain. 
In the WordNet task force, we have decided to give recommendations for both things, and explaining the different results, advantages, and uses.

I'm glad that this has been recognized and that care is being taken to keep the two cases separate. 
It can be massivly confusing to mix them up.
