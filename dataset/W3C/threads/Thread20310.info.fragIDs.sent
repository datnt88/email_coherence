<s> Amaya does not recognize such links on the main screen, but it does in the Links window.  </s>
<s> For example, go to http://www.phil.uni-passau.de/lehrst.shtml and click on "Politikwissenschaft (Politische Theorie und Ideengeschichte)" (somewhere down the page) where a linebreak occurs between "und" and "Ideengeschichte (at least on my screen, may depend on the width of your Amaya window).  </s>

<s> In that page Amaya has a problem with the attribute height of TD elements when their contents is greater but no problem with long hrefs /a At least my version of Amaya does not recognize the href in the main and alternate windows, but it does so in links window.  </s>
