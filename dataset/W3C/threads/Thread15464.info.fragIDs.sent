<s> Present all of the sequenced elements in the given order, then the non-sequenced elements in the order in which they appear in the document?  </s>
<s> This is indeed a problem with the "sequence number" approach, and it is one reason why I thought that, in general, a "tree transformation" method would be preferable.  </s>
<s> It does not require each element to be equipped with an ID value and can move entire classes of similar elements by means of a single style property.  </s>
<s> Would the current HTML table proposal, perhaps with the addition of an attribute to indicate the "orientation" of the table, be sufficient, or is there a genuine need for the ability to reorganise a table totally by means of ID values being associated with each cell?  </s>
<s> I find it hard to envisage circumstances in which such a complete reorganisation would be necessary, except where the table markup is misused, and as mentioned earlier, such a practice should not be tacitly endorsed by the WAI markup work.  </s>

<s> On the other hand, if all the elements that one wants to sequence are give IDs in the HTML, it is reasonable to ask if [I don't know] CSS2 can sequence them and if not, why not.  </s>
<s> This seems like a reasonable approach.  </s>

<s> I see this as an appropriate topic for browser creativity.  </s>
<s> Given that we know the order may wish to vary based on the medium, we should let those expert in the medium make the call.  </s>
<s> An example of how one might want to handle this is speech is to present things in HTML-text-appearance order until hitting the element ID1 which starts the sequence constraint.  </s>
<s> The the order would be element marked ID1 link to element ID4 textually between ID1 and ID2 etc. element marked ID2 link to element ID7 textually between ID2 and ID3 etc. element marked ID3 element ID4 etc.  </s>
<s> The elements subject to the continuous-text constraint would be read in sequence once one of them was encountered, but the places where other items had been deferred would be filled with placeholders linking to where they appeared in the presentation sequence.  </s>
<s> That is just an example of a feasible policy with some thought to minimizing disruption.  </s>
<s> As I say, the HTML policy should be not to have a policy other than that the browser should allow the user the choice to read ID1, ID2, ID3 consecutively in the right order.  </s>
<s> It's broken if you can't discover or follow the sensible order.  </s>
<s> It's not necessary to fix it to make any global order a straightjacket.  </s>
