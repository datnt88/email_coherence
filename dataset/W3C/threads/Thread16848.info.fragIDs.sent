Hi All, I've been asked to answer a couple of points regarding website accessibility 
for some potential business. 
Social inclusion pleasantly being an imporant 
aspect of the development. 
I found myself starting off initially with the 
somewhat unqualified statement: 
"It is widely accepted by the accessibility communitee that it is not currently realistic to sensibly provide a fully accessible solution to this 
problem for all social groups at this time". 
The problem being a web portal comprising numerous backend systems which 
come together to deliver dynamic content potentially in a variety of formats 
and using a variety of media. 
Even if we reduce the problem to a straight 
forward online flight booking system for example I personally don't believe 
it is possible to cater for all sensibly at this time? 
Just taking the visually impared and learning disabilities alone I feel moves the problem 
into potentially two separate solutions with the VI requiring textual feedback and learning disabilities perhaps more familiar with some kind of 
SVG approach? 
And if people with learning disability happen to come from a 
deprived social background then they may not even have access to a suitably enabled browser. 
I'm not necessarily saying it can't be done, just that it is currently unrealistic (or perhaps I should use "commerically viable" here!!! and stop beating around the bush) to expect access for all. 
I'm a little unconfortable saying that really and I'm sure that given enough time and money even today it would potentially be possible to produce a fully accessible site. 
But we hever have enough time or money do we? 
I just felt it would be helpful to start off my work with a can't please all of the people all of the time but... and concentrating on what we can do rather than adding exceptions to everything I suggest. 
Feedback as ever very much appreciated.

If you look at WCAG 1.0 or Section 508, then is undoubtedly true. 
Adherence to either places a much lower priority on the needs of some groups than on others, and also sets up a competition between the needs of some groups and the needs of others. 
So I would say this is a legitimate statement. 
This is why an adaptive/transformative approach is most valuable. 
The idea that all users can be equally served by a single user interface is one which should have died years ago. 
Unfortunately, it's 2002 now and we have yet to see fully-deployed increased accessibility adaptive transformations. 
:( You have accurately identified a weakness in current accessibility thinking. 
The solution, as I see it, is to change our thinking and realize that multiple interfaces need to be constructed. 
If you are already assembling a portal system which separates the business logic (backend) from the front (dynamic content) then you are already advantaged when it comes to building a functioning adaptive transformation system. 
You can get better results for a broader group of users by creating multiple templates which meet a diversity of needs.

The basic fact that you cannot make your web offering usable by 100% of everyone is just true. 
On the other hand, for the kind of system you are contemplating, there are things to consider that will make a big difference in who can and cannot use the result. 
The fact that some of us think you can reach more of everyone with pattern-generated alternative forms from the servers is partly why the openness to "server-side diversity" is still in WCAG 2.0. 
And in your situation where you are joining information services from multiple backends, there is cause to question why you cannot support multiple frontends as well. 
You have the uncomfortable opportunity to lead the charge _for_ information integration across the services coming from the multiple backends and _against_ creating a system of plumbing stovepipes for inaccessible media channels pasted together in the pixel domain. 
If you design the voice interface to each backend service first, you may be surprised at how easy and how adaptive the fleximode composite actually is. 
Al 
or we could just multiply the thinking and take all the best known strategies and follow them. 
I will never understand how a system will deliver the just right choice.
