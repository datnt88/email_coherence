<s> Yes, I think it is important to work on the errata for WCAG 1.0, and publish a lightly revised version of that spec.  </s>
<s> One of the reasons that Fundaci?n Sidar is participating in the EuroAccessibility Consortium is the hope that it will provide some people to do the work which such a revision implies.  </s>
<s> The diversion effect Joe warned of is important to take into account, but so is the fact that real world developers and accessibility practictioners currently have to work with WCAG 1.0, and consequently end up doing a lot of their own interpretation.  </s>
<s> I think that it is worth changing the version - producing a WCAG 1.1 that has the same structure, doesn't change checkpoint text, conformance schemes, etc, except to incorporate errata and similar things (updated interpretations of "until user agents ..." checkpoints for example).  </s>
<s> It is also important to work on the techniques for WCAG 1.0 - providing (and getting agreement from the working group on) examples of how to meet a checkpoint, and further discussion.  </s>
<s> Naturally enough the WCAG group is working in this area, and I would suggest that anyone interested in this kind of work look into it further... with regard to revising WCAG 1.0 I suspect that an important ingredient is a number of people prepared to take on the work - and to join the WCAG working group to do so.  </s>

<s> So: What are we gonna do here?  </s>
<s> 1. Divert mindshare and time to produce a WCAG 1.0 errata document, 2. Keep working on WCAG 2.0 such that 2.0 includes all the fixes for the errata of 1.0.  </s>
<s> Technically there is already an errata for WCAG 1.0, but I think that a cohesive effort needs to be made in order to fold those problems, and other issues, back into the original WCAG 1.0 and issue not an errata, but a "second edition."  </s>
<s> [snip] This is the approach that should be taken with WCAG 1.0, in preparation for WCAG 2.0 -- I think that by explicitly identifying and solving the small changes in WCAG 1.0, it will actually help to produce a cleaner, tighter, and more usable WCAG 2.0 eventually, somewhere down the road.  </s>
<s> As Tina said, we're going to be stuck with WCAG 1.0 for a while, and it's important that the W3C be seen as properly managing that document throughout its lifetime.  </s>

<s> OK, for example, these two messages-- -- discuss the errors in WCAG 1.0, and Phill mentioned the idea of errata for WCAG 1.0, which someone else had brought up a while ago.  </s>
<s> Kynn, I think.  </s>
<s> So: What are we gonna do here?  </s>
<s> 1. Divert mindshare and time to produce a WCAG 1.0 errata document, which I believe would be hugely useful for real-world developers but would take weeks or months of discussion and also require pushing 1.0  </s>
<s> through a sieve to find all the errata.  </s>
<s> And 1.0 is an old, dead, deficient specification.  </s>
<s> We'd be exhuming a mummy and giving it a haircut and manicure, essentially.  </s>
<s> 2. Keep working on WCAG 2.0 such that 2.0 includes all the fixes for the errata of 1.0.  </s>
<s> I know I am months behind, *months* behind, evaluating the entirety of 2.0 for its errors.  </s>
<s> I got through like five pages and even that took nearly an hour to annotate on paper, and would require twice that time just to type out the errors.  </s>
<s> These days I'm responding to specific requests to propose improvements to multimedia-related guidelines as a focus for my time.  </s>
<s> So I don't personally know what to do to contribute to the guidelines, don't know what we should all do, don't know whether WAI-IG is the better list than -GL to talk about this, yet am still very attracted to the idea of a 1.0 errata document instead even though I know it would take time away from developing 2.0, which is already likely to be late.  </s>

<s> Supported. Whilst WCAG 1.0 may be an old, dead, deficient specification - not all agree there - it is still one which is nailed to the wall in several places.  </s>
<s> The EU adopted it as their standard as late as 2001; the Swedish equivalent recommendations in May of 2002.  </s>
<s> Whether we like it or not, we'll be stuck with WCAG 1.0 for some time to come.  </s>
