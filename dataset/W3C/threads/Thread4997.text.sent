ACTION: EricP to take over face-to-face registration ACTION: DanC to work on face-to-face agenda We discussed various existing Use Cases: - the examples or user stories *are* our use cases - tell-me-about-x UC should perhaps be split into several others: data/metadata browser and metadata crawler - address precisely what user wants to do with email address in AndyS's "find John Smith's email address" - some consensus around solving the john-smith email case ACTION: PatrickS to write this use case up - general approval of Alberto's restatement/solution of DanC's geolocation use case - DaveB spoke in support of - DaveB asked for more use cases. 
- KendallC asked for more use cases specifically about uses of protocol. 
- AlbertoR asked that UCs might be organized into types or categories. 
Straw poll suggested that structuring ongoing discussion about use cases around a document would be more helpful than continuing in a free-form way. 
DanC solicited one-page outlines of such a document be emailed to him directly. 
Thanks for the timely record. 
A few comments... to wit: minutes: RDF DAWG telcon 17 March for review Wed, 17 Mar 2004 18:00:16 -0600 (ammended to show regrets from PatrickS) (very handy to have a pointer from this week's minutes to last week's minutes. 
very important to cite things like "Minutes" by URI, date, subject, title, author, etc.) I think that was Jos. 
Dan Connolly, W3C http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/ see you at the WWW2004 in NY 17-22 May? 
I thought my action was to write up my variant of the "tell me about" use case, which is completed. 
And I'm happy with Andy's reworked version of the john smith email use case.
