<s> It is not your fault.  </s>
<s> I had doubts about going to 2nd last call without a complete review of the semantics doc.  </s>
<s> I suppressed them, which in hindsight was a mistake.  </s>
<s> That is life.  </s>
<s> The world is not a perfect place, and one of the things I'm learning is just how hard it is, even for very clever people, to get things like proofs right.  </s>
<s> I forget what it was like programming in languages that didn't do a lot of checking of the program at compile time.  </s>
<s> This seems like writing in machine code without even a machine to test the code on - all one has is testing by inspection.  </s>
<s> I hope to have really nice proofs done  </s>
<s> I think we have to assess how to react to this little problemette.  </s>
<s> I think we make life more difficult for ourselves, not easier, if we try to rush things through before we are really ready.  </s>
<s> We should ask ourselves whether we still believe we are ready for lc2.  </s>
<s> On the one hand: - the proofs are informative - they are there to convince ourselves, and others, that the claims we make are justified, e.g. with respect to the relationship between the entailment rules and the MT. - thus W3C process allows for them to be corrected during last call without forcing another last call, provided its just the proof thats wrong, not the conclusions.  </s>
<s> On the other hand: - there are bugs in the proofs - we are not done on the semantics document and we have not yet addressed all our issues with it.  </s>
<s> The latest message from Peter suggests we are not done discussing this yet.  </s>
<s> By that critereon, semantics is not ready for 2nd last call.  </s>
<s> Options: - go ahead with the second last call announcement - hold off the second last call announcement till we have sorted the problems with semantics (how?). - go ahead with all except semantics?  </s>
