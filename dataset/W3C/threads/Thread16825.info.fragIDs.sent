<s> If you really, really insisted on doing this, you should use acronym title="learning disability" LD /acronym inside a /a .  </s>

<s> In any event, you need annotate only the first occurrence of the term to comply with the spec.  </s>

<s> Marking up abbreviations can be very helpful in ensuring adequate representation of keywords in site searches.  </s>
<s> Consider a search for "World Wide Web" versus a search for "www" - both are contextually very different, and will yield unique results.  </s>
<s> Increasing the relevance of search results is a keystone of accessibility in my opinion.  </s>
<s> Further, users with cognitive disabilities such as memory loss, and attention disorders could receive benefit from abbreviation markup if their browser/agent supports tool-tips for them.  </s>

<s> thanks jonathan chetwynd peepo project manager  </s>
<s> And those who don't won't know what "learning difficulties" mean, as it is a jargon term with a specific meaning which is narrower than the naive interpretation.  </s>
<s> On the practical side, I agree with your basic view.  </s>
<s> In addition to problems  </s>
<s> with implementations, abbr and acronym markup was never _defined_ semantically in a useful way that could form the basis for making use of the  </s>
<s> markup in various programs, including browsers.  </s>
<s> There's little point in trying to persuade authors into using markup that lacks well-defined meaning  </s>
<s> and that has unpredictable results.  </s>
<s> On the forward-looking side, or perhaps utopistically, I think that markup  </s>
<s> for familiar acronyms could be very useful, for accessibility and other  </s>
<s> purposes.  </s>
<s> Well, yes, it would, and nested a elements would not, in pre-XHTML HTML.  </s>
<s> (The "X" means, among other things, less expressive metalanguage, so that the prohibition to nest a elements needs to be said in prose for XHTML.) No, I don't see any particular reason why the prohibition to nest a elements was taken into HTML, but I digress.  </s>
<s> Maybe, but some of them might not _remember_ it easily.  </s>
<s> Besides, a "reader" of the page could be an indexing robot, a speech-based browser, or an automatic translation program.  </s>
<s> Suppose I know English just a little and would benefit even from a relatively poor translation.  </s>
<s> (Lack of linguistic capabilities is a form of disability, in a sense.) If abbreviations were marked up, with their expansions, even very simple translation technology could produce better results in many cases; in this example, it could behave as if the expansion appeared in place of the abbreviation.  </s>
<s> Naturally, such strategy would easily lead into disaster too: translating "World Wide Web" word by word (and perhaps then forming an initialism from them!) would produce something rather incomprehensible.  </s>
<s> Hence, before encourageing authors into using markup for abbreviations and  </s>
<s> acronyms, quite a lot of work with _defining_ them needs to be done, and  </s>
<s> this involves considering how the information in the markup would actually be used and how the uses might conflict.  </s>
<s> There's little hope before the specifications even define abbr and acronym reasonably with respect to each other; cf. to the analysis at  </s>

<s> If the explanation that gives Mr. Ben Meadowcroft is correct, it contradicts the explanation and the form in that we understand the difference between abbreviations and acr?nimos, in Spanish, according to the Real Spanish Academy of the Spanish Language in answer to a consultation that I made him: For us the difference doesn't consist in if the abbreviation is pronounced or not like a word.  </s>
<s> For us the difference rests in if we "translate" what means, or not.  </s>
<s> For example, in Spanish, "F.B.I." it is an acr?nimo (We pronounce the initials, we don't translate their meaning, maybe in English when somebody finds that abbreviated form he/she reads: "Federal Bureau of Investigation").  </s>
<s> That which means that in the future it can have difficulties to locate terms if some automatic system can make searches in the net for acronyms and of abbreviations.  </s>
