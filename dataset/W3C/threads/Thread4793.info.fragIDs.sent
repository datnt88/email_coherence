<s> Trying to get more info on your position ... I think the reason that people have suggested using XPath only in URIs is that it is effectively a read-only path expression language whereas XQuery can do construction and create new XML constructs.  </s>
<s> When you say "any query language" are you suggesting that all features of XQuery including functions, modules, constructions of new XML, the forth coming update language, etc. must all be supported in URIs?  </s>

<s> Hi Paul,  </s>
<s> I'd say that any feature which can be used to construct queries should be able to do so in URI form.  </s>
<s> AIUI, that would include functions and modules, yes.  </s>
<s> As for "constructions of new XML" and an "update language", I'm not familiar with either, but those descriptions don't necessarily rule them out from being usable in URI form.  </s>
<s> What would rule them out would be if either were used to change the state of any resources, as a SQL UPDATE would do (as one example).  </s>
