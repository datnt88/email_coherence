Perhaps XPath is the right level for this? 
Perhaps, but I feel strongly that any query language on the Web (and especially those developed in the W3C) should be able to use URIs. 
Trying to get more info on your position ... I think the reason that people have suggested using XPath only in URIs is that it is effectively a read-only path expression language whereas XQuery can do construction and create new XML constructs. 
When you say "any query language" are you suggesting that all features of XQuery including functions, modules, constructions of new XML, the forth coming update language, etc. must all be supported in URIs?

There are limits to what fits easily on a URI. 
A 12 page query 
with 
functions and schema imports probably doesn't naturally fit into 
this 
framework. 
Probably not, no. 
But for smaller, perhaps simpler queries, I 
think it 
would be enormously useful. 
Where the WG decides to draw this 
line, I 
don't know (FLWR??). 
But I also wonder if drawing a line may be 
more 
work than covering the general case, and then letting your 
customers 
(XQuery processor designers and app-developers) decide what's too 
big 
to 
go in a URI. 
8-) That's totally your call, of course, but anything 
you 
can do in this direction would be progress, I'd say, and would 
address 
my concern.

I'm 
also not convinced that a general XQuery URI serialization isn't possible.

Hi Paul, 
I'd say that any feature which can be used to construct queries should be able to do so in URI form. 
AIUI, that would include functions and modules, yes. 
As for "constructions of new XML" and an "update language", I'm not familiar with either, but those descriptions don't necessarily rule them out from being usable in URI form. 
What would rule them out would be if either were used to change the state of any resources, as a SQL UPDATE would do (as one example).

Hi Mark, It's not clear to me whether you want to enter this as a last-call comment against the current XQuery documents. 
These are replies to a thread that started in October. 
If you do want to enter this as a last call comment, could you please start a new thread that clearly says that? Thanks! 
Jonathan
