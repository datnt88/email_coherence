I have a question about "value" attribute of the Attr interface in the DOM spec. 
If I modified the children of Attr node, is it same or not that "value" attribute content before and after this modification ? 
Must the getValue() always generate "value" from Attr node's children ? 
KAZUMI Saito FUJITSU Laboratories Ltd. Kazumi, If you modify the child nodes of Attr node, Attr.value attribute should reflect the changes. 
Don Park Docuverse As I read it, the string "value" of an Attr should always be the concatenation of the string values of its children. 
Changing the children changes its value, and calling Attr.setValue() replaces the children with the new text.
