<s> [Please accept my apologies if this has already been discussed; I did not find it in the list archives.]  </s>
<s> I have been looking at the Annotea protocol, and it seems that one HTTP GET request must be issued to retrieve each annotation body.  </s>
<s> If a client wants to retrieve the list of annotations for a page as well as all of the associated bodies, it can't do so very efficiently.  </s>
<s> Or did I miss something in the spec?  </s>
<s> Are people open to extending the protocol to allow this kind of query?  </s>
<s> If so, I'd be happy to experiment a bit and propose something concrete.  </s>

<s> This optimisation assumes that the server has the bodies itself.  </s>
<s> This isn't (in a number of the cases I have played with) a valid assumption.  </s>
<s> So while I have no problem with allowing a query that includes "please give me all the annotation metadata and bodies that you have for FOO", I think requiring it would seriously restrict the usefulness of the protocol.  </s>
<s> A simple example is to think of descriptions of images, where a user might make an annotation to provide an explicit linkage that can be automatically retrieved.  </s>
<s> This is a common accessibility use case (making an alternative representation available for a person who cannot clearly see or interpret the picture) where one might often expect to find the body of the annotation is an existing resource on the web, referred to rather than held by the annotea server.  </s>

<s> Thanks for your reply -- and good point.  </s>
<s> I admit I was thinking of what I, in my admittedly limited experience, believe will be a common scenario: text annotation bodies of relatively short length that are stored (or cached) by the same server that holds the annotation metadata.  </s>
<s> You are right that many other scenarios are valid as well.  </s>
<s> But I'd like to see an option to return the bodies if the server has them.  </s>

<s> Protocol can be extended and we are open to suggestions.  </s>
<s> Naturally we need to do it carefully and weight the pros and cons with the people already using the protocol.  </s>
<s> But there are other users who have similar needs too.  </s>
<s> Eric just started a public Annotea developers list: the right forum to discuss about the details and then report back to www-annotation.  </s>
