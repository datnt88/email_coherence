<s> To the W3C Ontology Working Group - In section 3.2., Ontology evolution, of Requirements for a Web Ontology Language, you state "An important issue of revision is whether or not documents that commit to one version of an ontology are compatible with those that commit to another.  </s>
<s> Both compatible and incompatible revisions should be allowed, but it should be possible to distinguish between the two.  </s>
<s> Note that it is possible for a revision to change the intended meaning of a term without changing its formal description.. Thus determining semantic backwards-compatibility requires more than a simple comparison of term descriptions.  </s>
<s> As such, the ontology author needs to be able to indicate such changes explicitly.  </s>
<s> " I don't get it.  </s>
<s> How can the meaning of a term within a universe of discourse change, yet its formal description remain the same?  </s>
<s> Isn't that what ontologies are for - to encode meaning?  </s>
<s> Unless you intend that "formal description" simply refers to the human readable documentation comments within the ontology, and not the encoded semantics of the term.  </s>
<s> If so, that is not clear from the above.  </s>
<s> Please clarify.  </s>
<s> Thank you, Hal Noyes Oracle DBA Howard Systems International  </s>
<s> Hal,  </s>
<s> Thank you for your question.  </s>
<s> It is usually impossible to completely formalize a domain.  </s>
<s> For example, consider how you would formalize the definition of what it means to be a person.  </s>
<s> An ontology is simply an approximation that consists of a set of axioms (definitions) that the  </s>
<s> ontology author feels is "close enough" to his or her intended meaning.  </s>
<s> If a change to the intended meaning is a subtle one, then the old formal definition may still accomodate the new meaning.  </s>
<s> For example, consider an ontology that said Employee was a subclassOf Person and did not express any additional definitional information about the class Employee.  </s>
<s> If the original intended meaning of this may class was full-time employees, then a change to include consultants as members of the class would not necessitate a change in its formal definition, because it was loose enough to accomodate either meaning.  </s>
<s> In such cases, the comment should indicate the intended meaning of the concept, in order to help people use it correctly.  </s>
<s> Would it be better to create a new term and include additional formal definitional information?  </s>
<s> Certainly, and the web ontology language will support this.  </s>
<s> However, from an ontology author's point of view, this is not always practical, particularly if mistakes were made in early versions of an ontology.  </s>
<s> If you used a term incorrectly in an early version of an ontology, should it be bound to that definition for all time?  </s>
<s> I think not.  </s>
<s> Issues like this are the motivation for that ontology evolution design goal.  </s>
<s> Jeff Heflin  </s>
<s> Jeff - I think Hal makes a good point - your explanation (below) is correct, but the wording in the report is somewhat ambiguous.  </s>
<s> This might be a good place to tighten up the language and maybe to give an example -- in particular, the term "formal description" could imply underlying semantics rather than the syntactic OWL expression.  </s>
