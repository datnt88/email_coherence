In the minutes of the recent HTML WG audio call, there was said to be a need to "partition the name space" of media types. 
As I understand it, the intention is to reserve a media type called "other" (or an equivalent name), and then to limit HTML user agents to the list of base types which has thereby been established. 
I do not understand the rationale behind this proposal, and nor is it necessary. 
User agents should simply ignore any base type that (1) is not one of the predefined base types in the HTML specification; and (2) has not been defined by the style language which is currently in effect. 
A minimally conforming HTML user agent would ignore any media type that is not exactly one of the predefined types mentioned in the specification. 
If any parameters are added to the base type which the user agent can not interpret, then the resource to which the media type relates (E.G. a style sheet) should not be accessed. 
I'm a little confused by the position taken here. 
If I get a document with a pointer to a media="braille embossed" CSS file and HTML and my CSS setup only defines "braille", am I suppoed to ignore it altogether ? 
I think we are OK, here. 
to follow up on what Jason White said: 
This was a comment from a participant. 
The action taken was that this is on the list of topics where the next step is for the editors to put our recommendations into the document. 
HTML Working Group members can challenge this on the basis of what they read in our report, and other can challenge them once they go public in the Proposed Recommendation. 
But the HTML WG policy is that what we said goes in unless someone takes the initiative and can prove that there is a good reason not to. 
The requirement of record that the editors are working from states that we recommend that HTML user agents are _not_ limited to the list of base types published in the HTML spec. 
Almost. Replace "exactly" with "in its base type, extracted as per the algorithm in the spec," and you are OK. 
It is probably better that the user agent ignore the unknown parameters, not the stylesheet, if it is for a known base type. 
This is more in line with Internet and HTML tradition. 
I believe that is the way what is headed for the editors' output would work. 
We get a cut at clarifying this in the Browser Guidelines.

Following yesterday's HTML WG meeting in which Judy, Al Gilman and I presented the WAI proposals for HTML 4.0 I have drafted the following text for the media attribute: 
This bit is new: tty: intended for media using a fixed pitch character grid, such as teletypes, terminals, or portable devices with limited display capabilities. 
This bit has a one word change: 3. A case-sensitive match is then made with the set of media types defined above. 
Entries that don't match may be ignored. 
Note the change from "should" to "may" in the last sentence.

[snip] Thanks, Dave. 
HC team: So far as I can see, this document chage meets the requirements on which we had reached a rough consensus by the 22nd. 
If you want to clarify the "Oct 22 consensus" please post to w3c-wai-hc until Daniel and I are convinced that the consensus needs to be clarified. 
If we want to improve on what we had figured out by the 22nd, we have to elevate the issue to Judy. 
This is so the HTML editors can get on with their job, which is non-small.

This is indeed what I had in mind, since the user agent can not in such a case determine whether the output medium satisfies the requirements of the style sheet. 
The problem can be exemplified as follows: media="braille displayed 80" (a style sheet for an 80-cell braille display). 
Suppose that the user agent does not recognise the parameters, and truncates the media type to: media="braille" and the output device is a braille embosser with a maximum of 40 characters per line. 
The style sheet includes properties that require text to be positioned horizontally in columns 41-80. 
Another solution, which might perhaps be better, would be to access the style sheet, ignore the extra media type parameters, and then activate error checking to ensure that none of the style properties results in output that would exceed the capabilities of the hardware. 
I do not recall reading any discussion of such error checking in the CSS specification, but I may have overlooked it. 
I understood our position to be that media types, including additional base types and extensions to existing types, should be able to evolve without requiring changes to the HTML specification. 
With this objective in mind, the October 17 draft of HTML 4.0 is still problematic. 
Quoting the relevant passage: Future versions of HTML may introduce new values and may allow parameterized values. 
[This development should not be dependent on future versions of HTML. 
The entire purpose of our proposal, as I understand it, is to make the definition of media types independent of the HTML specification.] 
To facilitate the introduction of these extensions, user agents conforming to this specification must be able to parse the media attribute value as follows: 1. Comma characters (Unicode decimal 44) are used to break the media attribute value into a list of entries, e.g.: media="screen, 3d-glasses, print and resolution  90dpi" is mapped to: "screen" "3d-glasses" "print and resolution  90dpi" 2. Each entry is truncated just before the first character that isn't a US ASCII letter [a-zA-Z] (Unicode decimal 65-90, 97-122), numeric digit [0-9] (Unicode hex 30-39), or hyphen (45). 
[Here is the problem. 
It is only a minimally conforming user agent which should truncate each entry in this way, and restrict itself to the predefined list of media types. 
It should be possible for user agents to process and act on the additional parameters without violating the HTML specification.] 
In the example, this gives: "screen" "3d-glasses" "print" 3. A case-sensitive match is then made with the set of media types defined above. 
Entries that don't match should [changed to "may", pursuent to Dave's amendment] be ignored. 
In the example we are left with screen and print. 
When Al and I were discussing this issue a few weeks ago, we raised the possibility that media types would be defined by the currently active style language (E.G. CSS). 
Thus, any media type containing parameters or an unrecognised base type, would in effect be sent to the style sheet handler for processing. 
This approach seems flawed, in that some style languages may not support the notion of a media type. 
Perhaps it would be better for media types to be developed in a separate specification, as Daniel has been suggesting. 
In that case, we need to make it clear that the truncation is not mandatory but only required of a minimally conforming user agent, and that additional parameters (following the base type name ans preceding the comma) may be recognised, as well as new base types. 
The statement that future versions of HTML may define extensions to media types also needs to be changed, since it is our intention that the definition of media types should not be a function of the HTML specification. 
I am sure that we can arrive at a mutually satisfying approach to this issue.
