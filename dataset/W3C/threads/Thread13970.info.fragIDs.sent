Could we add a section in the central document on Temporarily able bodied. 
Marja-Riitta Koivunen wrote to the UA list and I agree we need a section on: 
The link (in UA guidelines) behind "one or more users" is good. 
However shouldn't we include also TABs (temporary di-sappled) to this list and explain how these features benefit also people in noisy environments, environ-ments were noise is not tolerated (library, cubicles area, when children are asleep etc.), people with wi-reless devices, people whose 
hands are tied or concentration is low (e.g. driving a car) etc. etc. 
This would emphasize the benefits to almost everyone in some environment.

something like this? 
Temporarily Able-Bodied (TAB) The term Temporarily Able-Bodied (TAB) indicates that many people will become disabled, either temporarily or permanently, at some point in their lives. 
A disability can be the result of injury, illness, age, or circumstance. 
Instances of temporary disabilities (not caused by injury or illness) include: working in a noisy environment, working in environments where noise is not tolerated (e.g., libraries, work cubicles, and at home when children are sleeping), and instances when hands and eyes are busy (e.g., driving a car).

I was thinking about people who break their arm and can only typing or point with one hand for a while. 
Basically people who due to injury or illness temporarily lose some capability, but may regain capability in the future. 
Your descriptions are also valid. 
I think what you wrote is pretty goos, maybe just add an example of a broken arm. 
Thanks, Jon

I am not sure we want to use the exact term "tab" in the doc. 
Although the concept is correct, I see it as a pejoritive term used by us when talking among ourselves.

I strongly agree with David. 
The derivation &amp; common usage of "TAB" is generally regarded as pejorative and would be out of place in this guidelines document. 
The concept can much more affirmatively be expressed here by discussing the concept of "Universal Design" -- design for the full range of functional variation, be it disability-related or situational, also ensuring compatibility with existing assistive technologies.

I agree with Judy. 
In the first place, I have never heard of TABs, and I suspect that a high proportion of the world's literate population would be in the same situation. 
Secondly, the guidelines would be better without yet another, potentially confusing acronym. 
Finally, the concept of "universal design", which can be easily explained, seems to encompass all of the general principles and policy considerations which motivate this group's work. 
I'm sorry if I used a wrong word (TAB) in my suggestion. 
I misunderstood it. 
The idea really was to talk in the document how many of the things that help disabled are also in many times beneficial to everybody in different usage environments. 
The goal was to give as much motivation to designers as possible to use these guidelines. 
So talking about universal design and explaining it in this way is just fine. 
Marja I agree with Judy.

I don't think we need to use the term, but just expand the list of people who benefit from using the guidelines. 
I don't think jaron like TABs is useful when being read by people unfamilar with the discipline.
