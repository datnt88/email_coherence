Sorry Chaals, are you saying the rdfs:labels should be like 'in facet' rather than 'in-facet'? 
I think this is a good suggestion. 
What does everyone else reckon? 
Al. P.s. 
I'm totally open to comments about what the labels for the elements of the SKOS-Core schema should be.

Comment - since rdfs:label is a human readable label rather than for machines, it seems better to me if you just put spaces between words. 
If you want to auto-generate property names from labels you can do so by globbing them together (or camel-casing them, or whatever) but as far as the machine is concerned you could also do so by selecting random combinations of arabic and chinese characters that don't already appear in your schema. 
This would probably encourage people to build interfaces that look for human-readable text to present things, so may be beneficial (although I suspect there are still enough hand-coders out there that there is some value in legible tag names). 
The question (because I don't know the answer) is "how would you express the disjoint condition in RDF?" cheers Chaals 
Hi Doug, all, Should have mentioned, I tentatively decided to drop the 
skos:Facet class 
and the skos:inFacet and skos:facetMember properties in 
SKOS-Core 1.0 after 
there was some contention as to whether this had been 
modelled in the right 
way. 
But Doug if you think the way it was done was OK for now, 
then I'm happy to 
re-include it. 
[snip] 
The statements above are based on the principal that facets 
are disjoint 
classes (although the disjoint condition is sometimes broken 
and therefore 
is not expressed as a formal constraint), and facet members are class instances. 
Al. 
Yep. 
uncryptic enough so they are easy to translate. 
I am looking to get Sidar's glossary of terms for translation to use them, and it will help a lot of we can provide the schema with labelling in spanish... Cheers Chaals

Works for me. 
I always wanted rdfs:label and rdfs:comment to allow hypertext, some xhtml subset, but they don't.
