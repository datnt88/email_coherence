<s> This is a good idea; the input might be quite valuable.  </s>
<s> Since the issue was never closed, it therefore remains open.  </s>
<s> How long do you think it will take to pursue your inquiries?  </s>
<s> After that, we can bring the issue to a meeting and either resolve it, or establish any further action items that might be needed.  </s>
<s> Members of the W3C's internationalization working group may also wish to contribute at some point (as Wendy noted at one of our meetings, they have an interest in various aspects of the guidelines, with this issue being one of them).  </s>
<s> The absolute requirement is that all issues be resolved before we proceed to last call.  </s>
<s> However, it would also be desirable to obtain some implementation experience before then.  </s>
<s> Thus if you have a preliminary indication of how long these valuable inquiries will take, we can schedule further treatment of the issue at an appropriate meeting thereafter.  </s>
<s> My suggestion would be that you post your findings to the list once the inquiries are concluded, and that the issue should then be placed on a meeting agenda.  </s>

<s> The Accessibility Competence Center team at SAP has reviewed the draft and we provide our comments below.  </s>
<s> We have both general comments, which appear above the guidelines, and specific comments, which we've entered directly in the body of the guidelines document.  </s>
<s> Our comments appear in red and are preceded and followed by three asterisks (***).  </s>
<s> Regarding the overall questions that were posed: 1.  </s>
<s> In general, is this WCAG 2.0 Working Draft easy to understand?  </s>
<s> Please identify sections or phrases that are difficult to understand.  </s>
<s> Please suggest alternative wording for us to consider.  </s>
<s> Overall, the structure of the draft is easy to understand.  </s>
<s> Wherever we had difficulty with certain sections or phrases, we have indicated that directly in the document.  </s>
<s> 2. The priority structure of this WCAG 2.0 Working Draft differs from WCAG 1.0.  </s>
<s> Is this structure easy to understand?  </s>
<s> Would it be effective?  </s>
<s> We have made some comments about the priority structure in the Conformance section of the document.  </s>
<s> In general, however, we do feel that this priority structure is not difficult to understand.  </s>
<s> 3. If your site already uses WCAG 1.0, do you think it would be difficult to migrate from WCAG 1.0 to WCAG 2.0?  </s>
<s> What would make it easier?  </s>
<s> Please note that supporting documents, such as technology-specific techniques documents, are not yet available.  </s>
<s> We look forward to your comments specific to Web applications, as we discussed at CSUN this year.  </s>
<s> SAP Web applications already target WCAG 1.0, Priority 1 guidelines.  </s>
<s> We have been considering targeting conformance with WCAG 1.0, Priority 2 guidelines in the near future.  </s>
<s> In our assessment, it would not be a simple matter to migrate our Web applications from WCAG 1.0, Priority 1, to WCAG 2.0, Level 1.  </s>
<s> A document that maps WCAG 1.0 guidelines to their counterparts in WCAG 2.0 would be helpful, although we realize there will often not be a 1-to-1 mapping.  </s>
<s> Overall, we feel that the inclusion of so many more usability-oriented guidelines will make the task of conforming to WCAG 2.0, Level 1 more difficult than conforming to WCAG 1.0, Priority 1.  </s>
<s> However, we will have a better idea of the difficulty once we see the supporting documents, such as the technology-specific techniques documents.  </s>
<s> Our general comments follow, and the draft document with our specific comments appears below them.  </s>
<s> Please let us know if you have any questions regarding our comments.  </s>
<s> Regards, SAP Accessibility Competence Center ***General Comments: SAP reviewed this draft with an eye specifically towards our own products, which are Web-based applications (called "Web apps" below).  </s>
<s> In general, we feel that these guidelines have Web sites in mind and are not always applicable to our kind of Web-based software.  </s>
<s> For example, the Purpose section states that the document "outlines design principles for creating accessible Web sites."  </s>
<s> Other specific instances are noted in the comments below.  </s>
<s> It is important that Web applications be taken into consideration, because the WCAG guidelines are used in many countries and U.S. states as the basis for legal requirements for accessibility for both Web sites and Web apps.  </s>
<s> It was not entirely clear whether documents are covered by these guidelines, meaning file formats like Powerpoint files (.PPT), Word document files (.DOC), Adobe files (.PDF), etc.  </s>
<s> If not, they should be, since most Web sites and even Web apps often include documents in non-HTML formats.  </s>
<s> The multimedia definition does not cover animation.  </s>
<s> Is it considered not part of multimedia?  </s>
<s> For every Level 2 criteria about posting a statement: Where do you put all of the site-wide statements?  </s>
<s> And where do you put the page-specific statements?  </s>
<s> Won't these add a lot of noise?  </s>
<s> There appear to be many checkpoints that are focused on usability, not accessibility per se.  </s>
<s> It would be good if the guidelines included a definition of accessibility.  </s>
<s> In our opinion, if the user can get to it, find out what it is, and activate it, we consider it accessible.  </s>
<s> The primary focus should really be on whether the user can complete the task/function.  </s>
<s> How *easy* it is to use, or how quick it is to find or use it, in our opinion belongs in the realm of usability, not accessibility.  </s>
<s> For example, a Web application may be produced quickly and not be easily usable by anybody, disabled or non-disabled.  </s>
<s> Following these guidelines would force the company to make it easy to use.  </s>
<s> Should that really be the intention of these guidelines?  </s>
<s> We don't think so, particularly considering the fact that many U.S. states use the WCAG guidelines as the basis for their legal requirements, and this would in effect legislate usability.  </s>
<s> The WCAG checkpoints are geared towards a much broader user base than our Web apps are geared towards.  </s>
<s> We have to assume a certain level of cognitive ability for users to use our Web apps.  </s>
<s> And since they are our customers, not the general public, shouldn't that be allowed?  </s>
<s> Also, the checkpoints seem to be geared more towards learnability than accessibility or usability per se, but SAP expects our users to receive training and extensive documentation, which should cover much of the learnability aspects already.  </s>
<s> Finally, we sometimes have to sacrifice some learnability in our Web apps in order to make the screen faster to use for trained people, i.e. for productivity reasons.  </s>
<s> We really need checkpoints that are focused on accessibility, not usability or learnability.  </s>
<s> Are issues raised by page refresh covered in these guidelines?  </s>
<s> We couldn't find anything about that.  </s>
<s> Do these guidelines apply equally to mobile Web applications, like those that might run on a cell phone?***  </s>

<s> When these principles are ignored, individuals with disabilities may not be able to access the content at all, or they may be able to do so only with great difficulty.  </s>
<s> When these principles are employed, they also make Web content accessible to a variety of Web-enabled devices, such as phones, handheld devices, kiosks, network appliances, etc.  </s>
<s> By making content accessible to a variety of devices, that content will also be accessible to people in a variety of situations.  </s>
<s> The design principles in this document represent broad concepts that apply to all Web-based content.  </s>
<s> They are not specific to HTML, XML, or any other technology.  </s>
<s> This approach was taken so that the design principles could be applied to a variety of situations and technologies, including those that do not yet exist.  </s>
<s> How to read this document In order to facilitate understanding of the guidelines and to help people focus in on just the parts they need, the guidelines are presented as a set of interrelated documents.  </s>
<s> There are basically 3 layers to the guidelines information. 1 - Top layer - Overview of Design Principles, Guidelines, Checkpoints The top layer is titled "Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0".  </s>
<s> It is the document you are currently reading.  </s>
<s> This document provides: * An introduction * The 5 major Guidelines for accessibility (Perceivable, Operable, Navigable, Understandable and Robust).  </s>
<s> * The (non-technology-specific) checkpoints for each guideline (21 in total).  </s>
<s> * Success criteria (normative), and definitions, benefits and examples (all non-normative) for each checkpoint * An appendix containing definitions, references and other support information. 2 - Technology-specific Checklists In addition to the general guidelines, there will be a series of technology-specific checklist documents.  </s>
<s> These documents will provide information on what is required when using different technologies in order to meet the WCAG 2.0 Working Draft access guidelines.  </s>
<s> Reviewer's Note: These checklists do not yet exist.  </s>
<s> At the present time the checklists are expected to be non-normative, though no formal decision has been made.  </s>
<s> 3 - Bottom layer - Technology-specific application information The Techniques Documents will include code examples, screen shots, and other information specific to a technology.  </s>
<s> These documents will be non-normative.  </s>
<s> They will contain different strategies for meeting the requirements as well as the current preferred approaches where they exist.  </s>
<s> Examples include: * Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) and Extensible Hypertext Markup Language (XHTML(tm)) Techniques * Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) Techniques * Server-side scripting Techniques * Client-side scripting Techniques * Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) Techniques * Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language (SMIL) Techniques * Extensible Markup Language (XML) Techniques (These will become active links as the corresponding working drafts are published) Audience These guidelines have been written to meet the needs of many different audiences from policy makers, to managers, to those who create Web content, to those who code the pages.  </s>
<s> Every attempt has been made to make the document as readable and usable as possible while still retaining the accuracy and clarity needed in a technical specification.  </s>
<s> For first time users, the work of the http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/ Education and Outreach Working Group of the Web Accessibility Initiative is highly recommended.  </s>
<s> Scope The guidelines cover a wide range of issues and recommendations for making Web content more accessible.  </s>
<s> They include recommendations to make pages accessible and usable by people with a full range of disabilities.  </s>
<s> In general, the guidelines do not include standard usability recommendations except where they have specific ramifications for accessibility beyond standard usability impacts.  </s>
<s> Priorities and Techniques This WCAG 2.0 Working Draft does not assign priorities to checkpoints, as did WCAG 1.0.  </s>
<s> Instead, each of the checkpoints has levels of implementation listed for it.  </s>
<s> There are 3 levels labeled "Minimum", "Level 2", and "Level 3".  </s>
<s> The main WCAG 2.0 Working Draft document does not include technology-specific implementation requirements or techniques, but it does include links to technology-specific requirements as well as technology-specific examples and techniques.  </s>
<s> This Working Draft of WCAG 2.0 is a follow-on and evolution of WCAG 1.0 and reflects feedback received since the publication of WCAG 1.0 in May 1999.  </s>
<s> Although the same approaches to accessibility are followed in 1.0 and 2.0, the organization and structure have been improved significantly.  </s>
<s> The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines Working Group is working carefully to enable organizations and individuals that are currently using WCAG 1.0 (which remains stable and referenceable at this time) to ensure that they will eventually be able to make a smooth transition to WCAG 2.0.  </s>
<s> To understand how this eventual transition would be facilitated, please refer to the (draft) http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20/2002/08/20-mapping.html  </s>
<s> Checkpoint Mapping Between WCAG 1.0 and the WCAG 2.0 Working Draft for more detail on current correspondences.  </s>
<s> Conformance In order to claim any conformance to the guidelines it is necessary to satisfy the "MINIMUM" success criteria of every checkpoint.  </s>
<s> The minimum criteria represent those aspects of the checkpoint requirements which, in the absence of a full implementation, will nonetheless offer substantial benefit to people with disabilities by removing barriers that would otherwise make it difficult or impossible to access the content.  </s>
<s> The Level 2 and Level 3 criteria build upon this functionality, making the content accessible to people who would not be able to access it, or could do so only with substantial difficulty, if only the minimum criteria had been met.  </s>
<s> Sites which go beyond the Minimum level of conformance can claim conformance at higher levels in several ways.  </s>
<s> * If they meet all of the criteria for Level 2 or Level 3 ***in addition to Level 1*** they can claim conformance at those levels.  </s>
<s> * If they meet some but not all of the criteria for Level 2 ***in addition to Level 1*** then can claim conformance at Level 1+. * If they meet all of the criteria for level 2 and some but not all of the criteria for Level 32 ***in addition to Level 1*** then can claim conformance at Level 2+. * It is possible and recommended that sites report specifically which criteria they have met within each of the guidelines and checkpoints.  </s>
<s> This can be done using [Reviewer's Note: method not yet defined].  </s>
<s> ***Like a VPAT or a checklist of some sort?  </s>
<s> This is a key issue for us, since it's not easy to figure out where or how to report this information in a Web app.*** ***How do you ensure that you've satisfied a criterion?  </s>
<s> Are you supposed to guarantee that every page conforms?  </s>
<s> What is the method of testing/coverage required?  </s>
<s> Also, if you do Level 3 for a checkpoint, but you don't do Levels 1 or 2, could you claim that you're compliant with Level 3?*** Overview of Design Principles The overall goal is to create Web content that is perceivable, operable, navigable, and understandable by the broadest possible range of users and compatible with their wide range of assistive technologies, now and in the future.  </s>
<s> * Perceivable.  </s>
<s> Ensure that all content can be presented in form(s) that can be perceived by any user - except those aspects of the content that cannot be expressed in words.  </s>
<s> * Operable.  </s>
<s> Ensure that the interface elements in the content are operable by any user.  </s>
<s> * Navigable.  </s>
<s> Facilitate content orientation and navigation * Understandable.  </s>
<s> Make it as easy as possible to understand the content and controls.  </s>
<s> * ***We feel this is more of a usability issue, not an accessibility issue.  </s>
<s> In fact, the guidelines in this section seem to require that pages be intuitive.  </s>
<s> That would be a difficult requirement for some Web apps to meet, since they can be complex due to the nature of the task being performed.  </s>
<s> And it brings up the question of where training fits in.  </s>
<s> Users generally need training before they can use Web apps, and that training provides much of the understanding.  </s>
<s> Finally, how do you measure understandability?  </s>
<s> This could be a very subjective thing.***  </s>
<s> * Robust.  </s>
<s> Use Web technologies that maximize the ability of the content to work with current and future accessibility technologies and user agents.  </s>
<s> * ***It's not easy for a Web app to conform with everything on the market.  </s>
<s> There are currently no standards between screen readers, for example.  </s>
<s> Even Internet Explorer doesn't support certain standard HTML controls (such as the long description tag).  </s>
<s> How do we take these issues into account?  </s>
<s> Are there minimum requirements to work with specific assistive technologies?  </s>
<s> For example, would JAWS have a list of things we need to do to be compatible with them?  </s>
<s> We need to know what to do/what not to do.  </s>
<s> Wouldn't it be enough to ensure that we provide one method of access for each disability, as Section 508 specifies?  </s>
<s> * One reason SAP doesn't support all browsers is because some browsers don't meet our requirements in terms of things like performance, etc.  </s>
<s> We implement our apps in a controlled, corporate environment, not in a public environment.  </s>
<s> We are able to tell our customers that they need to use XYZ browser with SAP Web apps; it's a marketing decision whether we will target other browsers as well.  </s>
<s> So a guideline that mandates that we support other browsers does not make sense for us.*** Accessible Web content benefits a variety of people, not just people with disabilities.  </s>
<s> In the physical world, ramps are used by bicycles, people pushing strollers, and people in wheelchairs.  </s>
<s> Similarly, accessible Web content is usable by a variety of people with and without disabilities.  </s>
<s> For example, people who are temporarily operating under constrained conditions like operating in a noisy environment or driving their car where their eyes are busy.  </s>
<s> Likewise, a search engine can find a famous quote in a movie if the movie is captioned.  </s>
<s> Note: These principles apply only to Web content presented to a human reader.  </s>
<s> A structured database or metadata collection where the data is intended for use by another machine and thus requires no interface lies outside the scope of these guidelines.  </s>
<s> User needs Here are a few scenarios, by no means an exhaustive list of the variations and types of disabilities and needs: * Someone who cannot hear will want to see the information normally presented via sound.  </s>
<s> * Someone who cannot see will want to hear or read through braille information that is usually presented visually.  </s>
<s> * Someone who does not have the strength to move quickly or easily will want to use as little movement as possible and have as much time as they need when operating Web interfaces.  </s>
<s> * Someone who does not read well may want to hear the information read aloud.  </s>
<s> If Web content employs the design principles described in this document, then users should be able to access the content using adaptive strategies and assistive technologies.  </s>
<s> A screen reader is an example of an assistive technology that reads the page aloud.  </s>
<s> There are many other tools people with disabilities employ to make use of Web content.  </s>

<s> Designing Accessible Web Content These guidelines provide the basic requirements for designing accessible Web content.  </s>
<s> This document is not designed to provide the background needed to learn about accessible Web design in a thorough or effective manner for those interested in learning.  </s>
<s> Readers are therefore referred to the http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/ Education and Outreach Working Group of the http://www.w3.org/WAI/ Web Accessibility Initiative.  </s>
<s> Guideline 1 - Perceivable.  </s>
<s> Ensure that all intended function and information can be presented in form(s) that can be perceived by any user - except those aspects that cannot be expressed in words.  </s>
<s> Essential to any access to Web content is the ability of the user to have the information presented in a form which they can perceive.  </s>
<s> The checkpoints under this guideline impact individuals with sensory disabilities by allowing the information to be transformed and presented in a form which they can perceive.  </s>
<s> They also impact individuals with cognitive and language disabilities by ensuring that the information is in a format that can be perceived by mainstream and assistive technologies which can read the content to them as well as (increasingly over time) transform and present it in a form which is easier for them to understand.  </s>
<s> Checkpoint 1.1 For all non-text content that can be expressed in words, provide a text equivalent of the function or information the non-text content was intended to convey.  </s>
<s> Success Criteria You will have successfully met Checkpoint 1.1 at the Minimum Level if: * non-text content that can be expressed in words has a text-equivalent explicitly associated with it.  </s>
<s> * non-text content that can not be expressed in words has a descriptive label provided as its text-equivalent.  </s>
<s> * The text equivalent should fulfill the same function as the author intended for the non-text content (i.e. it presents all of the intended information and/or achieves the same function of the non-text content).  </s>
<s> * ***How would this be done for screen shots in online help documentation?  </s>
<s> It does not seem easy to implement.  </s>
<s> It would require a description of the screen layout.  </s>
<s> Where do you draw the line with the description?  </s>
<s> How do you know when it "fulfills the same function"?  </s>
<s> And who judges what "the author intended"?  </s>
<s> Is the company the author?***  </s>
<s> You will have successfully met Checkpoint 1.1 at Level 2 if: * the site has a statement asserting that the text-equivalent has been reviewed and is believed to fulfill the same function as the author intended for the non-text content (i.e. it presents all of the intended information and/or achieves the same function of the non-text content).  </s>
<s> ***Meeting this criterion would require extensive effort.  </s>
<s> Text equivalents are entered by developers and by documentation people, and they are typically not reviewed after they are entered.  </s>
<s> Meeting this criterion would require automated plus manual checking of every text equivalent, which would be very resource-consuming.  </s>
<s> Is there a tolerance level here, or would everything have to be checked?***  </s>
<s> You will have successfully met Checkpoint 1.1 at Level 3 if: * (presently no additional criteria for this level.)  </s>
<s> The following are additional ideas for enhancing a site along this particular dimension: * (presently no additional criteria for this level.) Definitions (informative) A text equivalent * serves the same function as the non-text content was intended to serve.  </s>
<s> * communicates the same information as the non-text content was intended to convey.  </s>
<s> * may contain structured content or metadata.  </s>
<s> Note: Text-equivalents should be easily convertible to braille or speech, displayed in a larger font or different colors, fed to language translators or abstracting software, etc. Non-text content includes but is not limited to images, text in raster images, image map regions, animations (e.g., animated GIFs), applets and programmatic objects, ASCII art, scripts that present content, images used as list bullets, spacers, graphical buttons, sounds (played with or without user interaction), stand-alone audio files, audio tracks of video, and video.  </s>
<s> ***What about meaningless graphics that are only on a page for visual appeal?  </s>
<s> Shouldn't these somehow be marked so they won't be picked up by the AT (in HTML, with an empty ALT tag, for example)?  </s>
<s> Otherwise, they represent noise for the blind user.  </s>
<s> Also, screen readers like JAWS skip spacers that have no ALT tag, so why should we have to give them descriptive labels?  </s>
<s> *** Benefits (informative) * Individuals who are blind, have low vision, have cognitive disabilities or have trouble reading text for any reason can have the text read aloud to them.  </s>
<s> * Individuals who are deaf, are hard of hearing or who are having trouble understanding the audio information for any reason can read the text presentation or have it translated and presented as sign language.  </s>
<s> * Individuals who are blind or deaf-blind can have the information presented in braille.  </s>
<s> Examples (informative) * Example 1: providing a short label for a button/link.  </s>
<s> * A right arrow icon is used to link to the next slide in a slide show.  </s>
<s> The text equivalent is "Next Slide," so that what is read by a screen reader would be "link: Next Slide."  </s>
<s> * Example 2: providing a short label and a longer explanation of a data chart.  </s>
<s> * A bar chart compares how many shoes were sold in June, July, and August.  </s>
<s> The short label says, "Graph of the numbers of shoes sold in June, July, and August."  </s>
<s> The longer explanation provides the data presented in the chart.  </s>
<s> * Example 3: providing a short label and a longer explanation of an animation.  </s>
<s> * An animation shows how to tie a knot.  </s>
<s> The short label says, "An animation showing how to tie a square knot."  </s>
<s> The longer explanation describes the hand movements needed to tie the knot.  </s>
<s> * ***It would be better if there were a real example of the hand movements here.  </s>
<s> Telling how to do it and actually showing how to do it are very different!  </s>
<s> Give us a real example.***  </s>
<s> * Example 4: providing a short label and a transcript for an audio file that can be described in words.  </s>
<s> * An audio file is embedded in a Web page.  </s>
<s> The short label says, "Chairman's speech to the assembly."  </s>
<s> A link to a text transcript is provided immediately after the clip.  </s>
<s> * Example 5: providing a label for content that cannot be described in words.  </s>
<s> * An audio file is embedded in a Web page.  </s>
<s> The short label says, "Beethoven's 5th Symphony performed by the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra."  </s>
<s> Checkpoint 1.2 Provide synchronized media equivalents for time-dependent presentations.  </s>
<s> Success criteria You will have successfully met Checkpoint 1.2 at the Minimum Level if: * an audio description is provided of all visual information in scenes, actions and events (that can't be perceived from the sound track).  </s>
<s> * The audio description should include all significant visual information in scenes, actions and events (that can't be perceived from the sound track) to the extent possible given the constraints posed by the existing audio track (and constraints on freezing the audio/visual program to insert additional auditory description).  </s>
<s> * ***Is this point talking about replacing the existing soundtrack with an alternate audio, or having an alternate audio available in addition to the existing soundtrack?*** * all significant dialogue and sounds are captioned * exception: if the Web content is real-time audio-only, if not time-sensitive (news, emergency, etc.), and not interactive, a transcript or other non-audio equivalent is sufficient.  </s>
<s> * ***Why is captioning considered the minimum?  </s>
<s> For non-real-time, wouldn't transcripts be OK? At least in cases where the video is not conveying majorly important information, for example if it's a video of an executive speaking at a conference.***  </s>
<s> * descriptions and captions are synchronized with the events they represent.  </s>
<s> * if the Web content is real-time video with audio, real-time captions are provided unless the content: * is a music program that is primarily non-vocal * if the Web content is real-time non-interactive video (e.g. a Webcam of ambient conditions), an accessible alternative is provided that achieves the purpose of the video.  </s>
<s> If the author's purpose is to provide real-time information, a media equivalent is provided that conforms to checkpoint 1.1, or a link is provided to content elsewhere which conforms to checkpoint 1.1 (e.g. a link to a weather Web site).  </s>
<s> * if a pure audio or pure video presentation requires a user to respond interactively at specific times in the presentation, then a time-synchronized equivalent (audio, visual or text) presentation is provided.  </s>
<s> exception: if content is rebroadcast from another medium or resource that complies to broadcast requirements for accessibility (independent of these guidelines), the rebroadcast satisfies the checkpoint if it complies with the other guidelines.  </s>
<s> You will have successfully met Checkpoint 1.2 at Level 2 if: * the site has a statement asserting that the audio description has been reviewed and it is believed to include all significant visual information in scenes, actions and events (that can't be perceived from the sound track) is provided to the extent possible given the constraints posed by the existing audio track (and constraints on freezing the audio/visual program to insert additional auditory description).  </s>
<s> * ***Who is supposed to review this?  </s>
<s> The person who produced the site?  </s>
<s> Some sort of review committee?  </s>
<s> * Where do you put the statement?  </s>
<s> Is there supposed to be a single statement page, or does every page with media have to have a separate statement?  </s>
<s> Won't that add a lot of noise?*** * captions and Audio descriptions are provided for all live broadcasts that are professionally produced.  </s>
<s> * ***Please define "professionally produced".  </s>
<s> What is the importance of that?  </s>
<s> Wouldn't it make more sense for the professionally produced things to have captions at a minimum?***  </s>
<s> * if Web content is an interactive audio-only presentation, the user is provided with the ability to view only the captions, the captions with the audio, or both together.  </s>
<s> * ***Doesn't "the captions with the audio" mean the same thing as "both together"?***  </s>
<s> You will have successfully met Checkpoint 1.2 at Level 3 if: * a text document (a "script") that includes all audio and visual information is provided.  </s>
<s> * ***How is this different from a transcript?  </s>
<s> This would be much easier to meet than the current minimum criteria.***  </s>
<s> * captions and Audio descriptions are provided for all live broadcasts which provide the same information.  </s>
<s> The following are additional ideas for enhancing a site along this particular dimension: * (presently no additional criteria for this level.) Definitions (informative) A time-dependent presentation is a presentation which * is composed of synchronized audio and visual tracks (e.g., a movie), OR * requires the user to respond interactively at specific times in the presentation.  </s>
<s> Media equivalents present essential audio information visually (captions) and essential video information auditorily (audio descriptions).  </s>
<s> * captions are text equivalents of auditory information from speech, sound effects, and ambient sounds that are synchronized with the multimedia presentation.  </s>
<s> * audio descriptions are equivalents of visual information from actions, body language, graphics, and scene changes that are voiced (either by a human or a speech synthesizer) and synchronized with the multimedia presentation.  </s>
<s> Benefits (informative) * People who are deaf or have a hearing loss can access the auditory information through the captions.  </s>
<s> * People who are blind or have low vision as well as those with cognitive disabilities who have difficulty interpreting visually what is happening benefit from the audio descriptions of the visual information.  </s>
<s> People without disabilities also benefit from the media equivalents.  </s>
<s> * People in noisy environments or with muted sound often use captions.  </s>
<s> * Captions are used by many to develop language and reading skills.  </s>
<s> * Audio descriptions also provide visual information for people who are temporarily looking away from the video presentation such as when following an instructional video and looking at their hands.  </s>
<s> * Captions and text descriptions can also be used to index and search media files.  </s>
<s> Note: Time-dependent presentations that require dual, simultaneous attention with a single sense can present significant barriers to some users.  </s>
<s> Depending on the nature of the of presentation, it may be possible to avoid scenarios where, for example, a deaf user would be required to watch an action on the screen and read the captions at the same time.  </s>
<s> However, this would not be achievable for live broadcasts (e.g. a football game).  </s>
<s> Where possible, provide content so that it does not require dual, simultaneous attention or so that it gives the user the ability to effectively control/pause different media signals.  </s>
<s> Examples (informative) * Example 1: a movie clip with audio description and captions.  </s>
<s> * A clip from a movie is published on a Web site.  </s>
<s> In the clip, a child is trying to lure a puppy to the child's bedroom by laying a trail of crumbs.  </s>
<s> The child mumbles inaudibly to himself as he lays the trail.  </s>
<s> When not watching the video, it is not obvious that he is laying a trail of crumbs since all you hear is the mumbling.  </s>
<s> The audio description that is interspersed with the child's mumbling says "Charlie lays a crumb on each stair leading to his room."  </s>
<s> The caption that appears as he mumbles is, "[inaudible mumbling]."  </s>
<s> * Example 2: a video clip of a news story.  </s>
<s> * A video clip accompanies a news story about the recent flooding in a major city.  </s>
<s> The reporter describes what is seen, for everyone.  </s>
<s> No audio description is necessary.  </s>
<s> The captions display what the reporter is saying.  </s>
<s> * Example 3: a silent animation.  </s>
<s> * An animation shows a pantomime climbing a ladder.  </s>
<s> There is no audio track for this animation.  </s>
<s> No captions or audio description are required.  </s>
<s> Instead, a text equivalent is provided as described in checkpoint 1.1.  </s>
<s> Checkpoint 1.3 Make all content and structure available independently of presentation.  </s>
<s> ***Are groupings considered structure?  </s>
<s> For example, in SAP Web apps, there are screen elements called group boxes.  </s>
<s> A group box is a grouping of other elements (such as checkboxes, input fields, etc.) on the screen in a box with a title.  </s>
<s> Would these be considered structure or presentation?***  </s>
<s> Success criteria You will have successfully met Checkpoint 1.3 at the Minimum Level if: * any information that is conveyed through presentation formatting is also provided in either text or structure.  </s>
<s> * ***What does it mean to convey presentation through structure?  </s>
<s> Does it mean, for example: Use tags for the presentation formatting instead of using hard-coded formatting?  </s>
<s> Does all layout information have to be described textually?***  </s>
<s> * the following can be derived programmatically (i.e. through assistive technology compatible markup or data model) from the content without interpreting presentation.  </s>
<s> * any hierarchical elements and relationships, such as headings, paragraphs and lists * any non-hierarchical relationships between elements such as cross-references and linkages, associations between labels and controls, associations between cells and their headers, etc. * any emphasis * ***"through assistive technology compatible markup": Which assistive technology specifically?  </s>
<s> All of them?  </s>
<s> Only some of them?  </s>
<s> They all do things differently, so compatibility is an issue.  </s>
<s> How would you check that you meet this criterion?***  </s>
<s> You will have successfully met Checkpoint 1.3 at Level 2 if: * (presently no additional criteria for this level.)  </s>
<s> You will have successfully met Checkpoint 1.3 at Level 3 if: * (presently no additional criteria for this level.)  </s>
<s> The following are additional ideas for enhancing a site along this particular dimension: * (presently no additional criteria for this level.) Definitions (informative) Content is the information or meaning and function.  </s>
<s> Presentation is the rendering of the content and structure in a form that can be sensed by the user.  </s>
<s> Structure includes both hierarchical structure of the content and non-hierarchical relationships such as cross-references, or the correspondence between header and data cells in a table.  </s>
<s> Benefits (informative) * Separating content and structure from presentation allows Web pages to be presented differently to meet the needs and constraints of different users without losing any of the information or structure.  </s>
<s> For example, information can be presented via speech or braille (text) that was originally intended to be presented visually.  </s>
<s> Examples (informative) * Example 1: a multi-column document.  </s>
<s> * A document is marked up with headings, paragraphs and other structural features.  </s>
<s> It is presented visually in three columns.  </s>
<s> The markup that creates the columns is separate from the markup that specifies the logical structure of the document.  </s>
<s> * Example 2: a scrolling list of stock prices.  </s>
<s> * Current stock quotes are scrolled horizontally across the screen.  </s>
<s> The data are separate from the methods used to scroll the text across the page.  </s>
<s> * Example 3: a 3-dimensional site map.  </s>
<s> * A custom user interface renders 3D visualizations of the pages on a site and how they relate to one another from a data source.  </s>
<s> Any hierarchical relationships, groupings, cross-references, etc. would originate in the data source so that alternate interfaces could be rendered (from the same source) that expose the structure of the site in an accessible form.  </s>
<s> (See also checkpoint 5.4) * Example 4: a list that allows users to sort information on a page according to preference.  </s>
<s> * A script allows a user to rearrange a categorical listing of music files by date, artist, genre, or file size.  </s>
<s> The script updates both the structure and the presentation accordingly when generating alternate views.  </s>
<s> Checkpoint 1.4 Ensure that foreground content is easily differentiable from background for both auditory and visual presentations.  </s>
<s> Success criteria You will have successfully met Checkpoint 1.4 at the Minimum Level if: * no text content is presented over a background picture, color or pattern that seriously interferes with readability unless the background picture or pattern can be easily removed.  </s>
<s> * prepared audio presentations do not have background sounds that seriously interfere with foreground auditory content.  </s>
<s> * ***What does "prepared" mean?  </s>
<s> Not real-time?  </s>
<s> * How does/do personalization/user settings affect this?  </s>
<s> If you provide personalization, do you meet the requirement, or does the default setting in the Web app have to comply?***  </s>
<s> You will have successfully met Checkpoint 1.4 at Level 2 if: * the site has a statement asserting that pages that might provide a problem have been run through a simulator for major types of color blindness and are deemed to be still easily readable.  </s>
<s> * ***Which simulator, and how do we use it?  </s>
<s> We've used one before, and it did not recognize the SAP color palette.  </s>
<s> It would take a lot of work to pre-screen for potential "problem screens."  </s>
<s> This should be a Level 3 criterion unless sample testing is enough, because otherwise it is a very tall order for a Web app.***  </s>
<s> You will have successfully met Checkpoint 1.4 at Level 3 if: * there are no background pictures or patterns behind foreground content * background sounds are at least 20 db lower than foreground content.  </s>
<s> The following are additional ideas for enhancing a site along this particular dimension: * (presently no additional criteria for this level.) Benefits (informative) * Individuals with low vision can easily make out characters in the content even if they don't have the wide field of view used by fully sighted persons to separate text from background images.  </s>
<s> * Individuals with hearing impairments that limit their ability to hear all of the frequencies of speech can make out the words from the sounds they can hear because they are not mixed with residual sounds from the music.  </s>
<s> Examples (informative) * Example 1: a background image on a page.  </s>
<s> * A background image and text are arranged so that there is no image behind the text or the image is so faint that the difference between the darkest part of the image and the text (which is dark) meets the standard foreground/background contrast requirements.  </s>
<s> The image behind the text also does not contain lines that are about the same width as the characters so they do not interfere with character recognition.  </s>
<s> * Example 2: background music.  </s>
<s> * There are no sounds or background music playing behind the narration or they are ?? db down.  </s>
<s> Checkpoint 1.5 Provide information needed for unambiguous decoding of the characters and words in the content.  </s>
<s> Success criteria You will have successfully met Checkpoint 1.5 at the Minimum Level if: * text in the content is provided in Unicode or sufficient information is provided so that it will be automatically mapped back to Unicode.  </s>
<s> You will have successfully met Checkpoint 1.5 at Level 2 if: * passages or fragments of text occurring within the content that are written in a language other than the primary natural language of the content as a whole, are identified, including specification of the language of the passage or fragment.  </s>
<s> * abbreviations and acronyms are clearly identified where they occur.  </s>
<s> (See also checkpoint 4.3.) * ***What does "are clearly identified" mean?  </s>
<s> Do you mean: Use markup to identify that this is an abbreviation or acronym?*** * symbols such as diacritic marks that are found in standard usage of the natural language of the content and necessary for unambiguous interpretation of words are present or another standard mechanism for disambiguation is provided.  </s>
<s> You will have successfully met Checkpoint 1.5 at Level 3 if: * the primary natural language of the content is identified at the page level.  </s>
<s> * ***Does this mean to use the language tag in HTML, for example?***  </s>
<s> The following are additional ideas for enhancing a site along this particular dimension: * (presently no additional criteria for this level.) Note: This checkpoint addresses the need for authors to provide sufficient information so that text can be identified correctly by technologies used to render the text (e.g. voice synthesizers) so that the words can be accurately produced and perceived.  </s>
<s> This checkpoint does not deal with providing definitions or expanded text for words, abbreviations, foreign phrases etc.  </s>
<s> These are covered under checkpoint 4.3 since they deal with understanding of the content.  </s>
<s> Definitions (informative) ***Include a definition of Unicode.*** Natural languages are those used by humans to communicate, including spoken, written, and signed languages.  </s>
<s> Benefits (informative) * Phrases from various languages, acronyms and abbreviations are often interspersed in writing.  </s>
<s> When these phrases are identified, a speech synthesizer can voice text with the appropriate accent and pronunciation.  </s>
<s> When they are not identified, the speech synthesizer will use the default accent and pronunciation of the language on the rest of the page, which can make the phrase unintelligible.  </s>
<s> Identifying changes in language and marking abbreviations and acronyms as such will also allow a tool to ask for automatic translations of that content.  </s>
<s> When editing content, authoring tools can switch between appropriate spelling dictionaries.  </s>
<s> * Facilitating unambiguous decoding of characters and words in content is also helpful for individuals who are learning to read or learning a second language.  </s>
<s> Examples (informative) * Example 1: a French phrase in an English sentence.  </s>
<s> * In the following sentence, "And with a certain je ne sais quoi, she entered both the room, and his life, forever." the French phrase "je ne sais quoi" is marked as French.  </s>
<s> Depending on the markup language, English may either be marked as the language for the entire document except where specified, or marked at the paragraph level.  </s>

<s> Checkpoint 3.1 Provide structure within content.  </s>
<s> ***How does this checkpoint apply to screens in a Web app?  </s>
<s> Something analagous needs to be added for application structure.  </s>
<s> Would menus satisfy the structure checkpoint?  </s>
<s> Also, this checkpoint seems to be about usability, not accessibility.  </s>
<s> Imposing structure through these guidelines regulates usability.  </s>
<s> The point we feel is most valid here is Level 3, #1, which should be the minimum requirement.***  </s>

<s> Objective success criteria cannot therefore be formulated that would apply across media and documents.  </s>
<s> Advisory recommendations are, however, listed below to provide guidance in adding key structural elements into the content.  </s>
<s> See also the techniques documents for the different technologies.  </s>
<s> * break up text into logical paragraphs.  </s>
<s> * provide hierarchical sections and titles, particularly for longer documents * reveal important non-hierarchical relationships, such as cross-references, or the correspondence between header and data cells in a table, so that they are represented unambiguously in the markup or data model.  </s>
<s> * divide very large works into sections and or chapters with logical labels.  </s>
<s> * others?  </s>
<s> Definitions (informative) The structure of content represents changes in context.  </s>
<s> For example, * A book is divided into chapters, paragraphs, lists, etc. Chapter titles help the reader anticipate the meaning of the following paragraphs.  </s>
<s> Lists clearly indicate separate, yet related ideas.  </s>
<s> All of these divisions help the reader anticipate changes in context.  </s>
<s> * A bicycle is divided into wheels and a frame.  </s>
<s> Further, a wheel is divided into a tire and a rim.  </s>
<s> In an image of the bicycle, one group of circles and lines becomes "wheel" while another group becomes "frame."  </s>
<s> Benefits (informative) ***All of these benefits appear to be usability benefits, not accessibility benefits.***  </s>
<s> When the logical structure is provided in markup or a data model, * Users with physical disabilities can use structure to more easily jump between paragraphs, chapters, sections etc. * Users with cognitive disabilities can use structure (chapter titles, headers, etc.) to provide more context for the text that follows them.  </s>
<s> They also provide warning of a change in context and reorient the user to the new focus.  </s>
<s> * Users with blindness or low vision can jump from header to header to get an overview or to more quickly "skim" to the section they are interested in.  </s>
<s> * Readers with low vision can sometimes (depending on display technology) change how chapter titles and headers are displayed to make them more visible -and easier to use when skimming the document.  </s>
<s> * the content can be presented on a variety of devices because the device software can choose only those elements of the content that it is able to display and display them in the most effective way for that device.  </s>
<s> Examples (informative) * Example 1: a physics dissertation.  </s>
<s> * A dissertation contains well-defined sections such as "Abstract," "Table of Contents," "Chapter 1," etc.  </s>
<s> The pieces in each section (paragraphs, subheadings, quotes) are denoted with structural markup.  </s>
<s> * Example 2: a scalable image of a bicycle.  </s>
<s> * Lines and a circle (spokes and rim) are grouped into a "wheel."  </s>
<s> Lines in a triangle that attach to each wheel are grouped into a "frame."  </s>
<s> * ***This implies images are supposed to have structure too, like documents.  </s>
<s> Why would structure be mandatory here?  </s>
<s> If the author is not trying to provide information about the structure of the bike, but rather display the bike as a whole, how is that a problem?  </s>
<s> Also, it would be really helpful here to see a visual example of what the example would look like.*** * Example 3: user interface.  </s>
<s> * User interface controls are divided into organized groups.  </s>
<s> Checkpoint 3.2 Emphasize structure through presentation(s), positioning, and labels.  </s>
<s> ***How does this checkpoint apply to Web app screens?***  </s>
<s> Success criteria You will have successfully met Checkpoint 3.2 at the Minimum Level if: * the structural elements present have a different visual appearance or auditory characteristic than the other structural elements.  </s>

<s> * ***Would this replace the minimum criteria, or would it be in addition to the minimum?***  </s>
<s> * alternate presentation formats are available to vary the emphasis of the structure.  </s>
<s> The following are additional ideas for enhancing a site along this particular dimension: Note: Because the form and origin (including letters, art, historical documents, etc) of content varies so greatly, specific criteria for the type and amount of emphasis to be provided can not be standardized.  </s>
<s> Objective success criteria cannot therefore be formulated that would apply across media and documents.  </s>
<s> Advisory recommendations are however listed below to provide guidance in emphasizing the structure of content.  </s>
<s> See also the techniques documents for the different technologies.  </s>
<s> * for visual presentations, use font variations, styles, size and white space to emphasize structure.  </s>
<s> * use color and graphics to emphasize structure.  </s>
<s> * for auditory presentations, use different voice characteristics and/sounds for major headings, sections and other structural elements.  </s>
<s> * if content is targeted for a specific user group and the presentation of the structured content is not salient enough to meet the needs of your audience, use additional graphics, colors, sounds, and other aspects of presentation to emphasize the structure.  </s>
<s> * ***What does "not salient enough" mean?  </s>
<s> How do you measure that?*** * provide a table of contents or navigation map of the document.  </s>
<s> Note: Ensure that the structural and semantic distinctions are provided in the markup or data model.  </s>
<s> Refer to checkpoint 2.2.  </s>
<s> Benefits (informative) Presentation that emphasizes structure: * enables users with cognitive and visual disabilities to orient themselves within the content, * enables all users to move quickly through the content and notice major content divisions * enables all users, but particularly users with visual or cognitive disabilities to focus on important content, * enables all users, but particularly users with visual or cognitive disabilities to separate the different types of content.  </s>
<s> Examples (informative) * Example 1: documentation for a product.  </s>
<s> * Identifying chapters in the structure of a book is appropriate and accepted use of labeling the structure.  </s>
<s> Within the chapters, headings identify (label) changes in context and highlight ideas contained in the following text.  </s>
<s> Subtle differences between the appearance of the chapter title and the section headings helps the user understand the hierarchy and relationship between the title and headings.  </s>
<s> The only difference might be font size and margin indentation when presented visually, and spoken in a difference voice or preceded by a sound when presented auditorily.  </s>
<s> * Example 2: a data table.  </s>
<s> * Groups of rows or columns are labeled with headers.  </s>
<s> * Example 3: an audio file.  </s>
<s> * An audio file of a document uses a different, more formal voice to read titles and headers so the listener can easily identify the words as a title and not part of the running text.  </s>
<s> Checkpoint 3.3 Provide multiple methods to explore sites that are more than two layers deep.  </s>
<s> ***What are the layers in a Web application?  </s>
<s> What would constitute a layer in a Web-based wizard?  </s>
<s> Is a layer horizontal or vertical in the structure?  </s>
<s> This checkpoint does not seem to apply very well to Web apps.  </s>
<s> If there is a Submit button, for example, why should it be duplicated with a navigation link?  </s>
<s> What about Web sites where content is displayed dynamically based on the user's profile, etc.? A site map would be difficult to make.  </s>
<s> This seems to us to be a usability checkpoint, not accessibility.  </s>
<s> The benefits listed all point to usability.***  </s>
<s> Success criteria You will have successfully met Checkpoint 3.3 at the Minimum Level if: * sites that have more than two layers have at least one other method for exploration besides using the links on the home page.  </s>
<s> (A home page and one layer of pages linked off of it would be two layers) * a link to the alternate exploration method(s) is provided on the home page.  </s>
<s> You will have successfully met Checkpoint 3.3 at Level 2 if: * sites that have documents that span multiple files either provide the documents as a single file or provide a search function which would allow the user to search for a word across only the files that make up that document.  </s>
<s> You will have successfully met Checkpoint 3.3 at Level 3 if: * large documents (greater than 50,000 words) include multiple mechanisms for navigation such as a hyperlinked table of contents, internal hyperlinks, an ability to collapse by headers, etc.  </s>
<s> The following are additional ideas for enhancing a site along this particular dimension: * (presently no additional criteria for this level.) Definitions (informative) A site navigation mechanism is a mechanism for easily orienting and moving about within the site.  </s>
<s> Site navigation mechanisms include but are not limited to: * A Home page with hyperlinks on it and subsequent pages that link to the other pages at the site.  </s>
<s> * site map(s) * search engine(s) * expanding outline(s) * dynamic fisheye views showing all linked pages or topics related to any page.  </s>
<s> * 3-D virtual representations of site content Benefits (informative) * Providing different navigation mechanisms can provide a better match between different people's skills, background knowledge, visual vs. text orientation, and the type of information they are seeking at the moment.  </s>
<s> * Individuals with cognitive disabilities may find it easier to ask for what they want than to deduce its location from categorical choices.  </s>
<s> * Individuals with low vision or blindness may find search techniques that fetch everything that relates to a topic of interest to be easier than techniques that require them to scan lists or pages for the items.  </s>
<s> Checkpoint 3.4 Use consistent but not necessarily identical presentation.  </s>
<s> ***Again, a usability issue, not an accessibility issue.***  </s>

<s> * use templates for consistent presentation of sections or whole site * pages with similar function should have similar appearance and layout Definitions (informative) Presentation includes, but is not limited to: * position, * font, font size, * color * voice and voice characteristics * sounds * white space Benefits (informative) * Consistency helps users predict where to find information on each page of your site.  </s>
<s> It also helps users determine the relationships between items in the content.  </s>
<s> This understanding of the structure helps users navigate and orient themselves.  </s>
<s> * ***Usability benefit, not accessibility.  </s>
<s> Being able to find something is accessibility.  </s>
<s> Being able to predict where it can be found is usability.***  </s>
<s> * Differences in presentation help users determine that they have succeeded in loading a new page.  </s>
<s> Pages that are clearly different also makes it easier for users to tell where they are and to remember where information is located.  </s>
<s> * ***One could read this point to mean that every page should be different.  </s>
<s> Not sure that makes as much sense in a Web app, where a lot of the areas on the screen, like navigation, are consistent from screen to screen.***  </s>
<s> Checkpoint 3.5 Provide consistent and predictable responses to user actions.  </s>
<s> ***How far in advance does the warning need to come?  </s>
<s> Does telling the user during training about what certain responses will be cover this checkpoint?  </s>
<s> What about telling them in the documentation?  </s>
<s> If something in a Web app is unpredictable, it's usually unpredictable for non-disabled as well as disabled users.  </s>
<s> Furthermore, what is the true usability goal here: usability or learnability?  </s>
<s> What should the predictability be based on?  </s>
<s> Industry standards?  </s>
<s> The user's learned expectations within that Web app?  </s>
<s> For example, in some SAP Web apps, the user can tab to text.  </s>
<s> This may not be expected by new SAP users who use screen readers and are used to not being able to tab to anything but interactive elements, but new users have provided us with positive feedback on this feature, as it ensures they receive information about everything on the screen.***  </s>
<s> Success criteria You will have successfully met Checkpoint 3.5 at the Minimum Level if: * where inconsistent or unpredictable responses are essential to the function of the content (e.g. mystery games, adventure games, tests, etc.) the user is warned in advance of encountering them.  </s>

<s> You will have successfully met Checkpoint 3.5 at Level 3 if: * (presently no additional criteria for this level.)  </s>
<s> The following are additional ideas for enhancing a site along this particular dimension: * controls that look or sound the same should be designed to act the same, * conventions likely to be familiar to the user should be followed, * ***What does this mean for companies like ours?  </s>
<s> That we cannot do any new or innovative design?***  </s>
<s> * unusual user interface features or behaviors that are likely to confuse the first-time user should be described to the user before they are encountered.  </s>
<s> ***Would providing this information during training satisfy this point?***  </s>
<s> * ***We agree that basic browser navigation behavior should be followed, but we don't agree that it needs to be regulated through guidelines like these.***  </s>
<s> Definitions (informative) Mechanisms that cause extreme changes in context include: * opening a new browser window unexpectedly and without any nonvisual cue (back button suddenly appears nonfunctional) * in an auditory presentation, the speaker changes with no visual cue and no notation in captions.  </s>
<s> * captions that do not identify a change in speaker Common user actions include: * mouse movements * key activation * link selection * use of browser navigation buttons (e.g. back and forward) * opening new browser windows Common responses to user actions include: * loading a new page * exposing/concealing content based on mouse position or keyboard focus * displaying the contents of a menu (auditorally or visually) * displaying pop-up menus or windows * submitting a form It is important that responses to user actions be predictable and sensible to the end user and that interactions are consistent, both throughout the site and with commonly used interaction metaphors used throughout the Web.  </s>
<s> Benefits (informative) * Individuals who are unable to detect extreme changes in context or may not realize that the context has changed are less likely to become disoriented while navigating a site.  </s>
<s> This applies to people in the following ways: * Individuals who are blind or have low vision may have difficulty knowing when a visual context change, such as a new window popping up, has occurred.  </s>
<s> In this case, warning users of context changes in advance minimizes confusion when the user discovers that the back button no longer behaves as expected.  </s>
<s> * Using captions to note changes in speaker is beneficial for individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing and who may be unable to discern changes in speaker for audio-only presentations.  </s>
<s> * Some individuals with low vision, with dyslexia and who have difficulty interpreting visual cues may benefit from additional cues in order to detect extreme changes in context.  </s>
<s> Note: Providing consistent and predictable responses to user actions is important feedback for the user.  </s>
<s> This lets them know that your site is working properly and encourages them to continue interacting with the content.  </s>
<s> When the user receives an unexpected response, they might conclude that something is wrong or broken.  </s>
<s> Some people might get so confused they will not be able to use your site.  </s>
<s> Examples (informative) * Example 1: a form to deactivate pop-up windows.  </s>
<s> * A checkbox is provided on a page of links to let the user select whether they want the resultant pages to appear in new windows or not.  </s>
<s> * Example 2: a warning given before a pop-up window.  </s>

<s> The following are additional ideas for enhancing a site along this particular dimension: * (still under construction.) Partial list of items being explored for inclusion as success criteria or advisory recommendations * content under site control is written as clearly and simply as the author feels [appropriate / possible] for the purpose of the content.  </s>
<s> * a statement is provided on the site which asserts that those responsible for the site have reviewed the materials on the site and the content under their control is written as clearly and simply as they feel is [appropriate / possible] for the purpose of the content.  </s>
<s> * summaries and/or simpler forms are provided for key pages or sections of the site.  </s>
<s> ***What should be considered "key" pages or sections?  </s>
<s> Who decides that?*** * provide an outline or a summary for your document.  </s>
<s> * ***Points 3 and 4 would be an additional burden for us to implement in our Web apps.  </s>
<s> Plus, summaries would cause maintenance headaches.***  </s>
<s> * break up long paragraphs into shorter ones, with one idea per paragraph.  </s>
<s> * break up long sentences into shorter ones.  </s>
<s> * ***Wouldn't 5 and 6 be considered issues of style?  </s>
<s> How can you regulate style?***  </s>
<s> * provide accurate unique page titles.  </s>
<s> * ***Does this mean, for example, use the HTML title tag, or are we talking about the title in the content section of a page?*** * ensure that headings and link text are unique and that they make sense when read out of context.  </s>
<s> * ***This would require a lot of effort to implement in Web apps like ours.  </s>
<s> We might have three group boxes on a screen, each of which has its own Submit button specific to that group box.  </s>
<s> But we would still use the text "Submit" for each button.  </s>
<s> If this is made into a criteria, it should be a Level 3.*** * provide definitions for any jargon or specialized terminology used in your document.  </s>
<s> * ***Where would we put these in a Web app?  </s>
<s> Would a glossary of terms be good enough?  </s>
<s> SAP has a lot of specialized terminology, and each industry that our applications address has a lot of its own specialized terminology as well.***  </s>
<s> * provide explanations of figurative, metaphorical, or idiomatic uses of language (for example, 'haven't seen you in a coons age' or 'the sight tore my heart out').  </s>
<s> * ***If you have to explain such language usage, why would you use it in the first place?  </s>
<s> Again, this is a style issue that we don't feel should be regulated.***  </s>
<s> * language should be used that your intended audience ought to be familiar with.  </s>
<s> * ***This one would be better to use than Point 10 or Point 12.*** * when introducing new concepts or terms, they should be defined or annotated in language that the audience is expected to be familiar with, or definitions or explanations should be linked to that might be easier to understand.  </s>
<s> Benefits (informative) * All users, especially those with cognitive, learning, and/or reading disabilities benefit from the use of clear and simple writing.  </s>
<s> This should not discourage you from expressing complex or technical ideas.  </s>
<s> * Using clear and simple language also benefits people whose first language differs from your own, including those people who communicate primarily in sign language.  </s>
<s> Checkpoint 4.2 Supplement text with non-text content.  </s>
<s> Success criteria You will have successfully met Checkpoint 4.2 at the Minimum Level if: * authors have included non-text content to supplement text for key pages or sections of the site where they felt it was appropriate.  </s>
<s> * ***Deciding whether it is "appropriate" is very subjective.  </s>
<s> How would you measure whether this checkpoint had been met?  </s>
<s> What are "key" pages or sections, and who defines that?***  </s>
<s> You will have successfully met Checkpoint 4.2 at Level 2 if: * there is a statement on the site asserting that the materials have been reviewed and that text has been supplemented with non-text content to the extent deemed appropriate by the author.  </s>
<s> * ***It's not clear what the difference is between this level and Level 3. Please clarify.***  </s>
<s> You will have successfully met Checkpoint 4.2 at Level 3 if: * there is a statement on the site asserting that non-text content has been added to the site for key pages or sections specifically to make the site more understandable by users who cannot understand the text only version of the site.  </s>
<s> The following are additional ideas for enhancing a site along this particular dimension: * (presently no additional criteria for this level.) Note: Supplementing text with non-text (e.g. graphics, sound, smell, etc) is useful for all users.  </s>
<s> However there are no clear guidelines as it relates to disability.  </s>
<s> Specific objective criteria that could be applied across all types of content are therefore not possible.  </s>
<s> Advisory recommendations are, however, listed below to provide guidance in this area.  </s>
<s> See also the techniques documents for the different technologies.  </s>
<s> Reviewer's Note: Do we have any items to add here or do we just include examples below?  </s>
<s> Definitions (informative) Non-text content - includes images, text in raster images, image map regions, animations (e.g., animated GIFs), applets and programmatic objects, ASCII art, scripts, images used as list bullets, spacers, graphical buttons, sounds (played with or without user interaction), stand-alone audio files, audio tracks of video, and video.  </s>
<s> Reviewer's Note: Is this definition adequate?  </s>
<s> Benefits (informative) ***These benefits really focus on Web sites.  </s>
<s> What about Web apps?*** * Sounds, graphics, videos and animations can help make concepts presented in a Web site easier to understand, especially for people with cognitive, reading, or learning disabilities or those who are unfamiliar with the language of the text of the site.  </s>
<s> Note: Designers need to be cautious in deciding when to use illustrations.  </s>
<s> Reading a picture is probably a learned activity that is easier for some than others.  </s>
<s> Some users skip the pictures; others read only the pictures.  </s>
<s> Designers must also recognize that visual conventions are not universal and that individuals develop their own mental schema and expectations in interpreting visual information.  </s>
<s> ***This note is asking a lot of designers.  </s>
<s> It essentially asks them to know about all different kinds of cognitive disabilities.***  </s>
<s> Examples (informative) * Example 1: a description of a process.  </s>
<s> * A page describes how to learn to play soccer.  </s>
<s> Each step in learning the fundamentals of the game is illustrated with a photograph of a player doing what is described in the text.  </s>
<s> * Example 2: a concrete concept.  </s>
<s> * The primary concept on a page is concrete.  </s>
<s> It is discussing Mt. Pinatubo.  </s>
<s> It includes both a description of the 1991 eruption as well as photos of the eruption and the aftermath.  </s>
<s> It links to another site that contains video and another site that contains a 3D simulation of what happened underneath the crust and within the volcano during the eruption.  </s>
<s> * Example 3: child's report of school trip.  </s>
<s> * A child went with her school on a trip to a bicycle manufacturing plant.  </s>
<s> She wrote a report for her family and friends to post to the Web.  </s>
<s> In the report, she includes the company logo as well as a picture of a bicycle on the assembly line.  </s>
<s> She links to the company Web site for more information.  </s>
<s> She includes photos she took of the plant.  </s>
<s> * Example 4: stock trading data.  </s>
<s> * A news site is comparing the performance of the economy from 3rd quarter of this year with 3rd quarter from the last 3 years.  </s>
<s> They compare prices of the most popular stocks.  </s>
<s> They present the data in a bar graph with a link to the raw data they used to create the bar graph.  </s>
<s> * Example 5: history of music.  </s>
<s> * A grandfather's hobby is listening to and playing music.  </s>
<s> He creates a Web site that includes examples of many different types of music and musical instruments.  </s>
<s> When describing specific types of music, he links to a short sound clip.  </s>
<s> Checkpoint 4.3 Annotate complex, abbreviated, or unfamiliar information with summaries and definitions.  </s>
<s> Success criteria You will have successfully met Checkpoint 4.3 at the Minimum Level if: * acronyms and abbreviations are defined the first time they appear.  </s>
<s> * ***The first time they appear on a page?  </s>
<s> On the site (or Web app)?  </s>
<s> How can you know where the user has started, in order to determine whether this is the first time they are encountering the acronym or abbreviation?  </s>
<s> It might require redesigning screens, because of the limitations on screen space.  </s>
<s> Particularly in Web apps like ours, meeting this checkpoint would be very resource-consuming.***  </s>
<s> You will have successfully met Checkpoint 4.3 at Level 2 if: * there is a statement on the site which asserts that authors or others have reviewed the content and provided annotations for information where they felt is appropriate You will have successfully met Checkpoint 4.3 at Level 3 if: * (presently no additional criteria for this level.)  </s>
<s> The following are additional ideas for enhancing a site along this particular dimension: * provide a definition or link (with the first occurrence) of phrases, words, acronyms, and abbreviations specific to a particular community.  </s>
<s> * provide a summary for relationships that may not be obvious from analyzing the structure of a table but that may be apparent in a visual rendering of the table.  </s>
<s> * ***We did not understand this point.  </s>
<s> Could you give an example?***  </s>
<s> * if contracted forms of words are used such that they are ambiguous, provide semantic markup to make words unique and interpretable.  </s>
<s> * ***Not sure what this point means.  </s>
<s> What is "semantic markup"?***  </s>
<s> Definitions (informative) Content is considered complex if the relationships between pieces of information are not easy to figure out.  </s>
<s> If the presentation of the information is intended to highlight trends or relationships between concepts, these should be explicitly stated in the summary.  </s>
<s> Examples of complex information: * data tables, * concepts that are esoteric or difficult to understand, * content that involves several layers.  </s>
<s> Content might be unfamiliar if you are using terms specific to a particular community.  </s>
<s> For example, many of the terms used in this document are specific to the disability community.  </s>
<s> Benefits (informative) * Summarizing information that is difficult to understand helps people who do not read well.  </s>
<s> * Providing a summary of the visual cues that show relationships between complex information helps people who do not use visual cues or who have difficulty using visual cues.  </s>
<s> For example, people who are completely blind do not use any visual cues, while people with dyslexia or with low vision might have difficulty interpreting visual cues.  </s>
<s> * Defining key terms and specialized language will help people who are not familiar with the topic.  </s>
<s> * Providing the expansion of abbreviations and acronyms not only helps people who are not familiar with the abbreviation or acronym but can clarify which meaning of an abbreviation or acronym is appropriate to use.  </s>
<s> For example, the acronym "ADA" stands for both the American with Disabilities Act as well as the American Dental Association.  </s>
<s> Guideline 5 - Robust.  </s>
<s> Use Web technologies that maximize the ability of the content to work with current and future accessibility technologies and user agents.  </s>
<s> Checkpoint 5.1 Use technologies according to specification.  </s>
<s> Success criteria You will have successfully met Checkpoint 5.1 at the Minimum Level if: * for markup, except where the site has documented that a specification was violated for backward compatibility, the markup has passed validity tests of the language (whether it be conforming to a schema, Document Type Definition (DTD), or other tests described in the specification), structural elements and attributes are used as defined in the specification, accessibility features are used, and deprecated features are avoided.  </s>
<s> * for Application Programming Interfaces (API's), programming standards for the language are followed.  </s>
<s> * accessibility features and API's are used when available.  </s>
<s> You will have successfully met Checkpoint 5.1 at Level 2 if: * for markup, the markup has passed validity tests of the language (whether it be conforming to a schema, DTD, or other tests described in the specification), structural elements and attributes are used as defined in the specification, accessibility features are used, and deprecated features are avoided.  </s>

<s> The following are additional ideas for enhancing a site along this particular dimension: * (presently no additional criteria for this level.) Reviewer's Note: Are protocols relevant to this checkpoint?  </s>
<s> If so, why, and should we require that they be used according to specification?  </s>
<s> Obviously there are interoperability advantages in doing so, but is this pertinent to accessibility?  </s>
<s> Benefits (informative) * When languages, API's, and protocols are used according to specification, tools that use the results will be able to do so as intended and expected.  </s>
<s> Examples (informative) * Example 1: structural elements.  </s>
<s> * Throughout a Web site, structural elements are not used for purposes of presentation.  </s>
<s> Likewise, presentational elements are not used for purposes of structure.  </s>
<s> * Example 2: accessible API's.  </s>
<s> * A Java program uses the accessibility API defined by the language.  </s>

<s> Checkpoint 5.2 Design for backward compatibility.  </s>
<s> ***This point seems focused only on the general public user community.  </s>
<s> But what about the user community for certain products?  </s>
<s> Shouldn't a company like ours be allowed to decide ourselves if we want our products to be backwards compatible?  </s>
<s> If backwards compatibility becomes regulated, it would limit companies' ability to sell upgrades to existing customers.***  </s>
<s> Success criteria You will have successfully met Checkpoint 5.2 at the Minimum Level if: * baseline user agent requirements have been determined and are documented in metadata and / or a policy statement on the site.  </s>
<s> * Note: When determining your baseline user agent requirements, consider that assistive hardware and software is often slow to adapt to technological advances, and the availability of assistive technology varies across natural languages.  </s>
<s> Verify that assistive technology compatible with the technologies you choose is available in the natural language(s) of your content.  </s>
<s> * ***How far backwards-compatible is far enough?  </s>
<s> Who determines that?  </s>
<s> How do you measure that?  </s>
<s> Should you force people not to use Flash at all, for example, even if they provide an accessible alternative?***  </s>
<s> * the content is still usable when features above the baseline (for example, scripting and stylesheets) are turned off or not supported.  </s>
<s> You will have successfully met Checkpoint 5.2 at Level 2 if: * (presently no additional criteria for this level.)  </s>
<s> You will have successfully met Checkpoint 5.2 at Level 3 if: * (presently no additional criteria for this level.)  </s>
<s> The following are additional ideas for enhancing a site along this particular dimension: * (presently no additional criteria for this level.) Benefits (informative) Benefits of determining and documenting baseline user agent requirements: * Individuals can identify (either through site documentation or automatically through metadata) whether or not they are likely to be able to use a site.  </s>
<s> In conjunction with a search engine or a proxy server, this could be used to automatically filter out sites a user can not access or to automatically filter to the top sites that would be most usable.  </s>
<s> * Requiring sites to document their baseline will cause them to evaluate assumptions about user agents and will minimize the number of sites that are inadvertently inaccessible because they are unaware of backward compatibility issues.  </s>
<s> Benefits of designing for backward compatibility: * Individuals who must use alternative browsing technologies and devices will be able to access the content.  </s>
<s> * Individuals who can not afford or otherwise do not have access to newer technologies also benefit from backward compatibility in that they will not need to purchase upgrades or equipment as often.  </s>
<s> Examples (informative) * Example 1: an online store.  </s>
<s> * By documenting minimum user agent requirements, the store makes it possible for people using particular technologies to determine if they are going to have trouble using the store or its checkout mechanism without having to go through the entire process of shopping and checkout only to find out that they are unable to complete their transaction at the end.  </s>
<s> They can, therefore, shop at stores they can be successful at.  </s>
<s> * Example 2: an Intranet site.  </s>
<s> * A large company was concerned about the ability to address individuals at many diverse sites that have different technology bases.  </s>
<s> They have, therefore, created two versions of their content and documented the requirements for each, making it easy for individual sites to determine which version would work for their technologies.  </s>
<s> Checkpoint 5.3 Choose technologies that are designed to support accessibility.  </s>
<s> ***The baseline AT needs to be defined.  </s>
<s> Otherwise it's too difficult to figure out which AT to support.***  </s>
<s> Success criteria You will have successfully met Checkpoint 5.3 at the Minimum Level if: * the technology or combination of technologies chosen: * support device independence * include accessibility features * have publicly documented interfaces for interoperability * ***Not sure what this means.  </s>
<s> What are publicly documented interfaces?*** * make use of operating system accessibility features (either directly or via the user agent) supported by assistive technologies in the natural language(s) of the content * are implemented in user agents and/or proxies in the natural language(s) of the content * ***Not sure what this means.  </s>
<s> Please clarify.***  </s>
<s> You will have successfully met Checkpoint 5.3 at Level 2 if: * (presently no additional criteria for this level.)  </s>
<s> You will have successfully met Checkpoint 5.3 at Level 3 if: * (presently no additional criteria for this level.)  </s>
<s> The following are additional ideas for enhancing a site along this particular dimension: * (presently no additional criteria for this level.) Benefits (informative) * Authors who utilize technologies designed to support accessibility will: * encounter fewer challenges when implementing these guidelines * avoid the need to create custom solutions and workarounds to address accessibility concerns * avoid the need to provide accessible alternate versions for content rendered in a technology that does not fully address these guidelines Checkpoint 5.4 Ensure that user interfaces are accessible or provide an accessible alternative.  </s>
<s> Success criteria You will have successfully met Checkpoint 5.4 at the Minimum Level if: * any applications with custom user interfaces conform to at least Level A of the http://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG10/ User Agent Accessibility Guidelines 1.0.  </s>
<s> If the application cannot be made accessible, an alternative, accessible solution is provided.  </s>
<s> * ***This point needs to be clearer.  </s>
<s> We cannot tell if we would need to follow these other guidelines.  </s>
<s> If a Web app runs in a standard browser, does the interface still have to conform to the other guidelines?  </s>
<s> What is considered an accessible alternative?  </s>
<s> A text-only site?  </s>
<s> What would be an accessible alternative for a Web app page?***  </s>
<s> You will have successfully met Checkpoint 5.4 at Level 2 if: * the interface has been tested using a variety of assistive technologies and preferably real people with disabilities who use assistive technologies to determine that assistive technologies can access all information on the page or hidden within the page.  </s>
<s> ***What does "or hidden within the page" mean?  </s>
<s> * Variety of assistive technologies" needs to be defined.  </s>
<s> Otherwise it's too vague.  </s>
<s> Is it enough, for example, to target JAWS and MAGic?*** * ***About the Reviewer's Note: Not sure how it would be possible to comply with the checkpoint without carrying out tests.  </s>
<s> The text specifically says "the interface has been tested."  </s>
<s> Please clarify.***  </s>
<s> * Reviewer's Note: It would be possible to comply with the checkpoint without carrying out tests (either with users or with assistive technologies).  </s>
<s> Conversely, it is possible to conduct tests, but still fail to meet the checkpoint (with respect to assistive technologies that were not tested, for example).  </s>
<s> Should this success criterion be deleted?  </s>
<s> * device-independent access to functionality is provided * accessibility conventions of the markup or programming language (API's or specific markup) are used You will have successfully met Checkpoint 5.4 at Level 3 if: * (presently no additional criteria for this level.)  </s>
<s> The following are additional ideas for enhancing a site along this particular dimension: * (presently no additional criteria for this level.) Benefits (informative) * Individuals who rely on assistive technologies to access the Web will be able interact with the content.  </s>
<s> * Individuals who access the Web with older technologies or alternative browsing devices such as PDAs and cell phones also benefit from the inclusion of accessible alternatives to custom user interfaces.  </s>
<s> Appendix A: Glossary Reviewer's Note: Should we include only the definitions of terms appearing in the guidelines or is there some subset of key terms from the glossary that should also be included?  </s>
