Please omit the first two tokens (ie. 
DOM TS). 
I was a bit too fast in sending this without sanity checking first. 
Thanks to Joe Kesselman for pointing this out.

A few notes on mailing to this list Hello all To simplify readability and categorizing, I propose that we stick to the following conventions: 
Use [xxx] in your email's subject line to describe the content and topic of the mail. 
For example, an email dealing with process issues, should be written [DOM TS Process: particular issue] 
Possible values are then [DOM TS Process] [DOM TS Design] [DOM TS Scope] [DOM TS Documentation] [DOM TS General] within which you can give the particular before closing and separate it with a ':'. 
Have I forgotten anything? 
/D 
[and noting later:] 
I don't know if it matters much, but usually one sees only the token in brackets, not the whole subject or issue: Subject: [Process] particular issue Making it a little easier to read, I think. 
-- Ken 
I second that. 
Let's remove "DOM TS" which doesn't convey extra information! 
[DOM TS Process] [DOM TS Design] [DOM TS Scope] [DOM TS Documentation] [DOM TS General]
