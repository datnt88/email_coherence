<s> Hi Folks, I've added the decisions made to the face to face page at: and notes from the i18n meeting.  </s>
<s> I don't intend to do any more minutes than this and will be seeking approval of the minutes at this Friday's telecon.  </s>
<s> Brian  </s>
<s> Shouldn't that be *NOT* start with a combining character?  </s>
<s> I18N suggests that comparison of URI's behaves as if they are UNICODE normalised, but not does require that such normalization is performed.  </s>
<s> I18N agree that RDFCore requires a transitive string comparison algorithm and requests that the specs do not mislead application developers into thinking they are not permitted to implement a more flexible string matching algorithm, e.g. on queries.  </s>
<s> I18N note that the strings defining languages occasionally change and suggests that RDFCore may choose to use URI's to name languages.  </s>
<s> RDFCore agree to consider.  </s>
<s> I18N found the proposed solution of literals being a pair of a string and a language tag acceptable.  </s>
<s> I18N agree that n-triples is an internal tool for the WG and developers and is not subject to the same internationization concerns of more public syntaxes.  </s>
<s> I18N request that the specs make this limited role for n-triples clear.  </s>
<s> There was some dicussion of RDFCore concerns of lack of implementation of charmod and other specs delaying completion of RDFCore.  </s>
<s> I think there was also a concern that the relevant I18N specs would not be at the appropriate recommendation status when the RDF specs are ready to move forward.  </s>

<s> JOKE: We could ensure that by putting in a large number of last call comments.  </s>
<s> Somewhat more seriously ... At this stage I am planning to make a last call comment on charmod's 2nd last call to the effect that the existence of royalty free normalizing transcoders for a large number of character encodings should be an exit criterion for charmod CR.  </s>
<s> I believe that charmod's 2nd last call may get out before we do.  </s>
<s> I believe we are progressing faster than charmod.  </s>
