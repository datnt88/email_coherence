Hi: It appears to me that the current list of RDFS axioms is missing rdf:List rdf:type rdfs:Class . 
Whoops, indeed. 
Will fix. 
Also isn't it the case that rdfs:Datatyperdfs:type rdfs:Class . 
not rdfs:Datatyperdfs:subClassOf rdfs:Literal . 
Ditto. 
and that there should be a rule xxx rdf:type rdfs:Datatype. 
--- xxx rdfs:subClassOf rdfs:Literal . 
Yes... except this needs to be thought through a bit more, given the new way of handling badly-typed literals. 
I'll get back to you on that. 
Thanks for catching these. 
Too many late nights.

As discussed on the telecon, RDFS editors draft currently has an "@@ find out what the MT says" TODO regarding this question. 
Can you let me know what the current situation is, so RDFS can reflect that? 
rdfs:member is a super-property of each of rdf:_1, rdf:_2, etc. 
We call these the container member properties, and have them as members of rdfs:ContainerMembershipProperty. 
Do we have rdfs:member in that class as well? 
I just want to make sure that RDFS echos what the MT thinks on this issue. 
If there are concerns, we can flag those up in the MT document under Status or in the appropriate section. 
Thanks for any advice, Dan 
The MT is completely agnostic on the issue. 
The currently frozen draft says No, but it could say Yes just as easily by changing two lines in the document. 
If you want me to toss a coin, I can do that. 
Or, you tell me. 
Lets say 'no, it isn't', in that case. 
right, I agree Jos De Roo, AGFA http://www.agfa.com/w3c/jdroo/
