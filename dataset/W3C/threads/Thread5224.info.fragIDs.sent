Glenn, GA: Could you explain this "knife and fork" model that you have now referred to a few times? 
I can guess what you might mean, but I'm would rather you explain. 
Sorry - guilty of using a stock expression that is almost certainly not global...... By 'knife and fork' model - I mean a mechanism where each tiny piece must be carved out of a whole (knife), picked up and placed where wanted (fork), as a deliberate specified act. 
This is the current model for (non US CC style) subtitling/captioning files. 
The files read like a script for display activity. 
All calculations regarding line lengths, layout, impact of font sizes, timing etc - are (or at least should be) performed by the author. 
There is no concept of user (viewer) override of style. 
Note: these comments are specific to Non US subtitling/captioning, US CC by its very design nature allows - and anticipates - that the viewer can impose style overrides upon the captions/subtitles. 
Is there a better terminology for this concept? 
I see a spectrum here that ranges from: hard layout / style (knife and fork) - soft style (e.g. US CC) - rhetorical ontology (user CSS?) regards John Birch The views and opinions expressed are the author's own and do not necessarily reflect the views and opinions of Screen Subtitling Systems Limited. 
I guess what you are describing is essentially: 1.authoring time line layout (hard layout) 2.presentation time line layout (soft layout) We have already included the style property wrap-option, defined at [1] to support authoring time determination of which of these models apply. 
In order to express authoring time line separators, we have included force line break as a presentation flow vocabulary item and break-after and break-before as style properties that induce the same effect. 
What we haven't yet defined in the requirements document is an ability for the author to express timing or style semantics to be applied to line areas that are produced by the second of the above modes (soft layout). 
This is why I suggested the idea of a pseudo selector that allows expressing authorial intent about objects that are produced by an implied presentation process, i.e., line and glyph areas.

Glenn, comments below in green -----Original Message----- I guess what you are describing is essentially: 1.authoring time line layout (hard layout) 2.presentation time line layout (soft layout) We have already included the style property wrap-option, defined at [1] to support authoring time determination of which of these models apply. 
[JB ] CSS wrap-option property does not have a value that produces balanced lines. 
Justification properties do not appear to help either. 
GA: What do you mean by "balanced lines"? 
If you mean left and right block justified, then the text-align property would be used to specify justify. 
Whether to perform soft layout, i.e., UA line wrapping, is independent of the alignment of line areas in the containing block area. 
In order to express authoring time line separators, we have included force line break as a presentation flow vocabulary item and break-after and break-before as style properties that induce the same effect. 
[JB ] Might I suggest also a requirement for prefix-before in order to support the inclusion of symbols such as # (for music) and - or   for speaker change? 
Or can this be handled in another way? 
- can't be in content if supporting soft layout! 
GA: This model is supported by the Generated Content mechanisms of CSS2, e.g., using the :before and :after pseudo-element selectors in combination with the content property. 
However, there are some possible problems with using such a facility for anything more than very simiple content generation, e.g., one can't specify marked up content in the style sheet in order to correctly support generic internationalized text. 
Thus far, we have not entertained a requirement to support stylesheet based generated content. 
Would you propose we do so? 
What we haven't yet defined in the requirements document is an ability for the author to express timing or style semantics to be applied to line areas that are produced by the second of the above modes (soft layout). 
This is why I suggested the idea of a pseudo selector that allows expressing authorial intent about objects that are produced by an implied presentation process, i.e., line and glyph areas. 
[JB ] The pseudo selector may allow the imposition of style on soft layout - though I have questions - see other post. 
However, I don't see how it works for timing. 
Given soft timing of text into a given sized region - there is nothing that hints to the UA how to control the flow of text into that region. 
The display property gives boolean control (visible | hidden) but not a pop on , off, on mode. 
There is no property to control the mark space ratio between visible and hidden during the soft timed period. 
If you are intending to use the region as a snaked or line by line region you would set the overflow properties to scroll - but there is insufficient subtlety in the related properties to achieve the desired effect. 
[JB ] I will try and enumerate all the possible combinations that might be wanted, as a sequence of diagrams of how the region would change over time.

[GA] : This model is supported by the Generated Content mechanisms of CSS2, e.g., using the :before and :after pseudo-element selectors in combination with the content property. 
However, there are some possible problems with using such a facility for anything more than very simiple content generation, e.g., one can't specify marked up content in the style sheet in order to correctly support generic internationalized text. 
Thus far, we have not entertained a requirement to support stylesheet based generated content. 
Would you propose we do so? 
[JB ] Yes, but I don't think you would need to include support for marked up content as generated content. 
Certainly in the soft layout scenario, I perceive a requirement for the generation of certain simple content as a result of UA decisions (specifically line breaking decisions) Examples: Original content is this. 
It is music lyrics - so by convention would have a # character prefix in UK subtitling / captioning market Scooby dooby doo where are you? 
So broken onto two lines it might look like this # Scooby dooby doo # where are you BUT on one line it would look like this # Scooby dooby doo where are you? 
In the US (musical note not very representative of real glyph used) broken onto two lines it might look like this ?Scooby dooby doo? 
?where are you? 
BUT on one line it would look like this ?Scooby dooby doo where are you? 
I'd like to generate this content - at least in the soft layout model - by application of style - not by inclusion in the content. 
Speaker indication may also use a similar mechanism - but here the characters are included upon change of speaker within the same subtitle. 
So the following is spoken by two different speakers 
- Enjoy the dance last night? 
- Yes, did you? 
Enjoy the dance last night? 
Yes, did you? 
A more interesting problem is that IIRC, the before: and after: selectors work on identified elements or ranges. 
Could this be made to work on the 'displayed lines' as created by a soft layout UA? regards John Birch The views and opinions expressed are the author's own and do not necessarily reflect the views and opinions of Screen Subtitling Systems Limited. 
A "select all lines" selector could handle the prefix and suffix insertions below, e.g., For speaker sensitive generated content, one could use a class or role attribute and use a complex selector predicate, e.g., Glenn [GA.]
