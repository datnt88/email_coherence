Hi All: Has anyone out there dealt with the accessibility of citations? 
My site includes citations that are formatted according to official guidelines established by the publishing industry. 
An example would be: IL-17 derived from juxta-articular bone and synovium contributes to joint degradation in rheumatoid arthritis Martine Chabaud, Erik Lubberts, Leo Joosten, Wim van den Berg, and Pierre Miossec Arthritis Res 2001, 3(3): 168177. 
Is it safe to assume that a disabled user will understand that "Arthritis Res 2001, 3(3): 168177" represents the journal Arthritis Research, published in 2001, volume 3, issue 3, on pages 168-177, but an vision impaired person would have to know each of these since the screen reader would read the citation verbatim. 
The audience for the site (http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov) is mainly the scientific community. 
Any ideas/suggestions? 
As always, thanks for your help!

Hello Brooke, Screen readers have facilities for reading down to the individual character at a time if the user so chooses. 
Whether the user knows what the citation means is more a reflection of the familiarity with citation format. 
I would strongly suggest that you not change from standard format because as an example then if I base my knowledge of proper format on your site, I'm going to be wrong if I use it someplace else. 
Does the actual citation on your page have alt text or something so the user doesn't get the .gif which is included in your example? 
This doesn't seem to be a blindness related accessibility issue. 
Whether your sighted or blind, one still only sees or hears the following string of characters: "Arthritis Res 2001, 3(3): 168-177" The question I ask Brooke is how does the sighted visitor know that this really represents: "the journal Arthritis Research, published in 2001, volume 3, issue 3, on pages 168-177," ? 
I would suggest that somewhere on the site you explain what citation format conventions you are using. 
This text explanation is all it would take. 
In my opinion any special mark-up would be overkill since nothing would support it anyway. 
If the citations are coming from a database via an XML string of data, then perhaps you could the software add a title= attribute to contain the XML human readable explanation of journal, published, volume, issue, pages, etc. 
However, there are (or at least were when I went to college) conventions or citation standards that seemed less cryptic than the convention you are using, one that uses the full date format, uses the abbreviation for pages as pgs., eds. 
for editors, v for volume, etc. would be more helpful to all visitors, perhaps even the cognitive impaired.
