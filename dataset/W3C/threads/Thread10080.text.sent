I've seen nothing proposed that I could decide on. 
If anyone from the WG wants to promote it, please can you outline it on this list in advance. 
Take care to get the syntax right :) Dave To clarify, I am proposing that would result in the triple #foo some:property XML" h1 Blargh /h1 "@en . 
Where the interpretation of such XML literals would be akin to that of M&amp;S along with the new considerations of canonicalization, and such. 
Thus parseType="Literal" would not result in a typed literal of any kind, and the datatype rdfs:XMLLiteral would be removed from all RDF specs. 
As a second part of this proposal, lang tags would simply be ignored for typed literals and removed from the graph syntax for typed literals entirely. 
Thus would result in the triple #foo some:property "10"^^xsd:int . 
and not #foo some:property "10"@en^^xsd:int . 
I guess these really constitute two proposals, but the first enables the second, and both address last call comments.

said: This is reversing a previous decision on XML literals being made into typed literals with the rdf:XMLLiteral URI as the datatype URI. 
Please can you explain the new information that was brought up and the reason for this particular solution. 
I wouldn't cite M&amp;S as particularly specific on this point. 
We discussed this many times before and parseType="Literal" was too vague in M&amp;S. 
OK, I'm clear on what you want to do. 
I want to know why. 
Yes and on this second proposal, please explain what new information means this change is required. 
Which specific last call comments (URIs please) does it/they address? 
Both of these will cause significant implementation rewritings/reversions - and I *do* know this since I recall changing it last time. 
Plus there is also having to update/revert and check several test cases and WD text changes. 
Dave The "new information" here is that someone outside our group took a look at the design resulting from the previous decision and said that it was a mess. 
That is not of itself compelling, but I think it's significant because I think that within the group we've got to a stage that we feel unable to challenge hard-won consensus. 
I think that it's significant that someone outside the group felt strongly enough to raise an issue that seems to have some resonance within the group. 
None of these are sufficient reasons to make the changes suggested, but I think they are sufficient to suggest reconsideration.

said: I fully appreciate that fact. 
Simple. 
As Peter points out, and I agree, having a single "special" datatype that does not work the same as all other datatypes is a problem. 
Well, we certainly would be following the intent of the charter if we clarified things accordingly. 
I think the WG would have a very strong and fast concensus of how non-datatype XML literals would be defined and the editorial effort would not be prohibitive. 
So that *all* rdfs:Datatype's would have identical treatment. 
Fair enough. 
But I think this falls within the scope of "doing it right this time around". 
Patrick "Patrick.Stickler" 
said: We should look up the reason we made this change last time - why was rdf:XMLLiteral invented. 
It might be it still remains the least worst option of several. 
Is there any *critical* reason why this special case is a problem or is this just a consistency "yuck" argument? 
If the latter there are several choices to make all literals act the same. 
Throwing out xml:lang everywhere, adding it everywhere. 
Adding a datatype to all literals such as rdf:PlainLiteral. 
Sorry, the editorial effort is not minimal - we still haven't worked any of the details of the rdf-wrapper thing, and I don't like it so far. 
So I'm checking for good reasons why, and consistency while nice, isn't one. 
The implementation effort is also greater. 
ok, it is consistency. 
I rate that as not sufficient alone. 
Dave said: In that case, what is wrong (broken, critical) that we are now meant to be doing right? 
On proposal #2, what is wrong with lang tags on XML literals, that you cannot live with or breaks something?
