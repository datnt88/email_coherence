Hi, when I use Amaya for linux (105 int with dead keys) it happens that the I get a &amp;agrave; instead of &amp;aacute;. 
I use the option "enable multi-key". 
Does any know a work around for this? 
BTW, in windows works fine. 
Thanks.

Sorry I tested that configuration but I didn't have that error.

This problem occurs because the keyboard layout, I use US w/ dead keys. 
If I disable the layout amaya works fine. 
On the other hand, amaya should work without turn on the support for multi key, just like windows. 
Bye.
