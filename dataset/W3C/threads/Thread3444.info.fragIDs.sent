<s> The home page validation is an indicator but a loosely one, because imagine members start to worry about the validity of their home page, they will achieve a better press coverage... but it will not mean that the rest of the Web site is valid or all Web sites that a compagny has in charge.  </s>
<s> For example, it would be good to define a relative scale of validity for a whole website.  </s>
<s> proportion of valid pages 50% BAD 50%-70% you're on the good way 70%-90% good 90%-100% Great!!! you have a valid website.  </s>
<s> After the same time we "evangelize" for validity, we have also to evangelize for the correct semantic use of tags and the accessibility.  </s>
<s> for example You can make a valid document, which is completely incorrect for the  </s>
<s> semantic, like using a "blockquote" element to indent un text and not for a citation.  </s>

<s> The situation with W3C members may be the same, I don't know, I can't and won't speak for all W3C members.  </s>
<s> My only experience is that my W3C Host, Keio university/Shonan Fujisawa Campus, has most pages on its site valid, and that's partly because some people from the W3C Team helped and convinced them it was important.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, the global home for Keio university is invalid...  </s>
<s> I wish the survey continues, in order to see whether these figures should make me sad or optimistic.  </s>
<s> A possible conclusion, today, would be that if "we" want to convince people to respect web standards, there may not be any "easy target".  </s>
<s> But then again, how do you define the proportion of valid/invalid material?  </s>

<s> What's the traffic approach?  </s>
<s> Imagine you have 4 documents on a site (we'll call them 1,2,3 and 4), accounting for, resp.  </s>
<s> 40%, 30%, 20% and 10% of the traffic for this site.  </s>
<s> Now imagine that documents 1 and 4 are invalid.  </s>
<s> that's 50% of the documents, and 50% of the traffic, and that's bad.  </s>
<s> If you have time to fix both documents, fine, but if you have time to fix only one?  </s>
<s> The usual approach woud be that, well, just fix one and you'll have only 25% of the documents that are invalid.  </s>
<s> The traffic approach says, fix document 1 and go up to 90% of your traffic being valid.  </s>
<s> That may sound ridiculous with 4 documents, but when it's 40000, with a lot of legacy, unmaintained documents, you're happy when you can go from 50% valid to 90% valid by fixing only 25% of the documents.  </s>
<s> I'm preparing an article/LogV tutorial that explains this and other ideas to "fix" better, so stay tuned.  </s>
<s> Now that's a summary :) Olivier Thereaux - W3C  </s>
<s> IMO such a document cannot be said to be valid.  </s>
<s> That validator.w3.org doesn't find any errors does not mean that the document is valid, similar to how running a document through your word processor's spell checker is no match for having it proof-read by a person.  </s>
<s> /Jonas  </s>
<s> The W3C page on document validation somewhat discusses this problem at http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/sgml/intro.html , even though they're focusing on technical mistakes like illegal (but 'valid') attribute values.  </s>
<s> Validation is simply a check against the referenced DTD, nothing else.  </s>
<s> So any HTML document that conforms to the referenced DTD is valid.  </s>
<s> Whether the document uses the right markup for the right content, or whether the text makes any sense at all, is not part of the validation process.  </s>
<s> That's why even valid HTML, just like spell-checked documents, can be complete gibberish.  </s>
<s> See http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=35080%40sdcc12.ucsd.edu&amp;output=gplain .  </s>
<s> But of course I do agree that semantic is very important.  </s>
<s> This aspect of the standards sometimes gets lost in the recent coolness of validation.  </s>
<s> Perhaps it gets lost because correct semantics require that the author actually know the standards, while validation can be done by a stupid machine.  </s>
<s> Matthias Do You Yahoo!? Yahoo!  </s>
<s> Finance - Get real-time stock quotes  </s>
<s> There's more than that, there are requirements in the W3C specifications which can not be defined with a DTD.  </s>
<s> So can make a three level rocket ;) 1. Validity with regards to the DTD Automatic process if the validator checks everything and does not contains errors.  </s>
<s> 2. Conformance with regards to the specifications.  </s>
<s> For example, the stylesheet language when you are not using a style element or/and an external style sheet.  </s>
<s> See http://www.la-grange.net/2002/04/03-styleatt-wo-meta.html 3. Respect of the semantic as you said in your mail.  </s>
<s> On top of that we can add the respect of the semantics.  </s>
<s> :) I think the respect of the Semantic will be the most difficult to achieve even if it's the easiest to achieve and understand.  </s>
