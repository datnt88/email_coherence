<s> I re-read my mail from yesterday, and realized that I never defined 'cache-busting'.  </s>
<s> Here's an attempt: cache busting: any of a variety of techniques employed by origin servers to prevent an intermediate cache from supplying the same data twice (to the same or different users) merely for the purpose of gathering accurate 'hit' data.  </s>
