I re-read my mail from yesterday, and realized that I never defined 'cache-busting'. 
Here's an attempt: cache busting: any of a variety of techniques employed by origin servers to prevent an intermediate cache from supplying the same data twice (to the same or different users) merely for the purpose of gathering accurate 'hit' data. 
Cache-busting reduces the value of the techniques the HTTP working group is developing to make caching in the Internet more effective, which might in turn result in greater efficiency of the network and more responsive Internet access, especially across saturated trans-ocean internet links.
