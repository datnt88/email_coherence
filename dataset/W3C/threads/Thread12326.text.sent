Hi there, I'm a simple ordinary run of the mill web searcher. 
I'm sure that people who know all the jargon understand what you mean but if I have to plough my way through all the various pieces I'm going to get disheartened and give up. 
I'd like a simple easy to follow version of what to do and what to use (and what it does) to enable me to make my website user friendly to all disabled people.

Everything is simple. 
Nothing is easy. 
The delusion that most authoring tools provide is that you can just mock up a site and put it through a magic scanner that converts it not only to the arcane language of the Web, but makes it accessible. 
This just isn't so. 
As you do more of this stuff, just as when you first started to use a computer then a word processor, then the internet, etc. the process is one of learning and growth in which you begin befuddled (by acronymic jargon) and become consulted by others who are starting up the path you've taken. 
As consumers you represent ask authoring tool vendors to provide ever more accessibility using their products, the efforts of the developers will begin (already have) showing up on the market. 
Meanwhile just keep chasing links to arcane issues like HTML, CSS, XML, RDF, DOM, Dublin Core, etc. persistently and joyfully. 
The brain aerobics alone will make it worth your while. 
Love. 
ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE Nicki, the group you should probably contact is the Education and Outreach group - looking for. 
In particular I would suggest the following resources: The WAI QuickTips - http://www.w3.org/WAI/References/QuickTips 10 quick reminders of what to do to make your website accessible. 
They fit in a business card, and are available in a number of different formats and languages. 
This would be my number one stop. 
The WAI getting started page - http://www.w3.org/WAI/gettingstarted 
This provides more links to the things ytou might be looking for. 
The evaluation and repair tools group's list of exising tools - This provideslinks and some description for a number of tools useful in checking the accessibility of content and helping you to repair it, both as an author and as a user. 
The authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines Working group's list of tool reviews - http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/reviews 
At the moment this page is embryonic, but it provides reviews or partial reviews of tools against the Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines. 
(Unfortunately we haven't found any that currently meet the guidelines - you will have to decide based on your own needs which is the most helpful for you). 
A couple of tools that have come out claiming to have accessibility as a priority: HotMetal 5 was released some time ago. 
I believe that the same features are available in HotMetal 6. 
There is a review of HotMetal 5 on the reviews page mentioned above. 
HotDog 6 (from sausage software - http://www.sausage.com ) was released recently and includes accessibilty checking and help documentation on producing accesible content. 
I am sure there are others, and there are tools that are good for accessibility but may not make large claims about it. 
To some extent it depends on what you want the too lto help you doing and what you are happy to do for yourself (for example do you want a WYSIWYG editor or a source-code editor, and many other choices) Hope this is helpful. 
Please also bug the developers of your favourite software to provide more accessibility support - market pressure is what drives most software companies.
