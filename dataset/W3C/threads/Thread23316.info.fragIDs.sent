<s> There is an inconsistant behavior in how the 2 major DOM implementations  </s>
<s> (IE/Mozilla) treat cases in ID attributes when referencing elements with  </s>
<s> getElementById.  </s>
<s> Consider the following example: alert( document.getElementById("crapper").innerHTML ); IE will disregard cases and display "first", while Mozilla will honor cases and display "second".  </s>
<s> The DOM Level 1 recommendation is not clear about which to use.  </s>
<s> DOM Level 1: getElementById(elementId) This method returns a Element.  </s>
<s> The elementId parameter is of type DOMString.  </s>
<s> DOM Level 1 2nd Ed.: getElementById(elementId) This method returns a Element object.  </s>
<s> The elementId parameter is of type String.  </s>
<s> To settle any doubts I ask: Which behavior is correct?  </s>

<s> IDs are case-sensitive in HTML.  </s>
<s> Therefore "crapper" and "crappeR" are different IDs that could belong to different elements.  </s>
