Hugely snipped from quoted message. 
I snipped at the bottom too. 
Questions have been raised about America Online's (AOL's) recently announced Focused Beta Test for accessibility. 
Some people have asked about the National Federation of the Blind's position regarding this test in light of the Federation's lawsuit filed against AOL in November of 1999. 
Others have asked why, as beta test participants, they have to give AOL personal information such as credit card numbers, mailing addresses, etc. 
Let me begin by updating you about the status of the Federation's lawsuit against AOL. 
In late July of last year, we agreed to withdraw the suit after receiving assurances from AOL of its commitment to improve the accessibility of its Windows client software (AOL 5.0 at the time). 
When AOL 6.0 was released in the fall of 2000, some marginal accessibility improvements were in fact included in the software--in particular, improvements in the ease of installation and in the use of email. 
However, it was clearly understood that AOL needed more time to complete its work. 
The Federation reserved the right to file another lawsuit against AOL after one year if, in its judgment, sufficient progress had not been made toward making the AOL client accessible to the blind snipped: AOL is now calling for testers to participate in what it calls a Focus Beta Test for Accessibility. 
To quote AOL, "The Focused Beta Test for accessibility is a call to Assistive Technology users to report on their AOL experience using Assistive Technologies such as screen readers, screen magnifiers, voice recognition, speech output, and alternatives to the standard keyboards and mouses." 
Some people might argue that beta testing software that is known not to work well with assistive technology in effect places the cart before the horse. 
The reality is that without this beta testing and active participation from users of assistive technology, AOL will not be able to take the positive steps it must take to ensure that the next version of its client software will work for us as well as it should. 
AOL needs to receive concrete and widespread verification that either it is or is not doing the right thing in terms of making the next version of its client software accessible to everyone. 
Anyone wanting to participate in the AOL Focused Beta Test for Accessibility needs to sign up as an AOL member; this requirement is true for anyone beta testing AOL software, issues of accessibility notwithstanding. 
However, once a person signs up for the beta test process, all membership fees are waived. 
In other words, other than your time, there is no cost to you to participate in AOL's focused beta test for accessibility. 
Once you have finished doing what testing you feel inclined to do, you can cancel your AOL membership. 
hey are we querying the whole scientific premis here, or not?

Does anyone know why AOL is apparently? 
choosing to do its accessibility test without paying anyone?

1. They're cheapskates. 
2. They've been sued by the NFB over accessibility issues. 
It may be they know it's going to come out bad, and don't want to attract the attention of the NFB. 
if they pay for beta testing, it can be construed that they payed for the results. 
Many companies do not pay for beta testing.

Good point, David. 
Forgot about that. 
Hi David I am missing the point. 
Why is it not a good thing to pay to get a product beta tested, in terms of how the results are perceived?

Paying a third party to beta test a product hardly guarantees it's independency, however it is a recognised and acceptable alternative that supposedly avoids compromising the integrity of the tests.

Many companies do not pay for beta testing. 
I'm also querying this, as I don't follow its meaning. 
jonathan chetwynd IT teacher (LDD) j.chetwynd@btinternet.com 
it could say that more than the test was purchased unless it is clearly spelled out in the agreement and that agreement is public. 
It is sort of like advertising for instance. 
I pay you to lie.

directory on the web" 
but when the "testers" are forced to subscribe to a service (run by the test creators) to be able to test the product they are then going to try to sell you seems a bit "catch 22"ish. 
They should get good results because those that can already use the service are likely to be those who take the beta test and those who can't will not even access the test to take it. 
(does this make sense??) sort of assures good results!

there is some truth in catch22, however there is little point in giving visual tests to blind users... 
luckily I've never experienced aol, sorry if I'm supporting something really offensive like pol pot. 
I expect my site to work for my clients,, and see little point in including one or two in some standard test, as the results will obviously be swamped.... jonathan chetwynd IT teacher (LDD) j.chetwynd@btinternet.com on the web"

Perhaps. 
However, the critical point is that doing an accessibility test with able-bodied personnel is inherently fatally flawed. 
The way I look at this, as bitter as I am: 99.99999% of normals (able-bodied people) will never have a clue about the needs of the disabled. 
They won't care, either. 
In fact, they will typically be rather hostile to the idea of doing ANYTHING to help the disabled (anyone remember how long it took to get ADA passed? 
IIRC, it took something like 10 to 20 YEARS.), with maybe every millionth person actually giving a damn. 
Everyone else will fake it so they don't look bigoted, and think the disabled (especially the blind) can't tell when they're lying. 
So why the HELL is AOL using them for a test designed more for, well, us? 
It's blind kids that were able to break through the phone system way back when (remember the story of Joe Engressias? 
Phreaker of legend, who happened to be blind), before any normal kid ever tried. 
Never mind that they couldn't see the circuitry. 
Ma Bell was freaking out, cuz Ma Bell lost umpteen millions to bored blind kids with nothing else to do, and fiddling with the phone system as a hobby for lack of anything better! 
If we can do that, if we can screw around with phone systems and high-voltage circuitry and create legends in the process, WHY THE HELL do you think we can't do something like an accessibility test, AOL? 
We're the ones who have to suffer when you screw up cuz you never asked us! 
More calmly...If it was JUST using able-bodied people, I wouldn't mind AS MUCH. 
But using normals and PAYING them to test? 
That's beyond cheap. 
That's beyond fishy. 
That's beyond lying. 
That's insulting! 
Use the disabled! 
PAY US TOO DAMMIT! 
deep breath Now, I was looking at this kind of sarcastically. 
Everything in there, however, is actually my opinion. 
I'm just using humor to keep myself sane. 
In the case of the blind phone phreakers...Head over to Kwazaa, and download a copy of the Anarchists Cookbook 2000. 
I think there was an Esquire article on it years ago, too.
