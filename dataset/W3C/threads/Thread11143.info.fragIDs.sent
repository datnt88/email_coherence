Should we define terms for links that are colocated with their ends, and if so, should we use in-line and out-of-line? 
No. I find "out-of-line" much less suggestive of the nature of the link that the existing HyTime term "independent". 
I think using the term "in-line" is going to be confusing when we get to the style stage, since the term "in-line" is used very heavily in formatting (at least in DSSSL). 
I am not very keen on the term "contextual" either. 
Since the "in-line" links are the kind of links that most people are currently used to, may be they could be called something like "simple", "normal" or "basic".

I also had much trouble with these terms. 
I believe that what is called here "in-line" and in HyTime "contextual" are 
links that share a number of characteristics: 
1. located at the (start) link end 2. uni-directional 3. hardwired Choosing 1. -- co-location -- as the basis for naming is confusing for the reason James cites and also obscures the other characteristics which identify this type of link. 
I can't think of a single name that will evoke 
all three characteristics and I agree that "simple", "normal" or "basic", which require definition, are an improvement on "in-line". 
"Out-of-line" sounds like scolding and emphasizes the location of the link look-up table, which is much less relevant than the fact that there is a look-up of some sort. 
"Simple" and "independent" are somewhat descriptive and are explainable. 
Is there a reason why we can't just call these "direct" and "indirect" links? 
This also keys on just one of the three characteristics of this type of link, but if 1. a direct link is always located at its start link end 
2. a direct link is always uni-directional 3. a direct link is by definition hardwired 
then, I think we should call it a direct link because unlike co-lation or uni-directionality, it does imply the other two characteristics. 
There may be some very obvious reasons that "direct" and "indirect" are non-starters, but they sure would speak well to both technical and non-technical audiences.

Yes. 
There can be a lookup in either case. 
Yes. Basic may be better. 
Simple makes people think it isn't powerful. 
Yes. A clink can point to a location ladder. 
Direct and indirect are not actually descriptive of functionality. 
Inline and out-of-line are just descriptive of storage location. 
Neither has much descriptive power. 
Context and independent don't have very much, but they are in current use and used correctly. 
They are also standard. 
The XML specification is just a set of recommendations that COULD be standardized. 
It will be simpler to achieve this later process if standard terms are used. 
Durand argues against 'de novo' terms, but for a pre-standard practice, all terms are de novo. 
Better to use the standard. 
Define "hardwired". 
Is the a href="somefunction here" being generated by a server side script "hardwired"? 
Call them George if you like. 
The average user tries them once, and then uses that "experience" to identify functionality. 
Stick with the standard terms already in use in the larger SGML community. 
What is being suggested now is guaranteed to perpetuate confusion and even more factionalization.

[Liora Alschuler:] 
I agree with Liora. 
These work very well intuitively and are about as apropos as anything else that's been suggested. 
Jon 
They are functional labels and do not indicate function. 
So, no, not intuitive. 
Why not use independent link and context link? 
They are standard and a large segment of the SGML community recognizes them?
