Dear Mr. Berners-Lee, Recently there has been some discussion about the Semantic Web, amongst Web developers. 
The problem is that although your initial ideas, for example in "Weaving the Web" are well grounded and very interesting, there is still no real outline of "The Semantic Web" on the WWW, other than your 'Design Issues' series of notes. 
I think it would greatly help us if you would issue a little more material on this, or at least start discussions on semantic-web@w3.org (to which this mail is CC'd). 
Maybe then, some of the 'interested developers' could start publishing our own material and thoughts on the subject, which is mainly about where the WWW comes from, and where it's heading... 
As I see it, we are talking about a fully machine processable Web environment; but one that is self-describing, easily searchable, and ultimately dynamic. 
Hopefully I am somewhere close to the mark here with this outline, but a more official word would be greatly appreciated.

Sean May I suggest the following: (some of them you may have already read) 1. http://www.w3.org/2000/01/sw/DevelopmentProposal 2. http://www.cs.vu.nl/%7Edieter/ftp/spool/silverbullet.pdf 
And of course: http://semanticweb.org 
Also Stanford KNOWs (Knowledge on the Web is) pretty good.

And my suggest my humble collection Hope this helps Abir Abir Qasem 1-800-222-6000 ext: javaemp Web in no this _____NetZero Free Internet Access and Email______ Ye Hi Abir, Thank you for the links. 
Actually, quite a few people have sent me links (thanks!), but I must admit, none of them in my opinion provide a simple generic introducion to the Semantic Web. 
I would still like to hear what Mr. Berners-Lee, and the people working with RDF have to say, further to what I have already recieved. 
Once again, thanks for the information everyone, keep it coming.
