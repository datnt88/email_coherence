<s> Hi, RFC2616 says:  </s>
<s> 4.2 Message Headers Multiple message-header fields with the same field-name MAY be present in a message if and only if the entire field-value for that header field is defined as a comma-separated list [i.e., #(values)].  </s>
<s> It MUST be possible to combine the multiple header fields into one "field-name: field-value" pair, without changing the semantics of the message, by appending each subsequent field-value to the first, each separated by a comma.  </s>
<s> The order in which header fields with the same field-name are received is therefore significant to the interpretation of the combined field value, and thus a proxy MUST NOT change the order of these field values when a message is forwarded.  </s>
<s> I'm building a HTTP UserAgent with PHP and now i'm dealing with this multiple message-header fields.  </s>
<s> If my UserAgent receives such multiple fields, should it combine these fields into one or should it keep the multiple fields and send it to the server (if present in a request)?  </s>
<s> The problem behind this is the storage of this header fields.  </s>
<s> Currently i have an associative array that does something like  </s>
<s> Accept = array(text/html, image/*) if there was Accept: text/html Accept: image/* but when someone wants the value of Accept i only want to return a string and therefor i only return the first value i.e. text/html which does not meet someones expactation.  </s>

<s> Combining multiple header fields works just fine, with one exception: the Set-Cookie header field.  </s>
<s> Some browsers don't handle multiple cookies in a Set-Cookie header field (i.e. they require a separate header field for each cookie to be set).  </s>
<s> Furthermore, because a number of sites use broken cookies  </s>
<s> which contain commas in the value, parsing a combined Set-Cookie header field can be a little tricky.  </s>
