<s> What was the rationale behind having the createAttribute() factory method in Document instead of Element?  </s>
<s> Since Attrs can only be set on Elements,  </s>
<s> wouldn't it make more sense to have the factory method in Element?  </s>
<s> S.  </s>
<s> Weak rationalle: An Attr, like most other nodes, is always associated with an owning document.  </s>
<s> It isn't associated with an Element until it's bound to one via setAttributeNode[NS].  </s>
<s> There is one: the setAttribute() call.  </s>
<s> More convenient if the Attr's value will be a single Text node, less convenient if it will be more complicated.  </s>

<s> And even then, it can be removed from that element and attached to another.  </s>
<s> Creating the Attr node from an element would seem to imply it can only be used with this one element.  </s>
<s> Which the WG has decided not to be the case.  </s>
