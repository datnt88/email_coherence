<s> [resent after bounce on first attempt] I don't believe that leaving the choice of schemes to the browser creates any problems that are not there anyway, so I propose the following replacement for 4.6 (I could not find any other section that had any text on this - please point it out if I missed it).  </s>
<s> The first paragraph is changed to remove the semantics associated with the offered order, and to add some normative language about not sending replayable credentials.  </s>
<s> The second is unchanged except for striking the last sentence.  </s>
<s> 4.6 Weakness Created by Multiple Authentication Schemes An HTTP/1.1 server MAY return multiple challenges with a 401 (Unauthorized) response, and each challenge MAY use a different scheme.  </s>
<s> The user is free to choose from among the offered challenges  </s>
<s> it understands and request credentials from the user based upon that challenge.  </s>
<s> The user agent SHOULD choose the scheme it considers to be most secure; the Basic scheme, or any other scheme which transmits credentials in a way that allows for replay of those credentials, SHOULD NOT be used if there is an alternative available.  </s>
<s> When the server offers choices of authentication schemes using the WWW- Authenticate header, the strength of the resulting authentication is only as good as that of the of the weakest of the authentication schemes.  </s>
<s> See section 4.8 below for discussion of particular attack scenarios which exploit multiple authentication schemes.  </s>

<s> ^^^^^^ client or user-agent but not user  </s>
<s> If I were a server owner, I would be very inclined to examine the HTTP user-agent field and not offer multiple choices but rather the best choice known to be supported by the UA.  </s>
<s> I wonder if some or all of the following or other implementations suggestions should be documented: 1. Tell the end user what the authentication scheme is ... 2. Provide a user-agent configuration option to allow the user to refuse authentication using basic  </s>
<s> 3. Provide server owners with the ability to restrict basic usage to UAs based on UA identity .. perhaps not much better in MIM case but it would insure that a UA which could use digest would use it.  </s>
<s> 4. Provide applications with the ability to differentiate the level of access based on authentication type.  </s>
<s> Read via basic but create/update only by digest or better.  </s>
<s> Dave Morris  </s>
<s> In 4.8 we have: User agents should consider measures such as presenting a visual indication at the time of the credentials request of what authentication scheme is to be used, or remembering the strongest authentication scheme ever requested by a server and produce a warning message before using a weaker one.  </s>
<s> It might also be a good idea for the user agent to be configured to demand Digest authentication in general, or from specific sites.  </s>
<s> The standard does not say anything now about what criteria may be used by the server to choose the offered schemes, and to my way of thinking that allows for any criteria at all, including UA identity (personally, keeping up with what browsers send for identity is way too much trouble for me).  </s>
<s> Again, I don't think that there is anything in the spec that forbids such a thing, and it is therefor allowed (and, I think, is a good idea).  </s>

<s> good morning, In a previous episode Scott Lawrence said... :: I don't believe that leaving the choice of schemes to the browser creates :: any problems that are not there anyway, so I propose the following that's a key point.. in the end the browser needs to make the decision of whether or not sending their credentials onto the wire is within their security policy.  </s>
<s> :: 4.6 Weakness Created by Multiple Authentication Schemes :: An HTTP/1.1 server MAY return multiple challenges with a 401 :: (Unauthorized) response, and each challenge MAY use a different :: scheme.  </s>

<s> I'd scratch the last portion of that ("; the Basic scheme, ...") as being redundant.  </s>
<s> related point: It's important to me to keep UA based decisions out of the spec.  </s>
<s> They're messy, non-scalable, and inevitably become historical cruft you can never quite get rid of.  </s>
<s> I've currently only got one in (Content-Encodings with respect to some unix versions of netscape) this codebase, and would like to keep it that way.  </s>
<s> The above proposed change satisfies my need while allowing an auth upgrade path for clients.  </s>
