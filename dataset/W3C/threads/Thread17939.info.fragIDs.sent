<s> The following is a proposed set of configurable single stroke functions.  </s>
<s> For background information read my post of June 9th.  </s>
<s> I won't be able to make the call this week.  </s>
<s> I'll be at RESNA.  </s>
<s> I proposed that we require a minimum set of single stroke commands but that we also include in the techniques other commands that may be useful as single stroke commands.  </s>
<s> I am not convinced that this is the best list but  </s>
<s> it is a starting point.  </s>
<s> I propose the following minimum set of commands be accessible with a single keystroke or that the user be able to configure those as single stroke commands those items on this list.  </s>
<s> 1. next link 2. previous link  </s>
<s> 3. next structural element(s) - (Should each structural element, eg. table, form, list, get its own keystroke.)  </s>
<s> 4. back 5. forward 6. refresh 7. page up 8. page down 9. line up (arrows) 10 line down (arrows)  </s>
<s> 11. next active element  </s>
<s> 12. stop loading  </s>
<s> Other useful commands that may be candidates for single stroke assignment 13. to address bar / open location  </s>
<s> 14. next viewports 15. load/unload graphics 16. increase font size 17.  </s>
<s> decrease font size  </s>
<s> 18. page search  </s>
<s> 19. add to bookmark 20. go to bookmark list 21. go to history list 22. navigate among all Elements  </s>
<s> 23. turn on/off colors/style/sheets 24.  </s>
<s> help - for conventions sake, I think this should stay at F1 Another questions is whether we need a different set of single keystroke commands for media players?  </s>
<s> (e.g. stop, start, pause, volume)  </s>
<s> Link is not in the UAAG glossary.  </s>
<s> By these I presume you mean the subset of active elements that in some browsers is navigated through without activation by tab or shift-tab  </s>
<s> Note that other structural elements can occur (nested, or recursively) within table, form, list.  </s>
<s> So going forward or back from the next specific kind of structural element depends on its containing structural element.  </s>
<s> In anticipation of XML applications, the list of such element types is open-ended.  </s>
<s> That suggests that a user style sheet be able to select which among the element types should get keystroke mapping.  </s>
<s> I expect that DOM navigation provides adequate capability here that we should leave to it the tools that allow DOM wanderings through hierarchy and siblings.  </s>
<s> In a table, keypair-augmented up/down arrows might be interpreted as prior/next row, and augmented left/right arrows as prior/next cell.  </s>
<s> In a FORM, are some elements more equal than others?  </s>
<s> Does the type text attribute value of the INPUT element type have special needs?  </s>
<s> one of "(TEXT | PASSWORD | CHECKBOX | RADIO | SUBMIT | RESET | FILE | HIDDEN | IMAGE | BUTTON)" used to specify the kind of widget is needed (and hence possibly different means of local navigation.  </s>
<s> How is non-visual accommodation made?)  </s>
<s> Combine with next/prior link?  </s>
<s> (or do you mean links as targets, whereas active elements contain hrefs?  </s>
<s> This should work in conjunction with some loading progress indicator?  </s>
<s> Do we have a means to edit that address bar?  </s>
<s> to query its content?  </s>
<s> I prefer this, as implemented in NSN, to the limited choices of MSIE.  </s>
<s> I believe it should affect font size of tooltips as well.  </s>
<s> Do you mean, search for string in current page, or search for page containing some pattern, from some domain of pages?  </s>
<s> Where do we indicate we expect to be able to have DOM-based navigation?  </s>
<s> And attribute query therein?  </s>
<s> I would add means to select a particular track or step to prior/next track.  </s>
<s> Also I would add means to fast forward and fast reverse (or go to particular time within track.) [I'm currently trying to memorize some music as sung on a CD, and those are the most important controls I use.  </s>
<s> Audio Station 32 makes this quite convenient, with track selection or stepping to prior or next.  </s>
<s> During track play a display shows current time position from the start of the current track.  </s>
<s> A linear slider shows position within the track.  </s>
<s> Its adjustment stops play to allow fast-slews to the desired time, shown on the display.  </s>
<s> Bookmarks to such starting positions mid-track would also be useful.]  </s>
<s> Regards/Harvey  </s>
<s> Harvey a more update set of functions was posted to the list on 11 July: Could you recheck you concerns with this posting.  </s>
<s> It was agreed on the 13 July to use this list as the minimum set of functions.  </s>
