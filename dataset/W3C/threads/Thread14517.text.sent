Thoughts on http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20/WD-WCAG20-20001121.html 1. 
When you do GL{2}, CPs {2.2} and {2.3} could be swapped round. 
Markup, markup, style. 
2. Don't forget to include "However, ensure that the structural and semantic distinctions are captured in the markup (checkpoint 2.3). 
" in {2.3} itself! 
3. Are the techs. 
going to be built at the same time, for examples? 
It is going to be difficult for people to know what we are talking about with WCAG 2.0, no matter how well written examples are always vital. 
Of course writing techniques for WCAG 2.0 is going to be very difficult in itself... 4. Possibly create a separate summary list of guidelines for ease of visibility (to put forward the basic concepts). 
I.e. a list of the 6 Guidlines. 
5. Change:- [...] body xml:lang="en" lang="en" to the following:- html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="US-en" lang="US-en" [...] body in the source code of the document (excuse my pickiness, I don't like looking at the word "color", it always looks misspelt to me!). 6. 
The source of {3.4} should be changed from [...]in XHTML use the Hn elements[...] to [...]in XHTML use the h var title="1 to 6" n /var elements[...] I almost missed that one! 
(Once again I'm being a bit picky, but it would be ironic if the Accessibility Guidlines document didn't follow its own content! 
I really wished that the XHTML 1.0 spec. 
wasn't valid XHTML...) 7. This bit is quite funny (in both contexts of the word): {3} "Note: this guideline is applicable only in circumstances in which the web content is intended to be presented to a human reader. 
A structured data base or collection of metadata, in circumstances where the user interface is supplied entirely by the client application, lies outside the scope of this guideline." 
I thought accessibility implied human accessibility, and that we were only concerned with UI technologies? 
Even databases need UI outputs...this piece of text implies that there should be accessibility guidelines for the Semantic Web (a scary thought - we shouldn't need them!) In other words, if there is no need for accessibility in metadata, then you can edit that bit out entirely. 
In it's place could be a summary of the three checkpoints. 
8. Here some outlines for possible strawman definitions: - Content The full markup and data within a document, providing the documents logical structure. 
- Markup SGML tags and attributes. 
- Presentation The rendering style applied to markup. 
- Semantics =meaning. 
Semantic markup is markup with meaning. 
9. I like the way that {3.2} now sums up the discussion between Anne and myself:- "If the default presentation of the structured content does not meet the needs of your audience use graphics, colors, sounds, etc. to emphasize the structure. 
For example, section headings may appear in a different color and spoken in a different voice than the rest of the text. 
However, ensure that the structural and semantic distinctions are captured in the markup (checkpoint 2.3)." 
But don't forget to mention that the presentation itself can/should be based on the structural and semantic distinctions within the markup. 
I'm sure Anne will agree on that *as long as* the section about using graphics etc. for people with cognitive disabilities *remains* in the text. 
10. !important! - Include a checkpoint about adding metadata to describe regular data.

How well is "US-en" vs "en" supported in the assistive technology? 
(Anyone?) 
I'm not convinced that this replacement is valid. 
A better formulation would be to state: "Use the H1 to H6 elements". 
Kynn Bartlett kynn@idyllmtn.com 
Or "Use the h1 to h6 elements", yes. 
What should var be used for then? 
Kindest Regards, Sean B. Palmer "Perhaps, but let's not get bogged down in semantics."

Hmmm. 
I reckon that the proposed use is probably valid, according to the specification. 
I think something like "Use the HTML heading elements code h1 /code , code h2 /code , ..." is better english expression. 
I would try to keep the use of variables to examples of program code, mathematics, and so on.

And I don't know, but since I know that there are speech synthesisers out there that have english and american voices, I would guess that the support is as for other language switching - unfortunately very low. 
For those who don't think this is a problem, try working with a french system that comes across some english content... Charles How well is "US-en" vs "en" supported in the assistive technology?

In a lot of cases this means text, but text isn't always appropriate, there is no known way to write a number of signed languages in text, and metadata can be used to provide information that can be presented in different output modes the same way that text can (but with wider possiblities).

Charles Thoughts on http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20/WD-WCAG20-20001121.html 4. Possibly create a separate summary list of guidelines for ease of visibility (to put forward the basic concepts).

Yes, that's what I thought too! 
With respect, the language of a document is a property of the document, irrespective of whether any clients "support" it today. 
Marking it up does no harm to any application that does not support it. 
If one doesn't encourage authors to use "advanced" features of the markup language, how can we ever motivate developers of client software to implement support for those features? 
Here's the only, minor, "gotcha" that I'm aware of in language support: it's in the area of language negotiation. 
If a reader configures their client to request, say, en-US, and an author marks up a document as, say, en-GB then the negotiation will fail, asserting that the document is "not acceptable". 
Users need to be helped to realise that they're expected to include also an unqualified "en" in their list of acceptable languages if they are willing to be sent other versions of English. 
It's at least arguable that the client dialog should assume that a request to configure "en-US" should imply "en-US, en", if "en" isn't already in their acceptance list, otherwise many users find the correct behaviour counter-intuitive, despite the fact that it's perfectly logical when you think it through. 
It would actually be a violation of protocol for a server to send an en-GB document when the client said they only accept en-US. 
However, the server is allowed to send them a menu of available variant(s), even if the menu contains only one entry. 
best regards I'm not sure you are adding anything of substance, Sean. 
What are you trying to do or prevent? 
I'm not adding anything at all! 
It was/is already there in the guidelines (2{2.3}). 
I'm saying that as the part about "distinguish structural and semantic distinctions within the text" has been removed from the main {2} and added to the foot of {3.2}, it needs adding into {2.3} where it links back to. 
On the wider scale, I'm saying that the explanation for {3.2} is an excellent compromise between our two points of view, and needs reinforcing to some degree, i.e. the casual user looks at it and asks themselves: "why do we need to add in presentation for cognitively disabled users, and why do we need to distinguish structural and smeantic distinctions?". 
We (the GL WG) need to explain, explain, and explain again, and then provide useful examples. 
This is not a clash of ideas, or a contrast of opinions, but rather two paths towards a common goal.

[sent to the right place at last] Not sure. 
Having a list of links isn't really akin to a summary, but it's not a bad alternative (Well, we'd need them both, so it might be a waste of space anyway). 
Oops, my mistake. 
Does this mean the document shouldn't be referred to as en-US rather than just en? 
There's no harm specifiying the exact language used, but I agree that not much software takes note of it. 
i.e. may as well include it for forwards compatability. 
SBP: 10. !important! - Include a checkpoint about adding metadata to describe regular data. 
My idea was something a bit similar to what ERT is doing: metadata to describe accessibility aspects of a document - but that doesn't stop us from specifying many accessibiliy checkpoints for metadata (e.g. your suggestion about alternative content). 
Yes. 
Let me clarify that for people unsure of the particulars:- "VAR: Indicates an instance of a variable or program argument." - I would have hoped for a longer explaination, but there you go. 
"CODE: Designates a fragment of computer code. 
" - c. ibid. 
It was a bit picky of me to point it out in the first place, and it depends on what level we need to go to. 
If we really went for it, you could put:- "Use the XHTML heading elements dfn code title="XHTML Level 1 Heading code" h1 /code to code title="XHTML Level 6 Heading code" h6 /code /dfn , (Added titles and dfn because it is a definition of the XHTML heading elements), but that would be going over the top! 
Another point to raise in a similar vein is the correct useage of acronym and abbr , c.f. discussions on WAI IG and www-html, but this is all just me being pedantic ;-) Kindest Regards, Sean B. Palmer "Perhaps, but let's not get bogged down in semantics."

Enabling Support Foundation In this context, I'd say not much. 
Obviously, according to spec, var should be used for "an instance of a variable or program argument."

Guideline 2 has yet to be re-written per Wendy's note, but 2.3 is cross-referenced in the re-written 3.2. 
Why add the wording? 
Repeating it here would just make the guidelines overly wordy. 
"why do we need to add in presentation for cognitively disabled users ..." Because they are disabled persons who need the content of the web presented in their modality! 
Just as you do.
