<s> Just to add to this posting, it also causes amaya to stop responding when I view the file online.  </s>
<s> Also Amaya still appears to have major problems with complex table like that one, virtually all the other pages at my sight have work great, but they use simpler tables.  </s>
<s> As a side note I plan to redesign that page in the near future, but you might still want to look into that problem and the rendering of complex tables for the people making pages with weird table layouts.  </s>
<s> Keep up the great work all.  </s>

<s> Hi,  </s>
<s> Could not download with Amaya either.  </s>
<s> Once the document downloaded via Netscape Navigator, I opened it from as local file: got the same behaviour and error message.  </s>
<s> Config : Amaya Linux binary 3.0 - Mandrake 6.1 Cheers, Serge Torres  </s>
<s> My mistake: when I saw there were so many I didn't look any further to see what they were.  </s>
<s> Still, it seemed rather large.  </s>
<s> I would suggest that, if possible, a smaller document be derived from it to replicate the error.  </s>
<s> The Amaya team is very small, and I'm sure they would welcome a small test case.  </s>
<s> Anyway, I apologise for shooting from the hip.  </s>
<s> Many times people have used invalid docs as justification for some feature to be added, so sorry for tarring you with that particular brush.  </s>

<s> Hugh, it may be the size of the document that causes the problem.  </s>
<s> Here is another large document:  </s>
<s> This one loads OK.  </s>
<s> Since I wrote this one I am sure it will not pass an English Language validator.  </s>

<s> Sorry, Jim, this document contains HTML errors.  </s>
<s> I just checked the very beginning of and the W3C validator (http://validator.w3.org/) reported 13 errors in the first 63 lines (see below).  </s>
<s> There are also some MathML errors.  </s>
<s> I was not able to check everything, but the expression starting line 3704, for instance, is wrong: The mtr tag starting the line above is not allowed in this context.  </s>
<s> It is allowed only as a child of a mtable , not as a child of a mtd .  </s>
<s> All I would not say that TtM produces good HTML (or good MathML).  </s>
