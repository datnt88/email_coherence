<s> 1. 'Accessible,' doesn't mean what we think.  </s>
<s> In the first instance, one has to realize that when this page talks 'accessible' it is using the word in its common sense - "readily grasped" and not the code meaning we use the term for - "usable by people with disabilities".  </s>
<s> The good news is that anyone knew the second meaning well enough to submit this page to the gripe collection.  </s>
<s> As an advocacy community we should get used to the fact that we will never own the first meaning of the term 'accessible' and that we will always have to explain our terms before we use it by itself to mean "by people with disabilities."  </s>
<s> Forever.  </s>
<s> Get over it.  </s>
<s> 2. This page is inaccessible by any definition.  </s>
<s> The irony here is that even taking Zylex on their own terms, they don't get it.  </s>
<s> Zylex are hoisted on their own petard.  </s>
<s> What they do belies what they say.  </s>
<s> Immediately on load, without reading anything or navigating anywhere.  </s>
<s> You get the -NOT before the claim.  </s>
<s> They talk the talk of effective web design, but even as they talk they can't seem to get it together to put their own message across.  </s>
<s> The main title of this page, "Accessible Web Design," is quite illegible because of the 'arty' use of the white text in a funky font overlaid on a strongly busy image.  </s>
<s> Theory 1, Practice 0. Zylex are all briefed up on the buzzwords: "recognition vs. recall" etc; but they don't understand the nuts and bolts of usable graphic communication.  </s>
<s> The slanty question marks on "Who are we?" and "Why Zylex?" jar the eye and break the flow of the composition.  </s>
<s> Even the central metaphor, the symbolic value of the grapes in the background, is broken.  </s>
<s> Accessible means readily grasped, but the view of the grapes is too close to the subject for one to feel they are readily grasped.  </s>
<s> It looks as though it would be hard to get your fingers around an individual grape in that mass, and likewise hard to get to a stem where you could pluck off a handfull.  </s>
<s> A cliche association of the concept 'grapes' supports the desired theme; but the actual visual experience presented doesn't.  </s>
<s> If you're not a groupie of conceptual art, you won't get the message.  </s>
<s> The overlay on this image exquisitely portrays the predicament of designers who have Heard the Word but haven't grasped it.  </s>
<s> Wry justice!  </s>

<s> Their "optimize the user experience" accessibility is on a par with their "for people with disabilities" accessibility -- missing when needed.  </s>
<s> But not in any entertaining way.  </s>

<s> Just for fun, I tried to validate theri page at the W3 validator, and received the following:  </s>
<s> Fatal Error: No DOCTYPE specified!  </s>
<s> I could not parse this document, because it does not include a DOCTYPE Declaration.  </s>
<s> A DOCTYPE Declaration is mandatory for most current markup languages and without such a declaration it is impossible to validate this document.  </s>
<s> I guess that it might not be accessible to alternative devices either... Al suggests (below) that accessible means "usable by people with disabilities".  </s>
<s> With all due respect, if we continue to try and sell that message we will never get ahead.  </s>
<s> Might I suggest instead that we say: "Accessible to any user regardless of  </s>
