This is a convenient moment in which to introduce some general comments regarding the future directions that can be taken in the WAI Formats and Protocols effort. 
If the WAI HC proposals are introduced into the HTML 4.0 specification without significant amendments, then I think the success criteria for the HTML review will have been met. 
CSS 2 will be of significant benefit in the development of a more accessible web, since its widespread adoption will discourage authors from abusing the HTML markup in ways that are detrimental to the creation of braille and audio representations of a document. 
Furthermore, the audio 
style sheet mechanism included in CSS 2 will significantly improve the quality of audio rendering, provided that it is widely implemented by the developers of assistive technology and audio-based user agents. 
My suggestions regarding the audio formatting of tables remain to be considered in detail. 
A means of controlling the rendering of ALT text (by 
associating audio or visual style properties with it) is also needed. 
Furthermore, the CSS 2 review should examine the question of whether further style properties are needed to enable user agents better to indicate the presence of a long description associated with a graphical resource (see the LONGDESC attribute proposed by the WAI for inclusion in HTML 4.0). 
Media types for braille and TTY terminal devices have been proposed to the HTML working group, but the associated style properties have not been defined. 
I agree with Al that braille devices and TTY terminals may be able to share some property definitions, but the analogy should not be taken too far. 
Item numbering, footnotes and end notes, and related concerns identified by the WAI have not as yet been addressed in CSS. 
More generally, I think there is an important strategic decision which the WAI Formats and Protocols Working Group will soon be obliged to make, namely, how far to push the development of CSS, or whether the needs of accessibility would better be served by concentrating principally on other style mechanisms, such as the XML style language, which will reputedly be based on DSSSL. 
The XML style language is not even at the draft stage, a 
fact which can be both an advantage, in that it may be possible for the WAI to influence its development at a very early stage, and a disadvantage, in that a final specification and a working implementation thereof is unlikely to be available in the near future. 
The ability to transform the structure of an HTML document by reorganising its elements is an important aspect of any style mechanism that can adequately meet the needs of braille and audio users. 
So far, there has been no indication of an intention to include such tree transformation properties in CSS, and as T.V. Raman has suggested, this may be a good 
reason for concentrating the WAI effort more on DSSSL and the forthcoming XML style language. 
More information is required from the CSS and XML working groups in order that the WAI can make an appropriate decision in this regard. 
XML accessibility is a problem which has so far not been given detailed treatment. 
Following the model of the ICADD mechanism, I would suggest that a means should be developed whereby the developers of XML DTD's can map them onto the HTML 4.0 DTD, or a subset thereof. 
Given that HTML will be widely implemented and that, if WAI enhancements are accepted, it will provide excellent accommodation for the needs of people with disabilities, it would be preferable to map XML elements to corresponding HTML markup than to rely on the now obsolete ICADD 22 DTD. 
I understand that George Kerscher is already working on this problem. 
As mentioned above, much effort needs to be devoted to the development of a braille style sheet system which is adequate for the conversion of HTML and XML documents into well formatted braille. 
Again, the direction which this work should take depends on the over-all approach to CSS and the XML style language which the Formats and Protocols Working Group adopts. 
HTML mathematics is another very important specification that warrants a detailed review, in order to ensure that braille and audio representations can be automatically generated from a well marked up mathematical document. 
The advantages of RDF as a linking mechanism need to be explored, especially in respect of phonetic and abbreviation dictionaries, descriptions of tables and images, etc. 
Finally, none of the foregoing projects is likely to achieve its full potential in practice unless an adequate interface, based for instance on the Document Object Model, between user agents and assistive technologies (such as braille and audio output software) is developed and implemented. 
Thus, it is vital that the Formats and Protocols working group develop a plan for addressing each of these issues, and that a sufficient number of experts, with relevant knowledge and insight, be brought together to carry out the various projects which such an effort necessitates. 
Indeed, this was one of the key motivations for starting the work on CSS. 
There are several XML style languages, including CSS and DSSSL. 
You're probably referring to XSL, the "eXtensible Style Language", which has proposed to W3C [1].

This has been true in the past; CSS is intended for documents where tree transformations are not required. 
However, another recent submission to W3C builds on CSS to provide "Simple Tree Transformation Sheets".

FWIW XSL (the style sheet side of XML) is available in draft, and one team in Edinburgh, have put an implemenation onto the web. 
This translates from XSL into DSSSL then uses an uplifted Jade to output in RTF. 
ps. Copies of XLL - linking mechanism SMML - multi-media language are in about to hit the streets for public comment.

Last week, I reviewed this submission briefly. 
Although it allows HTML elements to be renamed and class values to be added, I did not find any mention of properties that would permit defined sections of HTML documents to be moved to other locations within the hierarchical structure. 
For the purposes of accessibility, it is important to be able to move such components as navigation bars, tables, etc., to different points within the text. 
For example: could be the definition of a navigation bar which appears near the beginning of the page. 
Speech synthesizer users might prefer it to be presented at the end of the document, after the main text. 
The WAI guidelines would define a set of standard class names for navigation bars and other commonly occurring components of HTML documents, which could then be used by a tree transformation style sheet to manipulate the reading order of the text. 
The ultimate question will be whether CSS is likely to support such functionality or whether XSL or DSSSL should be used instead. 
In any case, if XSL proceeds, it will need to be reviewed by the Formats and Protocols Working Group.
