<s> [Quote from SKOS-Core guide:] "It is perfectly reasonable, however, to assign a concept a preferred label that is also an alternative label for some other concept."  </s>
<s> This is contrary to thesaurus practice and standards, and would cause problems.  </s>
<s> Labels should be unique, and are made so by the addition of a qualifier in parentheses if necessary.  </s>
<s> Leonard could you outline exactly the problems this would cause?  </s>
<s> Al.  </s>
<s> This is quite true of single controlled vocabularies.  </s>
<s> Having one label possibly provide two different concepts means you need to be careful to distinguish which one is being selected - generally implying an extra verification step in the interface.  </s>
<s> On the other hannd, in merging vocabularies, this is going to happen.  </s>
<s> It also allows us to explore the case where people's actual usage means that one label is used for two different concepts.  </s>
<s> Since people commnicate through labels (e.g. words) rather than concepts (e.g. telepathically transferring mental models), I think this is important in our goal of being able to use the thesaurus work for the real world.  </s>
<s> One intersting application, then, is to look up any concepts that do share a label, and work out if there is an optimisation that can be done to work around it - is the most helpful thing to offer the preferredLabel?  </s>
<s> A definition?  </s>
<s> Is it feasible to remove the label altogether, and force people to search using a different term?  </s>

<s> Labels should be unique, and are made so by the addition of a qualifier in parentheses if necessary.  </s>
<s> When you enter a vocabulary with a term, you don't know whether it is preferred or non-preferred.  </s>
<s> It should still lead you unambiguously to a single concept.  </s>
<s> This allows for automatic substitution of preferred terms for non-preferred terms when indexing or searching (or automatic linkage of documents to the appropriate concepts, if the actual terms are not used).  </s>
<s> If you use a term that is ambiguous, such as "seals", then there is normally an initial process of "disambiguation", which presents options from which the user has to choose, e.g. seals (closures) seals (mammals) USE Pinnepedia In this example the first of these is a preferred term and the second is a non-preferred term (or "alternative label" if you wish).  </s>
<s> If you look up "seals" in an alphabetical sequence the two entries above are immediately evident.  </s>
<s> If a machine is accessing the thesaurus, there may need to be some provision for it to match the term without the parenthetical qualifiers and take steps to determine which of the options is appropriate.  </s>
<s> This seems to be a separate step, though, and does not imply that the unqualified term is an alternative label for either of the concepts.  </s>
<s> Chaals raises the issue of merging different vocabularies.  </s>
<s> I think that that is a different issue and raises many other complications, but as he says the extra verification or disambiguation step that I have described above applies there too.  </s>
<s> As the present SKOS draft doesn't cover questions of mapping between vocabularies, I think we should keep it to what is necessary and desirable for a single vocabulary.  </s>

<s> Leonard has addressed this question very thoroughly, pointing out the confusion that can arise if any label (whether preflabel or altlabel) is non-unique.  </s>
<s> The argument is entirely contingent on the assumption that the KOS we are dealing with is a thesaurus, that is to say a vocabulary complying with ISO 2788 or ANSI/NISO Z39.19 or BS 5723.  </s>
<s> If this is the model, then the convention must be followed that every term, whether a preferred term or a non-preferred term, must be unique.  </s>
<s> However, the preamble to the SKOS document says, "SKOS-Core 1.0 is an RDF schema for representing thesauri and similar types of knowledge organisation system (KOS)".  </s>
<s> What do we mean by "similar types"?  </s>
<s> If a classification scheme is included, you move to a different model.  </s>
<s> For classification schemes, every concept has a unique notation.  </s>
<s> The concepts are generally known as 'classes'.  </s>
<s> Each class has a caption, and sometimes also a descriptive note.  </s>
<s> The captions do not have to be unique.  </s>
<s> For example, the meteorology schedule of the scheme could have a class ABC56, with caption Depression; at the same time the mental health schedule could have a class XYZ13, with caption Depression.  </s>
<s> Obviously these concepts are very different, but there is no confusion because the caption is never used to represent the concept.  </s>
<s> All this is leading up to a suggestion that it may be important to set out more background as to where and how the SKOS schema is intended to be used.  </s>
<s> If it is intended to apply to situations other than that of an ISO2788-compliant thesaurus, then these should be described, together with advice on how to deal with the features that differ from the ISO2788 model.  </s>
<s> In the short term, I would urge limiting the applicability of the schema to situations where terms may be used to represent concepts, and in this circumstance any term used to represent a concept should be unique.  </s>
<s> I also agree about the need to limit it to a single vocabulary.  </s>
<s> Once this simple basis is established, it may become possible in future to extend to more situations, but it is risky to try to move too fast to a very sophisticated model.  </s>
