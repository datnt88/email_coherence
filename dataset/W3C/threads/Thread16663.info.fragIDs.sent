<s> I agree in principle with everything you have said here Kynn but wouldn't it strengthen the business case as well as the Section 508 compliance pitch if we edited your response to read: "Hey, web design companies - if you write accessible HTML you can extend your client market to include xxxxxx people with disabilities as well as increase your prospects for securing government contracts !"  </s>

<s> Right...but how many companies are going to want to chase after the small  </s>
<s> number of people that are actually afflicted (for lack of a better word) with those disabilities, or severity thereof, that actually affect the use of the web?  </s>
<s> Take your point John.  </s>
<s> However it depends on which statistics you quote.  </s>
<s> I have seen conservative estimates of 10% of the population and also statistics estimating up to 40% if you take into account the "hidden disabilities".  </s>
<s> The other aspect to this is our aging population.  </s>
<s> Increasingly we hear of retired folk going online.  </s>
<s> Internet courses for the over '50s in Australia are hugely profitable - always sold out.  </s>
<s> We know in general companies are targeting consumer products to reach this population.  </s>
<s> We also know older people have a range of age-related problems, not the least being visual impairments.  </s>
<s> So I'd argue that this is most certainly not a "small number of people".  </s>
<s> Furthermore, nobody teaches accessible web design.  </s>
<s> No college student I know  </s>
<s> taking IT-related major with a web concentration has to learn accessible web design.  </s>
<s> And after college...why would the developers want to take the time learning something that after one or two projects is going to be useless?  </s>
<s> There are courses that teach accessible web design.  </s>
<s> I am enrolled in two concurrently - one run through the International Webmasters Association (Kynn is the instructor - free plug there Kynn) and the other run by EASI in conjunction with University of South Maine (conducted by Norman Coombs and Dick Banks who are well known to some of you).  </s>
<s> True these courses should be more readily available in all colleges and I hope that some day they will be part of the "stable" of courses offered all IT training providers.  </s>
<s> That will take some time but it will happen.  </s>
<s> Section 508 I think will drive that interest as more and more private companies build accessibility standards into their packages.  </s>
<s> This is already evident with Macromedia leading the field, Adobe, Blackboard and WebCT all following close behind.  </s>
<s> So to get a job with a major company in the future, IT graduates will need Web design skills that meet these standards.  </s>
<s> Furthermore, the authoring tools themselves are now providing accessibility checklists and auditing facilities to help designers as they develop their web sites.  </s>
<s> OK still a way to go - but things are moving  </s>
<s> in the right direction.  </s>

<s> out of curiousity, Denise: Why do you think that those companies (Macromedia, Adobe, etc.) will exist in 2-3 years?  </s>
<s> I have to admit that I am working on several Open Source projects, and I do (and will do!) my best to decrease power of those companies.  </s>
<s> So, I would not advise to students to learn something just to have possibility "to be hired by Macromedia, Adobe, Microsoft, etc." It amy be that those companies would not exist by the time they finish colledge or university ;-)) BTW: stocks of those companies are already moving into *right direction*.  </s>
