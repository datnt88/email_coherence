When using CSSStyleDeclaration.getPropertyValue() method you are returned the value as it is declared as a string. 
This is a very powerful method (in conjunction with getComputedStyle) but I feel it needs expanded. 
Has the W3C been looking into a way of requesting the style in specified units for those styles that take units. 
I will give an example. 
Lets say the style for the height of an element is 1.3em, but I want it in pixels or points. 
I would like to see a method of retrieving the style in different units than those in the declaration. 
Any ideas and/or comments on this? 
Has this been discussed before? 
Any chance that this may be included in the recomendation in the future?

________ (.' \) (.' -' ______ Ian, Yes, but the problem with this is that you cannot get the relative value (say "em") to another relative unit (say "px"). 
Most scripts deal with pixels. 
The spec is also not clear on if the unit is absolute can you convert it to relative using this method. 
I see that you cannot convert from one relative to another, but what about from an absolute to a relative? 
It all boils down to though that the need to be able to convert to pixels is great, no matter what unit is was declared with. 
Of course I am talking about ONLY computed styles, not style declarations. 
Jeff.

Shouldn't computed values on pixel devices always be in pixels anyway?

________ (.' \) (.' -' ______ I would think that all computed values should be in pixels, but that is left up to the implementation since it is stated that it must be done in pixels. 
I have not tested this in Mozilla as of yet since it is still buggy, but I can see where this can become an issue. 
Let us say that the style is defined in points, the most convenient method would be to just pass it along in points. 
It would not require the browser to interact with it's layout engine to calculate the value in pixels. 
As you can see, it depends upon how important speed is (both speed in coding as well as processing) to the development team.
