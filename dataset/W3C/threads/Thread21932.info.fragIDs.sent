<s> In addition, I want to start putting material on the DOM TS page at W3C, so please have one final go at Curt's and Mary's submitted material before I do  </s>
<s> so. [Unfortunately my timeframe has been a bit limited due to finishing off  </s>
<s> before the summer.  </s>
<s> I should be able to send some comments soon, however]  </s>
<s> (Dimitris/Mary) From the DOM WG meeting, we have a wish for a simple harness  </s>
<s> to generate straightforward results of at least the ECMA tests.  </s>
<s> Mary, could we look at your older solution?  </s>
<s> [Mary?  </s>
<s> Could I have your input on this?]  </s>
<s> (Mary) Given that we do indeed finalize this fairly soon, how long will it take us to translate the existing tests?  </s>

<s> (Dimitris/Fred) We have Fred who's volounteered to write the documentation together with me.  </s>
<s> I look forward to start doing this once we've finalized the schema.  </s>
<s> [Should we coordinate work on a tutorial, Fred?] (Dimitris/Curt) We need to look into the resolution/status options for the submitted tests, eg. by adding a pending option while a test is being investigated by  </s>
<s> the DOM WG. Also we should decide on whether we submit through a mailig list  </s>
<s> or SF. [Have we dropped the idea to use SourceForge for _issue tracking_?  </s>
<s> If  </s>
<s> not, I should include this to the domconftest.  </s>

<s> [mb] I'm looking at it as well as we go through the translation of the NIST tests.  </s>
<s> harness  </s>
<s> I agree that it would be more straightforward to do this after we are sure that the Java translator is done.  </s>
<s> The older NIST ECMAScript harness presupposes the ability to synchronously load an xml file -- something that Mozilla did not support last time I looked.  </s>
<s> As a result, all tests will have to be rewritten to make use an asynchronous load -- that is, load the file first, and then run the test.  </s>
<s> I suggest that instead of rewriting the tests for this purpose that we just rewrite them for the xml-ized version, and translate using a stylesheet.  </s>
<s> There are about 800 html tests, of which about 200 overlapped with the java tests, so they are just about ready to go.  </s>
<s> The others will have to be rewritten -- hard to say how long that will take, but we will start next week -- I would say no longer than 1 month, maybe as little as two weeks.  </s>
<s> on  </s>
<s> [mb] The fundamental/extended tests are just about ready -- almost all of the fundamental tests were already posted on our web site, available from the test matrix.  </s>
<s> I have to rerun them against the new java translator, with if support.  </s>
<s> The remaining ones have been translated, but need some minor editing -- should be ready in 2 days time.  </s>
<s> All of the tests will have to be modified slightly to incorporate namespace info and metadata as soon as it is decided on...  </s>

<s> [mb] Curt, are you doing the ECMA one -- it kind of sounded like you were interested from your last message.  </s>
<s> have  </s>
<s> [mb] The semantic requirements have been incorporated into the test matrix as the test purpose.  </s>
<s> This is no longer a separate issue.  </s>
<s> I think I have to go back over a couple more fundamental interfaces, all of the extended, and of course, html.  </s>
<s> The already identified test purposes are probably close, but there may be a couple of items that were overlooked.  </s>
