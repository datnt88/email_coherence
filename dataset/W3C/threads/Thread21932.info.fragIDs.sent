I presume that most people, like myself, will have some weeks off this 
month, so it seems to be a good idea to get a picture of the current status. 
Below you'll find a list of action items with status indicators. 
Please remind me if I have forgotten anything. 
(W3C) CVS rights to DOM TS Group. 
Have all who should received information? 
(Dimitris) I have the update on the process document [done, published at (Dimitris/All) also I'm looking over both the 
schema and XSL to generate it to sanity check and document further. 
In addition, I want to start putting material on the DOM TS page at W3C, so please have one final go at Curt's and Mary's submitted material before I do 
so. [Unfortunately my timeframe has been a bit limited due to finishing off 
before the summer. 
I should be able to send some comments soon, however] 
(Dimitris/Mary) From the DOM WG meeting, we have a wish for a simple harness 
to generate straightforward results of at least the ECMA tests. 
Mary, could we look at your older solution? 
[Mary? 
Could I have your input on this?] 
(Mary) Given that we do indeed finalize this fairly soon, how long will it take us to translate the existing tests? 
Mary? 
[Being done, do we have a date on 
this?] 
(Dimitris/Fred) We have Fred who's volounteered to write the documentation together with me. 
I look forward to start doing this once we've finalized the schema. 
[Should we coordinate work on a tutorial, Fred?] (Dimitris/Curt) We need to look into the resolution/status options for the submitted tests, eg. by adding a pending option while a test is being investigated by 
the DOM WG. Also we should decide on whether we submit through a mailig list 
or SF. [Have we dropped the idea to use SourceForge for _issue tracking_? 
If 
not, I should include this to the domconftest. 
It would also simplify packaging, building only with stable tests] 
(Philippe) to create a www-dom-ts-submissions@w3.org mailing list. 
[done] (Curt/Mary/Dimitris) Rewrite styelsheets for code generation (Java and ECMA 
primarily, others welcome) (NIST for the Java one, ECMA open) [Java published, has anyone started work on the ECMA one?] 
(Curt, Dimitris?) Work on the details for test suite packaging [do we have 
more input that what has been on the list already?] 
(Mary/Dimitris) Produce a test matrix [Pending on my comments on HTML] (Mary) Produce a list of semantic requirements (Mary, is connected to the test matrix) [ready by now?] 
Kind regards, /Dimitris

[ca] ECMA one should be a relatively simple derivation from the Java transform, however I'd like to get the Java implementation running before starting the ECMAScript.

Yes, I will be out for a week towards the end of the month. 
I've inlined comments below.

[mb] I'm looking at it as well as we go through the translation of the NIST tests. 
harness 
I agree that it would be more straightforward to do this after we are sure that the Java translator is done. 
The older NIST ECMAScript harness presupposes the ability to synchronously load an xml file -- something that Mozilla did not support last time I looked. 
As a result, all tests will have to be rewritten to make use an asynchronous load -- that is, load the file first, and then run the test. 
I suggest that instead of rewriting the tests for this purpose that we just rewrite them for the xml-ized version, and translate using a stylesheet. 
There are about 800 html tests, of which about 200 overlapped with the java tests, so they are just about ready to go. 
The others will have to be rewritten -- hard to say how long that will take, but we will start next week -- I would say no longer than 1 month, maybe as little as two weeks. 
on 
[mb] The fundamental/extended tests are just about ready -- almost all of the fundamental tests were already posted on our web site, available from the test matrix. 
I have to rerun them against the new java translator, with if support. 
The remaining ones have been translated, but need some minor editing -- should be ready in 2 days time. 
All of the tests will have to be modified slightly to incorporate namespace info and metadata as soon as it is decided on...

If 
[mb] Did I miss something -- I thought we were using CVS from W3C and issue tracking from SourceForge??? 
ECMA 
[mb] Curt, are you doing the ECMA one -- it kind of sounded like you were interested from your last message. 
have 
[mb] The semantic requirements have been incorporated into the test matrix as the test purpose. 
This is no longer a separate issue. 
I think I have to go back over a couple more fundamental interfaces, all of the extended, and of course, html. 
The already identified test purposes are probably close, but there may be a couple of items that were overlooked.

I received public keys from Curt, Fred, and Dimitris. 
All of them are already on the public CVS server and should work. 
I include a public copy in this message. 
I also created: (using the XSL-Test-Suite example)
