The HTTP working group has achieved consensus that the document draft-ietf-http-state-mgmt-03.txt is ready to be published as a Proposed Standard. 
Thanks, Larry Whoa! 
That is awfully quick since the notice of its release is barely 24 hours old.

-Richard Gibboney It was my belief that all of the changes that were made were the result of discussion in the group and agreed to. 
However, please _do_ review the document; if there are any changes that are actually necessary, we'll deal with them, even if IESG's already sent out the IESG "last call".
