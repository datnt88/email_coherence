I'm looking at the DOM Level 2 recommendation, and am not sure just what I should use for the internalSubset attribute of the DocumentType interface. 
Should the string include the brackets? 
Should it be null if there is no internal subset? 
Thanks! 
-Fred Fred L. Drake, Jr. fdrake at acm.org PythonLabs at Digital Creations It doesn't look like there was ever a response to this, so I'm reporting on what I did. 
What I'd like is a clarification in the recommendation regarding the indended value for the DocumentType.internalSubset attribute when there is an internal subset. 
In my implementation, I set the attribute to be exactly the text between the '[' and ']' characters that mark the internal subset -- this corresponds exactly to the portion of the doctypedecl production given as: (markupdecl | DeclSep)* Do other implementations that support this attribute do it this way? 
Was this the intended value? 
Thanks! 
-Fred Fred L. Drake, Jr. fdrake at acm.org PythonLabs at Digital Creations Apologies; it took us a while to crosscheck with the XML Core group -- it turned out there was no formal definition of "internal subset" in the XML specs, which we expect will get fixed -- and hence we didn't reach a conclusion until this week. 
I believe the answers are: No. Should it be null if there is no internal subset? 
Yes. 
Joe Kesselman / IBM Research We clarified the specification.

Thank for your report (and your patience), Philippe
