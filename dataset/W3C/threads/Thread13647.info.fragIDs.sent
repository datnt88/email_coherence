<s> I have updated the open issues list [1] with the resolutions from today: 1 issue was closed (# 10) 2 issues were added (#'s 43 and 44) We now have 35 open issues, several of these rely on the WCAG WG.  </s>
<s> I will add a pointer from their issues list to ours.  </s>
<s> Please take a look through the open issues to determine if you think they have been closed or not, or if they need clarification.  </s>
<s> Also, please read through the closed issues to make sure they are in fact closed and that the appropriate follow-up has been finished.  </s>
<s> For example, issue #42.  </s>
<s> Attaching semantics to classes had a lot of discussion on the WCAG list, but was it resolved?  </s>
<s> Len - did you receive a satisfactory answer?  </s>
<s> Seems to me it was still being discussed.  </s>

<s> In my opinion the issue was not sufficiently resolved and while I like Len a lot, I don't like his proposal.  </s>
<s> :) I feel that exposing the arbitrary inner workings of HTML and CSS to the end user -- i.e. by identifying specific "classes" -- is a very poor solution to the problem of poor semantics in HTML code.  </s>
<s> A better solution would be to increase the semantical content of HTML markup, not try to modify CSS in the proposed manner.  </s>

<s> Len's proposal may or may not be the answer, but it attempts to solve a valid problem.  </s>
<s> I agree that the problem is valid, just not with the way Len has proposed.  </s>
<s> I have agreed to work on my own counter-proposal but this may take a few weeks...  </s>

<s> AG:: Once consideration that runs counter to that argument is roughly as follows: The injunction to use semantic CLASS marks and not style rule synonyms is in the WCAG already.  </s>
<s> To get human concepts reflected in these selections, they have to be exposed to some human, and exposing them to users places some "plain English" pressure on authors.  </s>
<s> In other words, give the way CSS works, one cannot relegate CLASS marks to "the inner workings" and achieve a common-sense core for the alternate-sign variation across alternative style sheets.  </s>
<s> The other technical issue is that once you start examining what the semantic classes are that need to be conveyed for universal styling, one discovers a requirement for multiple heredity [why couldn't sandbox.com have double-hatted a table column as simultaneously a FIELDSET so the logical structure would be preserved?].  </s>
<s> In that case the solution where we have to negotiate with the format spec writers may be CLASS marks for subclasses because there is no single-level classification that captures what needs to be said.  </s>
<s> So as one of the stuckees for "make the format contain the semantics out of the box" I wish to reserve the wiggle room to use subtype indications via CLASS attributes and not assume that one flat dictionary of element types is going to capture everything that needs to be expressed.  </s>
<s> [shift gears, pop up a level] My main concern is how to link up the discussions of general accessibility strategies in GL, evaluation strategies in ER, and requirements articulation for new formats in PF. [Actually, UA and AU are essential to make the progress-generating engine work.]  </s>
<s> The only idea I can see is that we deal in object- and graph- classes as the way to capture how it has to work; Then we can map these to some things -- maybe hard coded element and attribute types in XML, maybe architectures of supertypes -- I can't say for sure.  </s>
<s> But when it comes to back-fitting what we have learned onto HTML, it is almost certain that we will need to use CLASS marks to annotate more semantics onto the elements that float around in the hypertext coding at the moment.  </s>
<s> To give an example.  </s>
<s> I really liked Kynn's analysis of the W3C Home Page and explanation how it exemplifies common intra-page structures of the current fashion of page design: masthead, left-nav-bar, payload, right-sidebar-highlight, footer-aka-slash-etc.  </s>
<s> Now "masthead" and "footer" are not classes, they are roles.  </s>
<s> The define the relationship of a sub-range of content to the whole page.  </s>
<s> But for the User Agent trying to guess what is the extent of the masthead, there are legitimate CLASS designations that would sure help.  </s>
<s> How about IMG CLASS="logo, sponsor" src=... and span CLASS="indicia, copyright" ... /span ?  </s>
<s> I am really bummed that we can't tell the UA group what to write into their User Agent spec as to how the User Agent should recognize the principal parts of a page, and most importantly discriminate between payload and packaging roles within the page.  </s>
<s> This distinction is endemic.  </s>
<s> It's present in 99-44/100% of all web pages.  </s>
<s> It would solve the "tank trap of repetitive links at the head of the page" problem deader than a doornail.  </s>
<s> I am sorry I haven't fomented more effective action plans to move us (the WAI) to where we have a markup vocabulary, whether in CLASS ROLE or whatever indications, and authoring session practices that will make this level of deconstruction a piece of cake for the User Agent.  </s>
<s> Len's proposal may or may not be the answer, but it attempts to solve a valid problem.  </s>
