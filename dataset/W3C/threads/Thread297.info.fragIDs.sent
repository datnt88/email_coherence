<s> Hi, I thought a little bit about presentation features of TIDY (aka -slides) and prepared (of course) presenation about the future direction, where TIDY should continue in this matter.  </s>

<s> IMHO Tidy-master Raggett shouldn't put any more development effort into the slide feature.  </s>
<s> It's cute but doing it right (IMHO again) would be a waste of time.  </s>
<s> An XML/XSL slide package would be more appropriate but slides are so presentational (no pun intended) that they almost always need to be hand-tweaked, which is sort-of anti-SGML.  </s>
<s> I fully agree.  </s>
<s> And anyway one might find a few other problems with the output of the -slides option: - It converts HTML4.0 pages (with Doctype declaration) to HTML3.2 and inserts the center element (which is deprecated in HTML 4.0 - It's output does not follow the recommondation that every page's topmost heading should be a h1 heading - It links the slide*.html  </s>
<s> files with a href="slide1.html"  </s>
<s> tags - even if there is a base href="" in the header which sets the default directory to something else Actually the last point is a real bug, which Ionly just discovered.  </s>
<s> The bad thing: It might not be easy to fix.  </s>
<s> Suppose the following domainstructure: URLfilesystem /home/user/www/protected/bar2.html  </s>
<s> And suppose you set a base href="http://www.foo.com/" in both files.  </s>
<s> Tidy might be able to find out where the files are located within the system filestructure.  </s>
<s> But how should it know how the server is set up, i.e. how this translates to the URL structure?  </s>
<s> Removing the base href="" is also no option since then other links within the page won't work any more.  </s>
