OK, call me late to the party, but I am just now implementing WebDAV (class 2) for the Deerfield "Visnetic WebSite" webserver (formerly known as O'Reilly WebSite Pro). 
So far so good, thanks to the volumes of second-hand experience I have gleaned by reading this list's archive. 
Thanks for that!!! 
I have a couple of test tools (DAV explorer and the Tamino test client) plus various things like GoLive, IE5/6 Web Folders, Dreamweaver MX for interop testing. 
Testing with full applications is too painful till I reach a "peak" during development (followed by yet another descent into a valley like the one I got into while atomizing PROPPATCH :-)))) So here are my questions: (2) Does anyone have a suite of validation tools for WebDAV? 
I read posts from several folks that said things like "my test tool reports... and it caught an error in ...". and (2) can I get a copy to use? 
Don't worry about it being a support burden. 
If you'll show me how to get the engines started, I can fly it. 
I wish it were June so I'd be ready for the Sept. interop testing.

I'll have a look... -- Bob
