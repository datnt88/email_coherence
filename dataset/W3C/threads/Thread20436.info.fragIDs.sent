<s> I'm trying to build amaya on a Linux ppc and am experiencing difficulties.  </s>
<s> First I tried: mkdir -p /swl/amaya-4.3.2/Linux-2.2-ppc  </s>
<s> ./configure  </s>
<s> --prefix=/swl/amaya-4.3.2 --exec-prefix=/swl/amaya-4.3.2/Linux-2.2-ppc  </s>
<s> make all  </s>
<s> FAILED in make[1]: Entering directory `/swl/tmp/Amaya/annotlib' System wide unix-thot.rc  </s>
<s> not found at /swl/tmp/config/unix-thot.rc External structure HTML System wide unix-thot.rc  </s>
<s> not found at /swl/tmp/config/unix-thot.rc WARNING: cannot open file en-libdialogue I assumed this meant I needed to install thot.  </s>
<s> The thot (2.1e) INSTALL file indicates that amaya and the thoteditor should be extracted into the thot (library) source tree.  </s>
<s> Did that and tried building thot (which the INSTALL says will build amaya and thoteditor).  </s>
<s> This failed in lots of places but that's I guess I need to talk to the thot people about that.  </s>
<s> At this point I'm considering giving up on getting a new Amaya working on Linux-ppc and using it on a different architecture.  </s>
<s> (Where it is very impressive, I might add!) -sp-  </s>
<s> As explained in http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/Autoconf.html due to configuration files (like unix-thot.rc)  </s>
<s> needed by Amaya compilers you have to build the application in a subdirectory of the Amaya hierarchy mkdir Linux-2.2-ppc cd Linux-2.2-ppc ../configure  </s>
<s> Yes, I did read that section.  </s>
<s> However, we install packages in an area that is cross mounted to lots of different architectures.  </s>
<s> One implication is that we put the source in one place and install the results of the build somewhere else (using the --prefix and --exec-prefix options on configure).  </s>
<s> But, just to make sure, I tried going to the source tree and doing what the web page says: cd /swl/tmp/Thot/Amaya mkdir Linux-2.2-ppc cd Linux-2.2-ppc ../configure I get what sounds like an error from config: "Nor Amaya nor Thot package found, get the corresponding archive" As expected, when I run make with the above config I get: make[1]: *** [libThotEditor.a]  </s>
<s> Error 1 The prerequisite listed on the web page don't say anything about needing to install thot first.  </s>
<s> And, they don't say anything about how to point to thot if it is installed.  </s>
