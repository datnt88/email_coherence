Sorry if this has been seen but some may not have. 
An editorial comment is in order here. 
I've never ordered too much of of any thing or something mal intentioned. 
Also, It would have been nice if the article had given complete web addresses. 
I really hate this out of context quoting stuff too. 
On another note, I bet I could if I really tried hack the stamps site. 
July 6, 1999 [Dodge's E-conomy] Brace of New Federal Requirements Could Help Out Disabled Web Users By JOHN DODGE Special to THE WALL STREET JOURNAL INTERACTIVE EDITION DOUG WAKEFIELD loves eBay, but he isn't a big fan of Omaha Steaks' flashy Web page. 
Oh, Mr. Wakefield likes the steaks just fine -- it's just that he's blind and www.omahasteaks.com is a nightmare for him to navigate. 
Dodge's E-conomy For obvious reasons, blind Web surfers much prefer what their sighted counterparts consider dull and boring -- purely textual sites. 
That's because text can be sent to a Braille display or a speech synthesizer so the visually impaired can understand it, but graphics don't register. 
By next summer, however, there's hope that the Web will look different to blind surfers and other disabled people thanks to a government effort. 
Next Aug. 7, suppliers will be barred from doing business with the federal government unless they follow electronic and information-technology accessibility guidelines for people with disabilities. 
The hope is that the guidelines' adoption by suppliers will help change Web habits so other sites follow suit. 
(And if that doesn't work, the fear of lawsuits may do the trick.) Omaha Steaks www.omahasteaks.com 
eBay www.ebay.com 
U.S. Access Board www.access-board.gov 
EITAAC www.access-board.gov/ notices/eitaacmtg.htm 
Trace Research &amp; Development Center www.trace.wisc.edu 
The initial guidelines were released to the public May 12 and are being firmed up by the U.S. Access Board for a public-comment period beginning in early November. 
By Feb. 7, they will be set in stone and companies will have six months to comply. 
The mandate arises out of the Workforce Investment Act of 1998, signed into law on August 7, 1998 and containing amendments strengthening and updating Section 508 the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. 
That guidelines would impose, for instance, that all that all government suppliers "provide at least one mode that does not require user vision." 
One commonly accepted way to accomplish this is by providing tags with textual descriptions of graphics and photographs. 
That way, the 57-year-old Mr. Wakefield would know his mouse rests on a picture of steaks licked by barbecue flames at omahasteaks.com. 
Many sites do this today -- eBay and the Interactive Journal are just two examples -- but for such tags to be effective, they must be used consistently and offer rich descriptions. 
Unfortunately, that tends not to be the case. 
Economically, the disabled represent a powerful chunk of the U.S. population. 
The Census Bureau says one out of five Americans suffers from a disability and one out of 10 grapples with a serious disability -- on the order of 50 million and 25 million people respectively. 
With the over-65 population expected to increase to 20% of the U.S. total by 2030 from the low teens today, the number of disabled will increase substantially. 
Mr. Wakefield, blind since birth, is an accessibility specialist for the Access Board, a small independent federal agency charged with making government services, resources, jobs and facilities available to all U.S. citizens. 
Despite their hostility to each other in the marketplace, leading hardware and software companies such as IBM, Sun Microsystems and Microsoft put down their swords to serve together on the group's Electronic and Information Technology Access Advisory Committee, or EITAAC, formed last fall to create a universal set of guidelines. 
(In truth, these rivals come together more frequently than you'd think, most often to wrestle with thorny technology issues such as standards.) "The incremental cost of adding accessibility features into new products is actually quite small." says Microsoft director of accessibility Greg Lowney, whose staff of 40 works full time to ensure universal access to the software giant's products. 
"Accessibility is in everyone's best interest. 
A person with disabilities affects five other people they interact with. 
It might be relative or a co-worker." 
IBM program manager for special needs John Steger is more blunt. 
"It's good business." 
Indeed, there is one very strong motivation for the private sector and governments to quickly follow the federal government's lead next year -- discrimination lawsuits. 
For instance, if a disabled person is kept out of a job because of poor Internet access, he or she would likely have a strong discrimination lawsuit, says Joe Tozzi, director of the technology center at the U.S. Education Department, which in early 1997 came up with "Requirements for Accessible Software Design" for its contractors to follow. 
Most Web sites I frequent contain some tags, but their application is inconsistent: Standing items tend to have them, but time-sensitive content such as a news photograph either doesn't or just says "graphic" or the name of the subject. 
If you're wondering how compliant your site is insofar as tags are concerned, measure it against www.trace.wisc.edu. 
Just run your mouse pointer over the graphic and if there is a tag, it should automatically appear. 
Tell me what you find: Share your results with John Dodge and other Interactive Journal readers, or send e-mail to Invariably, new guidelines invite more lawsuits, but that's the price of a better society. 
"It's kind of like consciousness raising -- all of us weren't as conscious 25 to 30 years ago as we are today about gender, racial and ethnic issues," says Mr. Tozzi. 
Resistance to the guidelines and bickering over their substance among the 27 EITAAC members has been almost nil, he adds. 
"I have not spoken to a software designer or developer that hasn't said, 'Had we thought about accessibility up front, it would have been an easy [problem] to address,' " says Mr. Tozzi. 
The people the guidelines are intended to help often respond with a resounding "huh?" when asked about them. 
"I don't know what you're talking about," said Rusty Perez, a 30-year-old blind high-school teacher in Lakewood, Calif., when asked how the guidelines could help him. 
As Web-savvy as he is, he still has problems surfing the Net. 
Mr. Perez uses software that reorganizes the Web page into more logical form so the text can be read to him. 
But sometimes the logic of the page doesn't follow, or tags are absent. 
"Often I come across a link that is not labeled," he says. 
"Then I've got to sit there and wait 35 seconds while the reader goes 'http:// blah, blah, blah' before I hear the file name -- which may not be meaningful to me." 
Mr. Wakefield recalls the time he mistakenly ordered four copies of a software package from a Web site instead of the single copy he wanted. 
"You had to check the number of copies and I just totally missed it until I saw my bill," he says. 
"If you're blind, it was very hard to see. 
I thought I was being careful." 
The guidelines cover the full range of disabilities, including deafness and hearing loss; physical disabilities such as loss of strength, reach and manipulation; tremors and lack of sensation; speech and cognitive disabilities such as thinking, reading and remembering disorders; and other disabilities such as epilepsy and short stature. 
"This is almost as big as Y2K in terms of the amount of energy and time that will go into this," says Martin Bayne, a 46-year-old newsletter publisher in Clifton Park, N.Y., who suffers from Parkinson's disease. 
"This will be the first time sites will have been built from the ground up by both disabled and able-bodied Web designers with the scaffolding in full view every step of the way," An egregious omission from any article on the topic of accessibility would be failure to mention The Trace Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, which has pioneered and catalyzed technology solutions for the disabled since 1971. 
It sat on the EITAAC, and influential business leaders such as Microsoft's Bill Gates characterize its director, Gregg C. Vanderheiden, as a pioneer in the field. 
Stamps of Approval: Why it is you can never find a stamp when you're sending that late birthday card or overdue bill? 
Now, you can print professional looking first-class postage on demand if you have a personal computer, a printer, commonly used office or accounting software and a connection to the Internet. 
E-Stamp.com (www.e-stamp.com) 
promises to launch a nationwide site this summer; www.stamps.com is already up and running. 
Both sites have partnered with the U.S. Postal Service Information Based Indicia Program, or IBIP, which aims to stamp out (no pun intended) postage-meter fraud. 
The technology, which claims to undercut postal meters on a cost basis, uses digital signatures and bar codes that the Post Office says it can verify as authentic. 
According to the Postal Service, fraud has been so rampant that it has considered banning postal meters altogether. 
"The IBI solution renders each indicia [an identifying mark] unique to the mail piece, making it possible to detect duplicates and therefore identify probable counterfeit activity," according to the Postal Service online FAQ on the topic. 
Businesses willing to format printed envelopes with Microsoft Word or similar software are the prime target for the service, but as a consumer, I plan to give it a try too, so Aunt Ruthie won't have to wait an extra couple of days for the birthday card that's already a week late. 
A demonstration of how it works is at www.stamps.com. 
It is interesting to notice the extent to which these articles tend to focus on vision impairment, as distinct from other types of disabilities. 
This is reflected in the examples cited and the choices of interviewees. 
Perhaps vision impairment is the most obvious circumstance that comes to mind when considering barriers to web access, or is it rather that there exists an especially outward-oriented group of highly intelligent and capable people interested in this field who happen to have vision impairments and who are easy to find from a journalist's perspective? 
Please note that no criticism whatsoever is intended here; I am simply inquiring into an apparently consistent (though not universal) tendency in the reporting of these issues. 
I think there are both factors at work here. 
It is interesting to note that while the deaf community have a very large web presence, it is almost invisible in much reporting of accessibility issues. 
THe barriers faced by the deaf are often more complex than those faced by the blind, and therefore less able to be rendered in an appropriate manner for "common journalism". 
THe fact that one or two examples will suffice means the easy examplke (which as Kynn pointed out tends to be blindness) is the one which gets into the article. 
I hope that does not remain the case for ever - the web provides some very important benefits to people with limited mobility that can be easily understood, and a little extension of people's understanding of the world is often a good thing anyway.
