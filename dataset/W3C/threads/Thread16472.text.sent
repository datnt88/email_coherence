The EARL 0.95 stuff has now been uploaded to the W3C site, including the schema:- some examples:- some implementation notes:- a list of changes from 0.9:- and a convertor from 0.9 to 0.95, which I'm very pleased with:- The *old* 0.9 stuff has been moved to:- Please don't cite it as being up-to-date EARL. 
What about the issues? 
Well, taking a look at the most recent issues list, a couple were just syntax problems that I went ahead and corrected, but the only issue that really needed deciding upon (how much prose to include) could easily be decided later. 
I'm already drafting up some examples of processing EARL 0.95.

Er... I meant:- So used to pointing at the old schema! 
All "0.9" stuff is deprecated, but convertable.

Um... WTF is EARL, OK? From http://www.w3.org/2001/03/earl/ EARL - the Evaluation And Report Language It's a language for making statements about the accessibility of something, in a standard machine-readable (and human-displayable) way. 
For example: * I could run a program like Bobby or the W3C validator, and get back a report in EARL which records those things Bobby or the validator can measure. 
* I could sit down and test a site, and record my results in a format that gets changed into EARL (maybe by a script prompting me for answers). 
* I could use a nifty new editor which, on demand, generates an EARL statement about the code it is creating for me. 
* I could then combine all of the above EARL statements into a composite and see how the site measures up against various W3C specifications, such as WCAG or XHTML. 
Failures to comply could also be noted in EARL as well. 
EARL is "just" a common language and syntax for expressing things that we current talk about in English, such as "this page is single-A accessible and it includes D-links" or "this fails checkpoint 2.1" or "alt text exists, but William Loughborough doesn't think they're adequate." 
(The last one is not a tongue-and-cheek joke; EARL, as I understand it, does indeed allow for value judgments and identification of who made those calls.) Kynn Bartlett kynn@reef.com

TAKE CONTROL. 
This is a pretty good summary of what EARL does. 
Indeed it does allow for different people to make statements which can be identified, and therefore to balance information against "whom you trust". 
(For instance you might say that in the absence of any other information you will accept what I have written, but if anyone disagrees with me you believe them instead) Another important use case is that you may have several sources of EARL information about a document you are editing, and how it conforms to WCAG level-A and the US federal government "section 508" purchasing requirements. 
(These are two slightly diffferent sets of requirements). 
An EARL-aware authoring tool would be able to take account of the information you have previously supplied. 
For example, there are four images, and it is noted in EARL that three of them don't need long descriptions, but that one does. 
You would then be prompted for a long description only for the one that needed it, instead of getting asked every time you run a check. 
something like EARL is already in use in several accessibility checking systems - the value of having a single syntax is that the final use case outlined above, as well as Kynn's final use case, becomes possible.
