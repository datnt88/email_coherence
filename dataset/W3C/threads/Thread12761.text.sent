Subject: Draft of re-organized WAI home page EOWG For discussion during Friday July 16 meeting: It was easier to think through the re-organization of the home page using a mocked-up page, rather than just send around a list of topics. 
Some links are active, some are not; if we like this set-up I'd need to put in a number of sub-pages to back these up. 
Some links are to resources not yet created or finalized, so we can see how it hangs together; they'd be taken off the actual home page until they're ready. 
Here's the draft re-org: Here's the original for comparison: Is it: clearer? 
friendlier? 
easier to get to find really useful resources? 
easier to use by different audiences? 
etc.? I realize it's just flat text for now; we can throw in some styling later.

1. 
I like the way the headlines are presented now. 
I am not sure we need a 'headline' hyperlink along with the other links though. 
2. The Resource section is definitely more user-friendly. 
Maybe the 4 links to external resources should be separated out a little in some way. 
3. The Participation section needs to be reworked, I think. 
Unlike the resource section, this does not make for an easy read. 
I prefer the original version with WAI Technical Activity, WAI IPO, Involvement..etc. 
While it may make the page a little longer, it is easier to look for the information than in the current Participation section. 
4. It is good not having a long list of events on the main page. 
Thanks.

Judy, here are my comments for the proposed WAI web page A. These nav bars (Headlines | Mission | Resources | Participation | About WAI ) are not easily discernable, would use CSS to simulate the H3 Tag or something similar. 
B. The techniques document does not get scanned by the eyes, propose bulleting this out as such May 5, 1999: 1. Web Content Accessibility Guidelines become Recommendation 2. WCAG Techniques becomes Note. 
Also would put Headlines over it...see the link but need to be consistent for scanning C. On the far right of the top gif or below in the nav area i would put something like "Need help making a web site accessible" ...not sure of the words here The resources have mixed information and audiences. 
How about splitting up Resources to separate "training and help" and "Related Information" the later may be a bad term. 
but i want to see something like, "Resources to help you make a web site accessible for everyone!" 
This topic for a lack of better words, POP out at me! 
Here is a stab? 
+ Resources to help you make a web site accessible for everyone! 
NOTE, this would be the first item over headline - Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, WCAG Techniques, and Checklist - Web Content Curriculum tutorial - Web Accessibility Overview, - Executive Summary for your boss or senior management - Non-Technical types! 
- Fact sheets: Web Content FAQ, Web Content Common Myths, WAI FAQ - Sample sites: Gallery, Tutorials - Related projects links - Accessibility of W3C Technologies + Technical References and Guidelines - Guidelines: Web Content, User Agent, Authoring Tools - Technical references: Web Content Techniques, HTML Access, CSS Access, SMIL Access, W3C Technical Reports + Related Efforts - Policy links - Alternative browser links - Evaluation tool links - Translations: Completed, Coordination + Easy guides: Quick Tips (ordering), , Literature Stuffer (ordering), Press Releases (May want to consider moving headlines under here and putting Press Releases on the nav item agree, may want to keep it short, sweet and easily scannable and with not much scrolling The new draft is easier to read. 
I was surprised to see the Events nav link missing. 
Events are an important public display and forum of/for on going work and developments. 
Oops! 
I see on closer inspection that events is included under Participation. 
I see WAI events WG meetings and the like falling under the Participation umbrella. 
General Events Calendar should come under the Resources umbrella - something the public can attend to learn more about WAI activities (work in progress, up dates, trainings, materials, etc.) I like Rob Neff's idea of 'splitting up Resources to separate "training and help" and "Related Information" ' Then General Events would fall under "training and help" Jim Actually I would suggest that events is a top-level heading on its own. 
It falls into enough other categories for this to make sense, rather than repeating it in all of them. 
(It also seems like an ideal place to work on an accessible, database-generated bit of web content...) Charles The new draft is easier to read.
