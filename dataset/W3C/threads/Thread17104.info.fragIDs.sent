<s> jaws does not ignore graphics.  </s>
<s> It does some wonderfull things with them depending on how they are marked up.  </s>
<s> If a graphic has an alt tag, and you are using ie with jaws, it will say "graphic alt" where alt is the conditional content of the graphic.  </s>
<s> If a graphic has an url associated with it, we can get the url.  </s>
<s> We can now configure jaws to do lots of things with rendering graphics and the important thing to know is that many jaws users are also sharing a computer and the person they are working with may not be blind.  </s>
<s> There are even some sighted people for one reason or another are using jaws to work with computers.  </s>

<s> you have to remember that JAWS is a proprietary screen reader, very expensive and only avaliable for the latest versions of windoze one of the major problems with many websites is that they are written for only certain operating systems or web browsers.  </s>
<s> This is a WORLD wide web and as such must deal with many levels of usage and users and equipment.  </s>

<s> I believe the alt or longdesc attribute is meant as replacement for the image and the title attribute can tell where the link is going to.  </s>
<s> As it is possible to block images from servers or to put off images, I think using images as links is not the best idea.  </s>
