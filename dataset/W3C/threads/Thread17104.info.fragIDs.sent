I have a friend that is totally blind that uses JAWS screen reader. 
I asked what he felt about the "text only" concept. 
He replied that his screen reader ignores graphics altogether. 
If a graphic is in itself a link, it should be identified as such in the ALT or LONGDESC attributes. 
I think that would negate the need for "text 
only" pages.

jaws does not ignore graphics. 
It does some wonderfull things with them depending on how they are marked up. 
If a graphic has an alt tag, and you are using ie with jaws, it will say "graphic alt" where alt is the conditional content of the graphic. 
If a graphic has an url associated with it, we can get the url. 
We can now configure jaws to do lots of things with rendering graphics and the important thing to know is that many jaws users are also sharing a computer and the person they are working with may not be blind. 
There are even some sighted people for one reason or another are using jaws to work with computers. 
I have been a jaws user for 10 years.

you have to remember that JAWS is a proprietary screen reader, very expensive and only avaliable for the latest versions of windoze one of the major problems with many websites is that they are written for only certain operating systems or web browsers. 
This is a WORLD wide web and as such must deal with many levels of usage and users and equipment. 
Also because the majority of people with disabilities are still unemployed or underemployed economics is a major issue, so a larger percentage of users are likely not running the latest and greatest (and most expensive) hardware and software. 
so accessibility also means slower connections, older operating systems, less sophisitcated browsers and Open Source software 
I agree I don't see the "need" for text only pages but the page still has 
to be readable by basic browsers such as Lynx Bob "They that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve Neither liberty nor safety", Benjamin Franklin ASCII Ribbon Campaign accessBob NO HTML/PDF/RTF in e-mail accessys@smartnospam.net NO MSWord docs in e-mail Access Systems, engineers NO attachments in e-mail, *LINUX powered* access is a civil right THIS message and any attachments are CONFIDENTIAL and may be privileged.

I believe that you are correct, and that recognised best practise is generally not to produce text only sites.

Hello John, 
."text only" pages. 
I believe the alt or longdesc attribute is meant as replacement for the image and the title attribute can tell where the link is going to. 
As it is possible to block images from servers or to put off images, I think using images as links is not the best idea.
