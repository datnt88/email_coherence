<s> Out of context, that seems to me to say that entity tag values are not expected to be unique across different entities from the same server, hence if the same value is sent by the server in response to different request URIs, don't expect that the respones have any relationship to each other.  </s>

<s> The point that is trying to be made is that an entity tag can only be used relative to the same requested resource.  </s>
<s> Personally, I wish Etags were stronger than this, but that is their definition.  </s>

<s> At the time we discussed this, it was believed that we could at some later date add other kinds of ETags with a broader scope (server unique or even globally unique).  </s>
<s> I think the possibility is still open to do this, in a separate specification.  </s>
<s> Old clients/proxies would just see the new ETag as having a narrower scope of uniqueness.  </s>

<s> Do you think it would be useful to separate the proposal for allowing an entity tags with a greater uniqueness scope?  </s>
<s> For other purposes, tying the entity tag uniqueness scope to the delta coding header wouldn't be as useful.  </s>

<s> I suggest you remove "naively"; those who might value simplicity of implementation over some of your other goals may not be "naive" but just operating under other constraints.  </s>
<s> # based on an entirely false analogy between MIME and HTTP... # It is too late to fix the terminological failure in the HTTP/1.1 # specification I don't think that the dictionary definition of "entity" is any more relevant than the dictionary definition of "protocol".  </s>

<s> I don't think that the relationship between MIME and HTTP is an 'analogy', nor is it 'entirely false'.  </s>
<s> Your grumpy complaint of the word "entity" here doesn't really advance your cause.  </s>
<s> And it wasn't "too late" to fix a "terminological failure" in January 1998 (the date of your Internet Draft.) Rather, there was rough consensus that it was not a "failure".  </s>
<s> I suggest that you continue to explain how the concepts of "entity" in HTTP and MIME differ, as it is a useful discussion, but keep the introduction of "instance" neutral: "to avoid confusion, we define a new term in this memo:" Now that we're about to issue the HTTP/1.1 DS as an RFC, you might revise the reference [9] and the tense of "has been proposed".  </s>

<s> On reflection, I don't think this rewrite is that much easier to parse, since it's not clear what the subject of "does not imply" is.  </s>
<s> How about A given entity tag value MAY be used for entities obtained by requests on different URIs.  </s>
<s> The use of the same entity tag value in conjunction with entities obtained by requests on different URIs does not imply the equivalence of those entities.  </s>
