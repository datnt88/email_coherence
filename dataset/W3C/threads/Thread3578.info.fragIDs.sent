<s> With respect to version dates on the questions- I know we have talked about this before, but I want to raise it again.  </s>
<s> Right now we use the cvs date to represent the last modification.  </s>
<s> On systems where I have used file modification dates it became very hard to realistically determine when a page has been truly reviewed by someone vs. the date when the last change was made.  </s>
<s> Occasionally we will want to make global changes to pages, styles, links, etc. and doing so obscures the date where a meaningful change has occured or the page has been meaningfully reviewed.  </s>
<s> My suggestion: we would be better served by have a note at the bottom of each page indicating the last date someone checked the page.  </s>
<s> It is more useful for us, and useful for readers than the cvs date.  </s>

<s> Hi Tex, When you say 'reviewed' do you mean 'revised', or when you say 'checked' and 'reviewed' do you mean that someone looked at the page without necessarily making any changes?  </s>
