<s> Hi, HTML 4.01 says, IDs must be case-insensitive unique, but user agents must treat it case-sensitive.  </s>
<s> So, is getElementById() case-sensitive in the HTML DOM?  </s>
<s> How handle current implementations the case, when an ID isn't unique, what do they return for getElementById()?  </s>

<s> is getElementById() case-sensitive in the HTML DOM?  </s>
<s> Yes. As you pointed out, "user agents must treat it case-sensitive".  </s>
<s> The DOM doesn't currently check for uniqueness.. DOM Level 3 may address this.  </s>
<s> Meanwhile, I'd say that any response to a poorly-formed document is equally acceptable.  </s>
<s> Personally I'd lean toward "If it isn't unique, it isn't really an ID, so none of them match" -- which would be easier to  </s>

<s> Or move toward the XHTML world and declare the document invalid -- though there is so much broken HTML currently in use that this isn't always an option.  </s>

<s> Hi All, I completely agree that even though duplicate IDs should stop processing (not just match none), I think we owe some advice for what to do when part of the broken HTML universe is encountered.  </s>
<s> Hey, you just have to start from the beginning and get it well-formed and obeying the uniqe ID rule and others before you can work with it using XML/DOM tech.  </s>
<s> What if the broken HTML uses name instead of ID?  </s>
<s> There are probably ten other considerations like this.  </s>
<s> What to do with broken stuff.? Well, you must start by fixing it!:) How about running it thru TIDY or equivalent before processing it further.  </s>
<s> Just finding out that it is broken is certainly some level of accomplishment that should be recognized as a good thing.  </s>
<s> I hope we don't get to a point where we start bending some basic structures and rules to accomodate broken stuff that should just be fixed.  </s>
<s> Thank You and Best Regards, Joedw web3dc  </s>
