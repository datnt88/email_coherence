<s> quizzed, we should just refer people to some of the core discussions on ERT about what it should be called.  </s>
<s> It's perfectly acceptable to have an acronym that has no particular expansion.  </s>
<s> In fact, in the case of EARL, every time we've tried to expand it, we've ended up not being able to fully capture what we mean.  </s>
<s> The characters "EARL" should be enough to symbolize to anyone who has worked on the language enough to recognize the whole "feeling" behind the name, and, to people being introduced to the language, they won't have some redundant first impression of a language that may need at least a thousand words to explain.  </s>
<s> In other words, "EARL" should become a word (acronym) of its very own.  </s>
<s> There are only a few instances of the expansion on the EARL homepage anyway - these would be quite easy to remove, and perhaps replace with a link to this note, or some XHTML equivalent.  </s>

<s> I disagree, this would be contrary to people 's expectation and jeopardize the adoption of EARL to start from.  </s>

<s> In fact, the R, which stands for Report instead of Repair seems to imply a scope to EARL.  </s>
<s> It's not MathML, It's not Annotae (spelling?) it's not AERT, it's EARL!  </s>

<s> The first thing anyone wants to know about a new acronym is "what does it stand for?"  </s>

<s> And people will want an answer, they won't just blindly accept "we like the name 'Earl' because it sounds like that tea, but we couldn't define this language enough to come up with an acronym expansion.")  </s>

<s> I think it helps to have an explanation for EARL when it actually does have it.  </s>
<s> It also makes it easier to remember.  </s>
<s> Report seems to be better now as you can report the results of evaluations and possibly later also the repair suggestions.  </s>
<s> Annotea (this is the right spelling) on the other hand is just a name not an acronym.  </s>
<s> It is related to annotations as it has the same start.  </s>
<s> If really wanting an explanation the tea ending can be bound to collaborative gatherings but that is quite far fetched :-).  </s>
