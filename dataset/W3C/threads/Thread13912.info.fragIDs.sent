Hi Charles - are you looking at the ability to test dynamic pages generated based on form data and behind form submits? 
Or is there something about the interaction of the pages and independent of the generated content of any 
individual page? 
For the first part, I think a number of tools support it in various ways. 
The way the Watchfire tools work is to scan the site, collect forms, and allow you to fill out the form, then rescan to pick up the resultant pages. 
You can provide multiple sets of form data if you need to test multiple scenarios, and can continue the process if there is a chain of forms as in the WAI meeting registration process. 
If you're looking for the second part, I'd be interested to know what sort of functionality you're 
thinking about, but am not aware of any tools that do anything around that.

Sent: Wednesday, December 31, 2003 8:13 PM Subject: Testing dynamic pages [Bcc'ed to EuroAccessibility technical groups] Hi folks, one of the issues that is going to come up for the EuroAccessibility Task Force on testing tools is how to check the performance of tools for dynamic pages - for example, can a particular piece of sooftware test the 4-step process of registering for a W3C meeting, or the process of applying for a credit card online? 
Thre are lots of open questions about the best methodology to apply here, and particularly about how to classify the results, but I am wondering if anyone has a tool that can actually walk through the process, and how this is done. 
The EuroAccessibility task force is likely to look seriously at how to do this in the second half of this year (at least it is this year in Europe now :-) and having some idea now about any tools that are designed to handle this problem would be helpful. 
Some preliminary thoughts: javascript extensions to something that functions as a browser, or tools that have access to pprocessing back-ends, seem to me likely to have an easier time of this. 
Although in principle it is possible to save each page through the process and run it through a local test, it might not be that simple in practice to get all the scripts, styles, multimedia, etc. Testing this manually (without tools) should be largely possible, but it is a complex job, and it would be nice to be supported by software.

Essentially I think I am looking at this process, in the first instance. 
And yes, Watchfire sounds like the other tools described that handle this. 
The one thing that comes up here is related to EARL - how do I describe the fact that I have assessed "the login process for a website"? 
I presume it isn't that tricky, but requires a special RDF vocabulary 
which can talk about a process which includes multiple pages that each have to meet a set of criteria. 
Because if any one of the pages fails, then the process will fail. 
And quite often the processes, or user paths, are what is important - I think this is used more formally in usability testing, but it strikes me as a different way of explaining something rather than a fundamental difference in what people do. 
I'll think about it, because it seems an interesting way to extend EARL data. 
It also points up the strength of having EARL as RDF - it should be relatively easy to do in a way that doesn't require rebuilding lots of tools... Cheers Chaals Charles McCathieNevile Fundaci?n Sidar charles@sidar.org http://www.sidar.org 
hi charles, 
i'm not sure if EARL is the right place for this type of stuff. 
it seems to me to be more of a tool feature to be able to group sets of pages together and give an overall claim. 
this can also be useful to evaluate whole trails such as a registration process, a tutorial or just a bunch of related pages. 
regards, shadi
