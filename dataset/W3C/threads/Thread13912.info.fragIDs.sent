<s> Hi Charles - are you looking at the ability to test dynamic pages generated based on form data and behind form submits?  </s>
<s> Or is there something about the interaction of the pages and independent of the generated content of any  </s>
<s> individual page?  </s>
<s> For the first part, I think a number of tools support it in various ways.  </s>
<s> The way the Watchfire tools work is to scan the site, collect forms, and allow you to fill out the form, then rescan to pick up the resultant pages.  </s>
<s> You can provide multiple sets of form data if you need to test multiple scenarios, and can continue the process if there is a chain of forms as in the WAI meeting registration process.  </s>
<s> If you're looking for the second part, I'd be interested to know what sort of functionality you're  </s>
<s> thinking about, but am not aware of any tools that do anything around that.  </s>

<s> Sent: Wednesday, December 31, 2003 8:13 PM Subject: Testing dynamic pages [Bcc'ed to EuroAccessibility technical groups] Hi folks, one of the issues that is going to come up for the EuroAccessibility Task Force on testing tools is how to check the performance of tools for dynamic pages - for example, can a particular piece of sooftware test the 4-step process of registering for a W3C meeting, or the process of applying for a credit card online?  </s>
<s> Thre are lots of open questions about the best methodology to apply here, and particularly about how to classify the results, but I am wondering if anyone has a tool that can actually walk through the process, and how this is done.  </s>
<s> The EuroAccessibility task force is likely to look seriously at how to do this in the second half of this year (at least it is this year in Europe now :-) and having some idea now about any tools that are designed to handle this problem would be helpful.  </s>
<s> Some preliminary thoughts: javascript extensions to something that functions as a browser, or tools that have access to pprocessing back-ends, seem to me likely to have an easier time of this.  </s>
<s> Although in principle it is possible to save each page through the process and run it through a local test, it might not be that simple in practice to get all the scripts, styles, multimedia, etc. Testing this manually (without tools) should be largely possible, but it is a complex job, and it would be nice to be supported by software.  </s>

<s> Essentially I think I am looking at this process, in the first instance.  </s>
<s> And yes, Watchfire sounds like the other tools described that handle this.  </s>
<s> The one thing that comes up here is related to EARL - how do I describe the fact that I have assessed "the login process for a website"?  </s>
<s> I presume it isn't that tricky, but requires a special RDF vocabulary  </s>
<s> which can talk about a process which includes multiple pages that each have to meet a set of criteria.  </s>
<s> Because if any one of the pages fails, then the process will fail.  </s>
<s> And quite often the processes, or user paths, are what is important - I think this is used more formally in usability testing, but it strikes me as a different way of explaining something rather than a fundamental difference in what people do.  </s>
<s> I'll think about it, because it seems an interesting way to extend EARL data.  </s>
<s> It also points up the strength of having EARL as RDF - it should be relatively easy to do in a way that doesn't require rebuilding lots of tools... Cheers Chaals Charles McCathieNevile Fundaci?n Sidar charles@sidar.org http://www.sidar.org  </s>
<s> hi charles,  </s>
<s> i'm not sure if EARL is the right place for this type of stuff.  </s>
<s> it seems to me to be more of a tool feature to be able to group sets of pages together and give an overall claim.  </s>
<s> this can also be useful to evaluate whole trails such as a registration process, a tutorial or just a bunch of related pages.  </s>
<s> regards, shadi  </s>
