<s> I'm tired, sometimes even angry and I want web standards to make my job easier.  </s>
<s> I'm hoping to learn from the considerable collective experience on this list and find out how to evangelize to non-technical people.  </s>
<s> Oh, I understand how web standards work and I'm all for it, I just haven't had much success in convincing others to have our work future-proofed and available on many devices.  </s>
<s> I'm a young web designer who's only been in the field for a few years and I work in-house as the webmaster for a large university (biology.ucsd.edu),  </s>
<s> so most of the problem has nothing to with technical details - I'm just at the bottom of a large totem pole.  </s>
<s> No big client list to cycle through for a sympathetic ear.  </s>
<s> And on a fundamental level, web designers are ill-equipped to tell systems administrators why they should kill off Netscape 4, since all we can talk about is the user experience and not many of their issues, like security, stability, etc. IE 6 may be a great product, but removing the stink of association with anything Microsoft is near impossible.  </s>
<s> Can you blame them, if all they know about Microsoft and the web is the hell created by FrontPage "authors"?  </s>
<s> Although my work is starting to gain recognition outside of our department and I'm pretty good at public speaking (I just gave my first presentation on web standards at a campus conference this morning, it went swimmingly), I still haven't had much luck in practicing what I preach and convincing others (especially faculty) that degradation in Netscape 4 is an acceptable trade off, especially when considering the point brought up by another post: there is a distinct lack of killer apps that require web standards, since most people don't rely on Pocket PCs or Braille readers on a daily basis.  </s>
<s> Anyone else that works in a university or large government organization may be able to sympathize with my plight!  </s>
<s> Our server stats show that upwards of 40% of our audience still use some version of NN4, and we get 1-2 million hits a month.  </s>
<s> And I'm glad to see others care about this issue:  </s>
<s> So how the heck to we make the benefits of standards-based markup/code real to the worker ants on the ground?  </s>
<s> There's no point creating a standards compliant website if the designer and the clients don't understand why its good to do so.  </s>
<s> Hear, hear.  </s>
<s> Those are my main concerns also and I am desperately curious to hear what works for other people.  </s>
<s> And sorry to come across as so jaded - it's just that sometimes I want to chuck it all and find a web agency that believes in the same values!  </s>
<s> Evangelism in such a large organization is tiring and I have an INCREDIBLE amount of respect for the tireless efforts of the webstandards.org  </s>
<s> people and Jeffrey Zeldman in particular.  </s>
<s> How you guys and gals keep it up, I don't know.  </s>
<s> Caffeine maybe?  </s>
<s> rant over... Al Abut  </s>
<s> The way I'm using to get the message across in my company in the U.K. is to use references to the Disability Discrimination Act, The RNIB (Royal National institute for the Blind) and other similar organisations to emphasise that we're not doing as well as we could.  </s>
<s> This probably translates to Section 508 and other organisations in the USA.  </s>
<s> I'm also using futureproofing (a term I've been using for close on two years and its not sunk in yet) to say that our clients will expect better of us for a small change in practice.  </s>
<s> Fortunately we don't have the NS4 usage that you have, less than 3%.  </s>
<s> It may not be fair using someone else's disability to highlight that we should be doing something different, but do say that disability of whatever form is something that occurs more as people get older, and would you (the audience) like it if you were excluded from something you can do now?  </s>
<s> That seems to have some effect.  </s>
<s> It did the last time I gave a similar presentation, anyway, but the audience was not influential in the company as I would have liked.  </s>
<s> Its taken me two years to get not very far - you're not alone.  </s>
<s> I'm doing a presentation in mid September to try and get the message across again - although I don't expect to have the success I think it should have as I'm up against a set of people who do not know.  </s>
<s> It is my job to educate them.  </s>
<s> Well, I think it is, anyway.  </s>
<s> I am rather a self-appointed evangelist - I think that many people here are, and don't mind being so called.  </s>
<s> My opinion, after posting to this forum for just three days is that there is a helluva lot of talent here, and we're all in the same type boat sailing on the same type of ocean - a bit lumpy with occasional storms.  </s>
<s> The way I think that this forum will pan out is that there are so many committed people here writing about Web Standards that resources will soon come along at which you can point people and say "That's why we should do it".  </s>
<s> they may not agree first time, but the second, third and so on???  </s>
<s> All I can say is that you have a position I'd envy, and be wary about giving up.  </s>
<s> There aren't many web agencies who think the way that we do, unfortunately.  </s>
<s> All we can do is give support - you're not on your own - as this list is making very plain.  </s>
<s> Regards John  </s>
<s> Thanks for the kind words John, and yes, it's very nice to be in the same boat with other self-appointed evangelists toiling away in large organizations.  </s>
<s> Designers, programmers and web developers in general have their circles to talk about issues, but finding people interested in web standards has been another matter.  </s>
<s> As for one of your points:  </s>
<s> It may not be fair using someone else's disability to highlight that we should be doing something different, but do say that disability of whatever form is something that occurs more as people get older, and would you (the audience) like it if you were excluded from something you can do now?  </s>
<s> I do feel sometimes like I'm co-opting the cause of designing with disabled people in mind simply because pages that are accessible for them are consequently easily digestible by other devices as well.  </s>
<s> There's a few Pocket PC initiatives starting on campus that are experimenting with changing the way some undergraduate courses are taught, with IPaqs on each desk, and having the course material be already standards-compliant for visually impaired professors helps immensely, since it's trivial to recycle that content.  </s>
<s> In fact, the only web developers on my campus that have been able to implement any kind of usability or accessibility-related designs were in departments where they had disabled faculty.  </s>
<s> I never pictured myself saying this and I'd wouldn't wish ill upon anyone, but I found myself wishing that our department had more handicapped professors!  </s>
