<s> I am preparing a business case talk about accessibility for a technology consortium - I remember that someone had statistics related to the purchasing power of this audience, but since I changed jobs and was not able to save all the docs I had on my former work computer, I have lost the reference.  </s>
<s> Can someone please help me?  </s>

<s> I use the stat in my accessibility workshops.  </s>

<s> I also note groups that may have some criterion of accessibility in mind (whether consciously held or not) when choosing products and services: 1. Seniors: older people tend to have more disabilities.  </s>
<s> 2. Children: well-designed web sites are easier for children to use.  </s>
<s> 3. Families of people with disabilities.  </s>
<s> 4. Professionals who serve people with disabilities: occupational therapists, rehabilitation and biomedical engineers and assistive technologists. 5. Organizations that serve people with disabilities: hospitals, private and public rehabilitation institutes.  </s>
<s> 6. Organizations that purchase equipment on behalf of people with disabilities: schools, colleges and universities.  </s>
<s> 7. Organizations that deal with accessibility and disability issues: advocacy groups, social justice groups, and human rights watchdogs.  </s>
<s> 8. Organizations that train people with disabilities to use assistive devices.  </s>
<s> 9.  </s>
