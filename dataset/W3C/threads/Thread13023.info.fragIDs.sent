I am preparing a business case talk about accessibility for a technology consortium - I remember that someone had statistics related to the purchasing power of this audience, but since I changed jobs and was not able to save all the docs I had on my former work computer, I have lost the reference. 
Can someone please help me?

Hi Lila, I can't remember my source for this. 
I use the stat in my accessibility workshops. 
The combined income of Americans with disabilities is nearly $700 billion. 
Of this total, $175 billion is discretionary income. 
I also note groups that may have some criterion of accessibility in mind (whether consciously held or not) when choosing products and services: 1. Seniors: older people tend to have more disabilities. 
2. Children: well-designed web sites are easier for children to use. 
3. Families of people with disabilities. 
4. Professionals who serve people with disabilities: occupational therapists, rehabilitation and biomedical engineers and assistive technologists. 5. Organizations that serve people with disabilities: hospitals, private and public rehabilitation institutes. 
6. Organizations that purchase equipment on behalf of people with disabilities: schools, colleges and universities. 
7. Organizations that deal with accessibility and disability issues: advocacy groups, social justice groups, and human rights watchdogs. 
8. Organizations that train people with disabilities to use assistive devices. 
9. 
Any organization that selects products and services according to some criterion of accessibility for people with disabilities, e.g., the US Government.

Lila: In October, 2000, Gretchen posted some info to the EO list: You might want to take a look at the other postings she made around then - they may help.
