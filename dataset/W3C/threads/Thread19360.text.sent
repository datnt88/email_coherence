Hello, is there a way to make `view source' connecting to an external editor (e.g. emacsclient / vimclient) ? 
Johannes Amaya is able to handle several representations of the same information and the source view is one of them. 
It would be possible to develop a mechanism that alllows connection with other applications. 
We didn't work on that, but Amaya users will be happy to have this kind of support.

I'd love to drop in, but alas, I've no time! 
btw.: is someone working on svg's path yet ? 
Johannes Not yet.
