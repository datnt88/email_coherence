<s> As to tabindex I think tabbing is just like it always is, goes to the next link.  </s>
<s> I think there'd have to be a lot of implementation before much can be determined.  </s>
<s> This whole thing's going on my back burner.  </s>
<s> It's an unavailable solution looking for a so-far-undetected problem as far as I can determine at this time.  </s>
