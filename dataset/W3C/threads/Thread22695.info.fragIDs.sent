<s> Hi, I've got a question on measuring HTML elements.  </s>
<s> IE and now Mozilla both implement offsetWidth and offsetHeight.  </s>
<s> IE also has other properties for getting the size of HTML elements such as scrollWidth and scrollHeight for getting the content height of an element rather than what is actually displayed (like a div with a size  content size).  </s>
<s> Measuring elements is extremely useful when creating DHTML pages.  </s>
<s> I'm wondering why there is no specification in the DOM for this kind of functionality?  </s>
<s> Is it an oversight, or out of the scope of the DOM, or am I just missing something?  </s>
<s> Thanks, Cameron.  </s>
<s> I'm wondering why there is no specification in the DOM for [offset*].  </s>
<s> Is it an oversight, or out of the scope of the DOM[...]?  </s>
<s> Yes, IMO it's out of scope.  </s>
<s> DOM concerns itself only with the document, not a current rendering of it.  </s>
<s> Even when you set an HTML element's position with the likes of "x.style.top=  </s>
<s> '20px'", you're only simulating adding the inline style "top: 20px" to the document, not directly telling the browser to place the element.  </s>
<s> It's a problem for web authoring: there's a *big* standards hole between ECMAScript and the DOM.  </s>
<s> ECMA defines the standard built-in language objects and DOM the standard document-related objects, but everything else (window, screen, navigator, etc., as well as offset* and the "DOM Level 0" form interaction model) remains unstandardised, documented only at MS and Netscape's proprietary references.  </s>
<s> It's not very glamourous from a forward-looking point-of-view, but I believe it'd help a lot of people if this area were standardised.  </s>

<s> It is a practical consideration to be able to set and retrieve information on how the browser renders a page.  </s>
<s> I'm not a browser developer, but I'm sure all browsers know the size of an element internally, surely they would have to to be able to render a page.  </s>
<s> It would be great to have a standard way of accessing this information.  </s>
<s> I'm quite suprised this issue hasn't been covered in the DOM before.  </s>
<s> It would definetly help anyone writing DHTML applications IMHO.  </s>
<s> Cameron.  </s>
<s> It has been started, as the Views and Formatting module for DOM Level 3. You will find that this is a separate module rather than adding presentation methods to the elements directly, because adding presentation methods to the content model is extremely problematic.  </s>
<s> As the status of this document indicates, the DOM WG is waiting for some momentum and surge in interest in multiple companies to experiment and implement this type of interfaces.  </s>
<s> If done modularly, portably, adaptibly to all presentations, it can be, IMO, both glamorous and good.  </s>
<s> But if pursued like DOM level 0, adding presentation-assumption-specific methods to DOM nodes, I hope no one seriously wants to pursue it as a standardization, since the API will break badly on future devices and browser models.  </s>
<s> What is the pitch of a phrase being bresented in a visual browser.  </s>
<s> What is the pixel width of an element being presented in a voice browser?  </s>
<s> How about the width in a visual browser presenting the same document in multiple different-sized windows, or where the element has been broken across fixed-size pages for print preview or to better utilize a multiheaded or non-standard display?  </s>
