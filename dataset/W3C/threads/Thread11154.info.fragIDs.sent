<s> I hear you expressing unhappiness with the catalog proposal as it stands, but all I can determine as your problem with it is that it doesn't specify how the XML implementation will determine what the catalog is.  </s>
<s> I'm failing to understand why go on at length about this.  </s>
<s> I'm not actually compalaining about that proposal particularly.  </s>
<s> Sorry if I wasn't clear about that.  </s>
<s> I am saying that we can't stop there, because it doesn't solve enough of the problem to be useful.  </s>
<s> I think that there are two acceptable scenarios which will work: (1) no FPIs at all.  </s>
<s> I favour this very strongly indeed.  </s>
<s> (2) FPIs are used, and any XML application that needs to can turn the FPI into a system identifier and proceed.  </s>
<s> (This is what Paul Prescod is opposing.  </s>
<s> I _think_ he wants all resolution methods to be proprietary, so that we should not recommend one.)  </s>
<s> I understand you to say you don't want a final XML spec that says nothing about how an implementation should find its catalog.  </s>
<s> Okay.  </s>
<s> Point taken.  </s>
<s> Some might disagree and prefer to leave it unspecified, but I suspect a majority of us would at least like to see a non-binding recommendation as to how an XML implementation could find its catalog.  </s>
<s> Yes. Otherwise, if ArborText and SoftQuad and Synex and InSo/EBT and TechnoTeacher and thirtyfive other companies all have XML products, and you put an XML file on the web, you may need to deal with 40 different ways of handling PUBLIC identifiers in order that your XML file "just works".  </s>
<s> So either (a) suggest some words right now that you'd like to add to the proposal or (b) let's agree now that, once we determine how an XML application will find its style sheet, we'll define an analogous way for it to find its catalog.  </s>
<s> I am happy with either of these.  </s>
<s> I will append a suggested mechanism.  </s>
<s> Thanks for the prod :-)  </s>
<s> It seems more important to me to determine first (1) if we will add public identifiers to XML  </s>
<s> I don't think we should decide to do that.  </s>
<s> When this first came up, I asked what problems were being solved.  </s>
<s> The answers were * backward compatibility with a different (not XML) language with which we were not otherwise compatible (i.e. existing SGML documents are very unlikely to work unchanged as XML, because of the different EMPTY syntax, the lack of CONREF, content model changes, etc.) * warm fuzzy feelings that public identifiers are better than system identifiers * the possibility of indirection -- which can be done in other ways -- to achieve document longevity Of these, only the last made or makes any sense to me.  </s>
<s> If you have URNs, you can put a URN in the system identifier and solve the problem that way.  </s>
<s> No extra language keyword is needed for that.  </s>
<s> The people who were arguing for the need for indirection seem to include those who are now arguing that we shouldn't say how to do it.  </s>
<s> I think PUBLIC is being added for no other reason than warm fuzzies  </s>
<s> and (2) if so, if we will recommend a catalog-based resolution scheme in XML,  </s>
<s> I don't have feelings on this as long as it's no more than a way to go from PUBLIC to SYSTEM identifiers (as James pointed out), and as long as we document carefully, completely and exactly how to get from a PUBLIC identifier to a CATALOG file.  </s>
<s> and (3) if so, will we limit the right hand side of catalogs to the same things allowed in XML system identifiers,  </s>
<s> Yes. Obviously we must.  </s>
<s> If you need to add more features to system identifiers, add them everywhere.  </s>
<s> If not, don't.  </s>
<s> and (4) if so, will that be URLs or will we expand what we allow as XML system identifiers.  </s>
<s> They must be the same.  </s>
<s> OK, here is a suggested way to get to a CATALOG file.  </s>
<s> [0] do not look for a catalog file unless you come across a PUBLIC identifier.  </s>
<s> [1] if there is a processing instruction tht occurs before the DOCTYPE line of the form ?-XML-CATALOG "system-id"?  </s>
<s> then that is the system identifier of the catalog and all other mechanisms are disregarded.  </s>
<s> [2] determine the base address of the XML document as a system identifier.  </s>
<s> This may come from a ?-XML-BASE  </s>
<s> "system-id"?  </s>
<s> processing instruction before the DOCTYPE line, or may be known externally.  </s>
<s> The processing instruction always takes precedence.  </s>
<s> [3] search for "catalog.soc"  </s>
<s> as if it had been given as a relative URL embedded in the document at the point of the PUBLIC Idenntifier, using the mechansism described in RFC 1808, Relative Uniform Resource Locators.  </s>
<s> [4] an application may choose to keep a cache of PUBLIC entities.  </s>
<s> If so, it is up to the application whether to use CATALOG resolution if it has already stored a system identifier for that public Id; however, it should if possible check to see if any remote files have changed before using cached copies.  </s>
<s> What have I left out? Lee  </s>
<s> Sorry I wasn't clear.  </s>
<s> I don't mind that there exists a non-proprietary method as long as there is also the ability to create proprietary methods.  </s>
<s> In fact I favour it.  </s>
<s> I think it would be good if we could agree on a default standardized method.  </s>
<s> But don't think that the existence of PUBLIC in the grammar should be tied to our figuring out a resolution mechanism for them.  </s>
<s> You and I agree that XML documents can be interchanged without a well defined public identifier resolution mechanism (using system).  </s>
<s> You seem to believe that leaving PUBLIC in the grammar without a resolution mechanism will inevitably lead to interoperability, and I don't believe that.  </s>
<s> I think that it will just lead to people using public identifiers in prearranged systems and system identifiers on the Web.  </s>
<s> I believe that PUBLIC is useful without a well defined resolution mechanism, through pre-arranged conventions and systems, and you may not believe that.  </s>
<s> Or, to put it another way: in the days before SOCAT, would it have been better to have no public identifier mechanism at all?  </s>
<s> I certainly used it before there was a well defined mechanism.  </s>
<s> Author/Editor, in particular had/has a very powerful mapping format that does many things that SOCAT does not.  </s>
<s> Paul Prescod  </s>
<s> Your proposal sounds okay to me, except for one thing: 1] if there is a processing instruction tht occurs before the DOCTYPE line of the form ?-XML-CATALOG "system-id"?  </s>
<s> then that is the system identifier of the catalog and all other mechanisms are disregarded.  </s>
<s> Why can't this be a relative URL?  </s>
<s> Paul Prescod  </s>
