<s> Oops, that last one was 404'ed.  </s>
<s> Yeah I mistyped; it's: Kendall  </s>
<s> woohoo! Hmm... the summary extracted by the W3C Comm team and hence read by a bzillion homepage visitors is: "The document outlines use cases for RDF query languages and access protocols and their requirements, and examines design objectives." -- http://www.w3.org/News/2004#item85 which is true but not very exciting.  </s>
<s> I would have liked to see the words "product metadata" and "publishing" or "syndication" and "photos" bubble up into the widely-read summary.  </s>
<s> Let's help them out next time by working them into the abstract, ok, Kendall?  </s>

<s> I tweaked the live copy to point to it to make the relationship somewhat clear: $Revision: 1.109 $ of $Date: 2004/06/07 16:09:02 I also made the $Revision$ and $Date$ of the live version visible.  </s>
<s> Oh, and while I'm at it, made the $Log$ of changes since the /TR/ version visible in the status section.  </s>
