<s> Hi Randal,  </s>
<s> The case of Hooks v OKBridge is kind of complicated.  </s>
<s> The quotes that you included are not from the decision - there never was one, the matter was, I think, dismissed by the court on other grounds.  </s>
<s> What you were quoting from was the letter from the Department of Justice which is automatically consulted for an opinion as to what the law is (again my memory is hazy - it could have been a different department).  </s>
<s> As such their submission to the court stated that they thought a Web site did come within the ADA and I believe that these submissions are legally binding statements of the law, which the court would then have to follow.  </s>
<s> However, because the case was dismissed by the court later on in proceedings, this DoJ submission is not legally binding as the court never had the opportunity to follow it and adopt it.  </s>
<s> Had the case not been dismissed then it would probably have been America's Maguire v SOCOG.  </s>
<s> However, at least we now know that if and when the DoJ is asked again for its opinion we can probably guess what it'll be.  </s>
<s> The DoJ's view partly relies on an earlier case called Carparts v Automotive Wholesalers of New England (http://harp.org/carparts.txt) which was the case which decided that for the purposes of the ADA there was no reason to differentiate between a service provider that operated out of a shop and one who was telephone-based.  </s>

<s> Hi Jason, I don't know of many cases which discuss the definition of 'undue burden' except for SOCOG (see more general advice the UK the Code of Practice is an excellent resource and is designed to give service providers guidance and advice on what is likely to be held to be reasonable and what is not - see chapters four and five.  </s>

<s> There is an often-cited Australian case in which Telstra (who may have then been called Telecom Australia still) was the defendent, which discussed the question of "undue burden".  </s>
<s> The actual case was about whether they had an obligation tyo provide TTY phones at the same price as standard handsets - the result was that tey did, and that the price (a large amount of mone, but a very small proportional increase in what they would charge each client) of doing so was not un undue burden.  </s>
