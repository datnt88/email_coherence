Hi Joseph and P3P members, I would like to ask help from everybody. 
I am now planning to conduct a *little* survey about Web service security and privacy at the 2003 International Conference on Web Services (ICWS'03) at Las Vegas in coming June. 
The ICWS'03 is one of the conferences held in the 2003 International Multiconference in Computer Science &amp; Engineering (http://www.ashland.edu/~iajwa/conferences/). The tentative motivation of this little survey is to get some info. 
about what are the views, suggestions and opinions about security and privacy issues from the Web service research community. 
Based on the info., the results are expected to help developing the strategic plans for related research activities. 
I am trying to draft the questions for the Web services privacy part on the questionnaire, and I think that this *may* be an opportunity for "P3P Beyond HTTP Task Force" or even P3P to get a *little* picture about what are Web service researchers thinking about privcay policies. 
Thus, may I ask for your support and help to do brainstorming with me? 
Here are some tentative questions that popping out from my mind so far. 
Would you please take a look and tell me your comments or even suggest other questions? 
No matter it is related to the "P3P Beyond HTTP Task Force" or not. 
Web Service Privacy Do you know the Platform for Privacy Preferences (P3P) Project at the W3C? 
Yes, No, Don't know. 
Do you know the two major concepts in P3P: User Preferences and Privacy Policies? 
Yes, No, Don't know. 
Do you know that P3P is recommended for Web service privacy policies? 
Yes, No, Don't know. 
Do you concern whether Web service providers express privacy policies? 
Yes, No, Don't care. 
Do you think that UDDI registries should contain privacy policies for Web services as an option? 
Yes, No, Not Sure. 
Do you think that WSDL documents should also contain privacy policies for Web service as an option? 
Yes, No, Not Sure. 
Do you think that privacy issues should be resolved before an interaction before Web service requestor and provider? 
Yes, No, Not Sure. 
Thank you very much for your kind attention and your comment/suggestion is highly appreciated. 
Cheers, Patrick. 
Patrick, I'm not sure what you will learn from a survey like this. 
From my experience talking to web services folks in the past, most of them don't know much about privacy policies and so their opinions are not going to be all that enlightening. 
If there is a session where they would first be informed about these issues and then surveyed, perhaps a BOF or something, then a survey like this would be more useful I think.

Dear Lorrie, Thanks a lot for your comments. 
I will take them and try to decide a more practical approach to conduct such a survey. 
I will also check the "An Analysis of P3P Deployment on Commercial, Government, and Children's Web Sites as of May 2003" report. 
I will definitely ask for your comments/suggestions again. 
Cheers, Patrick.

Hi Joseph and Lorrie, Thanks a lot for your comments. 
Based on different business categories of the ICWS'03 attendees (Question 1), the major purpose of this little survey is to learn: (a) How many attendees are working on Web services implementation? 
(Question 2) (b) Referring to some previous results, how many of them still agree that security issues are the biggest obstacles to Web services implementation? 
(Question 3) (c) How many of them are aware of privacy issues or P3P in Web services? 
(Question 4, 5, and 6) I am trying to revise the questionnaire as follows: 1. Which business category you are belonging to? 
* Industry. 
* Academia. 
* Government. 
* Non-profit Organization. 
* Others. 
Please specify: ___________________ 2. Are you involved in any Web services implementation in these years? 
* Yes. 
* No. 3. Do you agree that security issues (e.g., authentication, authorization, and etc) are the biggest obstacles to Web services implementation? 
* Yes. 
* No. * Not Sure. 
4. Are you aware of privacy issues (e.g., privacy policies) in Web services implementation? 
* Yes. 
* No. * Don't Know. 5. Have you ever heard the Platform for Privacy Preferences (P3P) Project at the W3C? 
* Yes. 
* No. * Not Sure. 
6. Have you ever heard any research topic about P3P and Web services? 
* Yes. 
* No. * Not Sure. 
Any comment/suggestion is highly appreciated. 
Thanks a lot again! 
Patrick.
