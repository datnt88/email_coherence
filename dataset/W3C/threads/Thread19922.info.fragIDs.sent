<s> Hi! Now there is the option to switch between editor and browse modes.  </s>
<s> The next logical step would be to allow a single click to enter a link in browse mode, just like the other browsers do.  </s>
<s> Or is there some reason not to do so?  </s>

<s> Uh oh... ;-) We debated this a few weeks ago and it turned into a completely unnecessary religious debate about how we like our window manager's set up, etc etc. Basically, the two opposing views are: 1) The GUI should be uniform across the two modes, so if we have double-click in editor mode, it should be double-click in browser mode too.  </s>
<s> 2) Single click would be nice, and it is worth breaking aforementioned uniformity to do so.  </s>
<s> Personally, I think it should be possible to place such a decision at the door of the end user, but no development, AFAIK, is being done in that direction at the moment.  </s>
<s> I don't think any more debate along these lines is necessary - the two opinions mentioned above are irreconcilable.  </s>

<s> I agree that it is a bit of a religious argument.  </s>
<s> Personally I prefer having the User interfacce consistent within the tool.  </s>
<s> (But then, I don't use the 'read-only' feature, which is what the browse mode is.) Exposing the function to the user would be nice for those who want to split it.  </s>
<s> I am not sure if it is currently one of the functions which can be configured - check the help page.  </s>
