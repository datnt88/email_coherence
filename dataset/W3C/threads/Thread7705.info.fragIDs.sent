<s> This one isn't easy.  </s>
<s> As I discussed previously (http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-dist-auth/1998OctDec/0303.html), it is my personal opinion that the reasons for live properties have to do with performance issues with HTTP.  </s>
<s> It made us do something that I now believe has very serious ramifications on the ability of people to innovate using HTTP and upon the future extensibility of the protocol.  </s>
<s> So how does one make the trade off?  </s>
<s> Until we fix HTTP I guess the answer is fairly obvious.  </s>
<s> Who cares if you have a perfect protocol if no one can efficiently implement it?  </s>
<s> Maybe we will fix this next time.  </s>
<s> In the meantime, if I was designing a WebDAV extension I would do my best to stay away from using properties.  </s>
<s> If you can't, you can't.  </s>
<s> But I bet in most cases, you can.  </s>

<s> This suggests to me that the behavior of a live property on COPY is a quality of the property, rather than a quality of the server.  </s>
<s> Hence, the COPY behavior of a live property should be specified on a per-property basis.  </s>

<s> The discussion has assumed there are two kinds of live properties, "standard" and "non-standard".  </s>
<s> There is a third class: those which are registered (via an, as-yet unspecified, registration process) with a concrete description of their syntax and semantics.  </s>
<s> Lisa Lippert's presentation in Orlando on a class of new live properties suggests to me that such a registration process is necessary.  </s>
<s> Registered properties will allow for interoperation, since client/server pairs can implement the property according to the same semantics, yet not require the effort required to create community consensus around a set of properties.  </s>

<s> Uhhhhh.... If this wasn't a major operational problem, why didn't we just close the working group and use FrontPage extensions?  </s>
