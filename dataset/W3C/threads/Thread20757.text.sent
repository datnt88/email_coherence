Using Amaya5.2a, Win98, in browser mode: I go to our website at and it picks up the colours correctly from the stylesheet. 
How do I get at the alternate stylesheets I have defined? 
Is this not implemented yet? 
Also, when I select text with the mouse, eg from the URL window it does not seem to end up in the clipboard. 
Finally, when I go to that doc I get a dialogue box saying: With the current Amaya profile: XHTML 1.0 Transitional [Editor] Editing and saving this document will change its type [Confirm] * I cannot set the profile to be HTML 4.01 -- I only seem to have access to XHTML profiles. 
Is this correct? 
* This is a warning message, telling me of something I don't want. 
I don't really want to Confirm this. 
Maybe the button should be called "Done"? 
* I cannot save this document because it is on another machine which won't allow this. 
Could Amaya detect this, so it doesn't tell me about consequences of things I cannot do anyway? 
I don't know if the protocols can detect this. 
Thank you, Hugh Right it's not implemented yet. 
The message warns you that you can potentially edit and re-publish this document with a different document type. 
In this particular case the document type is strict and your editing profile is transitional (no warnings appears when you're using a browsing profile). 
In the future we plan to handle the Amaya profile document by document. 
But meanwhile we prefer to inform the user of potential alteration of documents even if eighty percent of times he doesn't plan to edit the document. 
You confirm that you've read the message. 
Done works too. 
I don't know too. 
Even if Amaya can detect that you are not allowed to save the document on the machine it comes from, there is a problem: you can save that document somewhere else (at least on your local file system), and if you do that you need to know that the document will be changed. 
OK, then maybe it should tell me this when I save or when I change anything, not when I just read it. 
There will be enough times when I only want to read. 
Eg, navigating to the doc I want to change. 
If I save but don't change anything before saving, perhaps Amaya could allow me to choose whether I save the original or the Amaya-changed doc as well. 
(Then I could use both, then diff to see what Amaya has changed).
