Hi, The current Amaya release procedure could be improved if deadlines for contributions were stated somewhere. 
Amaya team should take into account that the translation of messages and help files should be done after English version is frozen. 
I suggest the following procedure: Day 1: Pre-release. 
Announce the number of days for pre-release testing (a week at least, say n1) Day 1+n1: Pre-release testing ends. 
Day 1+n1+1: English version freeze. 
Announce the number of days for translation (2 or 3 days, say n2) Day 1+n2+1+n2: Translation freeze. 
Day 1+n2+1+n2+1: Release. 
Best regards, Bartolom?

On Thu, 13 Nov 2003 19:32:08 +0100 We can publish new translations after the Amaya release is done as translations are delivered in separate files (amayadoc-8.2.tgz and amayadoc-8.2.exe). 
What date would you propose for a new version of the documentation.
