Hi folks, the Authoring Tools group is planning to refer to the ERT document as covering techniques for Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines checkpoints 4.1 and 4.2. 
On the one hand, this means that you can expect us to provide good careful review of the ERT document. 
On the other hand, this means we are hoping that a working draft be published in a stable place as soon as possible. 
We are anticipating releasing a new Public version o the Techniques Note by 20 March, and if possible would like to have some kind of stable reference in that. 
If not, what should we use as a reference to the latest publicly available draft (of course we will have to provide a disclaimer while it is only in working draft stage)?

The latest ERT is always available from: http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/IG/ert/ 
The earliest that I think we can release a public working draft is 28 March. 
Here's the timeline I think we are working under: 1. 
I will release a new working draft later today. 
2. The group should review the draft in its entirety Wednesday through monday 13 March. 
3. We ought to discuss it at our 13 March meeting and decide to invite others to review. 
4. If all is well, on Monday or Tuesday (13 or 14 March) we will invite IG, AU, and WCAG to review for 2 weeks. 
5. We ought to discuss comments from IG, AU, and WCAG at our 20 and 27 March meeting. 
6. 
If all is well, we will release a public working draft on 28 March. 
I will not be able to attend the 27 March meeting as I will be traveling home from CSUN. 
I will also not be able to attend the 20 March meeting as I will be attending the WCAG face2face meeting in L.A. I don't think that has to put a damper on our plans. 
Perhaps we give people 3 weeks to review instead? 
thoughts?

Crossposted to WAI AU and WAI ER Thanks Wendy. 
From the perspective of AU, having a first public working draft will help us to give it a fixed position in the Techniques document. 
We had hoped to have a new version of that published in the next couple of weeks, so further review time for the first draft is probably not as valuable to us as having it published. 
(But I have not yet discussed that with the working group).
