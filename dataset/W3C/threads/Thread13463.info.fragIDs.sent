<s> Hi folks, the Authoring Tools group is planning to refer to the ERT document as covering techniques for Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines checkpoints 4.1 and 4.2.  </s>
<s> On the one hand, this means that you can expect us to provide good careful review of the ERT document.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, this means we are hoping that a working draft be published in a stable place as soon as possible.  </s>
<s> We are anticipating releasing a new Public version o the Techniques Note by 20 March, and if possible would like to have some kind of stable reference in that.  </s>
<s> If not, what should we use as a reference to the latest publicly available draft (of course we will have to provide a disclaimer while it is only in working draft stage)?  </s>

<s> The latest ERT is always available from: http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/IG/ert/  </s>
<s> The earliest that I think we can release a public working draft is 28 March.  </s>
<s> Here's the timeline I think we are working under: 1.  </s>
<s> I will release a new working draft later today.  </s>
<s> 2. The group should review the draft in its entirety Wednesday through monday 13 March.  </s>
<s> 3. We ought to discuss it at our 13 March meeting and decide to invite others to review.  </s>
<s> 4. If all is well, on Monday or Tuesday (13 or 14 March) we will invite IG, AU, and WCAG to review for 2 weeks.  </s>
<s> 5. We ought to discuss comments from IG, AU, and WCAG at our 20 and 27 March meeting.  </s>
<s> 6.  </s>
<s> If all is well, we will release a public working draft on 28 March.  </s>
<s> I will not be able to attend the 27 March meeting as I will be traveling home from CSUN.  </s>
<s> I will also not be able to attend the 20 March meeting as I will be attending the WCAG face2face meeting in L.A. I don't think that has to put a damper on our plans.  </s>
<s> Perhaps we give people 3 weeks to review instead?  </s>

<s> Crossposted to WAI AU and WAI ER Thanks Wendy.  </s>
<s> From the perspective of AU, having a first public working draft will help us to give it a fixed position in the Techniques document.  </s>
<s> We had hoped to have a new version of that published in the next couple of weeks, so further review time for the first draft is probably not as valuable to us as having it published.  </s>
<s> (But I have not yet discussed that with the working group).  </s>
