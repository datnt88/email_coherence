Dear All, Ignoring any other accessibility problems (for the moment) with the page at URL: What are the techniques for making maps (in this case the indoor booth layout for a trade show) accessible? 
I think the authors have taken a decent shot at it, but I am sure they would welcome constructive criticism. 
The PDF, of course, is not very useful. 
You can take a look yourself at URL: .com/pdf/floorplan.pdf Which will return booth numbers and list the names of vendors, but not any relationship to each other. 
The Excel document I think is interesting. 
Spreadsheets are, of course, in general considered accessible so I don't think this is a bad approach in and of itself. 
With a screen reader, one can learn the booth numbers and their relationship with each other. 
Each cell has been resized to be a perfect square, so a nice grid arrangement is presented. 
The authors have conveyed information with color (for example a cell filled with color is occupied, where white is, usually but not always, vacant). 
Walls are show by cell borders and the occasional free hand line. 
All of this information, even if not totally invisible to the screen reader, is functionally useless because it is just too much work to find out what a cell border setting is. 
More regrettably, the names of vendors are put in as little floating text labels. 
It is not clear to me at all how one accesses those without a mouse, and I suspect they are effectively hidden from a screen reader. 
But what is a better solution? 
Is a fixed pitch line drawing consider accessible? 
I have seen some nice embossed maps, but how does one capture that in html? 
I have seen good textual descriptions of fairly complex graphs and charts, but a map is not nearly the same thing! 
If you got them, please supply URLs that show how traditional maps have been made accessible. 
Thank you, Bruce have you done any additional research? 
If so, what have your findings been? 
Does for instance the exhibit plan at csun meet your needs, how about closing the gap?

---sig off--- Dave, I have done precious little research. 
My experience has been limited tactile maps and live on-site orientation. 
Do you have URLs for what CSUN or CTG has done? 
I am not familiar with what they do ahead of time. 
More important than "does the exhibit plan meet MY needs" (as an organizer) is the question of "does the exhibit plan meet YOUR needs" (as a blind attendee). 
Have you EVER gotten a TEXTUAL (or otherwise electronic) exhibit plan ahead of time that was functional for you? 
If so, could you send it to me (or the list)? 
Thanks, Bruce On Monday, November 22, 1999 7:58 AM, David Poehlman [snip] Take this floorplan to someone who is a qualified orientation and navigation trainer for the blind. 
The root problem is that the nomenclature for identifying booths is bad. 
It is not consistent nor is it two-dimensional. 
If booths had a consistent (e.g. letter-number) designation that located them in a regular set of location coordinates, then the answer to "which booth am I at" would have orientation value. 
As it is the floor is totally chaotic and I would have to go to an orientation and navigation professional to find "the end of the string" to try to fix this. 
From my amateur perspective, for orientation and navigation purposes the floor is a structure formed of aisles, not booths. 
In the information presented in the Excel or .PDF graphics, there is no articulated structure to the aisles, just anecdotal annotations where there are booth clusters. 
The floor planners need to develop an aislewise index to _all the aisle/booth interfaces_ where visitors may access the booths. 
With that one could offer an access guide for a blind visitor. 
The best general solution I could offer you for maps at this time is to distill the map information into a geographical information system and lay a wayfinding application over the information in the GIS. 
Al I'm going to get killed for saying this, but all we need is a text file with boothnumbers, urls and email addresses and an explanation of the company/exhibitor. 
I don't think I could fathom any floor plan that was done electronically or If I could, it would take a darn lot of reading. 
Here is a sketch of a way to do it though. 
each set of coordinates has a link whose name is that of the booth holder/occupant. 
going to that link, you find where it is and its number. 
for instance, it is on the far left isle or the second isle from the left facing the back of the floor. 
its booth number is: xxxx and it holds -------- within and any other pertenant info. 
in the same way, you can have links to front egress, rear egress, left and right egresses and other points of interest as well such as restrooms and floor transits. 
links to the exhiborts web sites and email addresses phone numbers and postal addresses would all be in each vendors information followed from their link or on a list to which it points. 
tactile maps at best are clunky and often it is easy to become disoriented because there are no real landmarks on the floor to indicate yourprecice location as you are moving around the floor unless you can smell popcorn or hear something or ask someone. 
I hope I'm getting this across well. 
it would even be cool to have this set up in some sort of real time fashion so we could drop in on live action at a booth or workshop.

---sig off--- Al, You make some good points. 
*NEXT* year I will have to see if they can implement a strict Euclidean X,Y coordinate scheme for booth assignment. 
There is a committee that is working to assure that there are volunteers to meet attendees who are blind. 
These folks won't be orientation and mobility specialist though. 
You might be on to something with your idea for an "aislewise index" to the floorplan. 
Can you point me to some example? 
This work will NOT be done by the "floor planners" but after the fact. 
But jeez: lay Do you think we will be handing out laptops and portable Global Positioning Systems at the door? 
-- Bruce Have you thought about talking signs? 
(I can't use pdfs on this machine, so I can't see the layout either).

W3C Web Accessibility Initiative http://www.w3.org/WAI MIT/LCS - 545 Technology sq., Cambridge MA, 02139, USA Out of curiosity as a sighted person, I just tried The vOICe sonification browser directly on the floor plan graphic referred to by Bruce and available as a JPEG image at the image URL and indeed found that this complicated irregular map was impossible to understand or navigate effectively via its soundscape. 
That was to be expected, of course. 
Still, that said, it was funny to hear the huge amount of visual detail by first pressing function key F5 for inverse video (to switch to white lines on a black background), and then pressing Shift F4 for fourfold digital zoom, after which I could use the arrow keys to move in small steps around the whole map. 
The exhibition border line near the top left runs upward at a 45 degree angle, resulting in corresponding upward tone sweeps in the soundscapes, rather than the very brief noise bursts of vertical line segments and constant-pitch tones of horizontal line line segments that make up most of this map. 
Something else I played with was to audibly highlight the blue route (blue line) that runs overlaid across this map image. 
Switching back to positive video again with toggle F5, and then pressing Shift Alt b to hear out any blue items, I could get a gross idea of the shape of this particular route along the booths. 
At the fourfold zoom level, I could track the course of this blue route as it went up, right, up, left, up, left, down, left, down, and finally left to one particular booth destination, or so it seemed. 
Most probably not useful to you, for sure, but nice to play with. 
This color filter option filters out anything that is not blue. 
Similar filter options are available for other basic colors. 
If the map image had been suitably tagged with tiny spectrograms of booth names or ID's, it might have been more accessible: you would have heard booth names or ID's spoken on your left and right and at low and high pitch in the soundscapes as you move around the image with the arrow keys. 
It would be a bit like navigating a virtual space. 
As you would press the up arrow key, you would then hear existing booth names or ID's go down in pitch while new booth names or ID's would pop into the view at a high pitch. 
Similarly, pressing left would make the name or ID on the left move to the right, shifting whatever was on the right out of the view, while a new name or ID would slide into view on the left side. 
Gosh, I feel tempted to create an example of such a map one day, although I must admit that I have no particular interest in maps. 
Note: apart from using the sonification browser, one can also first download the image via other means, and then use the file requester of The vOICe Learning Edition via Control O to import the image and hear its soundscape, zoom in, move around and so on. 
Best wishes, Peter Meijer Soundscapes from The vOICe - Seeing with your Ears! Talking signs would help the visitor to the show. 
Doesn't help the visitor to the website. 
I suppose you could annotate the map of the show floor with the audio messages the signs transmit.
