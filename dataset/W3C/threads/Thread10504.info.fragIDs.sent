<s> Maybe it would be convenient, but I think any response should point out (and Concepts is quite clear about this [2]) that any particular representation of bnodes is always an artefact of the particular syntax used.  </s>
<s> When reading any syntax that uses bnode identifiers, applications must always be prepared to re-allocate the identifiers.  </s>
<s> I might even argue that having different syntax for N-triples and RDF/XML is (almost) a Good Thing, since it reinforces this point.  </s>

<s> Suggested response is: In RDF/XML it would be unnatural to restrict bnode identifiers to US ASCII.  </s>
<s> This would prevent document authors from using bnode IDs with mnemonic identifiers in Thai for example.  </s>
<s> Given the goals of N-triple - a testing language, the restriction to US-ASCII is well-motivated.  </s>
<s> Thus it is not possible to align the two concepts while being faithful to the design goals of the two languages.  </s>
<s> It would be better to quote from the docs - I suspect there's a suitable piece about Ntriple being in US ASCII.  </s>

<s> Why not just tweak Ntriples to allow all of ASCII?  </s>
<s> That wouldn't break any of our stuff and it would be generally good-citizen-ish.  </s>

<s> If you are generating identifiers and wish them to be interoperable between RDF/XML and NTriple it can be done in either case (generate Ntriple ids) If you are reading in RDF/XML and wisht to use the identifiers in Ntriple it can't be done in either case.  </s>

<s> Thats because RDF/XML allows internationalized characters and NTriples does not, yes?  </s>

<s> I was sure there was a reason and was waiting for it to appear.  </s>
<s> I expect a response, probably from Dave, along the lines of: - lunch ain't free - because RDF/XML is not restricted to US ascii, but permits international characters, an implementation must do some processing to translate RDF/XML bnode ID's to b-triples bnode IDs - the n-triple b-node id's are designed to be compatible with N3 as some implementations use N3 processors should put this one to bed.  </s>

<s> I've replied to the commentor, explaining why it's not possible, or unwise to unify these.  </s>
