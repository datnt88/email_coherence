Hi. I am running YellowDog Linux (kernel 2.2.6-16bpmac) on a PowerPC 603e chip. 
I obtained, configured, compiled, and installed LessTif (v 0.91) without incident. 
I then obtained the source code for Amaya (amaya-src-3.1.tar.gz). 
I followed the directions outlined in the README.amaya. 
The configure, compile, and install seemed to go without incident. 
However, when I attempted to run Amaya, I got the following message: amaya: error in loading shared libraries: libXm.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory I checked the Options file used during the make only to find that all necessary paths were correct. 
The LessTif install designated libXm.so.1 as a link to libXm.so.1.0.2. 
As a test, I copied the actual file as libXm.so.1 but I still encountered the above error. 
Please note that this dependency error also kept me from installing a precompiled version of Amaya 2.1 from an rpm. 
Am I doing something wrong? 
Any help is appreciated. 
Thanks. 
[ Note: it's www-amaya@w3.org 
not www-amaya@w3c.org ... ] I dunno what you are doing wrong, if any. 
For some reason the shared libray loader either don't find libXm.so.1 or can't load it, see the man page of ldconfig for more informations. 
Here is what I suggest: - Install the PPC version of OpenMotif: You may have to remove lesstif first to avoid file conflicts ... rpm -i ftp://rpmfind.net/linux/linuxPPC/contrib/software/Libraries/X11/openmotif-2.1.30-1.ppc.rpm - grab the latests amaya sources RPM ftp://rpmfind.net/pub/amaya/amaya-3.2-1.src.rpm - then as root, try a rebuild: rpm --rebuild amaya-3.2-1.src.rpm - if this works that generates an amaya-3.2-1.ppc.rpm install it - if the amaya binary produced works, either upload it to linux PPC contrib site or send me a mail so I get it to install it at ftp://rpmfind.net/pub/amaya/ Daniel Daniel.Veillard@w3.org | W3C, INRIA Rhone-Alpes | Today's Bookmarks : Tel : +33 476 615 257 | 655, avenue de l'Europe | Linux XML libxml WWW Thanks Daniel for pointing me in the right direction. 
I finally got everything working. 
I uninstalled LessTif, installed OpenMotif, and rebuilt Amay using the latest source code. 
When the resultant amaya binary was installed and run, I encountered the same basic error--this time referring to libXm.so.2. 
I then investigated ldconfig. 
The man page for ldconfig mentioned a file /etc/ld.so.conf. 
I noticed the directory path containing the motif lib was missing. 
I added the entry, and tried again--same result. 
The last thing I did was issue /sbin/ldconfig -v. 
This forced a reload of the shared libraries and directories. 
After command completion, I could execute the amaya binary.
