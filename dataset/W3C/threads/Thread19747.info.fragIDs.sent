<s> How do I run Amaya on Windows NT? I've downloaded the archive and unpacked it.  </s>
<s> I haven't found any instructions (either on the site or in the archive) that suggest I need to do anything else.  </s>
<s> But when I try to run Amaya.exe,  </s>
<s> nothing happens.  </s>
<s> (Watching in Task Manager shows that it runs for a few seconds and then goes away.)  </s>
<s> If it's any help: System is NT Workstation 4, service pack 3; hardware is P/100, 40 MB RAM.  </s>

<s> Do you try to start Amaya on a local page ?  </s>
<s> To do so, please edit the file Thot/config/THOT.INI and add the name of a local page in the line HOME_PAGE like HOME_PAGE=c:\Thot\amaya\HOTLIST.HTML  </s>
<s> In the current release, Amaya tries to fetch the initial page through the Net and if it meets problems with the Net, it crashes.  </s>
<s> In next release there'll be a local welcome page.  </s>
<s> Hope this hepls Irene.  </s>
<s> I've tried that, but it doesn't make any difference.  </s>
<s> It still won't run.  </s>

<s> Could you check that the directory c:\tmp exists.  </s>
<s> If it doesn't exist Amaya cannot start.  </s>
<s> Next Monday, we'll publish a new public release 1.1b.  </s>
<s> I hope this release will solve your problem.  </s>

<s> Yes, it exists.  </s>
<s> OK, I'll give that a try.  </s>
