<s> EARL DD need stable W3C uri for this info.  </s>
<s> Need it in RDF.  </s>
<s> WC Want me to copy what he has from infomesh to W3C? DD Existing infomesh page that presents EARL as of a month ago.  </s>
<s> Has good background info.  </s>
<s> Needs to be cleaned up.  </s>
<s> Use that as a basis for EARL.  </s>
<s> Merge that with what Sean put up at infomesh.net/2001/earl/0.9 DD Once we have that, which groups do we publicize this to?  </s>

<s> /* sean joins */ DD page not saved as HTML, get e-mail?  </s>
<s> SP Looked into that.  </s>
<s> Something w/your browser?  </s>
<s> DD Doesn't matter, WC will take that plus old page and merge them into something... SP I've already done that.  </s>
<s> I've folded in 0.9 page into old page.  </s>
<s> Haven't been able to upload it yet.  </s>
<s> DD We'll put the RDF version at the URI you proposed.  </s>
<s> SP Still waiting for SW IG to give word on stability of N3. DD Yes, some discussion about that.  </s>
<s> Some people not in favor, some said useful.  </s>
<s> SP Yes, division.  </s>
<s> Danbri doesn't like it.  </s>
<s> DD Once we've done that I will announce it to various lists so people can play with it.  </s>
<s> then see where it goes from there.  </s>
<s> do you need more time to polish stuff?  </s>
<s> we gave you write access to some portion.  </s>
<s> SP Yes, I have access to 2001/03/earl.  </s>
<s> Action SP: upload earl stuff to w3c site.  </s>
<s> SP Need someone to change ACLs.  </s>
<s> Action WC: change ACLs once get word from SP. SP Talking with Aaron about it last night.  </s>
<s> We've been working on it all weekend.  </s>
<s> We've been using Daniel's model, but it is difficult to express in RDF.  </s>
<s> There are so many ways to do it.  </s>
<s> Don't know if it is optimal.  </s>
<s> Not too certain that the model can be converted to XML RDF since there are complications with context brackets.  </s>
<s> Not sure how they get represetned in  </s>
<s> RDF. There are bugs, that might be one in the schema.  </s>
<s> However, should be stable enough to implement.  </s>
<s> Tools implement in N3 or RDF?  </s>
<s> DD I don't care.  </s>
<s> I find N3 easier to read, but not that much.  </s>
<s> RDF/XML syntax, we could then use XSLT and make it into something more readable (using verbs and sugar).  </s>
<s> N3 forces you into either a transformation into  </s>
<s> RDF and then into HTML.  </s>
<s> It's another step for human consumption.  </s>
<s> There was discussion about "is there a 1 to 1 mapping between XML/RDF."  </s>
<s> From unicode, it is not the case.  </s>
<s> Perhaps N3 can be fixed.  </s>
<s> SP It's been changing a bit lately.  </s>
<s> Some unicode support, but limited to python support.  </s>
<s> It can never be completely compatible with XML/RDF.  </s>
<s> As long as the model is expressed.  </s>
<s> Have people looked at the diagrams?  </s>
<s> DD Yep, look good.  </s>
<s> SP Used WebDraw.  </s>
<s> DD is that the aaron simplified model?  </s>
<s> SP Yes.  </s>
<s> Hard for me to grasp what he's been doing.  </s>
<s> Have a node hanging off of test subject.  </s>
<s> He's using as a property.  </s>
<s> There are comments in the examples.  </s>
<s> It hides the semantics we're trying to express.  </s>
<s> Those should only  </s>
<s> be things that will not be machine processed.  </s>
<s> I should write more documentation on that.  </s>
<s> DD We made a timeline, first an example, then work on some by hand.  </s>
<s> We need to work according to this plan.  </s>
<s> We need to look for more comprehensive example by hand.  </s>
<s> Then have a tool generate.  </s>
<s> CMN started looking at  </s>
<s> something.  </s>
<s> Perhaps WAVE or Bobby can do something quickly.  </s>
<s> As well as HTML or CSS validator.  </s>
<s> SP I cc'ed the schema to validator people.  </s>
<s> They seem quite interested.  </s>
<s> F2F WC LK won't be able to attend.  </s>
<s> CR I can attend.  </s>
<s> WC Unlikely that SP will attend.  </s>
<s> DD We need to have a clear target for the meeting.  </s>
<s> CMN and I will be there.  </s>
<s> We could ask DanBri to come.  </s>
<s> HB?  </s>
<s> I doubt WL will be there.  </s>
<s> Do you think WCAG or ATAG meeting would join?  </s>
<s> One reason to meet in Amsterdam is XForms and HTML.  </s>
<s> We should join them at some point.  </s>
<s> We could identify a day to meet with them.  </s>
<s> 1/2 day for each.  </s>
<s> Already consumed a day of joint meeting, mostly for WCAG.  </s>
<s> WC Anticipated agenda?  </s>
<s> DD Requirements for XHTML 2. More along line of PF in a sense.  </s>
<s> WC Joint PF/ER meeting was good in December, good discussion on EARL.  </s>
<s> DD What is the benefit for WCAG or ATAG to meet in Amsterdam on those days?  </s>
<s> Other than meeting own.  </s>
<s> WC Have them review our new techniques documents.  </s>
<s> DD As far as ERT is concerned, we might as well wait for PF/ERT opportunity.  </s>
<s> WC Maybe best to hold off until we know we have a prototype.  </s>
<s> CR Any news on when WCAG 2 will be done?  </s>
<s> WC Nope.  </s>
<s> Shooting for something stable by end of the year.  </s>
<s> DD What about WCAG?  </s>
<s> WC Haven't heard from Gregg yet.  </s>
<s> Need a meeting, especially since we can get Dundee folks there to talk about usability testing.  </s>
<s> Perhaps informal, but to talk about usability testing.  </s>
<s> DD What is a good overlap with xforms?  </s>
<s> middle of the week?  </s>
<s> 20/21 then people who want to go to xform come a day early, those who want to stay for xhtml can stay a day later.20/21  </s>
<s> for WCAG, ATAG can go on either side of that.  </s>
<s> Proposal: ERT wait to meet with PF, something in June in Amsterdam doesn't work for ERT.  </s>
<s> Next meeting DD No meeting next week since meetings in Hong Kong.  </s>
<s> Resolved: next meeting 7 May.  </s>

<s> Also available are the schemas, diagrams, and examples for 0.9, all linked from:- - 5.0 EARL 0.9 The namespace for EARL 0.9 also references the RDF Schema, thanks to the wonder that is the Apache (er... or Jigsaw) file extension hack:- Now for the implementation...

<s> Before we start publicizing this stuff.  </s>
<s> At the PF f2f, we also discussed the fact that Repair in EARL were sort of "not core", and so maybe the correct expansion of the acronym should be  </s>
<s> EARL: Evaluation and Reporting Language.  </s>
<s> What do people think ?  </s>
<s> I think it's still time to change it but later on it will be more problematic.  </s>
<s> Why are you saying repair is not core?  </s>
<s> Personally speaking at least, I think it's an important part of EARL.  </s>
<s> For  </s>
<s> example, if I'm evaluating a web page, and I see some poorly worded ALT text, I'd certainly want to have a way to suggest better ALT text.  </s>
<s> And once I do that, the output can be used for repair.  </s>
<s> Repair has been in the user scenarios for months... e.g. see the part starting at http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/IG/earl.html#evaluation .  </s>

<s> Hmmm. What sort of information would be "how to repair" it.  </s>
<s> For example, if the ALT text of an image is "horse" and EARL specifies that the ALT text should be "cow", you're saying that's not "repair information".  </s>

<s> (brainstorming) I suppose you could include something like a XSLT snippet to perform the appropriate transformation?  </s>
<s> Or something similar?  </s>
<s> A language that describes the steps necessary to change/fix a piece of markup.  </s>
<s> --Kynn Kynn Bartlett kynn@idyllmtn.com  </s>
<s> For a simple alt, the repair info may well be included in the evaluator comments (at the semantics level at least), but for something more complex, there's a need for additional markup/annotation.  </s>
<s> Take the case of a page that uses FONT, COLOR, EARL would have a note to the effect of saying: use CSS instead, but the real repair is a complete mapping (xslt is one option) of FONT, COLOR to css properties.  </s>
<s> In short, I think repair needs more support at the rdf level (like other application domains), and earl should go out without it to serve more groups.  </s>
<s> I agree with Daniel.  </s>
<s> Repair is n the sscenarios, but we don't have a framework yet for how to express it in the language - the best we have got is a single pointer to "repair information" whatever that is, and I argue that is not enough to be very useful.  </s>
<s> We are better assuming that repair information is something we will owrk on next (if we don't work on a language fro describibng tests) Charles McCN  </s>

<s> The need for the language was not only to report the results of evaluations but the results of repairs.  </s>
<s> Therefore to report: - repairs that have been performed as well as those that have not yet been performed - results of evaluations they have manually performed on the content as well as results of automatic tests.  </s>
<s> Therefore, "reporting of repairs" whether they exist in the past or future.  </s>
<s> We "report" info on both evaluations and repairs.  </s>
<s> Or perhaps just "reporting language."  </s>
<s> :) Regardless, I think changing the name to "Evaluation and Reporting Language" would be fine.  </s>
<s> Reporting is a good general concept.  </s>
<s> --wendy  </s>
<s> wendy a chisholm world wide web consortium web accessibility initiative madison, wi usa  </s>
<s> How about Evaluation And Report Language?  </s>
<s> If we have "Reporting", we  </s>
<s> should also have "Evaluating", and "Evaluating And Reporting Language" doesn't really roll off of the tongue and into the mind.  </s>
<s> Having said that, this will mean that we'll have to update all of the schemas and so forth, so we should only change it if it's *really* necessary.  </s>
<s> We've already had two language name changes prior to this one, and I think that too many more would just make it confusing.  </s>
<s> The phenomics of the language overall does not really affect what it does, so I'm a little sceptical - not because it's a bad name change (it's a good idea), but because we'd be changing it at all.  </s>

<s> sold.  </s>
<s> I think it's worth doing it now.  </s>
<s> I started updating the EARL home page.  </s>
<s> I don't see any mention of Repair in the RDF schema (N3 or XML), nor in the graphics or the examples, so it was easy.  </s>
<s> I'm still working on cleaning up the EARL home page (trying to give it a more kosher W3C note look).  </s>
<s> I'd suggest we leave it alone.  </s>
<s> I see Daniels point that it doesn't fully describe repair at this time.  </s>
<s> However, we don't want to paint ourselves into a corner where we can't add it.  </s>
<s> So it has that potential, even it it's not in the intitial release.  </s>
<s> And even now, it can be used FOR repair.  </s>
<s> Also, "Report" sounds too much like just one of the applications, making a human readable output summarizing the results.  </s>
<s> So it makes it too narrow, and we need to omit the name "report".  </s>
<s> This leaves the "R" in EARL meaning nothing.  </s>
<s> If someone can think of some meaningless thing for R to stand for that would be OK with me.  </s>
<s> Having said all that, if the consensus of others is to make it Evaluation and Report Language, I'll go along with it.  </s>

<s> How about "Resource"... they put that in RDF, and it seems to mean absolutely nothing as far as I can tell [1] :-)  </s>
<s> We could always change it back again, I suppose.  </s>
<s> I still prefer "Repair" for the reasons you have given, but it has to be admitted that there isn't much in the way of "Repair" terms in the EARL 0.9 model... Daniel says in the original prose that repair information could be associated by linking to a repair block from a certain evaluation statement.  </s>
<s> I'm not quite sure how that will fit into 0.9, but this is something that we can discuss - certainly, the language is extensible enough to cope with just about anything; I made several thousand versions over the weekend, and it was very simple to make the changes (if it wasn't for the SVG diagram).  </s>
<s> [1] There are many arguements on RDF IG about the nature of resources... Kindest Regards, Sean B. Palmer @prefix : http://webns.net/roughterms/ .  </s>
<s> :Sean :hasHomepage http://purl.org/net/sbp/ .  </s>
<s> The reason I like 'reporting' is that sharing the state of [both incomplete and completed] evaluations and/or fixes between different centers of activity is where EARL can be recognized to be adding value.  </s>
<s> It's good if the name reminds us of the answer to "why bother?"  </s>
<s> Al  </s>
<s> Ain't broke - don't fix.  </s>
<s> Just the "trivial" changing of a bunch of documents is tedious.  </s>
<s> Also changing it won't *change* it because it's embedded and the rewriting of history is absurd.  </s>
<s> All together now "what does the 'U' in "URI' signify?" - I bet more people say the incorrect  </s>
<s> "universal" than the correct "uniform".  </s>
<s> Let's call the whole thing off?  </s>
<s> Love. ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE  </s>
<s> I still say it sometimes.  </s>
<s> According to "Weaving the Web", TimBL wanted to use "Universal", but the IETF folk argued that this was ridiculous, arguing "how can any resource identifier/indicator be universal?  </s>
<s> Call it uniform".  </s>
<s> Of course, that's only one side of the story - I'll be the IETF people have their reasons, and one day maybe I'll track them down.  </s>
<s> Whatever the case, "Universal" is better than "Uniform", and "Repair" is probably better than "Report"... but I don't really care; URIs are still URIs, and EARL is still EARL.  </s>
<s> The Web would still be working tomorrow if all the kings/queens on earth decreed that it is to be called "The Information Mine" or whatever.  </s>
<s> This is all just one big step towards the Pedantic Web, IMO.  </s>
<s> Never! Kindest Regards, Sean B. Palmer @prefix : http://webns.net/roughterms/ .  </s>
