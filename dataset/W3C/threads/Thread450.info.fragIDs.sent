Tidy crashes when parsing the following files. 
Basicaly, it's the attribute values which is not quoted by " blow off tidy when tidy tries to print out the warning. 
html title Hello World /title body font face=arial, hello, world Hi /font /body /html 
I was not able to reproduce this crash in my slightly modified version of the 04 Aug 00 code (meaning I might had already fixed this bug), nor with the current (03 Sep 01) version of the code. 
Anyone else able to reproduce it? 
However, in any case I suspect we have already fixed this bug in the current code (we fixed a lot of crash bugs like this).

Hi, 
Yeah, I can reproduce this bug on in tidy 4 Aug 00. 
I was tearing my hair 
out with it last week! 
But I thought Tidy was ok about attribute values not being "delimited" the culprit in the example code I suspect is hello not 
having any value. 
Report Warnings is passed several parameters, one of which is the value of an attribute. 
In the case of attribute hello this is NULL. 
Hence you get this output from tidy... 
line 4 column 4 - Warning: font unknown attribute value "Segmentation Fault (core dumped) Interestingly enough, you can get this same bug for a bad attribute name, where the problem is the name of the attribute but it tries to report the problem as being due to the attribute. 
Something like this causes a lovely core... but the real problem is the unbalanced " around the attribute value red.

Thanks for the confirmation. 
We have fixed these sorts of problems in the current code. 
However I did check the code of my slightly modified 04 Aug 00 version, and I already had a fix for this problem (which is why I probably couldn't reproduce the problem) - BUT, it should have printed out "NULL". 
What I got instead was : line 2 column 2 - Warning: inserting missing 'title' element line 2 column 6 - Warning: title isn't allowed in body elements line 3 column 6 - Warning: body isn't allowed in body elements line 4 column 6 - Warning: font attribute "hello," lacks value line 4 column 6 - Warning: unknown attribute "world" Not quite sure what is confusing Tidy about the title. 
But I did find the characters 0xCA (&amp;Ecirc;) used as follows : 0x20 0xCA 0xCA 0x20 for indenting each line of the sample HTML (the first and last lines have a leading 0x20). 
I just copied and pasted the original HTML from the EMail. 
What platform was this HTML created on? 
When I used "-mac" encoding, the 0xCA are actually transcoded to 0xA0 which is a &amp;nbsp; The current version (03 Sep 01) of Tidy produces the following errors for the same HTML : line 2 column 2 - Warning: inserting missing 'title' element line 2 column 6 - Warning: title isn't allowed in body elements line 3 column 6 - Warning: body isn't allowed in body elements line 4 column 6 - Warning: unknown attribute "hello," line 4 column 6 - Warning: unknown attribute "world" But the output is the same in both versions (slightly edited) : Regards, Terry 
Hi, I reproduce the same core dumped crash for UNIX (solaris5.5.1) tidy (30 April 2000). 
MacTidy (MacO 8.6) and TidyGUI (Win2K) produce " same" output: "HTML Tidy for Mac OS, see www.w3.org" but differ for 1st error: MacTidy (vers 4th August 2000) ... line 4 column 4 - Warning: font attribute "hello," lacks value line 4 column 4 - Warning: unknown attribute "world" Tidy (vers 4th August 2000) .... line 4 column 4 - Warning: font unknown attribute value "(null)" line 4 column 4 - Warning: unknown attribute "world"
