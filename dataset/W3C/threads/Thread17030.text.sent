I have just redesigned my web site, but have not released it just yet. 
While there are still some bugs with accessibility issues, I was wondering if anyone would like to give me a little feedback. 
I have tested the site in IE 5 and up, Netscape 4, Netscape 6, Mozilla .98 and the Lynx emulator, and am pretty pleased with the results. 
Some of the DOM programming doesn't work, but the information is accessible. 
Thanks in advance.
