<s> No conceivable path of adding things to Namechar is a reasonable solution.  </s>
<s> -T.  </s>
<s> But you have just given ":/?=;".  </s>
<s> That satisfies your example.  </s>
<s> On thing that having all the types of internal names having the same rules gives us is the ability to use attribute value lists to actually point to names: If Tim makes up his document where every 'ID' is a URL, and I want to make up a DTD that gives the user a choice of selecting some parts of it: !ATTLIST xxx inTim( 10 |http://www.infoseek.com/Titles?qt=alchemy;col=WW;sv=IS;lk=noframes;nh=1  </s>

<s> I currently can do it, by adding ":/?;" to the NAMECHAR.  </s>
<s> I can also use attribute value lists to nominate element types, attribute identifiers, notations, etc etc.  </s>
<s> All the same mechanism.  </s>
<s> If we abolish IDs in favour of unique CDATA, we lose this kind of ability, without then adding another layer of indirection.  </s>
<s> And we complicate the syntax of anything that tries to use the unique CDATA as an ID.  </s>
<s> And we increase the difficulty of reading the markup.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, CDATA IDs would dump on us the nasty: xxx href="http://www.infoseek.com/Titles?XML-LINK=ID(  </s>
<s> ))..ID( Which is nasty because there is a transition between query and ID that is not marked up: the outside () has a meaning as part of XML-link, the inside () are just characters in IDs.  </s>
<s> I think this is poor language design.  </s>
<s> We have just been removing overloading from SGML delimiters in XML.  </s>
<s> Surely it is inconstant to then reintroduce overloading en masse by allowing CDATA ID? Unless we then decide to have: xxx href="http://www.infoseek.com/Titles?XML-LINK=ID(  </s>
<s> 'http://www.infoseek.com/Contents?XML-LINK=ID( &amp;apos;http://www.infoseek.com/book?qt=sophistry&amp;apos;  </s>
<s> )')..ID( 'http://www.infoseek.com/Titles?qt=tyromancy')"  </s>
<s> / or xxx href="http://www.infoseek.com/Titles?XML-LINK=ID(  </s>

<s> )]] )..ID( [CDATA[ to clearly markup the boundaries.  </s>
<s> Would the HTML people be happy about for example?  </s>
<s> I know this is a dumb thing to do, but is a dumb thing people can do, and it will be valid.  </s>

<s> Do that and you can't use "/ " to end a tag.  </s>

<s> No, I think, because 1) all attribute value specs in XML have to be quoted 2) the longest delimiter rule in SGML will mean that a / is recognised correctly (I am not suggesting that " " should be a valid name character :-)  </s>

<s> [Rick Jelliffe ricko@allette.com.au ]  </s>
<s> But NAME tokens are also parsed with the leftmost-longest rule, so " IMG/ " would be scanned as STAGO, NAME "IMG/", TAGC if "/" were a NAMECHAR.  </s>
<s> --Joe English joe@art.com  </s>
<s> Good point.  </s>
<s> So * soletag close delimiter is "\ ", or * people have to do IMG / , or * "\" is NAMECHAR (&amp; is the mandated delimiter for URLs) not "/", or * a name cannot end with NAMECHAR (given the SGML declaration I made up, where, I think, NAMECHAR only has punctuation characters) What a mess!  </s>
<s> I really don't think we should directly allow any characters that are in other XML delimiters inside NAMES (or inside any "unique CDATA IDs").  </s>
<s> If we cannot use them in data, why should we be able to use them in markup strings?  </s>
