Having declined to make editorial improvements, I have been thinking some 
more. 
It was not the principle of greater editorial clarity that I minded, more 
the specifics that Peter was suggesting. 
A possible editorial improvement that I could support is as follows: At the end of section 3.4 Literals (informative) add the following new para The string in both plain and typed literals is required to be in Unicode Normal Form C [NFC]. 
This requirement is motivated by [Charmod] particularly section 4 Early Uniform Normalization. 
The strings of literals can be considered a href= "http://www.w3.org/TR/charmod/#def-construct" constructs /a in the sense used in that section. 
and add charmod into the informative references.

That looks good to me; I've already had to explain to an end-user of my RDF parser what the NFC check failure meant and had to point them at the charmod document, so explaining the motivation is good.

I'll ask peter what he thinks ... maybe we can have a couple of minutes on this at the telecon. 
It is an editorial change so strictly speaking I don't need WG blessing.

This looks OK to me.
