<s> Given the majority views expressed at the Bristol f2f and subsequent discussion on the WG list, I put forth to the WG the following proposal for closure of rdfs-xml-schema-datatypes: Concisely: 1. Literals are syntactically (and semantically) untidy in the graph and literal nodes denote datatype values (we choose test D in the unsent inquiry regarding tidyness/untidyness). 2. rdfs:range is used for global datatyping of property values.  </s>
<s> 3. The only new vocabulary is rdfs:Datatype which is used to identify RDF classes which denote datatypes, and we use the XML Schema defined URIs to denote those datatypes.  </s>
<s> 4. There are only two idioms:  </s>
<s> a) global/implicit Jenny ex:age _:x"10" .  </s>
<s> ex:age rdfs:range xsd:integer .  </s>
<s> b) local/explicit Bob ex:age _:y .  </s>
<s> _:y xsd:integer _:z"10" .  </s>
<s> [If literals are permitted to be subjects, then idiom 4(b) is replaced with normal RDF typing: b') local/explicit Bob ex:age _:y"10" .  </s>
<s> _:y rdf:type xsd:integer .  </s>
<s> Note that if literals are not permitted to be subjects now, but are permitted in RDF 2.0, then 4(b) above is fully semantically analogous to, and anticipates 4(b')] 5. We adopt the above-used notation for denoting untidy literal nodes in NTriples, where the original occurrence as object includes a nodeID and the literal string, and (if permitted) triples with the literal as subject include only the nodeID.  </s>
<s> The above are to be taken as modifications/corrections to the present datatyping WD.  </s>
<s> I propose that the above be approved by the WG, incorporated into the datatyping WD and published for review by the RDF community as soon as possible, ideally by July 5th.  </s>
<s> This will close the final open issue rdfs-xml-schema-datatypes and put us well on the way towards meeting a last call for the datatyping specification by Aug 26th.  </s>
<s> I ask that the WG would vote on this proposal during today's concall (June 28), and if adopted, reserve the bridge afterwards  </s>
<s> for discussion by the datatyping editors and any other parties regarding modification, completion, and publication of the WD. Regards, Patrick  </s>
<s> I got this email on the morning of the 28th.  </s>
<s> This is a little short notice to hold a vote.  </s>
