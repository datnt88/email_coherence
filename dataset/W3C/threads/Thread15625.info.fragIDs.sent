Perhaps we could have a discussion (or a vote) on which of the following people believe are least subjective: 
* Inherent 
* Intuitive 
* Reliable * Dependable * Steady 
* Constant 
* Regular 
* Coherent 
* Uniform 
Possible examples where "consistent" has been used: "Use layouts that are '...' and make interactive components act in predictable ways" "Key orientation and navigational elements (such as navigation bars) are generally found in one or two '...' locations or their locations are otherwise predictable" "Where non '...' or unpredictable responses are essential to the function of the content (e.g. mystery games, adventure games, tests, etc.) the user is warned in advance of encountering them." 
My preference is for uniform.

Gian: 
Sorry to burst your bubble but to me, 'consistent' is by far the best option. 
Why didn't you put that as an option? 
I will list my objections to each below, using 'consistent layouts' as an example of the use of the word. 
I would associate this with plain HTML without any presentational markup. 
The 1993 look of the web if you know what I mean. 
Intuitive for whom? the author? the visitor? 
Reliable, dependable and steady web content to me has technical associations. 
A website where every page has a totally different moronic layout can still be reliable in my LGF [1]. 
It would apply to the technical 
aspects of this checkpoint but not the presentational ones. 
Uniform and constant sound more restrictive than necessary. 
If I have a 
website with a different color scheme for each section, that would be consistent but in my LGF [1] it would not be uniform. 
Sounds like 'ordinary'. 
We don't want to encourage extraordinary websites. 
My #2, just behind "consistent". 
Between the two, I think more people would understand consistent.

I share Yvette's preference for "consistent." 
I was trying to write success criteria that made consistency testable-- for example, by specifying that content comonents that appear on multiple resources or sections within resources occur in the same relation to other content wherever they appear. 
I *think* putting it this way allows evaluation to take account of either spatial/visual layout or temporal sequence (e.g., for people using screen readers and maybe in VoiceXML?). 
While I'm on the subject, I'm not sure I understand why Gregg and/or Jan proposed moving this one to level 3, unless you'd also favor putting something like "visual layout is consistent" at level 3 also. 
A consistent visual layout places components such as nav bars, search forms, and standardized section headings in the main content area in the same relation to other content on every page (i.e., headers, footers, left-side menus, etc.).

Thanks Gian, Hmmmmm Some quick comments Perhaps we could have a discussion (or a vote) on which of the following people believe are least subjective: * Inherent -- very subjective * Intuitive -- implies personal skill * Reliable -- what our measure should be -- but needs quantification * Dependable -- ditto * Steady -- close to objective -- but too constraining * Constant -- very objective -- but too constraining for a required and maybe even for L3 if it is really meant to be exact. 
If not then we lose some objectivity * Regular -- same as steady * Coherent -- this is REALLY person by person. 
* Uniform -- very objective -- Same comment as "constant' Boy this is hard Gregg Possible examples where "consistent" has been used: "Use layouts that are '...' and make interactive components act in predictable ways" "Key orientation and navigational elements (such as navigation bars) are generally found in one or two '...' locations or their locations are otherwise predictable" "Where non '...' or unpredictable responses are essential to the function of the content (e.g. mystery games, adventure games, tests, etc.) the user is warned in advance of encountering them." 
My preference is for uniform.
