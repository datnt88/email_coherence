<s> I share Yvette's preference for "consistent."  </s>
<s> I was trying to write success criteria that made consistency testable-- for example, by specifying that content comonents that appear on multiple resources or sections within resources occur in the same relation to other content wherever they appear.  </s>
<s> I *think* putting it this way allows evaluation to take account of either spatial/visual layout or temporal sequence (e.g., for people using screen readers and maybe in VoiceXML?).  </s>
<s> While I'm on the subject, I'm not sure I understand why Gregg and/or Jan proposed moving this one to level 3, unless you'd also favor putting something like "visual layout is consistent" at level 3 also.  </s>
<s> A consistent visual layout places components such as nav bars, search forms, and standardized section headings in the main content area in the same relation to other content on every page (i.e., headers, footers, left-side menus, etc.).  </s>

<s> Thanks Gian, Hmmmmm Some quick comments Perhaps we could have a discussion (or a vote) on which of the following people believe are least subjective: * Inherent -- very subjective * Intuitive -- implies personal skill * Reliable -- what our measure should be -- but needs quantification * Dependable -- ditto * Steady -- close to objective -- but too constraining * Constant -- very objective -- but too constraining for a required and maybe even for L3 if it is really meant to be exact.  </s>
<s> If not then we lose some objectivity * Regular -- same as steady * Coherent -- this is REALLY person by person.  </s>
<s> * Uniform -- very objective -- Same comment as "constant' Boy this is hard Gregg Possible examples where "consistent" has been used: "Use layouts that are '...' and make interactive components act in predictable ways" "Key orientation and navigational elements (such as navigation bars) are generally found in one or two '...' locations or their locations are otherwise predictable" "Where non '...' or unpredictable responses are essential to the function of the content (e.g. mystery games, adventure games, tests, etc.) the user is warned in advance of encountering them."  </s>
