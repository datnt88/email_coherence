Technique 9.5.1 [priority 3] Check for "accesskey" attribute Discussion Status: awaiting discussion Evaluation: Check the following elements for an "accesskey" attribute: A AREA BUTTON INPUT LABEL LEGEND SELECT TEXTAREA Example Language: Create short keys to important active elements on this page. 
Repair Technique: none Test Files and Discussion Files: wendy a chisholm world wide web consortium web accessibility initiative madison, wi usa The HTML spec actually doesn't define the ACCESSKEY attribute for the SELECT element. 
I'm not sure why since it does have it for INPUT, but I assume it's because an INPUT whose TYPE is not "text" will not have an associated LABEL element to receive the ACCESSKEY, whereas any SELECT element will. 
But anyway the spec isn't clear so I don't know if we should keep SELECT in the list, or add those provisions for INPUT, or what. 
Michael ah, yes. 
ok. i've deleted it for now.
