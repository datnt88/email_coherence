<s> I have just discovered and downloaded HTML Tidy yesterday, and now i have been testing it on some ASP files.  </s>
<s> I have run into a problem, which I have been able to pinpoint to some ASP code in an INPUT tag (see example below).  </s>
<s> I have not found anything on this in the archives.  </s>
<s> When I run tidy on this file, it crashes with an access violation application error.  </s>
<s> INPUT TYPE="submit" % if (Session("MSIE4")) Response.Write("disabled") % VALUE="Ok" NAME="submit" I can even remove all the code from within the % % and still get the crash!  </s>
<s> Is is so that Tidy can not handle ASP code in this context.  </s>
<s> I know it can handle attribute values, but this attribute (DISABLED) is not of the form name =" value ". Could this be the reason for the crash, or have I made a mistake somewhere?  </s>
