Thank you for your prompt reply. 
I'm glad these char sets will finally be registered. 
The IBM code pages below are created to add the euro symbol to existing IBM code pages that are published in "IBM NLDG Volume 2 (SE09-8002-03) August 
1994", and are already on the IANA registry. 
The referenced URL is just to 
indicate the code position the euro symbol has been added at for each code page. 
However, there are two exceptions: IBM00923 is the IBM code page corresponding to ISO 8859-15, and therefore I'm withdrawing the registration for this char set, and instead asking for an alias to be added to the ISO 8859-15 entry in your registry, the alias name should be: IBM00923 IBM00924 has the same character repertoire as ISO 8859-15 but in an EBCDIC encoding. 
We are in the process of making the IBM code pages available on the web, until that time IBM00924 can be obtained by sending an e-mail to "nltc@ca.ibm.com" attention "Code Page and Character Set Registrar". 
The URL previously provided has been corrected below to be "www.as400.ibm.com/euro/Roadmap.htm" 
(changing the extension from html to htm) The code pages below (except IBM00858) are EBCDIC code pages , EBCDIC code pages are NOT suitable for use in MIME Text. 
The URL for conversion tables to ISO 10646 has been added for each entry below (http://www.developer.ibm.com/devcon/titlepg.htm).

If any further information is required to register those char sets, please let me know. 
Also please update the char set registration mailing list to include my e-mail address (tamer@ca.ibm.com) instead of Rick Pond's (pond@ca.ibm.com). 
This is to register the IBM Coded Character Set ID's (CCSID's) and their corresponding code pages created to add the euro symbol to existing IBM Code Pages.

Hello Tamer, Does anybody currently use any of those IBM character encodings "on the wire" (i.e. in an Internet protocol such as MIME email or HTTP)? 
Thanks, Erik 
The only one that can be used in MIME, etc. is IBM850. 
All the others have an EBCDIC encoding and are not suitable for use "on the wire".

Thanks, Erik 
What is the motivation for registering these charsets if they are not suitable for use on the wire? 
Is it intended to update existing EBCDIC registrations with new ones that have now included the euro character? 
I'm just concerned about adding things that don't really belong in the registry. 
In general, the MIME working group has tried to keep the 
number of charsets down to a minimum, in order to maintain a certain level of interoperability. 
In the past, many charsets were added to the registry, even if they were not being used on the wire, and many of them may never be used on the wire. 
The question now is whether we should continue to add such unused charsets to the registry. 
Erik 
The idea was to document it for applications to be used at a platform but not on the wire. 
And this was deemed needed as IETF specifications are also about the things that happen with the protocols at the platforms. 
On the other hand, it was decided that only some selected charsets should be used for interchange, on the wire. 
Maybe we should add that as a property to each of the registrations, that is, "recommended for use on the wire". 
I believe some of these recommendations are already done in the rfcs specifying the protocols. 
Kind regards Keld 
The charset names are quite useful. 
In fact, Mozilla uses them to identify converters that convert to and from Unicode. 
Mozilla uses Unicode internally, and converts to and from whatever charsets are used in the underlying software (OS, etc) and on the Net. 
But as things stand, there is not very much guidance in the use of the 
many charset names in the registry, and people may feel free to use any 
of them on the wire, when the working group's intention was to minimize the number of charsets on the wire. 
So I would tend to agree with you that we should do something about this, but I don't know whether an additional property in the registry is 
the best way to go. 
Perhaps some protocols would prefer to be very 
strict and only allow a very small number of charsets, while other protocols would prefer to be quite liberal, allowing a larger variety of charsets. 
Comments?

There is more "on the wire" than media type "text/*", for example XML via HTTP. 
EBCDIC is perfectly ok for media type "application/xml".

I agree with Keld; for example EBCDIC char sets are not directly used on the Internet, however they are used on the servers that run many of the internet applications. 
Conversion has to take place between these EBCDIC char sets and char sets that are used on the internet. 
Developers need to know what char sets are used on the server side to plan the right conversion. 
Another case is remote printing over the internet; many of the IBM printers use the EBCDIC char sets in AFP printing (Advanced Function Printing), and hence internet applications need to know the char set used on the remote printer. 
Additionally, people have used the IANA registry as a reference for char set names etc. regardless of whether their applications are for the internet. 
I think the scope and usefulness of the registry is wider than IETF and the internet.
