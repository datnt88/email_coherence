I want to apologize for the other message earlier today about question between ALT and TITLE, somehow I managed to miss Al's posting on 4/25 about ALT not displaying. 
Thank you Al. I am concerned about Jim's find of the blinking test with a title attribute on IE 5.5. 
That isn't occuring in IE 5.0 or NN 6.0. 
But I really don't want blinking text since that's a whole other issue. 
Sounds like I'm stuck again. 
ALT doesn't work. 
TITLE is blinking in IE 5.5. 
LABEL can't handle it. 
So if I fix the form with TITLE and SCOPE which seems to work great with Homepage Reader, then I make it blink for IE 5.5 users. 
I realize that the TITLE won't show up as a tool tip popup for NN 4.x or some other browsers. 
That really doesn't worry me. 
If someone can "see" the form then the popup mouseover isn't necessary (actually I would rather it not be there at all - especially if it blinks!). 
ALT doesn't popup but the screen readers aren't reading it. 
So suggestions? 
How is this handled in the future?

Subject: RE: Extensive forms &amp; tables accessibility question I checked out Eugenia's page and found a curious phenomena... 
In IE 5.5 when I put the mouse over an INPUT the tool tip does pop up but FLASHES on and off. 
This was very distracting. 
(seems to flash at 2 times the speed of the cursor blink, it flashes when the cursor is in an INPUT or when no INPUT as a cursor in it). 
In Netscape 4.7 nothing is displayed In Opera 5.1 nothing is displayed.

[Yuri Alekseevich Gagarin, from the Vostok 1, April 12, 1961.] 
Behalf Of Al Gilman Contrary to what I previously thought, I now have evidence that the ALT attribute on INPUT will not show up using IE 5.5 and Window-Eyes 4.0. 
So as of now it would appear that the technique that looks best is to use TITLE on the INPUT, at very least where, as in Eugenia's case, there is no suitable LABEL content already showing somewhere on the page. 
And Thatch's advice is to ignore LABEL and just TITLE it anyway. 
Al I haven't experienced the "blinking" that Jim Allan talked about. 
I wonder how serious it is. 
The sighted user moves the mouse to one of the input areas and starts typing. 
What happens. 
Does the title keep popping up? 
I forgot that I had 5.5 on a different computer and tried it there. 
Sometimes the title pops up and disappears. 
It does not continue blinking. 
I think this is not a problem. 
The title for input areas is such a good solution to a tough problem. 
I have a simplified version of Eugenia's form at (http://jimthatcher.com/SimpleFormWithTitles.htm). 
It is also the form I advocate at the end of the section on accessible forms in the ITTATC Web Accessibility Course (http://jimthatcher.com/webcourse8.htm). 
I would like to hear what others feel about the "blinking concern" in IE 5.5 title popup. 
After discussion with the JFW developer yesterday, it is definite that support for titles will be in a soon to be released update/patch. 
As I mentioned before, HPR will support the title attribute and Window-Eyes already does support it.

Al Thanks Jim. 
I've also tried a 5.5 version and couldn't duplicate the "blinking" text. 
I'm going with TITLE in my input fields as well as SCOPE on my td tags. 
HPR seems to do very well with the SCOPE even if the TITLE ability isn't turned on. 
JAWS doesn't like my form page at all. 
It gets stuck on the first line. 
I hope that the update/patch will correct this. 
I haven't tried Window-eyes.

Al Hi Jim, Wendy Chisholm was gracious enough to put me in touch with Matt May who is editing the WCAG 2.0 He is going to incorporate the technique into them. 
So this should be in there when those are released.

Hi Eugina, Sorry for being so long in responding, Frankly, I was hoping others would respond since I am not active in the Guideline working group. 
Title on the INPUT elements is, like the LABEL element, a technique for a guideline, not itself a guideline (or checkpoint). 
But it is a "strong" technique since it is included in the checkpoint as a "for example." 
I would think that if (the major) user agents are supporting title on input elements, then it would be a technique suggested for the appropriate guideline.
