<s> All, A few questions and comments on the Web Ontology Language (OWL) Guide Version 1.0, http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-owl-guide-20021104/, some of which are just trivial typos.  </s>
<s> 1) The guide contains the definition of the WineYear class: but this class does not appear to be present in the file wine.owl (or  </s>
<s> food.owl) linked from the guide.  </s>
<s> 2) in this example OWL, the semicolon is missing from the first &amp;owl; entity: rdf:type rdf:resource="&amp;owlTransitiveProperty" /  </s>
<s> 3) Botany trivia - is Cabernet Sauvignon in fact a species as stated, or just a variety?  </s>
<s> 8-)  </s>
<s> 4) Typo - change "Is" to "It" and add "of": In our wine ontology, hasVintageYear is functional.  </s>
<s> A wine has a unique vintage year.  </s>
<s> That is, a given individual Vintage can only be associated with a single year using the hasVintageYear property.  </s>
<s> Is is not a requirement a FunctionalProperty that all elements of the domain have values.  </s>
<s> See the discussion of Vintage cardinality.  </s>
<s> 5) Unique naming The guide says:  </s>
<s> In the example above, we asserted identity between two distinct names.  </s>
<s> But it is just as possible for this sort of identity to be inferred.  </s>
<s> Remember the implications that can be derived from a functional property.  </s>
<s> Given that hasMaker is functional, the following is not necessarily a conflict.  </s>
<s> owl:Thing rdf:about="#BancroftChardonnay" hasMaker rdf:resource="#Bancroft" / hasMaker rdf:resource="#Beringer" / /owl:Thing ?  </s>
<s> It may simply mean that Bancroft = Beringer.  </s>
<s> Well, does it?  </s>
<s> Either it is a conflict, or Bancroft = Beringer, but which?  </s>
<s> If this is an application -dependent choice, are interoperability problems likely if systems make different assumptions?  </s>
<s> I think the point about explosion of properties has been made already - with large numbers of distinct individuals, the number of differentIndividualFrom properties required to express this becomes very large.  </s>
<s> But presumably one could define a uniqueId property for each such individual (inverseFunctionalProperty?) to achieve this?  </s>
<s> 6) typo - differentIndividualFrom This mechanism provides the opposite effect from sameIndivdualAs.  </s>
<s> 7) typo - insert "of": OWL provides the means to define a class via a direct enumeration its members.  </s>
<s> 8) typo - remove apostrophe One could distinguish four types of production area's: 9) typo - Change "us" to "is" vineyards are located in towns: Chateau Margaux us a vineyard in Margaux, Avignonesi in Montepulciano Regards, David.  </s>

<s> In OWL Full, you can create unique names for resources by defining a DataTypeProperty that is both functional and inverseFunctional.  </s>
<s> That gives you a one-to-one mapping, and then you can infer that resources are different because they have different names.  </s>
<s> You just need to go through a level of indirection.  </s>
<s> But the application of InverseFunctionalProperty to a DataTypeProperty depends on the use of OWL Full.  </s>
<s> So the answer depends on what language level you have selected.  </s>
