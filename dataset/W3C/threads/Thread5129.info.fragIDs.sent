<s> Hello,  </s>
<s> I installed TAP in my server (http://marte.dsi.uminho.pt/data), and I downloaded and put Places.rdf from stanford to my "data" directory.  </s>
<s> Now I want to run the examples (ex1a, ex1b,...) over my server, but always I received a "null" like an answer.  </s>
<s> Any suggestion?  </s>
<s> Thanks, CEsar Ariza  </s>
<s> There seems to be a problem with the Places.rdf file available for download; it doesn't parse correctly.  </s>
<s> I'll make sure this gets fixed soon.  </s>
<s> Hi Cesar, please download a new copy of Places.rdf and try again.  </s>
<s> Hi Rob, I put the new file but I still receive "null"?  </s>
<s> Now, How could I do?  </s>
