<s> EOWG: Comments welcome through early Tuesday morning (January 23) US EST.  </s>
<s> In our meeting last Friday we briefly re-discussing one issue regarding the updated Quick Tips order.  </s>
<s> For reference, the current tips text is at We'd had an internal request for a small printing change: to change "map" and "noframes" which are currently boldface, small caps on the card, to boldface, lower case, since in XHTML it is incorrect to list element names in upper case.  </s>
<s> Turned out to be more complicated than expected.  </s>
<s> When proofing the new version, it became apparent that differentiating the element names in only one manner -- by boldface -- looked somewhat like a typo, in that it did not stand out enough.  </s>
<s> In our meeting last Friday we discussed four options for resolving it: 1. add the word "element" after MAP and NOFRAMES -- problem is that it breaks layout 2. drop small caps to lowercase and leave bold -- problem is that doesn't stand out 3. change font for code-type -- monospace serif, such as courier 4. leave as is -- problem, internal dissension.  </s>
<s> We decided as first choice to go with a code-font change, and if that did not work, to leave it as is.  </s>
<s> However I went over this with our printer &amp; with our internal communications folks and got some new information: - The code-font looked even more out of place.  </s>
<s> - We got an internal rule-out on leaving the card as is, since it would be inconsistent with XHTML which has been out for a year now.  </s>
<s> - The printer managed to make the "element" word fit on the line, but then we realized that by adding that word, we also needed to add a "the" before the word before element (yet another ripple effect of a "simple" change to the card).  </s>
<s> He then made a word-wrapping fit on the front of the card.  </s>
<s> That's not to say it will fit on the translated cards though.  </s>
<s> - He also pointed out that on the card itself, the boldface was quite prominent, and therefore might be a sufficient distinction even without small caps.  </s>
<s> However, other parties here felt that the language use would be inconsistent without "element" on the card.  </s>
<s> I know that some of you would like not to comment further on this.  </s>
<s> However, if you do, here's the question:  </s>
<s> - Please look at the following proofs (these are temporary URI's only!!! do not bookmark!! and these are for visual inspection only -- the "alt" for the cards is that one set is exactly the same as the text on the current QuickTips page, and the other one has "Use the client-side map element and text for hotspots" and "Use the noframes element and meaningful titles.") - Any comments pro or con on the use of "the... element" on the card sets?  </s>
<s> William's message on Saturday notwithstanding, unless I get strong comments favoring "the... element" I plan to go with the simple boldface lowercase "map" &amp; "noframes" only, since adding "element" etc seems to just exacerbate the clunkiness of the card.  </s>

<s> I prefer the card with "the ... element":  </s>
<s> a) it reads better (i.e. slightly more grammatically).  </s>
<s> b) to me it looks better with the last line of text on the front side almost in line with the "over" arrow.  </s>
<s> It appears to make the margin/padding uniform on all sides.  </s>
<s> c) it is slightly more informative - there is a difference between elements and attributes so why not emphasize that fact.  </s>
<s> Having said all that, I won't stop handing the cards out if you choose to go with the simpler fix.  </s>
<s> Cheers!  </s>

<s> Me too.  </s>
<s> Love.  </s>
<s> ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE  </s>
<s> Judy et al, Here is a strong opinion in favour of "the ... element:" I greatly prefer the version containing the extra words.  </s>
<s> The two revised points are much clearer than before.  </s>
<s> I happen to be reading an HTML primer right now.  </s>
<s> When I read the new version of the Quick Tip card, I am reminded that that noframes and map are "elements" (as opposed to "attributes," "values," etc.), and this reminder powerfully reinforces what I am learning.  </s>
<s> To my ears, the extra words do not make the points sound overly technical; the extra words enhance clarity and aid my understanding.  </s>
<s> The inclusion of the extra words sacrifices only a little in terms of visual aesthetics.  </s>
<s> Of course, it would be nice to have more white space at the bottom of Side 1, but the new version is not unattractive.  </s>
<s> I don't find it clunky.  </s>
<s> Maybe the printer can tighten the leading a little, but if it can't be done, the polar ice caps are not going to melt.  </s>
<s> I am willing to trust those who translate Quick Tips into other languages to use their ingenuity to make everything fit.  </s>

<s> Judy, I concur with Alan.  </s>
