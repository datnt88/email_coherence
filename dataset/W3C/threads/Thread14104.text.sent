I have yet to discover a need for TABINDEX= in a form. 
I have yet to hear of a good reason for using it. 
I too have had a difficult time coming up with a practical example for using TABINDEX in a FORM. 
I have to design a very complex and poorly ordered form to make TABINDEX useful, and it seems much easier to just design the form well from the start. 
However, I have started using TABINDEX to provide the user with a way of easily skipping over any NAVIGATION bar or advertising links that may lurk at the top of my pages. 
I generally assign TABINDEX=1 to what I feel is the most important link on the page (quite often the "Next Page" link), and go on from there as systematically as I can. 
Usually the last "n" tab stops correspond to the standard nav-bar (or nav-bar text alternative) links.
