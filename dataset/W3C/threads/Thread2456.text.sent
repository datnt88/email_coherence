Larry Masinter, Jim Gettys, Paul Leach, Jeff Mogul, Henrik Frysyk, and Scott Lawrence joined the call. 
We're going back on a weekly telephone schedule to try to get this wrapped up soon. 
As always, the updated issues list is found at: #AUTH-INFO-SYNTAX has been quiet on the mailing list, and we didn't get to discussing it at today's meeting. 
Please look at it and comment. 
#DIGEST-PROBS has been quiet on the mailing list, and we didn't get to discussing it at today's meeting. 
Please look at it and comment. 
#CONTENT-LENGTH has been reclassified to a technical issue from editorial; there is a contradiction in the spec that needs clarification, and hopefully, clarifying this will also unconfuse a number of working group members who've been confused as a result. 
It is important we get this right... Jeff and Henrik are working on language here. 
#MULTIPART has been created; the spec is not clear as the interrelationship of MIME multipart being transported and/or cached by HTTP. 
Roy Fielding has volunteered to try to draft language to clarify this (after Feb. 1, as he has a different deadline then). 
Our thanks to him. 
#MULTIPLE-CONTENT-LOCATION has been closed; the MHTML group is looking at other solutions. 
#DIGEST-MESS is still a mess, though some light is visible; there is consensus that we must get it implemented and get passwords in the clear off the net. 
Larry Masinter and Paul Leach are putting together another draft to get out soon (hopefully next week), reflecting all the mailing list action. 
#CONTENT-BASE Content-Base will be removed from the next draft (02). 
Without a feature mechanism and some required extension mechanism, we don't believe it is recoverable; solutions would be analogous to the problems we had with making transfer encoding work, and the payoff isn't worth that level of trouble; better to solve the extensibility mess right and then deal with it. 
Sigh... #IPV6-ADDR-URLS has been closed; solutions to it belong in the URI syntax document, which is a different group, and being driven independently of HTTP, so the HTTP working group should not worry about it. 
Not to mention the IPV6 community hasn't ever actually raised the issue with us. 
#DIGEST-SCALING has been subsumed by Digest mess, and whether the change required to be able to scale up will happen may hinge on whether incompatible changes have to happen in Digest, which might force digest to recycle at proposed. 
(This is not the end of the world, however, if it had to, in my humble opinion; what is important is to get something implemented and out there sooner rather than later; don't get hung up worrying about process stuff; Larry and I will handle the details...). 
I've been working hard on the next draft (rev-02), at least as hard as I can with a cold and a disk drive dying on the system I do the editing on. 
Most of the editorial grunt work has been completed that will be required to get the document to draft standard, so I'm hoping the next draft could concievably (though not likely) go to draft standard, if we can close out issues faster than new ones arise and I catch up with the moving target soon. 
If not, I'll put out an interim draft in a couple weeks (I'd like to avoid it if I can; it costs me about a day of work to get one done and submitted; I was too hurried the last time, and the TOC and index suffered as a result.) Experience shows there is always at least one more draft than you hope for... 
The editorial work completed includes a section on changes since RFC 2068, work on cleaning up and improving the index, instructions to IANA and a number of other issues and I'm continuing work on the few remaining editorial issues. 
Editorial issues that require changes to BNF, normative language, or which I'm not completely sure I'll get right I send mail to the mailing list, so you can complain at me. 
I still have to finish going through the my folder since IETF to make sure none have been dropped on the floor. 
As always, let me know of what issues you believe should exist.

I believe we reached consensus to eliminate the Authentication-info header from the authentication specification. 
If this is done its syntax should be moot. 
I believe we reached consensus to eliminate the entity digest and all its associated paraphenalia. 
After that consensus I volunteered to try to cut down the previous version. 
The results of that effort (with a few changes since I sent it to Jim) are available at I hope we will not forget the consensus and start the debate all over again.

Wasn't trying to stir anything up; just minutes as I understood them, and I haven't been able to keep up on the digest discussion (a cold, and a dead system disk has put me behind).. 
In the case of Digest, my understanding is much less than in other areas, and I'm not editing the next draft (thankfully), so I don't need to understand it. 
I leave it to you, Larry, Paul and Scott to get it together.

JF I believe we reached consensus to eliminate the Authentication-info JF header from the authentication specification. 
If this is done its JF syntax should be moot. 
The consensus was to remove the entity digest - the Authentication-info header field is still needed for the nextnonce attribute - a big performance win.

I've just glanced through this, perhaps I've missed something. 
If nonces are going to be time-limited, we need a response that means "your nonce has expired" so the user is not prompted for a password again.

BL I've just glanced through this, perhaps I've missed something. 
If nonces BL are going to be time-limited, we need a response that means "your nonce BL has expired" so the user is not prompted for a password again. 
It's in there... the server sends a 401 response, with the WWW-Authenticate header to provide nonce and 'stale=true' to indicate that it was the expired nonce that was the problem rather than the credentials.

That's what the "stale=true" field will do.

You are right. 
There was not a consensus to remove Authentication-info/nextnonce. 
I am sceptical of its utility however. 
It would be useful if a typical session looked like request - response - request - response - request - response... rather than 5 piplined requests - 5 piplined responses But the latter is much more likely to be typical.
