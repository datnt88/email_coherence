Miscellaneous: 1. 
Does anyone know if aural style sheets are supported by screen readers? 
As far as I know, they are not. 
2. I think Lynx displays the source XML file. 
If the elements (tags) are indeed semantic and not like red , flashing , then the source file itself might be the best way to go. 3. IE seems to use some default display. 
Can I get IE 5 to display a source XML file that does not have an associated CSS or XSlL file as a plain text file? 
I think that draft is a very good start.

Steven, Regarding your first question, I can say that Window-Eyes does not currently support aural style sheets. 
This is something that I have approached our developers about, and we have brainstormed on a few items. 
But I'm not sure where the development will go from here. 
To my knowledge, none of the major screen readers support aural style sheets at this time.
