<s> Thanks, Lisa  </s>
<s> I think this is a flawed concept.  </s>
<s> "color blind" is a "condition" along a continuum, much like "tone deaf".  </s>
<s> Some people are so jarred by certain color combinations that they simply will not (cannot?) use a site built using them.  </s>
<s> For them this is just as big a problem as it is for a person who *must* use that same color combination (contrast, whatever) to even perceive it.  </s>
<s> There is no objectifiable means of ascertaining what constitutes "good" in this area (contrast, color) and demanding user (through her agent) control is not only necessary, but also sufficient.  </s>
<s> What we tell the author to do/not is immaterial/vain/ill-advised.  </s>
<s> The emphasis in the guidelines must be on choice/control by/for the user.  </s>
<s> The "content" in this case transcends its medium and in the instant case, bypasses it from the author's viewpoint.  </s>
<s> My proposal is that since we cannot reliably advise authors as to the effectiveness/usefulness of particular display parameters that we, while pointing out the potential problems for certain viewers, we remain silent at the guideline/checkpoint level in this regard.  </s>
<s> It's like dietary laws - it all depends on the eater's biochemistry, not on the chef's instructions.  </s>
<s> Love. ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE  </s>
<s> Best advice we have come up with is to try to view the image in black and white and look for good foreground background contrast Contrast ratios don?t seem to work (if you use figure-background levels of 1 and 10 luminance (out of a hundred) you get a 10 to 1 ratio but it is basically black on black and unreadable.  </s>
<s> But 10 and 100 is extremely readable (also 10 to 1).  </s>
<s> So I haven?t heard any better advice.  </s>
<s> Love to hear any so keep me posted if you get some.  </s>

<s> Of Lisa Seeman It was mentioned on the call that the need for contrast in presentation for the sake of color blind was no longer necessary.  </s>

<s> William, were do you get this info from?  </s>
<s> Dyslexia can also be looked at as a continuum in literary ability, However when you plot a Gaussian distribution of reading skills you get a "hump" between -2 and -3 on a normalized scale.  </s>
<s> That hump is coursed from LD. As you are no doubt aware by now, there are things that you can do to help people with LD access a web site.  </s>
<s> There are people (less) who have a low reading ability because of low intelligence and normal variation.  </s>
<s> They will find the support given to people with LD, less helpful.  </s>
<s> I assume that the same thing is true for color blind people.  </s>
<s> in contrast to the gaussian distribution for "color awareness" there does seem to be a second peck at what we call "color blind" and there may be things we can do to help.  </s>
<s> Lisa  </s>
<s> instructions.  </s>
<s> there may be things we can do to help.  </s>
<s> The "we" in that are the authors, more so than the guideline fabricators.  </s>
<s> The job of particularizing what presentational factors are to be considered - and how - is not a guideline/checkpoint issue, IMO.  </s>
<s> Although it must be pointed out that presentation must be: 1) semantically communicated; 2) considerate of device/user capabilities/needs/traditions/+, it need not concern us that "However when you plot a Gaussian distribution of reading skills you get a "hump" between -2 and -3 on a normalized scale.  </s>
<s> That hump is coursed from LD" - by which I mean that although as human beings we are "concerned", it should inform, but not necessarily appear in, the guidelines/checkpoints.  </s>
<s> Our real attention should be on assuring that presentational communication is revealed semantically, while noting that there are myriad problems with the methods we've all come to know/love/"intuit"/use. Love.  </s>
<s> ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE  </s>
<s> Just because something is on a continuum does not mean that it is not a disability  </s>
<s> I'm not sure how I mistakenly gave the impression that I don't think "color-blindness" is a disability.  </s>
<s> It is.  </s>
<s> What I've tried to get across is that the solution to the accessibility engendered by that disability, as with all other such conditions, is to find generalizable principles for addressing solutions via guidelines/checkpoints - not to address individual situations in our document.  </s>
<s> The notion of being aware of problems people have with color/contrast in Web materials is addressed by counseling authors to remain aware/alert that presentational means associated with providing content must be "minable" by users through their agents.  </s>
<s> The semantics must be discoverable.  </s>
<s> We tell authors to consider *all* presentational elements without needing to specify at certain levels of granularity any specific ones.  </s>
<s> Rather than "attend to color/contrast" we say "attend to presentational elements" (which of course include color/contrast/font/volume/vocabulary/equivalents/backgrounds/captions/descriptions/+).  </s>
<s> Presentation/style inevitably (almost) convey information and the perseverance through transformational processes of that information is what we must strive to ensure.  </s>
