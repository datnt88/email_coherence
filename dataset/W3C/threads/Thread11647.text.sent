+{i} --- Only connect! 
That was the whole of the sermon. 
-- E. M. Forster --- Hi, What I suggest is that you give both of it. 
You could link first to the original normative version and give a link two the second one in your native language. 
Hope it helps you. 
Karl Dubost / W3C - Conformance Manager --- Be Strict To Be Cool! --- I agree with Karl. 
Also, please make sure the readers understand which link is which, and that this part is appropriately marked (e.g. by a special background color) as being different from the original (i.e. not a direct translation). 
Regards, Martin. 
I agree with Martin and Karl, but please don't rely on color alone to distinguish links (for reasons of accessibility). 
Please use text as well (e.g., the "title" attribute in HTML).

I would have to see red on lime to be able to give you my opinion, but I'm sure it stands out, so I guess it shouldn't be a problem.
