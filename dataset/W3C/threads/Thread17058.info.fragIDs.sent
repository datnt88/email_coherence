<s> Hi, Yes I have/still intend to compile a list of accessible and good looking websites - however I have held-off from starting this until the re-design of the MCU is finished so that I could launch both at the same time.  </s>
<s> However the redesign is taking longer than I expected so I have set up a  </s>

<s> Please feel add your site to the page using the form provided.  </s>
<s> When I have some time I intend to create a more sophisticated listing/rating system.  </s>

<s> Thanks to Lynn Alford for pointing out to me that there was a problem with the form on the page I previously mentioned, i.e. the page to add your accessible and good looking site to.  </s>
<s> Please use the page at http://www.mcu.org.uk/campaigns/accessible.html  </s>
<s> This just uses a simple comment form at the bottom of the page - but it works fine for now - and I will change it to something more sophisticated as soon as I can.  </s>
<s> Please add your great looking and accessible site to the list; make it easy for other to find a list of well designed and accessible sites.  </s>
