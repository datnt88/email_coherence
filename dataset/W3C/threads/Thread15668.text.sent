Once upon a time Gregg Vanderheiden shaped the electrons to say... ALT = short description of the FUNCTION LONGDESC = (long) description of the IMAGE For example a bullet shaped like an arrow would have alt text "bullet" not "yellow arrow pointing right" No - that is one of the most annoying, worst uses of ALT on the web. 
How do you thing it looks? 
bullet product one bullet product two bullet product three Or sounds? 
You should not use ALT text to describe the image. 
Describe the meaning of the image, and if it is decoration, use null text - ALT="" Real world - one of the folks here used little red ball gifs for marketing page. 
They made the alt text 'Red Ball'. 
I got a frustrated letter from a user who spent a long time trying to find our product - the "Red Ball Office Router". 
Because THAT is what lynx showed him! 
"Bullett Office Router" wouldn't be much of an improvement. 
Remember lots of people don't even know those little shapes in front of a list are called bulletts in the first place. 
Another groaner - we had an add which had "We have one thing to say about K56flex modem upgrades..." (or words like that) and then a typical marketing image of a woman's lips whispering into a man's ear with "FREE" in the middle. 
The marketing folks made the ALT text say "Mouth" - to describe the image. 
That sounds really stupid in Lynx... I caught it. 
:-) An Image button for search would say "search" Not "Magnifying Glass with Search on it" or "magnifying glass" Right - describe the function of the button if it has real meaning. 
If it is just decoration, null it out.

Snail mail: 4464 Willow Road, Pleasanton, CA 94588 regarding the debate of using the word "item" vs. "bullet". 
Here are some more arguments in favor of "bullet". 
First, the word "bullet" can mean "list item" in common parlance. 
At least, that's how it's used around here. 
For example, if someone is giving a viewgraph presentation, someone in the audience may ask: "I have a question about that third bullet" The person in the audience is talking about the third list item, of course, not the little black dot. 
Second, I think it's more useful to use concrete images when a blind and sighted person are communicating. 
For example, suppose a sighted and blind pereson are each viewing a page which as several headings, several big pictures, and a bullet list. 
If the blind person says "third bullet" the sighted person will immediately know what the blind person was referring to. 
But if the blind person says "third item" the sighted person wouldn't know whether the blind person means third heading, image, list item, or what. . 
In general, in my experience, sighted people tend to have problems thinking abstractly about page content so the more concrete we make it for them the better So that's why it's important for blind folks to know what the sighted folks are seeing so they can appropriately accommodate them. 
By the way, if you're sighted, please don't take offence. 
I'm sighted myself. 
Len these are god points and I've been following this discussion and participating it with out thinking of something quite concrete. 
The alt tag is pretty well defined as I understand it and it has worked somewhat adaquately for those who use it. 
I submit that we rely on that deffinition and develop some loose guidelines as to how it is implimented. 
Greg is correct when he states that we are trying to convey representation. 
We could use for instance "list item" to get around the problem of item nomenclature. 
I like the word bullet as I've stated because that is what it is. 
I think what we need is something that will fit all alt tags as a general rule. 
Make it clear and provied example models for clarification. 
As I understand it, an alt tag is an alternative tag put in place of the image. 
it is most often text, but can be a blank space or a symbol. 
I don't want screenreaders to have to put up with redundancy either but redundancy is part of life even in braille where we see ---- or **** all over the place in the right context and in the right form, they can be quite helpfull even if redundant. 
Decorative bullets are nice, but I think the description of them should be given for someone to read if chosen, and the bullets them selves little gifs or jpgs or what ever should be denoted simply with the use of the alt tag.

Is numbering the list items important for navigation?

When I polled about this earlier this year a Lynx fan pointed out to me that having numbers in the list alt tags would be confusing when listening to lynx with link numbers turned on, since the alt tag numbers would conflict with the lynx numbers.. 
In other words, numbers could hurt navigation.
