Can someone please help me with the correct set of option settings to cause HTML-Tidy to retain certain entity encodings from input to output? 
Specifically, I can't find the settings to retain "&amp;mdash;" as "&amp;mdash;" and "&amp;ndash;" as "&amp;ndash;". 
So far, no matter my choices it converts "&amp;mdash;" and "ndash;" from the input to a hyphen or dash on the output. 
I've tried "ascii-chars" set to "no" along with various other combinations to no avail. 
Thanks MJ char-encoding: ascii ascii-chars: no has always worked for me. 
/Jelks Thanks for the feedback. 
Curious. 
I've tried those settings on two different Windows based PCs and using both the command line version and TidyUI. 
In all cases my "&amp;mdash;" on the input is replaced by a hyphen (or dash) on the output. 
Thanks, MJ If the page is online, please post the URL. 
Or you can email it to me otherwise. 
Hard to diagnose without the page itself. 
:) /Jelks Thanks Jelk, A page as simple as doesn't pass through without being changed to a hyphen. 
Maybe my config file will reveal something causing the problem. 
Here it is. 
char-encoding: ascii ascii-chars: no bare: yes break-before-br: yes clean: yes drop-empty-paras: no drop-proprietary-attributes: yes enclose-block-text: yes enclose-text: yes hide-endtags: no logical-emphasis: yes lower-literals: yes quote-marks: yes replace-color: yes show-body-only: no uppercase-attributes: yes uppercase-tags: yes word-2000: yes indent: auto indent-attributes: yes indent-spaces: 3 literal-attributes: no tab-size: 3 tidy-mark: yes wrap: 68 wrap-script-literals: yes Thanks, MJ Ah, there's your problem: you're setting "bare" to "yes". 
Change it to "no", or just remove the option since "no" is the default. 
I just remembered I got bitten by this a long time ago too. 
The quickref documentation should probably be updated to be more explicit. 
This is what it says now ... This option specifies if Tidy should strip Microsoft specific HTML from Word 2000 documents, and output spaces rather than non-breaking spaces where they exist in the input. 
... which hardly indicates the possible "side effects". 
:) Anyway, I kept your entire config file as is -- except for commenting out the "bare: yes" -- and got the desired &amp;mdash; when I re-ran Tidy on it. 
/Jelks Jelks, That did it. 
Thank you very much. 
MJ
