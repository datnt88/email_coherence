Hi all, I've been experimenting with the output of Word 2000, when using the "export to compact HTML" and "save as web page" features. 
What I'd like is to end up with well-formed XML, but the tidy options I've been using don't always give me what I'd expect. 
Tidy makes a heroic effort on the giant mess Word produces, but I need all attributes to be quoted and no repeated attributes. 
For example, Word seems to produce a lot of : Which I need as: Has anybody else had any experiences they could share? 
Stu Tidy's word-2000 option is draconian and strips out the class, lang and style attributes, see PurgeAttributes(). 
It also strips out width attributes from th and td. 
This was based upon an inspection of the markup produced by the save as web page export filter from Word2000. 
I figured it would be more cost effective to strip these out and to later add back in class attributes manually. 
I would be interested to get suggestions for improvements.

The Word X/HTML seems to have a lot of : If these repeats could be optionally removed, we'd be close to having a very useful Word 2000 == X/HTML == XML workflow!

Stu This will be fixed in the next release. 
Thanks for the input.
