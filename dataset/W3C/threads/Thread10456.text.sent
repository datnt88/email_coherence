This agenda was produced by Jema, the Jena WG assistant Likely regrets due to WebOnt F2F 5 in Manchester. 
Mike Danbri, Frank, summary: I would assert that these 2 documents are in sync with the (intentionally sparse) definition of isDefinedBy. 
I suggest a non-critical editorial change to the primer in the addition of an example included at the end of this message. 
5.4.2 rdfs:isDefinedBy rdfs:isDefinedBy is an instance of rdf:Property that is used to indicate a resource defining the subject resource. 
This property may be used to indicate an RDF vocabulary in which a resource is described. 
A triple of the form: S rdfs:isDefinedBy O states that the resource O defines S. It may be possible to retrieve representations of O from the Web, but this is not required. 
When such representations may be retrieved, no constraints are placed on the format of those representations. 
rdfs:isDefinedBy is a subproperty of rdfs:seeAlso. 
5.4. 
Other Schema Information RDF Schema also provides a number of other properties, which can be used to provide documentation and other information about an RDF schema or about instances. 
For example the rdfs:comment property can be used to provide a human-readable description of a resource. 
The rdfs:label property can be used to provide a more human-readable version of a resource's name. 
The rdfs:seeAlso property can be used to indicate a resource that might provide additional information about the subject resource. 
The rdfs:isDefinedBy property is a subproperty of rdfs:seeAlso, and can be used to indicate a resource that (in a sense not specified by RDF; e.g., the resource may not be an RDF schema) "defines" the subject resource. 
For further discussion of these properties, you should consult RDF Vocabulary Description Language 1.0: RDF Schema [RDF-VOCABULARY]. 
I would assert that these 2 documents are in sync with the (intentionally sparse) definition of isDefinedBy. 
Editorial suggestion (not critical): I suggest we include an example illustrating a potential use of this property in the primer. 
Frank, if think this is a good idea and are willing to release write-lock, i can add this and renumber the examples accordingly.

dc:description This vocabulary is a sample vocabulary which defines a set of properties useful for describing images /dc:description eric miller http://www.w3.org/people/em/ semantic web activity lead http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/ w3c world wide web consortium http://www.w3.org/ Eric, Thanks for this. 
A brief nitpic: in your example, you might consider adding '#' to the end of the URI(ref), so that it matches the uriref that'd be used to deploy the vocab as a namespace. 
other than that, seems fine. 
I was in a minority with isDefinedBy in that I wanted it to have at most one value for any given resource/property, and without that I find it of less use / interest. 
Your account below seems self-consistent though.
