<s> Can anyone provide any information about the use of PHP in coding online applications and what issues with accessibility might arise.  </s>
<s> Specifically, I was wondering if JAWS can read it and if not, what kinds of alternatives might be offered.  </s>
<s> Thanks, Diana Persell  </s>
<s> Diana, you should consult the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines - have used PHP or some other language, an online application is web content and the same rules apply.  </s>
<s> This is an active work area for the Web Content Accessiblity Guidelines working group, as we look at moving towards a WCAG version 2 - you may like to follow the discussion in that area.  </s>

<s> Hi Diana, The use of PHP does not have any implication in regards to accessibility.  </s>
<s> It's a server-side technology to deliver dynamic content over the net.  </s>
<s> Nothing else.  </s>
<s> You must follow exactly the same Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, because the end-target is to deliver HTML.  </s>
<s> We use it heavily, and from our point of view, makes the life of the webmaster easier.  </s>
<s> Although it might have a limited life-span once other Web Publishing Frameworks based on XML, XSL, XSLT and Java mature a little bit.  </s>
