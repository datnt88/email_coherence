<s> --Hi, I have started looking through the minutes, and I would like to explain the intent of 2.2.  </s>
<s> People have complain/ commented to me that they have trouble reading and concentrating on a site were there are animations and distractions.  </s>
<s> Theses comments are of course form people with ADD/ADHD.  </s>
<s> The problem is concentrating or following and not interaction.  </s>
<s> The wording has been carefully chosen - "minimize" and not "do not use" so that you can have alert boxes or other necessary distractions.  </s>
<s> However imagine an ADHD high school student trying to research a complex topic when there are ants crawling across the screen.  </s>
<s> Every time the ants come in his field of vision, he will forget what he is doing and have to start again.  </s>
<s> The designer may think that this will help make the site appeal to teenagers.  </s>
<s> But in reality many students will have to take medication before using it.  </s>
<s> An extreme example, but many animations have a similar effect.  </s>
<s> Defiantly, at least, priority three.  </s>

<s> Lisa, If it ever gets to the point where "in reality *many* students" will *have* to take meds to deal with ants crawling across the screen, I will leave the education field!  </s>
<s> Children are being overdosed with "meds" in schools now!  </s>
<s> Yes, find a way to turn off distractions, but that means the ability to turn off *anything* on the screen that is distracting, including the text ... But "do not use" isn't fair to the many users who enjoy the animations ... Remember that what is "distracting" to one person is the very thing that makes a page a memorable experience to someone else, and may be exactly what someone else needs to get the meaning of the page.  </s>

<s> How about a user agent requirement - "make the page sit still"?  </s>

<s> In the case of the walking ants, the Stop button can't control that.  </s>
<s> All it controls in IE on Windows, for example, is embedded audio and animated GIFs.  </s>
<s> It's not a standard.  </s>
<s> Actually, the Stop button itself isn't even a standard insofar as it's a user-agent widget.  </s>
<s> UAAG would have to specify its behavior, and even then, the walking-ants analogy would probably sneak through, as the Stop button would have to stop script execution on the page to stop the motion of the ants, and there's no way to selectively disable scripts or (that I'm aware of) to force cleanup/garbage collection on any given script.  </s>
<s> m  </s>
<s> Currently the Stop button doesn't stop everything as far as I know - as Matt says, scripts are a different case.  </s>
<s> So the requirement on a User Agent needs to be "make the page sit still, and it shouldbe clear that this includes motion effects due to scripting.  </s>
<s> I think it mostly is, but I will take an action item to look at that if someone promises to remind me in a few days that I said I would.  </s>
