<s> While the entire audience of UAAG, I believe, is apt to understand what a "provision" is when they stumble across the term (and it should be noted that within the UAAG document itself, they are not explicitly noted as "provisions", but only referred to as such from other sections), I think that the audience for WCAG needs a simple, accurate term here.  </s>
