<s> Ok, I've tagged validator-0_6_0-release in CVS and built tarballs from it.  </s>
<s> Tarballs are at URL:http://validator.w3.org/validator-0_6_0.tar.gz and "validator-0_6_0-release" will track the release and must be moved up if any last minute changes are made.  </s>
<s> There is also a "validator-0_6_0-branch" where maintenance on the 0.6.0 release is done (moving towards 0.6.1, say).  </s>
<s> Nominally this also means that the trunk is open for new development in the direction of 0.7.0 (IOW, your new config parser can go in whenever you feel like it Ville).  </s>
<s> :-)  </s>
<s> Expect the trunk to become periodically broken from now on.  </s>
<s> Ladies and gentlemen, you must resist those all-too-human feelings and decide this case on the evidence.  </s>
<s> And the evidence plainly shows that Mr. Landa's injuries, disfiguring as they are, are nowhere near as important to a free society as the fundamental right to make smart-ass remarks.  </s>

<s> That'll be tomorrow evening (GMT+2).  </s>
<s> I'll see about the RPMs then as well.  </s>
<s> Thanks for your efforts, Terje!  </s>
<s> When do we see The New One replacing the old public validator?  </s>

<s> Possibly during today, .jp  </s>

<s> Depending on how scheduling stuff works out best for Olivier (and myself I suppose).  </s>
<s> By definition there is _no_way_ any problem can be my fault.  </s>
<s> Any problems you think you can find in my code are in your imagination.  </s>
<s> If you continue with such derranged imaginings then I may be forced to perform corrective brain surgery... with an axe! -- Stephen Harris  </s>
