Hello, 1. 
I believe the words Priority 1, 2 and 3 with their definitions conveyed that the focus of the checkpoints was on successively increasing levels of accessibility ... vital -essential-desirable for accessibility, in a way better than that conveyed by the terms coreand extended. 
Admittedly, there are different perspectives on the priority levels assigned to some checkpoints in WCAG1. 
But a P3 checkpoint enhances accessibility and therefore usability and shows the way ahead as is intended for "best practices". 
So why not stick with the terms P1, P2 and P3... it will also be "backward compatible"... Goal 6 for WCAG2 in requirements doc. 
The required success criteria should be categorized as P1 or P2 or P3. 2. The best practices (as presently documented) should be put in a separate document distinct from techniques.It can be linked to the techniques doc. 
What is "best" may be very situational and might depend on the circumstances : the technology used for creating the Web content, user agent, as well as access technology used by end user, the intended audience for a particular website, etc. Sailesh Panchang Senior Accessibility Engineer Deque Systems Inc 11180 Sunrise Valley Drive, 4th Floor, Reston VA 20191 E-mail: sailesh.panchang@deque.com

* Others have argued, however, that precisely because the conceptions of conformance levels have changed so radically between WCAG 1.0 and WCAG 2.0, the same terms (Priority 1, Priority 2 and Priority 3) should not be carried forward into the 2.0 document, as this would create confusion for those who are already acquainted with the 1.0 conformance structure and its definitions. 
To summarize, the WCAG 1.0 priorities were built on the idea that adherence to certain design principles would, respectively, remove barriers that precluded access to the content by identifiable groups of users (P1), barriers that made it very difficult for certain groups to access the content (P2) and difficulties that reduced the effectiveness with which the content could be accessed. 
This explanation, I should emphasize, is only my hasty attempt to give an informal summary of the 1.0 definitions, and should in no way be interpreted as supplementing, clarifying or replacing the formal definitions in the 1.0 document. 
In developing WCAG 2.0, the distinctions underpinning the 1.0 priority definitions were subjected to detailed, critical scrutiny, with the result that the working group decided they were no longer tenable for purposes of the 2.0 document, and that a new set of distinctions was needed to classify checkpoints and success criteria in constructing the 2.0 conformance scheme. 
The argument for new terminology, then, is that unless different terms were used, readers acquainted with 1.0 would construe 2.0 as following the same, or a similar, system of priorities and conformance levels as WCAG 1.0, and would make policy decisions and claims about accessibility on that erroneous, but tempting, presupposition. 
The new terminology is supposed to signal the fact that the 2.0 categories of core and extended are very different from the 1.0 priorities, and that the impossible/difficult/easier approach worked out in the 1.0 conformance scheme does not apply to 2.0. 
My purpose in stating these arguments is not to defend them, though I do happen to find them persuasive, but to attempt to recapitulate the reasons which led the working group to the conclusion that new terminology was needed and that retention of the old terminology would do more harm than good. 
Comments, counter-arguments and proposals are, of course, most welcome. 
If anyone is dissatisfied with the working group's prior decisions on this matter, the issue should be re-opened in the context of our ongoing conformance discussion. 
not success result purposes of I have to agree with Sailesh to some extent, when I first looked at the WCAG 2.0 draft I was a little taken aback. 
Although I will admit the mapping document does go some of the way to easing comparison between the two versions. 
People using and conforming to version one might be surprised. 
However what has struck me as something that we should perhaps aim at is presenting a guideline which is future proofed. 
It is 4 years since the original guideline was published and there is still work to do on the current, this means that WCAG 1.0 will, by the time it is replaced, have had a lifetime of 5 years or more. 
Personally I regard the Priority 3 guidelines as eminently achievable for the most part with today's browsers and today's multimedia. 
As such should we not look to adding an amount of future proofing to WCAG 2.0 since it too has to last 5 years are we sure it will remain relevant?

I've always found the term "extended" troublesome, though I've not said so before because I haven't been able quite to put my finger on the problem. 
For that matter, "core" isn't so easy either. 
Would it work to replace "core" and "extended" with "minimum" and "advanced," respectively? 
If not, what do "core" and "extended" actually mean, and what connotations do we need to be sure to capture and preserve? 
(Answers to this question might help us come up with better terminology and/or clearer statements about the conformance scheme.

I do not see how the "impossible/difficult/easier approach worked out in WCAG 1.0" corresponding to P1, P2, P3 terms is different from core and extended. 
Core checkpoints signify that they are vital to accessibilitty just as the P1 or "impossible to access" checkpoints indicated in 1.0.

I fail to see how they are "very different" from the P1, p2 scheme and why the WCAG1 scheme is "untenable".

Can I turn to some document for the new concepts underlying WCAG 2? Nor have the terms core and extended been defined anywhere in WCAG 2.0. 
The choice of terms "core" and "extended" certainly need further deliberation and justification.

In 1.0 it was priority 1,2,3 based on user need In 2.0 the dividing line between core and extended is not user need but whether it involved constraining the content or presentation. 
Core do not make you change the document visually - just mark it up or add hidden text (or audio) equivalents. 
There are many extended checkpoints that are VERY important. 
The closes thing we have to P1 and P2 was the two levels of implementation for each checkpoint. 
But the discussion of late has been to drop those. 
The result is (or would be if we have no levels) that we do not have any priority rating or indications of importance. 
It is true that all the core checkpoints are important. 
But it is not true that all the important checkpoints are core. 
We need to think about this.. 
I like the simpler form we have - but I worry that the simplicity is coming at the expense of completeness or proper comprehension of the checkpoints. 
Perhaps instead of core and extended we should name them something like - content neutral - content amending or something. 
I wouldn't suggest those terms but you get the idea... 
I just can't think of the right terms off the top of my head.

I still have some fundamental concerns about the idea that CORE checkpoints are (or should be) those that don't require content developers and designers to change the default visual presentation. 
My concern is both philosophical and pragmatic. 
I am not interested in mere conformance; I'm interested in accessibility. 
And I'm convinced that accessibility *does* require different ways of thinking about the design of Web resources. 
The most common design practice is to begin with look and feel; to come up with a compelling visual presentation-- often presented for design review in the form of Photoshop *images*. 
Once everyone agrees that it *looks* good, someone *may* ask how to make that design accessible. 
This means that they're retrofitting for accessibility before they've even begun to implement the design! 
It's *much* more difficult that way, and the results are much less satisfying-- like putting up a brand-new building and then saying, "Oh, where should we put the wheelchair ramp?" 
I'm sure I would feel differently if more of the default visual presentations of Web content were more usable by the temporarily able-bodied. 
But there are all those usability studies in which people without disabilities fail to complete routine tasks somewhere between 40 and 60 percent of the time. 
So what's the point of tying ourselves in knots to preserve default visual presentations that are hard for *everybody* when forcing people to think harder about design might actually make things better for everybody, too? 
That's the pragmatic concern. 
The philosophical one goes something like this: Accessible design is an extension of user-centered design. 
I'm concerned that the current criteria for distinguishing "core" from "extended" is *developer*-centered. 
Not that developers aren't among the end-users of our documents; but ultimately the guidelines are in the service of end-users who have disabilities. 
I would argue, then, that extended checkpoints that we agree are truly important to meeting the needs of users with disabilities should go into the "core."

The required success criteria should be categorized as P1 or P2 or P3. Message1. 
Well then, the proposed conformance system (claim to core / extended / core+ etc) is no measure of accessibility at all. 
I believe that a system that measures conformance to accessibility guidelines must: - consider impact on usability for user population being served by the accessibility guidelines by - assessing compliance against checkpoints (and accessibility guidelines) applicable to a page / site / application. 
I fully agree with John's statement that the distinction between core and extended is developer-centered" as "Core do not make you change the document visually - just mark it up or add hidden text (or audio) "equivalents"". 
(I recognize that some content that is meant to give a "sensory experience" (recent list discussions) cannot really be made "accessible".). 
If some "extended checkpoints are also important", then a website that claims only "core" might still have many serious accessibility-related flaws. 
How does it matter to me as a website user, if a website claims "core" level? 
What does it tell me about the accessibility level of the site? 
For instance say of the important-to-accessibility checkpoints applicable to a site, only 25 percent belong to the core group while 75 percent belong to the extended group. 
2. So the core checkpoints might probably be relatively easy and quick in some instances to make content accessible. 
How is the process used to make Web content accessible relevant to a conformance to an accessibility claim? 
How does it matter if the developer needs to spend three minutes or three hours to make some content accessible as per the organizations adopted accessibility policy? 
If the developers realize that the technology or design adopted does not support the required accessibility level and need to make drastic changes in order to gain compliance, then they may be required to do so. 
An analogy: how is the time/process/cost needed to build a bridge relevant to a statement on the "safety level" of the bridge? 
We should not drift away from the objective of measuring accessibility to user population served by the guidelines. 
3. And this measure must definitely consider importance of the checkpoints with respect to accessibility. 
For instance absence of a text descriptor for an image that is important to understanding content is a serious violation. 
But if every link begins with the words "Link to" instead of the key/action word in the link, it may make navigation inefficient(but not inaccessible) for the screen reader user trying to navigate using a list of links pulled up by the access technology used. 
This will be a less serious accessibility violationn. 
So I am afraid I am again proposing the conformance system used for WCAG 1.0. 
4. By the way, the philosophy underlying core / extended is radically differennt but what are the serious weaknesses / limitations or disadvantages of P1/P2/P3 system? 
Is it so vital to adopt a new conformance system to measure accessibility? 
Why not proceed with a workable system already in use, perhaps with some tweeking? 
The P1/P2/P3 system has been used by other W3C guidelines including the one that measures the QA process for creating W3C guidelines. 
Please do not interpret this as resistance to change, but I want a good reason to subscribe to the _new accessibility_ conformance system being advocated by WCAG 2.0.

Lots here. 
Let me see if I can shed some light. 
Core and extended - is based on the premise that there will be difficulty passing laws that affect people's freedom to express themselves. 
This is another civil rights issue held by people with and without disabilities. 
Within each checkpoint there is Required and Best Practice and also Additional Information. 
This is the equivalent of priority. 
The most important or highest priority things for each checkpoint are in the required. 
If you want a A, Double A and Triple A format you can use A = Core AA = Core plus Extended AAA = Core plus Extended plus Best Practice (for core and extended checkpoints) No one ever gets AAA with WCAG 1.0 - and those that claim it are always attacked by others saying that they didn't really do one thing or another. 
In 2.0 it looks like we are heading toward having AAA (Best Practice) not be normative. 
But that could change. 
Please note that there is one big difference with 1.0. 
In 1.0 we decided that some checkpoint were more important than others. 
In 2.0 we recognized that what was "helpful" to some was "critical" to others. 
Thus do specifically decided NOT to rate the checkpoints as P1, 2, 3. All checkpoints have same "priority". 
They are divided into those that can be done without restricting expression (CORE) and those that involve changing the expression to make it more accessible without using AT (Extended). 
The CORE require the person use AT or some accessibility feature in their User Agent, in order to access the content. 
WITHIN each checkpoint we then have different priority assigned to different measures or techniques for addressing the checkpoint. 
That is where our priority rating lies. 
Required success criteria are the highest priority. 
Best practice is for those who want to go beyond the minimum for any checkpoint. 
There are also often a number of additional items of information or advisories for a checkpoint. 
Hope this is helpful in undestanding where we are. 
I don't know where we will be exactly when we end, but we didn't get here by accident. 
There were carefully thought out decisions made about the underlying rationale for these. 
This note is an attempt to quickly lay out what some of those were. 
Those with questions - please come to the working group teleconferences. 
It is hard for me to type out all the rationale in a short memo - and respond to questions. 
Also, you need to address the working group as a whole to get the full story. 
Please come.

I believe that a system that measures conformance to accessibility guidelines must: - consider impact on usability for user population being served by the accessibility guidelines by - assessing compliance against checkpoints (and accessibility guidelines) applicable to a page / site / application. 
I fully agree with John's statement that the distinction between core and extended is developer-centered" as "Core do not make you change the document visually - just mark it up or add hidden text (or audio) "equivalents"". 
(I recognize that some content that is meant to give a "sensory experience" (recent list discussions) cannot really be made "accessible".). 
If some "extended checkpoints are also important", then a website that claims only "core" might still have many serious accessibility-related flaws. 
How does it matter to me as a website user, if a website claims "core" level? 
What does it tell me about the accessibility level of the site? 
For instance say of the important-to-accessibility checkpoints applicable to a site, only 25 percent belong to the core group while 75 percent belong to the extended group. 
2. So the core checkpoints might probably be relatively easy and quick in some instances to make content accessible. 
How is the process used to make Web content accessible relevant to a conformance to an accessibility claim? 
How does it matter if the developer needs to spend three minutes or three hours to make some content accessible as per the organizations adopted accessibility policy? 
If the developers realize that the technology or design adopted does not support the required accessibility level and need to make drastic changes in order to gain compliance, then they may be required to do so. 
An analogy: how is the time/process/cost needed to build a bridge relevant to a statement on the "safety level" of the bridge? 
We should not drift away from the objective of measuring accessibility to user population served by the guidelines. 
3. And this measure must definitely consider importance of the checkpoints with respect to accessibility. 
For instance absence of a text descriptor for an image that is important to understanding content is a serious violation. 
But if every link begins with the words "Link to" instead of the key/action word in the link, it may make navigation inefficient(but not inaccessible) for the screen reader user trying to navigate using a list of links pulled up by the access technology used. 
This will be a less serious accessibility violationn. 
So I am afraid I am again proposing the conformance system used for WCAG 1.0. 
4. By the way, the philosophy underlying core / extended is radically differennt but what are the serious weaknesses / limitations or disadvantages of P1/P2/P3 system? 
Is it so vital to adopt a new conformance system to measure accessibility? 
Why not proceed with a workable system already in use, perhaps with some tweeking? 
The P1/P2/P3 system has been used by other W3C guidelines including the one that measures the QA process for creating W3C guidelines. 
Please do not interpret this as resistance to change, but I want a good reason to subscribe to the _new accessibility_ conformance system being advocated by WCAG 2.0. 
Thanks for your time and indulgence, Sailesh Panchang, Senior Accessibility Engineer Deque Systems, Reston, Virginia 20191 Tel 703-225-0380 (ext 105) In 1.0 it was priority 1,2,3 based on user need In 2.0 the dividing line between core and extended is not user need but whether it involved constraining the content or presentation. 
In 2.0 the dividing line between core and extended is not user need but whether it involved constraining the content or presentation. 
Core do not make you change the document visually - just mark it up or add hidden text (or audio) equivalents. 
There are many extended checkpoints that are VERY important. 
It is true that all the core checkpoints are important. 
But it is not true that all the important checkpoints are core. 
"I still have some fundamental concerns about the idea that CORE checkpoints are (or should be) those that don't require content developers and designers to change the efault visual presentation. 
I'm concerned that the current criteria for distinguishing "core" from "extended" is *developer*-centered. 
I would argue, then, that extended checkpoints that we agree are truly important to meeting the needs of users with disabilities should go into the "core. 
John" On Tuesday, September 16, 2003 12:07 AM Jason White "Others have argued, however, that precisely because the conceptions of conformance levels have changed so radically between WCAG 1.0 and WCAG 2.0, the same terms (Priority 1, Priority 2 and Priority 3) should not be carried forward into the 2.0 document, as this would create confusion for those who are already acquainted with the 1.0 conformance structure and its definitions. 
In developing WCAG 2.0, the distinctions underpinning the 1.0 priority definitions were subjected to detailed, critical scrutiny, with the result that the working group decided they were no longer tenable for purposes of the 2.0 document, and that a new set of distinctions was needed to classify checkpoints and success criteria in constructing the 2.0 conformance scheme. 
The argument for new terminology, then, is that unless different terms were used, readers acquainted with 1.0 would construe 2.0 as following the same, or a similar, system of priorities and conformance levels as WCAG 1.0, and would make policy decisions and claims about accessibility on that erroneous, but tempting, presupposition. 
The new terminology is supposed to signal the fact that the 2.0 categories of core and extended are very different from the 1.0 priorities, and that the impossible/difficult/easier approach worked out in the 1.0 conformance scheme does not apply to 2.0." 
My purpose in stating these arguments is not to defend them, though I do happen to find them persuasive, but to attempt to recapitulate the reasons which led the working group to the conclusion that new terminology was needed and that retention of the old terminology would do more harm than good. 
Comments, counter-arguments and proposals are, of course, most welcome. 
If anyone is dissatisfied with the working group's prior decisions on this matter, the issue should be re-opened in the context of our ongoing conformance discussion. 
Ah One additional point - Although we do not set policy, there was a strong sentiment that we should design our guidelines keeping in mind the constraints of those that do. 
The goal would be to create something that could be adopted without extensive editing or opting in and out. 
The industry representatives in particular were concerned that if we didn't, they could face different versions adopted into regulation by different countries, states, etc making it much more complicated for them. 
(or impossible - if they actually edited them in conflicting ways).
