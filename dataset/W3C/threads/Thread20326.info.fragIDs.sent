<s> Hello Karl-Michael, In our previous episode, Karl-Michael Schneider said:  </s>
<s> This is a bug in Amaya.  </s>
<s> That page declares a table with a WIDTH attribute equal to zero.  </s>
<s> Amaya wasn't protected against this case and this causes a division by zero.  </s>
<s> We just commited the bug fix to CVS.  </s>
<s> If you can remove the WITH attribute or assign it another value, you'll be able to browse that page.  </s>
<s> Thanks for your report!  </s>
