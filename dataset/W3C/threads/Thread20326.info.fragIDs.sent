Amaya crashes when I try to load this URL: 
Amaya version is: amaya - V2.4 17 Dec 1999 PC-Intel Linux format binary distribution Machine is i586 with Suse Linux kernel 2.0.36 Regards, Karl-Michael Schneider 
Lynx says the HTML is bad (which causes crashes). 
Have you tried checking it with the W3C validator?

Hello Karl-Michael, In our previous episode, Karl-Michael Schneider said: 
This is a bug in Amaya. 
That page declares a table with a WIDTH attribute equal to zero. 
Amaya wasn't protected against this case and this causes a division by zero. 
We just commited the bug fix to CVS. 
If you can remove the WITH attribute or assign it another value, you'll be able to browse that page. 
Thanks for your report! 
Regards, -Jose
