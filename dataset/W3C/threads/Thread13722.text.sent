Agenda A. How do we evaluate alternate pages, e.g. from web sites that generate different views of pages on a server ? 
Cf. recent email from wendy [1] and Kynn [2] B. AERT Open Issues. 
Wendy and I made some proposals to close some open issues. 
The open issues list is at [3]. 
Please search for word "Proposal" to quickly get to the items. 
C. Face to face meeting. 
We shall be meeting as a group Thursday. 
The afternoon will be a joint meeting with GL and AU. Plus: There will be an ad-hoc subgroup meeting among people interested in the nitty gritty RDF notation of EARL on Friday, during the technique breakout sessions of WCAG. 
This will be a working meeting aimed at a common understanding that can be used for writing real code. 
Who's interested in the ad-hoc subgroup meeting?
