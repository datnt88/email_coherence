Had an action item to work on wording of 1.1 Here it is Rewording of proposed solution to include input from telecon Ability to be expressed in words This refers to content whose function or intended purpose can be expressed accurately and unambiguously in a reasonable number of words (for example, diagrams, charts, illustrations,etc.) Content such as a musical performance or visual artwork is not considered "content that can be expressed in words," if the intended purpose is to present the performance since a performance relies heavily on the visual (or auditory) experience and cannot be expressed accurately and unambiguously in words (even if the musical score can be).

I repeat my complaint that WAI and the WCAG WG continue to delude themselves that everything can be boiled down to a "reasonable number of words," i.e., "diagrams, charts, illustrations, etc." are actually superfluous and offer no marginal benefit over "reasonable number[s]" of words. 
WAI and WCAG WG members obviously, after having had four years to study this issue, still fail to understand that people draw "diagrams, charts, illustrations" because *data relationships cannot be adequately summed up in words*. 
Words-words-words: That's all WAI wants on every Web page everywhere, save of course for those Web pages that must be "supplemented" with "non-text content" for people with learning disabilities. 
It is false to contend that "diagrams, charts, illustrations" categorically constitute content that can be expressed in words. 
WAI and the WCAG WG continue to flaunt their ignorance of the philosophy and practice of "diagrams, charts, illustrations," yet WAI and WCAG WG have the temerity to dictate to the rest of the world that "diagrams, charts, illustrations" can be "expressed accurately and unambiguously in a reasonable number of words." 
I'll give you the same homework assignment I gave you before: Take ten examples from each of Edward Tufte's volumes and "express [them] accurately and unambiguously in a reasonable number of words." 
WAI and WCAG WG peck away at picayune peripheral issues, tending to get even those wrong, and never quite twig to the fact that their central themes are even more wrong.

Author, _Building Accessible Websites_ "Expressed in words" is used by the WAI and WCAG WG for specific reasons -- they feel that it meets specific needs of specific audiences. 
Presumably, even though you disagree with the dictate of "expressed in words," you understand that they're not just issuing it arbitrarily. 
What alternate "central theme" would you suggest that meets the needs expressed by WCAG WG via "ability to be expressed in words" but which is more suitable in the face of your objections? 
This is not asking for a simple rewording -- you claim there's a conceptual problem. 
WCAG WG would not be willing to give up on their core concept unless they are assured that the needs which led to "expressed in words" are still met, and not simply discarded. 
Therefore, I'd like to hear from you, Joe, what replacement concept you have to offer. 
You are arguing that WCAG WG must change to another concept than the current one -- but you have given no hint of what may involve. 
The current concept meets needs. 
A replacement must either meet those same needs, or somehow prove that those needs don't really exist after all. 
That, I think, is why you are meeting resistance to your ideas, Joe -- apart from your abrasive method of communication. 
--Kynn PS: Joe may simply ignore this email and its question, as he has indicated to me that he will discard any email I write which appears to be critical of his communication style. 
In such a case, I'd encourage other members of the working group to likewise set aside the matter of Joe's manners, and instead continue with the approach outlined above -- ask Joe, simply and clearly, what he proposes as an alternative, given the perceived needs of the working group, needs which resulted in the current concept. 
Thanks.

They're in the list archive from back in the Spring, and the subject line reads as follows: RE: REF 1.1a - Add definition to 1.1 for ability to be expressed in words As you'll see if you follow that thread, there are a number of people in the working group who share at least some of your belifes about the complex relationships between words and images and would like to find better language for this and related checkpoints. 
Please give us a concrete suggestions for language we might be able to use and I assure you we'll consider it.

Author, _Building Accessible Websites_ get As the newcomer to the WG I think I have some level of objectivity to whatever issues exist between Joe and the list. 
My take on what Joe is saying is this: If we try and force people to provide an alternative, which is "expressed in words", to complex non-text content we run the risk of alienating content providers from other more attainable goals which are perhaps more immediately useful. 
Being a fan of Tufte myself, and having some background in Information Architecture, I sympathise with the problems associated with displaying complex information (and often raw data) in a meaningful, or at least digestible, form. 
I would suggest that in their enthusiasm to provide the best possible accessibility standards the working group may be setting goals which are uneconomic or simply too difficult for content providers. 
As a web developer who advocates (as we all do) standards compliance it is plain that getting people to follow such standards as XHTML is difficult enough. 
If we then compare XHTML to WCAG; content providers are upset (not through any fault of ours) because accessibility, being a subset of usability, is not something one can just automate, it requires thought and human appraisals. 
As such it seems critical to the success of the WCAG, and hence the WAI, that the recommendations we purpose are achievable goals. 
Perhaps more importantly they should be perceived by content providers as achievable goals. 
I do openly admit that there are two levels of compliance in the current WCAG 2.0 draft, and I am keen for us to explore all options before we discount them. 
However if most content providers feel threatened by a recommendation that appears restrictive and is not open and shut (as XHTML is), overly zealous rules will only serve to further the view that standards of accessibility are unachievable. 
I know this does not answer the question Kynn effectively posed of "What other alternatives can you give?" but maybe it posses a more poignant one, "What alternatives at all can we persuade content providers to give?" Tom Croucher Co-founder Netalley Networks (http://www.netalleynetworks.com), 
BSc(Hons) Computing Student / Information Services Staff University of Sunderland (http://www.sunderland.ac.uk), Accessibility Co-ordinator Plone CMS (http://www.plone.org) 
It is true here, as Joe says, that we don't just need a better definition, we need a better idea. 
"Just do what is possible to express verbally" is an unending assignment. 
There has to be some other principle we can bring to bear. 
And there is. 
The right goal for our effort, as Tom has suggested, is "what tip of the information iceberg is most important to get articulated verbally, and how can we get authors over the hump to articulate that?" 
If we can communicate the right questions to the authors, they will be able to articulate the answers. 
Framing the questions is the key. 
And then follow-through. 
Because gaps in the access infrastructure that the author intended won't be obvious without aided inspection of the page. 
The good news is that the theory for what to do is nearly there in the rest of what we are already saying. 
Summarize, decompose, orient, navigate. 
Moreover, some practices to promote are already out there on the web in what content providers are already doing. 
We just need to refine our story to get more content posted using more of the good practices. 
The piece of this job that looks doable in the near term is to coach the author through a bit of scene modeling and get them to articulate what is in their scene, some principal properties of each such thing, and principal relationships among these things. 
Then we will be getting somewhere. 
This will create a guide to their scene in an entity/relationship/attribute graph with navigable relationships and speakable attributes. 
It's up to the format to create the marriage by which this gloss infiltrates or decorates the scene the author has constructed by which to tell their story. 
Once we understand how to combine more- and less- critical information in the computer representation, the whole plan is scalable to provide more or less drill-down depth as the topic and the content developer's skills allow. 
[The URCC primitives: "What's there?" "What can I do?" are still the core of what we have to lure out of authors. 
Imagine yourself answering these questions over the phone...] Furthermore, there is a body of practice to pick up and extend, already out there on the web, that will take away the worst of the problem and if systematically applied across the web, leave a more universally usable state of practice than what we have now. 
This is how GIS information is served on quote map sites unquote. 
A GIS-like information base is usable enough in diverse enough modes of access as to be considered a 'universal design' level of information architecture. 
I claim that "universally accessible GIS is readily achievable," and "GIS-like" is a good working notion for a class of information structures that the authors should be led to create (at least for now). 
Accessing these information structures takes the right sorts of access methods, but these are systematically implementable in libraries and pragmas and don't have to be re-invented graphic by graphic. 
Web content developers can be led to an 'aha' experience saying "this is more doable than it first looked" by reviewing how the information that is conventionally considered "map information" is also served [on the competitive map sites] through verbal dialogs as well. 
As Tom reminds us, this is critical to our success; perfect guidelines that fail in the EO process are not doing any PWDs any good. 
Talking about creating a GIS-like infiltration of the scene presented on the web screen helps the content designer/developer think in graph terms and not be forced to take the harder conceptual leap to a linear narrative. 
Anything we do to lower the potential barrier to getting over the belief that it's too hard is golden, is critical to our success. 
Presented with a tree-view presentation of the objects they have identified in their scene, an author can readily from this view create a sensible tour, a linear reading order. 
Separating the questions of contents from order will make the job more doable by real people in the content development activity. 
Appropriate use of hierarchy in the scene description eases the dependency on linear order. 
This is especially important in the Tufte domain where the information graphs are not gracefully projectable into a sequence. 
Users can, after all, follow non-linear graphs of navigable relations so long as they are marked well enough with labels that evoke axes of relationship that stick in the user's head. 
The easiest way to do this of course is to evoke patterns of relationship that are common in the users' life experience. 
But there are lots of multidimensional tuples of axes that are common enough experience so we don't have to wrestle every data space into an essay outline.

Plus: What is it that you want the user to feel as well as know? 
Put the analysis in together with the historical snapshot of the cited page available as The excerpt from the National Braille Association Tape Recording Manual at [1] gives advice on writing descriptions of illustrations, diagrams, maps, tables, charts, and graphs. 
It includes several examples of images and their descriptions. 
To provide authors the first step to get over the hump, in the excerpt the first step in writing a description of a figure is: Ask yourself, "Why is it there? 
What does it illustrate or add to the text?" 
Stress these points and avoid inconsequential details. 
The excerpt begins with general guidance and becomes more specific to the different types of visual information.
