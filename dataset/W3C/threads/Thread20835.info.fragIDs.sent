<s> Hi, Could the "Dialogue language" be chosen in the Amaya setup?  </s>

<s> Not yet.  </s>
<s> Normally we just have to change the following line in the file Amaya\config\win-thot.rc: LANG-en Does somebody know how to do that in the setup??  </s>
<s> Irene.  </s>
<s> I only wonder in what language to ask the user what language she/he likes...  </s>
<s> On Unix machines, there is an environment language which can be used.  </s>
<s> I bet there is something on M$WIndows machiens to.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, C is the best default (C, a kind of english, a lot of users might understand, not US-english, not UK-english).  </s>
<s> Something like: Choose your language: English / Choisissez votre langue: Fran?ais / Escoja su idioma: Espa?ol / W?hlen Sie Ihre Sprache: Deutsch / etc.  </s>
<s> If it's part of an installation program/wizard, just make a dialog with no title, and each language named in that language.  </s>
<s> Most people will work out that they should choose the option they can read, not any of the ones they can't.  </s>
<s> * English * Fran?ais * Espa?ol * Deutsch If you wanted to the really clever, the OK button would change name with the current selection :-) Scott  </s>
