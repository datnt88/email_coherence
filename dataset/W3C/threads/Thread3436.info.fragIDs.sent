<s> Hi there.  </s>
<s> This is the first [Summary] message.  </s>
<s> Fortunately it's not intended to re-state the scope of this list, which has been well respected so far, congratulations to all.  </s>
<s> Unless it proves itself useless, or annoying, we'll try to issue such [Summary] messages every once in a while, to summarize discussion (can be useful for new participants) and the main points stated, focus on some topics, and eventually prepare deliverables.  </s>
<s> This is the first [Summary] message, so it will be special.  </s>
<s> Instead of proposing you a summary and/or orientations (which I shall do later), I'll simply ask "what next?".  </s>
<s> This should be a thrilling question, but it could be our nemesis : excluding "intro" messages (very useful and interesting to find out what are the context, goals and expectations for each of us), a few book promotion, and a call for review of a document under work, we already had a few rounds of discussions.  </s>
<s> Some of them hold their own value, others will be wasted time (or mere re-doing the world again and again) if they're not followed by action, or turned into "real" documents.  </s>
<s> Here are, therefore, a few proposed deliverables for this group.  </s>
<s> These deliverables can be done and hosted here (i.e W3C), or elsewhere (newborn maccaws group[1] comes to mind, but there are many other site gathering such documents), not a problem as long as (John Colby told this very well) we parallelize but don't step on each others' toes.  </s>
<s> First, lists.  </s>
<s> I must say I don't fancy lists : they're hard to maintain up-to-date, hard to make really objective - not just advertisement -,  </s>
<s> etc. Plus, we're at W3C, with vendor neutrality as a core principle, that could make it trickier... Lists ideas which have been floating in the air: - standard compliant "big" websites - web standards books and reviews [2] - "resources", standards evangelism websites We could also, and that's an orientation I deem worthwile, turn our discussion into "white-paper" style documents.  </s>
<s> reading through the discussion threads, I see a few candidates already (I shall prepare summaries of those threads later): - WYSIWYG or multi-platform, why standards can help achieve both - metrics and cost/benefits business cases - defining metrics (framework) - cost/benefits of using valid HTML - cost/benefit of using CSS for style - others?  </s>
<s> - answering misconceptions about web standards (Karl Dubost from W3C QA, in an article to be released, answers, with a systematic yet not pedantic approach, a few misconceptions; this could/should be extended)  </s>
<s> Third idea is to contact and educate people.  </s>
<s> - contact and educate web agencies (We - W3C QA - are already working on a "what you should propose to your clients" note) - contact and educate companies (We - W3C QA - are already working on a "what you should ask your web design agency/web department) - contact and educate teachers and the education world - contact and educate governments  </s>
<s> But for all of those, again, we need more than good will and enthusiasm to convince, we need material, resources, proofs, figures.  </s>
<s> This may be yet another good thing to work on here.  </s>
<s> I suggest we pick a few work orientations among those, and try to focus on them and try to produce tangible bits out of our discussions.  </s>

<s> Yours, Olivier Olivier Thereaux - W3C  </s>
<s> I agree that objectivity is hard to establish with any list of resources.  </s>
<s> Still, the snappy appeal of a numbered list -- the literary equivalent of a soundbyte -- should not be underrated.  </s>
<s> It gets immediate attention, and if the list is handled properly, it can be an enormously popular/useful resource.  </s>
<s> Perhaps we can address this "objectivity" challenge, somewhere, with a distributed approach to rating the books (and online resources).  </s>
<s> Sort of like the Amazon approach, but more closely targeted at the specific industry we're in.  </s>
<s> I for one would love to see a list of books with ratings distilled from the votes of my peers -- that is to say, the people who care about good website design.  </s>
<s> I live in a remote community, where I must purchase books sight-unseen.  </s>
<s> It would be nice to know the aggregate opinions of everyone here, and on our sister lists -- if I follow all the good suggestions so far, Amazon will eat my paycheque.  </s>
<s> I'll follow this with the typical Overworked Webmaster's Pledge: "If no one has done this, and no one is planning to, I'll do it, in a while".  </s>
<s> -Joseph  </s>
<s> It would be worthwhile to find out what kind of materials will best suit teachers and people who are educating the next generation of Web developers/designers. Different Web courses are written for target audiences - courses which cater for websites for small businesses, personal websites, technical web development, and so forth.  </s>
<s> Therefore, materials we produce might have to be targeted, or somehow 'rehashable'.  </s>
<s> We would have to give sound explanations on the need to teach standards.  </s>
<s> Perhaps a kind of framework for this can be presented at local Web conferences which are more academic, so that educators can spread the word between themselves?  </s>
<s> Thoughts?  </s>
<s> cheers, -steph random web dudette  </s>
