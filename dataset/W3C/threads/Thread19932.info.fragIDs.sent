<s> There isn't a really good way to do this in HTML.  </s>
<s> The trick that people use is to make a table, and use centred alignment in each of the cells.  </s>
<s> The cells then auto-size in many browsers, which provides even spacing.  </s>
<s> But using tables for layout in this way is not realy what they were meant for, and can raise accessibility problems.  </s>

<s> An alternative would be to use display:float in a stylesheet, but I haven't tried to do that in amaya yet, so I don't know how you do it or whether it is implemented.  </s>

<s> It's not forbidden to create a table of links or a table of icons in any HTML document :-) Irene.  </s>
<s> This is my personal statement.  </s>
<s> Let me clarify again that I am not part of the Amaya team - my work at W3C is on accessibility.  </s>
<s> I just use Amaya because I like it, and try to help people use it where I think I have something to contribute.  </s>
<s> The potential accessibility problems are caused by doing certain specific things with tables - for more details refer to the URI I gave (below).  </s>
<s> In practise, using a table to neatly display a row of images or short text links does not usually cause problems, although the new W3C styles have stopped using tables in this way.  </s>
<s> In an ideal world I would recommend that Amaya not use this either.  </s>
<s> But it is not of crucial importance, and is a use pattern which should disappear as the implementation of style sheets is improved.  </s>
<s> So I am happy that the Amaya team puts its energy into doing more important things.  </s>
