Hi. This may not be the forum for this but I'd like to try anyway. 
I'm trying to use amaya 1.4a and what I'd like to do is set up a row of buttons (.gif's) spaced evenly across the page but after I insert the button images and the spaces to separate them, re-loading the page eliminates the spaces between the images. 
I thought I saw something on this some time back, but I'm unable to find it now. 
Any suggestions to get this to work would be appreciated, especially if there is a better way to do this. 
thanks, tony mollica tmollica@silcom.com 
Hi Tony, Sorry for the delay, but we're very busy.

This will work in next release. 
Meanwhile I suggest you to insert a "Control Space" between your images which will generate a &amp;nbsp; 
Irene. 
There isn't a really good way to do this in HTML. 
The trick that people use is to make a table, and use centred alignment in each of the cells. 
The cells then auto-size in many browsers, which provides even spacing. 
But using tables for layout in this way is not realy what they were meant for, and can raise accessibility problems. 
(For a fuller discussion see 
"don't use tables for layout". 
Which is actually listed as a checkpoint in the guidelines.) 
An alternative would be to use display:float in a stylesheet, but I haven't tried to do that in amaya yet, so I don't know how you do it or whether it is implemented.

Then, Why is it used in the Amaya startup page? 
Or is this your personal statement? 
It is done (with text buttons, but that's no problem) in the Amaya startup page!

It's not forbidden to create a table of links or a table of icons in any HTML document :-) Irene. 
This is my personal statement. 
Let me clarify again that I am not part of the Amaya team - my work at W3C is on accessibility. 
I just use Amaya because I like it, and try to help people use it where I think I have something to contribute. 
The potential accessibility problems are caused by doing certain specific things with tables - for more details refer to the URI I gave (below). 
In practise, using a table to neatly display a row of images or short text links does not usually cause problems, although the new W3C styles have stopped using tables in this way. 
In an ideal world I would recommend that Amaya not use this either. 
But it is not of crucial importance, and is a use pattern which should disappear as the implementation of style sheets is improved. 
So I am happy that the Amaya team puts its energy into doing more important things.
