Hi, I would like to know whether with webdav there is any provision to advertising the shares available on a given server? 
The idea, with the, conjunction of a technology such as Rendezvous, would be to list the servers with 'shares' in local area and then list the webdav resources being made available by the server. 
regards Andre Ander, No, there isn't. 
It would be nice tho'.

If this indeed the case, maybe this is something that should be examined? 
Maybe a simple solution to this (note - two second analysis ;) would be an XML file at the root. 
The file would have a standard name, maybe something such as webdav.xml and would list the shares: guest="yes"/ The server would have the option of dynamically changing the published xml file depending on whether the file was request with a user name or without. 
With this in mind, any client should probably support a redirection to another URL which provides the data - this is in order to allow retrofitting of this functionality to existing servers, and maybe even indicating that the server has been moved? 
Although there is probably a lot that could be done, hopefully this should serve as a seed for future work? 
Andre There's another potential technology for this kind of thing besides Rendezvous: the Service Location Protocol. 
It's not exactly the same, but it's useful in its own way.
