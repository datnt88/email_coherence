<s> I said on our design of using exc-C14n in the parser and mentioned in rdf concepts rather than in semantics We didn't want to require people to have an XML parser for handling RDF's abstract syntax so all the XML checking belongs in the mapping from RDF/XML to the triples.  </s>
<s> ]] - http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Aug/0038.html Martin replied later on issues for users: Here is some thoughts I have gone through: - It makes things somewhat different for software writing RDF/XML: It can't just write out all types with rdf:datatype.  </s>
<s> But this is probably a desirable effect.  </s>
<s> - For users, there are really a lot of users out there, and it's not very easy to say in general.  </s>
<s> But in my view, it very much helps them understanding XML Literals if they see these literals always at the same level of escaping.  </s>
<s> Most people seem to get confused very quickly with different escaping levels.  </s>
<s> Using only rdf:parseType='Literal' would mean that the basic escaping is the same in the RDF/XML syntax, in the abstract syntax, and, as far as I understand, in most implementations.  </s>
<s> I think that is a serious benefit.  </s>
<s> -- http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Aug/0045.html  </s>
<s> I think this is a plausible set of reasons - and entity encoding XML is a bit ugly, particularly to show to end-users.  </s>
<s> If it remained internal that would be better from usability, I feel.  </s>
<s> So the proposal is to forbid (in the SYNTAX, not semantics or abs syn): rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#XMLLiteral" and require XML literals to be written in the rdf:parseType="Literal" form.  </s>
<s> Proposed change to 7.2.16 Production literalPropertyElt adding a sentence d.string-value cannot be rdf:XMLLiteral.  </s>
<s> XML Literals are written using the form given in 7.2.17 Production parseTypeLiteralPropertyElt.  </s>
<s> -- changing http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/TR/WD-rdf-syntax-grammar-20030117/#literalPropertyElt Plus adding a bad parser test case datatypes/bad001.rdf that shows this: rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#" xmlns:eg="http://example.org/"  </s>
<s> This has the benefits: * The literal form of rdf:XMLLiteral in the graph will always be in exc-C14N form * No(? less?) XML c14N checker/words need be in the semantics * Ensures only one way to encode rdf:XMLLiteral.  </s>
<s> * Easier to read the non-entity encoded XML.  </s>
<s> * XML transported 'through' RDF will be more like the original form (caveat exc-C14N) * Document impact is small - syntax WD only (primer doesn't use this form) Downsides: * It is a change * Somebody is likely using this rdf:datatype form.  </s>
<s> * It'll make a new test case that no existing parser will pass.  </s>
<s> Personally I'm favouring the change.  </s>

<s> Hmmm, I'm not convinced about this. 1) it seems to fall into the category of making stupidity illegal in the sense that there are two ways to write xml literals - one is clearer than the other, so lets try to make the other illegal.  </s>
<s> If stupidy were illegal, I'd spend alot of time in gaol, so I'm not sympathetic to that.  </s>
<s> 2) I don't expect many users to read machine generated rdf/xml.  </s>
<s> 3) it doesn't achieve its goal.  </s>
<s> there is nothing to stop folks defining synonyms for rdf:XMLLiteral, so I don't see how one can prevent it.  </s>
<s> So to me it just looks like creating an unecessary corner case, but as always, the WG decides.  </s>

<s> 3) it doesn't achieve its goal.  </s>
<s> there is nothing to stop folks defining synonyms for rdf:XMLLiteral, so I don't see how one can prevent it.  </s>
<s> I think this particular point is sufficient to justify not making any such syntactic restriction.  </s>
<s> Better to view parseType="Literal" as syntactic sugar for the general form of typed literal expression, as a convenience to users -- not as either a primary or (as suggested) exclusive form of expression.  </s>
<s> I.e. typed literals are expressed using rdf:datatype and a valid lexical form.  </s>
<s> Because RDF/XML *is* XML, and because the canonical lexical form of rdfs:XMLLiterals is complicated, we provide a more convenient way to express them, just as various contractions are provided by the RDF/XML syntax.  </s>

<s> The point is, we do NO checking on the value of the rdf:datatype content.  </s>
<s> So you can encode something that might be a non exc-C14N Unicode string (caveats, after octets- de-utf8ing).  </s>
<s> That means you can introduce ill-formed XML into the graph and if you get into entailments, these have no literal denotation.  </s>
<s> So if this remains this way, applications of RDF that just deal with the graph need to have XML parsers and exc-C14N checkers, even if they never used rdf/xml.  </s>
<s> Not that it's hard, XML tools are everywhere.  </s>
