<s> Hi,  </s>
<s> The Table of Contents view is already editable today.  </s>
<s> So I don't understand what you plan to do exactly.  </s>

<s> Hi, Irene -  </s>
<s> My main goal is interactive collapsing and expanding of each "branch" of the hierarchical "tree" of headings.  </s>
<s> The Table of Contents view currently shows an outline of the heading hierarchy, with all sub-headings always visible.  </s>
<s> Selective hiding of sub-headings would allow the user to focus at different levels of detail; this is especially useful for navigating large documents.  </s>
<s> To accomplish this, I propose displaying the heading hierarchy in a tree widget, like those used in GUI file managers.  </s>
<s> Specifically, a small icon is displayed to the left of each heading: a "+" indicates the presence of one or more hidden sub-headings; or a "-" indicates that any children are already visible, or that no children exist.  </s>
<s> The user can toggle between the collapsed and expanded states for a heading by clicking on each icon, or via a keystroke.  </s>
<s> Editing is a secondary issue: when sub-nodes are hidden, I'd like the ability to prune and graft the entire branch to another location, via cut-and-paste.  </s>
<s> Ideally, the tree widget itself should have hooks to support this capability.  </s>
<s> Assuming that such a tree widget is currently unavailable for Thot, I propose to port an existing widget from an open-source library such as GTK.  </s>
<s> Then I would populate the widget with the headings which are currently displayed in Table of Contents view.  </s>
<s> Perhaps I should refer to the result as an Interactive Outline View.  </s>
<s> Does this sound feasible?  </s>
<s> Thanks, Marc  </s>
<s> It would sound more in keeping with Amaya to have the table of contents render as the structure view does, with H(n) elements being treated as  </s>
<s> children of previous H(n-1) elements.  </s>
<s> If you could select n so that only H1..H(n) were shown, that would be a bonus.  </s>
<s> If you could edit this view in  </s>
<s> the same way as the structure view (and it moved the content that was not shown as well) that would be even better  </s>

<s> Charles - My main question is whether a collapsible outline view is feasible for Amaya.  </s>
<s> In response to your comments:  </s>
<s> A tree widget would be the most intuitive tool for the user to view and modify the hierarchy of headings.  </s>
<s> Although working to be free from Microsoft products, the best example I can give is MS Word's Outline View.  </s>
<s> I sometimes use Word's support for this, via buttons labelled 1 through 9; but I find that it's -much- more important to have separate control of each branch.  </s>
<s> I like the parent/child relationships as currently displayed in Table of Contents view.  </s>
<s> If you believe that a different scheme would be better, would you please give an example?  </s>
<s> Thanks, Marc  </s>

<s> The P language provides the material to hide or display a box in a view.  </s>
<s> This is the P Visibility.  </s>
<s> The default Visibility level is 5. When the visibility of a box is less than 5 it's not displayed, when it's more or equal to 5 it's displayed.  </s>
<s> You can add a new hidden attribute "XX=displayed, undisplayed" which sets respectively the box Visibility to 5 or 4. Then you can write a callback function attached to the activation of the displayed icon that changes the value of that attribute in the sub-tree.  </s>
<s> With Thot events, callbacks and the API you can implement any specific functionality.  </s>
<s> See the example of the Make Book which moves a part of a document into another and the developer documentation.  </s>

<s> Thanks for the detailed feedback.  </s>
<s> Two small questions to help me become familar with the source code: 1. Are the Developer web pages available for download as a tarball?  </s>
<s> These pages don't seem to be included with the user-oriented htmls which come with the binary or source releases.  </s>
<s> It was a little awkward to get the previous (v 2.1) pages individually via Save As.  </s>
<s> 2. Do you have a tentative date for the next release?  </s>

<s> Each developer document is one unique Web page.  </s>
<s> It's easy to get a local copy or print each document.  </s>
<s> We have very important developments in progress (Unicode, CSS, Math).  </s>
<s> It's why we plan the next release for mid or end March.  </s>
