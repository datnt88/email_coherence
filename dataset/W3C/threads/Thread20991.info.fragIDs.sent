<s> I used (successfully) version 8.2 on my PC. Today when I started Amaya it showed me only black text on black background.  </s>
<s> I downloaded version 8.3 then and installed it over the previous version.  </s>
<s> But that didn't help.  </s>
<s> The problem remains.  </s>
<s> What could be the reason for that strange behaviour?  </s>
<s> Any suggentions?  </s>

<s> There is probably a reason but I don't know. it could be a trouble during the install.  </s>
<s> Do you have CSS property that sets the black background color?  </s>
<s> Often strange behaviours disappear when all previous versions are explicitly removed before installing the new one.  </s>

<s> No. Amaya doesn't show any web page.  </s>
<s> All pages are completely black, regardless of any style sheet.  </s>

<s> What is your plateforme : Linux / Windows ?  </s>
<s> Do you use the OpenGL version ?  </s>

<s> OS: Windows 2000 Service Pack 4 Amaya: The "normal" version (not the OpenGL version) Graphics card: ATI Radeon 7000 Monitor: NEC AccuSync LCD 71VM Resolution: 1280x1024 Color depth: 16 bit BTW: I recently changed my monitor.  </s>
<s> Before this I was using a CRT at a resolution of 1024x768.  </s>
<s> It seems like Amaya worked on my old monitor but does not on the new one.  </s>
<s> Could that be? (Sounds strange to me.)  </s>

<s> It could be a problem with images, because Amaya has to manage directly the image rendering, but not for the text (the text is managed thru standard Win32 primitives).  </s>
<s> We had and solved a problem with screens which are declared 16 bit depth but actually are 15 bit depth.  </s>
<s> Could you try to configure differently your display (in 24 or 32 bits)?  </s>

<s> At 32 bits color depth it's still the same: Amaya shows all web pages just completely black.  </s>
<s> I cannot try 24 bits because this option is not offered.  </s>
