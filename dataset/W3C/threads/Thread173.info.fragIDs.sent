Hi all. 
I have decided that I must close out my role as maintainer of Java HTML Tidy. 
I will certainly make sure that Dave has the latest Java tidy package, and I will provide assistance to anyone who wants to take over that role. 
I continue to be interested in the HTML Tidy project, and as such, I may provide bug fixes (or bug reports :-) from time to time. 
I want to thank Dave and all the contributors for the great work on an extremely useful software tool. 
I learned a lot from you. 
I would like to put forth an idea for consideration: Dave, have you ever thought of making Java tidy the reference version? 
I have nothing against C, and certainly not your programming, but Java has a lot of nice features that make it attractive: cross-platform support, object-orientedness, internationalization features, support for many character encodings,... and I could go on. 
If you are concerned about performance, there exists Java-to-native-code compilers. 
I believe Java tidy is an accurate port of C tidy, and it is very stable at this point. 
Respectfully, Andy Quick 
Andy, I'd like to thank you for all the time and effort you have put into Java Tidy. 
Tidy has proven indispensable to the projects I work on. 
Most of what we do is in Java, so your accurate and timely Java ports have saved us untold heartburn. 
Best wishes, Randy 
Hello Andy , I could not find Java Tidy on either of your links or on the main Tidy homepage. 
Is there a way to get it ?
