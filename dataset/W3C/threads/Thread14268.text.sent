We've been sending out the Quick Tips at a rapid pace (about 21,000 so far), and need to re-order. 
We're taking the opportunity to clean up one or two grammatical and formating items. 
In addition, we've noted a few things which may need to be changed to ensure that the Quick Tips are better synchronized with the final WCAG Recommendation. 
Your comments are welcome, by next Thursday July 15 please -- and please reply to the w3c-wai-eo@w3.org 
list. 
If you want to see the archives of the discussion, they are linked from the EO home page at http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO. 
First, here is the current text of the Quick Tips card. 
It is also available on-line at http://www.w3.org/WAI/References/QuickTips FOR COMPLETE GUIDELINES &amp; CHECKLIST: WWW.W3.ORG/WAI - Images &amp; animations. 
Use the alt attribute to describe the function of all visuals. 
- Image maps. 
Use client-side MAP and text for hotspots. 
- Multimedia. 
Provide captioning and transcripts of audio, descriptions of video, and accessible versions in case inaccessible formats are used. 
- Hypertext links. 
Use text that makes sense when read out of context. 
For instance, do not use "click here." - Page organization. 
Use headings, lists, and consistent structure. 
Use CSS for layout and style where possible. 
- Graphs &amp; charts. 
Summarize or use the longdesc attribute. 
- Scripts, applets, &amp; plug-ins. 
Provide alternative content in case active features are inaccessible or unsupported. 
- Frames. 
Label with the title or name attribute. 
- Tables. 
Make line by line reading sensible. 
Summarize. 
Avoid using tables for column layout. 
- Check your work. 
Validate the HTML. 
Use evaluation tools and text-only browsers to verify accessibility. 
Second, here are the proposed changes from the EOWG, and some also from subsequent discussion w/ Gregg Vanderheiden, Co-Chair of the Web Content Guidelines Working Group. 
1. Change "all visuals" to "each visual." 2. Make "alt" in first item boldface. 
3. Make "MAP" in second item lower case, but keep it boldface. 
4. Make "css" uppercase on first item on back of card. 5. Update version number on back of card to "1999/07." 6. 
At "Image maps. 
Use client-side MAP and text for hotspots." 
Check that this is consistent with final WCAG. 
7. At "Multimedia," drop "and accessible versions in case inaccessible formats are used" if people feel that the earlier part of the sentence, "Provide captioning and transcripts of audio, and descriptions of video" is adequate to convey the meaning here. 
The assumption would be that if people are using a format that does not permit synchronized captioning or description, this would still serve as a prompt that that information needs to somehow be available. 
At one point we'd been keeping this phrase in as an encouragement to use accessible formats in general, e.g. as a caution about accessibility concerns for some formats such as PDF, but no one seems to understand it this way. 
(We need feedback on this!) 8. At "Tables," drop "Avoid using tables for column layout" since it is no longer consistent with what we say in the guidelines at checkpoints 5.5 and 10.3. 
The main point is to ensure that they serialize sensibly, which is already covered in "Make line by line reading sensible." 
9. Add hyphens to phrase as follows: "Make line-by-line reading sensible." 
10. 
Change "Check your work" to "Check your work against complete guidelines" as an additional prompt to send them to the real thing. 
What about adding the stable URI here: http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT? 
The last item on the card would then read: "Check your work against complete guidelines. 
http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT. 
Validate the HTML. 
Use evaluation tools and text-only browsers to verify accessibility." (By the way, we can only add this if we drop part of the "tables" and "multimedia" items.) 11. 
Other??? Are there any other critical priority one items from WCAG 1.0 that are not in some way already covered by these existing points, and that we could cleanly &amp; concisely fit onto this little card? 
For those of you who didn't participate in the exercise earlier, the point is to get the wording on the card as concise as possible, not as a substitute for the guidelines, but rather as a prompt to remember key concepts with. 
Thanks in advance for your comments!

On mature reconsideration g I now vote to remove it. 
All the other proposed changes in Judy's message get my "aye".

Love ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE In a revision I have a couple of ideas - I guess I will sort through them tonight and mail them, for discussion if necessary at the eo meeting.
