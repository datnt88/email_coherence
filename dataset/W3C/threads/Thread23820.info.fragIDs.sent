<s> Erik, There is a market for pixel based fonts within memory constrained devices, however.....  </s>
<s> For collaborative documents the world went with scalable type already for products like Envoy and Acrobat.  </s>
<s> The web already makes use of scalable fonts by referencing the FONT-FACE= tag like in Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator.  </s>
<s> I is almost impossible to move towards bitmaps again.  </s>

<s> Actually, the pixelfont document has been extended a bit.  </s>
<s> Not since I made my comments.  </s>
<s> I see from your document: Last Modified: Thursday, 08-Aug-96 01:13:12 GMT The main substance of the argument seems to be not that pixelfonts are good, but that outline fonts on the Web are bad.  </s>
<s> You seem to take the position that outline fonts should only be used by phototypesetting bureaux, everyone else should use bitmaps to ensure that they don't copy outline fonts.  </s>
<s> So you don't much care to define what pixelfonts might mean or how they might be used, just that people shouldn't use outline fonts on the Web.  </s>
<s> Would that be a fair summary?  </s>

<s> Why do I get the impression that the two Bills are the principle negotiators of the OpenType agreement?  </s>
<s> Excellent mail, Bill!  </s>
<s> This is the most rational summary I've yet seen of the issues.  </s>
<s> The problems of IPR for fonts are, as you point out, not much different to the problems of IPR for other "creative works" on the Net, such as photographs and graphics, and in fact, the font embedding scheme which we are proposing gives greater protection to fonts than exists today for other creative works.  </s>
<s> I've heard a few good things regarding better protection in OpenType embedding than, for instance, in Acrobat.  </s>
<s> I also know that this was won after a good deal of lobbying by people in Adobe and Microsoft's respective typography groups.  </s>
<s> Perhaps the Bills would like to explain this ptotection in detail, rather than simply assuring us that it is greater than that which exists for other creative works.  </s>
<s> In the meantime, I refer you to my previous post explaining the difference between a font and a JPEG, and the following excerpts from Jonathan Hoefler: While I think that Bill accurately points out that fonts are subject to the same duplicability as all digital data (and increasingly, everything is representable this way), there's a broader issue which John points out regarding the difference between fonts and everything else.  </s>
<s> Aside from the fact that JPEG has a considerable war chest and has used it most effectively to develop digital watermarking technologies for indicating the origin of a photograph (techniques which survive subsequent alteration), the most compelling difference is that illustrations are not the common currency of readership the way fonts are.  </s>
<s> And there's the rub!  </s>
<s> A JPEG is an image, instantly identifiable and, to be subject to IP protection, unique.  </s>
<s> A font is a utilitarian package containing a type designer's image of the alphabet.  </s>
<s> In the first place, images of the alphabet are _not_ protected under US law (although they are elsewhere).  </s>
<s> In the second place, it is the utilitarian aspect of a font that makes it desirable to the many people who buy fonts and to the many who pirate them.  </s>
<s> A font does not have the uniqueness of an image, since a font's inherent value is in the user's ability to use it to convey a text.  </s>
<s> Let's say that a protected photographic image is employed on a website devoted to, for instance, cars.  </s>
<s> Someone cruises the site, likes the image, and steals it for inclusion in their own website, devoted to rally racing.  </s>
<s> A few days later, the photographer, who is a keen racing amateur, comes across the second page and recognises his image.  </s>
<s> This is an open and shut case of copyright infringement.  </s>
<s> Now let's say that the original car site employs an embedded copy of Adobe Garamond for its text face.  </s>
<s> The person who runs the racing site not only likes the photo, but also the font, and has the savvy to strip it from the site and use it on his own.  </s>
<s> A few days later, Robert Slimbach (who, for all I know, hates car racing) stumbles across both pages, shrugs and says to himself 'Oh look, there's my typeface again, I wonder if either of them paid for it?' John Hudson, Type Director Tiro TypeWorks Vancouver, BC tiro@portal.ca  </s>
