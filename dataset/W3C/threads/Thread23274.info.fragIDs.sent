For the record, I had an off-line email exhcange concerning the entity issue resolved by the DOM WG, report in make sure, are there any issues with this? 
Thanks, /Dimitris 
All, this was sent to this list instead of www-dom-ts@w3.org.

As far as I remember, the createEntityReference issue was addressed in Is there anything missing in the message that needs to be clarified? 
Philippe 
No, the resolution is clear enough.
