I start up Amaya on my machine; viewing http://localhost/ (which you can probably get to at http://gentle.dyn.ml.org/) causes a core dump. 
The backtrace in gdb looks like this: (gdb) bt #0 0x806065d in TextToDocument () #1 0x8060731 in StartOfTag () #2 0x8065397 in HTMLparse () #3 0x8066e83 in StartHTMLParser () #4 0x805343d in LoadHTMLDocument () #5 0x8053e5f in GetHTMLDocument () #6 0x80542aa in CallbackDialogue () #7 0x80552dd in InitAmaya () #8 0x808c7bc in CallAction () #9 0x808c949 in CallEventType () #10 0x80bc653 in TtaMainLoop () #11 0x8052348 in main () #12 0x804fe6b in _start () I'm running amaya-LINUX-ELF-1.1a.tar.gz with Linux 2.0.30, libc.so.5.3.12, and XFree86 3.2. 
The problem happens whether I specify the page's URL on the command line or in the dialog box, whether it's via HTTP or directly. 
The document is included here. 
p Not much on this server yet; there's the a href="/tcsh.html/" 
tcsh manual /a and a href="/~kragen/" Kragen's misc. 
web pages /a . 
Let me know if you know why. 
Kragen Yes, we know why. 
The bug is fixed now. 
We are preparing an update of the LINUX release that will be available later today. 
An update of the Windows release will also be made today. 
Sorry for the inconvenience. 
Vincent.

I think the problem is fixed now. 
It seemed to be a problem during the compiling process. 
Please, try the new release on the W3C server: Sorry for the inconvenience.
