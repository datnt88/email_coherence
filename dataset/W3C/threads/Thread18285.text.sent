Unless there is further comment to the list regarding the proposed wording for checkpoint 7.2, the following wording will be added to the next draft of the guidelines: 7.2 For each state in a viewport's browsing history, restore the point of regard associated with that state when the user returns to it in the viewport.

I prefer the following version, already in the 28 July guidelines: 7.2 Associate a point of regard with each state in a viewport's browsing history and when the user returns to a state in the history, restore the associated point of regard.
