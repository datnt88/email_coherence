<s> Today I got a call from a friend with some bad  </s>

<s> He just bought a Macintosh and went to one of my sites with Internet Explorer and instead of a page he got the source code.  </s>
<s> It seems that IE on the Mac (for him, anyway) will reproduce HTML just fine, but when confronted with XHTML will dump the code into the browser window as if it were plain text.  </s>
<s> He thinks that the problem is because he just signed  </s>
<s> up for @Home and the tech screwed something up, but I am suspicious.  </s>
