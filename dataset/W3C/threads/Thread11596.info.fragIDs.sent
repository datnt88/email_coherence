<s> Hi Dave, I've translated the XHTML 1.0 Proposed Recomendation (1999/12/10) into Spanish.  </s>
<s> There are two possible URLs where you can give a look a tell if the W3C  </s>
<s> gives its approval to the translation.  </s>
<s> I know it still is a Prop.  </s>
<s> Rec.,  </s>
<s> but I think it is important to the Spanish speaking comunity to have an idea of what's going on.  </s>
<s> Thanks in advance, Juan Luis Lara.  </s>
<s> Sorry, I forgot to write down the URLs.  </s>
<s> and They just differ in the position of the images of the two logos.  </s>
<s> If you send me stable URL, I will add a link.  </s>

<s> I notice that the W3C Proposed Recommendation background image is missing from both locations.  </s>
<s> Would it be possible for you to fix this?  </s>
<s> I am also unsure what the W3C's policy is on the use of the W3C logo for translations.  </s>
<s> I am checking this with our Communications team.  </s>
<s> The 2nd URL pointed to a broken document when I viewed it.  </s>

<s> Hello Dave, Juan: Using the W3C logo, directly from the W3C site, is okay if done correctly.  </s>
<s> Please see the example at referenced from the Copyright FAQ However, there are a few other things that can and should be improved:  </s>
<s> - Please try to make sure that the 'W3C Proposed Recommendation' icon starts at the same height as the actual translation, not before.  </s>
<s> - Please put the disclaimers on the translation (i.e. "(Los posibles errores presentes en este documento"...) in the header before the translation.  </s>
<s> - Please add a sentence saying that the normative version of the specification is the English version found at the W3C site.  </s>
<s> - Please move all logos of translators to the header.  </s>
<s> - Please make sure that all browsers know the character encoding of the document.  </s>
<s> Please see do that.  </s>
