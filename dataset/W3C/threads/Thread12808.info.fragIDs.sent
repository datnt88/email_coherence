I looked through the new materials and generally like them. 
Good work, Judy! 
The "spare" front end is good. 
When planning any kind of training session or workshop or curriculum, I always 
express objectives and activities using the imperative verb form. 
This was done on the main page, www.w3.org/WAI/training which is very clear: 1. Determine Needs and Expectations 2. Choose Resources and Approaches 3. Arrange Resources in Advance etc. 
I suggest applying the same principle to the navigation bar, so that planning | objectives | resources | arranging | perspectives reads something like: Plan the session | Set objectives | Identify resources | Arrange resources | Get ideas from web accessibility trainers. 
There are a couple of minor problems with www.w3.org/WAI/References/Browsing 1. Link to info about the accessibility features in I.E. 4.01 is out of date. 
2. Link to screen magnification info at www.magnifiers.demon.nl is dead. 
Finally, I noticed no description of keyboard-only access to the Web: using internet software without a mouse. 
Keyboard-only access is used by people who are blind, laptop users, and sometimes by people with upper-body mobility impairments or learning disabilities. 
This is less of an assistive technology than an alternative access strategy, and it is something that I could write for this purpose (if I haven't done so already!)

Alan, 
Trimmed and trimmed.

I think there are advantages to one-word navitems wherever possible. 
Anyone else care to comment on this point? 
Okay, but there's problems on lots of the other resources too -- if you have updated links I will get them in there but let's focus on the set of training pages right now, not on everything at once... 
Where? in the "How People with Disabilities Use the Web?" (that's where we should be addressing it, and that page has edits pending) or somewhere in the training pages?

Alan Cantor noted: quote 2. Link to screen magnification info at www.magnifiers.demon.nl is dead. 
unquote the correct URIs for the screen magnifiers page are: framed version: http://www.magnifiers.org/ 
no-frames version: http://www.magnifiers.org/main2.html 
on-the-fly translations of the site are also available in french, german, italian, spanish, and portuguese from either entrance-way... oh, and for the record, while i prefer one word navigation bar links, i would welcome adding alan's proposed "active phrases" to the links in the forms of link titles... gregory.
