I made some minor changes, in particular dropping the very limited discussion I had of two designs as not worth the space. 
Also added link to the legacy message of earlier Jeremy Concerning: [1] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Sep/0259.html [2] I'd like to record my unease over the general approach of this argument [2], to the extent that (a) it doesn't entirely reflect what I felt was the WG's reason for sticking with the current design, and (b) the coverage of design alternatives discussed is possibly spurious or incomplete. 
My apologies for not chiming in with this sooner, but the first time I read a draft of this text I found myself feeling uneasy and confused without any real focus for such feelings. 
My perception is that we chose to stick with the current design because: (a) the desire for "seamless" evolution from plain to XML literals was articulated very late in the day, and had not previously been part of our design goals, (b) a more complete treatment of this desideratum would require extensive changes to many of the documents at a very late stage in the overall process at a time when the group really needs to complete its work quickly if it is to deliver value to the community, (c) we do not feel we have been presented with a sufficiently compelling argument that the current design is broken in any fundamental or fatal way, and (d) we have been trying to minimize dependence on XML of the core design of RDF (other than the XML serialization syntax). 
The draft justification [2] dwells very much on details of specific design choices we might have made, which I do not feel fully captures the true situation. 
In short, I perceive our position is: - we really, really need to finish soon; - the current design is not fatally flawed; - to find an alternative acceptable design will cause a major delay. 
As it stands, the draft seems to consist almost entirely of details that justify the final point above. 
I'm not claiming that anything in Jeremy's draft [2] is wrong. 
If my perception is not matched by others in the WG, and folks feel this really does fully capture the group's position, then I am content to let it stand (having hereby had my day in court, so to speak).

I agree that these are possible weaknesses, I think the schedule issue is an important one. 
Please suggest improvements - possibly to do with use of this document, and a separate rebuttal that consists of a) the blow-by-blow account I added in today's draft b) discussion of wider issues such as schedule and no compelling reason for delay Jeremy Hmm... I should have expected this (which is a quite proper and reasonable response). 
Rather than attempt a new drafting, what I'm going to do here is suggest an outline drawing upon existing material that I hope might present the information in a way that more closely reflects (my perception of) this group's reasons for not acceding. 
Why we didn't accept I18N's objection to the design of XML literals 1. Review status of the WG, noting that we're long overdue, losing participation, and that the I18N desideratum for "seamless plain and XML literals" was only articulated well after the end of LC1. 
This might use material from my earlier message [1]. 
2. point by point response to I18 concerns, per Jeremy's message [2], in particular the new final section of [3]. 
2a. note that the WG has wrestled long and hard with datatype issues (which are closely related, and in particular that the handling of both XML and language tags is intimately bound up with the MT for literals). 
Due to conflicting desiderata, there are no easy fixes that don't require a lot of reworking. 
[Cite multiple early designs for datatyping] 2b. 
Reference to an appendix with Jeremy's discussion of some alternative designs, noting that this isn't exhaustive but illustrative of the technical difficulties we face and also that we did consider alternatives. 
This is by way of response to the I18N claim that they offered alternative solutions. 
3. Note that many of the difficulties we have faced in clarifying the earlier M&amp;S design were caused in part by ill-considered late additions to that specification, and the consequent implementation practices that have grown up as a result [cite examples?] 4. Summary: in the absence of a compelling claim that anything is actually broken (i.e. despite prompting for actual cases where the current solution is inadequate, none has been offered) we feel that it is more important to deliver what we have than to risk failure to deliver anything at all. 
A point to draw out here is not to claim that alternative technical designs are not possible, or maybe even better than what we have, but to note that the effort of producing one may be too much for this WG and it's allotted time. 
Appendix: Jeremy's discussion of some possible solutions, from [2] References to supporting material My hope would be that the main response would be no more than a page, or a couple of screens of text, and the detailed technical arguments are available through references to supporting material. 
Does this help?

I note that this requirement "seamless plain and XML literals" is not part of the objection - so we don't particularly need to justify not addressing this. 
More later Jeremy OK, that was poor phrasing on my part. 
Some actual wording from the I18N formal objection [1] is: + provide solutions as close as possible for plain literals and XML Literals + Do not require programmers/users to trade off use of language information against other goals, such as markup integrity. 
+ It is very important to have a consistent way to identify the language of a piece of text in any technology so that generic operations needing this information can use it easily. 
+ to write queries that search for both plain literals and XML literals + possible to keep markup as is without loosing language information My phrasing may have been poor; I was trying to refer to goals such as these, which I was not aware were articulated to the group until after LC. #g [1] http://www.w3.org/2003/09/ri434 Graham Klyne GK@NineByNine.org
