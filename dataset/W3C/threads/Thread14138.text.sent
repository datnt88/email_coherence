ISSUE - 10: This deals with 4.2 which reads "4.2 Specify the expansion of abbreviations and acronyms. 
[Priority 2 for the first occurrence of the acronym or abbreviation in a given document, Priority 3 thereafter.]" 
An AC Member felt that to expand abbreviations and acronyms is good writing style. 
They did not feel that this checkpoint was an accessibility issue. 
They knew of no user agents that support the ACRONYM or ABBR tag. 
As a result they felt that to should be priority 3. This is a similar situation as PRI -9. 
Should an item be required before it is supported by user agents? 
This would help solve legacy problems in the future. 
But how much should it be required today? 
PROPOSED RESOLUTION: None yet. 
Comments? 
Ideas? 
This is a question of comprehension: to what extent do people with cognitive disabilities, dyslexia, etc., benefit from the expansion of abbreviations and acronyms? 
Obviously, all readers can take advantage of this feature, as it improves the readability of documents. 
Unless there is evidence suggesting that such expansions do not significantly benefit particular groups of users, I would recommend against making any change to the priority of this checkpoint. 
What is the status of ABBR support in pwWebSpeak? 
in HomePageReader? 
One could even argue that Lynx supports it because it is quite easy to flop to "view source," re-find the acronym with text searching, and read the HTML code in the vicinity. 
There is also the matter of repairing gateways, which can be up and running as fast as the docment can be a Recommendation, more or less. 
The best that the W3C can do is to recommend that authors implement the LANG attribute and the ABBR and ACRONYM elements, and that user agents provide the necessary support. 
Apart from interim measures (the "Until user agents" qualification) the priorities in the guidelines are, as required by their respective definitions, chosen to reflect the impact of a particular problem upon the accessibility of web content. 
Thus, if certain markup or style language features are not implemented in the short to medium term, then, when the requisite user agent features are introduced, the access difficulties will not have been overcome. 
Likewise, if these language features are not implemented by user agents but are deployed in actual documents, their use will be ineffectual. 
What is needed, therefore, is action on both the content and the user agent sides; and the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines are intended to address the former of these requirements.
