<s> I just tried it on pacareerlink.state.pa.us  </s>
<s> This page has a number of problems: for example, 1.  </s>
<s> It comes up blank in lynx, apparently due to browser sniffing.  </s>
<s> 2. the navigation bar, which is an image map, has no alt text for the areas 3. There's a "what's new" gif with text in it, and missing alt text.  </s>
<s> I should mention that the people responsible for this site are aware of the problems and have committed to fix them.  </s>
<s> When I anayzed this with LIFT, it got a rating of "excellent" .  </s>
<s> it listed only 2 minor problems, missing keyword and description metatags.  </s>
<s> This page uses frames.  </s>
<s> The problem might be that it only looked at the frameset.  </s>
<s> I'm using lynx 2.83 by the way, which does handle frames, so problem (1) isn't due to using an old lynx.  </s>
