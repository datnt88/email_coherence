Anyone had a chance to play with WebAble's LIFT service?

Correction -- it's not "WebABLE's LIFT" service -- it is UsableNet's Lift Service. 
We are just facilitating it's use. 
Oop! Fair enough, I didn't read the small print. 
Anyone have any opinion on UsableNet's LIFT service?

I just tried it on pacareerlink.state.pa.us 
This page has a number of problems: for example, 1. 
It comes up blank in lynx, apparently due to browser sniffing. 
2. the navigation bar, which is an image map, has no alt text for the areas 3. There's a "what's new" gif with text in it, and missing alt text. 
I should mention that the people responsible for this site are aware of the problems and have committed to fix them. 
When I anayzed this with LIFT, it got a rating of "excellent" . 
it listed only 2 minor problems, missing keyword and description metatags. 
This page uses frames. 
The problem might be that it only looked at the frameset. 
I'm using lynx 2.83 by the way, which does handle frames, so problem (1) isn't due to using an old lynx.
