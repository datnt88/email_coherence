<s> This is a difficult issue to address and not make WCAG look like it is anti whatever (in this case javascript).  </s>
<s> A lot of web developers just don't understand that their web sites are breaking with all the ad blockers and people who turn Javascript off because so many sites misused it.  </s>
<s> If they don't get that there can be lots of usability issues with javascript in their main target group sector, they'll never get it that it can cause problems for other less main stream user agents.  </s>
<s> There is a need to raise this issue and put it in WCAG2, but it needs to be done with a lot of support documents and examples to educate people as to why this is a problem, only then will they start to understand the issues and try and address them in design.  </s>
<s> Jonathan has some good stuff at much more than that.  </s>
<s> My frustration with WCAG is that there has never been a good bridging set of documents to show the general web development community how to implement these guidelines in general web SDLC and their ROI.  </s>
<s> These issues are still relevant, they shouldn't be removed from WCAG2, but we do owe the development community out there a series of technical documents that clearly show why these issue need to be addressed and support why WCAG recommends them.  </s>
<s> I also have to admit that while I liked the original direction WCAG2 was going in I do find the more recent drafts becoming more and more vague.  </s>
<s> I can't be critical because I haven't contributed, and I know the people working on it are doing their best.  </s>
<s> Just my 1 cent worth (I have one cent less than Chaals:-) Just as a side interest, I filled out a form in Mozilla today, and the preliminary form triggered a popup from the submit button to another form.  </s>
<s> The problem was that this caused an interface with no access to Mozilla's Form Manager.  </s>
<s> It's very frustrating seeing these types of what I call design mistakes.  </s>
<s> Most web developers don't see or understand that behind WCAG is some good old common sense practicality to web design.  </s>

<s> Lisa, I can give you a better answer about whether screen readers can "get to" the content of the page if you can give me a specific task to try.  </s>
<s> I use JAWS 5.0 with IE 6.  </s>
<s> I went to the page just now and was able to get a frames list JAWS keystroke="Ins+F9) that included four frame.  </s>
<s> The frames are called Site, top bar, workarea frame, and bar frame.  </s>
<s> These aren't especially useful titles, but they *are* titles and even if they're automatically generated could presumably be programmed to be more informative.  </s>
<s> JAWS is unable to report some of the links on the page, possibly because they're coded using numerical values (I haven't looked at the source) to represent characters in a non-Western alphabet.  </s>
<s> Some of the graphics appear to have alt text-e.g., "Empty folder."  </s>
<s> Again not very informative, but htat's not so much a Javascript problem as a a Javascriptor problem-i.e., it's the human who wrote the Javascript, not the language.  </s>
