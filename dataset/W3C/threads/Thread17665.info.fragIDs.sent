In Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.0, Opera 3.60, and Netscape Navigator 4.6 the display font size for text does not affect the display point size of the tool tips. 
I don't see tool tips in Amaya at all, (nor the link tabbing). 
For low-vision, this fixed, small point size is not useful.

Harvey, 
I suspect that the tooltip is an OS service in IE at least. 
If you put the OS in high visibility mode, is the ToolTip the same old microscript or does it go to large type and light-on-dark at that point?

You can adjust the size of tooltips globally. 
It's ridiculously small to begin with; I have cranked up mine to 12 or 14 point bold, and haven't regretted it (yet). 
- Control Panel - "Display" icon - "Appearance" page tab - "Item" combo box. 
Tooltips is on the list in the combo box, and you can change the typeface, font size, font attribute, and background colour. 
I recommend that you name and save this environment as a scheme. 
By adjusting the characteristics of items on this page, you can create high visibility schemes that better meet the needs of individuals with low vision and mobility impairments. 
The schemes that come with Windows 95 and 98 are fairly limited. 
Regard them as points of departure. 
I usually start with the Standard scheme, and modify like nuts. 
If you have over 40 eyes, try enlarging the font size for "Message Box" to 12 or 14 point bold, and you may be pleasantly surprised.
