<s> Thanks, Charles - less embarrassing ;- I'm using Amaya to create a web page which is narrower than an entire screen; my goal is simply to verify that anyone viewing the page will be able to scroll.  </s>
<s> Scrolling works in other browsers, of course -- I'd just like to verify that it would scroll properly in Amaya, which appears to ignore "nowrap" in table cells -- another bug?  </s>

<s> As Charles noted, this is a known bug and it's on the to do list of the development team.  </s>
<s> The problem has already been fixed for plain text documents.  </s>
<s> Try to download a CSS style sheet, an XML document, or any plain text file: the source code is displayed in a window with a functional horizontal scroll bar.  </s>

<s> depends on your window manager.  </s>
<s> I presently use RedHat 6, which came with Gnome and the enlightenment window manager, so I find the settings option in the main Gnome menu, use the Gnome control center to play with my window manager and use that to run the configuration tool for enlightenment.  </s>

<s> from the oldest to the news (I don't try to give an ?valuation....) olvwm (for openwindow but you can use it on other system, simple and easy to use) fvwm (great flexibility, but hard to configure) dtwm (cde desktop, not a freeware, on sun, hp, ibm) fvwm95 (based on fvwm, give a win95 look and feel) kdewm (kdedesktop, heavy to my opinion) and windowmaker that you can integrate under kde and/or gnome) - I use it see http://www.windowmaker.org  </s>
