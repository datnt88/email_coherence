Amaya's horizontal scroll bar seems non-functional under Windows 95. 
Previous messages mention this issue, but the answer seems to be missing. 
Is this a known bug, and are there any workarounds?

This is a known bug. 
I hope it gets fixed soon - it can be a real problem. 
The only workaround I have is to make my window more than one screen wide - 
which is not very good either. 
(I use linux, which allows me to have a 
virtual desktop that is several screens across, but i believe windows will 
let you make a window larger tha the screen size and move it back and forth across the screen) Charles McCN

Thanks, Charles - less embarrassing ;- I'm using Amaya to create a web page which is narrower than an entire screen; my goal is simply to verify that anyone viewing the page will be able to scroll. 
Scrolling works in other browsers, of course -- I'd just like to verify that it would scroll properly in Amaya, which appears to ignore "nowrap" in table cells -- another bug? 
One of the previous postings hinted that the problem might be worked around by modifying a config file. 
I was hoping for an "official" reply from the Amaya developers. 
Are you are involved with Amaya development at W3C?

I'm not part of the Amaya team, but like the rest of the world I have tried to contribute a bit. 
I work on accessibility, so I have worked with the team as they improve the accessibility of Amaya, and I have done a bit of tinkering with keyboard controls and documentation. 
Other than that I am a user, so I give feedback... Charles McCN Thanks, Charles - less embarrassing ;- I'm using Amaya to create a web page which is narrower than an entire screen; my goal is simply to verify that anyone viewing the page will be able to scroll.

As Charles noted, this is a known bug and it's on the to do list of the development team. 
The problem has already been fixed for plain text documents. 
Try to download a CSS style sheet, an XML document, or any plain text file: the source code is displayed in a window with a functional horizontal scroll bar. 
So, some progress has been made. 
More to come.

depends on your window manager. 
I presently use RedHat 6, which came with Gnome and the enlightenment window manager, so I find the settings option in the main Gnome menu, use the Gnome control center to play with my window manager and use that to run the configuration tool for enlightenment. 
If I read the documentation again I think there is a simpler way. 
I have also done it using fvwm and aftersetp, but I forget exactly what I did.

Cool. How do you do configure that? 
Curioius minds want to know.

It's a window manager property. 
under unix, you have a lot of virtual screens manager. 
from the oldest to the news (I don't try to give an ?valuation....) olvwm (for openwindow but you can use it on other system, simple and easy to use) fvwm (great flexibility, but hard to configure) dtwm (cde desktop, not a freeware, on sun, hp, ibm) fvwm95 (based on fvwm, give a win95 look and feel) kdewm (kdedesktop, heavy to my opinion) and windowmaker that you can integrate under kde and/or gnome) - I use it see http://www.windowmaker.org 
As ut is for me something I can't work without, I found under win32: Perfect Screen (a shareware, I use it) Powerdesk
