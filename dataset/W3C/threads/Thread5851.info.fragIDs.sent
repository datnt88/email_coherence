<s> Although OWL Full allows me to do so, it is not valid OWL DL: See test 004 at notationProperty From a tool builder's perspective, handling annotation properties different from other "heavy" properties means a considerable overhead,  </s>
<s> and makes it very difficult to provide useful editor components for annotation values.  </s>
<s> Without information about the type of allowed values, I would have to ask the user "what would you like to enter next: A string, an integer, an object, an..."?  </s>
<s> I would also have problems to select appropriate graphical widgets for annotation properties, if I don't know in advance what values it could take.  </s>
<s> My naive understanding is that being an annotation property is more or less just another characteristic of a property, somehow like a boolean flag.  </s>
<s> The classifier could simply ignore all properties that have this flag.  </s>
<s> (Protege) User feedback suggests that annotation properties are an extremely important feature, especially to attach all types of information to classes without having to disable the classifier.  </s>

<s> Hi Holger,  </s>
<s> My opinion is that this is not necessarily a specification issue.  </s>
<s> At the tool level you can certainly have a GUI in which annotations are declared and used as you have described, but IMO this does not require any modifications to the current spec.  </s>
<s> For example, you can make use of another annotation property to denote the range for other Aps,  </s>
<s> Or use a "meta" ontology (an extension of the rdfs of owl) at the tool level.  </s>
<s> Cheers, Gary  </s>

<s> Yes, this would be a work-around.  </s>
<s> But then I would have to introduce a new non-standard annotation property that other tools will not understand.  </s>
<s> From my point of view, the allowed values of an annotation property are of general relevance, not only for editors but also to inform users of my ontology about the intended usage of the annotation properties I define.  </s>
<s> In addition, I think the OWL specification is already complicating enough: I don't see any reason why there should be a different mechanism for specifying annotation properties than for other properties.  </s>
<s> This is not only confusing but also means an unnecessary implementation overhead.  </s>
<s> Why don't we simply regard owl:AnnotationProperty similar to owl:FunctionalProperty, so that it can be attached as a "flag" to any other property?  </s>

<s> Holger, I must admit some confusion - if you know the types and  </s>
<s> properties of these things, why do you want to make them annotations?  </s>
<s> If you goal is to have metaclasses (I.e. classes with properties) you can certainly use OWL Full, it was designed to allow that.  </s>
<s> If your  </s>
<s> goal is to refer to remote properties, you can still make local assertions about them.  </s>
<s> Annotations were primarily added to handle some of the RDF(S) properties like label, seeAlso, and comment, which we wanted to allow, but did not want to try to classify on -- as Ian argued, if you know the info, put it in the ontology, if you don't, use an annotation but expect DL to ignore it  </s>
<s> So, in essence, you cannot have it both ways -- if you want to live in DL, you need to accept its restrictions.  </s>
<s> If you don't want these restrictions, you should use OWL Full -- afraid that logic will not let us have our cake and eat it too (believe me, the WG tried hard to find a way to do that :- )  </s>
<s> For what you are suggesting doing, why can you not just use RDF comments, etc. or to define things directly in OWL?  </s>

<s> Yes, I could use OWL Full, but I think the feature of (typed) annotation properties is of such a great importance to ontology designers that it should also work for OWL DL. While I could delete all annotations temporarily before I send the ontology to the classifier, the information will still be stored in the ontology, making the file difficult to share on the Web.  </s>
<s> My apologies if I lack the technical background of the OWL language theory that the WebOnt group has, but what is the problem with allowing it in OWL DL? Our typical use case is to allow the definition of metaclasses and property metaclasses which hold extra information.  </s>
<s> For example, a property metaclass could introduce an extra property "unit" or a class could be annotated with an "author" and "change date".  </s>
<s> This information is completely irrelevant to the classifier, and could be easily ignored if the property is flagged as an annotation property.  </s>
<s> I don't see however, why this excludes the use of range information on the annotation property.  </s>
<s> My impression is that, in this aspect, OWL has been designed to fit the needs of a classifier, and not from a user's or tool perspective, but you know more than I do.  </s>
<s> Because from a user's perspective annotation p's should appear just like other properties - he or she should be able to specify extra information (e.g. range) on the property so that it is later easier to enter values for the property.  </s>
<s> Holger  </s>
<s> comment below  </s>
<s> In my mind, this is certainly one of the most important aspects, i.e. to have particular levels of the language that guarantee particular computational complexity in reasoning - especially when providing services to people waiting at the other end of the wire.  </s>
<s> If particular properties such as 'date', and 'author' are important concepts in the ontology, then they should be properties and types.  </s>
<s> Workflow is a very important aspect of ontologies, i.e. we know they are not static, and as such, workflow concepts and properties should not be relegated to 'annotation'.  </s>
<s> That's just my opinion, but seems to be shared by some others in domains such as biological processes whose concepts and properties have quite a volatile nature over time and between authors.  </s>
<s> Yes, that is exactly right - the OWL DL profile is defined with decidability and completeness in mind - you cannot have those gaurantees without some restrictions.  </s>
<s> Owl Full is defined to be more compatible with the wild, wooly RDF world --more seriously, for applications where the logical guarantees can be traded off with other issues -- performance, expressivity, database compatible, etc...  </s>
<s> So this means you need to be in OWL Full, which is fine - nothing wrong with that, and many nice reasoners are being written for OWL Full - but you won't get certain guarantees.  </s>
<s> For what it is worth, the projects in my research group include some which use Lite and DL and others which use Full.  </s>
<s> All of our "web presence" (the purpose reasoners that only do some small sets of inferences (and don't need to do classification) and those work with relatively arbitrary mixes of RDF and OWL (i.e. OWL Full) -- there are other projects where we use Pellet, our OWL DL reasoner, and we must make sure the documents are more structured.  </s>
<s> There seems to be some myth that somehow DL is better than Full or something like that, but if you look at our documents you see it is all OWL -- you just get to choose what you need.  </s>
<s> Hope that helps -- and let me encourage you to allow Protege users to create OWL Full documents when they want to -- there's no reason for it to insist everything be in Lite or DL -- however, would be nice if those users who want to stay in those profiles could - perhaps putting the output through Pellet or WonderWeb or such and saying "You have created an OWL Full document.  </s>
<s> To make it Owl Lite you could xxx " - doing that with full generality is probably hard or impossible, but catching most of the main errors isn't that bad -- several of the implemented systems already do some of this  </s>

<s> Folks, I still have not read why there are problems with the logic which prevent annotation properties from having a range in OWL DL, and I would appreciate if someone could at least give me a hint on why that's impossible.  </s>
<s> To me it looks rather like a syntactic problem.  </s>
<s> Anyway, given that the specification is not going to be changed soon, I will have to build a compromise solution for Protege: At least the interface that I am now using to access Racer would not allow me to pass in an OWL Full ontology, so I need to find a workable solution for our users.  </s>
<s> This solution basically will mean that most ontologies will be in OWL Full at edit and save time.  </s>
<s> When the user presses the classify button, I will temporarily remove any AnnotationProperties or other OWL Full constructs on the fly before I send them to the classifier.  </s>
<s> Does anyone know of an open-source Java API that would take an OWL Full ontology as input and create an OWL DL ontology as output?  </s>
<s> Thanks Holger  </s>
<s> Holger, This mailing list is really aimed at specific discussion of the OWL langauge design and documents, and your message asking about annotation was quite appropriate.  </s>
<s> However, followup discussion on the reasons why DL is restricted and about other systems would make more sense on www-rdf-logic@w3.org.  </s>
<s> This mailing list has a very limited readership, that one has a much larger one, and I suspect you'd be more likely to get answers there.  </s>
