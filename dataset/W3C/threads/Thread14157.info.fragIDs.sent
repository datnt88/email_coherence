<s> Hello, Web Content Guidelines Issue 10 (refer to [1]) concerns the use of deprecated features of HTML vs. use of CSS for style (e.g., borders around images).  </s>
<s> Although we want the guidelines to send the message "use style sheets", they must also take into account the current support for CSS.  </s>
<s> There have been some questions on the list about how to satisfy the following checkpoints at the same time: - 3.3 Use style sheets to control layout and presentation.  </s>

<s> [Priority 2] - 11.2 Avoid deprecated features of W3C technologies.  </s>
<s> [Priority 2] I propose the following changes to improve the situation: a) Change wording of 3.3 to say "Use style sheets to control layout and presentation when supported by user agents."  </s>

<s> Comments on Ian's proposal: 1. Style sheets are already in part supported by most up to date user agents; hence the "when supported by user agents" clause is unnecessary in checkpoint 3.3.  </s>
<s> 2. I support Ian's proposed change to checkpoint 11.2, except for the lowering of its priority from 2 to 3: presentational elements and attributes detract from the extent to which content-level semantics are preserved in the document, and they can also generate serious access problems if they are used to control colours, fonts etc., and can not be turned off in legacy user agents (as I understand from previous discussions is the case in some circumstances).  </s>
<s> I agree that there should be a parallel established between the qualifications regarding user agent support, in checkpoints 11.1 and 11.2.  </s>
<s> Checkpoint 3.3 only requires that style sheets be used, not that unsupported features thereof be employed.  </s>
<s> Perhaps this could be clarified not by amending 3.3, but by adding a reference to 11.1 or a clarifying note which clarifies the scope of the checkpoint.  </s>
<s> As an alternative to Ian's proposal: 11.2: Avoid deprecated features of W3C technologies once user agents support equivalent functionality provided by newer standards (E.G. style sheets).  </s>
<s> Priority 2. The sense of checkpoint 3.3 is that if layout and presentation are to be controlled at all by the author of the document, this must be achieved through style sheets to the extent that they are supported by user agents.  </s>
<s> This could be clarified either in a note to the checkpoint, or the Techniques document.  </s>
<s> This is already implicit in the note accompanying checkpoint 5.3 where it is recognised that style sheet positioning is not yet adequately supported and that tables may, albeit in carefully restricted circumstances, continue to be employed for purposes of layout until positioning is better implemented.  </s>
<s> However, if checkpoint 11.2 is to be changed, perhaps it will be necessary to add a further requirement that presentational elements and attributes which can not be turned off by user agents, be avoided.  </s>
<s> Absolute units of length are already discouraged elsewhere in the guidelines.  </s>
<s> Nevertheless, I remain unconvinced that a new version of the guidelines is needed so soon after Recommendation, as the issues which have been raised do not appear to be critical (Ian argued in the teleconference that style sheets could effectively be used to provide borders around images except where two images are aligned; by simply avoiding this situation in the design of the document, the problem can be avoided entirely, and although in my opinion, checkpoint 11.2 warrants clarification I don't think this issue is sufficiently serious as to warrant a new version of the document).  </s>
<s> If further problems arise, then a revised version may be warranted, but the issues which have appeared so far are not sufficiently significant to necessitate such a course of action.  </s>
<s> Hmm. I think we should take a step back to look at this.  </s>
<s> Using style sheets is an HTML-specific techique for "Use methods which can be over-ridden by the user to control presentation".  </s>
<s> It is, in fact,  </s>
<s> probably a P1 requirement, although it needs the qualification of guideline 6 - Transform gracefully.  </s>
<s> And Lo, I looked there and found 6.1 ensure pages are usable without style sheets...  </s>
<s> This becomes a question of what features can be controlled by user agents - in other words, it says when there are good enough user agents, feel free to use anything you can think of.  </s>
<s> In 11.1 and 11.2 we are saying "use the latest supported W3C technologies and recommendations when they are applicable".  </s>
<s> I think that this is P3 as a general principle, although there are specific examples where the priority is higher.  </s>
<s> We should ensure that this is drawn out.  </s>
<s> The question of whether it is OK to use PDF is an interesting one.  </s>
<s> As well as the availability of equivalent alternatives for medium specific representations such as images, it really depends on the availability of User Agents as to whether it is accessible or not.  </s>
<s> Is that in our scope?  </s>
<s> An alternative approach is to include it in the list of things for which accessible alternatives are needed - checkpoint 1.1 Just some thoughts.  </s>

<s> Style sheets are definitely not HTML specific: both CSS and XSL are intended to apply to XML documents as well.  </s>
<s> Indeed, having an appropriate medium-specific style sheet for one's output device is even more important in the case of XML document types, where no reasonable default rendering can be supplied by the user agent.  </s>
<s> Regarding the importance of using the latest W3C specifications, I can think of several cases where there are specific access advantages, including: (1) HTML 4.0 compared with earlier versions; (2) CSS 2 positioning; (3) MathML as opposed to the use of images; (4) Smil as opposed to other multimedia formats that do not include access features.  </s>
<s> The access benefits of HTML 4.0 and CSS 2 are described in detail in relevant WAI publications, and there are similar advantages to be gained from the other formats mentioned.  </s>
<s> I think these benefits are so significant that checkpoint 11.1 deserves its priority 2 rating.  </s>
<s> In relation to PDF, one might be able to achieve Level A conformance in some circumstances using existing conversion technologies, provided that there are no multimedia objects in the PDF file and that the conversion software correctly determines the reading order of the document.  </s>
<s> However, PDF versions 1.2 and earlier do not support any genuine separation of content from presentation, and the conversion process is thus necessarily limited.  </s>
<s> PDF 1.3, with its support for a true structural tree, will resolve these drawbacks once it has been implemented by both authoring tools and conversion software.  </s>
<s> For the present, I fully support the existing checkpoint: properly structured HTML documents must be provided alongside any proprietary document formats that are to be used.  </s>
<s> The use of CSS is possible for HTML and for XML.  </s>
<s> But there are other approaches to solving the problem.  </s>
<s> For example in an HTML 3.2 world without CSS (which unfortunately is where many people still think they are living) it is perfectly possible to properly control the colours of certain document elemnts, secure in the knowledge that this can be easily over-ridden.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, the only mechanism available for controlling positioning - the abuse of tables, is not very easily over-ridden - it only comes with access to the DOM (or brutal reinterpretation of the source).  </s>
<s> Likewise, PDF does not allow control of the presentation.  </s>
<s> Which is why it is not accessible, and therefore should not be used for web content.  </s>
<s> Certainly the best approach is to use style sheets, along with other w3c standards.  </s>
<s> I think there is a case for saying, in paralell with the until user agents... clauses, "when user agents provide support for X, stop doing Y. The way that priorities are defined, we have to show that there is an (effectively) impassable barrier to make something a P1, or a significant barrier to make something P2. Things that are good ideas become P3 - new design should definitely take them into account, but they do not create barriers by themselves.  </s>

<s> Further to Charles' suggestion, perhaps we should say: If there is at least one free and widely available user agent that runs under a variety of operating systems and supports language feature X, where X has an accessibility advantage (E.G. style sheet positioning) and should therefore be used instead of old solution Y, where Y has a corresponding disadvantage in terms of accessibility, then authors should cease using Y in favour of X. Exception: this rule can be violated where X does not degrade gracefully when processed by user agents that do not support it.  </s>
<s> In previous work, this group has applied an analogous test in deciding whether authors should be required (at a priority 1 level) to implement a particular access solution: if there is a widely available multi-platform user agent which makes this accommodation unnecessary, then it need not be made, except perhaps as a priority 2 or 3 item.  </s>
<s> The criterion formulated above would apply, as one might say, in the reverse direction: if a certain new language feature has been implemented by at least one widely available user agent, and degrades gracefully, then it should be deployed and the kludge or deprecated language feature which it renders obsolete should accordingly be discarded.  </s>
