Hi folks, I think the 12.3.2 deliverable is ready to release - it's at the fact that it is late) Comments welcome.

Cheers Chaals Post: 21 Mitchell street, FOOTSCRAY Vic 3011, Australia or W3C, 2004 Route des Lucioles, 06902 Sophia Antipolis Cedex, France Hello Charles, The following citation in your report: gives an error 404. 
I was puzzled by the title of the report ("SWAD-Europe Deliverable 12.3.2: 
Transformation libraries report") compared to the content. 
I was also mildly surprised that your future work and lessons learned (section 7) addressed only process issues, not any of the insights you gained about using RDF data for visualisation. 
Have you done any user evaluation of the tool? 
That would be worth knowing more about. 
Regards, Ian Oh, that was an oversight. 
The process is more about using visualisation to work with RDF data, and the assumption (which turned out to be correct, and as you point out should have been explicit) was that visualisation methods that didn't rely on understanding a serialisation designedd for computers would help users. 
I'll edit it and fix the link (should be zones not zone). 
You need Adobe SVG viewer running, and you probably now need to leave the thing sitting around for a day or so to get the data :( But you can look at the source code :-) Cheers Chaals Post: 21 Mitchell street, FOOTSCRAY Vic 3011, Australia or W3C, 2004 Route des Lucioles, 06902 Sophia Antipolis Cedex, France
