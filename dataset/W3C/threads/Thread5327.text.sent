Hi Geoff, and others. 
I found the email below while searching the archives for discussions regarding the combination of FIPA and semantic web services. 
I would very much like to hear from people who have looked into the RDF Content Language Spec for FIPA, or the FIPA OWL files[1,2]. 
It would be very interesting to hear any views on speech acts-based agent commu nication (such as the FIPA ACL) and its relation to OWL-S, SWRL[3], DAML Query[4], etc. Pointers to papers or other information in this area would also be much appreci ated.

Until recently I worked in Sun Microsystems Laboratories; I've just shifted over into the office of the Chief Engineer. 
For several years I was involved in multiagent systems research in SunLabs, and was Sun's representative to (and board member of) FIPA, the Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents. 
During 2000-2002, a number of FIPA members were involved in work on standards for the software infrastructure for multiagent systems. 
As this work progressed, a number of us realized that the most promising way of exploiting the work in multiagent systems might be to marry it to the emerging web services movement. 
Accordingly, a number of us proposed the establishment of a "semantic web services" interest group within W3C. 
Our intent was to create a forum which would accomodate a variety of groups, including the DARPA agents community, the multiagent research community, and those working on the application of web services technology to applications using autonomous agents patterns. 
More recently I have been Sun's alternate representative to the W3C Web Services Architecture working group. 
My primary interest within SWS-IG is the software engineering problems associated with the creation of agents that are capable of semantically rich interoperation. 
When we worked in FIPA on agent communications language (ACL) and the FIPA abstract architecture (AA), it became apparent that the biggest obstacle to progress in interoperation was the lack of shared, open source software systems for implementing the BDI semantics of ACL. 
We had several sophisticated implementations of the "plumbing" (agent communications, advertisement, brokerage, and so forth). 
What we lacked were the tools to develop and gain practical expertise with multiagent applications, and this (from my perspective) made it impossible to really evaluate the utility of much of the theoretical work on agent communications. 
I want to encourage the adaptation of software tools for reasoning and planning to support semantically rich web services interactions. 
Geoff Hi, I've worked with JADE (the FIPA compliant agent platform) for a while and tried to build agents that offer semantic services (similar to OWL-S) to a broker. 
At some point I faced serious problems with getting my work integrated with the BDI model underlying the FIPA speech acts. 
I therefore decided to use Web Services instead, as some other people I know did. 
Anyway, the only thing I can contribute is a rather long mailing list thread at the JADE list from where you might get some views: Best regards Juergen Zimmer amp;In-Reply-To=C59CE700-131F-11D8-ABF5-000A95718676@sun.com&amp;amp;Refere nces=C59CE700-131F-11D8-ABF5-000A95718676@sun.com mailto:public-sws-ig@w3.org?Subject=Re:%20Introduction%20-%20Geoff%20Arnold&amp; amp;In-Reply-To=C59CE700-131F-11D8-ABF5-000A95718676@sun.com&amp;amp;Refere nces=C59CE700-131F-11D8-ABF5-000A95718676@sun.com
