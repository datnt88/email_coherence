<s> WL suggested that webmasters could just tell people to give them the electronic version which was used to produce the paper version.  </s>
<s> Which is usually true, although not always.  </s>
<s> One such case I recently ran into was a chinese document, which had been typeset and printed using some arcane system that could not readily be translated, as far as I could discover, and the alternative offered by  </s>
<s> the commissioners, was a PDF document of scanned material.  </s>
<s> (They are not experts.  </s>
<s> Otherwise they wouldn't pay me to do the job I suppose) The solution that we used (lacking OCR software for chinese, japanese, korean, vietnamese, and a few other languages I have had to convert to HTML) was to retype the material from a paper version.  </s>
<s> But there seems to be a simpler solution.  </s>
<s> It is posible using most browsers to print a web page.  </s>
<s> It is even usually possible to print it without the headers that say where it came from.  </s>
<s> And using CSS2 it will be possible to provide a full print stylesheet (@media print { print-style }) to ensure that it comes out looking beautiful.  </s>
<s> This is the value of PDF - it enables printed material to be reliably transferred electronically, then printed at the receiving end.  </s>
<s> For this one purpose it is an excellent medium, and cheaper for most people than using RTF, as well as (I believe) less capable of being used to transmit viruses.  </s>
<s> It is not a good substitute for HTML (in my humble opinion), and does not seem likely to become one.  </s>

<s> Working in libraries with commercially published publications, I have discovered that, specifically, some journal publishers or resellers don't have access to a single, manageable stream of electronic source material; the first point in the production system at which everything is in one format is when it's on paper.  </s>
<s> Admittedly, saying their production process is chaotic doesn't address what their process should be, or how they might address accessibility, but that's one situation.  </s>
<s> Another is that some commercial publishers are fanatical--if not completely paranoid--about maintaining consistent visual presentation of their materials.  </s>
<s> It is a branding issue for them.  </s>
<s> Again, this is a mindset that cares about the good of the company more than the good of the customer, but there it is.  </s>
<s> For either or both of these reasons, PDF is the norm in commercial publishing of electronic journals; HTML, SGML, and other flexible formats are in the minority.  </s>
<s> That's why we have a couple hundred Gigabytes of PDF on our servers.  </s>
<s> We cannot demand the ancestor electronic format because it simply isn't for sale.  </s>

<s> Hi everyone, Thought I would invite you to our first event dedicated to Web Accessibility.  </s>
<s> Hope to see you there: An event sponsored by Miller Freeman and featuring the topic of Web Accessibility, will be presented on Wednesday, September 23rd, 1998 in room 108 of the Hynes Convention Center from 1p.m. - 3p.m.  </s>
<s> The New England Chapter of the World Organization of Webmasters will host the event.  </s>
<s> Bruce Alexander, Chairman of WOW's Web Accessibility SIG, will serve as moderator.  </s>
<s> The World Wide Web offers the promise of transforming many traditional barriers to information and interaction among different peoples.  </s>
<s> Therefore it?s important to lead the Web to its full potential including promoting a high degree of usability for people with disabilities.  </s>
<s> Several initiatives are pursuing accessibility of the Web through five primary areas of work: technology, guidelines, tools, education &amp; outreach, and research &amp; development.  </s>
<s> Speakers at the event include the head of the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative, Judy Brewer.  </s>
<s> She coordinates five activities with respect to Web accessibility: data formats and protocols; guidelines for browsers, authoring tools and content creators; rating and certification tools; education and outreach; and research and advanced development.  </s>
<s> Prior to joining W3C, Judy was Project Director for the Massachusetts Assistive Technology Partnership, a U.S. federally-funded project promoting access to assistive technology for people with disabilities.  </s>
<s> Judy has a background in applied linguistics, education, technical writing, management and disability advocacy.  </s>
<s> Brewer will discuss the various projects the initiative has been working on including a draft of page authoring guidelines.  </s>
<s> The guidelines will help Web developers insure their site?s  </s>
<s> accessibility.  </s>
<s> Also speaking will be Joseph Lazzaro, project director of the Adaptive Technology Program housed at the Massachusetts Commission For The Blind in Boston, and author of "Adapting PC's for Disabilities", Addison-Wesley Publishing Company.  </s>
<s> His published articles have appeared in Byte, Time Life, the New York Times, Computer Shopper, and other industry trade magazines.  </s>
<s> Lazzaro will focus on the power and pitfalls experienced by persons with vision impairments when surfing the World Wide Web.  </s>
<s> He?ll briefly describe the basic technologies employed by persons with vision impairments: speech synthesis, screen magnification, and Braille displays and will describe how these basic technologies can be used to read web pages using both text and graphical browsers.  </s>
<s> Also speaking will be a representative from Microsoft Corporation who will discuss their efforts to make Internet Explorer more accessible to the Web browsing public.  </s>
<s> This event is open to the public.  </s>
<s> Afterwards, attendees may be interested in browsing through the Web ?98 Exposition.  </s>
<s> A free pass to the Expo can be gotten by registering online at https://www.exporeg.com/Shows/WebEast/expo1.htm Be sure to register now because registering for the Expo on-site will cost $50.  </s>
<s> This event is open to the public- free for members and $15 for non-members.  </s>
