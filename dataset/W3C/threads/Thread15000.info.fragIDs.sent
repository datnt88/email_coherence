<s> ------- Start of forwarded message ------- Subject: /colour/colourblindness.html Date: 2/5/02 3:11:07 AM Name: Ian City: Oxford Country: United Kingdom Message: Good to see this - as a mildly red-green colour blind person.  </s>
<s> (Although interestingly I can distinguish all the colours in the very first bar of nine colours.)  </s>
<s> It is sometimes a source of frustration, to say the least, that colourblindness is not mentioned in the context of web design.  </s>
<s> That apart I am just getting acquainted with your book (two days in) but it looks good so far.  </s>
<s> Basically although I already had a little, playing around, experience of php and mySQL, my work has me making a web inteface to an MS SQL server database and yours looked like a good reference.  </s>
<s> I'll let you know if further questions come up.  </s>
<s> --Ian -------- End of forwarded message --------  </s>
<s> I imagine what is needed is a validator, so that users can 'see' what their page would look like.  </s>
<s> thanks j.chetwynd@btinternet.com  </s>
<s> Hello Jonathan, What I envisage are pages where people with known colour discrimination problems can look at colour samples and report back on the result.  </s>
<s> They would identify the type of screen they use, crt, lcd, etc, and tick colour pairs that look different but not those that look the same.  </s>
<s> Each result would add to the information displayed and Web site developers could look to see the contrast required between colours.  </s>
<s> Each sample would display the HTML RGB parameter and any equivalent useful to image editors.  </s>
<s> People creating HTML could look for colour differences with universal acceptance and those without.  </s>
<s> If the information is presented as colour differentials, it could lead to a simple page where people type in their preferred colours and get the problem combinations highlighted.  </s>
<s> If someone wants to then take the calculations from the script and place them in to a validator, I could help.  </s>
<s> People creating images would get the general idea but creating an image validator would be difficult.  </s>
<s> Way beyond my poor brain.  </s>
<s> Easier to just have examples of what works and what does not.  </s>

<s> Web Page Design for Colour Blind Readers DO provide ALT="..." text for all your images.  </s>
<s> If a user cannot understand your image they can reload with images off.  </s>
<s> Consider using JavaScript MouseOver events to provide status-line descriptions of images- especially maps and navigation bars.  </s>
<s> DON'T use [red | green | brown | grey | purple] [next to | on top of | changing to] [red | green | brown | grey | purple].  </s>
<s> DO have a strong, bright contrast between foreground and background colours- not only for your page text but also in your images.  </s>
<s> Even totally colour blind readers can differentiate similar colours which contrast bright with dark.  </s>
<s> DON'T use colours in images to denote special areas, such as bar charts, maps and navigation bars.  </s>
<s> Consider using textures or line shading instead (try the "paper" or "pattern" function in your graph or painting program).  </s>
<s> Alternatively, provide additional written labels.  </s>
<s> DO use blue, yellow, white and black if you really must use colours to distinguish items.  </s>
<s> These combinations are less likely to be confused than others.  </s>
<s> An even better web site for information on color-blindness is I hope this helps everyone.  </s>

<s> Here's a neat page that's under development by Matt Wickline, a volunteer at the HWG's AWARE Center: He says you need the following in order to get best use out of this: "frames, javascript, color monitor, color vision all required..." Send feedback to Matthew Wickline He reports some problems with Opera users.  </s>

<s> Anyone know if it would be possible to remap colors on a page using CSS in order to compensate for a specific type of color blindness?  </s>
<s> Could I write a user stylesheet that would take a page where color was used to encode information and remap those colors to something a person with deuteranope could see, for example?  </s>
<s> Chas. Munat  </s>
<s> It's possible, assuming that we're only talking about CSS.  </s>
<s> I'd imagine you'd want something like this: (1) Download the web page and CSS page.  </s>
<s> Analyze it for color use.  </s>
<s> (2) Set up an appropriate color mapping for the specific type of color blindness.  </s>
<s> (3) Apply that to the page and present to the user.  </s>
<s> Step (3) is pretty easy.  </s>
<s> Step (1) is not so hard.  </s>
<s> Step (2) I'm not sure how hard it is, but it may be relatively easy to do.  </s>
<s> Unfortunately can't do it just by doing, e.g.: (x) Apply a generic style sheet to a page.  </s>
<s> You need to have that analysis and mapping and application  </s>
<s> process.  </s>
<s> Sounds like a fun challenge.  </s>

<s> Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to handle CSS at all.  </s>
<s> I can't use it, for example, on my own web site, which (properly, I believe) doesn't encode any color in the HTML, only in CSS.  </s>

<s> Why? Why can't I just map all reds on the page -- for example -- to a known color that I can recognize?  </s>
<s> Granted, the color space is smaller, but how many colors are used on a web page typically?  </s>
<s> If I can't see reds, for example, then maybe I can map reds to a particular shade of blue and other blues to another shade of blue.  </s>
<s> Or better yet, maybe I could add some sort of text decoration -- an overline maybe -- to any text that was red.  </s>
<s> Obviously images would be a problem (another blow to text-in-images), but if CSS can override the default colors, why wouldn't this work?  </s>
<s> And as for mapping colors to colors, if I knew which colors were mapped  </s>
<s> to which (and it was consistent across pages), then even if a site said something such as "new items are in red," I would know that this particular shade of blue corresponded to red, so I'd still be able to get around it.  </s>

<s> Oh, that's fine and that's what I suggested based on your initial proposal.  </s>
<s> Because there's no rules for color transformations built into CSS.  </s>
<s> I can't write something which says: ~~color: blue~~ { color: red; }  </s>
<s> Oh, well, what you suggest should work pretty reliably most of the time; the only problem is that it can't be done with CSS unless there's major changes to how CSS handles color.  </s>
<s> I don't know if the CSS3 color-profile model will help any.  </s>
<s> (Another CSS-related idea would be to attempt to recast everything in system colors.)  </s>
<s> Ultimately, what would work better is simply a browser plug-in for users, which transforms colors as they need 'em.  </s>
<s> I think this is a good idea.  </s>

<s> There isn't any technical barrier to doing this as far as I can tell, but it doesn't work with CSS - you waould have to develop a transformation.  </s>
<s> (You can also do this for images, although I suspect the coding is a little more complex except for SVG where it uses CSS for colours anyway....) I suggest if you think this is a good project you take discussion to the wai-er-ig group and see where there is interest/expertise.  </s>
