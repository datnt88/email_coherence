I experienced a strange bug today: The Amaya installation seems to be unable to proceed past the first confirmation box when Outlook 2003 is running. 
Shutting down Outlook did the trick, and the installation proceeded immediately.

Not sure this is the explanation.

I have several GB free. 
And there is no error message; the installation seems to just "pause" until Outlook is closed.
