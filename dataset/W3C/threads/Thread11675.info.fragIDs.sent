Hello Translators, 
I'm new in this list! 
I'd like to translate XHTML 1.0 http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/ in to swedish. 
So I'm wondering if there is anybody currently working with it? 
Is it just to start or do I need permission to begin? 
Regards, Tor H?rnqvist 
Hello, 
Welcome! 
So far, no one reported to work on Swedish translation of XHTML 1.0. 
cf. http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/translations#xhtml1 
Please refer to the information on translations in our Copyright FAQ at: The first thing to do is: 5.6 Can I translate one of your specifications into another language? 
Yes, you may translate a W3C Technical Report provided that you comply with the all of the following requirements: 1. Inform the W3C of your plan to translate our content and inform us of when you've completed and published the translation. 
Such notice should be sent in English to w3c-translators@w3.org [public archive] and -- if provided -- the comments email list associated with that document. 
You have already done so, so you may go ahead.

Hello Tor, As available on the W3C Web site, you don't need permission to start a translation of a W3C specification, you just have to tell us as you did below. 
Regards, Martin.
