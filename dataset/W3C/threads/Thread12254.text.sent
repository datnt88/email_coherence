This is a reminder that we will have a short one hour phone meeting tomorrow Wednesday the 19th from 4pm to 5pm Boston time. 
The phone number is +1-(617)-252-7000. 
The agenda is at: Hopefully we will have closure on all action items by the meeting so we can proceed in preparing the techniques draft, (hint, hint). 
Talk to you then. 
Jutta On stardate 18 Apr 2000, Jutta Treviranus sent a subspace communication stating: Hi. 
I'm Frederick Barnett, and I'm the replacement for Kynn Bartlett here for the HTML Writers Guild. 
While I realize this is not the best way to make a first impression, I'm afraid I have to ABEND what would've been my first meeting. 
I will not be home all day Wednesday. 
I will definitely be there for the next meeting. 
My apologies for missing this one. 
Member: HWG Governing Board &amp; Assistant Secretary Welcome to the group and thank you for warning us of your absence. 
I look forward to your participation at the next teleconference. 
Jutta
