Hi : Why the Amaya1.2 didn't have the presistent cache. 
whether the other version have the characteristics? 
If I want to add the presistent cache, else the "query.c" 
to modify, which other to notice. 
Please tell me how can I do next step. 
Thanks. 
Thanks for advance. 
Up to now, only the Amaya/java version has proposed a persistent cache. 
A future release of Amaya/libwww will do so too, as we're switching to libwww5.ij (better cache support).
