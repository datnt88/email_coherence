Some issues that arose: - I conveyed the group's desire to receive sponsorship from both the W3C and the IETF. 
Keith and Harald wanted to know exactly what this meant -- which procedures would be followed, who would control documents, etc. 
I stated that the IETF procedures and guidelines would be the ones followed. 
The benefit from W3C sponsorship would be to receive greater review and exposure in the Web community. 
Documents would be initially prepared according to IETF guidelines, then mirrored to the W3C. 
There was some concern that being a W3C working group would mean that working group documents could be kept hidden, which is contrary to the spirit and rules of the IETF. 
I reaffirmed our position that the WEBDAV working group is open, producing open intermediate and final documents, and that this would not change under W3C sponsorship. 
I'm somewhat surprised by this idea. 
Firstly, is it really the group's desire to be sponsored by W3C? 
I've seen no opinions expressed either way. 
Secondly, is the Web not part of the Internet? 
Are you suggesting that W3C members do not take IETF standards to be definitive? 
I'd also suggest that since W3C operates in a way which is contrary to the IETF's practices, that it is not necessarily in the IETF's best interests to endorse W3C in this way.

Apache-SSL author At the IETF meeting, on Tuesday, December 10, 1996, I had the opportunity to have lunch with the IETF Application Area Directors, Harald Alvestrand, and Keith Moore. 
Also in attendance at this lunch were Larry Masinter, and Del Jensen. 
When we weren't fighting the noise from planes (from the nearby San Jose airport), trains (we were eating at a cafe right next to the San Jose Light Rail tracks), and automobiles (the cafe was also right on the street), we discussed whether the IETF should have a working group considering Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning issues. 
The impression I received was that our draft charter was well received, and managed to avoid several common draft charter pitfalls. 
Both Keith and Harald liked the idea of working on distributed authoring and versioning technology.

I reaffirmed our position that the WEBDAV working group is open, producing open intermediate and final documents, and that this would not change under W3C sponsorship. 
- There was some concern over having me listed as an author on the DAV protocol specification, due to my need to claim academic credit for the activity. 
Since I would not be the editor of the document, I received the impression that this might be workable (but that Keith and Harald would need to look into this). 
At the lunch we discussed a roadmap for what comes next: - At the WEBDAV BOF, a vote would be taken to determine whether the participants of the BOF felt the IETF should pursue work in Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning. 
- If the vote was positive, then Harald and Keith would review the draft charter, and return their comments to me. 
- After iterating the charter until it is satisfactory with Harald and Keith, it will be submitted to the IESG for final approval. 
- Jim The opinion of the group, as expressed at the Palo Alto meeting, was that we should pursue joint sponsorship by the IETF and the W3C. 
This was written in the minutes from the Palo Alto meeting (Day 2, 2nd paragraph). 
Hmmm. 
I can't find these minutes, but my records are far from perfect. 
Was this meeting a W3C meeting, by any chance? 
I notice that the recent meeting seems only to have been asked about IETF sponsorship. 
No. If you received this impression, then it is due to a deficiency in my communication to the mailing list. 
How did you receive this impression? 
I don't know. 
I suppose its because W3C doesn't tell me what its up to, which makes me sceptical about its dedication to open standards, combined with my surprise that joint sponsorship was contemplated. 
I view sponsorship of the DAV activity as endorsement of the goal of developing a standard way to perform remote authoring and versioning of Web content, rather than any statement about the IETF endorsing the W3C, or vice-versa. 
That may be the way you view it, and very possibly the way I view it, too. 
But is it the way the world views it? 
Furthermore, I am not convinced that W3C adds any value to the IETF process. 
Cheers, Ben.
