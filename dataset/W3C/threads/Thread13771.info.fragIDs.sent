<s> JRG:: I think tables for navigation bars and other standard tables should have specific labels like "navbar", or if there are more than one "navbar1", "navbar2", "navbar3"... If tabling (is tabling a word?) is used for formating, maybe the label should just be: "table is being used for xxx visual formatting."  </s>
<s> Are there other structures besides nav bars that could have "standard" labels.  </s>
<s> JRG:: I think on one level labels sould be used to desribe why the tabel is there, but on a functional side that seems a bit extreme for the author to have to define.  </s>

<s> I talked to Dave Raggett about this issue and I think we both agree that there is a threshold below which a table can be considered "simple".  </s>
<s> I propose the following: - if it only has a single row of header cells at the top and/or - if it only has a single column of header cells on the left side (modulo right-to-left directionality) In these two cases (which should be treated together), given a cell, it is really easy for an agent to find the column and the row header they belong to without requiring the author to add more markup.  </s>
<s> In other words, there is a potential "default" value for the scope attribute on TH that can be defined as: - if all the cells in a row (TR) are header (TH), then scope defaults to col - if only the first cell in a row (TR) is a header (TH) then scope defaults to row We might go as far as trying to define default values for rowgroup and colgroup cases (covering sub-headers) but I'd be happy with just that in the guidelines.  </s>

<s> In the mean time, I'll share some drawing of table templates using pseudo markup (TR, TH, and TD) that Dave and I have been exchanging (hope it's not too unaccessible) Simplest table (a single header row at the top): TR TH TH TH TR TD TD TD TR TD TD TD Next step up with headers on both rows and columns (~ below represents an empty cell): TR ~ TH TH TR TH TD TD TR TH TD TD Another common case has two levels of column headers.  </s>

<s> However, we should recommend people to use column groups to make the grouping more explicit.  </s>
<s> Two levels of *rows* headers are not generally done in the same way since it wastes too much space.  </s>
<s> Instead an extra row is inserted into the table and a special column header is used to label the row headings below it.  </s>
<s> We could recommend people use row groups to make this explicit e.g. repeated TBODY elements.  </s>
<s> The scope attribute can then be used to make the scope of the header explicit.  </s>
<s> But IMHO this is not a "simple table" anymore.  </s>
