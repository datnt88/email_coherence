Expect criticism if you top-post "Adding superfluous nav elements, just because they're consistent with the rest of the site, is just silly." 
How do you determine the goal of every user coming to the site? 
If I wanted to read another article on this site I would have to go backwards to go forwards. 
Consistent navigation allows the user to keep moving forward.

Expect criticism if you top-post I didn't find this particular article all that insightful. 
Lee's comment is a good one, and missed entirely by the article's author. 
It might possibly apply to a site that has but one single goal process, but few of those creatures exist. 
Even a site that sells nothing but clothing has a more complex process than just "I want to buy a size 3 shoe." 
What about the user who wants to contact the company, apply for a job, find out something about them, find out their policies, or take a look at that nice sweater on the home page? 
Do users care where they are on a web site? 
Usually, no, they don't. 
Might they want to find their way back to a number of other parts of the site? 
Yes, they do. 
Bread crumb navigation isn't just to show off the information's hierarchy, it's also to show how to find your way back the way you came.
