(At last - sorry folks. 
Thanks to Gregory for taking them) Charles W3C Web Accessibility Initiative http://www.w3.org/WAI Location: I-cubed, 110 Victoria Street, Carlton VIC 3053 Postal: GPO Box 2476V, Melbourne 3001, Australia Sorry I wasn't on the phone call. 
I also forgot to send regrets. 
For my repentance I read the minutes. 
Now I need to clarify a point or two about the new IBM guidelines, the scope of the techniques document, and the approach to comments on the techniques. 
IBM guidelines: For those of you who haven't read them, there are 5 sets of guidelines, one for hardware, Lotus Notes, Java applications, Software applications, and Web sites. 
The only set that applies to the ATAG are the ones on Software and Java applications. 
IBM has no specific guidelines for tool developers other than the ones on software and Java. 
Only these two would apply to ATAG 7.1 and actually were "filled out" by several tool developers as they assessed themselves against the ATAG. 
The IBM guidelines were written by myself, James Thatcher, Richard Schwerdtfeger, Shannon Rapuano, Kim Stephens, Andi Snow-Weaver, and John Steger. 
They are not "pie-in-the-sky" because they actually have been used by IBM developers, updated by us experts, re-used by developers, and again updated by us experts. 
We're getting it right and we're on version 2.1 of the checklists. 
Since we [IBM] don't have specifics guidelines on tools, we don't have any ready made content for the ATAG Techniques Note. 
other than 7.1. 
Comments regarding "import from ERT" and "conformance evals": The relationship between the ERT, the "conformance evals", and the ATAG Techniques Note need to be clarified. 
I would not support importing from the ERT anymore than importing from the IBM Java guidelines for ATAG 7.1. 
Having a lot of links from the techniques to the ERT would be helpful. 
Having a lot of links from the techniques to the "conformance evals" would be helpful, and the same with Windows and Java applications guidelines. 
So that brings us to the unique purpose of the ATAG Techniques Note document. 
In my mind it is unique in that it maps from the ATAG to the ERT and other documents. 
It's value is in the mapping. 
If either the ERT, or the Windows, or Java documents need help, those document should be helped and not added to the techniques uniquely. 
If there is an implementation revealed in the "conformance evals" that we as a working group agree is invalid or undesirable, and hopefully not in the ERT, then it could be within the purpose of the techniques document to list what NOT to do. 
These "DO NOT's" could be explained without specifically pointing to the vendor(s) implementing them. 
We would never know ALL the vendors doing the bad or good things, so none of them should be listed in the techniques document. 
Comment regarding "subject lines" being "cool-o-matic": I'm confused. 
Is the latest two threads with the subject line "Techniques for 3.1 (get alternative content)" and "techniques for 3.2 (separate structure/content and presentation" the first two examples of the cool-o-matic approach? 
And when I want to talk about a specific technique that connects between ATAG and the WCAG I would use the subject title "ATAG 3.2 WCAG 1.1" ? 
Regards, Phill Jenkins [clip from minutes http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/meetings/16feb00] WL: been reading these type of GLs for 5 years, and most of it is pie-in-the-sky; CMN: yeah, but much which used to be pie-in-the-sky aren't anymore; as historian trained to read documents and comparatively analyze them, so for me (and maybe GJR) it is a rewarding and enjoyable experience JT: what is best mechanism to populate Techniques document? 
import from ERT? WL: suggest that whoever wrote up notes at IBM be contacted to fill in some blanks; same at Microsoft, Allaire, etc. DB: could you repeat -- there was someone at the door WL: need people who are writing guidelines for their company, show real life examples of how ATAG satisfied by company's own projects CMN: 2 approaches: do a conformance eval by sitting down with tool and describing how it happens -- not a simple Yes or No, but how it does it or how it fails to do it, and/or how it could do it consistent with the "look-and-feel" of the tool; other thing is to sit down and run threads on the AU list checkpoint by checkpoint -- would need to keep subject lines -- reply to message, so that they are automatically threaded in mail archive -- makes tracking easier WL: and vice versa -- if have new topic, create new subject line CMN: yeah; running threads -- 4.2 WCAG 1.1, ATAG 4.2 WCAG 1.2; etc; DB, JR, KB, WL, GJR: cool-o-matic [end clip] Hi Phill, My experience has been that it is better to have a short form of techniques available than just a mapping to another document. 
I think ERT will form a major set of "techniques for this guideline", especially for guideline 4, and we should point to it (and point this out) rather than copy it, in the same way as we do for 7.1. 
However, I think there is still value in providing a short summary in the docuent itself. 
What I would like to see in a future techniqes document is several possible versions, based on one all-encompassing monster that nobody actually reads, which includes basic ideas on how to do everything, as well as references and pointers to reference implementations, but from which can be distilled a version that provides references, or a version that includes everything that is relevant to image and multimedia tools, or a version that just describes testing techniques and links to test cases, and so on. 
Sorry for the tortured sentence... Charles [snip] Comments regarding "import from ERT" and "conformance evals": The relationship between the ERT, the "conformance evals", and the ATAG Techniques Note need to be clarified.

[snip] aloha, phil! as scribe for the last telecon, i recorded the "cool-o-matic" response to what charles was minuted as having stated immediately prior to the general agreement voiced on the call, to wit: quote CMN: yeah; running threads -- ATAG 4.2 WCAG 1.1, ATAG 4.2 WCAG 1.2; etc; unquote recently, charles has begun to post quote thinking points unquote for discussion at tomorrow's telecon on the AU list, which are being threaded using the following syntax: Technique X.Y (technique subject) rather than using the cool-o-matic approach ATAG X.Y WCAG Z.Q but before i ascribe this inconsistency to the age-old gap between theory and practice rearing its ugly head, charles should have his say... i think he is merely trying to collate in one place all of the WCAG checkpoints that apply to specific ATAG checkpoints, as a basis for moving forward on specific techniques, which will then be threaded using the cool-o-matic subject line syntax, viz: ATAG 3.2 WCAG 1.1 at least, that's what _i_ think charles is doing... charles, what say you?
