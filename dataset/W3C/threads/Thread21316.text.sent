Hi All, In response to Dan's challenge, here is a SOAP server and client for the query engine. 
At the moment, it only lets you query by file name (can be a local file name, or an HTTP URI), but it works alright. 
I had to modify query.py a little so that it would run using a SOAP interface (I have not added the other changes that need to be done yet). 
Aaron, could you bung it in CVS please? 
It's attached as query.py  . 
As for the server and client, the server is attached as query-server.py  
, and runs with:- python query-server.py  
errors.html 
Further to the attached query.py, 
you'll need rdfapi.py, 
ntriples.py 
to run it, available from CVS [1], and of course SOAP.py. 
To run the client, which is attached as  query-client.py  
, load up the server, and try:- python query-client.py  
output.n3 for the built in test (which runs over the Web), and:- python query-client.py 
URIa URIb  output.n3 for your own query. 
As query.py gets updated, more features may follow.

Done. 
My distaste for SOAP's abuse of WebArch in this instance prevents me from committing the client and server stuff.

Agreed, but it was a fun hack :-) Kindest Regards, Sean B. Palmer @prefix : http://webns.net/roughterms/ .

O.K., so it veritably sucked... not only did it use POST instead of GET, but it used it over a non-CGI based server. 
Well, to make up for that, find attached a proper CGI  query.cgi  of about half the size, that works just as well, and runs in an ordinary browser. 
There, now you can relax Aaron... or should I say REST?
