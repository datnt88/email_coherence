<s> Hi, I'd like to propose that guidelines be modified to allow web page developers who are using technology to create web pages dynamically to take better advantage of the opportunities offered by this technology.  </s>
<s> I'm not quite sure what the best structure would be, but the general direction would be something along the lines of creating two main groupings of guidelines.  </s>
<s> If a user cannot choose the format of the page being presented, there would be one grouping of guidelines for that page.  </s>
<s> If a user can choose in what format a web page would be presented and have the information be the same in each format, there would be a different grouping of guidelines for that page.  </s>
<s> The "single page format" grouping of guidelines would be pretty much the same as the current guidelines.  </s>
<s> (In this case, the universal design is being provided by a single web page format which is appropriately designed.)  </s>
<s> The "multiple page format" grouping of guidelines would have some of the same guidelines as are in the "single page format" but would provide more flexibility in addressing accessibility.  </s>
<s> (In this case, the uiversal design is being provided by the collection of formats for a web page instead of a single format.)  </s>
<s> A reason I'm thinking of two different groupings is that I think it will be easier for developers to follow rather than trying to identify for each guideline whether it applies to the single format pages, the multiple format pages or to both types of pages.  </s>

<s> Hi, Charles I'm not sure you're understanding my point.  </s>
<s> The difference is that when a web page is generated dynamically, it can be created to more accurately meet the user's needs.  </s>
<s> In my little experiment, almost all of the screen reader users preferred the web page which was created to meet their needs better.  </s>
<s> The impression I'm under is that each user chose a screen reader and then used that screen reader to look at both web pages.  </s>
<s> Since a user used the same screen reader for each of the two sample pages, the preference of the web page tailored for screen readers was more likely due to the difference in how the web page was formatted.  </s>
<s> An important fact is that what makes a web page attractive to sighted users often adds impediments to blind users.  </s>
<s> If a web site developer is given more freedom to make certain formats more attractive with less need to worry about the guidelines as much, they might be more willing to create formats which are better suited for blind users.  </s>
<s> This would seem to be better than requiring one format to meet all requirements of some conformance level.  </s>
<s> Everyone's needs has a better chance of being met.  </s>
<s> My suggestion is to modify the guidelines to recognize this fact.  </s>
<s> The issue is not content.  </s>
<s> The same content can be presented in each format.  </s>
<s> Your statement about a "user impact matrix" is kind of interesting.  </s>
<s> Your argument can also be applied to the guidelines.  </s>
<s> Don't the guidelines themselves make certain generalizations about particular groups.  </s>
<s> For example, I can point out a number of areas of access problems that the guidelines don't address that cause trouble for users.  </s>
<s> These areas are not generally known because there has been very little research based on observation on what kinds of problems blind users can run into.  </s>
<s> By ignoring the problems, the guidelines are assuming they are not issues that affect users very much.  </s>
<s> Guidelines do imply generalizations.  </s>
<s> Scott  </s>
<s> I do not agree that there is any demonstrable difference for a user, whether the page was generated dynaimcally or hand-created by manually resetting bits of memory.  </s>
<s> I therefore think this is an inappropriate split.  </s>
<s> Where there are multiple versions of a page available there is a difference.  </s>
<s> The current guidelines require that at least one version of each page meet the guidelines entirely, and conformance is based on the conformance of the single version.  </s>
<s> Is there a case for having conformance based on the cumulative conformance to checkpoints of several versions?  </s>
<s> Personally, I feel theere is not, since requiring a user to choose several pages in order to get the different types of content that they require is not helpful, and in some cases is on its own going to render content inaccessible.  </s>
<s> (Scott's example of telling someone to learn CSS and write a stylesheet as a method of access is a similar barrier.) There may be value in a "user impact matrix" - which allows designers who are not going to meet a conformance level to provide accessibility for a particular targetted group.  </s>
<s> However this implies making a bunch of generalisations about particular groups, and seems an exercise fraught with difficulty for a dubious return (the risk is that people will simply target people who are blind, or mobility impaired, or some other single group, and then claim they are doing all that is feasible for accessibility).  </s>
<s> Charles McCN  </s>
<s> Scott, The guidelines promote Universal design, rather than targetted design, precisely in order to avoid the problem of helping one group at the expense of another.  </s>
<s> They recognise that there may be situations in which content is created in a way that is not generally accessible, and provide for that content to also be provided in a generally accessible format in order to claim conformance for that content.  </s>
<s> Note that this is not the same as a text-only version.  </s>
<s> For example, there are more people with partial vision than there are blind people in Australia by several times, and I presume that this is the case elsewhere.  </s>
<s> Most of these people find images useful to a certain extent (if they are properly used, which is a big if) and it is possible through good design to use graphics in a way which does not have anegative impact on blind users.  </s>
<s> Such universal design stretegies serve the various communities much better than a couple of groups being targetted (prehaps completely blind and completely deaf) and every other group being ignored.  </s>
<s> The guidelines make no distinction between dynamically and statically generated content because they describe requirements so that end-users can access content.  </s>
<s> If you can provide us with information about access problems that are not addressed by the curret guidelines, please do, so we can address them in revisions.  </s>
<s> That is why we seek a diverse group of members for the working group - no one person is likely to know all the problemfaced by all the users of the web.  </s>
<s> Cheers Charles [snip] Your statement about a "user impact matrix" is kind of interesting.  </s>
<s> Your argument can also be applied to the guidelines.  </s>
<s> Don't the guidelines themselves make certain generalizations about particular groups.  </s>
<s> For example, I can point out a number of areas of access problems that the guidelines don't address that cause trouble for users.  </s>

<s> By ignoring the problems, the guidelines are assuming they are not issues that affect users very much.  </s>
<s> Some short notes and an important call.... Short Notes (opinions not rulings) 1) When discussing universal design, we should be sure to decide if we are  </s>
<s> talking about universal design applied to the website - or applied to the page.  </s>
<s> I think dynamically generated presentations is clearly universal design of the site.  </s>
<s> I think I prefer pages that transform of themselves  </s>
<s> rather than server side assisted transformations, but I'm not sure which will actually give more people more usable pages.  </s>
<s> My guess is that transforming pages will more often provide users with all the information (e.g. less inadvertent editing out of info) but that server side would generate more usable pages for each domain 2) I don't think our guidelines should take a stand on how the pages are generated.... But rather on what makes a page accessible... If we can avoid how and stick to what - I think that is better.  </s>
<s> 3) I think server side solutions will wreak havoc with accessibility validators 4) We should look again at the interaction of our priority guidelines and regulations.  </s>
<s> In the past our priorities have been determined basically by  </s>
<s> what makes a page accessible....  </s>
<s> Not by its ease of implementation.  </s>
<s> If regulations are going to say Priority 1 and 2 - then we need to think this  </s>
<s> through carefully.  </s>
<s> I hate to say this but I think we do.  </s>
<s> 5) I think we will have some very interesting discussions at CSUN.  </s>
<s> I am looking forward to everyone's views.  </s>
<s> -- IMPORTANT CALL -- BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY - If you think that we need to do something different  </s>
<s> with the guidelines You must come to CSUN with suggestions (or post them to this list).  </s>
<s> Specific  </s>
<s> suggestions for change.  </s>
<s> We are beginning to just run in circles with opinions and general concepts.  </s>
<s> I think that this stage is essential, but we also need to move on to the next one as well.  </s>
<s> At least we need to see what the options might look like  </s>
<s> if they were implemented.  </s>
<s> There are always problems with any approach.  </s>
<s> The question is, would an alternate approach be a better than what we have.  </s>
<s> To determine that we need to start looking at specifics as well as the general concepts.  </s>
<s> Specific ideas or suggestions for the guidelines or techniques doc anyone?  </s>

<s> i also agree with Nir, in that universal design is independent of the state, that is server or client-side - the goal is to ensure the user gets what they need.  </s>
<s> this is done several ways: 1. Server side processing of requests that generate or spit out HTML pages per universal design.  </s>
<s> These are produced by dynamic low-end solutions or via middleware, and 2. Client-side efforts that can be turned off or rendered through other means.  </s>
<s> But a form can be processed via server-side if client is turned off.  </s>
<s> So in effect if i use personalization and content management software, then you can subscribe to a service.  </s>
<s> Where you can be a PWD with different profile.  </s>
<s> This could be an effective means.  </s>
<s> As software and content delivery becomes more sophisticated, it is a way to reach a broader audience - as based upon guidelines.  </s>
<s> There are already subscription services that broker credit card payment and this could be a similar service for a protal.  </s>
<s> I disagree, I do not think server side solutions will wreak havoc with accessibility validators.  </s>
<s> Validators must be tuned to meet requirements to meet demand.  </s>
<s> The fact that it is a free service is a question, that is, can it meet demand or do we need to find someone to modify it on a continual basis.  </s>
<s> For example, macromedia flash, where we now use ALT tags, or server side validation.  </s>
<s> A standard or technique to be implemented would be for form validation to use bold and asterick for mandatory items, and upon validation a plus sign and red bold for invalid entries.  </s>
<s> You can still use javascript but wold not need to use NOSCRIPT if it is validated on server side.  </s>
<s> Client-side valisdation increase download time and server side validation increases server processing time.  </s>
<s> How you chose to implement this is an operations issue dependent upon your server configuration (one, two or three tier, processor and traffic for both normal and the unexpected spike) I agree with item 4 and 5. Please go to suggest you click on the checkpoint list to comment.  </s>
