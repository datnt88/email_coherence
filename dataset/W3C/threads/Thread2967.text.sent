Sorry, I don't have a good example handy. 
Maybe someone on the HTTP_WG mailing list does. 
Hello! 
I've read some stuff on HTTP chunk transfer mode but I don't really understand what my HTTP messages should be to transfer an entity to a server. 
Could you write me an example of message to transfer an entity with chunks? 
For example an entity which size is 2048, what are the message (first, next, ..., last) that will be sent to the server if I use 512-sized chunks? 
Best regards, Pierre Here is an example (extracted from a test trace) of an HTTP response message transferring a 20-byte entity (cygpjmlomtdjwfelowxv) using two 10-byte chunks: HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n Transfer-Encoding: chunked\r\n Date: Tue, 07 Jan 2003 17:32:17 GMT\r\n \r\n a\r\n cygpjmlomt\r\n a\r\n djwfelowxv\r\n 0\r\n \r\n All necessary details are in the section 3.6.1 
"Chunked Transfer Coding" of RFC 2616, of course. 
HTH, Alex. HTTP performance - Web Polygraph benchmark www.measurement-factory.com | HTTP compliance+ - Co-Advisor test suite all of the above - PolyBox appliance HI, I am sending a HTTP/1.1 POST to the Origin Server from the proxy with out Transfer-Encoding header, But Origin Server send the chunked data as a response to the Proxy, Is this the right behavior of HTTP Origin Server.

Yes, in HTTP/1.1 chunked transfer-encdings have to be supported by server and clients.

Transfer-Encoding applies to what you are sending, not what you are willing to accept. 
Look for the TE request header for that. 
However, chunked is always allowed as a transfer-encoding in http/1.1
