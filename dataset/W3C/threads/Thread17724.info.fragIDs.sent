Guideline ratings and interpretation. 
I would like to get some discussion on current guideline rating system. 
In past telecons the issue has been raised about mainstream borwsers, specialized browsers and 3rd party assitive technology compatibility. 
Does our current rating system reflect concerns of these three groups? 
Do we want to change the following definitions? 
Rating and Classification Each guideline is classified according to the following rating system: [Priority 1] This guideline must be implemented, or one or more groups of users will find it impossible to access information in the document. 
Implementing this guideline is a basic requirement for some groups to be able to use WWW documents. 
[Priority 2] This guideline should be implemented, or one or more groups of users will find it difficult to access information in the document. 
Implementing this guideline will significantly improve access to WWW documents. 
[Priority 3] This guideline should be implemented to make it easier for one or more groups of users to access information in the document. 
Implementing this guideline will improve access to WWW documents.

Won't the rating system depend partly on how the UA Guidelines are organized? 
For instance, will there be separate guideline sections for mainstream vs specialized browsers? 
Or one guideline section with separate ratings for each browser class? 
Or...? Out of curiosity, where/how do third-party media players (e.g. VRML players) fit in? 
Is that mainstream or specialized?

We could try to separate into "mainstream" vs. "specialized" and have different rating systems. 
But I think this assumes that we know how technology will change in the future. 
What might be consdiered a specialized feature today, may be considered a mainstream idea tommorrow. 
So we could insert the following statement into each priority level: "by user agents as a built-in feature or through compatibility with assistive technology" Revised Priority List: [Priority 1] This guideline must be implemented by user agents as a built-in feature or through compatibility with assistive technology, or one or more groups of users with disabilities will find it impossible to access information in the document. 
Implementing this guideline is a basic requirement for some groups to be able to use WWW documents. 
[Priority 2] This guideline should be implemented by user agents as a built-in feature or through compatibility with assistive technology, or one or more groups of users will find it difficult to access information in the document. 
Implementing this guideline will significantly improve access to WWW documents. 
[Priority 3] This guideline should be implemented by user agents as a built-in feature or through compatibility with assistive technology, to make it easier for one or more groups of users to access information in the document. 
Implementing this guideline will improve access to WWW documents.

How would the suggested wording apply to pwWebspeak -- for which presentation of a video stream, for instance, is not possible?

I think we are only asking user agents to make sure that they are making accessible the types of document elements that it supports. 
So if a user agent doesn't support multi-media elements, then it doesn't need to support accessibility for those elements either. 
Although I think pwWebSpeak is moving in a driection to support accessible multi-media elements in future releases.
