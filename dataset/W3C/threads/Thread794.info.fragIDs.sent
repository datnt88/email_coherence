<s> I understand correctly that inline tags should never contain block tags?  </s>
<s> If nothing else, Tidy's diagnostic message could be clearer.  </s>

<s> HTML Tidy is generating correct HTML but not optimal HTML.  </s>
<s> Given incorrect HTML, my understanding is that Tidy should attempt to correct it in such a way as to reproduce (where possible) the behavior of the incorrect HTML on common browsers.  </s>
<s> So given that the original structure: is invalid (anchor elements cannot contain block elements, i.e., a cannot contain center ), Tidy corrects this to: where the div s plus CSS take the place of the center s.  </s>
<s> This is correct, but a better translation, i.e., equally correct and closer to the original behavior, would be: or specifically: Note that the correction suggested by the original poster: is invalid.  </s>
<s> span would be syntactically correct, as it is an inline element, but then the CSS would be invalid (the class="c1" that Tidy generates includes a "text-align" property, and "text-align" applies only to block elements).  </s>
