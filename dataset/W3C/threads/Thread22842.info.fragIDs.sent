<s> I am trying to copy a node from one document and insert it into a separate document tree.  </s>
<s> I tried to cloneNode(true) it and insertBefore() into the new document, but a DOMException with a code of "WRONG_DOCUMENT_ERROR" is raised.  </s>
<s> Why is this a limitation, and is there an easy perform this operation with standard DOM methods?  </s>

<s> FAQ PROPOSAL, since it comes up on a regular basis in every XML-related discussion I monitor... Nodes may not be moved directly from one Document to another.  </s>
<s> To accomplish this task, you must create new nodes in the target document, using the data from the source document.  </s>
<s> It's not hard to write a simple tree-walker to do this, but it's a nuisance.  </s>
<s> DOM Level 2 will add the importNode() method to do that work for you.  </s>
<s> Some DOMs (eg IBM's) already include a prototype of that function.  </s>
<s> But if you want a portable solution that will work with DOM Level 1, you have to provide your own routine for the purpose.  </s>
<s> A better alternative, in many cases, is not to create a second Document at all.  </s>
<s> If you can pass your main Document into whatever routine is generating the second tree, and use its factories, you'll be able to insert those nodes directly.  </s>
<s> For future reference: DOM Level 3 is looking at the general issue of loading/storing DOMs, and I would expect that the question of loading additional data into an existing document is one of the use cases they've considered.  </s>
