I'm not asking the WG or the W3C to endorse any vendor specific technology. 
Likewise, the WG shouldn't just say "Priority 1: Implement DOM Level 1" Okay - let's say we did exactly that. 
Would it help accessibility? 
Currently not. 
User Agents Thanks for your comments chuck, DOM is the W3C recommendation for providing plateform independent access to document element information. 
For the guidelines not to include this as the primary mechanism for assistive technology to access document element information there would need to be strong arguements on how other techniques which are also cross plateform could acheive the same results more efficently or with better representations of the information. 
Remember these guidelines must be approved by the W3C member companies and checkpoints that are not plateform independent or refer to proprietary technologies when other W3C exist may have difficulty getting their approal. 
Jon FYI - I'm evaluating the feasibility of making the DOM (or more specifically, Microsoft Dynamic HTML Object Model) a public interface. 
As I said in the previous teleconference, current methods of accessing the internal object model are unsupported. 
I'm worried about this proposal since it would (a) force browser manufactures to follow DOM (b) force browser manufactures to expose DOM directly. 
Currently Internet Explorer supports Active Accessibility, which provides some DOM-like information, tailored to the needs or accessibility aids. 
As soon I have more information, I'll pass it on.

Sent: Wednesday, January 27, 1999 3:12 PM Subject: RESOLUTION: Table access checkpoints for Desktop Graphical User Agents Tables Issue Resolution for Desktop Graphical User Agents The solution strategy for Desktop Graphical User Agents for making tables more accessible is for user agents to implement the Document Object Model (DOM) and provide an interface for assistive technology to access DOM. 
Assistive technology therefore would have direct access to table information for alternaive rendering in speech, Braille or enlarged text. 
Advantages to DOM approach 1. Assistive technology has direct access to element information and is not dependent on any filtering of information that occurs during graphical rendering of information. 
2. W3C recommendations exist for specifying implementation and conformance Potential Disadvantage of DOM approach 1. Technique needs to gain acceptance by assistive technology developers. 
So far this has not been a problem since Henter-Joyce, Productivity Works and Alva participants are either already using DOM or are interested in its capabilities. 
Primary checkpoints for Desktop Graphical User Agents to implement 1. Implement DOM level 1 2. Expose DOM level 1 to assistive technologies Checkpoint under consideration and refinement 1. Provide a means for the user to add accessibility functionality or change the rendering of a document using the scripting capabilities of the user agent Issues related to this checkpoint 1. Intent is provide some way for user to adjust rendering or add functionality for legacy assistive technology by using scripting tools already available in many desktop graphical user agent technologies. 
2. This is not a good checkpoint since it is too specific, but could be a technique for a more general checkpoint. 
3. This may be a good checkpoint if it was more general, but if it was more general it could probably be defined as an asssitive technology. 
It therefore would not need to exist. 4. There is a DOM2 working group defining user side scripting capability, need to coordinate with that group and see how this issue relates to the work of that group. 
Checkpoints related to native table linearization by desktop graphical user agents have been rejected based on the following information. 
Potetential Advantage of Linearization Approach 1. 
Current screen reader users would have somewhat better access to table information, but it is not a complete solution. 
Users would still need to wait for it to be implemented before they could benefit from the feature. 
Problems with linearization approach 1. Linearization is only one of many techniques in solving the table access problem, it doesn't meet the requirement for checkpoints stating a general user problem. 
It could be included as a technique in the technique document. 
2. It doesn't provide a path for innovation in solving table access issues and will become outdated as technology improves. 
3. Navigation and rendering are needed for a complete solution, which complicates the desktop graphical browser issue. 
4. None of the assistive technology vendors currently involved in the group have requested the inclusion of this feature. 
Their interest seems to be more in the area of DOM or accessibility APIs for access to tables. 
5. Mainstream browser developers have indicated that this feature is technically difficult to implement. 
It would take a long time for user agent developers to implement and therefore maybe obsolete before users would be able to benefit from the technique. 
If you have additional information that would change or extend this resoution please send it to the list as soon as possible for consideration by the group.

I still think the WG shuld say "Implement DOM Level 1" even if that doesn't solve the entire problem today. 
This would be one of the WG's choices that refers to future solutions, not legacy solutions. 
I agree that without exporting the DOM, its utility is reduced. 
I propose that we (again) invite someone from the DOM WG to enlighten us during a teleconf. 
- Ian Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org) 

I think most AT vendors would only need to read the DOM for alternative rendering. 
I think it would be a mistake for the guidelines to imply, suggestion or advocate the manipulation of the DOM to get sometype of visual rendering that is useful for reading information from the graphical rendering of the document. 
DOM manipulation would only be approapriate as an interim or short term solution until the AT could integrate the full model into their application. 
I agree with that statement. 
That might solve the reliability problem, but not the security issues. 
Which may not be a problem. 
I'm still investigating.
