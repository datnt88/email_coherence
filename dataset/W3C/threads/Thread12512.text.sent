As per my action item, here are the ATAG technique work items. 
Please volunteer for them on the list. 
If I've missed something, please post it to the list. 
More work: (1) - Update techniques for guideline 1 (consider how 1.1 should be organized if either the IBM software guidelines or the ISO document are adopted, review the rest, asking what needs to be dropped or added?) (2) - Update techniques for guideline 2 (review all checkpoints, asking what needs to be dropped or added?) (3) - Update techniques for guideline 3 (review reliance on WCAG numbering in 3.1, review the rest, asking what needs to be dropped or added?) = I WILL VOLUNTEERS FOR THIS ONE. 
(4) - Update techniques for guideline 4 (add techniques for 4.2 (4.3, a.k.a 4.X still does not have success criteria yet), review 4.1 and 4.4, asking what needs to be dropped or added?) (5) - Take a wide of the document. 
Is it well structured? 
Is it easy to use? 
What is missing? 
Less work: (6) - Update the references (Go through the document and adding or correcting references as necessary, update and repair the references page) (7) - Maintain the glossary (Ensure terms are up to date, keep synchronized with glossary in guidelines, both glossaries need to develop with an eye on other WAI and W3C glossaries) Jan Richards, User Interface Design Specialist Adaptive Technology Resource Centre (ATRC), University of Toronto Web: http://ultrajuan.ic.utoronto.ca/jan/richards.html 
I'd like to take item 5 and item 7. The way I work, 7 follows 5. I will look at stuff and invariably find the small, but important stuff that needs correcting and stuff. 
I think, too, that others will naturally come across small items that relate to what I am doing. 
In that case, they can just drop me a line and I will take care of it. 
What is the deadline on this? 2 weeks is slightly hairy!! regards, Karen Mardahl Teknisk Kommunikation www.mardahl.dk

Maybe I should take #1, since I'm doing the review of the ISO document anyway as an action item.
