Also had an action item to work on Acronyms and abbreviations 
Here is what I came to: 
I think the definition should be something like: 
Acronyms and abbreviations should be tied to a definition within the document 
to a definition externally. 
The method for this would be in technology specific techniques. 
We should also define a semantic markup technique for ambiguous words and it could be used for this as well. 
That would help solve problems with whether a word is a word or acronym or proper name etc. 
Semantic markup is going to be a big need for the future. 
We need to create standard methods for it. 
Perhaps this should be combined with other semantic markup into a single checkpoint with abvs and acronyms being one success criteria.

Time to go back to the drawing board. 
Did anybody bother to read that sentence? 
Take a second and read it now. 
All the way. 
See a problem there? 
More generally, why are WAI and WCAG WG poised to force authors to link every acronym and abbreviation in every document forever to glossaries, which may not exist at all? 
What HTML mechanism will be suggested for this technique? 
href is not an attribute of the abbr and acronym elements. 
(Don't bother talking 
about XHTML 2; it doesn't exist.) Why are WAI and WCAG WG obsessed with abbreviations and acronyms to the extent that they propose the most overzealous methods conceivable to deal with a very simple problem? 
We already have abbr and acronym markup that could be handled quite well by adaptive technology. 
The existing techniques have not been proven to be insufficient for actual people with disabilities, for the primary reason that nobody except the most conscientious standards-compliant authors even uses them. 
The proposal continues to assume the readers are unfamiliar with the subject-matter of the page and will be unaware of the abbreviations and acronyms used. 
In fact, many authors create pages for other people with similar expertise; they don't need abbreviations and acronyms spelled out for them, let alone linked to dictionaries that, I reiterate, may not actually exist. 
The thrust of WAI and WCAG WG's approach is to make two tiny components of a subset of the pages on the Web-- abbreviations and acronyms on the pages that use them-- understandable to every single reader. 
Question 1: Why, exactly? 
Who said that everybody had to understand every page, disabled or not? 
Question 2: Why pick on something small like abbreviations and acronyms?

Yes. It doesn't make sense. 
I suspect that the author's intention was to have an "or" after the word document. 
This suggestion (assuming I have correctly interpreted it) doesn't posit any links to things which don't exist. 
As I read it, it requires a link to a definition, which implies ensuring that the definition does, indeed, exist. 
To tie to a definition within a document one could use the HTML 4 technique of using the title attribute. 
In other languages there may be more powerful linking mechanisms. 
One could also use the approach of Annotea - with the additional advantage of allowing a third party to make a repair to a page that caused a problem, although the reliability of that repair potentially suffers as a result. 
As Gregg says below, there are different approaches for different languages - HTML is still important to the Web, but there are a lot of XML languages (and some pseudo-XML ones) around... 
(Don't bother talking about XHTML 2; it doesn't exist.) 
Well, in the sense that WCAG 2 doesn't exist. 
If one assumes that at some point WCAG 2 will exist, it seems reasonable, on the same grounds, to believe XHTML 2 will as well - indeed there are drafts showing what it might look like, browsers showing how it might work, andd people working busily to bring that process to its conclusion so that it will exist. 
Apparently some authors will not understand relatively simple propositions, and use their misunderstanding to argue about hypothetical situations which have in fact been ruled out. 
It seems plausible that misunderstandings could also arise between authors, who make assumptions about their (unknown) readers' familiarity with an arbitrary number of Tlas, and indeed (as people have pointed out in relation to the overall use of language) other forms of expression that can lead to confusion. 
It seems to me, (as an interested observer) that in fact the thrust is to explain how an author can ensure (should they so choose) that their pages as a whole are understandable. 
One smalll facet of this is reducing the confusion about locally understood terms which are not common to the entire readership. 
I don't think anyone did. 
I believe the group is working on explaining what needs to be done to ensure that they can, if the author so desires. 
There are some cognitive conditions such as semantic pragmatic disorder which mean the people who happen to have them cannot effectively understand anything but the most literal and concrete explanations - they have great difficulty in generalising a principle from an example. 
A useful approach to help such people is to pick out all the specific examples that a principle implies. 
And in this case, abbreviations and acronyms are two specific examples of the more general principle that Gregg was alluding to.

Time to go back to the drawing board. 
Did anybody bother to read that sentence? 
Take a second and read it now. 
All the way. 
GV: The work "or" was unintentionally omitted. 
Sincere apologies. 
See a problem there? 
More generally, why are WAI and WCAG WG poised to force authors to link every acronym and abbreviation in every document forever to glossaries, which may not exist at all? 
GV: not sure if you meant "link" as in hyperlink - but if you read, 'tied' just meant that they all had a meaning that was findable. 
What HTML mechanism will be suggested for this technique? 
href is not an attribute of the abbr and acronym elements. 
(Don't bother talking about XHTML 2; it doesn't exist.) GV: this is not at the html specific level. 
And the whole discussion was not proposed as language for the guildelines - but as discussion. 
Exploration of ideas. 
Why are WAI and WCAG WG obsessed with abbreviations and acronyms to the extent that they propose the most overzealous methods conceivable to deal with a very simple problem? 
GV: Relax a bit. 
There is concern over them because the cause things to be hard to understand for many readers - including those who are not disabled. 
We already have abbr and acronym markup that could be handled quite well by adaptive technology. 
The existing techniques have not been proven to be insufficient for actual people with disabilities, for the primary reason that nobody except the most conscientious standards-compliant authors even uses them. 
GV: Where they work - they are fine - and no one is suggesting they not be used. 
Where they do not - it is a problem. 
Also it is a lot of work. 
We have been trying to see if there are things that are easier to do as well. 
Again - the email was not proposed language. 
It was text to help explore the topic. 
Also obsessions usually dominate a persons attention. 
This is just one of a long list of things being discussed. 
Where we don't have good solutions, we discuss them more to see if something will pop out. 
As to - why we don't just cite HTML markup -- HTML solutions or language are reserved for the technology specific guidelines. 
In the main guidelines we would talk about what needs to be done in ways that are not technology specific.

The proposal continues to assume the readers are unfamiliar with the subject-matter of the page and will be unaware of the abbreviations and acronyms used. 
In fact, many authors create pages for other people with similar expertise; they don't need abbreviations and acronyms spelled out for them, let alone linked to dictionaries that, I reiterate, may not actually exist. 
GV: the purpose of this was to explore the idea of having definitions (formal and informal - ie created by the author) that could be found if the reader did not understand something. 
The thrust of WAI and WCAG WG's approach is to make two tiny components of a subset of the pages on the Web-- abbreviations and acronyms on the pages that use them-- understandable to every single reader. 
GV: Actually, if you read the thread, it was to make all information on the page understandable. 
Abbreviation and acronyms are just part of the problem. 
Question 1: Why, exactly? 
Who said that everybody had to understand every page, disabled or not? 
GV: No one. 
But the guideline - which is not required - is to help people understand what they can do if they WANT to do this. 
Question 2: Why pick on something small like abbreviations and acronyms? 
GV: See above. 
They are just part of a broader topic.
