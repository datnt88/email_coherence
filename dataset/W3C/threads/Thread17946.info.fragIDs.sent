<s> Checkpoint 10.6 Allow the user to configure the user agent in named profiles that may be shared on systems with distinct user accounts or shared by the same user portably across systems with the same operating system ?or  </s>
<s> do we propose such profiles could be made independent of operating system?.  </s>

<s> Yes, One example is using style sheets to carry configuration and preference information.  </s>
<s> These could actually reside on the WWW.  </s>

<s> For clarification, I propose changing the checkpoint to read: Allow the user to configure the user agent through profiles.  </s>
<s> And then to define profile as follows: A "profile" is a named and persistent representation of user preferences that may be used to configure a user agent.  </s>
<s> On systems with distinct user accounts, profiles enable users to reconfigure software quickly when they log on.  </s>
<s> Profiles may be shared with other users.  </s>
<s> Platform-independent profiles are useful for those who work in different environments (with the same user agent).  </s>
<s> The current text is: Allow the user to configure the user agent in named profiles that may be shared on systems with distinct user accounts.  </s>
<s> 1) I think calling them "named" profiles is unnecessary if having a name is part of the definition (I feel like Eric Hansen here!  </s>
<s> grin ). 2) I find the second half of the requirement confusing.  </s>
<s> What does is mean to require the user agent to allow sharing?  </s>
<s> I think it makes more sense if the definition explains the rationale behind profiles.  </s>
