<s> Discussing with Brian and others the proposal from WebOnt via Jim Hendler, raised: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2003JanMar/0335.html ...I would like to get some discussion going on the costs/benefits of finally moving away from the use of the name 'RDF Schema' for our vocabulary description language.  </s>
<s> The WebOnt comment is: i.  </s>
<s> Although this document is called RDF Schema we think that the title "RDF Vocabulary Description Language" would be clearer, and make the difference from XML Schema (used for validation) more evident.  </s>
<s> After talking this through with Brian, and prior discussions with Ivan Herman and others regarding the difficulty of presenting a coherent picture of the SemWeb technology stack, I am increasingly inclined (albeit warily) towards accepting the proposal from WebOnt.  </s>
<s> This would be a costly exercise, both for the WG and editors, but also in terms of those in the wider world who have invested time, energy and  </s>
<s> braincells on 'rdf schema' technology.  </s>
<s> Whatever we do will have costs.  </s>
<s> My  </s>
<s> change of mind is based on the view that making the move to drop 'schema' terminology now puts an immediate burden on the WG and editors (in our group and in OWL), but leaves us in a state where the future might be increasingly coherent as tutorials, tools, demos etc migrate away from the 'schema' terminology.  </s>
<s> If we stick with calling this thing 'schema', and we get to REC, we're stuck with it.  </s>
<s> But but but... what about other wgs?  </s>
<s> other w3c specs?  </s>
<s> other communities who are talking about their rdf vocabularies as 'rdf schemas'?  </s>
<s> If the terminology of 'rdf schema' were to simply vanish from the W3C RDF / SemWeb specs, we risk creating a whole lot more confusion, at least in the next year or two.  </s>
<s> So, put bluntly, I don't know what best to do.  </s>
<s> The current RDFS/DVL spec sits on the fence.  </s>
<s> We say that it is the RDF Vocabulary Description Language 1.0: RDF Schema.  </s>
<s> I wonder if the balancing act we are currently performing could be tweaked slightly, to encourage folk to think more in terms of vocabularies (and eventually ontologies) rather than schemas.  </s>
<s> Strategies we might consider include: * never using 'rdf schema' in noun form, ie avoiding talk of their being things that are 'rdf schemas' (while leaving it in as a _name_ for the basic rdf vocabulary description language defined by w3c, just as OWL is the name for W3C's 2nd RDF-based VDL).  </s>
<s> * Encourage OWL spec editors to use the terminology of 'vocabulary description' as a way of providing a conceptual bridge between the work of our specs and in the OWL specs * Accompany this with outreach efforts to help RDF early adopters (esp vocab creators) explain this transition.  </s>
<s> We could do this through RDF IG and other outreach efforts, ie needn't be a work item for RDF Core.  </s>
<s> Having typed this I'm feeling happier that there is a middle path, where 'schema' doesn't entirely dissapear from the spec, but we accelerate its phase-out by more explicitly moving to 'vocab' based terminology.  </s>
<s> Dan  </s>
<s> Dan-- I've no problem with the idea of a name change as suggested by WebONT (and am prepared to grit my teeth and make all the Primer changes), but I don't especially like the specific change being contemplated, because it seems to ignore some practical issues.  </s>
<s> The following are some considerations I think are important in any resolution of this business: 1.  </s>
<s> It is *mandatory* in my opinion for there to be a *short* way of writing (a) the name of the language itself, and (b) the things written  </s>
<s> in the language.  </s>
<s> "RDF schema" passes those tests.  </s>
<s> "RDF Vocabulary  </s>
<s> Description Language" fails the (a) test, and "vocabulary description" (or "RDF vocabulary description") fails the (b) test (not by a whole lot, but it does).  </s>
<s> WebONT has "OWL" for (a) and "ontology" for (b).  </s>
<s> We need something similarly short, unless we expect no one to actually use this language, instead jumping directly to OWL (and if what we're talking about substituting for the thing described isn't an "ontology", if only a very impoverished one, we need a clear understanding of what it takes to qualify as an "ontology" versus whatever it is we're defining).  </s>
<s> (NB: "VDL" has been used already for something else.) 2. I don't really care for encouraging the OWL editors to talk about "vocabulary description" without some additional amplification of what that means.  </s>
<s> Our Semantics document talks about a vocabulary being a collection of URIrefs used in RDF graphs, and it seems to me any RDF that provides information about those URIrefs (by using them as subjects in RDF statements) "describes" that vocabulary, whether it uses the RDFS vocabulary or not.  </s>
<s> So "vocabulary description" in this context has a particular meaning that I'd like to see elaborated a bit.  </s>
<s> 3. If we're going to change either the name of the language, or the thing described by the language, or both, I really have a problem keeping the old namespace with "rdf-schema" in it.  </s>
<s> I know that these are supposed to be opaque identifiers, but that text isn't opaque enough for this purpose.  </s>

<s> The phrase "XML schema" refers to a arrangement of and relationship between syntactic elements.  </s>
<s> I think the term "RDF schema" is equally valid to refer to some relationships between semantic elements in RDF.  </s>
<s> In summary, I think the use of the phrase "XML schema" is not a valid reason to abandon the phrase "RDF schema".  </s>
<s> Maybe there are other reasons to prefer a different phrase to "RDF schema", but I don't think legitimate re-use of the word "schema" is one such.  </s>

<s> I regret the use of the emotive term 'bullied'.  </s>
<s> I see no evidence of the XML schema folks putting any pressure on us about the use of this term.  </s>
<s> I have however observed a tendency from folks, and not just those from the XML world, to assume that a schema language supports validation and this can cause some confusion.  </s>
<s> Personally, whilst I can see advantage to a name change, I think its too late, but as always, will be guided by the wisdom of the WG.  </s>

<s> I don't think it was the XML schema folks who were being thought of as doing the bullying.  </s>
<s> RDF schema *supports* validation.  </s>
<s> The problem is that it doesn't *mandate* that is has to be used for validation.  </s>
<s> That's left up to what the application wants to do with it (there's a section in the Primer trying to explain this).  </s>
<s> Part of the problem with any reasonable name change is that it probably won't indicate that the language doesn't necessarily entail validation any more clearly than "RDF schema" does.  </s>
<s> Certainly when people look at domains and ranges in "RDF Vocabulary Description Language", unless they read the fine print very carefully, I'd bet they'll continue to believe that those domains and ranges are necessarily interpreted as constraints (and I bet the OWL folks are going to have the same problem).  </s>
<s> I haven't heard any proposals for renaming the language to something "real clear" like "The RDF Vocabulary Description, but Not-Necessarily Constraining or Used for Validation, Language", but anyway about all this would do is make for a more-opaque namespace name: --Frank Frank Manola The MITRE Corporation 202 Burlington Road, MS A345 Bedford, MA 01730-1420  </s>
