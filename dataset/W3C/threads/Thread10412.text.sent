The closure rules for RDF are incomplete. 
There are XML documents without an enclosing language tag that have the same canonical form as XML documents with and enclosing language tag. 
This means that the RDF entailment lemma is false. 
This comment is correct and the error will be corrected. 
The new closure rule will simply state FROM xxx aaa lll . 
where lll is a well-formed XML typed literal . 
INFER xxx aaa mmm . 
where mmm is a well-formed XML typed literal with the same canonical form as lll. 
where 'canonical form' is defined explicitly using the construction in the Concepts document. 
I would also like to add prose like this: "In rule rdf2, 'same canonical form' should be interpreted so as to take into account any language tags which may be present. 
For example, this rule will sanction the following inference: ex:sub ex:prop " rdf lang="fr" word chat /word /rdf "^^rdf:XMLLiteral . 
- ex:sub ex:prop " word chat /word "@fr^^rdf:XMLLiteral . 
Any objections/ comments?

Subject: response to comment pfps-04 Date: Mon, 3 Feb 2003 17:03:42 -0600 I don't believe that this works. 
Well, it appears to me that there needs to be more work in making sure that the treatment of XMLLiteral is the same in Syntax, Concepts, and Semantics. 
Right now, it appears to me that there are differences. 
peter To RDF Core WG members: Messages from me with these subject lines which are directed to Peter and CCd to the WG are NOT official WG responses or dispositions. 
Think of them as a private conversation between Peter and me (at this stage) which I am CCing to the WG for information purposes only, and as possible material for WG discussions of how to produce an appropriate disposition. 
-Pat I agree, and will try to get this fixed. 
To the fullest extent possible, I propose to remove all XML-related definitions, structures, etc. from the semantics document and simply refer to the Concepts document, using terminology defined there. 
And if I do use any examples (like the above, which I now see doesn't work) I will get Jeremy or Graham to write them for me.
