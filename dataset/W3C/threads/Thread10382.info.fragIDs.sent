<s> Argh! I hope the Primer isn't misleading on this question, because I don't think your last sentence is accurate.  </s>
<s> What I try to say is that rdf:ID provides a way of indicating that, in addition to generating the usual triple, a reification of that triple with a specific URIref (generated from the rdf:ID value) is to be generated as well.  </s>
<s> It doesn't (I don't think) "attach a URI reference to a triple in an RDF/XML document".  </s>

<s> Well, isn't that attachment done by the fact of the URI appearing in the rdf:ID in the document in question?  </s>
<s> But OK, I could rephrase it thus:  </s>
<s> (In the RDF/XML syntax described in RDF/XML Syntax Specification (Revised) [RDF-SYNTAX] the use of rdf:Id with a URI reference as value creates a reification of the enclosed triple, with that URI reference as the reified triple.) Would that be better?  </s>

<s> What I'm getting at is what I say later in the Primer reification section: "Using rdf:ID as shown in Example 20 generates the reification automatically, and provides a convenient way of indicating the URIref to be used as the subject of the statements in the reification.  </s>
<s> Moreover, it provides a partial "hook" relating the triples in the reification with the piece of RDF/XML syntax that caused them to be created, since the value triple12345 of the rdf:ID attribute is used to generate the URIref of the subject of the reification triples.  </s>
<s> However, this relationship is once again outside RDF, since there is nothing in the resulting triples that explicitly says that the original triple had the URIref exproducts:triple12345 (RDF does not assume there is any relationship between a URIref and any RDF/XML that it might have been  </s>
<s> used or abbreviated in)."  </s>
<s> That is, if you look at the graph (Figure 17), there's nothing that connects the triple described by the RDF/XML ("the enclosed triple") to the URIref used in the reification triples (generated from the rdf:ID attribute value).  </s>
<s> So there's sort of an "attachment" between the generated graph and some RDF/XML, but the interpretation of that attachment is still strictly outside of RDF.  </s>
<s> I just wouldn't want anyone to interpret this parenthetical remark (whatever text it contains) as an exception to or qualification of the original statement that there isn't really a connection defined by RDF.  </s>
<s> This would be an application-dependent convention that related (in a specific way) the resulting graph to the RDF/XML used to generate it; and this information wouldn't necessarily be available to a second party receiving the graph.  </s>
<s> NB: "rdf:Id with a URI reference as value" isn't strictly accurate either.  </s>
<s> rdf:ID ("ID" in caps) doesn't take a URIref as a value; its value is used (as a fragment id) to *construct* a URIref.  </s>

<s> OK, how about this: In the RDF/XML syntax described in RDF/XML Syntax Specification (Revised) [RDF-SYNTAX] the use of rdf:ID creates a reification of the enclosed triple in which the reified triple is a URI constructed from the baseURI of the XML document and the value of rdf:ID as a fragID.  </s>
