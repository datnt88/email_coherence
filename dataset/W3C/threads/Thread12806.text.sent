The mind is boggled! 
The link to How to Retrofit begs for a pointer to a collaborative paper (Gregory and Kelly Ford?) about retrofitting from a hands-on perspective even using the simplistic thing GR did for Canaday's site? 
The "back" button sure gets a lot of use. 
I don't know if all browsers have a pull-down for "back" that precludes multiple "back" pushes since often one is 4 or five deep when hyperlinking becomes addictive. 
If one is to work on the whole document, it with *all* associated stuff should be in one downloadable folder although if the link addresses are complete this won't be necessary. 
It's just not fun to have to find the style sheets if they aren't referenced externally. 
Love. 
ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE Please be clearer: again, good, bad, improvements? 
I don't know what you mean by "the mind is boggled." 
Nor would I assume that it translates well, for people who are following this in other than their first language. 
Do you have the link for this? 
And what about what we've said earlier in EOWG discussions, where we've said that in formal "WAI Resources" we wanted to maximize on-site (on W3C-site) links where we had some assurance of stable URI's? 
(You were one of the main proponents of this, as I recall). 
For this training resource, however, seems like there should be some off-site links; maybe we should differentiate those. 
Not sure what you mean here; are you saying that the document set is indeed too layered now, as Sheela was suggesting might happen, so that you're having to jump back and forth too many times between pages? 
Or are you saying something else? 
Good point: once done, we can package this so it's available in the various zip and other packages that we make available for W3C specs (although those don't always zip the images and style sheets correctly, though they should).

WL: By a "boggled mind" I mean that you have gone from some beginning notes to a full-fleshed, incredibly already usable, impressive entity in what seems like a short time while still appearing before a sub-committee, attending more teleconferences, and replying to more email and interview requests than I could have even when in full possession of my faculties. 
Midn-boggling was in this case congratulatory. 
JB:: "Do you have the link for this?[retrofitting paper] WL: I think I was trying to suggest creation of a "retrofit how-to" by those who've done a LOT of retrofitting. 
We often comment on how difficult this is and such a resource would argue on both sides of that question. 
Retrofitting a site with a million PDF files will be lots harder than adding a few dozen ALTs, etc. 
But a recount of the details involved in a typical effort might be inspirational for some Webmasters who would be daunted by the entire "How to Make an Accessible Site" training course. 
JB:: "Not sure what you mean here [back button wear]. 
WL: I go down four levels from the document I'm reading and want to go back to what started this off - I must hit back and (in my case of slow uploads) wait a long time for each preceding link to reload, hit back again, etc. 
Sometimes the back button shows a pull-down from which I can skip some steps and I don't know if that's a universal feature of all browsers and if it always works - it's slow and erratic like tooltips. 
JB:: "are you saying that the document set is indeed too layered now" WL: Exactly the opposite. 
I think the power of the Web and an important aspect that this document can illustrate is in the proliferation of easily used inline hyperlinks. 
I suggest that making hyperlinking addictive we will hasten the "everything" part of "everyone, everything connected". 
Skipping footnotes, etc. will speed reading and in the process make, e.g. everything pertaining to everything available from everything, if you take my meaning. 
I can start off reading about making my site accessible and wind up learning about Wittgenstein and Punk Rock and somebody else winds up discovering that there's water under the surface of Mars. 
To be more specific about the instant issue: more links from the central document and lots of "central documents". 
The current one is starting well and as I go through it I will make more specific suggestions - it would just be nice to be able to actually test them in a "scratchpad space" of my own rather than just talking about them. 
This would allow me to be more specific and avoid Charles' chastisement about how easy it is to "talk the talk" but let's have some specific language, etc. - with which I fully agree. 
QuickTips didn't have this problem because a suggestion was specific language: you couldn't get away with "let's just terserize the guidelines". 
Generalities become specifics when one must test on one's own version of a document what one proposes. 
Len has suggestions for a tool - he writes one. 
I think a path should be explored - put my keyboard where my mouth is. 
Group authoring can't be done on a single master copy and without the experience of testing ideas on one's own the input will be as vague as that about which you query me when (if) I suggest "improvements". 
Instead of "try this" (to some editor) - "I tried this and you can see it at..." Chuck had slides to work with and it's clear that access to them couldn't be manifold but the feedback/modification process might be improved if those making suggestions were enabled/forced to test them - hence the idea of having my own copy of the entire thing to jack with. 
Love. 
ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE JB: Gee, thanks grin . 
I thought I was going too slowly... JB: I think we do need a "how to retrofit" page (and remember that at a previous call I'd mentioned that a few major corporations may be ready to write up their experiences on that, and I'm sure we could get some smaller organizations to as well.) Actually, working with this set of "planning a training" pages has made me feel that we should revisit the "Getting Started: Making A Web Site Accessible" page http://www.w3.org/WAI/gettingstarted , and turn that into a similar set. 
There is too much information on one page right now; some of it really needs to be developed more (including the part about how to do an informal evaluation of your own site, but then that also relates to our "process for reviewing Web pages" document that we need to move along as well). 
I'm thinking that eventually, we'll end up with sets or clusters of pages on various topics, with a grand central station for an overview of the resources, and some audience-tailored entry points to the WAI site. 
JB: I was trying to avoid that in the set-up. 
Suggestions on how to minimize it? 
JB: Hmmm. 
I made the pages as compact, file-size-wise, as I could. 
I'm curious what your bandwidth is? 
JB: I don't see that feature in Opera or Navigator. 
JB: For now, how about grabbing: Then you can experiment with those. 
We may have a zip package available later today, but not sure.

[multiple back button pushes] WL: Although a case-by-case study might be revelatory (does one link to a section of a page which is just yet another link to get anything meaningful?) it won't matter much in this case because everything is fairly quick - and will be really quick this time next year in all probability. 
JB:: "I made the pages as compact, file-size-wise, as I could. 
I'm curious what your bandwidth is?" WL: The reference to back button delays actually isn't very germane here because we're dealing with small loads but the real problem at my end is that I live at the end of five miles of noisy copper, an RF relay across the Columbia River, a telephone junction box on Hwy. 97 which usually has a Sprint repair truck parked near it, a Goldendale modem bank with... you get the idea. 
Don't be diverted from lots of layers, they are A GOOD THING. 
I will "grab" the files you pointed to and try to do something useful. 
I probably won't have much to report for a while, but I still think it's an important exercise and would urge all members to consider doing so. 
Talking about all this so much is fine but at some point, it's important that someone besides Judy, Charles, Ian, Wendy, and the usual suspects DO something useful. 
Love. 
ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE JB: Set your browser to deliver the pages from cache once you have initially downloaded them, e.g. by setting your cache preferences to "don't check for modifications every time" or some such (depends on the browser).
