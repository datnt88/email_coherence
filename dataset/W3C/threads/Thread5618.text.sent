Hey, Wouldn't it be better to put effort into getting rid of the craziness we call "software patents" instead of finding a solution working around something (web plugins) that's considered a basic idea based on common sense ? 
Afterall, there's no guarantee that it stops here and there is so much more at stake than just web plugins.

http://dag.wieers.com/ -- [Any errors in spelling, tact or fact are transmission errors] Many would like that, but it is well beyond the reach of the W3C to make such decisions. 
So in the meantime, finding solutions is likely the best way to go. 
And hey, plugins are the Web's plague anyway. 
If they go away this will in fact be a very good thing to come out of the sorry state patent laws are in. 
Mixed namespaces, XML Packaging, and a proper way to wrap it all together... hmmm, the Web at large might become an interesting place again :) Robin Berjon robin.berjon@expway.fr

While this is certainly and exciting vision, it presumes that all formats are represented in XML - but there are currently no XML formats for compressed video and audio. 
Also, one of the strengths of the Web is that it is able to integrate any format. 
-Philipp Hoschka I understand the issues, which is why the list went beyond just mixed namespaces. 
Also, I seemed to understand that it would be ok to embed content so long as the program wasn't controlled, is that correct? 
Is there any assesment of how direct the control ought to be (since simply loading is already a form of control)? 
Would changes in the *container's* SMIL timeline, affecting the timeline of AV content indirectly, count as interaction?

XML Packaging (at least in its multipart MIME incarnation) won't exactly be streaming multimedia. 
Also, receiving a video and and audio source at the same time seems impossible. 
I don't want to speculate on this - and was more thinking of audio/video plugins for HTML, which seem to be most affected by any change at this point. 
I was more considering possible future work in XML Packaging, taking multiplexed streaming as if it were a single document. 
I guess my broader point is that if this is a historical occasion to get rid of plugins for good, then I'd much rather see the W3C jump on it than try to save the plugin way of doing it. 
Surprisingly enough, I didn't quite expect to solve the issue with a ten word sentence comprised of three bullet points... 
I do however believe that there mixed namespaces and XML Packaging are avenues to be explored seriously. 
With XHTML+SVG+SMIL+XForms in a mixed namespaces implementation, the vast majority of the current Web can be expressed, with gains in functionality and pretty much only AV content as the loss. 
Isn't it worth discussing it as an 80/20 solution, while we come up with solutions to the harder problems of streamed media and see how a streamed binary payload and XML documents can be made to be a single document (and hopefully not fall under the patent, as is the case with the data: URI)?
