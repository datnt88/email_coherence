<s> The following comments are divided up into substantial and editorial comments (editorial last).  </s>
<s> --- owlsas-rdfcore-datatype-denotation  </s>
<s> Section 2.1 "In OWL, as in RDF, a datatype denotes the set of data values that is the value space for the datatype."  </s>
<s> - Not true of RDF?  </s>
<s> A datatype can be treated as a class in RDF - the class corresponds to its value space, but not the same thing.  </s>
<s> Strike "as in RDF"  </s>
<s> --- owlsas-rdfcore-equvalent-class 2.3.2.1 BNF for axiom  </s>
<s> 'EquivalentClasses(' description { description } ')'  </s>
<s> Other 'equivalentX' productions specify a minimum of two equivalent Xs.  </s>
<s> The reason for this production is nonobvious and should be spelled out.  </s>
<s> We also note that the rule given in section 3.3 does not cover the (semantically empty) case of n=1 for the EquivalentClasses(d1 ... dn) production.  </s>
<s> --- owlsas-rdfcore-owl-vocabulary  </s>
<s> Section 3.1 Definition of OWL Vocabulary (Clarification sought) I may have misunderstood, but shouldn't "rdf:type" be excluded from the definitions of the various "V_x"s ?  </s>
<s> --- owlsas-rdfcore-unnamed-ontologies  </s>
<s> Section 3.4 Unnamed ontologies: informally, multiple Annontations on an unnamed  </s>
<s> ontology don't need to be satisfied by the same "x" according to this table.  </s>
<s> Don't think that's right.  </s>
<s> --- owlsas-rdfcore-ontology-component-association Section 4.1 While the abstract syntax naturally associates (via syntactic nesting) ontologies with all their directives, no such association is made in the RDF graph expression of the ontology (apart from Annotations).  </s>
<s> Therefore, multiple ontologies expressed as an RDF graph cannot be extracted to produce the component ontologies in the abstract syntax.  </s>
<s> --- owlsas-rdfcore-rdf-translation-opaque Section 4.1  </s>
<s> From a presentation point of view, the translation table in 4.1 seems  </s>
<s> overly opaque.  </s>
<s> However, an alternative compact expression of the translation into RDF Graph form is not immediately obvious.  </s>
<s> The following comments are all editorial: since they are trivial, no IDs have been assigned.  </s>
<s> In general, the presentation of the BNF for the abstract syntax is very well done; the "literate" style is to be commended.  </s>
<s> Section 2.2 "The second kind of fact is used to make individual identifiers be the same or pairwise distinct."  </s>
<s> Nit - same/distinct denotations?  </s>
<s> 2.3 Axioms [editorial] WG - working group; don't hyphenate "more-neutral"  </s>
<s> 2.3.1.3 [editorial] "The only information in axiom for them is annotations."  </s>
<s> Insert "the".  </s>
<s> 2.3.1.3 &amp; throughout [editorial] suggest "dataValuedPropertyID" and "individualValuedPropertyID" (different intercapping)  </s>
<s> 2.3.2.3 Para 1. [editorial] "As well," suggest "In addition," instead.  </s>
<s> 3.1 Definition of datatype theory [editorial] stumbled over the parenthetical "(non-disjoint)" - is it necessary?  </s>
<s> Would suggest to strike.  </s>
<s> 3.1 [editorial, accessibility] This is a nit, but when I first viewed this document, the "I"s and "l"s were indistinguishable.  </s>
<s> Maybe italicise the "l"?  </s>
<s> 3.2 and elsewhere [nit] It may be in standard use, in which case ignore this comment, but the terminology 'oneOf' for sets of singletons doesn't seem to express (when read informally in Engligh) its intended behaviour.  </s>
<s> If it's not too late would replace with 'singletons' or some other term.  </s>
<s> 3.2 [nit] restriction(p x_1 ... x_n) Suddest adding ", for n  1" since n=1 cases are dealt with below this.  </s>
<s> 4. [typo] "abstarct" in the first para.  </s>
<s> 5.1 and throughout [editorial, nit++] inconsistent capitalisation rules applied to headings.  </s>
<s> Would capitalise "Universe" here.  </s>
<s> This barely qualifies as a comment, apologies.  </s>
<s> 5.2, the "Note".  </s>
<s> The term "constructor" is not defined in the document and is only used in one other place.  </s>
<s> Some additional comments from RDFCore are to be supplied by Brian McBride shortly.  </s>
<s> [ Proposed reply to Thank you for your detailed comments.  </s>
<s> Here is a reply that handles most of them, and defers one until more work is performed.  </s>
<s> Let us know if this is sufficient for now.  </s>
<s> Yes, not really true of RDF.  </s>
<s> I will remove this phrase.  </s>
<s> I will add In OWL DL it is permitted to have only one description in an span class="syntax" EquivalentClasses /span construct.  </s>
<s> This allows ontologies to include descriptions that are not connected to anything, which is not semantically useful, but makes allowances for less-than-optimal editing of ontologies.  </s>
<s> Actually it does.  </s>
<s> The translation would just be the translation of d1.  </s>
<s> In this section there is no need to exclude the RDF or RDFS vocabulary.  </s>
<s> The next section does all the exclusion (see disallowed vocabulary from RDF, for example).  </s>
<s> Correct.  </s>
<s> It is not right.  </s>
<s> Fixing it will require some surgery to Section 3.4.  </s>
<s> This may need further discussion in the working group.  </s>
<s> Yes. This is the case.  </s>
<s> However, in the absence of a mechanism for making associations between RDF resources and RDF statements it is not possible to do this.  </s>
<s> Agreed.  </s>
<s> Thanks.  </s>
<s> This would be more precise, but I don't think that it would be any more readable.  </s>
<s> Changed.  </s>
<s> Changed instead to ``axioms''.  </s>
<s> The intercapping was chosen to alude to ``data-valued property ID'' instead of ``data valued property ID''.  </s>
<s> Good change.  </s>
<s> This probably was a holdover from something that talked about XML Schema datatypes and is no longer useful.  </s>
<s> It is removed.  </s>
<s> Changed to ``v''.  </s>
<s> This would require a substantive change.  </s>
<s> ^^ gg [nit] Actually, using this for n=1 is benign, and thus I can treat the clarification addition as an editorial change.  </s>
<s> Fixed.  </s>
<s> Fixed. :-)  </s>
<s> ... and the other use is not very good.  </s>
<s> I've changed the other use to ``and restrictions''.  </s>
<s> I've changed this to ``construct descriptions''.  </s>
<s> Please reply as to whether the proposed changes are acceptable.  </s>
<s> We will let you know when the one outstanding comment has been discussed.  </s>

<s> Here is a reply for the unanswered issue in your message.  </s>
<s> The newest editor's draft of S&amp;AS (of 4 June 2003, available at that should satisfactorily address this issue.  </s>
<s> The basic change is that the interpretation of Ontology Annotations is done in an environment where there is a resource for the ontology, named or not as evidenced by the following wording: there is some o &amp;isin; R such that for each Ontology Annotation of the form span class="syntax" Annotation( /span p v span class="syntax" ) /span , o,S(v) &amp;isin; ER(p) and that if O has name n, then S(n) = o; Please reply to this message as to whether this response is satisfactory, copying public-webont-wg@w3.org.  </s>
