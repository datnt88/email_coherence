The new checklink doc page has been online since validator 0.6.0 was installed to validator.w3.org. 
Could someone make the old doc page, http://www.w3.org/2000/07/checklink redirect to http://validator.w3.org/docs/checklink.html ? 
I think redirect is needed because the new page has some relative links that wouldn't work with proxying. 
TIA, \/ille Skytt? 
ville.skytta at iki.fi Speaking of redirects, we'll need a redirect from /favlets.html to /favelets.html on v.w3.org when we update to 0.6.1.

Done with a 302. 
Just ping me if you'd prefer a 301.
