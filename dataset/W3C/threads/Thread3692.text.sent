Folks: I have incorporated a few more comments, plus a couple of edits of my own, into Tex's last version. 
Please send any additional comments today, as I will send this out tomorrow (Saturday, Pacific time). 
Thanks, everyone, for your help in getting this first draft posted, especially Martin for shepherding the draft through the process. 
Addison The Web Services Task Force of the W3C Internationalization Working Group is pleased to announce the publication of the first "Web Services Internationalization Usage Scenarios" Working Draft at http://www.w3.org/TR/ws-i18n-scenarios. The goal of this document is to gather together scenarios for using Web services standards and technologies in ways that require attention to language, culture, and internationalization. 
This will help us to: o create "best practices" and tutorial information for Web service implementers and technology providers o propose standards for Web services and related technologies to support international operation o demonstrate international issues in existing Web services technologies and standards to the groups responsible for their development and maintenance We invite you to contribute additional Usage Scenarios that document aspects of Web Services internationalization that are not yet covered by this document or that extend the examples given. 
To contribute, please use a format similar to the one used in this document, and send your contribution to the www-i18n-comments@w3.org mailing list (publicly archived). 
Please use [Web Services] or [WSUS] in the subject. 
Please do not send proprietary material or information. 
We also invite you to join this Task Force. 
Members of the Task Force will have the opportunity to influence the internationalization of Web services standards as they evolve. 
You may also wish to join our public mailing list (public-i18n-ws@w3.org). 
Instructions on joining the Task Force and mailing list are located on our home page, located here: http://www.w3.org/International/ws. 
Best Regards, Addison Addison P. Phillips Director, Globalization Architecture webMethods, Inc. Internationalization is an architecture. 
It is not a feature. 
Chair, W3C-I18N-WG Web Services Task Force To participate see http://www.w3.org/International/ws 
I like the edits, it looks very good now. 
Thanks for your continued work on it. 
The one tiny, tiny, suggestion I have is to replace "This will help us to:" with: "This information will be the basis for us to:" In any event, it is shippable!

Making e-Business Work Around the World Hello Addison, A few more detail comments. 
Please go ahead and send out the announcement tomorrow. 
Maybe better to (also) give the exact address: 'gather together' sounds like double duty. 
just 'gather' should be enough. 
Apart from that, I think all the details are perfect in this sentence, but when I read it, I got stuck, it seems to be too long. 
After reading a few times, I think the main problem is that 'for using' and 'in ways that' are too far apart. 
What about: The goal of this document is to gather scenarios for Web services standards and technologies when used in ways that require attention to language, culture, and internationalization. could be a good idea to give the address of the public archive: Regards, Martin. 
Hi Martin, Thanks for the comments. 
I'll include the link into the final version I send out tomorrow. 
I think that the sentence you point out is too long, as you say. 
However, I think that the English doesn't read naturally (to me) in your version. 
How about this: ways that require attention to language, culture, and internationalization. thanks, Addison Perhaps: The goal of this document is to identify scenarios using Web services that require attention to language, culture, or internationalization. 
Note I changed "and internationalization" to "or...". 
Another possibility instead of "identify" is "enumerate". 
Just suggestions. 
Your call.
