<s> Hi there!  </s>
<s> I just had an idea how traffic on the web could be dramatically reduced.  </s>
<s> May be that it is already implemented in some way and I just do not know about it.  </s>
<s> Now the idea: Integrate a request command to http which will be replied by the hash of the page only.  </s>
<s> Based on this information the webbrowser or proxy could decide whether it needs to download the whole page or not.  </s>
<s> Moreover a html tag could indicate pseudo-new information like timestamps and make this hash even more effective.  </s>
<s> That's it.  </s>
<s> Little idea, lot of work and great improvement (at least I assume that, otherwise I would not bother anybody with it).  </s>
<s> Thanks for your time and I would be glad to get some comments on that.  </s>
<s> Bye Tim  </s>

<s> especially section 7. We've been working on a more complete paper about this idea, but it's been a spare-time activity and neither of us has had enough spare time.  </s>
<s> RFC 2616, section 14.19 Nope, this doesn't solve the aliasing problem.  </s>
<s> And if you reply "RFC 2616, section 14.15" then I would rebut with "RFC 3230".  </s>

<s> Hi :-) Thanks for your replies.  </s>
<s> It will take me some time to read and understand all the stuff you mentioned.  </s>
<s> Up to now I only quickly went over the TOC's and from that I am not sure if it really is what I meant.  </s>
<s> The pdf linked by Jeffrey gets pretty close to it but as I said before, I am not yet sure.  </s>
<s> I will get back to it at latest after finishing my exams for this semester.  </s>

<s> Dont we have "Modified-Since" and "Etags" to do this job already ?  </s>

<s> Dont we have "Modified-Since" and "Etags" to do this job already ?  </s>
<s> What will "hash" do extra which is not being done currently by the above mentioned two mechanisms ?? The existing mechanisms don't solve the problem of "aliasing" where two different URLs point to the same content, and a related problem where a given URL yields content in a sequence like A B C A These two effects can cause redundant content transfer (that is, a hypothetical perfect cache could avoid these transfers).  </s>
<s> We found that these two effects together, in one large trace, caused about 36% of the bytes transferred to be "redundant" in this sense.  </s>
<s> See the WWW 2002 paper I've already cited.  </s>
<s> -Jeff  </s>
<s> And how much would compression reduce the data transfered?  </s>
<s> Not mutually exclusive, I know, but a solution to the issue you describe would be quite complex to implement, compression would be pretty straight forward and I suspect reduce bytes transfered by more than the 36% redundancy.  </s>

<s> Good question.  </s>
<s> We couldn't answer it directly, because our traces don't include the actual contents, and so we couldn't compress the data to see what would happen with compression.  </s>
<s> However, indirect evidence suggests that adding HTTP-level compression wouldn't change the results very much, because most of the bytes (and especially most of the redundant bytes) were in image formats that are already compressed.  </s>
<s> Your trace may vary ... -Jeff  </s>
<s> We've done something related to this with the "HTTP Extensions for a Content-Addressable Web" protocols.  </s>
