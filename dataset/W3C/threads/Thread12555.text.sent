Is there a benefit to be able to link from any slide to the Table-of-Contents slide for all the different sets (Introduction, Guidelines, Checkpoints, Examples) as is allowed in the current button bar near the bottom of each slide? 
If yes, should this bar remain near the bottom of the page? 
Also if yes, would it be useful to have a link to the current Table-of-Contents up with the previous/next page buttons at the top? 
(This could be either a similar sized button between the previous/next page buttons or an unobtrusive bar directly under the previous/next buttons) If no, would it be sufficient to just have a link on each slide to the Table-of-Contents of its own set?

CL:: "Is there a benefit to be able to link from any slide to the Table-of-Contents..." WL: One thing to keep in mind when you propose modifications of the navigation scheme is "what use is being made of the set?" 
This group may not be the best place to find the answer to your question because the use we are making at this time is to check it out more than to actually use it. 
Were I using it as a sort of "programmed training" tool I might want to go: GLTOC -- GL#n -- CP#n.n -- CP#n.(n+1) until through with the CPs (which is not clear except by overreaching and getting to CP#(n+1).1) for that GL, thence back (through the GLTOC) to another (probably the next) GL, etc. 
So one question is whether the checkpoint slides have an indication of whether there are any more checkpoints for a particular GL, possibly even eschewing the capability of going from, say CPn.(last) -- CP(n+1).(first) since that will be a new topic and may not fit in with the intent of the "program". 
OTOH if I were to use it as a sort of "running reference" I might prefer to be leaping about more, thus want to go to the GLTOC without having read the current slide, thus choosing a navigation system in which I could use an arrow rather than the bar at the bottom. 
My general feeling is that the "up arrow" (if you add one) is going to be hard to "intuitivize" because it might seem best as a sort of "smart back button" and if one came into the CPs from a GL, go to the source GL, but if from the CPTOC to return there. 
It's trickier than it might at first seem because there may seldom be a desire to go from a CP to the overall CPTOC since one might be "ordinarily" expected to be looking at a CP in relation to its GL rather than to other unrelated CPs. 
I dunno, what do you think? 
Whatever you do will locate other opinions who feel that a different set of choices are "more intuitive" and the best practice for those of us more familiar with the set may be "not so best" for someone coming to it fresh - who will hopefully outnumber us some day. 
All that said, I think the up arrow is a good idea, particularly if it's dynamically labelled. 
The "next slide ALT" is OK but if it could be a label instead of a tooltip it would be more exciting since it wouldn't require "mouseover" to read and would give a "tree" sort of mapping by being on all the arrows that might be instructive to the user. 
I just don't think the CPs are particularly related to each other so that when one has available a "previous" that goes to a CP for a different GL, which is arbitrarily related to the GL under study, or to a "next" which takes one into new GL territory, it might tend to be diversive. 
Love. 
ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE Hi Alan... 
Your comments had me confused until I deduced that you must be using LYNX to look at the slides. 
The Slidemaker tool I use automatically generates some metadata in the HEAD of the HTML. 
On Checkpoint slide 2-0 for instance, Slidemaker generates: As far as I know, LYNX is the only browser that actually exposes the LINK REL elements to the user. 
So, for LYNX users, a "second" set of navigation aids would indeed seem redundant. 
However, for the users of almost every other browser, the HEAD metadata is not exposed and the following rationales would kick in. 
1. 
If you bookmarked slide 45 of 78 and came back to it in another session, you could not "Go Back" to the ToC. 2. If you started at the TOC, selected Slide 1 of 78, advanced slide by slide to slide 45 of 78, you would have to hit Go Back 46 times to reach the ToC. 
If your browser supported a pull-down recent-history list, you might be able to find the ToC more quickly but the list might not support that many past links. 
That is still a lot of keyboarding if a quick link to the ToC was unavailable. 
Do you think it would be reasonable then, given that I do provide prev/next links on every slide, to remove the LINK REL statement in the HEAD so they don't confuse LYNX users? 
Regards, Chuck Personally, I found the TOC button on each page unnecessary/redundant. 
To return to the TOC, one clicks the browser's back button, or presses the keyboard shortcut (left arrow in Lynx; Alt + left arrow in IE or NN; Ctrl + left arrow in Opera). 
In fact, it is easier (for me, anyway) to use the keyboard technique than to hunt around for the TOC button. 
But never mind, I am surely in the minority on this issue. 
I found your navigation scheme quite usable. 
(Although I wondered why it was necessary to include two "previous slide" links and two "next slide" links per slide...) Starling Access Services "Access A World Of Possibility" e-mail: info@starlingweb.com
