I saw that a new draft was issued in March, but that's expired, and I can't find anything further. 
Can anyone enlighten me as to the status of this work? 
Thanks, Martin Martin Presler-Marshall - P3P Champion E-mail: mpresler@us.ibm.com 441-4118) We've been trying to get it published as an RFC. 
So far, there has been support within the IESG for making it an Experimental, but that would make it a no-no to reference in standards-track documents. 
Since there are a number of things that would like to use it and go to standards-track, we are trying to get that changed. 
My own personal take on the situation is that there is resistance to anything that encourages more protocols to extend or layer on HTTP because that is viewed as a problem. 
In some ways, I actually share this view, but I also think that since it will happen anyway we should at least provide some guidance on the less-bad ways to do it. 
[in the interest of reducing duplicates, and because this is about the status and not the protocol, I've directed replies only to discuss@apps.ietf.org]

One data point: I asked Keith Moore about the status at WWW8 (May this year), he told me that they were thinking about it, but it did not sound like anything would happen soon. 
I guess I should mention here that I am one of the main proponents of making it experimental only, at least until we have more experience etc, and I have told the IESG so. 
I'm not convinced that using the -ext- framework is superior to just defining some new methods/headers.

The IETF has lots of problems with apps. 
The number of working groups has over whelmed the IETF apparatus, both the IESG and the ADs have been overloaded. 
Maybe it is time that we declare that apps are just too big and too complicated for the IETF architecture. 
Maybe it's time that Apps leaves the IETF and forms its own organization. 
Eventually the kids have to grow up and move on, maybe that time has come for apps.

From: moore@cs.utk.edu 
It's been approved by IESG (at the last IESG teleconference) for publication as Experimental. 
Will we get a note from the IESG explaining why Experimental and what would be needed to move it to standards track? 
There are some efforts that hope to be standards track that have been planning to use and reference it; this will create a problem for them. 
Standard Operating Procedure for features that we're uncertain about the value of is that we issue them as Experimental so that people can experiment with them from a stable reference, and when someone needs it for something we all agree should go standards-track, it is reissued as Proposed. 
Happening with DNS SRV records, for instance. 
Or (for those with long memories) to the X.400/SMTP gateway specs.

--On 99-12-06 11.26 -0800 "Yaron Goland (Exchange)" This has been discussed a number of times, and every time the answer that comes back states that having meetings at the same time (i.e. at the same IETF meetings) is a good thing. 
It has also been discussed whether the various areas should be meeting at different dates, and the answer to that questions has also been the same. 
Take for example the MMMS or iDNS BOF or the IMPP effort which all depend on interest from more areas than APPS. 
The problem we have in apps is that we have too many things on the table, and you point that out in your mail. 
Too many things are "almost done" and that take 100% of the energy we all have. 
I hope that the ADs with help from wg's can clean the table substantially this winter, but if things are not better at the winter -00 IETF, I am happy to discuss this problem again. 
Patrik My suggestion is that APPS have their meeting one week and all other IETF groups the next week. 
People can then stay for two weeks if they want to cover both areas, which I expect IESG members will do, but the load on the single weeks will be less. 
Some topics which are of special interest to both APPS and other areas could be scheduled for the weekend between APPS and the rest, or the Friday the first week or the Monday the next week. 
This proposal might actually increase cross-fertilization, because with the present scheme, very few people have time to go to working groups within both APPS and the other areas!

I don't think you'll ever get a significant number of people or companies to commit two weeks at a time, 3 times a year, to being away from work and their families. 
The end result will be less cross over and cross pollination than currently happens. 
It will be almost impossible to get people who focus mostly on SEC, ROUTING, TRANSPORT or OPS to pop in to help out in their specific areas of expertise, or to be available for consultation. 
Similarly, it will be impossible to get significant numbers of APPS folks to participate in such areas as XMLSIG, S/MIME, PKIX, OPENPGP and STIME (to pick a few). 
In all, I think such a breakup would cause a significant decrease in expertise levels across the board. 
And that would NOT be a good idea.

As others have pointed out, this is logistically infeasible. 
Right now, I'm not even getting to current IETF meetings, much less larger cuts out of life. 
I believe the overlap is essential: we've seen what happens when a "killer app" gets deployed without anyone understanding what is going on. 
The hallway conversations again and again educate both apps and infrastructure people as to the problems presented by protocols. 
I gave alot of thought some years ago whether doing HTTP in W3C say, would make more sense, and finally concluded that it would not: the feedback and conversations with people getting the packets from point A to point B were necessary. 
The big issue the IETF does have in APPS is one of scaling: as editor of HTTP, the big issue I saw was delays caused by insufficient cycles in AD's to read and comment on specifications. 
These caused unnecessary many month delays. 
There are ways to "fix" this: another Apps AD, or some reader mechanism, or trying to make sure that Apps AD's can spend full or nearly full time on IETF business. 
I suggest these long before doing application protocol standards work in other venues.

I have specifically suggested adding a 3rd Apps AD to NONCOM. 
I do not think this will solve all of the problems but it could certainly help. 
I also suggested a specific TELEPHONY area. 
With all of the related work that is going on it seems reasonable to seperate it out to permit TEL AD's a more focused approach to some of the looming and unresolved architectural issues. 
I also totally reject the idea that APPS should meet separately from other IETF WG's.
