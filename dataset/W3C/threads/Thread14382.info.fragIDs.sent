<s> The verb "avoid" appears repeatedly in the WCAG 2.0 draft: * Avoid methods that interfere with navigation.  </s>
<s> * Avoid causing content to blink or flicker otherwise than under the control of the user.  </s>
<s> * Avoid causing pages to be refreshed or updated automatically, otherwise than in response to a user's request.  </s>
<s> We should eliminate the use of this term for a number of reasons: 1.  </s>
<s> It is "negative thinking" and requires the reader to _not_ do something, rather than to _do_ something.  </s>
<s> Proactive guidelines make for a better document.  </s>
<s> 2. It is unclear what "avoid" means.  </s>
<s> Does that mean don't do it?  </s>
<s> Does it mean do it but feel bad about it?  </s>
<s> Does it mean don't do it most of the time?  </s>
<s> 3. The ambiguity of the term effectively means (by a plain English interpretation of "avoid") that it is up to the reader's discretion whether or not the undesirable method is used.  </s>
<s> This is extremely poor as our guidelines need to be far more explicit _and_ should not assume that the reader has sufficient knowledge to make complex decisions regarding accessibility issues.  </s>
<s> Therefore, I propose the following: The verb "avoid" should be avoided -- er, should NEVER BE USED -- in WCAG 2.0.  </s>
