<s> Hi, I am attaching a zip file with the testcases and a readme.html  </s>
<s> file which describes the attribute tested in the testcase.  </s>
<s> Can someone please check the basic sanity of the testcases, so that it can be added to the DOM TS. Thanks Siva  </s>
<s> Hi Siva Thanks for the tests.  </s>
<s> It feels really good to have another major contributor to the DOM TS.  </s>
<s> I think we should allow for a few days for sanity checking the submitted  </s>
<s> tests, and I can then commit them to the CVS (after changes, if any).  </s>
<s> Again, thanks /Dimitris  </s>
<s> On the first quick read-through, you may want to add author and organization data in the test's metadata element, as well as a prose description of the behaviour the test expect(not vital to test functionality, but it is good to have for displaying in the test matrix).  </s>
<s> Lastly, if you can, also add a pointer to the relevant part of the specification (this is used to point the relevant part of the spec from the text matrix to serve as reference for particular tests).  </s>
<s> See the example below with inlined comments.  </s>
<s> The "splitText(offset)" method returns the new Text node.  </s>
<s> Retrieve the textual data from the last child of the first employee and invoke the "splitText(offset)" method.  </s>
<s> The method should return the new Text node.  </s>
<s> The offset value used for this test is 30.  </s>
<s> The "getNodeValue()" method is called to check that the new node now contains the characters at and after position 30.  </s>
<s> (Starting count at 0) !-- here you give a text description of the test's expected behaviour -- subject resource="http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-DOM- Level-1-19981001/level-one-core#ID-38853C1D"/ !-- Point to the relevant part of the spec, in this example (L1 Core, textsplittextfour.xml) it is the Text.splitText method, similar for your tests.  </s>
<s> -- Again, thanks, it's very good to see that we have a major submission from Netscape.  </s>
<s> /Dimitris  </s>
<s> Schema validating the tests identifies problems in a handful of tests, a couple of mismatched variable names, ignorecase for ignoreCase and missing ignoreCase attributes.  </s>
<s> I've attached an abridged output of the running of Sun's Multischema Validator on the tests.  </s>
<s> ignoreCase="auto" is being used inproperly.  </s>
<s> It should only be used when an HTML processor is required to uppercase the return value.  </s>
<s> With the NIST submission, I globally changed all ignoreCase="auto" to ignoreCase="false" and will need to walk through the tests to find the few that really should be ignoreCase="auto".  </s>
<s> A subject in the metadata section is necessary for tests to appear in the right place in the test matrix.  </s>
<s> Basically, would need to cut and paste URI's from dom1-subjects.xml for the attribute or method being tested.  </s>
<s> I'd prefer committing the tests to the CVS now so we can track the evolution  </s>
<s> of the tests.  </s>
<s> Committing the tests to the CVS does not imply any judgement on the tests, just they are a work in process that we are collaborating on.  </s>
<s> Fixing up the problems identified by the schema validation allows running  </s>
