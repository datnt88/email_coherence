wendy a chisholm world wide web consortium web accessibility initiative seattle, wa usa I was at a rehab center last Thursday were they are training people to learn to use computers after the loss of some functionality. 
Inexcusably their web consultant had made an inaccessible site for them (claiming it had some accessibility features - it did not even have alt tags) Anyway, when discussing what needed to be done, the center of the center felt that the most urgent, and first equipment was to put in vowels into the Hebrew. 
On the other hand the budget person claimed it was two expensive...... But from spending some time watching people actually trying to use assertive technologies on Hebrew websites, I would say two things - It is probably the biggest job when making a Hebrew site accessible, and it is probably the most important. 
Life is like that sometimes By the way, I am going to be working with this center quite a bit, and will be able to do technique testing with them. 
I am hoping that it will be helpful Also from seeing Hebrew screen readers at work, So far I was extremely unimpressed. 
they are out of the price range of most people here and are not really usable or helpful. 
I am going to test another one that is meant to be top of the line... will keep you posted In the mean time it explains why sites for the vision impaired hear , like uses untitled frames - the web is just not usable for Hebrew speaking vision impaired. 
All the best, Lisa Seeman UnBounded Access Widen the World Web The problem is probably not with the screen readers, but with the speech synthesis software they are using. 
If they are all relying on the same speech synthesis engine, one can expect that they will all be prone to the same shortcomings in respect of pronunciation accuracy. 
The question, under those circumstances, is whether alternatives are available or a suitable tool could readily be constructed to resolve the problem, as discussed in the working group meeting last month.
