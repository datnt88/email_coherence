Hello, This is a reminder that the UAAG 1.0 last call [1] ends Wednesday, 18 September. 
Thank you for your comments on the document, _ Ian [1] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2002JulSep/0094 Ian Jacobs (ij@w3.org)

http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs Hi Ian &amp; list, How are you? 
Should I make any of my previous comments about Linux compliance in the last call? 
(Or have I already done this?) Thanks. 
Best, --JP Cell: 206-849-9032 LARS: http://trace.wisc.edu/linux

News - Today's headlines Hi JP, I'm just back from vacation (hence lack of responsiveness over last 10 days). 
It was my impression that your comments fell into two categories: * Suggestions for coordination with Linux developers (which are very helpful). 
* Requests for clarification about the existence of APIs, controls, etc. in the Linux environment. 
It is my impression that these issues lie outside of UAAG 1.0 (but within the scope of the Techniques Document, where this information is found). 
I don't think these are new issues the concern UAAG 1.0. 
What is most helpful to us is if you suggest concrete new text for either document to clarify the points you found inadequate. 
Thank you, - Ian Ian Jacobs (ij@w3.org)
