Is there a way, issuing an HTTP 1.1 GET request to force the response to be chunked, and also to ensure a a maximum size for each chunk?

No. Even if 1.1 has such a mechanism, you might be talking to a 1.0 server.

| You can use the TE request-header to indicate what transfer-codings you are willing to accept. 
However, there is no means to limit the chunk size.
