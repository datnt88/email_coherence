<s> Hi all, Sorry that this is not 24 hours in advance (it's more like 22 grin ).  </s>
<s> agenda for tomorrow: 1. revised charter 2. agner's e-mail from 16 December [http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/1999OctDec/0063.html] 3. captions for audio http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/1999OctDec 4. Rating models 5. Proposals for checkpoint 1.3 and 1.4 Substantial changes made to the charter [1] since last week: 1. the mission statement - it is much shorter and more "deliverables" focused as this is our primary reason for existence.  </s>
<s> 2. the scope - i wanted to scope our work by our intended audience and point out that EO produces derivative work of ours.  </s>
<s> 3. release policy - it is less mechanical and simpler.  </s>
<s> 4. participants - some rewording, but also added a link to a form [2] that one fills out to request membership in the group.  </s>
<s> I think the scope section still needs some work.  </s>
<s> Judy will be sending some proposed changes as well.  </s>
<s> I think Judy secured two reviewers from the management team.  </s>
<s> They're ready as soon as we are.  </s>

<s> I think the "Mission Statement" should say something like: "The WCAG are the cornerstone of the WAI effort and provide the basis on which all the other Recommendations depend: AU, UA, and ER." although it's heavily addressed in section 9, might deserve up-frontness?  </s>
<s> 2.2 "documented in the Techniques document" might enjoy a better verb.  </s>
<s> 4 Deliverables #s 3 and 4 are implicitly contained or necessary for #2 to have happened so might be better included in #2.  </s>
<s> Still think 5 is UA job - let's avoid a "jurisdictional dispute"?  </s>
<s> 8 might also be considered an integral/indespensible part of 2?  </s>
<s> 7. Schedule has "Working Drafts are available to the public, but a call for public review has not been issued."  </s>
<s> something grammatically grating?  </s>
<s> 9.1 "Once PF has identified or worked through an accessibility barrier with a group, we need to update our deliverables as accordingly."  </s>
<s> grammar?  </s>
<s> Love. ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE  </s>
<s> I have updated the charter [1] based on comments received as of today.  </s>
<s> changes include those inspired by william (listed below) as well as: 1. in section 10 separated "disability experts" into "research community" and "disability community." 2. in section 10 removed "liaison" from all but "developer community" and qualified that the liaisons are to other W3C groups.  </s>
<s> 3. in the mission, instead of producing a "new version of" we will produce a "revised" WCAG. 4. in the schedule, deleted the reference to the first face to face occurring after CSUN 5. in the mission, changed "to document accessible authoring practices" to "to document accessible techniques" 6. in the mission, the revised guidelines are listed first rather than the techniques.  </s>
<s> William, I have a couple comments about your comments that we didn't address on the call today:  </s>
<s> hmm. what do other people think?  </s>
<s> i don't think this is necessary, but if people feel strongly about it we can add it.  </s>
<s> how about "addressed?"  </s>
<s> i agree with 3 (checkpoint list).  </s>
<s> i do not agree with 4 (techniques document).  </s>
<s> 3 because it is a derivative work of the guidelines.  </s>
<s> the techniques document is not derived from the guidelines.  </s>
<s> we discussed this on the call.  </s>
<s> minutes are part of the process, however they do require an amount of effort therefore are highlighted.  </s>
<s> how about: Working Drafts should be published at least on a monthly basis.  </s>
<s> Working Drafts are available to the public, but have not been reviewed by the WAI Interest Group and are not published on the W3C Technical Reports page.  </s>
<s> In a sense these are "Internal" Working Drafts.  </s>
<s> Public Working Drafts should be published at least every three months (per the Release Policy).  </s>
<s> These differ from Internal Working Drafts in that they have been reviewed by the WAI Interest Group and are published on the W3C Technical Reports page.  </s>
<s> how about: Once PF has identified or worked through an accessibility barrier with a specification, we should reflect the new information in our deliverables.  </s>

<s> All the points I raised are satisfactorily resolved by Wendy's words.  </s>
