<s> Document's Title: No title Hi After installing the latest Windows version yesterday from http, as the other sites came up with error messages, I have endeavoured to open some of my html pages.  </s>
<s> This is now producing two problems.. 1.0 During the editing of any html file the window closes without a command be given.  </s>
<s> 1.1 This has the effect of deleting all files on the C: (boot) drive.  </s>
<s> Just the files not folders(directories) or any files contained therein.  </s>
<s> I really mean all the files including "readonly, hidden , system " the start up files have all disappeared.  </s>
<s> 1.2 The machine will only boot from a floppy and I restore the missing files from a backup when it restarts normally until the next time I run AMAYA.  </s>
<s> 1.3 I have repeated this six times with identicall results.  </s>
<s> 1.4 A side effect appears to be that a 2nd backup copy of each html  </s>
<s> file worked on is saved on to the C: drive where it resides along with io.sys  </s>
<s> config.sys etc etc. 2.0 Have I forgotten something?  </s>
<s> 3.0 Are the files being deleted during a closedown deletion of temporary internet files 4.0 Have I picked up a "nasty" ?  </s>

<s> I've had similar problems, though drive C: appears to be intact.  </s>

<s> Hi, Did you changed the Amaya configuration using the preferences menu?  </s>
<s> Otherwise Amaya shouldn't remove files except those loaded with Amaya and these temporary files are stored in the c:\temp\.amaya\1  </s>
<s> ... \9 directories.  </s>
<s> Could you give us more information about your system configuration?  </s>
<s> One person reported that Amaya could not work as soon as he installed IE5 on his Windows box.  </s>
<s> Do you have IE5 installed?  </s>

<s> Hi!  </s>
<s> html  </s>
<s> I think you have set the temporary drive/folder in amayas preferences to the root or there is no temp/tmp variable set on your system.  </s>
<s> At least I did not have that problem with Windows NT. Regards CC derago, Wiesenstr.  </s>
