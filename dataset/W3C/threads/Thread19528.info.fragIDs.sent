Document's Title: No title Hi After installing the latest Windows version yesterday from http, as the other sites came up with error messages, I have endeavoured to open some of my html pages. 
This is now producing two problems.. 1.0 During the editing of any html file the window closes without a command be given. 
1.1 This has the effect of deleting all files on the C: (boot) drive. 
Just the files not folders(directories) or any files contained therein. 
I really mean all the files including "readonly, hidden , system " the start up files have all disappeared. 
1.2 The machine will only boot from a floppy and I restore the missing files from a backup when it restarts normally until the next time I run AMAYA. 
1.3 I have repeated this six times with identicall results. 
1.4 A side effect appears to be that a 2nd backup copy of each html 
file worked on is saved on to the C: drive where it resides along with io.sys 
config.sys etc etc. 2.0 Have I forgotten something? 
3.0 Are the files being deleted during a closedown deletion of temporary internet files 4.0 Have I picked up a "nasty" ?

I've had similar problems, though drive C: appears to be intact. 
I'm making backups now... Simon St.Laurent XML: A Primer Sharing Bandwidth / Cookies

Hi, Did you changed the Amaya configuration using the preferences menu? 
Otherwise Amaya shouldn't remove files except those loaded with Amaya and these temporary files are stored in the c:\temp\.amaya\1 
... \9 directories. 
Could you give us more information about your system configuration? 
One person reported that Amaya could not work as soon as he installed IE5 on his Windows box. 
Do you have IE5 installed? 
Irene. 
Hi! 
html 
I think you have set the temporary drive/folder in amayas preferences to the root or there is no temp/tmp variable set on your system. 
At least I did not have that problem with Windows NT. Regards CC derago, Wiesenstr.
