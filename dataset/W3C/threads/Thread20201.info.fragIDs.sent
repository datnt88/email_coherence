Help. I've tried several times to get Amaya to work on Win98. 
I've downloaded several different versions, installed same, and still my system crashed every time I try to use it. 
I think it's a memory problem, but I can't be sure. 
Can anyone help me out here? 
I'd really like to try Amaya out, but I don't yet have access to a Unix box. 
Thanks.

Be patient we're preparing a new release 2.2 for the next week. 
That release will include some memory problems and a Windows 98 version. 
Regards 
Irene. 
It's nice to know you're being consistent. 
Every previous version has also included some memory problems.

Of course, you should read "will fix some memory problems..." Irene.
