<s> Help. I've tried several times to get Amaya to work on Win98.  </s>
<s> I've downloaded several different versions, installed same, and still my system crashed every time I try to use it.  </s>
<s> I think it's a memory problem, but I can't be sure.  </s>
<s> Can anyone help me out here?  </s>
<s> I'd really like to try Amaya out, but I don't yet have access to a Unix box.  </s>
