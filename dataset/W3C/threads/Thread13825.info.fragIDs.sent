<s> The guidelines state that where an OBJECT element refers to an image, script or applet, alternative (textual) content must be provided where the object in question conveys important information.  </s>
<s> I think this formulation may give designers too much latitude in deciding which items convey "important information" and which do not.  </s>
<s> The issue is made even more confusing by the "priority 1" rating of this guideline.  </s>
<s> Suggestion: Rewrite the guideline so that images are treated separately.  </s>
<s> It should be made clear, as in other parts of the guidelines, that alternative textual content is always required with respect to images.  </s>
<s> As regards scripts and applets, an appropriate statement would be to the effect that alternative content is needed where these convey visual or auditory?  </s>
<s> information which is significant in relation to the purpose to be fulfilled by the web page.  </s>
<s> I am sure that the editors can express this idea more succinctly.  </s>
<s> we define what "important" means (see Appendix A).  </s>
<s> Is it still vague enough to allow too much latitude, or do you expect that authors will not look at what "important" means (even though we link to it throughout the guideliens)?  </s>
<s> First of all, it seems that you are talking about A2 - descriptions of images rather than A1 - brief alternative text.  </s>
<s> This technique is a P1 for the same reason that the guideline is a P1. What we are saying is that in the particular instance that you use OBJECT to embed an applet, script, or image, and that applet, script, or image conveys important information (that is not conveyed through the alternative text - A1), then you need to use OBJECT appropriately to provide a description of the important information that is conveyed.  </s>
<s> could you explain why it is confusing?  </s>
<s> why do you feel images should be treated separately?  </s>
<s> If scripts or applets are used to present information that needs a long description, the issue is the same as an image.  </s>
<s> thus, it seems these can all be dealt with in one place.  </s>
<s> the rest of your comment is what we have been striving for, and if we are not conveying the thoughts appropriately, please help us in doing so.  </s>
<s> being knee deep in it, i think that the guidelines convey exactly what you've said.  </s>
<s> however, we have separated audio and video into four guidelines: A.1 - at the minimum provide short text alternatives for visual objects (presented either through static images, active applets, etc.) A.2 - if important information is conveyed through applets, scripts, or image, describe it.  </s>
<s> A.3. - at a minimum provide a short text alternative for all audio, and if important info presented, provide a transcript.  </s>
<s> A.4. - how to deal with video (synching captions, audio descriptios, and providing transcripts)  </s>
<s> thanks for your confidence, but I think we're a bit befuddled with what the issue is!  </s>
<s> thanks, --editors  </s>
<s> From memory, what I found to be misleading in this case was that OBJECT elements were explicitly mentioned only in the context of "images, scripts and applets" and the need for long descriptions.  </s>
<s> The intended result, however, is that whether an image be embedded with IMG or OBJECT, some kind of textual alternative must be provided (via ALT or the content of OBJECT).  </s>
<s> In most cases it is sufficient for this to consist of a short label, but in some cases a longer discursive alternative is needed.  </s>
<s> If I have misread the guidelines, then my comment in this respect may be irrelevant.  </s>
<s> I haven't had time to read the techniques document yet, in which the use of OBJECT to convey labels (similar to ALT text) may well be explained, or at least ought to be.  </s>
