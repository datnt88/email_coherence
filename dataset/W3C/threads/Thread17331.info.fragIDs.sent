<s> Hi all, again.  </s>
<s> Is the common abbreviation of cutting out the first 2 digits of the year an accessibility problem?  </s>
<s> 2003 = '03 or 2004 = '04.  </s>
<s> Is the abbreviation tag useful for this purpose?  </s>
<s> Or is the abbreviation so common that if used in context it makes as much sense to a visual user as to somebody accessing the website through a screen reader?  </s>
<s> Just curious, Juan C. Ulloa * Website Specialist / Web Services http://ir.bcc.ctc.edu/webservices * Bellevue Community College http://www.bcc.ctc.edu/ * julloa@bcc.ctc.edu mailto:julloa@bcc.ctc.edu * (425) 564-2487 * Mailstop: D261  </s>
<s> Actually, abbreviation of years doesn't make any sense to me at all.  </s>
<s> When it's just two digits it's highly confusing (I can't immediately recognize it as a year, it might be any number, or a month, or a day); when you use an apostrophe you gain just one character, but still lose clarity.  </s>
<s> Why not use the full year?  </s>

<s> Not accessibility per se, but personally I find such abbreviated years pretty unreadable for years prior to the '20s, and generally prefer full years even for the '20s and later (I would have said 1920s or 2020s but I couldn't make my mind up what '20s would mean these days without a context - that in itself can make it something to avoid).  </s>
<s> If I was marking up text that contained '03 in it and for some reason didn't want to change the text as presented (say I was quoting and wanted to be faithful to the quote) I would probably use abbr .  </s>
<s> Jon Hanna *Thought provoking quote goes here*  </s>
<s> I would *definetly* claim that it is, yes.  </s>
<s> You are, basically, cutting out a piece of the information you want to convey to the user, and then expecting them to fill it in themselves.  </s>
<s> Such a method reduces the accessibility of the information.  </s>
<s> I suggest not doing it.  </s>
