<s> The following question was prompted by recent discussion on this list of whether tags should be added to HTML so as to identify abbreviations and acronyms.  </s>
<s> For purposes of both braille and speech output, it is necessary  </s>
<s> to be able to ascertain the language in which a document is written.  </s>
<s> It might well be argued that such functionality can be achieved within the  </s>
<s> HTML user agent by means of dictionaries, perhaps combined with a grammatical analysis of the text.  </s>
<s> However, in the case of multilingual  </s>
<s> documents, it may be more difficult to determine which words are intended to be written in which language, especially if there is some correspondence in spelling.  </s>
<s> How reliable are software-based "language identification techniques?  </s>
<s> Do multilingual documents occur frequently  </s>
<s> enough to warrant the inclusion of a specific HTML tag, or should the question be decided as a matter of principle rather than on the basis of perceived frequency?  </s>
<s> Regards, Jason White.  </s>
<s> My understanding this that techniques for morphological analysis are really quite good, but are better suited to supporting authoring, where the authoring tool can take some of the grind out of entering the markup.  </s>
<s> HTML Cougar basically subsumes RFC 2070 including the LANG attribute which is intended for this purpose.  </s>
<s> The following  </s>
<s> is extracted from the spec: The lang attribute's value is a language code that identifies a natural language spoken, written, or otherwise conveyed by human beings for communication of information to other human beings.  </s>
<s> Computer languages are explicitly excluded from language codes.  </s>
<s> The syntax and registry of HTML language codes is the same as that defined by [RFC1766].  </s>
<s> Language codes consist of a primary code and a possibly empty series of subcodes: language-code = primary-code *( "-" subcode ) primary-code = 1*8ALPHA subcode = 1*8ALPHA EXAMPLE: "en": English "en-US": the U.S. version of English.  </s>
<s> "en-cockney": the Cockney version of English.  </s>
<s> "i-cherokee": the Cherokee language spoken by some Native Americans.  </s>
<s> Two-letter primary codes are reserved for [ISO639] language abbreviations.  </s>
<s> Three-letter primary codes are reserved for "Ethnologue" abbreviations ([ETHNO]) (in in addition to the requirements of [RFC1766]).  </s>
<s> Any two-letter primary code is a [ISO3166] country code.. Regards, Dave Raggett dsr@w3.org  </s>

<s> to follow up on what Dave Raggett said:  </s>
<s> Thanks for explaining this.  </s>
<s> May I check to see if I got the story straight?  </s>
<s> In the current W3C recommendation (14-Jan-1997) there is no support for language identification other than by putting an HTTP-EQUIV META tag in the HEAD which is perforce for the whole document.  </s>
<s> We can see in the Cougar DTD (that's all we can see) that LANG is  </s>
<s> a generic attribute.  </s>
<s> This means that it can be used on P, BLOCQUOTE, and generally enough varieties of container to handle mixed-language documents.  </s>
<s> Is that substantially correct?  </s>
<s> Al Gilman  </s>
<s> Yes - and you can get RFC 2070 from: ftp://ftp.ds.internic.net/rfc/rfc2070.txt  </s>
<s> The new Japanese wing of W3C is particularly interested in internationalization and tackling harder cases like vertical text runs, and mixed vertical and horizontal runs.  </s>
<s> (ugh!).  </s>
