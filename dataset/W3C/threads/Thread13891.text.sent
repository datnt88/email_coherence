I have some fairly effective spam filtering at webthing.com. 
But my dialup address, c/o my ISP, is completely unfiltered, and has recently started to get significant volumes *in spite of* being completely private. 
I've just got a message entitled "notabug.com". 
Since the name notabug rigns a bell, I actually read it, and it turned out to be "trafficmagnet" spam. 
That's blocked at Webthing, but checking the headers I found it was addressed to my unfiltered address. 
It appears to have been harvested from the #er chatlogs at notabug. 
Can I put in a plea for the administrators of notabug NOT to publish email addresses featured in IRC, as these may be (as in my case) a great deal more private and vulnerable than our "public" address. 
Thank you, Nick Kew In a quick search of the logs I couldn't find your email address. 
I'm happy to remove things from the logs if you can give me the date and time so I can find them. 
If you don't want things to be in the logs, start your line with [off]. 
But if you're worried about spam, I suggest you get a real solution, like a Bayesian filter. 
Playing these silly email-address-hiding games don't solve much, in my experience.

That's probably because you grepped for my _public_ address. 
nick@webthing.com is very public, and heavily spam-filtered. 
The address I'm bothered about is known only to a few individuals, and - I've just found out - appears in your logs every day:-( Totally irrelevant. 
The address appearing has nothing to do with anything I type. 
But you're logging my "local" address every time I join #er. 
I know that very well. 
But I have to have an ISP so that I can connect to the net. 
That's an old-fashioned modem, which is the only kind of connection available here. 
And with that comes an email address which I can't filter before the spam travels down my modem link. 
And I don't want to block it completely, because a very few people have it and use it legitimately, and because webthing.com 
forwards my legitimate mail to it for when I dialup. 
I'm not blaming you: none of us realised until now what was happening. 
But if you could add a regexp to strip email addresses when people join #er, you will cease to be a spam-magnet. 
Nick Kew I see. 
You should configure your client not to send your real username when it connects.
