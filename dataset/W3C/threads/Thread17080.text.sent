As I understand it, accesskeys may be useful when they are used considtently through an application, or (better) a user's entire environment, so that users become familiar with them. 
This is relatively uncommon on the web, where few sites can expect to be visited so often as to benefit. 
With mod_accessibility, the situation is somewhat different. 
It offers a standardised set of options that are likely to be consistent throughout a site, and could potentially be shared amongst all sites using it. 
While the use of accesskeys is ultimately controlled by the server administrator, I'd like to designate default values for them, and use those at my own sites. 
Currently mod_accessibility offers users a choice of seven[1] views on a page: Asis, Noframes, Medium (basic renditions but with different treatments of Frames and included contents). 
Full (adds Title attributes to all links) Betsie (emulates BBC betsie behaviour) Outline (shows page outline) Links (page links, with additional information) I think these - particularly the Outline - will benefit from standardised accesskeys. 
But in assigning them, I'd like to avoid clashes with other applications users are likely to be familiar with. 
In the case of Outline and Links, maybe I can do still better by assigning accesskeys that are used for broadly equivalent functions in other apps. 
Can anyone suggest accesskeys to use or avoid, or further reading on the subject? 
[1] Up to seven; this may be reduced by a server administrator, as in the case of Site Valet where I've taken out the frames-fixing options because it doesn't use frames in the first place:-) Nick Kew One person did a survey looking for keys not already reserved by adaptive or other software and only came up with three: / " ] And even that only applied in English language situations. 
See http://www.webaim.org/discussion/mail_message.php?id=2260 for a discussion thereof.... Bill Mason Accessible Internet w3c@accessibleinter.net uhmmm... 'twas me. 
Earlier last summer, the Canadian Government was suggesting the use of three standardised AccessKeys across all Government of Canada web sites. 
One key in particular was conflicting with IBM HPR, but upon further research we discovered that, especially with the customization of JAWs (including Classic Laptop version) plus other keystroke combinations reserved in other types of adaptive technology that there really were no available keystroke combinations which were workable... even the three I thought we had happened upon were ruled out by Jukka as not viable with non-North American keyboards. 
(Jukka?) At any rate, after researching the subject, a final recommendation was put forward to eliminate the use of Accesskeys due to these conflicts (see: It's really too bad, it would be extremely useful if there were even a few "standardised" combinations, such as "return to Top" "go to navigation" etc. 
However, while the Accesskey ideas is great, it's implementation appears to be non-viable.

Behalf Of Bill Mason Sent: Sunday, February 23, 2003 6:48 PM Subject: Re: Guidance re Accesskeys Nick, I have read other threads in HWG lists on this topic, and almost every key combination suggested for standard web site actions was, according to someone, used in their browser for something useful. 
I wrote an article on it too - and got no useful feedback. 
The only suggestion I have seen is to use numbers - but these aren't as easy to remember as letters. 
And anyway, other posts here appear to rule those out. 
As you say, part of the problem is that there is no standard for web use - and no standard for web structure or content, either. 
We all learn different key combinations for most applications (apart from the really common things like file save, file print, copy, cut, paste etc.) - so perhaps what is needed is some accepted convention for user agents. 
Chances of that - think snowballs and hell ;-) Lois Wakeman
