APPROVED (with above corrections) Confirm following actions completed: ACTION: 2001-06-22#6: Dan Brickley: start activating issues on RDFS See http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2001Jun/0482.html 
CONFIRMED DONE Review status of following actions: ACTION: JUN-01-01-#9: Ora Lassila: send a note to the WG that describes how rdf:aboutEach is being used and how it was implemented CONTINUED (Ora Lassila absent) ACTION: 2001-06-22#2: Brian McBride: Write a draft on what issues are in scope, how are they allocated to partitions, what are the dependencies. 
CONTINUED (only partially done) ACTION: 2001-06-22#3: All: Post issue priorities with reasons CONTINUED (need more feedback) ACTION: 2001-06-22#4: Sergey Melnik: Summarize issue priorities that are posted by 9am San Francisco time, Wednesday 4th July. 
CONTINUED (after more feedback from above action) ACTION: 2001-06-22#5: Dan Brickley: Get a draft of RDFSchema to the group. 
Dan posted his current work in progress to the list at CONTINUED (Dan Brickley absent) ACTION: 2001-06-22#7: Brian McBride: Do a writeup of the containers proposal. 
Discussed below as Issue #1 DONE ACTION: 2001-06-08#2: Dan Brickley: write up decision to allow partial descriptions of containers up in more detail for the list CONTINUED (Dan Brickley absent) Issues discussion: Issue #1 Owner: Brian McBride The analysis in the meeting agenda: was accepted as closing the issue. 
ACTION: 2001-06-29#1: Brian McBride: put the writeup online. 
ISSUE CLOSED Issue #2 Owner: Aaron Swartz Considered Aaron's resolution in: Discussion led to revised wording from Aaron: Usage of an rdf:ID attribute to identify the subject of a description, is equivalent to usage of an rdf:about attribute with the same content, except the content of the rdf:about attribute is prefixed by a '#' character and URI encoded. 
which was mostly agreed. 
Discussion of proposal for adding an rdfs:isDefinedIn property for every ID did not get sufficient consensus - to be continued on email. 
ACTION: 2001-06-29#2: Ron Daniel: post an analysis of where the distinction of ID and about has been used. 
ISSUE CONTINUED Issue #3 Owner: Stephen Petschulat Considered his summary in: and Ora Lassila's comments in and RESOLVED that: rdf:aboutEach is not allowed on an rdf:Description element which is an object of a statement. 
ISSUE CLOSED Issue #4 Owner: Jan Grant Discussed his proposal in: Brian McBride proposed the issue be postponed since Dan Brickley and Dan Connolly were not present and had points they wanted to raise. 
ACTION: 2001-06-29#3: Ron Daniel: post an email about how support of xml:base would generate different things in RDF/XML parsers. 
ISSUE CONTINUED Any Other Business xml:lang and literals - Brian McBride Presentation from Brian that xml:lang is not in the formal model but sort-of is from the prose and syntax and proposes that a literal might be at least a pair of items (string, language). 
Sergey Melnik brought up adding namespaces to the RDF model which is not currently recorded on the issues list. 
ACTION: 2001-06-29#4: Brian McBride: Update the issue to add Sergey's question: Namespaces are used as an abbreviation in the syntax - is it syntactic sugar or part of the model? 
Wide ranging discussion of literals and xml:lang - implementation experience, querying - see the chat log. 
Several strong expressions of support given for xml:lang as already used in applications. 
Discussion of xml:lang as a special case of more general/primitive data types. 
Taken as a slightly separate issue left that can for another time since it might be more than a 1.0 clarification. 
ACTION: 2001-06-29#5: Jan Grant, Eric Miller, Martyn Horner: generate use cases and requirements for language (xml:lang) and literals. 
Changing time of face-to-face meeting - Frank Manola Brian McBride - no, the meeting will remain 1 and 2 August 2001 as previously decided since several people have already booked travel and accommodation. 
Date of next meeting: In one week at 2001-07-06, 10am Boston time, same place. 
To be confirmed due to US national holiday on 2001-07-04 Eric Miller: probable regrets I'm sorry to do this two weeks in a row, but I'll probably not be able to make this one either. 
#g Graham Klyne Baltimore Technologies Strategic Research Content Security Group Per last week's teleconference notes, Here is a simple example of a particular use case and requirements for supporting language in RDF: DCMI Multiple Languages Special Interest Group The mission of the Special Interest Group on Dublin Core in Multiple Languages is to coordinate the development of the Dublin Core as a multilingual metadata standard. 
As of June 1998, our focus is on creating a distributed registry of Dublin Core in multiple languages using the Resource Description Framework (RDF), an emerging standard syntax for expressing metadata schemas on the Web. -- http://dublincore.org/groups/languages/ which has direct implications/requirements on the DCMI Registry group The DCMI Registry Working Group aims to establish a metadata registry to support the activity of the DCMI. 
Exploration of the role of a DCMI registry is becoming a priority task in order to manage Dublin Core elements and qualifiers as they are used and adapted for an increasingly diverse set of applications. 
-- http://dublincore.org/groups/registry/ a prototype registry services (registry here is the web.. really what this is is a database of RDF Schemas) is available at and if you search for 'creator' (for example) you would find Item # 1 rdf:label Author/Creator rdf:label Verfasser oder Urheber rdf:label Cr?ateur etc.etc.etc. 
This service is made up of loading RDF Schemas that have been created by people in the DCMI Multiple Languages Special Interest Group. 
Ideally each of these schemas would be maintained by organizations committed to long term persistence of these vocabularies. 
Unfortunately, these policies have not yet been articulated and agreed upon as the schemas that were used to load this prototype service are no longer available in their declared location. 
Sample search scenarios for this kind of service might be on the order of: 'show me the french representation of the dc:title element' 'show me the DCES in german' eric miller http://www.w3.org/people/em/ semantic web activity lead mailto:em@w3.org
