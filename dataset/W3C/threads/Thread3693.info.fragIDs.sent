<s> All: I have posted the skeleton of a document for classifying our Usage Scenarios, as we discussed in the last teleconference.  </s>
<s> In this version I have included four broad categories that I was able to identify.  </s>
<s> Additional categorization is inevitable.  </s>
<s> Our plan, as you probably recall, is to discuss specific activities for the TF to undertake based on the scenarios we have in hand.  </s>
<s> In particular, we will want to look at the language/locale/preferences related issues.  </s>
<s> The document is located here: http://www.w3.org/International/ws/ws-i18n-scenarios-edit/scenarios-classification.html  </s>
<s> Note that this document is very very rough in form.  </s>
<s> I'll be cleaning it up over the holiday break.  </s>
<s> The word "moo" is a placeholder, for example, not a comment.  </s>
<s> ;-).  </s>
<s> As always, comments and suggestions are welcome.  </s>
<s> Best Regards, Addison Addison P. Phillips Director, Globalization Architecture webMethods, Inc. Internationalization is an architecture.  </s>
<s> It is not a feature.  </s>

<s> Hello Addison, I haven't checked the details of your document yet, but it looks quite good to me.  </s>
<s> But please be aware that the section numbers we have won't be stable.  </s>
<s> If we just insert one new use case somewhere, all the numbers may change.  </s>
<s> We should add somewhat memorable id's in the xml source, so that we can use these, or put the information about these classifications directly into our document.  </s>
<s> Regards, Martin.  </s>
<s> Hello Addison, Martin, This classification is nice reference for WSTF future activities.  </s>
<s> You mentioned it was rough draft, but let me incorporate your document into the editor's copy so that reader can reach each section by clicking section numbers easily.  </s>
<s> For the present, I added the classification into the "A Deliverables Classification (Non-Normative)" of the latest editor's copy.  </s>
<s> Thanks, Kentaroh Kentaroh Noji : nojik@jp.ibm.com  </s>
<s> Hi Addison, et al, I've just dug out from a consulting gig and the holidays ... I really like the simplicity and completeness of the the usage scenario classifications, however, I have a minor comment to the wording for Best Practices.  </s>
<s> For "Best Practices", I would change: "End users" means people who are creating Web services.  </s>
<s> That is, these are guidelines for making an internationalized Web service using existing standards.  </s>
<s> to: "End users" means people who are creating, offering, or integrating Web services.  </s>
<s> That is, these are guidelines for making or using an internationalized Web service using existing standards.  </s>
<s> Cheers, Mike___  </s>
