Hi, An experienced web developer friend asked me about accessibility in web forms, which I found was highlighted and covered in this example and article. 
If possible I?d like someone with more speech reader knowledge and experience than myself to answered some of the following? 
First, if you have a two choice question answered via radio buttons, does it read as a question when the query is in the legend field, followed by the correctly marked up radio buttons. 
In otherwords, does legend followed by two labelled radio buttons, enclosed in fieldset , read that way? 
Also, I have seen advice where one should always place the field label before the field so that the user of the speech reader hears the label before the reader focuses on the input field. 
But it seems to me that if the label element is used correctly, it does not matter how they arranged; before or after, or within table cells, because any action on the label will be transferred to the associate input field. 
Is this correct? 
But then again, users must be so used to forms designed without use of such markup, they may not even know that the form has been designed with accessibility in mind. 
Is that a problem, or do they know that forms are accessible friendly when they encounter them? 
What about when a field is mandatory? 
The standard way of indicating this is with an asterisk after the label. 
For accessibility this should precede any other information in the label so that the user knows that what follows is mandatory. 
So what special techniques can others share with this? 
Is there a way of showing the asterisk last for sighted readers yet sounding it first for people using speech readers? 
The obvious first thought is via 
tabindex, but label doesn?t have a tabindex attribute. 
Simple code example 1 type="radio" / /label type="radio" / /label or Simple code example 2 (is one preferable to the other or it doesn?t matter?) Regards, Geoff Deering 
One method I've been using lately (admittedly as an experiment to see what is possible) is to wrap all mandatory form items in a fieldset with a legend that indicates the form controls are Required Information, and another fieldset that groups the Optional Information. 
Loosely: Form contents here More form contents here 
Its certainly not always easy to group forms like this, but I felt the 
construct was worth working with, as it can benefit all users, including those using some adaptive technology. 
One advantage I've found is that JAWS will read the legend text for that fieldset before reading the label on the form controls. 
This seems to be a default setting in JAWS, although I can't confirm that right now. 
In any case -- just one possibility for providing them the information that those form controls are mandatory that doesn't require an asterisk. 
Just my 2cents... Best regards, Derek.

If it were, it would be done by mainstream sites (without the fieldset) because putting frequently used fields first is good usability and usability is a lot easier to sell to businesses than accessibility. 
It's not done because there are conflicting usablity requirements.

Can you please say more about this because by and large I just don't think there is a lot of usability applied to most forms. 
There are so many mixed metaphors, many of the behaviours we see on the web show a lack of 
understanding of basic interface guidelines for software design. 
So which conflicting usability requirements are you referring too? 
Geoff 
Yes. If you give a web 'designer' a brief to design a form, this is likely what you will get; they like playing with obscure metaphors. 
However, if you go to the person who commissioned the design (but before it goes live) you can probably convince them that putting commonly used fields first is something they should instruct the designer to do, but you will probably have to threaten them with legislation for them to provide accessible pages. 
The difference is that usability is perceived as increasing the number of purchases by free spending customers, whereas accessibility is considered an expensive feature for an unproductive part of the market. 
The conflict is that there may be natural groupings or orderings, e.g. it makes sense to put landline and mobile phone numbers together, even if only the landline number is mandatory.
