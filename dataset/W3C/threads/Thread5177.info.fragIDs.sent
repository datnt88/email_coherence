<s> After chatting with Norm, Stuart, Bijan, and Sandro,  </s>
<s> I offer to host a one hour teleconference Friday, September 26, 2003, at 15:30:00 UTC time Chicago Fri 10:30 AM  </s>
<s> London Fri 4:30 PM Boston Fri 11:30 AM provided an agreeable agenda emerges 24 hours in advance.  </s>
<s> I invite telcon chair nominations.  </s>
<s> Chair duties include preparing an agenda, sending it out (including logistics details) 24 hours in advance, and encouraging the group  </s>
<s> to follow it during the meeting.  </s>
<s> Note that sandro and I have offered to co-chair this sw-meaning forum, but there hasn't been any particular feedback on that offer.  </s>
<s> I'm OK with the group remaining largely chairless, but *somebody* has to hit "send" on an agenda 24 hours before this telcon, per W3C process (which I think is well-motivated in at least this case).  </s>
<s> If I'm chosen as chair for this telcon, I'm not likely to put a lot of energy into organizing the agenda in advance.  </s>
<s> It'll likely go like this: 1. round the table.  </s>
<s> each person gets 2 or 3 minutes.  </s>
<s> You can use the time for whatever you like, but timing will be strict.  </s>
<s> an IRC bot will collect agenda requests while we do that 2. I'll briefly review the resulting agenda and sort it, with input from those on the call 3. we'll discuss the items on that list in order until we run out of time.  </s>

<s> Hmm. Given the lack of response, are we having a telecon?  </s>
<s> Is there even a bridge available?  </s>
<s> I haven't volunteered for any chairing roles because I expect to be a vocal proponent of one point of view, and I don't think that this is particularly compatible with being a chair.  </s>
<s> I'll reluctantly do some chairing work to get things started, but would like to quickly go back to being a proponent.  </s>

<s> Well, not today; 26 Sep is a week from today.  </s>
<s> The bridge is reserved, yes.  </s>
<s> I feel much the same way, but volunteered to (co-)chair anyway.  </s>
<s> I remain hopeful that we can keep a sort of round-table configuration without much need for a chair.  </s>

<s> Perhaps we should have a round where we all reluctantly offer to chair, or offer to reluctantly chair?  </s>
<s> :)  </s>
<s> If so, here's my hat for hire as well.  </s>
<s> But if I have to suggest, I would say that neither Peter nor DanC should chair, given that Peter has a coherent proposal and Dan historically has been an issue raiser.  </s>
<s> Sandro says he doesn't have a position to argue, so, I nominate him as chair.  </s>
<s> That way, I can still be gadfly :) If it turns out we need more than minimal chairing, we can revisit.  </s>
<s> Cheers, Bijan Parsia.  </s>
<s> I suspect that the table will rapidly acquire a different shape and that people will find their own places on it.  </s>
