<s> Just 2 small comments on the DOM Level 1 document as of 9th of October draft.  </s>
<s> 1.  </s>
<s> It could be useful (if not necessary?) to have some kind of "mustOmitEndTag" attribute for the Element interface, so that an exact re-creation of the source document could be done without access to the DocumentType.  </s>
<s> 2. The definition of a read-only subset of the DOM may be useful, but this is straightforward to do, and probably out-of-scope here.  </s>
<s> -Stephane Bidoul sbi@acse.be  </s>
<s> In XML, any element can have an end-tag, (including empty elements) so mustOmitEndTag would always be false.  </s>
<s> Paul Prescod  </s>
<s> Being able to recreate the source document (with or without access to the DocumentType) is not a goal/requirement of the DOM.  </s>
<s> Structural isomorphism certainly is though!!!  </s>
