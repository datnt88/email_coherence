You can start playing with the WAI Report Form at You can view reports that other have filled at I suggest we have a beta test period of the system where people use dummy or empty webmaster email (that do not go anywhere), until we declare it stable. 
Send your comments on the form to the w3c-wai-er-ig@w3.org 
list 
Daniel, Thanks for the form. 
It's very handy for the email to have links to point to the guidelines. 
Here's some other comments minor: 
- insert http:// if absent... or just prepopulate the form with http:// 
- lynx 2.8 missing from browser list 
- not clear what to do to enter "other browser" since first checkbox winds up labeled "irrelevant". 
- on second page "has been found to have to one or more accessibily problems." 
typo (accessibily) 
more significant: 
- need room for comments (the spot for "other" doesn't seem appropriate" 
- list of possible problems is rather long. 
Would help to group the items 
- You suggest we don't want it to actually go to webmaster at this point, but it filled in the author field so it looks like it's going there. 
I'd suggest disabling that feature for now in case we fail to change it. 
- In a screen reader the (?) links will not be heard if punctuation is turned off. 
Change to some word, e.g. "help". 
Or, better yet, use image of ? 
with alt text. 
Hmmm. 
Should it be "help for X" (where X = alt text, color, etc) to make link comprehensible when read alone or just "help" to avoid redundancy. 
out of left field: - this page constructs horizontal separator bars by coloring a table cell. 
This separator is needed to help user perceive grouping. 
Not clear where to put this problem. 
It isn't really "poor color scheme". 
Actually, this isn't in the guidelines as far as I can see either; e.g. it isn't really "don't rely on color alone" either. 
Will need to contact GL. 
Well, there's always "other". 
One moral here is that no set of guidelines can ever match just trying out the page with lynx, a screenreader, or, better yet, a bunch of access methods.

[only following up on ER] Thanks for the review Len. 
I don't like text field with http:// added by default, as I (as a user on the web) have to remove it all the time when I do a copy/paste from my browser (which already has it) but yes I could add http:// if not present. 
yes, the list needs rework, it is still the original from the early draft, I also want to add more subjective rating entries (for physical and cognitive) 
I could change "Irrevelant" to "Pick one" for a better UI ? 
As soon as you enter text in the "Other Browser" text field, it overrides the menu choice. 
oops 
one of the original idea behind the form was not to make it a free form letter going thru w3c to the webmaster (liability issue: people being rude, etc) that explains this limit to a short comment (not a solution to this issue I know) other idea ? 
we could make 2 lines and see if we have problem when it's being used we could label it "Personal comments" in the email sent. 
I'm not sure. 
what do others think ? 
image + alt looks good, or just help 
yes, I don't pretend to cover all the checkpoints. 
this is just an initial list, as we go, we'll revise the list to include more of what the "others" come to be
