<s> You can start playing with the WAI Report Form at You can view reports that other have filled at I suggest we have a beta test period of the system where people use dummy or empty webmaster email (that do not go anywhere), until we declare it stable.  </s>

<s> list  </s>
<s> Daniel, Thanks for the form.  </s>
<s> It's very handy for the email to have links to point to the guidelines.  </s>
<s> Here's some other comments minor:  </s>
<s> - insert http:// if absent... or just prepopulate the form with http://  </s>
<s> - lynx 2.8 missing from browser list  </s>
<s> - not clear what to do to enter "other browser" since first checkbox winds up labeled "irrelevant".  </s>
<s> - on second page "has been found to have to one or more accessibily problems."  </s>
<s> typo (accessibily)  </s>
<s> more significant:  </s>
<s> - need room for comments (the spot for "other" doesn't seem appropriate"  </s>
<s> - list of possible problems is rather long.  </s>
<s> Would help to group the items  </s>
<s> - You suggest we don't want it to actually go to webmaster at this point, but it filled in the author field so it looks like it's going there.  </s>
<s> I'd suggest disabling that feature for now in case we fail to change it.  </s>
<s> - In a screen reader the (?) links will not be heard if punctuation is turned off.  </s>
<s> Change to some word, e.g. "help".  </s>
<s> Or, better yet, use image of ?  </s>
<s> with alt text.  </s>
<s> Hmmm.  </s>
<s> Should it be "help for X" (where X = alt text, color, etc) to make link comprehensible when read alone or just "help" to avoid redundancy.  </s>
<s> out of left field: - this page constructs horizontal separator bars by coloring a table cell.  </s>
<s> This separator is needed to help user perceive grouping.  </s>
<s> Not clear where to put this problem.  </s>
<s> It isn't really "poor color scheme".  </s>
<s> Actually, this isn't in the guidelines as far as I can see either; e.g. it isn't really "don't rely on color alone" either.  </s>
<s> Will need to contact GL.  </s>
<s> Well, there's always "other".  </s>
<s> One moral here is that no set of guidelines can ever match just trying out the page with lynx, a screenreader, or, better yet, a bunch of access methods.  </s>

<s> [only following up on ER] Thanks for the review Len.  </s>
<s> I don't like text field with http:// added by default, as I (as a user on the web) have to remove it all the time when I do a copy/paste from my browser (which already has it) but yes I could add http:// if not present.  </s>
<s> yes, the list needs rework, it is still the original from the early draft, I also want to add more subjective rating entries (for physical and cognitive)  </s>
<s> I could change "Irrevelant" to "Pick one" for a better UI ?  </s>
<s> As soon as you enter text in the "Other Browser" text field, it overrides the menu choice.  </s>
<s> oops  </s>
<s> one of the original idea behind the form was not to make it a free form letter going thru w3c to the webmaster (liability issue: people being rude, etc) that explains this limit to a short comment (not a solution to this issue I know) other idea ?  </s>
<s> we could make 2 lines and see if we have problem when it's being used we could label it "Personal comments" in the email sent.  </s>
<s> I'm not sure.  </s>
<s> what do others think ?  </s>
<s> image + alt looks good, or just help  </s>
<s> yes, I don't pretend to cover all the checkpoints.  </s>
<s> this is just an initial list, as we go, we'll revise the list to include more of what the "others" come to be  </s>
