i just realized that i had not stated that this is on the Win9x platform. 
other viewers may not be seeing this. 
and i thought that the index file might be a html doc and as such that i could read the source to find the reqd name ( and purhaps a temporary workaround thru css to cure problem) however when in index i can't view source (it is grayed out) so that ends that effort .... rats.

I'm running under XP, with the same problem. 
To get around it for now, go to the Views menu, and Zoom In. 
It's most certainly GNU/Linux, not Linux!

file (Style  Open  Confirm) 4. Modify level1 and level2 classes padding-bottom and padding-top to 0px (from -4px) 5. Save index.css 
Best regards, Barto On Thu, 24 Apr 2003 10:12:24 -0400 A better solution is to edit the CSS file Amaya/doc/html/index.css and remove lines: .level1{ 
padding-bottom : -4px; padding-top : -4px; .level2{ 
padding-bottom : -4px; padding-top : -4px; It's now fixed in the CVS base.
