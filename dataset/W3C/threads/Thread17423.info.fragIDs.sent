<s> BlankAny one want to guess whose site this coding was lifted from?  </s>
<s> Am I unique in my feeling of deja vu?  </s>
<s> I know, a bit like asking how long is a piece of string, however The paralympic version of the site (oops!! given the game away) has alt tags or to all you purists alternative attributes, that are of a cryptic one word nature.  </s>
<s> They cover the mandate, but are they informative enough?  </s>
<s> There is an argument they could also be misleading.  </s>
<s> For example closing my eyes and reading the alt tag on one image says football, picture in mind of spherical object made of leather.  </s>
<s> nothing is further from the truth.  </s>

<s> oops! and sorry all, I should explain.  </s>
<s> I had my property development hat on yesterday so was very strapped for time.  </s>
<s> The site is http://www.paralympic.org/  </s>
<s> The images on the site must have been changed yesterday.  </s>
<s> My original posting referred to an index page that had an image of two guys playing soccer, the alt tag said "football" the particular image I used as an example is no longer displayed on the page.  </s>
<s> Thats all, now where's that paint brush...? [John]  </s>
<s> So is there a list/site of 'good practice' with ALT?  </s>
<s> Just how much/little should one put into an ALT tag, how much in TITLE, and when should LONGDESC be used?  </s>
<s> ALT is used (incorrectly) as a tooltip in IE6, unless there's a TITLE as well.  </s>
<s> Other browsers get it right by using the TITLE as a tooltip alone.  </s>
<s> Reason for the question is that none of the searches I've done say anything about the content of the various tags (O.K. Attributes) but concentrate on what they do.  </s>
<s> Seems that everyone has says that you have to but no-one has said what to do.  </s>
