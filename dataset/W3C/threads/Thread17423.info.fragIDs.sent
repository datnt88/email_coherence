BlankAny one want to guess whose site this coding was lifted from? 
Am I unique in my feeling of deja vu? 
I know, a bit like asking how long is a piece of string, however The paralympic version of the site (oops!! given the game away) has alt tags or to all you purists alternative attributes, that are of a cryptic one word nature. 
They cover the mandate, but are they informative enough? 
There is an argument they could also be misleading. 
For example closing my eyes and reading the alt tag on one image says football, picture in mind of spherical object made of leather. 
nothing is further from the truth.

oops! and sorry all, I should explain. 
I had my property development hat on yesterday so was very strapped for time. 
The site is http://www.paralympic.org/ 
The images on the site must have been changed yesterday. 
My original posting referred to an index page that had an image of two guys playing soccer, the alt tag said "football" the particular image I used as an example is no longer displayed on the page. 
Thats all, now where's that paint brush...? [John] 
So is there a list/site of 'good practice' with ALT? 
Just how much/little should one put into an ALT tag, how much in TITLE, and when should LONGDESC be used? 
ALT is used (incorrectly) as a tooltip in IE6, unless there's a TITLE as well. 
Other browsers get it right by using the TITLE as a tooltip alone. 
Reason for the question is that none of the searches I've done say anything about the content of the various tags (O.K. Attributes) but concentrate on what they do. 
Seems that everyone has says that you have to but no-one has said what to do.
