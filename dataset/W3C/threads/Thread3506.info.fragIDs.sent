All, If you are coming to the I18n Web Services Task Force face-to-face meeting next week, please let me know BY FRIDAY, OCTOBER 3, 8AM PACIFIC DAYLIGHT TIME and tell me the following: 1. Do you have any dietary restrictions? 
2. Do you drink a hot drink other than coffee? 
3. Do you need transportation from your hotel to the Sun campus? 
If so, what hotel are you staying at?

My wish has come true. 
I no longer know how to use my telephone.
