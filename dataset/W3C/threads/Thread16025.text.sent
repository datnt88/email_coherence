Tables add to the file size and can be aproblem with accessibility if nto used properly. 
In a rapid application environment, universal accessibility items can be missed when there are updates and tables compound the review process - if there is one. 
Basically, the less there, the easier it is to maintain. the most accessible accolade I give this site is tables were not used for layout, only data. 
So here is an example of a functional web site. 
The target audience was unions and coporation who needed access to information (and the public). 
We never received a bad comment and only received thanks for making a web site that downloads fast, and is functional and usable, where information is easy to find. 
In regrards the statment on the use of deprecated HTML elements, will let Jamie speak to this as I am no longer there. 
If they were a part of the original design, then I missed this in the quality assurance review. 
Then again, we were flying and also the Guildelines were draft back then and the revisions were a moving target smile . 
But deprecated has alway been a part of HTML 4. rob w3c-wai-gl@w3.org 
In the case of the example you provided, your page appears to be fully accessible, but it uses deprecated HTML elements to control the appearance of the page. 
Here, CSS would be required. 
Or, simply strip out the deprecated elements, and you're fine without CSS. 
Question: Is the page with CSS instead of the HTML more accessible, less accessible, or equally accessible? 
Can you explain exactly how the accessibility has been noticeably improved in this case? 
Note that there may be a choice between "having this look the same in Netscape 3.0 and Netscape 4.0" and "making a very minor increase in accessibility." 
For some agencies or companies, the tiny benefit is not worth the cost of losing support for Netscape 3.0.

Can we put this in 3.3, "use CSS to control layout and presentation and practice safe styling" sorry folks, couldnt resist. 
its saturday and i am at work ugh Guidelines The guidelines state "use CSS to control layout and presentation". 
This means it is possible to create a page which does not use any particular presentation control (which is what I normally do) and to attach a stylesheet which provides safe styling if you want. 
Question: Does the HTML Writers Guild's homepage, at It uses both HTML _and_ CSS for layout and presentation.

Adam, "3.3 Use style sheets to control layout and presentation. 
[Priority 2]" sounds very definitive to me. 
It does not say, Style Sheets may be used to control layout and presentation." 
Lets substititue words, "Use both hands to control the saw" smile . 
I can cut with wood with a saw using one hand, but this wording does not give me an option to use one hand or HTML 4 done properly. 
Once more, I fear managers will read 3.3 literaly. 
I know I do.

rob if i strip out the out the deprecated elements, I am fine without CSS, but then I did not use a style sheet. 
thanks, rob How does every one feel, if we were to make a separate checkpoint section for all CSS relaed items? 
We could even put check point 11.1 as the lead checkpoint for this CSS. 
That way, "Use W3C technologies when they are available and appropriate for a task and use the latest versions when supported" is up front and if someone chooses not to use CSS then this whole section becomes "Not applicable". 
Thanks to Judy for pointing out Checkpoint 11.1 smile . 
my difficulty now is if i am rating a site's conformance or if some one is rating this for me, then we really have to dig and causes extra work. 
We need to streamline the review process as I am sure other people besides me would appreciate this! 
I think we can look at this from a usability focus. 
Basically CSS is all over and rightly so, but does it make sense to centralize this? 
rob My thanks to the authors of URL: Given the intricacies of the WCAG, I think one would be hard pressed to create a more streamlined tool!
