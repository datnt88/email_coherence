In an effort to assist developers and designers in understanding detailed issues when working with web standards, WaSP and the W3C kick off a new project today. 
The project, "WaSP Asks the W3C" involves WaSP Steering Committee members culling questions from supporters and asking members of the W3C's Quality Assurance Group for insight and details. 
WaSP hopes you'll find the project worthwhile. 
The first article is on properly specifying character sets. 
Discussion can take place here. 
Looking forward to your thoughts, Molly Molly E. Holzschlag Education Director World Organization of Webmasters Author / Instructor / Web Designer web: http://www.molly.com/ 
There are several ways of specifying the character set for a particular document. 
Which of the following methods (or combination thereof) does the W3C recommend, and why? 
* Have the server administrator set the proper encoding via the HTTP headers returned by the Web server * Have the author add the encoding with a meta element * XHTML authors can add the character encoding using the XML prolog The term "character set" should be avoided, see http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/html-spec/charset-harmful.html . 
The third item should be rephrased to match the prolog. 
It should be "XML declaration", not "XML prolog". 
These three ways of providing the character encoding of a document are not equivalent. 
When trying to figure out the character encoding of a resource, user agents will try, in this order: * The HTTP Content-Type header sent by the server * The XML declaration (only for XHTML documents) * The HTML/XHTML meta element * Other ways. 
There are algorithms to guess the character encoding, for example The XML declaration should be ignored for XHTML documents delievered as text/html (the HTML WG says, user agents should not use any heuristics to determine whether a document is HTML or XHTML and thus parse all XHTML documents delivered as text/html as beeing HTML and thus processing instructions (the XML declaration is a processing instruction from an HTML point-of-view) are to be ignored) (and this is what most user agents do), this information should be added to the document, it is otherwise confusing. 
However, in at least two cases, this is simply not possible: * The document author does not have any way to configure the server to send the proper HTTP Content-Type header * The document is not served via HTTP. 
It's a standalone document, or served via MIME MIME also has a Content-Type header, hence this is not a valid exception. 
In these cases, an HTML document should provide the character encoding via a meta element, and an XML document must provide it via the XML declaration. 
No, XML documents do not need to have an XML declaration in these cases if they are encoded using one of the default encodings (us-ascii for text/xml, utf-8 or utf-16 for most other cases). 
Example of an HTML 4.01 document written in French with a UTF-8 encoding: !DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd" qui, en moi, t'entretiennent ; br / tu n'es pas non plus mienne br / par la force d'un beau d?sir. 
/p The " br / "s have to be " br "s. regards. 
What's the current status of this project? 
Hi Bjoern, This is so interesting that you ask this today. 
I was coordinating this for WaSP, but things got busy and you know how that goes. 
Just yesterday I referred someone to the article we did back in December, and I realized that this was a very worthy project and I would like to resume working on it. 
That said, I do have a good follow-up article that I was working on with Olivier and Karl, so I will commit to finishing that and publishing it on the WaSP site. 
I'm really grateful you asked this question because combined with my thought only yesterday it confirms my sense that this is a very good opportunity and one that I don't want to see lost by the wayside. 
The help I could use here would be a list of great topic ideas, this way we can put together an editorial calendar of sorts and work on a topic a month. 
I look forward to everyone's thoughts!

The WASP doesn't do anything. 
The last thing we have sent has not been published by the WASP. 
We are still waiting for something. 
We don't even have answers to emails. 
I guess it's an organization problem on the WASP side :/ Hope they will move.
