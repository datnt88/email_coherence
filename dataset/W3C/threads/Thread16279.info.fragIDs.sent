<s> Hi Leslie, Yes, Word format is a problem.  </s>
<s> Putting it on the web in HTML is good (means much faster email downloads), and sending it to the list in text or HTML format (if it isn't too long) may also be an option.  </s>
<s> It would also be helpful if you included a short note saying what the paper was about.  </s>

<s> Charles, It is actually 12 pages.  </s>
<s> Much to long for a text attachment at the end of my message.  </s>
<s> I could convert it to HTML but I am not sure what that would do for the download process?  </s>
<s> It is part of my Masters Thesis.  </s>
<s> I work for the Transit Agency here is SLC and have noticed that not much emphasis was being placed on information accessibility, only on transit accessibility.  </s>
<s> So in my trade I am trying to make the rest stand up and notice.  </s>
<s> Once the paper is presentable, I plan on making every effort possible to get the transit agencies on board as well.  </s>

<s> Leslie, This is a good place to ask, because the Interest Group is to find out how the organization works and what we are working on.  </s>
<s> Since you are working to write an article which will raise awareness, it will likely be used as a reference by people who first learn about accessibility when they read it.  </s>
<s> Thus it would be good for you to work with the Education and Outreach Working Group of the WAI.  </s>
<s> That is our group that deals specifically with public information and training resources.  </s>
<s> Check their home page at http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/ or write to Judy Brewer jbrewer@w3.org , who chairs that group, to ask if they would review your paper or how you can best work with them in spreading the word.  </s>
