<s> Hi, is it possible to set a preference for including the ?xml  </s>
<s> ...? directive at the start of XML documents?  </s>
<s> There are some browsers and other applications that misinterpret it, and I believe that it is optional according to the XML specification.  </s>
<s> So if it were possible to leave it out, this wuld make it easier to work with other (admmittedly badly implemented, but widespread) technology.  </s>
<s> My specific problem is for php processing - the fact that Amaya allows me to edit PHP documents is a great help, but at the moment I need to edit this line in the source before finally saving :( Cheers  </s>

<s> Hi Charles, The "save as in HTML" is exactly what you want to do.  </s>
<s> Isn't it?  </s>

<s> I don't know - I thought that that converted the document type to an HTML one, which I don't want to do.  </s>
<s> I'll look into it - maybe I can just do that.  </s>
<s> thanks Chaals  </s>

<s> A document without neither xml declaration and nor doctype is probably parsed as an HTML document by a lot of browsers.  </s>
