Hi "The term stylesheet reflects the fact that one of the important roles of XSLT is to add styling information to an XML source document, by transforming it into a document consisting of XSL formatting objects (see [XSL Formatting Objects]), or into another presentation-oriented format such as HTML, XHTML, or SVG." Current versions of HTML/XHTML are (luckily) only marginally concerned with presentation, but mainly with structure and semantics. 
(Future versions hopefully and most likely will be purely about semantics and structure.) So I suggest to change the text, and to not list HTML and XHTML as "presentation-oriented format"s. 
BTW, instead of URLs like Tobi The reason for converting a document to HTML/XHTML is almost without exception in order to present it to a human reader. 
I agree that the presentation is described at a fairly abstract level, but it's still presentation. 
I've recently gone through the XML to make sure that all sections have meaningful IDs. 
Thanks for the comment. 
Michael Kay Yes, but HTML markup can either contain presentational (styling) markup, or not. 
But "presentational" in an HTML context clearly is referring to the differentiation between styling (layout and design) vs structure and semantics: "In general, authors should use style sheets to achieve stylistic and formatting effects rather than HTML presentational attributes. 
HTML presentational attributes have been deprecated when style sheet alternatives exist" ... and not referring to differentiation between human target vs software reader (parser). 
And even in this context: (X)HTML is first read (parsed) by software. 
Also in the the text I quoted, there is "add styling information to an XML source document", which should *not* be the case when transforming *XML to (X)HTML. 
This practice is deprecated, less supported in current versions of (X)HTML, and most likely will not be supported in future versions of XHTML. 
I suggest to change "The term stylesheet reflects the fact that one of the important roles of XSLT is to add styling information to an XML source document, by transforming it into a document consisting of XSL formatting objects (see [XSL Formatting Objects]), or into another presentation-oriented format such as HTML, XHTML, or SVG. 
However, XSLT is used for a wide range of XML-to-XML transformation tasks, not exclusively for formatting and presentation applications."

My pleasure, happy to be of help. 
Tobi As an aside, in the customisation of the xmlspec stylesheets used for the mathml spec I modified the code to use xsl:number rather than generate-id for generating html ids when no id is given in the source. 
so you end up with things like for section 5.3.2. 
If thinking of names for all sections in all the xslt/xquery documents is too burdensome this might be an option for you as well (or for the default xmlspec stylesheets). 
Actually I have thought about _always_ using this form even if there is an id in the source so that you can tell the URI ref to a section just from looking at the displayed document rather than having to view the source to find the internal ID.
