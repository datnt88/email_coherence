<s> I'm struggling to wrap my mind around both the XML-Signature CR and the canonicalization REC, so please bear with me if this is a dumb question.  </s>
<s> Background item 1: Sections 2.1 and 6.5.1 give examples of the CanonicalizationMethod element like the following: CanonicalizationMethod Algorithm="http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-xml-c14n-20010315"/  </s>
<s> Background item 2: Section 1.1 of the Canonical XML Version 1.0 Recommendation states, "Empty elements are converted to start-end tag pairs," and the processing model for element nodes described in section 2.3 ensures that this is the case.  </s>
<s> Query: Are the XML-Signature examples correct?  </s>
<s> It seems to me that they should read: CanonicalizationMethod Algorithm="http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-xml-c14n-20010315" /Canonicalizati onMethod and that other empty elements (SignatureMethod, Transform, DigestMethod) in the example in section 2.1 should likewise be represented as start-end tag pairs.  </s>
<s> If this is not the case, what have I missed?  </s>

<s> Examples in the dsig spec are not canonicalized.  </s>
<s> I added a sentence to [s03], "Note that this example, and all examples in this specification, are not in canonical form."  </s>

<s> That makes sense for all examples except the two I cited.  </s>
<s> Since those are examples of specifying a CanonicalizationMethod, shouldn't they be represented using that method?  </s>
<s> It seems confusing to give examples that are invalid.  </s>
<s> If I understand the spec correctly, you couldn't actually validate the example in 2.1, which is represented as a (presumably correct) detached signature of the content of the XHTML 1.0 recommendation.  </s>

<s> There is no need for the SignedInfo to be in canonical form if the SignatureValue was calculated using the canonical form and is verified using the canonical form.  </s>
<s> That this was done for generation and is to be done for verification is whatthe content of CanonicalizationMethod means.  </s>
