Dear all, We have collected some network traces and have problems to interpret them. 
Perhaps you fellow WebDavers can provide us a helping hand: - Server response 1 adds some extra information after the XML body and does not add a content length attribute. 
How should/could one handle this? 
What does the "Trailer:" HTTP response attribute mean? 
(R1) - Are the DAV: properties within the XML body all valid (e.g. contentclass, nosubs, id, objectcount, isstructureddocument, uid, visiblecount and many more) or in what IETF document can they be found? 
(R1 and R2) - What does the xml: namespace have as valid properties and how are they related to DAV? (e.g. xml:v) (R1 and R2) - Where can we find a definition how to parse tags like DAV:ishidden b:dt="boolean" ? 
(R1) - Is it good behaviour to add so many additional namespaces, which obviously extend the original DAV protocol definition? 
(R2) - Should one mix different namespaces like in DAV:childcount b:dt="int" 13 /DAV:childcount (R2) Gerbert Request 1 (R1): SEARCH /TestWorkSpace/ HTTP/1.1 Content-Language: en-us Accept-Language: en-us Content-Length: 1007 Content-Type: text/xml Translate: f User-Agent: Microsoft Data Access Internet Publishing Provider DAV Host: kern2 Connection: Keep-Alive sql SELECT "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office#Description" , "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office#Title" , "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:publishing:Categories" , "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office#Author" , "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office#Keywords" , "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:publishing:documentstate" , "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:publishing:BaseDoc" , "DAV:resourcetype" , "DAV:isreadonly" , "DAV:isroot" , "DAV:ishidden" , "DAV:iscollection" , "DAV:displayname" , "DAV:getlastmodified" , "DAV:creationdate" , "DAV:getcontentlength" , "DAV:href" , "DAV:contentclass" , "DAV:getcontentlanguage" , "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:publishing:operationsallowed" , "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:publishing:IsAWorkingCopy" , "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:publishing:isdoclibrarycontent" FROM scope( 'shallow traversal of "http://kern2/TestWorkSpace/"' ) /sql HTTP/1.1 207 Multistatus Content-type: text/xml Transfer-Encoding: chunked Accept-Ranges: rows Content-Range: rows 0-12; total=13 MS-Search-MoreRows: f Trailer: MS-Search-HitVector, MS-Search-Status Server: Microsoft-IIS/5.0 Date: Tue, 16 Jan 2001 14:31:41 GMT MicrosoftTahoeServer: 1.0 Connection: close MS-Search-HitVector: MS-Search-Status: Request 2: PROPFIND /TestWorkSpace HTTP/1.1 Content-Language: en-us Accept-Language: en-us Content-Type: text/xml Translate: f Depth: 0 Content-Length: 0 User-Agent: Microsoft Data Access Internet Publishing Provider DAV Host: kern2 Connection: Keep-Alive Authorization: NTLM TlRMTVNTUAADAAAAGAAYAHAAAAAYABgAiAAAABIAEgBAAAAAEAAQAFIAAAAOAA4AYgAAAAAAAACg AAAABYKBAEgAWQBQAEUAUgBXAEEAVgBFAGcAZAByAG8AcwBjAGgAbABEAFIATwBTAEMASABMAE1S RM+hfoMHL7uQltwawXiju05yrFR9GzNT5zkk6fuFIQihILCFqGHR+zrTKaYzjU== HTTP/1.1 207 Multi-Status Server: Microsoft-IIS/5.0 Date: Tue, 16 Jan 2001 14:31:34 GMT MicrosoftTahoeServer: 1.0 Content-Type: text/xml Accept-Ranges: rows MS-WebStorage: 6.0.4539 Transfer-Encoding: chunked This is a base HTTP/1.1 thing, not a DAV thing.

However, since there is no publically available place where these properties are defined, it creates an interoperability problem for you. 
We have an activity to create a procedure for registering new properties, so that there will be a public repository of property definitions. 
Having now personally experienced the need for such a registration procedure, I'm hoping you'll feel motivated to contribute to this effort. 
I've been contacted by Dennis Hamilton, who is planning on taking the lead on this activity (I'm hoping to see an I-D from him in the near future). 
The ishidden property is defined in: 00.txt But, this is just an I-D, and is not normative. 
In an ideal world, Microsoft wouldn't have used the DAV: namespace for these properties until the WG agreed. 
Details on when to use the DAV: namespace should be part of the registration procedures document. 
Based on my recollection, this is allowed by the XML namespaces document.
