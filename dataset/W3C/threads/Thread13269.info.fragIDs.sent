Michael, i updated the algorithm. 
is this now correct? 
--wendy Technique 7.5.A [priority 2] Check auto-redirect attributes on META elements Evaluation: If a META element has a HTTP-EQUIV attribute and the value of that attribute is "refresh" then check if the element has a 'CONTENT' attribute with delay greater than 0. If the META element has a CONTENT attribute then check if the value of that attribute is a URL. 
If the CONTENT attribute does have a value of a URL (will contain the string "URL=") then it is an auto-redirect page and the HTTP-EQUIV and CONTENT attributes should be removed from the META element.

I think it's correct. 
Let me see if I can propose a clearer one (this combines Techniques 7.4.A and 7.5.A since they're so similar but should be separate in the doc): 1) If META element has a HTTP-EQUIV attribute whose value is "refresh" 2) Look at value of the CONTENT attribute 3) If string is just a number, this is an auto-refresh page, trigger Technique 7.4.A. 4) Otherwise, string should be either a URI or a URI and a number separated from each other by a semicolon. 
This is an auto-redirect page. 
If the number is greater than 0, trigger Technique 7.5.A. 
If there isn't a number, the default value is 0 so we don't need to trigger the error. 
Note: in the Technique associated with the WCAG checkpoint (http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT-TECHS/#auto-page-refresh) it does not mention the presence of the string "URL=" in the value of the CONTENT attribute. 
The HTTP1.1 spec doesn't mention REFRESH at all so no help there. 
When Chris and I took an early pass through the doc one or the other of us had found the usage of "URL=", but given the WCAG Technique I'm not sure we can rely on that as a distinguishing feature, unless we discover they made a mistake in their example. 
Perhaps they can point us to the resource they used when making their example. 
By they way, any of the other Techniques you sent out up to now that I didn't respond to were ones I felt were ok as you described - didn't want to clutter the list with confirmations.

I propose that the evaluation for checkpoint 7.4.1 reads: This technique will be triggered by: A META element with an "http-equiv=refresh" attribute value and a "content" attribute integer value greater than 0. If the "content" attribute is a URI this is an auto-redirect page. 
Refer to technique 7.5.1 the evaluation for 7.5.1 would then read: This technique will be triggered by:A META element with the an "http-equiv=refresh" attribute value and a "content" attribute value of a URI.
