<s> Seems like a feature which would really help web-page response time using less resources than multiple simultaneous connections, but it seems to have never been adopted.  </s>
<s> I know of no browser that supports it.  </s>
<s> What are the "GOTCHAs" that keep it from being adopted?  </s>
<s> The biggest one that comes to mind is fact that one of the responses in the pipeline may not have a content-length.  </s>
<s> What could be done about that?  </s>

<s> The latest version of Opera uses pipelining.  </s>
<s> Use Transfer-Encoding: chunked.  </s>

<s> Thankyou for digging that up, but does it mean that by a server SHOULD or MUST use self-defined message lengths?  </s>
<s> This doesn't seem to give the browser author any assurance that his pipelined requests won't be aborted by a premature connection close due to a no CONTENT-LENGTH response.  </s>
<s> Seems to me that you only pipeline after you've gotton one request through a connection because you don't know whether the other end supports persistent connections.  </s>
<s> After that first request, which handles the negotiation, you'd like to be able to pipeline with worry about the pipeline being cut off.  </s>

<s> 04/27/2001 cc: 08:36 AM Subject: Re: Whatever happenned to HTTP 1.1 Pipelining I naturally thought about that, but is there anything is the RFC that says that Transfer-Encoding: chunked SHOULD or MUST be used on persistent HTTP 1.1 connections instead of sending with no content-length?  </s>

<s> Then they have to resend the requsts to which they have not received responses.  </s>
<s> This is why only idempotent requests can be pipelined.  </s>
<s> You always have to worry about the possibility that the pipeline is cut off.  </s>
