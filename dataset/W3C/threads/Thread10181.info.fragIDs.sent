<s> 2002-05-17#3 jjc Propose new text to describe serialization of b-nodes.  </s>
<s> Sorry I had forgotten this.  </s>
<s> Proposal: Delete section almost entirely, and just document what cannot be done.  </s>
<s> Rationale: we only owe the world an explanation of how to do what is unreasonably hard.  </s>
<s> There is published literature about RDF serialization, there is no need for the REC to duplicate this unless it is *necessary* for correct implementation.  </s>
<s> e.g. (sketch) Serialization There are certain RDF graphs which follow the abstract syntax that cannot be serialized in RDF/XML.  </s>
<s> These are those that: - use property names that do not end in a (possibly empty) sequence of NC_NAME characters precededed by an NC_NAMESTART character preceeded by a URI ref. i.e. those that do not match the regular expression: URIref NC_NAMESTART (NC_NAME *) or - use inappropriate reserved names as properties.  </s>
<s> Have I listed all the problem cases?  </s>
<s> If we wanted to reference my work on serialization, a short para like: Carroll [ref] discusses techniques to serialize RDF/XML in a fashion that uses  </s>
<s> the full range of grammar rules to create human readable output.  </s>
<s> Neutrally, I don't believe that that para is necessary, nor do I think it would be inappropriate.  </s>

<s> Me too.  </s>
<s> Excellent, I'll work this into the updated serialization section.  </s>
<s> s  </s>
<s> Your report is now of more historical interest :) in getting around the syntax without rdf:nodeID, but still worth citing for background to the issues.  </s>
<s> Dave  </s>
<s> I still think the heuristic of avoiding unnecessary rdf:nodeID is a useful one for readability ...  </s>
<s> Jeremy  </s>
<s> Espcially while there are plenty of RDF parsers out there that don't yet understand it... Dan  </s>
