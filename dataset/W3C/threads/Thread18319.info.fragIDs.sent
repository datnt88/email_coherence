<s> Hello, Per my action from the 17 November face-to-face meeting [1], please consider this proposal for addressing issue 348 [2] (characterized by Al as editorial).  </s>
<s> Checkpoint and other UAAG references here are with respect to the 23 October draft [3].  </s>
<s> [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/2000/11/minutes-20001116.html#issue-348 [2] http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#348 [3] http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-UAAG10-20001023/ Summary of the proposal: 1) Include requirements that the user agent provide mechanisms for highlighting selection, focus, recently visited links, and active elements.  </s>
<s> 2) Include requirements that, by default, the highlight mechanisms (whether visual or aural) for selection, focus, recently visited links, and active elements: a) Not rely on color alone.  </s>
<s> b) Differ from each other, and not by color alone.  </s>
<s> c) Differ in style from the user agent's default text style (e.g., color information, font information).  </s>
<s> 3) Include requirements that the user be able to configure how selection, focus, recently visited links, and active elements are highlighted.  </s>
<s> 4) Include a requirement that the user be able to configure the default foreground and background colors for visually rendered text.  </s>
<s> 5) Related ideas that are not requirements: a) Caution that user that if they override the defaults for any one of these mechanisms, they may have to pay attention to the others.  </s>
<s> b) Suggest that the user agent allow the user to configure them all at once.  </s>
<s> CHECKPOINTS: There is only one new checkpoint proposed (8.X, which is essentially factored out of several others).  </s>
<s> There are also some clarifications and harmonization done.  </s>
<s> 4.3 Allow the user to configure the foreground and background color of all text, with an option to override foreground and background colors specified by the author or user agent defaults.  </s>
<s> Allow the user to select from among the range of system colors.  </s>
<s> Note: User configuration of foreground and background colors may result in the inability to distinguish unhighlighted text from selected text, focused text, etc. See checkpoint 8.X for more information about highlight styles.  </s>
<s> [This proposal supersedes: 4.17 Allow the user to configure how the content focus and current selection are highlighted (e.g., through foreground and background color, voice pitch, etc.).  </s>
<s> Note: See checkpoint 8.X for more information about highlight styles.  </s>
<s> [This proposal is based on the version from the 14 December teleconf: 8.2 Provide a mechanism for highlighting recently visited links.  </s>
<s> Allow the user to configure the highlighting style.  </s>
<s> Note: See checkpoint 8.X for more information about highlight styles.  </s>
<s> 8.3 Provide a mechanism for highlighting links that have been marked up to indicate that following them will involve a fee ("fee links").  </s>
<s> Allow the user to configure the highlighting style.  </s>
<s> Note: See checkpoint 8.X for more information about highlight styles.  </s>
<s> [However, refer to proposal to demote 8.3 and add a config requirement: 8.7 Provide a mechanism for highlighting the current viewport.  </s>
<s> The default highlight mechanism must not rely on color alone.  </s>
<s> 8.8 Provide a mechanism for highlighting active elements.  </s>
<s> Allow the user to configure the highlighting style.  </s>
<s> Note: For example, most graphical user agents highlight all the links on a page so that users know where to interact.  </s>
<s> See checkpoint 8.X for more information about highlight styles.  </s>
<s> 8.X Ensure that the default highlight styles for the selection, focus, active elements, recently visited links, and fee links (1) do not rely on color alone, and (2) differ from each other and not by color alone.  </s>
<s> [Priority 1] Note: For instance, a graphical user agent by default might present the selection using color and a dotted outline, the focus using a solid outline, active elements as underlined in blue, recently visited links as dotted underlined in purple, and fee links using a special icon or flag to draw the user's attention.  </s>
<s> Note: If the user overrides the default styling for any one of these mechanisms, the new styling may interfere with the others.  </s>
<s> Therefore, the user agent should allow the user to configure them all at once or should alert the user to potential conflicts when change are made.  </s>
<s> ISSUES 1) For checkpoints 8.2, 8.3 and 8.8 (related to links and active elements): Does the user agent have to show all active zones of a client-size image map?  </s>
<s> Does the user agent have to highlight as a recently visited link a zone of an image map?  </s>
<s> Should these checkpoints refer to text links alone?  </s>
<s> OTHER COMMENTS 1) I support Jon's proposal to modify (essentially delete) checkpoint 8.6 (issue 421): Thank you, - Ian Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org) http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs Cell: +1 917 450-8783  </s>
<s> two comments.  </s>
<s> 1 what graphical user agent uses audio in this fashion since it is my impresion that we are modeling for graphical desktop user agents, do we need pitch? 2 could we have something a bit more clear than "fee link"?  </s>
<s> a fee link is not the same as one that is visitted or not visitted etc. this is a link that when followed does something specific and the designation of that link may change to visitted but still stays as a fee link.  </s>
<s> Thanks!  </s>
<s> Seems reasonable.  </s>
<s> I think that a user agent should be required to (be cnfigurable to) show active regions of an image map in some way.  </s>
<s> implementation example, Amaya.  </s>
<s> Otherwise it can be difficult for a sighted user to determine what regions exist, and where they go (this should have been done by the content author anyway, but it may not have, or may not be effective for some reason).  </s>
