Dear all, Few days ago, Ivan Herman informed the offices that there is a published version of the W3C Glossary. 
The application looks very nice indeed! 
Since I want to help with the work, I've briefly played with the application. 
Few comments in good faith: 1) Perhaps the introduction might want to briefly clarify the selection criteria for the terms (glossary sources)? 
It seems that some rather central specifications are not included (perhaps only for now, for technical reasons?). 
For instance, searching for the term "namespace" returns nothing. 
However, one might expect to be able to access the terminology of, e.g., XML 1.0 &amp; XML NS. 2) The Admin/Edit part seems to talk (also) about "concepts" while the intro talks about "terms". 
Why the difference? 
In addition, the very difficult issues related to the taxonomic differences and subclassing of terms, and the context of using them (e.g. "CEO concepts versus technical concepts") will probably be dealt with the ontology part? 
(Search e.g. for a "profile".) 3) Assuming translations exist, how can I search for a Finnish translation of the definition "namespace" (and thus effectively, also a translation of the _term_ itself). 
Of course, this is different than searching a definition for the translated term "nimiavaruus" (a Finnish translation for "namespace"). 
Perhaps the form "Term: [____]" ...should read: "Term: [____] in [Choose language]" ...and the current language selection should identify the result language. 
4) In addition to the above, one might want to search _only_ the translations? 
(I.e. currently one gets always the English terms also...) 5) Currently, the language selection (e.g. French) seems to have no effect. 
Or then my French is as fluid (or poor) as my English and I just can't see the difference... 
This obviously relates to the above... i.e. it might be better that the result set informed the user that "Currently, there are no French translations for the terms XXX1, XXX2, and XXX3 in the DB". 6) When searching, what is the meaning of the "Reset" button? 
It seems to have no effect. 
(And even if it had, is the button needed at all?) 7) In addition to searching for terms, one might also like to refer to the terms and definitions (e.g. when talking about terms or translations...). 
What if the application was added a feature for this (thus effectively giving URI names to the W3C terms +[:-) [*])? 
Of course, in an ideal case, one would obviously refer to the original specifications but due to e.g. missing markup, it can't be done. 
(Well, not without some XPointer-style fancy work.) 8) The meaning of the phrase "definition" in the "Search in Term names and checkbox and [] definitions..." might seem a bit unclear. 
I assume that it means a free-text search within definitions but it came to me only in the second reading... 9) How about a good-old glossary index (a link/control for all languages)? 
Trying the get an overview what the glossary is all about, one might week for a (condensed) index-kind-of page for all the terms. 
E.g. -----snip---- D ..., device, domain, driver, ... E ..., element, entity, ... -----snip---- ...where selecting "entity" would search the full glossary for the term (i.e. the index would not include duplicates). 
The page might be a bit long but very useful -- I believe it may even become more popular than the searches. 
And it could clearly point out the terms needing translations... (e.g. including "missing terms" in English, with different markup [color etc.]) 10) A help would help ;) The application is also a bit slow. 
I assume the speed has something to do with the real-time part of the application... Having said this, what happens when a spec changes its term or becomes resigned? 
(This is obviously related to [*].) 11) Future wishes: I haven't tried out making translations yet (Ivan told the offices that this is not set up yet). 
However, a term should obviously have multiple translations in a language (e.g. "main" and "alternatives"). 
In addition, I might understand the strict sense of a glossary, but the possibility of adding examples and comments (e.g. from the Team, WGs, and the TAG) could make this a killer application. 
(Just imagine the n+1 courses, seminars and presentations around the globe teaching these things...) My comments are obviously minor (except of course for the 7 and 11) remarks to the significant work done by the WG. Keep up the good work.

I hope you still remember this... 
As a first phase of a glossary project and English (ehm, sorry, American;-) glossary system has now been set up at: it is still not final, the user interface needs some tuning, etc, but it is an important first step. 
At this moment, it is populated by the team, and we will have to work out the process to get translated terms into the system. 
This will come. 
In the meantime, I think it is already a good resource, and may be interesting for translators, too!

11:40, Ossi Nyk?nen a ?crit 
: Thanks :) There isn't any real selection criteria, except the existence of an extractable glossary... 
I thought there was none in XML 1.0 and XML NS, but having looked at the XMLSpec version, there was indeed one, and they are now integrated in the Glossary system... If you have other suggestions of glossary, please let me know... 
I have added the definition of "concept" on the home page of the project; basically, a term conveys the idea that a concept has - basically, the concept is the platonical idea, while the term is is the word (or one of the word) that allows to say it in a given language. 
That's something we want to do in a next phase of the project, but as I said in we don't have resources right now to develop further the project; we are in a bug fix mode, and I don't plan to integrate big new features for now. 
Dear Dom et al, also...) True, but this seems important since the only official terms are those in English. 
What would be your use case to have the results only in a given language different from English? 
...I personally would prefer having a functionality like this behind a switch. 
(And some people do get annoyed when seeing English everywhere. 
Not me, of course, but...) The use case I have in mind goes as follows: If I seek e.g. a Finnish definition of a (Finnish) term, wouldn't I then expect to have the results only in Finnish as well? 
When reading, say a Finnish translation of the WCAG 1.0, I might not really care about the fact that the official terms are indeed the English ones, I might simply like to find what a term in the spec means (i.e. the concept behind the buzzword). 
Another, perhaps a more subtle observation is that, when performing a (partial text) search "element" (as "*element*"), I would like to find e.g. terms "elementti" (element) and "elementin sis?lt?" (element content) but not "element" (in English). 
For instance, in Finnish, words have many inflexions, which means that you frequently seek data based on only partial keywords (and by default adding the English words to the result set adds a lot of unwanted data). 
I believe this linguistic property may be found in other languages as well. 
to have no effect. 
(And even if it had, is the button needed at all?) Reset is a standard button on a form which allows you to undo any change you may have done on a form; it's there because it's good to allow people to revert any action they would have done. 
Yes. 
What I meant was rather that the form doesn't remember its state. 
In other words, after a search, it returns to the default state anyway. 
Thus, the button will be used very little, if at all. 
and checkbox and [] definitions..." might seem a bit unclear. 
I assume that it means a free-text search within definitions but it came to me only in the second reading... How did you understand it at first? 
What wording would you suggest instead? 
Since I anticipated that the system will (eventually) include e.g. CEO kind of concepts, and (I wish ;) perhaps examples, I though that the checkbox would _limit_ the search only to the actual definitions from the specs. 
In other words, when trying the system out without first reading the intro (ahem...), I assumed that by default, the system would search for all sorts of data. 
My suggestion for... "Search in Term names and definitions... " ...would be... "Search in Term names and TERM definitions... " resigned? 
(This is obviously related to [*].) This is where markup languages with link syntax start to become useful ;) ... i.e. 
I used the "[*]" to refer a text segment above (just after the smiling chap with a propeller in his hat... me, perhaps): -----a copy from above----- the translations...). 
case, -----a copy from above----- I.e. currently these things require manual work and a policy should be established how to deal with changes. 
(The URI names should be persistent, of course.) and things...) I think this should be done using another way; annotations comes to my mind for instance. 
Yes, that would indeed provide a cleaner system. 
However, I feel that the practice is a bit behind the specs in this case. 
In other words, I wonder when the mainstream browsers will support (and/or people use) a standard way of making annotations. 
(If only more people used Amaya or HayStack... Note: I really think the QA is doing a good job. 
And e.g. the glossary &amp; i18n kind of work should gain more visibility and higher profile within W3C; considerably more people read, interpret &amp; use specs than write them. 
And more often. 
To me, the glossary is a good example of a potentially valuable service that would be very hard to implement outside the W3C. 
A lesson to be learned, and transferred to member services ($), perhaps. 
A more general note: The archives seem to have censored Dom's good comments of the other half of my original murmur list (probably for a reason ;) I'm saying this just to point out that this might be an implication of a bug. 
In this case, this doesn't matter since both Dom and I have received all the relevant data.
