Per my action item from today... 
I checked the AU document, especially the section on evaluating accessibility [1] and did not see the requirement we discussed today, to wit: Provide means to record the results of manual checks of a document. 
This enables the author to avoid performing those checks again. 
- The manual check results should reference the particular parts of the document to which they apply. 
- If the document changes, the results document should be updated, but only 
to the extent it's actually impacted by the changes in the document. 
For example, manual checks of ALT text on an image should not be affected if HTML text changes elsewhere. 
It may be most convenient to implement this feature in object oriented architectures, where each object (e.g. an image 
tag) is responsible for tracking manual accessibility decisions relevent to itself. 
- A possible format for recording the accessibility decisions is that being developed in the EARL activity of ER [2] If we have consensus within ER on this proposal, I'll send it to AU for their consideration. 
Len p.s. I said "manual checks of ALT text on an image should not be affected if HTML text changes elsewhere" Hmmm. 
Are there actually cases where ALT text would depend on context?

I guess you are looking for something like 4.4 Provide the author with a 
summary of the document's accessibility status. 
[Priority3] The effective requirement is probably close to what you are looking for, although you may be considering explaining to AU why this actually qualifies as more than beneficial - removing a significant barrier to accessibility, and thereby 
justifying a change in priority. 
I agree that EARL is a good format for recording this information in a very useful format. 
One of the reasons I asked for AU to be invited to the morning meeting of ER on the thursday of the plenary.

Provide the author with a summary of the document's accessibility status. 
Not really a "summary" in this case. 
A means of tracking which checks (especially manual ones) the author asserts having performed, the results of said checks, whether anything has changed that requires their being re-performed, etc. 
Then, of course, the summary will be made discoverable by the handy-dandy "outside agent". 
Love. 
ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE 
OK, there is no reqwuirement in ATAG that the information is tracked carefully, or is particularly helpful. 
And the requirement is P3. 
At that level of priority, the techniques become more like what people are actually going to do. 
In particular, the best technique for providing a summary is to track what has been done, including author-checked stuff (ATAG is pretty explicit that there are requirements for author-checking in some cases. 
In fact the minimum requirement is just to ask the author to check everything). 
The best technique would be to use an interoperable language for knowing this stuff. 
One option is to consider taking on the work of developing such a language as a W3C Recommendation - after all, it is a fairly small piece of technical work by comparison to things like SMIL. 
It just needs implementors... 
Alternatively, maybe we should just shoot for implementation, make a Note, and then think about where to go... Charles

Yes, different aspects/emphases/croppings/overlay leaders of the same image may appear, appropriately with different ALT text. 
For example, in an art appreciation document describing a painting.
