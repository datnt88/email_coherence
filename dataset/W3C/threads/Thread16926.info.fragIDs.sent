<s> I think there are many threads here that are overlapping and may have little to do with accessibility directly.  </s>
<s> I had the opportunity to go the ACM Special Interest Group for Computer Human Interaction conference in Minneapolis in April, and most of the sessions there were pulling on more general parts of this set of questions.  </s>
<s> They were talking about usability, of web pages, speech systems, wearable computers, of Open-source systems like Linux and Mozilla, and not in terms of the blind or deaf or cognitively-limited, but in general terms, often with very intelligent, non-disabled individuals like the researchers themselves being the users.  </s>
<s> SIG CHI is largely an academic group, with corporate research groups, universities and the like, and the proceedings are peer-reviewed.  </s>
<s> But, on the large topic of usability, all I could see was a lack of discipline.  </s>
<s> It is an art form, making gurus out of Ben Schneiderman and Jakob Neilsen, because, in my opinion, the science is still being developed.  </s>
<s> The one Interactive Poster titled "Usability Inspections by Groups of Specialists: Perceived Agreement in Spite of Disparate Observations" was very pertinent.  </s>
<s> In this study, Hertzum, Jacobsen and Molich (all from Denmark) asked a group of usability specialists to evaluate a large web site for ordering rental cars.  </s>
<s> The eleven professional usability specialists all looked at the same site, and were all given the same five user tasks to perform.  </s>
<s> But, they found totally separate usability problems.  </s>
<s> Of the 220 unique problems, only a 9% overlap in problems found occurred between any two evaluators.  </s>
<s> However, in a group discussion on the problems, the evaluators generally thought they were all in agreement about the problems in the web site.  </s>
<s> To me this means that usability is still not a disciplined science and what is easy for one to use may not be easy of another.  </s>
<s> No wonder we are having these discussions.  </s>
<s> Dan Nissen  </s>
<s> the kind of validation I am referring to here is inclusive and begins with what is usually thought of as validation.  </s>
<s> It goes like this.  </s>
<s> Write your pages to speck, validate the pages to make sure they are written to speck and while you are writing to speck, include in the speck known factors that make pages usable/accessible and when you validate the final product, use tools that will check for known usability and accessibility factors and also that will allow you to examine other issues that may be relevant.  </s>
<s> People are important in the mix too but it all starts with a well laid plan and when the users finally test the pages, they should find insugnificant things that you may have missed or hadn't thought of but that wound not necessarily break the accessibility/usability of the pages.  </s>
<s> I cannot talk on the phone and test a web page at the same time.  </s>
<s> ----- Original Message ----- Validation is all fine and good but it would be quite simple to have a site that validates and passes all the standards tests but when a user sits in front of it they can't use it at all.  </s>
<s> Perhaps what Scott is testing in his phone sessions is not accessibility per se but usability by people who are blind.  </s>
<s> This is an extremely valuable activity that will provide way more insight into how people will access your site than a simple validation activity.  </s>
<s> Both automated validation testing and real live user testing are important steps in good site design.  </s>
<s> Liz -----Original Message----- Behalf Of David Poehlman interesting point Jerry!  </s>
<s> This harkens back to my point of "vallidation" with which I was putting forward the crazy notion that doing it right to begin with makes a huge difference.  </s>
<s> ----- Original Message ----- I wonder how much of this depends on the user agent, by which I mean the combination of the web browser and screen reader.  </s>
<s> As a specific example, ever since JAWS for Windows discovered how to grab headings (*real* headings with numbers, not just over-sized type that web designers like to pretend are headings) and present them in a list with the ability to move immediately to a heading, I have suddenly become very enthusiastic about proper use of headings to mark off important section divisions in a web page.  </s>
<s> Prior to the heading support, I have to confess that headings didn't do much for me because they were essentially indistinguishable from other stuff on the page.  </s>
<s> It makes a big difference, to me anyway, if you can gain some sort of hierarchical view of a web page rather than just the classic never-ending linear version.  </s>
<s> In summary, how a web page "stacks up" may be surprisingly dependent on the browser/screen reader used to view it.  </s>
<s> Just my two cents, and hopefully not too far off the mark.  </s>

<s> Hi, First, the goal isn't necessarily validation but looking at accessibility.  </s>
<s> Second, different people have different  </s>
<s> interpretations  </s>
<s> of what an accessible web page is to blind people.  </s>
<s> For example, look  </s>
<s> at  </s>
<s> the various standards that have been or are being developed.  </s>
<s> The methodology being used was to get subjective experience of various blind subjects.  </s>
<s> Rather than taking the perspective that the web pages are accessible because they meet some set of standards, we focused on whether the blind subjects themselves experienced the web pages as  </s>
<s> being  </s>
<s> accessible.  </s>
<s> The feedback that was given was interesting and helpful.  </s>
<s> Using a comparison strategy can also be helpful, but not always necessary for getting useful information.  </s>
<s> The issue of skill is something to consider.  </s>
<s> A question though is how much is it a blind person's responsibility to have a certain skill level and how much is  </s>
<s> it  </s>
<s> the web page's responsibility not to have high expectations for skill level?  </s>
<s> The Hisoftware person I talked with left me with the impression that  </s>
<s> the  </s>
<s> software doesn't have mechanisms for measuring such things as how long does it take for the blind subject to understand a web page or determining how accurately the blind subject understands the web page.  </s>
<s> The software basically is checking syntax against a specified set of standards rather than evaluating the experience of the subjects.  </s>
<s> Rather than discussing the questions, it might be interesting first to use them when working with a variety of blind subjects.  </s>
<s> However, a question to ask is if a sighted person can understand the purpose of a web page in let's say 15 seconds and it often takes a blind person 2 minutes to understand the same web page, is that web page accessible?  </s>
<s> Scott  </s>
<s> Dan Nissen's e-mail about "Usability Specialists" evaluating the same large web site differently has reminded me that it also occurred with accessibility specialists - or judges - evaluating whether a site met the WCAG standards or judging guidelines.  </s>
<s> In many cases they agreed, in some cases they did not reach consensus.  </s>
<s> The more subjective the standard, the more room for opinions.  </s>
<s> The other point to consider when testing web pages - or evaluating the test subjects ability to use and understand web pages - is what Jerry stated, the capabilities of the assistive technology.  </s>
<s> I would like to see how the results take into account the capabilities of the AT and the user's proficiency with it.  </s>
<s> For example, would a learning impaired users using WYNN get more out of a page than just using Opera?  </s>
<s> Would a blind user using Home Page Reader get more out of a page than a blind user using a screen reader and Lynx?  </s>
<s> Of course the answer is obvious yes since the AT provides many features, but these features and the users' ability to use them needs to be taken into account when doing any kind of study like this.  </s>
<s> Regards, Phill Jenkins IBM Research Division - Accessibility Center  </s>
<s> Hi, Dan is very correct on this.  </s>
<s> It is hard even coming up with a good definition of usability that most people would accept.  </s>
<s> On a slide I use when lecturing I compare usability to beauty in the quote "I can't define 'beauty', but I know it when I see it."  </s>
