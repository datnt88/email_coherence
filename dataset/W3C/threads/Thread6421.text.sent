I have been reading through the W3C mail archives and I must say that all this horizontal scrolling is annoying. 
Do you think that using the PRE element for messages is a good idea? 
Obviously, many mail clients do not wrap the text.

calls cost 150pm Apologies for the delayed reply (I just saw that your question went unanswered). 
I believe the idea is to preserve incoming text as typed. 
I am cc'ing Jose Kahan in case he has a comment. 
Susan Lesch http://www.w3.org/People/Lesch/ World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) http://www.w3.org/ Janet, Susan got it right. 
It's much more annoying for people to have their message be reformatted than to scroll. 
The problem doesn't come from the pre, but from broken mail clients that allow to have lines bigger than 78 characters. 
Regards, -jose Jose, Susan, Can you elaborate on that a little? 
So we can know what we (and our mail clients) are doing wrong and can avoid the problem in the future? 
I noticed the problem happens on messages from me when I use Outlook 2002, but not Outlook 2000 or Mac Mail. 
Looking at the messages, Outlook 2002 and 2000 both claim to be doing quoted-printable, and both are wrapping lines at 78 characters or less, but 2002 messages have an "=" at the end of each paragraph while 2000 (and other clients I've observed) use "=" or "=20" for soft breaks within a paragraph. 
So an Outlook 2000 paragraph looks like (hoping the "=" doesn't get lost): 1 .................78 This is a wrapped = paragraph sent = from Outlook 2000. 
(Don't remember if there is a final "=" or not.) An Outlook 2002 paragraph looks like: 1 .................78 This is a wrapped paragraph sent from Outlook 2002.= 
My raw message viewer doesn't let me distinguish line endings, so I'm not sure about CRLF vs CR vs LF. Oddly, if a sysadmin looks at my message at the SMTP gateway, the 2002 message looks like the 2000 message (it has "=" at the end of each line), so I'm still investigating. 
Thanks for any information. 
xan Just to add some information (and test my theory by posting to the list), I have noticed that the problematic messages (no soft breaks) from Outlook 2002 seem to only occur when the encoding is us-ascii. 
If I force the encoding to something else like utf-8 or iso-8859-1 by either including a non-ascii character or telling Outlook to not auto-select the encoding, then it seems to wrap correctly with soft breaks. 
xan Looks like forcing iso-8859-1 didn't help for the wrapping on the list archive. 
Trying the same message with utf8 (again from outlook 2002).

xan One more try with uf8. 
The last message still went out with iso-8859-1, perhaps because I created it by forwarding an iso-8859-1 message.
