<s> I wrote a little perl script  </s>

<s> results attached.  </s>

<s> Looks good.  </s>
<s> The result table doesn't seem to indicate that OWLP parses the files for entailment tests.  </s>
<s> Could that be indicated somehow?  </s>

<s> Did you scroll down to the end of the table?  </s>
<s> I had originally sorted them next the related test...  </s>
<s> The table needs  </s>
<s> better organization, maybe different tables for different kinds of tests, and sort options, and options of showing only approved tests.  </s>
<s> Any ideas?  </s>

<s> Of course not!  </s>
<s> That would be too much work!  </s>
<s> (Actually I did, but I did't make the connection.)  </s>
<s> Yes. Use a four-dimensional table.  </s>
<s> :-) Actually that is probably not a bad idea, you could have TestSyntaxEntailment Euler ... ...Euler ... ... Partial views of this information would almost certainly be needed.  </s>
