Just in case you discuss the meetings in Boston and/or CSUN before I join today. 
I went to both meetings last year and will vote for an EO meeting in Boston. 
Next year I won't go to both tech Plenary in Boston and CSUN in LA. 
I simply use too much time afterwards on catching up with work. 
I think the EO group gets more out of meeting at the Tech Plenary (better chances of talking to other W3C and/or WAI WGs) I find the meeting after CSUN is more of an outreach meeting than an actually EOWG meeting. 
Talk to you this afternoon Cheers Helle EOWG: Time: 8:30am - 10:30am US Eastern Daylight Time Bridge: Zakim: +1 617 761 6200 conference code EOWG (3694) then press # Upcoming: http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/#meetings AGENDA: [the estimated times in the agenda are an _experiment_!] 1.
