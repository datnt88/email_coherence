<s> Just in case you discuss the meetings in Boston and/or CSUN before I join today.  </s>
<s> I went to both meetings last year and will vote for an EO meeting in Boston.  </s>
<s> Next year I won't go to both tech Plenary in Boston and CSUN in LA.  </s>
<s> I simply use too much time afterwards on catching up with work.  </s>
<s> I think the EO group gets more out of meeting at the Tech Plenary (better chances of talking to other W3C and/or WAI WGs) I find the meeting after CSUN is more of an outreach meeting than an actually EOWG meeting.  </s>
