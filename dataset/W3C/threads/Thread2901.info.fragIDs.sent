<s> This is in response to the mailings and press announcements exchanged regarding the Microsoft proposed modifications to the SSL 3.0 specifications -- apparently referred to in the industry as "STLP".  </s>
<s> Microsoft has proposed to Netscape and to the chair of the proposed IETF  </s>
<s> TLS working group to produce a specification that is a "merge" between SSL 3.0 and PCT 2.0 and provide that combined specification document to the IETF as a starting draft to write a Secure Transport Layer Protocol (STLP) specification.  </s>
<s> The intent of the merged document is not as a proposed standard of any kind, it is provided just as a starting point so that the working group does not have to consider two different specifications.  </s>
<s> The document produced by Microsoft did not include any input from Netscape other than it is based completely on SSL 3.0 (without any hints from PCT).  </s>
<s> Microsoft suggested several modifications to the SSL3.0 spec that they considered to provide added value to the spec.  </s>
<s> It was interesting to see that the proposed "closed" discussion meeting appear in all magazines as the new Microsoft proposed STLP standard.  </s>
<s> Aside from that, all the recommended changes to the SSL 3.0 spec either cause possible security holes, are unrelated to securing transport layers or totally irrelevant.  </s>
<s> For example one of the recommended (by Microsoft) changes is to support  </s>
<s> datagrams (UDP) as well as TCP traffic.  </s>
<s> While having a secure version of UDP is a useful tool, it certainly does not belong at all to this discussion since the SSL protocol (and its variants including PCT) is designed assuming a reliable transport.  </s>
<s> Supporting UDP actually better belongs to the IP layer security efforts because of the "non-reliable" nature of the datagram delivery.  </s>
<s> There is also a request to change the signal called "ChangeCipherSpec" that determines the starting point of the new agreed upon algorithms to include other values, that actually has the potential of breaking the data stream since that signal is provided as a synchronization point between the client and the server to switch algorithms.  </s>
<s> There were several editorial changes to the front half of the document that made the document quite unreadable and therefore we did not finish analysing the proposed changes to th protocol.  </s>
<s> Since Microsoft decided to use the SSL3.0 protocol as the basis for new features, and for the sake of saving time, the TLS working group should review the SSL3.0 spec as the starting point for the TLS discussions, and since the IETF is truely an open forum, Micorsoft does have the opportunity of poposing any changes they see are advantageous to the funationality of the protocol.  </s>
<s> During the course of the coming several months all these changes and proposed changes from other interested parties will be looked at by the working group.  </s>

<s> Taher addresses only two technical points: datagram support and support for pre-encrypted data.  </s>
<s> The former, while certainly not the *main* function for a TLS protocol, is useful for such purposes as sending out-of-band data, and for protocols like PPTP, which establish a TCP connection for control messages but use IP for bulk data transmission.  </s>
<s> Taher claims that the mechanism proposed for the latter (pre-encrypted data) "breaks" the protocol, but I don't see that it poses any security (or other) problems.  </s>
<s> (If it does, I would certainly like to see the details.) In the absence of such problems, I believe that support for pre-encrypted data would be a useful efficiency feature of the protocol.  </s>
<s> (I might add that there are most probably other ways of implementing the feature safely, if use of the "change cipher spec" message is unworkable.) There are a number of other technical issues raised by the STLP document that I believe merit consideration.  </s>
<s> The most salient is the possibility of revamping the handshake protocol flow to make it more flexible, symmetric and efficient.  </s>
<s> Another is that the negotiation of authentication options can be made more flexible and explicit by including, for example, certificate types and the option of password-based authentication.  </s>
<s> (This latter topic has already been raised by David Kemp, who opposes the inclusion of the password option, and has also commented on some of the other technical issues; I'll respond to his points as soon as I can.) Daniel Simon Cryptographer, Microsoft Corp. dansimon@microsoft.com  </s>
<s> OK - this list is for TECHNICAL discussions.  </s>
<s> On this alias we should discuss the features needed in a new and better transport-layer protocol and not the politics of choosing one existing protocol over another.  </s>
<s> (If we fall into the trap of the latter, we will all lose...) Our only intent is to accelerate the process and get an open standard within the IETF quickly.  </s>
<s> It is Microsoft's goal with the STLP strawman to avoid the anticipated shootout between SSL and PCT.  </s>
<s> We would have preferred to have taken PCT 2 as the basis for an STLP standard, but we felt that doing this would have been viewed as contentious and have merely delayed the development and adoption of a new protocol standard.  </s>
<s> So despite the risk that we would appear to be abandoning PCT and our PCT partners, we decided to base our STLP strawman on SSLv3.  </s>
<s> We remain committed to supporting PCT and PCT developers just as Netscape is committed to SSL and SSL developers.  </s>
<s> But the new protocol is not about PCT or SSL or any other individual protocol.  </s>
<s> It is simply about developing an OPEN standard.  </s>
<s> We're frankly delighted that transport layer security is an IETF working group!  </s>
<s> btw: our STLP starting point incorporated the following ideas from PCT: - datagram support - new keys and cipher specs allowed, supporting pre-encrypted data - less long-term dependence on particular algorithms - more information in alerts for robust error-handling - improved handshaking, allowing speed-up when the client has the server's key - additional authentication options, including previously shared secrets - full specification of cert types and names for both clients and servers The idea tho is to get other than MS and Netscape to comment on what should be in STLP.  </s>
<s> So please let's get an active discussion going on the technology.  </s>
