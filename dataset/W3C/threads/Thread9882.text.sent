I've noticed, three times now, that I'm not seeing back my own messages that have the RDF desiderata HTML attachments ... does anyone know if this is a W3C list-management thing, or a problem with my mail systems. 
(But I did receive back a copy of my MT comments, also in HTML. 
Wierd.) #g /\ \ Graham Klyne / \ \ (GK@ACM.ORG) 
we have the same problem... therefore I think it's not (y)our mail system Jos I'm getting everything OK (that I can tell) so it doesn't seem to be a "Europe" thing.

Graham, I assume that was one of the messages you did not receive. 
I did receive this message. 
Jos, can you confirm that you did not receive this message. 
Did anyone else *not* receive this message? 
Brian I *did* receive but I (still) haven't received (my own message) the situation now seems to be OK Jos I sometimes miss my own messages in the following case: - I am using a non-HP account to send the message - I fake the from address or set the reply to address as my HP address - the W3C software accepts the message as legit - HP firewall software drops the message as a fake This seems to be an unfortunate interaction between features rather than a bug!
