Describe the layout and purpose of frames and how multiple frames relate to each other. 
[New] Use the "longdesc" attribute on the FRAME and IFRAME elements to designate a long description. 
If the longdesc attribute should be used to describe how multiple frames relate to each other, why isn't it on the FRAMESET element rather than the FRAME element?

Ask the authors of the HTML4.0 spec. 
why there isn't a longdesc atribute in the FRAMESET, but only in FRAME and IFRAME. 
Also OBJECT which is very similar in nature to IFRAME has no longdesc attribute.

This seems silly to me ? the purpose of LONGDESC is to provide a place for HTML markup. 
Both FRAMESET and OBJECT allow you to put as much markup in 
them as you want. 
Thus, no need for LONGDESC.

As does IFRAME, but it has a LONGDESC attribute. 
That depends on what the purpose of LONGDESC really is. 
To me, LONGDESC for IMG is a long description of the image--a nice implementation of the "D-link". 
This is very different than with the OBJECT or IFRAME element, where the element content provides a *replacement* (not a description) of the object or inline frame. 
I don't see the point to a LONGDESC attribute on FRAMESET. 
The TITLE attribute on FRAMEs should be sufficient to give the contextual relationship among the frames. 
If the relationship cannot be expressed in a few plain text words, then I suspect it's too complicated for any user, sighted or otherwise. 
If LONGDESC for IMG is indeed a long description of the image, as I believe it should be, then OBJECT should also have a LONGDESC attribute--provided we accept that the content of OBJECT is a replacement rather than a description, which is really the only sensible way to interpret an OBJECT within an OBJECT.

Another purpose of adding LONGDESC to FRAME was to allow a long description to be provided where the content of the frame, designated by the SRC attribute, is either an image or another non-textual resource. 
Under such circumstances, instead of using SRC in the frame itself to refer to the image, authors are supposed to provide a "wrapper page", that is an HTML document which contains nothing other than an IMG or OBJECT element, including the necessary textual alternative. 
However, recognising that this is a cumbersome approach which some authors may not be inclined to follow, LONGDESC has been added to FRAME and IFRAME. 
Thus, the long description of the non-textual resource referred to by the SRC attribute can be associated with the frame itself. 
Also, LONGDESC enables a more detailed description to be given, where necessary, of the nature of the frame's content (where this can not be conveyed in the TITLE attribute).
