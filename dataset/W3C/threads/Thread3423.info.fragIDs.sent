Hi, 
I'm formerly the W3C Conformance Manager and the QA Working Group [1] 
co-chair. 
Right now, I'm busy with the WG activities and review of internal specs, but I will continue to participate as often as possible to this list, and when the QA Framework [2] will be finished, I will join the Education effort. 
I want to thanks Jeffrey Zeldman (WASP [3]) and Molly Holzschlag (writer of an old WebTechniques column [4]) for their support and encouragement for a long time. 
Many of you on this list are long supporters of Web Standards and often individually, modestly have moved the things : Thanks !!! Since the begining of the QA Activity (1 year ago), I wished that the W3C has more liaisons with the Web Community. 
Why ? 
Because I come from this community and was, in part, hired by W3C for this reason. 
There's certainly a gap between the specifications done for the Software implementers (perfect or not) and the tutorials / books / materials available around. 
How to fill the gap ? 
Because it's not a question of building a bridge between two separate worlds, but to help people to better understand each other in a common world : The Web as large. 
We need tools, we need documentation, we need tutorials, we need to have contact with teachers who teach web development in Computing schools as well in Art Schools. 
We need real practices of the real world to build better materials. 
So how to fix bad habits of web designer, developers and at the same time how to create good materials, how to explain techniques or just things which seem to be obscure wrt W3C technologies. 
We can do it all together.

Before people reacts, I'm still, but the title is not really meaningful it's why I used formerly :) Karl Dubost / W3C - Conformance Manager --- Be Strict To Be Cool! --- 
so where's the best place to start? 
will there be a central repository to store all these tools, documents and tutorials?
