Hello, On yesterday's CG call, Jon Gunderston elaborated on a proposal he has made to hold one or more workshops in order to publicize the UAAG work and generate interest for future work: The suggestion was made that our group (AUWG) might benefit from participating in such a workshop, in effect making it a Web Tools accessibility workshop. 
Thoughts?

I like the idea.

Inland Anti-Empire Blog http://inlandantiempire.org I read the workshop e-mail: and I agree both groups would benefit, but the real need is to crisply identify the purpose of the workshop. 
I assume it would actually be a "W3C workshop" with position papers, etc. [see note 1], but Jon's e-mail suggest more of a conference session. 
If it's more of an education and outreach session to developers, then I don't think it really replaces the f2f need of our charters. 
If it's more of a W3C workshop with position papers, then I would be more inclined to support it. 
Both could occur at a conference along with informal birds of a feather sessions. 
Some seggestions for the W3C style workshop "Accessibility and Web tools": - my product's support of UAAG/ATAG and strategy for future support. 
- my company's strategy for support of UAAG/ATAG - my company's vision for support of accessibility (more broad than UAAG/ATAG) - my view of the industry's support of uaag/atag (comparison, research) [note 1: W3C Workshops &amp; Symposia Regards, Phill Jenkins, IBM Accessibility Services
