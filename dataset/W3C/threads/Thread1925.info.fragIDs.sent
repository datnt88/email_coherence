<s> The issue comes up of how to use the return from the server; traditionally, most protocols just use the TCP stream to return responses and/or errors, and you can't interspearse other traffic over the return channel.  </s>
<s> This was my question.  </s>
<s> From your description in the BOF, it seemed to me that HTTP needed an out of band (OOB) channel, what you called call back channel.  </s>
<s> Currently, TCP does not have such a thing.  </s>
<s> By OOB channel, I mean a stream which is not constrained by the original TCP stream.  </s>
<s> This means data sent/received in the OOB channel is independently handled.  </s>
<s> My question is if there is such a OOB channel, how it will be used?  </s>
<s> Once you have a multiplexing layer that enables its use, if the server needs to call back the client, this is easy and much faster to do over an existing TCP connection than establishing a new TCP connection, which saves packets, the round trip times to establish a connection, and it may not even be possible to establish a separate TCP connection (think about how firewalls work.  </s>
<s> Mutiplexing is not what I really meant.  </s>
<s> By multiplexing several application streams over a single TCP stream, all those streams are still constrained by the single TCP stream.  </s>
<s> The constraints are the result of TCP's requirement of in-order delivery of segments.  </s>
<s> An OOB channel does not have this problem.  </s>
<s> You may ask about all those congestion control/avoidance, timer, ... of the OOB channel.  </s>
<s> But I think we need to understand if such an OOB channel is useful, and how it is going to be used before we can decide how those things are to be handled, hence my original questions.  </s>
<s> I want to know if my understanding of the requirement is correct.  </s>
<s> If the OOB channel is only used for a small amount of "expedited" data, the whole problem can be much more easily solved in the existing TCP with some modifications.  </s>
<s> But if the OOB channel is going to be used just like another TCP stream, it is probably not possible because what you want is really 2 streams.  </s>
<s> If you are doing a distributed object system on top, your natural programming model is to send object references around that get called; method invocations in this sense often invert client and server to get thie jobs done.  </s>
<s> We exploi  </s>
<s> t  </s>
<s> this in the prototype HTTP-NG implementation; if there is a callback to an object on the "client", it goes over a new session we establish in the MUX over the same TCP connection, rather than establishing a new connection, saving a connection establishment (with the multiple packets and RTT's as a result).  </s>
<s> As RTT's are large in the Internet, this is a major win for many uses.  </s>
<s> Going a level lower, does this kind of call back require a substanial amount of data being sent?  </s>
<s> By substanial, I mean more than 1 or 2 TCP segments.  </s>
<s> In today's Internet, you may assume 1 TCP segment can take about 1 KB data.  </s>
<s> And about the most commonly asked for feature of the Web is some way to provide notifications.  </s>
<s> I've had people describe to me amazingly gross ways of doing really ugly things inside of HTTP to do this.  </s>
<s> Yuk....  </s>
<s> By notification, did you mean the server wanted to send some control data while it was still busy sending response data to the client?  </s>
<s> Can you also explain your requirements about getting more info from TCP?  </s>
<s> I guess this was what you meant by a better socket API.  </s>

<s> The issue comes up of how to use the return from the server; traditionally, most protocols just use the TCP stream to return responses and/or errors, and you can't interspearse other traffic over the return channel.  </s>
<s> The WebMux model is more symmetric than what I think you are referring to with your OOB channel.  </s>
<s> For example, I expect that in many cases, the role of the server and client will simply swap so that the server can initiate a new channel to the client and send a request.  </s>
<s> There should be no constraints on the amount of data going in either direction.  </s>
<s> Jim mentions some scenarios where this is useful.  </s>
<s> Another example is an inter-cache communication where two caches can cooperate as two peers in a Web of caches and not only as a downstream vs. upstream cache.  </s>
<s> Maybe your question is really whether we need to be able to prioritize streams either from the client to the server or the other way.  </s>
<s> In fact, we have been discussing this as there are several scenarios where this comes up in typical Web applications.  </s>
<s> My feeling is that it should be done at a higher layer and not try and deal with it in neither TCP nor WebMux.  </s>
<s> Note that there is no reason why bidirectionality can't be done in TCP already and if peers can reuse state then this may be just as efficient as what we are attempting to do in WebMux.  </s>
<s> I don't believe that the firewall  </s>
<s> argument is useful here as I can't see why firewall administrators should be more willing to have outgoing Mux channels than outgoing TCP connections.  </s>
<s> However, I don't think your question is whether WebMux can be done completely in TCP (in fact it can't) so I will not dive into this discussion here.  </s>
<s> Yes, this is what we have in mind.  </s>
<s> When we implemented HTTP/1.1 with persistent connections, pipelining, and output buffering, it would have been extremely useful for us to have had access to segment sizes, timers, etc.  </s>
<s> The best we can do for now is to guess these parameters.  </s>

<s> This kind of call back is common in distributed object systems.  </s>
<s> Good example.  </s>
<s> The issue is one of initiation: a firewall admin is much more comfortable if the application is known to have been started on behalf of someone inside the firewall.  </s>
<s> (I speak as one once upon a time responsible for Digital's major Web firewall relay).  </s>
<s> The information a firewall admin most wants/needs are: o who is making the request.  </s>
<s> o what protocol is being relayed (so that it can be verified that that is actually being used).  </s>
<s> o what type of content is being transferred.  </s>
<s> Mux makes a firewall only slightly harder to engineer, and it provides at least as good identification of what protocol(s) are in use.  </s>
<s> And there are times one really wants such information.  </s>
<s> For example, say you have a highly interactive application.  </s>
<s> Most socket buffers are quite large, and you can have many seconds of data "stuck" in the socket buffers.  </s>
<s> If the bandwidth observed is low, you may really want/need to avoid writing (committing to transmission) data into the socket buffers.  </s>
<s> But the socket interface currently hides the information required for an application to adapt its behavior.  </s>
<s> We plan to write up a note to circulate what problems we have using TCP and the problems we have with the current socket interface.  </s>
<s> - Jim  </s>
<s> I misunderstood what you guys mentioned in the BOF... I was wondering what Jim's callback channel was.  </s>
<s> Since TCP stream is bidirectional, I thought Jim was asking for some channel which expedited data could be sent, outside the original TCP stream.  </s>
<s> So I guess what he was asking for was a mux.  </s>
<s> I don't think it is very easy.  </s>
<s> For one thing, unless you use T/TCP, you need to pay the initial 3-way handshake cost when opening multiple TCP connections to the same host.  </s>
<s> Sharing window (congestion and send) info among multiple TCP connections need a lot of thoughts.  </s>
<s> Note that a lot of existing implementations already have some form of state sharing.  </s>
<s> RTT, RTT variance, cong window threshold, and MSS info are shared and are used to initialize TCP connections.  </s>
<s> But this does not solve the problem you are talking about.  </s>
<s> BTW, a mux over TCP means that if a packet of one session is dropped, all packets from other sessions, depending on the window size, may have to be delayed until the dropped packet is recovered.  </s>
<s> With multiple TCP streams, this is not a problem.  </s>
<s> But to me, a mux over TCP is easier to understand and implement than sharing TCP states (correctly) and let TCP do the work (correctly again).  </s>
<s> So I guess you guys want an API which gets info like netstat does.  </s>
<s> BTW, the TCP_MAXSEG socket option gives you the segment size.  </s>
<s> It is implemented in many TCP stacks.  </s>
<s> Maybe people on this mailing can write a document which lists those info needed and propose to have them added to socket API.  </s>
<s> K. Poon.  </s>

<s> Please do so.  </s>
<s> The worry I have is how an application is going to use those info.  </s>
<s> An app can use it wisely while another app may abuse it.  </s>
<s> An app may choose to open another connection to speed up a transfer when it sees RTO going up (which implies retransmissions), not knowing that this may cause more congestion.  </s>
<s> But in some cases, this allows the app to get a larger share of bandwidth, as in HTTP 1.0.  </s>
<s> In writing such a document, please include a somewhat detailed analysis of how the extra info will be used and what benefits they can bring to an app.  </s>

<s> No, I wasn't asking for expedited data, though a mux layer can be used that way by the multiplexing code having some notion of priority and scheduling some high priority message before data on other mux sessions.  </s>
<s> Yes, MUX is a form of fate sharing, so that other channels may be blocked waiting for the recovery of the underlying TCP.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, by putting everything into a single (or few) TCP connections, you are much more likely to get the congestion information "right", and be running TCP in the steady-state, rather than searching for the point at which congestion is encountered, causing the initial packet drop.  </s>
<s> The big problem I see is if a second packet gets dropped, and so you do a long time out before trying to restart.  </s>
<s> This "stalled connection" is so painful that human behavior is to abort the connection and restart it (the infamous "stop" button on a browser, followed by "reload" on the browser).  </s>
<s> Again, better to throw away and reestablish a single TCP connection than N of them, the current situation.  </s>
<s> It is the second packet drop with is a killer, not the first (due to fast restart).  </s>
<s> If something could be done to avoid such a long timeout to recover after a second packet drop, this would be goodness.  </s>
<s> Without real experience with deployed applications, it isn't clear what the consequences of this fate sharing are in practice.  </s>
<s> Thanks for the pointer; there is other information we'd like as well.  </s>

<s> Hiding the information doesn't mean they won't abuse the priviledge in any case.  </s>
<s> This worry is specious, in my view.  </s>
<s> It is not clear that in fact they get more bandwidth in practice; multiple connections did allow them to at least keep a modem line busier.  </s>
<s> In our experience, we're able to get higher performance over a single connection than exisiting implementations have gotten over 4 connections (see our SIGCOMM paper, and more recent tests we need to go into further has our Amaya browser beating IE and Netscape over a single connection).  </s>
<s> Of course... - Jim  </s>
<s> By second packet drop, did you mean a retransmitted packet got dropped?  </s>
<s> If a retransmitted packet got dropped, it will cause a TCP timeout.  </s>
<s> But if what you meant was 2 packets got dropped in a single window, either NewReno or SACK can recover from it without causing a timeout.  </s>
<s> I think now many implementations have both.  </s>
<s> One area it will help is because of the long train of packets, fast retransmit/recovery or SACK can be invoked to recover from packet loss.  </s>
<s> This is not true if there are only a few packets in transit, which will not trigger enough duplicate ACKs to invoke those recovery mechanisms.  </s>
<s> From TCP's point of view, this is a single stream.  </s>
<s> So all our understandings of TCP's congestion and loss recovery behaviors still apply.  </s>
<s> OTOH, if we use TCP state sharing, it is not clear how multiple streams to the same host will react to those network events.  </s>
<s> The only implementation I know of which has this TCP state sharing is from the Berkeley folks.  </s>
<s> Their simulation results look good.  </s>
<s> But since the shared state structure is accessed by all TCP connections to the same host whenever a packet is sent or received, it will not scale in real world.  </s>
<s> So I think having a mux over TCP is a better solution to your problem in the meantime.  </s>
<s> I guess this is what you guys think too... K. Poon.  </s>
<s> kcpoon@eng.sun.com  </s>
<s> No, I am not against letting applications know more about the connection state.  </s>
<s> But I want to point out that this can also give "bad" apps more info to abuse the network in ways that are more detrimental than they are doing today.  </s>
<s> The results in your paper may not apply here.  </s>
<s> Firstly, I think we are talking about a general mux over TCP, not HTTP specific.  </s>
<s> So the pipelining and compression techniques may not be applied because the mux does not know about the application's transfer behavior so it cannot tune its behavior.  </s>
<s> Suppose the app knows about the mux, it also may not be able to tune its transfer behavior to fit the model.  </s>
<s> Not all apps are like HTTP.  </s>
<s> Secondly, probably the only test case in your paper which may show the unfairness of multiple TCP streams is the high bandwidth/high latency test.  </s>
<s> The reason is that this is the case where those connections pass through links which are shared by other network traffic.  </s>
<s> In this case, to show that using more connections do not let an app get more bandwidth, you need to compare HTTP 1.0 results using, say 2 and 4, connections.  </s>
<s> Showing HTTP 1.1 is better just tells us that HTTP 1.1 is better than 1.0.  </s>
<s> It does not really tell us about performance implication of multiple TCP connections.  </s>
<s> As I mentioned in my previous mail, a long train (I also imply larger window here) of packets helps in recovering packet loss.  </s>
<s> If HTTP 1.0's transfer size is small in your tests, a packet loss may cause a timeout.  </s>
<s> This can have a big effect on the results.  </s>
<s> So for a general mux, we need to know the transfer size of an app before we can do any comparison.  </s>
<s> Your results may apply if the app we are talking about has similar transfer size as HTTP 1.0.  </s>
<s> OTOH, a few studies have shown that an app using multiple connections gets an unfair advantage over an app using single connection.  </s>
<s> This has to do with how the congestion window is increased and how TCP reacts to packet loss.  </s>
<s> Using multiple connections is more aggressive in both cases.  </s>
<s> Note that this does not imply that the app will get better throughput.  </s>
<s> It may or may not, depending on the network condition.  </s>
<s> That is why I mentioned above that if a "bad" app knows more about the network condition, it may be able to abuse the network in a smarter way.  </s>
