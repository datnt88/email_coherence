#g [1] Graham Klyne And that's not also a requirement of XML Schema? 
Refs to specs that bears this out?

#g [1] Graham Klyne Union datatypes. 
given where we've got to, there's no longer any reason to exclude them.

Union datatypes. 
given where we've got to, there's no longer any reason to exclude them. 
Right. 
I see now what you mean. 
Though it is not the case that any values of a union datatype do *not* have at least one lexical form, in the component (non-union) datatype, only that there is no L2V mapping to the value in the union datatype due to ordering of the union definition. 
The value *still* has a lexical representation. 
It's just "hidden" in the context of the union datatype. 
So the RDF requirement that all values have at least one lexical representation does not necessarily conflict with XML Schema. 
But if folks want to remove that requirement, I don't see it causing any real problems... Patrick
