I find it hard to navitgate our site and find myself editing the URL box in order to move between areas, such as back from reports/documents to the home page. 
Does anyone else finds this a problem? 
Charles suggested on IRC that a navigation bar might help. 
Maybe a floating one like on http://www.w3.org/QA/ ? 
I know the links to the events, workplan and reports are on the home page but they never stand out to me since they are in a paragraph of text. 
I guess presentations and talks could have a page of their own and links? 
Should the home page point to the flyer/factsheet. 
Where is the link to that :) Dave Sort of related are broken links. 
For any page on the W3C server you can add ,checklink to the end of the URI and get a report about broken links (which includes broken fragment references). 
It would be nice if we could do this for pages that have changed but I don't know how to make this happen yet.
