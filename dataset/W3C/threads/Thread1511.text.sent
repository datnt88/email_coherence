Hello, The Delta-V standard introduces the resource type "version resource" (VR) and "version history resource" (VHR). 
Am I correct with the assumption, that the (un)check in/out methods should NOT work on a "version history resource" and a "version resource" ? 
The only resource type, that can be checked out/in is a "version controlled resource" (VCR). 
Best regards Juergen Pill It is correct that checkout/checkin should not work on version history resources. 
If the server supports the working resource feature, then checkout would work against a version resource (but checkin still would not). 
Checkout of a version creates a working resource, and a working resource supports the checkin operation (but not the checkout operation).
