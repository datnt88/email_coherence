<s> Hello, I would like to propose the following editorial changes to the document based on a review by Aaron Leventhal (thanks Aaron!).  </s>
<s> I intend to incorporate these into the next draft unless there are objections.  </s>
<s> Reference document 24 Feb 2001 draft [1]. 1) Checkpoints 3.5/3.5  </s>
<s> 3.5 Allow configuration so that client-side content refreshes  </s>
<s> (i.e., those initiated by the user agent, not the server) do not change content except on explicit user request.  </s>
<s> Aaron suggested that this might be interpreted as meaning  </s>
<s> "compare and see if the refresh changed the content or not".  </s>
<s> Proposed change: Allow configuration so that the user agent does not perform client-side content refreshes (i.e., those initiated by the user agent, not the server) except on explicit user request.  </s>
<s> I propose the same type of change to checkpoint 3.6: Allow configuration so that the user agent does not  </s>
<s> perform "client-side redirects" (i.e., those initiated by the  </s>
<s> user agent, not the server) except on explicit user request.  </s>
<s> 2) Aaron suggested adding some techniques for checkpoint 8.4 in the case of XML content: how do you determine "important  </s>
<s> structural elements" for (generic) XML content?  </s>
<s> I think the answer is "you probably can't, except if you have some kind of documentation," which may take any number of forms: a) A specification. b) A schema (human or machine readable).  </s>
<s> c) Some other metadata Other techniques for this?  </s>

<s> I don't see that there is a problem using the method Aaron suggested.  </s>
<s> It  </s>
<s> would enable a user agent to seperately queue the changes to a document that  </s>
<s> gets updated on the fly, which seems like a good thing since they could be  </s>
<s> offered to the user who had asked for a page to stay still, as a seperate  </s>
<s> item.  </s>
<s> It might be helpful to have this available, and I can't see that it  </s>
<s> breaks anything we need.  </s>
<s> So I would propose to instead add this as a technique.  </s>

<s> My goal here, mind you, is only editorial clarification, not alignment with existing implementations, etc. - Ian  </s>
<s> Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org) http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs Cell: +1 917 450-8783  </s>
<s> OK... My assumptions:  </s>
<s> The point of the checkpoint is to keep the page stable if the user  </s>
<s> desires.  </s>
<s> What the user agent does behind the scenes has more or less no  </s>
<s> impact for accessibility.  </s>
<s> Where there are in fact changes being made to the page, it would be helpful  </s>
<s> for a suer to know what they are to some level of detail lower than "the page  </s>
<s> changed (somewhere, perhaps)".  </s>
<s> My conclusions (I figure we all have the same information to work on :): The existing wording meets the accessibility requirement.  </s>
<s> Aaron's potential interpetation of it is a valid interpretation.  </s>
<s> Aaron's approach gives rise to the following technique for doing something  </s>
<s> even better than just not doing the refresh, viz: Get the new version and find out what, if anything, has changed in it  </s>
<s> (simple markup-aware diff).  </s>
<s> Store that information, sequentially (a la a  </s>
<s> markup-aware version of CVSWeb, and Aaron probably has access to such).  </s>
<s> Allow the user to view that information at any time, as a seperate function  </s>
<s> to doing the update.  </s>
<s> This allows the user to work out what is going on in the original page, and  </s>
<s> then just find out what changes.  </s>
<s> (It is probably helpful to know if nothing  </s>
<s> changes, too).  </s>
<s> A couple of iterations of this should be helpful in deciding  </s>
<s> whether to turn off auto-configuration, and read changes from this function  </s>
<s> as desired, or turn it back on.  </s>
<s> A working example of sorts:  </s>
<s> Cricinfo - http://www.cricinfo.org  </s>
<s> - provides real-time (more or less) score  </s>
<s> and commentary of cricket matches from around the world.  </s>
<s> If I use a standard  </s>
<s> scoreboard, it auto-refreshes frequently, but it only changes a few parts of  </s>
<s> the page - the current batsmen/bowlers, the current score, and the most  </s>
<s> recent commentary in full and abbreviated form.  </s>
<s> The scoreboard for batsmen  </s>
<s> who are already out, and for previous innings, remains unchanged.  </s>
<s> With a system like I have described, I could look at the scoreboard, and look  </s>
<s> at the changes.  </s>
<s> This would enable me to find out which bits are being  </s>
<s> changed, so I know which bits to look at again when the page is updated, and  </s>
<s> which bits to ignore.  </s>
<s> Or I could decide to stop the autorefresh, and do it  </s>
<s> manually when I want.  </s>
<s> (I often do this, and there is an option on the site to  </s>
<s> get a version which does it too).  </s>
<s> Or I could start from a known page, and  </s>
<s> read the changes made in subsequent (unseen) versions - updated commentary,  </s>
<s> or scores... Cheers  </s>

<s> Summarizing: - The proposal was "don't do the refresh"  </s>
<s> - Charles says that's too restrictive, since the UA might  </s>
<s> do the refresh and provide the user with a useful diff on demand.  </s>
<s> I still support the proposed change for the following reason: a) The user need is stability.  </s>
<s> b) The minimal requirement is "don't make the change unless the user says it's ok"  </s>
<s> c) Charles' proposal goes beyond the minimal requirement that  </s>
<s> I believe the checkpoint was meant to accomplish.  </s>
<s> (It would seem that the proposed change is not editorial.)  </s>
<s> I propose therefore that the minimal requirement is "don't do the change unless the user says ok" and that the checkpoint be changed to reflect that.  </s>
<s> The user agent can do more (e.g., provide useful diffs on demand), but I don't believe that's ever been the intention of the checkpoint.  </s>

<s> My proposal is for _A_ technique for doing this in a really cool and helpful  </s>
<s> way (i.e. goes way beyond the P1 requirement of the checkpoint).  </s>
<s> That's why I proposed it as a technique.  </s>
<s> I explicitly suggested not changing the checkpoint.  </s>
<s> I still don't see how the checkpoint fails in any way to cover your requirements a and b as written, and that the proposed change would preclude the technique that I have suggested.  </s>
<s> Therefore I object to changing the checkpoint in the manner foreshadowed.  </s>
