<s> Hello, We have incorporated the ideas from last week's conference call into the latest document.  </s>
<s> The latest table is at: The latest linear version is at: Notice that we have collapsed the table even further.  </s>
<s> We are down to 21 items!! big changes: 1.  </s>
<s> We filled in the rest of the rationales.  </s>
<s> 2. The techniques are more descriptive and "english-like" (i.e. hopefully less cryptic).  </s>
<s> 3. Things that have been collapsed into other guidelines/techniques are noted at the end.  </s>
<s> 4. There is one place where the techniques have been split into two groups, each with a different rating.  </s>
<s> This might be a problem because it applies the rating to the technique (whereas other places we apply the rating to the guideline).  </s>
<s> However, most other places the rating applies to techniques and guidelines.  </s>
<s> 5. After all of the discussion about the wording of A, we changed it again since the way we had it read that "all information must have an alternative representation" which is not correct.  </s>
<s> 6. We've added lots of links in the doc, note that none of them work - they're all just place-holders (except in the linear version - the table of contents is fully functioning).  </s>
<s> 7. We are using the rating scheme of the UA group.  </s>
<s> The first draft of the techniques document is underway.  </s>
<s> Have fun.  </s>
<s> We look forward to comments.  </s>
<s> --The Editors  </s>
<s> E2 -use a valid DTD should be a Priority 1. Non-valid markup excludes an audience which uses UA xyz, unless we are asserting that all current UAs can cope with it...  </s>
<s> How complex is a complex frame arrangement?  </s>
<s> two frames are often used so one provides navigationh and the other provides content.  </s>
<s> But not always  </s>
<s> by any means.  </s>
<s> Three frames opens heaps of possibilities - two navigation sets, a non-functional banner, are two which spring to mind as real examples.  </s>
<s> I feel that all framesets should have meta-information available.  </s>
<s> Tables are a bit different - there needs to be a real discussion.  </s>
<s> Should there be a list of Don'ts?  </s>
<s> I know that it is not popular on its own, but for people who don't really know much about HTML (and there are thousandsof those in Australia generating web content for important services) it would probably be helpful.  </s>
<s> Or should that be outside the scope of a W3C recommendation?  </s>
<s> Could the ratings go after the contents?  </s>
<s> Just some first thoughts.  </s>
<s> It basically looks really good.  </s>
<s> Charles McCN  </s>
<s> Rating and Classification [PRIORITY 3] This guideline should be implemented by an author to make it easier for one or more groups of users to access information in the document.  </s>
<s> Implementing this guideline is not critical to accessibility, however.  </s>
<s> For P3, I'd suggest using "may", not "should", so that it gives us a clean IETF look-alike must/should/may wording.  </s>
<s> * For all images (IMG), applets (APPLET), image map links (AREA), and graphical buttons (INPUT type="image") provide alt-text ("alt")  </s>
<s> Shouldn't we be talking about spacer images, bullets and difference between pure decoration and functional images at that point ?  </s>
<s> if not where ?  </s>
<s> * If OBJECT is used to embed any of the above components, provide text within the OBJECT element.  </s>
<s> Also true for APPLET, which have a content much like OBJECT.  </s>
<s> (in fact APPLET has both alt and content, so we need to decide which one to use, and it seems that people have been using content more often)  </s>
<s> For these two, I'd only make P1 providing textual equivalents for "important" audio or video information.  </s>
<s> Same definition as important for longdesc on image: understanding this piece is necessary for the overal understanding of the document.  </s>
<s> I'n a unix user, with no sound/video whatsoever, and when I get to a page that is supposed to play a riddle in the background, I just need to know that it is a riddle, not some operating instructions to access more data.  </s>
<s> If I get a pointer to a audio file for a song, I just want to know which song I'm missing.  </s>
<s> If I really want to hear the song, I can go thru the pain of finding a windows machine around the office and get to it.  </s>
<s> There is both a title and a longdesc on Frame, so one can support that.  </s>
<s> I think it's more important to require a meaningfull title for frame, ala "index", "navigation bar", etc.  </s>
<s> It's more a UA issue than an author issue.  </s>
<s> OK for P2, but not a P1.  </s>
<s> Priority 2??? 7. Avoid ASCII art and non-letter characters within words.  </s>
<s> Since characteres are used to create a visual image there is no way to attach alt-text as with other images (see A-1). Character spacing and non-letter characters cause problems for screen readers.  </s>
<s> 1.  </s>
<s> For ASCII art, use Style sheets with descriptions or replace art with images with alt-text and descriptions  </s>
<s> what is "style sheet with description" ?  </s>
<s> There is a way to describe ascii-art online, right after or before the art itself in html, it's just hard to do it in such a way that it is visible only for some people and not others, but CSS can help here, as discussed on the list before.  </s>
<s> Priority 2??? 8. Provide visual notification of sounds that are played automatically.  </s>
<s> If a user is accessing the page without sound, information presented through sounds played automatically will go unnoticed.  </s>
<s> When the sound is played, display a visual equivalent.  </s>
<s> only on demand, again, a UA issue I think.  </s>
<s> Priority 2 1.  </s>
<s> Separate content and structure from presentation.  </s>
<s> 2. Use elements and attributes appropriately.  </s>
<s> Priority 1 and 2 2. Enable keyboard operation of all page elements.  </s>
<s> Someone who is using the page without sight, with voice input, or with a keyboard (or other input device other than a mouse) will have a difficult time navigating a page if keyboard shortcuts are not provided for objects on the page.  </s>
<s> Access to image maps is impossible for these users if alternatives are not provided.  </s>
<s> keyboard access can be supported by the UA even if the author hasn't made any special effort, so this is not a P1.  </s>
<s> That's different, should go into modality, where I think it is already.  </s>
<s> Here I think we should mention that client side image map are better than server side (there are: even without alt in area, at least you can get an idea of the choices by looking at the target href, possible having the UA fetch the title)  </s>
<s> Priority 2 3. Provide keyboard shortcuts to links (including those in client-side image maps), form controls, and groupings of form controls.  </s>
<s> ("accesskey") 4. Create a logical tab order through links and form controls.  </s>
<s> ("tabindex")  </s>
<s> ok, so this is just a issue with the inclusion of alt for maps at this point in the document.  </s>
<s> I don't get the dlink for frame at that point.  </s>
<s> I'd say avoid complex frame and use frame title to allow for serialization of the framing: [frame 1: global index] [frame 2: top nav bar] [frame 3: current page]  </s>
<s> Priority 2 2. Provide titles for images (used as links), frames, horizontal rules, acronyms, and abbreviations.  </s>
<s> * Titles on images provide information about the destination of the link (whereas the alt-text should provide the basic function of the image, see A-1).  </s>
<s> * Titles on frames allow user agents (browsers) to create a list of frames so users can keep track of them by name.  </s>
<s> * Abbreviations and acronyms may be expanded.  </s>
<s> * Titles can provide information about the purpose of horizontal rules that may be obvious visually but not auditorally.  </s>
<s> 1. Titles for frames ("title" on FRAME) 2. Titles for images ("title" on IMG) 3. Titles for abbreviations ("title" on ABBR) 4. Titles for acronyms ("title" on ACRONYM) 5. Titles for horizontal rules ("title" on HR)  </s>
<s> ok, so frame is covered, my comment applies to avoiding complex frames.  </s>
<s> Priority 2 5. For complex tables, provide summaries, associate cells with row and column headers, and group cells into categories.  </s>
<s> * Tables summaries provide an overview of the table and are useful by people who are unable to see the whole table.  </s>
<s> * Similarly, associating cells explicitly with their row and column headers allows a user to view the table cell by cell.  </s>
<s> * Grouping cells into categories will allow future user agents to create various views of the table.  </s>
<s> These guidelines benefit users that are accesing the table auditorally or viewing only a portion of the page at a time (users with blindness and low vision, or using an auto-pc, or devices with small displays) 1. Summaries for tables ("summary" on TABLE) 2. Associate cells with row and column headers ("headers," and "scope" on TD) 3. Group cells into categories ("axis" on TD)  </s>
<s> We need to define what is complex for frame and table.  </s>
<s> For frame I suggest more than 3, for table, we start discussing it in  </s>
<s> Priority 2 2. Use elements and attributes that comply with a W3C HTML, CSS, or XML specification.  </s>
<s> By avoiding proprietary elements and complying with a W3C specification you increase the likelihood that your page will be more consistent across platforms as well as more usable by a variety of populations.  </s>
<s> 1. HTML 2.0, 3.2, 4.0 2. CSS-1 or -2 3. XML 1.0  </s>
<s> To me, this is a P1. I'd even go as far as saying that until we've better defined what constitute accessible XML, we should restrict ourselves to HTML and CSS.  </s>
<s> This is a P1 because if you don't know the format (be it an extension to HTML/CSS, or a completetly new format), there is nothing a user-agent can do to adapt to the user preferred modality.  </s>
