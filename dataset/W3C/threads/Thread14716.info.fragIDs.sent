<s> If we organized our checkpoints into a database, we could provide multiple views of them.  </s>
<s> Here are some examples: 1.  </s>
<s> The current presentation | interaction | comprehension | technology view.  </s>
<s> 2. An access | navigation | comprehension view.  </s>
<s> 3. A content | structure | presentation view.  </s>
<s> 4. A view organized by difficulty: difficult - easy. 5. A view organized by affected group: visual | aural | cognitive | motor | etc. 6.  </s>
<s> A view organized by priorities: P1 | P2 | P3 7. By sequence: first - last (assuming some build upon others) 8. By skill necessary to conform: textual | musical | visual art | etc. 9. By relationship to WCAG 1.0 guidelines.  </s>
<s> And so on.  </s>
<s> Maybe users could make up their own.  </s>
<s> We could, if W3C insists, make one of these the "normative" (default) view.  </s>
<s> As Gregg points out, it would have to include all checkpoints in some sort of linear fashion.  </s>
<s> Frankly, I'm leaning toward the idea that the guidelines are different from other specifications and that perhaps one of the problems with WCAG 1.0 is that it is a bit too specification-like.  </s>
<s> For one thing, I think that making the guidelines too much like regulations leads people to think about them in regulatory terms (including the government).  </s>
<s> I'm not sure that that worked so well.  </s>
<s> Section 508 might have been better if they'd started from scratch.  </s>
<s> I guess we'd have to change the WG charter if we wanted to drop the normative view entirely.  </s>
<s> Still, I'm open to anything.  </s>
<s> I want effective guidelines.  </s>
<s> If our charter has become a straightjacket, I'd rather modify it than produce mediocre guidelines.  </s>
<s> Chas.  </s>
<s> Munat  </s>
<s> Hence the mantra "author proposes, user disposes".  </s>
<s> If the user of the GL isn't as empowered by their presentation as the output we call upon authors to provide, I'll need another entry in the sig line below!  </s>
<s> As in "each checkpoint that flaunts its own requirements..."  </s>
<s> Perhaps CP 3.4 could be "prepare textual manifestations with irreducibly transparentized obfuscation methodologies and maximize their lack of extraneous containments by means of minimilizations"?  </s>
<s> Love.  </s>
<s> EACH UN-INDEXED/ANNOTATED WEB POSTING WE MAKE IS TESTAMENT TO OUR HYPOCRISY  </s>
<s> Perhaps WCAG could include something like the following guide to writing "proper" English:- Now you know where I get my little idioms from :-) Kindest Regards, Sean B. Palmer @prefix : http://webns.net/roughterms/ .  </s>
