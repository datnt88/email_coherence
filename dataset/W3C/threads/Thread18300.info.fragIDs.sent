A patent was recently issued on a method for (among other things) scanning web pages by voice. 
Details are on the www-voice list: I'm the inventor. 
AT&amp;T (who was my employer when I did the work) holds the rights. 
The AT&amp;T rep to w3c, Lorrie Cranor, and I coordinated so you're getting just this one posting here. 
Please post any general discussion, when appropriate, to the www-voice@w3.org 
list to keep in in one place. 
(That's the public list, not the wg list).

Leonard, We could add this as one of the techniques for structured navigation.

Jon, Yes, it fits in with structured navigation, but there are W3C policy issues about including patented techniques in recommendations. 
Lets discuss with Judy.

Also, once it's cleared through w3c policy, I'd obviously be glad to do the writeup.
