Hello. 
I was wondering if anyone happens to know of any state laws in the US which might parallel section 508 in the federal government. 
I'm particularly interested in Washington and California. 
In doing some research I found pseudo-accessible sites such as California's Orange County Office of Risk Management: http://www.oc.ca.gov/ceo_risk/ , but there doesn't seem to be much going on at the state level otherwise. 
Am I looking in the wrong places? 
Many thanks.

The state of conneticut is developping a policy along the lines of the w3c web access guidelines. 
At one time the state of maryland was doing the same but I don't know much about their current implementation. 
I'm sure you'll hear more on this from others.
