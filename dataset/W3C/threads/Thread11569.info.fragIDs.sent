Many thanks from me, too! 
This is extremely valuable, as we are of course looking for feedback from Japan. 
I have put a link to your translation on http://www.w3.org/International/. 
I am really surprised by how fast you translate. 
If there are any tips and tricks you can share with others, this list is probably the best place! 
Regards, Martin.
