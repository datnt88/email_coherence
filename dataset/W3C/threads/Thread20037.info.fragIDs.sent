Hello, 
I have been trying to download Amaya for Windows NT, but the files I downloaded both via http and ftp reported themselves corrupted when I tried to install them. 
Do you have any suggestions?

Hello Toby, 
oaded both via http and ftp reported themselves corrupted when I tried to instal l them. 
I just download and installed Amaya in a WinNT box without problems. 
Except that my IE exploded at the end of the download... 
I'm not sure if this is related. 
I suppose you got your Amaya from ftp.w3.org/pub/amaya or from the URLs 
given from the home page. 
I selected the save file option and then executed it after downloading it. 
It installed Amaya without problems. 
Does anyone else have a similar problem?

Hello, I don't have any problems while downloading (Opera 4.1 and IE 5), nor installing Amaya for WinNT via HTTP (since version 2.4 up to now). 
I think the error must be on your system.

Hi Jose, Thanks for replying. 
I think that the problem was to do with something at my end, as I've subsequently had problems downloading off other sites.
