Hi everyone, I am looking for information about the current state of the web. 
I have heard figures bandied about that the web is 90 to 99.9 % inaccessible, and would like to know how these were arrived at. 
I was particularly hoping that somebody might know of a web survey that catalogues the problems of the web. 
The only one I have been able to get my hands on was done in 1996, and in web time that puts it about two decades ago! 
( I once heard that web years last 2.6 months) If any of you nice guys out there feel like helping out, I would be very grateful. 
Thanks Gareth Parkinson Please try to define your request. 
accessiblity is not itself defined as yet. 
I teach adults who are mostly non readers and have learning difficulties.

I thought you might like to know the following one of my students is very keen on wordsearches, (note that the meaning of the words is not required) She found a suitable website within minutes unaided and has had minimal experience of using the www. 
one of her own creations will be on our homepage this weekend. 
another equally able and experienced student was looking for a map of the UK. after half an hour, I started to help a little harder, and we eventually found a rather useless and very small one. 
I realize this does not help generalise issues, however I do feel that it is important for us to discuss the means of access as well as html and indeed xml. 
symantics is not a suitable metaphor it is the limbic system I seek, seat of the emotions.

found On the other hand, in the market of educational CDs and toys you will find many contenders: computer-accessible atlases and interactive globes. 
Don't be surprised at this. 
End-user data speeds are still generally inadequate for the delivery of high quality maps. 
xml. 
I hope, as a teacher, that you are not solely concerned with emotions. 
The current Consumer Reports has an interesting review of educational products as possible gifts. 
They rated them separately on fun and "problem-solving." 
I would guess that you want to keep fun above some minimum and then maximize the problem-solving value of the experience, once the fun level is acceptable. 
I understand that for many of your clients the web just isn't enough fun yet to keep them at it. 
Al Of course emotion is not all, however the approaches currently outlined in the guidelines tend to reflect the concerns of the programmers rather than the interests of observers. 
People commenting on the huge success of certain sites, eg blairproject or that famous film review site, would not usually refer to point 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3. 
recognisig that this is not inspiring fayre for the general punter. 
The difference, between finding maps and wordsearches has little to do with graphic image sites. 
rather that describing a map with words is not trivial, and that any wordsearch will do, but one is looking for a particular map.
