<s> I have a 17" 1280x1024 screen.  </s>

<s> Use the power of CSS.  </s>
<s> Create a $(HOME)/.amaya.css  </s>
<s> containing a magnification command applied to BODY: e.g: BODY { magnification : 1 }  </s>
<s> As an example here is my .amaya.css file, doing justification of paragraphs and a slight magnification: * CSS 1.0 Style Sheet produced by Amaya * User's Preferences * URL : /users/veillard/.amaya.css  </s>
<s> * Last updated 06/25/96 17:10:50 by veillard on praslin BLOCKQUOTE P { text-indent : 0pt; line-height : 16pt; text-align: justify } LI P { text-indent : 0pt; line-height : 16pt; text-align: justify } P { text-indent : 15pt; line-height : 16pt; text-align: justify } UL P { text-indent : 0pt; line-height : 16pt; text-align: justify } DD P { text-indent : 0pt; line-height : 16pt; text-align: justify } BODY { magnification : 1 } /* CSS end */ Note however that magnification implementation is not perfect, it does not do proportionnal scaling of each elements.  </s>

<s> Cool. Works for me.  </s>
<s> Thanks!  </s>
<s> Some suggestions: o You should publish the source as soon as possible.  </s>
<s> The more people working on the code, the better.  </s>
<s> Yes, some people might hack on it in ways that are incompatible with yours.  </s>
<s> Since you're the authors, you have the perfect right to ignore what they do.  </s>
<s> But some people will write good code, donate their efforts back to you, and you'll find it useful.  </s>
<s> Life is too short to have to do ALL your own programming.  </s>
<s> o The bottom scroll bar refuses to go away, no matter how large I make the window.  </s>
<s> o I'd really, but REALLY, prefer that the scroll bar scroll the text as I move it, and not just after I release the button.  </s>
<s> o I'd like to see Emacs keys for navigating through the document.  </s>
<s> o One thing I really like about PageMaker is that the current text attributes are reflected in the state of the buttons used to change them.  </s>
<s> So, when you move over Emphasized text, the Italics button goes down.  </s>
<s> o File menu could use a "Revert" item.  </s>
<s> o Consider not caching anything.  </s>
<s> If people want a cache, they can point to a caching proxy server, which might even be running on their own machine.  </s>
<s> o Consider using helper applications for mailto:, ftp:, gopher:, news:, at least in the beginning anyway.  </s>
