Hi, I've been the guy who's described himself as 'Putting the "Web" in "Web Services"'. 
So I guess you could say that I'm here to help put the "Web" into "Semantic Web Services" now. 
In particular, I'm quite concerned that a lot of the "*-S" work is picking up on bad practice in Web-services land, specifically, assuming that HTTP doesn't define a sufficiently rich application interface over which automata can coordinate arbitrary tasks. 
Thanks! 
Mark.

It is my fervent hope that if SWS-IG ever dives down to the level of message transport protocols the Great Referee In The Sky will blow a whistle (or throw a flag, or whatever image you prefer) and declare "out of scope, ten yard penalty"! 
Now it may be the case that some of the SWS discussions touch on topics such as how to represent web service description in a semantically grounded fashion (or, crudely, how to reimplement WSDL in RDF, as a friend of mine put it). 
Nonetheless, I would hope that we'd focus on taking the work of WSD and building upon it, rather than indulging ourselves in the impulse to re-fight old battles.... So, Mark, I guess my hope is that you don't actually have to do anything here! 
Geoff PS I'd also note that there is at least one group of potential SWS-IG members with whom you should have great affinity: "intelligent agent" researchers of the BDI/FIPA school. 
The speech-act based interaction model seems quite compatible with your predilections..... (subject changed; it's kinda creepy having your name in it 8-) Agreed. 
I also have no interest in discussing transport protocols. 
Application interfaces, on the other hand, are presumably in scope. 
So we can have discussions about whether FIPA's INFORM and REQUEST operations are suitable/sufficient, right? 
If so, then I claim that discussions about GET and POST are also in scope.

Agreed. 
Sorry for any perceived ad hominem.... 
Well, the FIPA messaging model is thoroughly asynchronous. 
Even a REQUEST is merely a proposal that the recipient should update its short-term goals (its "intentions") to include the intent to inform the initiator about something (the "something" being related to the content of the request). 
The response to the request is typically encoded as an INFORM (or perhaps a series of INFORMs). 
So to a first order all FIPA style messages would be POSTs. 
They are idempotent one-way messages, possibly one-many. 
It would certainly be unwise to construct a hard and fast mapping between the primitive speech acts of FIPA style agents and particular messaging primitives. 
Having said all that, there is clearly some performance benefit to be gained from piggy-backing a response within a single message-level transaction. 
I'm not sure how best one would accomodate this, in part because of the broken layering in SOAP/HTTP. 
However, that's properly the concern of different W3C groups. 
Whatever efficient mechanisms are exposed for one-way messaging can be exploited by BDI-style agents. 
Just to get a little thread convergence here, there are clearly interests of common concern between the OWL-S process group, the choreography WG, and multi-agent "interaction patterns". 
If any of them get too deeply entwined in lower-level messaging issues, it's going to complicate any synthesis...... Oh heavens, I perceived no ad hominem. 
Yes, that's true, but also do-able with POST. 
I've used two POSTs instead of a POST and a response before. 
And certainly REST doesn't require request/response interactions; I've used one-way UDP RESTfully. 
I don't follow. 
Are you claiming that HTTP POST is a "messaging primitive", but FIPA INFORM is not? 
A mapping between POST and INFORM would be quite straightforward, and could be implemented with an HTTP proxy, ala; telnet fipahttp.example.org 
80 POST fipa://some-host.org/agent/k 
HTTP/1.1 Host: some-host.org 
KIF-goes-here which would map that to (inform :receiver k :content [KIF-goes-here] Mark.

What are you referring to here? 
What is broken and how would you fix it? 
Paul I don't know what Geoff had in mind, but I've heard this complaint a few times in reference to the HTTP binding using HTTP error codes to communicate SOAP faults. 
IMO, that's a feature, not a bug, as one couldn't use SOAP RESTfully with HTTP without such a relationship between SOAP and HTTP (i.e. where SOAP is viewed as an HTTP extension, rather than a layer) Mark Baker.

I'm more concerned about SOAP over non-HTTP messaging schemes, particularly MOMs. 
Just to make your head hurt, consider the case of multiple SOAP intermediaries where the complete path may involve HTTP and non-HTTP hops. 
Today MOM vendors use proprietary encodings to fake an HTTP-like view at each end. 
That won't do for standards, though. 
DIME may be dead, but the need still exists. 
That is where the concept of "features" and "modules" comes in, and seems like it can be layered quite well. 
Also the idea of Message Exchange Patterns (MEPs) was to essentially fake out or abstract the service provided by the lower layer binding. 
If apps were designed to expect the synchronous response of HTTP, that app is effectively designed to use a request/response MEP. 
If the underlying (non-HTTP) binding does not provide a synchronous response, then you may need a "feature" to fake it out so that the application using SOAP sees the same MEP behavior. 
If a non-HTTP binding natively implements the req/rsp MEP, then you should be able to substitute the non-HTTP binding and not break the application. 
I have not seen much emphasis for declaring an application's MEP requirements. 
I have not followed WSDL 2.0 close enough to know if they can describe ways of doing a request response MEP over bindings that do not natively support it. 
Perhaps we need some new MEPs defined for use with MOM's, or new features/modules that make the MOMs look like request/response MEPs. 
If you a re using MOMs, you are probably in the realm of higher level choreographies. 
I know WSAWG is expecting WSDWG to look harder at intermediaries and how to describe them (when the ultimate receiver may not know about them, but the original sender needs to know what to do).
