Ok. I tried to build amaya from cvs: - I checked out libwww and Amaya. 
- I ran `aclocal; autoheader; automake; autoconf' in libwww. 
- cd ../Amaya; ./configure 
btw.: I changed in configure.in 
for libpng 1.0.8: - AC_EGREP_CPP([x \"1.0.1\" x], + AC_EGREP_CPP([x \"1.0.[1-8]\" x], - make this compiles part of the stuff, then fails with System wide unix-thot.rc 
not found at /home/joze/pub/config/unix-thot.rc Missing file: HTML.STR Structure schema not found System wide unix-thot.rc 
not found at /home/joze/pub/config/unix-thot.rc Missing file: HTML.STR (Amaya is at /home/joze/pub/Amaya) What am I missing ? 
(debian Linux woody, Kernel 2.2.17, lesstif) any help much appreciated.

The page http://www.w3.org/Amaya/Autoconf.html explains how to compile Amaya You must: - create an obj sub-directory (you are free to chose the name), - go into this sub-directory - and launch ../configure 
Irene. 
yes thanks. 
I should have read TFM better :-( Johannes
