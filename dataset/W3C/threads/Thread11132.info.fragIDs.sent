<s> I've been corresponding with Terry Allen, who's doing an XMLish version of DocBook.  </s>
<s> DocBook has a lot of content models like the following: ((%xxx.char.mix;)*) where %xxx.char.mix;  </s>
<s> resolves to (#PCDATA|a|b|c...).  </s>
<s> The current XML Lang spec doesn't allow for this; production 45 is very specific about how many pairs of parens can appear, rather than going for the generalized model group solution of productions 40-44.  </s>
<s> Of course, the outermost parens aren't really necessary; you can achieve the desired effect with (%xxx.char.mix;)*  </s>
<s> instead of ((%xxx.char.mix;)*).  </s>
<s> But where content models are heavily parameterized and you can't easily see what kind of model you've got, this makes the DTD writer split hairs.  </s>
<s> It should always be safe to throw another couple of paren pairs around a model, and currently in XML you can't do this.  </s>
<s> Can we consider loosening this restriction?  </s>
<s> Eve  </s>
<s> Just a quick note of support for Eve's request.  </s>
<s> I don't see any advantage in putting a limit on parens in the first place--if you can match up two pair, you can match up a hundred pair.  </s>
<s> bob  </s>
<s> I would also like to second Eve's call for a relaxation of 45 to allow: ((#PCDATA | a | b | c)* ) Mulberry also has many models that look like this, in fact our "house style" recommends this over the alternative (#PCDATA | a | b | c)*.  </s>
<s> But my objections are purely aesthetic, I like the symmetry and closure of knowing that element content will always be enclosed in parenthesis or (in the larger case of SGML) will be a keyword.  </s>
<s> Were I to write a program that parsed element declarations, I would find it simpler to depend on that fact.  </s>
<s> Let's here from the other side of the coin.  </s>
<s> Simplicity and beauty are not as powerful as technical arguments.  </s>
<s> Why NOT go with Eve on this one?  </s>
<s> -dal  </s>
<s> I like the way it is handled now.  </s>
<s> However, I would be interested in the way you would describe Production 45 in EBNF then.  </s>
<s> You are not very specific about the alternative way you suggest.  </s>
<s> I can see your point, from the perspective of a DTD designer.  </s>
<s> However, we should try to keep things as simple as possible.  </s>
<s> (Maybe) XML will require a slightly different approach to DTD design anyway.  </s>
