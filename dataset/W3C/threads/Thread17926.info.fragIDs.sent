<s> Hello everyone, Below is the first draft of the user agent impact matrix.  </s>
<s> This was a bit more complicated then I first thought, as you will see when you come across my question marks.. This matrix is based on the August 27, 1999 version of  </s>
<s> the user agent checklist, of all I'd like to say that I was tempted to say that just about every checkpoint could affect users with any and all disabilities.  </s>
<s> I am afraid that we might run into trouble trying to single out a particular user group.  </s>
<s> So despite a bit of a nagging feeling I went ahead and took a stab a creating the impact matrix that appears in text below and in an attached HTML table.  </s>
<s> I created the table by basically editing the user agent guidelines checklist but my formatting may not be totally correct.  </s>
<s> I attempted to model this matrix after the content guidelines impact matrix http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/NOTE-WCAG-impact-matrix-19990810 .  </s>
<s> After each checkpoint follows a list of those disability groups who I believe would be primarily affected by this checkpoint.  </s>
<s> Possible choices, taken from the content guidelines matrix, include deaf, hard of heard, blindness, low vision, color deficit, cognitive and learning, and physical.  </s>
<s> The list of disabilities is followed by a list of input and output technologies that would most likely be affected by the checkpoint.  </s>
<s> Input technologies include all types of keyboards and voice.  </s>
<s> I guess I didn't include pointing devices, should I have?  </s>
<s> Output technologies include visual displays, magnified or small screens, speech, braille and audio.  </s>
<s> I don't think I listed braille in as many places as I should have listed it.  </s>
<s> Some of these things are popping into my head as I write this note.  </s>
<s> If N A appears, it means that I believe that this checkpoint would not affect the input technology used, though device independence is still assumed.  </s>
<s> For example, checkpoint 5.3 Allow the user to control foreground color, shouldn't have an affect on the input device used, though the user should be able to change the foreground color using any input device.  </s>
<s> Rather than have a matrix, we may just want to state in paragraph form who these checkpoints will most likely affect and how, especially if we expect someone unfamiliar with users with disabilities to be able to use this document.  </s>
