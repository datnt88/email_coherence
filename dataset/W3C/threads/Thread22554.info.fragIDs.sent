<s> 1) DOM level 2 should provide better support for ID attributes.  </s>
<s> This could be done by * creating a new constant for the whatToShow attribute of the nodeIterator interface called SHOW_ELEMENT_WITH_ID, or * adding a required iterator+filter to the document and documentFragment interfaces.  </s>
<s> It may be that some method must be provided which declares that a particular attribute is an ID attribute.  </s>
<s> It would be prudent to allow as parameters: the namespace URI, the attribute name, a possible null list of elements in the same namespace that the attribute belongs to.  </s>
<s> * Also, some method such as "getElementByID()" should be provided on the document and documentFragment nodes.  </s>
<s> * Also, some method such as "setElementID()" should be provided on element nodes.  </s>
<s> ID attributes are the major and minimum requirement for link-integrity.  </s>
<s> Without an efficient and standardized mechanism for IDs, software which relies on IDs will not use DOM.  </s>
<s> I would expect many XLink- based languages to fall in this category.  </s>
<s> This is a very important use-case which deserves special treatment.  </s>
<s> IDs represent a fundamentally different class of information than that provided by other DTD declarations.  </s>
<s> The ID encodes "structural" information which must be efficiently implemented.  </s>
<s> Note that this request does not require IDREF methods be implemented; it may well be that IDREFs are subsumed by XLINK.  </s>
<s> However, IDs will remain, and indeed can be considered a cornerstone of XML-related technology.  </s>
<s> 2) DOM level 2 should not require lexical-checking for URIs, system and public identifiers, and XML names, except at some user-supplied option.  </s>

<s> I can't find any such requirement in the Working Draft...? Joe Kesselman / IBM Research  </s>
<s> The DOM WG discussed this and decided to wait for the DTD support that will be part of Level 3 for this.  </s>
<s> Added for Document; we'd want a good use case for DocumentFragment, or indeed any Node, since the cost of implementation could be quite high.  </s>
<s> Will also be tackled when we have DTD support.  </s>
<s> The DOM currently does not do such checking except for XML Names; the rest will be in Level 3.  </s>

<s> Speaking of which ... How does DOM know whether to accept or reject a name based on namespace support?  </s>
<s> Consider two legal XML 1.0 names: "prefix:local" ... - Illegal in PI names when XML Namespaces support is in use - Possibly illegal as an element or attribute name if the prefix is undeclared (no "xmlns:prefix" attribute in scope) - Illegal anywhere when XML Namespaces support is in use Is the assumption that namespaces always be used ... or is that an application's choice?  </s>
<s> If it's the application's choice there needs to be some API whereby the DOM can be told so, and which then will perform additional error checks for cases such ast hose above.  </s>
