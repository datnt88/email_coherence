<s> Hello everyone, In issue 693 [1], Greg Lowney suggested the following formulation of a benefit for guideline 2.5 (minimize errors) [2]: "Individuals with disabilities affecting their speech or manual dexterity will often have a higher error rate when communicating with speech or handwriting recognition, or typing, and therefore benefit proportionately more from features that assist in recognizing and correcting input errors."  </s>
<s> Although I totally agree with the content of this, I think the formulation is too complex.  </s>
<s> I propose the following reformulation:  </s>
<s> "Certain disabilities make it more difficult to operate input devices, resulting in more input errors.  </s>
<s> For example, individuals with limited motor functions are more likely to make errors when they operate a mouse or a keyboard.  </s>
<s> Individuals with speech disabilities are more difficult to understand by speech recognition.  </s>
<s> Features that assist in recognizing and correcting errors benefit individuals with these types of disabilities.  </s>
