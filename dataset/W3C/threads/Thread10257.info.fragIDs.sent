<s> I think doing so makes a lot of sense.  </s>
<s> I need some indication from chair or process expert as to whether this change should be done immediately (since the schema lives "outside" the LC WD) or at the end of LC process.  </s>

<s> As far as I can see, such a change seems both reasonable and timely.  </s>
