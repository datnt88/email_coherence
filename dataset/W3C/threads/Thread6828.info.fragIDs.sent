<s> The XML spec DTD is pretty cool in a lot of ways, but it seems to me that it's arbitrarily different from HTML in expensive ways: you *have* to use a batch process to convert from source form to preview/display/delivery form.  </s>
<s> Ideal Solution Source format: HTML dialect use a strict HTML dialect with: tables, class=abstract, possibly math.  </s>
<s> Document Manipulation API: java interface -- http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/SGML/spec-mgmt and in May 1997, I did a little hacking on a (psuedo-)XML parser and some tools to convert an HTML dialect to lout for typesetting.  </s>
<s> The example I used was: i.e. source: output of lout conversion: postscript output from lout: along with which "refines" HTML: to add report titlepage stuff (abstract, ...) a section/subsection structure, bibliography stuff, etc. (note that I used an extension to SGML marked section syntax for modules) Now that we have XHTML (nearly) and DOM and XSLT, I hope to revisit this idea and finish the code, but I haven't managed to find time, so I'm sending this message to see if anybody else is interested/motivated.  </s>
<s> For example, my conversion program was rules-based, and I hope that it converts to XSLT straightforwardly:  </s>
<s> The idea is to use on XHTML dialect for editing *and* delivery.  </s>
<s> It has some redundancy that is (or at least: could be) managed by machine; for example for quotations: If you're using lynx or Mosaic 2.0 or something, you just get "Hyperdocuments" but you can also do a stylesheet that adds real printer's quotes and supprsesses c as a child of q.  </s>
<s> If you don't want to add these c " /c things by hand, you can do it automatically using DOM scripts or XSLT.  </s>
<s> Same goes for all sorts of generated text: tables of contents, cross references, indexes, ... .  </s>
<s> Not to mention specialized notations like grammars and such.  </s>
<s> The idea is: you generate those by machine, but you don't treat the results as junk to be thrown away; you fold it back into the source.  </s>

<s> Hmm, the current XML dialect has all sorts of semantic markup for stuff like BNF and conformance constraints and so on.  </s>
<s> Switching to XHTML for HTML-like stuff (ordered lists, paragraphs) seems obvious; but I'm not sure how you avoid that batch processing step if you want to use fancy div/span or table machinery to make BNF look good and so on.  </s>

<s> FWIW, the XMLspec documentation discusses some of the issues surrounding making XMLspec a relative of HTML: I'm kind of interested in the idea of "augmenting" the content of an XMLspec document with generated material, but worry about people editing it by hand when in a hurry.  </s>
<s> (I've seen it happen in many a production environment.)  </s>
<s> Also, over time, XMLspec has gotten more specific/semantic, not less, and all these constructs are miles away from HTML.  </s>
<s> I'm not sure that much is gained by connecting them artificially, especially if we can commit (finally :-) to making a good, official XSLT stylesheet that transforms into HTML.  </s>
<s> I believe this is what Ben Trafford has been working on.  </s>

<s> First, I'd rather use CSS2 table style stuff than HTML table markup to decorate BNFs and such (someday, at least...) Second...  </s>
<s> I'm not necessarily trying to avoid the batch processing step altogether.  </s>
<s> The idea is that -- without the batch process, you can still use a web browser to get a rough idea of your document and -- after you run the batch process, you don't throw away the results, but rather fold them back into the source.  </s>
<s> So I'd probably do something like: p Pickles are not allowed at this point in the sandwich due to the risk of allergic reaction.  </s>
<s> /p for grammars with constraints.  </s>
<s> And with the right tools, the s:c stuff would be added by machine from source that looked like: p Pickles are not allowed at this point in the sandwich due to the risk of allergic reaction.  </s>
