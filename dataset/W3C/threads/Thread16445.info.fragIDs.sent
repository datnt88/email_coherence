An offline note promted me to query whether we are really leading the web, or have we determined that web means html/xml/ and never mind the other online media, unless we wish to grouse. 
I can think of many reasons why they might want to concentrate on HTML. 
Do we need to show how accessible the wai site is by providing evidence of accessible streaming media, and thereby demonstrate how possible these 
I'm not sure that you are using streaming correctly here - in internet terms it refers to some technical aspects of delivery that are not particularly meaningful to end users, however, interpreting it rather liberally, I think you need to demonstrate accessibility issues that do not come into these categories: - problems that pre-date the internet, e.g. issues that are also present for broadcast radio and TV and live theatre and concerts; - the fact that such material is generally only produced on a commercial basis; - the fact that delivery of such material is expensive, in terms of all of network, server, and user owned equipment costs; - that are not aligned with commercial interests in such media. 
In the first category, I can only think of one thing and that is the difficulty of making such media, particularly audio media, a first class part of the web. 
The web is the links between resources, not the resources themselves, and not the network of machines that transports them. 
One only has to listen to links from broadcast radio to internet based resources to see an awkwardness there. 
On the second issue, such media is expensive to produce and the artists need to earn a living. 
In addition, there are vested interests in the existing distribution chains for films and audio. 
Although W3C does have a micropayments activity, micropayments are not yet a reality, so most such media either advertises itself or advertises something else. 
In both cases, the objective is to target people who can afford to pay for the products. 
Historically, artists have given free performances in charitable causes, but the internet makes it difficult to implement this form of positive discrimination. 
Micropayments may remove some of the free promotional material. 
The cost of delivery affects people who can't afford to keep up to date with the latest hardware and people in poorer countries. 
From a supplier point of view, it favours a small repertoire, which can be stored close to the market. 
From the general commercial interests point of view, even before the popularisation of the internet, cable TV companies, and people like British Telecom, were investigating the provision of video on demand. 
The internet rather caught them off guard and took power out of their hands temporarily. 
They are beginning to regain control. 
The characteristic of this sort of system is servers at the cable head end, serving a local community, from a relatively small repertoire of popular material. 
Generally such organisations are not interested in an intellectual market and operate in a one way communication fashion. 
They are generally only interested in supporting a mass market audience, which, I suspect, represents the sort of material of which you are talking. 
That reduces accessability of more intellectual material and of certain types of controversial material (they don't want to upset their advertisers). 
In relation to BBC radio, the process has been termed dumbing down. 
The one way nature of the communication is one in which streaming media tend to particularly violate the original spirit of the internet. 
Would many more people find the wai message far more accessible if it was provided in a variety of formats? 
I don't think it would be more accessible in different formats. 
However, it might reach more people if it were more successfully promoted in other media (I'm thinking particularly of broadcast radio), however the nature of such media, even when it doesn't suffer from the full dumbing down process, means that there has to be a lot of oversimplication (e.g. a radio programme on information privacy managed to claim that cookies were programs and implied they actively spied - actually the interviewee gave a better description but failed to challenge when the interviewer summarised in this way - this was a programme on Radio 4 and aimed at an audience that is relatively up market in broadcast terms). 
Broadcast television might be even more effective, but the production costs of television make it difficult to justify covering what the editors would consider a very minority, and somewhat technical, subject. 
The current strength of the "web" (and, in part, a consequence of it being structured as a web) is that users have to go and pull information from it, but that is a disadvantage when you want to push a message that people are not eager to discover (and why so many commercial sites seek ways of subverting its nature). 
- that are not aligned with commercial interests in such media. 
this applies equally to html and W3C and WAI are supported fairly liberally by 'commercial interests' 
This is one of the most serious obstacles to progress, for my clients.

I suspect it is the cost of production point to which this really applies. 
What I was trying to say here is that once "web" content gets taken over by the mass media, it will naturally aim low in terms of the comprehension skills of its audience, and therefore that keeping material easily comprehensible is a main streak requirement for the sorts of media that can only really be produced by large organisations. 
I would actually argue that HTML, in its origins, did significantly undermine existing commercial interests, but the sorts of features you like are in there because they are what the commercial interests need, not what is needed for peer to peer communication. 
I'd further say that W3C was largely flying in the face of commercial wants by stressing structure, and its separation from presentation. 
Most commercial interest is in terms of vehicles for one way influence of humans, whereas the W3C position favours a much more balanced relationship, and favours machine to machine communications, which would permit consumers to make much more objective decisions, and internal technical communication, where accurate commuication, rather than influence, is needed. 
I suspect that many of the company representatives on the W3C are their strongest technical people, not their most business aware people. 
One indicator of this is the failure of member home pages to comply with the standards that their experts are helping to form. 
If HTML were aligned with commercial wants, the majority of HTML would be written according to the intended semantics; in practice less than 5% is, which strongly indicates that the market demand much better aligns with PDF's intended market. 
On the other hand, technology for streaming audio is largely aimed at the same, popular music, market as CDs and commercial radio. 
Although I didn't say so, it is fairly obvious, from the way that it is funded, that W3C is not going to do anything that undermines the existing film and music industries, but that was the cost of production point. 
I think what you are really talking about is a form of redistribution of wealth. 
I don't think that can happen directly in internet terms; I think it can only happen as the result of the implementation of micropayments, allowing the donation of electronic cash that can buy this sort of resource. 
Anything else would be just too open to fraud.
