<s> I have built Amaya 2.1 on Solaris 2.5.1 with EGCS-1.1.2.  </s>
<s> The build was successful.  </s>
<s> On bringing up the manual  </s>
<s> /home/hgs/AMAYA2/Amaya/doc/amaya/Manual.html I had white text on a white hackground.  </s>
<s> My foreground color is set to white, background to black.  </s>
<s> I suspect this is due to the foreground colour not being specified in the document: BODY { background-color : #FFFFFF } /style etc  </s>
<s> On browsing my home page Amaya crashes with *** Thot: Irrecoverable error ***  </s>
<s> The first time it did that I checked with the validator and I had a typo ATRONG ... /STRONG instead of STRONG ... /STRONG .  </s>
<s> The response still seemed a little severe.  </s>
<s> I have corrected this, the page validates OK now, but Amaya still crashes.  </s>
<s> I wonder if there is a cache holding the old page?  </s>
<s> Looking at that manual page with  </s>
<s> Netscape, I cannot see anything on command line options to flush any such cache, or to increase diagnostic output.  </s>
<s> The coloured popup legends on the button bar seem a bit bigger (thanks)  </s>
<s> but they are still cream on yellow, and I cannot see anything to set the font size or colour for those.  </s>
<s> The colour "palette" doesn't seem to have an "apply" button, only  </s>
<s> a "done" button, unlike the Character Style and Format menu items.  </s>
<s> There seems therefore to be no way to override the colours imposed by the document.  </s>
<s> Thank you, Hugh hgs@dmu.ac.uk  </s>
<s> In-reply-to: Your message of Thu, 01 Jul 1999 11:08:07 +0100."  </s>
<s> Yes, this is an error in our page Manual.html.  </s>
<s> When we set the background color we have to set the foreground color too.  </s>
<s> I'll change for next versions.  </s>
<s> I have a solaris box too but I have no problem with that URL. Could you start Amaya on a debuger just to let us know where it crashs).  </s>
<s> Yes there is a cache that you can purge (see the menu Special).  </s>
<s> Tooltips use the foreground color, but you cannot change the yellow color.  </s>
<s> That is a bug.  </s>
<s> Right, we still plan to add it.  </s>
<s> Irene.  </s>
<s> Thank you.  </s>
<s> How? I could not see anything about command line options... Let me know how to give you enough info and I will.  </s>
<s> Thanks.  </s>
<s> Flushed it.  </s>
<s> My page still crashes amaya.  </s>
<s> Thanks for noting it.  </s>
<s> Which foreground colour -- the X one or the Amaya (menus/fonts/etc) one?  </s>
<s> If it is the X one then maybe pick up the background (X) colour instead of the yellow.  </s>
<s> Ideally one would like to configure these within Amaya, I think.  </s>
<s> Thanks.  </s>
<s> Maybe borrow Netscape's "always use my colours" feature, but this ties in with style sheets so I'm not sure where it should live :-)  </s>
