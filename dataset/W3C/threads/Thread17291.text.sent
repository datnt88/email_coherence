I used a survey tool called Perseus for a project a while ago and it is meant to generate section 508 compliant forms for the questions and uses the fieldset and legend tags for the questions and answers. 
The problem is that my client has found that when you increase the text size and view on a low resolution (like 800x600), some questions don't wrap and the text trails off to nowhere. 
Has anyone had a similar experience, and can offer some advice or is this just a bug with the tags in IE6? 
If you want to have a look, you can access the survey by entering the code "test17" in the complete the survey box N.B.

Thank you, Jason It's an IE 6 bug.

That's an abuse of legend. 
Legend is for grouping form controls. 
It is basically a platform native user interface component (which is one reason why it has limited capability in IE). 
In its original use, the intention was to have just one or two words. 
Same for your very long lines! 
text/plain email is not intended to be word wrapped, there are specific MIME formats for that. 
I've encountered this problem too. 
If Jason's example is an "abuse of legend", what exactly is the correct technique? 
Take this overly simple example... 
The problem: With each radio button in this fieldset, screen readers should announce two pieces of information: (1) the overall question ("What's your favorite season?") and (2) the label that identifies the current radio button (e.g., "Spring"). 
The solution? 
Since each LABEL element is associated with exactly one form control (not two), how else other than LEGEND can we explicitly ensure that screen readers have access to the overall question? 
Jaws currently supports this LEGEND &amp; LABEL combination (maybe other screen readers too - I'm not sure), and I see nothing in the html4 spec that defines LEGEND as being of a restricted length. 
By the way, this isn't just an IE bug - Netscape does it too. 
Opera does not (it wraps the legend). 
In IE and Netscape, I can force a line break in a legend using BR elements, but surely there must be some CSS solution that's less arbitrary?

On Behalf Of David Woolley Sent: Friday, May 14, 2004 2:36 PM Subject: Re: Fieldset legend text doesn't wrap The typical Windows interface convention for this would be to use a pulldown list (although there is no guaranteed way of achieving that in HTML as radio buttons are a valid rendering of select). 
As such, having a fieldset for a single field doesn't make much sense. 
The typical use of radio buttons is where there are other controls associated with some of the radio buttons. 
Fieldset legends are normally nouns or very short noun phrases. 
If the overall page is about favourites, here, then it would be simply "colour", otherwise "favourite colour". 
What's wrong with p ? 
If you only want one selection read out by default, you should definitely be using select, as the other reason for using radio buttons is to stress the complete list of choices. 
David, both things you mention (typical Windows convention and legends as nouns or noun phrases) seem to me to be more of a stylistic issue, rather than a case of "abuse". 
Structurally, I would say that radio buttons are just as valid as a dropdown menu, especially when the number of options are below a certain threshold (I usually go for around 5 or 6 options before employing a dropdown, but of course there's other situations where I've used a dropdown even for something like a two option choice). 
I'd say that the fieldset wrapping, or not, is one of those limitations on par with current CSS' lack of control of the finer display details of things like checkboxes and radio buttons (where you still can't properly set the background, or override the 3D look, etc)...although it looks like CSS3's User Interface is going to rectify some of those shortcomings - and blur the lines between what CSS can and cannot control with regards to document versus browser chrome/GUI.

The reason that form controls aren't affected is that they are directly mapped onto native controls, which I believe is very much in line with the HTML philosophy. 
A lot of people want CSS to have control, and override the OS, but that is confusing for users, as it means every site has its own look and feel (already a problem), and really indicates that a lot of people haven't bought the HTML concept and are using it for unsound reasons. 
Hi David, I think you are right about the CSS not controlling the components actions of a form. 
But, CSS should define the layout of a form and the style of images and text in a form. 
There are a couple reasons why I believe this should be so, one is for accessibility where the user can change the style and layout to better aid in navigating the site on a personal level (user defined stylesheets), and for device independant displaying where a form can look better with different styling and layout on a cellphone or PDA then the standard 800 x 600 or larger display.
