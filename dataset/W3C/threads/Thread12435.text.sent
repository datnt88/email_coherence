WAI Page Author Guidelines Working Group: You're invited to take a quick look at a WAI EO reference piece. 
For the pilot version, we need feedback by Monday noon, Nov 9, US EST. 
It is appended in text. 
If you want to see the Word mock-up, e-mail me. 
It's a large file. 
The WAI Education &amp; Outreach Working Group (EOWG) has been working on a "quick-tips" mini reference card for accessible page authoring. 
The idea is to put very concise rendering of some high-priority guidelines onto a business card, both sides, so that people can carry a reminder around. 
The tag line at the end gives people the URL for /WAI for the "complete" Page Author Guidelines &amp; Techniques. 
WAI EOWG would like to print a pilot/test run of these early next week, for distribution &amp; feedback from W3C Member organizations at an upcoming meeting. 
We would like your feedback on the language on the card before it goes to a pilot run. 
Do you like this? - why? 
Not like this? - why? 
Fear it will be misunderstood? 
- how? 
Fear it will be misused? 
- how? 
Comments please to w3c-wai-eo@w3.org.

8Frames Some Web technologies cannot render frames. 
Label each frame with title or name, and include a linear version of its content within the NOFRAMES element. 
9Tables Some Web technologies have trouble reading tables. 
Avoid using tables to format text columns. 
Use the headers, scope and abbr attributes to mark-up complex tabular information.

TO:danield@w3.org 
My suggestion is that the message should be: Validation before browser rendering tests. 
Or change the last tip to: Evaluate youe site for accessibility. 
Run it through a validator, run it through a validator, run it through a validator, and take some other optional tests as well, such as Bobby, and rendering in some browsers/cofigurations. 
The reason for this is that my Opera3.2 sometimes (yes, its random) calls this tip number 5 instead of 10. (in the HTML version ofcourse) That's what happens when a DIV that starts before OL ends before /OL , or if you check your page in many browsers with images on and off, and Lynx, and a speaking browser, the big two, but not in a validator. 
Regards, Nir Dagan I don't understand. 
I did check my page with validator.w3.org, that's how I found out I could claim HTML4 strict compliance because OL start and LI value are deprecated (with no CSS1 equivalent BTW). 
...I *couldn't* claim.... to follow up on what Judy Brewer said: A little spin doctoring follows below. 
Just Do It. Ship me some.

2 Page organization A consistent page layout helps people with visual and learning disabilities. 
Use head-ings, lists and table summaries to make pages easy to scan. 
_Page organization_ Use headings, lists and summaries to keep the visitor oriented. 
Use clear and consistent page structure across pages. 
_Hypertext links_ sensitive _text_ in each link should _say_ where it will take you. 
Use TITLE for links containing only images. 
_Imagemaps_ Use a client-side MAP to give text to the links from image hotspots. 
_Frames_ Label each frame with TITLE or NAME and include a working hypertext start-page in a NOFRAMES section. 
_Tables_ used for layout must linearize to a sensible reading order. 
_Check your work_ Validate the HTML and CSS of your site. 
Check accessibility with available tools and usability with several browsers. 
Better: See www.w3.org/WAI for complete why and how. 
Recap: assumed policy decisions: KISS: less is more. 
This is just what you can put across in a short, punchy list. 
So it's not definitive. 
If everybody did just this, we would be _so_ much better off! 
This implies what I did in terms of "no excuses" elimination of rationale. 
In a 10-top list on a business card, you just tell 'em what to do. 
Let them follow the URL if they want to ask why. 
This is also why I suppressed marginal points like advanced table markup. 
Stating the link text requirement first, and in general terms, makes the image-map requirement a corollary. 
Make them consecutive with the link text rule first. 
Style note: Emphasis in LHS (topic name that leads off) is greater e.g. bold. 
Emphasis in RHS (e.g. _text_) is italic or color or something milder than in the LHS. 
Do use ALL CAPS for HTML keywords such as ALT and TITLE where the technical meaning is intended. 
Al I don't see in the card: -for image maps, use ALT text for all AREA elements. 
(item 4 doesn't do it for me) -also, repeat links as text on page -for images of text, put all text in ALT - pausing or freezing of blinking, scrolling, etc. which is priority 1 in GL I question how much we want to - tell people to not use tables for format. 
It's only priority 2 in guidelines, and it allowed until "a majority of browsers in use" support style sheets". 
I'm afraid so many authors rely on tables that they will rebel at card, with some justification. 
- spend card space talking about "consistent page organization" The only people who would respond to that design their pages consistently already, or at least think they do. 
Other comments It confused me to jump from web technologies not rendering frames, to labeling each frame with title or name, and then back to NOFRAMES Len [W3C logo] [WAI logo] Quick tips for making your site accessible to people with disabilities &amp; users of mobile or slow Web devices 1 Images, photographs &amp; animations Concisely describe the purpose or content of all visuals.
