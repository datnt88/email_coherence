I need to find out about how well browsers and screenreaders handle pictures with selectable areas, i.e. image maps. 
I have a sample image map at If you have a browser and screenreader... or a browser that combines those 
functions, would you take a quick look and see if it reads the text labels attached to the selectable area? 
Please email results back to me at kasday@acm.org . 
I'll post results back to the list. 
Thanks! 
Len p.s. I currently have access to two browsers. 
Only one of them sees the labels.

Lynx does. 
I imagine it works with a screeen reader pretty transparently. 
(This is probably obvious, but once it is said people can be sure that they don't need to repeat it, instead of just being fairly sure.

JAWS for Windows does. 
It reads, "North period. 
South period. 
East period. 
West period," as you tab to each link in IE 4.01.

pwWebSpeak 2.5 reads the alt text labels when stepping through the image map.

Please send me your findings even if you have a setup that someone else already looked at. 
Especially if you get different results (which has already happened in one case). 
It will be very interesting to track down why people got different results. 
Even if you get the same results, it will give a rough idea of how common various setups are... at least among non-shy folks on this list grin .

Leonard-- Using Emacspeak +W3 I did not have any trouble working with your client-side image map. 
Here is a trace of the interaction: 1) I open the page and read the contents --of course the clear textual description on your page makes it easier what to expect in the next stage of the interaction 2) I hit tab to move to the first active area on the page and I hear "Menu choice picture of a compass is 3) I hit enter and hear "image map" 4) Hitting tab now speaks the four possible choices 5) I type the first letter of my choice and hit enter to submit e.g. "N enter" for north.

IBM Home Page Reader (Version 2; see www.ibm.com/sns) comes to the map and speaks: "Map, skipping four items" as it should. 
If you stop and review the items in the map you hear the compass directions as you would expect. 
IBM Screen Reader/2 Netscape for OS/2 v2.02 does not render the alt text for image maps. 
Screen Reader/2 v2.01 ignores the maps completely. 
Lynx for OS/2 works with Screen Reader/2, and therefore speaks the directions in the image map.
