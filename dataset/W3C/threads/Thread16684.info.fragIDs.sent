<s> Hey everyone!  </s>
<s> Talk about a response and service from WTOP.  </s>
<s> The archived interview with Craig Luigart - Dept. of Education in "Ask the CIO" is now available, see http://www.wtopnews.com/askcio_luigart.shtm  </s>
<s> Would like to extend our thanks to alyson at WTOP for using light speed to repair the link!  </s>
<s> If you need a text version, pls let her know.  </s>
<s> Cheers, rob  </s>
<s> Just one "Huh?" moment as I read this: "Making sure that the blind person who is using a screen reader can hear the label and understand the nature of the image they are scrolling over with their mouse."  </s>
<s> Erm ... Hopefully just a slip of the lip/brain, rather than betraying lack of knowledge of how blind folks actually use computers.  </s>
<s> ... OK, OK! He's a big-picture guy, I geddit.  </s>
<s> :) Also liked their question about implementing "these accessibility things."  </s>
<s> But otherwise a very good article, &amp; credit to them for doing it.  </s>
<s> Patrick, also has accessibility doohickies &amp; thingumabobs  </s>
<s> I love seeing my uber-boss in the news, but I must complain a little -- since this article on Section 508 is not itself accessible!  </s>
<s> There is no meaningful ALT content to be found on any of the images.  </s>
