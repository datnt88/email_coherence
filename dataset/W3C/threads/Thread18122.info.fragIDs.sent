<s> If you are planning to submit a minority opinion it would please the chair and the editors to at least know the intention before 18 October in the preparation of last call materials.  </s>

<s> I apologize for the late hit, here.  </s>
<s> I know this was discussed in the group and I did not participate.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, Jon raised this as an example of guidelines language that should be aligned across the various guidelines, and that reminded me to check what you have actually done.  </s>
<s> The "equivalent vs. equivalency target" definitions in this volume are not the same definition of "equivalent" as in math, English or the WCAG and the math, English and WCAG sense is appropriate in this context, and the usage currently in the draft is not.  </s>
<s> The purity of the symmetry of equivalence relationships, which is one of their standard properties, should be exploited in sending our message.? It is important to the principles that we should be supporting across all the guidelines.?  </s>
<s> This is to say, it is important that the peernes of any equivalence groups be reflected in our language.  </s>

<s> The current language (in the 29 Sept. Draft) is just primary/alternate content under new labels.? Using a perfectly good English word to mean something else detracts from the clarity of our message, and using anything other than the standard meaning of equivalent in places such as Checkpoint 2.3 states the wrong requirement.  </s>
<s> There is no need to go to Terms of Art to say what needs to be said in 2.3 etc.  </s>
<s> For example, one could rewrite 2.3 as follows: Change to 2.3 Where there are multiple fragments of content within a document which are equivalent in the senses that they convey the same information, closely or roughly; provide easy access to any equivalent among the range of equivalents.  </s>
<s> This shall be done through at least one of the following mechanisms: (1) allowing configuration to render one equivalent instead of another; (2) allowing configuration to render more than one equivalent; (3) allowing the user to a displayed equivalent and then inspect any equivalents of the selected item; (4) providing a direct link to another (each other) equivalent in content, just before or after a displayed equivalent in document order.  </s>
<s> [Priority 1]  </s>
<s> From [for reference]  </s>
<s> 2.3 Provide easy access to each [167]equivalent and each [168]equivalency target through at least one of the following mechanisms: (1) allowing configuration to render the equivalent instead of the equivalency target; (2) allowing configuration to render the equivalent in addition to the equivalency target; (3) allowing the user to select the equivalency target and then inspect its equivalents; (4) providing a direct link to the equivalent in content, just before or after the equivalency target in document order.  </s>
<s> [Priority 1] Al  </s>
<s> Agreed.  </s>
<s> Dan Connolly made a similar remark to me.  </s>
<s> And I think Eric chose "equivalency target" for consistency with "text equivalent" from WCAG.  </s>
<s> So by using "equivalent" without symmetry, we've lost from the start.  </s>
<s> The question now is: do we complete the trio with the same terminology, or break and find something else?  </s>
