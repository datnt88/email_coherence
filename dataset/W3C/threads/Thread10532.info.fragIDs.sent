<s> Aaron, I note that the RDF/XML MIME registration draft has expired [1] (they do, after 6 months, per IETF rules and practice).  </s>
<s> Could you please resubmit what you have to keep it alive?  </s>
<s> The last known version was -03.  </s>
<s> It would be great if this included the changes agreed since your call-for-review, but anything you have is better than nothing.  </s>
<s> Thanks!  </s>

<s> I thought I had submitted it, but it looks like I forgot to change the publication (and therefore expiration) date.  </s>
<s> I've fixed it and submitted it again.  </s>
