Lisa, The links on the left poanel are not readable to me, on my system they are bright cyan on cyan, and when visited they're bright purple on cyan. 
This is because the colours of the link pseudo classes fails cascading. 
Colour cascading also fails for the links at the bottom of the pages. 
I find it a bit confusing to have two links for one page. 
To my humble oppinion it would be better to either have one 'About' link, or to have an 'About NEWD' and an 'About IDEA NS' page. 
The Membership application page (less confusingly also called 'Membership Application Form') doesn't have initial values. 
This had posed some trouble in some assistive technology in the past (don;t know current status.) On the FAQ page the three links at the top do not have non link characters between them. 
This causes my screen- reader to rattle them as one continues flow of words. 
On the FAQ the questions more meem to be the answers and visa versa. 
Better take a more bold / larger typeface for the question then for the answer. 
As an alternative the same font like all other paragraph text could be used, and then to have the answers indented using a definition list. 
(This would also look great in lynx.) On the home page the logo's could be alted to let everybody know whose they are. 
At for last it might or might not be a bit overkill to have the links on the left also at the bottom, since the ones on the left can be useable for every one. 
Christian Hi All, I tested this site for visual disabilities and the design held up at a 28 point font and the colour combo was used by other major sites for the visually impaired. 
However, the organization and I are curious about the following: The colours and font that are on the site, are they accessible for Assistive devices and for persons with visual disabilities? 
What do you think? 
Here is a test page to look at: Can I do better? 
How would you change it? 
Thanks for the feedback Lisa Microsoft products are susceptible to a large variety of viruses, worms, and other fauna.

Thanks for the feedback Lisa IMHO the contrast between the link text and the backgound for the nav menu isn't enough. 
Essentially it's blue on blue and although I'm not colourblind or visually impaired instinct tells me that you really should use a different colour for the menu.

Lisa, The home page has two priority 2 (AA) errors in Bobby - both of which should be fixable. 
So, a pretty impressive start! 
It all works in Lynx, so even though you have used tables, they linearise well. 
(By using CSS styles to position the left panel, you could have the main content first and that would be even better.) Contrast: blue links on cyan don't have a very good tonal contrast - try a greyscale screenshot to see what I mean - tricky for those with low acuity. 
(Improved by the yellow hover colour, but you have to be on the link to get the benefit - not helpful for scanning.) 
More systematic use of heading structures is good, to help screen reader users to envisage the structure of the page. 
E.g. on disability resources page, I'd have used H1 for the title and H2 for the links, not H2 and P. The font you use for headings doesn't look to be optimised for screen use and isn't as readable as, for example, Georgia would be. 
Likewise, Arial vs Verdana for the body font. 
Using a larger than default line-height to give more space can make it less tiring to read big chunks of text, but you have to take special action to avoid problems with Netscape 4 (if you support that in style sheets) BTW, two minor observations: "Your Invited to Our Annual General Meeting and Showcase Fair" and "FAQ's" on newsletters page - don't just rely on Word to pick up typos G ; and the font for links in the last footer section is set very small - I suspect a double percentage somewhere in the style sheet without looking further into this. 
If you want more info on any of these, get back to me off-list. 
Kind regards, Lois Wakeman
