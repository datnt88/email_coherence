Hi, I received an inquiry recently that I am unclear of the answer to, and I thought someone on this list might know. 
If you have multiple graphics in a row that also happen to be links, does the link separation rule still apply? 
Any input appreciated.

In regard to separating graphic-links. 
What I do as an author is the following: 
Separate icon-links with a 1 pixel transparent gif with the alt text of * or some other separating character. 
Height and width being specified. 
(see e.g. http://www.econ.upf.es/%7Edagan/about.html ) 
This should work fine in browsers that implement ALT text correctly. 
(e.g. Lynx). 
In graphical browsers it looks almost like not separating the links.(e.g. Netscape 3 or 4). 
For both cases of images on or off. 
(I have no clue what a screen reader does here) However it seems that graphical browsers do not implement ALT text correctly. 
They either don't show it, cut it short if it doesn't fit the box, or show it as a tooltip only when one points the mouse to the box of the graphic. 
In my view: 1. separating text-links is important from the point of view of usability of sighted users, therefore separating icon-links is a good idea, even without considering accessibility. 
(sighted users don't get the images if they don't want them, and then they should get separated text links.) 2. Guidelines of authoring should be based primerly on what the specs say. 
This is the only way to coordinate actions of authors and browser vendors. 
(this is most relevant for ALT and title attributes).

I don't understand this. 
You say that "works fine in browsers that implement ALT text correctly (e.g. Lynx)" but aren't you as a page authoring creating markup just so that LYNX reads ALT correctly? 
Why the need for link separators to begin with? 
Internet Explorer renders ALT text in the way that makes the most sense to everyone. 
If a screen reader is present, it displays all of the ALT text. 
IE4.01 also has a switch that can manually turn this behavior on. 
Why create more markup (=work) for the authors just to separate the links?

[this is a thread for GL, not IG, so I'm moving it here. 
This message is on both but please next reply only on GL] 
This is another Interim guideline, only Recommended. 
(one that I usually don't apply in the documents I authored) 
I think that text links that are not separated may confuse a sighted user, who may think that two words of different links belong to the same link. 
This reduces uasability. 
Therefore I attempt to separate them. 
With icon links, there is no need for a user that sees the icons to create additional separation, since the icons look sufficiently separate, and there is no room for confusion. 
My additional work and markup was to improve rendering in text-only or non-visual media, in a way that I hope does not make problems to any user.
