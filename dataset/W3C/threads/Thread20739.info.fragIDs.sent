<s> I have been experimenting with Dia (actually the windows version: http://dia-installer.sourceforge.net/ ) and this is meant to produce SVG files, which it does, but they start with !DOCTYPE svg PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD SVG 20000802//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/CR-SVG-20000802/DTD/svg-20000802.dtd" Which is not the 1.0 scheme as described on the SVG page: When I put the images into Amaya they come up almost invisible.  </s>
<s> I have tried changing the header in one file to agree with the 1.0 spec to fudge this, but it still displays incorrectly.  </s>
<s> So the question is: "is the bug in Amaya, in Dia, or are they using incompatible SVG specs?".  </s>
<s> To answer that I need a validator for SVG, but I cannot find one.  </s>
<s> Is this because there isn't one, or have I just not found it yet?  </s>
<s> If there is one, I can check the images are valid before asking anything else, otherwise, would the Amaya team like to have such an image to explore?  </s>

<s> This is not a Dia Bug.  </s>
<s> Dia's export filter seems to work pretty well, based on the august SVG specification, before that SVG 1.0 was released as a recommandation.  </s>
<s> That's why Doctype declaration differs.  </s>
<s> Amaya recognizes Dia's SVG, but the current implementation of SVG in Amaya is not yet complete.  </s>
<s> The Dialog named "Parsing error", that can be accessed from the view menu, diplays warnings for unsupported SVG tags in Amaya.  </s>
<s> There isn't any SVG validator for now.  </s>

<s> Thank you.  </s>
<s> I think that answers everything I need to know at the moement.  </s>
