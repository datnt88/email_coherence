For those of you who don't know, Sean is a member of the W3C's Web Accessibility Initiative, and practically in an expert in HTML and its cousins. 
I think all of his comments are very good and should be seriously considered. 
4) IBUG: Temporary redirects or "Found" should have the original URI displayed, not the new one [2]! 
This is an impotant Axiom: do not treat HTTP temporary redirects as permanent redirects. 
Also, when Amaya is used to link to this file, the first URI should be used, not the temporary one. 
Speaking of that, what are the Amaya team's thoughts on all of the CUAP recommendations (small r): Recently, the Mozilla team has reported on the status of their implementation of these features: I believe that as part of Amaya's job to demonstrate the power of Web technologies, it is also essential that it get the user interface right. 
The W3C has put together a great set of suggestions and I'd love to see Amaya implement most of them. 
I think this will set a great example and take a leading role, demonstrating to other browser makers. 
I understand that the Amaya team is very busy, but I hope that you can take some time to look at these problems. 
Thanks for your help.

Lately, I am having to use Amaya more and more, and in doing so, I found that I had a few comments (quibbles first, then praise) in case anyone is interested, arranged as important bugs (IBUG), bugs (BUG), and features (FEATURE). 
1) IBUG: It rearranges my code... this is very frustrating indeed, not only because I like neat source code, but because (for example) if you use span in pre , it messes up the whitespace. 
If I take the DTD or the XML PI out, Amaya pops it straight back in. 
Maybe there is a "preserve source code" feature in there somewhere... if so, then I think it should be turned on as a default setting - why would anyone want it messing about with their code (unless the code was wrong)? 
2) IBUG: One of the WCAG techniques is to use map to group HyperText links [1]... and yet Amaya does not seem to display map even when it is used in this way. 
3) IBUG: Selecting text in the main or source windows is staggeringly slow... sometimes it seems to rescan the whole lot one line at a time. 
I do a lot of selecting / copying / pasting and so on, so this is particularly annoying. 
[I know that I could use shift+left click, but this doesn't seem all that intuitive to me - I want it to select properly when dragging]. 4) IBUG: Temporary redirects or "Found" should have the original URI displayed, not the new one [2]! 
This is an impotant Axiom: do not treat HTTP temporary redirects as permanent redirects. 
Also, when Amaya is used to link to this file, the first URI should be used, not the temporary one. 
5) BUG: Line breaks are represented strangely in the output: if viewed in notepad it shows up as little squares, although wordpad shows them O.K. This is probably some whitespace programming hack, but it just niggles me. 
6) BUG: Why is "information type" under the style menu? 
Semantic elements under style?? 
I think that they should be under "types", would be more appropriate. 
7) BUG: The latest build (see below for my version details) crashes an awful lot. 
For example, it crashed when selecting to enable a stylesheet, it crashed when synchronizing the source, it crashed when spellchecking a large document... 
That's fairly unaviodable, but what is aviodable is crashing when browsing. 
Why oh why can't Dave Raggett's HTML Tidy be built into it somehow? 
Yes, this would slow the page rendering times down, but I'd rather have slow pages than no pages. 
8) BUG: It seems difficult/impossible to add rel/rev attributes to a after creating the link. 
9) BUG: It gives phantom parsing errors, such as "line 696, char 12: not well-formed" - this particular document only had 695 lines in it, and was indeed well formed XML. 
10) BUG: Why doesn't "show targets" tell you what that target is? 
11) BUG: Sometimes "replace and add to dictionary" doesn't addthe word to the dictionary in the spellchecker (I haven't verified this fact), and the spellchecker itself is very buggy: e.g. it puts a dummy character in front of any first sentence word in a pre section, and suggests you correct it. 
Annoying if you have a large pre section. 
12) FEATURE: It automatically adds "made by Amaya" meta tag at the top. 
Can we have an RDF verson of this? 
13) FEATURE: Annotations; it would be nice to be able to annotate the document itself with RDF if you control it, or possibly link to them with a "rel" - i.e. "these are annotations that the author has made". 
14) FEATURE: Why is there no "right click" menu feature, with items such as "copy shortcut", and so on? 
I presume that'll be a WAI issue, but it wouldn't be all that difficult to program a keyboard equivalent. 
15) FEATURE: Is there anyway to use a file on hard drive as a template? 
For those of us who can't install template servers... 
I presume that I could just edit the temple files in the Amaya directory, but what if I wanted to use a file elsewhere - on my home server for instance. 
Some of these gripes will most likely have very simple answers that I have just overlooked, but I hope that some will aid development. 
For the record, I'm using Amaya V4.3.2 on Windows 98, which didn't have the cleanest install in the world... 
As for the good stuff... well the best feature is that to link to another page, you can simply select the text, click "link" and then click on the page in question - very much like the ol' original WorldWideWeb browser. 
I like the "PUT" fuction as well, especially now I've managed to get a PUT scipt to work on my server. 
I suppose there are lots of good features really, like mandatory alt text, and difficult to find formatting elements. 
Apologies if some of this stuff has come up before, or if any of this taps a recurring theme.

Some responses from an Amaya user... 1) IBUG: It rearranges my code... this is very frustrating indeed, not only because I like neat source code, but because (for example) if you use span in pre , it messes up the whitespace. 
If I take the DTD or the XML PI out, Amaya pops it straight back in. 
Maybe there is a "preserve source code" feature in there somewhere... if so, then I think it should be turned on as a default setting - why would anyone want it messing about with their code (unless the code was wrong)? 
CMN Nope, there is no such feature. 
I agree that it would be nice, but considering that Amaya aims to always have valid code, may need some careful thinking. 
As I understand it the main barrier at the moment is that it would involve rewriting the stuff that serialises the internal document to source code, which woulds slow it down a fair bit. 
(I guess it wouold involve a comparison of the new version with the source view as a simple but not very effective method). 
2) IBUG: One of the WCAG techniques is to use map to group HyperText links [1]... and yet Amaya does not seem to display map even when it is used in this way. 
CMN Yes, this is an important bug. 
It s noted as something that should be fixed. 
I would like to have done it, but never found the time to make it work, and don't currently have a development environment :( 6) BUG: Why is "information type" under the style menu? 
Semantic elements under style?? 
I think that they should be under "types", would be more appropriate. 
CMN It is also a problem that there are no menu or keyboard access methods for graphics functions. 
Since I often end up editing graphics through the structure view (I do not have good control with a mouse) this would be helpful, as well as an accessibility requirement. 
8) BUG: It seems difficult/impossible to add rel/rev attributes to a after creating the link. 
CMN Should be easy. 
Select the link (get there, and then use f2/esc (windows/unix) to make sure it is the a element that is selected) and then select the attributes menu. 
10) BUG: Why doesn't "show targets" tell you what that target is? 
CMN I don't understand the question. 
Could you explain again please? 
15) FEATURE: Is there anyway to use a file on hard drive as a template? 
For those of us who can't install template servers... 
I presume that I could just edit the temple files in the Amaya directory, but what if I wanted to use a file elsewhere - on my home server for instance. 
CMN I used to use a file: URI as my template server - it referred to a page that included a list of files I used for templates. 
I haven't checked that in newer versions, but it should work. 
cheers chaals Sorry for the delay, my mailer was out of service. 
The support of preserve is in the todo list of Amaya. 
I know that problem. 
If you consider that it's important to support that in Amaya we can change our priorities. 
We made some progresses in the last version, but Amaya is still redisplaying too often. 
We'll check the specification. 
The problem comes here from notepad which needs the ^M to work correctly. 
Our position is to not work differently on a Windows and on a Unix platform (the Web should be platform independent). 
Any modern Web tool is able to read a Web page without ^M. 
Because these tags work like a presentation style. 
There are toggles that set/unset the tag around the current selection. 
It's not the case for other entries in the type menu. 
I tested these functions on a Windows98 platform and they worked. 
Could you send us a page that shows these crashes. 
We don't have the manpower to do that. 
This is listed in open projects concerning Amaya (http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/Stage.html). 
Any contributor is welcome. 
When the element a is selected, you can add this attribute. 
To select an anchor you can select the text within the anchor then hit the key F2. 
This bug is detected by Expat and I never saw this kind of bug. 
Are you sure that all tags are correctly ended. 
You can send us the URI if you don't find any cause of the error. 
Show targets shows all elements that can be used as a target (anchors with an attribute name, elements with an attribute id). 
It doesn't add words with special characters, but no problem with other words. 
They are added to your private dictionary.DCT 
The character newline is not interpreted as a separator by the spell checker. 
This is a bug we'll fix as soon as possible. 
Good idea. 
Probably yes. 
Our plan is to use the right button to open a linked page into a new window. 
Not yet. 
See open projects (http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/Stage.html). 
The support of preserve is in the todo list of Amaya. 
Looking forward to it (but I guess it won't be very soon?) I know that problem. 
If you consider that it's important to support that in Amaya we can change our priorities. 
I consider that it is important both for supporting accessibility and supporting HTML. 
It should be possible to create the element from the types menu, and to render it if it has block content. 
Because these tags work like a presentation style. 
There are toggles that set/unset the tag around the current selection. 
It's not the case for other entries in the type menu. 
But they are not presentation styles, so it is a little confusing and may encourage an author to understand wrongly. 
Show targets shows all elements that can be used as a target (anchors with an attribute name, elements with an attribute id). 
Could the support of this be worked into support for a user agent style sheet, plus support of the content() CSS property and :before pseudo-element?
