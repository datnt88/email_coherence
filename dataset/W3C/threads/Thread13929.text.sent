CPL:: I am starting this new thread based on the following comment made by Daniel Dardailler regarding the mention of TABLES in the recommendation to use Style Sheets in the Page Author Guideline: DD:: Reality check. 
I think it is not reasonable to mark as "required" not using table to layout things, and to put it in the same bullet list as horrible things like converting text to image or using 1pixel gif. 
CSS2 positioning will provide better support for absolute position of boxes on page and there is already some floating properties in CSS1, but we're still far from the implicit-rescaling and the simple layout model provided by table rows and columns. 
Plus there are thousands of such tables out already and I don't see them moving to any kind of positioning anytime soon (W3C being on my top list). 
I would argue for talking about TABLE in the table section only, while exposing the details of making TABLE (even used for layout) accessible. 
More comments there. 
End DD. CPL:: I think we need to discuss this. 
My own opinion is that it is reasonable to leave the statement: "Use style sheets rather than:... using tables or PRE elements to layout pages". 
A strong statement such as that may catch an author's eye and cause them to think about their techniques. 
Perhaps the statement should link to the TABLEs section. 
I have been looking at example pages that use the MS IE 3.0 supported version of CSS(1), and they chock full of TABLES to overcome the deficiencies of that version. 
People are likely to continue to use both CSS and TABLES to achieve their goals, since TABLES are sometimes easier and more logical as Daniel mentions.

After reading the rest of Daniel's message, I saw that TABLES came up again. 
Why don't we use this thread to discuss the "required versus recommended" status of advising against tables for layout of text wherever it appears?

I did not mean to say that tables used as toolbars were inaccessible, I merely wished to point out that in the categorization of tables based on the author's intent, this specific category was not covered by either of DD's classes. 
I think 1 row/n columns table (e.g. a toolbar) fits my description of simple layout table. 
I think this kind of tables would benefit maybe from getting a class=toolbar attached to it (or some more generic name) and maybe some scope attribute but otherwise are fully accessible. 
The point of this recommendation is that table markup which does not really represent a table, and which would not be read correctly if rendered in speech as a table, should not be used to control visual layout. 
This can be a long term recommendation, but it is important that authors move toward style sheets as quickly as possible. 
I recognise Daniel's point that CSS positioning has not been fully implemented yet, but surely it will be available next year. 
It is therefore desirable to distinguish those instances in which the employment of table markup can be regarded as genuine from those in which it can not. 
JW:: This should be a required, but long term, recommendation in respect of HTML authors. 
It should be a short term recommendation in the authoring tool guidelines: as soon as the CSS 2 specification is completed, authoring tools should be expected to implement positioning. 
The abuse of table markup is simply wrong in principle, as it is contrary to the meaning and intention of the HTML. 
Such practice should be consistently discouraged, particularly once an alternative, namely CSS positioning, is widely available. 
to follow up on what Daniel Dardailler said: ASG:: Three points: First: fully accessible may require that the ALT text for the buttons is present, appropriate, and dodges known limitations of commonly used browsers in presenting ALT text (sigh). 
Second: I think that class="toolbar" may be too broad, not too specific. 
In other words, perhaps "navigation" would be the right class, if it is a toolbar supporting site navigation. 
There is a toolbar in the outer context that includes open, mail, etc verbs that are browser functions independent of the current document and current focus in the document. 
Consider the common frameset composed of a "credits" frame across the top of the screen, a "navigation" frame down the left hand margin under the top, and a "current" frame filling the remaining area reaching down to the lower-right hand corner. 
But don't take my answer, this is the appropriate subject area for a classification study in the GL group. 
Third: It would be good to do a comparative analysis of different ways to implement toolbars and make them accessible. 
It may turn out that after weighing both author and reader concerns, that using a table is a better option than using other techniques such as a merged image with a sensitivity map. 
A design study comparing approaches to toolbars would be another valuable activity that I suspect fits the focus of the GL group well. 
-- Al Gilman [snip] ASG:: Enforcing some "meaning" or "intention" for HTML structures such as TABLE that is narrower than the range of useful things that the structure can and will do for you will likely be futile. 
HTML is a win because it is so natural. 
The rule of natural language is "Whatever works." 
This is short for the orthodox sentence "Whatever works, goes." 
The syntactically unorthodox form is frequently used because it is usually understood. 
Occam's razor applies to languages and media. 
The fewer rules one has to follow to get one's point across, the more desirable the language or medium. 
-- Al JW:: However, it is the semantic value of the HTML markup which is relied upon by, for instance, braille and audio formatting software to produce an appropriate rendering in these media. 
Such a process requires consistency in the meanings conveyed by the HTML elements and attributes, through which the author's intention is manifested. 
Only under this condition especially in the absence of braille or audio style sheets supplied by the author, can the output software transform the structure and content of the document into a format that will be appropriate, without misleading the reader. 
The question which thus falls to be considered, and this is best done with the aid of examples rather than by attempting a purely a priori analysis, is whether those structures which, semantically at least, are not genuine tables would be misunderstood or inappropriately formatted if the formatting algorithms that a braille or audio application would ordinarily apply to tables were invoked. 
To the extent that such a problem would arise, there is a need for authors to avoid table markup in cases where it is so contrary to the intended semantics as to result in misleading output in different media. 
Two types of solution are available. 
Either the bad practices could be dispensed with in favour of CSS positioning, or those practices could be accepted, but accommodations made in the HTML markup (E.G. standardised class names) which alert formatting software to the fact that what appears to be a table is actually not so. 
My preference is for the first of these options. 
To the extent that the decision of whether to use table markup or style sheets will often be made automatically by authoring tools rather than by authors themselves, there will be no additional burdens imposed on the developers of HTML documents once CSS positioning is widely available. 
In the long term therefore, I think the balance of these considerations leads to the conclusion that the abuse of table markup ought to be discouraged and that more appropriate strategies, involving style sheets, provide a semantically appropriate solution that satisfies the requirements of all media. 
Natural language affords a variety of means by which unorthodox usage can be explained in order to avoid misunderstanding. 
HTML, is much less flexible in this respect, and therefore the intended correlation between markup and meaning, as defined in the specification, needs to be observed more strictly. 
The formatting of documents in braille and audio media is a process which highlights the fundamental importance of this requirement.
