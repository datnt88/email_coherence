<s> Amaya 1.4 and 1.3 used to work fine for me in that regard.  </s>
<s> I should probably add that I am using precompiled binaries, and that my machine is running Solaris 2.6.  </s>

<s> If you're using a proxy, you'll need to configure Amaya.  </s>
<s> This is exactly what I did.  </s>
<s> In the Preferences/Proxy dialog box, I indicated the name of the proxy server (proxy.unige.ch) and the local domain name for which the proxy shouldn't be used (.unige.ch).  </s>

<s> I should probably point out that I was trying to reach the  </s>
<s> HTTP server that runs on my own workstation (cuisung.unige.ch).  </s>
<s> As soon as I erased the proxy information, the access to my server worked ok.  </s>
<s> Note that Amaya doesn't implement Netscape's autoproxy mechanism.  </s>
<s> I am using plain manual proxy config.  </s>
<s> I just checked it and it works.  </s>
<s> So, I think the problem is not with our proxy, but with my configuring Amaya to use it.  </s>

<s> Yes, the proxy configuration mechanism is quite misleading.  </s>

<s> You have to declare your proxy as follows:  </s>
<s> My guess is that you forgot to add the "http://" string.  </s>
<s> You can also avoid using a proxy to access your local server using the Proxy Menu/No proxy.. entry, and setting it up as: cuisung.unige.ch  </s>
<s> No need to put http:// in this case.  </s>
