<s> DOM is especially important to developers like pwWebSpeak who will be using the DOM to assist in there own rendering.  </s>
<s> The lack of full implementation of DOM makes it difficult to use DOM to render all of the WWW content.  </s>
<s> For example in our own project here at UIUC we are using the Microsoft DOM for IE 4.0 and the current API to the DOM doesn't allow access to the text content of the CAPTIONS element.  </s>
<s> You can detect that the TABLE has a caption, and adjust formatting.  </s>
<s> But you cannot access the text content of the element.  </s>
<s> Clearly we want to make sure that these types of problems do not limit AT developers.  </s>
<s> Your concern probably rests with the use of accessibility APIs for use by technologies like screen readersc and that is required under under checkpoint 7.2.1.  </s>
<s> Checkpoint 7.2.1 could state this more clearly by adding the phrase "and rendered content" after the words "user interface".  </s>
<s> The new guideline would read: Checkpoint 7.2.1 Provide programatic access for dependent user agents to the user interface and rendered content by using operating system and development language accessibility resources and conventions.  </s>

<s> Jon, I still think that 7.2.6 has the guideline and the technique backwards.  </s>
<s> In all other aspects of the guidelines, we eschew direct reference to any particular method of providing access, and state what access or function should be provided.  </s>
<s> The techniques document should describe ways to do that.  </s>
<s> Following this model, 7.2.6 should read, "Provide full access to the content of the WWW to AT devices and dependent user agents."  </s>
<s> The techniques would include fully implementing DOM Level 1 and other DOM specifications that enhance access by people with disabilities.  </s>
<s> DOM is one specification for making content accessible.  </s>
<s> Other specifications could be developed that would be equally effective.  </s>
<s> (Although, being non-standard, they would be harder to develop for.) If the *guidelines* document specifies the DOM, we are saying that all other implementations are not valid.  </s>
<s> I don't think we want to do that.  </s>
