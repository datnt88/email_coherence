<s> As members of WAI/ER will know, I am developing a new Site Valet tool that combines WCAG-based accessibility reporting with validation.  </s>
<s> The WCAG reporting is based on Rick Joliffe's Schematron, and takes as its starting point the published WAI schema example.  </s>
<s> On test-driving the new tool (which is currently available online but is very much under-construction and could generate inconsistent results - caveat visitor), I am - perhaps unsurprisingly - confronted with a few gotchas, that appear to highlight inconsistencies in the WCAG itself.  </s>
<s> I'll deal with the first of these in detail now; perhaps we can establish some guidelines for how a tool such as mine should handle borderline cases.  </s>

<s> When confronted with Form elements, it complains "WCAG Checkpoint 1.1 An input element should have some descriptive text:an alt or longdesc attribute" This is correct according to the document linked at that point:  </s>
<s> As regards whether this is sensible, it seems to me to be at best marginal.  </s>
<s> Form Inputs as rendered in graphical browsers do not carry cues that are denied to other readers, so a page author who fails to provide adequate information is failing their mainstream users just as much as accessibility-challenged users, and should presumably be aware of the fact.  </s>
<s> Exceptions to this observation would appear to me to be pathologically-constructed cases.  </s>
<s> On following the "Techniques for checkpoint 1.1" link to I find that Form Inputs are here excluded from the list of elements that should have text equivalents.  </s>
<s> Neither is it required by which is rather confusingly linked from the previous document as "Checkpoint 1.1", while in fact being identical to it.  </s>
<s> I have discussed my own view regarding a particular checkpoint.  </s>
<s> But the purpose of this tool is to implement the WCAG, not my views.  </s>
<s> That leaves open the question of how to deal with cases where the WCAG itself appears inconsistent, other than to exercise my own judgement.  </s>
<s> You can test-drive the prototype tool at (bearing in mind that it is under active development, and may change at any time).  </s>

<s> This should apply only to graphical input elements such as: It doesn't apply to "ordinary" types of input elements.  </s>
<s> Techniques documents are non-normative and shouldn't be trusted (for whatever reason; I didn't create the "non-normative" vs "normative" distinction and frankly I don't care for it).  </s>
<s> Then again, WCAG 1.0 is a bit dubious in the "trust" category and that's one of the reasons that WCAG 2.0 is under development.  </s>
<s> WCAG 1.0 by its very nature requires judgment calls, and that means authoring tool developers (such as you) who are trying to create  </s>
<s> tools to support WCAG 1.0 will also have to make judgment calls.  </s>
<s> Luckily, in this case, the judgment call is pretty simple: the checkpoint only refers to non-text input forms which can't be rendered in non-graphical browsers.  </s>

<s> That is indeed my inclination.  </s>
<s> However, in this instance I was working from a starting point of someone else's judgement, which clearly differed from mine (and yours), as well as from the letter (if not the spirit) of the normative document.  </s>
<s> And one of Site Valet's "selling points" is conformance to published standards, as opposed to what some developer (you, me, anyone..) thought was a good idea.  </s>
<s> Ho Hum ... Nick Kew Site Valet - the essential service for anyone with a website.  </s>
<s> It is best to get the WCAG group themselves to resolve this as an issue (it should take them very little time) but as I understand it being a member of the group, the lists are not exhaustive.  </s>
<s> If there is a checkpoint you should interpret the text of the checkpoint, and regard the lists and other examples as merely guiding examples rather than definitive sets of requirements.  </s>
