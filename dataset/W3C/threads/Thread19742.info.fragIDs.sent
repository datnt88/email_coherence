About help. 
The online help is okay, but some of us like to work offline. 
The windows 95 release should contain the help file in the installation package. 
For our testing purposes, could you provide a menu to the help 
You're right. 
We 'll do that in next release. 
htmls or a text file for download and/or printing? 
You could put it in the user directory. 
Sometimes, I lose the address bar in help. 
There shouldn't be an address bar in the help window, but this will also go away if you are going to use the Win95 help functions. 
At the moment, you can fetch the documentation tar file at: When you're on the main Manual page, you can build the whole document by using the MakeBook command in menu Special and after print it. 
I am getting several invalid page faults as I jump around in Amaya. 
I am having trouble recreating them, but they seem to be in WWWTRANS.DLL [0137:01043fdl]. 
You should be able to change documents by changing the address line and pressing enter. 
Enter seems to have no effect when the address line is in focus.

Hi, 
Browser: ? 
According to the documentation, the active links and target links are respectively blue and green. 
Not true. 
The color specified in the HTML "body" statement is default. 
Irene or Vincent, could you please comment this report about colors (align and fonts too)? 
? Graphics - the browser doesn't recognize transparent GIFs 
If you have a glance at amaya on Linux, you will see that transparent gifs are recognized. 
This is not the case in the version released on Windows but it will be in the next release (I already treat transparent gifs). 
- the "align" attribute in the "img" statement not recognized - browser apparently only uses a 16 color pallet (probably windows colors). 
I would suggest the use of the Netscape 224 (I think) colors as a minimum. 
Basically, if you use true colors (either 16, 24 and 32 bits) you will have no problem. 
There is a problem with 256 colors mode and I'm working on it. 
16 colors mode is not supported "yet" by Amaya. 
? Font sizes are way off where the "size" attribute is used in the "font" statement, i.e., a font size=2 in the HTML renders an almost invisible text line by the browser.
