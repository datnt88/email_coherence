Hi Lynn-- After looking at your site, I noticed that the type size on the navigation buttons is very small and hard to read. 
I'm not visually impaired, unless you count contact lens! 
I can't comment on the rest, as I do not use assistive technologies to browse. 
So far, only a few pages have been developed, we are interested in comments about what is right and wrong about the design so far.

We are trying at James Cook University to develop a very accessible web site. 
The target clients are those who may have cognitive problems after an accident. 
So far, only a few pages have been developed, we are interested in comments about what is right and wrong about the design so far. 
Only the Module 1 and unit 1 links work as yet.

Lynn what sorts of problems in particular do your target audience have - can you give some examples? 
I wondered if simplifying the language a bit and using styles in the text to highlight would be helpful. 
The light blue on dark blue also seemed like a choice that doesn't give a lot of contrast. 
I like the use of CSS for layout. 
The page linearises well in a text-only browser. 
I'm looking forward to seeing it develop. 
cheers Charles McCathieNevile

I haven't looked at your pages -- and in truth, I don't feel qualified to comment on accessibility for cognitive disabilities (yet) because the field is (currently) rather unexplored -- but I would like to thank you for the way you phrased your question. 
We use "accessible" and "inaccessible" as shorthand all the time, but in truth, accessibility as a concept depends on having a _subject_ (or is it an object?) of the sort "accessible _to_ ***." 
Our goal is to make the content accessible _to_ everyone from an idealistic standpoint; accessible _to_ "as many people as we possibly can, given our own limitations" from a practical standpoint. 
It's very good that you've identified who your audience is, because that helps us to better gauge the effects of your design practices upon your target audience.
