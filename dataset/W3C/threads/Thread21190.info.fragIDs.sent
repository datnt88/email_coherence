<s> Version: 7.2 Platform:X11 on Mac OSX 10.2.4 I am unable to cut/paste/copy into or out of the URI/Open dialogue box at the top of the main amaya window.  </s>
<s> Also unable to cut/paste/copy into the attribute dialog box when completing an href.  </s>
<s> I used to be able to do this in the Windows version.  </s>
<s> Any tips or is this a bug?  </s>
<s> Thanks, Danny  </s>
<s> Amaya has nothing to do with this.  </s>
<s> Apple's X11 uses the same copy/paste mecanism as usual X11.  </s>
<s> You have to copy/paste using the "middle" mouse button.  </s>
<s> In X11's preferences, there's an "input" section which enables middle and right buttons emulation (option click and command click respectively).  </s>
