Hi folks, in the RDF Schema definition of OWL (www.w3.org/2002/07/owl) you use rdf:List (this does not exist in the RDF namespace). 
I propose to change it to rdf:Seq. 
Ciao, Karsten Tolle Hi, OK, I found the following in the Text. 
Several components employ lists constructed using the rdf:List, rdf:first, rdf:rest, rdf:nil, and rdf:parseType="Collection" vocabulary [Ed: identify link] recently added to RDF. 
But could tell me someone where to find more information on the new added components!? ... and what about 'rdf:parseType="owl:collection"' compared to rdf:parseType="Collection"? 
Thanks, Karsten Karsten, Several components employ lists constructed using the rdf:List, rdf:first, rdf:rest, rdf:nil, and rdf:parseType="Collection" vocabulary [Ed: identify link] recently added to RDF. you should find them really soon in RDFCore it must be rdf:parseType="Collection" Jos De Roo, AGFA http://www.agfa.com/w3c/jdroo/ 
As Jos de Roo implied, a recent decision of the RDF Core WG has added rdf:List, rdf:first, rdf:rest, and rdf:nil and rdf:ParseType="Collection" to RDF. 
This decision is so new that it had not even made it into any of the editor's draft documents for the RDF Core WG when the WebOnt documents were created. 
There is still only a note in the editor's draft of the new RDF syntax document at the beginning of As far as the WebOnt documents go, I just noticed that the abstract syntax document uses the owl: versions of these tokens, which is wrong, and will be changed. 
As far as I can tell the other documents do not have any errors in this area. 
Peter F. Patel-Schneider Hi Peter and Jos I am wondering whether the addition of rdf:List and rdf:ParseType="Collection" in the RDFMS makes redundant previous constructs like rdf:Seq and rdf:Alt. 
From formal viewpoint using lists we can represent both Seqs and Alts. 
I have two questions: a) What is the status of rdf:List as far rdfs is concerned? 
Is-it a class (instances have a URI) or a structured value (instances without a URI) ? 
b) Why not go one step further in the RDFMS refinement and define also types for list elements: e.g., list of integers, strings, URIs? 
Note that this is of paramount importance for interpreting the results of an rdf query returned as collections.
