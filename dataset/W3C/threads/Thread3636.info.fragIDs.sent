I must admit I'm struggling to find a concise alternative. 
How about "What directions are common localization languages written in?" 
That's better, avoids the odd "localized languages", but "A preposition is a word one should not end a sentence with." 
Suggestion: "What are the writing directions of common localization target languages?" 
Not that I care that much...

Very nice! 
One question, though: what is a "localized language"?

Tex, Its up to you. 
If you want to make the change let me know and I'll do it. 
Note that I already changed the Urdu thing. 
Let me know in concise, summary form what other changes you want to make in the light of recent qalam feedback, and I'll do those too.

Fran?ois, thanks for the suggestion. 
Richard, yes I am compiling feedback and will suggest changes, probably over the weekend. 
I was going to leave Urdu and add a footnote, but ok. tex
