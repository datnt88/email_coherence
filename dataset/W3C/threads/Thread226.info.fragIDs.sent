<s> Lately I seem to be on an unintentional crusade to convert all of Tidy's errors into warnings.  </s>
<s> :) I think the error "missing quotemark for attribute value" (search for "SUSPECTED_MISSING_QUOTE" in lexer.c) could be changed to a warning.  </s>
<s> I've tried this in Java Tidy.  </s>
<s> The lexer continues just fine after this condition is detected.  </s>
<s> The resulting attribute value agrees with IE and Netscape.  </s>
<s> (IE and Netscape appear to accept any number of newlines and unencoded " " and " " inside of quoted attribute values.  </s>
<s> Of course, Tidy will output " " and " " as properly encoded entities, which IE and Netscape also accept.) Am I overlooking something?  </s>

<s> HTML 4.0 or perhaps 4.01 requires the quotes.  </s>
<s> They are not optional there.  </s>

<s> Sorry if I was unclear.  </s>
<s> Tidy divides its complaints into two categories: warnings and errors.  </s>
<s> Both identify illegal/deprecated/etc.  </s>
<s> constructs that authors should be aware of.  </s>
<s> The key difference is that errors prevent Tidy from producing an output document.  </s>
<s> This is crucial for some applications (like ours!  </s>
<s> :) ).  </s>
<s> Almost all of Tidy's complaints are warnings.  </s>
<s> I think this is what makes HTML Tidy so valuable.  </s>
<s> There are other HTML "verifiers" out there, but they do not "tidy"; to them everything is an error.  </s>
<s> With that point of view, the more Tidy can issue warnings rather than errors, the better.  </s>
<s> So my question is: Everything seems to be in place for Tidy to treat a missing quotemark as a warning, yet Tidy is treating it as an error.  </s>
<s> Is this an oversight or perhaps a vestige of earlier versions?  </s>
<s> Or have I overlooked something and/or are my assumptions faulty?  </s>
<s> Thanks, Randy  </s>
