Hi, I am currently working on a project on persistent connection and non-persistent connection.

Yes. There is to be no Netscape 5. The next version (now in pre-release alpha) is 6. Arithere is no spoon 
Yep, Netscape had to make sure they had a higher version number than Internet Explorer because the version number is the true test of how advanced/well developed an app is.
