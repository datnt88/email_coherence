<s> I hope it has not gone unnoticed that I've chosen a rather small/personal means of protesting a trend I abhor in W3C.  </s>
<s> It is summed up by Lawrence Lessig in recent alarms, including a book.  </s>
<s> The fundamental message is at consortium" is a (quixotic?) tilting at what so many of my "surrogate grandchildren" have helped build: a hopeful road to inclusion - everyone, everything connected.  </s>
<s> The groups to which I still subscribe (but only minimally participate in) are central to preventing a disturbing slide by W3c towards the abyss that has swallowed many past promises.  </s>
<s> I urge each of us to do whatever is possible to stop this trend with a new dedication to inclusion.  </s>
<s> We cannot hope to "change the world" if "the world" is allowed to step into/upon our doings.  </s>
<s> We have to eat our own dog food.  </s>
<s> Love.  </s>

<s> William, I'm confused.  </s>
<s> What does Lawrence Leissig, the Future of Ideas, and the W3C have to do with each other?  </s>
<s> Seems that the article/web site you refer to is about protecting "free space" - meaning free speech and exchange of ideas.  </s>
<s> Are you saying that people shouldn't get to put stuff on the  </s>
<s> internet if they don't have the freedom to protect it?  </s>
<s> Shouldn't people  </s>
<s> have the option/choice to put stuff on the internet and have it protected or have it freely available?  </s>
<s> The internet of the past is still there, no one is taking it away, we are only adding a new choice.  </s>
<s> Everyone still has a choice.  </s>
<s> (well unless you're a US Federal agency, which has to [by law] make it's content accessible so that people will disabilities have a choice to access it's content - but I digress) So what's the "trend" you abhor in the W3C?  </s>
<s> Are you saying that things like the W3C consortium are taking away free space?  </s>
<s> Examples would be helpful here.  </s>
<s> W3C seems to be the only place with any power or influence that is protecting free space - meaning interoperability, standards, and open technology.  </s>
<s> Which promises are you saying W3C has swallowed?  </s>
<s> You're making a lot of alarming statements, but I honestly don't know what you are talking about - which is alarming.  </s>
<s> P.S. Why do you use such alarming subject titles?  </s>
<s> Look out for what?  </s>
<s> And why did you cross post to both PF &amp; EO?  </s>
<s> These groups are as about as opposite as it gets, one abut technical protocols and the later about education and informing others.  </s>
<s> Regards, Phill  </s>
<s> I hope that's not what I'm saying.  </s>
<s> What I am saying is that the recent effort to make the process of setting standards be beholden to patent/copyright considerations is a huge step backward.  </s>
<s> I am saying that many participating members continue to ignore the standards, in particular those dealing with accessibility.  </s>
<s> I am saying that the effort to "own" the internet/Web/network should be strongly fought by W3C rather than the consortium being a creature of the members.  </s>
<s> The feeling that they are "allowed" in the consortium, rather than that it's "theirs" is what I'm addressing.  </s>
<s> PJ:: "...PF &amp; EO?  </s>
<s> These groups are as about as opposite as it gets..." The PF/EO thing might seem at first blush to be "disparity in action" but the maintenance of rigorous standards and the dissemination of the idea behind all this are inseparable.  </s>
<s> In PF we have created a basis for almost all the W3C's "standards" with our XAG.  </s>
<s> The conformance thereto is spotty at best and should be mandatory for membership.  </s>
<s> The EO effort is how all this gets fed to the ultimate participants: everybody.  </s>
<s> They've even passed laws based on this work but we're still faced with members who live outside the law.  </s>
<s> Pandering to "old tired ethics" of "idea ownership" in an era when that concept is bankrupt is dangerous to our mission.  </s>
<s> The "alarmist" nature of the subject line is based (I think soundly) on vast past experience wherein a great idea becomes corrupted by an absence of vigilance on the part of those closest to the idea.  </s>
<s> Not to point fingers, but the creators of both XMetaL (SoftQuad) and XMLSpy (Altova) have made zero effort to participate in the extremely important matter of making their tools both accessible to PWD and to produce XAG-compliant materials.  </s>
<s> We have done little/nothing to make such ignorance of our principles unacceptable.  </s>
<s> A year from now when there is a huge struggle to retrofit those efforts we can look back at this time when something was possible and again rue the loss of Yuri Rubinsky.  </s>
<s> Love.  </s>
<s> It's Bad Luck to be Superstitious!  </s>
<s> W3 has a corporate ethos, and unfortunately the european-open source-"socialist" version isn't yet nascent.  </s>
<s> The commons originally would in all probability have had a wider gamut.  </s>
<s> Once named it became circumscribed, and that is the object of w3.  </s>
<s> The 'true' commons will arise out of the actions of the people, not the representatives of corporations.  </s>
