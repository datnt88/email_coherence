<s> -- Name -- Generically discover and publish a server's functionality -- Description -- Abelard, an independent publisher of web publications, often needs to query an arbitrary list of RDF storage servers for assertions about a set of URIs he cares about.  </s>
<s> The RDF storage servers are RSS feed aggregators.  </s>
<s> The set of URIs identify Abelard's web publications.  </s>
<s> Abelard wants to use RDF to keep track of the things people say in weblogs about his publications.  </s>
<s> Abelard's client software includes support for three different query languages.  </s>
<s> Abelard's client software connects to each RDF storage server and determines whether it supports one of the three query languages it knows about.  </s>
<s> Abelard's client software chooses, based on priorities set by Abelard, to send different queries to different servers.  </s>
<s> Heloise, an aggregator of RSS feeds, publishes RDF (extracted from RSS feeds) on the Web using an RDF storage server.  </s>
<s> Heloise's server supports several RDF query languages.  </s>
<s> Heloise's server publishes its supported query language available in a machine readable form.  </s>
<s> It negotiates with clients in order to choose the most appropriate query language that they have in common.  </s>
<s> -- Value -- Abelard can use software to automate the process of tracking the things people say on the Web about his publications.  </s>
<s> Abelard can formulate queries in a variety of query languages, which preserves his existing investment.  </s>
<s> Abelard's software vendor and Heloise's software vendor can develop and sell extensible, relatively generic systems.  </s>
<s> Abelard and Heloise are able to exchange third party data in an interoperable fashion without requiring out-of-band, human negotiation about capabilities.  </s>
<s> -- Other -- Rather than writing several parallel use cases just like this one, I invite the reader to substite the following for "query languages" in this use case: * RDF serialization types * context support * publicly available models with read access * publicly available models with write access  </s>
<s> This is a nice specialization of the more generically stated use cases PS-1: Discovery of authoritative knowledge via URI PS-3: Third-Party Knowledge Discovery; query by known identity which apply to any resource whatsoever denoted by a URI, such as a web service.  </s>
<s> Thus, if the client software knows the URI of the web service in question, it can then (hopefully) use the DAWG solution to obtain a description of that web service, and decide how best (or if) to interact with that service.  </s>
<s> "Negotiation" is taken to equate to the client learning what protocols, query languages, parameters, etc. the server supports and deciding for itself how best (or if) to proceed.  </s>
<s> Yes? Patrick  </s>

<s> I think so, yes; though I reserve the right to change my mind after actually thinking about it.  </s>
<s> :  </s>
<s> Yes.  </s>
<s> Exactly; and, though I guess this is already clear, I want clients to be able to "learn" these things via RDF.  </s>
<s> (This is why I'm trying to analogize to con-neg, though this is really more like capability negotiation.)  </s>
<s> The only diff in my use case and yr 1 &amp; 3 is that I think DAWG will have to -- and this takes us beyond *use cases* strictly speaking -- work out some actual RDF vocabulary and conventions.  </s>
<s> (I should look at the capabilities stuff the W3 has already done, of course; but first I wanna finish writing more UCs.) Kendall  </s>
