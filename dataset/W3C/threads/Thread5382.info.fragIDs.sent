Hello IG members, In addition to this mailing list, an Internet Relay Chat channel is opened for SWS discussions on the FreeNode network. 
A bot will help to record URIs/comments and put them on the Web [1] I encourage you to give references you would like to share. 
The channel is #sws-ig. 
It could be used in the future for IRC conferences. 
For people who are not familiar with IRC, some information can be found at [2] [1] http://www.w3.org/2002/ws/swsig/scratchpad/ [2] http://freenode.net/using_the_network.shtml Carine Bournez -+- W3C Sophia-Antipolis 
is there a web browser applet version of an IRC client? 
There is no web page with that kind of applet for FreeNode in general, but everyone can make his own: Carine Bournez -+- W3C Sophia-Antipolis
