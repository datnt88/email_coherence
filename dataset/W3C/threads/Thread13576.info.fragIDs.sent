<s> Hello, As suggested last week, let's chat tomorrow (Thursday, 19 December) at 6:00 PM UTC (Thu 10:00 AM Seattle, Thu 1:00 PM Boston, Thu 6:00 PM London, Fri 5:00 AM Melbourne).  </s>

<s> Nothing added to the schema.  </s>
<s> 5. TestCriteria, suite, level, excludes.  </s>
<s> OPEN ISSUE.  </s>
<s> This had some support but some felt it was going too far in the direction of a test point description language.  </s>
<s> 6. os, version.  </s>
<s> OPEN ISSUE.  </s>
<s> We agreed there is no unique way to identify a UA (i.e., URIs for each UA don't exist).  </s>
<s> Although, the reprOf proposal from last week's discussion might  </s>

<s> As it happens, John Cowan and I were reminiscing about this as our cocktail  </s>
<s> party conversation at XML2002. 1.  </s>
<s> Standard practice that EARL should adhere to: - Base semantics on the ISO standard.  </s>
<s> - Define 'date' as a subset of dateTime, which you define first.  </s>
<s> 2. Precedents you should check before deciding on subsets and encoding: XML Schema (types) IETF Calendaring and Scheduling - RFC3339 3. Personal recommendation: In your 'date' subset do not allow, or at least discourage, the omission of a localOffset indication.  </s>
<s> Actually, for logging purposes of observations related to the Internet, a full dateTime should be preferred anyway.  </s>
<s> 4. Warning: omitting localOffset is legitimate in planDateTime if a location  </s>
<s> is given in geographic terms.  </s>
<s> This is the "when it's noon in Boston" usage as opposed to "17:00 UTC" or "12:00 -05" usage.  </s>
<s> But I don't think that this  </s>
<s> needs to be anything more than a remark in defining how to express past events  </s>
<s> in EARL.  </s>
<s> Al  </s>
<s> Al Gilman scripsit:  </s>
<s> The point I was trying to make to Al (maybe a little confused by the circumstances) was that date+offset is adequate for *past* times, but inadequate for future ones.  </s>
<s> If I make an appointment to meet you in Times Square at midnight 2005-01-01, that is not equivalent to saying I'll meet  </s>
<s> you at 2005-01-01 05:00 UTC.  </s>
<s> The U.S. might change the time zone rules  </s>
<s> between now and then -- unlikely but not impossible, given that it did just that in 1974-75, extending daylight savings time for most of the year.  </s>
<s> There is no resolution in principle for this, but using the historically  </s>
<s> based time zone names of the ADO (GNU) time zone library, like America/New_York, provides the best hope.  </s>
<s> It is especially significant  </s>
<s> that ADO divides time zones by country, since it is the country that is responsible for assigning local times.  </s>
<s> Thus, Europe/Paris currently  </s>
<s> behaves just the same as Europe/Copenhagen, but it has not always been  </s>
<s> so and may not be so in future.  </s>
<s> See ftp://elsie.nci.nih.gov/pub for downloadable ADO time zone information.  </s>

<s> Sorry, what do you mean by a 'resolution'?  </s>
<s> at this point?  </s>
<s> Maybe there is a resolution or there is no resolution.  </s>
<s> If it's a way out of a predicament,  </s>
<s> there is a resolution.  </s>
<s> If it's an unambiguous mapping to UTC time, there is  </s>
<s> no resolution, but no need of a resolution.  </s>
<s> Thus the fact that the resolution is a reference to possibly future utterances of the civil authority is true, but not a problem.  </s>
<s> No. This is what we went around on before.  </s>
<s> There _is_ at least a resolution in practice and, depending on the sense of the term 'resolution,' in principle.  </s>
<s> It has to do with understanding the point or use of the time reference in a plan.  </s>
<s> The purpose is to provide or participate in a set of constraints sufficient to assure the achievement of a rendezvous.  </s>
<s> John, this is what you and I discussed before.  </s>
<s> The resolution is that the place and local time is sufficent as a policy for  </s>
<s> how to rendezvous, and it is a rendezvous policy that is what goes in a plan, *not* necessarily an _unambiguous_ *time* reference.  </s>
<s> The offset  </s>
<s> policy of the civil authority will be definitized in time to accomplish the  </s>
<s> rendezvous transaction of both being at the agreed meeting point at the same  </s>
<s> time.  </s>
<s> The time reference will be unambiguous by the time that the rendezvous is consummated.  </s>
<s> UTC Date plus offset is also logically sufficient for a rendezous agreement, but not customary, so the terms of an agreement on these terms will have to be emphasized for people to follow them.  </s>
<s> Al  </s>
<s> Thank you for this helpful reference.  </s>
<s> Al  </s>
<s> Al Gilman scripsit:  </s>
<s> True. But as a surrogate for the place, the ADO time zone may well serve,  </s>
<s> because it is a spatial unit that has had the same time offset history  </s>
<s> since the epoch (1970-01-01); furthermore, it in no case crosses national boundaries.  </s>
<s> Indeed. "In my last lifetime, John Cowan I believed in reincarnation; http://www.ccil.org/~cowan in this lifetime, jcowan@reutershealth.com I don't." --Thiagi http://www.reutershealth.com  </s>
<s> Yes. The collection of ADO time zones fills a hole in my description of "what works" by way of where+whenInLocalTime.  </s>
<s> This is a rule that tells you what sort of a 'where' reference will work.  </s>
<s> In the form where+whenInLocalTime, the 'where' part should be something that has a unique associated ADO time zone.  </s>
<s> 'Boston' works, 'Tennessee' doesn't.  </s>
<s> Al  </s>
<s> I think that going with the ISO standard as a first pass is going to be problemmatic - since it includes so many kinds of time expression you are likely to get low interoperability.  </s>
<s> W3C published a note about a particular subset of the ISO standard that may be a useful starting point.  </s>
<s> Looking at what the informal RDF calendar group [1] does might also be a good idea for working out easy interoperability in RDF formats... [1] http://www.w3.org/2002/12/cal/ cheers Chaals  </s>
