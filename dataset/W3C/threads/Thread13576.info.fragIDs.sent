Hello, As suggested last week, let's chat tomorrow (Thursday, 19 December) at 6:00 PM UTC (Thu 10:00 AM Seattle, Thu 1:00 PM Boston, Thu 6:00 PM London, Fri 5:00 AM Melbourne). 
This will be an irc-only chat. 
irc server: irc.w3.org port: 6665 channel: #er Per the summary from last week's chat [1], the issues to discuss tomorrow are those that we did not discuss last week: 3. operator, operatorInstructions, purpose. 
Did not have support. 
Nothing added to the schema. 
5. TestCriteria, suite, level, excludes. 
OPEN ISSUE. 
This had some support but some felt it was going too far in the direction of a test point description language. 
6. os, version. 
OPEN ISSUE. 
We agreed there is no unique way to identify a UA (i.e., URIs for each UA don't exist). 
Although, the reprOf proposal from last week's discussion might 
handle this issue. 
8. date. 
TO DO. 
I have an action item from last week to do some research. 
Best, --wendy [1] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-er-ig/2002Dec/0015.html

As it happens, John Cowan and I were reminiscing about this as our cocktail 
party conversation at XML2002. 1. 
Standard practice that EARL should adhere to: - Base semantics on the ISO standard. 
- Define 'date' as a subset of dateTime, which you define first. 
2. Precedents you should check before deciding on subsets and encoding: XML Schema (types) IETF Calendaring and Scheduling - RFC3339 3. Personal recommendation: In your 'date' subset do not allow, or at least discourage, the omission of a localOffset indication. 
Actually, for logging purposes of observations related to the Internet, a full dateTime should be preferred anyway. 
4. Warning: omitting localOffset is legitimate in planDateTime if a location 
is given in geographic terms. 
This is the "when it's noon in Boston" usage as opposed to "17:00 UTC" or "12:00 -05" usage. 
But I don't think that this 
needs to be anything more than a remark in defining how to express past events 
in EARL.

Al Gilman scripsit: 
The point I was trying to make to Al (maybe a little confused by the circumstances) was that date+offset is adequate for *past* times, but inadequate for future ones. 
If I make an appointment to meet you in Times Square at midnight 2005-01-01, that is not equivalent to saying I'll meet 
you at 2005-01-01 05:00 UTC. 
The U.S. might change the time zone rules 
between now and then -- unlikely but not impossible, given that it did just that in 1974-75, extending daylight savings time for most of the year. 
There is no resolution in principle for this, but using the historically 
based time zone names of the ADO (GNU) time zone library, like America/New_York, provides the best hope. 
It is especially significant 
that ADO divides time zones by country, since it is the country that is responsible for assigning local times. 
Thus, Europe/Paris currently 
behaves just the same as Europe/Copenhagen, but it has not always been 
so and may not be so in future.

Sorry, what do you mean by a 'resolution'? 
at this point? 
Maybe there is a resolution or there is no resolution. 
If it's a way out of a predicament, 
there is a resolution. 
If it's an unambiguous mapping to UTC time, there is 
no resolution, but no need of a resolution. 
Thus the fact that the resolution is a reference to possibly future utterances of the civil authority is true, but not a problem. 
No. This is what we went around on before. 
There _is_ at least a resolution in practice and, depending on the sense of the term 'resolution,' in principle. 
It has to do with understanding the point or use of the time reference in a plan. 
The purpose is to provide or participate in a set of constraints sufficient to assure the achievement of a rendezvous. 
John, this is what you and I discussed before. 
The resolution is that the place and local time is sufficent as a policy for 
how to rendezvous, and it is a rendezvous policy that is what goes in a plan, *not* necessarily an _unambiguous_ *time* reference. 
The offset 
policy of the civil authority will be definitized in time to accomplish the 
rendezvous transaction of both being at the agreed meeting point at the same 
time. 
The time reference will be unambiguous by the time that the rendezvous is consummated. 
UTC Date plus offset is also logically sufficient for a rendezous agreement, but not customary, so the terms of an agreement on these terms will have to be emphasized for people to follow them. 
Al 
Thank you for this helpful reference.

Al Gilman scripsit: 
True. But as a surrogate for the place, the ADO time zone may well serve, 
because it is a spatial unit that has had the same time offset history 
since the epoch (1970-01-01); furthermore, it in no case crosses national boundaries. 
Indeed. "In my last lifetime, John Cowan I believed in reincarnation; http://www.ccil.org/~cowan in this lifetime, jcowan@reutershealth.com I don't." --Thiagi http://www.reutershealth.com 
Yes. The collection of ADO time zones fills a hole in my description of "what works" by way of where+whenInLocalTime. 
This is a rule that tells you what sort of a 'where' reference will work. 
In the form where+whenInLocalTime, the 'where' part should be something that has a unique associated ADO time zone. 
'Boston' works, 'Tennessee' doesn't. 
Al 
I think that going with the ISO standard as a first pass is going to be problemmatic - since it includes so many kinds of time expression you are likely to get low interoperability. 
W3C published a note about a particular subset of the ISO standard that may be a useful starting point. 
Looking at what the informal RDF calendar group [1] does might also be a good idea for working out easy interoperability in RDF formats... [1] http://www.w3.org/2002/12/cal/ cheers Chaals
