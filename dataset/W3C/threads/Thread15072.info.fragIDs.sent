<s> Kynn is absolutely correct.  </s>
<s> I should have added a summary to this.  </s>
<s> Unfortunately, I did not and was not able to get back to it yesterday.  </s>
<s> I'm including the links again, but this time I'm adding a summary of the information.  </s>
<s> Most of the research that I was able to find led to four findings.  </s>
<s> 1) Pages should be short (however, most of those pages were at least 3 - 4 pages printed) 2) The information should be in short, digestible chunks - short paragraphs, short sentences.  </s>
<s> 3) The information should be presented in an easily scannable manner and the headings should show levels of content heirarchy.  </s>
<s> 4) One thought per paragraph and sentence; no complex sentence structure.  </s>
<s> One other thing was unique enough to point out.  </s>
<s> The article at cognitively challenged.  </s>
<s> It explains what groups fall into this category.  </s>
<s> I can imagine a web site would be fraught with difficulty if all the pages were set up in the manner the top of the page was set up.  </s>
<s> After reviewing Lisa's list again, it fills all the requirements mentioned in all the research I was able to locate.  </s>
<s> I could not find any research that specifically disclosed how individuals with cognitive difficulties used the Internet.  </s>
<s> Some unique information did arise that explained that there are individuals with cognitive difficulties working in the scientific and mathematical fields.  </s>
<s> Those individuals would be trained to use information written to the content of scientific and mathematical fields.  </s>
<s> Therefore, one can not assume that the lowest common denominator be singled out when writing content.  </s>
<s> It does follow that the information must be presented using the information that I provided about how to write and follow Lisa's suggestions of presentation.  </s>
<s> Lowering the content to the lowest common denominator on all the pages ONLY, removes the credibility of the piece.  </s>
<s> My suggestion is to add an alternate set of pages that the cognitively challenged individuals can use.  </s>
<s> If this is done by a highly visited site and the server records could be examined it may show how many people with cognitive difficulties access those pages.  </s>
<s> However, it may even show how many people are curious enough to visit the information in that section.  </s>
<s> We can conservatively show that those page views beyond the first page in the series were used by those with cognitive difficulties.  </s>
<s> It would be a good research project for a college or research center focusing upon cognitive studies.  </s>
<s> Perhaps I gave Trace or MIT something they could work on.  </s>

<s> Yes -- this is part of the reason that alternate versions make a lot of sense when you're talking about the variety of cognitive disabilities.  </s>
<s> What works for one person may be hell for another, and the only way around that is to have parallel presentations available.  </s>
<s> This is why we need to dispel the notion that alternate versions are "text-only pages for blind users" -- in truth, the blind users are well-served by a generally accessible page with straight-forward layout.  </s>
<s> The real benefits of parallel versions can be seen when we talk about _other_ (non-blind) groups of disabled users.  </s>
