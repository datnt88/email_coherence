<s> Agenda for Monday:  </s>
<s> - Implementation plan for WART.  </s>
<s> Do we want to change the name?  </s>
<s> No, I don't want to change the name.  </s>
<s> I do think that it would be worth investigating further what is required to post the EARL as an annotation, and after that what is required to adjust an annotation where the same person is doing so.  </s>
<s> (This would be useful because we can also give it to people making authoring tools as a readymade piece)  </s>
<s> - Linear version of EARL I don't thnk we should spend time doing this.  </s>
<s> It is easy enough to come up  </s>
<s> with a syntax if someone wants one, and we should get them to provide transformations to EARL as part of the work.  </s>
<s> If they don't understand how to create the syntax themselves then they are about in the same boat whatever syntax they generate - they need an explanation of what sequence of magic characters needs to be produced.  </s>
<s> (Imagine you are explaining it to a japanese developer - the difference between strings of latin letters is not meaningful anyway).  </s>
<s> Chaals  </s>
<s> Agreed; forget I sent it.  </s>

<s> Could we add an update on the status of EARL w.r.t.  </s>
<s> Annotea?  </s>
<s> (Or, sort it out on the list).  </s>
<s> Things I'm wondering:- * The distinction between EARL "reporting" and Annotea "annotating" doesn't seem clear.  </s>
<s> EARL already has a mechanism for saying "this is the thing that we're talking about", so I don't get why it would be in an annotation.  </s>
<s> What would the annotation be about?  </s>
<s> Do we need a subset of EARL to put in the annotation?  </s>
<s> * How easy is it to modify the existing annotea tools to simply generate EARL, as it is, straight up?  </s>
<s> * Annotations have methods for saying "the content type of this body is x".  </s>
<s> This is something that we still need to sort out amongst ourselves: how to identify a piece of content as being EARL, and whether or not we even need to.  </s>
<s> * Annotea treats :Body content as parseType="literal", which is incorrect in our case, because we're putting RDF in there.  </s>
<s> Having said that, I'm not sure how it would fit into the annotation model if it was left as RDF.  </s>
<s> * Can't annotations be stored as XLinks?  </s>

<s> I would like to talk about EARL and annotea too.  </s>

<s> EARL already has a mechanism for saying "this is the thing that we're talking about", so I don't get why it would be in an annotation.  </s>
<s> What would the annotation be about?  </s>
<s> Do we need a subset of EARL to put in the annotation?  </s>
<s> CMN No, it wouldn't need to be a subset, it should be EARL.  </s>
<s> The value of Annotea is a mechanism for finding EARL reports - just one of several possibilities, but I think an intersting one nonetheless, in part becuase it is built on similar technology.  </s>
<s> SBP * How easy is it to modify the existing annotea tools to simply generate EARL, as it is, straight up?  </s>
<s> CMN Errr, quite hard really.  </s>
<s> It is probably easier to modify tools which would produce EARL to post the EARL as an annotation (as one option) SBP * Annotations have methods for saying "the content type of this body is x".  </s>
<s> This is something that we still need to sort out amongst ourselves: how to identify a piece of content as being EARL, and whether or not we even need to.  </s>
<s> CMN True.  </s>
<s> We should talk to folks who are identifying other RDF stuff, in general.  </s>
<s> I have also talked a little to the annotea folks about identifying EARL within an annotation, which is a seperate problem to do with the internal workings of their schema.  </s>
<s> SBP * Annotea treats :Body content as parseType="literal", which is incorrect in our case, because we're putting RDF in there.  </s>
<s> Having said that, I'm not sure how it would fit into the annotation model if it was left as RDF.  </s>
<s> CMN Me too, but that is a problem we should sort out with the annotea folks SBP * Can't annotations be stored as XLinks?  </s>
<s> CMN They are ore or less a subset of Xlinks, and I believe can be transferred to be Xlinks, if you have a mechanism for storing Xlinks.  </s>
<s> But I am not certain.  </s>
