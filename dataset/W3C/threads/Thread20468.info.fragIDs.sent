<s> My understanding is that the CDATA tag is to circumvent parser problems with unescaped characters, like , which are meant to operate in their mathematical capacities rather than in their text capacities.  </s>
<s> The problem that I am experiencing is that in AMAYA 5.3 CDATA is acting as a "bit bucket of oblivion" - the code that is enclosed is totally ignored.  </s>
<s> The code is a simple JavaScript code which checks the level of a user's browser.  </s>
<s> Below a certain level, a window appears informing the user of the availability of an updated browser version.  </s>
<s> In order not to make a nuisance of itself, the checking routine writes a simple cookie to a user's computer which it later checks so as not to run again when the page reloads.  </s>
<s> This cookie lasts only for the duration of the browsing session.  </s>
<s> The code uses a  symbol in its mathematical sense, so this routine needs to be 'masked' from an XML parser.  </s>
<s> The syntax that I am using is this: ![CDATA[ . the actual JavaScript code is inserted here ]] The code is not executing at all, and if I use comment markers, !-- ... -- , the result is identical.  </s>
<s> So, the questions are these: is my syntax incorrect?  </s>
<s> -or- is this an implementation 'bug' in AMAYA -or- is this a design 'bug' in the functioning of CDATA?  </s>

<s> Hello Mark In fact, there are two things.  </s>
<s> First, the public Amaya releases until now (including Amaya 5.3) didn't treat  </s>
<s> the CDATA tag and only its content was preserved and attached to the parent  </s>
<s> element.  </s>
<s> The current CVS version of Amaya preserves this tag and its content  </s>
<s> and creates a specific element in the document tree (for XML documents only).  </s>
<s> The second thing is that script languages are not (yet) supported in Amaya, so  </s>
<s> they are not executed.  </s>
<s> Regards Laurent Carcone Amaya team  </s>
<s> Laurent; Thanks for your note.  </s>
<s> I am fairly new to Amaya and so was not aware that, as you and John Russell pointed out, Amaya did not yet support any scripting languages.  </s>
<s> I had dark inklings of suspicion, but that was all.  </s>
<s> The  </s>
<s> naturally arising questions are: Do you or anyone here know when or if scripting languages will be supported, and if so, which language?  </s>
<s> Again,  </s>

<s> Amaya, so  </s>
<s> Somewhere in the lower half of my to-do list is embedding Python in Amaya.  </s>
<s> A more interesting question is, would you really want scripts running loose  </s>
<s> inside a document you are trying to edit?  </s>
<s> Cheers,  </s>
<s> Horatio  </s>
<s> Horatio;  </s>
<s> A file, once it has been hauled into an editor, only represents a suspended 'snapshot' of the currently active file.  </s>
<s> Until the file is saved  </s>
<s> neither it nor the script it contains are active.  </s>
<s> Saving the altered file as  </s>
<s> a beta file buffers the web-surfing public.  </s>
<s> So, I guess I am missing your point about "... scripts running loose inside a document ...", please enlighten me.  </s>
<s> Why Python?  </s>
<s> I am curious because I have only encountered comparisons between Python and Java or C. I was referring to something much more compact  </s>
<s> that only runs within a web browser environment like JavaScript, which is currently, I believe, the most accurate representation of the ECMA-262 standard.  </s>

<s> loose  </s>
<s> Looking at the original post, I had thought you originally asked why scripts  </s>
<s> were not executing in Amaya - which Laurent answered by saying that wasn't implemented yet.  </s>
<s> Scripts are useful because they make documents interactive  </s>
<s> - in other words, the state of the document changes over time.  </s>
<s> Editing a moving target is an awkward challenge, but some documents depend on their script components in order to present properly, so editing them without scripts active is awkward also.  </s>
<s> Did you only want Amaya to execute scripts when not in editing mode?  </s>
<s> Python is designed to be embedded in things, and I like the stuff.  </s>
<s> -- Horatio  </s>
<s> Horatio; Obviously there has been a HUGH amount of mis-communication and behind it all is that we come at the same thing differently - you from a GUI environment and me from a console environment.  </s>
<s> What you are explaining I already know, but the structure of Amaya to function primarily as a GUI interface is not going to be useful to me at all - to many others, 'yes' it will be useful.  </s>
<s> Best of luck in your development.  </s>
