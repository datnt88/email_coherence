Some HTTP proxies will provide aditional request headers to indicate the originating IP address (e.g., squid's forwarded_for directive) but such information is rare, optional, and cannot be trusted (unless you control the proxy server that is adding the request header). 
Even when the information can be trusted, it often refers to unroutable address space.

Its not possible in since the IP masquerading is done by the proxy server. the IP of the client is known only by the proxy server
