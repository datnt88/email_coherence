It seems that italian law will found itself on WCAG 1.0 (or a part of them, maybe the testable ones) - Who is going to control, and using which tools? - Which web sites will be under law's control; they should be all public administration and governative ones, with all those organizations that are using public funds. 
Anyway, I'll keep the group informed about the meeting and the laws' future steps. 
My best regards, Roberto Castaldo www.Webaccessibile.Org
