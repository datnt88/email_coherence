<s> Given the success of the table describing mU and role I was wondering  </s>
<s> whether we can clarify issue 250 by adding another one listing the roles  </s>
<s> in a similar manner (see attached) in section 2.2 where we have the list  </s>
<s> of role definitions [1].  </s>
<s> This may make it easier to see than the current  </s>
<s> bullet list.  </s>
<s> Btw, in table 2 "SOAP Nodes Forwarding behaviour", we should refer to  </s>
<s> the names "next", "ultimateReceiver", and "none" as *short-names* as we in section 2.2 defined the role *name* as a URI.  </s>
<s> Comments? Henrik Frystyk Nielsen [1] http://www.w3.org/2000/xp/Group/2/06/LC/soap12-part1.xml#soaproles  </s>
<s> Sounds good.  </s>
<s> Done.  </s>
<s> Sounds good as well.  </s>
<s> Done.  </s>
<s> Wow! Henrik  </s>
<s> the current bullet list.  </s>
<s> Overall I like it.  </s>
<s> One editorial comment, though I think this is on text that traces to earlier versions.  </s>
<s> Your table has: "To establish itself as an ultimate SOAP receiver a SOAP node MUST act in this role.  </s>
<s> " I've never liked that, as I think you establish yourself as an ultimate receiver by agreeing to undertake all the requirements of the specification for an ultimate reciever, including not relaying the message.  </s>
<s> Since we've quite clearly established elsewhere what an ultimate receiver is, I propose:  </s>
<s> "The ultimate receiver MUST act in this role.  </s>
<s> "  </s>
<s> Sound right?  </s>

<s> I'm ok with that.  </s>
<s> We should also delete the sentence in the "next" role "and MAY additionally assume zero or more other SOAP roles."  </s>
<s> As this applies to all of them and people may think it does not when it only is called out for "next".  </s>
