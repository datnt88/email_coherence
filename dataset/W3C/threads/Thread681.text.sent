When using Tidy to convert from html to xhtml I find that it replaces &amp; within url's with &amp;amp; This looks somewhat unexpected to me. 
Is it a bug or is there a reason for it? 
e.g.: a href="search.pl?key1=value1&amp;key2=value2" becomes Regards Kris Van Bruwaene Tidy is correcting your html. 
This is nothing to do with conversion. 
I'm w/ Kris on this one. 
Tidy probably shouldn't replace &amp; with &amp;amp; within the text of an href or src attribute. 
I did a test, however, and it appears that the link is not broken by the replacement. 
The browser may substitute the entity w/ the actual character before submitting the URL. 
I just did this quickly, without a functional URL. 
But the URL displayed on the status line of the browser (IE5) appears correct: file:///C:/temp/search.pl?key1=value1&amp;key2=value2 
You can turn off &amp; replacement with the option: tidy --quote-ampersand=no ... take it easy, Charlie Tidy is correcting your html.

... fed with following two lines in the BODY: gives following error: Line 10, character 32: ... href="search.pl?key1=value1&amp;key2=value2" original version / ... Error: unknown entity key2 in other words: the validator complains about the input line, but does not complain about tidy's output. 
Do you need more proof than that? 
I'll give you an example that makes it a bit more evident. 
Admittedly, in the given example both versions behave identically in most browsers. 
But chek the following with your favourite browser, it is syntactically identical to the given example: The expected URL is "search.pl?key=1&amp;amp=2&amp;nbsp=3", but your browser will most certainly render it as "search.pl?key=1&amp;=2 =3". 
That (and because it's said so in the HTML specifications) is why Tidy is correctly replacing "&amp;" with "&amp;amp;" in your HREF and SRC attributes. 
cheers, sebastian Sebastian Lange Maybe the first chat site that validates as HTML 4.0 even though user input may contain HTML codes. 
Courtesy to Dave Raggett's HTML Tidy: Tidy your documents ONLINE: I don't want to turn this into a bigger deal than it needs to be, but it turns out I spent some time investigating Tidy's replacement of "&amp;" with "&amp;amp;" a few months ago. 
Many of the points have been mentioned by others in this thread. 
- The HTML, XML, and XHTML specs all require "&amp;" to be written as "&amp;amp;". 
This is because "&amp;" can be ambiguous while "&amp;amp;" is not. 
- Most (all?) browsers do NOT require "&amp;" to be written as "&amp;amp;". 
This is because they employ heuristics to resolve an ambiguous "&amp;". 
These heuristics usually work but they introduce inconsistencies, which is probably why the specs didn't use them. 
Most (all?) browsers also accept the unambiguous "&amp;amp;". 
This is entirely about disambiguating the markup syntax. 
Users and web servers should not see "&amp;amp;" in URLs. 
- Tidy's job is to clean up HTML to conform with the specs while preserving what users experience in their browsers. 
So Tidy replaces the illegal "&amp;" with the legal "&amp;amp;", employing the same heuristics as browsers to resolve any ambiguities. 
Again, users and web servers should not see a difference. 
Only people who look at the markup can tell. 
- Still, some people who look at the markup, for their own reasons good or bad, want to see "&amp;" even if it is illegal and possibly ambiguous. 
For those people, Tidy has a quote-ampersand=no option that disables the "&amp;" replacement. 
- The current 4 August 2000 Tidy has a bug that occasionally causes it to botch the "&amp;" replacement. 
I submitted a patch a few months ago: Randy There's agreement about naked &amp; being invalid in the specs. 
As a note, it's worth checking to see how you *really* have Tidy configured to catch unexpected behaviour from it. 
The AdjustConfig function will overwrite the setting of some variable to ensure that Tidy's config is "sensible". 
The original email mentioned that xHTML is being output. 
Here's a snippet from AdjustConfig /* XML requires end tags */ if (XmlOut) QuoteAmpersand = yes; HideEndTags = no; It's worthwhile checking your configuration after AdjustConfig has been executed to see how it's really configured to run. 
Adrian You learn something new every day. 
Thanks for the postings.
