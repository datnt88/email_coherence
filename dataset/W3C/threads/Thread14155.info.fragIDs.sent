<s> I don't think this is a good approach.  </s>
<s> The most that this can do is pont up a design that fails one of the most basic rendering tests.  </s>
<s> My experience with multi-browser testing is that it generally gives false-positives for accessibility, so I am much less enamoured of it than I was.  </s>
<s> It seems to me that as a technique it actually requires a fair degree of skill to interpret the results.  </s>
<s> So If we were to specify a minimum set of tests I think we should also point out what these tests do and do not show.  </s>

<s> My problem with BrowserMaster is its consetration on a rather limited set of viewing situations.  </s>
<s> Namly only on computer screens, as well assuming that users are using their full screen space (up to Windows95's task bar).  </s>
<s> The vast majority of designers do take into account these considerations.  </s>
<s> Another program which is in my view is worthwhile mentioning in the Techniques doc is WebTV's simulator.  </s>
<s> Not only that the screen is of low resolution, it also has large fonts, limited scrolling, no way to choose font-family, among other features.  </s>
<s> Although it is limited to simulating a particular browsers, it gives a user familiar only with graphical computer screens more understaning of alternative viewing situations.  </s>
<s> You can get it at http://developer.webtv.net/  </s>
<s> Another simulator is W3C's Amaya that has a text mode view (that does not attempt to simulate a particular existing browser).  </s>
