I'm looking for a complete copy of X3.4-1968, aka US-ASCII as cited by various protocols. 
I have other versions but only a partial copy of -1968, and ANSI no longer sells this version. 
If somebody has a scan or PDF of this version, I would like to view it. 
Thanks Eric A. Hall http://www.ehsco.com/
