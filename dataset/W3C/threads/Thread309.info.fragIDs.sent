Dear Dave Raggett, 
I'm disturbed at the way Tidy wraps lines by inserting a space between an attribute's equal sign and its value. 
For example, one might see Tidy wrap as follows: a href= "http://www.mrdata.net/" 
Is this a problem? 
Everywhere I look, I see the HTML specification for an attribute in the following form: attribute="value" 
I haven't yet found any support for the following form: attribute= "value" But, that is the form that you are actually using. 
Does this form actually meet the relevant specifications? 
When going through some SGML documentation, I saw what looked like some tenuous support, by way of examples. 
But, I couldn't find any hard data about this topic. 
More importantly, does this issue cause any HTML based Web browsers some kind of problem? 
Personally, when I see whitespace within a tag, and this whitespace is not within quotation marks, I assume that a new attribute follows. 
If there are Web browsers which assume the same thing, wouldn't it be better to avoid breaking this assumption? 
Or, at least, to allow this feature to be optionally turned off? 
Please, excuse me for bothering you with this. 
I've done a reasonable amount of research on this topic, and have come up empty-handed. 
There is no documentation on your Web site of your unusual technique. 
There is no way to turn it off. 
I did try "--wrap-attributes no", just in case, but this option doesn't apply to the current issue.

Well, I'm not Dave, but maybe I can answer your question. 
I've dealt with it myself. 
Whitespace is allowed on both sides of the equals sign in the attribute=value pair, including newlines. 
The specification allows this and the browsers I've used have had no problems with it. 
However, personally, I use a patched version of HTML Tidy that does not wrap after the equals sign, just because I don't like it. 
In pprint.c, 
PPrintAttrValue(), I commented out the three ifs after the first "AddC('=', linelen++);", including the third if's else (the "if (indent + linelen ..." ifs, the entire block). 
If you want to put a switch on the wrapping after equals, that's where you'd put it: around those ifs. 
I have an additional patch that only quotes attributes when necessary (yes, I know X*ML requires they all be quoted, which is why I programmed in an exception for that case), but it isn't tuned the way I want it. 
I prefer free-form CDATA attributes to always be quoted (such as SRC and HREF) and only leave unquoted those attributes that take key word values. 
HTML Tidy doesn't know the difference (generally doesn't care about attribute values) so that step is stalled until I motivate myself to teach Tidy these things (probably an expansion of the global list of attributes).

Yes, this is how it is defined in SGML:" see ISO 8879 production 32 [1] attribute specification = s*, (name,s*,vi, s*)?, attribute value specification where vi is "=". 
XML has rules with a similar effect (except that attribute names and the = cannot be omitted) for whitespace.
