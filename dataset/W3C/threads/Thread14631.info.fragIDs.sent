<s> Hello, I really appreciate the effort and will learn from the example, but at a glance the site is not AAA.  </s>

<s> 1.0 at http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10/full-checklist.html 10.4 Until user agents handle empty controls correctly, include default, place-holding characters in edit boxes and text areas.  </s>
<s> Clearly the search as well as the feedback pages are not doing this.  </s>

<s> To put some data in: I use Lynx, version 2.8 on Linux systems.  </s>
<s> Unfortunately it doesn't do anything useful about labeels for form controls, so it is still necessary to use positioning appropriately, but that is a seperate reqirement.  </s>
<s> I don't have any problems getting to and editing/activating/what-have-you a form control that is empty.  </s>
<s> Same goes for Amaya on Linux systems, at least since version 2.4 I also use iCab (Macintosh), and the same is true for it except that it doesn't have enough keyboard support yet.  </s>
<s> I also have Netscape 4.7, Lynx and IE 4.5 and 5.0 for the macintosh, and the same is true there too.  </s>
