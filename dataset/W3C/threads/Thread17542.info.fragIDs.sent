<s> Subject: What sorts of activities shall we do with respect to tools.  </s>
<s> We need to decide on the specific things we will do as a group.  </s>
<s> One general area is that of tools (like Bobby) that evaluate accessibilty.  </s>
<s> Which if any of the following shall we deal with?  </s>
<s> 1. accessibility tests that can be done in a purely automatic manner 2. tests that require human judgment 3. tools to help the humans do those judgments  </s>
<s> 4. an algorithm for an overall score  </s>
<s> 5. automated repair of access problems 6. semi-automated repair of access problems  </s>
<s> 7. Other, viz.  </s>
<s> (fill in the blank) And what sort of involvement should that be?  </s>
<s> For example,  </s>
<s> a. write a specification  </s>
<s> b. collect data needed for evaluation, e.g. capabilities of current browser/screenreaders c. develop tools d. provide master page that forwards to one or more tools e. serve as clearinghouse for tools (and what does clearinghouse mean) f. Other, viz.  </s>

<s> Reply to: RE:What shall we do about evaluation tools My vote would be a combination of 1 &amp; 4. I think that an automatic checker is more appealing to the "nonconverted", and quantitative feedback is much more tangible.  </s>

<s> I am in favor of numbers 3, 5, and 6. Tools to help do the assessments should be easily understood and usable by all.  </s>
<s> They should make it clear what the accessibility features are, and how they can be easily implemented.  </s>
<s> We need to keep things simple for people who are not sophisticated web page designers and builders.  </s>
<s> With the low barrier to entry many sites will be put up for small businesses.  </s>
<s> For both their benefit and the benefit of the users who need accessible web sites we must be sure that these sites can be accessible.  </s>
<s> If we raise the barrier of entry too high for the small web sites, then we destroy the web.  </s>
<s> Automated and Semi-automated correction tool can help correct errors and if properly designed they can help the uninitiated to make their sites accessible.  </s>
<s> These are my thoughts...I repeat again that we must keep things simple.  </s>

<s> I think 3 naturally comes with 2.  </s>
<s> 1 to 4 are in the bag I would call evaluation/rating services.  </s>
<s> (Bobby, weblint, robot, etc)  </s>
<s> These are in the "improving" bag.  </s>
<s> I think 6 is more in the realm of the AU group.  </s>
<s> We need to start with that and see what exists that fit this spec and what should be done.  </s>
