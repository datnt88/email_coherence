<s> EOWG, Please be prepared to discuss the issues below at the EOWG teleconference on Friday 30 April.  </s>
<s> Feel free to comment on the list ahead of time, especially if you are not able to attend the teleconference.  </s>
<s> Regards, ~ Shawn for the WAI Site Task Force (WSTF) Background reading: - WAI Site Analysis Summary: http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/2003/analysis-sum Particularly: - vision: http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/2003/analysis-sum#vision - Primary user groups are: 1.  </s>
<s> People who are new to Web accessibility, 2. Web developers  </s>
<s> 1. WAI site "purpose" WSTF recommends a short bit of text in a prominent top position of the WAI home page that: - answers the question, "What can I get from this site?" - is user-centric (that is, from the user's point of view, not WAI's point of view) - is focused for people who are new to the site, answering "What is this page/site I've landed on?" - has some pizzazz - generally aligns with the vision of the Web site - is very short, preferably around 30 words or less A "straw proposal": WAI provides guidelines and resources to make the Web accessible to people with disabilities.  </s>
<s> WAI is an international collaborative forum to help Web content providers, Web software developers, business and policy leaders, and others create an accessible Web.  </s>
<s> (Thanks to Carol, Charmane, Blossom, Judy, and Shawn for contributing ideas for the straw proposal.  </s>
<s> Other ideas are in the WSTF e-mail list archive: Question: Ideas for what the text would be.  </s>
<s> 2. Quote on WAI home page The current WAI home page (http://www.w3.org/WAI/) has in a prominent top position this quote: "The power of the Web is in its universality.  </s>
<s> Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect." -- Tim Berners-Lee, W3C Director and inventor of the World Wide Web "Screen real estate" is extremely valuable on the home page, especially above the fold.  </s>
<s> The quote doesn't say what WAI is about or what the site is about.  </s>
<s> It does lend credibility.  </s>
<s> Question: Should this quote be: a. on the WAI home page above the fold, b. on the WAI home page below the fold, c. not on home page (on another page, such as Introduction to Web Accessibility or About WAI).  </s>
<s> 3. Highlights on WAI home page WSTF is considering having highlights on the WAI home page.  </s>
<s> Purpose: - provide a way to showcase different resources, since many people don't know what we have - provide a space to address "hot" topics - make the home page more "alive" with timely topics that change frequently Examples of things that might go in highlights section: - blurb on hot (non-tech) topic, such as standards harmonization - blurb on just released documents - XYZ government adopted WCAG, with a link to Policies - technique addressing hot issue - tip from a document, such as Evaluating Web Sites for Accessibility, with link to document Notes: - usually 30-40 words each (maybe less) - would probably often have two highlights: 1. that stays longer and is a current high priority issue, such as standards harmonization, and 2, that changes more frequently, perhaps every week, such as a technique or tip - perhaps have one for "newbies" &amp; one for more advanced, and/or one for "techies" &amp; one for "fuzzies" [1] - would not replace news/announcements as is currently on home page Question: Do you think highlights is a good idea?  </s>
<s> What changes do you recommend for the parameters above (that is, what would go into the highlights section)?  </s>
<s> [1] description "techies" &amp; "fuzzies":  </s>
<s> I have always liked that quote.  </s>
<s> Now that Tim is back in the worldwide news with his recent honour of the Millennium Technology Prize it seems a good idea to keep the reminder of his feelings on the site - the home page seems right to me.  </s>
<s> I sometimes wish the year he made the quote was included in the citation -- I believe it was in 1997 for the WCAG 1.0 release.  </s>
<s> I suggest this because people keep reprinting the quote and on one occasion I have seen it dated as if Tim just said it this year.  </s>
<s> Also, for clarification, by "above the fold" do you mean "on the first screen-page" (i.e. before scrolling)?  </s>
<s> If so, I think it should remain "above the fold".  </s>
<s> Regards, Chuck Letourneau Starling Access Services  </s>
<s> The straw proposal above doesn't really roll off my tongue.  </s>
<s> It seems kind of stiff and formal (especially if we are looking for "pizzazz").  </s>
<s> Most of the other suggestions I found on the list (clipped below) use "accessible" or "accessibility" a lot.  </s>
<s> Only Shawn's two suggestions manage to use it only once (twice if you expand the A in WAI).  </s>
<s> I kind of like Carol's first sentence: "WAI is your resource for Web accessibility." (Charmane's plug for it being the "primary" resource is perhaps too bold...  </s>
<s> I agree it should be, but can we be 100% certain it is/will be?) Once the site is redesigned and effective it may be "Your BEST resource" grin .  </s>
<s> Sadly, I can't seem to craft a pizzazzy alternative myself so for the moment I guess I favour Shawn's second suggestion (the one with the linked bullets).  </s>
<s> She tell us what WAI is in the first sentence - without being too pedantic - and provides practical links to what the site contains in the remainder.  </s>
<s> Chuck Letourneau Starling Access Services From Carol J. Smith: WAI is your resource for Web accessibility.  </s>
<s> WAI includes: resources to help you create accessible websites; design software that supports production of accessible Web sites; and design accessible browsers in order to make the internet accessible for everyone.  </s>
<s> From Blossom Michaeloff: WAI pursues accessibility of the Web through its work in technology, guidelines, tools, education and outreach, and research and development.  </s>
<s> WAI is also your resource for Web accessibility.  </s>
<s> This site includes resources to help you learn more about accessibility and create accessible Web sites, browsers, and Web applications that make the Web accessible for everyone.  </s>
<s> From Shawn Lawton Henry: "WAI develops international guidelines and supporting resources to increase accessibility of the Web for people with disabilities." or "WAI works with organizations around the world to develop guidelines and supporting resources to help make the Web accessible for people with disabilities.  </s>
<s> This site has two main sections: - About WAI - Guidelines and Resources, which includes -- Getting Started -- Guidelines and Techniques -- General Resources, Promoting and Implementing, Evaluating, Developing Training" From Charmane Corcoran: WAI is a primary resource for Web accessibility.  </s>
<s> This site includes: information, tools, and resources to help you formulate best business web policies and training materials, create accessible web sites; design software that supports production of accessible Web sites; and design accessible browsers in order to make the Internet accessible for everyone.  </s>
<s> Shawn: 1. WAI site "purpose" A "straw proposal": WAI provides guidelines and resources to make the Web accessible to people with disabilities.  </s>
<s> WAI is an international collaborative forum to help Web content providers, Web software developers, business and policy leaders, and others create an accessible Web.  </s>
<s> Roberto: I'm not sure I agree with the suggestion of creating some kind of description text on the WAI page explaining what WAI does; if we really decide to do, it should, in my opinion, be very attractive, and give users some more reasons to go on and visiting WAI's web site; that's why I think that the "straw proposal" I've read tends to be too "distant" from the user and doesn't catch him at first sight.  </s>
<s> We should be able to build up an appealing sentence, basing itself on the concept that accessibility is a fundamental part of the web universality.  </s>
<s> Shawn: 2. Quote on WAI home page The current WAI home page (http://www.w3.org/WAI/) has in a prominent top position this quote: "The power of the Web is in its universality.  </s>
<s> Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect." -- Tim Berners-Lee, W3C Director and inventor of the World Wide Web Roberto: That quote is attractive, world famous and it's been translated in every language; Tim's quote has become the best WAI's testimonial in many accessibility web sites all over the world.  </s>
<s> That quote is, in my opinion, the best we could ever create and should positioned immediatly under "Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)" text, as it represent the best WAI's welcome to the user, and moreover offers universality and accessibility ideas in the right order.  </s>
<s> Shawn: 3. Highlights on WAI home page Roberto: Highlights may be a great tool to make people know the great quantity of resources WAI's web site offers and to keep users informed about new resources, new policies and so on.  </s>
