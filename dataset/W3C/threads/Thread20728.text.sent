Dear Sirs: I download Amaya 5.1 and try to use it. 
I go to yahoo and login my yahoo account. 
However, I could not. 
Yahoo reports that Amaya 5.1 does not accept cookie. 
Does Amaya 5.1 have cookie machanism feature? 
How do I turn it on? 
Thank you very much Danh Nguyen Do You Yahoo!? Get email alerts &amp; NEW webcam video instant messaging with Yahoo! 
Messenger I am using Amaya to create MathML snippets for my mostly non-mathematical web pages. 
I noticed that the Greek Alphabet menu in the Amaya MathML editor also contains some handy math symbols, one of which is the approximately-equal symbol, located in the fourth row of the grid, immediately to the left of capital Greek "alpha". 
(It looks like a tilde stacked on top of a standard equals sign.) One of my "equations" is only approximately correct, so I tried to use this symbol for the first time today. 
Upon clicking the symbol, Amaya incorrectly writes this into the file as the character entity &amp;Congruent;, rather than as &amp;cong; (equivalent to &amp;#8773; or U+2245, according to Chapter 24 of the HTML 4.0 spec). 
The next time Amaya opens, it displays the incorrect expression as an identity symbol (this looks like an equals sign with a 50% bonus). 
Although I can fix the symbol by hand (and it thankfully stays fixed, once I correct it), I am hoping that the fix would be a "quickie" replacement of the &amp;Congruent; string with a &amp;cong; string in a table somewhere. 
Unfortunately, IANAP (I am not a programmer), so I can't do it myself. 
I am running the Windows 95/98 precompiled binary, downloaded from the public Amaya site. 
Thank you for your consideration. 
--MB i just tried to duplicate your problem -- but on my machine it places an &amp;cong; and displays as approx equal (with tilda) using win98 and amaya 5.1 (july 11) binary !!! John Russell, VE3LL@RAC.CA Be sure to check your HTML markup code tags by using http://validator.w3.org or Thanks for pointing this out. 
There was a mistake in a conversion table. 
It's fixed now in the CVS base. 
It will be available with the next binary release.
