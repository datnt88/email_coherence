<s> Hi, It seems that Notepad on a Windows 2000 PC doesn't support standard encodings and needs CR/LF to work correctly.  </s>
<s> We can add an option in the command "Save As" that allows users to generate these CR/LF (it won't be the standard behavior).  </s>
<s> What do Amaya users think?  </s>
<s> Please forward to the appropriate person if you are not the right contact for this question.  </s>
<s> I just began testing Amaya as an alternative web page editing tool.  </s>
<s> I noticed the following behavior and wonder if there is an easy setting to change that will make this work right.  </s>
<s> The documentation did not specifically address this issue.  </s>
<s> I started with a clean HTML document written with Notepad on a Windows 2000 PC.  </s>
<s> I made one test edit in Amaya and saved the change.  </s>
<s> Everything looked fine in Amaya and in my browser.  </s>
<s> However, when I open the source file in notepad, none of the line breaks work anymore (replaced with the blank square symbol) and the file is very hard to read because everything is on "one line".  </s>
<s> The same thing happens when I save using the "save as text" option.  </s>
<s> The text is saved out, but none of the CR/LF work properly so that the document is pretty useless to me.  </s>
<s> Any guidance would be appreciated.  </s>
<s> Thanks, Anna  </s>
<s> Yes please!  </s>
<s> I've commented on this before... it's very difficult to hand edit files saved in Amaya on Notepad.  </s>
<s> Adding an option to fix it would be cool: perhaps it could be a preference setting as well as/rather than an "as you save" type of thing?  </s>

<s> Amaya needs all the effort the developers can put into making the code more stable and usable.  </s>
<s> I think what is asked is a waste of time and effort.  </s>
<s> Notepad is a notorious stupid editor.  </s>
<s> Why don't you use Writepad, instead?  </s>
<s> It's also small and much more useful (and read Unix's LF).  </s>
<s> And it's there, for you, Windows' users.  </s>

<s> Hi, Windows users can use Wordpad that understand DOS and UNIX file text format.  </s>
<s> Saludos.  </s>

<s> I too would like Amaya to be able to save files readable in Windows Notepad.  </s>
<s> A preference setting for that would be nice.  </s>
<s> Or, suggest in the Amaya help an alternative to Notepad that also is inexpensive, small, fast, and doesn't change spacing or newlines.  </s>
<s> Maybe I'll try TextPad http://TextPad.com  </s>
<s> (v4.5, US$27, 2.6 MB download) or HandyHTML always use Amaya to edit HTML.  </s>

<s> Suggestions for alternative raw text editors under windows: (For free (as in beer), the right price!) Programmer's File Editor ( http://www.lancs.ac.uk/people/cpaap/pfe ) - I use this quite heavily.  </s>
<s> It's small, fast, flexible, and can handle Huge text files.  </s>
<s> XEmacs (Yep, it's available for Win32, check out xemacs.org) vi (again, around and about.  </s>
<s> You will need to get the Cygwin package from Red Hat though.  </s>
<s> I haven't found it anywhere else) gvim (No clue where, but it does havea Win32 version) HTH, Gary Klesczewski  </s>
