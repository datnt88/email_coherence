Hi Chris, this is a PDF and archioved version of your document Jeremy Hi Jeremy, a side comment and not our main topic now, but I have been thinking a little bit more about the query language. 
Maybe I should change the syntax and move the query patterns from statement level to graph level and closer to the TriG syntax. 
Example: Select all persons which have been borne before 1970, using only statements from authors I trust. 
SELECT ?y 
WHERE ?x 
(?y rdf:type ex:Person . 
?y ex:birthyear ?z) 
null (?x saidby ?a) 
null (ex:Me trusts ?a) 
AND ?z  
"1970" and allow the abbreviation of graph names - as you proposed - if they don't matter, like in the following version of the query SELECT ?y 
WHERE ?x 
(?y rdf:type ex:Person . 
?y ex:birthyear ?z) 
(?x saidby ?a) 
(ex:Me trusts ?a) 
AND ?z  
"1970" Both only syntactical changes but the queries look more like named graphs Chris GMX ProMail (250 MB Mailbox, 50 FreeSMS, Virenschutz, 2,99 EUR/Monat...) jetzt 3 Monate GRATIS + 3x DER SPIEGEL +++ http://www.gmx.net/derspiegel +++ I like that - I will forward this to Pat and Patrick ...
