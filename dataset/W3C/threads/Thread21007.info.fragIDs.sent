<s> I know that the Amaya group is working on the GUI to solve big issues like font setting and using fonts already installed on clients system and better toolbars for MathML But I see a few big holes in rendering with CSS 1] list-styles --- lists are a very common structure in documents and numbering styles as well as image bullets are very important.  </s>

<s> The Amaya GL version handles transformations and so doesn't display a blank screen.  </s>
<s> But yes, Amaya is not a complete graphics tool and doesn't support 100% of SVG.  </s>
<s> Without any additional manpower, we could not make Amaya a complete SVG tool.  </s>
<s> A possible short term objective would be to provide a good support for a subset of SVG (needed for technical documentation).  </s>
