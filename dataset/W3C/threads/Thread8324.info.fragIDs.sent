<s> Over the past year it has become increasingly clear that I no longer have enough time to dedicate to the task of effectively leading the WebDAV Working Group.  </s>
<s> This is perhaps inevitable.  </s>
<s> When I started the WebDAV Working Group I was a PhD student, and could dedicate significant blocks of time to this project.  </s>
<s> Now, as an Assistant Professor with 8 PhD students of my own (as well as two small children at home), this is no longer the case.  </s>
<s> The final straw was me taking on the role of General Chair (organizer) of the ACM Hypertext 2004 conference, itself an enormously time consuming volunteer role.  </s>
<s> WebDAV Working Group is very close to completing its original technical agenda, a tremendous accomplishment.  </s>
<s> Many standards development efforts never come close to this, or have the adoption and impact of WebDAV.  </s>
<s> Still, we do have some final work to complete.  </s>
<s> There is the bindings specification, and the redirect references protocol.  </s>
<s> Moving 2518 to Draft Standard is still as important as ever.  </s>
<s> DASL is already effectively at a Proposed Standard level of adoption, and needs to be finished to ensure greater adoption.  </s>
<s> WebDAV WG needs a steady hand to bring these to completion, and, alas, that's no longer me.  </s>
<s> As a result, effective today, I am stepping down as Co-Chair of the WebDAV Working Group.  </s>
<s> Ted Hardie, our Applications Area Director, will be appointing Patrik Faltstrom (a former AD of the WebDAV WG) to take my place.  </s>
<s> Lisa Dusseault will be continuing her excellent work as Co-Chair.  </s>
<s> I very much encourage you to work with Patrik and Lisa (as will I) to complete the WebDAV agenda.  </s>
<s> I still intend to continue contributing to the WebDAV community.  </s>
<s> Several of my ongoing research projects have a WebDAV aspect to them, including the Catacomb server, and the Prestan performance analysis suite.  </s>
<s> I will continue to contribute to the webdav.org  </s>
<s> site, as well as help with additional explanation of the contributions and uses of the protocol.  </s>
<s> Finally, I also hope to work to interest people in building new protocols on top of WebDAV -- calendaring is one area that seems long overdue.  </s>
<s> I'm certainly not turning my back on the WebDAV community.  </s>
<s> Rather I'm acknowledging that I'm no longer the right person to lead protocol development efforts to completion.  </s>
<s> - Jim Whitehead  </s>
<s> The WebDAV WG and general WebDAV community owes a huge thank-you to Jim and this seems like an appropriate time to do that publicly.  </s>
<s> Jim led the first WebDAV BOF in San Jose in 1996, and gave a presentation [0] summarizing the design and coordination work he'd already begun to lead.  </s>
<s> Since then he's gone beyond being a simple WG chair, supporting and encouraging the DeltaV WG, hosting WebDAV Interop events and evangelizing in many ways.  </s>
<s> He has made significant technical and authoring contributions to WebDAV, particularly to the most difficult specs like DeltaV and ACL.  </s>
<s> If we're smart we'll keep Jim involved as much as possible even if not as WG chair.  </s>

<s> Yep. Thanks Jim for all the work you've done (and you and your students will be doing in the future).  </s>
<s> And welcome Patrik!  </s>
<s> Regards, Julian  </s>
