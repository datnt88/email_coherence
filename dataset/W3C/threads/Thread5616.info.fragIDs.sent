<s> OK as is, but suggest the following changes in the group's practice, which could be reflected by changes to the charter: This charter seems reasonable, but experience shows that it is hard to plan and schedule the teleconference events.  </s>
<s> It is not clear that anything will change in this regard.  </s>
<s> Perhaps a renewed focus on using the mailing list, and on closer integration with other WAI groups, would be more appropriate as a way of stimulating activity, and exchange of information.  </s>
<s> I don't know if that needs any particular change in the charter.  </s>
<s> I am not so clear about the role of a document on incoroporating accessibility in research.  </s>
<s> Beyond the fact that any decent research into human factors should be incorporating disability as a factor (along the same lines as medical research needs to include people from both genders if the plan is to unleash the results on both genders), it seems very difficult to write a general document about how to include disability factors.  </s>
<s> Moreover, it seems something that the EO group is better qualified to do.  </s>
<s> By contrast, one thing the group might do is offer to work with particular projects, and how they can best incorporate accessibility into their work, more along the lines of the Semantic Web Best Practices Working Group.  </s>
<s> This might lead to some conclusions that can be generalised (or to a conclusion that there is little that is general beyond the very obvious basics).  </s>
<s> Some example projects might include working with the Concept Coding Framework group, who are developing techniques for interchange of documents written using symbol sets such as PCS or Bliss, with providing access to VoiceXML for Deaf people through alternative interfaces, or looking at developing audio editing interfaces for structured and styled content.  </s>
<s> It seems that a quick teleconference on this kind of topic might not be as valuable as an ongoing discussion, and that WAI might be able to bring its very strong connection to and understanding of the fundamental architecture of the Web as a major added value to the discussion.  </s>
<s> A commitment of four hours per week might be better spent in asynchronous discussion by email than in trying to find appopriate times for a teleconference.  </s>
<s> This could in principle be done under the current charter and released as the resources on research, or with minor editorial changes to suggest the shifted focus.  </s>

<s> 3. Okay only with the following changes (please specify): Change "Teleconference" to "forum" throughout the document.  </s>
<s> 2.2 Scope: change "through a mailing list, teleconferences, and face-to-face meetings" to "through a mailing list, teleconferences, face-to-face meetings, and other medium" This will allow the use of Webcasts, collaborative media, IRC, captioned multimedia, and any other forums we might wish to use.  </s>
<s> Not that I think we are planning anything but teleconferences, but I could see a CSUN presentation instead of (or in addition to) a teleconference, for example.  </s>
<s> Otherwise, looks great!  </s>

<s> The scheduling difficulties are most likely tied to current resource levels, which may change.  </s>
<s> EOWG could collaborate on such a resource but RDIG is the group in the position to accumulate observations, after a sequence of teleconference events, about how research projects may respond to guidance on inclusion of accessibility considerations.  </s>
<s> It is possible that such a resource is under development elsewhere but various researchers have expressed interest in having such a resource available.  </s>

<s> Hi Judy, I think the draft is OK. But I have some small comments: - "We expect that this work may also be of interest to potential funders of Web-related research."  </s>
<s> I think we shall be more pro-active in this area.  </s>
<s> From the European side, maybe contacting the special needs unit of the EC (IST), and ask them to participate (at least in the mailing list) will be interesting.  </s>
<s> Same applies to NSF, etc.  </s>
<s> This involvement will estimulate also researchers' participation, I think.  </s>
<s> - "Teleconference events: One and one half hour teleconferences, ..." Should not this be Two-hours teleconferences ... (bearing in mind the first experience)?  </s>
<s> - "Tips for Accessibility-Aware Research: Start-up tips and very basic guidance for researchers, to help them incorporate accessibility into their research designs (not a comprehensive statement about how to do universal research design)."  </s>
<s> Should not this a little bit more formal, like, e.g., a W3C note?  </s>
<s> It will be an interesting resource to point to.  </s>

<s> Ok as is.  </s>
<s> This group may not be the place, however, including developers/manufacturers of assistive technology as part of the audience may facilitate the inclusion of the research results in actual products.  </s>
<s> Also, building a broader base of collaboration between researchers and AT developers (who generally being small companies, don't do much research) could lead to new research agendas and AT ahead of the curve of innovation.  </s>
<s> During the previous teleconferences, I have been intrigued by the range of papers submitted that do not have accessibility as part of the research goal or objective, but have an application to or impact on accessibility.  </s>
<s> I think that shows a willingness of the researchers to consider a wider use/utility for their research.  </s>
<s> If the group can get the scheduling problem under control; as more teleconferences happen, we should see more of the same response, and eventually see more research directed specifically at accessibility problems that also have broader implications for people who are non-disabled.  </s>
