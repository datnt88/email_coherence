I would suggest that an additional example be added to the discussion of boundary whitespace (3.7.1.4 Whitespace in Element Content) in the main XQuery 1.0 document. 
To wit, I'd recommend something like the following: Example: If xmlspace is not declared or is declared as xmlspace = strip, this example is equivalent to a /a . 
When considering enclosed expressions for the purpose of evaluating boundary whitespace, it's the syntactic presence or absence of an enclosed expression that's important. 
The fact that the enclosed expression in this case evaluates to an empty sequence at runtime is irrelevant to the determination that boundary whitespace is present. 
Howard Katz I assume you mean that it will be a/ . 
Best regards Michael of main following: the or runtime present. 
Whoops, I got that exactly backwards! 
The first sentence after the example snippet should read: If xmlspace is not declared or is declared as xmlspace = strip, this example is equivalent to a /a .
