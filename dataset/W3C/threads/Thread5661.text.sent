Appendix B declares two Classes (Restriction, Deprecated Class) to be subClasses of Class. 
I think this is an error. 
If it's not an error, what is the explanation?

We do not think it is an error. 
These are built-in metaclasses, the instances of which are classes. 
Thus, owl:Restriction and owl:DeprecatedClass are defined as a subclass of the general metaclass rdfs:Class (owl:Class is a subclass of rdfs:Class). 
Please let us know whether this response is satisfactory.

Home page: http://www.cs.vu.nl/~guus/ [under construction] So your class hierarchy is rdfs:Class owl:Class owl:Restriction owl:DeprecatedClass That raises several questions in my mind. 
1. Shouldn't you strive for owl:Class owl:sameAs rdfs:Class 2. Shouldn't owl:Restriction be a metaclass of rdf:Property? 
owl:Restriction rdfs:subClassOf rdf:Property 3. Likewise, shouldn't these be subClasses of rdf:Property owl:DataRange rdfs:Datatype owl:DeprecatedProperty rdfs:Literal 4. It would be desirable to define an owl:Entity class, disjoint from rdf:Property, which would include as subClasses owl:AllDifferent rdfs:Container owl:DeprecatedClass owl:Enumeration owl:Intersection rdf:List owl:Ontology owl:Union 5. The above would produce the Class hierarchy owl:Thing owl:Entity rdf:Property rdf:Statement where Entity,Property,Statement are disjoint and exhaustive. 
This hierarchy is very meaningful, from both metaphysical and epistemological viewpoints. 
Entity is the class of primary things that exist. 
Property is the class of Entity properties plus meta properties (properties of things other than entities). 
Statement is the class of relations between things.
