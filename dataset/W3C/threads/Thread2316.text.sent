Why and when did the Title: header disappear? 
(I find it in v11-spec-01, but not in v11-spec-06) Libwww-perl generates this header internally for HTML documents by looking at the title ... /title element.

Hi Gisle, Sometime between those drafts. 
It was removed because it wasn't being used much, because it duplicates the purpose of Content-Description in MIME, and because, like any Entity-Header, it can be used freely without the need for standardization. 
That's okay -- what we do internally is our own business (e.g., my use of 600 level response codes to indicate client failures).

Don't you mean "no standardization in HTTP"? 
If it is to be of more than private use, then it is extremely useful to have a spec somewhere that says what it means, so that everyone uses it in the same way to mean the same thing. 
Said spec could even be a standard. 
Paul I made an editorial decision as editor that it should go (on discussion with Roy), as duplications of Mime, with different names, is Evil. 
In some future version of HTTP, one could note what headers in HTTP are adopted directly from MIME. - Jim Is current practice relevant? 
I can cite you hundreds of servers using it. 
True this is a tiny fraction of all servers. 
I don't think it is fair to call this decision an editorial decision. 
If you had decided to change the name to the corresponding MIME header that could be called editorial. 
As it is, a decision was made that prevents its use in other than ad hoc ways. 
This is a functionality which HTTP used to have and no longer does. 
Don't some search engines use it? 
In fact, I would find an argument to make it mandatory persuasive.

Re removing "Title:" Yes, you're right: this was not an 'editorial' decision. 
The accepted procedure was that any feature not explicitly HTTP/1.0 and for which there was no consensus to add to HTTP/1.1 would be removed from HTTP/1.1, and it was on those grounds that Title was dropped. 
A number of items that appear in appendix D ("Additional Features") of RFC 1945 (HTTP/1.0) did not make it into 1.1 for similar reasons. 
Regards, Larry I wouldn't be happy about any change to http which made analysis of the content of a file mandatory. 
We should not demand that servers analyze HTML. 
And in current practice, my experience as the designer of a search tool is that titles are used to provide meaningful captions on browser screens not sumarize the document content which would be useful for search engines. 
I haven't looked at the mime spec so it may already agree with me ... but if HTTP were to include a header relating to title or document content it should be clearly a document description which might be provided by a server and might (NOT mandatory) be provided by content analysis or meta data stored by the server external to the document. 
It should not be directly specified as being a particular element of a particular content type. 
Dave Morris I wouldn't really argue that it be mandatory. 
I was venting my pique that it was removed (even from an appendix) without discussion. 
I agree with everything you say and I hope that a header with this functionality can make its way back into HTTP/1.2. 
The Title header (its name is not important) as implemented in the WN server has many of the aspects you suggest. 
It is provided from meta data stored external to the document which can be set by the maintainer, but is by default automatically extracted from HTML documents if not set (this extraction is done once when the meta data is "compiled" not every time the document is served). 
Non HTML documents which have no title set get the filename by default. 
I would really like to see not only Title, but also Keywords. 
Abstract would be nice too, but perhaps that could be done with "Link".
