<s> The difficulty is introduced by CSS allowing user-defined sheets.  </s>
<s> In  </s>
<s> earlier HTML, there were a fixed number of Styles (H1, H2, P, UL etc).  </s>
<s> Setting up 'presentation sheets' for these could take advantage of the  </s>
<s> multi-media aspects of CSS such as the ability to define an audio style, a screen style, etc. without risking it being subsequently over-ridden.  </s>
<s> (Except Author sheets override reader sheets, which seems stupid to me) Another possibility would be to change the interpretation of specificity.  </s>
<s> If a user could declare an H1 style, to be regarded as specific to every instance of H1, including a class, id, etc, it would alleviate the difficulty.  </s>

<s> H1, H2, O, UL are not style, they are structure&amp;content.  </s>
<s> Style is for presentation, and when I write UL in a document, I mean  </s>
<s> "this is a list of items", the presentation is independent, you can  </s>
<s> voice it, print it, screen it, braille it, up to you.  </s>
<s> Can you rephrase your issue ?  </s>
<s> (the question is below the answer) in HTML, H1 is a structural element.  </s>
<s> It specifies what role the block plays (in this case, level 1 heading).  </s>
<s> But it makes intuitive sense to  </s>
<s> view it as the name of a style, as well.  </s>
<s> In fact CSS begins by doing just  </s>
<s> this.  </s>
<s> The difficulty is that CSS then allows the major group H1 to be sub-classed.  </s>
<s> From a perspective of allowing users control, this introduces the difficulty raised in this thread.  </s>
<s> It seems that a solution may be to reexamine the CSS rules.  </s>
<s> If these allowed greater weight for reader's rules than those of the author, and provided a mechanism where a reader could make general declarations but artificially raise their specificity, the problem may disappear.  </s>
<s> As an example, if I could declare, in my reader screen styles that H1 should be color:purple size:massive, and that this declaration was to be regarded as having the specificity of an H1 with a particular id and class attribute, it seems that the problem would go away.  </s>
<s> I have ignored the problem of author/reader precedence for the example.  </s>
<s> But that should be easily soluble.  </s>

<s> The user style sheet need to more than over ride author styles or even there sub classing styles like H1. Since many authors will use absolute positioning in spatial formatting, if you say enlarge all H1 (and it also  </s>

<s> This issue has been discussed before on this list, in the context of media  </s>
<s> types.  </s>
<s> The outcome of those deliberations can be conveniently recapitulated by contrasting two examples.  </s>
<s> 1.  </s>
<s> The user's default style sheet is of type media="aural".  </s>
<s> In this case, only subsequent style sheets of type media="oral" will modify the user's preferences.  </s>
<s> This is a desirable outcome, for it allows the author, should he or she wish to do so, to exercise control over the audio rendering, with the default being supplied by the user.  </s>
<s> 2. The media type of the user's default style sheet is a parameterized value, for instance a hypothetical media type of media="screen enlarged",  </s>
<s> which is not presently defined in any specification but which, for the sake of illustration, may be regarded as designating a style sheet which establishes a large font and perhaps a particular colour scheme.  </s>
<s> Now there are two ways in which subsequent styles of the same base type, in this scenario they would be of type media="screen", could be treated: (I) they could be ignored; (II) they could participate in the cascade and thus override the provisions of the default style sheet of type media="screen enlarged".  </s>
<s> Now it was generally agreed, in our previous treatment of this topic, that behaviour (II) should be preferred.  </s>
<s> It was argued that, for example, it would be absurd if the provisions of a default style sheet of type  </s>
<s> media="braille embossed 40" could not be modified by a style later in the cascading order of type media="braille".  </s>
<s> However, as the example of large fonts indicates, there are cases in which behaviour (I) as enumerated above would be the preferable option, thereby preventing style sheets of type media="screen enlarged" from being subject to later styles of type media="screen".  </s>
<s> One solution might be to introduce a directive into CSS which, if present in a style sheet, indicates that only subsequent styles which match the media type exactly will participate in the cascade.  </s>
<s> Thus, in the default style sheet of type media="screen enlarged", the proposed directive would be included.  </s>
<s> Any later style sheet of type media="screen" would, pursuant to this directive, be excluded from the cascade, since it would not exactly match the media type of "screen enlarged".  </s>
<s> A fortiori, any later style of type media="screen enlarged", whether supplied by the user or the author, would match and would thus participate in the cascade.  </s>
<s> Hi all, The latest version of the CSS2 specification draft (11/07/1997) specifies the following cascading order.  </s>
<s> It includes an "important" attribute (as Jutta suggested).  </s>
<s> for more info see http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-CSS2/cascade.html 1. declarations marked '!important' carry more weight than unmarked (normal) declarations.  </s>
<s> 2. Author's style sheets override reader's style sheets which override the user agent's default values.  </s>
<s> 3. More specific declarations override more general ones.  </s>
<s> "This strategy gives author's style sheets considerably higher weight than those of the reader.  </s>
<s> It is therefore important that the user agent gives the user the ability to turn off the influence of certain style sheets, e.g. through a pull-down menu...A reader rule with an important declaration will override an author rule with a normal declaration.  </s>
<s> An author rule with an important declaration will override a reader rule with an important declaration."  </s>

<s> CMcCN:: The CSS standard does this.  </s>
<s> But it is a recommendation.  </s>
<s> Why not make it part of the Cascade rules?  </s>
<s> The virtue of this is it is fairly easy to make the change, and it would be retro-active for CSS1.  </s>
<s> The problem of specificity is a little harder.  </s>
<s> It would be possible simply to allow ANY user Style to override author styles, and ignore the specificity rules.  </s>
<s> But they can be a useful tool.  </s>
<s> So it would be better to include a mechanism which allows the user to set the specificity of their style.  </s>
<s> For example, I may like to have my H2 style override any H2 subclass, but have a (differently styled) H2 subclass which will override an H2 with an ID attribute.  </s>
<s> This preserves the ability to mark out particular objects which the subclassing allows.  </s>

<s> I think that we need to come up with something that is simple for end user to use to get the presentation they need.  </s>
<s> We have not even talked about what happens if a scripting language starts to modify style sheet attributes.  </s>
<s> I would like to propose that an accessible WWW page is one that renders the information content well without the style sheet, and therefore turning off the author styles and substituting the users style sheet will solve alot of problems.  </s>
<s> The limitation of this approach is the ability of authors to varify that information is still rendered logically without the style sheet.  </s>
<s> This also does not solve all problems like tables and frames, but gives the user alot of control over visual effects such as color and font features.  </s>

<s> (in summary) We need a simple system for users to determine the outcome.  </s>
<s> There are several aspects to explore, such as scripting languages modifying the style sheets, the ability of authors to varify that information is still rendered logically without the style sheet, tables and frames.  </s>
<s> CMcCN:: If the user prevailed in the Cascade, then the problem shrinks to making sure the sense of a document is not distorted by removing the style.  </s>
<s> This should be reasonably simple.  </s>
<s> If an author uses too much styling, they run a great risk of incomprehensibility.  </s>
<s> This is not just a WAI issue.  </s>
<s> The most common example I find is the use of half a dozen icons for navigation, which are comprehensible only to the people who made them.  </s>
<s> However it seems a difficult concept for many people.  </s>
<s> Part of the reason the web appeals is its ability to handle graphic content.  </s>
<s> And many of the people employed to make content have a background in graphics.  </s>
<s> Often they don't understand the technical problems they are creating.  </s>
<s> In my experience, they are often good at creating graphics, but actually quite bad at communicating with graphics, let alone in any other medium.  </s>
<s> How you solve that problem is a thorny one, since the people employing them often know less than the designers.  </s>
<s> Otherwise somebody who understood the problems would get the job.  </s>
<s> I have ignored the problem of how a user learns to create their own styles to ensure that a sensibly written page is comprehensible, or where they get a third party stylesheet which they make their own.  </s>
<s> I think it is not such a huge problem.  </s>
<s> thoughts anybody?  </s>
