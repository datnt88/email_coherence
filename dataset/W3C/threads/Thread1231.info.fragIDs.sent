<s> It looks like by chance I'm just barely in time for this last call.  </s>
<s> Some comments, none major showstoppers:  </s>
<s> Good to hear.  </s>
<s> I'm basically looking at this as "do the ones that are OK to handle as last call comments".  </s>
<s> Stuff that requires discussion or a new last call needs to wait for the next time around.  </s>
<s> - The first sentence on page 3 has some strange repetition: 'to allow charsets' in the first line; 'to be used as charsets' at the end.  </s>
<s> Fixed.  </s>
<s> - Section 2.5: 'A given CES is typically associated with a single CCS': For the UTF-8 example, this is definitely true (and helpful to be pointed out).  </s>
<s> For others CESs, I think it's wrong.  </s>
<s> The classical example is what I would call here the 'identity 8-bit CES', which is used in the whole ISO-8859-X series and many other cases.  </s>
<s> I'll change it from "typically" to "sometimes".  </s>
<s> - Section 3.1, 'All registered charsets MUST note whether or not they are suitable for use in MIME text.' and Sec. 6, 'Suitability for use in Mime text:': As recent discussion has shown, this may benefit from some careful clarification, but I guess this already is on your todo list.  </s>
<s> It is on my to-do list, but it isn't something I want to address in this registration procedure update.  </s>
<s> - 3.1 'constructed as a composition of a CCS and a CES...': CCS appears three times in singular.  </s>
<s> There are many charsets where a CES combines more than one CCS.  </s>
<s> Same problem again in the registration template.  </s>
<s> Good point.  </s>
<s> I'll make them plural.  </s>
<s> - 'All registered charsets MUST be specified in a *stable*': What about extensions, such as for ISO 10646?  </s>
<s> What about variants, such as for Shift_JIS (vendor extensions as well as mapping variants, for the later see e.g. http://www.w3.org/TR/japanese-xml/).  </s>
<s> What about them?  </s>
<s> The requirement is for a stable specification and nothing more.  </s>
<s> Updating the specification is OK as long as whatever rules that specification gives for updating are followed.  </s>
<s> (We have a detailed set of such rules for UTF-8, for example.)  </s>
<s> The primary point here is that we don't want a definition based on a pointer to a document which then vanishes, leaving us with a name and nothing else.  </s>
<s> - 3.3 talks about names, and a primary name.  </s>
<s> The registry uses the terms 'name', 'alias', and also 'preferred MIME name'.  </s>
<s> It would be very helpful if the terminology were unified.  </s>
<s> That's an issue for the registry, not for the present document.  </s>
<s> - 3.5 'ONLY if it adds significant value': I have heard from some people that this strict requirement has lead to some contraproductive effects, in particular things being used with x- prefixes for years.  </s>
<s> I think it would make sense to tone this down a bit.  </s>
<s> If you were talking about MIME types I might agree.  </s>
<s> But this is charsets, and we've seen no reluctance in this space to register everything under the sun.  </s>
<s> And perhaps more to the point, we had a lot of trouble reconciling the views of people who feel that charset registration should be restricted whenever possible and people who feel that registering everything that comes along is a good idea.  </s>
<s> This language is the carefully crafted result -- I don't think it would be appropriate for me to change it based on your say-so.  </s>
<s> In any case, if you feel this is worth pursuing I would suggest that you bring up specific examples of where this language has caused harm and see if a consensus can be reach to change it.  </s>
<s> - 3.6: The requirement of documenting the mapping to ISO 10646 where possible is great.  </s>
<s> It may be worth for the IETF to look at formats to do this in a machine-readable way.  </s>
<s> For an example, please have a look at http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr22/.  </s>
<s> This is beyond the scope of this document.  </s>
<s> - Section 4.1: 'The intent of the public posting is to solicit comments and feedback on the definition of the charset and the name choosen for it over a two week period.':  </s>
<s> At the end of the sentence, the references are not exactly clear.  </s>
<s> The name choosen for the definition of the charset?  </s>
<s> The name choosen for a two week period?  </s>
<s> This can easily be improved, I guess.  </s>
<s> Fixed.  </s>
<s> - 4.2: 'Decisions made by the reviewer must be posted to the ietf- charsets mailing within 14 days.':  </s>
<s> Within 14 days of the decision?  </s>
<s> That would be pretty easy; nobody can prove to the reviewer that he made a decision three months ago if he forgot to post it and claims that it took him three month to actually take the decision :-).  </s>
<s> Well, it is pretty obvious that the intent is two weeks after submission to the reviewer.  </s>
<s> But I'll clean up the language.  </s>
<s> - 5. The text about the 'Assigned Numbers' RFC reads hopelessly outdated in the age of the web, and rather strange given that the last such RFC was issued in 1994.  </s>
<s> This is outside the scope of this document.  </s>
<s> - 5. Given some recent explanations by Harald about how to coordinate charset registration and RFC publication, it seems to be a good idea to explain that roughly, so that further registrants don't start from the wrong end.  </s>
<s> This will have to wait for the next revision.  </s>
<s> - 6. 'A URL to a specification' - 'A URI to a specification'.  </s>
<s> Fixed.  </s>
<s> - [ISO-8859]: Lots of updates here, please see e.g.  </s>
<s> Fixed.  </s>
<s> - [ISO-10646]: Please update this to refer to the 2000 version!  </s>
<s> The ISO catalogue doesn't list it yet so I didn't update it.  </s>
<s> If I get a reference before publication I'll handle it as an author edit.  </s>
<s> Ned  </s>
<s> It looks like by chance I'm just barely in time for this last call.  </s>
<s> Some comments, none major showstoppers:  </s>
<s> Makes sense.  </s>
<s> But I don't agree on all points with your classification.  </s>
<s> - Section 3.1, 'All registered charsets MUST note whether or not they are suitable for use in MIME text.' and Sec. 6, 'Suitability for use in Mime text:': As recent discussion has shown, this may benefit from some careful clarification, but I guess this already is on your todo list.  </s>
<s> It seems to be the case that: - There is consensus (in the IETF sense) on the meaning of the above sentences.  </s>
<s> - It was shown that the interpretation of the above sentences may pose some problems.  </s>
<s> This seems to be a typical case for a last call correction.  </s>
<s> - 'All registered charsets MUST be specified in a *stable*': What about extensions, such as for ISO 10646?  </s>
<s> What about variants, such as for Shift_JIS (vendor extensions as well as mapping variants, for the later see e.g. http://www.w3.org/TR/japanese-xml/).  </s>
<s> Thanks for giving the interpretation of 'stable'.  </s>
<s> This is a reasonable interpretation, but there are others, and the doc should make clear what interpretation is intended.  </s>
<s> - 3.3 talks about names, and a primary name.  </s>
<s> The registry uses the terms 'name', 'alias', and also 'preferred MIME name'.  </s>
<s> It would be very helpful if the terminology were unified.  </s>
<s> Well, if it cannot be unified, it would at least be helpful to point out that there are differences, and which terms correspond to which.  </s>
<s> - [ISO-10646]: Please update this to refer to the 2000 version!  </s>
<s> Below is an excerpt from a mail from mike Ksar, convener of the WG responsible for ISO 10646:  </s>
<s> From: mike_ksar@hp.com  </s>
<s> ISO/IEC 10646-1:2000 Information technology -- Universal Multiple-Octet Coded Character Set (UCS) -- Part 1: Architecture and Basic Multilingual Plane Regards, Martin.  </s>
<s> That may well be, but without substantive support from other quarters -- support I've seen no signs of -- I'm not going to accomodate your positions on these points.  </s>
<s> - Section 3.1, 'All registered charsets MUST note whether or not they are suitable for use in MIME text.' and Sec. 6, 'Suitability for use in Mime text:': As recent discussion has shown, this may benefit from some careful clarification, but I guess this already is on your todo list.  </s>
<s> I don't agree.  </s>
<s> This is a much bigger problem and the registry needs to be cleaned up before it gets addressed.  </s>
<s> (Work to clean up the registry is already underway, but I don't want to wait for it to finish before getting this update out.)  </s>
<s> - 'All registered charsets MUST be specified in a *stable*': What about extensions, such as for ISO 10646?  </s>
<s> What about variants, such as for Shift_JIS (vendor extensions as well as mapping variants, for the later see e.g. http://www.w3.org/TR/japanese-xml/).  </s>
<s> I'll see what I can do as a RFC editor note, but I note in passing that you seem to be the only one who was confused by this.  </s>
<s> - 3.3 talks about names, and a primary name.  </s>
<s> The registry uses the terms 'name', 'alias', and also 'preferred MIME name'.  </s>
<s> It would be very helpful if the terminology were unified.  </s>
<s> I'd much rather correct the problem than try to work around it.  </s>
<s> - [ISO-10646]: Please update this to refer to the 2000 version!  </s>
<s> I'll make the change as an RFC Editor note.  </s>
<s> Ned  </s>
