Hello, As part of resolving issue 235 [1], I'd like to propose the following note after checkpoint 8.1 and the following addition to the techniques document. 
Checkpoint and note: 8.1 Make available to the user the author-specified purpose of each table and the relationships among the table cells and headers. 
For example, provide information about table headers, how headers relate to cells, table summary information, cell position information, table dimensions, etc. Graphical user agents may satisfy this checkpoint by rendering a table as a two dimensional grid and ensuring that users can find headers associated with cells. 
Technique: In HTML, beyond the TR, TH, and TD elements, the table attributes "summary", "abbr", "headers", "scope", and "axis" provide information about relationships among cells and headers. 
For more information, refer to the section on table techniques.

Sounds good to me.

Where cells are blocked into axes, or colgroups, there should be some way of rendering this information (CSS is a good technique - surprise!) Charles McCN Sounds good to me.
