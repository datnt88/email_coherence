Checkpoints for Guideline 4 are now up. 
Also a modification to Checkpoint 3.5. 
Please note, I haven't yet gone back to modify the text of the Guideline slides. 
They are still essentially the full-text of the Proposed draft. 
That is why some of them read oddly.

GL 4 and 3 differ markedly in font size?? 
CPL:: You are correct. 
Not in IE4, but in Netscape 4. I have looked at the code of both files and I cannot, for the life of me, figure out why that should be so. 
If any of you sharp eyed sleuths want to take a stab at solving the mystery, please be my guest.

I think it's spelled "occurrence" and later "occasion" 
CPL:: fixed in checkpoint 4.2 
4.3 "If the entire document will be in a foreign language" This is an "Ugly American"ism. 
I believe the point of the checkpoint is to "Identify the primary natural language of a document." 
and "foreign" or not doesn't enter into it. 
CPL: An an "Unpleasant Canadian"ism as well. 
It will be fixed. 
Thanks!

The font changes intermittently from page to page. 
I could not find a pattern. 
So, I played with the style sheet some. 
BODY.gid {BACKGROUND: #eeeeff; COLOR: #000000; FONT-FAMILY: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; FONT-SIZE: 18pt; MARGIN-LEFT: 5%; MARGIN-RIGHT: 5%} changed FONT-SIZE: 18px to 18pt works in netscape for the 5 pages I played with, and pages function normally in IE, and Opera.
