While I'm happy to see that schema support is not mandatory in XSLT, I'm a little concerned that it appears impossible to write a stylesheet for a schema aware processor that falls back gracefully on a basic one. 
XSLT has always had quite good support for forwards and backwards compatible behaviour and run-time testing for (and avoidance of) non-implemented extensions. 
However [ERR XT1660] A basic XSLT processor must signal a static error if the stylesheet includes an [xsl:]type attribute, or an [xsl:]validation or default-validation attribute with a value other than strip. 
seems to mean that I can't go ... xsl:validation ... ... just relax .... Wouldn't it be possible for a basic processor to simply ignore schema-import and then have run time rather than static errors if any schema specific features are encountered?

Thanks for the comment. 
It seems (to me personally) to be a reasonable suggestion. 
I'm not far how we would want to take it though - for example would this also apply to types in the "as" attribute of xsl:variable, to types in "cast" or "instance of" expression, and so on? 
I think that one might not want this behaviour by default.

As a guiding principle, I think that if an XSLT 2 stylesheet can run successfully on an XSLT 1 processor (using the forward compatibly and fallback behaviour specified there) it should be able to run on an XSLT 2 basic processor.
