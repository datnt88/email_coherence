<s> It is when reading words is needed for repeated and important navigation elements that graphical text becomes a barrier to accessibility.  </s>

<s> Did not dare get sucked into it - anyway, someone should propose something ;) Anyway With the current wording, text that does not have a primarily grafical function in a graphic is out.  </s>
<s> What about a review of the term text and textual content, or adjustment to the word to make it "relevant textual content" in other words, content that is relevant to the aim or a goal of the site, should not be in the form of a graphic, unless that text is of a has a primarily graphical function - I.E. not banners and ads OK the wording sucks.  </s>
<s> Oh all right, I'll try again 3.1 When an appropriate markup language exists AND WILL WORK, use markup rather than images to convey information TO ALLOW TEXT SCALABILITY.  </s>
<s> [Priority 2] For example, use SVG for line art, MathML to mark up mathematical equations, and CSS for text-oriented special effects.  </s>
<s> You may not present relevant textual content as an image, unless the text has a primarily graphical function, and the effect cannot be achieved with markup, (as in the case of some for logos and limited accent elements) provided that you provide a textual equivalent to the content contained in the image.  </s>
<s> That, with a glossary definition, should take care of annoying banners that no user wants to see.  </s>
<s> Still could do with a rewrite See U, L  </s>

<s> The key to the problem is not that these are images - that is a symptom.  </s>
<s> The key is that they cannot be (easily?) presented in a different way by someone who can't use the presentation form given.  </s>

<s> The same can be said for text used instead of graphics.  </s>
<s> As Jonathon points out so often, the perception is that text annt be (easily?) presented in a different way by someone who can't use the presentation form given.  </s>
<s> Disabled people (not people with cell phones) are being flummoxed by text not enhanced by illustrations ... the buttons with text are as difficult to understand by those who can't use the text, as for those who can't enlarge it sufficiently.  </s>
<s> Incidently, if graphics were put on all buttons that are now too small to show the alt tag, the resultant size would probably allow good usage of that accommodation!  </s>
