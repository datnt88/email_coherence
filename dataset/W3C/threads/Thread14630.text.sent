Kynn (et al.), I am quite relieved that I am not in out-and-out disagreement with you here! 
Your list (a) - (e) is very good, but I do want to qualify a few things for anyone following this thread. 
(b) Good ALT text is quite sufficient (i.e., better than "generally considered") to remove the barrier to access for people who are blind (and using a screen reader with synthesized speech or dynamic Braille display). 
(c) Good ALT text lessens the barrier to access for many people with low vision, but they will still find it difficult to access information in the document. 
Somewhere between (c) and (d) is the user interface. 
People with low vision have the day-today experience and extremely reasonable expectation and that textual elements are scaleable. 
They are use to one or more of the following techniques: (1) getting a bigger monitor, (2) having the OS default to a high contrast / large font size scheme, (3) setting an acceptable default font (and colors) within their browser, (4) choosing the "larger" setting from within their browser, and (5) using a customized style sheet to format. 
Graphical text, of course, defeats ALL of these common accommodation strategies. 
(d) There are other work-around (for the bad pages that include graphical text) in addition to disabling images. 
Mouse-over pop-ups is sufficient for some folks with low vision for example. 
(Others will not benefit from this technique.) Screen magnification (even of graphical text) is adequate for _some_ for most of the pages they encounter. 
Alternative browsers are used by some as an accommodation. 
I am not aware of any studies, but I would guess that the technique of disabling images is, for most people with low vision, a "cure" that is not worth the cost. 
(Just as the "cure" of using screen magnification is often declined.) Somewhere between (d) and (e) the point needs to be made that the existence of these work-arounds and alternatives do NOT totally eliminate the barrier caused by textual graphics. 
That's why this is a P2 issue and not P1 or P3. 
The use of the terms "satisfactory" or "sufficient" can be quite subjective. 
(e) I don't agree that your final point is the "clear solution", although it might be a fair long term approach. 
I would suggest that a more reasonable conclusion is that content providers should use CSS when they want to put text on a graphic! 
SVG is likely to be well supported (and therefore a good choice) long before we have some other (and completely new) way to differentiate text-heavy images from other graphics. 
I agree that _right now_ SVG is not much of a solution, but that will change (hopefully, rather quickly). 
[I was quite disappointed to find that an SVG viewer was NOT incorporated into Navigator 6.] With regard to your other message on this immediate sub-thread, I agree that permutations of: are pretty terrible because of the redundant rendering of "next". 
Len's example endorses your CSS / ALT technique suggestion: img class="buttonimg" src="twirl.gif" 
alt="" width="75" height="50" border="0" /a I would guess that Q border="0" /Q is there to accommodate the non-conformant behavior of browsers. 
(This could be another argument for transitional doctype on Double-A pages.) Anne (and perhaps others) won't like it, but I still think that: a href="page02.html" 
title="Page two of three." 
img src="rarrow.gif" 
alt="Next!" /a is the way to go (unless one is specially setting up a web page to simulate an aug. 
com. 
board). 
If an icon image is so weak (or subject to interpretation) that it requires text to illustrate its function -- then either drop the image (and just use the text) or improve the graphic! 
Unless, of course (and as the case with Anne) the purpose of the page is to teach literacy skills.

Sent: Friday, December 15, 2000 12:54 PM Subject: RE: the text in images issue [was: errata...] I think our main problem is the following: (a) Textual graphics are a barrier to people who require the ability to magnify text. 
(b) Alt text is generally considered sufficient to remove the barrier to access for people who can't see an image. 
(c) Using the alt text for those images -would- be sufficient to allow access, BUT: (d) To access the alt text, the user needs to disable ALL images on a page, which is less than optimal for web users who need to magnify text but who can otherwise see graphics. 
(e) The clear solution is that there needs to be a way to designate certain images as being those that should be -replaced- if resized, while others as not being replaced. 
There does not seem to be a way to do this in HTML or CSS at present. 
This whole argument is basically caused by a huge gaping hole in the markup languages used to create web pages. 
So, if we were going to reinvent HTML, how would we solve the problem? 
Perhaps an attribute related to resizing, which would then be recognized by browsers? 
Maybe a CSS property? 
Something else? 
I'm not sure what the solution is, but I think there may be a way to overcome this problem. 
(Using SVG is not, right now, a solution...) Bruce, You may have a point ... 
I'm not sure where the idea of an arrow in the right and left corners to indicate next one and back one originated, but it may be a computer "thing" ... it allows the user control of the timing, but the arrows are not intuitive symbols, nor is "a" graphic in the corners. 
Non-readers see the text "next" as a rectangular blob ... But as William points out, whatever graphic or word we use, the use of it to mean "the page that follows this in the series" will have to be learned ... We've got a start on the bottom left and right corner, and arrows are the most commonly used graphic... but until they are learned, the text needs to be there to make the graphic "accessible" to the maximum number of people ... Consider, if the word isn't on the graphic, low vision people who need the text with the graphic (cuss the fact that they need a crutch, but give it to 'em), wouldn't have the text there, and they'll be in the same boat as those who use the web without magnification and need the text ... doen't magnification users get the mouseover pop-up? 
By banning the text on the graphic, you are handicapping more people than you are "accommodating" ... and the "accommodation" doesn't give anything more to those who can't see the text on the graphic at their magnification level, they are still in the dark as much as everyone else ... Anne Anne L. Pemberton apembert@crosslink.net 
Enabling Support Foundation I am not suggesting an outright ban on text in graphics. 
I am asserting that it is a P2 violation to use graphics to present text. 
If a content provider wants to pair icons with words and wishes to do so in fashion that can be consider accessible, then she has two good choices: SVG or CSS. 
I'm afraid that because of the (perceived?) inadequacies of both, as well as their inherent "backward incompatability", most authors find neither of these AT THIS TIME to be "good choices". 
However, having said that (grudgingly, in a way), it seems that since the path to Recommendation is at a minimum 6 months and since before any checkpoints are allowable there must be demonstrably usable implementations, there is no reason not to look forward enough to use both in our document. 
If we turn out to be wrong, it's just a matter of changing some words, if in fact they turn out to be "good choices" then it would be silly not to account for them. 
Both technologies have significant notes about the accessibility advantages they present and unless we rescind those papers, we must respect them. 
IOW we are betting that a year from now the fact that CSS was only partially implemented in the year 2000 will seem quaint and the idea of using raster graphics for much of anything will be close to unthinkable. 
Love. 
ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE I said there where two good choices. 
I didn't claim that they were great choices! 
(smile) In any case, both SVG and CSS are better than graphical text. 
The inadequacies of bitmaps (especially for words) are well documented. 
I am glad you are bullish on CSS. 
What's your prognostication for SVG? 
I doubt that raster images will be disappearing all that quickly, but hopefully their use will mostly be for photographs.

On Behalf Of William Loughborough Sent: Monday, December 18, 2000 9:24 AM Subject: RE: the text in images issue The use of "style sheets" at all is more of a leap for many authors than is the move to a particular implementation thereof. 
Just the concept of having a "presentation descriptor" is something many blindless people have trouble with because of such prejudices as "seeing is believing" or "it's right there in front of your eyes". 
Many of us just don't understand that there is an underlying "what" that's somehow being re-presented. 
We have for so long mistaken the medium for the message that it's a hard severance to expect compliance with, as is evident from the long-raging exchanges herein. 
CSS is sort of the "last best hope" for getting this done and my "bullishness" on it is based mainly on the business case arguments for its use. 
It is so clearly more efficient (once the initial bigotry towards it is overcome) that it will be as "second-nature" of a thing for Web designers (as it sort of already has been in print, where the word "style" is frequently understood in the sense it is used in CSS) as it was for the designers of SGML. 
People who wrote documents for UNIX traditionally had a separate file that expressed the presentation of what had been captured as what we call "content" in a text file. 
Love. 
ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE changing those I'd put money up against that bet. 
How long has PNG been a solid standard? 
It's obviously superior to both GIF and JPEG for most applications. 
But due to the inertia of browser makers and the market at large, even while most graphics tools support most of PNG, it's a dormant technology. 
CSS has been here for several years now, and there still isn't sufficient talent out there using it as anything more than a cool layout widget to be able to point it out as a serious accessibility tool. 
It's seen by designers as a way to change this color or remove the underline from links, not as the ultimate vision of the W3C. 
While I'm sure it's not the job of this working group to second-guess the larger organization's published opinions, I still think it's premature to say CSS Is The Way (or worse, CSS Is The Only Way) to do certain things. 
I think the gap between specification and widespread adoption is a lot longer than a year. 
In the case of CSS, I think it's at least another 18 months, taking into account IE4's level of support has been around since September of 1997; with SVG, closer to 36 months to 90% user agent penetration and full tool compliance (and no less than 5 years to the utopia in which they're used the way W3C expects) is my bet. 
There are tools available for CSS, but many of them are probably not robust enough to support accurate, cross-platform, cross-browser representations. 
And to derive the ultimate benefit, that requirement excludes a number of still serviceable user agents. 
SVG doesn't even have that: no installed base, no widespread commercial tools, and none of the real-world experience WCAG has used to base its own guidelines/techniques/checkpoints upon. 
It's that experience that is the bread and butter of the checkpoints. 
Until that base of knowledge is there, I think a strategy of pushing it before it's supported really helps anyone. 
If we can't come up with anything better than an educated guess, nobody's going to be happy with the results, and that could decrease the perceived value of the guidelines as a whole. 
matt no widespread commercial tools, Except Flash. 
Which claims to be installed on 96% of all in-use browsers. 
It's of course not strictly "SVG" but it is scalable vector graphics. 
I despair a lot about the delays in CSS implementation but OTOH I expect quicker avenues of dispersal to emerge. 
I presume your "Until that base of knowledge is there, I think a strategy of pushing it before it's supported really helps anyone." was a "grammar typo" and that you meant it "doesn't help anyone". 
I think that if stuff isn't pushed before it's fully supported, it won't get supported. 
By the time Norman Thomas died his heavily-ridiculed platform was pretty much fully implemented. 
1 year, 3 years, same thing. 
PNG on the other hand is pretty much a pointless step compared to what vector vs. raster graphics brings and the proliferation of metada (probably via RDF) will be so machine-doable that it might happen pretty quick. 
As somebody in the dim recesses of memory said "I don't gamble - I play poker" so I won't really bet on the date of any of the above: I just used the "I bet" expression jovially. 
Love. 
ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE Per one of my action items from last meeting... There's some examples of three images images in a row, with real text labels underneath each, at It may look visually like text is part of the image but actually it uses separate, real text. 
These examples: 1. Show that images can be placed in a row, with real textlabels underneath, validate to HTML 4.01, and still have a good reading order (at least when the browser linearizes tables) (It will also work on old browsers that simple ignore links with null alt text). 
2. Underline that the issue is not the merit of having a textual description next or visually part of an image. 
I think we all agree such labels are valuable. 
The issue is only whether this visual appearance can be implemented acceptably without actually making the text part of the image. 
3. Show an extra implementation detail: separating the table cells by cells containing a single BR , to improve readability in Lynx.

The download is quick and painless, so it seems to be more a question of public awerness of these new tecnologies. 
I think the argument that we should aviode recomending somthing, that has commersial builing and a viewing tool, just because it is not widly used, falles a bit flat. 
Afterall the WAI is about recomending difrent ways of doing things, that are morte accesible. 
If we were only to recomend what peaple are already doing - well need I say more. 
From: "Lisa Seeman" seeman@netvision.net.il 
Awareness is the key. 
If it doesn't come in the box, most people don't download it. 
This is especially true of designers, who are the entire market for Adobe's tools. 
Before we even know how (not to mention whether) designers are going to use it? 
How would WCAG 1.0 have been drafted before HTML 1.0 was published? 
are doing - But people are not already doing it. 
Not in the design community, and not among anyone but the curious and early adopters. 
SVG is not widespread, and it's not going to become that way overnight. 
There is a lot of infrastructure to be built before that happens, and my fear is that to prescribe a solution which clearly will not meet the needs of many people, including those without up-to-date accessibility technologies, is the argument that falls flat. 
I agree that there should be a strong nudge toward SVG, but "use it right now and here's how," especially if the idea is that it's tied to a certain level of compliance. 
matt most people don't download it. 
Over 90% of Web users have downloaded Flash! 
I bet (metaphorically) that a similar stat for RealAudio and certain other implementations is not out of order? 
This stuff happens very fast. 
The Web is only a decade old and Mosaic is already a museum curiosity. 
This is the first trillion dollar industry to happen in such a short time. 
We *can't* wait until it's already widespread or it won't get widespread. 
Our recommendations won't be "Recommendations" for at least six months. 
Love. 
ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE Most of the Flash users in fact didn't download it, but had it bundled, which is the web version of "in the box." 
I'm talking about the development tools here, though. 
Adding plugins to Adobe products is a much more involved process than what is seen as a transparent process in adding to IE (but is still pretty goofy in NN 4). 
What makes you think SVG is going to be implemented any more successfully by the designers, user agents and tools vendors than PNG? 
After all, they'll say, we've already got Flash to do vector graphics, don't we? 
Why change? 
And this is the opportunity for WCAG to say, use SVG for vector graphics (i.e., rather than Flash) if you want to be accessible. 
It's my belief, though, that pitching it as a drop-in replacement for raster graphics before it even takes hold -- or worse, demanding it to satisfy a compliance level -- is not the best of strategies. 
Like I said earlier, I don't think six months is enough time to assume an acceptable level of absorption. 
Sure, some things move fast in the industry, but I think the inertia here, especially when it comes to new technologies, is being severely underestimated.
