<s> DOM2 doesn't appear to provide any method for determining the position of an event relative to the start of a document, when the page has been scrolled.  </s>
<s> Netscape used a pageX/YOffset property, and Mozilla is implementing this too.  </s>
<s> MSIE uses the scrollTop property.  </s>
<s> (And does anyone know what, if anything, Opera's using...?)  </s>
<s> Will/can the DOM provide a standard for accessing this basic data, because if browsers provide differing proprietory properties for this data (as is happening right now), then we've immediately lost cross-browser compatibility.  </s>

<s> A full DOM is not expected until version 5.0, so my guess would be that it is not using anything right now.  </s>

<s> DOM2 has no concept of scrolling.  </s>
<s> DOM3's "Views" chapter may address this.  </s>
