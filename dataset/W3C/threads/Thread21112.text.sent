Hello, I'm under linux rh 7.1. 
As the rpm file is not existing, I downloaded the this version in a private directory, not the /usr/local one. 
When I start amaya I have this error : [didier@mars images] amaya WARNING: cannot open file fr-libdialogue cannot find messages table Did I forgot something ?

I informed our system team but it's still not fixed. 
Yes only English dialogues and documentation are included in the binary tar file. 
You have to download and install at the same place the extra file amayadoc. 
See in http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/BinDist.html Happy new year Irene. 
On Thu, 2 Jan 2003 14:09:37 +0100 The gdk version in the redhat 7.1 is not compatible with previous versions. 
The solution is to download the rpm (but you should wait almost for Monday) or to compile it from the source. 
Irene. 
Doesn't look that way. 
I tried to compile 7.1-GTK, then used a 7.1-GTK package that someone else compiled, and in both cases, I got the exact same result when I attempt to start Amaya: Gdk-ERROR **: 86 serial 110 error_code 86 request_code 51 minor_code 0 This was under RH7.2, though, so it may be different under RH8.0. 
Haven't tried it yet, though. 
Because Amaya 7.0-GTK is still working just fine for me. 
Don't know what's going on, but it's obviously in the code that was changed between 7.0 and 7.1 Bill Hartwell Anpwhotep@confederatelinux.com MacManus Enterprises
