<s> Something like for %i in (*.*) do tidy [options] -m %i or for %i in (*.*) do tidy [options] %i  %i.new usually works for me, but it might depend on what options you want to set.  </s>
<s> I found a way to right click my *.HTML file I just wrote anywhere on my windows 98, and "send to" a batch file in the same directory as tidy.exe, and it makes files in the directory you are working in.  </s>
<s> works great, Is this what you mean?  </s>

<s> I am interested in using the features of tidy to create a single style sheet when working on a number of documents in folder.  </s>
<s> So that I may create a single linked css file.  </s>
<s> I didn't see that in the options, but seems like the next logical step.  </s>
<s> (Multiple files one style) My only other option may be to combine all the documents and then break them apart later... Sincerely, Joel E. Sapp  </s>
<s> FWIW, I think this is an excellant idea, and should be added to the enhancement list of things to work on after we have a stable release.  </s>
