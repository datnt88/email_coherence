The framework of the names for the WAI set of guidelines was determined by the Coordnation Group. 
They chose, "W3C working group chosen phrase Accessibility Guidelines." 
There was much discussion about the terms "site" and "content." 
It was felt that "site" implies server issues. 
After much discussion it was felt that the guidelines address making "content" accessible and therefore it would be appropriate to use in the title. 
However, it might not be as marketable as "site" We all agreed to send the following two choices to the list for comment: 1. W3C Web Site Accessibility Guidelines 2. W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines thoughts?

I agree with Al too. 
Content is implied and this guideline is more a foundation than the others. 
I too like W3C Web Accessibility Guidelines. 
Content and site seem clunky. 
The acronym will be very useful: WAG "Wag the Web" has a good ring to it.

Title candidate: W3C Web Accessibility Guidelines 
I agree with Al too. 
Content is implied and this guideline is more a foundation than the others. 
I still find "W3C Web Accessibility Guidelines" to be problematic, because then there is no convenient title by which to refer to all three sets of of guidelines under a single heading, as it were.
