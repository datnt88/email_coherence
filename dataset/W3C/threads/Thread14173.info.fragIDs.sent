<s> The framework of the names for the WAI set of guidelines was determined by the Coordnation Group.  </s>
<s> They chose, "W3C working group chosen phrase Accessibility Guidelines."  </s>
<s> There was much discussion about the terms "site" and "content."  </s>
<s> It was felt that "site" implies server issues.  </s>
<s> After much discussion it was felt that the guidelines address making "content" accessible and therefore it would be appropriate to use in the title.  </s>
<s> However, it might not be as marketable as "site" We all agreed to send the following two choices to the list for comment: 1. W3C Web Site Accessibility Guidelines 2. W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines thoughts?  </s>

<s> Title candidate: W3C Web Accessibility Guidelines  </s>
<s> I agree with Al too.  </s>
<s> Content is implied and this guideline is more a foundation than the others.  </s>
<s> I still find "W3C Web Accessibility Guidelines" to be problematic, because then there is no convenient title by which to refer to all three sets of of guidelines under a single heading, as it were.  </s>
