Many web pages are supported by the advertisements (ADVTS) they deliver. 
The delivered ADVTS should have ALT-text. 
Those ADVTS may be provided by a consolidator selecting from many sources. 
Possibly the particular delivered ADVTS are shaped by user actions. 
Make sure that alt-text comes along with those ADVTS. 
This request is a result of the joint UA/WG meeting 2000-05-04, where Gregory Rosmaita suggested that EO should encourage the advertising service providers to include appropriate alt-text with their ADVTS, and to require their sources of those ADVTS to provide them. 
Most ADVTS are highly visual now, and miss a significant part of their audience if those alt-text are lost, or made meaningless when the alt-text value is derived from their filenames, or is the generic "click here". 
[HB: It may also be appropriate to encourage longdesc to be delivered, in anticipation that someday browsers will support following the longdesc.]

Harvey: What a wonderful idea! 
Just to clarify, though - are you speaking of the code and images supplied by affiliate programs? 
If so, I have another item for your list. 
Please encourage them to use '&amp;amp;' instead of '&amp;', which doesn't validate and then I have to correct it, which goes against their terms and conditions (you're not supposed to modify the code they supply). 
Thanks!

unquote an excellent suggestion, harvey, especially as a lot of web advertisements contain a lot of complex material, and often resort to using animated GIFs in order to deliver the maximum amount of content in the minimal amount of physical space dictated by their advertising budget!
