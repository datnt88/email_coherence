<s> The basic reason is that it is difficult to impossible to write an algorithm that can deduce the meaning of these items from their visual appearance.  </s>
<s> Also, many times the screen reader doesn't have access to information about the structure of what is presented on the screen.  </s>
<s> For example, frames.  </s>
<s> As a sighted person, I cannot tell (by just looking at the screen) whether a web site uses frames or not.  </s>
<s> I can try to figure that out by, say, tabbing through (if my browser supports that - many don't).  </s>
<s> Or I could look at the source for the page.  </s>
<s> But screen readers don't have access to the source for the page - just the visual look of the page, and perhaps some GUI specific things like if there are multiple HWND's (in MS Windows).  </s>
<s> This is the kind of problem that Microsoft's Active Accessibility was supposed to solve - provide a way for screen readers to get information from an application.  </s>
<s> As someone who worked on that technology, I will be among the first to say that MSAA isn't a complete solution - there is a long way to go.  </s>
<s> But when you have two applications that support MSAA, it can go a long way to relieving some of these problems.  </s>
<s> Of course, when it comes to web pages, it also requires some assistance from the web page authors.  </s>
<s> MSAA in IE 5 will expose the alt text of an image to a screen reader that uses MSAA to extract that information, but the alt text must still be there, for example.  </s>
<s> Ditto for forms.  </s>
<s> When you look at a web form, you can usually tell which field labels go with which fields - but you do this by looking at lots of information - relative proximity, any repetitive features, etc. HTML4 allows an author to specify "this label labels this field" and I think that IE5 exposes that through MSAA, but again the web page author must put that information in.  </s>

<s> Mike, readers can be (and are) amde for many features.  </s>
<s> In most cases they rely on decent structure being present in the page they are trying to render, which is a constant problem.  </s>
<s> Another problem is to get such tools deployed.  </s>
<s> The User Agent Guidelines Working Group and the Evaluation and Repair Tools Working Group deal extensivley with how to read what is out there, and The Authoring Tool Guidelines Working Group deals with the question of how to get the tools that are used to put content out there to make sure that it is the sort of structured, valid content that is necessary for such readers to work.  </s>

<s> I would suggest loking at the guidelines that group has produced, and the furether work that they are looking at doing.  </s>
<s> In addition, the Education and Outreach group has worked on some alternative presentations of the guidelines - the quicktips card is one, and there are a set of slides which are designed to teach people how to apply the web content guidelines to writing web pages.  </s>

<s> In many cases, a modern reader -can- accommodate the fashionable trends in web design -- assuming that the web designer has given the screenreader or voice browser enough information to accurately represent the page.  </s>
<s> Some ways of expressing information are very graphical -- frames are a visual metaphor based on 'physical' location on a screen, for example.  </s>
<s> These are fine to use as long as you realize the limits of the method, and provide adequate compensation for those limitations.  </s>

<s> If I could, I would patent it and become amazingly rich.  </s>
<s> :) There are no approaches that can provide universal access for everyone under all conditions; all we can do is maximize the accessibility for as broad and comprehensive of an audience as we can.  </s>
<s> It is definitely useful to examine the needs of specific audience groups and see if there are techniques that can be used cross- disability in order to improve overall access; for example, being screenreader-friendly means benefits for both visually impaired users who can't see, and cognitivitely impaired users who can't read.  </s>
<s> It doesn't solve ALL problems, naturally -- there is no magic bullet -- but it's definitely a step forward so fits my personal definition of "improved accessibility."  </s>
