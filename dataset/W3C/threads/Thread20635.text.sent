Downloaded the Mandrake build 4.2.x and it crashes complaining about deprecaited png-calls. 
Must be re-compiled it says. 
Is there another build other than the on your site? 
M. I had the same problem; I imagine you have RedHat 7.0 or a distribution derived from it? 
Try the 4.1 RPM. 
The new version of the library libpng which seems to be delivered with your system is not compatible with the previous one. 
So we have to change the Amaya code to support this new version. 
Irene.
