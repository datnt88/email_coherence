<s> Now that my mind is starting to kick over and fire on more than two cylinders... Further to the ATIA discussion this morning: I think it is critical that the AT industry in general is a target for our education and outreach efforts.  </s>
<s> One way of reaching a significant portion of that very diverse group is through their industry associations.  </s>
<s> I am secretary (and web master) of the Assistive Devices Industry Association of Canada (CanADIA) and I have immediate plans to write an article (with appropriate links) about the WAI working groups.  </s>
<s> I may even be able to get something into the upcoming newsletter from Industry Canada's Assistive Devices Industry Office (which hits about 200 AT related companies or organizations).  </s>
<s> What I would like, from Jon or Judy (or anybody more familiar with DOM and XML than I) is some concise and appropriate wording that will explain the importance of these technologies to developers.  </s>
<s> By the way, two members of CanADIA are also on the board of directors of the ATIA so I also have some good contacts into that bunch.  </s>

<s> When do I need the information?  </s>
<s> The stock answer is "under my tree and wrapped for Christmas", but since that is only a few snoozes away I won't push you.  </s>
<s> If the first week of January has come and gone before I see anything, I will "ping" you (as Judy is prone to say grin ).  </s>
