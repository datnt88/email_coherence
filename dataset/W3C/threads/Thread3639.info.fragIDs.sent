<s> HI everyone, as requested, I'm posting the question i was considering doing for my next FAQ.  </s>
<s> I was thinking of doing a FAQ on "My language does not have a specific ISO-639-1 or ISO-639-2 langauge code, what language code should I use?" would this be a suitable topic?  </s>
<s> Andrew  </s>
<s> Hello Andrew, This sounds like a very good topic.  </s>
<s> We may want to tweak the end of the  </s>
<s> question to say 'how can I get a language code for this language', but that's a detail.  </s>
<s> Regards, Martin.  </s>
<s> That's an interesting question.  </s>
<s> I wonder how often it comes up.  </s>
<s> If you have some examples, that would be good.  </s>
<s> It might also be interesting to identify languages supported by Unicode that are not represented by the ISO lists (perhaps separate from the Faq).  </s>
<s> Just for my info, do you have a few examples in mind?  </s>
<s> I had a related funny moment during my locales talk at the conference last week.  </s>
<s> I had updated my presentation the day before, and during one of the opening slides I blurted out "Oh, this is the wrong version of my presentation.  </s>
<s> The reference to Klingon should say Romulan.".  </s>
<s> The crowd thought that I was being a smartass and laughed.  </s>
<s> I explained that actually my example of a language that wasn't supported by ISO and the registry used to be Klingon.  </s>
<s> However, klingon has been registered as i-klingon, so I changed the example in the slide to x-romulan.  </s>
<s> So I wasn't intentionally being funny, but really did have a mistake of using klingon instead of romulan in the slide!  </s>
<s> How's that for a humorous and perhaps first ever intergalactization Bug! ;-) tex  </s>

<s> Most african languages.  </s>
<s> Its a practical question in the sense that some of the projects we're working with at the moment include languages that fall into this category.  </s>
<s> Some of the projects we may be embarking on regarding indegenous languages.  </s>
<s> I was curious to hear that is a proposal doing the rounds for iso-639-3.  </s>

<s> Hi Martin,  </s>
<s> yes, I'm familiar with these developments.  </s>
<s> Unfortunate as they are.  </s>
<s> understandable, although my gut reaction would be to continue the faq, but considering.  </s>
<s> I'll but my thought to a new topic, and see if I can come up with something quickly.  </s>
<s> Sorry everyone for the delay.  </s>

<s> Martin, I'm not sure I understand why we should delay this FAQ.  </s>
<s> Unless you are thinking that we should delay in case language codes may fall into disuse - but that would take a long time to establish.  </s>
<s> In fact, given the publicity that is generated about language codes right now, this might be a *good* time to publish a FAQ.  </s>
<s> People searching for information about language codes may be drawn to our site.  </s>

<s> Okay, let me explain in a bit more detail.  </s>
<s> Ideally, I would like the answer (very simplified) to be: - If you have enough documents in this language (I think registration required 50 or so), request a new ISO code.  </s>
<s> - If there are not enough documents, request a IANA registration.  </s>
<s> While I very much hope that the current fee discussion will end up the right way, I just don't think it is at all a good time just now to ask people to register more codes with ISO.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, I don't want to suggest anything else, because I very much hope that the situation will turn to the better.  </s>
