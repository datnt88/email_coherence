HI everyone, as requested, I'm posting the question i was considering doing for my next FAQ. 
I was thinking of doing a FAQ on "My language does not have a specific ISO-639-1 or ISO-639-2 langauge code, what language code should I use?" would this be a suitable topic?

Hello Andrew, This sounds like a very good topic. 
We may want to tweak the end of the 
question to say 'how can I get a language code for this language', but that's a detail. 
Regards, Martin. 
That's an interesting question. 
I wonder how often it comes up. 
If you have some examples, that would be good. 
It might also be interesting to identify languages supported by Unicode that are not represented by the ISO lists (perhaps separate from the Faq). 
Just for my info, do you have a few examples in mind? 
I had a related funny moment during my locales talk at the conference last week. 
I had updated my presentation the day before, and during one of the opening slides I blurted out "Oh, this is the wrong version of my presentation. 
The reference to Klingon should say Romulan.". 
The crowd thought that I was being a smartass and laughed. 
I explained that actually my example of a language that wasn't supported by ISO and the registry used to be Klingon. 
However, klingon has been registered as i-klingon, so I changed the example in the slide to x-romulan. 
So I wasn't intentionally being funny, but really did have a mistake of using klingon instead of romulan in the slide! 
How's that for a humorous and perhaps first ever intergalactization Bug! ;-) tex

Lets see, all the indigenous australian languages for starters. 
Most african languages. 
Its a practical question in the sense that some of the projects we're working with at the moment include languages that fall into this category. 
Some of the projects we may be embarking on regarding indegenous languages. 
I was curious to hear that is a proposal doing the rounds for iso-639-3. 
etc.

Hello Andrew, Sorry that I'm backpedaling a bit. 
Maybe you have seen or heard 
about http://www.unicode.org/consortium/utc-positions.html. 
But given some recent (hopefully only potential) developments (see 
I'd prefer we would wait with this FAQ a bit until the situation will (very hopefully) clear up. 
Regards, Martin. 
Hi Martin, 
yes, I'm familiar with these developments. 
Unfortunate as they are. 
understandable, although my gut reaction would be to continue the faq, but considering. 
I'll but my thought to a new topic, and see if I can come up with something quickly. 
Sorry everyone for the delay.

Martin, I'm not sure I understand why we should delay this FAQ. 
Unless you are thinking that we should delay in case language codes may fall into disuse - but that would take a long time to establish. 
In fact, given the publicity that is generated about language codes right now, this might be a *good* time to publish a FAQ. 
People searching for information about language codes may be drawn to our site.

Okay, let me explain in a bit more detail. 
Ideally, I would like the answer (very simplified) to be: - If you have enough documents in this language (I think registration required 50 or so), request a new ISO code. 
- If there are not enough documents, request a IANA registration. 
While I very much hope that the current fee discussion will end up the right way, I just don't think it is at all a good time just now to ask people to register more codes with ISO. 
On the other hand, I don't want to suggest anything else, because I very much hope that the situation will turn to the better. 
Regards, Martin.
