<s> One more update: I marked all the editorial issues for which we are on the hook to send a meaningful closing text to xmlp-comments.  </s>
<s> Visually they should show up as orange.  </s>
<s> Marc and I committed us to send these comments before Sep 25.  </s>

<s> Thank you!  </s>
<s> Just reading Carine's email now; have you also adjusted the edlist accordingly?  </s>
<s> Jean-Jacques.  </s>
<s> During last F2F, editors took actions items that now seem disconnected from the related issues.  </s>
<s> - the first one was "make the proposed change wrt issue 192 resolution" As issue 192 was already closed, it looks strange.  </s>
<s> When i searched in the F2F IRC log, i found the following issue discussion: proposal : stick it in the Upgrade namespace anish: for consistency, why have it lowercase?  </s>
<s> original reason was to have it different from the main one proposal to close 291 is uppercase E in Env, and be it part of upgrade namespace issue close by this proposal ACTION: Editors, make the proposed change wrt issue 192 resolution ACTION: DavidF to send email to xmlp-comments to close 291 Therefore, i think this was a typo and the AI should be read: "ACTION: Editors, make the proposed change wrt issue 291 resolution" - the second one is "Make changes as in the proposal (none) - " According to the F2F IRC log, it must be about issue 323.  </s>
<s> The log says: "Editors: Issue 323 -- Make the change as in the proposal (the .../none URI)" which is close to the AI text we have now.  </s>
<s> (And it can't be about issue 322 because it was "Editors Change the spec per Henrik's proposed text for issue 322 (and track possible consequences) " in the AI list.  </s>
<s> Carine Bournez -+- W3C / INRIA Sophia-Antipolis  </s>
<s> Just did: For 192, I just closed it again.  </s>
<s> Both 322 and 323 have been resolved so we should be in good shape there Henrik  </s>
