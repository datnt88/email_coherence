Greetings: Thank you for releasing the working draft of the user agent guidelines. 
For the most part, it looks fine but it is lacking examples for those of us that aren't quite up to snuff on all the topics. 
I often found myself scratching my head thinking "just what do they mean here?" 
If each priority had an example, I think it would help clarify things. 
In addition, there seems to be a strong lack of reasons why the priorities are there. 
Are these meant to be handled in a separate document? 
If not, they should be included here. 
I sometimes found myself asking just why a particular priority was necessary, and I've been working in the accessibility field for about 8 years. 
I can only imagine what a browser developer with no experience in accessibility would think. 
Thanks again for the early look. 
My specific comments are attached below. 
Will Section 3.3: The "current user selection" and "current focus" are mentioned in the Terms and Definitions section, but I could not find a definition of them. 
Section 3.4: "D-links should be identified in the document source by giving the 'rel' attribute the value 'dlink.'" 
Will the the "dlink" link type eventually make it into the HTML specification? 
I couldn't find it in the following URL: Section 3.5: Thank you for mentioning that most of the guidelines in the document apply to 'dependent' user agents. 
This helped clarify a lot of things, and it might be helpful to mention this earlier (e.g., the abstract). 
Section 4.1: Bullet item 3. What do you mean by "custom settings in profiles that may be shared"? 
An example here might help clarify this. 
For example, what will share these settings? 
Section 4.4: I think it is good that you have a section on alternative representations of multimedia, but one thing that seems to be missing is how this is going to be done. 
Given that this type of data might be presented using a third party plug-in, there should be some standard way for the browser to tell the plug-in to do something. 
Otherwise, it seems as though these priorities will be very difficult to meet. 
Section 4.1: SUNSoft should be Sun Microsystems, Inc. Section 4.6: I understand the desire to provide better access to tables so today's screen readers can do the right thing. 
Does serialization help with this? 
Has anyone done any studies to determine that this works? 
It surely won't work for those pages where the authors use tables for the sole purpose of doing tricky visual layouts. 
Section 6.1: I think I understand the reason to be able to go from link to link and form control to form control, but what is the requirement for going from longdesc to longdesc for? 
Section 6.5: Why is source order more important than rendered order? 
Section 7.1: Bullet item 1. 
This probably should just be something like "provide the ability for the user to directly customize the configuration of the accessibility features." 
The idea of a centralized dialog box makes me think of some humongous dialog box that is difficult to use by anyone. 
Section 9.3: Since the X Window System is available on more than just Sun machines, the title should probably reflect this. 
Maybe "AccessX/The X Window System" or something like that would be more appropriate. 
Section 10.2: Sun should be referred to as Sun Microsystems, Inc. 
If you want to include a URL, http://www.sun.com/access should be fine. 
Thanks again! 
Will Look at http://www.webstandards.org/ for an example of TABLE used for layout that is accessible when linearized (seen thru lynx). 
They are defined there, but not well. 
I will improve the clarify of the definitions. 
It is likely that if this usage is "standardized" by a W3C Recommendation, this usage will be recorded in some future version of HTML. 
However, even in HTML 4.0, the listed values for rel/rev are only informative, i.e., we put the list in the specification to capture current practice. 
I'm glad this comment was useful. 
As this document evolves, I hope the distinction will be clearer and that the guidelines will be organized along this line. 
Ok. 
I believe people will be able to achieve this with SMIL (see the new W3C SMIL Recommendation). 
Ok. I'll get more feedback from the Working Group. 
I'll get clarification from the WG. 
I don't know that it's more important. 
However, it's more reliable. 
With style sheets, you can position content anywhere on the screen. 
Choosing source order means that consistent numbering is more likely. 
Of course, using the CSS style 'display:none' on a link means it won't be rendered at all, so source order doesn't ensure 100% consistency either. 
Good point. 
The guidelines attempt to be implementation-independent as much as possible. 
Ok. 
And thank you for your comments. 
I'll raise your points with the Working Group.
