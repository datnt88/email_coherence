<s> Here is my initial attempt at writing down the requirements that distributed authoring and versioning have for authentication and security.  </s>
<s> My intent here is to come to an understanding of what features we need so we can see what other technologies best provide these features.  </s>
<s> My current opinion is that this group should not concern itself with developing a new authentication or secure transmission scheme, but use the best existing technology that meets our requirements.  </s>
<s> Authentication.  </s>
<s> It should be possible to guarantee that a given HTTP message comes from a particular person.  </s>
<s> When writing a document, it is necessary to check that the person writing the document has write permission.  </s>
<s> In most access control schemes, this involves taking the name of the person and performing a lookup in an access control table or determining membership in an access control list.  </s>
<s> Checking access control permissions requires knowledge that the person requesting the action is, in fact, who they say they are.  </s>
<s> Similar problems result when performing a checkout, a checkin, or taking out a lock, which require checking for permission to perform the operation, and storing the name of the person who requested the operation.  </s>
<s> The HTTP/1.1 protocol, in section 11, "Access Authentication," provides a framework which can be used by many different authentication schemes.  </s>
<s> Secure transmission.  </s>
<s> It should be possible to write either a full or partial resource so there is a reasonable guarantee the contents will be private during transit.  </s>
<s> Transmitting a resource over the network in its native format opens up the possibility that a third party could snoop network packets and recreate the contents of the resource.  </s>
<s> This is clearly undesirable in a wide variety of contexts.  </s>
<s> There is a need to ensure that people using remote authoring can do so with reasonable confidence they are not compromising their information.  </s>
<s> ** Is this capability provided by SSL?  </s>
<s> I welcome your feedback, especially if you feel I have missed any key requirements.  </s>

<s> Almost all distributed authoring systems have some notion of the identities of the authors, whether those were organizational, individual, or based on some kind of role.  </s>
<s> Those notions differ among distributed authoring systems, each user may want to participate in several, and there's a serious problem of proliferation of identities.  </s>
<s> The use of realms and domains in HTTP authentication might not match well into a distributed authoring environment where a single user might take on multiple roles, for example.  </s>
<s> Or does it?  </s>
<s> Every system needs some kind of system administrative functions, many of which involve changing access control priviledges.  </s>
<s> These might not need to be standardized across distributed authoring applications.  </s>
<s> However, when creating new areas, establishing links, or otherwise establishing new content that has no prior history, it is  </s>
<s> often essential to be able to provide access policy information about the new object.  </s>
<s> Unfortunately, there are no good guidelines for  </s>
<s> standard access control policy languages, although PICS might have a model for some.  </s>
<s> Is the kind of individual identification that HTTP authentication provides sufficient to allow full entre into each distributed authoring environment's access control system?  </s>
<s> I think these are some of the security issues that are unique to distributed authoring.  </s>
<s> The requirements for authentication and secure transmission are well known and have already been addressed in other documents and need not be repeated.  </s>

<s> "person" is probably too, ah, personal.  </s>
<s> Some term that embodies the notion of an automated process (eg., "drone", aka "manager".  </s>
<s> No, no! Don't use that one!  </s>
<s> :-) would probably be more accurate.  </s>
<s> Servers need to be authenticated too, and having them masquerade as a "person" is a bit contrived.  </s>
<s> There are (at least) three areas of concern (as enumerated above): Authentication, authorization and privacy.  </s>
<s> SSL's current strengths are authentication and privacy during transmission.  </s>
<s> The authentication phase is done (as *everone* knows) with certificates.  </s>
<s> Certificates do have fields that uniquely identify the holder of the certificate, but that identity does not readily map to an identity that is acceptable by popular operating environments.  </s>
<s> Using HTTP's Access Authentication to establish authorization is doable, but one must be careful about the association between the identity established using a certificate and the identity being presented in the HTTP protocol.  </s>
<s> There is an effort in progress within in SSL/TSL world to add "attribute certificates" to address the fine grain access control issues.  </s>
<s> The schedule for availability of that feature may make it inappropriate for this forum, though we (Netscape and I) believe that it is the right strategic solution.  </s>

<s> Along with authentication, authorization and privacy, one might want to include non-repudiation as a requirement for authoring.  </s>
<s> Non-repudiation would be a handy capability for any type of collabortive efforts or submission/modification of sensitive data.  </s>
<s> It needs to be tied closely with strong authentication.  </s>
<s> To the best of my knowledge (which is always suspect) there is no one dealing with this issue in a commercial product today.  </s>
<s> If there is some work going on out there, perhaps we could look at it for input.  </s>
<s> And then .... On the subject of idempotency.  </s>
<s> I'm concerned that people are compromising the definition of idempotency to fit what they think can be easily implemented.  </s>
<s> My understanding of the term is that an idempotent operation can be repeated any number of times and the result is the same.  </s>
<s> A common example of an idempotent operation is a directory lookup.  </s>
<s> Even with this apparently safe example, it's clear that the operation is not idempotent over all space and TIME.  </s>
<s> However, the example is normally accepted.  </s>
<s> Another example of an idempotent operation is a file (or object or container or whatever) DELETE.  </s>
<s> This example gives me some concern.  </s>
<s> It seems as though the proof of idemptency is based on the following scenerio: handle = Enumerate(object); (void)Delete(handle); handle = Enumerate(object); If the final assigned value of 'handle' is null (implying no such object).  </s>
<s> This is the desired state after a 'delete' operation, so all is well.  </s>
<s> Observation would also note that the final value of 'handle' in the following sequence is also null.  </s>
<s> Some would argue that this proves the 'delete' operation is therefore idempotent.  </s>
<s> handle = Enumerate(object); (void)Delete(handle); (void)Delete(handle); (void)Delete(handle); (void)Delete(handle); handle = Enumerate(object); This is observing the result, but ignoring the cause.  </s>
<s> What's missing is the status of completion of the 'delete' operation.  </s>
<s> There is and should be an important distinction between a delete that completes with 'success' verses a delete the completes with a status of 'invalid handle'.  </s>
<s> There are two possible reasons for the latter case: Another process deleted the object after the 'Enumerate' was called.  </s>
<s> This could be a access violation, and non- repudiation (should it be enabled for deletes) would provide information regarding who actually deleted the object.  </s>
<s> Or The protocol does not have "at most once exection" semantics.  </s>
<s> Without such sematics, one will have great difficulty creating anything but idempotent protocols.  </s>
<s> Of course, that's how the definition of idempotent got compromised in the first place, isn't it?  </s>
<s> I believe useful idempotent networking protocols do not exist.  </s>
<s> Continuing to believe they do and trying to design processes to take advantage of idempotency is fruitless.  </s>
<s> The real goal is to control cache coherency; can the sending of the object across the network be suppressed and a more local copy offered instead.  </s>
