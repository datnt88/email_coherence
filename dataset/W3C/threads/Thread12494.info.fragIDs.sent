Hello, On today's AU teleconference there was general agreement to hold our next AU Face-to-Face meeting at the end of the CSUN conference in Los Angeles: In the past, one and a half days has proven to be a reasonable amount of time for these meetings. 
Those on the call agreed that Saturday (22 March 2003) was most convenient for a full day meeting. 
This means we could hold the further half day meeting on either Friday (AM or PM) or on Sunday (AM or PM). 
Please let us know your preference, as soon as possible, for the half day meeting: __ Friday AM __ Friday PM __ Sunday AM __ Sunday PM Cheers, Jan Jan Richards, User Interface Design Specialist Adaptive Technology Resource Centre (ATRC), University of Toronto Web: http://ultrajuan.ic.utoronto.ca/jan/richards.html 
Sorry I missed the call where you decided on the F2F jt: Better to hold meeting before or after CSUN? js: After lng: After AGREED: Next face-to-face meeting at CSUN March 22, plus a half day either Friday or Sunday.

I will not be able to attend the CSUN meeting unfortunately, but I will be in Cambridge for the W3C technical plenary all week and hope to see many of you there. 
BTW, NIST could host a face-fo-face meeting of the WAI-AUWG later this year, if the working group members would want. 
If there is consensus interest from the WG, just let me know some dates and I'll see about reserving a room. 
Best wishes, Tim Boland NIST 
So as not to conflict with CSUN sessions on Friday, or the WAI IG meeting on Saturday afternoon, we propose that the March 2003 F2F be held on: Sunday (23 March 2003): 8:30 to 16:00 PST At: Los Angeles Airport Marriott (LAX Marriott) in Los Angeles, CA In addition, we would also like to schedule an AUWG working dinner on Saturday evening (22 March 2003). 
If any Participant in Good Standing (http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/members) objects to this meeting, please respond no later than Tuesday, 4 February 2003. 
If no objections arise by that date, an agenda and registration instructions will be sent to the list. 
We would also like to schedule a brief presentation on the work of the AUWG at the WAI-IG meeting, which is scheduled for Saturday (22 March 2003) from 14:30-18:00.
