Hi, It's nice to see progress on the Time text spec's, I feel there is a missed opportunity to make Timed text more than a captioning format, not that captioning isn't important. 
If TT also could provide fading in and out, the text can be used like an image or sound in presentation, it can be another expressive media element. 
This is an previously posted example from the old TT mailing list: (HTML+SMIL for IE 6, about a minute long and 1MB, preloaded) Now the same presentation without fading: If linking were added, Timed text can be used to jump to other parts of the document or any other resource on the web. 
It would be a real web language, without the 'A' element it's a neutered language. 
Good luck all, Jose Ramirez I agree it is worth considering fade transitions. 
I have received input from a number of sources that have suggested this as a requirement as well. 
Regards, Glenn Now the same presentation without fading: If linking were added, Timed text can be used to jump to other parts of the document or any other resource on the web.

Good luck all, Jose Ramirez It would be great to see fade in &amp; out become a requirement :) Text in multimedia shouldn't take a back seat to audio and images. 
Simply by allowing text to fade in and out of a piece, give TT a chance to become a part of the presentation instead of an add on, like a bumper sticker to a car. 
I see linking also as being an essential feature. 
With 'A' TT can be used as a table of contents of a multimedia document, TT can supply links to a MMS version or larger version of the same content for a digital home entertainment system. 
Linking give a small language the power to access Web. 
Thanks for replying Glenn. 
Take care, Jose Ramirez We have already agreed that hyperlink behavior is a requirement.
