<s> I have received the following request for assistance from someone working with LD students.  </s>
<s> Can anyone help with some suggested strategies or direct me to applications that will achieve this required outcome?  </s>
<s> We have a paper-based eval form, which we would like to use online.  </s>
<s> I have experience with HTML forms, but what is desired is that if the respondent, for example, answers ?yes? to question 23, question 24 will appear, but question 25 will not, and question 26 will follow question 24.  </s>
<s> Likewise, if the respondent answers ?no? to question 23, question 24 will not be displayed, but the form will continue with question 25.  </s>
<s> It gets ?worse?, or more complicated, when the respondent answers a question and may skip an entire section of questions.  </s>
<s> Any suggestions/help would be greatly appreciated Thanks Jeff Dr Denise L Wood Lecturer: Professional Development (online teaching and learning) and EASI online instructor University of South Australia CE Campus, North Terrace, Adelaide SA 5000 Ph: (61 8) 8302 2167 Mob: (0413 648 260) WWW: http://www.unisanet.unisa.edu.au/staff/homepage.asp?Name=Denise.Wood and at EASI: http://easi.cc/workshops/advwbsyl.htm Download the free Opera browser at http://www.opera.com/  </s>
