here's an url for the pdf article wouldn't ya know it would be in pdf. 
Great. 
Not only that, but the article fails to import into Access Adobe (http://access.adobe.com/simple_form.html)! 
Even more damaging is that the article does not articulate current problems with PDF, and goes as far as to clearly imply that all PDF is accessible and that all difficulties have been neatly resolved. 
I quote: 
In the past, PDF (portable document format) files presented problems for visually-impaired users because screen readers couldn't decipher them. 
I have not tried the new 4.0 Access plug-in tool for Acrobat Reader. 
How well does it work in general? 
How well does it work with this article in particular? 
I was relieved that the article did include text (as opposed to the infamous and common "picture of text" only). 
The document is set with "Selecting Text and Graphics: Not Allowed" so quoting from the article, is annoying to say the least. 
I should think this would also interfere with Screen Readers as one can put the system text cursor into the body of the document. 
I assume that the access plug-in takes care of this though. 
Still, this option is a great disservice to all readers. 
The article does mention the WCAG (by URL, but not by name). 
For those that this might help, you can find the link to the article at URL: I think this may helpful, because my understanding is that the Access plug-in does not work if the PDF file is brought up inside a browser window. 
In any case, the browsers "Find on this page" feature is disabled for PDF files, although the (inaccessible 'cause it is mouse-only) Acrobat search command in the Reader toolbar works.

aloha! i've used the Adobe Access Plugin for the Adobe Acrobat Reader 4.0 to convert the PDF document dave cited into plain text, using Acrobat 4.0 and the access plug in... you can view the rather uneven results at the following URL: NOTE: the access plugin apparently has some difficulty with the font used in the original PDF document, as it was unable to process double effs (that is, words that contain the letter f twice consecutively) or an f followed by an i... for example, the word "effect" is converted to "e ects" (that is, e space e c t s), while the word "benefit" was converted to "bene t" (that is, b e n e space t) overall, the conversion produced something comprehensible--i just wouldn't want to use it to obtain any information (such as tax forms, etc.) in which clarity and accuracy were of the essence gregory.

Just so folks are aware, you can't email the URL of that article to pdf2txt@adobe.com and get it converted either. 
I had to back track to I wish Adobe had the guts to link a converted version of the article to their text proclaiming Adobe access solutions as this great solution. 
The article is readable but letters are missing all over the place and the organization is sometimes confusing. 
The article also has some points that make absolutely no sense. 
It defines access technology and then states: For the vision impaired, an increasing portion of the Web is composed of sites that can be experienced only with access software. 
What the heck does this mean? 
Is the author contending in the past that I could just cruise up to any old computer and access the web without a screen reader or screen enlarger loaded? 
As an example of confusing presentation, part of the article reads as follows: For the vision impaired, an increasing portion of the Web is composed of sites that can be experienced only with access software. 
In its early days, HTML was used primarily to format text. 
Sighted and visually impaired users who relied on voice-synthesized screen readers were on relatively equal footings when it came effects, users who depend on audio and text browsers can't take in the message you're trying to convey unless you provide some alternate form of access. 
So how best to design sites for the blind and visually impaired? 
Well one solution is to stay away from, or provide alternatives to, PDF files. 
Finally the article doesn't even accurately explain some of the conversion options for getting text from a PDF file. 
It explains the service offered by the Trace R&amp;D Center where one can email a PDF file to pdf2txt@sun.trace.wisc.edu as an attachment to a message and get back the conversion as follows: Another e-mail option for non-Web-based documents comes from Trace Research Center in Wis-consin (http:// trace. 
wisc. 
edu), which offers a tool that attaches a PDF file to e-mail for conversion. 
So is the Trace Center now sending out PDF files and asking people to convert them? 
Obviously not but that's what this makes it sound like. 
Further, visiting doesn't produce any references to the conversion service that I could find. 
I even tried searching on the phrases "convert pdf" and just "pdf". 
I'm not saying something negative about Trace. 
An author should ensure that references accurately describe what the author's talking about when pointing people to them, as well as accurately explaining how the service works.

Why are folks writing to IG about this, why not to Adobe? 
With their statements, one might think they would be interested?
