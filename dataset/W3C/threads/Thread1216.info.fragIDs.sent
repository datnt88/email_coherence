Could you give the complete title of the ISO publication, please? 
I think it's "ISO/IEC 8859-13:1998 Information technology -- 8-bit single-byte coded graphic character sets -- Part 13: Latin alphabet No. 7", according to www.iso.ch, but it's important to get right (in theory, you might have been thinking of another version of the spec than the 1998 one). 
Apart from that, I think this registration is good.
