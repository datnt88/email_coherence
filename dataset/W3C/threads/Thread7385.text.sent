At IETF 42, the question was raised: What is the rationale for allowing only one change to an ordering per ORDERPATCH request? 
I believe that the rationale for this decision was that there may be existing DMSs that support only single changes per request, and that we should not require them to change in order to be compliant with the Ordering part of the Advanced Collections specification. 
We can certainly change this position if the consensus of the group is that it is too restrictive. 
An intermediate position might be that we define the ORDERPATCH request to support multiple changes per request, but don't require servers to accept requests with more than one change.

8*222-5169 That these systems don't natively support multiple order changes per request isn't necessarily sufficient reason to prevent multiple requests from being submitted in an ORDERPATCH. 
Since the semantics of ORDERPATCH are being implemented by some DAV layer, rather than directly by the document management system, it is quite possible that the DAV layer could implement multiple order changes per ORDERPATCH even if the document management system can't perform this functionality in a single operation. 
In fact, since WebDAV servers support locking a collection (to implement LOCK), a DAV layer could lock the collection, then perform multiple individual order change operations, then unlock the collection. 
It might be difficult to implement all-or-nothing semantics with this approach (i.e., perform all these order changes or perform none of the order changes), which is why I suggest making the semantics best effort. 
- Jim Right--and (IMHO) this would be much better than forcing the clients to do it instead. 
The server can fake it more efficiently than the client can (if the client has to issue one ORDERPATCH per change), and some servers won't have to fake it at all.
