Attached is a small patch which changes the generation of Postscript DSC Page comments to prevent an extraneous one at the end of the document, which could confuse programs such as gv. 
Is there any established procedure for contributing patches like this? 
I notice that there are other issues with the DSC comments, most importantly that Amaya does not generate version 3.0 comments. 
I might look at some more of these. 
Brian Campbell Sigh, and this time I might actually attach it... Hy Brian, I integrated your patches. 
Thanks a lot for your contribution. 
Irene.
