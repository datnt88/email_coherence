Hi, the specification is a bit unclear on what we are supposed to return in the case that a MOVE cannot be completed because request URL and destination URL are on different servers or are on different subnamespaces on a single server. 
I would expect some return value that signals to the client that the URLs are on different "drives". 
The client could then try to implement the MOVE logic on the client side (eg using PUT to dest then DELETE in src). 
Any suggestions? 
Thanks, Helge OpenGroupware.orghttp://www.opengroupware.org/ 
Right now, RFC2518 allows both -- rejecting the request, or doing a "best effort" approach on the server. 
The BIND draft ( http://wwww.webdav.org/bind ) clarifies that a client that really wants to move resources (keeping all live properties and resource-ids) can do a REBIND method call that is guaranteed to fail if a "real" move operation is impossible. 
If a server wants to reject MOVE, that's certainly possible although existing clients may not be handling this very well. 
A 403 (Forbidden) seems to be the right status code in this case. 
It would be nice if there'd also be a precondition code for this case (Geoff, could we add that to BIND as additional MOVE semantics?). 
Regards, Julian I'm not sure what the benefit would be of this additional error code for MOVE. 
If the client wants to try COPY/DELETE as an alternative to MOVE, then it should do so. 
I don't see that the clients decision to do so would be affected by a special error code here.

So I would assume (without having thought through everything, I have to admit), that a code which signals the client why it couldn't perform the operation would be quite useful (something like out-of-the-namespace-I-process). 
With the Forbidden code we do not know whether the request was rejected because of access restrictions or just because it is located on a different server, right? 
Note that I'm assuming that a server is usually "dumb" and will not try to act as a proxy with regards to the other namespace (if it does we do have the 502 code to detect errors, if I remember right). 
Doesn't make sense?

You may want to sniff glue for a while, then reread this when you get out of rehab. 
[aLa] There are 3 obvious alternatives to move one set of resources to another location: - MOVE (cheap, least likely to work) - COPY/DELETE (more expensive, more likely to work) - PUT*/DELETE (most expensive, most likely to work) So a client that cares about efficiency will try these three methods in the above order, until one succeeds. 
So what use would it be for a server to say "out of the namespace I process"? 
The client will try the next method in either case. 
So is there anything that a server can do to expedite this sequence? 
The only thing I can think of is to have the server have a special error code for MOVE that says "don't try to fake MOVE with COPY or PUT*, because I know those will also fail" and a special code for COPY that says "don't try to fake copy with PUT*, because I know that will also fail". 
But I think the likelihood that the MOVE or COPY implementation will know this is small, and the benefit of skipping those attempts is also small, so the overall benefit is very small.

If the client has no read access to the resource to be moved (access is 403 Forbidden!), it doesn't make sense to continue?! On the other side you are right, the client will find out about that in the last option, GET - if this returns Forbidden, we know that it is really an access issue. 
Well, if the server says that access to the resource is forbidden, I as the client, would not try the next method. 
Well, this is 403 (Access) Forbidden ;-) Using that access status code to signal some technically completely different issue (the resource cannot be moved on the server side due to operational restrictions) seems a bit weird to me. 
But if I'm supposed to do it that way, I do. 
BTW: another status which might be somewhat appropriate from the semantics is 501, Not Implemented. 
But this probably implies in the client that the whole method is not implemented which isn't what we want either. 
Well, I think that this is the common case. 
MOVE will usually map the URI to some internal storage URL, eg /publicstorage/image.gif to mod_dav /image.gif /dynamicservice/GroupwareFolder/ to servlet /GroupwareFolder and this mapping process will know whether source and target are going to be processed by the same service. 
Anyway, no intention to start a huge discussion on that. 
If there is no other way, I simply return 403 - I just wanted to make sure that I'm not missing something in the WebDAV spec.

[aLa] I thought the 502 Bad Gateway error was appropriate whenever it's another server, another namespace, or another domain that can't be copied to. 
It's a fuzzy continuum, after all: - One physical machine may be able to copy to another physical machine if they're in the same security domain and the software supports it. 
Thus, docs1.example.com 
and docs2.example.com 
might allow MOVE between them. 
If not, however, 502 Bad Gateway is appropriate. 
- Two domains might be hosted on the same physical machine. 
Thus if docs.bettysbagels.com and docs.joesjava.com 
are both hosted by the same service provider using the same server software, using virtual servers, a MOVE between them might be allowed. 
If it's not allowed, however, 502 Bad Gateway is appropriate. 
- Within one domain, two top-level directories might actually be mounted from different locations (different file storage servers?), and *not* allow move between. 
E.g. docs.example.com/nfs-mount1 
and docs.example.com/cifs-mount8 
might not support MOVE between them. 
I think this sufficiently meets the definition of "gateway" to make 502 Bad Gateway is still appropriate.
