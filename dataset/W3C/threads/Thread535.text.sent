To Dave Raggett Hi, My name is Adrian. 
A month or so ago I downloaded 1st page 2000 and I have been using it as my primary web development tool. 
I realise that this may turn out to be an error on my part but I believe their may be a small bug in the "tidy format and fix option" The following anchor seems to be problematic. 
(It was generated originally by 1st page but I edited it in order to get it to work because the original tag was also causing errors): a href="pics.zip" 
onmouseover="window.status='From Jacs Photo Album!!!'; return true;" onmouseout="window.status=''; 
return true;" Amata /a (you can see it in use at: When the tidy option is applied the following changes are made: a href="pics.zip" 
onmouseover="window.status=From Jacs Photo Album!!!; return true;" onmouseout="window.status=; 
return true;" Amata /a The removal of these apostrophes brings up a "syntax error" message for char 15 and a "script error" message (expected ';'). 
I have also had several other problems of this nature with anchor tags. 
Thank you (by the way apart from this small glitch the software is decidedly cool) Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp 
I'm not Dave, but I will answer your question. 
The base Tidy code of 04 Aug 00 or later does not appear to have this problem (at least when I tested it on my platform). 
I don't know what version of Tidy is integrated into 1st Page 2000 (I wasn't able to discern this info from Evrsoft's web site), but I suspect they might be using an older version of the Tidy code. 
I suggest you contact Evrsoft directly. 
Hope this helps. 
Regards, Terry Hello, 1stPage2000 installs Tidy in the subdirectory "Tidy" of its program directory. 
I replaced that tidy.exe with the 4.Aug.2000 
version and after that many problems were solved. 
1stPage2000 installs an older version.
