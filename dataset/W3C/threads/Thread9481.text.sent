Issue [Equivalence]: There are four RDF model "flavours" (formal/data model, graph(ical) model, serialization syntax, triple). 
To what extend (precisely) are these models (not) equivalent? 
(Problems related to anonymity have been discussed, see also below, details need to be summarized). 
Could trying to find transformation grammars be a solution (preciseness, determination of equivalence)? 
Shouldn't this be in a "formal" part of M&amp;S spec? 
Propose that o The WG believes that: - the graph model which is the basis for the model theory - the n-Triples representation of an RDF graph - the diagrams of graphs used in documents such as the RDF Model and Syntax document are all equivalent. 
o The WG notes that the RDF/XML syntax as currently defined is unable to represent an arbritary RDF graph. 
In particular, the RDF/XML syntax cannot fully represent a bNode which is the object of more than one statement. 
o The WG believes that extending the RDF/XML syntax so that it can respresent all RDF graphs is beyond the scope of its current charter and resolves to postpone consideration of this issue. 
o The WG actions the editor of the RDF Syntax WD to include in that document a clear statement of the RDF graph structures that RDF/XML is unable to represent. 
Brian My only concern is that some of the datatyping schemes might need something like Ntriples++ to describe the graphs they use, and I would like to leave that option open until we get these issues decided. 
Otherwise, OK. IHMC(850)434 8903 home 40 South Alcaniz St.(850)202 4416 office phayes@ai.uwf.edu 
Hi Pat, Good point. 
My take is that they are equivalent now and we are committed to keeping them equivalent, so it would be ok to close it given that. 
It would be hard to argue its urgent to close this, I'm just trying to get some issues closed off in parallel with working on the biggies. 
How about: o The WG believes that: - the graph model which is the basis for the model theory - the n-Triples representation of an RDF graph - the diagrams of graphs used in documents such as the RDF Model and Syntax document are currently all equivalent and the WG is resolves to maintain that equivalence. 
Brian Sorry Brian, I know you're trying to simplify life but ... I have to date agreed with this, but .... 
I'm wavering. 
I'm wavering for three reasons: + with a developer hat on, a developer who controls both an RDF/XML reader and an RDF/XML writer I note that I have a *responsiblity* to my users to fix this problem, at least between my writer and my reader. 
With WG hat on, maybe I can duck that responsibility, but I, at least, need to have a solution; even if it doesn't have WG blessing. 
+ this is really a bug, a significant bug, not just an academic bug, a bug with the spec. 
I think it is in charter to fix bugs. 
+ there are a number of adequate fixes with adequate backwardly compatible behaviour. 
Viz - a. mandate that all fragment URIs of a particular URI are in fact bNode's and not real URIs e.g. http://www.w3.org/2001/11/rdf/bnode#b1 b. suggest use of processing instruction e.g. ?rdf-fake-uri 
http://www.w3.org/2001/11/rdf/bnode? c. use of new attribute rdf:local Anyone care to push me over the edge? 
Jeremy I'm not going to push one way or the other; I understand the attraction of fixing this, but I also understand the charter has a purpose. 
BUT, if we do decide to fix this, I don't like solution (a) or (b). 
However, something like: rdf:Description rdf:local="node" ... seems quite regular and OK. 
Also, it suggests, if needed: rdf:Description rdf:local="node" rdf:literal="literalchars" ... #g Graham Klyne MIMEsweeper Group Strategic Research http://www.mimesweeper.com
