<s> On Behalf Of Lisa Seeman Sent: Wednesday, August 21, 2002 4:09 PM Subject: Proposed 4.1 wording for discussion and new proposal I very much liked the simplification of Checkpoint 4.1 to "Use plain language" I think it implies all the considerations that we had in wording this checkpoint.  </s>
<s> If using simpler word has changed the meaning of the sentence then you are not using plain language, but rubbish (be it simple rubbish).  </s>
<s> Plain language implies some ((un)common since.  </s>
<s> In terms of the success criteria, the list is still incomplete as we are aweighting the complete list from Ben, But its layout is interesting.  </s>
<s> It does not follow the formulary for success criteria that we have been working on at all.  </s>
<s> But does follow the spirit of the success criteria so eloquently described by Jason - who I will now attempt to misquote.... Level one implies they you have attempted to address these issues, some what.  </s>
<s> Level two is were you have taken it to a further level, and level three is were you have done everything you could do.  </s>
<s> (sorry Jason, I just do not have your eloquence) Other then that I have (of course) problems with the wording of the both the list and the success criteria.  </s>
<s> But the approach is an interesting one.  </s>
<s> I would make the levels at (this is the new proposal bit) : success criteria level one: Adopting consistently (Implementing ) a quarter of the elements listed below, success criteria level two: Implementing half elements listed below, success criteria level three : Implementing all the elements listed bellow ( the whole thing) OR a format/extra information that allowed automatic and correct conversion to plain language (yup - ILS).  </s>
<s> Then we need only include in the list testable criteria, but with no concern for appropriateness.  </s>
<s> The beauty of this approach is that on every page you can find 1/4 plain language ideas that work and are suitable, even if any one by themselves can not be applied across the board.  </s>
<s> If this is not the case, then 1/4 is too high and we make lower - until we get something workable.  </s>
<s> Flexible, robust and enduring...  </s>

<s> Simplistics dictates an erosion of the etherial pundits with the brevity of natural language can be written in the simple terms of "brevity of expert thoughts are more easily understood."  </s>
<s> However, if we simply say "plain language" we are leaving out those whose languages are not so plain.  </s>
<s> I believe Lisa has been dealing with this issue with the Hebrew language and has pointed out that sometimes "plain language" leaves the reader wondering what was actually expressed.  </s>
<s> Yet, "easily understood" removes the concept of "plain" while keeping the text in a realm of understandability.  </s>
<s> It also leaves room for the expert text and thoughts to be understood by the apprentice and sometimes the novice.  </s>
<s> That's the reason legal and scientific documents are more often written in language not so easily understood (or rather, let's not show the  </s>
<s> novice how to understand our languages and keep them in the dark).  </s>
<s> This also reminds me of the days when the King James Bible was written for the elite to understand and therefore keep it from the common people.  </s>
