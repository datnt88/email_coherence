wording ...] I was thinking that perhaps instead of "plain language" we use "easily understood language". 
This would remove the connotation that "it's only plain English". 
"Easily understood language" would meet the requirements of any language and is also "easily" translated by machine translators. 
Just my two-cents.

Hmmmmm I think using a term like "plain language" to mean more than language (that is, including structure, formatting, illustration and all other things that can be used to make writing easier to understand). 
"plain language" may be a term of art in some field, but I would think we might chose a term that translates more directly from the words used to the meaning we intend. 
I don't think we're going to find anything better. 
In plain English the term for what we wish to connote is "plain English." 
This fails the W3C ethical guideline "insofar as possible avoid the appearance of bias with regard to language and national origin." 
As close to "plain English" as we can come in politically correct English is "plain language." 
I don't see us coming up with another way of saying this briefly which is both - as clear from a base in the most commonly used subset of English - sufficiently language-group neutral Al PS: For a term that applies across media an includes the expository-structure idioms of genres (such as title-bar at the top, navbar on the left in LTR languages) as well as language structures, use "vernacular idiom." 
But this concept, understood that broadly, is exotic. 
This broad notion does not exist in the vernacular base of commonly understood notions. 
Its OK to use highfalutin' language for this idea, because it is an advanced concept to begin with. 
PPS: Hypertext is a medium. 
Web portal is a medium. 
Web Store (Amazon) is a genre, as is "community hub" (slashdot). 
Idioms for page organization exist at the level of site similarity group where you do similar things there.

On Behalf Of Lisa Seeman Sent: Wednesday, August 21, 2002 4:09 PM Subject: Proposed 4.1 wording for discussion and new proposal I very much liked the simplification of Checkpoint 4.1 to "Use plain language" I think it implies all the considerations that we had in wording this checkpoint. 
If using simpler word has changed the meaning of the sentence then you are not using plain language, but rubbish (be it simple rubbish). 
Plain language implies some ((un)common since. 
In terms of the success criteria, the list is still incomplete as we are aweighting the complete list from Ben, But its layout is interesting. 
It does not follow the formulary for success criteria that we have been working on at all. 
But does follow the spirit of the success criteria so eloquently described by Jason - who I will now attempt to misquote.... Level one implies they you have attempted to address these issues, some what. 
Level two is were you have taken it to a further level, and level three is were you have done everything you could do. 
(sorry Jason, I just do not have your eloquence) Other then that I have (of course) problems with the wording of the both the list and the success criteria. 
But the approach is an interesting one. 
I would make the levels at (this is the new proposal bit) : success criteria level one: Adopting consistently (Implementing ) a quarter of the elements listed below, success criteria level two: Implementing half elements listed below, success criteria level three : Implementing all the elements listed bellow ( the whole thing) OR a format/extra information that allowed automatic and correct conversion to plain language (yup - ILS). 
Then we need only include in the list testable criteria, but with no concern for appropriateness. 
The beauty of this approach is that on every page you can find 1/4 plain language ideas that work and are suitable, even if any one by themselves can not be applied across the board. 
If this is not the case, then 1/4 is too high and we make lower - until we get something workable. 
Flexible, robust and enduring...

What I have written incorporates ideas that Bengt, Lisa (by phone) and I discussed at the Linz f2f. 
It also incorporates some wording from the current draft of 2.0. 
And it attempts to deal with concerns raised during telecons. 
I await comments and suggestions. 
As we say in American slang, bring it on!

Simplistics dictates an erosion of the etherial pundits with the brevity of natural language can be written in the simple terms of "brevity of expert thoughts are more easily understood." 
However, if we simply say "plain language" we are leaving out those whose languages are not so plain. 
I believe Lisa has been dealing with this issue with the Hebrew language and has pointed out that sometimes "plain language" leaves the reader wondering what was actually expressed. 
Yet, "easily understood" removes the concept of "plain" while keeping the text in a realm of understandability. 
It also leaves room for the expert text and thoughts to be understood by the apprentice and sometimes the novice. 
That's the reason legal and scientific documents are more often written in language not so easily understood (or rather, let's not show the 
novice how to understand our languages and keep them in the dark). 
This also reminds me of the days when the King James Bible was written for the elite to understand and therefore keep it from the common people.

Actually I like "easily understood" as much as I do plain language. 
The first is simple to translate, which is a helpful guide. 
I was not aware that we had consensus on the decision to assume that 4.1 covers presentation methods, structure of content etc. 
I think that is a bad idea for the reasons I outlined earlier - the implementation and testing strategies are very different.
