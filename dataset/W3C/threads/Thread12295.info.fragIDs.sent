<s> Folks, the question of renewing our teleconference booking has come up again.  </s>
<s> The current time will eventually become 6am thursday morning for me, which I will find difficult.  </s>
<s> However, for most of the next quarter I will be in Europe or the US (I think) so it is not an urgent question.  </s>
<s> If you have a suggestion for another time, please put it to the mailing list (there is not much point discussing this on a teleconference, since it is most likely to exclude people who are already excluded).  </s>
<s> My personal preference would be to move the meeting to thursday, around noon Boston time, which is around 6pm in western Europe and 9am on the US west coast.  </s>
<s> Although that is a terrible time of night in Melbourne I am already  </s>
<s> committed to other guidelines meetings through that night, and at least it groups them together.  </s>
<s> If anyone else out there in the Asia/Pacific time zones wants to participate, better say something.  </s>
<s> Unless there is an outcry I will renew the current time until the end of May, and look at the new time taking effect from June.  </s>
