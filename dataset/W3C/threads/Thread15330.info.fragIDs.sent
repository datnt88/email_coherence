<s> Hello Roberto, It is not a mistake.  </s>
<s> We removed it for the following reasons: 1. WCAG 2.0 was the only reference in that section.  </s>
<s> 2. There were several places in the document where we directly linked to an  </s>
<s> external resource.  </s>
<s> WCAG 2.0 was the only one that we had an indirect link to (i.e., instead of linking directly to WCAG 2.0 in the text, we linked to a target in the references section and then the target linked to the external WCAG 2.0 resource).  </s>
<s> Instead, we now directly link to all of the resources throughout the document.  </s>
<s> Is this an issue that you feel needs to be fixed?  </s>
<s> If so, does it need to be fixed before moving to TR? Thanks, --wendy  </s>

<s> At point 3.4 the title is: Relation to WCAG and in the document there is not a reference about what is WCAG.  </s>
<s> I think that for make more "clear" the documentation, we need to make these  </s>
<s> two changes: 1) add the (WCAG 2.0) near the first phrase so there is officially a "reference" to the acronym used in the text): The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 (WCAG 2.0) creates a technology-independent set of Web accessibility guidelines by providing a set of high-level guidelines, and providing technology-specific information  </s>
<s> in auxiliary documents that are more frequently updated and may be non-normative.  </s>
<s> 2) change the text where is wrote WCAG into WCAG 2.0: a) introduction, at third paragraph: Developers of non-W3C technologies may use the schema to publish their own techniques documents that show how to use their technologies to conform to WCAG 2.0.  </s>
<s> b) title in 3.4 with the follow title: Relation to WCAG 2.0 c) First point in 3.4: Each technique must map to a specific WCAG 2.0 Success Criterion or Additional Idea by URI and number for clarity and to enable auto generation  </s>
<s> of hybrid Guidelines/Techniques documents.  </s>
