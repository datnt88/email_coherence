<s> Hi, I was just wandering why we get so many junk mail to this list?  </s>
<s> Is noone else anoid, or has everybody done something about this?  </s>
<s> This is rediculous!  </s>
<s> I guess I will be unsubscribing soon, if this does not improve.  </s>
<s> Regards Arsaell arsaell@a.sol.no  </s>
<s> I agree.  </s>
<s> There has to be something the list administrators can do about the spam.  </s>
<s> I haven't even been able to delete one of the messages from  </s>
<s> this weekend for some reason.  </s>
<s> If enough of us "complain" about the junk to the senders, maybe we can flood their mailboxes and "discourage" further messages.  </s>
<s> They usually provide a separate email address where  </s>
<s> they receive legitimate replies which is different than the faked "From" address.  </s>
<s> Sarah sarah@russellisland.net  </s>
<s> [I'm sorry for this off topic message, but I think it is an important question]  </s>
<s> The mailinglist is unmoderated, so right now it isn't possible to stop the spam (At least That is what Gerald told me!).  </s>
<s> I urge everyone concerned to mail w3 and tell them that these UCE:s annoys you and that w3 should _rapidly_ do something about this probem.  </s>
<s> You can mail Gerald Oskoboiny, gerald@w3.org  </s>
<s> , he is the postmaster at w3.  </s>
<s> The appropriate thing to do is to write a mail and complain to their domain postmaster.  </s>
<s> Do not flood anyone, that is just as bad as them spamming us in the first place.  </s>
<s> Very often the emails in the spam are fake and do not work or goes to someone who is innocent.  </s>
<s> I have nothing to do whith w3 (other than that i translate html4-docs to swedish :) so do not mail me about the UCE.  </s>
<s> I don't want to discuss this problem on the list (as it is _very_ off topic).  </s>
<s> But if you have any questions about this mail, i'll be glad to responce privately by email.  </s>
<s> Regards Fredrik Jonson pt97fjo@student.hk-r.se  </s>
<s> Dear Translators, I am really sorry you are being bothered by spam messages.  </s>
<s> The w3c-translators@w3.org list up to a few weeks ago was only open to people subscribed to the list.  </s>
<s> However, the list serves as the place for anouncements of translations, by people who are not necessarily subscribed to the list.  </s>
<s> For this reason, we opened the list to general access.  </s>
<s> However, this makes it vulnerable to spam, so we may have to reconsider this decision.  </s>
<s> If you have any suggestion or preference on this issue, please mail me or Gerald Oskoboiny, gerald@w3.org or Dave Raggett dsr@w3.org .  </s>
<s> Dave is currently the maintainer of this list.  </s>
<s> Regards, Martin.  </s>
