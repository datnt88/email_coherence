Note that the "status of this document" section will be authored by W3 staff, not the document editor, on publication. 
10. Abstract syntax questions. 
[scribe's note: DanC asked that it should be remembered that editors have been actioned to produce documents, and therefore items noted as DECISIONs below should be recognised simply as the WG producing reasonable consensus on advice that the editors' have solicited. 
(The motivation being that the WG recognise the editors are free to proceed toward completion of their documents without micromanagement of every decision)] 
10.1 Are datatypes restricted to XSD datatypes? 
jjc pointed out that opinions could be characterised as a difference of emphasis on the importance of XSD compatability. 
DECISION (unopposed): datatypes other than XSD ones are permitted. 
10.2 Do typed literals have a language identifier? 
There was a degree of debate on this issue as to where the language tag should live (in the abstract syntax, for example) and whether XSD-datatyped literals (eg, xsd:string) should carry an orthogonal language-tag element. 
Patrick Stickler outlined Nokia's use case in favour of this. 
Opponents argued on the basis that this was adding complexity to RDF literals. 
Whether the language tag should take part in a value mapping or simply be "available" to an application layer was also an issue of contention. 
Jeremy's point was that RDF meaning was realised by the model theory; to leave language tags out of the model theory seemed incoherent. 
DECISION: datatyped literals CAN have a language tag in the abstract syntax 
10.3 Does the abstract syntax require a datatype URI to refer to a datatype and that the lexical form be from the lexical space of that datatype? 
An illustrative example for this question is that xsd:integer"foo" appears to have something wrong with it; where should that be detected? 
Graham appeared to put various opinions of this in the most articulate fashion: Proposal: to distinguish between RDF-entailment (without DT knowledge, where DTyped literals in the abstract syntax don't have an equality based on value mappings) and a parameterised RDF+DT-entailment (that is, parameterised by the set of datatypes involved in the particular entailment) There seemed to be general agreement that this distinction was important and useful. 
DanC asked how Candidate Rec could be reached in the light of this. 
Jeremy proposed that while RDF+DT-entailment was parameterised, a conformant implementation up to XSD-datatypes should suffice. 
PatrickS made a timely comment that he'd just sent "Example code for working with RDF Datatypes (incl. 
XSD, UAProf, MARS, etc.)" ACTION: 2002-10-18#2 (jang) to ensure that the test suite is capable of expressing, testing and illustrating RDF-entailment and RDF+DT-entailment The meeting was extended for ten minutes to discuss the problems with language-tags. 
PatH said that it was a coherent* position that "this is a French literal and it denotes the number 10". 
There was some question about whether this was tidy. 
JanG clarified this as "the literal ( &amp;xsd:integer , "10", fr) is a French literal..." which was ugly but tidy in the abstract syntax. 
ACTION 2002-10-18#3 (jjc) to write up the current position - that is, the agreement reached in today's telecon - and to try to produce a coherent proposal dealing with the open questions from today. 
The meeting closed.

I didn't see any point in taking up telecon time on this, but I'd like to clarify my own position on this. 
Jeremey is correct, but it would be equally correct (and puts the emphasis in the right place from my own point of view) to say "opinions could be characterized as a difference of emphasis on the importance of *non*-XSD compatibility". 
That is, I want to see non-XSD types supported, and I want it to be very clear in our specs that they are. 
Most of my concern about previous text on this subject was about the fact that this wasn't particularly clear (especially given all the examples involving XSD types), so I'm quite happy with the above decision. 
However, I also think it's perfectly reasonable for us to go on from there and say that, in spite of the fact that we support any reasonable type system that we can get our concepts around, we're paying special attention to XSD types (we do, after all, 
have an XML syntax, and it's the type system "closest to home"), and we 
expect that RDF implementations will support them. 
(Preserving the distinction in "entailment levels" that Graham made).

I agree fully with Frank's position.

I thought I'd said: regrets from DanBri and DaveB. 
Please can the record reflect the strawpoll held on this question: 
are they [datatyped literals] allowed to have a lang string in the abs syntax"? 
4 preferred they do an no one couldn't live with it. 
5 preferred not with one can't live with. 
The can't live took precedence. 
One WG member later stated that they would "object" to this decision unless a datatyped literal denoted a pair consisting of a value and lang string.

Jan: 
Brian: 
My (mis?)understanding was that this was an informal process of informing the editor (who indicated, along with the series editor, intent to go along with this viewpoint), rather than a formal decision of the WG. 
I don't think it matters much.
