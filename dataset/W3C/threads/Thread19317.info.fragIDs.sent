A nice feature of Amaya is that the forms expand to fit the text (TEXTAREA) forms. 
Is there to send a POST request from the information in one TEXTAREA and then have it sent back only to that TEXTAREA? 
Perhaps this could be done in DIV tags? 
No the DIV role is to collect a set of elements. 
By example you can generate create division with class="section" to divide your document in several sections.

Hi, I've tried SVG with several namespace options in xhtml files, but none of them really works. 
Could someone tell me if there are any examples available and wich parts of SVG is supported? 
Thanks.

Today no part of SVG is supported. 
We made a early experiment on 2D Graphics and that helped the SVG Working Group. 
Now we have to improve that experiemental part of the Amaya code to really support a subset of SVG.
