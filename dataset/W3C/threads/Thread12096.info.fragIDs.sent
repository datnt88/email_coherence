<s> We are trying to find an appropriate name for our working draft revision of ATAG 1.0.  </s>
<s> Charles has suggested ATAG 1.9 as we are still referring to WCAG 1.0 until the draft WCAG 2.0 becomes more stable, but whatever we do will form the substantive basis of ATAG 2.0.  </s>
<s> Another alternative is ATAG 1.1 or simply an arbitrary name like  </s>
<s> "Wombat." What are people's thoughts?  </s>

<s> Bit more background - there are perception problems with a number, in that if we say 1.1 then I don't think it conveys the fact that this is more or less our expected 2.0 draft, and if we say 1.9 then people will wonder what happened to 1.1 through 1.8.  </s>
<s> So the easiest thing is to have a name, hence "wombat" as a proposal.  </s>
<s> (Because animals are relatively uncontroversial).  </s>
<s> One of the reasons I would like people to scream now or hold their peace is that I want to publish this so you guys can look at it before the next meeting.  </s>

<s> seriously, folks, wombat is a-ok with me, though i, too, share a preference for mythological to actual beasts (what's "cougar" going to do to our poor "wombat"?) -- how's this: wombat for now, but the code name for the next iteration is "Anansi" and there's no shortage of spider god/goddess names!  </s>
<s> -- after all, if we're going to name the document after an animal, it might as well be a weaver... i suppose, in a way, wombat's appropriate, at least according to the page located at: on which it is noted that "Wombats are rather like us, they breed anytime." which is a pretty apt analogy for an authoring tool... g.
