In the definition of the typed-value accessor it is stated that the typed value of a node is "a sequence of zero or more atomic values". 
I can visualise the scenario when the sequence consists of zero or one atomic values. 
However, I am having difficulty in understanding precisely what the typed value of a node might be when the sequence contains more than one atomic value. 
The mention of the typed-value accessor being similar to the string-value accessor doesn't help to clarify that scenario ... at least for me.

But you're probably right. 
Typed value should return zero or one atomic values, I think.

No, it can be a sequence of more than one if the element node is types as a list of atomic values...
