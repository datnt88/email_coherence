I recently recieved a private and heartfelt, well-written email concerning the WCAG 2.0 guidelines and the general WAI atmosphere, which forced me to take another long look at the guidelines themselves from a completely different perspective. 
The first thing that I noticed was the difference between the guidelines and the checkpoints. 
At the moment there is *very* little explanation or theory behind the generic guidelines (the 4 basic principles), and one has to ascertain the meaning of them through the checkpoints. 
I submit that more prose be added in an attempt to explain and clarify the meaning and purpose of each guideline, and then have the checkpoints follow that. 
For example, you get: "Guideline 1. Design content that allows presentation according to the user's needs and preferences" and then a lot of checkpoints to check that you are achieveing this. 
But before that, I want to know *why*. 
Why should I bother designing content that allows presentation according to the user's needs and preferences? 
More philosophy, please. 
The next thing that I noticed was a lack of a summary... a lack of terseness. 
WL want some way to fixing that with his approach on describing the current structure of WCAG 2.0. 
However, the main point I noticed was the importance of the final guideline: "Guideline 4. Design for compatibility and interoperability". 
I think that this is an excellent guideline, but the words have been taken out of context slightly and misinterpreted in the checkpoints. 
One of the most important things about accessibility (as Kynn will tell you) is delivering the appropriate content to the appropriate people; based on their needs. 
This is an expression of guidelines 1 and 2... but they stem from Guideline 4: why do we need to base things on the users needs? 
For interoperability; so that it operates on as many platforms, and to as many people as possible. 
People with disabilities often have customized set-ups to help them use the WWW... if something is compatable and interoperable with these set-ups, then the WWW works, and is accessible! 
The conclusion I reached was that really there are only two core WAI tenets: interoperability, and comprehension. 
I'm not sure what action this would neccesitate - I only expect some useful discussion about this point.

I only expect some useful discussion about this point. 
Unfortunately "useful discussion" requires presenting something real concrete to act upon. 
"X proposes, Y disposes" is relevant to this thing. 
WHATEVER WE PUBLISH WILL EVOKE AN UNANSWERABLE RESPONSE. 
Terse/Expansive?, etc. - if we leave all the stuff in right after the guidelines then the complaint is that it's too dense to wade through, if we get it down to briefly emitted grunts then it's not slick enough to skate over. 
All we can do is *read and vote* and modify what we read until the vote comes out right. 
I prefer that embellishment be elsewhere than in the guidelines proper, i.e. link to longer elucidations so that somebody who does have some understanding doesn't get a brain hernia from lifting the weighty tome. 
Somewhere between "just the facts, ma'am" and "DUH!". 
In other words have your offlist correspondent join the group or present an alternative that's more than "general WAI atmosphere" evaluations from afar. 
What happens is that when the chair asks if there are any objections there is often a pause during which it seems it's all OK and then just as a breath is drawn to announce proceeding with the next issue, someone (often Gregg or William) comes up with some off-the-wall insertion that changes everything. 
That's the beauty/problem in achieving consensus. 
We just have to keep on keeping on - perseverance furthers! 
Love. 
ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE To wit, I propose:- Fold guidelines 1 and 2 into 4, so that the two guidelines are "Interoperability", and "Comprehensibility". 
i.e. 
All people should get pages no matter what their disability, and understand them once they have them.

I'd add a third one which would be something like "parallelism" which is the principle which fully provides for alt text. 
(I don't think interoperability or comprehension alone are enough to cover alt attributes for images or transcripts for multimedia.) --Kynn Kynn Bartlett kynn@idyllmtn.com 
I only half agree with William -- I can definitely see where he is coming from on this and agree that whatever we produce, we will be unable to please -everyone-. 
However, I also do think that if we design a structure rather than a building, we can produce something which is adaptable, non-rigid and yet rigorous, which can be used in a variety of situations to increase accessibility of web sites. 
My ideal WCAG 2.0 would be something akin to XHTML modularization, allowing each developer to build their own accessibility plan. 
I am not convinced I'll see this happen, however. 
Maybe we need to do WCAG 1.5 (or 1.1) before we do WCAG 2.0 -- updating and correcting any WCAG 1.0 problems before attempting to do complete structural overhauls and philosophical shifts. 
While I might disagree with the basic premise of continued XHTML development, their game plan for spec development was sound, as they did not try to do three things at once, just one per spec release (convert to XML format; divide into modules; and only THEN start considering throwing out elements/adding new functionality). 
--Kynn Kynn Bartlett kynn@idyllmtn.com 
Sean, I would say that you can fold even further and state as one guideline, 'all people should be able to use the Web'. 
I think the thing to remember is that when are dividing down sub-guidelines, we are essentially drawing -arbitrary lines-, and when we do so, we should draw those based on what best allows us to communicate our intent to our audience. 
This is where the "around 7" rule comes in handy; I'd say that less than 7 guidelines (but around 7, so 4-6) with around 7 (or more, say, 7 to 9) checkpoints each would be a good granularity scale. 
Within that scale, it's just a matter of figuring out which arbitrary splitting of hairs is most conducive to getting our point across. 
I like Wendy's proposal -- what I've skimmed of it -- and I think is about the right granularity to be well-structured and easy to understand. 
I think 2 guidelines isn't fine enough to be easily understood. 
(As an example of this principle, I think that 'give alt text for everything' is too chunky, and 'give alt text for images' + 'give long descs for complex images' + 'give captions for multimedia' + 'give transcripts for multimedia' is better, even though both formations say basically the same thing -- modulo, of course, the possibility that I forgot to list something. 
*grin*) --Kynn Kynn Bartlett kynn@idyllmtn.com 
Very true indeed; I'd like to see it as an ontological hierarchy (e.g. a tree) rather than a list (of points). 
But of course, ultimately, WCAG 2.0 would be a Web - a modularized Web. 
Look at CSS3: that is now modularized...XHTML did it a long time ago. 
Modularization is the way forward I think, and neither lists or similar hierarchies are as expressive. 
So what then? 
Well, I think Kynn's gedankenexperiment of having a WCAG 1.5 was a highly valid one. 
Clear up WCAG, and then express it better... but I feel that the fight is lost and that we should have been discussing this a long time ago. 
I did propose that WCAG 2.0 be a Web of accessibility points before, but was strangely ignored... maybe I didn't set out a clear enough goal... Time to start work on WCAG 3.0 then?

Kynn, I agree that we are working on a structure more than a "building" with pre-concieved walls, foundations, and roof ... But I would rather move ahead to version 2.0 and considering reducing the number of guidelines to about four, give or take ... The inbetween steps may be neat organization, but we are delaying the many decisions that need to be made if we are to stay ahead of legislation. 
The fact that the published Guidelines are 1.0, which lack full provisions for learning and cognitively disabled persons, makes me anxious to get on with Guidelines 2.0 and get them in the works as quickly as possible. 
Anne Kynn, If it came to a vote, I would go with 4 Guidelines ... per William's site Linked to each guidelines, which could each have a long description, up to seven checkpoints, and each checkpoint can have up to seven techniques, but the opening number is nicer at four.... interoperability/attachments (specific technologies), navigability, comprehensibility, and (whatever I've overlooked!) ... Why? 
Perhaps because when you are lecturing, you can hold up four fingers and still sip on your coffee ... !! Anne
