[ taken to www-archive, because I'm so embarassed to be beating this dead horse again. 
but I really do want to know.... ] While waiting for them, you might use the URIs defined in and The fact that this is from Topic Maps land doesn't matter, the meaning of the URIs is well defined and they suit RDF as well. 
I don't see any URIs defined there. 
I see ids defined there. 
How do you connect the two?

The idea is that each topic element in a topic map is a surrogate for a subject (anything you want to talk about) and that the combination of the document URI and the IDs 'produces' URIs that are identifiers for the subjects that are surrogated by the topic elements. 
This is not different from the way RDF uses the id attribute (if I get it right). 
Aside: I am by now absolutely convinced that fragment identifiers should be avoided in URIs that are intended to be used as subject identifiers and I myself strongly favor URIs such as that might well be defined in a single huge HTML document so humans can look up the 'meaning' of the URIs. 
But language.xtm and country.xtm are already widely used in the TM world.
