<s> [priority 2] User notification for appropriate markup language Evaluation: * All BODY elements will generate a user notification.  </s>
<s> LRK:: since this checkpoint only refers to images, why notify for all BODY Elements?  </s>
<s> Why not just Images?  </s>
<s> Also, I don't understand what "All body elements" mean.  </s>
<s> There is just one "Body Element" since that term means the start tag, end tag, and everything in between.  </s>
<s> Do you mean all elements that are part of the Body Element's content?  </s>
<s> This is an interesting question.  </s>
<s> Yes, primarily when IMG elements or OBJECT used to embed images are identified, the author ought to be asked if the image could be converted to an appropriate markup language (MathML, HTML with style sheets, etc.).  </s>
<s> However, are there cases where another element within the body of the document could be converted to a markup language?  </s>
<s> For example, PRE elements to layout numbers converted to a TABLE, or PDF converted to HTML or in the future ascii art could be converted to SVG.  </s>
<s> Is there a case where something in a P element should be marked up?  </s>
<s> ascii art is the only thing I can think of.  </s>
<s> Headers, forms, lists...all seem to be marked up well.  </s>
<s> Tables being converted to style sheets are covered in other checkpoints.  </s>
<s> Therefore, I think I disagree that all elements in the BODY element should generate this warning.  </s>
<s> I think it should be limited to: IMG OBJECT/EMBED PRE  </s>
<s> what about the future?  </s>
<s> what about XML?  </s>
<s> RDF?  </s>

<s> Hmmm.  </s>
<s> Well, those are w3c markups so in principle we should just get them accessible instead of asking for equivalent HTML markup.  </s>

<s> Could be converted to animated gif (although that can be a hassle) or Dynamic HTML.  </s>
<s> Actually, this brings up yet another point.  </s>
<s> Does anyone know the status of acessibility of Applets?  </s>
<s> IBM and Sun were doing some impressive things with Java accessibilty.  </s>

<s> Somebody from IBM or Sun may speak up, but in case they're not monitoring the discussion - Applets have the same capability for accessibility as standalone Java applications do.  </s>
<s> However, it relies on the Java Accessibility API which is standard in Java 1.2 but is an extension to Java 1.1.x.  </s>
<s> Java 1.1.x is what most browsers currently have and I don't know if you can configure the Virtual Machines that ship with browsers and aren't standalone to use the Accessibility API.  </s>
<s> The workaround is for the user to use the Java Plugin, but then the page author must include the applet on the page as a plugin (using EMBED or perhaps OBJECT) instead of as an APPLET which would automatically use the browser's internal Virtual Machine.  </s>
<s> Hopefully I got that right... Michael  </s>
<s> I think the situation may be better than that.  </s>
<s> I looked in the User Agent Working Group implementation notes but I did not find there a survey of the implementation of the Swing Set.  </s>
<s> This would be good to know.  </s>
<s> Thanks to the lawsuit, with my Win98 laptop I got, on a separate CD ROM, a [Sun-] Compliant Java VM. But I cannot find in the OS any way to find an "About" page for it that tells me what the Java VM I have installed is compliant _with_.  </s>
