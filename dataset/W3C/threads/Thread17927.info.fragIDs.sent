<s> Hi Wendy,  </s>
<s> Answer, bad color contrast is the #1 accessibility problem for people with  </s>
<s> low vision.  </s>
<s> In some browsers the user can set a prefered color combination,  </s>
<s> but on a lot of web pages this doesn't help at all, because of the use of  </s>
<s> text images.  </s>
<s> You are right at this point.  </s>
<s> A lot of color problems are caused by the browser.  </s>
<s> I see a lot of pages where only the background and or text color  </s>
<s> is defined by the designer not the link, vlink and alink colors.  </s>
<s> But the reason that most people do not use default colors is because of text images.  </s>
<s> In my opinion if the author sets any color he or she must set all colors.  </s>
<s> On a lot of web pages the background "color" is an image.  </s>
<s> The user default settings do not work at all on these pages.  </s>
<s> This problem could also be solved by the possibility to disable background images in the browser.  </s>
<s> In some browsers, the user could select "high-contrast mode" where the browser selects both the foreground and background colors.  </s>
<s> For example, yellow text on a black background.  </s>
<s> Only Opera has some good low vision options in its browser.  </s>
<s> But this  </s>
<s> browser is used by only 0.2% of the Internet population, because it is not  </s>
<s> free and doesn't support all Internet languages like Java.  </s>
<s> In Internet Explorer and Netscape there are only some limited low vision options available and options that disable things like loading images or Java aplets.  </s>
<s> These kind of options have nothing to do with accessibility only increases the inaccessibility if you select them.  </s>
<s> Maybe we should ask the ER or UA groups to look in more detail at the issue of ensuring contrast?  </s>
<s> Most User Agents allow a choice of colours, although most do not automatically pick a contrasting colour where there is a conflict or semi-specified colour scheme.  </s>
<s> I agree this is a UA item.  </s>
<s> Only I think a technique here should be "if you specify colors or use a background image specify all colors including bgcolor, link, alink, vlink, text and table colors if you are using tables".  </s>
<s> Regards Peter Verhoeven Internet : http://www.magnifiers.org  </s>
<s> (The Screen Magnifiers Homepage)  </s>
<s> Hi Charles, I fully agree with you.  </s>
<s> If one color is specified or an background image is used ALL colors must be set.  </s>
<s> An authoring, evaluation or repair tool can check on this and can also warn if a bad color contrast is set.  </s>
<s> This should highly improve accessibility.  </s>
