Hi, I'm editing old HTML pages built with Amaya V4.3. 
The 5.1 version gives me a parsing error due to the link tag : *** Errors/warnings in /home/alex/dev/tvi/doc/tutorial/udb/page3.htm line 11, char 2: mismatched tag Alexandre Brillant 
It's parsing it as XHTML, in which the correct markup would be 
Hello, Can you send us the whole document you are editing (or at least the part that precedes the tag link ). 
This error message generally occurs when a XML document is not well-formed. 
Cordially Laurent Carcone
