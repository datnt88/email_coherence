<s> Request for information: what TEI xptr implementations are there?  </s>

<s> I realized i never answered this one: * Panorama has a reasonable subset, and their HyTime support is built on top of the TEI xptrs (which i find rather gratifying).  </s>
<s> * DynaText has support for both P1 and P3 version xptrs.  </s>
<s> I think I did all the genetic traversals (but only did negative instance numbers for the easy cases; that was just lack of time, tho, not a strategic decision; and didn't do regexes within GIs and attrs; and I think i limited it to 10 attr/value pairs or something (can we say 'in a hurry'?  </s>
<s> I knew we could)).  </s>
<s> Didn't do TOKEN or STR because it's a pain to count them, esp.  </s>
<s> when you don't know if P now X here gives one word or two (if X is ITEM or FOOTNOE it's two, if X is EMPH maybe not).  </s>
<s> I didn't do SPACE or FOREIGN.  </s>
<s> Wanted to do PATTERN but didn't have time to hook up a regex module, so didn't.  </s>
<s> Obviously ROOT and HERE.  </s>
<s> I didn't do spans directly, but you can build them by calling the stuff i built twice instead of once from your application.  </s>
<s> Not sure who else has them, but aren't they like Thneeds?  </s>

<s> 5.2 list item 3 'XML ID attribute'.  </s>
<s> This term is only meaningful for a document which is valid or at least has an ATTLIST for the given element.  </s>
<s> There is a (natural) assumption in this section that TEI searches will be extended primarily to valid documents, but I'd like to argue for WF documents as well.  </s>
<s> Done.  </s>
<s> All you have to do is put, in the internal subset, for any element FOO and it should work, right?  </s>

<s> I discovered with pleasure that a new version of XML-LINK has been mounted - I hope it's OK to discuss it, even tho' not announced?  </s>
<s> And I assume that this is the version that's being printed up for the W3C.  </s>
<s> I think it looks good and any comments below are minor criticisms.  </s>

<s> And what do they implement?  </s>
<s> I'm going to be *very* reluctant to vote for anything, no matter how cool &amp; peachy-keen, that nobody is actually using.  </s>
<s> I have coded most of the XML-LINK draft on TEI pointers (I need another hour for -ve numbers in PRECEDING).  </s>
<s> I notice that the draft has substantially changed (no complaints, I've read the pre-amble:-).  </s>
<s> Thanks for changing the tables in 3.2 3.3, etc.  </s>
<s> Much clearer now.  </s>
<s> 5.2 list item 3 'XML ID attribute'.  </s>
<s> This term is only meaningful for a document which is valid or at least has an ATTLIST for the given element.  </s>
<s> There is a (natural) assumption in this section that TEI searches will be extended primarily to valid documents, but I'd like to argue for WF documents as well.  </s>
<s> I think it's quite likely that TEI searches will be used on fragments because they are a very powerful method of rationalising partially structured data (indeed I am including the approach through my code).  </s>
<s> The point is that is that *people who don't know anything about SGML* will have no idea of the special significance of ID.  </s>
<s> They may well create documents with attributes named IDs which do not fulfil the uniqueness criterion (or the naming conventions).  </s>
<s> Since XML-LINK (but not XML-LANG) puts special emphasis on the attribute *name* ID as well as its type, this should be highlighted as a reserved word in XML-LANG.  </s>
<s> [This is not a trivial point - if a data object is referred to as an ID, then it's natural for a beginner to use that as an attribute name].  </s>
<s> There are areas where the draft is unclear to someone who doesn't come from the extended TEI community and since the idea is that the draft is self contained, here are some: 5.3 Spans, etc.  </s>
<s> I suspect there are some well-known semantics to this word which are unknown to me and not in the draft.  </s>
<s> list item 2 refers to the TEI 'FROM' and 'TO' attributes, but I don't have a pointer to the TEI spec on this.  </s>
<s> This should be made more self-contained.  </s>
<s> 5.3.1  </s>
<s> I am confused here.  </s>
<s> The result of evaluatiing a location term is always an element (i.e. it is either a single element or a properly nested tree of elements).  </s>
<s> However, for the ".." operator the result is "all of the text" from the first location (or the start of the element) to the end of the [text] or the element selected by the second series.  </s>
<s> For *one* location term I think this is clear - either an element with GI or a (complete) chunk of *CDATA (but not including other elements).  </s>
<s> For *two* terms, there seems to be no requirement that they start and end at the same level of the hierarchy.  </s>
<s> Thus is the example in 5.3.3 ("a sentence (A) with no embedded child elements", etc.) any contiguous subset (?span) makes sense.  </s>
<s> But what if B has children and the second location term stops 'somewhere in the middle of B'?  </s>
<s> Is this allowed?  </s>
<s> I appreciate that this makes most sense if the document is viewed as an event stream and that any span represents a 'chunk of marked up text'.  </s>
<s> But if the document has a complex structure then starting at one point in the tree and ending at a higher or lower level may be nonsense.  </s>
<s> I am also not quite clear what the word 'text' means.  </s>
<s> Is it synonymous with *CDATA?  </s>
<s> [I would prefer a term that made it clear that numbers, etc. were allowed here].  </s>
<s> The example uses the phrase 'third span of character data', for example.  </s>
<s> I notice that PATTERN and FOREIGN have disappeared.  </s>
<s> Presumably there is no bar to applications using them - the constraint is that publicly visible XML addresses don't contain them, I assume.  </s>
<s> Since I believe that almost everyone is going to want applications to carry out PATTERN-based searches, it would be useful to have a generally agreed convention for the syntax (even if the regexs were different).  </s>

<s> If you mean the version on the W3C site, it's just a placeholder.  </s>
<s> When you see a version dated 970406, you will be looking at the one that will be released at the WWW6 conference.  </s>
<s> That version will be visible to you on the textuality site tomorrow morning, though it may take a couple of days to get up on the W3C site.  </s>
<s> I will have PostScript and RTF versions up on sunsite.unc.edu by tomorrow morning as well.  </s>
<s> There will be announcements on this list as soon as the various formats are available.  </s>
<s> It will probably be most productive to hold comments until the new version comes out; there have been a *lot* of changes in the past few days.  </s>
<s> Bear in mind that the draft you will be seeing is for discussion, not for implementation yet.  </s>
<s> This is due to the determinate conflict resolution procedures built into our current process.  </s>
<s> On June 30 that process will be replaced by the rules that have governed other W3C working groups since they were put into place last December.  </s>
