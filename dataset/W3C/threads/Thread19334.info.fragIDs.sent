Hi, I've just compiled Amaya's latest release with Gtk+. 
The program starts but it seems that all the interface's callbacks are disconnected since it doesn't react to any event. 
I've tried it with Lesstif and it works fine. 
I wanted to ask if this is a mistake from my part, or if it is a fixed bug. 
If it's none, I'm willing to contribute some bits since fully internationalized editors cruely lack under Linux and I understand Amaya will be one in a near future. 
Regards, Chahine 
Salutations, Ok, count me in. 
Je commencerais par me familiariser avec le code de Amaya en l'?tudiant et en suivant les documents fournis sur le site W3C. 
Any advice? 
Merci, Chahine 
Hi, As you see the GTK version is very embryonic. 
I guess it's not very complex to connect callbacks. 
It's a lack of time that explains why it's not done yet. 
We planned to have a student that summer for working on the GTK version but he received a proposal for a stable job just before joining us. 
I guess it was good for him but it didn't let us time to find another student. 
My plan is to invest my personal time this summer (after the July release) because I think it's very important and urgent to move to GTK. 
We expect also to use GTK for having an internationalized version of Amaya on Unix palforms. 
Of course, if you'd like to contribute your help is welcome. 
Irene.
