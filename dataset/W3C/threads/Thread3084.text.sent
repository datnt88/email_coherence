[thread starts in rdf-interest goes via rdf-calendar and #rdfig... And I'm taking it to the new public-cwm-talk@w3.org 
, cuz diff is high on the cwm/swap agenda... psst... timbl, you haven't subscribed yet. 
I'm still leaning toward finding or making a better XML serializer. 
I'm tired of running tidy to indent the results so that I can look at them. 
I have recently been playing "nearby", so to speak. 
In my just-announced RDF graph-difference displayer [1], I followed the link to... wow! 
That's really cool! 
We've been noodling on the diff problem for quite a while, and your solution looks appealing from theoretical _and_ practical angles. 
I gotta try it out... 
I'm able to reproduce your results on a debian GNU/linux box thusly: # apt-get install hugs connolly@dirk:~/src/gk-swish/HaskellRDF$ runhugs -98 -P:.:../HaskellUtils/:Parsec:HUnit:Sort:Dfa Swish.hs -i=Data/Diff1.n3 -d=Data/Diff2.n3 
Graph differences: 8 ---- Difference 1 ---- Graph 1:"lx12" Graph 2:"lx22" ---- Difference 2 ---- Graph 1:base3:o3 Graph 2:_:o3 ---- Difference 3 ---- Graph 1: (_:11 base2:5 "lx13") Graph 2: (No arcs) ---- Difference 4 ---- Graph 1: (No arcs) Graph 2: (_:11 base2:p5 "lx13") ---- Difference 5 ---- Graph 1: (_:7 base2:p22 (_:8 rdf:rest (_:10 rdf:rest rdf:nil ; rdf:first "lx12") ; rdf:first (_:9 base2:p23 "lx11"))) Graph 2: (No arcs) ---- Difference 6 ---- Graph 1: (No arcs) Graph 2: (_:7 base2:p22a (_:8 rdf:rest (_:10 rdf:rest rdf:nil ; rdf:first "lx22") ; rdf:first (_:9 base2:p23 "lx21"))) ---- Difference 7 ---- Graph 1:"p3-diff1" Graph 2:"p3-diff2" ---- Difference 8 ---- Graph 1:base4:o1 Graph 2:base4:o2 I use an approach that starts by partitioning the RDF graph into subtrees whose branches jointly span the graph. 
One of my plans for the future is to use this to add an improved serializer to Swish. 
The module concerned is at [2], and you may be able to glean some ideas, even if you're not fluent in Haskell... #g [1] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-interest/2004Feb/0056.html [2] http://www.ninebynine.org/Software/Swish-0.2.1/HaskellRDF/GraphPartition.hs 
Graham Klyne Dan Connolly, W3C http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/ see you at the W3C Tech Plenary in Cannes 1-5 Mar 2003? 
Thanks! 
I've added a link to your IRC posting to my description.
