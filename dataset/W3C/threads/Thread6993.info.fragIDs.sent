<s> Hi all, I've finally put my money where my mouth is, and put together a draft that (attempts to) outline the state of IETF documentation on the URI standard.  </s>

<s> Internet-Drafts are working documents of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), its areas, and its working groups.  </s>
<s> Note that other groups may also distribute working documents as Internet-Drafts.  </s>
<s> Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six months and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at any time.  </s>
<s> It is inappropriate to use Internet- Drafts as reference material or to cite them other than as "work in progress."  </s>
<s> The list of current Internet-Drafts can be accessed at The list of Internet-Draft Shadow Directories can be accessed at 1 Abstract The pieces of the specification of Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs), and subsets thereof, span several documents which have evolved independently over time.  </s>
<s> This memo provides the definitive overview of the (currently) relevant documentation.  </s>
<s> As such, it acts as a definition of the core standard for URIs, incorporating existing standards documents by reference.  </s>
<s> 2 Conventions Used in this Document The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].  </s>
<s> 3 Introduction Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) provide a simple and extensible means for identifying a resource.  </s>
<s> A URI can be further classified as a locator, a name, or both.  </s>
<s> The term "Uniform Resource Locator" (URL) refers to the subset of URIs that identify resources via a representation of their primary access mechanism (e.g., their network "location"), rather than identifying the resource by name or by some other attribute(s) of that resource.  </s>
<s> The term "Uniform Resource Name" (URN) refers to the subset of URIs that are required to remain globally unique and persistent even when the resource ceases to exist or becomes unavailable.  </s>
<s> A URI "scheme" defines the namespace of the URI, and thus may further restrict the syntax and semantics of identifiers using that scheme.  </s>
<s> Throughout the history of the discussion of URIs there has been a steady stream of documentation published to describe various elements of conceptual models, syntaxes, related services, and particular schemes.  </s>
<s> This dispersed collection of documentation does not serve the purpose of a clear specification of the URI standard, and is certainly confusing to people who haven't been involved in the discussions since the outset.  </s>
<s> This memo singles out the key documents that comprise the core definition of URIs and their use.  </s>
<s> Key areas of the specification are definition and syntax (Section 4), use/resolution (Section 5), and associated registration requirements (Section 6).  </s>
<s> As additional clarification, some of the documents that provide useful informational background or have historical importance, that are not part of the current URI definition are mentioned in Section 7. 4 URI structure The definition of the generic syntax of URIs is presented in [RFC2396].  </s>
<s> All URIs MUST conform to this syntax.  </s>
<s> Additionally, further syntactic restrictions of URIs for Uniform Resource Names (URNs) are defined in [RFC2141].  </s>
<s> All URNs MUST adhere to this syntax.  </s>
<s> 5 Use of existing URIs Typically, the handling of URIs of particular schemes is defined in individual documents to that purpose.  </s>
<s> URI schemes are registered with IANA, and registrations (with pointers to official documentation) are viewable at [IANAURL].  </s>
<s> Similarly, URN namespaces are registered with IANA, and can be reviewed at [IANAURN].  </s>
<s> Additioanlly, a global resolution service, which is RECOMMENDED for global resolution of URNs, but also has application for URIs of all schemes, is defined in [RFCXXXX].  </s>
<s> 6 Creation of new URIs The creation of new identifiers is governed by the syntactic and (where applicable) other rules laid out for each URI scheme or URN namespace.  </s>
<s> The process for creating new URI schemes is outlined in [RFC2717].  </s>
<s> See [RFC2611] for information on how to create a new URN namespace.  </s>
<s> Information about the process for inclusion of a URN namespace in the global resolution service defined in [RFCXXXX] is given in [RFCYYYY].  </s>
<s> 7 Informational/historical reading The documentation referred to in the preceeding sections provides a complete definition of the URI standard.  </s>
<s> However, earlier documentation can provide informative insight into the evolution of URIs.  </s>
<s> The first documents discussing URIs (then "universal" resource identifiers) were [RFC1630], [RFC1736], and [RFC1738].  </s>
<s> [RFC1738] and [RFC1808] provided the first definition of URI syntax (and syntax for "relative" URIs), as well as the definition of the first URI schemes.  </s>
<s> For URI syntax, these documents have been replaced by [RFC2396].  </s>
<s> Guidelines for the creation of new URI schemes are outlined in [RFC2718].  </s>
<s> Additional information regarding the general principles behind, and goals of, URNs can be found in [RFC2267].  </s>
<s> The global resolution service for URNs/URIs was originally described experimentally in [RFC2168], but that has been replaced by a suite of standards-track documents, of which [RFCXXXX] defines the URN/URI resolution application.  </s>
<s> 8 Security Considerations This document does not discuss material that introduces new causes for considerations of security.  </s>
<s> The issues of security in URIs are discussed in the individual documents referenced herein.  </s>

<s> Why are you doing this as a standard instead of an informational spec?  </s>
<s> The various specifications that are being referred to are not at the same level of standardization, so creating a meta-standard is not appropriate.  </s>
<s> ....Roy  </s>
<s> Howdy,  </s>
<s> A few reasons, including the fact that informational RFCs "don't count" (except to marketroids who view all RFCs as standards, when convenient).  </s>
<s> I disagree that having a metadocument is inappropriate -- we need one reference point for URIs, and as long as we continue to develop the space by independant documentation (which does seem to be the best way to to do it), the simplest, easiest to keep-up-to-date path is a metaspec.  </s>

<s> "Reality with a delicate splash of the imaginary... ... or was that the other way around?" -- ThinkingCat Leslie Daigle leslie@thinkingcat.com  </s>
<s> The IETF has a standards process for many reasons, but one of the main ones is so that people are less likely to be confused over what is and is not considered standardized.  </s>
<s> A metastandard consisting of various bits that are not at the same level of standardization defeats that purpose.  </s>
<s> That sounds informational to me.  </s>
<s> I reference informational RFCs all the time, so I don't see the problem.  </s>
<s> Cheers, ....Roy  </s>
<s> Two comments:  </s>
<s> 1. I note that this is indeed an attempt to say what the current IETF picture is.  </s>
<s> As such, it clearly lacks a key component: the answer to the question "what is a resource".  </s>
<s> As the W3C RDF activity has found (in my  </s>
<s> opinion), it is no longer sufficient to gloss over this by saying "whatever you want".  </s>
<s> It may indeed be necessary to allow it to be "whatever you want" but there must be some constraints if we are to build useful tools to deal with resources: "whatever you want, but you say what it is as follows....so that we can design tools which will do the following...." Much the same discussion has been occurring outside the web space in the world of ISO standards (ISBN, ISSN, etc), where there has been a discussion (earlier this year) under the auspices of ISO TC 46 on the need for descriptive information about the resource identified by the ISO identifier.  </s>
<s> 2. Despite Leslie's disclaimer, it already appears that we have an IETF process in motion or proposed which will cover exactly the same ground as the proposed W3C activity.  </s>
<s> No objection if this gets things done, except if we have to discuss every issue on two different lists at two different times (three if I count the ISO discussion).  </s>
<s> Norman Hi all, I've finally put my money where my mouth is, and put together a draft that (attempts to) outline the state of IETF documentation on the URI standard.  </s>

<s> Resource is defined in RFC 2396.  </s>
<s> ....Roy  </s>
<s> Yep.... Now if you have some application that needs some constrained definition then that is something that your application defines.  </s>

<s> Folks said:  </s>
<s> RFC 2396 says: "A resource can be anything that has identity".  </s>
<s> Gee thats helpful in designing tools!  </s>
<s> :-).  </s>
<s> Maybe you are looking for something other than a resource.  </s>
<s> That is the only thing a tool needs to know in order to manipulate the Web interface: the fact that it knows very little, and therefore must rely on the naming authority for everything else.  </s>
<s> RFC 2396 also goes on to say: The resource is the conceptual mapping to an entity or set of entities, not necessarily the entity which corresponds to that mapping at any particular instance in time.  </s>
<s> [...] Which I find to be helpful.  </s>
<s> I think an accompanying definition of "entity" would have been helpful.  </s>
<s> I submit that the purpose of these documents is not only to state what the tools need to know, but also what human users/designers need to know.  </s>
<s> I think there have been many discussions that would have been easier with a clear, common understanding of the properties of resources and their relationship to URIs.  </s>
