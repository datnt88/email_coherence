<s> I would really like to take the 'example: ALT tag for images in HTML 4.0' out of the guideliens in nearly all the places.  </s>
<s> There are some cases where it is simply irrelevant to the point of the guideline, and its frequency makes it look as though it was pasted everywhere to save the trouble of thinking about an appropriate example.  </s>

<s> I think definitely we should change the text of many of the links.  </s>
<s> Even if ALT demonstrated all examples, I think it is important to have some diversity.  </s>
<s> And where it is not relevant, or is one of the less relevant of possible examples, I would rather (at this stage - early working draft) leave it out - we will have to fix some later, but I think that the absence of a default would make us think more carefully - analagously to (ironically) not having default ALT text...

<s> There is a fine line between approaching people as a genuine customer base (eg I represent organisation XXX which uses your product, and we would like it if you did YYY, where YYY might be make your tools conform to the WAI AU guidelines, or take part in the WAI AU process, or whatever) and reverse-spamming people - getting lots of people to send in the same  </s>

<s> Given the size and make-up of the WAI AU group I feel that a rather more selective approach than 'everyone write to everyone and invite them to join' should be applied - unless I use WebPagesFast 7.9, or am going to, then I don't have much clout as a clientele except by misrepresenting myself, which I don't want to do.  </s>
