I would really like to take the 'example: ALT tag for images in HTML 4.0' out of the guideliens in nearly all the places. 
There are some cases where it is simply irrelevant to the point of the guideline, and its frequency makes it look as though it was pasted everywhere to save the trouble of thinking about an appropriate example. 
This reflects badly onthe rest of the guidelines document. 
Thoughts?

These should be links to appropriate anchors in the example section and should be relevant. 
They seem to have become one anchor as opposed to several different anchors somewhere in the editing process. 
The intention of the example section is that all the appropriate guidelines would be illustrated in the section. 
Possibly we should change the text of the links to make it less redundant or have a statement at the beginning of the guideline section that the various guidelines are illustrated in the alt tag example.

I think definitely we should change the text of many of the links. 
Even if ALT demonstrated all examples, I think it is important to have some diversity. 
And where it is not relevant, or is one of the less relevant of possible examples, I would rather (at this stage - early working draft) leave it out - we will have to fix some later, but I think that the absence of a default would make us think more carefully - analagously to (ironically) not having default ALT text...

Below is my first listing of product managers/members of a product team for Authoring Tool companies. 
More will be trickling in today and early next week. 
My suggestion is that everyone on the list send an invitation to these people asking them to join the WAI Authoring Tool Guideline effort. 
This will show them that their clientel would like their products to have accessibility features built in.

Unless this has been discussed and agreed by the chair already, I suggest waiting a little bit before doing something that will sounds like spam to some people. 
How does this one differ from PageMill ? 
Allaire HomeSite ? 
(and I guess we already have direct links to FrontPage and HotMetal) 
Hmmmm. 
There is a fine line between approaching people as a genuine customer base (eg I represent organisation XXX which uses your product, and we would like it if you did YYY, where YYY might be make your tools conform to the WAI AU guidelines, or take part in the WAI AU process, or whatever) and reverse-spamming people - getting lots of people to send in the same 
request. 
Given the size and make-up of the WAI AU group I feel that a rather more selective approach than 'everyone write to everyone and invite them to join' should be applied - unless I use WebPagesFast 7.9, or am going to, then I don't have much clout as a clientele except by misrepresenting myself, which I don't want to do. 
For example, I don't imagine that Microsoft would have a very convincing argument that they are a large customer base for Amaya (although I would happily be proven wrong - I just made that example up). 
*smile* On the other hand, the more information we have about which authoring tools are out there, and what they do and don't do well, the better equipped we are. 
And if we have a number of manufacturers active on this list then we are likely to have a more fruitful discussion than if we have just one or two.

ImageReady is their "Photoshop for Web developers." 
They will be sending me their PageMill contact soon. 
As I mentioned, the contacts are trickling in. 
5 Minutes after I posted by list, these were e-mailed to me: Allaire HomeSite and Cold Fusion Dir.

That's fine. 
One of the things the Web Standards Project is doing to make it easier for genuine Web developers and designers get in touch with the product teams of the browser companies, is to work with the companies to create an e-mail address where Web developers can post information about improvements they desire or bugs they run across. 
At Microsoft, this is wasp@microsoft.com; 
with Netscape we have several avenues through the Gecko project. 
Maybe this would be a good idea. 
My apologies- I didn't realize how large the AU group was. 
I hope my contact information will be used constructively.

Could members please not contact the people below individually. 
Charles M. and I will contact them on behalf of the group. 
We are already in communication with a number of them and a spam-like action would only muddy the waters and may counteract some of our efforts. 
Thanks Jutta
