<s> Dear GEO participants, Here is a pointer to a source of ideas for guidelines: These tips appear (at random) on the (X)HTML validator, see e.g. http://validator.w3.org:8001/check?uri=http://www.w3.org/.  </s>
<s> I think these tips are interesting for various reasons: - They show an example of how to ask people for ideas for tips/guidelines,... and how to review them.  </s>
<s> (http://www.w3.org/2001/06tips/#process) - They may be one of the places to distribute I18N-related guidelines, or an entry point to I18N guidelines Regards, Martin.  </s>
<s> Nice to see some discussion starting.  </s>
<s> I like the styles guide http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/ organization as a model that is readable sequentially, but allows you to move quickly to topics of particular interest as well as being able to read thru overviews without getting mired in details.  </s>
<s> The overviews become the quick tips...  </s>

<s> Hi  </s>
<s> The style guide incorporating quick tips is an interesting idea,  </s>
<s> although the format is better suited to material designed as educational material or for casual reading.  </s>
<s> For more intensive uses in the workplace something more concise and maybe akin to the accessibility guidelines/checklists may more useful.  </s>
<s> Ideally we need to cover both types/levels of material.  </s>
<s> Just my 2 cents worth.  </s>

<s> It does sound like there may be two needs: 1. Quick tips A list of the tips provides links into the content Each link (tip) summarizes the action to take 2. A manual A more traditional table of contents provides links into the content In addition to the guidelines themselves, the manual could include introductory sections with background material, appendices with backup material, etc.  </s>
<s> I'm wondering if a single source of content could serve both needs...?  </s>
<s> That is, the quick tips simply become another window into (i.e. a set of links into) the core of the manual (the sections containing the guidelines.  </s>
<s> There may be a mismatch in style, level of detail needed, or navigational needs, but if it worked it could reduce the time to produce them.  </s>
