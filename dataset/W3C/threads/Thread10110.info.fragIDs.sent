<s> Ahem - wrong date!  </s>
<s> Hit the reload button :) W3C Working Draft 12 November 2002 But great work Eric!  </s>
<s> Yeah, thanks all.  </s>
<s> Dave  </s>
<s> Well done everyone.  </s>
<s> Since we have so many working drafts, it makes sense to send out just one announcement for them all.  </s>
<s> If no one objects, I'll do that tomorrow.  </s>
<s> Brian  </s>
<s> This isn't an objection, but some thinking-out-loud.  </s>
<s> Asking everybody to review everything often results in getting nobody to review anything.  </s>
<s> It's clear to me that subscribers to www-rdf-logic will be interested in the model theory; they're perhaps more likely to pay attention to an announcement from PatH (though I hesitate to impose further on Pat).  </s>
<s> The syntax spec and test cases should go to the developer fora; www-rdf-interest at least, but probably other places too.  </s>
<s> I'd expect an announcement from DaveB to get the most attention.  </s>
<s> I'd like to see Mike Dean shop it around the DAML crowd too.  </s>
<s> I'd like to see the "customer groups", i.e. dublin core, RSS, etc. invited to review the primer.  </s>
<s> But I wonder... you can really only expect one thorough read of a document from any given reviewer.  </s>
<s> Do we want to play that card on this draft?  </s>
<s> Or do we expect the next one to be substantially different?  </s>
<s> EricM, thoughts?  </s>
<s> I have similar thoughts/reservations about concepts.  </s>
<s> So... hmm... maybe asking everybody to review everything is right for this round of drafts, supplemented by a few more targetted invitations here and there.  </s>
