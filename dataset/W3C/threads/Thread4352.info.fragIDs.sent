<s> i want to query for all nodes except for a selected few.  </s>
<s> this is pretty straight forward in SQL, but how do you do it for XQuery?  </s>
<s> I can do this in XSLT but want an equivalent XQuery.  </s>
<s> for example: i want to return all the nodes that do not contain an Owner element or if a node where its child Owner element is equal to "mluu".  </s>
<s> so the resulting output would be: thanks for your help!  </s>

<s> Hi Mike, Just use the same XPath that you would in XSLT: //*[not(Owner) or Owner = 'mluu'] You indicated that an element always contains at most one Owner, but if there might be multiple owners you need to decide what you want done in that case.  </s>
<s> The query above matches as long as there exists an Owner equal to mluu (or no Owner).  </s>
<s> You also implied that Owner has simple content.  </s>
<s> The query above would also match cases with complex content, like Owner foo mluu /foo /Owner .  </s>

<s> Hi Mike (Luu), To me, this looks like a programming question rather than a comment on our specification.  </s>
<s> Would you agree that it does not need to be entered as a public comment, or do you think there is an issue with the XQuery language that needs to be tracked?  </s>
<s> If you post programming questions to www-ql@w3.org, that will help simplify our tracking of issues.  </s>

<s> FYI, this is a programming question that i mistakenly posted on the public-qt-comments mailing list.  </s>
<s> nevertheless, thanks for all the help.  </s>
