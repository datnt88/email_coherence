i want to query for all nodes except for a selected few. 
this is pretty straight forward in SQL, but how do you do it for XQuery? 
I can do this in XSLT but want an equivalent XQuery. 
for example: i want to return all the nodes that do not contain an Owner element or if a node where its child Owner element is equal to "mluu". 
so the resulting output would be: thanks for your help!

Hi Mike, Just use the same XPath that you would in XSLT: //*[not(Owner) or Owner = 'mluu'] You indicated that an element always contains at most one Owner, but if there might be multiple owners you need to decide what you want done in that case. 
The query above matches as long as there exists an Owner equal to mluu (or no Owner). 
You also implied that Owner has simple content. 
The query above would also match cases with complex content, like Owner foo mluu /foo /Owner . 
Hope this helps, Michael Brundage xquery@comcast.net

Hi Mike (Luu), To me, this looks like a programming question rather than a comment on our specification. 
Would you agree that it does not need to be entered as a public comment, or do you think there is an issue with the XQuery language that needs to be tracked? 
If you post programming questions to www-ql@w3.org, that will help simplify our tracking of issues.

FYI, this is a programming question that i mistakenly posted on the public-qt-comments mailing list. 
nevertheless, thanks for all the help.
