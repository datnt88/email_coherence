Is anyone else concerned by the blatant promotion of Google on the W3C homepage? 
please note in the past there was merely a text label rather than a multi-coloured graphic. 
if the graphic is part of the 'google package' then the WAI homepage alternative should actively be promoted to the w3 webmaster. 
Google should also be informed, difficult for W3 as they actively promote text in graphics :-( It seems appalling to me that W3C is promoting what is in effect a fairly poor service, and an effective monopoly at that. 
It is not simple to find switch accessible sites for instance. 
Google offer a 'pay' service that avoids the need to provide a Google logo or link.

It's fairly standard practice at this point to include the small google graphic on any site that uses a google driven search. 
It lets you know at a glance which search engine you are dealing with. 
When used consistently across many sites, that adds to the usability of searching. 
My personal site has a google search with a google logo for exactly that reason.

Doesn't bother me either. 
I take it the same way Lynn does, telling the visitor which search engine is being used. 
On a note related to your other post I wouldn't have Alexa on my system. 
I consider it vastly inferior to Google so to each their own.
