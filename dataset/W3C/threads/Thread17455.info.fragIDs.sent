<s> Is anyone else concerned by the blatant promotion of Google on the W3C homepage?  </s>
<s> please note in the past there was merely a text label rather than a multi-coloured graphic.  </s>
<s> if the graphic is part of the 'google package' then the WAI homepage alternative should actively be promoted to the w3 webmaster.  </s>
<s> Google should also be informed, difficult for W3 as they actively promote text in graphics :-( It seems appalling to me that W3C is promoting what is in effect a fairly poor service, and an effective monopoly at that.  </s>
<s> It is not simple to find switch accessible sites for instance.  </s>
<s> Google offer a 'pay' service that avoids the need to provide a Google logo or link.  </s>

<s> It's fairly standard practice at this point to include the small google graphic on any site that uses a google driven search.  </s>
<s> It lets you know at a glance which search engine you are dealing with.  </s>
<s> When used consistently across many sites, that adds to the usability of searching.  </s>
<s> My personal site has a google search with a google logo for exactly that reason.  </s>

<s> Doesn't bother me either.  </s>
<s> I take it the same way Lynn does, telling the visitor which search engine is being used.  </s>
<s> On a note related to your other post I wouldn't have Alexa on my system.  </s>
<s> I consider it vastly inferior to Google so to each their own.  </s>
