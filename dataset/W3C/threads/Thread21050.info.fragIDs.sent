<s> Hi, I've had a repeating crash with Amaya 7.2 running under X windows/Mac OSX.  </s>
<s> The following sequence of events regularly produces a crash: Open: http://www.w3.org/2003/04/09-w3m.html Open in new window: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Team/w3mreq/2003Apr/ crash Most of the time when I re-start amaya I do not even get the option to recover.  </s>
<s> The crash log is attached.  </s>
<s> Thanks,  </s>
<s> Danny  </s>
<s> Interesting.  </s>
<s> Those two documents are locked.  </s>
<s> When I try to open them in sequence and press cancel when asked for authentication, after the second cancelled authentication the "Save as..." dialogue pops up, but Amaya does not crash (Amaya 7.2 Linux).  </s>

<s> Hello Danny,  </s>
<s> We don't have a Mac version of Amaya and the Linux and Windows versions don't crash with those documents.  </s>
<s> Do other Mas users (Charles, Carine,... ?) can test the same scenario with Amaya 7.2 or later and give us more info about this bug (that occurs when Amaya loads a style sheet, as mentionned in the crash log).  </s>
<s> Thanks in advance Laurent  </s>
<s> Hi Laurent, Thanks for your reply.  </s>
<s> Perhaps some of the other Mac folks have some experience here?  </s>
<s> As an aside: If we could get Apple to donate a Mac to you, would that help?  </s>
<s> Might you even consider doing a native OSX build?  </s>
<s> Thanks again, Danny  </s>
<s> Yes, it would be helpfull to improve the robustness of Mac versions.  </s>
<s> Irene and Vincent just got some funds from INRIA to hiring an engineer to work on a native OSX version of Amaya and on the user interface.  </s>
<s> This contract will start in September.  </s>
<s> Be patient !  </s>
<s> Thanks Laurent  </s>
<s> Laurent, this is great news about OSX.  </s>
<s> I'll certainly be patient until then.  </s>
<s> Thanks, Danny  </s>
<s> Hi folks,  </s>
<s> I could not reproduce that crash, no hint :/ Carine Bournez -+- W3C Sophia-Antipolis  </s>
<s> thanks for checking.  </s>
<s> Is there a way to change the memory allocation available to X? Would that make any difference?  </s>
<s> danny  </s>
<s> I don't think there's a limit in OSX, unless you use some ulimit.  </s>
<s> But does your X11 crashes at the same time amaya crashes?  </s>
<s> I don't know if it's relevant or not, but I did not update apple's X11 to last release yet.  </s>
<s> I will do it next week, then I could test again.  </s>
