Is it possible to use the keyboard file to define shortcuts for the various graphics functions available on the palette? 
These aren't available via the menus either, so I have to use a mouse to put them there (then I canedit the attributes directly). 
What would be nice is to have a default placement when they are selected from teh keyboard, and the ability to move them around before "fixing" them in place. 
This is similar to the functionality that used to exist for making links via the keyboard - I could use the navigation keys to move around the document (and between documents) to get to what I wanted to link to. 
Then I had to mouse-click to make the link there. 
If it was only one key (such as space) that triggered the dialog asking for a URI, could this be enabled again, with the addition of a key to anchor the link to wherever the cursor had got to?

Not yet. 
Right. 
This is an item of the future work on the SVG editing. 
The better way will be to register "what you wanted to link to" first.

This would also be good. 
But being able to use the existing mechanism and interface via the keyboard would still be pretty cool.
