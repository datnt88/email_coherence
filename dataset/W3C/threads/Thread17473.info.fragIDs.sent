<s> I'd be interested to see information on screen reader market share.  </s>
<s> I'm  </s>
<s> consulting with a UK Internet bank presently, and we are testing in  </s>
<s> Window-Eyes 4.5, JAWS 5.0, JAWS 4.5 and IBM HomePage Reader 3.0.  </s>
<s> You get problems with the default settings in each configuration, and slightly  </s>
<s> different HTML code is required to make site features work well in each one.  </s>
<s> Often there are conflicts, where the code that works well in JAWS causes a  </s>
<s> rendering issue in Window-Eyes, or vice versa.  </s>
<s> While I don't believe in trying to design the accessible experience (because it's impossible :), where there are conflicts I tend to lean towards the JAWS 4.5 rendering if there are choices to be made, because I estimate that this is the largest user base.  </s>
<s> In six months time, that may not be the case, and this is why information about market share would be useful.  </s>
<s> It's a situation analogous to the old dilemmas facing web designers when we cared about NN4 versus IE4 rendering of pages.  </s>
<s> That was solved as the modern browsers began supporting the standards more consistently, so that the latest versions of IE, NN, Opera, Mozilla, and so on all render pages 95% consistently or better.  </s>
<s> Since the screen readers differ so much in their rendering of standard HTML constructs, there are necessary decisions to be made.  </s>
<s> If there were no conflicts, I wouldn't care so much about market share.  </s>
<s> Perhaps in a few years the manufacturers of screen readers will get their act together, but in the meantime the reality is that someone will always get a poorer experience, and web designers are back to juggling the numbers  </s>
<s> again to decide which way to jump for each design choice.  </s>
<s> Incidentally, I'm talking about screen readers here because they have rendering differences that affect the user experience in significant ways, and are highly affected by small differences in the coding of a page.  </s>
<s> Screen magnifiers typically are not, for example, so that's why I'm talking about screen readers in particular.  </s>
<s> Anyone else wrestled with screen reader rendering differences, and have any tips?  </s>

<s> Actually, what *I* was going for with my comment on screen reader stats was  </s>
<s> to place the emphasis on technology as a whole rather than screen readers  </s>
<s> specifically due to the variance in environments and configuration  </s>
<s> preferences.  </s>
<s> you cannot possibly second guess every one so rather than try  </s>
<s> to figure out who uses the most of this or that, it's best to take an  </s>
<s> approach that provides for the broadest access possible as you say in your  </s>

<s> I am sure we all agree that  </s>

<s> What the heck are we bothering with all this for, if that is not our core belief?  </s>
<s> What I am not clear on is the connection that is being made between  </s>
<s> optimising the user experience for one group of users with "leaving  </s>
<s> out" a lot of others.  </s>
<s> These are not the same thing.  </s>
<s> Here's an analogy.  </s>
<s> A film is broadcast in widescreen.  </s>
<s> Those people with older TV sets (me, for example) either get black bars top and bottom, or the left and right edges are cropped, or a mixture of both.  </s>
<s> Those users who spent money on a widescreen TV may see the film in its proper format.  </s>
<s> But if it's broadcast in a modified 4:3 version, it's the users with widescreen TVs who get cropping, or black bars, or a  </s>
<s> stretched picture.  </s>
<s> This time the widescreen tv users lose out, and the users of older TVs don't have an incentive to upgrade.  </s>
<s> Either way, everyone gets to see the film; some have a better experience than others.  </s>
<s> The analogy is not an exact comparison to JAWS versus Window-Eyes, for example, because only a few of the problems arise because Window-Eyes is broken.  </s>
<s> Most differences are quirks, and you can't use the analogy of upgrading like you can with browsers.  </s>
<s> Although WE bugs me frequently, I do acknowledge that it is a quality piece of software.  </s>
<s> However, I think the analogy illustrates my two main points:  </s>
<s> 1. we are not excluding anyone.  </s>
<s> I am talking about relatively fine differences in user experience... tweaking; optimising.  </s>
<s> 2. whatever you do in these cases, someone will lose out a little  </s>
<s> You seem to be saying we should optimize for no screen reader over  </s>
<s> another but I can't see, for example, how that helps me choose between  </s>
<s> two valid, alternative ways of coding a navigation bar, each of which  </s>
<s> creates issues for someone.  </s>
<s> I want perfect for everyone, but sometimes  </s>
<s> there is no perfect.  </s>
<s> Then, I have to choose, and market share is one  </s>

<s> how do you handle screen readers such as EMACSpeak...??? or those that  </s>
<s> just read the plain text from the screen (many older systems) these require that the output be ONLY plain text.  </s>
