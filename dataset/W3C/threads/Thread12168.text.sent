I am in the process of republishing the techniques document as a group draft so we can work on it more easily. 
Things I am doing: seperating it into multiple pages - for example the evaluation techniques are essentially their own page, and there is a page of introduction, status, how to use this document, etc. 
(In part this should help with editing) Adding a table of contents. 
This was a major hassle in the last version. 
trying to regularise the markup again so when we publish this as a TR draft the links from ATAG 1 work fine. 
working on the multiple views stuff. 
At this stage I am hoping to have something published on Wednesday.

There are lots of broken links, or links going to the wrong place. 
There isn't yet a references document anywhere in the collection, nor a glossary. 
There are a bunch of errors in the text and document metadata - wrong editors assigned, wrong section numbers and so on. 
The links from the table of contents on the first page should work, but links to individual checkpoints might stil turn up broken anchors. 
So where do we go now: I will work on fixing the links because they are important. 
I will work on text mistakes as I find them, but will not go looking for them yet. 
I will add a references document and glossary. 
I will add the missing techniques for 4.1 and 4.2 and links to the appendix. 
I will write up the markup conventions that are important so editors know what not to mess around with. 
So please read it before the Monday meeting, and let's talk about how to move forward on it. 
(If you know the text of the previous draft there are few changes - this is mostly a structural re-write. 
If not, might as well go through the lot).

I have now included glossary and references, and tried to make all the navigation linking work right. 
I have not yet incorporated the AERT stuff (I plan to do that before the meeting monday, or shortly afterwards) in guideline 4, and I suspect there are still odd errors around. 
I have not yet written up the markup conventions, but here are some clues: there is a standard template for each page, including linking information, navigation bars, and titles. 
The actual content is (theoretically - I think there is one missing still) in a single div. 
In some cases (such as glossary and references) this is to automate generation from other documents via some XSLT. 
Each checkpoint has a name/id which is consistent throughout and is consistent with ATAG 1 and with wombat (in case where a checkpoint has moved, the anchor name has not changed, so links to a technique for it will still go there). 
The document is (naturally enough) valid XHTML 1.0 written according to the compatibility with HTML guidelines. 
The sections are numbered - 0 is the cover page, 1-7 are implementation techniques for guidelines 1-7, 8 is evaluation techniques, 9 is glossary, 10 is references, and there is an appendix A on prompting. 
Note that I haven't updated the AUWG page yet, and it is 5 am so I am not going to do it now. 
Please use the URI above until the AUWG page points to the 1 August version of techniques. 
Cheers Charles
