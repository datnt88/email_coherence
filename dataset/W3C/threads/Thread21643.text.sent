I have not proposed any details of URI encoding. 
I am proposing guidelines on the URI-to-resource mapping. 
Nevertheless, I would accept text in the Primer. 
Have you seen the section in part 2 [1] that talks about how parameters that are used to identify resources should be part of the URI? 
This is entirely independent of the request method used (in HTTP-speak), just saying that parameters that in some sense identify a resource should when possible be part of the URI. 
This has nothing to do with GET or URI encoding schemes or any other issue under recent discussion. 
It is just a restatement of a standard Web architecture principle in a SOAP context. 
"An important principle of Web architecture is that all important resources be identifiable by URI." Does this address your concern?

Okay, I agree with that section and agree that it is highly related to my issue. 
There is one important part I do not understand. 
Why is this "best practice" under the title "RPC" in both the SOAP primer and the SOAP Part 2? If you were using a pure document-style of interaction would not the same best practice apply? 
I believe that SOAP's definition of RPC is: "the exchange of messages that map conveniently to definitions and invocations of method and procedure calls in commonly used programming languages". 
If so, why would proper use of URIs on the Web and in HTTP be tied to RPC? 
As you know, many of us see disciplined HTTP usage as an *alternative* to RPC! Until I hear back, I consider this a bug, but my level of stridency on the issue will depend upon the cost of fixing it. 
The primer, especially, seems quite easy to fix (at least technically, I don't know about procedurally). 
Merely replace the word "RPC" with "message" or "message exchanges" (or some more appropriate word of your choice). 
"Conveying web-friendly message exchanges" and "There are many instances where message exchanges are designed for uses which..." If something like that were done I would not push for any changes to the normative specification. 
Also, the primer section is a little bit confusingly written in that it seems as if 3.1.3 is entirely about "pure information retrieval" applications until you get close to the end. 
If it is still possible to do some re-arrangement that does not change the meaning then I would be glad to propose alternate text.

Because a major difference between RPC and the Web is that RPC doesn't provide the concept of identifying resources with URIs which is why the section starts: "The World Wide Web identifies resources with URIs, but common programming conventions convey identification information in the arguments to procedures, or in the names of those procedures." 
That is, in plain old HTTP, it is the common mode of operation to identify resources using URIs. 
Yeah, I have heard about the goals of HTTP ;) From a spec point of view, I actually think this does address the issue. 
If you believe there are editorial improvements to the primer then I suggest you generate a new issue as this is somewhat different from this issue. 
Thanks, Henrik Perhaps, but not in common SOAP+HTTP usage. 
Some toolkits do not even make this feasible. 
Okay, I've just sent a note to xmlp-comments. 
You may close this one.

Ok, maybe they will be taken over by more general kits over time. 
Thanks! 
Henrik Paul, To close the loop on issue 226, you have agreed to close this issue [1], and open a new issue based on your new message to XMLP comments [2]. 
The new issue is #295 [3].
