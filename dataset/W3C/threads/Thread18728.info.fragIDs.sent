Hello, 
A colleague asked me if I was aware of any user agents that support MathML and that are accessible to users with blindness. 
I welcome any advice that I may forward to my colleague. 
It may also be that there are accessible solutions for putting math on the Web that don't involve MathML; if so, please let me know. 
It would also be valuable to conduct a UAAG 1.0 evaluation on a MathML user agent. 
Thank you, _ Ian Ian Jacobs (ij@w3.org)

DeLong (3 Mar 2003) on some attempts to make math accessible on the Web 2) Mozilla seems to support both MathML and APIs for access by screen readers: Refer to: And MathML in list of supported specs: I don't have any experience with Mozilla and MathML, however. 
Comments and suggestions from Mozilla folks welcome.

Hello, Unfortunately, although Mozilla supports accessibility APIs, as well as DOM extensions to accessibility APIs, there are no screen readers available yet that take advantage of this fact. 
We're getting pretty close with Window-Eyes, but Window-Eyes uses MSAA, and there is nothing in MSAA which contains support mathemetical objects. 
GW Micro, or another screen reader vendor that develops compatibility with Mozilla, would have to decide that it's a priority and go to the directly DOM nodes for the MathML info. 
I doubt this would happen without some kind of major grant. 
Screen magnifiers will probably have much better luck, because they won't have to translate the structure into a voice or Braille stream .... :/ I believe that it would be great to support MathML, and even SVG, via a 
screen reader on top of Gecko/Mozilla, but I'm afraid we're not very close to it yet.

Emacspeaks[1] I believe supports rendering of MathML in speech.
