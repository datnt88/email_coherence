<s> Hmmm, I am notusre that metadata is yet at the accessibility requirement stage.  </s>
<s> So I will waffle briefly on the topic.  </s>
<s> For those uninterested, stop here grin/ There are requirements to provide access to various parts of content.  </s>
<s> There is not, as Kynn pointed out, an explicit requirement in WCAG to identify how accessibility is achieved, which is one area where metadata woulod be an extremely powerful technique.  </s>
<s> It is possible that the requirement should be there, but in many cases it can also be done simply by using markup according to specification (for example, the alt attribute on the img element is explicitly described as an alternative, as is longdesc.  </s>
<s> the title attribute on an abbreviation is a bit less clear from the HTML 4.0 spec...).  </s>
<s> Providing access to content via a site map, structured content, etc, can all be achieved by using metadata, and some of the really cool applications are things like automatic site maps, and navigation that builds links by hunting metadata from around the web.  </s>
<s> But this is a technique not a requirement.  </s>
<s> I think what will finally make the difference is implementation (in this as  </s>
<s> in so many facets of accessibility).  </s>
<s> If every browser for the last year had come out with a metadata parser and renderer, then it might be the only sensible way to do this.  </s>

<s> Do you believe it should be a P1 because it is important and good, or because it strictly follows the definition of priority 1 in WCAG 1.0, which means that certain identifiable groups of people with disabilities will be _absolutely unable_ to access content if it is not indexed but otherwise follows all other WCAG standards for accessibility?  </s>

<s> To me, this illustrates a weakness in the P1/P2/P3 system; there are some things which I believe _must_ be done but which are not P1 items -- the solution is not to redefine them as P1 by ignoring our own fuzzy definition, but instead to create a firmer definition of what P1 means.  </s>

<s> ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE  </s>
<s> I think we need to be careful about the terminology here; age (old or young) is not a disability, it's merely a state of being.  </s>
<s> Disabilities are a state of being as well, but are a specific  </s>
<s> subset.  </s>
<s> The arguments for "increased accessibility for people with disabilities" are weakened whenever we adopt a well-meaning principle that makes most people effectively "disabled."  </s>
<s> For example, if I claimed I was "disabled" because I am about 30 lbs overweight, or because I need glasses to see, or because I never learned how to play the piano, then the definition of disability loses its meaning and power.  </s>
<s> While that may seem like a good thing -- realizing that we all have varying abilities -- it also serves to engender skepticism in many people who will look at the so-called "disability" and then conclude that most anyone claiming a disability may have as weak a claim as mine.  </s>
<s> This has been seen before, in the US, when dealing with people who need public support to avoid starving.  </s>
<s> Because there are visible, but rare, cases of welfare abuse, many people have decided that welfare itself is wrong because all it does is help lazy cheats who want a free ride -- even though the majority of people on the public dole are honest people who simply lack money or the ability to earn it.  </s>
<s> Now, that's not to say that age isn't a condition we should concern ourselves with -- at Edapta, we consider aged users to be a primary target demographic for our edaptations -- but to declare that the state of being aged is inherently a disability will just confuse the issue.  </s>
<s> Especially as there are a number of age-related changes which are not "disabling" at all, but rather just simply -differences- (such as cognitive changes related to age) -- and especially as the specific effects of age will vary by person.  </s>
<s> When someone becomes disabled -- due to age or otherwise -- then clearly they fall into the realm of someone with a disability!  </s>

<s> Only if by so claiming you are creating that "definition".  </s>
<s> The things you cite don't qualify either with a formal definition or a common-sense one.  </s>
<s> OTOH aging is so closely associated with almost inevitable "ability decrements" that it really does qualify.  </s>

<s> By taking up an issue as broad as 'indexing' we risk credibility.  </s>
<s> Marti  </s>
<s> I think you're right, to some extent, but I think this is why we need to justify our checkpoints and guidelines as explicitly overcoming existing barriers for identifiable groups of users with disabilities.  </s>
<s> A general statement of "indexing is good" is true, and a statement of "indexing is good for everyone" is true, and therefore a statement of "indexing is good for any given subgroup of everyone " is true -- "indexing is good for baseball fans", for example.  </s>
<s> However, it is incumbent upon us to identify how exactly indexing provides additional benefits beyond those imparted to a general audience, for an identifiable user group with one or more disabilities.  </s>
<s> "Indexing is good for people with disabilities" is quite obviously true, just as "...for baseball fans" is true.  </s>
<s> But for indexing to be an accessibility feature, we need to do a little more work and tell _how_ it benefits someone with a disability.  </s>
<s> For example, "indexing is of benefit to people with certain disabilities for whom navigation schemes may prove unwieldy, even if the navigation system is designed well".  </s>
<s> Indexing could be thought of as an alternate navigation scheme which allows blind users (for example) to bypass navigation-by-hierarchy (as with Yahoo) and jump directly to information.  </s>
<s> As Marti has pointed out, this can be iffy -- which is why I think  </s>
<s> we might even need better examples or justification than I can provide.  </s>
<s> There is a danger in making too broad of guidelines; in making "do good web design" guidelines instead of accessibility guidelines.  </s>
<s> People will come to the web accessibility initiative looking for accessibility guidelines; they need a definitive and accurate source.  </s>
<s> If we make this too broad, then we lose much of our authority and the strength inherent in our guidelines -- and most importantly, we may lose sight of the human aspect of accessibility.  </s>
<s> As much as it is important for there to be someone or some group advocating "good web design", it's even more important that people with disabilities have _their_ voice.  </s>
<s> There is a danger in becoming so generic that those unique voices get lost in the crowd, as we (WAI) are one of the few organizations who can speak for/as them on technical issues of web design.  </s>

<s> I hate to play pragmatist to this crowd, but an overly ambitious standard simply won't gain traction.  </s>
<s> As these guidelines approach the more labor-intensive and stringent, fewer organizations, corporations, governmental bodies, etc., will adopt them, fewer sites will be made accessible, and the end result is that less content, not more, will be made truly accessible.  </s>

<s> Sorry, missed that.  </s>
<s> RDF is easy to generate, and/or extract from HTML, but it's best use comes in describing "pure" XML.  </s>
<s> As I see more and more XML applications and langauges being banded about, they invariably don't have decent metadata frameworks included with them (even XHTML is inadequate with its meta elements).  </s>
<s> RDF provides that framework for anyone wanting to add indexing to their pages.  </s>
<s> As for a lack of tools, have a look at Dave Beckett's site: http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/discovery/rdf/resources  </s>
<s> It may be that such indexing is provided for accessibility tools of the future that read accessibility claims written in EDL etc.  </s>

<s> I'm afraid I read ahead a few years too far in the RDF history into where metadata is being read and processed by intelligent agent technologies to find data for the user as "indexing".  </s>
<s> (The word "indexing" cross-references "Index Server" in my head, which is a big mismatch.) Clearly, the time for that is not now,  </s>

<s> If the guideline were to say, "use indexing technologies to (foo)", I think that, at least, the techniques document would have to say "by indexing technologies, we mean RDF, done like this," until something better comes along.  </s>
<s> The technology independence plank, I believe, is to allow for entropy in data.  </s>
<s> Entropy in metadata is a whole other ball of wax, potentially preventing the proposed guideline from achieving its desired effect, and if we don't say what we mean here, that's what we'll get.  </s>
<s> I can think of two offhand: - Labor-intensive for users with legacy content.  </s>
<s> I'd prefer that user agents that need or desire WCAG compliance metadata look for it in a certain place (e.g., ./wcag.xml), and designers can override it if they like with a link .  </s>
<s> (A perhaps welcome side-effect here is that non-compliant content providers will begin to see how many users they have with assistive technologies, simply by tracking 404s.) engines.  </s>
<s> The contents of the average meta description tag are questionable because many content providers exploit them for best results in the engines, not for accurately describing the data within.  </s>
