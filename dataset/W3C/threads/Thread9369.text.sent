As I won't be there, can I request that a reference to this message be entered into the IRC log of the meeting, for the record? 
11: Postpone syntax issues The aim here is to quickly resolve those issues for which there is clear concensus. 
If extended discussion is needed, we will postpone the decision. 
Propose the WG RESOLVE that the following issues be postponed for consideration by a future WG See: OK OK [I missed this when it was raised] I like this proposal, as it makes much more intuitive sense to me, and leverages existing developer understanding of toString() in existing programming languages. 
Assuming it's consistent with any decisions about datatyping, I think there would be value to our current charter in adopting this. 
To deal with backward compatibility, I'd suggest that rdf:value be retained as a "deprecated" form, equivalent to rdf:toString, which becomes the preferred form. 
Thus, my vote is AGAINST deciding to defer this issue to a new WG at this time. 
I think the proposal should be accepted or rejected by this WG. 
I think deferring this issue would effectively be equivalent to accepting and fixing the status quo; i.e. URI formation by concatenation. 
I think this is a decision that this WG should face, not defer. 
OK OK. (I think it's fine that the syntax cannot represent any graph; if such a syntax is required, I think it's clearly an issue for a future WG.) #g Graham Klyne MIMEsweeper Group Strategic Research http://www.mimesweeper.com

If extended discussion is needed, we will postpone the decision. 
Propose the WG RESOLVE that the following issues be postponed for consideration by a future WG See: If it is being considered, then I vote to REJECT it, for reasons that I hope will become clear when I get the MT datatyping document finished. 
(Basically, the appropriate interpretation of rdf:value in the new MT is that it is simply identity, and the 'toString' name is then actively misleading. 
This view of the meaning of rdf:value has built into it a view about datatyping that I want to argue against, basically one which assumes that all literals occurrences are strings. 
I think that it only makes intuitive sense if one agrees to read all literals as referring to themselves, which, I will argue, embodies a use/mention confusion which is neither semantically productive nor necessary.)

This would be fine by me (modulo actually seeing and understanding the proposal). 
I think Aaron said it better. 
I don't think this is an issue that should be postponed.

Graham Klyne said: The issue http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-replace-value is recorded as: Suggestion that the rdf:value property be replaced by rdf:toString. 
So I propose that: We reject this suggestion as an unnecessary change ACTION the model theory editor (Pat) to explain what rdf:value means ACTION the primer editor (Eric) to ensure that a description of how to use rdf:value is included. 
Are there any objections to this form of words? 
This won't be on this weeks meeting agenda due to it being all for datatyping. 
If this is acceptible, I'll bring it up next week. 
Dave Graham Klyne said: Yes. 
Datatyping and rdf:value are still subject of discussion. 
I'd reword the first ACTION as: to propose an interpretation of rdf:value for discussion by WG (to my knowledge, Pat is working on it already).
