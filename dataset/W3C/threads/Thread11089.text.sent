I can use Western digits in my names. 
A Martian should be free to use Martian digits in their names. 
Are you proposing to allow them as the first character of a name? 
Are they letters or digits? 
The question is not whether they are letters or digits in limbo, but whether they appear in common words. 
In English I can have element type identifiers "first", "second", "third", etc. 
The equivalent Japanese of these would (if my imperfect knowledge doesn't embarrass me too much) be spelled using ideagraphs numbers, no matter what counter suffix was used. 
Similarly, I could have an element type identifier "miscellaneous" in English, but in Japanese I might wish to use "gomoku" (as in yakisoba :-), whether the "go" is 5. Personally, I can see no great value in allowing anything other than [01-9] as DIGIT in SGML and XML. 
It just seems to complicate things, and IMHO is a spurious and unthinking kind of i18n. 
[01-9] conveys all the meaning needed, and everyone understands it. 
Making the ideograph numbers into SGML/XML DIGITs means that users of native-language markup will be forced to use second-best terms, or to spell out kanji in kana, for many common words. 
Rick Jelliffe I completely and very strongly agree with Rick. 
Fortunately, the current draft assumes the idegraphic character representing digits as ideographic characters rather than digits, right? 
I found that [#xFF10-#xFF19] /* Fullwidth digits */ are allowed as digits. 
Since the compatibility zone has no place in markups, this should be removed, anyway.

I also agree that these should be removed.
