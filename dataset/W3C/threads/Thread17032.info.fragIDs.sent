<s> Probably what I need are javascript commands for Netscape since it is not as proprietary as Microsoft Internet Explorer commands.  </s>
<s> My goals are bear bones functionality regarding the navigation of links to start with.  </s>
<s> I have seen a number of sites that would probably work reasonably well with the lynx browser if only the  </s>
<s> navigation and selection of links worked.  </s>
<s> I would like to at least get things to the point where something happens when one selects a link on a site that uses javascript.  </s>
<s> Many times, the underlying pages are straight html  </s>
<s> but the links are relative links and the lynx browser doesn't know what to do with them.  </s>
<s> That is my goal for now.  </s>
<s> We'll worry about what still doesn't work after the links work and so on.  </s>
<s> This all reminds me of a huge tangle of string or wire that doesn't go anywhere until one finds just the right part of the knot and it all begins to straighten out.  </s>

<s> Netscape 4 is probably more proprietary and Netscape 6 less, however there is a standard as defined by w3.org.  </s>

<s> neither of which are in any standard, would open a huge number of very poorly authored sites.  </s>
<s> Personally I find Microsofts documentation the clearest:  </s>

<s> dow.asp and: sp  </s>
<s> (the functionality of those objects are basically fixed across all javascript capable browsers other than window.open,  </s>
<s> however a window open which provided links would be very useful.  </s>
<s> Implementing those 3 would open up the majority of pages, next would probably be a form.submit() to cope with forms you can't otherwise submit.  </s>

<s> And which is what will be the real problem for Lynx as Lynx's internal document object model doesn't look much like that of the big 2; that's why people will say that adding Javascript is a major re-write.  </s>
<s> Technically, neither of these are parts of the DOM, they are parts of the browser object model as they are to do with browser automation; however, DOM0 is so fuzzy that it tends to cover them.  </s>
<s> I prefer the PDF files from Netscape, but don't have the URLs to hand.  </s>
<s> Although this will cover a fair amount, a lot of pages will use the Netscape or IE specific bits, and some more recent ones will even use W3C's DOM1 (which works on IE5, although a lot of authors are probably not aware of this, as they treat NS6 as the special case and continue to  </s>
<s> use document.all  </s>
<s> for IE5).  </s>
<s> Pages that come up completely blank often are  </s>
<s> doing a test to decide whether to use the IE or NS4 proprietory features.  </s>
<s> Specifically, they tend to branch between NS4 layers and IE5 document.all  </s>

<s> and with appropriate object detection can cause no errors, the arguments (which I support) for using DOM1 are purely standards based rather than any expectation of working for the most users.  </s>
<s> In any case as using W3's DOM still requires using proprietary the requirement to use standards is slightly flawed.  </s>
<s> features.  </s>
<s> Yes, but mapping the location object to links in the page would solve that, even give you a choice, no need to implement any of those features.  </s>
<s> Jim.  </s>
<s> Mapping the location object, in that case, is potentially impossible, and in practice fairly difficult.  </s>
<s> It involves simultaneously executing all possible paths through the code.  </s>
<s> In the most general case, this is the halting problem, and is impossible in finite time, but in more practical cases it requires something other than a normal ECMA Script interpreter and rather more like (I think) Prolog, or a test coverage analysis tool.  </s>
<s> However, as much as anything, my point here was that, if you currently get a blank first page it probably means that the site authors believe that the site will be unuseable without browser specific extensions to DOM0, and will probably give a "please upgrade" page for the fallback  </s>
<s> case, if they have one.  </s>
<s> (Also, although document.all  </s>
<s> may have been implemneted by many minority browsers, it is for the same reason that Lynx would have to do it, namely  </s>
<s> that authors believe that there are only two brands of browser.  </s>
<s> As very  </s>
<s> few authors feature test for it, it also means forging the browser identity -  </s>
<s> something already common amongst Lynx users and which causes Lynx to be under-reported in statistics.)  </s>
<s> One thing I forgot to mention, is that, for reasonable coverage of real web sites, you will need bug-wise compatibility, e.g. the DOM is based on a parse tree for the document, so you will need the same syntax error fixups as IE (NS4 has never done a proper parse and its Javascript reflects this in that it only allows access to forms, controls and (proprietory) layers).  </s>

<s> features.  </s>
<s> Not at all, you run the script N times with the navigator object (and probably .all/.layers set appropriately for the NN4/IE4 simplistic object detection) set to spoof the N User Agents you want to spoof, okay that doesn't gaurantee all paths, but in practice it does cover all usage, and suffers no scripting problems - I have implemented such a script and it suffers from no problems and can easily identify the different links written into the script.  </s>
<s> Obviously some paths may not be found, but they are likely down to the author checking for some very strange browsers so you've probably got enough to be vaguely accessible.  </s>
<s> fallback  </s>
<s> I think that's complete rubbish, most authors aren't even aware what their script needs or doesn't need, and this browser detection is more about choosing which html/css hacks to use to make it look "right" in IE/NN.  </s>
<s> namely  </s>
<s> very  </s>

<s> The navigator object is very rarely used for statistical gathering and spoofing here would(especially multiple spoofing which I believe to be most appropriate for simply widening the pages lynx can at least access.  </s>
