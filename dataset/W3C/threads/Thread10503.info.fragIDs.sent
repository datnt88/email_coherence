<s> This is the usual weekly call for agenda items.  </s>
<s> We don't seem to have much incoming comment to deal with.  </s>
<s> I don't have other agenda items to table myself, so I'm considering cancelling but do send in suggestions if there are things you wish to discuss.  </s>

<s> I'd support cancelling, or having WG members make informal use of the telecon time.  </s>
<s> Am since monday back in Bristol (though still on west coast timezone it seems), and would be free to chair friday's call if topics appear.  </s>
<s> Let's see if topics emerge by midday UK time thurs, if not then cancel or use the slot for 'bar talk'.  </s>
<s> How many regrets do we have?  </s>
<s> Dan  </s>
<s> Cool. I'll leave in your hands.  </s>

<s> Hearing no proposals for a use for the time, and with JanG and Dave at least cheering in the wings, I hereby cancel friday's RDFCore WG telecon.  </s>
<s> Please spend the time in quiet contemplation of semweb logic layering and/or start your weekends early...  </s>
<s> cheers, Dan  </s>
<s> Me, I welcome the extra time, which I plan to use getting the initial test cases running for my framework for incorporating datatypes into an RDF inference process.  </s>
<s> I'm nearly there!  </s>

<s> Cool! Keep us posted :) Dan ps. the other thought re the timeslot was to have WG folks talk about where they see RDF/SW going, life after REC, apps, outreach etc.  </s>
<s> Perhaps another time...?  </s>
