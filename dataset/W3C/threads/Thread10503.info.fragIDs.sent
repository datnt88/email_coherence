This is the usual weekly call for agenda items. 
We don't seem to have much incoming comment to deal with. 
I don't have other agenda items to table myself, so I'm considering cancelling but do send in suggestions if there are things you wish to discuss.

I'd support cancelling, or having WG members make informal use of the telecon time. 
Am since monday back in Bristol (though still on west coast timezone it seems), and would be free to chair friday's call if topics appear. 
Let's see if topics emerge by midday UK time thurs, if not then cancel or use the slot for 'bar talk'. 
How many regrets do we have? 
Dan 
Cool. I'll leave in your hands.

Hearing no proposals for a use for the time, and with JanG and Dave at least cheering in the wings, I hereby cancel friday's RDFCore WG telecon. 
Please spend the time in quiet contemplation of semweb logic layering and/or start your weekends early... 
cheers, Dan 
Me, I welcome the extra time, which I plan to use getting the initial test cases running for my framework for incorporating datatypes into an RDF inference process. 
I'm nearly there!

Cool! Keep us posted :) Dan ps. the other thought re the timeslot was to have WG folks talk about where they see RDF/SW going, life after REC, apps, outreach etc. 
Perhaps another time...?
