<s> Hi Daniel Thanks for the reply, and pointing out what the guidelines say.  </s>
<s> I must admit that I think the guidelines are wrong :-( Forcing all automatically generated ALT information to contain a null string means that nobody is provided with information which can be useful in circumstances.  </s>
<s> To be it seems intuitively wrong for an authoring / conversion tool to throw away resource metadata.  </s>
<s> I would argue it would be better for the information to be provided and then filtered out if necessary.  </s>
<s> I'd also argue that the guidelines should at least say that authoring tools should provide options for creating null or automatically generated ALT text, so that an organisation has some choice in this matter (e.g. the BBC might choice to provide this information as they have their Betsie tool for stripping out information).  </s>

<s> I think you're being unfair in yopur response.  </s>
<s> An authoring tool has  </s>
<s> three  </s>
<s> options for providing defaults ALT values - give a null string, give a standard chunk of text "This is an image" or provide information automatically derived from the image file "Size =100 Kb".  </s>
<s> Of these alternatives, I think the latter is preferable.  </s>
<s> What concrete suggestion would you make to vendors of authoring tools?  </s>
<s> The WAI has a Working Group working on Guideliens for Authoring Tools, here's what they say in the latest draft (Jan 12) 2.5.8: [Priority 1] The authoring tool must never insert rule-generated description text into the document (default "alt"-text) or a properties field (place-holder "alt"-text).  </s>
<s> Automated processes may only place pre-authored (by a person) text when the meaning or function of the described object is known with certainty.  </s>
<s> In other word, default alt values is a no-no, mostly because it then makes it very hard for repair tools of all kind to do their job effectively, since they cannot really look for missing data.  </s>
<s> [I suggest this is the last message on this thread on IG, and this should continue on WAI AU group list]  </s>
<s> To be it seems intuitively wrong for an authoring / conversion tool to throw away resource metadata.  </s>
<s> This is equally wrong to use the ALT attributes to store metadata that is not meant to be there.  </s>
<s> I would argue it would be better for the information to be provided and then filtered out if necessary.  </s>
<s> But this would need more convention/syntax for the filtering to work (how to recognize this is metadata about the image, not the description).  </s>
<s> This is not impossible (use ALT with some specific sugar syntax recognized by all "FileName=foo.gif;  </s>
<s> FileSize= 100K" just it hasn't happen yet and it's also hackery more than good design (For Metadata, look at w3.org/Metadata, and RDF)  </s>
<s> I'd also argue that the guidelines should at least say that authoring tools should provide options for creating null or automatically generated ALT text, so that an organisation has some choice in this matter (e.g. the BBC might choice to provide this information as they have their Betsie tool for stripping out information).  </s>
<s> I agree ALT="" has some utility (for images with no function, like decoration) but content that is meant to be served as is, in HTML, should be correct HTML, and ALT=filesize is not right.  </s>
<s> In your example, Betsie is just one way of accessing BBC Online, so the HTML has to be correct in all cases.  </s>

<s> Hi Daniel Thanks for the message.  </s>
<s> On one level I agree with everything you say (i.e. there's a need for an architecturally coherent metadata framework ).  </s>
<s> On the other hand we sometimes need to be pragmatic.  </s>
<s> Let me give you an example.  </s>
<s> One could have a personalised web site in which access by people with disabilities came through a Betsie-type proxy, which could strip out confusing information such as file size.  </s>
<s> On the other hand file size metadata could be provided to those who need it.  </s>
<s> The process is not easily reversible.  </s>
<s> (Systems designers are likely to come up with more sophisticated "magic.")  </s>
<s> I would argue that the Page Author guidelines should be pragmatic.  </s>
<s> They can be updated to recommend storing such metadata in RDF - when the RDF schemas are defined and supporting tools available (which could well be several years away).  </s>
<s> My concrete suggestion is that: 2.5.8: [Priority 1] The authoring tool must never insert rule-generated description text into the document (default "alt"-text) or a properties field (place-holder "alt"-text).  </s>
<s> should say: "The authoring tool should normally not insert rule-generated description" and then explain why, but allow software vendors the options to allow automated ALT generation.  </s>
<s> I think this should be an educational issue rather than a WAI rule (I suspect that customers of authoring tools may pester software vendors for this facility).  </s>
<s> What do the software vendors think?  </s>

<s> Chuck Opperman asked for my input and here's how I responded....my understanding of the AU guidelines may be a little shaky...please correct me if I'm wrong:  </s>
<s> Here's an idea.  </s>
<s> The current Authoring Tool guidelines state that an Authoring Tool should not insert default text into the ALT attribute but should insert a null string by default.  </s>
<s> How about having FrontPage prompt the user to enter ALT attribute text with a dialog box and have the dialog box give them radio button options of 1) keeping it blank, 2) Inserting the Filename of the graphic without the extension, (ie if it's search.gif insert Search), or 3) Insert new text and have an input box for them to input the text.  </s>
<s> This gets around the problem of not adding a default as per the AU guidelines but guarentees all images will have ALT attributes.  </s>

<s> Hi,  </s>
<s> I'm not sure about presenting three different options to users who may lack previous exposure to accessibility issues.  </s>
<s> i.e.  </s>
<s> In this case option 1 looks to be the easiest.  </s>
<s> As far as the guidelines go, this idea is very low level.  </s>
<s> I think the guidelines should stick to higher level directives and let the tool-makers deal with how to implement them.  </s>
<s> Jan Richards jan.richards@utoronto.ca  </s>
<s> ATRC  </s>
<s> I'm inclined to agree but one of the problems I am dealing with regarding MS FrontPage's implementation of ALT attributes and the Mozilla group's implementation of various HTML elements and attributes in the new layout engine for NN 5.0 is that without some sort of SUGGESTION or guidance regarding the optimal way to implement this will lead the project team to pick some random means to display an element.  </s>
<s> This can lead to serious problems when the product is released all because that contact between recommendation editor and product manager has not been made.  </s>
<s> I also suggested a "warning" box pop up if a user uses a "blank" ALT attribute:  </s>
<s> Perhaps when the user chooses a null option ALT attribute, a prompt will  </s>
<s> say "Are you  </s>
<s> sure?  </s>
<s> People who use text-browsers, have images turned off, or visually impared users using screen readers will not be able to see this image."  </s>
<s> What are your thoughts on that?  </s>
