Hello - Internet Explorer 5 has shipped (available on the web 3/18) and I'm moving on and will no longer be handling accessibility for IE (still be on the IE team, though). 
Rob Relyea, Program Manager on the IE team, will be taking over these responsibilities. 
I'm bringing him up to speed on the current guidelines and will be introducing him around at CSUN next week. 
His Wednesday mornings are a little more flexible so he'll be able to attend the conference calls starting 3/24. 
It's been a great pleasure working with all of you and wish you the best of luck in completing the guidelines. 
Thx kathy 
Kathy, As chair I would like to thank you for your participation in the User Agent Guidelines and wish you well in your new endeavors at Microsoft.
