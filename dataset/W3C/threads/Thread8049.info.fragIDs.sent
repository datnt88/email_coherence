<s> I strongly object to adding a MUST for servers returning slash terminated URLs for collections.  </s>
<s> Most repositories do not allow trailing segment-separator characters in the segment name of a resource, and therefore these trailing segment-separator characters are commonly just stripped off before that segment name is stored in the repository.  </s>
<s> This means that in order to decide whether to add the segement-separator character back on, the implementation must query the repository for the type of each resource identified by that segment.  </s>
<s> Forcing this cost on the server is only justified if it provides some compelling benefit to the client.  </s>
<s> The only concrete motivation I have heard for making this requirement is to save a 302 redirect round trip for a client when the server redirects a GET request on a collection to an internal member of the request-URL (e.g. redirects "GET /foo" to "GET /foo/index.html").  </s>
<s> Having the trailing slash present in the request-URL allows the server to silently redirect the request to the internal member of the request-URL without breaking client-side relative reference processing.  </s>
<s> But no WebDAV methods other than GET is redirected in this fashion, and WebDAV clients will commonly not be doing a GET on a collection (they will be doing a PROPFIND, and use the results to construct a display), and so the overall benefit to a client of avoiding a redirect on a GET to a collection is significantly outweighed by the server cycles being wasted to determine whether or not a collection member is a collection.  </s>
<s> If a client cares whether or not a resource is a collection, it can do a PROPFIND for its DAV:resourcetype.  </s>
<s> That way, server cycles are spent only when needed.  </s>

<s> - Servers must use trailing slash whenever collection URLs are returned.  </s>
<s> Language proposed for 2518 bis  </s>
<s> I'll try to recall more of the interop issues around using trailing slashes in collection URLs.  </s>

<s> Yes, the server must know the type of each resource in order to construct its URL properly.  </s>
<s> Or the repository could save or cache the URL for each resource.  </s>
<s> There are lots of options.  </s>
<s> There are other problems encountered and discussed at the interop.  </s>
<s> In fact, the GET/redirect problem is one of the least troublesome because it's just a performance problem, not (typically) an interoperability problem.  </s>
<s> - Clients aren't consistent in supporting redirects for other methods  </s>
<s> besides GET.  </s>
<s> Yet if the client sends a bad Request-URI (a collection  </s>
<s> path without a trailing slash), the server needs to do something.  </s>
<s> - Servers aren't consistent in putting the trailing slash in various places: the Content-Location header, the Location header, and href elements inside Multi-Status.  </s>
<s> Clients need to look for the trailing slash and possibly add it in order to be able to do further operations.  </s>
<s> E.g. clients would like to be able to display results consistently in folder views, yet servers aren't consistent.  </s>
<s> - Clients need to know how to generate a correct URL for a MKCOL, PUT, MOVE or COPY to create a new resource in an existing collection.  </s>
<s> This means parsing the collection URL to make sure it ends in a slash before adding the terminal part.  </s>
<s> First, this is an issue not only for GET.  </s>
<s> The problems with other methods are not just redirects, but how the client constructs URLs for new resources.  </s>
<s> Second, it's a matter of opinion what situation has what benefits and which wastes cycles where.  </s>
<s> Certainly avoiding redirects improves performance for the client because it reduces roundtrips.  </s>
<s> Also providing correct URLs saves cycles on the client although that's usually less of a concern.  </s>
<s> Note that for some servers, a redirect is higher cost than just making the URLs correct, because a redirect is an entirely new request, new database or filesystem query, etc.  </s>
<s> It's not only that the client cares what type of resource the URL refers to, although knowing that is nice.  </s>
<s> It's also how to construct correct new URLs and how to interpret the results of a PROPFIND.  </s>
<s> Since there have been actual interoperability problems, I still find this a good candidate for making the specification clearer, even if this is a few more cycles on the server.  </s>
<s> Real interoperability problems are much worse problems than a minor increased burden on the server.  </s>
<s> Lisa  </s>
<s> returned.  </s>
<s> That's simply not true.  </s>
<s> Most repositories store the type of a resource along with the resource name in the collection (a.k.a. directory) and thus that information is available at the time the segment is used within a link describing the collection at no extra cost to the server.  </s>
<s> All other repositories are fully capable of improving their internal implementation.  </s>
<s> OTOH, the protocol specification is responsible for specifying that which is clearly most efficient for the protocol and for those servers that have already anticipated its implementation.  </s>
