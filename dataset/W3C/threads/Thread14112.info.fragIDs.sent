<s> Hi, This morning I was meeting with technology people at a bank about some technology access issues.  </s>
<s> One topic which came up was about the trend towards personalized web pages for customers like at MyYahoo, etc.  </s>
<s> One of the questions was how to make it easy to use by blind people.  </s>
<s> I basically said that there are different views of the issues.  </s>
<s> Some blind people want to use the same web pages as sighted people even if they are harder to use.  </s>
<s> Other blind people prefer that web pages be easy to use.  </s>
<s> (As one blind user quipped "I'm willing to show the world one day a month that I can use the same web pages as sighted if I can have the rest of the month to take the easy route".  </s>
<s> ) Now, if a bank can generate the personalized web pages in different languages to make it more convenient for the customer, why shouldn't the bank  </s>
<s> also generate the personalized web pages to be as easy to use as possible by blind users?  </s>
<s> If the personalized web pages for blind users are designed  </s>
<s> to be as easy to use by as wide a range of blind customers as possible, that would mean that blind users with less cognitive skill or access technology acumen would also have their needs addressed.  </s>
<s> From a business perspective, doesn't it make sense to include as many customer needs as possible in the design?  </s>
<s> As one bank person asked, how many customers would reject a service because it is too simple to use?  </s>

<s> i, too, have been investigating online banking myself recently, and the problems aren't presentational -- they are structural -- including (but not limited to) the misuse of structural elements to achieve presentational effects; the failure to provide textual equivalents for multimedia objects (in particular, failure to provide ALT text for graphically defined links, or for the AREAs defined for image maps); the use of style to convey meaning (i.e. changes in font color on forms to indicate required fields); etc. therefore, i think you mis-characterize the issue when you write: quote  </s>

<s> to have page authors concerned first and foremost with structure and content, so as to achieve a universally accessible and interoperable underlying structure for the document with which individual users can then interact according to their own preferences, as expressed either by the author's stylesheet or by a custom (local) stylesheet... it's not a question of wanting quote to use the same web pages as sighted people even if they are harder to use unquote, but, rather, of ensuring that the structure and content is uniform and completely expressed, no matter the modality of whatever style is overlaid the structure and content... the point is -- give me equal access to all of the content you wish to provide a generic visitor, in a consistent and well structured format, and leave the stylistic presentation to stylesheets, period  </s>

<s> Hi, Gregory Have you had a chance to look at the demo web pages I've put up?  </s>
<s> They are actually good examples of the difference between structuring a web page on the basis of the semantic or concepts being conveyed by the page versus structuring a web page for visual interest or impact.  </s>
<s> The point you might have missed in my comments was that focus of the conversation was on web pages personalized for each customer.  </s>
<s> Personalized web pages is applying the technology of dynamically generated web pages to create web pages specialized for the particular user requesting the page.  </s>
<s> This might include languages, layout, colors, stock quotes, news articles, etc.  </s>
<s> The online banking is old technology compared to what is now being cooked up.  </s>
<s> Something, I'm not quite sure I'm conveying very well is that style  </s>
<s> sheets will NOT support transformation of web pages on the basis of semantic content.  </s>
<s> They only support transformation on structure.  </s>
<s> Web pages organized according to semantic aspects is a better design for blind users.  </s>
<s> In order to evaluate this, it is important to understand the difference between organization according to visual impact and organization according to semantic aspects.  </s>
<s> (Also, remember that in general once information is translated into HTML, the semantic relationships are lost to most software reading the HTML as explained by Tim Berners-Lee).  </s>
<s> Just to be clear ... your note mentioned a generic user .  </s>
<s> What was talked about is that there would be NO generic user.  </s>
<s> Each web page is specialized in content, format, language, etc to each individual user.  </s>
<s> Scott  </s>
<s> aloha, scott!  </s>
<s> again, i must apologize for not having checked out your demo pages, due to an utter lack of opportunity... please rest assured that it is at the very top of my list of things to do online!  </s>
<s> my point is simply this: if you provide structure, into which personalized content is dropped -- either via a template driven database-based program such as ColdFusion or via XML in combination with RDF -- there is no quote tailorization for the blind unquote necessary -- merely tailorization for the individual (who in this case, just happens to be blind)... there is an old saying that a blind man's poison is another man's food -- a saw which, having had a wealth of experience working with individuals with widely varying visual acuity -- i would amend to one blind person's panacea is another's poison... tailor content for individuals, and let them take it from there, but do not tailor the presentation of that content solely on the basis of their perceived disability... i, having been fully sighted for my first twenty years, process information in a vastly different manner than someone who has never had any usable vision... my inability to read braille due to neuropathy in my fingertips, also has had a profound effect on how i process information... so, although i operate in a non-visual modality, my experience of that modality is vastly different from jason white's or dave poehlman's or janina sajka's, to name but 3 blind users who immediately spring to mind... i want information tailored to my tastes as an individual, not to as a member of an amorphous (and, potentially apocryphal) class of users... gregory.  </s>
<s> Hi, Gregory The impression I'm getting is that an issue that seems to be bothering you is the labeling.  </s>
<s> Different people have different views.  </s>
<s> For example, since I use a wheelchair, I tend to look for doors with wheelchair symbols because I know they will be easier for me to use.  </s>
<s> For most people who aren't disabled, they don't need to look for the specially marked doors.  </s>
<s> Having the doors marked with wheelchair symbols seems very straight-forward.  </s>
<s> Looking at the template.  </s>
<s> Blind people have less trouble using web pages which are organized according to semantic/concept structure.  </s>
<s> (I believe this is probably true for most blind users.) Sighted people often prefer web pages which are organized to be visually interesting.  </s>
<s> Does this make sense to you?  </s>
<s> (You might want to look at my examples before  </s>
<s> answering this.) In most situations, these pages are very different.  </s>
<s> (Trying to get one page to be both usually means compromising either the visual impact or the ease of use by blind users.  </s>
<s> Guess who probably does not come out well in these compromises.) As a result, the templates used to generate the web pages need to be different.  </s>
<s> What would you call a template designed to present information organized according to semantic structure?  </s>
<s> It would not be very convenient to call it the "semantically-organized template" since most blind users would not know what that means.  </s>
<s> Scott  </s>
<s> I disagree with Scott's central premise that one and the same document can  </s>
<s> not, without an unsatisfactory compromise, be both visually appealing and structurally organised with appropriate markup.  </s>
<s> Style sheet positioning, as yet not widely implemented but for which support is now starting to become available, is designed to address this problem; and in the interim, one can of course embed proper structural markup within the table constructs that have been conventionally misused to produce formatting effects.  </s>
<s> In the latter scenario, the table can be linearized, thereby presenting the user with proper structural divisions, lists, paragraphs, headings, in-line semantics, etc. Mobile devices demand structural and semantic richness; style sheets support it, and offer the additional advantage of allowing the author greater control over presentation than is possible with HTML tables, in a specification that is expected to be uniformly implemented across user agents and operating systems.  </s>
<s> The increasing adoption of XML will only advance the trend toward separating content and structure from presentation.  </s>
<s> Taking these factors into account, Scott's proposal would be a retrograde move and I do not support it.  </s>
<s> The guidelines already provide that, where a document can not otherwise be made accessible, an alternative version may be created (checkpoint 11.4).  </s>
<s> Server-side techniques may be included under this checkpoint, but the basic position should remain unchanged: alternative versions are a last resort and an interim solution, to be avoided where possible.  </s>
<s> we will be doing personalization soon.  </s>
<s> we can include this in our requirements matrix and see how it works out.  </s>
<s> Personalization also depends on the software selected.  </s>
<s> There are some high-end packages like Vignette story server and others.  </s>
<s> by the way, need to convince marketing there are 31 million PWD who are a market force.  </s>
<s> Most marketing execs want to see numbers who buy at the site.  </s>
<s> I see personalization as a convincing way because there is no way to tell who is hiting us with screen readers.  </s>
