<s> In the DOM 2 spec [07/03/2000] under section 4.2 the MediaList interface has a method called "delete".  </s>
<s> Since delete is a keyword in C++, perhaps this method should be named "deleteMedium" instead.  </s>

<s> Hum, seems we really need to change the name of this method.  </s>
<s> It makes sense to rename append for consistency.  </s>
<s> Here is the new interface : // Introduced in DOM Level 2: interface MediaList { attribute DOMString mediaText; // raises(DOMException) on setting readonly attribute unsigned long length; DOMString item(in unsigned long index); void deleteMedium(in DOMString oldMedium) raises(DOMException); void appendMedium(in DOMString newMedium) raises(DOMException); Philippe.  </s>

<s> Unless I am much mistaken, the IDL - C++ mapping defined by the OMG deals with this by renaming the method in some systematic way, such as by adding an underscore prefix or something.  </s>
<s> So this is necessarily catastrophic, although it probably violates the principle of least surprise.  </s>
