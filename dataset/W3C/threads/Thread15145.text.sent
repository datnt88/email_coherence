Hi, I think it is important that any success criteria for language use includes a list of applicable languages. 
For example, there is a proposal not to use noun sequences. 
In french, one can reasonably say la version du loi de droits de general de gaulle (either: General de Gaulle's version of the law of rights, or the version of the law of General de Gaulle's rights). 
Similarly, it is proposed that verbs in the passive mood be avoided. 
(I.e. the last sentence would fail, twice). 
I don't know if this applies in all languages. 
If we do not think that a criterion works for a particular language, we should not say anything. 
If we think that a criterion does not work for a particular language, we should say so. 
I realise that this will leave us with a weaker list than we might have, but hopefully it will encourage people with relevant expertise to help fill the list. 
It will also hopefully mean we avoid saying things that are wrong and would cause problems.

Perhaps the advice section for 4.1 could include something to the effect that authors should follow the conventions appropriate to the natural language of the content. 
A further point: even in English, it's not always appropriate to avoid the passive. 
There are times when it isn't possible to assign grammatical agency-- especially in bureaucratic writing. 
The Section 508 standards would fail this criterion if we were to insist on it, for example. 
There are implicit cultural assumptions here, too. 
In the United States, for example, many people place high value on coming directly to "the point," both in writing and in oral communication. 
But in many countries such directness is considered rude, and in some cases it may be politically dangerous (which is why satire flourishes under repressive regimes).

| cheers | chaals | 136 SWAD-E http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe ------------ WAI | Antipolis Cedex, France I agree with Emmanuelle, Charles and John that the list of ideas I compiled does not deal enough with the diversity of "plain language." 
Maybe a better approach is to get away from specifics and instead propose a list of guiding principles. 
These might be along the lines of: * "Use a form of sentence structure that is generally considered easy to understand in a particular language." 
* "Organize content in a way that is generally considered easy to understand in a particular language and for a particular use (such as instructions or correspondence or informational materials.) * "Use a form of address that is considered easy to understand in a particular language and for a particular use, yet is also culturally appropriate." 
And so on -- the point being to get people to think about what would constitute "plain" within the linguistic and cultural constraints of their own language. 
To follow from the article Emmanuelle listed, here is an e-mail from a Japanese woman who teaches English in Japan and is interested in plain language. 
I recently asked her what would be plain Japanese: Not being an expert on the Japanse language, I don't think we have such a plain Japanese campaign as you have a PE crusade in English speaking countries. 
I admit, though, that there are books on the market on "how to write" in Japanese. 
The books are, to all intents and purposes, meant to convery the same message as PE. 
And I may say safely that partly as a result of PE or Western culture, "Plain Japanese" has been gaining ground - especially, in business writing...Say yes or no at the beginning instead of at the end. 
The Japanese language writing is structured in the order of introduction, development, turn, and conclusion. 
Which means we don't know the conclusion until we come to the end of a message vis-a-vis at the beginning in PE. 
Thus, the traditional Japanese way of writing is neither efficient nor effective for business purposes; PE is catching attention as an example. 
In my opinion the Japanese language is, as a whole, more comlex and difficult to understand than the English language. 
This may have something to do with the differences in syntax and in culture. 
We have Japanese grammar. 
But I think English grammar is more systematic. 
In English you have a subject-verb-object construction. 
We have more "freedom." 
Sometimes the subject is omitted - and is so recommended, especially, "I." And the verb comes at the end. 
Which means we know only at the end if the answer is yes or no. 
In between there are a posse of vague and ornate phrases and words. 
Impatient listeners tend to demand, "So, what's your conclusion?" 
Neither do we have a sense for "paragraphing." 
One paragraph /one sentence is the day of order. 
Or one paragraph contains lots of ideas: past, present, and future. 
And it's understood in Japanese but not in translated English. 
On the cultural front, in Japan we're given to read between the lines of the other: guts feeling (haragei or stomach reading). 
We've been taught not to say no directly. 
but indirectly. 
Instead we expect the other to read into us even if we don't explain in so many words. 
But this is changing, especially in business writing. 
Plain Japanese is gaining ground. 
It's in the diaper stage, though. 
I like Avi's suggestion that we consider offering a list of principles, on the order of those he lists. 
But the specifics are valuable, too; perhaps we can move them into something like a techniques document for writing; there might even be different "writing techniques" for different languages.

I think it is vital that success criteria are specific - otherwise they are just nice ideas. 
I think there are success criteria that we can apply so long as we recognise that they may only apply to certain languages. 
There will always be more things that we will have as nice ideas, but the goal of this group is to make a specification that can be tested, and that serves tthe needs of people with disabilities. 
That implies being as specific as possible. 
cheers Chaals SWAD-E http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe ------------ WAI http://www.w3.org/WAI W3C, 2004 Route des Lucioles, 06902 Sophia Antipolis Cedex, France But the "can be tested" and "serve the needs of people with disabilities" values can pull us in different directions, here. 
And there are different ways to be specific. 
Lisa has once again raised the idea of a weighted-factors scoring scheme, on the premise that the success levels on the various testable scales are somewhat fungible. 
For some of our sub-factors this could be true. 
Think of weighted factors as late binding to quantization for those factors which are continuous variables as measured, not intrinsically pass/fail. 
It just give us the tools to fit the rating function better to the available prognostic knowledge. 
Finely-divided pass-fail tests with boolean rollup give the guideline writer better *control* over what the author does. 
But flexible scoring which weights and accumulates the quantitative results on different axes may give the content producers using the guideline better prognostic *information* as to the usability they can expect. 
We should balance our pursuit of these two ends.
