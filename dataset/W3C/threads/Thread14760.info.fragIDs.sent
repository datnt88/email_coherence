<s> Since in WCAG 2.0 we aren't including any technology-specific  </s>

<s> as to apply across relevant technologies, what would you suggest as an  </s>
<s> appropriate checkpoint to meet the need which the above example illustrates?  </s>
<s> What is the accessibility problem, is it covered by any of our existing checkpoints, and if not, what is the general access requirement that is missing from the guidelines?  </s>
<s> Perhaps guideline 5 would be pertinent here, as its purpose is to discuss technical robustness; or maybe guideline 1?  </s>
<s> Either way, the techniques documents (especially CSS techniques) will  </s>
<s> discuss style sheets in detail.  </s>
<s> There are still issues of backward compatibility and choice of technology under guideline 5 to be worked out.  </s>
<s> The most important point is to identify, at a fundamental level, what  </s>
<s> the requirement is, independently of specific technologies, and to make sure it is specified appropriately in the guidelines.  </s>
<s> Jason,  </s>
<s> There are too many people who think they can use images to stylize text and just use ALT text to make it accessible.  </s>
<s> This is a big problem for low  </s>
<s> vision users: 1.  </s>
<s> Most popular browsers do not support the rendering of ALT text for area elements.  </s>
<s> I just reviewed a web site that the developers thought was accessible (passed some level of WCAG) and I told them it was not functaionally accessible because they used AREA elements to define links and they are not rendered by Opera 6.0, IE 6.0 or Netscape 6.2 when images are configured to be turned off.  </s>
<s> 2. Control over the styling of ALT text is limited in many browsers.  </s>
<s> For example IE does not provide much control over styling, so the text is often very small when compared to other text in a high contrast rendering.  </s>
<s> Users cannot make it bigger, even when adding user style sheets.  </s>
<s> 3. I also think that using images to stylize text promotes a graphical view of the web.  </s>
<s> People can think "I can use images all I want and be accessible by putting in ALT text".  </s>
<s> I think this should not be considered good practice for accessible designs.  </s>
<s> So I think a more general checkpoint would be to not use images to stylize text.  </s>
<s> This provides an accessible design oriented requirement, rather than the current repair oriented requirement of providing text equivalents for non-text content.  </s>
<s> Jon  </s>
<s> So fundamentally one could say it is a matter of using the most semantically rich and flexible technology available, all other considerations (i.e., user agent support) being equal.  </s>
<s> Specifically this would mean: Prefer style sheets to presentational markup Prefer text to images of text.  </s>
<s> Prefer vector graphics to raster-based images (again for reasons of scalability) Prefer formats that encode structure to those which do not.  </s>
<s> Allow the final presentation to be generated at that point in the delivery path at which software exists that can best satisfy the user's needs.  </s>
<s> Specifically this means in some cases that the presentational form can best be generated on the author's server, by a proxy, or by the user agent and that as content negotiation technologies improve the choice between these options will become more automated.  </s>
<s> Of course the countervailing consideration is, inevitably, user agent support, which will change in the course of time.  </s>
<s> Thus we can't freeze any particular "user agent baseline" into our guidelines, as it will soon be out of date, and in any event, developers shouldn't be penalized for using a newer, less supported but superior (from an accessibility point of view) technology by not being able to claim any level of conformance to accessibility guidelines.  </s>
<s> Cynthia's proposed solution might be of help here.  </s>
<s> Modifying it slightly, this proposal would be approximately as follows: 1.  </s>
<s> The content developer should define (or adopt from us) a user agent support baseline, e.g., HTML 4.01 + CSS level 1, with allowance for known implementation issues - or whatever it may be.  </s>
<s> This baseline should be documented by the developer and referred to from the conformance claim (especially a metadata conformance claim).  </s>
<s> 2. We would provide suggested baselines determined by whatever evidence we can gather regarding assistive technology support, and publish them periodically.  </s>
<s> 3. In the techniques documents we would have a consistent labeling scheme indicating, for each technique, the earliest version of the relevant technology in which the necessary features are available, with some comment as to known implementation status and any issues that developers should consider.  </s>
<s> Developers could then choose techniques according to whatever user agent baseline has been set.  </s>
<s> 4. Ideally, there should be tools for managing this process - that is, filtering techniques by technology version and/or implementation status. 5. The implementation status categories might be roughly as follows: a. not known to be implemented b. implemented, but not supported by assistive technologies and/or user agents typically used by people with disabilities c. Implemented by some user agents and, where applicable, assistive technologies, but not yet widely available.  </s>
<s> Internationalization/localization category: a.  </s>
<s> Not yet internationalized/localized b. Internationalized/localized by user agents c. Internationalized/localized by user agents, including some user agents/assistive technologies significant to people with disabilities.  </s>
<s> d. Internationalized/localized to a significant extent, and widely supported by implementations.  </s>
<s> Perhaps this is somewhat too complex and could be simplified a little - maybe a scale from 1-10 with points added or subtracted based on various factors (degree of user agent/assistive technology support, whether known implementation problems/incompatibilities exist, whether internationalized/localized versions are available), with fuller details included for those who want them.  </s>
<s> they are just thoughts that might be useful in the resolution of the relevant issues.  </s>
<s> Jason, I think you are on to something important here.  </s>
<s> I like the way you captured the underlying "best practices" content principles, and the acknolwedgement that user agent implementations can be at odds with "best practices".  </s>
<s> Both of these are important considerations.  </s>

<s> With regards to this:  </s>
<s> I recall this being a discussion a few months back, and as I see it, it falls under the checkpoint 3.1: When an appropriate markup language exists, use markup rather than images to convey information.  </s>
<s> As far as I am concerned, the issues you raised are user agent problems, not content problems, and perhaps you should take it up with the UAAG Working Group.  </s>
<s> No "appropriate markup language" currently exists that properly imitates what images of text can illustrate.  </s>
<s> So including a checkpoint to "not use images to stylize text" is essentially taking the onus off user agents to deal with the problems you have identified.  </s>
<s> I do agree however, that they are issues very real to people with vision impairments.  </s>
