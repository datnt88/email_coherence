I'm somewhat new to the world of downloading fonts. 
Does anyone know where I can find a free version of Helvetica Condensed? 
So far the only place I've found it online is on fonts.com for $22.00. 
Seems kinda steep for a font I thought was pretty common. 
Thanks, Shannon 
Seems kinds steep for something that took some poor font designer months of his life to design and make, so you'll just steal it from somewhere, eh? Hang your head in shame, and go fork out the $22.00.

Look Bill, and the rest of you, What is with you people? 
The rudest bunch of jerks I've met in a while. 
I asked a simple question. 
I'm not trying to rip anyone off, I'm just making sure I'm not blowing my cash on something that, as far as I know, could have been readily available. 
Obviously I was wrong, all you had to say was, "No Shannon, this is not something that is free, you will need to pay for it." 
You people need to calm down and retract your claws.
