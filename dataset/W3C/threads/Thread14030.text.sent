I agree with the sentiments that Chris has expressed. 
Research findings should be able to indicate what types of cognitive limitations exist, the kinds of communication strategies which have proved most effective in minimising their impact, etc. 
At this stage we do not appear to have broad agreement even in connection with such basic points. 
The most basic need is for graphics to be deliberately included on web sites to aid understanding of the text. 
We have gone off on a tangent as to whether or how to replace text with all graphics, but the most basic need is for the graphics to be there, whether they replace all text, or just clarify the main ideas. 
The next question would be, which solutions are best applicable universally, across the web as a whole, and ought therefore to be included in the guidelines. 
We already have one such proposal, namely the priority 1 checkpoint which demands that language be kept as clear and straightforward as possible, This is a very subjective checkpoint. 
Of the many web sites that have been shown as examples of those complying with priority one and two, few had language was far from "clear and straightforward" through the eyes of someone with a moderate or significant cognitive disability. 
and a priority 3 suggestion that graphical supplements are a suitable aid to comprehension where applicable and appropriate. 
This needs to be much stronger to be of any help to cognitively disabled folks. 
The graphics MUST BE THERE. 
In order for some users to access the content of the web, the graphics must be turned off. 
In order for other users to access the content of the web, the text must be turned on. 
If the text is turned off, and there is non content, then the web shouldn't be given a "compliance" rating at any priority level. 
At present, a web site that contains nothing but text, can get a compliance rating. 
This shouldn't be. 
A web site without graphics locks out too many disabled users. 
Over the weekend, I spent some time on the web gathering sources to use in homeschooling an 8 yr old. 
One of the sites that shows promise is www.seaworld.com 
This site contains a significant number of images of sea life, as well as details on each animal. 
Unfortunately, the site was set up to put all the images in one place, and all the descriptions in another. 
The descriptions are all-text without a picture of the animal being described even tho the site does contain a picture of the animal that belongs on the description page. 
For reasons I cannot fathom, those who create web sites are not following the most basic of structures used in children's books and picture books &amp; magazines for older folks, putting the graphics on the page with (or facing) the text it applies to. 
For those who want research, let Jonathan's folks access the www.seaworld.com 
site and let Jonathan report back on the experience. 
This will help us understand what is needed, in addition to just adding graphics, to make a site accessible for Jonathan's cognitively disabled folks.

Enabling Support Foundation You might take a look at http://www.ipl.org/ for kid appropriate content. 
A number of other resources are listed on our Resources web page under Digital Media / Text (excuse the term) at http://www.cast.org/resources.html. 
Many of the resources include books with images. 
We have also created a very basic introduction to the use of images, alt tags and descriptions at http://www.cast.org/strategies/image_barrier.html. 
Chuck this site evidently has links to many sites that are useful for those learning to read. 
However and this is the crux of why I am saying that research is not helpful, difficult a position as that is to maintain, it is not directly accessible to the intended end user but to their carers. 
There are a huge number of sites like this available every major charity concerned with LD has one at least. 
WAI needs to produce a page or more that is directly accessible to a different group than the one it currently helps. 
Otherwise why should anyone else?

Chuck, I checked this out yesterday, and my conclusion is that it approaches the problem "bassackward". 
Your directions assume that graphics are being included and say how to do it so it doesn't impose barriers to those who cannot see the graphics, but it doesn't do much to encourage the use of images, doesn't mention the need to correlate illustrations to the content of the text, and doesn't mention how to set up graphics so they appear small on the page but can be clicked on to see the full size picture. 
Nowhere is there mention that as surely as there are folks who cannot use graphics as presented, there are also folks who cannot use text when presented without graphics. 
There are no guidelines on choosing appropriate picture and/or icons, only guidelines on what you have to do if you insist on including the dern things!

Enabling Support Foundation Anne, Thank you for the feedback on the image activity. 
It serves as an initial introduction for teachers to a few of the basic principles pertaining to alt text, d tags, and selection of images. 
You are right. 
It is far from complete and you will find that same is true of the auditory activity page. 
Some of your recommendations are subjective opinions on how to present images or graphics that may require some discussion. 
We have been experimenting with the use of full images, iconic representations of images that may be clicked to provide the full image in a second window, single column text with images along side but not intruding into the text area, etc. 
We are discovering, as you might expect, that the best choice depends on purpose and individual preferences. 
We'll keep at it. 
Chuck In this area, I am learning, not learned. 
I'm open to discussion. 
We have been experimenting with I'm curious about your clicking to provide the full image in a second window. 
Why do you choose to put it in another window? 
Is there an advantage to the visual user? 
The software I use for web authoring does not provide the option to open another window, but I can link an image to a full-sized version and the user hits the back key to return to the original page. 
We are discovering, as Both purpose and individual preferences will always be factors. 
If the audience is known, individual preferences may be known. 
With the wide audience of the web it may be only possible to guess at individual preferences, and the result of missing some will cost audience. 
Purpose should be an important, if not the most important, consideration. 
If the purpose of a site is to teach or inform, and individual preferences aren't met satisfactorily, the audience will decline, and so will the "effectiveness" of the site. 
My efforts at finding suitable sites and e-text for a third grader were more fruitful yesterday than in the past. 
I have enough e-text or online reading selections to "last the year", but not enough to be able to sift through for quality without running out of "stuff". 
Sites with activities are available suitably labeled for approximate grade/age use. 
A big hurdle is that a lot of sites list "classics", "award winners" and other lists of books that contain only book title and author, no guess at an age or grade level preference, or even the subject. 
It'll be pretty dreary if I have to go to a library and examine every one of those books (couple hundred) to find the ones that are useful, then have Taylor look at each of the useful ones and find the ones with interesting subject matter. 
Many sites boast lists of books, but the "classics" are always the same, title and author only. 
Does CAST have, or have access to a narrative to the classic and award winning children's books that would include reading/interest levels and a hint at the subject? 
If so, you may want to include it in your teacher resources (and send me a copy or give me the URL please!).

Enabling Support Foundation We are not sure yet. 
It can be problematic to leave large spaces open for the full size image. 
Might as well put the image there. 
If using a thumbnail, growing the image to full size require reformating the content around the image which then causes orientation problems for kids. 
Where am I, were was I, what's next? 
When opening in a second window, we find that it is best to open the image to the same screen location but I want to stress that we have not decided that this is a desirable approach. 
Anne also asked: I don't have such a list but will check around to see of others might. 
I am not surprised to hear how difficult it has been to find high quality content for your purposes. 
We have been working with schools in New Hampshire, Maine, Massachusetts and Texas on this problem for a couple of years and many have resorted to scanning books and putting them into supported reading engines. 
I just finished preparing and submitting a proposal to create a digital resource library for kids with special needs with the hope that we can begin to share some of this work rather than have it duplicated over and over again. 
The Texas Book Exchange has been doing this for college and university textbooks with permission from the publishers. 
We plan to do this in a completely legal manner requiring validation of need.

Enabling Support Foundation the What I have done when I've made such pages was to put two versions of the image on the web: the full sized one that comes up on the click, and the smaller (resampled to 25% or so version) which is on the page itself. 
The pages load fast with the small pictures, and the full sized pictures are there as needed. 
The full sized pictures generally fill the whole screen, which means the original page isn't visible. 
Is that what causes orientation problems for some kids? 
Or are you trying to get the whole page to work with the enlarged picture? 
We have been working with schools in New Hampshire, Maine, Unless excellent equipment is available, it's a tedious and thankless job to scan in text and correct it, and doing enough to keep up with the needs of a learning youngster. 
I remember before scanners, trying to key in text to provide resources to special students. 
But, it's somewhat like feeding a stray cat, the more you do the more you have to do. 
The digital resource library sounds excellent! 
Especially if there is a way to provide the resources to those who aren't validated with a disabling need (just an educational need) whether by payments or whatever. 
The need is apparent, and it isn't a special ed need, but an educational need. 
Anne Anne L. Pemberton apembert@crosslink.net 
Enabling Support Foundation image Could you please send me information as to how you were doing this? 
There is a zoom approach and an eyeglass approach, niether of which demand that the surrounding material are changed. 
This seems to me a very useful approach, though I disagree about the need for reformatting.bb 
I accept that this may not currently be possible with HTML.
