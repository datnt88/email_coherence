Hi folks, as I have learned some more about Xforms I have updated the EARL evaluation tools at http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/200305/axforms - including some rudimentary documentation. 
I have a further update on my laptop which I will put in place before Monday (I'm currently only connected through a public terminal, while travelling). 
Unfortunately I have not yet had time to finish the update and testing of using earl.w3.org to accept EARL written according to the latest working draft - http://www.w3.org/TR/EARL10 - but with luck that will happen Monday too... cheers chaals Post: 21 Mitchell street, FOOTSCRAY Vic 3011, Australia or W3C, 2004 Route des Lucioles, 06902 Sophia Antipolis Cedex, France 
Thanks Bjoern for alerting me to this. 
The real one is 
somewhat updated documentation, and a form that lets you create a new set of test cases. 
Coming soon - add/remove test cases to an existing set (for example a few atomic things instead of a single WCAG checkpoint, or build a user agent test suite tool...) cheers Chaals

True. 
I don't know why that is. 
I redid the packaging and put clean versions (I hope) up there. 
Pity Safari doesn't handle Xforms. 
Thanks for the (continuous) feedback Chaals 
delivered as text/xml but it really is a gzipped tar archive.
