<s> Hi folks, as I have learned some more about Xforms I have updated the EARL evaluation tools at http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/200305/axforms - including some rudimentary documentation.  </s>
<s> I have a further update on my laptop which I will put in place before Monday (I'm currently only connected through a public terminal, while travelling).  </s>
<s> Unfortunately I have not yet had time to finish the update and testing of using earl.w3.org to accept EARL written according to the latest working draft - http://www.w3.org/TR/EARL10 - but with luck that will happen Monday too... cheers chaals Post: 21 Mitchell street, FOOTSCRAY Vic 3011, Australia or W3C, 2004 Route des Lucioles, 06902 Sophia Antipolis Cedex, France  </s>
<s> Thanks Bjoern for alerting me to this.  </s>
<s> The real one is  </s>
<s> somewhat updated documentation, and a form that lets you create a new set of test cases.  </s>
<s> Coming soon - add/remove test cases to an existing set (for example a few atomic things instead of a single WCAG checkpoint, or build a user agent test suite tool...) cheers Chaals  </s>

<s> True.  </s>
<s> I don't know why that is.  </s>
<s> I redid the packaging and put clean versions (I hope) up there.  </s>
<s> Pity Safari doesn't handle Xforms.  </s>
<s> Thanks for the (continuous) feedback Chaals  </s>
