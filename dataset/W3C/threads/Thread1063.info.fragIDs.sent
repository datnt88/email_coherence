I have a popup screen that reads as follows: Line one states HTML Tidy for Windows vers 1st August 2002; built on Aug 8 2002, at 15:41:13 Line two states Parsing Console input stdin flashing cursor Since this my first experience with Tidy, where do I go from here? 
Thanks for your time,

Tidy is waiting for your HTML to come in, so it can parse it. 
From an earlier mail to this list by Dave Raggett: "Tidy is fundamentally a tool that reads in HTML cleans it up and writes it out again. 
It was developed as a program you run from the console prompt, but there are GUI encapsulations available, e.g. HTML-Kit, which you might prefer. 
If you are using Windows, the first step is to unzip the zip file and place the tidy.exe 
file in a folder somewhere on your executables path. 
You may also want to set up a config file to save having to type lots of options each time you run Tidy. 
From the console prompt you can run Tidy like this: C tidy -m mywebpage.html 
In this case, the -m option requests Tidy to write the tidied file back to the same filename as it read from (mywebpage.html). 
Tidy will give you a breakdown of the problems it found and the version of HTML the file appears to be using."

If you're not comfortable with the DOS command line, you should try one of the GUI versions: One of these days, I'm going to write an HOWTO on using Tidy under Windows for people who come to Tidy without DOS knowledge. 
Or is there such a document available?

With the addition of Mac and Linux GUI links, I think you just did! 
I updated the FAQ with your (slightly altered) message. 
I should do this more often... take it easy, Charlie
