<s> I have a popup screen that reads as follows: Line one states HTML Tidy for Windows vers 1st August 2002; built on Aug 8 2002, at 15:41:13 Line two states Parsing Console input stdin flashing cursor Since this my first experience with Tidy, where do I go from here?  </s>

<s> Tidy is waiting for your HTML to come in, so it can parse it.  </s>
<s> From an earlier mail to this list by Dave Raggett: "Tidy is fundamentally a tool that reads in HTML cleans it up and writes it out again.  </s>
<s> It was developed as a program you run from the console prompt, but there are GUI encapsulations available, e.g. HTML-Kit, which you might prefer.  </s>
<s> If you are using Windows, the first step is to unzip the zip file and place the tidy.exe  </s>
<s> file in a folder somewhere on your executables path.  </s>
<s> You may also want to set up a config file to save having to type lots of options each time you run Tidy.  </s>
<s> From the console prompt you can run Tidy like this: C tidy -m mywebpage.html  </s>
<s> In this case, the -m option requests Tidy to write the tidied file back to the same filename as it read from (mywebpage.html).  </s>
<s> Tidy will give you a breakdown of the problems it found and the version of HTML the file appears to be using."  </s>
<s> See also http://tidy.sourceforge.net/docs/Overview.html  </s>
<s> If you're not comfortable with the DOS command line, you should try one of the GUI versions: One of these days, I'm going to write an HOWTO on using Tidy under Windows for people who come to Tidy without DOS knowledge.  </s>
<s> Or is there such a document available?  </s>

<s> With the addition of Mac and Linux GUI links, I think you just did!  </s>
<s> I updated the FAQ with your (slightly altered) message.  </s>
<s> I should do this more often... take it easy, Charlie  </s>
