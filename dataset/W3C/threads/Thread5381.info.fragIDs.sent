<s> Your question is (if I understand it correctly): two kinds of contraints exist for an agent to discover and execute automatically a WS: (1) constraints for profile/function/process; (2) constraints for communication/access to the WS. Which constraints should be checked first?  </s>
<s> You prefer the latter.  </s>
<s> My comments: 1. hard to say which should be first or combined to use, depending on quality and speed of filtering, but I tend to prefer the sequnece of (1) then (2), because (1) is business requirements and search engines are more likely to be available and mature on market and (2) is more technical and type validation/matching is often hard and time-consuming.  </s>
<s> 2. it is important to know that your agent must have a strong capability to adjust itself to communicate with those found WSs. Let's assume your agent be a WS trying to discover and access to BookAirlineTicket, though any ways (UDDI or search engine) your WS has found two WSs: WS1: op1(inXSD1, outXSD1), in its WSDL one operations op1 is defined by two message types inXSD1 and outXSD1; WS2: op2(inXSD2, outXSD2).  </s>
<s> Your WS in WSDL must define two operations op1(outXSD1, inXSD1) and op2(outXSD2, inXSD2) to access to WS1 and WS2, or your WS must have such an ability to flexibily transform op(inXSD, outXSD) into op1(outXSD1, inXSD1) to access to WS1 and op2(outXSD2, inXSD2) to access to WS2.  </s>
<s> If many WSs have been found, the latter would be more useful.  </s>

<s> Having thought about this for some time already, I was wondering if there is any work in the SWS spec targetted towards sharing/re-using/extending existing service interfaces?  </s>
<s> For example, building infrastructure into development tools for discovering service interfaces (maybe from a purpose built registry or from existing services) at design-time would be very helpful in re-using/extending existing interfaces and thus reducing the amount of dynamic semantic discovery needed across similar services.  </s>
<s> This may be applied best inside a company and even extended to include discovery of common object design for OO programming across different groups/departments within one business.  </s>
