I am ashamed and embarrassed that during the AU conference call I championed the position that we should restrict our efforts to the product of authoring tools without addressing forcefully the accessibility of the tools themselves. 
This is exactly the position of "expedience" that we rightly deplore, e.g. PDF is so much more convenient than HTML conversion, etc. 
Despite a recent posting by Chuck Opperman: "I agree that it should be dropped. 
There are plenty of excellent references on producing accessible applications. 
Sun, IBM, Trace and Microsoft all have guidelines for Universal Design and software applications." it is incumbent on us to assure that any software that we play *any* part in promulgating attend carefully to matters of accessibility; this includes all our own internal tools or even the "Word macros" that constitute authoring tools - because the next person who must use these tools for maintenance will hopefully need to use access tools with said software. 
Bottom line: this old geezer feels that Section 4 of our document is central and vital to our output and that this is a line-in-the-sand, do-or-die, deal-breaker, and all those other cliches and again I apologize for forgetting why we're here. 
Love. 
ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE I don't see the need for more discussion, this is simple: Guideline x.x.x: Ensure that the authoring tool user interface is completely accessible to users with disabilities. 
Refer to the appropriate design guidelines for the particular platform that the authoring tool will be used on. 
For example, if the authoring tool will be used on the Microsoft Windows operating system, ensure that the "Windows Guidelines for Accessible Software Design" are met.

ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE I'm with Chuck on this one. 
The fact that tools themselves must be accessible is an assumption of WAI (Or it ought to be if it isn't) but the scope of the AU guidelines is what tools need to do to ensure that the materials they produce are accessible - the specifics of accessible UI design are outside this scope, and should be properly dealt with in other areas. 
However I agree that we could valuably insert a statement making this explicit - more in the introduction/about this document, like the statement about scope which has been discussed recently in the PAGL group.
