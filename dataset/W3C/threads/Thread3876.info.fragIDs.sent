<s> Hi, [I didn't realise that the email address for XSLT 2.0 comments had changed as well...] This is a follow-on from my last message about indeterminate comparisons between durations and date/times in the F&amp;O WD and sorting.  </s>

<s> The first sort key of A is compared with the first sort key of B, according to the rules of the first sort key definition.  </s>
<s> If, under these rules, A is less than B, then A will precede B in the sorted sequence, unless the order attribute of this sort key definition specifies descending, in which case B will precede A in the sorted sequence.  </s>
<s> If, however, the relevant sort keys compare equal, then the second sort key of A is compared with the second sort key of B, according to the rules of the second sort key definition.  </s>
<s> This continues until two sort keys are found that compare unequal.  </s>
<s> If all the sort keys compare equal, then A will precede B in the sorted sequence if A preceded B in the initial sequence, and vice versa.  </s>
<s> In general, comparison of two values is performed according to the rules of the XPath lt operator.  </s>
<s> However, special rules apply to certain data types, as described below.  </s>
<s> [ERR069] It is a dynamic error if, for any sort key definition, the set of sort keys evaluated for all the items in the initial sequence, after any type conversion requested, contains a pair of values for which the result of the XPath lt operator is an error or an empty sequence.  </s>
<s> The processor must either signal the error, or must recover by assigning an arbitrary ordering to any such pair of values.  </s>
<s> Given that indeterminate comparisons were allowed, I think that it would be much more helpful if the comparisons between pairs of values were described in terms of only lt rather than lt and eq.  </s>

<s> For partially ordered data types, this will create an intuitive ordering, and not require an error to be raised.  </s>
<s> For example, with the source: it would be possible to sort them with: in order to get: without getting an error of any kind.  </s>

<s> Jeni: We are trying to get away from indeterminate comparisons.  </s>
<s> Our attempt is to deprecate 'duration' and have users use two totally ordered subtypes of duration called 'yearMonthDuration'  </s>
<s> and 'dayTimeDuration'.  </s>
<s> For the date/time types we say that for purposes of comparison and arithmetic all date/time values have an implementation specific timezone This makes them totally ordered.  </s>
<s> Take a look at the latest Functions and Operators document: This does not contain the changes for the date/time datatypes mentioned above.  </s>
<s> These will appear in the next version.  </s>

<s> Ashok,  </s>
<s> Yes, I understand that and I've read that part of the F&amp;O WD.  </s>
<s> I think that decision is completely wrong-headed -- absolutely horrendous, actually -- which is why I'm commenting on it.  </s>
<s> I thought that was the point of making working drafts public and inviting people to review them.  </s>
<s> I don't think that it's XQuery/XPath's job to dictate what data types people use in their schemas, and I think that attempts to do so are likely end in failure and frustration, mostly for those people who are unfortunate enough to have to work with it.  </s>
<s> I think more effort should be made thinking about what people *do* want to do or *might* want to do, and less trying to dictate what they *should* want to do.  </s>
<s> Cheers, Jeni Jeni Tennison  </s>
<s> Echoing Ashok's response, the current situation is that the "lt" operator, if it is defined at all for a given data type, always returns a determinate boolean answer.  </s>
<s> Defining sorting in terms of "lt" and "eq" therefore works.  </s>
<s> I agree that if we allowed an indeterminate result of "lt" we could treat it for sorting purposes as if the items were equal.  </s>
<s> Currently, the value of P29D lt P1M is not indeterminate, it is an error.  </s>
<s> I expect that in a future draft we may list the data types that can be used in xsl:sort.  </s>
<s> These are likely to include dayTimeDuration and yearMonthDuration but not xsd:duration.  </s>
