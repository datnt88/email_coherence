<s> With the author's permission, I'm passing along some feedback that I received this afternoon regarding the ideas compilation for checkpoint 4.1.  </s>
<s> Someone on your list sent this along to me.  </s>
<s> Since a lot of this material relates to clarity,I want to urge you to u USE ACTIVE VERBS as much as possible throughout.  </s>
<s> Passive verbs are a major source of confusion in writing.  </s>
<s> You shuld start each item with a strong action verb.  </s>
<s> For example: Instead of *content under site control is written as clearly and simply as the author feels [appropriate / possible] for the purpose of the content.  </s>
<s> write write content under site control as clearly and simply as possible (all the rest about the author is excess - "as possible" covers it) and instead of * summaries and/or simpler forms are provided for key pages or sections of the site.  </s>
<s> write provide summaries or simpler form for key pages or sections of the site (don't use slashes, they are often confusing).  </s>
<s> You do have some statements written this way, as in * Break up long sentences into shorter ones.  </s>
<s> [1] * Provide accurate unique page titles.  </s>
<s> Hi all The form actually depends on where they are located in the checkpoint.  </s>
<s> Checkpoints and advice are currently all active action verbs.  </s>
<s> But success criteria are statements of fact - so can't be active action verbs.  </s>
<s> Currently most of these items are in the advisory section so active action verbs would be the correct form.  </s>
<s> If any of them move to success criteria - they would have to change their form.  </s>
<s> For now - we can put them all in active form if that is preferred.  </s>
<s> But we will have to revisit for those that move to success criteria.  </s>
