It occurred to me when looking at the MKCOL entity request body that what we really need is a way of batching up a bunch of methods and getting a multistatus and multi-mime part response. 
The MKCOL is just a special case of wanting to do a bunch of commands in a single round trip, perhaps as an atomic operation. 
I suggest we add a BATCH command to HTTP/WebDAV that has an entity request body consisting of an XML document where each element is a WebDAV method, its attributes are the method headers, and its content is the entity request body if any. 
The mutlistatus response could be extended to include and entity request body element for each returned status if any. 
This would be generally useful, would reduce communication round trips, and would eliminated the need to specify anything special for MKCOL (which hasn't been specified yet). 
It would also provide a simple transaction mechanism if the BATCH method was atomic. 
Vendors could advertise canned BATCH commands that provide higher-level functions in much the same way we are experimenting with user-defined property sets. 
Any thoughts? 
I believe this won't buy you anything over HTTP/1.1 connection pipelining. 
You'll still transfer just as much information, and you'll still use a single TCP connection. 
About the only thing that this could do would provide for the potential for atomicity. 
IMO, that isn't enough of a win to compare to this additional complexity.

At various times, I've heard the reason given for having an additional header or an additional method that just does the work of a couple of simpler methods as "it avoids a round trip to the server, and my users care deeply about avoiding round trips". 
If I can just invoke "HTTP-1.1 pipelining", and make those suggestions go away, then I'm happy. 
If it doesn't make the suggestions go away, but the BATCH method does, then I'm in favor of BATCH.
