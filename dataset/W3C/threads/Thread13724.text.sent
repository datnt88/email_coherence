Does the description make sense? 
This should resolve open issue #26: Cheers, Chris Not completely. 
This assumes that you have access to the processing, and that it does indeed use this system. 
but it is possible to use arbitrary code, for example to convert the coordinates on a map into latitude/longitude pairs. 
I suspect this is more like what happens for mapping sites, which are one of the legitimate uses for server-side maps that I can see (i.e. it is rather difficult to convert them to client side maps). 
In general, for applications where there is a dynamic interpretation you might not be able to do a straightforward conversion and may need to rethink the process. 
In fact I also think that this conversion technique is a WCAG technique really (which is just to say that it is more broadly useful than just ER tools).

This should resolve open issue #26: Cheers, Chris Location: I-cubed, 110 Victoria Street, Carlton VIC 3053, Australia (or W3C INRIA, Route des Lucioles, BP 93, 06902 Sophia Antipolis Cedex, France) I wonder if it's possible to convert Point objects as well? 
I don't know how they function, but assume they define a pixel at a certain location. 
We could define a rectangle for the same location - e.g., 10,10,10,10 should define a 1-pixel rectangle at pixel 10,10. 
That way we can make sure to copy all active areas over. 
This could bloat a client-side image map if they were used a lot, but should work.

This should resolve open issue #26: Cheers, Chris The difficulty here is getting decent text alternatives for each point. 
I think that at some point there is value in looking at a different kind of user interface for example selecting a coordinate from a form is a simple conversion... Charles I wonder if it's possible to convert Point objects as well?

Empty rectangles (e.g. 10,10,10,10) did not seem to work. 
So it is possible to convert the server-side image map 'point' over to a client-side 'rect'. 
I've updated the file that describes the conversion process to include this new information. 
Chris how copy were As Chaalz noted, this only solves the problem if someone is using those specific types of image map software and if the file is available to the repair tool. 
In a number of other cases this will not be true and thus this is only a partial solution. 
However, it's a somewhat workable incomplete solution. 
Only problem is there's no ALT text in your example! 
How would you generate this from a server-side map? 
I assume A-Prompt will request the information from the user?

"live" areas and hence of alt texts for them is of course in general meaningless for a serverside map] This could use a technique I am proposing to deal with TITLE and ALT attributes (possibly also more obscure things such as LONGDESC). 
The repair software will keep a lookup table of URL - title (easy) and URL - alt (more problematic). 
When it encounters a missing alt or title, it will first look them up, and enter them in the page if found. 
The interesting part of this is how to populate the database. 
In the case of TITLE there's often an easy way: for every link to an HTML document, use the TITLE of the target. 
For ALT, and for TITLE in the case of non-textual documents, it will make *provisional* entries in the database whenever it encounters any link having credible values for the attribute, and will use these thereafter in the absence of anything better. 
Going back to the specific case of an imagemap, wherever it links to an HTML document, the TITLE of the target could be suggested also as an ALT value. 
I will implement at least this TITLE repair in the Site Valet in the not too distant future. 
But it's also part of an altogether more exciting proposal, about which I will try and get around to posting in due course. 
(I hope the above makes sense, but it is Saturday night as I write). 
Nick Kew Very interesting approach, Nick! 
I like it.

Kynn, Yes, the conversion algorithm I described is only a partial solution. 
Server-side processing of image maps may be quite different from the processing of client-side image maps and a 'map' file may not be used at all. 
Yup, the server-side 'map' file has no ALT text so you must get it from the user. 
With A-Prompt we do ask the user for ALT text after doing the conversion to a client side map.
