<s> Ian, As promised, here are my comments on the current (25th December) WD of Web Forms 2.0.  </s>
<s> I'm not an expert in all the technologies that this specification touches, by any means, so this should not be considered a comprehensive review.  </s>
<s> As a result, most of my comments are from the perspective of a page author, rather than a UA implementer.  </s>
<s> I think most of it is pretty sensible: I'm mainly interested in clarifying some of the expectations and edge cases.  </s>
<s> I've split these comments into two sections: substantive and editorial.  </s>
<s> Lines beginning with '#' either refer to sections taken from the document, direct quotes, or (un-named) parts of a section.  </s>
<s> I hope it will be clear from context what the intended meaning is.  </s>
<s> Regards, Malcolm  </s>
<s> # Abstract # 1. Introduction # 1.1.  </s>
<s> Relationship to HTML After reading the complete document, it's fairly clear to me that you  </s>
<s> intend this document to apply equally to HTML and XHTML user agents.  </s>
<s> Unfortunately, I was initially unsure whether this was the case, even after reading the abstract, the introduction, and the 'Relationship to HTML' section.  </s>
<s> The title of the document begins 'Proposed XHTML Module:' and section 1.1 begins 'This specification is an extension to [XHTML1].', which clearly would not be expected to apply to an HTML UA.  </s>
<s> I think these two areas are the root of my confusion, although it does not help that the abstract does not mention HTML4 until the last sentence, and then only in a fairly complex fashion.  </s>
<s> It might be a good idea to rephrase the abstract along the lines of:  </s>
<s> "This specification defines Web Forms 2.0, an extension to the forms features found in HTML 4.01's forms chapter.  </s>
<s> Web Forms 2.0 applies to both HTML and XHTML user agents, and provides new strongly-typed input fields, new attributes for defining constraints, a repeating model for declarative repeating of form sections, new DOM interfaces, new DOM events for validation and dependency tracking, and XML submission and initialization of forms.  </s>
<s> This specification also standardises and codifies existing practice in areas that have not been previously documented.  </s>
<s> HTML4, XHTML1.1 and the DOM are thus extended in a manner which has a clear migration path from existing HTML forms, leveraging the knowledge authors have built up with their experience with HTML so far."  </s>
<s> I would then add, as the first 'requirements' bullet point in the Introduction, "Applicable to both HTML and XHTML User Agents", and  </s>
<s> change section 1.1 so that it more clearly states that the specification extends both HTML 4.01 and XHTML 1.1, for HTML and XHTML UAs respectively.  </s>
<s> This may seem like a minor issue to belabour, but it took some time for  </s>
<s> me to fully understand the scope of the specification, and it is a fairly crucial point.  </s>
<s> # 2. Extensions to form control elements You mention that empty form elements can now be contained within the head element of XHTML (and presumably, HTML?) documents, though you do not later describe the modified content model for head .  </s>
<s> Are you aware of any benefit in pre-declaring the form element in this fashion?  </s>
<s> It seems like it would add quite a bit of complexity (I'm thinking particularly of Mozilla's quirks-mode form handling, here).  </s>
<s> You also mention nested forms a few times, but you don't describe what the expected behaviour (or indeed, the point!) of a nested form would be.  </s>
<s> Are you anticipating that nested forms would inherit behaviour or  </s>
<s> attributes from their parent forms, or that they have particular semantics?  </s>
<s> # 2.1 Extensions to the input element  </s>
<s> # time input type Should the time provided by the user be converted into UTC for  </s>
<s> submission?  </s>
<s> If not, this has the odd side-effect that a datetime input field will submit different values to two controls of 'date' and 'time' type.  </s>
<s> Why does the 'time' type only contain hours and minutes, and not seconds?  </s>
<s> # integer and numeric types Although the suggestion that UAs not convert numbers from string form to binary form is a good one for the reasons described, I do not believe that it is reasonable to assume that UAs will be able to enforce minimum, maximum, or integer constraints without converting the number to binary.  </s>
<s> # email type Strictly speaking, removing the FWS and CFWS tokens from the addr-spec grammar prevents odd, but valid, email addresses such as "foo bar"@example.org  </s>
<s> from being valid, from what I can see.  </s>
<s> # tel type The 'global-phone-number' type from RFC 2806 is intended to represent machines and modems.  </s>
<s> I don't think that it matters in this case, particularly, though I thought it might be worth noting.  </s>
<s> # format of min/max/value for date and time types The format of the content of the min, max, and value attributes is not explicitly specified in the specification.  </s>
<s> I would assume that they should be the same format as the submission is expected to be made in, but I don't know what would be expected of UAs that are given valid ISO 8601 values that are not in the submission format, for example input type="date" value="2001" ; or valid ISO 8601 values that are not the same 'type' as the input field, for example: input type="week" value="2001-01-01" or input type="time" min="2001-01-01T08:30:00Z" max="2001-01-01T21:30:00Z" .  </s>
<s> Should these be considered 'invalid' values per section 2.15, and ignored, or parsed per ISO 8601, and the relevant data extracted?  </s>
<s> # "Note: Servers should still perform type checking on submitted data, as malicious users # or rogue user agents might submit data intended to bypass this client-side type checking."  </s>
<s> Or, in the example given, user agents with no, or disabled, scripting support, which would not be able to ensure that the 'time1' time was before the 'time2' time.  </s>
<s> # 2.4 Extensions to file upload controls What security considerations exist if a non-existent file is specified via the upload control?  </s>
<s> Presumably this is something that existing UAs do, rather than a new requirement?  </s>
<s> # accept attribute The paragraph describing that UAs may allow the user to override the MIME type of a file should be strengthened to clarify that UAs should not allow the user to override the MIME type merely to allow the upload to proceed, but only to correct the MIME type if it is incorrect.  </s>
<s> I assume the accept attribute is not additive.  </s>
<s> For example, form accept="image/png" input type="file" accept="image/gif" would result in a file upload control that can only accept GIF images?  </s>
<s> # 2.5.  </s>
<s> Extensions to existing attributes # maxlength attribute I can see why the decision was made, but it does seem odd to prevent maxlength from applying to the integer input type.  </s>
<s> Additionally, it is frequently the case now that email input fields (for example) have maximum lengths due to restrictions not under the control of the author (however much we would like this not to be the case).  </s>
<s> It would be preferable to be able to specify a maximum length declaratively rather than enforce it via script or at the server-side.  </s>
<s> The same argument essentially holds for all of the email, tel, and uri types.  </s>
<s> Perhaps maxlength should be allowed for these types, but its use not recommended?  </s>
<s> # readonly attribute  </s>
<s> *Why* is it not possible to create a readonly checkbox?  </s>
<s> (or select, or radio button).  </s>
<s> Any arguments against that situation must surely apply to text entry fields as well, so why are they exempt?  </s>
<s> # 2.6.  </s>
<s> The pattern attribute Does the pattern attribute apply if the field is empty?  </s>
<s> I assume not, but this is not described.  </s>
<s> # 2.7.  </s>
<s> The required attribute Is whitespace considered significant when determining if a control 'has a value'?  </s>
<s> # 2.12.  </s>
<s> The output element Why does the output element have a name attribute?  </s>
<s> Since it cannot be successful, I assume this is only so it can be easily reflected into the global script context?  </s>
<s> # 2.13.  </s>
<s> The implied form for form controls with no form element I think it would be very confusing to have an anonymous form node that appears in the 'forms' collection and has the document as a parent, but does not 'appear in the document'.  </s>
<s> If you do decide to allow the anonymous form to be present in the DOM (and I don't see why not), the position in the DOM should be fully specified, as some applications will depend upon the exact position in the DOM.  </s>
<s> It is also not clear when the anonymous form is created ("when required", but even that isn't thoroughly explained).  </s>
<s> I do not entirely follow the comments about the anonymous form and evil QA engineers, so I'll leave that to someone else.  </s>
<s> # 3.1.  </s>
<s> Introduction for authors Great example, by the way!  </s>
<s> # 3.5.  </s>
<s> The repetition model Should mutation events fire in addition to the repetition events described in this section?  </s>
<s> If so, do they fire before or after the repetition events?  </s>
<s> # 4.1.  </s>
<s> Bubbling semantics How could a bubbling form event get to the #document node without passing through a form node?  </s>
<s> Either the form control has a form attribute, or if not, it either has a form as a parent, or it will use the anonymous form.  </s>
<s> Or are you thinking of form events targeted manually at non-form controls?  </s>
<s> Should redirection via the form attribute only work for form controls?  </s>
<s> In the example below, to which form does the button belong?  </s>
<s> Will the  </s>
<s> events generated by the button bubble into the form element after the p element, or into the anonymous form?  </s>
<s> # 4.5.  </s>
<s> Form validation When focussing the event during form validation failure, should the UA fire focus events?  </s>
<s> # 5.3.  </s>
<s> application/x-www-form+xml: XML submission # file element, type attribute The type attribute should not be mandatory.  </s>
<s> What is the correct behaviour for a client that does not know the correct MIME type of a file: application/octet-stream?  </s>
<s> This is worse than nothing - if the client does not know, it should not provide.  </s>
<s> The example shown later indicates that the charset parameter on the MIME type is allowed.  </s>
<s> Are any other parameters allowed?  </s>
<s> Again, what if the charset of the document is unknown - can the parameter be omitted?  </s>
<s> # 5.4.  </s>
<s> text/plain # values of file upload controls.  </s>
<s> The pathname of files should not be sent, for security reasons.  </s>
<s> # 5.5.7.  </s>
<s> For javascript: actions  </s>
<s> # For the POST action Are there security considerations in allowing the form data to add variables to global scope?  </s>
<s> For example, non-replaceable properties.  </s>
<s> Is the scope that the form data will be added to the same scope as used by other scripts on the same page, or a temporary scope that is cloned from the default global scope for the duration of the form submission?  </s>
<s> (In other words: a. Can a javascript: action affect the global scope after submission, and b.  </s>
<s> If so, is the form data set removed from the global scope after submission?)  </s>
<s> # 6.1.  </s>
<s> Seeding a form with initial values Accessing a file on the local filesystem would have security considerations, even given the constraints on the content of the file specified in the second paragraph.  </s>
<s> Include a comment to the effect that access to file:// content is generally not permitted for untrusted content.  </s>
<s> Is 'an XML MIME type' a well-defined term?  </s>
<s> What is the recommended MIME type for a 'form data' XML file - application/xml?  </s>
<s> Is it allowable to specify that we can process only certain 'subsets' of XML?  </s>
<s> See TAG issue xmlProfiles-29:  </s>
<s> # "If the element cannot be given the value specified, ..." Can a typed input field be given an invalid value?  </s>
<s> Should UAs ignore, for example, an impossible value, say the value 'today' for a datetime input field?  </s>
<s> Or is this dependent on how the UA presents the control, and so implementation-dependent?  </s>
<s> # 6.2.  </s>
<s> Filling select elements Similar comments on the opening paragraphs as were already mentioned for 6.1.  </s>
<s> Should the UA also ignore PIs and so on, as per 6.1, when reading XML for the contents of select elements?  </s>
<s> A fairly common situation for web authors is to have two lists, where the contents of the second depends on the value of the first.  </s>
<s> Is there any way we could extend the current model to include this functionality?  </s>
<s> # 7.1.  </s>
<s> Additions specific to the HTMLFormElement interface Is ERROR_USER_DEFINED persistent?  </s>
<s> That is, once set with setValidity(), is there anything that can unset it (resetting the form, for example?).  </s>
<s> # willConsiderForSubmission() What is this expected to be used for?  </s>
<s> Why is the example function called 'focussed'?  </s>
<s> # 7.7.  </s>
<s> Resetting form controls Does resetting form controls also fire formchange events?  </s>
<s> # 7.9.  </s>
<s> Loading remote documents # "These method is asynchronous, and are guarenteed to not finish loading the document # or signal an error before the running script either completes or yields to the user..." Isn't it more accurate to say that they are not guaranteed to *start* loading the document until the script completes or yields?  </s>
<s> # References The reference you quote for ISO8601 is, of course, the normative one, although it would be very useful to include the following as an informative reference:  </s>
<s> ## general  </s>
<s> How should an author determine whether the client UA supports this specification?  </s>
<s> The natural way would be to provide a feature to be tested via the hasFeature method of the DOMImplementation interface, though that assumes that the client has scripting capability.  </s>
<s> Agreed.  </s>
<s> I have added new sections and expanded the existing ones.  </s>
<s> Please let me know if the new text is clearer or still needs work, in your opinion.  </s>
<s> I have used your text verbatim!  </s>
<s> Thanks!  </s>
<s> I disagree that this should be a design requirement.  </s>
<s> There are some  </s>
<s> features in particular which only apply to XHTML (and can't apply to HTML since the parsing rules there are much less tractable).  </s>
<s> Hopefully the introduction of a new section there should help with this.  </s>
<s> Fixed.  </s>
<s> Indeed.  </s>
<s> In HTML this is now disallowed.  </s>
<s> In XHTML it's a non-issue really, might as well allow it since people have to code for it anyway.  </s>
<s> This should be clearer now.  </s>
<s> Because in my experience, almost all sites on the Web that have time fields only ask for hours and minutes.  </s>
<s> Indeed the only site I can recall seeing with a seconds field basically forced it to 00!  </s>
<s> Yeah, unfortunately that is true, hence the "if you can't do this" part which defines how to handle that case.  </s>
<s> Good point.  </s>
<s> I've made the exclusion slightly more surgical so as to not exclude any valid addresses but still exclude comments.  </s>
<s> Yeah.  </s>
<s> That was my feeling too.  </s>
<s> Ignored, due to the text "if the minimum value is not in exactly the expected format, there is no minimum restriction".  </s>
<s> (The format is "the format specified for the relevant type" which is listed in the section above this one.)  </s>
<s> Good point.  </s>
<s> The whole validation thing is a new requirement.  </s>
<s> I'm just ensuring that the new validation thing doesn't leak information about what files exist and what files don't.  </s>
<s> Yeah.  </s>
<s> Not that we'll ever be able to really enforce this.  </s>
<s> Yes. Clarified (I hope...).  </s>
<s> Allowing it wouldn't allow anything that "max" and "precision" don't control, and would be somewhat strange.  </s>
<s> Ugh. I guess.  </s>
<s> Do I have to support that?  </s>
<s> I don't want people being "helpful" and adding limits for no reason.  </s>
<s> There is no such thing as a readonly check box or radio button.  </s>
<s> Look in any GUI manual.  </s>
<s> A readonly input text field is pretty dubious on the Web too, in fact.  </s>
<s> (It's better to just use a span .)  </s>
<s> This is now described.  </s>
<s> This is now described.  </s>
<s> Correct.  </s>
<s> This entire section has been removed.  </s>
<s> Thanks!  </s>
<s> This should now be specified.  </s>
<s> I was covering all bases, just in case (your last example is one possibility).  </s>
<s> Anyway, having removed the implied form, this is now much simpler.  </s>
<s> Yes.  </s>
<s> None (or the implied form, when that was still part of the spec).  </s>
<s> The form attribute on the p element has no effect.  </s>
<s> That has been clarified.  </s>
<s> Fair point.  </s>
<s> Fixed.  </s>
<s> Hopefully clarified.  </s>
<s> Fair enough.  </s>
<s> (Although I do believe UAs already do this, and have not heard of any security complaints about it.)  </s>
<s> I am not aware of any.  </s>
<s> That should be clarified now.  </s>
<s> Let me know if you can think of a better definition.  </s>
<s> This section is just for completeness really, anyway.  </s>
<s> I don't really expect it to ever be used.  </s>
<s> Agreed.  </s>
<s> Added references to RFC3023.  </s>
<s> That isn't specified, is it?  </s>
<s> The UA is expected to be a fully conformant XML UA.  </s>
<s> Or did I accidentally profile XML...?  </s>
<s> I've added some text to make this clearer.  </s>
<s> Fixed at the same time.  </s>
<s> The current algorithm does actually say this.  </s>
<s> :-)  </s>
<s> Hmm. I'll think about it, but nothing comes up to mind right away.  </s>
<s> Clarified.  </s>
<s> I had a use case!  </s>
<s> I cannot remember what it is though.  </s>
<s> I may remove this unless I can remember it again.  </s>
<s> Good point.  </s>
<s> Added notes on this in some places (although maybe I need to refactor all the resetting stuff into one place at some point).  </s>
<s> They can start loadnig the documents whenever, just so long as nothing detectable by script happens until the script is done!  </s>
<s> It's the first Google hit for "ISO 8601", I don't think I need mention it in the spec.  </s>
<s> This is a good question.  </s>
<s> I don't know.  </s>
<s> Ideally a UA needs to be detected on the server side ("does it support data= or not?").  </s>
<s> I have no answer for this at the moment.  </s>
<s> Suggestions welcome.  </s>
<s> Thanks for your input, it has been very, very useful.  </s>
<s> I would love to hear your comments if you have more.  </s>
<s> In particular, I have made several major changes and many minor changes over the last few weeks, and would love to  </s>
<s> hear your input.  </s>
<s> When the draft is next stable, I'll mention it on my blog (and hopefully other, more public places) again.  </s>
<s> Cheers, Ian Hickson )\._.,--....,'``.  </s>
<s> fL U+1047E /, _.. \ _\ ;`._ ,.  </s>
<s> Hi Ian, This message is just a reply to your previous comments, and not a comprehensive re-review of the latest draft.  </s>
<s> Having said that, when I do refer to the current draft, I'll mean the version dated 15th January 2004.  </s>
<s> Original section numbers still refer to the draft of 25th December, numbers following in brackets, where used, refer to the current draft.  </s>
<s> That's much clearer now (though the title of the document is still 'Proposed XHTML Module: ...'; I suppose that can't be helped).  </s>
<s> Agreed, on reflection.  </s>
<s> It's not so much a requirement as a pre-condition or assumption, anyway.  </s>
<s> In any case, the changes to the rest of the introduction mean that this isn't important now.  </s>
<s> I was expecting to see this in the table in Appendix A, but I see you've just added it to the prose following.  </s>
<s> I guess that's ok, because the text in the prose couldn't easily be expressed as a table.  </s>
<s> However, you do introduce the table with 'Specifically, the Forms Extensions Module supports:', which did seem to me to suggest that the table was a comprehensive list.  </s>
<s> The behaviour is clearer, but there's still no rationale.  </s>
<s> Is this change purely to relax where form can appear?  </s>
<s> A nested form does not have any semantic value or additional behaviour - is it just that it's harder to prevent nesting than to allow it?  </s>
<s> Ok then, conversely: Why does the 'datetime' type contain a seconds field?  </s>
<s> Ok, but note that now the range of valid email addresses doesn't actually match anything in RFC2822, so the text 'An e-mail address, as defined by [RFC2822] [...]' isn't entirely accurate.  </s>
<s> Agreed completely, though 'precision' wasn't in the version I originally reviewed ;)  </s>
<s> [maxlength should apply to the email type]  </s>
<s> Yes please.  </s>
<s> For example, bugzilla seems to limit email addresses to 25(!) characters.  </s>
<s> If they converted to using input type="email" they'd still want to enforce this limit on the client (as well as the server, of course - the client just allows immediate user feedback).  </s>
<s> Yes, I got confused between readonly and disabled.  </s>
<s> Ignore that.  </s>
<s> # select editable I said earlier that I wouldn't re-review the new draft completely, but I have noticed that you've removed the 'editable select'.  </s>
<s> That's a pity, as I thought that was one of the more promising parts of the draft - did you run into a problem somewhere?  </s>
<s> There shouldn't be, now; the clarification you made clearly states that the form data object is added to the scope chain, and not, as I originally thought, replacing the properties in the 'default' global scope.  </s>
<s> Ah, no, you didn't.  </s>
<s> I thought you were prohibiting PIs and CDATA blocks, but you're not, you're ignoring them, so that's ok.  </s>
<s> I assume you're referring to step 3 ('All nodes outside the select are ignored [...]').  </s>
<s> I'm not sure how an XML file can ever have nodes 'outside' its root element, but then I'm not an expert.  </s>
<s> Perhaps some clarification here?  </s>
<s> What is the point of 'select.data  </s>
<s> = select.data;'  </s>
<s> in the example?  </s>
<s> Is it a mistake, or is there some magic I'm missing here?  </s>
<s> Well, maybe DOMImplementation.hasFeature?  </s>
<s> ;) I know it's not perfect.  </s>
<s> See for example, this quote from, er, yourself: # This is exactly the problem that DOM authors that use hasFeature() # have run into.  </s>
<s> UAs claim to implement, say, DOM2 Core, but don't # support getAttributeByNS() correctly.  </s>
<s> # -- http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2004Jan/0001.html  </s>
<s> However, it is a good start.  </s>
<s> If hasFeature() returns false, it's reasonable to assume that the UA doesn't support the spec, since hasFeature() is one of the easiest things to implement.  </s>
<s> Detecting bugs in implementations can then be left to browser sniffing scripts (client- or server-side).  </s>
<s> I don't think we need to announce support for this spec via the HTTP headers, and I can't think of many other options.  </s>
<s> I'm planning to do another comprehensive review once the draft is next stable.  </s>
<s> Regards, Malcolm  </s>
