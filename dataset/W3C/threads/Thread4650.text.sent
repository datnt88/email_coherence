It may be worth noting that (unfortunately) XML 1.1 is planning to change the white space rules and add x85 and x2028. 
This will mean that XSLT using an XML 1.1 parser on a document containing an x85 will see a x10 which will be normalised by this function, whereas the same expression in an Xquery query on the same document will see a non-white space character that will not be normalised (unless Xquery plans to adopt the XML 1.1 rules). 
My preferred solution would be to not change the XML white space rules (A comment has been sent to the XML editor list) but assuming that XML 1.1 does do this, it may be worth adding a note here as it will likely to be a cause of apparent incompatibility between xslt and xquery.

Both go through XML parsing in the same way. 
The only difference is that newlines in an XSLT stylesheet are handled differently from newlines in an XQuery query. 
I'm not convinced this is a problem, except to the extent that the non-XML-ness of a query is a problem anyway. 
Michael Kay Sorry you are right, please disregard my comment.
