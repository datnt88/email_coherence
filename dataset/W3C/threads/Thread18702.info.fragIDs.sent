<s> Hi Ian &amp; list, How are you?  </s>
<s> Should I make any of my previous comments about Linux compliance in the last call?  </s>
<s> (Or have I already done this?) Thanks.  </s>

<s> Hi JP, I'm just back from vacation (hence lack of responsiveness over last 10 days).  </s>
<s> It was my impression that your comments fell into two categories: * Suggestions for coordination with Linux developers (which are very helpful).  </s>
<s> * Requests for clarification about the existence of APIs, controls, etc. in the Linux environment.  </s>
<s> It is my impression that these issues lie outside of UAAG 1.0 (but within the scope of the Techniques Document, where this information is found).  </s>
<s> I don't think these are new issues the concern UAAG 1.0.  </s>
<s> What is most helpful to us is if you suggest concrete new text for either document to clarify the points you found inadequate.  </s>
<s> Thank you, - Ian  </s>
