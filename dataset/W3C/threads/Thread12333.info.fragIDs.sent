<s> XHTML1.1 is a significant cleanup of legacy intermixing of presentation with structure and content.  </s>
<s> I have just today noted two changes affecting accessibility.  </s>
<s> I guess the reasons, I was not party to discussion of why.  </s>
<s> I note that in Appendix A: Changes from XHTML 1.0  </s>
<s> XHTML 1.1 represents a departure from both HTML 4.0 and XHTML 1.0.  </s>
<s> Most significant is the removal of features that were deprecated.  </s>
<s> In addition, some features that were available have been removed.  </s>
<s> In general, the strategy is to define a markup language that is rich in structural functionality, but that relies upon style sheets for presentation.  </s>
<s> 1. Drops from the anchor a ... the attributes tabindex and accesskey.  </s>
<s> These had significant accessibility use.  </s>
<s> The tabindex allowed short-circuiting the linear tab ordering, to allow a short-circuiting of long lists of links in the left-most column.  </s>
<s> Only those with explicitly enumerated tabindex="#" were considered.  </s>
<s> When these were exhausted, the unenumerated ones were considered in the order from the sequence in the document instance.  </s>
<s> Problems included skipped values, and duplicate values.  </s>
<s> I do not know why they were dropped.  </s>
<s> The workaround is to put the list of jump links before the long list in the leftmost column (often in a single leftmost cell of a layout table.)  </s>
<s> If the intent with XHTML1.1 is to have stylesheets replace layout tables, those existing documents with a layout table and tabindex would no longer have the benefit of the short-circuited behavior when tabbing through the links.  </s>
<s> The accesskey feature allowed author-assignment of a shortcut key pattern to a navigation action.  </s>
<s> These could override conventions of a particular operating system or application, so could become confusing.  </s>
<s> The accesskey assignments have no universally agreed use, so behaviors were uncertain.  </s>
<s> 2. XHTML1.1 drops support for the following element types.  </s>
<s> Most have been deprecated in prior versions of HTML or XHTML1.0: base basefont center font  </s>
<s> frame frameset iframe isindex menu noframes object s strike u The loss of object, with its list of alternative renderings, provided a default means to append as the last option a textual description of a non-textual object.  </s>
<s> This is presumably replaced by use of such textual description within each individual non-textual object.  </s>
<s> That static description is available for any reference to it, and can somehow be exposed as a user preference.  </s>
<s> Different references to such an object that need to use different descriptions would need to include those in the referencing context.  </s>
<s> Is this a coordination group issue?  </s>
<s> If so, someone please take it to CG. Regards/Harvey Bingham  </s>
<s> Hello, I'm one of the staff contacts for the HTML Working Group, so I will clarify the issues.  </s>
<s> Unfortunately there's a bunch of editorial errors in this appendix.  </s>
<s> I have pointed them out [1] and those errors will be fixed in the next edition.  </s>
<s> [1] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-html-editor/2000JanMar/0027  </s>
<s> This is editorial error, and actually those are not dropped, as pointed out by [1].  </s>
<s> After long discussion, the object element has finally been included in XHTML 1.1.  </s>
<s> Steven Pemberton, the chair of the HTML WG, posted the clarification to the www-html list [2].  </s>
<s> [2] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-html/2000Jun/0017  </s>
<s> Note that the HTML WG is committed to re-engineer the object inclusion mechanism in XHTML 2.0.  </s>

<s> HB:: "Is this a coordination group issue?  </s>
<s> If so, someone please take it to CG." WL: I believe CG is an intra-WAI thing and this needs to go "upstairs" since XHTML 1.1 is a W3C undertaking.  </s>
<s> I imagine that it's also germane to PF just on general principles.  </s>
<s> Love.  </s>
