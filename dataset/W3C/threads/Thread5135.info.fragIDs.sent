<s> I believe this should be rdf:about not rdf:ID.  </s>
<s> The latter gets expanded  </s>
<s> in context of base URI, but shouldn't itself contain characters beyond XML NCName.  </s>
<s> So you could either write rdf:ID="EarDrops" assuming a base URI context of http://tap.stanford.edu/data/  </s>
<s> or else write rdf:about="http://tap.stanford.edu/data/EarDrops".  </s>

<s> Cool. I'd like to recommend TAP as one of the 'bulk' namespaces that could be used inside FOAF files, eg. for describing weblog post topics,  </s>

<s> Is are deploying?  </s>
<s> Should it be OK to encourage folk to write RDF using this namespace and expect it to be dereference-able over the coming years...?  </s>
<s> cheers, Dan  </s>
<s> Yes, I thought I'd fixed that and was about to send a reply saying that I just hadn't updated that KB fragment in a while (we don't get much data on ear drops these days), but it turns out that the Perl code still had something in there to generate it.  </s>
<s> I fixed that but I haven't regenerated the KBs yet.  </s>
<s> Thanks.  </s>
<s> Yes, we're sprinkling it everywhere and it's going to be very hard to remove, so you should consider it dereferencable for a long time.  </s>
<s> I haven't updated the SDK or the KB downloads in a while, partially because  </s>
<s> there hasn't been much interest, and partially because it takes effort.  </s>
<s> Is there interest now?  </s>
<s> I suppose if I just update them that may create some interest.  </s>

<s> That's good to know  </s>
<s> I suppose there's an element of chicken and egg here.  </s>
<s> TAP project and list seemed a bit quiet, so people don't play with it so much.  </s>
<s> And people don't encourage you so you spend your cycles on other things.  </s>
<s> For the record I'm a big TAP fan.  </s>
<s> IMHO the future of RDF interestingness is very much at the instance-data level, rather than clever-clever ontologies defined using detailed formal rules.  </s>
<s> Ontologies are all about making sweeping generalisations about the world.  </s>
<s> I guess there's a role for that, but the space between trivial/crass ("People and Documents are disjoint") and contentiously detailed ("all humans are Male or Female") isn't a rich as some think.  </s>
<s> TAP appeals to me because it takes a  </s>
<s> very pragmatic approach, and does just enough of the generalities to provide something to hang detailed instance data on.  </s>
<s> The reference by description approach (http://tap.stanford.edu/tap/rbd.html  </s>
<s> etc) is much needed.  </s>
<s> Both these aspects of TAP are common I think to the approach we've taken with FOAF, where the approach is also about getting some actual data out there (in our case distributed and harvestable), and about finding conventions for identifying things without appeal to the 'everything has a URI and everyone knows it' fairytale.  </s>
<s> So that's why I'm interested to plug TAP data and vocab into FOAF.  </s>
<s> cheers, Dan  </s>
<s> Actually, what I meant was that I don't spend my time releasing things to people.  </s>
<s> TAP is what I spend my time on, it's just a question of whether or not I take the time to test, polish, and support a new release.  </s>
<s> I agree with that assessment, and I think that it shows in a lot of TAP's design and focus.  </s>
<s> I agree that languages like OWL do have a role, and that they're not as rich as some believe, and the two examples you cite are very good ones.  </s>
<s> These two examples are excellent for performing knowledge validation, ensuring that a scraper didn't go awry, or when putting information from two sites together and trying to decide what lines up to what, but as far as new insights that can be gained from such rules I still haven't seen a compelling example.  </s>
<s> I'm glad you like that aspect of it, because it gets the least attention despite its being the real core of the thing.  </s>
<s> The assertion that everything has a URI is exactly what RBD is made to avoid, and it's important enough to us that we designed the system around it.  </s>
