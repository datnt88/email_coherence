I have been trying to edit the P3P issues list (http://www.w3.org/P3P/Group/Specification/p3p-issues.html) with Amaya 3.1. 
Amaya seems to crash periodically when doing this. 
For example, I accidently added a column, then removed the column, and Amaya promptly crashed. 
Also, I have been unable to figure out how to change the background color of a cell. 
Any suggestions?

I tried to do the same, but I did not manage to make Amaya crash. 
Could you provide more details about the operations you made? 
Sure! Click any character in the cell and select the cell with key F2 (for Windows. 
In Unix it's Esc). 
Look at the message area, at the bottom of the window: it should say td\tr\tbody... Then choose Colors in the Style menu. 
You get a color palette. 
Click on the color you want with the right button. 
That's it. 
Note that this creates a style attribute with the CSS property background-color. 
If you prefer to use the HTML bgcolor attribute, select the cell, and choose bgcolor in the Attributes menu. 
Then you have to type the RGB color you want. 
If you use the first method, you can make sure you use exactly the same color as another cell. 
Select first a cell that has the desired color. 
Then, display the color palette (Style/Colors). 
The color of the selected cell is highlighted in the palette. 
You can then select another cell. 
You just have to click on the highlighted color in the palette to paint it the same.

select the TD element, then menu /attributes/bgcolor. to select the TD element you can use the structure view or click in the cell you want to change and make ESC till the TD is selected (see the status bar)
