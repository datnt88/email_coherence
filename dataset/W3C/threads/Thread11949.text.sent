Microsoft is always open to constructive feedback concerning it's products. 
If you have specific problems or concerns, please let me know and I'll see what I can do to have them rectified. 
Charles Oppermann Program Manager, Accessibility and Disabilities Group, Microsoft Corporation "A computer on every desk and in every home, usable by everyone!" Programs like Word, Notes, etc, which can be used to generate web content should have the same guidelines applied to them as any other authoring tool, except that they would apply when material is being saved as HTML. 
In other words, saving as HTML should produce a review of the documents as Carl suggested for authoring tools proper. 
Although it may indeed be difficult to convince manufacturers to implement these, we should not therefore say OK, it doesn't matter then. 
These programs are being used to generate HTML, look like becoming the greatest culprits in making the web inaccessible, and are increasingly popular because people are already familiar with them. 
If these products are rated as producing inaccessible, then those purchasers who are looking to produce accessible material will create a market pressure for the manufacturers to adopt the guidelines.

I think that rather than address specific concerns (eg I hate the way Word produces HTML with font markup tags) I think the real concern is will Microsoft implement the AU guidelines in the various tools which provide HTML publishing as a secondary function, such as Word, Publisher, etc. 
It seems that there is some debate as to whether we should ask this of Microsoft (and everyone else in the same position) and I think the answer is very emphatically yes we should. 
I'm only trying to say - if you see a bug: report it! 
Not everything has to be a policy matter...
