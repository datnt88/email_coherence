<s> I'm having several problems with the Amaya 1.2a binary for Solaris 2.5.  </s>
<s> I cannot get it to print.  </s>
<s> I've tried entering the appropriate string both into the "SetUp and print" dialog box and "THOTPRINTER=" in ".thotrc" to no avail.  </s>

<s> This message comes from your proxy or your firewall and not from Amaya.  </s>

<s> Why not?  </s>
<s> It's not hard to subscribe to it and it simplifies things for us.  </s>
<s> Hope this helps, -Jose  </s>
<s> Yes, I knew that.  </s>
<s> (I should've noted that I'm also the firewall admin.)  </s>
<s> In my $HOME/.thotrc  </s>
<s> file: HTTP_PROXY=http://firewall.medar.com:8080  </s>
<s> Which is as per the docs.  </s>
<s> This is the same proxy setting as used for all of the various browsers I mentioned in my original email.  </s>
