Currently the createCSSStyleSheet method under the DOMImplementationCSS interface does not throw any exceptions. 
Should this method throw a SYNTAX_ERR exception in the case that the media DOMString has a syntax error and is unparsable? 
Also, Under Section 5.2, the insertRule method of the CSSMediaRule interface the description for the 'rule' parameter states that it is "The parsable text representing the rule. 
For rule sets this contains both the selector and the style declaration. 
For at-rules, this specifies both the at-identifier and the rule content." 
Should this actually say something like "The parsable text representing the rule sets' selector and style declaration."? 
Any at rules would generate SYNTAX_ERR exceptions.
