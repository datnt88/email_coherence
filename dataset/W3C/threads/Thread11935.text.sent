Ian sends from Wendy: "Another possible use of the TITLE element is to provide alt-text for images used as linke to pages when authors don't provide alt-text. 
In this case, a brower could grab the contents of the TITLE element of the document being pointed to and use this as the alt-text." 
WL:: I don't think this is the venue for this because: 1) it doesn't deal with authoring *Tool* possibilities, rather is mainly for browsers; 2) it's not likely to "provide [USEFUL] alt-text for images..." since the TITLE isn't apt to give much info about any particular IMG. 
Love. 
ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE Hi, I agree. 
It may be a good last chance solution for browsers but it shouldn't become an ALT text substitute. 
We may howeve want to emphasize good TITLE-ing of documents within authoring tools. 
- Jan This is a powerful safetynet type of idea - but we have to be careful in implementation or this could cause a LOT of extra web traffic. 
and slow page loading... if every page without alt text does a fetch of the title for each of the links on the page. 
However, if we set it up so that it is not done automatically it should be fine. 
That is, if it were a user option or done on user request. 
Then the titles would only be fetched if the user was looking at blank image anchors and had no idea what they pointed to. 
No substitute for ALT, but a very nice safety net. 
So this would really be a UA issue primarily - with titles being important for it to work. 
So I will post this (separately) over there.

- Jan element is to don't contents of the the doesn't browsers; since to follow up on what David Poehlman said: It is a question of when you GET the page that the link leads to. 
The idea is that if there is an un-explained link in page A which leads to page B, then why not pre-fetch page B and extract its TITLE which would then be displayed as the link text in page A where there is a link to page B. Maybe the best thing to do with this technique is to experiment with it under the WAI-ERT umbrella. 
It may be that it is a reasonable source of ALT text suggestions for authors. 
Or it may turn out that authors who insert image links without ALT, link to authors who post pages without TITLE. 
There are options in HTTP where you can get just the top n bytes of a page, so we don't absolutely have to pre-fetch the whole page. 
But the text of the page is not the bandwidth problem, anyway. 
For Author prompting, if there is a META SUMMARY tag which has been inserted to make search engine hits format cleanly, that is golden and the SUMMARY should be used as a clue if the author of the referring page can't quickly come up with link text. 
But simply a tiled over/under display of the "from" and "to" points of the link (positioned viewframe selected from HTML document) is what may make the most sense as an aid in authoring. 
For authoring, what is critical is to communicate the link [ALT] text question to the author as an issue of continuity. 
Everybody has had their composition teacher tell them they need to scrub up their continuity at some time in their life. 
Hope this helps. 
I haven't reviewed the full context.
