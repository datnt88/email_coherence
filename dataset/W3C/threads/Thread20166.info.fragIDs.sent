<s> Amaya maintainers, There a number of problems with the source.  </s>
<s> 1/ Why do you recommend to do "gmake all"???  </s>
<s> If you have configured the project so as to build only some modules, that does not seem a good idea.  </s>
<s> 2/ The "gmake" command stops before finishing, even though there is no error; it has to be restarted.  </s>
<s> There are also lots of messages about this or that file having "modification time in the future", which, taken at face value, is ridiculous.  </s>
<s> 3/ The Makefile in libwww/Library/src is missing a reference to the zlib include dir in INCLUDES; without it HTZip.c will not compile  </s>
<s> 4/ pluginlib/editplugin.c tries to include a non-existant app.h  </s>
<s> That one has me stumped: like I said, there is _no_ app.h in the entire amaya source tree  </s>
<s> 5/ The error archive URL (http://opera.inrialpes.fr/amaya/messages/) is dead.  </s>
<s> Your advice re. 4/ would be appreciated.  </s>
<s> Thanks, Olivier Lefevre  </s>
<s> System and build details * 'uname -a' returns "SunOS ny2p57swk 5.6 Generic_105181-11 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-1" * gmake and gcc versions are 3.75 and 2.95, resp.  </s>
<s> * the configure command was "../configure --prefix=/home/lefevrol/amaya --with-x --with-motif --with-amaya --enable-plugin --enable-math" * the outputs of configure and gmake (restarted 3 times, as per above) is attached as a single zip file This message contains confidential information and is intended only for the individual named.  </s>

<s> I'll leave the other questions to the Amaya team.  </s>
<s> This problem has nothing to do with Amaya, but with your computer.  </s>
<s> Are any of the files you are compiling on an NFS mount?  </s>
<s> If so, then the clock of your machine (where gmake is running) is out of synch with the clock on the NFS server (which put the timestamp on the files).  </s>
<s> If it is complaining about a file you just edited, you can "touch" the file - which should timestamp it with your clock, instead of the NFS server's clock.  </s>

<s> We want to be sure that comilers are generated at the first time.  </s>
<s> Otherwise "make" or "gmake" is enough.  </s>
<s> That is due to a problem of with your file system.  </s>
<s> The zlib is used both by hte libpng and the libwww.  </s>
<s> We have only one instance which is located in the sub-directory Amaya/libpng/zlib The Amaya Makefile should get zlib information from the right place.  </s>
<s> That is a bug in the current distribution.  </s>
<s> Due to problems on Windows platforms (Windows is not cas sensitive) we changed that file name to appstruct.h and we forgot to update the include in the file editplugin.c  </s>
<s> The URI for the archive is http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-amaya/  </s>
<s> Regards Irene.  </s>
<s> TO:Irene.Vatton@inrialpes.fr  </s>
<s> By the way, since I cannot easily cure it (I am not root and cannot mess with the clocks), is the "file has modification date in the future" problem merely an  </s>
<s> annoyance or will it screw up the compilation?  </s>
<s> I.e., should I give up here?  </s>

<s> You can try compiling Amaya on a local disk, rather than on an nfs mounted one.  </s>
