Also, one thing that consistently bugs me is the required href attribute on loc. 
It drives me nuts to keep the following kind of thing in sync: loc href="http://www.w3.org" http://www.w3.org /loc I do this all the time in issue and comment resolution markup. 
I wish to be able to write one of these instead. 
loc href="http://www.w3.org"/ loc http://www.w3.org /loc What prevents you from writing the former? 
It's content is #PCDATA which can be empty. 
(You seem to be getting close to asking for something that smells a lot like SGML's CONREF! 
I have to say I liked that too, but it was decided to leave that out of XML.) Also, one thing that consistently bugs me is the required href attribute on loc.

loc href="http://www.w3.org"/ loc http://www.w3.org /loc What's missing is the convention to expand this appropriately. 
Of course such a convention can be added if we think that empty content isn't used otherwise. 
But it then has to be added to all the stylesheets/transformations that work with it. 
It's a very useful thing, but not something that needs special treatment.

Is there an element similar to HTML's BLOCKQUOTE? 
quote seems to be a phrase-level element. 
None yet, but I'll treat this as a request and add something like it for the next release.

loc href="http://www.w3.org"/ loc http://www.w3.org /loc The problem is that sometimes you don't want the content to repeat the URL; you want it to say something in English. 
Basically, loc is like A. We could make the semantics be CONREF-like; I have no problem with that. 
(That is, when the content is empty, repeat the href value as the content in the output.) Comments?

Sounds reasonable to me.

loc href="http://www.w3.org"/ loc http://www.w3.org /loc Only that it may be easier to support the second form than the first. 
Supporting the first form would be as you describe, and requires a check for empty content, which is often (always?) complicated. 
(I.e. 
I don't know how to do it in XSLT, and the way I have done it in homebrew systems is invariably a fairly ugly hack.) Supporting the second seems simpler: print the content as is, and if href is unspecified, then use the content as its value.
