Hello all, I hereby propose the inclusion of GBK and GB18030 charsets in the IANA charset registry. 
(Hope you don't mind all the CCs. 
I think it would be nice if all the GB18030 experts can comment and contribute to this registration as a community effort. 
:-) GB2312 (1980) has been superceded by GBK (circa 1993?) and GB18030 (2000). 
GBK has been widely used by mainland Chinese for a very long time, and GB18030, which supercedes GBK, is a mandatory standard in Mainland China August 30, 2001. 
GBK extends GB2312 to include the CJK compatibility area defined in Unicode 2.1. 
GBK quickly became very popular in China. 
All major GNU/Linux and UNIX platforms (Red Flag, XteamLinux, Turbolinux, BluePoint, COSIX, etc.), as well as Microsoft Windows, have supported GBK for years. 
It is equivalent to codepage 936 in Windows. 
Many web pages already use GBK encoding. 
For example, the character "Rong" in Premier Zhu Rongji's is missing from GB2312 and can be displayed only in GBK. 
GB18030 further extends GBK. 
It covers 1-byte, 2-byte and 4-byte codepoints while maintaining full backward compatibility with GB2312 and GBK. 
It specifies a roundtrip conversion to and from Unicode/ISO-10646-1, and the 4-byte portion of GB18030 is calculated algorithmatically to map to corresponding codepoints in Unicode/ISO-10646-1. 
Thus, this will be the first Chinese national standard that covers all ethnic languages (Chinese, Tibetan, Mongolian, etc.) used in China. 
On behalf of fellow Chinese, I would really love to see GBK and GB18030 recognized as official charsets by IANA. 
Indeed, zh_CN.GBK and and zh_CN.GB18030 have been supported in glibc and GNU iconv for quite some time. 
Patches to add GB18030 support exist for XFree86 4.1.x and Qt-2.3.x. 
Also, Mozilla, Netscape and MSIE already also recognize and support both GBK and GB18030. 
A test page (courtesy of James Su) is at: in full under Turbolinux 7.0 and XteamLinux 4.0. 
After installing the GB18030 upgrade by Microsoft, the page also displays correctly under Windows NT/2000/XP, albeit with some fonts missing as the font provided by Microsoft isn't as complete. 
;-) Note that even in e-mail and webpages where GBK is used, Microsoft still to maintain backward compatibility, and perhaps because GBK isn't yet in IANA. 
There are also some people who may have used "x-gbk" and "x-x-gbk", but of course, that is also non-standard. 
It would be best if we standardize this to "GBK" once and for all. 
Afterall, GBK is a Chinese national specification used by millions if not billions of people. 
It is not some private vendor implementation, so the use of "x-" is inappropriate. 
:-) I am very glad that BIG5-HKSCS has been registered. 
It would be wonderful if we could get GBK and GB18030 registered too. 
:-) My question: How should we proceed? 
The Chinese government has published a printed standard for GB18030. 
It is in Chinese, and is unfortunately not available on-line. 
However, an unofficial yet authorative GB18030 Summary written by Dirk Meyer at Adobe Systems is at: 
ftp://ftp.oreilly.com/pub/examples/nutshell/cjkv/pdf/GB18030_Summary.pdf 
The complete GB18030 - Unicode conversion data (mappings and ranges) are defined here: 
Markus Scherer at IBM has also written some excellent documentation: Fellow Chinese developers like James Su, Wang Shouhua, Wu Jian, Leon Zhang, etc. have also posted some GB18030 papers in Chinese on the Internet. 
I am not sure how to contact the official Chinese standard committee who defined the GB18030 standard, but I am sure some of you may know. 
I just found a copy of the Big5-HKSCS registration on-line. 
I guess we can use that as a template, and follow RFC 2278 to write a formal application for GBK and GB18030 (in ASCII) and submit it. 
BTW, that registration is at: (Yes, there is a small typo: Submisson instead of Submission.

Here is a first draft for the GB18030 registration. 
Please edit it 
to make it look good. 
:-) Also, we need a contact person. 
Could 
someone contact the Chinese national standard committee (Ministry of Information?) Thanks!

Looks good. 
One remark, though, about MIME. 
While GB18030 is in theory usable with MIME (because it's ASCII compatible), the facts that - GB18030 characters are in unambiguous 1:1 correspondence with 21-bit Unicode characters, - the GB18030 converter is somewhat big (due to the GBK table size), 
imply that mails should better be sent in UTF-8 encoding than in GB18030 encoding. 
Because then the interoperability with mailers that don't include a GB18030 converter is increased. 
Therefore I would suggest to remove the "suitable for use in MIME" sentence. 
Bruno 
In terms of the IANA registration and of RFC 2978, "suitable for use in MIME" only requires a byte-based encoding where CR and LF have the usual ASCII control code values and byte values of 0 are only used for the NUL control code. 
This makes GB 18030 "suitable for use in MIME". 
The exact conditions are listed in RFC 2045. 
The registration does not call for how easy it is to support a charset... markus 
You got comments... ;-) 
3. A brief summary of the GB18030 codepoints is listed below: 1-byte: {00-7E}Same as ASCII (ISO 646) 
Please change this to 1-byte: {00-7F}Same as US-ASCII (ISO 646 IRV (1991)) The DEL control at 7F is included, and the reference to ASCII should be more specific. 
The ISO standard defines not only the International Reference Version (IRV==US version) but also several national variants. 
4. This registration request is specifically made since proper registration will facilitate development of Operating Systems and Internet-related software supporting GB18030.

government with inputs from major vendors and institutions to ensure full ISO 10646 / Unicode 3.x compatibility while providing a smooth migration path from GB2312 and GBK encodings. 
The proposed "GB18030" charset has been a mandatory standard in Mainland China since August 31, 2001. 
All operating systems sold on or after that date must support GB18030. 
Several major 
As far as I know, the requirement date is "on or after September 1, 2001" or "after August 31, 2001". 
operating systems already come with full GB18030 support, and other vendors will finish the transition in coming months. 
User-end applications will also fully support GB18030 in coming years. 
Full GB18030 fonts have been available for some time now. 
GB18030 is also China's solution to support minority ethnic languages such as Mongolian, Tibetan and Uyghur, as well as all other languages of the world. 
It also fulfills the needs of ancient Chinese literature research, libraries, geography, names, and more. 
Your draft is missing one item for the registration: You need to state that this charset's "Intended Usage" is "COMMON", for example at the beginning of your section 9. See the "Intended Usage" in "5. 
Charset Registration Template" in RFC 2978. 
(Thanks for mentioning material from Dirk and me :-) You might also want to point to my less technical overview article at http://oss.software.ibm.com/icu/docs/papers/gb18030.html markus 
Note from the charset reviewer: I understand that a new registration form will be sent to this list, addressing comments, and that no action from the charset reviewer is appropriate yet. 
I recommend using the registration form in RFC 2978 as at least part of the document. 
If you want publication of the whole document, the best thing may be to publish this as an RFC; this allows for including much more explanatory material. 
The first step is then to publish the document as an internet-draft.
