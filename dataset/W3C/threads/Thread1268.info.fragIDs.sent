<s> Hello all, I hereby propose the inclusion of GBK and GB18030 charsets in the IANA charset registry.  </s>
<s> (Hope you don't mind all the CCs.  </s>
<s> I think it would be nice if all the GB18030 experts can comment and contribute to this registration as a community effort.  </s>
<s> :-) GB2312 (1980) has been superceded by GBK (circa 1993?) and GB18030 (2000).  </s>
<s> GBK has been widely used by mainland Chinese for a very long time, and GB18030, which supercedes GBK, is a mandatory standard in Mainland China August 30, 2001.  </s>
<s> GBK extends GB2312 to include the CJK compatibility area defined in Unicode 2.1.  </s>
<s> GBK quickly became very popular in China.  </s>
<s> All major GNU/Linux and UNIX platforms (Red Flag, XteamLinux, Turbolinux, BluePoint, COSIX, etc.), as well as Microsoft Windows, have supported GBK for years.  </s>
<s> It is equivalent to codepage 936 in Windows.  </s>
<s> Many web pages already use GBK encoding.  </s>
<s> For example, the character "Rong" in Premier Zhu Rongji's is missing from GB2312 and can be displayed only in GBK.  </s>
<s> GB18030 further extends GBK.  </s>
<s> It covers 1-byte, 2-byte and 4-byte codepoints while maintaining full backward compatibility with GB2312 and GBK.  </s>
<s> It specifies a roundtrip conversion to and from Unicode/ISO-10646-1, and the 4-byte portion of GB18030 is calculated algorithmatically to map to corresponding codepoints in Unicode/ISO-10646-1.  </s>
<s> Thus, this will be the first Chinese national standard that covers all ethnic languages (Chinese, Tibetan, Mongolian, etc.) used in China.  </s>
<s> On behalf of fellow Chinese, I would really love to see GBK and GB18030 recognized as official charsets by IANA.  </s>
<s> Indeed, zh_CN.GBK and and zh_CN.GB18030 have been supported in glibc and GNU iconv for quite some time.  </s>
<s> Patches to add GB18030 support exist for XFree86 4.1.x and Qt-2.3.x.  </s>
<s> Also, Mozilla, Netscape and MSIE already also recognize and support both GBK and GB18030.  </s>
<s> A test page (courtesy of James Su) is at: in full under Turbolinux 7.0 and XteamLinux 4.0.  </s>
<s> After installing the GB18030 upgrade by Microsoft, the page also displays correctly under Windows NT/2000/XP, albeit with some fonts missing as the font provided by Microsoft isn't as complete.  </s>
<s> ;-) Note that even in e-mail and webpages where GBK is used, Microsoft still to maintain backward compatibility, and perhaps because GBK isn't yet in IANA.  </s>
<s> There are also some people who may have used "x-gbk" and "x-x-gbk", but of course, that is also non-standard.  </s>
<s> It would be best if we standardize this to "GBK" once and for all.  </s>
<s> Afterall, GBK is a Chinese national specification used by millions if not billions of people.  </s>
<s> It is not some private vendor implementation, so the use of "x-" is inappropriate.  </s>
<s> :-) I am very glad that BIG5-HKSCS has been registered.  </s>
<s> It would be wonderful if we could get GBK and GB18030 registered too.  </s>
<s> :-) My question: How should we proceed?  </s>
<s> The Chinese government has published a printed standard for GB18030.  </s>
<s> It is in Chinese, and is unfortunately not available on-line.  </s>
<s> However, an unofficial yet authorative GB18030 Summary written by Dirk Meyer at Adobe Systems is at:  </s>
<s> ftp://ftp.oreilly.com/pub/examples/nutshell/cjkv/pdf/GB18030_Summary.pdf  </s>
<s> The complete GB18030 - Unicode conversion data (mappings and ranges) are defined here:  </s>
<s> Markus Scherer at IBM has also written some excellent documentation: Fellow Chinese developers like James Su, Wang Shouhua, Wu Jian, Leon Zhang, etc. have also posted some GB18030 papers in Chinese on the Internet.  </s>
<s> I am not sure how to contact the official Chinese standard committee who defined the GB18030 standard, but I am sure some of you may know.  </s>
<s> I just found a copy of the Big5-HKSCS registration on-line.  </s>
<s> I guess we can use that as a template, and follow RFC 2278 to write a formal application for GBK and GB18030 (in ASCII) and submit it.  </s>
<s> BTW, that registration is at: (Yes, there is a small typo: Submisson instead of Submission.  </s>

<s> Looks good.  </s>
<s> One remark, though, about MIME.  </s>
<s> While GB18030 is in theory usable with MIME (because it's ASCII compatible), the facts that - GB18030 characters are in unambiguous 1:1 correspondence with 21-bit Unicode characters, - the GB18030 converter is somewhat big (due to the GBK table size),  </s>
<s> imply that mails should better be sent in UTF-8 encoding than in GB18030 encoding.  </s>
<s> Because then the interoperability with mailers that don't include a GB18030 converter is increased.  </s>
<s> Therefore I would suggest to remove the "suitable for use in MIME" sentence.  </s>
<s> Bruno  </s>
<s> In terms of the IANA registration and of RFC 2978, "suitable for use in MIME" only requires a byte-based encoding where CR and LF have the usual ASCII control code values and byte values of 0 are only used for the NUL control code.  </s>
<s> This makes GB 18030 "suitable for use in MIME".  </s>
<s> The exact conditions are listed in RFC 2045.  </s>
<s> The registration does not call for how easy it is to support a charset... markus  </s>
<s> You got comments... ;-)  </s>
<s> 3. A brief summary of the GB18030 codepoints is listed below: 1-byte: {00-7E}Same as ASCII (ISO 646)  </s>
<s> Please change this to 1-byte: {00-7F}Same as US-ASCII (ISO 646 IRV (1991)) The DEL control at 7F is included, and the reference to ASCII should be more specific.  </s>
<s> The ISO standard defines not only the International Reference Version (IRV==US version) but also several national variants.  </s>
<s> 4. This registration request is specifically made since proper registration will facilitate development of Operating Systems and Internet-related software supporting GB18030.  </s>
<s> Registration Requirements (as defined in RFC 2278)  </s>

<s> User-end applications will also fully support GB18030 in coming years.  </s>
<s> Full GB18030 fonts have been available for some time now.  </s>
<s> GB18030 is also China's solution to support minority ethnic languages such as Mongolian, Tibetan and Uyghur, as well as all other languages of the world.  </s>
<s> It also fulfills the needs of ancient Chinese literature research, libraries, geography, names, and more.  </s>
<s> Your draft is missing one item for the registration: You need to state that this charset's "Intended Usage" is "COMMON", for example at the beginning of your section 9. See the "Intended Usage" in "5.  </s>

<s> Note from the charset reviewer: I understand that a new registration form will be sent to this list, addressing comments, and that no action from the charset reviewer is appropriate yet.  </s>
<s> I recommend using the registration form in RFC 2978 as at least part of the document.  </s>
<s> If you want publication of the whole document, the best thing may be to publish this as an RFC; this allows for including much more explanatory material.  </s>
<s> The first step is then to publish the document as an internet-draft.  </s>
