<s> Patil I agree.  </s>
<s> The key question is, as you say ... The question now is - whether the choreography language should support references to such external state (perhaps in the form of a language to specify preconditions, post conditions, etc).  </s>
<s> ... which is the main reason I wanted to put this use case forward.  </s>
<s> Your idea of putting everything into one larger choreography becomes unweildy.  </s>
<s> For example the Order Placement choreography I gave is a "medium complexity" example of how to place an order.  </s>
<s> The simplest is where you just send an order and expect nothing in return.  </s>
<s> The other extreme is where the seller provides automatic periodic updates on the processing of the order.  </s>
<s> Our analysis at Commerce One has identified 14 different variations of how to place an order where each variation is a different choreography.  </s>
<s> In all variations: 1.  </s>
<s> The semantics of the messages are the same, and 2. Each variation can optionally include the use of a status inquiry.  </s>
<s> I also agree that we need to make a conscious decision whether this type of dependency is in, or out of, scope.  </s>

<s> The answer is "it depends".  </s>
<s> Errors associated with formatting of the overall message (e.g. HTTP, MIME or SOAP errors) should be handled at a lower level.  </s>
<s> At the other extreme some errors, e.g. "product code not recognized" can "only" be determined by the application/process/service that is processing the content of the message as, in this example, it requires validation against a database.  </s>
<s> There are also some validation errors of the content of mesages that fall in the grey area inbetween.  </s>
<s> These can sometimes be detected by an XML Parser by validating against the XML Schema and therefore could be considered as being handled at a lower level, for example an XML parser could check that a product code must be 10 characters alphanumeric and provide an "invalid format" error if it was not.  </s>

<s> e,g, - a valid US Postal code must be numeric e.g. "94511" and in a UK code a Postal Code is alphanumeric with a space in the middle, e.g. "KT11 2EN" Since errors "sometimes" have to be handled by the application/process/service I think we have to consider them when designing our approachy to handling choreographies.  </s>

<s> I agree that exception handling is a necessary component of choreography.  </s>
<s> The description that it applied to every message made me wonder if you were talking about something else.  </s>
<s> Anyway, for the visually-biased, I created a couple of diagrams to show the choreography.  </s>
<s> The first one shows the two separate choreographies as described-although I added a confirmation message (see OrderPlacementV1.jpg).  </s>
<s> The second diagram includes the error handling that was described, which adds a lot of complexity to the choreography-but I didn't show the handling of errors on the error messages.  </s>
<s> These diagrams are more complex than the first set of diagrams I sent it, in that they show alternative paths created by business decisions and through pick or choice behavior.  </s>
