<s> 29 March 2001 UA Guidelines Teleconference Agenda announcement: Reference document 23 March 2001 Guidelines: Minutes of previous meeting 22 March: Next meeting: 5 April teleconference:  </s>
<s> Present: Jon Gunderson (Chair), Ian Jacobs (scribe), Gregory Rosmaita, Mickey Quenzer, David Poehlman, Harvey Bingham, Denis Anson Tim Lacy, Rich Schwerdtfeger Absent: Aaron Leventhal, Jim Allan Regrets: Charles McCathieNevile, Eric Hansen Announcements JG: New list for issues that will be considered in the next version of the guidelines Discussion 1.Issue #468: 11.3 (single-key binding): "At least a majority" minimal requirement needs review JG: One proposal: just require single key for default functionalities.  </s>
<s> JG: Or - anything that you can do with single key+modifier you have to do with a single key alone.  </s>
<s> IJ: I think that CMN's proposal was "a majority of the physical keyboard".  </s>
<s> JG: How do you know how many keys the physical device has?  </s>
<s> (APIs hide this information from you).  </s>
<s> GR: There's a javascript call where you can eliminate functionality that way (navbar = "") IJ: The problem is when the number of keys and the number of functionalities don't add up to 50% (one of the other).  </s>
<s> Resolved: - Minimal requirement of 11.4 is to have single key bindings for at least all of what's in 11.5.  </s>
<s> - Add a Note to encourage developers to supply a bunch of single key bindings AND that most functionalities should be available for single-key bindings.  </s>
<s> - Add technique: mention that entering a special mode (e.g, via one key) and having single key bindings after that is also useful.  </s>
<s> 2.Issue #467: Checkpoints 3.2/3.7:  </s>
<s> User needs to be able to toggle off as well as on (e.g., for a user with a cognitive disability).  </s>
<s> JG: Toggle-off functionality is a new requirement.  </s>
<s> You can achieve this (with more difficulty) by reloading.  </s>
<s> My preference is to add this requirement to the techniques document.  </s>
<s> DA: My only problem with that approach is if refresh changes point of regard.  </s>
<s> IJ: I think preserving POR is useful for refresh.  </s>
<s> JG: IE, Opera, NN all maintain POR when you refresh.  </s>
<s> DP: Loading time is also an issue.  </s>
<s> Another technique: when you toggle one one, you automatically toggle the other one off.  </s>
<s> GR, TL: I think that P3 requirement is fine for this document.  </s>
<s> TL: Developers will instinctively think of "off" when they think of "on".  </s>
<s> Resolved: - Add a P3 requirement for 3.2, 3.7 to toggle off what has been toggled on.  </s>
<s> - Add to techniques of 9.4 to maintain POR after refresh.  </s>
<s> 3.Issue #449: Create an executive summary for UAAG 1.0 IJ: This will be part of the spec.  </s>
<s> JG: Please send editorial comments if you have any.  </s>
<s> Resolved: - Include "summary" as appendix in UAAG 1.0.  </s>
<s> 4. New navigation features: GR: Work for me! 5. Input modality and G9 checkpoints Resolved: - "Any event handler" means any handler, whatever device you conform for.  </s>
<s> - Move to Guideline 1: 9.3.  </s>
<s> 6. Adopt 508 definition of AT? HB: Yes.  </s>
<s> Resolved: - Add 508 definition to end of our definition (as an example of a more general definition).  </s>
<s> DP: Should we include definitions from other companies?  </s>
<s> Action IJ: Talk to Judy about this one as well.  </s>
<s> Action HB: Talk to EO about getting "How do people with disabilities use the Web".  </s>
<s> 7. Two glossary comments Resolved: - Proposed definition of "documentation" is ok. - Ok to delete document source view as proposed.  </s>
<s> 8. Checkpoints interdependent Resolved: - Adopt proposal (with editorial changes).  </s>
<s> 9. Comments based on GL comments: a) Should we add "If all else fails, implement some API to 6.6"?  </s>
<s> JG: Not sure that it's relevant.  </s>
<s> But maybe on portable devices, for example.  </s>
<s> DA: E.g., I can install a keyboard API in my Palm pilot that's not there initially.  </s>
<s> Palm makes one API.  </s>
<s> The one I have is "GoType!" Proposed (for example): - 6.3 For markup languages other than HTML and XML, provide programmatic access to content.  </s>
<s> Per 6.5, use standard APIs of if not std API exists, provide access through some API.  </s>
<s> DP: If you provide programmatic access that's not useful to ATs, then it doesn't serve the purposes of the document.  </s>
<s> GR: The requirement would be: if you use a proprietary API, then it has to be publicly available.  </s>
<s> Resolved: - For 6.3, 6.4, 6.5: * Use standard APIs to achieve the requirement of the checkpoint.  </s>
<s> * If no standard API exists, the user agent must satisfy this checkpoint using a publicly documented API.  </s>
<s> Resolved: - Ian can fix labels "For content/UA" for 10.2 Resolved: - For checkpoint 3.2/3.7:  </s>
<s> "When placeholders are rendered, allow the user to view the original author-supplied content associated with each placeholder."  </s>
<s> Resolved: - Adopt change to 4.6 "at least the range of positions".  </s>
<s> Resolved: - Leave 9.2 a P2 since not impossible.  </s>
<s> - Add a note that UA should also allow reverse navigation.  </s>
<s> 5.Vote to go to last call The following participants approve going to last call: Jon Gunderson, Ian Jacobs, Gregory Rosmaita, Mickey Quenzer, David Poehlman, Harvey Bingham, Denis Anson, Tim Lacy, Rich Schwerdtfeger 4.Last call scheduling options IJ: We can either go 10 April or 17 April.  </s>

<s> Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org) http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs Cell: +1 917 450-8783  </s>
<s> I also approve going forward to Last Call.  </s>
<s> I want to clarify that the expected last call document will be: - The 23 March 2001 Draft - Plus resolutions incorporated from the 29 March teleconference - Plus possible editorial changes (e.g., based on incorporating today's resolutions).  </s>
<s> - Some additional techniques added to fill in the Techniques document.  </s>
<s> I intend to publish another WG draft in the next day or two that should be what we send to last call.  </s>
<s> Please indicate whether you have any objections to this plan.  </s>
<s> Thank you, _ Ian Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org) http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs Cell: +1 917 450-8783  </s>
<s> I have no problem with this plan.  </s>
