I suggest an abstract syntax along the lines of: An RDF Literal Node can be labelled with one of: - an RDF String Literal (as now) - an RDF XML Literal (as now) - a value from the value space of a datatype. 
so they are selfdenoting (as now) 
We simply note that an implementation that is unaware of a specific 
datatype 
used in an RDF/XML document will need to store the datatype URI + 
lexical 
form pair as a fall-back. 
OK

If you mean datatype value labeled nodes denote themselves, yes (*if* we have such labels). 
But not all of the above three node types are self denoting. 
It has not been decided yet what string literals denote.

No. We should note nothing of the sort. 
We should say nothing about what any application should or should not do about representing the abstract model internally in some system. 
We say what the abstract graph contains, and what it means, and how a given application deals with that is entirely and completely out of scope. 
That's the purpose of an interchange standard, to only say what is necessary for consistent, reliable interchange, and remain completely silent about everything else. 
No? And the abstract graph should reflect the RDF statements that have been made, using the names employed by the original expression of those statements. 
If the MT says two string-unequal names mean the same thing, fine, but the graph should still reflect the original names used.

What any literal denotes is a question for Pat not for me!
