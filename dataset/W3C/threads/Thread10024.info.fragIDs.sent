<s> No. We should note nothing of the sort.  </s>
<s> We should say nothing about what any application should or should not do about representing the abstract model internally in some system.  </s>

<s> If the MT says two string-unequal names mean the same thing, fine, but the graph should still reflect the original names used.  </s>
