The Techniques teleconference is scheduled for Wednesday, March 12 from 15:00 to 16:30 UTC (10:00am to 11:30am US Eastern/7:00am to 8:30am US Pacific). 
The conference information is: Passcode 92248 Agenda: 1. Baseline technology/conformance profiles 2. Pick up discussion of Chris's techniques and Wendy's questions, on list before if possible 3. Continue discussion of "major sections" I will be out of town this week and will most likely not be able to attend and moderate the call. 
I haven't yet arranged for someone else to take this role but for now expect that the call will still proceed. 
Someone will contact the list to indicate whether the call will proceed or not. 
I hope it will because next week many of us will be tied up at the CSUN conference and most likely we will cancel next week's call. 
Michael Michael Cooper Accessibility Project Manager Watchfire 1 Hines Rd Kanata, ON K2K 3C7 Canada Michael, Thanks for pulling together an agenda but I think several people (including myself) will not be available this week. 
I propose we cancel the 12 March techniques telecon. 
--wendy wendy a chisholm world wide web consortium web accessibility initiative Let's go ahead and cancel since Wendy and I are both unavailable. 
Sorry everyone, and for somewhat short notice. 
I'll send information about upcoming meetings soon.
