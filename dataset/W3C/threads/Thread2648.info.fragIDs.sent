<s> If request1 is a GET, HEAD, TRACE, or OPTIONS, then I would say that the server could legitimately assume that it had no side effects.  </s>
<s> One could be more conservative and assume that any CGI (or CGI-like) resource had side effects.  </s>
<s> Having assumed that there were no side effects it might be reasonable to overlap the processing, if you have the buffer space to spare.  </s>
<s> That's a reasonable notion.  </s>
<s> However, in practice it might be a bit complicated (i.e.; server side includes in GETs of html documents might  </s>

<s> It seems that the tradeoff is between speed and being-nice-to-less-then-careful-clients.  </s>
<s> For now, I'll stick with sequential resolution, and then consider how to detect circumstances where sequentiality can be loosened.  </s>

<s> From section 9.1.1:  </s>
<s> "Naturally, it is not possible to ensure that the server does not generate side-effects as a result of performing a GET request; in fact, some dynamic resources consider that a feature.  </s>
<s> The important distinction here is that the user did not request the side-effects, so therefore cannot be held accountable for them."  </s>
<s> However, from section 9.1.2:  </s>
<s> "Methods can also have the property of "idempotence" in that (aside from error or expiration issues) the side-effects of N  0 identical requests is the same as for a single request.  </s>
<s> The methods GET, HEAD, PUT and DELETE share this property."  </s>
<s> Which, as I read it, says you are free to have GET requests change server side state as long as the state changes are idempotent.  </s>
<s> (Although 9.1.1's  </s>
<s> language can easily be read as weakening that considerably)  </s>
<s> So, a compliant implementation may have idempotent side effects, but an unconditionally compliant implementation may not.  </s>
<s> Unfortunately, my experience with servlets and other application server technologies leads me to believe that the "idempotent" requirement for side effects is widely ignored (and not just for page counters) Not that that's an excuse, just a data point :-) Thanks for the clarification, -cks  </s>
<s> 1. I looked into several captured packets of a HTTP request, there are lots of "OD OA" as deviders for headers; sometimes a request ends with "OD 0A 0D 0A", sometimes ends with "0A 0A 0A" or ....  </s>
<s> In the RFC, the request can end with 0D or 0A or their combination, I wonder how does a HTTP server or HTTP client determines a full request is received?.  </s>
<s> Shouldn't we have a better way to determine it?  </s>
<s> 2. When a user is using a Web browser , the "Reload" in netscape or the"Refresh" in IE is pressed, what's the policy the browser to use about when to start with a new connection( SYN issued first).  </s>
<s> or to start with just a HTTP request( ACK push)?  </s>
<s> Many thanks!  </s>
<s> Fred Bohle@NEON 01/24/2000 09:18 AM Tim, I look for either 0A or 0D.  </s>
<s> If I find 0D, I look for 0A behind it.  </s>
<s> If any of these conditions are true, it is end of line.  </s>
<s> If I find a line with no characters, this is the null line that ends the headers.  </s>
<s> That way you can end any line, any way you want, without looking for strings like 0D0A0D0A, or 0A0A.  </s>
<s> I can detect screwy end of line pairs like 0A0D0A or 0D0A0A.  </s>
<s> Fred  </s>
<s> There are no TCP/IP level or connection level policies implied as far as I know.  </s>
<s> The implied policy is to get the page again, and get a copy fresh from the origin server, without any intermediate cached copy being used instead.  </s>
<s> This implies that a new HTTP request has to be sent, but not necessarily that an existing persistent connection has to be broken.  </s>
<s> Hope this helps, Koen.  </s>
