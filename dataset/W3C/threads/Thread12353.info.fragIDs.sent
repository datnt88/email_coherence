<s> Don't know how long this meeting is going to take but with a joint meeting "long" seems more likely than "short".  </s>
<s> So just in case: I have another (phone) meeting coming up at 3:30 Boston time (1 hour after this one) so if we haven't finished by then, I'll have leave early.  </s>
<s> Tried to move it but that was just not possible.  </s>

<s> Hi all, Sorry about the delay, but this is the Techniques draft that I said I would do at the face-to-face.  </s>
<s> It is not done but you will get the idea.  </s>
<s> Language specific things have generally been removed (to be put in the separate docs).  </s>
<s> Cheers, Jan  </s>
<s> Hi all, Sorry I forgot to attach the file.  </s>
<s> Cheers, Jan  </s>
<s> Jan, thanks for this - it's a good piece of work.  </s>
<s> How about we have the following categories: + Things you need to do to meet the checkpoint (these can be fairly general) + Techniques to do this (which should say how much of it they do) + Things which are good to do although they go beyond the requirements of the checkpoint.  </s>
<s> + References These probably need to be sorted (where applicable) by tool type and priority.  </s>
<s> For example to meet checkpoint 1.1 in a level-A tool, all that needs to be done is to provide source editing (and meet checkpoint 1.2 Preserve all accessibiltiy information, which can be done by not messing up the source).  </s>
<s> But for a WYSIWYG tool this will not conform to 5.1 and 5.2, so the tool cannot get to double-A.  </s>
<s> A source editing tool can use this technique to any level.  </s>

<s> I agree.  </s>
<s> I'd really like to work on emphasizing cross-over situations in which doing one thing contributes to meeting several guidelines.  </s>
<s> In the end this could be pulled out into a separate list of techniques that need to be implemented as opposed to checkpoints that need to be met.  </s>
