<s> Hello folks, I've been playing around the last few days with EARL schema possibilities.  </s>
<s> I've gotten rid of blank nodes, which seemed like a good idea.  </s>
<s> Is it an improvement?  </s>
<s> Sean and Danbri, Libby said this was "implicit reification."  </s>
<s> What are the implications on queries?  </s>
<s> I haven't played or thought much about that yet.  </s>
<s> I've worked 2 examples.  </s>
<s> One is a single simple statement, the second combines 2 to make sure that we don't lose important info.  </s>
<s> Example 1: Simple statement success3.svg is the graph produced by the RDF Validator.  </s>
<s> rdf:RDF xmlns:sp="http://valet.webthing.com/xmlns/sp"  </s>
<s> xmlns:valet="http://valet.webthing.com/xmlns/valet"  </s>
<s> xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#" Example 2: simple merge Here is a simple merge of a couple of assertions to make sure we don't lose info.  </s>
<s> success4.svg is the graph produced by the RDF Validator.  </s>
<s> rdf:RDF xmlns:sp="http://valet.webthing.com/xmlns/sp"  </s>

<s> hi Wendy I'll look at this in more detail soon, but I was trying to say that this is like 'fake reification' where the semantics are not explicit to the RDF processor.  </s>
<s> I'm not sure whether to recommend an approach like this, although I can see the attraction.  </s>
<s> This should be distinguished from the approach which danbri suggested where you reify by pointing to another document.  </s>
<s> Libby  </s>
<s> This doesn't seem to be "fake" or "implicit" refification going by Libby's description of it in her "RDF Annotations" paper [1].  </s>
<s> In that model, things are grouped under bNodes and given properties.  </s>
<s> With this model, things are just asserted in the model with no grouping or way of preserving the context information.  </s>
<s> The implication is that you either can't have two different evaluations in one document, or you can't query it at all.  </s>
<s> I'm not sure how this would fit into the reification by hypertext idea [some notes on that a bit further down].  </s>
<s> Consider the following problem (which I've already outlined twice at  </s>
<s> [2] and [3], but here it is again).  </s>
<s> You may have one document which contains:- :Sean earl:asserts http://example.org/ .  </s>
<s> http://example.org/ earl:passes :WCAGA .  </s>
<s> and then in another document you have:- :Wendy earl:asserts http://example.org/ .  </s>
<s> http://example.org/ earl:fails :WCAGA .  </s>
<s> notwithstanding the fact that asserting a bit of WebContent doesn't make much sense (and could be misconstrued as asserting the semantics of the WebContent, which is certainly *not* what we want!), when you merge the RDF documents you get a contradiction:- :Sean earl:asserts http://example.org/ .  </s>
<s> :Wendy earl:asserts http://example.org/ .  </s>
<s> http://example.org/ a earl:WebContent; earl:passes :WCAGA; earl:fails :WCAGA .  </s>
<s> It's impossible to query it usefully.  </s>
<s> Who said that it passes, and who said that it fails?  </s>
<s> And then there's reification by hypertext, treating the two documents as things that we don't necessarily believe.  </s>
<s> The problem with that is that XML RDF has no way to quote a set of statements other than using log:quote as a parse type.  </s>
<s> It also has no way to identify the root context of the document, unless you make a link from the document to it's semantics using log:semantics or something.  </s>
<s> Of course, the other big problem with that is that you can't have lots of different evaluations (i.e. with different assertors) in one document.  </s>
<s> We discussed that months ago, and the people on the call (Jim and Nick, IIRC) didn't think it was a good idea.  </s>

<s> :Sean :homepage http://purl.org/net/sbp/ .  </s>
<s> In fact, I didn't need to create a new example, since the "example2" that you sent already contains a contradiction:- http://mypage.org :Result :passes .  </s>
<s> http://mypage.org :Result :fails .  </s>
<s> I think that the problem may be the fact that both the XML tree and the SVG vizualization are misleading because they seem to relate these triples to the assertor, whereas in fact they are not related at all.  </s>
<s> RDF is a graph not a tree - the tree structure in the SVG just kinda helps you to vizualize where the relationships are.  </s>
<s> N.B.  </s>
<s> It's kinda standard practice to use lower case intercap for properties, and upper case for classes and everything else - people are used to using them that way, and it'll make the examples easier to read.  </s>
<s> cf.  </s>
<s> To distinguish between classes and properties with similar names, there is a convention to capitalize the first letter of a class (Car, Human, etc.) and keep the first letter of a property lowercase (hasOwner, homepage, etc.).  </s>
<s> Other than the capitalization rules above, it is recommend that the rest of a URI is kept lowercase.  </s>

<s> Oops... I didn't mean to imply that anyone had misled anyone else or anything like that :-) You said that you hadn't had a chance to go through it in your previous message, so I thought I'd go through it and give my own interpretation and spew the results to the list...  </s>
<s> In fact, my own interpretation could be wrong, so I'd certainly like to hear your own thoughts on the model if/when you get around to it tomorrow.  </s>
<s> Apologies once again if the previous letter sounded harsh; it certainly wasn't intended that way!  </s>
