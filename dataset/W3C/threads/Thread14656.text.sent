Inspired by Kynn's excellent efforts to produce an XHTML/CSS version of the WAI logo, I had a go myself:- (not online yet). 
It uses tables for layout for a start, which is an abomination, but it's less of an abomination than using text in images ;-) Also, it makes sense when linearized, and it has the relavent summary and titles. 
XHTML:- table cellspacing="0" summary="WAI: WCAG 1.0 Level AA Conformance Assertion" a href="http://www.w3.org/" title="The World Wide Web Consortium" span class="blue" W3 /span span class="grey" C /span /a a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/" title="Web Accessibility Initiative" class="black" WAI /a - a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG1AA-Conformance" title="Explanation of Level AA WCAG 1.0 Conformance" class="red" AA /a a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/" title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines Version 1.0" class="darkgrey" WCAG 1.0 /a CSS:- table { border:2px solid #a0a0a0;margin:0em; padding:0em;font-family:arial;font-weight:bold; } tr { padding:0em;margin:0em; } table a { text-decoration: none; } td { margin: 0em; } td.left { background-color:#ffffff; padding:0.1em;font-size:0.95em; 
} td.right { background-color:#ffdb8b;text-align:right;padding: 0.2em 0.2em 0.2em 0.7em;font-size: 0.7em; } .blue 
{ color: #00509f; } .grey 
{ color: #b0b0b8; } .black 
{ color: #000000; } .red 
{ color: #c00010; } .darkgrey 
{ color: #606080; } It's quite neat, but you may want to add further classes in case you have more tables on your page that you don't want to be affected.

I did something similar in CSS. 
But then someone from the W3C complained : ") I'm afraid that this does not constitute a valid conformance claim according to WCAG 1.0, which states: "Claims of conformance to this document must use one of the following two forms.." From 1: Specify a bunch of stuff. 
Form 2: Include, on each page claiming conformance, one of three icons provided by W3C and link the icon to the appropriate W3C ' explanation of the claim. 
Information about the icons and how to insert them in pages is available at [WCAG-ICONS]. 
I think that the CSS approach might be used in conjunction with form 1, but form 2 requires images made available by W3"C. 
IN other words You have to use there icons. 
Text in images and all. 
Well hear is a nice catch 22 situation. 
If we come up with a good logo that is using mark up, we violate the criteria for conformance claim. 
However if we use the W3C logo, we violate WCAG itself. 
Now what? 
L Nope, because *our* logos conform to both Form1 and the WCAG guidelines:- Form 1: Specify: The guidelines title: "Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0" The guidelines URI: http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WAI-WEBCONTENT-19990505 
The conformance level satisfied: "A", "Double-A", or "Triple-A". 
The scope covered by the claim (e.g., page, site, or defined portion of a site.). 
]]] - http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/ 
So I reckon as our logos are more WCAG compliant than the WCAG logos themselves, we may as well use them (and legally so). 
Also, I suppose we could ask the editors of the [WCAG-ICONS] document to add our "good markup logo(s)" is they think it is appropriate. 
(Wendy/Gregg/Ian???) That is, if there are no qualms about the accessibility of our efforts over that of the text-in-images ones?

If we come up with a good logo that is using mark up, Maybe it would be better to make the assertion in RDF and then link to it using:- link rel="meta" type="application/rdf" href="wcag.rdf" 
title="W3C WAI WCAG Conformance Claim" / I'm pretty sure that would be more compehensive than having a little logo on the bottom of the page: it could link to an EDL statement. 
You can make up your own RDF statement, such is the beauty of RDF. c.f. http://uwimp.com/

It's certainly more comprehensive, but it's far less usable and visible for what we want it to do. 
The main point of the compliance logo, from our standpoint, is that it is a PR tool which raises awareness of accessibility issues. 
The secondary function is that it may help people with disabilities recognize if a site is usable by them (although the effectiveness of this function is questionable). 
In a tertiary sense, it's there as an ego-booster/reward/public recognition for web designers who make their sites accessible. 
An RDF statement only matches the second function, and it only matches it in _theory_, not practice, as few people with disabilities have hardware or software which processes RDF effectively.
