<s> Hi all, Wendy Chisholm and Judy Brewer asked me to comment on this months ago, and I posted it to the site they asked me to post it at.  </s>
<s> Recently, someone more savvy in the functioning of the WAI lists informed me that the list is totally ignored.  </s>
<s> So here, I repost it, in the hopes that it might be helpful to someone, somewhere, some day.... Aries Arditi Senior Fellow in Vision Science Lighthouse International Original Post: With respect to the June 24 WCAG 2.0 draft, I have a number of comments, detailed below.  </s>
<s> First, however, I would like to congratulate the authors for taking on such a difficult task.  </s>
<s> In particular, I'm delighted that the group is intending to broaden the scope of the guidelines to address a broader set of technologies.  </s>
<s> To the extent that this broadening succeeds, its influence can go well beyond that of web content and authoring, and potentially guide the efforts of developers of assistive technology as well.  </s>
<s> Having said that, I believe also that the guidelines are in general less comprehensible (indeed, less accessible!) to the intended readership than were the version 1.0 guidelines, and that the lack of comprehensibility stems from the very abstraction of principles that was necessary for broadening to other technologies.  </s>
<s> I believe these problems can be addressed and alleviated through the planned technology-specific checklists, especially if the checkpoints in the WCAG are cross referenced to technology specific guidelines.  </s>
<s> Apart from a few exceptions, I don't believe, however, that making the guidelines significantly easier to understand can be accomplished by simple rewriting.  </s>
<s> Like a mathematics text in which axioms and theorems provide the foundation, and examples and problems the practical understanding, this may be a necessarily abstract document.  </s>
<s> The conformance structure of Core and Extended is fine, both easy to understand and potentially effective, provided more objective and quantitative methods of evaluating specific conformance to checkpoints can be developed.  </s>
<s> But conformance to specific checkpoints is best evaluated in the context of specific technologies, where specific items are less open to braod interpretation.  </s>
<s> Without technology specific checkpoints, I would imagine that squabbling and bickering over conformance will increase, and with more latitude to interpret the guidelines as they see fit, developers could claim more for less actual conformance.  </s>
<s> So I would favor keeping the general structure of the draft as a kind of umbrella document, but instantiate the conformance checkpoints with technology-specific checkpoints.  </s>
<s> Since the planned technology-specific checklists were not included in this draft, it's difficult to evaluate the conformance structure.  </s>
<s> However, in theory, the structure seems fine to me.  </s>
<s> Developers at my organization do use the 1.0 WCAG, but much of their use is indirect---via automated tools to evaluate conformance.  </s>
<s> Because web sites can be huge and dynamic, reliance on such tools is at least partially inevitable.  </s>
<s> However, to the extent that the current document is even less specific than v1.0, I would see migration being difficult.  </s>
<s> Without technology-specific checklists, it is easy to imagine developers of evaluation and repair tools with widely disparate views of what constitutes conformance.  </s>
<s> Again, I would prefer to view this draft as an umbrella document with more specifics to be incorporated as an essential component of the 2.0 WCAG recommendation.  </s>
<s> Here are some other specific comments, nearly all pertaining to Guidelines 1 and 2: 1.  </s>
<s> I didn't understand the designation of examples and benefits as "non-normative" or "informative."  </s>
<s> Are these terms lingo, or am I just being thick (or both)?  </s>
<s> 2. Overview of Design Principles, last para before Note: This would better read, "Accessible web content can benefit people with as well as without disabilities."  </s>
<s> Accessible web content does not ALWAYS benefit people other than the disabled.  </s>
<s> High levels of magnification, for example, which can make things more accessible to people with low vision, can make documents more difficult to navigate.  </s>
<s> Delete next 2 sentences, which are superfluous since examples of accessible web content benefiting others is subsequently given (and giving wheelchair examples to the reader is tiresome---readers of the WCAG can, nearly 14 years after the ADA, be assumed to understand general things about disabilities without being prompted to conjure up images of wheelchairs).  </s>
<s> 3. User needs, first bullet: Change "via sound" to "visually." 4. Definitions for checkpoint 1.1: text equivalent This is not a definition.  </s>
<s> I would first define "text" as code representing written language, that is a one-to-one mapping of alphabetic and numeric symbols.  </s>
<s> Then define "text-equivalent" as text that serves to communicate substantially equivalent content as another representation such as an image.  </s>
<s> 5. Benefits of checkpoint 1.1, first bullet: add ", or otherwise transformed to different presentation format (e.g. font, text size) 6. Checkpoint 1.5 I believe that the benefit of adding structure to the document is that it allows assistive technologies more information about the document in order to tailor its presentation to the user's capabilities.  </s>
<s> This checkpoint, as written, however, seems to focus on how document elements are rendered.  </s>
<s> For example, the (sole) required success criterion refers to visual appearance or auditory characteristic.  </s>
<s> The examples also are about how to render.  </s>
<s> That's not a WCAG issue, in my view.  </s>
<s> Also, who (or what) could judge whether structure "has been made perceivable to more people..."?  </s>
<s> Compared to what?  </s>
<s> This is way too vague.  </s>
<s> 7. Editorial Note (22 May 2003) regarding "additional items in 4/29 draft Yes, in my opinion, these should be moved to techniques.  </s>
<s> 8. Checkpoint 1.6 This is very vaguely worded.  </s>
<s> I would propose instead the following language: "Where possible, use layered designs to allow selective presentation or blanking of visual or auditory elements, comprising, for example, foreground and background content."  </s>
<s> The sole success criterion for 1.6 is in terms only of visually imagery.  </s>
<s> I would refer to layered auditory images, such as background music with a voice-over, to allow hearing-impaired user to remove the background music for greater clarity.  </s>
<s> Under best practice for 1.6 #1 and #2, what does "easily readable" mean?  </s>
<s> And to whom?  </s>
<s> This is not quantifiable.  </s>
<s> Also, who came up with the 20 dB (or 4 X louder) foreground/background audio figure?  </s>
<s> Are there any data to back this up as being sufficient?  </s>
<s> It's true that there are no effective tests for visibility or readability that do not rely on standard human observers in terms of color or color contrast (the claims of some notwitstanding).  </s>
<s> The reasons for this include the fact that display devices and hardware used to drive them vary widely in peak luminance, color gamut, and linearity; viewing conditions of observers vary widely (ambient room lighting, presence of reflections from nearby windows, etc.); readability and visual discriminability also depend critically on the kinds of stimuli used.  </s>
<s> A very low contrast text in a huge font may be as or more readable than a smaller font in very high contrast.  </s>
<s> Typography and image characteristics also go into the mix of important factors.  </s>
<s> And let us not leave out the enormous variability in visual capacity of the visually-impaired population, some of whom will settle for no less than the blackest black against the whitest white.  </s>
<s> The long and short of it is that we simply do not have in the foreseeable future a good way to evaluate objectively things like accessibility of text contrast and/or color.  </s>
<s> This is thus an issue in which, I believe, the best we can do (and thus the most we should do) is to suggest principles to follow to enhance accessibility.  </s>
<s> 9. Examples of checkpoint 1.6 first bullet: What are the "standard foreground/background contrast requirements"?  </s>
<s> If there are any, please clarify (and cite).  </s>
<s> 10.  </s>
<s> Required success criteria for checkpoint 2.2 #1: I would add the following bullet: "* or the user can control the presentation by eliciting phases sequentially via keystrokes."  </s>
<s> 11.  </s>
<s> Checkpoint 2.3 I would be very surprised if anyone could devise a substantive and effective test for flicker in machine readable format.  </s>
<s> Here are some thought experiments: Consider a single pixel flickering in the 3-49Hz range on your screen right now.  </s>
<s> Do you think you could detect it?  </s>
<s> If so, do you think it could possibly cause a seizure in someone with photosensitive epilepsy?  </s>
<s> You do?  </s>
<s> How about if that single pixel flickered by changing its intensity 1/256?  </s>
<s> or 1/(256^3)?  </s>
<s> Still think so?  </s>
<s> How many phases (i.e. alternations) of light and dark constitute flicker in the 3-49 Hz range?  </s>
<s> What if I present a black dot for 1.5 seconds, then replace it by a white dot for 1.5 seconds?  </s>
<s> Would you call that 3 Hz flicker?  </s>
<s> In other words, how many "cycles" of the pattern do you require before you call it flicker?  </s>
<s> Here's a third: Mathematically the sum of leftward moving and rightword sinusoidal gratings is equal to a single stationary sinusoidal grating whose bars reverse in contrast.  </s>
<s> Any single point in that pattern will flicker.  </s>
<s> Do we call that flicker or moving gratings?  </s>
<s> Were we to analyze many moving patterns we would find that we could describe them mathematically in terms of flickering components.  </s>
<s> What if we have a video taken from a moving car or train that passes by a picket fence.  </s>
<s> Will not there be some flicker in that video?  </s>
<s> Shall we ban all animations in the WCAG?  </s>
<s> It is likely that scientists will some day be able to better zero in on the specific visual causes of photosensitive epileptic seizures; presumably high contrast large field flicker poses a greater risk than do low contrast flickering single pixels.  </s>
<s> Until we know more, or until qualified experts on this condition weigh in, or credible scientific evidence is presented that better specifies the parameters of the flicker, I believe this checkpoint should be deleted.  </s>

<s> Thanks For Your Re-Post, Aries - As I am one of a number of us working on a "re-look" at guideline 1.6 within the draft of WCAG 2.0, I would like to follow-up with some of what you had to say.  </s>
<s> First, for me alone, thank you for the input - I am sure others appreciated your comments.  </s>
<s> Given my own personal experiences with color deficiency issues, I agree that an algorithm is probably not going to solve the issue of helping authors develop 100% readable content.  </s>
<s> With regard to the "vastness" of issues concerning color/contrast: brightness, hue saturation, environmental conditions, monitor types and their differences, individual user differences/preferences, etc, etc, etc - it is unlikely that a formula can easily solve the issues.  </s>
<s> Are you suggesting that 1.6 and 1.7 be combined as a single guideline?  </s>
<s> I could be wrong and by no means speak for the larger group, but I believe the 20 dB (4xlouder) came from an earlier post with regard to what the audio company Shure (Shure microphone fame) recommends as the background/foreground noise ratio.  </s>
<s> The American Speech and Hearing Association also has standard signal to noise ratios that apply to classroom environment - please see: _acoustics_update.htm  </s>
<s> These ratios are for listeners with normal hearing.  </s>
<s> Individuals with hearing loss would need to have determined their individual "hearing loss threshold" and have the speech increased to the +15 to 20 dB levels to discriminate speech over background noise.  </s>
<s> This seems close to the 20 dB that WCAG came up with and possibly this would be a good source to reference but it does NOT speak specifically to sound from a computer.  </s>
<s> However, it seems (to me personally) a good place to start and something to be able to refer back to.  </s>
