<s> Hello, I thought that you may be interested in the following case study which is a brief summary of the latest accessibility project we have just undertaken on behalf of Birmingham Focus on Blindness, a Midlands based charity.  </s>
<s> The site address is at http://www.birminghamfocus.org.uk .  </s>
<s> Birmingham Focus on Blindness Case Study  </s>
<s> The purpose of this site was to highlight the work of this Birmingham  </s>
<s> based charity in an accessible way to enable people with sight  </s>
<s> impairment to find out information about the services offered on their behalf.  </s>
<s> The site was intended to conform with Bobby and W3C Level AA  </s>
<s> accessibility and have a method of allowing the Birmingham Focus staff to update the site themselves.  </s>
<s> The site was developed initially using standard Adobe and Macromedia development tools to create the basic site structure with a MySQL database running behind the scenes to serve the dynamic page content.  </s>
<s> Throughout the development we stuck rigidly to the W3C accessibility guidelines, with our aim to exceed the brief in all areas and in so doing push the envelope of online accessible design.  </s>
<s> To ensure that the site met with the highest possible W3C Level AAA standards throughout, we handcoded amendments to most of the HTML double checking this with online code verification engines.  </s>
<s> We then exhaustively tested the site to ensure maximum compliance with access technology such as screen readers and braille monitors, before the third stage of our accessibility testing which was carried out by Birmingham Focus volunteers and also the disabled client group of the Self Direction Community Project whom we regularly work with for peer appraisal, which is the key to true accessibility.  </s>
<s> It is only by obtaining feedback from the people for whom a site has been developed that true accessibility can be achieved.  </s>
<s> Innovation The site has many innovative features, most of which are not new but have certainly not been done in such an effective manner before and rarely within the same site.  </s>
<s> The display can be fully customisable easily enabling a choice of text and background colours, and a choice of various font sizes and types.  </s>
<s> A log in area exists that will memorise the settings of the user and display all pages in that way, and also feed content to the user that is most appropriate to them - this is a highly dynamic form of implicit personalisation.  </s>
<s> News relevant to the site user can be highlighted, site searches will display more relevant results based on the user profile before any other results are listed, and all content is set with attributes to ensure that the site is a truly personalised experienced.  </s>
<s> The content management system behind the scenes is second to none and is possibly the only website content management product developed today to be fully accessible to Level AAA standards.  </s>
<s> In layman's terms, this means that not only can the website be browsed by someone who is completely blind, but that a blind person can have full control over the entire site and is capable of not just adding and removing content, but can also upload files, images, amend navigation links, remove and add pages and site sections, change links, and update the entire site to their liking.  </s>
<s> This is what web accessibility is all about - making the Internet accessible to everyone regardless of their ability or disability levels.  </s>
<s> The Way Ahead... We seized the chance to work on this project as another opportunity of demonstrating our skills and abilities in the field of online accessibility.  </s>
<s> Rather than just talk about it, we actually put our words into practice as, by raising the bar, we have shown that the combination of design, advanced functionality and true accessibility is not only possible, but should be the way ahead for the Internet.  </s>
<s> If more people took accessibility as seriously as we do, the Internet would be a much better place for everyone.  </s>
<s> E-quality is not just an offline word.  </s>

<s> Hi all, My name is Farez Rahman and I manage projects for a web accessibility consultancy in central London, UK, called Checkpoint (www.checkpoint-access.co.uk).  </s>
<s> I would like to invite members of this list to join our User Panel, which is a diverse group of people with a range of disabilities and who use assitive technology for web browsing, eg. screen readers.  </s>
<s> From time to time we consult our User Panel when auditing our clients' websites for accessibility.  </s>
<s> Of course, panel members that we consult are remunerated for their time and effort.  </s>
<s> If you're interested in this, all you need to do is reply indicating this and I will keep a record of your name and email address.  </s>
<s> We will get in touch with you along with the web page(s) we'd like you to look at and a questionnaire to fill in, as an when new projects arise.  </s>
<s> We then arrange exchange of your reply with our payment to you for that work.  </s>
<s> There are no obligations.  </s>
<s> Hope to hear from you soon.  </s>

<s> In looking at the source code of the site itself (http://www.birminghamfocus.org.uk),  </s>
<s> I see that all the tables have summaries (for example, "This table is a spacer" and "This table contains the main site navigation bar").  </s>
<s> Is this necessary?  </s>
<s> I was under the impression that only data tables needed summaries.  </s>
<s> Does providing a summary for tables used for layout serve a purpose?  </s>
<s> Thanks! leslie  </s>
<s> The only meaningfull summaries are for data tables.  </s>
<s> Some tools require them though.  </s>
<s> The WCAG, to my knowledge, does not explicitly say either way.  </s>
<s> It does, to me, seem from both the WCAG and the HTML specification that the summary attribute should describe the table's purpose AND structure - and a table used for layout has preciously little of the latter.  </s>
<s> Now that you mention it, however ... I seem to believe that you cannot achieve WCAG 'AAA' whilst using tables for layout - actually, since you can't get past checkpoint 3.3 when you do, achieving 'AA'  </s>
<s> shouldn't be possible either.  </s>
<s> After all, it explicitly states: "Layout, positioning, layering, and alignment should be done through style sheets (notably by using CSS floats and absolute positioning)" Perhaps someone from the WAI-WG could clear up this ?  </s>

<s> No, I don't believe it is, and I feel it is a classic example of Bobby somewhat harming accessibility instead of helping it.  </s>
<s> If tables are (mis)used for layout, informing the user of them just makes things worse.  </s>
<s> It's pointless, ridiculous and irritating.  </s>
<s> What possible value could a user get from knowing a table is to make a visual space?  </s>
<s> It'd be much better if it was simply ignored (and of course, it'd be infinitely better if CSS was used instead).  </s>
<s> The navigation summary may be of some usefulness, but not that much, and I would have said much shorter text would be better if it was absolutely required.  </s>
<s> The user doesn't need an exact description of all content before they get to it.  </s>
<s> Some of the alt text on that site is also ridiculously long, a great (or should that be awful?) example being:  </s>
<s> "Logo indicating that this website achieves AAA accessibility compliance - this graphic is an External Link to the W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines that opens in a new browser window."  </s>
<s> Urgh! Tom Gilder  </s>
<s> i think the guidelines are clear but bobby let's them get away with it anyway, and that's sadly all some people look out for - that AAA Bobby approved icon (see bottom of the birminghamfocus.org.uk page)  </s>
<s> iris omnia mea mecum porto  </s>
<s> The problem, in my eyes, is that they also have a 'WCAG AAA' approved logo on it.  </s>
<s> I can find several interesting things in that source to disprove such a claim.  </s>
<s> This has been a disappointing day for accessibility.  </s>

<s> It can't be true as it is self contradictory.  </s>
<s> An AAA, or even AA rated page cannot trigger a popup Window until the normal situation is that browsers can disable popping up the Window, so whilst disabling is not generally supported (in terms of installed base), it is not allowed to popup and claim AAA, and when disabling is supported, it cannot assume that any attempt to trigger a popup will actually work, so the second part of the statement would be untrue.  </s>
