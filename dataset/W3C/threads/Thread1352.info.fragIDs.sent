<s> Hi Mark!  </s>
<s> I was aware you were planning on sending in a review by the first week of January, so I made sure that the last call period (from 1/1/01 to 1/15/01) did not interfere with that, but I'm also happy to delay posting the draft until 1/5/01, so that we can get anything you find fixed up before sending it out for last call (such as those section 0 references, thanks to Word's idea of how to silently update cross references!).  </s>
<s> So the two week last call period will now begin on 1/5/01.  </s>

<s> Thanks Geoff.  </s>
<s> Hopefully we can get the changes in so last call only needs to go once.  </s>
<s> I appreciate your allowing the space for feedback.  </s>
<s> I will be submitting some changes on Tuesday after I have a chance to meet with my colleague that returns after break.  </s>
<s> Happy new year, Mark  </s>
