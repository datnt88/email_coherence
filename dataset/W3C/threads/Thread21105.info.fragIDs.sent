<s> I don't know if this is same or different problem - I just installed amaya using Fink on a new Mac OS X (Jaguar) with X11 installed.  </s>
<s> When I try to start amaya it starts okay, gets the initial screen for a moment, and then crashes.  </s>
<s> The error reads:  </s>
<s> Gdk-WARNING **: locale not supported by C library  </s>
<s> gdk-imlib ERROR: Cannot load image: /usr/share/Amaya/amaya/annot.gif All fallbacks failed.  </s>
<s> *** Amaya: irrecoverable error ***  </s>
<s> Since this is also a gdk related error, thought I'd mention it in this thread.  </s>
<s> Apologies if this was discussed before (and I'd love a pointer to a solution) - I tried searching the archives w/o any obvious success thanks Jim H.  </s>

<s> Yep, this has happened to a bunch of people.  </s>
<s> I fixed it by installing Amaya 7.2 from fink unstable.  </s>
<s> I believe Damian has packaged 8.0 as well - but don't see it in fink anywhere cheers Chaals  </s>

<s> Should not be dangerous, tough it show a strange GTK installation...  </s>
<s> When you start Amaya from the command line with a webpage as parameter : #amaya http://www.w3.org or #amaya test.html  </s>
<s> (it will try to create an empty html file) Do you get the same results ?  </s>
<s> The probleme seems to be related to gdk-imlib, which is a subpart of gdk.  </s>
<s> This library is supposed to handle pictures format.  </s>
<s> Make sure it is well installed on your computer.  </s>

<s> Many thanks Chaals - that worked great.  </s>
<s> Amaya 7.2 has a different dependency structure - appears to add gtk+ and some imlib stuff - which seems to have fixed things - Amaya now loads okay, thanks much.  </s>
