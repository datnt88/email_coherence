I don't know if this is same or different problem - I just installed amaya using Fink on a new Mac OS X (Jaguar) with X11 installed. 
When I try to start amaya it starts okay, gets the initial screen for a moment, and then crashes. 
The error reads: 
Gdk-WARNING **: locale not supported by C library 
gdk-imlib ERROR: Cannot load image: /usr/share/Amaya/amaya/annot.gif All fallbacks failed. 
*** Amaya: irrecoverable error *** 
Since this is also a gdk related error, thought I'd mention it in this thread. 
Apologies if this was discussed before (and I'd love a pointer to a solution) - I tried searching the archives w/o any obvious success thanks Jim H.

Yep, this has happened to a bunch of people. 
I fixed it by installing Amaya 7.2 from fink unstable. 
I believe Damian has packaged 8.0 as well - but don't see it in fink anywhere cheers Chaals

Should not be dangerous, tough it show a strange GTK installation... 
When you start Amaya from the command line with a webpage as parameter : #amaya http://www.w3.org or #amaya test.html 
(it will try to create an empty html file) Do you get the same results ? 
The probleme seems to be related to gdk-imlib, which is a subpart of gdk. 
This library is supposed to handle pictures format. 
Make sure it is well installed on your computer.

Many thanks Chaals - that worked great. 
Amaya 7.2 has a different dependency structure - appears to add gtk+ and some imlib stuff - which seems to have fixed things - Amaya now loads okay, thanks much.
