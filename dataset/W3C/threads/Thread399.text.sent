I downloaded the latest version of tidy because I had a problem with the earlier versions I had on my machine. 
When I run tidy, it replaces &amp; with &amp;mp;. 
If I run it again, I get &amp;mp;mp;. 
I greatly appreciate having this program. 
Thank you for your work. 
I hope you can fix the bug. 
I think you mean that it replaces '&amp;' with '&amp;amp;'. 
It's not a bug, it's required for well-formed markup. 
'&amp;amp;' is the entity used to represent the ampersand in markup, both in content and in URLs. 
This has been discussed here and other lists numerous times. 
for a quote. 
/p /Jelks with Check the date of Tidy, you may have a slightly older version. 
I had a version from last year that also dropped the a in '&amp;amp;' but the version I downloaded in the past week works fine. 
hope entity
