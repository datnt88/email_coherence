<s> I prefer: "HTML and CSS Accessible Design Guidelines" "HTML and CSS Guidelines for Accessible Design" "HTML and CSS Universal Design Guidelines" "HTML and CSS Accessible Authoring Guidelines" (weak) You get my drift.  </s>
<s> The question has come up occasionally as to whether the PA guidelines should be called Page Author Guidelines or whether they should have a broader title - Web Author Guidelines Site Author Guidelines Something Else The idea is that newer technologies and serving technologies are making "page" an increasingly ambiguous concept.. and we need to apply the guidelines beyond just page technologies.  </s>
<s> Since we are close to sealing the guidelines up this would be the last and best time to change the name if we were going to.  </s>
<s> But we need to decide soon.  </s>
<s> Some thoughts to get you thinking - the guidelines seem to focus in at the page level.  </s>
<s> Although it could be argued that "all images should have alternative text" should be applied site-wide but that each instance is handled on its own page.  </s>
<s> We might need to reword some things... - It sheds new light on "transform gracefully."  </s>
<s> The definition would change to be more site-based, "To transform gracefully means that a site remains usable despite user, technological, or situational constraints...Creating sites that transform gracefully is not more costly, but requires a different design approach that also makes individual pages compatible with emerging mobile technologies...." - I think we can assume that the major design activities are not individual pages, but site-based.  </s>
<s> Therefore, taking that approach in the guidelines would be in-synch with the audience.  </s>
<s> However, would it deter people who are creating single-page sites (personal home pages)?  </s>
<s> How about people who just have a part of a site...or a page on a site.  </s>
<s> Or, is that their "site." - It seems that we can abstract out to the site level in the introductions for each section (A, B, C), each guideline is page level, while techniques are site-level.  </s>
<s> Yes?  </s>
<s> Your thoughts?  </s>

<s> Okay, that's good points.  </s>
<s> How about going shorter (verses my other efforts) and calling them: "Web Accessibility Guidelines" I'm not sure what benefit the word "Content" brings.  </s>

<s> Although it's mostly about HTML&amp;CSS today, we will update it to include more SMIL, XML, XSL, MathML, SVG, etc. in the future, so the question is do we want to have to change a name that we are going to promote as some kind of brand name in the upcoming year.  </s>
<s> I agree Page is a vague term and I'll also add Author is ambiguous, as it refers to different roles: the designer, the user of a wysiwyg tool, the html-by-hand author, and maybe other.  </s>
<s> These guidelines are really about what *is* in the Web pages, so I propose: Web Content Accessible Guidelines.  </s>
<s> I prefer titles that omit "HTML" and "CSS".  </s>
<s> I think that: - "web site" is friendlier - "web site" is less technical sounding.  </s>
<s> We don't want to scare away people who can understand the guidelines even if they can't work the techniques - As more protocols get added a title with HTML and CSS in it will become  </s>
<s> really long.  </s>
<s> E.g. HTML, CSS, XML, XSL ... accessible design guidelines.  </s>
<s> Leonard R. Kasday Institute on Disabilities/UAP at Temple University, Philadelphia PA  </s>
<s> The word "Document" implies a document.  </s>
<s> So are the guidelines limited to just documents or do they include HTML applications?  </s>
<s> At the present, there isn't much attention applied to HTML applications, so maybe the term makes sense for this release.  </s>
<s> Coordination Group (E-mail) We are using the term document in the UA guidelines.  </s>
<s> So maybe something like.  </s>
<s> WWW Document Universal Design Guidelines The guidelines maybe should be called "Universal" since they also promote the exclusive use of W3C standards and authoring practices that related to the orginal intended purpose of elements.  </s>

<s> I don't understand what you mean by an application, other than a User Agent or an Authoring tool / generating tool.  </s>
<s> As I understand it at the moment the AU guidelines specify (among other things) that the product of any tool which automagically generates (or assists in the generation of) HTML should be producing code according to the GL group's guidelines.  </s>

<s> Applications written using HTML.  </s>

<s> It contains a discussion of how to implement drop down menus in Dynamic HTML using JavaScript.  </s>
<s> Oh yeah.  </s>
<s> I remember.  </s>
<s> Actually I would say that these are still HTML documents - they are nased on HTML, and have a whole lot of extensions used.  </s>
<s> The question is then whether there is an accessible way of doing what they do.  </s>
<s> But perhaps I digress.  </s>
<s> These are a concern.  </s>
<s> Like accessible Java it appears that it could take a long time before they are readily available in an accessible format that can be used by everyone (since they will rely on a whole suite of things) Unfortunately they are not really things for which there is an alternative method - the best that can be done is very much poorer.  </s>
<s> A recent example occurred in Victoria.  </s>
<s> University admission for undergraduates throughout the state is handled by a centralised organisation.  </s>
<s> Their online enrolment system was based on a Java Applet.  </s>
<s> Which I couldn't get to run on any system I had at work, including downloading Netscape 4.5 (as the site Recommended) and installing it fresh.  </s>
<s> (Maybe the Mac version is different...) It may have been possible in this case to use a CGI technology instead - might not have looked so lovely, but there's nothing very impressive about my tax dollars funding a big grey square and an Applet Can't Start message anyway.  </s>
<s> But there are cases I can imagine where it is not possible, and more where it is going to be a hard sell.  </s>
<s> I don't think that leading edge technology is going to very often be designed with accessibility in mind, including websites, which is unfortunate.  </s>
<s> This is one of the reasons I have been keen to raise the issue of getting the event model in HTML corrected as well as trying to kluge something together which will cover most situations.  </s>

<s> This was written in response to Charles McCathie-Nevile's latest contribution on this topic, with the subject line appropriately renamed.  </s>
<s> For the most part, I think the latest draft handles the issue of scripts quite well: it recommends that they be made directly usable, where possible, but the basic point is that alternative versions of the document that do not depend on scripts, and offer the same functionality, must be provided.  </s>
<s> As Charles has intimated, the best solution is to use server-side scripts to produce interactive content, as a substitute for, or an alternative supplied in parallel with, Javascript and other client-side scripts and applets.  </s>
<s> This technique does not appear to be expressly stated in the guidelines, however.  </s>
<s> An accessible site must be capable of serving only HTML plus style sheets, to a client that does not support scripts, image files, audio files, etc., with all information conveyed in well marked up HTML, but with those other (multimedia) services provided for those who  </s>
<s> can take advantage of them.  </s>
<s> This appears to be the essence of what the guidelines are requiring in many of their specific recommendations.  </s>
<s> Server-side scripts and data bases which generate content dynamically are of the utmost benefit in achieving the desired goals; and they need to be mentioned in appropriate parts of the guidelines, as valuable techniques, with further elaboration in the "techniques document".  </s>
<s> Moreover, sites in which the content is largely generated by the server from data bases, or which use templates to achieve internal consistency, are easier to maintain (and this is also a significant advantage of style sheets).  </s>
<s> Actually it is my hope that this does not appear to be the essence, but that this is clearly and explicitly identified as being the essence.  </s>
