Hi Jim, I think we should be handling these as issues - we've practiced that bit now - I don't have much faith in me and Peter trying to resolve our differences on our own. 
This is what some issues might look like ... Peter also silently removed xml:lang from OWL Lite. 
(or forget to put it in ...) Jeremy TITLE: rdf:XMLLiteral, xml:lang in OWL Lite DESCRIPTION: AS&amp;S does not permit these features in OWL Lite. 
These features are critical for I18N; and needed for addressing multilingual labels as seen in requirement [R16/R18 User-displayable labels]. 
and for including marked up text, such as needed for accessability, ruby annotation, or bidirectional text. 
There omission also needlessly hampers interoperability between OWL Lite, OWL DL and RDF. 
RAISED BY:Carroll REFERENCE TITLE design trade-offs in syntax of OWL DL DESCRIPTION: any matching of RDF triples with a DL view is going to have some ugliness somewhere. 
The current AS&amp;S design has prioritised a clean abstract syntax and allowed the concrete exchanged syntax to be very difficult to describe, test, implement or understand. 
An alternative emphasis in the design on a clean characterization of OWL DL in RDF graphs, should be explored. 
This will put some of the ugliness in the mismatch into the abstract syntax, RAISED BY: Carroll REFERENCE: TITLE: annotations DESCRIPTION: The annotations permitted in AS&amp;S are: - not particularly clear quite what is and is not permitted - appear to have some arbitrary exclusions of certains rdfs properties - break semantic layering - appear to permit user defined annotations, without providing any mechanism for defining them This issue is to resolve the syntax and semantics of annotations and their interaction with the rest of the ontology (if any). 
RAISED BY: Carroll REFERENCE: Jeremy -I think youu are right that some things need to be dealt with as issues, and these three seem significant enough to deal with. 
Do you think that these three will be it, or are they just examples and you think there may be many more (I'd love the first of these to be the correct answer :- ) Professor James Hendler hendler@cs.umd.edu

(Like we have done for some of our other requirements).
