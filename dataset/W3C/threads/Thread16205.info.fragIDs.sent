<s> The current WAI Web Content Accessibility Guidelines allow for the use of tables since stylesheets are not supported, but they caution you to make sure that your pages make sense if the tables are "linearized", which effectively means "if all your tables were converted to comments, does the page still make sense?"

<s> The approach I use in commercial design is to rely on basic CSS (the stuff that either works on browsers or doesn't cause problems when it doesn't) to provide what I call "flow and float" layout.  </s>
<s> In other words, given the huge range of possible visual rendering devices, I aim for something that will make reasonable use of the available space, and at the same time make sense in browsers where CSS is not supported (pre-1998 versions) or where it may be turned off or otherwise adjusted (mobile devices, audio interfaces such as telephone browsing services, TV based web services, etc).  </s>
