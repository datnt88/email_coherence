<s> I hope this is the right place to ask this question.  </s>
<s> I am trying to run html-tidy on an NT machine (actually, I'd love to run it on a solaris box, but haven't succeeded in downloading that version).  </s>
<s> What I =want= to do, is to process the files such that they are written to a new directory, something like  </s>
<s> html-tidy in/*.txt  out/*.txt  </s>
<s> This is not working.  </s>
<s> I can redirect single files html-tidy in/foo.txt   </s>
<s> out/foo.txt but not wildcards.  </s>
<s> Beyond that, as may be evinced from the non-html file ending, what I'm =really= trying to do with this group of files is to process some text files that contain html, but which are not, in and of themselves html.  </s>
<s> In an ideal world, this would mean that I'd have a way to suppress the html header and footer, but I can find no way to do so.  </s>
<s> Is there anything to be done?  </s>

<s> Try something like this: copy in\*.txt out cd out for %%f in ( *.txt ) do html-tity -m %%f It's been a long time since I did DOS; you may have to tweak the above to get it to work.  </s>

<s> for %%f in ( *.txt ) do html-tidy %%f  ..\out\%%f because the redirect is evaluated once for the entire "for..." command, not once for each file.  </s>
