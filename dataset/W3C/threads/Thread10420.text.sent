I've summarised all threads with comments below. 
In future messages, I'll only summarise _new_ threads. 
Stuff that's been assigned an issue number and stuff that's been closed won't show up. 
Stuff where dialogue started but no issue numbers or closure has happened will still appear. 
Marc Carrion's "abstract class" Ongoing discussion(?) Brian has tracking IDs for the following issues: PFPS untyped literals: Pat responded PFPS datatypes: Pat responded PFPS typed literals: Pat responds PFPS typed literals + lang tags: Pat responds. 
PFPS XML literals and LV Pat responds PSPF RDFS closure rules: Pat responds PFPS RDF closure rules: Pat responds PFPS translation into lbase: Response from Pat PFPS lbase / xml literals: Response from Pat PFPS xml schema datatypes: Pat responds Other messages: Guus Schreiber comments on rdfs: Brian asked for clarification DanC issues -01 and -02: Assigned tracking numbers, discussion continues on rdfcore Joseph Reagle on canonicalisation &amp; co: Brian assigns two tracking numbers. 
PFPS blank node identifiers in syntax: Dave responds proposing his fix. 
PFPS on informal meaning in RDFS vocabulary: Brian summarises and records as pfps-11 PFPS on non-well-formed lists in vocab: Brian summarises and records as pfps-12 Bob MacGregor: two comments Frank and Bob in clarification (no issue yet?)

Not clear if this is a new issue or should be merged with other PFPS social meaning comments. 
Dangling things: jan grant: test case issue Dangling!

http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/ Q: What's yellow and equivalent to the axiom of choice? 
A: Zorn's lemon. 
Excellent work Jan, thanks! 
That one has got to the point of having test cases and I suggested the concepts and primer editors could pick up on the two points. 
In offlist email Seth said he wasn't sure if he wanted to treat this as a last call comment so I sug gested we should till we are sure its not. 
Brian (LC comments appear starting the 23 Jan) (that is, the thread starting with message 0192) - a pointer to the comment status tracking page doesn't appear to be on the WG home page. 
Stuff that Brian's allocated tracking IDs for no longer appear, since I presume he'll chase these down himself. 
(By the way, occasionally I use "OP" to signify "original poster" below) New things: Herman ter Horst on RDF graph equality General comment in support of terminological change, no followup. 
PFPS: error in semantics document He's right, and I thought I'd seen Pat respond, but there's no followup in the archive I can see. 
PFPS: questionable statement in RDF semantics He's got a point (although it's borderline), no followup. 
Olivier Corby on XMLLiteral Pat responds: does his answer satisfy? 
No ack from OP yet. 
Bob MacGragor on Statings "Much ado about nothing" Call to ditch semantics section 3.2.1. 
Maybe Brian should pick this up? 
Dan Brickley: editorial suggestion for RDF test cases Jan acks, suggests striking the slightly obsolete text. 
Danbri's ok with that, final disposition required. 
Dan C: reification lacks examples Brian gives this id danc-03, will not appear in future summaries Dan C: PICS, RDF, bagid, examples? 
Danbri: not on your nelly. 
Note in question needs revision. 
Solicits opinions from Ralph. 
[note not part of LC documents, will not chase next week] Qu Yuzhong on RDF Semantics: No followup. 
Qu Yuzhong on appendix A of schema/vocab: No followup. 
Dave Hodder on syntax / xhtml and rdf: Assigned id hodder-01; won't appear here next week. 
Tim BL (A developer) on bagid: Lots of followup, no disposition yet. 
Pat Hayes on lang tags in typed literals: Pat Stickler agrees; Brian concerned about second LC. No disposition yet. 
epromote on business broadband: Looks like a fantastic offer to me, how can you refuse? 
Stuart Williams with a load of comments on concepts: No response yet (just a day or two old) Erick Calder typo in schema No ack. 
Older messages updated status: Guus Schreiber comments on rdfs: Brian asked for clarification, no response. 
PFPS blank node identifiers in syntax: Dave responds proposing his fix. 
Bob MacGregor: two comments Frank and Bob in clarification (no issue yet?) PFPS: Can RDF say anything about anything? 
Brian seeking clarification, example. 
Clarification supplied, n tracking numbers yet. 
PFPS: what's an RDF namespace? 
Patrick Stickler agrees; Pete Johnston agrees; no disposition. 
Arjohn Kampman: duplicate axioms in RDF MT doc Pat acks, will be fixed.

http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/ "NOP" is a trivial implementation of an executable Z subset. 
Thanks Jan, great work again: This is a comment on the semantics doc, so I see it as Pat's bailiwick. 
I'm not sure if this is a formal last call comment or not. 
We have two running. 
One is about syntax and removing bagID etc and the other is about the semantics of reification. 
I've just replied to both to figure out whether we have a comment here or not. 
Guus clarified that he was not making a lc comment, so I've closed this one off. 
These are comments on concepts and syntax. 
Graham? 
Dave? 
Awaiting change id. 
Awaiting change id. 
Typo in the URL - should be an "l" at the end, but apart from that, is this the right link? 
I don't see that message from me in the archive. 
Brian That thread in the archive has a message from Seth - you indicated in a followup to the last conspectus that we'd treat his message as a LC comment unless we heard otherwise. 
jan grant, ILRT, University of Bristol. 
http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/ Random act of violence against bread: whole pint. 
-- extract from the "Hawk the Slayer" drinking game But this is also a thread on reification (and Pat has been commenting on those threads, if not on this one). 
Up to a point, it's fix one, fix them all. 
See above. 
I also have a Primer pre-LC comment from Peter on this same issue. 
Frank Manola The MITRE Corporation 202 Burlington Road, MS A345 Bedford, MA 01730-1420 Ah, I think you mean I've responded asking Seth whether we can close it. 
Brian I'd overlooked that particular message. 
Noted. 
0191 is about "the meaning of RDF tokens": The URL for PFPS' social meaning comments is: #g Graham Klyne I have replied to the original email and subsequent debate. 
If its considered a Pat-editorial, then I propose to deny this request, end. 
However I thought it was best considered by the whole WG, if only briefly, as there seems to have been quite a lot of headscratching and moaning about this section. 
Pat IHMC(850)434 8903 or (650)494 3973 home 40 South Alcaniz St.(850)202 4416 office FL 32501???????????(850)291 0667 cell phayes@ai.uwf.edu http://www.coginst.uwf.edu/~phayes s.pam@ai.uwf.edu for spam I agree. 
I also am thinking that a number of comments of this kind arise because the formal semantics is very much not the whole story, and the RDFcore work is not the end of formal semantics in RDF. 
When reading some comments about Bags, etc, I got the feeling that we really do want to designate some vocabulary now with a clear informally-specified meaning so that people can use it. 
At some point in the future, semantic extensions may formalize those meanings. 
RDF is part of an evolving framework, not an end in itself. 
I happen to believe that the RDF core represents an important staging point of limited functionality: it may be seriously incomplete as an agent or ontology language, but for many of the applications that motivated RDF (e.g. PICS), and others developed since (e.g. Dublin Core, CC/PP, Brian's P3P work, Patrick's OpenBook(?), etc.) I think it represents a very useful trade-off of functionality and complexity that meets some present requirements. 
Therefore, I think the lack of formalizations for some aspects of RDF "meaning" is not an indication that RDF is seriously deficient. 
#g Graham Klyne It's also worthwhile noting that a number of existing applications are happily using these "underspecified" bits of vocabulary, such as containers, based on their informal meanings, to do useful work. 
We have at least one app in-house that is happily using reification in the same way. 
Without meaning to diminish the importance of formal semantics for things, people do manage to successfully communicate meanings in English sometimes (and incorporate it into their software).
