<s> I'm incorporating content hashing into the Site Valet problem reporting and tracking database, as a system-determined measure of what has changed when a page is updated: * User asserts [some aspect of page] needs fixing * Valet makes hash on [that aspect] * Valet checks again when webmaster claims to have fixed it I'm not sure how useful this will be, but it's one step up from purely manual inspection.  </s>
<s> For this, I've switched from Base64 to hex for the hashes, to make my own parsing easier.  </s>
<s> The two are of course functionally equivalent.  </s>
<s> Anyway, can I ask folks to take a look at the system: does it look basically sensible as it stands: * Go to any page displaying the Site Valet badge (e.g. http://valet.webthing.com/qa/)  </s>
<s> * Click on the badge to get a report * Click on the "comment on this page" link * Does this Form make sense to you?  </s>
