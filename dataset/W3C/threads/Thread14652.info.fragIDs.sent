This question came up on the XHTML-L mailing list; I've quoted my reply below which contains some context and the body of my concern. 
Namely, that by eliminating the start/value attributes for ordered lists and choosing to rely upon CSS 2, the XHTML working group has made the mistake of embedding actual -content- (the "correct" number values for an item are content or meta-content) in CSS, which is a no-no. 
Is this something for the WCAG group (to add to our guidelines "don't do this even though by spec you can"), for P&amp;F (as it represents an error in XHTML/HTML Strict), or even for the XHTML working group itself? 
I'm not sure if I'm writing to the right place or not. 
--Kynn PS: I think that this example is related to why I didn't like the 
previous proposal floated on this list for resolving abuse of "class." 
By suggesting that semantics be embedded in CSS via a property for that purpose, and presenting that to the user via exposing "class" information, you're ignoring the WCAG checkpoint which requires pages to be usable without CSS. 
What's needed is better use of the markup, not a hack in CSS nor elimination of class.

Subject: RE: [XHTML-L] Question on start/value attributes for ol , li elements 
I've dug around the Web looking for how to actually do this, but have not found any documentation stating how an author of an XHTML 1.0 Strict document has full control *in markup* over ordered list numbering using the CSS2 counter-increment and counter-reset constructs. 
Maybe it's trivially easy, but the examples in http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/generate.html#counters are inadequate. 
To the best of my knowledge there's no way to do this in markup, only in CSS. 
Which is somewhat worrisome, as the W3C's Web Content Accessibility Guidelines [1] specify that pages should be usable without CSS; this could prove problematic if numbering is reserved for CSS. 
Thus, the removal of start/value attributes, which are actually encoded content (not presentation), is problematic.

This is as good a place as any to raise the issue.? The preferred place to deal with it would, I think, be in PF, because we would like to use PF to head off as many "the spec lets you do this, but don't" rules as possible before they are needed. 
[Aside, general note: Don't worry too much about where you raise issues; just do it. 
Let the chairs worry scopes and charters - that's their job. 
Might as well give them something to do.] 
However, what we are trying to accomplish in PF and GL are so intimately intertwined that it is not easy to send it one place and feel it is being dealt with in the most constructive manner without at the outset setting a hook for a check-back from time to time.

I think this is what we mean by "use a data model to capture the information, seperate the information from its presentation (although that is more complex than I think we normally say it is), provide a defualt (set of) presentations. 
(There is another question of whether the information in an ordered list is in fact paticlar numbers, or just the order of things, but I will leave that for another topic/thread/day)

Should we be concerned about the fact that newer versions of XHTML do not allow the author to capture information in the data model and instead relegate that to PF? (To play Al for a bit, it sounds like this is something WCAG should say 'yes, we're concerned about' and ask PF to bring up with XHTML WG.) Should we specifically urge that those functions within CSS which convey information (such as using ol/CSS to automatically number sections which might be referred to by that name) not be used? 
(Now -there's- a WCAG issue.) 
This would be a technology-specific technique for CSS under WCAG 2.0 plans.

For the record: I agree. 
I've always hated copying an ol list and then finding that the numbers haven't copied over.
