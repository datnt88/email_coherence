<s> Namely, that by eliminating the start/value attributes for ordered lists and choosing to rely upon CSS 2, the XHTML working group has made the mistake of embedding actual -content- (the "correct" number values for an item are content or meta-content) in CSS, which is a no-no.  </s>

<s> I've dug around the Web looking for how to actually do this, but have not found any documentation stating how an author of an XHTML 1.0 Strict document has full control *in markup* over ordered list numbering using the CSS2 counter-increment and counter-reset constructs.  </s>
<s> Maybe it's trivially easy, but the examples in http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/generate.html#counters are inadequate.  </s>
<s> To the best of my knowledge there's no way to do this in markup, only in CSS.  </s>
<s> Which is somewhat worrisome, as the W3C's Web Content Accessibility Guidelines [1] specify that pages should be usable without CSS; this could prove problematic if numbering is reserved for CSS.  </s>
<s> Thus, the removal of start/value attributes, which are actually encoded content (not presentation), is problematic.  </s>

<s> This is as good a place as any to raise the issue.? The preferred place to deal with it would, I think, be in PF, because we would like to use PF to head off as many "the spec lets you do this, but don't" rules as possible before they are needed.  </s>

<s> Let the chairs worry scopes and charters - that's their job.  </s>
<s> Might as well give them something to do.]  </s>
<s> However, what we are trying to accomplish in PF and GL are so intimately intertwined that it is not easy to send it one place and feel it is being dealt with in the most constructive manner without at the outset setting a hook for a check-back from time to time.  </s>

<s> Should we be concerned about the fact that newer versions of XHTML do not allow the author to capture information in the data model and instead relegate that to PF?
