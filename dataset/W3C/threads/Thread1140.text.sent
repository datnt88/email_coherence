Hi all Is there a possibility when pretty-printing an XML file with tidy to avoid the replacement of entities such as &amp;MyEntity; by things like &amp;amp;MyEntity;? 
I am using the following command line tidy -i -xml -asxml myxmlfile.xml 
With these switches, can I tell tidy not to break on some inline elements? 
Actually, my file is a sort of pre-XTHML with custom tags and entities, and I wish to pretty print it without mangling my entity references and with keeping my pre and inline elements untouched. 
I tried some combinations of settings, but without success. 
TiA. 
Jany No. I guess no, but could you give an example of what Tidy does and should do instead? 
I also wanted an XML reformatter that wouldn't attempt to resolve entities. 
What with that and other requirements, I ended up writing one myself. 
If you want to try it, it's available here: The parsing code is based on Robert Cameron's REX, which performs a purely lexical parse with no entity resolution involved. 
What I would love -- possibly integrated into HTML Tidy -- would be a more sophisticated configuration file for both, tree modification and pretty printing. 
I thought about using XPath and CSS like syntax like @namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml); pre { white-space: pre } pre { break: break-before break-after } a[@name] { trim: no } p { trim: if-empty } p[preceding-sibling::h1] { indent: 2 } @* { trim: if-proprietary } I think you get the idea. 
With a good set of properties it should be quite simple to get exactly your favourite coding style, it would really be a general purpose highly configurable XML tool. 
I thought about integrating libxml with HTML Tidy to use its DOM instead of Tidy's, this would ease writing APIs, we would have an XPath engine, DTD validation, at some point XML Schema validation, ... lots of cool stuff. 
I don't have the time, unfortunately. 
It should be quite simple though.
