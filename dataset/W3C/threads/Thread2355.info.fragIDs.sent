<s> The current content negotiation draft does not completely specify the feature tag registration process, because when I wrote it, I did not know what needed to be in such a specification.  </s>
<s> Reading RFC 1602 (The Internet Standards Process -- Revision 2) and RFC 1341 (MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions)) as an example, I gather that such a specification can consist of 1) a discussion of the purpose of feature tags in the content negotiation draft 2) a form to register feature tags Quoting from RFC 1602: Many protocol specifications include numbers, keywords, and other parameters that must be uniquely assigned.  </s>
<s> Examples include version numbers, protocol numbers, port numbers, and MIB numbers.  </s>
<s> The IAB has delegated to the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) the task of assigning such protocol parameters for the Internet.  </s>
<s> The IANA is expected to avoid frivolous assignments and to distinguish different assignments uniquely.  </s>
<s> The IANA accomplishes both goals by requiring a technical description of each protocol or service to which a value is to be assigned.  </s>
<s> Judgment on the adequacy of the description resides with the IANA.  </s>
<s> In the case of a standards track or Experimental protocol, the corresponding technical specifications provide the required documentation for IANA.  </s>
<s> If I understand the above correctly, this WG will not have to specify any rules to distinguish `frivolous assignments' from real assignments, IANA will infer these rules from the conneg spec.  </s>
<s> Feature tag registration is intended as a very open process, and this has some disadvantages, but it seems that IANA will act as a filter to stop weirdness like we have seen in the domain name registration rush of the last 2 years.  </s>
<s> Based on my current understanding of how IANA works, I propose to change the start of Section 8 of the current draft to the following text.  </s>
<s> ------snip------ 8 Feature tag registration Feature tags are registered with IANA using the form in Appendix [TBA].  </s>
<s> Feature negotiation intends to allow for the registration of a feature tag before an area of negotiation is standardized or even well-understood.  </s>
<s> A requirement for registration is that the tag name follows the syntax rules, and that a definition of the meaning of the tag is supplied.  </s>
<s> Registration will not require actual implementation of a feature, and there will be no test on whether the feature definition overlaps (partially) with another feature definition.  </s>
<s> ---snip--- I don't see a great need to put some kind of `how to name your feature' guidelines in the draft.  </s>
<s> The collection of feature names in a `core feature set' can act as a style guide.  </s>
<s> Getting the nature of the registration process right is crucial to the success of feature negotiation.  </s>
<s> The MIME type system has failed to deliver the kind of fine-grained information we need for the web not just because of technical limitations, but also because the MIME type registration process was designed to resist expressing such fine-grained information as a MIME type parameters.  </s>
<s> The form below is at least as important as the technical details of feature negotiation.  </s>
<s> Many people who register feature tags will only read the form below, they will not read the conneg spec itself.  </s>
<s> Making a good form is an exercise in applied psychology more than anything else.  </s>
<s> For example, the use of BNF instead of plain English in the syntax instructions means to get the user into a technical/scientific mindset rather than a marketing-speak or `the bright idea I had this morning' mindset.  </s>
<s> As a non-native speaker, I am not particularly qualified to play such language games, so please look very carefully at the form and mail any improvements you can think of.  </s>
<s> Note that in the end, this form will probably have a web-version and an e-mail version.  </s>
<s> Imagine input and textarea elements below.  </s>

<s> Instructions are preceded by `|'.  </s>
