The current content negotiation draft does not completely specify the feature tag registration process, because when I wrote it, I did not know what needed to be in such a specification. 
Reading RFC 1602 (The Internet Standards Process -- Revision 2) and RFC 1341 (MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions)) as an example, I gather that such a specification can consist of 1) a discussion of the purpose of feature tags in the content negotiation draft 2) a form to register feature tags Quoting from RFC 1602: Many protocol specifications include numbers, keywords, and other parameters that must be uniquely assigned. 
Examples include version numbers, protocol numbers, port numbers, and MIB numbers. 
The IAB has delegated to the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) the task of assigning such protocol parameters for the Internet. 
The IANA is expected to avoid frivolous assignments and to distinguish different assignments uniquely. 
The IANA accomplishes both goals by requiring a technical description of each protocol or service to which a value is to be assigned. 
Judgment on the adequacy of the description resides with the IANA. 
In the case of a standards track or Experimental protocol, the corresponding technical specifications provide the required documentation for IANA. 
If I understand the above correctly, this WG will not have to specify any rules to distinguish `frivolous assignments' from real assignments, IANA will infer these rules from the conneg spec. 
Feature tag registration is intended as a very open process, and this has some disadvantages, but it seems that IANA will act as a filter to stop weirdness like we have seen in the domain name registration rush of the last 2 years. 
Based on my current understanding of how IANA works, I propose to change the start of Section 8 of the current draft to the following text. 
------snip------ 8 Feature tag registration Feature tags are registered with IANA using the form in Appendix [TBA]. 
Feature negotiation intends to allow for the registration of a feature tag before an area of negotiation is standardized or even well-understood. 
A requirement for registration is that the tag name follows the syntax rules, and that a definition of the meaning of the tag is supplied. 
Registration will not require actual implementation of a feature, and there will be no test on whether the feature definition overlaps (partially) with another feature definition. 
---snip--- I don't see a great need to put some kind of `how to name your feature' guidelines in the draft. 
The collection of feature names in a `core feature set' can act as a style guide. 
Getting the nature of the registration process right is crucial to the success of feature negotiation. 
The MIME type system has failed to deliver the kind of fine-grained information we need for the web not just because of technical limitations, but also because the MIME type registration process was designed to resist expressing such fine-grained information as a MIME type parameters. 
The form below is at least as important as the technical details of feature negotiation. 
Many people who register feature tags will only read the form below, they will not read the conneg spec itself. 
Making a good form is an exercise in applied psychology more than anything else. 
For example, the use of BNF instead of plain English in the syntax instructions means to get the user into a technical/scientific mindset rather than a marketing-speak or `the bright idea I had this morning' mindset. 
As a non-native speaker, I am not particularly qualified to play such language games, so please look very carefully at the form and mail any improvements you can think of. 
Note that in the end, this form will probably have a web-version and an e-mail version. 
Imagine input and textarea elements below. 
---snip--- Appendix [TBA]: FEATURE TAG REGISTRATION FORM 
Instructions are preceded by `|'. 
Feature tag name: 
The name is case-insensitive, may not start with "x-", and must fit the ftag syntax rules: ftag = 1* any CHAR except CTLs or tspecials or "!" tspecials = "(" | ")" | " " | " " | "@" | "," | ";" | ":" | "\" | " | "{" | "}" | SP | HT Example: html_5dtables 
Summary: 
Supply one or two sentences. 
Example: The html 5 dimensional tables tag indicates the capability to render 5 dimensional tables in text/html documents. 
Keywords: 
Optional. 
Intends to label: [ ] a capability [ ] a preference [ ] a capability or preference 
Check one. 
Intends to be used as: [ ] tag without a value [ ] tag with a single numeric value [ ] tag with a single value [ ] tag with one or more values 
Check one or many. 
Presence of the tag indicates: Tag value (if any) indicates: Predefined tag values (if any): 
Tag values must fit the HTML/1.1 syntax rule for tokens: token = 1* any CHAR except CTLs or tspecials 
Absence (default case) of the tag indicates: 
Optional. 
Intended typical use: 
Optional. 
Supply examples of Accept-Features headers, variant descriptions, and/or variant lists. 
Add comments if necessary. 
Detailed description of indicated capability or preference: [optional] 
If more than 100 lines are needed, a reference to a related standard or document is preferred. 
Related standards or documents: 
Optional. 
Related media types (MIME types): 
Optional. 
For example text/html if the tag indicates the capability to handle some HTML extension. 
Related markup tags: 
Optional. 
For example table . 
Note that the markup language does not need to be text/html. 
Add comments if necessary. 
Related feature tags: 
Optional. 
Add comments if necessary. 
Notes: 
Optional.

Date will be supplied by IANA. 
Person &amp; email address to contact for further information: --snip-- Koen. 
Koen, MIME registration procedures are being updated. 
You should look at the appropriate Internet Drafts; I sent around the pointers a while ago, and can dig them up again. 
Larry 
Larry Masinter: 
I know that the MIME procedures are being updated. 
My comment on MIME was about the current MIME situation, I did mean to imply that the future could not be better. 
If your knowledge of recent MIME developments lets you infer problems with the the proposed feature tag registration procedure, please post corrections for the feature tag registration procedure to the list. 
Koen.
