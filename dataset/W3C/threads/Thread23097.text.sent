Hi, What is the current state of http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-DOM-Level-1-20000929/ ? 
Will there ever be a recommendation? 
The working draft is now about 10 1/2 months old... regards, Bj?rn H?hrmann { mailto:bjoern@hoehrmann.de } http://www.bjoernsworld.de am Badedeich 7 } Telefon: +49(0)4667/981028 { http://bjoern.hoehrmann.de

I guess we lost interest in moving forward the second edition of the DOM Level 1 specification given than DOM Level 2 is out and contains all the errata. 
so, for the moment and unless someone complains, there is no plan to publish DOM 1 SE. Someone else asked regarding the DOM Level 2 HTML WD. 
We are still working on it even if we're not really active in this area for the moment. 
We are dealing with backward compatibilities with DOM Level 1 HTML... Philippe Could it then please be moved to the "Working Drafts no longer in development" section on the TR page? 
PS: as we are here, there is a type in this section for "Building XHTML modules", i.e. s/superceded/superseded/ regards, Bj?rn H?hrmann { mailto:bjoern@hoehrmann.de } http://www.bjoernsworld.de am Badedeich 7 } Telefon: +49(0)4667/981028 { http://bjoern.hoehrmann.de
