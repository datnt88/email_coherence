Sorry if this has already been asked, but list archive at

GPG key http://bohm.snv.jussieu.fr/~rousse/gpgkey.html 
They may well be unreachable using that URL, but the one I use, and works (I just checked) is http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/html-tidy/

There was a fire in some MIT building and some W3C servers were down (including lists.w3.org), see http://www.w3.org/ for more information.
