I absolutely agree. 
Work should be undertaken to make the guidelines a standard.

hi dave, you have made good points. 
i view the original intent of the guidelines 
as 
being overcome by events and now governments (Federal, state and local) 
will 
use these to regulate and enforce. 
So how does the W3C move forward. 
We never foresaw this one coming. 
We need to corral the guidelines and 
decide 
how to move forward and meet this responsibility. 
My first thought is to make this a standard. 
It is easier to enforce and for each office to write guidelines as based upon the standards. 
I do 
not 
like the idea that guidelines can be enforced. 
Whereas I can accept standards being enforced. 
This is what I am use to doing.

If some body (or maybe a somebody -- like a governor, or the President or Janet Reno) says that it is a requirement that (the sites that the body has domain over) adhere to all the Priority 1 checkpoints of the WCA "Guidelines" -- what does it matter what those specifications are titled? 
Is anyone familiar with the debate that lead to the change of name from (Trace's) "Unified Web Site Accessibility Guidelines" to WCAG? 
I would hazard a bet that "WCA Standards" and "WCA Requirements" were both considered at that time! 
Despite Kynn's (and others) concern with the vagaries of the WCAG, I am 
working hard for their adoption (as a standard) for Maryland state 
government sites. 
I am sure many others on this list are pushing this where they can too. 
Sadly, I am not comfortable advocating for anything stricter than Single-A compliance at this time. 
As others have pointed out, there are two too 
many Priority 2 items (3.3 and 3.7, the requirement for support of CSS and Q in particular) that, if followed, detract from a page's presentation with older and current browsers! 
Is there any mechanism to petition that these two items in particular be down graded to Priority 3? The WCAG uses the phrase "until user agents" frequently. 
It seems to me that this same conditional should be applied to 3.3 and 3.7 in terms of assuaging priority. 
For example, "3.7 Mark up quotations. 
Do not use quotation markup for formatting effects such as indentation. 
[Priority 3 until user agents better support the Q tag, otherwise Priority 2]". 
3.3 might be better as a conditional too: "3.3 Use style sheets to control layout and presentation. 
[Priority 2 for the strict HTML 4.0 DTD, Priority 3 otherwise]" I am one of those who frequently argues FOR the merits of non-subjective use of tools like Bobby and WCAG. 
My particular bit of hypocrisy may well be driven by the fact that my perfectly accessible pages are only Single-A compliant -- and I am shamed by this! Sincerely, Bruce Bailey On Monday, July 19, 1999 3:58 AM, Javier Romanach 
This is my position too; I think the guidelines are great as guidelines 
but the conformance section, and the implication that you should use ALL "shoulds" (P2) if you use ANY, is the part that is broken. 
I am okay with leaving the priorities where they are; I just think that the compliance section, which I admit I didn't pay attention to until it was too late, is the real problem here. 
It encourages entirely the wrong approach to the Guidelines and mandates things that were never meant to be mandated.

I don't think there is a problem saying that all the things which you "should" do to make your website accessible are things that you should do. 
If people or organisations are not prepared to implement accessibility features beyond those that are going to be required for a particular level of conformance then I think the problem is not in the guidelines, but in the approach that is being taken to the requirement for accessibility. 
In that case, I would suggest that the problem is best approached by the education and outreach activity - http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO 
The conformance section had to balance the desire on the part of some for a single yes/no test of accessibility, with the belief of others that such a thing is impossible, or meaningless, and a desire from others still for a much wider range of possible conformance levels.

However, the argument that detracting from the presentation of a page in 
older browsers is more important than removing significant barriers to users 
with disabilities being able to read the page would need to be presented, as 
it has not yet.

From where in the document does this implication arise? 
The conformance 
statement simply asserts that if one wishes to claim compliance, one must 
provide certain particulars, such as the conformance level purported to 
have been attained, the applicable version of the guidelines, the scope of the claim, etc. 
The guidelines do not strive to address the questions of when content developers should achieve conformance at any particular level, what government policies and time-frames should be established, what level of conformance will satisfy the requirements of anti-discrimination law in any particular jurisdiction, etc. 
Rather, what the guidelines convey is approximately as follows: Some barriers to access are absolute, in the sense that failure to satisfy prescribed requirements will make it impossible for certain groups within the community to take advantage of the relevant web resource. 
Other barriers, though not absolute, are substantial in so far as they make it more difficult (or less convenient and efficient) for certain groups to access web resources. 
Finally, there are design techniques that can be followed, which, though they do not in themselves remove significant impediments to access, nevertheless facilitate the use of web resources by 
certain groups of users. 
From this definition are derived the three levels of priority, and hence of conformance. 
The way the conformance levels are structured, Single-A, Double-AA, Triple-AAA, people are encouraged to implement either ALL of one priority level or NONE of that priority level. 
In other words, by having a system that completely maps conformance levels to priority levels, you risk someone saying, "Well, since I 
can never get Double-AA compliance due to 14.5, I might as well 
not do 16.7, 19.3, and 14.7 since they're also P2. And I don't think I'll even look at 18.3-5, 19.4, and 20.8 since they're P3!" By boiling compliance with _guidelines_ graded "must", "should", and "may" down to a three-option choice, you going to find a lot of people will only look at Single-A and not go on to do any of the Double-AA. 
Why should they? 
They get no benefits from it, at least, none that are reflected by their compliance rating. 
I agree with whoever said that the WCAG should be used by third parties to _create their own policies_ and not simply adopted as a strict set of standards, because that's not the spirit in which the priority 2 and especially 3 checkpoints were written. 
I don't they they were intended as an all-or-nothing deal.

Yet the whole contention and debate about Checkpoint 3.3 is that it is NOT a situation where accessibility is being compromised for the sake of older browsers. 
Instead, the scenarios presented are accessible pages that older browsers can read as well, yet the Guidelines condemn as non-compliant. 
I am nervous about checkpoint 3.3 and a couple of other points, because the wording seems to mandate the use of certain methods instead of outcome. 
What makes me even more nervous, is when folks counter with 'well, you have to apply common sense to them [the Guidelines].' Forgive me for being bold, but I find common sense lacking in many instances especially in the government workplace. 
I think what is being argued for, is guidelines that give the IT professional the ability to make their web site accessible yet save them from unnecessary, arbitrary protocols.

no need to be shamed of sinlge-A, you are leading where others will follow! 
Wayne has a good point here that should not be overlooked. the end is what we are after. 
if we could describe the end instead of or in addition to the means or method with emphasis on the end, it would much clearer and a better thumb upon which to rule standards.
