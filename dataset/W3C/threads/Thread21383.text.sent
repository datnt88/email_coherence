To test my Zope annotation server, I decided to upgrade to the latest amaya client (GTK Amaya 6.4 on linux). 
When it wasn't able to post annotations, I figured it was a bug in my server. 
As a check, however, I pointed amaya at the W3C annotest server. 
It wasn't able to post there either! 
Am I the only one who has seen this problem? 
Did something in amaya break between 6.2 and 6.4?

-- Frederick Brooks, Jr., The Mythical Man Month Hello Brent, Concerning POST, nothing has changed in Amaya in these versions. 
Are you going through a proxy? 
Did you get prompted for authentication on annotest? 
I have no problems for posting to Annotest with Debian or Windows with my current Amaya. 
I fixed some problems related to the temporay name generation. 
Could you download and try the following Amaya (GTK Debian) snapshot and see if your problem still occurs? 
ftp://ftp.w3.org/pub/amaya/amaya-GTK-6.4+.tgz Regards, -jose I'm not going through a proxy. 
I wasn't seeing the authentication box. 
It would just hang. 
Of course, I just tried it again today and now it seems to be working. 
Strange Well, I'm not seeing the problem anymore even with stock amaya, but I downloaded and tested your build anyway. 
One thing I've observed is that with your changes, amaya no longer crashes on certain annotations generated by annozilla. 
It doesn't correctly resolve the XPointer, but an orphan annotation is better than a crash I'll attach the RDF for this annotation. 
Should this be resolving? 
Is the fault in annozilla's XPointer generation or in Amaya's parsing. 
(Note: This is not a stock annozilla. 
It has Doug Daniels' enhanced XPointer stuff) -- Brent "The programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed from pure thought-stuff.

Forgot the attachment. 
Here it is.

Brent, Thanks for your answer. 
I checked the annotest server a couple of minutes ago and it's down. 
I asked Eric to look at it. 
Last Friday it was working for me. 
I should have tested it again before replying you. 
Sorry! 
I'll look at this in detail and answer you back. 
Thanks!
