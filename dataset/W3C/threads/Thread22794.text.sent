I am using DOMDocument object.It has one method - save. 
But when I use it in Javascript in my Internet Explorer5 ,for saving the xml file after changes the browser shows permission denied error. 
Please help how to use the save method when noserver is involved. 
Thanks, chandan... 
This is a Microsoft DOM extension, not a W3C DOM method. 
Wrong mailing list! 
But FYI, I've been bit by this too ... it's not a Javascript or DOM issue, it's an IE security issue (can you IMAGINE the havoc if Javascript could insert little viruses on every machine that browses a website?). 
There may be some way to persuade IE that a particular script is safe for save(), but again this is the wrong crowd to ask. 
Since this method isn't a standard part of the DOM API, you should ask the authors of the DOM implementation you're using -- in this case, the Microsoft IE folks.
