<s> Hi, I think that amaya 2.4 supports HTML4.0 and with HTML4.0 we can use the property DIR that is used to define the direction of the text either LTR(Left to Right) or RTL(Right to Left) but I found that amaya 2.4 doesn't support this property!  </s>
<s> Dos anyone know how use the DIR or any other way to change the direction in amaya 2.4 but without using right justify.  </s>
<s> Regards,  </s>
<s> I think that the current version of Amaya doesn't support bi-directional text.  </s>
<s> The last one I had installed was 2.0 and I suspect that such an improvement would have been mentioned in the change log.  </s>
<s> Looking forward for bi-directional support in Amaya... The only free editor that supports bi-directional text that I know of is Microsoft's Explorer Frontpage Express.  </s>
<s> I have it working OK on a Windows 95 machine with Hebrew support.  </s>
<s> I do not know if it will work on a Windows version without Hebrew/Arabic support.  </s>
<s> It supports the dir attribute, and blocks get aligned correctly when it is used.  </s>
<s> It also allows having different elements with different base directionality (the dir attribute).  </s>
<s> (a feature not available in word processors that built HTML support on top) It doesn't have an interface to insert bi-di overrides (the bdo tag), but allows it via direct editing of the code (Big problem when writing some math).  </s>
<s> The rendering when editing is quite poor, (based on Windows bidi implementation and not on Unicode, (which increases my belief that it won't work at all on a non-bidi Windows.) so overrides do not render correctly, as well as some complicated words or phrases that mix letters and numbers or Latin characters.  </s>
<s> Also the direct editing (like a text editor) applies Bidi to everything including the markup, which can be very confusing.  </s>
<s> (Mirrored tag delimiters...) It should be pointed out though that Internet Explorer (the browser) implements Unicode bidi (so far I found no bugs).  </s>
<s> If you find a good bidi HTML/XML editor I'll be happy to check it out.  </s>

<s> Amaya parses HTML4.0 but it's know that some HTML tags or attributes are not rendered in Amaya.  </s>
<s> It's the case of DIR.  </s>
