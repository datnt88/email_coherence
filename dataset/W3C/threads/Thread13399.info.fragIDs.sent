<s> I vote "Aye" -- but see my in-line comments!  </s>
<s> Al, should we be voting on each of Len's four points -- or do you vote "Nay" to the whole thing.  </s>
<s> Al's observation suggests the following process: 1.  </s>
<s> We only include in our recommendations checks that are presently in the guidelines or techniques document.  </s>
<s> Okay, but I hope we all agree that unique links that are hidden by ALT="" is a problem that IS covered by the WCAG 1.0!  </s>
<s> I don't see a problem with breaking down a checkpoint (1.1 in particular) into several sub-categories that can each be better analyzed.  </s>
<s> 2. If we have a suggestion for additional rules or guidance, we bring them to the attention of the author guidelines (AG) group.  </s>
<s> Correct.  </s>
<s> My suggestion that we consider not allowing ALT="" is not something that is up for debate -- the point is "settled law".  </s>
<s> Likewise, the construct of ALT=" " is not up for debate either as it is explicitly prohibited.  </s>
<s> Both points are covered (Al, thanks for pointing this out) by:  </s>
<s> I think that Al or Len or Daniel will do a fine job of sharing the job of "parliamentarian" when someone (like me) suggests something that incompatible with W3C published documents.  </s>
<s> 3. When AG puts it in the document, we then add it to our techniques doc.  </s>
<s> 4. Discussions about pros and cons of new guidelines/suggestions would take place in AG space.  </s>
<s> For starters All in favor email "Aye" All opposed email "Nay" If there are any "Nays" lets etalk about it.  </s>
<s> Len  </s>
<s> Len should explain what he intended in terms of voting structure.  </s>
<s> I responded "Nay" to the four things as a bundled proposition.  </s>
<s> The other way to interpret my "nay" is that Len said "If there are any nay's, we will discuss."  </s>
<s> And I wanted to discuss.  </s>
<s> Other than that, I really agree with what you have said in your "aye" vote.  </s>
<s> We do need to institutionalize the defense of the WCAG somehow, but there is also the situation that some techniques appropriate to consider here and in AU have to do with editing dynamics, are out of scope for the content guidelines, and so should not require prior endorsement in that context.  </s>

<s> Sure, but I'd also want to encourage everyone to try to pin their ideas to the guidelines and techniques, not only to save time for the parliamentarians (grin) but also because I think it's a good exercise for getting a good critical understanding of what's there.  </s>

<s> I seem to have missed out on this rather heated interlude.  </s>
<s> The provision of a means to form a quorum, author pages, address authorities, browse and search directories... are a right.  </s>
<s> The means to achieve this is the responsibility of WAI.  </s>
<s> Voting is almost by definition excluded, because it is not inclusive.  </s>
<s> The presence of a nay is an indicator of need.  </s>
<s> It is the nays we want to know about, not the recommendations if you see what I mean.  </s>
<s> We do need a large degree of overlap of means, to enable communication between abilities.  </s>
<s> This must be lax or fluid to provide a continuum.  </s>

<s> In fact, when I sent out the original request to "vote" on this issue (what to do when we came up with tests for things not explicitly in the guidelines or techniques), I said that if there were any nays at all we'd discuss, to be sure we'd proceed by consensus.  </s>
