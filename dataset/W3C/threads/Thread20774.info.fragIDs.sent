<s> Hi everybody, Can Amaya run on Nano-X ?? I would like to use it on Nano-X .  </s>
<s> Thanks ALEX  </s>
<s> Hello, I read the documentation and searched the ML-archive, and shoudn't find an issue about this.  </s>
<s> Here is my problem: My web pages are hosted by web servers enabling the use of embedded PHP-scripts.  </s>
<s> These scripts can be pointed to the attention of the web server by many ways, one of them being the ?PHP... the php script ...? tag.  </s>
<s> My problem is that there is a confusion with the DOCTYPE header, that is being foreworded by the XML declaration: That makes the web server to confuse about this tag, and point out a PHP syntax error, even in my pure HTML documents (saved with the HTML extension).  </s>
<s> My impression is that Amaya 5.1 didn't insert this tag.  </s>
<s> So I would like to  </s>
<s> disable the auto-insertion of this tag, or modify the Doctype header so that it doesn't wake the PHP-mod of Apache.  </s>
<s> Is there a way to do that?  </s>
<s> Thanks in advance.  </s>

<s> Thus it seems that you are saving in XHTML, not plain HTML.  </s>
<s> This is why you find the XML declaration before !DOCTYPE .  </s>
<s> My understanding is that your ISP has chosen the "light PHP approach", and therefore a plain ?  </s>
<s> triggers the PHP mode.  </s>
<s> If this were the case, the only way to cope with this is really to ask Amaya people if it could be possible to save a file not in XHTML.  </s>
<s> ciao, .mau.  </s>
<s> Vincent:  </s>
<s> To me, the bug is on the server side.  </s>
<s> It's not a bug, but a feature: short_open_tag in Apache configuration.  </s>
<s> See which actually says short_open_tag boolean Tells whether the short form ( ?  </s>
<s> ?  </s>
<s> ) of PHP's open tag should be allowed.  </s>
<s> If you want to use PHP in combination with XML, you have to disable this option.  </s>
<s> If disabled, you must use the long form of the open tag ( ?php ?  </s>
<s> ).  </s>
<s> ciao, .mau.  </s>
<s> Thank you all for this precision.  </s>
<s> I seldom work with PHP, so I didn't catch the spot.  </s>
<s> I will solve it on the server side.  </s>
