<s> Hello working group I sent this Sun, 26 Apr but received no reply:  </s>
<s> Ninety computer science graduate students of mine are implementing partial HTTP/1.1 servers.  </s>
<s> They have been reading and analyzing the draft specification, versions 2 and 3, very carefully.  </s>
<s> Overall the specification is very strong.  </s>
<s> however, we find a slight amount of confusion and ambiguity, and would like to share our comments.  </s>
<s> 5.3 ambiguity on application of request header semantics.  </s>
<s> Suppose a request contains an error.  </s>
<s> Should all semantics of all correct headers in the request be applied?  </s>
<s> For example, consider HEAD /index.html  </s>
<s> HTTP/1.1 Host: 128.122.238.94:9999  </s>
<s> Connection: close TE: chunked If-Modified_since: foo "foo" is an invalid value for If-Modified, and therefore the one and only correct response to this message will be 400.  </s>
<s> Should the response, containing a 400 bad request error, return the error chunked and then close the connection?  </s>
<s> In  </s>
<s> my view the answer is yes, and we should consider adding the following sentence to the end of the first paragraph in section 5.3.  </s>
<s> (I do not fully understand the meaning of "semantics equal to the parameters on a programming language method invocation.")  </s>
<s> "The semantics of all valid headers SHOULD be applied."  </s>
<s> 8.1.4 in general, we're confused whether the specification wants servers to try to maintain persistent connections when errors occur.  </s>
<s> I believe that performance considerations make it desirable for servers to maintain persistent connections whenever possible.  </s>
<s> reasoning that a persistent  </s>
<s> connection is simply a sequence of one-request connections, it makes sense to keep using the persistent one, just as an HTTP client keeps making requests following an error response.  </s>
<s> Inserting the following sentence as the sixth paragraph in 8.1.4 would clarify this point.  </s>
<s> "If a server detects an error (status 4xx) in a client request on a persistent connection, then the server SHOULD try to parse and respond to subsequent requests on the connection."  </s>
<s> 10.4.9  </s>
<s> We do not understand the semantics of the request time-out 408 status code.  </s>
<s> We have assumed a meaning which would be clarified by inserting the following sentence after the first sentence in section 10.4.9. "When a server times-out a connection it SHOULD send a response with a request time-out status before closing the connection."  </s>
<s> It would  </s>
<s> also be helpful to clarify the meaning of "graceful close" in paragraph 2 of 8.1.4 by inserting the phrase "by sending a 408 message" following the word 'close'.  </s>
<s> We hope these comments are helpful.  </s>

<s> The working group archive does not show the earlier message, as far as I can see.  </s>
<s> That's great!  </s>
<s> Actually, no.  </s>
<s> The most recent draft, draft-ietf-http-v11-spec-rev-03.txt (and earlier ones, too), is quite clear on this.  </s>
<s> In 14.25 If-Modified-Since the spec.  </s>
<s> says, "If the request would normally result in anything other than a 200 (OK) status, or if the passed If-Modified-Since date is invalid, the response is exactly the same as for a normal GET."  </s>
<s> Your example is the "invalid date" case.  </s>
<s> TE is a request header that provides advice from the client to the server.  </s>
<s> I think you meant Transfer-Encoding: chunked.  </s>
<s> The server may send a chunked (error) response, and it need not close the connection.  </s>
<s> I think that's just trying to draw a parallel between HTTP and object-oriented systems.  </s>
<s> HTTP methods are similar to object methods, and the request headers are similar to the parameters one supplies in a method invocation.  </s>
<s> I'm not sure what, if anything, that improves.  </s>
<s> I think it's already implicit throughout the spec.  </s>
<s> Yes, whenever possible.  </s>
<s> It's considered very important.  </s>
<s> Again, I think that's redundant.  </s>
<s> If a server keeps a connection open, it does so presumably because it's prepared to accept further requests.  </s>
<s> One reason for closing a connection, in fact, is that an error forces the server to lose sync with the input stream.  </s>
<s> I think your suggestion is redundant by harmless.  </s>
<s> In general if there's an (error) response code for condition X, there's the implication that if X happens, then the server will send an X response.  </s>
<s> Timeout is but one example.  </s>
<s> Actually that phrase meant something quite different.  </s>
<s> (The paragraph mentions both clients and servers, and a client can't send a 408 message.)  </s>
<s> The phrase means that the agent should try to close its connection in a way that lets any packets in transit reach their destination.  </s>
<s> It's worded elliptically to avoid making it too TCP-centric, but what it really wants to say is "avoid forcing a TCP reset on the connection prematurely, because the receiving end will miss bytes in transit".  </s>
<s> Those bytes could even include a 408 Request Timeout message.  </s>
<s> Dave Kristol  </s>
<s> Thanks for the comments.  </s>
<s> I'll see if we can't clarify things in the next (hopefully last) draft.  </s>
