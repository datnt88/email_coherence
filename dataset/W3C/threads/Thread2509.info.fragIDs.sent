<s> Here is the draft changes for the specification of the OPTIONS method.  </s>
<s> As stated in the attachment, there is some overlap with PEP.  </s>
<s> Overall, PEP is much more flexible and efficient.  </s>
<s> OPTIONS is simpler at the possible expense of efficiency.  </s>
<s> However, OPTIONS is simple and easy to implement, and thus more likely to be accepted in the HTTP/1.1 spec.  </s>
<s> I think that since many things which were once supposed to be part of the HTTP/1.1 spec are now on their own track, Its essential to have a simple mechanism of detecting support for those extensions as a part of the core HTTP/1.1 protocol.  </s>

<s> Options Method specification: Overall Changes: the URI '*' refers to the server, independent of any specific URI.  </s>
<s> The host: header may be used to specify a named proxy or origin server in a chained environment The max-forwards: header may be used to specify a maximum number of hops the request may be forwarded in a chained environment  </s>
<s> The actual OPTIONS message is contained in the request/response body.  </s>
<s> Editing changes: In section 5.1.2: - If a proxy receives a request without any path in the Request-URI and  </s>
<s> - the method specified is capable of supporting the asterisk form of - request, then the last proxy on the request chain MUST forward the - request with "*" as the final Request-URI.  </s>
<s> For example, the request - OPTIONS http://www.ics.uci.edu:8001  </s>
<s> HTTP/1.1 - would be forwarded by the proxy as - OPTIONS * HTTP/1.1 - Host: www.ics.uci.edu:8001 - after connecting to port 8001 of host "www.ics.uci.edu".  </s>
<s> + Proxy Servers should use the Host: or max-forwards: header + to determine whether or not to forward the reqeust as + specified in section 9.2 In section 9.2: If the Request-URI is an asterisk ("*"), the OPTIONS request is intended to apply to the server as a whole.  </s>
<s> A 200 response SHOULD include any header fields which indicate optional features implemented by the server (e.g., Public), including any extensions not defined by this specification, in addition to any applicable - general or response-header fields.  </s>
<s> As described in section 5.1.2, an - "OPTIONS *" request can be applied through a proxy by specifying the - destination server in the Request-URI without any path information.  </s>
<s> + general or response-header fields.  </s>
<s> + OPTIONS messages may be passed through a proxy by using + either the host: header to indicate the intended destination + of the OPTIONS message.  </s>
<s> The max-forwards: header may also + be used to indicate that the destination is the Nth hop, + as specified by the max-forwards: header.  </s>
<s> + Origin servers supporting 'virtual interfaces' or + 'virtual servers' may use the Host: header or the max-forwards: + header to determine the intended destination as well.  </s>

<s> 9.2.6 Applicability The OPTIONS method is intended to provide a mechanism by which a downstream client or proxy may query an upstream proxy or origin server about what HTTP/1.1 extensions it supports.  </s>
<s> While this has some overlap with the PEP[ref] specification, it only provides functionality for the lower spectrum of PEP.  </s>
<s> It is simple to implement and should be a MUST for implementations.  </s>
<s> Along with the simplicity comes a cost.  </s>
<s> OPTIONS request need a network round trip, while PEP does not.  </s>
<s> Therefore, should PEP become a standard, or be rolled into this specification, implementations are encouraged to use PEP where applicable to gain extra flexibility and performance, however, they MUST support OPTIONS as well.  </s>
<s> JC The actual OPTIONS message is contained in the request/response JC body.  </s>

<s> Connection: close Allow: HEAD, GET, POST, TRACE, OPTIONS Re-reading the spec, it is possible that we should have used 'Public' rather than 'Allow' in that response.  </s>
<s> I believe that our thinking was that we wanted re result to get back through a proxy, but I'm not sure.  </s>
<s> Our response is consistent with Apache: OPTIONS * HTTP/1.1 HTTP/1.1 200 OK Host: www.apache.org  </s>

<s> Content-Length: 0 Allow: GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, TRACE Connection: close (hmm... apache doesn't list POST... perhaps it is interpeting that as 'OPTIONS /') ... but not quite what John Mallery's Common Lisp server does (it uses the Public header) [I folded the 'Public:' for this mail]: OPTIONS * HTTP/1.1 HTTP/1.1 200 OK Host: wilson.ai.mit.edu  </s>

<s> Connection: CLOSE Public: post, PUT, TRACE, OPTIONS, DELETE, GET, HEAD Cache-Control: NO-CACHE ... any others out there?  </s>
<s> A section defining some variation on the above as the expected behaviour if no body is sent (no Content-Length header) would do the trick.  </s>
<s> I just checked, and if there is a body, we just ignore it and send the response above, so I guess that a client could detect that a server like our current version just didn't know about this when it got back no body.  </s>
<s> I can't easily run that test on those others... On another note, is it your intention that the feature-token values be specified as a part of whatever document defines the feature?  </s>
<s> If so, we should add feature-token values to the next HTTP/1.1 for the optional features it specifies.  </s>

<s> I realize that some people were opposed to the introduction of qvalues on Accept-Encoding.  </s>
<s> However, during today's editorial-group discussion of the CONTENT-ENCODING issue, we realized that the syntax for the various Accept-* request headers in RFC2068 is almost, but not quite, uniform, and we reached a tentative agreement that it might be a good idea to have all of the Accept-* request headers (Accept-Range is a response header) have similar syntaxes.  </s>
<s> Anyway, here are the BNFs in question, from RFC2068: 14.1 Accept Accept = "Accept" ":" #( media-range [ accept-params ] ) media-range = ( "*/*"  </s>
<s> ) *( ";" parameter ) accept-params = ";" "q" "=" qvalue *( accept-extension ) accept-extension = ";" token [ "=" ( token | quoted-string ) ] 14.2 Accept-Charset Accept-Charset = "Accept-Charset" ":" 1#( charset [ ";" "q" "=" qvalue ] ) 14.3 Accept-Encoding Accept-Encoding = "Accept-Encoding" ":" #( content-coding ) 14.4 Accept-Language Accept-Language = "Accept-Language" ":" 1#( language-range [ ";" "q" "=" qvalue ] ) language-range = ( ( 1*8ALPHA *( "-" 1*8ALPHA ) ) | "*" ) The CHARSET-WILDCARD issue, already declared "closed", changes the BNF for 14.2 (Accept-Charset) to include "*", based on ftp://ds.internic.net/internet-drafts/draft-holtman-http-wildcards-00.txt so that the BNF there is now: Accept-Charset = "Accept-Charset" ":" 1#( charset [ ";" "q" "=" qvalue ] ) Henrik's proposed solution for CONTENT-ENCODING, at would modify the BNF for 14.3 (Accept-Encoding) to be Accept-Encoding = "Accept-Encoding" ":" #( codings ) codings = ( content-codings | "*" ) As you can see, there are only two non-uniformities remanining among these four sections: (1) The Accept header allows extension parameters, not just qvalues.  </s>
<s> (2) The Accept-Encoding header does not allow qvalues.  </s>
<s> I'll also note that RFC1945, while not defining qvalues, does say: D.2.3 Accept-Encoding The Accept-Encoding request-header field is similar to Accept, but restricts the content-coding values which are acceptable in the response.  </s>
<s> I.e., there seems to have been an intent that Accept-Encoding be similar in form to Accept, and (perhaps) that the omission of a qvalue here was simply an oversight.  </s>
<s> (Note that RFC1945 explicitly allows "*/*" in the Accept header, so it implicitly allows "*" in the Accept-Encoding header, and so I think we need to include "*" in the Accept-Encoding header simply for compatibility with RFC1945.)  </s>
<s> As I said in my previous message, introducing qvalues for Accept-Encoding won't work "if any existing servers or proxies would choke on a qvalue in an Accept-Encoding header."  </s>
<s> But (so far) nobody has asserted than this is an actual problem.  </s>
<s> -Jeff  </s>
<s> Great! I guess this might go along well with my suggestions to streamline and concentrate the explanations, too.  </s>
<s> Regards,Martin.  </s>
<s> I feel that the burden of proof that adding q values does *not* introduce new problems is entirely on your side.  </s>
<s> You need to show that this does not break or disable existing implementations.  </s>
<s> As stated, this would be a clearly infeasible burden of proof for ANY change to the protocol, since nobody has an exhaustive list of existing implementations.  </s>
<s> One could just as easily argue that the same requirement should apply to your proposed (and accepted) change to Accept-Charset, draft-holtman-http-wildcards-00.txt, which changes the RFC2068 syntax to allow wildcards.  </s>
<s> You do make a plausible argument that implementations of RFC2068 would ignore "*" in Accept-Charset, but I don't recall seeing the results of exhaustive testing.  </s>
<s> I repeat my request: if anyone has specific information that this is an actual problem, I would certainly withdraw the proposal.  </s>
<s> At any rate, I have looked at the source code of a number of servers (including Apache), and tried a few experiments (including via an existing commercial proxy implementation).  </s>
<s> It looks like if Accept-Encoding includes a content-coding with a qvalue, it's simply ignored.  </s>
<s> (The fact of the matter is that almost NO clients actually send Accept-Encoding today; Henrik thought that there were none in actual use, but I found a few uses in our proxy traces, all from Lynx users.) By the same logic as you used in draft-holtman-http-wildcards-00.txt, where you said it was OK to define "*" in Accept-Charset because RFC2068 servers would simply ignore it, it should be OK to introduce qvalues in Accept-Encoding if the servers also would simply ignore the associated content-coding.  </s>
<s> However, it might be a good idea to include this note for client implementors: Note: use of a qvalue with a content-coding defined in RFC2068 ("compress" or "gzip") may cause an RFC2068-compliant implementation to ignore the content-coding value.  </s>
<s> -Jeff  </s>
<s> Jeffrey Mogul:  </s>
<s> Well, I guess I disagree with your tentative agreement about what might be a good idea.  </s>
<s> I feel that the burden of proof that adding q values does *not* introduce new problems is entirely on your side.  </s>
<s> You need to show that this does not break or disable existing implementations.  </s>
<s> At this stage in the standards process, we are supposed to be fixing problems based on implementation experience.  </s>
<s> For me, this means that compatibility considerations *always* outweigh considerations of cosmetic uniformity.  </s>
<s> So you'd better show that the compatibility considerations are absent.  </s>
<s> Koen.  </s>
<s> If you merely look at the specifications, there is enough evidence that HTTP/1.0 had intended the "accept*" headers to be consistent and that the distinctions in HTTP/1.1 were different parts.  </s>
<s> From that point to not require a burden of proof in order to reinstate consistency.  </s>
<s> If there's evidence that this would cause some interoperability difficulty, then we should certainly consider this carefully, but we're otherwise on good grounds procedurally for proceeding.  </s>
<s> Larry (as wg chair)  </s>
<s> Sorry, that's nonsense.  </s>
<s> The specifications are different because the implementations are different.  </s>
<s> Henrik and I spent well over a year looking at different implementations in order to derive the syntax for each header field -- had they been the same, we would have been overjoyed to use a single syntax.  </s>
<s> The most painful thing about the HTTP spec work was dealing with shortsighted designs and then having to explain them to others.  </s>
<s> There is no q-value for Accept-Encoding because the following two fields are not equivalent Accept-Encoding: x-gzip;q=1, x-compress;q=1 Accept-Encoding: x-gzip, x-compress for any of the existing server implementations of HTTP/1.x.  </s>
<s> It is therefore wrong for the specification to suggest that it would be.  </s>
<s> If such a change is made, then there must also be a requirement (not a note) that prevents the use of a q-value with any encoding other than identity.  </s>
<s> Otherwise, you will have changed the protocol.  </s>
<s> .....Roy  </s>
<s> This is more a reminder to implementers than a response.  </s>
<s> The RFC 2068 definition of OPTIONS does allow a body in both the request and the response -- it just doesn't define what to do with it, and then confuses the issue by a poor example (mea culpa).  </s>
<s> Whether or not a message body is present is defined by section 4.3: The rules for when a message-body is allowed in a message differ for requests and responses.  </s>
<s> The presence of a message-body in a request is signaled by the inclusion of a Content-Length or Transfer-Encoding header field in the request's message-headers.  </s>
<s> A message-body MAY be included in a request only when the request method (section 5.1.1)  </s>
<s> allows an entity-body.  </s>
<s> For response messages, whether or not a message-body is included with a message is dependent on both the request method and the response status code (section 6.1.1).  </s>
<s> All responses to the HEAD request method MUST NOT include a message-body, even though the presence of entity- header fields might lead one to believe they do.  </s>
<s> All 1xx (informational), 204 (no content), and 304 (not modified) responses MUST NOT include a message-body.  </s>
<s> All other responses do include a message-body, although it may be of zero length.  </s>
<s> It is easy to forget about checking for a message body.  </s>
<s> I know, because I fixed a bug in Apache 1.2.1 last week having to do with this same issue.  </s>
<s> Failing to check is a problem because, if the connection is persistent, the unread message body will be mistaken for the next request.  </s>
<s> .....Roy editorial note: the second sentence in that middle paragraph is bogus.  </s>
