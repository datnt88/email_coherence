Hi, I've been trying in vain to add constraints to a xforms. 
What I am trying to do is to make sure the user will enter an integer in a certain field. 
I found easy to test the length of a field or others things using Xpath functions, but I dont see how I can test the type or how I can use regular expressions. 
In the code below, the user can enter a 2 characters string, even if the type is an integer. 
How can I prevent the user from entering anything else than numbers ? 
Regards Pierre Busnel PS: By the way, I think Xforms is the "next big thing". 
Or I'll be damned to try to understand how it works for nothing !! --- controls.xforms

Pierre, I'm not an XForms expert.... But, I think I noticed a possible typo in your code... 
In type="xs:integer" constraint="string-length()=2" required="true()"/ You are "typing" your bing to xs:integer But I don't see the XS name space declared. 
Is it possible that should be xsd:integer? 
I don't know if it makes a difference at the instance level, but my xforms code has types in my instance variables as well (atleast those that are *not* declared in a schema.) Hope this helps!

Well, I found out I could use the number() function to be sure the user enter an integer only, doing like this: On the others end, I tried adding the xs name space and didn't notice any change, but it make the Xforms more coherent. 
I am still looking for a way to use regular expressions if you have any idea. 
Thans for your replies Best regards Pierre Pierre Busnel
