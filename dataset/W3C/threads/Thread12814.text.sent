Web Design 2000 Contest Entrants EASI's Web Contest Awards EASI is proud to announce the results of its contest for universal web design. 
Web Sites were evaluated both on their general attractiveness and HTML design as well as their accessibility for people with Disabilities. 
EASI bears full responsibility for its decisions. 
While EASI strove to conform to the WAI guidelines, in many cases, decisions and comparisons become subjective. 
We have ranked the winners in four categories: Extraordinary, Exceptional, Honorable Mention and Fully Accessible. 
We thank our winners for setting an example for other web designers to follow.

Norman Coombs, Ph.D. Chair of EASI I am a bit concerned by these results. 
I find that several of them are not fully accessible according to WAI guidelines, and the majority of these designs would not be considered acceptable in any commercial environment, which I was hoping the contest would encourage.

Norman Coombs, Ph.D. Chair of EASI Laurence, Alan, I've added it to our agenda for tomorrow's EOWG meeting. 
I had some of the same reaction as Laurence, but noted that all the winning sites in the contest seemed to be university-based, and so aren't necessarily going to reflect leading edge electronic commerce design. 
My general reaction is that these kinds of contests really help awareness. 
I don't think that they're supposed to be a substitute for the "gallery" that we've been talking about http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/Gallery ; and over time, there should be more &amp; more choices of Double-A WCAG compliant Web sites from which any contest can select winning designs, and also more &amp; more choices of tools &amp; approaches with which to comprehensively evaluate sites. 
But in the meantime -- nice to see people including accessibility as in contests. 
By the way, I get an error message at the "extraordinary design" award site -- "Could not find the application specified in the URL", using Opera 3.61. 
Anyone else get similar result?
