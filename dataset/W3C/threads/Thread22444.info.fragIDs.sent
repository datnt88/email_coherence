Sorry for the repost, but I was not a part of the list when I originally sent this and none of the comments were CCed to me. 
I'm interested in hearing what people say with regards to the Java package issue. 
Andrew n marshall student - artist - programmer "Everyone a mentor, Everyone a pupil" I notice that none of the Java API definitions include a package name. 
Since this is imperative to the usability of you interface definitions, could you please include this on the next draft of the spec? 
For now I'll be content with using org.w3.dom.core, ...dom.xml, and ...dom.html. 
Perhaps this needs to be preceded by "level1"?

In an upcominf release, package names will be added. 
Hi Gavin, 
When is the next release due? 
I thought it was supposed to be out late January-early February. 
It's now March. 
Any date in sight? 
Thanks, David
