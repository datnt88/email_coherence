Greetings, 
How do I associate more than one input field with one label ?? For example, 
let's say I have a Telephone number field but have two boxes, i.e. one for 
the area code and one for the actual number. 
Ignoring the fact that I could 
have an area code label, is there a way of associating these two input 
boxes with the one label ?? Please don't question why I have done it this 
way, or that I should redo it this way. 
I'm not interested in workarounds. 
Just wondering if it is possible. 
Then I can go back to them to tell them 
that they have to change it. 
Thanks in advance. 
Regards, 
Kieran

Hi Kieran, 
in HTML you can't do this in the general case. 
The closest approach is to use the fieldseet and legend elements which are designed to do something like this. 
See 
"Each LABEL element is associated with exactly one form control." and 
see http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/interact/forms.html#h-17.10 for fieldset and legend, which do what you are looking for. 
There is a little hack that is often used of putting things in a table, where you can associate one cell with a number of others. 
A handful of 
screen readers present this information as if it were achieving your 
goal here. 
But you don't have a formal way of saying that the label applies to the form controls in particular, which is the checkpoint 
requirement as I understand it. 
In particular, unlie with fieldset/legend you have to do some nasty hacking to get an accesskey... just my 2cents (Australian official value) Chaals On Wednesday, Nov 26, 2003, at 15:24 Japan, 
Hi, Would thie following be of any use? 
(Aside from breaking the "Each LABEL element is associated with exactly one form control." rule) Cheers, Dave. 
Sorry, Dave. 
p Phone Number: Is how I would do it.

A fieldset may be what he's looking for, too.
