FWIW, it turns out that using hyphens does not work very well when you want to specify a DOM for your language For SMIL, we thus went from hyphenated names to camelCase - clip-begin from SMIL 1.0 became clipBegin in SMIL Boston Really? 
I'd be grateful for more details. 
As far as I know, all programming languages with DOM support treat XML names in the DOM as quoted strings, so the hyphen should make no difference at all.

true if all you want is the generic XML DOM, in which case you don't really need to "define a DOM for your language" - you get this for free not true if you want a language-specific DOM, in which case the XML attributes become identifiers in whatever programming language you want to use for the DOM you may want to dispute the need for the latter, but the SYMM WG felt that this would be needed, especially since it makes manipulating attribute values simpler in Ecmascript (java seems to be less of a problem)
