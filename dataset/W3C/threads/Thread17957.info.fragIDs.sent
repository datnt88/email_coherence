<s> Hello, I propose adding the following clause to the definition of applicability: A checkpoint applies to a user agent unless: [other cases] - It cannot be satisfied due to hardware or operating system limitations.  </s>
<s> This would cover the case, for example, of changes to font family on a device where there is only one font family available.  </s>
<s> It would also, I believe, cover the case of operating system conventions when no conventions exist on that system.  </s>

<s> I agree, but don't we already say where supported or something to that effect?  </s>

<s> Ian, I am not sure I like the word operating system since it seems a little broad in scope.  </s>
<s> I think I would rather see workding like: device driver or system resources limitations People should be able to over come most operating system limitations, but system services would be much more difficult.  </s>
