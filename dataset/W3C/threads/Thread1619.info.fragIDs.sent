<s> Of course not :-) However, now that I have a supporter I can at least try to be a bit more greedy ;-) For my anticipated use of this report, getting the version URLs as well would be a substantial gain over having to query the DAV:checked-in property for each change.  </s>

<s> As a potential implementor of this report... no issues.  </s>
<s> Personally, I'd also like to see move/copy reflected in the comparison report.  </s>
<s> If a client is fetching the report to detect a difference, it would be nice to see "ah. that was copied from over there ".  </s>
<s> I don't have anything solid syntax to suggest here, though.  </s>
<s> I'll write something up if people think it would be beneficial?  </s>
<s> (and with the understanding that a server is not required to record copies/moves in the report, but could use add/delete).  </s>

<s> Agreed.  </s>
<s> Another alternative to making the DAV:checked-in special (or saying that the version resource URL is explicitly returned), is to simply allow a DAV:prop element to exist in the report request, and each set of properties will be returned for each [VCR] href mentioned in the report.  </s>

<s> OK, let's get a bit more disciplined here (:-).  </s>
<s> Does anyone else want this change to be made?  </s>
<s> By default, it stays the way it is (i.e. version URLs) unless the working group expresses a clear preference for making the change.  </s>
<s> Note that one could compute the VCR's from the version URLs by just doing a Depth PROPFIND for the DAV:checked-in property on the baseline-collection, and then match up the version URLs with the versions from the Depth PROPFIND.  </s>

<s> Assuming that Depth:infinity is not available (a good presumption, given the use of baselines in the first place as a way to avoid overload), then your PROPFINDs will take log(N) requests before you find the VCR that corresponds to version in question.  </s>
<s> However, if you return VCR URLs, you can get the VR URL in a single PROPFIND.  </s>

<s> Nah, DAV:prop is obsolete, think DAV:expand-property! BTW the DAV:baseline-collection is defined as a collection of checked-in version-controlled resources -- I assume that the collection itself is 'protected', i.e., servers will fail attempts to check-out those VCRs otherwise the property definition is violated.  </s>

<s> Good point!  </s>
<s> I'll add the appropriate preconditions to CHECKOUT, MERGE, and UPDATE.  </s>
