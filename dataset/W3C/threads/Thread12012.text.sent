A Suggested Procedure For Handling Massive Proposed Changes I would like to suggest a procedure that will help streamline disposition of massive amounts of proposed changes, such as those documented in my revisions of the 30 April 1999 draft. 
This procedure is intended to make things easier on everyone and still accomplish the necessary work. 
The procedure may also be helpful for dealing with editorial changes in general. 
1. 
The submitter of massive changes assigns an identifier (e.g., a number) to the most critical changes. 
2. The submitter posts to the list a brief description of the most critical changes along with the revised material or a link to the revised material. 
Working group members and any other interested parties should review the material and comment on any of it. 
3. The chair assigns one or more editors to classify the changes as either "editorial" or "non-editorial". 
Editors can determine the disposition of editorial changes (accept, reject, adapt, delay-decision) in consultation with the chair. 
Non-editorial changes presumably require open discussion on the AU list. 
4. By the end of an established deadline, the editor notifies the submitter of the classification of the changes (i.e., editorial or non-editorial). 
I suggest that the chair establish a deadline for this notification as one week from the day that the changes were posted. 
The notification should also indicate which of two drafts of the WATG document will reflect the disposition of the editorial changes; these drafts are: (1) the first draft following the posting of the changes and (2) the second draft following the posting of the changes. 
The editors are encouraged to advise the submitter (a) which changes that may warrant detailed discussion on the list, (b) the order in which post non-editorial changes. 
5. At a date no later than release of the second new draft from the time of the posting of the changes, the status of each editorial change assumes one of the following statuses: (a) accepted (these are reflected in the new draft), (b) rejected (the new draft reflects the reject status by a lack of change), (c) adapted (the new draft reflects this partial implementation), (d) decision-delayed (because this may be mistaken for "rejected", the editors must notify the submitter of this decision [see the next step]), (e) convert to non-editorial change (the editors must refer this issue to the Working Group for discussion). 
For any editorial decision for which the decision is "decision-delayed", the editors must notify the submitter of the decision, including information about the date by which the editorial decision will be reflected in a draft that is available to the submitter. 
For any editorial change that the editors convert to a non-editorial change, the editors have the responsibility to post the issue to the list. 
Note that all these actions have the same deadline -- the date of the release of the second new draft from the time of the posting of the changes. 
6. 
The submitter, editor, or any other reviewer should at any time post on the list the descriptions of issues (including any non-editorial issues) posed by the proposed changes. 
Commenters should indicate their position and their rationale. 
Ideally, these postings will include "before" and "after (e.g., "original" versus "proposed") quotes for changes in wording. 
(Ideally, the submitter would post such as list at the same time as the document or link to the document is posted. 
But this can be a very time-consuming process. 
The editors must initiate and conduct their classification of the issues even in the absence of such descriptions. 
See #3 and #4.) 7. At a certain point (Is it "Last Call"?) the editors and chairs will have the responsibility of tracking resolution of all non-editorial changes. 
(I think that is correct. 
Someone please correct me if I am wrong.) 
The editors may find it beneficial to do some tracking even prior to that time. 
Note that a key feature of this procedure is that it engages the editors and the submitter in a dialogue regarding the disposition of the suggested changes, particularly the editorial changes. 
Also, because the submitter is informed whether the changes are editorial or not, she/he can decide the nature and time of additional postings on the same issues. 
Without this communication, the submitter may not know whether the suggestions have been "heard", whether the editors consider them editorial or not, or whether they will ever be acted upon. 
I request that that this procedure or some variation upon it be agreed upon and followed, beginning with the posting of my 19 May 1999 revision of the 30 April 1999 draft of the WATG document.

It would be much better to identify issues individually, and send them to the list, for the following reasons: 1. Better history - the list is archived and can be viewed by thread, which would make it possible to track single issues. 
The same applies to issues lists, etc which need to be generated. 
2. It is much easier to provide a useful agenda for a meeting if there are distinct proposals or issues, rather than reverse-engineering them from a whole second version of the document (it is actually harder to read a heavily annotated document than to do sequential edits). 
3. It is enables a faster triage of editorial versus substantive issues. 
If you have a set of changes which you feel are editorial, and make no difference to the document please feel free to send them in the same message. 
The current editorial approach is to err on the side of conservatism in most cases.

I feel when reading these that it might be better to address each topic (or group of related topics) in a separate thread in order to get better concensus rather than dumping a straight list of changes to the WG. 
I admit that I have a tendency to get lost in large lists of suggestions and can deal better with "here's what I think we should do about issue " style of discussion. 
Am I the only one?
