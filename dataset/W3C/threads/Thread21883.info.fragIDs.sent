<s> I think this is a good thing.  </s>
<s> While I think I understand your interest, it's not clear to me that the DOM needs provide direct support for concurrency-related issues.  </s>
<s> If something like this is required, the specification should at least make it clear that the getMutex() can return null -- not all environments support concurrency, or an implementation may not want to provide explicit support for it.  </s>
<s> Perhaps you need to present your motivation for using the DOM nodes as synchronization objects independently from Java -- the idiom of using an arbitrary object for synchronization is not used in all languages.  </s>

<s> In the intro, "DOM Level 2 does not specify multithreading mechanisms."  </s>
<s> And DOM Level 1 listed threadsafety as an issue deferred to later levels.  </s>
<s> Every time the DOM has looked at the idea of requiring that implementations be inherently threadsafe, we seem to come back to the same conclusions.  </s>
<s> This can be a lot of overhead in applications which don't need it, and is insufficient in applications which do need it since the conceptual unit is often several DOM operations so they'd still have to implement threadsafety at the higher level... which would make protecting the DOM itself of negligable value.  </s>
<s> However, it's still on our open issues list as something to consider.  </s>
<s> As is the possiblity of simply being able to "lock" the whole DOM (claim ownership of it for an extended period and hold off other users until ownership is explicitly released), which is probably a more useful operation but which still seems to involve a lot of overhead for applications which don't need this protection.  </s>
<s> If someone can find a Really Useful Low Cost Portable Solution in this space, I'd be delighted.  </s>
<s> Suprised, but delighted.  </s>
<s> Until then, you'll have to handle threadsafety at the application or implementation-dependent level.  </s>
