<s> dear Sir/madam, I am a student currently working on : how the MathML script can become a matematical expression by studying the amaya source code.  </s>
<s> It seems that amaya use The Thot Toolkit API.  </s>
<s> So my lecturer said that i must understand the thot Toolkit first.  </s>
<s> He told me to make a simple application using Thot.  </s>
<s> I have some question: 1. Amaya use Thot for creating MathML document.  </s>
<s> Does Amaya use thot function for displaying the MathML document ?  </s>
<s> 2. Can i make a simple application using Thot Toolkit under windows?  </s>
<s> cause i heard that Thot is not available on windows platform.  </s>
<s> 3. I already have The Thot Toolkit API manuals that contains about 200 functions.  </s>
<s> But there is no explanation how to use these function.  </s>
<s> Is there any tutorial or document about how usinsg Thot Toolkit API ?  </s>
<s> I'm waiting for your answer as soon as possible.  </s>

<s> I guess you should read: which is a short introduction to the Amaya Architecture.  </s>
<s> You should also read: which explains how to build an application based on Thot.  </s>
<s> See more comments in line.  </s>
<s> Yes. In fact it uses Thot functions to create and modify the tree structure and Thot displays the corresponding elements based on the MathML presentation schema (file MathMLP.P).  </s>
<s> To know more about presentation schema and the P language, refer to:  </s>
<s> Yes, you can.  </s>
<s> Amaya is in fact a Thot application.  </s>
<s> Look at file EDITOR.A, which defines Amaya as a Thot application.  </s>
<s> To understand this file, refer to  </s>
<s> Yes. Refer to the documents mentioned above.  </s>

<s> Hy, I am working with the source code of SVG editor of Amaya and i find this bugs: - Make a line parallel with the axis x with the mouse its impossible, the second point of line is changed when this element is created.  </s>
<s> - Its difficult select with the mouse a line parallel with the axis x.  </s>
