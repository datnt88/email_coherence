dear Sir/madam, I am a student currently working on : how the MathML script can become a matematical expression by studying the amaya source code. 
It seems that amaya use The Thot Toolkit API. 
So my lecturer said that i must understand the thot Toolkit first. 
He told me to make a simple application using Thot. 
I have some question: 1. Amaya use Thot for creating MathML document. 
Does Amaya use thot function for displaying the MathML document ? 
2. Can i make a simple application using Thot Toolkit under windows? 
cause i heard that Thot is not available on windows platform. 
3. I already have The Thot Toolkit API manuals that contains about 200 functions. 
But there is no explanation how to use these function. 
Is there any tutorial or document about how usinsg Thot Toolkit API ? 
I'm waiting for your answer as soon as possible. 
Thank you very much. 
kind regards, The Fe Ping.

I guess you should read: which is a short introduction to the Amaya Architecture. 
You should also read: which explains how to build an application based on Thot. 
See more comments in line. 
Yes. In fact it uses Thot functions to create and modify the tree structure and Thot displays the corresponding elements based on the MathML presentation schema (file MathMLP.P). 
To know more about presentation schema and the P language, refer to: 
Yes, you can. 
Amaya is in fact a Thot application. 
Look at file EDITOR.A, which defines Amaya as a Thot application. 
To understand this file, refer to 
Yes. Refer to the documents mentioned above.

Sorry, wrong link.

Hy, I am working with the source code of SVG editor of Amaya and i find this bugs: - Make a line parallel with the axis x with the mouse its impossible, the second point of line is changed when this element is created. 
- Its difficult select with the mouse a line parallel with the axis x.
