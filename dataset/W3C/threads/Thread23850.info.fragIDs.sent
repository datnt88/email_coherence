Anyone know if there is a PC shareware that can view all the font installed in the machine? 
So that you can compare which font to pick when using word, photoshop, etc. Thank you!

Hello all, You may be interested in a program called ThumbsPlus. 
It displays thumbnails of virtually all graphical formats and can also quickly generate a table with all the charaters of a font. 
It can even be blown up to full screen so you can see all of the characters in a reasonable size. 
I do not have a web site address for the software, but the "about" section lists two e-mail addresses: cerious@vnet.net and 76352.142@compuserve.com 
I can't recall the price, but it was very reasonable considering the power and flexibility this little gem has. 
I would recommend you look into it. 
Please note that I have no relation to the manufacturer except as a satisfied customer.

I picked up a free Windows 95 extension from the Microsoft site that lets you double click a font file, and get all the properties of the font including previews at several sizes. 
I don't remember for sure what it was called, but I think 
property.exe. 
I picked it up at the same time I got the font smoothing 
stuff, so I guess it's somewhere around there.

Double clicking (opening) a font on Windows 95 displays a sample of the font. 
This is a standard feature of Windows. 
I Think Steven is thinking of our font properties extension, which provides additional information about TrueType fonts when you right-click on them and select 'properties'. 
It can be downloaded from If you have Word you can run a macro (documented somewhere under available fonts') which will create a document containing samples of all your installed fonts.

No, we produced a new font properties extension just within the past few months with a lot more functionality. 
It is available only on our Website and has not yet shipped with any version of Windows, or update release.
