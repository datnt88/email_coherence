<s> (a) (Different structuring of the same content).  </s>
<s> The data in this case is the solid facts "County= Age= Movie".  </s>
<s> The structure is the marking up of the three different parts using headings.  </s>
<s> *Presentation* would be adding extra presentational data to make the definitions 'twixt content and structure more clear.  </s>
<s> It's two different logical assertions about the data, but the data doesn't change.  </s>
<s> This is an ontology thing, whereby you have the same set of data, but with different output relationships:- [ County = Age | Movie ] People in this county of age x like these movies.  </s>
<s> [ Age = County | Movie ] People in of this age in county x like these movies.  </s>
<s> This *doesn't* change the data, the results (favourite movie overall etc.) will remain the same.  </s>
<s> However, with CAM you have:- County 1 Age Group1: Movie Age Group2: Movie County 2 Age Group1: Movie Age Group2: Movie But with ACM you have:- Age Group1 County 1: Movie County 2: Movie Age Group2 County 1: Movie County 2: Movie The four results of favourite movie for each age/county group stay the same, they are just presented in a different order.  </s>
<s> Note that this is like a table of x and y variables.  </s>
<s> It doesn't matter if you swap around x and y to become y and x.  </s>
<s> I think what is implied by the guidelines is that presentation is a guide to content.  </s>
<s> In other words, you should make sure that the h1/h2 headings are clear, and that the data is marked up with keywords etc.  </s>
<s> All you are asking us to do is to define what we mean by content/structure/presentation, as implied by the title :-) Content: Information/data.  </s>
<s> Structure: Logical divisions within the content.  </s>
<s> Presentation: Output styling to the structure.  </s>

<s> I don't mean to be copping out but I think the answer is "both".  </s>
<s> IOW the same content can be both structured and presented in more than one way.  </s>
<s> Is a pie chart different from a table or a bar graph or a...  </s>
<s> The content can not only be presented in various ways, it can be structured in various ways, but the *separated* content is still the content.  </s>
<s> The message is *the* message.  </s>
<s> The medium is *a* message (almost unto itself).  </s>
<s> The medium (presentation) includes variable structures.  </s>
<s> Most programming tutorials used to start with "turn off your computer".  </s>
<s> In the same sense of them trying to train you to begin with well-formed pseudo-code so a lot of writing advice has to do with starting with an outline (structure) and filling it in with content.  </s>
<s> The usual cliche is that 5 % of programmers (writers) can program (write) without commenting (outlining) and 95 % of programmers (writers) think they are part of that 5 %.  </s>
<s> The possibility of getting individuals to change their long-ingrained habits of "wysiwyging it" seems remote.  </s>
<s> The possibility of getting the tools they use to make this innate in the process is more hopeful.  </s>
<s> E.g. when someone puts up a centered, enlarged, specially enfonted phrase, it might be heuristically determined that the intent is for this to be some level of header.  </s>
<s> Same with all kinds of "presentational" devices, including italics, bold, underlined, font changes, colorizations, etc., etc.  </s>
<s> The tools must ask "you've just changed color here, does this mean anything?"  </s>
<s> Potentially every markup element (even a "purely decorative" one) is structural.  </s>
<s> Why did you put this excerpt from your text into a little box over there under the style class of "sidebar".  </s>
<s> The jargon is that the markup has meaning but the method used to emphasize/highlight/enhance it is: presentation; under ultimate control of the user, even though a choice is made by the author.  </s>
<s> If I don't want anybody to ever see my stuff in other than "chilly font" that's just tough.  </s>
<s> If I'm convinced that the purpose of my content's communication is aborted by removal of "chilly font" then I'll just have to explain that somewhere (metadata?).  </s>
<s> These are rare circumstances and are even amenable to codification, e.g., when we read to a child saying "see how 'brrrrr' has icicles dripping from the letters?"  </s>
<s> or to a blind child "the author has illuminated the letters of 'brrrrr' with little icicles" can be handled with some combination of content, alt, and/or longdesc.  </s>
<s> Love.  </s>
<s> ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE  </s>
<s> This is a tricky question.  </s>
<s> The answer isn't a or b, as I see it.  </s>
<s> There is data, and it is modelled.  </s>
<s> In both examples there is a data model, represented as markup.  </s>
<s> In fact this is not, in my opinion, the best way t mark up two-dimensional data - that is what tables are really really meant for.  </s>
<s> So these are two different structured representations of a data model.  </s>
<s> To be able to query them means that the model needs to be comprehensible - prefereably not just visually.  </s>
<s> In both cases it is.  </s>
<s> If this data were modelled in a table then it would be easy to use tablin to get different views of it.  </s>

<s> Len, I'll take a stand on b) The variances are presentation ... Presentation has it's own structure, and this is structure of the presentation, not structure of the content.  </s>
<s> If I had the data in a pure database, such as Access, I would change these variances in the "reports", not in any structure of the data itself.  </s>

<s> They are different presentations of the same content, which is why it is very useful to think of XHTML as a display language, not a content language.  </s>
<s> A correct content language would be written in XML and would not have "headings", which are simply one way of translating content into a format which can be displayed on a specific type of output agent -- a web browser.  </s>
<s> This isn't the only way to display that content, or even the best way to do it.  </s>

<s> I see what Kynn means.  </s>
<s> I think the main hurdle here is actually defining what:- a) Content b) Structure c) Presentation d) Style e) Formatting are, because there are so many different possible interpretations.  </s>
<s> We all use them in different contexts, so we rarely agree on technicalities of points, when for the most part we all agree on the ideas.  </s>
<s> Example: Sean said: (a) (Different structuring of the same content).  </s>
<s> Kynn said: (b) (Different presentation of the same content).  </s>
<s> But really we both *mean* the same thing, and we both used very similar arguements.  </s>
<s> I think we have to look into the fact that (X)HTML is a document markup language - for marking up documents (presentationally for the most part).  </s>
<s> Of course, some semantics were added at a later date.....and the other point of confusion is how best to display data, XML style..... If we could all agree on definitions of the above, we'd be half way there.  </s>
