I was checking out Peter's proposed entailment and noticed something in the semantics document that I don't understand... From: LV = ICEXT(I(rdfs:Literal)) and If x is in ICEXT(I(rdfs:Datatype)) and y is in ICEXT(x) then y, LV is in IEXT(I(rdf:type)) This looks a bit like a "type error" to me: I understand IEXT(I(rdf:type)) to be a set of pairs v,c , where v is some value and c is an individual class value (not a set of values) But I also understand ICEXT(I(rdfs:Literal)) to be a *set* of values. 
Did you mean for the final semantic condition to read: If x is in ICEXT(I(rdfs:Datatype)) and y is in ICEXT(x) then y, I(rdfs:Literal) is in IEXT(I(rdf:type)) which by the first rdfs semantic condition is equivalent to saying: If x is in ICEXT(I(rdfs:Datatype)) and y is in ICEXT(x) then y is in LV. #g Graham Klyne GK@NineByNine.org Yes, good catch, thanks. 
I will fix this. 
Now done in the version on my website (in spite of my promise to Brian.
