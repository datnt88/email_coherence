Amaya 3.2.1, Win 2K Bill, this site is not valid HTML. 
Regards, Jim FitzSimons There is a /html closing tag before the pre element in the source. 
That would probably be interpreted by amaya as teh end of the document, so it would add a /body before it, and then render what it has. 
Lynx is much more forgiving like that, which occasionally causes me problems.

Now, how about somebody responding so promptly to the situations where it's amaya that's broken. 
Aaah, that's a bit trickier. 
It requires finding that it is amaya, finding out what is wrong, and then finding the time to write some code to fix it. 
The Amaya team are small, dedicated, and very overstretched. 
I think they generally do a pretty good job of responding, although they are not able to solve every problem immediately.

This validator says this page is not valid HTML. 
Regards, Jim FitzSimons For the page at This page has errors. 
What does P="CENTER" mean? 
Anyway, neither this nor the extra /TR on line 193 should cause Amaya to crash or enter an infinite loop. 
Unfortunately, that is what happens. 
Using GDB under Linux-ELF, I was able to determine that Amaya recurses very deeply while processing this page. 
I stopped the backtrace listing at around 1400 frames (function-calls). 
Amaya seems to repeat the following sequence of function calls: CheckRowHeights() AttachAttrWithValue() AbstractImageUpdated() ChangeConcreteImage() ComputeEnclosing() HeightPack() ChangeDefaultHeight() ResizeHeight() UpdateCellHeight() When I remove the extra /TR , Amaya can display the page without going into the infinite loop. 
I'm using Linux; however, under Windows such a deep recursion is likely to use all of the available stack space and cause a GPF. 
For the page at I fixed the P="CENTER" tags by hand, and I used HTML Tidy to fix up the page as much as possible. 
Even so, Amaya doesn't render this page properly.

That page causes a crash in Amaya under Windows 98. Amaya locks up and I had stop the Amaya execution. 
There was not a GPF. 
Regards, Jim FitzSimons This problem is fixed in the CVS base now.
