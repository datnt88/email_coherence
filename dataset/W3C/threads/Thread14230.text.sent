Hi, Participants tended not to read all the text of each Guideline / Technique, but to skim it. 
This meant that some important information was missed. 
Potential solution: * It was suggested that the text could be in shorter phrases and bullet points. 
Related problem: Different presentations. 
Some Participants said that they prefer to read long documents from paper, rather than on-line. 
Previous work by Andrew Dillon (1994) has indicated that it can be more difficult to read from the screen. 
Potential solutions: * Could a printed version be provided? 
This would not be a trivial task: it would lose its hypertext nature; all links would have to be replaced by references, etc. * If the Guidelines and Techniques were broken into smaller files, with links between sections, and had more bullet points it may reduce the burden of reading it on-line. 
It would also reduce the current loading time of the pages. 
Related problem: bold text Each Guideline is made up of ordinary text, bold text, and links, which in combination can make the text difficult to read. 
The bold text is used to highlight the text of the Guideline, to indicate the groups of users affected, and to emphasise particular information. 
Potential solution: * The groups of users affected could be listed at the beginning or the end of the Checkpoint. 
This would remove the distraction of the bold text, for example the second paragraph of Guideline 1 could read: "If text equivalents are not provided for visual information, the following groups will not know the purpose of the visual components of the page. 
People who: list item are blind, list item have low vision, list item cannot view graphics, list item have chosen not to view graphics." 
* Where bold text is used for emphasis, such as paragraph 3 of Guideline 2, it could be removed altogether where the points are repeated in the Checkpoints. 
* The links in each Guideline could also be listed separately from the text of the Guideline, so that an author can more easily read to the end of the Guideline, then follow links (as mentioned in our previous message regarding navigation). 
This would mean each Guideline and Checkpoint would be structured thus: its current text, none of which would be bold, with the groups of users and links listed at the end. 
By the way, some bold text is presented using b , others with strong . 
Is this intentional?

WC:: We have been trying to make the phrases as short as possible. 
More strides towards this end were hopefully made in the last version, as editing still continues. 
We welcome all proposals for particular changes! 
WC:: We provide a zipped version, a postscript version, and a PDF version. 
WC:: how do you suggest we break up the document into smaller files? 
each guideline in its own file? 
each technique section? 
could you create a prototype of how this would look? 
WC:: good idea. 
we will look into this. 
WC:: other people have made this comment as well. 
We are currently removing much of the use of bold text. 
WC:: yes, we agree with your previous message. 
WC:: no, this is not intentional.

CMN: The checklist is designed to provide some accommodation for people who do this. 
However, the short answer is that people must read the document to understand it completely, and probably need to understand it completely if they are going to use it effectively. 
There are no completely satisfactory ways I know of for catering to people who won't read the whole document, and I would be strongly against any suggestion that tried to do so. 
If the comment is merely about the format of the document, then there is an editorial problem - we are obliged to have one version of the document, and providing everything in both bullet point form, and in explanatory prose of a more extended nature, would make the document unwieldy (it would not require reading both forms). 
In which case my personal preference is for prose, but it is an editorial decision. 
WC:: We provide a zipped version, a postscript version, and a PDF version. 
CMN: Most people can print from their browser without needing any other versions. 
W3C policy is that there is one official version of a document, which is specified by a URI and is therefore online, and which is in English. 
Any other version - an archived copy, a printed version, a translation, is not authorative. 
People can, and do, print versions for their own convenience, which is why htere is the caveat in the 'available versions' section. 
WC:: how do you suggest we break up the document into smaller files? 
each guideline in its own file? 
each technique section? 
could you create a prototype of how this would look? 
CMN: This would further complicate reading the document - many people find it very difficult to thoroughly read a non-linear document. 
As Chetz has pointed out, the linear version is alreday difficult to read, and people would like it to be simplified. 
My personal feeling is that having a single complete document makes referencing more intuitive and makes it clear that all the guidelines apply at the same time, and there are many implicit cross-references, which seems to be a point easily missed. 
WC:: good idea. 
we will look into this. 
WC:: other people have made this comment as well.
