To: Authoring Tool WG (AUWG), Web Content WG (WCAG WG), and WAI IG, 
The Evaluation and Repair Tools Working Group (ERWG) has been working on the Techniques For Evaluation And Implementation Of Web Content 
Accessibility Guidelines [1]. 
This document describes techniques that Web accessibility validation tools may use to evaluate the conformance of HTML documents to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 (WCAG 1.0). 
This document also describes techniques that Web authoring tools may use to help authors modify HTML documents to conform to WCAG 1.0. 
We anticipate that tool developers may develop accessibility validation and/or repair modules to be incorporated into commercial authoring tools, validation tools, and perhaps user agents. 
The ERWG believes this document is ready to be published as a public working draft, but would like comments from AUWG, WCAG WG, and WAI IG before moving forward. 
This document still needs work - thus it is a working draft. 
You will notice several double at-signs (@@) throughout the document which mark open issues, questions, and other to-do's. 
There is also a list of to-do's at the beginning of the document. 
We would appreciate comments on these as well as any other comments that you may have. 
This review period will end Thursday, April 6 2000. 
Please send review 
comments before that date to w3c-wai-er-ig@w3.org.

Here's my comments: 
Technique 1.1.1 [priority 1] Check IMG elements for valid "alt" 
attribute 
Suggested repair: If the image is assumed to be a bullet, suggested text should be 
"bullet". 
If the image is assumed to be a horizontal rule, suggested text should be "horizontal rule". 
If the image is assumed to be a bullet, one should suggest the author to use 'ul' and 'li' with style sheets. 
If the image is assumed to be a horizontal rule, one should of course suggest the author to use the 'hr' element (see URL Not doing this, would violate Guideline 3 -- "Use markup and style sheets and do so properly". 
Technique 1.1.7 [priority 1] Verify that text equivalents are provided for embedded audio files where necessary 
Is this really *always* necessary? 
If someone uses background music (e.g. some piano music) on their site (which of course is a *Bad Idea*), IMHO there's no reason to provide a text equivalent, since the background music would degrade very gracefully. 
The technique says "where necessary", but suggested message is "Audio and video files *require* [my emphasis] a text equivalent." 
Technique 1.1.12 [priority 1] Verify that valid text equivalents are provided for PRE and XMP elements used to create ASCII art. 
For detecting ASCII art, you might be interested in reading this Bugzilla report URL: http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=20195 
. And perhaps this URL: Technique 2.2.1 [priority 3] Test the color attributes of the following elements for visibility: 
Should also check if a background colour is defined when text colour is (for cascading to work with user style sheets). 
And if one or more of 'vlink', 'alink', 'link' exists, 'bgcolor' and 'color' should also be used. 
Technique 3.1.1 
[priority 2] Verify that elements do not need to be converted to an appropriate markup language. 
Suggested message: 
There's one extra (empty) bullet here. 
Technique 3.7.1 
[priority 2] Verify instances where quote markup 
should be used. 
Discussion Status: Q is not supported in today's browsers, thus converting quotes marks to Q will basically delete the quote marks for all users. 
what do we suggest in the meantime? 
I've used the CSS rule 'q { color: #color; background: #color; }' on some of my pages. 
IE supports CSS on Q elements (but doesn't display the quote marks). 
Requirement: quote should be marked up with Q or BLOCKQUOTE. Potential quotes can be identified by: Any text that is enclosed by quote marks (" " or ' '). 
And other quotation marks, e.g. 66s, 99s and guillemets (french quotation marks). 
Quotation marks in Unicode are U+2018-U+201F, U+2039-U+203A, U+275B-U+275E, U+301D-U+301F, U+FF02, U+00AB and U+00BB -- possible some more. 
The algorithm must be able to deal with nested quotes, e.g. "outside quote 'inside quote' outside quote" and ?outside 
quote inside quote outside quote? 
(where  isn't  but U+2039 and U+203A (these arent available in iso-8859-1). 
It should also be able to deal with french quotation marks where there is a small space (not a normal space) between the text and the enclosed quotation marks (??). 
Technique 3.7.2 
[priority 2] Verify that Q and BLOCKQUOTE are used 
properly 
Requirement: Inline quotes (marked with Q) have at least one word in front of, or behind, the quote text and are less than 10 words Long quotes (marked with BLOCKQUOTE) are greater than 10 words. 
An inline quote will often contain more than 10 words. 
And I'm pretty sure that has a sementically different meaning from The latter can be used when marking up a novel. 
Even when an entire paragraph contain a person's line, 'blockquote' should not be used. 
Technique 3.7.3 
[priority 2] Verify that BLOCKQUOTE is not used for 
formatting 
If the 'blockquote' has a 'p' child, we can be pretty sure that it's a real quote, right? 
Most people just write ('blockquote' *must* contain a block element (or 'script') to be valid HTML.) 
Technique 4.3.1 
[priority 3] Verify the primary language of the 
document 
Must be one of the ISO 639 language codes. 
And sub-codes, e.g. en-UK and no-NYN should not be flagged as errors. 
Technique 5.6.1 [priority 3] Check table for header abbreviations Discussion Status: How determine if an abbreviation is pronounceable? 
ASCII characters 
only? 
NO! If you do that, then 'L?ved?r' would be unprouncable, which it isn't (in Norwegian). 
Unicode 3 contains almost 50 000 characters, most are pronouncable, not just ~96 of them! 
Checkpoint 7.2 - Until user agents allow users to control blinking, 
avoid causing content to blink Should also check for 'text-decoration: blink'. 
Checkpoint 12.3 - Divide large blocks of information into more manageable groups where natural and appropriate @@Any suggestions?? 
A paragraph with more than 200 words should be divided into two or more paragraphs? 
Three or more (following) paragraphs with less than 20 words each should be converted into lists?

I propose that this should read: li If the image is assumed to be a bullet, it is recommend that list items be marked up with the LI tag, possibly in conjunction with CSS -- which can render bullets using the author's choice of graphic. 
If this approach is not satisfactory (to the author), then ALT="*" is recommended. 
li If the image is assumed to be a horizontal rule, it is recommend that horizontal rules be marked up with the HR tag, possibly in conjunction with CSS -- which can render bullets using the author's choice of graphic. 
If this approach is not satisfactory (to the author), then ALT="--" is recommended. 
I would point out that q -- /q is what both Karl Ove H. and Wendy C. used 
in the signature portion of their email (a text-only medium) to convey the 
meaning of a horizontal rule...

Well, actually it's not, it's q -- /q (note the space) which is a _signature delimiter_. 
It's used in both e-mail and newsgroups, so that e-mail clients can automatically remove the signature when replying (no point in quoting the signature). 
A "personal signature" is a short closing text automatically added to the end of articles by posting agents, identifying the poster and giving his network addresses, etc. 
If a poster or posting agent does append such a signature to an article, it MUST be preceded with a delimiter line containing (only) two hyphens (ASCII 45) followed by one SP (ASCII 32). 
The signature is considered to extend from the last occurrence of that delimiter up to the end of the article (or up to the end of the part in the case of a multipart MIME body). 
Followup agents, when incorporating quoted text from a precursor, SHOULD NOT include the signature in the quotation. 
Posting agents SHOULD discourage (at least with a warning) signatures of excessive length (4 lines is a commonly accepted limit). 
Ufortunately Outlook Express doesn't follow the standard, and actually *removes* space at the end of the line when sending/posting. 
Too bad really, since you then must *manually* remove the signature when replying.
