<s> Hi Graham Very nice to see this! Are you interested in also cataloging some features for each of the browsers?  </s>
<s> We are interested in logging which browsers support certain features that are important for accessibility.  </s>

<s> I like many people do not want to feel constrained by mainstream web browsers and would like to know what alternatives are available.  </s>

<s> I have just started a list of web browsers: (This is to be the permanent location for the page.) The goal of this page is to become the definative list for web browsers on the web.  </s>
<s> It has all kinds of categories for browsers (shareware, freeware, commercial, under development, open-source, etc.) And covers almost every operating system out there, including: win32, win16, DOS, OS/2, Java, Mac, 10 different flavours of unix, source-code, etc.  </s>
<s> One nice aspect of the page is that it is designed so that for every browser (and for each OS it runs under, if desired) there will be a URL to a web page on the internet for that browser.  </s>
<s> There is also a listing of the company/development-team responsible with a URL link.  </s>
<s> E.g. when it lists Netscape Navigator, it has a link to the Netscape Navigator homepage and a link to the homepage for Netscape Communications.  </s>
<s> I would greatly appreciate it if some folks could check out the page and let me know what you think.  </s>
<s> Also if I am missing any browsers, please let me know so I can add them.  </s>
<s> Additionally, if there are any corrections to be made to the page, let me know as well.  </s>
