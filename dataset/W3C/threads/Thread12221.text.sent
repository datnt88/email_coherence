On the call we discussed the idea that checking could be split three ways - things that require the author to check, syntax that is machine checkable, and semantics that are machine checkable. 
I took an action to write up somthing that could be used as a definition of check for in checkpoint 4.1 Proposal Check for Check for means that the tool must provide some mechanism for testing, although it may be done by asking the author to check something that the tool cannot mechanically determine, by checking syntax, which is readily automated (and required also by 2.2 and 2.3) by mechanically checking semantic information, such as searching a dictionary for acronyms, or checking colour combinations, or by asking the author to confirm guesses made by the tool (for example presenting a linearised version of a page for the author to check if it makes sense).

Proposed rewrite: To "check for" an accessibility problem means that it is identified by the tool in at least one of the following ways: a) Where it is possible to identify a problem from syntax, the tool must automate this check. 
For example, check for the presence of the "alt" attribute on the HTML IMG element. 
b) Where it is possible to identify a problem mechanically but not directly from syntax, the tool should automate this check. 
For example, calculate whether two colors do not provide sufficient contrast when compared to user preferences. 
When the tool's calculations are best guesses (e.g., linearization of a page), prompt the user to confirm the results. 
c) Otherwise, prompt the user to verify accessibility. 
For instance, if an image has an associated long description, ask the user to confirm that the description is appropriate for the image. 
Subtle, rather than extensive, prompting is more likely to be effective in encouraging the user to verify accessibility.

Note that syntactic correctness is in any case required by 2.2 and 2.3, but that there are other tests which can be completely or partialy automated Charles McCN Proposed rewrite: To "check for" an accessibility problem means that it is identified by the tool in at least one of the following ways: a) Where it is possible to identify a problem from syntax, the tool must automate this check.
