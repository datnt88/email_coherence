If one is flying to Toronto, is the Pearson International Airport the one to fly in to? 
Kathleen Anderson, Webmaster Office of the State Comptroller Hartford, Connecticut, 06106, USA e-mail: kathleen.anderson@po.state.ct.us URL: http://www.osc.state.ct.us/ Pearson and Toronto Island are both fine. 
You are more likely to find a cheap ticket to Pearson International, but the Island Airport is actually closer to downtown. 
So if you manage to find a flight to and from the Island, grab it.

I would appreciate any information about the meeting as I have to book my phone meeting. 
Does anyone what hotel we're going to yet?
