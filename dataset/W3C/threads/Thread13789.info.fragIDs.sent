There is a new version of the guidelines working document. 
It is available as both TABLE and LINEAR form. 
The urls are TABLE FORM http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/19980721.htm LINEAR FORM http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/19980721txt.htm Please look them over and comment. 
We will produce a flowing text version which we call the "easy reading" version when these settle out. 
But it looks like we are closing on a stable version pretty quickly And we believe we have addressed most of the sticky issues as best we can for now. 
Look it over and give us feedback. 
I'm sure you'll find something, (this is a test) since we pushed it out the door quickly so it would be available for the folks in Petersborough tomorrow. 
And an Extra extra thank you to Charles McCathieNevile, Jason 
White, and Josh Krieger for their tireless work and assistance with this version.

Under META informaton section of the guidelines has there been any discussion of adding META (semantic) information to indicate the purpose of a link (site navigation, table of contents) or the purpose of a table (column layout or data table)? 
I did see anything directly in the current guidelines.

As I recall META itself can only be used in the HEAD. 
For TABLE, there are meta-information markers such as AXIS, TH, COLGROUP, which are recommended in the guidelines. 
TITLE for link was there, but fell out in favour of providing proper information in the text of the link. 
TITLE for HR fell off the list of necessary things. 
HR is really a visual border, which can be reproduced in CSS using DIV. 
If it is dividing a document into sections (its most common use) then DIV or H1 H2 H3 etc are the best approach. 
If it isn't, what is it doing in the page? 
D-link can be used to provide meta-information about images and things EMBEDded. 
OBJECT (and APPLET) can provide their own metadata.

JRGs response to CMN: I was talking about the META information section of the guidelines, not the META tag.

Oh. Do you mean section D - provide META information (or something like that) ?
