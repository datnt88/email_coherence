<s> There is a new version of the guidelines working document.  </s>
<s> It is available as both TABLE and LINEAR form.  </s>
<s> The urls are TABLE FORM http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/19980721.htm LINEAR FORM http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/19980721txt.htm Please look them over and comment.  </s>
<s> We will produce a flowing text version which we call the "easy reading" version when these settle out.  </s>
<s> But it looks like we are closing on a stable version pretty quickly And we believe we have addressed most of the sticky issues as best we can for now.  </s>
<s> Look it over and give us feedback.  </s>
<s> I'm sure you'll find something, (this is a test) since we pushed it out the door quickly so it would be available for the folks in Petersborough tomorrow.  </s>
<s> And an Extra extra thank you to Charles McCathieNevile, Jason  </s>
<s> White, and Josh Krieger for their tireless work and assistance with this version.  </s>

<s> Under META informaton section of the guidelines has there been any discussion of adding META (semantic) information to indicate the purpose of a link (site navigation, table of contents) or the purpose of a table (column layout or data table)?  </s>
<s> I did see anything directly in the current guidelines.  </s>

<s> As I recall META itself can only be used in the HEAD.  </s>
<s> For TABLE, there are meta-information markers such as AXIS, TH, COLGROUP, which are recommended in the guidelines.  </s>
<s> TITLE for link was there, but fell out in favour of providing proper information in the text of the link.  </s>
<s> TITLE for HR fell off the list of necessary things.  </s>
<s> HR is really a visual border, which can be reproduced in CSS using DIV.  </s>
<s> If it is dividing a document into sections (its most common use) then DIV or H1 H2 H3 etc are the best approach.  </s>
<s> If it isn't, what is it doing in the page?  </s>
<s> D-link can be used to provide meta-information about images and things EMBEDded.  </s>
<s> OBJECT (and APPLET) can provide their own metadata.  </s>

<s> JRGs response to CMN: I was talking about the META information section of the guidelines, not the META tag.  </s>

<s> Oh. Do you mean section D - provide META information (or something like that) ?  </s>
