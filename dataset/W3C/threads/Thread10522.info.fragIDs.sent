<s> So, checking: The disallowed octets that must be %-escaped include all those that do not correspond to US-ASCII characters, and the excluded characters listed in Section 2.4 of [URI], except for the number sign (#), percent sign (%), and the square bracket characters re-allowed in [RFC-2732].  </s>
<s> I think PFPS is right, and that ", the percent sign (%)" should be deleted from the above paragraph.  </s>
<s> I tried to take the text from the usual suspects and minimize the divergence between different W3C specs.  </s>

<s> I believe that w3c-i18n-ig@w3.org and uri@w3.org may be appropriate forums for discussion of this issue.  </s>
<s> I am unwilling to make a change before the 5th September publication.  </s>
<s> Nor would I be happy with a change that is opposed by a consensus in the above forums.  </s>
<s> I am not yet convinced that this materially affects RDF since we *never* require the escaping to actually be performed, it is merely a theoretical exercise that defines a set of strings.  </s>
<s> I believe that the set of strings is the same whether or not % is itself escaped.  </s>

<s> Hmmm... that was a pretty obtuse collection of references, but I finally found something in there...  </s>
<s> The text you use seems to come from: specifically, the description of mapping IRIs to URIs, which would seem to be a similar context to what is intended here.  </s>
<s> In this context, I think it is assumed that the Unicode URI has already been formed in a way that the only occurrence of '%' is as part of an escape sequence.  </s>
<s> So in this respect, I now think the current text is correct.  </s>
<s> But, this point is demonstrated to be prone to misunderstanding, and I think a brief note of explanation is in order, e.g.: '%' is excluded from the list of disallowed octets that must be escaped, because it may appear in a URI only to introduce an escape sequence, so an additional application of escaping here would be incorrect.  </s>

<s> I should have read the thing more carefully :( What our specs says is: let URIREF = the set of URIREF's defined according to RFC2396 modified by RFC 2732 then RDFURIREF = {x : encoding(x) memberof URIREF} for the encoding defined in the spec which excludes encoding '%'.  </s>

<s> From reading RFC2396 I believe that this is not the case.  </s>
<s> In particular, my understanding is that http://foo.bar/oijoi% is not a legal absolute URI with optional fragment identifier, nor is http://foo.bar/oijoi%xy  </s>
<s> From RDF2396: Because the percent "%" character always has the reserved purpose of being the escape indicator, it must be escaped as "%25" in order to be used as data within a URI.  </s>
<s> Implementers should be careful not to escape or unescape the same string more than once, since unescaping an already unescaped string might lead to misinterpreting a percent data character as another escaped character, or vice versa in the case of escaping an already escaped string.  </s>
<s> There is lots more on escaping in RDF2396.  </s>
<s> The RDF escaping mechanism ignores most the subtleties involved.  </s>
