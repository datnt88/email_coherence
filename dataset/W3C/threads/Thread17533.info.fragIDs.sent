Simple question for the benefit of screen reader users and keyboard-navigators: 
Can I provide a link from one frame into another that doesn't involve re-loading the second frame? 
I'm providing a "jump to content" link at the start of the page, only the content happens to be in another frame. 
(I know frames are bad; it happens to be unavoidable on this one particular page.) At the moment my best idea is to put the anchor (the target of the a href="#content" link) at the *end* of the first frame. 
I expect the screen reader to then announce the start of the next frame, titled "Content". 
That sounds OK. 
But then, what do I do to let the user return to the navigation in the previous frame?

You could probably use JavaScript. 
I haven't used frames in a few years so the syntax may be off, but it would be something like this: onclick="return !(top['frameName'].document.getElementById('anchorId').focus());" 
Leave the regular target and href value that you already have in the link. 
If the JavaScript doesn't work (or is disabled or unavailable), it will return true and the regular HTML link will work. 
If JavaScript is on, it will focus the right spot without reloading the frame. 
Note: The source files of both frames should be on the same web server or you may get a security warning. 
Good luck, James Craig 
Actually, lots of things about frames are good - unfortunately there are a few architectural problems with them. 
In this case I would rely on the users. 
In common setups like IE/Jaws the users will be able to move between frames as a function of the user agent. 
In systems that don't present all the frames (Lynx, Amaya, etc) the user will be offered a choice of which frame they want to see (so they can choose the navigation frame, or the content frame, or whatever), or they can just work with the noframes version.

Dont forget to label the frames as Chaals eluded to such as navigation, content etc. so that the screen reader user can tell what is in a particular frame.
