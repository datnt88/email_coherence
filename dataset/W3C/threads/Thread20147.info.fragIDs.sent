<s> John Rooker suggested turning off the NumLock.  </s>
<s> Sounded strange to me, but, well, I tried it.  </s>
<s> Works.  </s>
<s> Started Amaya.  </s>
<s> A dialog box asked for a file name.  </s>
<s> Trying to enter text with NumLock left on: nothing.  </s>
<s> Turned NumLock off: all text enters fine.  </s>
<s> Thanks, John, for the hint.  </s>

<s> The problem with the NumLock comes from the Motif library and is not under our control.  </s>
<s> I guess the key NumLock could be interpreted by Motif as a key modifier and so could generate invalid characters.  </s>
<s> We're just exploring the possibility to replace Motif by GTK.  </s>
<s> If any person has already developed a GTK application, please let us know.  </s>
<s> That could help.  </s>
