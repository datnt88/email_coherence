<s> Audio description of video, however it is generated, is a particularly outstanding example (but in my opinion is an example not a checkpoint).  </s>
<s> I don't think this is a showstopper - the point is handled in other places anyway.  </s>

<s> I agree that captions incorrectly synchronized [poorly or mislabeled] with the video can lead to completely different interpretations - just as a transcript of our working groups minutes which are incorrectly labeled as to who is saying what can lead to completely different interpretations.  </s>

<s> For example, if we were to video record a W3C conference call where some members were present in one room, say at MIT, and others participating via the phone; and we provide the clip on the W3C web site, would it have to be closed captioned to meet the guidelines - or is it just as accessible to have the transcript of the video conference call?  </s>
<s> I can think of more elaborate video conference calls I been in where charts (HTML pages) where shown and mechanical models were displayed, but I could provide all the information in a text description file - and it be fully accessible - without the production of synchronizing captions and video descriptions with the original recorded video.  </s>
