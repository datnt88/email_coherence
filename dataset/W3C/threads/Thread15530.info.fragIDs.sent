<s> Hello Paul, Daniel, You both raise the question as to why it is harder to find information on physical and cognitive disability.  </s>
<s> Most of what you find is on Vision and Hearing.  </s>
<s> Some of the lists cited are specifically for Screen readers (e.g. BASR-L = Browsers and Screen Readers) so they will be focused on screen reading issues.  </s>
<s> Others are more general but do have a lot of traffic on visual disabilities.  </s>
<s> Below are some of the reasons why recent web focus has been on visual and hearing issues... ... followed by some resources you might check on for cross disability access issues and recommendations.  </s>
<s> REASONS YOU MOSTLY SEE VISION AND HEARING.  </s>
<s> - most of the discussion has been on how to design web pages.  </s>
<s> Web page design is a SOURCE MATERIAL issue.  </s>
<s> The major issues around SOURCE MATERIALS are whether they can be presented or display or perceived by the recipients.  </s>
<s> Hence, the focus on hearing and vision.  </s>
<s> - since most of the pages to date have been silent - the most focus has been on VISION and access by those who have low vision or blindness.  </s>
<s> - as sound is added to pages, the issues of captioning and access by people who are hard of hearing and or deaf has arisen - and is getting more attention.  </s>
<s> - people with physical disabilities have not had much problem with access  </s>
<s> to SOURCE MATERIALS in the past.  </s>
<s> The problems they have had has been with BROWSERS (or VIEWER/CONTROLLERS).  </s>
<s> Thus they have not shown up much in the HTML guidelines.  </s>
<s> They do show up in browser guidelines.  </s>
<s> - when you create browsers that are keyboard accessible so that they are easy to use by people who are blind - you also make them more accessible by people with physical disabilities who cannot use the mouse well, or are using an assistive device or alternative keyboard (both of which appear to the computer as the standard keyboard).  </s>
<s> Thus by the time you have solved the issues around blindness - you have also solve many (not all) of the issues around physical disability, including the most important (keyboard access).  </s>
<s> - many of the other physical disability issues are addressed through adaptations that have been added to MacOS, OS/2 and Windows 95/NT.  </s>
<s> - cognitive is always an interesting area.  </s>
<s> Most everything you do for people with cognitive disabilities ends up benefiting most users.  </s>
<s> As a result, many of the cog issue recommendations are the same as for good design of web pages in general.  </s>
<s> - an issue with cognitive recommendations that go further is that it is often difficult to suggest to web designers that they should change the content of their sites (beyond that which does not remove information - just present it more simply).  </s>
<s> - more is clearly needed on good web design though to decrease the cognitive load necessary to understand web sites (For Everyone).  </s>
<s> - As we get into applets and other SOURCE DEFINED USER INTERFACES we are also creating new barriers for people with physical disabilities.  </s>
<s> It is good to see a balanced interest across disabilities.  </s>
<s> It is only through coordinated cross disability access that we will create useable accessible public systems.  </s>
<s> SOME SOURCES OF INFORMATION ON ACCESS BY PEOPLE OTHER THAN VISION AND HEARING.  </s>
<s> THE PRINCIPLES OF UNIVERSAL DESIGN Guidelines for the design of consumer products to increase their accessibility to persons with disabilities or who are aging Considerations in the Design of Computers to Increase Their Accessibility by Persons with Disabilities Application Software Design Guidelines For CROSS DISABILITY access see also the work being done on kiosks which are accessible to people who have low vision, blindness, who are hard of  </s>
<s> hearing or deaf, who have reading problems or cannot read, have physical disabilities, are completely paralyzed or are deaf-blind.  </s>

<s> Thanks Gregg for the clear analysis of the situation.  </s>
<s> Agreed.  </s>
<s> When we get to work user-agent guidelines, this will show up.  </s>
<s> I was only referring to our work on format/protocol for now.  </s>
<s> I haven't yet thought about how to, or if we want to, separate the user-agent/browser guidelines from the more generic GUI access guidelines.  </s>
<s> Browsers are fastly becoming THE interface of choice on the desktop (see Win98) and an issue of scope will need to be raised when we get to work on that.  </s>
<s> Daniel Both you and Al raise the question as to whether we should have separate guidelines or not.  </s>
<s> In the other list I just mentioned (as you did) that the two will converge and that (with applets and all) you will download you viewer from your source as often as not in the future.  </s>
<s> I think we should work on some general comprehensive guidelines that start functional and then show how the requirements need to be implemented at all levels.  </s>
<s> We should also show how the requirements are not specific to disability and relate to low bandwidth connections, audio access (e.g. driving car etc), and agent access.  </s>
<s> A lot of work but we an borrow it wherever possible.  </s>

<s> In Greg's recent e-mail to both of us he makes a point that for the nonblind or nonhearing disabled population it is the browser and hardware which need modification rather than the source code (html, xml, css,etc).  </s>
<s> This strikes me as true.  </s>
<s> Most of the disabilities that I see are motor or cognitive imparements, sometimes involving partial or temporary loss of one of the senses, ie vision, touch, etc.  </s>
<s> Consequently, with respect to your questions about how the W3C can modify css, xml, html, etc to suit the disabled as a whole- rather than subpopulations of disable- the answer may be that you can not.  </s>
<s> I don't think you should assume that people interested in vision impairments are only interested in the source problems.  </s>
<s> Our group at Arkenstone is actually more concerned about providing usable browsers to our typical reading machine user (blind, low vision, dyslexic) who wants access to the information on the Web because optical character recognition is tough on newspapers.  </s>
<s> They can't begin to use the existing solutions, which are aimed at sophisticated blind computer users (and still manage to frustrate them, albeit often on source problems).  </s>
<s> We expect to work on simplified user interfaces and supporting these users, and looking to the Web community to deliver greater accessibility in the source material.  </s>
<s> The WAI process is definitely focused more on the source issues than on serving and supporting  </s>
<s> individuals with disabilities directly.  </s>
<s> The Web fosters a "if we  </s>
<s> build it, they will come" attitude, which is true of only a fraction of the people with disabilities who need these capabilities even more than their nondisabled colleagues who have other options to get access to much of the information on the Web.  </s>
<s> Still, there's absolutely no doubt in my mind that the work being contemplated in the WAI process so far is a prerequisite to any effort in this field.  </s>
<s> We can address the issues of getting this technology into the hands of more of the people who need it, when the technology has more of the hooks that it needs to support them, and source developers have an easy way of supporting those hooks.  </s>

<s> Jim, Thank you for your mail.  </s>
<s> I appreciate your interest in web access for the vision impaired user.  </s>
<s> The reason I have not responded to your mail in the past was that your signature file made it unclear to me what your association with the WAI was.  </s>
<s> When I see a company website referenced in a signature file I become concerned about commercial interests being involved and potential conflicts of interest.  </s>
<s> However, you are clearly on the WAI mailing list because the mail you quote below was not intentionally sent to you.  </s>
<s> (However, I have no issue with your receiving it.) With respect to getting the technology into the hands of the users who need it: there are many, many reasons for the motor impaired to access the web now.  </s>
<s> As more and more commerce goes on line- Seattle Sidewalk, Peapod, Amazon, etc- life will become much easier for people with severe motor disabilities.  </s>
<s> The current work being done by the WAI is not a pre- requisite to access for this population.  </s>
<s> This isn't to say that the work for the vision and hearing impaired isn't worth while.  </s>
<s> My point is that different groups of disabled people have different web access needs.  </s>
<s> To suggest that work for the vision impaired is a prerequisite to, or directly portable to, work for other groups of disabled is inaccurate.  </s>
<s> Thank you for your input.  </s>

<s> Couple of additional thoughts.  </s>
<s> - Source documents used to only be a problem for people with sensory and cognitive disabilities.  </s>
<s> - Now that we are including user interface issues in source materials (e.g. Java applets et al) we are making source materials a problem for people with all disabilities.  </s>
<s> - Moreover, solutions in the browser (e.g. if we have an accessible browser) are not enough if the source materials (including the applets) are not accessible as well.  </s>
<s> - This is just more evidence for not treating them as separate entities in discussion accessibility.  </s>

<s> I think a key area for the W3C is to develop browser guidelines and demonstrate/verify what types of browser based solutions work for people with disabilities.  </s>
<s> I think the guidelines need to be based on universal design (UD) principles, which extend the capabilities of current browser technologies.  </s>
<s> Additional controls and views need to be a part of current browsers.  </s>
