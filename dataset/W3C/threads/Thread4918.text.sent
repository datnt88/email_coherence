In the functions and operators document, section 7.5.4.1, the function fn:substring-before has the following error: Definition: |fn:substring-before|(|$arg1|| as ||xs:string?|, 
|$arg2|| as ||xs:string?|)| as ||xs:string| |Behavior description: | ||If the value of |$arg2| is the zero-length string, then the function returns the zero-length string. 
Example given: |fn:substring-before("Baloney!","")| returns "|Baloney!|". 
In the example, $arg2 is given as the 0 length string, however this returns the word Baloney. 
The behavioral description states that it should return the 0 length string. 
Am I misunderstanding? 
Thanks, Doug Thanks, this is a known error. 
The result for this example should be "". 
Michael Kay Doug, Many thanks for the report. 
Happily, this bug has been noticed already and the example has been fixed to accurately reflect the behavioral description. 
Thanks again!
