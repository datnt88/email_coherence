Is the terminology below correct? 
User agent (UA) A module which communicates with a user through a user interface, and performs network operations, possibly connecting to one or more servers, to satisfy user requests. 
Service agent (SA) An agent which performs services, either in the background or at the request of User Agents. 
Client A process which opens connections to servers, and gives commands to them and gets the results. 
Server A process which accepts connections from clients and either accepts and performs them, or refuses them. 
Important in the terminology above is the distinction between "client" and "user agent". 
User agents are usually clients, but all clients are not user agents. 
If this is the right terminology, what is then the correct word for an HTTP server which provides interactive services using HTML forms? 
From an HTTP viewpoint, such a server is a server and not a client. 
But from an application viewpoint, it is a user agent. 
So a user agent can be a server.

words like "client" and "server" and "user agent" are inherently fuzzy, and are generally meaningless unless you at least say "relative to what?" so yes, a user agent can be a client, or a server, or both.

Your terminology for "User Agent" tends to cast it in an active role ("performs network services"), which I think would also make it a "client". 
(Similarly, your definition of "service" agent seems to imply a passive role.) I am reminded of the classic case of the X-window terminal that is also a "server". 
But is it a "User agent"? 
I'm dubious (based on your definitions, it seems not).
