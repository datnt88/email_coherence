Hello, 
Per my action item from today's teleconf (minutes [1]), here is a proposal based on comments initially from Scott Luebking [2]: Checkpoint 1) Allow the user to advance and rewind in small increments audio, video, and animations.

Checkpoint 2) Allow the user to configure the increments of the previous checkpoint [Priority 3] - Ian

Ian, I think that the techniques related to these checkpoints should use the concept of "paging" through a book, to identify the region of relevant information. 
This analogy gives an idea of what a "small increment" is. 
We are not talking about frame by frame movement, but in blocks that are seconds to minutes long.

Hi On VCR that is called Skip Search (or Commercial Advance) 1 push of a key Fast Fowards a tape 30 or 60 seconds, the length of 2 to 4 commercials. 
By referring to a common phrase as an example of what is required developers will readily understand what is needed, &amp; not feel they're getting into a field that is beyond them.

I was actually thinking about whether we should ask for this in multimedia on the weg?
