The spec (13.5) does not say whether the DAV:getcontenttype property is readonly or not. 
In mod_dav it is, in PyDAV it is not. 
I claim it should not be read-only, as the client (who stored the resource via PUT) has better knowledge of the server (which can, at best, be relying on resource name heuristics to guess the content type). 
I think it should be implementation dependent. 
This issue also applies to DAV:displayname. 
Ideally a server should support changing these values, but for some implementations it just doesn't make sense or is too difficult to implement.

I believe in our implementation, the property is writable. 
The server will save the Content-type included with a PUT, but a client can also change that value later (via PROPPATCH) without having to retransmit the whole resource.
