Hi: I was just looking at my webpage using the amaya browser. 
Unfortunately, the renderer seems to do a poor job at least compared to netscape. 
I am wondering if this is an amaya problem or just me abusing html. 
The page in question is: Cheers, Robert PS: please cc me since I am not subscribed to the list I looked at the page and a bunch of lines were all rendered in the same place. 
I've actually had Netscape do the same thing to another site I worked on. 
I don't know what causes it - it seems to be pretty random. 
If anyone knows why it happens I am also interested. 
For what it's worth, the HTML looked pretty good to me.

Hi, Yes it seems that Amaya has a problem with your page. 
I'll have a look at it.

Hi Charles, The HTML is good, but Amaya has some trouble with the valign="bottom" on elements TR. 
I'm working on that bug. 
Regards Irene.
