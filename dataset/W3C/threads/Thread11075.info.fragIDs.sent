<s> May I second that.  </s>
<s> DTDs without parameter entities are MORE difficult, not less difficult, to write, to read, and ESPECIALLY to maintain.  </s>

<s> Umm... no functionality is lost without them.  </s>
<s> Some ease of maintenance goes away.  </s>
<s> But since the majority appears to want them, and they aren't hard to implement we are told, I've no objection to them being there.  </s>
<s> I prefer fewer features because I think the odds of a first season hit are better without the big show number in the first act.  </s>

<s> Unless you count ease of maintenance as functionality!  </s>
<s> ;-)  </s>
<s> Having implemented part of an SGML parser (while temporarily insane--I thought I didn't want to use SP) I can vouch for their ease of implementations.  </s>
<s> You have to put the storage management infrastructure in for general entities, hence, you are most of the way there.  </s>
<s> This issue seems to come down more on the philosophical side of what parameter entities are trying to accomplish.  </s>
<s> We all probably agree that we know enough to design something that works better but what that something is we all have different ideas.  </s>
<s> I think it would be a good idea to get a list of re-use/module/namespace issues that we are trying to solve and work from there.  </s>
<s> This is probably an aside to the current task at hand.  </s>
<s> I'm willing to help coordinate such an effort if this is not within the current tasks of the ERB.  </s>
