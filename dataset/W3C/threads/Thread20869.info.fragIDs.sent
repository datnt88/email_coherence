While working with Amaya a bit and testing it against other web editing such as Adobe GoLive, I've noticed that it generates quite a bit of syntactic sugar, namely the /li and /p closing tags. 
Or is there some policy of using closing tags at w3c that I should know about? 
Since these are not actually *used* by web clients, and since keeping them correctly matched to their associated li and p tags is a practical nightmare if even one of those closing tags gets lost, and since for other web editing tools those show up as dangling tags, I'd like to suggest not using them at all in amaya. 
Deleting them universally from the source code seems to be a straightforward task: It's not clear to me if this would be a welcome change to Amaya behavior. 
I'd be happy to test it myself. 
But it's not clear to me how much of this generation of syntactic sugar is in Amaya, and how much is in the redland package and I should contact those authors and convince them to not use those closing tags. 
And if it's not a welcome change, I won't burn my cycles testing it.

Don't forget - they are a mandatory part of the language for XHTML. 
This would not be a welcome change. 
XML Web clients do use these closing tags, and XML was developed because it was too hard to be sure when things were supposed to close in SGML. 
Processing tools such as XSLT also rely on having the closing tags, even if not all web clients do yet. 
This is important as the web moves back to the variety of browsers and tools that it was envisioned having, and as more services and semantics increase the number of tools being used to process information on the web.

Understood: I didn't realize it's X* usages. 
I'm contacting Adobe about correcting the behavior of *their* GoLive tool.
