<s> I want to thank the DOM WG for undertaking this work.  </s>
<s> I certainly voted and lobbied for such work whenever possible, including during DOM chartering.  </s>
<s> It's great to see this happen.  </s>
<s> I know members of the DOM WG were concerned about introduction of a query language into the API, especially given the XML Query work, and I wanted to again thank them for putting their concerns aside in favour of standardization.  </s>

<s> I'm curious why the DOM has no explicit support for concurrent access?  </s>
<s> Bob Foster WebGain  </s>
<s> The DOM being really just a linked list like data structure would require wrapping everything with mutexes.  </s>
<s> The is not portable, messy, and doesn't appeal to very many people.  </s>
<s> Why would you want to concurrently access a DOM tree anyway?  </s>
<s> Mike  </s>
<s> Because :) Concurrency control would imply a certain way of working with the DOM that can't be assumed between various languages/platforms/implementations.  </s>
<s> There's no reason why you could add such support to your DOM implementation and expose it using the feature set.  </s>
<s> We do that in dbXML for database binding and DOM compression.  </s>
<s> -- Tom  </s>
<s> It's hard to define a platform-neutral, vendor-neutral, language-neutral model of concurrency control.  </s>
<s> Or at least that's what we decided in doing the initial "triage" of potential DOM requirements.  </s>
<s> It's a plausible requirement for Level 4, if such at thing is undertaken.  </s>
<s> We've looked at this several times.  </s>
<s> Last time we discussed it, the consensus seemed to be that per-operation concurrency was not particularly useful -- too much overhead for too little gain.  </s>
<s> Many logical operations on a document require an extended series of DOM operatations, so any concurrency control would really want to operate at that level.  </s>
<s> It's unclear that putting explicit transaction locking featues into the DOM would really be any easier to use or more efficient than implementing them in the application code.  </s>
<s> This question is still on our Open Issues list and may -- or may not -- be addressed in a future version of the DOM.  </s>
