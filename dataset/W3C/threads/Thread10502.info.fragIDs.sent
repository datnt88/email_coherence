<s> now has some tweaks which fix some bugs noted in recent emails.  </s>
<s> The 'se' rules (now moved into section 4 which now has all the rule stuff in one place) have been modified so that they only generate a single bnode from each URiref or literal in the original graph.  </s>
<s> This is enough for the closure lemmas and keeps them from generating all those redundant blank-node copies.  </s>
<s> The definitions of rdf and rdfs interpretations have been slightly tweaked so that the relevant vocabularies contain the rdfV and rdfsV vocabularies (previously, an rdf-interp of V was an interpretation of V+rdfV; now it is just of V, so one has to be explicit about V including the 'special' vocabulary; similarly for rdfsV).  </s>
<s> The only effect of this tweak (suggested by Dan C) is to make it possible for an rdf-interpretation to only interpret the part of the infinite container vocabulary that it actually needs; so the definitions of closure are now relativized to a vocabulary, and now refer to those axioms which contain names from that vocabulary; and the closure lemmas now refer to closures relative to the vocabulary of (S+E).  </s>
<s> I have rewritten rule rdf2 so that it replaces an XML literal by its canonical form, rather than allowing arbitrary equality substitutions.  </s>
<s> The exact wording may need massaging, but the idea seems sound.  </s>
<s> Taken together, all this enables us to completely avoid the 'infinite' cases in closures, so all closures (from finite graphs wrt a finite vocabulary) are finite, without any need of weasel-words.  </s>
<s> The weird rule rdfs12 has been further modified.  </s>
<s> The elegant version suggested by Jos unfortunately turned out to not be quite valid.  </s>
<s> This rule may still get some further tweaking but this will not change any other part of the MT.  </s>
<s> The Lbase appendix is now in line with the rest of the document; the datatyping in particular has been rationalized.  </s>
<s> Apart from getting the XML literal terminology exactly aligned with Concepts, and writing out the proofs properly, I believe this is now pretty much done.  </s>

<s> A nit re. section 4.1 -- you say:  </s>
<s> 1. Add all of the following triples *which contain a name in V*.  </s>
<s> These are true in any rdf-interpretation.  </s>
<s> Should that be more like: 1. Add all of the following triples *which contain only names in V*.  </s>
<s> These are true in any rdf-interpretation.  </s>
<s> Otherwise you'd potentially end up introducing new names into the graph that are not in V?  </s>

<s> Section 4.1 now states  </s>
<s> 1. Add all of the following triples which contain a name in V. These are true in any rdf-interpretation.  </s>
<s> rdf:nil rdf:type rdf:List .  </s>
<s> rdf:subject rdf:type rdf:Property .  </s>
<s> rdf:predicate rdf:type rdf:Property .  </s>

<s> rdf:value rdf:type rdf:Property .  </s>
<s> rdf:_1 rdf:type rdf:Property .  </s>
<s> rdf:_2 rdf:type rdf:Property .  </s>
<s> I think the phrase "which contain a name in V" is intended to eliminate the infinite set of triples for the the rdf:_nnn properties, but I suggest the wording needs tweaking.  </s>
<s> Each triple of the form: rdf:_nnn rdf:type rdf:Property contains the names rdf:type and rdf:Property which are highly likely to be in V, so it is highly likely that the infinite set will be included anyway.  </s>
<s> I could suggest alternative wording, but refrain lest Pat find it rude.  </s>

<s> You called my bluff.  </s>
<s> I'm not sure I'm competent.  </s>
<s> How about: 1. Add each of the following triples whose subject, predicate and object are all contained in V. These are true in any rdf-interpretation.  </s>
