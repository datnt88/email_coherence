8em is quite big (about an inch in the font I'm using now). 
BODY { background: url(/wrm/images/paper.gif) 
#ffe0e0; } /* abs URL cos NS is broken */ This was preceded by: BODY { background-color: #ffe0e0; color: black; font-family: "Times New Roman", serif; text-align: center; which sets the foreground colour; they were separate to allow a fall back if the URL didn't take.

The syntax is: - either body { background-image: url("ivy.gif"); 
color: white } -or body { background: url("ivy.gif"); 
color: white } Irene.
