<s> Hi, Some bugs in Win 98 Amaya 8.0 pre-realease:  </s>
<s> 1. Alt+Space crashes Amaya (stack error in Kernel32.dll)  </s>
<s> 2. Access keys as defined in Amaya help pages are in conflict with new menu access keys.  </s>
<s> For instance, Alt+n both links to the following page and opens Annotations menu.  </s>
<s> 3. Cooperation menu does not work.  </s>
<s> Should it be disabled (shown in grey color)?  </s>
<s> Other issues:  </s>
<s> 1. When inserting an image, the browse dialog for choosing the image shows several image file types (gif, jpg, png, bmp).  </s>
<s> bmp should not be shown, should it?  </s>
<s> 2. When linking an external CSS file (Style  Link), the browse dialog for choosing the CSS file shows the html fyle type as default.  </s>
<s> Can you change the default type to CSS?  </s>
<s> 3. When opening an external CSS file (Style  Open), the width of the dialog box is too short and it can not be modified.  </s>
<s> If there are several linked CSS files and their paths are long, the names can not be seen.  </s>
<s> Please, allow resizing of the dialog box (if possible) or make it larger.  </s>
<s> The same problem is present in Style  Disable or Style  Remove.  </s>
<s> Best regards, Bartolom?  </s>
<s> Sintes (http://www.mclibre.org)  </s>
<s> No crash on Win XP SP1 Home.  </s>
<s> I agree on this.  </s>
<s> Why shouldn't bmp be shown as long as it is supported.  </s>
<s> It is the author's discretion what formats are acceptable for his or her particular uses.  </s>
<s> I'd agree with this one.  </s>

<s> Fixed in CVS base.  </s>
<s> On Mon, 21 Apr 2003 22:40:07 +0200  </s>
<s> It was a problem on Win 98 only.  </s>
<s> It's fixed now.  </s>
<s> What do you propose: 1- either, we disable Windows access keys when there is the same access key in the document.  </s>
<s> 2- or, we use by default Ctrl for document access keys.  </s>
<s> It's hidden now.  </s>
<s> I'll remove it.  </s>
<s> I'll check  </s>
<s> Okay. Irene.  </s>
