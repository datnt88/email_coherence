Guys, Find below the before and after code segments using option tags, after code sweeper has been run. 
As you can see, the option text has been stripped for some reason.........is there a fix for this??

Hmmm...I cannot reproduce this. 
I cut your original HTML text from your message and pasted it into a file. 
Running the latest version of Tidy (30th April 2000) with its default options produces the correct output. 
I also succeeded with the "-indent" option. 
What version and commandline options are you using?

FYI, this bug was reported last year, and fixed in the Oct 99 release of Tidy - Marko, make sure you are using the latest version.

J Hmmm...I cannot reproduce this. 
I cut your original HTML text from your J message and pasted it into a file. 
Running the latest version of Tidy J (30th April 2000) with its default options produces the correct output. 
I J also succeeded with the "-indent" option. 
Same here. 
I tested that HTML with both 13th January 2000 and 30th April 2000 versions of Tidy, using my options file as well as the defaults. 
Parses correctly for me everytime... ~pete
