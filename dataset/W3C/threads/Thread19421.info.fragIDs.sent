Hi Mark, since there is a mailing-list dedicated to bugs reports on Amaya, I will Cc this reply. 
BTW you can read the mailing-list archive at the following URL : 
Subject: Amaya 0.8a BUGs: German umlauts always uppercase et al. Thank you for developing Amaya. 
It is great. 
The Structure View is what I have always been waiting for. 
With WYSIWIG typing in it. 
Great! 
There are, of course, a few bugs, at least I consider them to be such: - - German umlaut characters are always GENERATED in their uppercased form, although Amaya displays them right when browsing a document generated by some other editor. 
I have just tried to generate them again, and it seems to work ! 
I have generated lowercase A umlaut by doing : pressing and releasing the Alt modifier pressing and releasing the A key pressing and releasing the " (double quote) key For the capital one : pressing and releasing the Alt modifier pressing the Shift modifier pressing and releasing the A key releasing the Shift modifier pressing and releasing the " (double quote) key Could you check these sequences. 
Was the umlaut mapped to another char on your keyboard (like a diacritic) ? 
I have copied the sequences available from the X11R6 Compose file : /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/locale/iso8859-1/Compose 
- - Closing the last document closes the Application. 
I consider this a bug (it's contraintuitive). 
Sorry for this comparison, but even MS WORD is able to exist without a file to edit. 
This is a difficult point : having an external non editing small window a la Frameker was in the original design. 
We removed it but in this case all windows should be associated to one currently viewed document. 
Closing the last document in Word is not a good example, I really hate this empty space filling my desktop, I do prefer have it closed and restart the application. 
However having a small window around when all documents are closed is not perfect neither. 
It's all a matter of taste ... 
- - Sometimes the Structure View is not perfectly in sync with the WYSIWYG window. 
I was typing one char ahead. 
Waiting a few seconds did't help. 
Yes we initially decided that maintaining a strict coherency beween views was superfluous, you just need to move the cursor to another part to have the other views reflecting the new value of the text. 
Since you're not the only one to dislike the behaviour we will probably enable full coherency or add a timeout. 
BTW current CPU are so powerfull that they are iddle 95 % of the time. 
- - When typing in the WYSIWYG window, clicking e.g. the "Italics" button enters italics mode. 
OK so far. 
After typing a few italic chars one wants to change back to normal mode. 
Clicking the "Italics" button once again achieves this. 
But you can't go on typing in normal mode, because this second click also selects the italic text to become the active (highlighted) region. 
Simply typing ahead overwrites the whole (italic) region. 
Noted, the selection handling is not completely perfect, in progress ... 
- - There is no undo. 
Yes, ... 
- - The postscript files generated by printing to a file make my ghostview hang on the last page. 
strange, does it print anyway ? 
- - Edit menu: "Select all" button is missing. 
The escape key allows to select the englobing element in the structure. 
Since HTML document are often quite flat, this mean that pressing escape a few times obtain the same functionnality. 
Adding buttons is easy but if there is too many of them, it can be confusing. 
Is this one really needed ? 
- - In the file- selection box, the File- list doesn't always automatically resize on directory changes. 
Does the directory list? 
Maybe they should also have scrollbars? 
I could not reproduce this, but once I only saw the first chars of available filenames. 
The box should also allow files not ending with ".html", may add a "Filter" feature? 
Concerning resizing, well this seems to be a Motif problem :-( ! 
Ok for filter, would be nice ... 
- - A document that is a concatenation of HTML documents (i.e. that contains another HTML section after a /HTML tag) ends after the first part. 
This is probably intended, but it would be nice to be able to concatenate a number of WWW- pages into a single file without prior editing, and without losing the notion of different parts, then editing this collection and print it as one piece (with continuous and contiguous page numbering; great for manuals!). 
Also literate programming could be simpler this way. 
We have already do some experiments on breaking a big dodument in small fragments, for exemple when exporting Articles documents in Thot [1] to HTML. 
Splitting is relatively easy if your document has a structure where chunks are clearly designed. 
Problem is having a good merge functionnality. 
It needs helps from the used or a predefined groupping strategy. 
In the case of HTML designing all the pages defining for example a documentation can be tedious for the user and an inadequate auto-fetching strategy could bring you the whole Web in your document and would require a large amount of RAM :-) . 
Best whishes and kind regards, sorry, if I bothered you and there is a mailing list for bugs, 
I have Cc'ed the list, have a look at it.

DV I have just tried to generate them again, and it seems to DV work ! 
DV I have generated lowercase A umlaut by doing : DV pressing and releasing the Alt modifier pressing and DV releasing the A key pressing and releasing the " (double DV quote) key DV For the capital one : DV pressing and releasing the Alt modifier pressing the Shift DV modifier pressing and releasing the A key releasing the DV Shift modifier pressing and releasing the " (double quote) DV key DV Could you check these sequences.

I have DV copied the sequences available from the X11R6 Compose file : DV /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/locale/iso8859-1/Compose As I am german, I have a keyboard, wich has the german umlauts as normal keys on it (keys nos. 
0x30 ('?', &amp;auml;), 0x2f ('?', &amp;ouml;), 0x22 ('?', &amp;uuml;) and 0x14 ('?', &amp;szlig;). 
I use the standard ~/.Xmodmap that came with my (german) Linux Distribution, and these are the relevant portions of the output from xkeycaps: ! 
This is an `xmodmap' input file for PC 102 key keyboard #1 (Linux/XFree86 German layout) keyboards.

! 
This file makes the following changes: ! 
The "? 3 ?" 
key generates 3, paragraph, and threesuperior ! 
The "K" key generates k, K, and Arabic_kaf ! 
The "L" key generates l, L, Arabic_lam, and Greek_lamda ! 
The "Alt Gr" key generates Mode_switch, and the Mod3 modifier keycode 0x14 = ssharp question backslash keycode 0x22 = Udiaeresis keycode 0x2F = Odiaeresis keycode 0x30 = Adiaeresis keycode 0x26 = A keycode 0x3C = period colon XEmacs, eg. always worked fine for me, treating Udiaeresis like any other "normal" key (like 'A' above, wich is menitioned only uppercase), getting a "udiaeresis" when pressed without the "Shift" key, and a "Udiaeresis" when pressed with "Shift" (to be looked at with "M-x view-lossage"). 
When I changed my Xmodmap to have different entries for lower and upper (like the period / colon pair above), I could work with amaya: keycode 0x22 = udiaeresis Udiaeresis keycode 0x2F = odiaeresis Odiaeresis keycode 0x30 = adiaeresis Adiaeresis So my conclusion is that maybe amaya doesn't respect environment variables LC_CTYPE (or LC_ALL, cf. locale(7)), which I have set to iso_8859_1 (I also tried de_DE.ISO8859-1 and ISO-8859-1 (this is the one referenced in the locale(7) man- page)) and regards Udiaeresis not to be a normal character and thus takes it verbatim instead of applying case-conversion according to the "Shift" Key. from isalpha(3): isalpha() checks for an alphabetic character; it is equiva- lent to (isupper(c) || islower(c)). 
The details of what characters belong into which class depend on the current locale. 
For example, isupper() will not recognize an A - umlaut as an uppercase letter in the default C locale. 
Hope this may help you and/or others.

Make it an option -- compile-time option, X-resource (better), command-line option (better again), toggle switch in the "Views" menu (best). 
- - The postscript files generated by printing to a file make my ghostview hang on the last page. 
DV strange, does it print anyway ? 
I don't have a printer. 
I'll include a sample generated PS- file at the end of this mail. 
Funny enough, it's only that short Error message I always get when invoking amaya while not connected to the net. 
Which leads me to another Nice-If-Changed: - - - - Since amaya always needs at least one document to display (I know, 
we already had that one), there could be a nicer way to persistently define a different HOME_PAGE (site- wide and/or on a per- user basis) than editing the amaya- script or setting Emvironment- Variables (name-space-pollution): X resources and config- files like ~/.amaya. 
- - A document that is a concatenation of HTML documents (i.e. that contains another HTML section after a /HTML tag) ends after the first part. 
This is probably intended, but it would be nice to be able to concatenate a number of WWW- pages into a single file without prior editing, and without losing the notion of different parts, then editing this collection and print it as one piece (with continuous and contiguous page numbering; great for manuals!).

Ok, but I still think amaya should ignore " /HTML HTML " pairs.

Mark, Thanks for your comments. 
They are very well appreciated. 
Here's an answer to one of your points. 
The other parts of your mail will be answered later on. 
You can also specify a home page when executing Amaya from the command-line : 
amaya http://myhomepage.html 
or even 
amaya /dir/path/myhomepage.html 
You could add an alias in your environment to map the amaya command into one of the above lines. 
I agree that the best way would be to have some kind of configuration menu inside Amaya, where you could specify your profile, without having to modify any other files. 
Is this what you had in mind? 
Greetings, -Jose 
I have a problem with Amaya 2.4 on Solaris 2.6: The characters ???, ??? (a, o with ring or dots over them) are always GENERATED in their uppercased form, although Amaya displays them right when browsing a document generated by some other editor. 
It works fine with Amaya 2.4 on Linux RedHat 6.0. 
The problem seems to be the same as for Amaya 0.8a, as quoted below. 
Is there a workaround for me as a user?
