<s> Chaps, I have knocked up a very quick illustration (attached) to help me discuss the idea of overlays during today's meeting.  </s>
<s> Please try to have access to this during the meeting.  </s>
<s> RI Richard Ishida W3C  </s>
<s> looks very good.  </s>
<s> Consider making the year 2003.  </s>
<s> Should we have a glossary section within the document or perhaps another doc as glossary that we link to?  </s>
<s> Should we standardize/standardise spellings?  </s>
<s> On META statements, I think references should be to "META CONTENT-TYPE" statements not "META" statements.  </s>
<s> Saying "META" should be early as possible is meaningless...  </s>
<s> It's the charset that needs to be early.  </s>
<s> Or perhaps they should be called "CONTENT-TYPE" statements or  </s>
<s> "CONTENT-TYPE" META statements?  </s>

<s> Ah, good point  </s>
<s> Let's hold fire on this for now, since the W3C are talking about  </s>
<s> possibly having a centralised glossary.  </s>
<s> I would say another doc, in any  </s>
<s> case, if only to reduce maintenance.  </s>
<s> Yup/yep  </s>
<s> Or "Use encoding declarations as early as possible" ?  </s>
<s> Language (text/html)  </s>
<s> Encoding: quoted-printable  </s>
<s> ok /okay.  </s>
<s> Well, I think we should be specific where possible.  </s>
<s> So , yes include the general "Use encoding declarations as early as possible" to define the principle at work but we should tell them to use the META CONTENT-TYPE statement as that is the specific instruction they need to accomplish the task, with an example.  </s>

<s> how about we begin a list somewhere of terms that should be in a glossary to meet our needs?  </s>
<s> then we don't need to go back and cull the list.  </s>
<s> We don't have to attempt definitions now.  </s>

<s> As for coming up with a glossary, I have one here at Microsoft that we could maybe use as basic start.  </s>
<s> Then add and delete what we need to.  </s>
<s> Just an idea.  </s>
