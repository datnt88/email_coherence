Chaps, I have knocked up a very quick illustration (attached) to help me discuss the idea of overlays during today's meeting. 
Please try to have access to this during the meeting.

looks very good. 
Consider making the year 2003. 
Should we have a glossary section within the document or perhaps another doc as glossary that we link to? 
Should we standardize/standardise spellings? 
On META statements, I think references should be to "META CONTENT-TYPE" statements not "META" statements. 
Saying "META" should be early as possible is meaningless... 
It's the charset that needs to be early. 
Or perhaps they should be called "CONTENT-TYPE" statements or 
"CONTENT-TYPE" META statements?

Ah, good point 
Let's hold fire on this for now, since the W3C are talking about 
possibly having a centralised glossary. 
I would say another doc, in any 
case, if only to reduce maintenance. 
Yup/yep 
Or "Use encoding declarations as early as possible" ? 
Language (text/html) 
Encoding: quoted-printable 
ok /okay. 
Well, I think we should be specific where possible. 
So , yes include the general "Use encoding declarations as early as possible" to define the principle at work but we should tell them to use the META CONTENT-TYPE statement as that is the specific instruction they need to accomplish the task, with an example.

how about we begin a list somewhere of terms that should be in a glossary to meet our needs? 
then we don't need to go back and cull the list. 
We don't have to attempt definitions now.

As for coming up with a glossary, I have one here at Microsoft that we could maybe use as basic start. 
Then add and delete what we need to. 
Just an idea.
