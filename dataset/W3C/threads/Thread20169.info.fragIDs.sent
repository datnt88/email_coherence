my environment is windows 95 / amaya 2 internet connect through network ( cable modem ) on monday sep 6 our isp went down and service lights on modem off i tried to do something that is quite normal in netscape ie. start my connection, hit the stopsign and work off line accessing my own stuff on local disk......... but when i tried this with amaya -- there was no way of breaking out all i got was the hourglass and no ability to pull down any menus even help or even to size the window......... 
and of course no stopsign to click on even if the clicks worked I SEE TWO PROBLEMS HERE ... no multi-tasking and no abort download option. 
after my isp came up i searched all the menus and could not find any 'interrupt current transfer' type of option......... next time i guess i could modify ini file to point at local disk before starting program but i see this as a big hole in browser capability!! has anyone else encountered this or wanted to break a download because of net traffic conditions ...... john russell VE3LL@RAC.CA homepage: http://web.cgocable.net/~jrussel

Hello John, In our previous episode, John Russell said: 
Amaya has a Stop button feature. 
However, when trying to resolve a name (e.g., for converting www.w3.org to an IP address), we have to make a blocking system call. 
There's no way to get back the hand until that system call returns. 
I think that this is what happened to you. 
This is a known problem, not related to Amaya, and also exists under Unix. 
For all the other network tasks, we have an network-based event loop (only does something when there's some activity), and which allows for non-blocking network requests. 
There's a new GNU project for having a non-blocking name resolver call. 
It's still on an early stage (ver. 
0.01), but it looks promising and it'll solve this problem. 
Cheers, -Jose 
The Lynx browser runs the name server lookup in a sub- process, although I think this can be disabled. 
As a stopgap measure, why don't you add a timer, so that after a generous waiting a nice SIGALRM is generated and operation can happily go on? 
ciao , .mau.
