Sincerely, Young Liu Assuming you were looking at the 04 Aug 00 version of the source, then yes, this has been corrected in the current (01 Oct 01) version of Tidy.

So where can I get the lastest edition? 
Thank you.

Jean-Fran?ois Jouvin IXIASOFT Sure, from the homepage (below), follow the link to the SourceForge project page and look for info on pulling from CVS. Anonymous checkouts are OK. Give us a holler if that is unfamiliar to you.
