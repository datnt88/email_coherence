When creating a rule for the body, Amaya only picks up the color and background color properties. 
It should also generate rules for the pseudo-elements :link, :visited, etc. 
Where abouts in the code does this happen??

You're prbably right, bu how do you want to generate that rules? 
When you selected an anchor? 
Prbably in Amaya/amaya/EDITstyle.h

It should create it as part odf a create rule for the body element - it is a special nasty hack, because HTML 3.2 had so many atttributes on the body.
