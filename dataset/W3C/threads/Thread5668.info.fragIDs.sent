<s> The RDFCore WG have asked me to send this comment on their behalf, as an addition to others already sent.  </s>
<s> Brian owlref-rdfcore-relationship-to-RDF RDFCore are concerned about the clarity in the OWL specifications of what RDF is legal OWL DL and OWL lite.  </s>
<s> This seems to be described only in S+AS which is a highly technical document and is likely to be inaccessible to many.  </s>
<s> On reviewing the reference document some significant restrictions were not apparent to the RDFCore reviewer.  </s>
<s> We cannot be confident, therefore, that other restrictions we would care about, have not been missed.  </s>
<s> RDFCore requests that the specifications be amended to include a description of necessary conditions for a RDF document to be in OWL DL and OWL Lite.  </s>
<s> This description should be as accurate as possible consistent  </s>
<s> with a goal of it being comprehensible to a majority of the community.  </s>
<s> Such a description may bring to light further issues.  </s>
<s> Brian - thank you for your comment - we will consider this.  </s>
<s> Uf the RDFCore WG could suggest some specific wordings they'd like to see, or give us more guidance than the above, it would help us, and would make it less likely that this would become an issue that could hold up moving both of our recommendations forward as we work out the  </s>

<s> Err, I'm not sure how we can help here.  </s>
<s> Owl has defined subsets of RDF that Owl Lite and Owl DL operate on.  </s>
<s> I don't see how we can tell what those subsets are, since the point of this comment is that they are not adequately documented.  </s>

<s> After some offlist discussion with JimH about this comment, I'd like to emphasize that it concerns an "RDF Document" which was intended to mean primarily RDF instance data, though with hindsight might also apply to an RDFS schema.  </s>
<s> So the request is for some simple rules that, if followed, will ensure that an RDF document containing instance data (not an ontology) can be processed by an Owl DL reasoner, presumably in conjunction with an Owl DL ontology.  </s>
<s> This comment was generated when it was discovered that there is a restriction on the use of b-nodes, that had not been immediately apparent.  </s>
<s> A rule such as "Don't use rdf:nodeID", for example, might be appropriate.  </s>
<s> I am sending this personal clarification of the comment without consulting RDFCore, but am BCC'ing RDFCore so that folks there have the opportunity to review it.  </s>
