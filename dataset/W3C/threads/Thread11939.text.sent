Either day/time is open for me. 
- Mike In order to have a more intensive discussion of the tasks and timelines I would like to propose a conference call with working group members. 
This would be conducted through the MIT bridge. 
The proposed dates are Mar 2 from 3 to 4 or Mar 3 from 4 to 5. How many members are available at these times? 
I will follow up with an agenda for the call. 
Could group members also post a short introductory paragraph (your background, your areas of interest and expertise) to the list prior to those dates. 
Thanks Jutta What time zone are those times in? 
If Eastern time, I'm available either day currently, although that is subject to change. 
Thanks!

Thanks Jutta I am available for both (or any) of the conference calls mentioned. 
As to background: I am the "dean" of this stuff since I've been feeding at the blindness trough for over 30 years. 
My areas of interest are tightly focused on trying to see to it that the fiasco the introduction of the GUI signaled (loss of jobs, panic among blind computer users, and incredibly tedious retrofitting) doesn't get duplicated in the WWW. 
I don't think I have any expertise but I have a lot of experience. 
Love. 
ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE I have spent the last few years working with Jutta at the ATRC. 
Most of my work has involved HTML and UI accessibility. 
I was also involved in the design work for SoftQuad's Hotmetal 4.0.

For a list of our listserves send "lists" to listproc@tracecenter.org The following is a proposed agenda for our conference call on Monday. 
Please e-mail me any additions or revisions. 
As a reminder the conference call is at 3pm EST, Monday March 2nd. 
The telephone number is: 617-258-7910. 
I have also included notes as background to the agenda items. 
I would recommend that everyone read the notes and the Page Author Guidelines at: Agenda 1. Brief Introductions 2. Very brief review of charter (http://www.w3.org/WAI/group/AU/charter.txt) 3. WWW7 meeting 4. Author supports (see below) 5. Recommendation structure (see below) 6. Ranking priority (see below) 7. Default alt-text (see below) 8. Distribute tasks 9. Schedule next conference call. 
As we have discussed, our first task is to review the Page Author Guidelines and determine how each of the recommendations can be supported in an authoring tool. 
I propose that we consider the following supports for each recommendation: a) Help File: There should be information provided related to the recommendation in either context sensitive or general help files and in the documentation. 
One of our tasks is to author example text which can be used by an authoring tool developer. 
b) Prompt: This implies that dialogue boxes include text and input fields which prompt the author to follow the recommendation. 
An example would be: when importing an image there would be text and a text field which would prompt the author to provide alt-text for the image c) Warning: This would be a pop up warning. 
Using the same example this would appear if the image was inserted without alt-text. 
Ideally there should also be a quick way to fix the problem, e.g. a fix button which takes you to a "correcting tool" with the image and a text field to fill in. 
d) Checker: This refers to the verification tool or checker utility which may also check for compliance to HTML specifications. 
We need to determine which recommendations can be verified in such a utility. 
We may also want to make recommendations regarding utilities which would make it easy to fix the problems detected. 
e) Tool or Wizard: This refers to a utility or tool which automates some part of the recommendations, for the author. 
Examples include: a server-side to client-side image map converter, a long-desc editor or a utility to create a parallel text only site. 
During the conference call I would like to get consensus on the types of supports and begin discussing several of the recommendations to see if the structure works. 
Thus we would come up with a list similar to the following example for each of the recommendations: 2. Images and image maps 2.1. 
Provide alternative text for all images and image maps 2.1.1 Images a) Related help file text: "Alternate text provides a textual description which is displayed in place of the image by text-based browsers and graphical browsers whose image loading has been disabled. 
ALT text is particularly important to users who are blind, who use screen reading programs that are unable to interpret images of any kind, including pictures of words. 
Since the ALT text is displayed independently from the image, the description must be adequate enough to keep the user informed. 
For example: if the button's image depicts a mailbox icon and the function of the icon is to submit a form, the corresponding ALT text might be "Submit the form." 
b) Prompt: include a prompt and guidelines in any dialog that is used to insert images c) Warning: a pop-up warning should appear whenever an image has been inserted without alt-text with a quick link back to a correction tool. 
d) Checker: This recommendation can be checked e) Tool or Wizard: When an image is moved its alt text should follow. 
A utility which displays all images with a corresponding text field to fill in the missing alt text may prove helpful. 
We also need to talk about a system of ranking our recommendations, whether we rank them as required vs. recommended or whether we institute some sort of grading scheme for authoring tool compliance to our recommendations. 
If we have time I would like to discuss an issue which has come up about default alt-text. 
The question we have been posed is: under what conditions is it good for the authoring tool to provide default alt-text. 
For example if a graph is inserted should the authoring tool automatically insert graph into the alt-text. 
Is it better to know there is a graph there than not to know, even if you don't know what the graph is about. 
Will this set a convention which causes authors to simply fill in the word graph when creating alt-text. 
Should there be some way to distinguish default alt-txt from real alt text? 
Lastly, you may wish to read a commentary on the problems we are trying to address by Jan Richards of the ATRC at: Look forward to talking to you on Monday.
