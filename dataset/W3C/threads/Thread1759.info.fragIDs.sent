<s> This is one of the reasons that baselines should be used instead of labels, whenever possible (baselines are identified by URL's, not text strings, so they have none of these problems).  </s>
<s> As I recall, the "octet-by-octet" phrasing was written with the label header in mind, but I agree that this phrasing doesn't work so well with XML.  </s>
<s> Perhaps some of the folks that care about labels could comment here?  </s>

<s> Geoff, 1) yes, it has caused interoperability problems, because the convention to "UTF-8 encode first, then URL-encode" of URIs is relatively new.  </s>
<s> For instance, some Microsoft client implementations use ISO8859-1 encoding, which causes the client to fail if the server only supports UTF-8 (like it  </s>
<s> should). 2) however, the main difference is that a URI *always* is encoded -- there is no such think like a URI containing non-ASCII characters (so the problems I have with LABEL do not apply here -- actually, I'm proposing to use the same format used for the URI).  </s>
