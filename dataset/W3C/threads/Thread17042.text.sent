Hi, Is it possible to use the W3c HTML validator on a site that requires a password? 
e.g. the Blackboard Website that I am currently looking at. 
If not, is there a way to validate the HTML - other than just looking at it and deciding whether it looks valid or not?

Just save the page to your local drive, and then upload it via Hope this helps, J Jason, I have tried that - but it doesn't seem too easy to save a site that is made up of frames and then load it locally. 
If I am missing something simple here - or seems to work ok for you get back in touch.

Scottish Disability Information Mailing list: As far as I know the validator doesn't work on password protected sites. 
But there is a maling list www-validator with archives at information like this if it is not in the validator page. 
There are also a number of validators thhat you can download - iCab has a built-in validator for HTML 4, and various editing software does too.

However, I think you would be pushing the limits of the "fair use" doctrine in copyright law. 
You can view source, copy the source and submit it to Be there, done that with Blackboard 5.0. 
The validator didn't like the HTML there at all. 
Blackboard 5.5+ may be better though.

(While this is not a technically valid URL, it is accepted by the WDG HTML Validator for convenience.) Chris Chris Croome chris@webarchitects.co.uk web design http://www.webarchitects.co.uk/ web content management http://mkdoc.com/
