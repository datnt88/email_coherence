Hi, I'm doing some standards work which needs to specify links to various resources, ranging from email addresses and websites to postal addresses and telephone numbers. 
It seems to me that using URIs for all of these should be possible and I've found RFCs for most of what I need apart from the following, so I was wondering if anyone can provide any further information on these: GSM Short Messaging Service I've found a draft proposal at doesn't seem to have got any further. 
I was also considering the possibility of encoding body content in the SMS URL as used in the mailto scheme (e.g. sms:+44777123456?body=Some%20text. 
) Postal addresses I found a discussion on this mailing list from March 2001 containing a proposal from Sean B. Palmer and I was wondering if this was taken any further. 
Thanks for your help, Tristan Tristan Ferne (tristan.ferne@rd.bbc.co.uk) BBC Research &amp; Development, Kingswood Warren I would steer clear of specifying the body because it might be interpreted to mean that resolving that identifier should send the message. 
Identifiers should identify, not take action. 
Also, in the work we do at my company, we've found the HTTP URI scheme quite appropriate for identifying SMS end points. 
For example, where HTTP POST can be used to send messages to that subscriber.

But your use of HTTP URLs requires one to go through the carrier's site in order to send the message -- precluding the ability for third party Internet-to-Wireless/SMS agencies, possibly even a private, company or person specific server for relaying SMS messages to/from the internet. 
This is one of the shortcomings of HTTP URLs as "do-everything" URIs. 
One is not able to separate the identity of the resource itself from the agency expected to resolve that resource.

Cheers, Patrick I haven't done anything about the scheme since 2001-03, since I didn't really have a use for it myself. 
The problem is, using a set (or "constellation" as Sandro likes to call it) of unambiguous properties in RDF is a very attractive alternative. 
The utility of creating a new URI scheme, and making them FCOs, is if these objects should be easily addressable anywhere. 
Of course, you're free to do what you want with the scheme - take it on to registration if you have a use for it.

Try RFC 3191 combined with RFC 2368 was a companion to RFC 2806 ("URLs for Telephone Calls") that looks like it expired.
