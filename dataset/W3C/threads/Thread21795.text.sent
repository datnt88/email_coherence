I plan to execute on the items on the edtodo tomorrow. 
There are only two items that I know of: 1.Copy back the PR docs into the edcopy space 2.Incorporate resolution of 428 ( adding soap:Header/ ) If anyone is aware of any other items related to Parts 1 and 2 please shout LOUDLY now. 
Cheers Gudge Gudge, it's all been done yesterday morning... ;-) JJ. LOL. 
Ah, well, I guess I should remember to pay attention to the background colour of the edtodo. 
Thanks for saving me the job!
