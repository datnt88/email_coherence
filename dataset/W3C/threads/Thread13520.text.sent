Hi all Would it be OK if I called in to discuss the point below? 
4. Implementations DOM test suite Thanks, /Dimitris Sorry, forgot to mention that I'd be doing that as the DOM WG representative to the DOM TestSuite framework, a possible connection with which has been discussed on this list. 
Please reply by direct mail as I'm not a subscriber to this list. 
Thanks /Dimitris sure OK, I'll be calling in after half an hour so that you can speak about your first agenda items first. 
Best, /Dimitris
