I have a script which selects a file and send it to the user. 
It is accessed via a form, with action POST. 
Unfortunately, the file is sent with the form's name as default name, and the user should rename it by hand. 
Does HTTP/1.0 have any header line which can be used to overcome it? 
Try sending Content-type: application/octet-stream HTTP header fields in the response of your script. 
This at least works with Netscape Navigator since version 2.0 Although not specified in the HTTP 1.0/1.1 drafts the the definition of Content-Disposition: can be found in michael ** Michael Naumann * ESO * mnaumann@eso.org 
** http://www.eso.org/~mnaumann/ ------- End of forwarded message ------- Im alredy using it in some HTTP bulk transfer applications, and it certainly seems to work. the inline/attachment distinction is a bit meaningless, but it's a nice standard way to send filename and other info. 
Im not on http-wg, so please CC me if there's any new params proposed or the like that would make it HTTP-friendly. 
Ive been hideously delinquent in cutting the next version of the RFC; Ill get off my posterior now. 
-Rens As a MIME entity-header, I already consider it to be in HTTP. 
The same goes for content-description (a.k.a. 
Title). 
The real question is whether (or how) it should be described within the next HTTP spec. 
I think it falls into the "damned if we do; damned if we don't" category. 
;) .....Roy Roy T. Fielding: That means it would fit perfectly into appendix 19.6.2 (Additional Header Field Definitions). 
Putting it into 19.6.2 seems like a good way to record current practice.
