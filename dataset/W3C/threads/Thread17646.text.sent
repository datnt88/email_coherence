Jon, Per an action item from both the last DOM working group meeting and the last WAI-PF meeting I am drafting a set of guidelines for loading an assistive technology in the user agent and an API that can be implemented by user agents to provide access to the DOM and all its window components. 
We (WAI-PF) hope to develop and Accessible Object Model framework capable of supporting XML based protocols and applications. 
Our goal is to have a cohesive design and strategy to enable. 
Requirement areas will cover: - Mechanism for loading assistive technologies - Web Accessibility API specification to cover user agents and their DOM - Mechanism for maping accessible XML schemas to DOM elements - Accessible XML schema for providing semantics (Critical for submittals like SVG) This draft is not available for review yet, but it may be might be good to make sure that we have a level set by adding a discussion of this to the agenda.

Thats great Rich, But I want the discussion on Wednesday to be limited to what we can say right now with current technologies and specificatipons in the UA guidelines. 
Your knowledge and understanding of the current stengths and limitations will be a big help in helping us determine what we can say to developers at this instint in time. 
As PF develops new specifications and new technologies become available the User Agent techniques document can reflect these changes. 
That said we would need to have your proposal posted at least 24 hours before to give people a chance to review it prior to the meeting to discuss it. 
Would that be possible?

Jon, I don't thin my proposal will be done for the meeting. 
I expect it to be rather large and comprehensive, but when it is complete we can certainly provide it for review 24 hours prior. 
I would also want to run it through PF first. 
Does WAI-UA review early drafts in development? 
I would like to know the state of what is lacking in the current level of the DOM. 
It is also valuable to find out what is missing in current DOM implementation(s).

The thread that was begun by Jon about information that needs to be exchanged between user agents and assistive technology covers a lot of this ground.
