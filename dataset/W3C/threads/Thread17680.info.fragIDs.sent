<s> Hello, In the Web Content WG, we are working on an "impact matrix" [1] for the Guidelines.  </s>
<s> The impact matrix lists each checkpoint and the disability groups the checkpoint is designed to help.  </s>
<s> It also lists input and output devices/software affected by the checkpoint.  </s>
<s> The GL matrix is in its early stages and will undoubtedly be evolving a lot.  </s>
<s> Nonetheless, I think we should use it as a model for doing a similar study for the UAGL.  </s>

<s> aloha, ian! a minor navigational comment -- although the linear presentation is listed in the Table of Contents for the Guidelines Impact Matrix, it would be of great utility if there were a link to the "List Presentation" underneath the "Tabular  </s>
