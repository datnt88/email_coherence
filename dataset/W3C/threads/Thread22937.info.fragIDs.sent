<s> The Views module doesn't seem to have very much in it.  </s>
<s> Is it about: + discovering what views are in use?  </s>
<s> + discovering what the default view is?  </s>
<s> + discovering what document is associated with a view?  </s>
<s> I would really like to see in the DOM - a special case view that involves having another document as a view of the first - both statically and dynamically.  </s>
<s> As a static view, it'll probably just be a transformation from document A to document B according to some rule.  </s>
<s> As a dynamic view - document B would be able to see document A and mutate itself according to a set of rules whenever document A mutates.  </s>
<s> Much like the observer/subject pattern.  </s>
<s> (I am just so obsessed with that pattern) Ideally I would have it event driven based on Mutation Events.  </s>
<s> Thanks -John  </s>
<s> Not yet, although that would be useful.  </s>
<s> The default view is currently the only one accessible, but the design is such that hopefully all that would be missing is the discovery mechanism (of course this would not apply much to implementations that only support a single view).  </s>
<s> No.  </s>
<s> I understand the desire for this.  </s>
<s> Connecting 1 DOM to another shouldn't be much different from connecting a more-conventional presentation to a DOM.  </s>
<s> Thus far, the views/formatting module mainly address how to map between physical parts of a conventional view (especially, but not limited to visual) and the content being presented.  </s>
<s> Events on the view have not been fleshed out yet, nor committed for level 3.  </s>
<s> You already have a specification for mutation events on the DOM document hierarchy that could probably be used to drive an arbitrary presentation of that document.  </s>
<s> Other things being considered in level 3 core that might make this easier: 1.  </s>
<s> A unique ID on each node which makes it easier to associate presentational data or other additional data with DOM nodes.  </s>
<s> 2. Grouping of event targets so that, for example, the reception of the mutation events by a particular presentation is not inadvertantly cancelled or altered by other presentations or recipients of the events.  </s>

<s> DOM Level 2 Views is a placeholder for DOM Level 3 views, included only because we needed to design a "hook" for a view into one of the other modules to allow this future expansion.  </s>
<s> The DOM Level 3 Working Drafts will describe Views in greater detail.  </s>
