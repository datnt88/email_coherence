<s> Here is a question arising from the interoperability test.  </s>
<s> If a server receives a byte range requests for a 100 byte file like a) Range: bytes = 0-10, 130-140 or b) Range: bytes = 30-20 or c) Range: bytes = 0-10, 30-20, 40-50 what is the correct response?  </s>
<s> In case a) one of the two ranges is invalid, but the spec says send a 416 only if *all* are invalid.  </s>
<s> If the valid ones are returned with a 206 then there is no way to signal an error.  </s>
<s> In case b) the spec says If the last-byte-pos value is present, it must be greater than or equal to the first-byte-pos in that byte-range-spec, or the byte-range-spec is invalid.  </s>
<s> The recipient of an invalid byte-range-spec must ignore it.  </s>

<s> What is the purpos of this?  </s>
<s> BUT 10.4.17 says about status 416: When this status code is returned for a byte-range request, the response MUST include a Content-Range entity-header field specifying the current length of the selected resource (see section 14.17).  </s>
<s> I don't think '*' specifies the length.  </s>
<s> On the other hand I see no way to make a Content-Range header which would be legal and would specify the length.  </s>

<s> (But, unlike the last time, maybe someone should else review what I wrote?) (1) The BNF in 14.17 should be: Content-Range = "Content-Range" ":" content-range-spec content-range-spec = byte-content-range-spec byte-content-range-spec = bytes-unit SP byte-range-resp-spec "/" ( entity-length | "*" ) byte-range-resp-spec = (first-byte-pos "-" last-byte-pos) entity-length = 1*DIGIT (2) The following four paragraphs should read: The asterisk "*" character in an entity-length means that the entity-length is unknown at the time when the response was generated.  </s>
<s> Unlike byte-ranges-specifier values, a byte--range-resp-spec may only specify one range, and must contain absolute byte positions for both the first and last byte of the range.  </s>

<s> The fact that the client made such an unsatisfiable request might not be the result of a coding bug; it might just be because the client's information about the resource's current length is either out-of-date or "optimistic".  </s>
<s> Note that some of this terminology already appears in section 14.17, but it isn't used consistently in the entire document.  </s>
<s> The philosophy behind the entire byte-range design is that requests that have "syntactically invalid" byte-range-specs should be treated as buggy, and the server should simply ignore the Range header and treat the request just as it would have treated a regular GET without the buggy Range.  </s>
<s> However, when a request contains a Range header which is syntactically valid, the server should provide as much as it can to the client, consistent with the request.  </s>
<s> That means that if any of the byte-range-specs are even partially satisfiable, then the server should send a 206 (Partial content) response; if none of the byte-range-specs are satisfiable, then the server should return a 416 response.  </s>
<s> This is basically an application of the Robustness Principle ("be conservative in what you send, be liberal in what you accept").  </s>
<s> However, I have a problem with section 10.4.17, 416 Requested range not found.  </s>
<s> The helpful hint, "(For byte-ranges, this means that the first-byte-pos of all of the byte-range-spec values were greater than the current length of the selected resource.)" is incorrect.  </s>
<s> The byte-range-spec "30-20" (as in (b) above) is invalid, but the first-byte-pos is valid.  </s>
<s> I think the "helpful hint" is accurate if you treat 416 as meaning "Requested range not satisfiable" rather than "Requested range not valid".  </s>
<s> (1) Section 10.4.17 416 "Requested range not valid" should be retitled "Requested range not satisfiable", and in section 6.1.1, the BNF for Status-Code should be changed from  </s>

<s> "416" ; Requested range not satisfiable  </s>
<s> This name change should also be applied at three places in section 14.17 where this status code is mentioned.  </s>

<s> (3) Also in section 14.36.1 Byte Ranges, before the paragraph that starts "Examples of byte-ranges-specifier values ...", insert this paragraph: If a syntactically valid byte-range-set includes at least one byte-range-spec whose first-byte-pos is less than the current length of the entity-body, or at least one suffix-byte-range-spec with a non-zero suffix-length, then the byte-range-set is satisfiable.  </s>

<s> -Jeff  </s>
<s> That's much clearer.  </s>
<s> But I think it's backward.  </s>
<s> I think 416 should mean the request (and therefore the client) is buggy.  </s>
<s> And if none of the ranges are satisfiable, return everything (pretend there's no Range header).  </s>
<s> I think it's a little strange to return an error if the Range header was well-formed and ignore Range if it's ill-formed.  </s>
<s> Dave Kristol  </s>
<s> I also think this clears up the meaning.  </s>
<s> Thanks.  </s>
<s> But I would like to see 416 returned if the request is either syntactically incorrect or unsatisfiable.  </s>
<s> I agree with Dave that it is strange to ignore a syntactically incorrect header.  </s>
<s> It is unlikely to be helpful to the (buggy) client.  </s>
<s> Indeed, to the user it might well look like the server is buggy.  </s>
<s> I much prefer for the server to announce definitively, "Hey, your client screwed up!"  </s>
<s> But it also makes sense to communicate the correct length of the resource when the client has somehow misjudged it.  </s>
<s> So an error message for an unsatisfiable request is a good idea.  </s>

<s> but it's not clear if the examples above are "could not be understood" by a server.  </s>

<s> So, based as before on the Robustness Principle, and especially given the general lack of definitive statements about this kind of problem in the HTTP/1.1 spec, that we're better off with servers ignoring malformed non-mandatory headers, rather than sending status-400 responses.  </s>
<s> And I certainly think it's a mistake to use the same response code to mean both "your code is buggy" and "your code is fine, but your cache is out of date".  </s>
<s> The latter implies that the client might take some automated action to recover; the former implies that the client should probably not try to do an automatic recovery.  </s>
<s> -Jeff  </s>
<s> That gets to my point, which John Franks didn't quite get right.  </s>
<s> My remark was, Why send a 416 in response to a well-formed header (whose byte-range-spec is unsatisfiable), but respond with 200 to a malformed header?  </s>
<s> Why the distinction, in other words?  </s>
<s> The Robustness Principle would argue against the 416 response, too, wouldn't it?  </s>
<s> Surely the Content-Length or equivalent would be enough to clue the recipient that the byte-range-spec was unsatisfiable.  </s>

<s> Not quite.  </s>
<s> Content-Length is defined (section 14.14) this way: The Content-Length entity-header field indicates the size of the message-body, in decimal number of octets, sent to the recipient or, in the case of the HEAD method, the size of the entity-body that would have been sent had the request been a GET.  </s>
<s> For a GET request with an unsatisfiable Range request-header, the message-body is clearly NOT going to have the same length as the "full entity-body", and so we needed a different mechanism.  </s>
<s> I suppose we could have used a 206 response with this kind of thing: Content-Range: */200 but it was feared that this would break already-deployed implementations that "knew" how to parse a 206 response.  </s>
<s> Maybe this fear was groundless.  </s>
<s> -Jeff P.S.: In case anyone wishes to point out that the term "full entity-body" in 14.17 is confusing: I agree.  </s>
<s> 18 months ago, the HTTP editors group had a long argument over how to define the meaning of the word "entity"; I was on the losing side.  </s>
<s> We ended up with no term defined to mean "the content that would be returned right now with a status-200 response for the request".  </s>
<s> Don't complain to me.  </s>
