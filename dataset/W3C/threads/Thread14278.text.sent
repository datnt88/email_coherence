[I am sending this separately to GL and to UA - Al] Two ideas: 1. 
I am concerned that too much attention is being focused on icons or symbols, graphical mnemonics for items or atoms. 
The real genius of the graphic plane is its ability to display multiplayer situations: constellations of items or atoms. 
In terms of our ability to understand graphic language that non-readers can comprehend, we need to be looking at the relational cues that show how the depicted items relate to one another. 
For example, the navigation frame, whether top right left or bottom, is always immediately within the border of the total frameset rectangle. 
It is there to provide contextualization glue; so it is placed topologically between the environment of the browse window and the specific content that defines the logical "here." 2. I was struck by the idea that scrollbars can be an insurmountable cognitive hurdle. 
Of course when they were new there was a lot of flapping caused by the confusion factor that when the control moves up, the controlled stuff moves down. 
Nowadays we don't give it a second thought. 
But that is just because is is part of our culture; the stuff we do by reflex and forget we ever had to learn. 
But there are people for whom this molehill is a mountain and rather than a speed bump, it is an impassable barrier. 
In terms of a fix, I think that maybe the UI for the nonreader should borrow from the art tool conventions. 
This is the cursor pallette. 
The user overtly goes to an agent selection pallette, picks what kind of operations they want to have associated with the cursor, and then moves the cursor through the displayed view to associate the tool/role that the cursor has picked up to objects in the scene to operate on them. 
For example, a 'speak' tool for controlling the voicing of text. 
This to me is how to apply graphics to make the interaction processes comprehensible. 
Use the move-it hand rather than scroll bars to reposition the viewframe. 
Just as with adaptation for the single-switch user, we are here dealing with the styling of user command input and its integration with the display channel, and client-side profiling of that styling from a profile-generic articulation of what is there that can be done. 
Al I think your suggestions are OK. 
In particular W3C needs a graphics department now. 
It is a hugely ambitious project, but if WAI doesn't start it will be left behind. 
For all some members comments the age of graphics is upon us. 
Italo Calvino wrote "The millenium which is about to end has been the millenium of the novel"b It is very important to be able to customise an interface, and that, on opening a new package, only the minimum essentials are displayed. 
The lead in to a new product is usually horrendous, as we all have experienced. 
Golive4 is particularly difficult, it tries to be everything, but has not organised its 'professions' yet. 
Painter Classic has only one use but far too many tools to start with. 
Your point about the relation of tools/graphics is well made. 
msPaint is a simple tool but it has no (poor) relation to other tools ie gif, jpeg. 
Linux has great promise in this area, as by keeping source open it in theory only allows better scaling, ie barrier crossing. 
scrollbars are hell, someone wrote they took us back about 2000 years, ie to papyrus. 
Physically and cognitively disabled have a problem. 
And the content is not it. 
W3C members need to understand that for a large percentage a small thing is blocking access.

I completely agree with your statement 1 concerning the relation of graphics in a picture being of greater significance than the icons of which it is built. 
Giotto is said to be one of the first to illustrate this point successfully in a fresco in the Arena chapel at Padua (1305-8). 
Two methods are tried. 
Text is used to support individual icons, alternatively an allegorical picture is used. 
Both systems work. 
One of my present concerns is how (narrative) turning points are structured on the www. 
Anyone got any ideas?
