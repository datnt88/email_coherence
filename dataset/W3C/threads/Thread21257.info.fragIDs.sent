<s> Hello there, I have changed my email address from Laurent.Denoue@univ-savoie.fr to denoue@pal.xerox.com  </s>
<s> I have some feedback for Annotea:  </s>
<s> - I don't like to login and type my password each time I create or look at annotations: could you set up a mode where there is no need for password and where my login is read from cookies?  </s>
<s> - I don't like to have to click on the annotations in the "Select" checkbox in order to see the annotations.  </s>
<s> - I love the name Annotea !  </s>
<s> Laurent.  </s>
<s> Hmmm - the user and password should be stored in cookies so you should only have to enter them once for every browser session.  </s>
<s> What browser and version are you using?  </s>
<s> Have you turned off cookies?  </s>
<s> Yeah, I also thought about doing it that way and perhaps an option button is the right way to go.  </s>
<s> I decided to make it two step process for a few reasons.  </s>
<s> First, the Annotea protocol is such that you can't get all of the data with a single GET.  </s>
<s> First, the client sends the URI of interest to the server and it sends back a document which contains a list of all of the URI's annotations.  </s>
<s> Then a second GET is done to get the actual annotation since each annotation is stored as a separate document.  </s>
<s> Second, I didn't want to take the hit of preloading every annotation since I think the list is itself useful.  </s>
<s> I was concerned about how long it would take if a document had lots of annotations but perhaps some buffering could be done.  </s>
<s> Art  </s>
<s> Even without preloading the annotations, would it be possible to make a shortcut for the most common operation (view).  </s>
<s> That way, you could just click on the title to go right to the content of the annotation instead of having to select the radio button, search for the correct submission button, etc. Thanks.  </s>

<s> Thanks for feedback!  </s>
<s> That is what we need.  </s>
<s> I think a shortcut is a good idea too.  </s>
<s> This is an experiment to see how easy it is to get the annotations visible also with other clients than Amaya.  </s>
<s> We encouraged Art to make it public early on so there is a lot that can be done to improve the user interface and some restrictions too because of the approach.  </s>
