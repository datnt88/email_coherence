from yesterday's Guardian (Sight Aid): we hope that http://www.peepo.com 
might be the first accessible web portal that they list. 
however as many of the sites we link to are not accessible to their users, this may not be appropriate. 
Accessible portal designers eat concrete for breakfast :-) Jonathan You missed the irony alert: blue text on a blue background both top-right and top-left, and a classic case of presentational markup without structure (there's not even a Heading). 
Redeemed by simplicity, insofar as it might as well be plain text. 
Hmmm, too subtle for me, I'm afraid. 
Nick Kew Nick. 
top right and left are images, they are blue text, but on a light fawn (complementary?) background, where is the light blue? 
I'll forward your comments regarding use of 'Heading' as that is a help. 
thanks Jonathan FYI: creating an accessible portal can be a problem, and if one limits oneself to only linking to accessible websites it could become a headache. 
Similar then to eating concrete for breakfast, constipating. 
Of course, it does depend on the audience, W3C doesn't have a problem. 
We try to have fun at http://www.peepo.com, and do! 
Light fawn? 
Only if (I presume) you load images. 
Both of them are links, and I had to faff around to ascertain that they weren't something I wanted to follow. 
Comment applies to any site, but this one sets out to be explicitly for the visually impaired! 
We've already got their published address in a Cc: Nick Kew Nick, I seem to be missing something here: The Alt-content font size on my system XP-IE is very small when images are turned off, how does one make this bigger? 
On my system it seems to be about half the size of the font used for most of the W3.org homepage. 
Alternatively say on mozilla, or mac IE mozilla safari or other? 
In IE the tooltip font is configurable, but does not popup from the keyboard, this has been requested more than once. 
Should the browser offer the option to automatically provide a complement to the background for alt text? 
or are you suggesting that a dark background is never to be used? 
thanks Jonathan
