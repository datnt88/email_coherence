I raised this issue in Peterborough and took an action item to clarify what I meant by email. 
The current document has 5 sections: A Modality Independence. 
B Output Display Independence. 
C Control Device Independence. 
D Meta-information. 
E General Recommendations. 
I think it's too complex and it's hard to understand what modality vs output vs control device means, compared to say, meta-information (it's all meta data at some level...). 
For instance, how does "graceful degradation" (C.1) relates to "C. 
Control Device Independence." ? 
Or, why aren't "grouping selection in form" and "using list for list" not in the same section ? 
why aren't "title for frame" and "alt for imagemap" not together (they both allow for building a serialized version of an otherwise 2-D graphical presentation) ? 
I think we should aim for 2 or 3 sections: A Descriptive information B Structure/Navigation Under "Descriptive information", I would put - image alt, longdesc, video caption, audio transcipt, frame title, abbrev, acronym, alt script/applet All the things one has to add (i.e. attach) to pieces of data in the document. 
Under "Structure/Navigation" - separation content/style, lang, nesting, keyaccess, form grouping, table markup, link phrase, color scheme Thinds are that are more intrinsic to the document "fiber". 
A third possible section would be like section E today: "General guidelines" - comply to standard HTML/CSS - if all fail, use text-only page although this could be folded in the intro (for HTML/CSS) and the conclucion (for text-only) I think this would greatly simplify the understanding of the guidelines. 
I think the division and what to put in each is OK, but I don't like the term "Descriptive information". 
This is because e.g., alt text doesn't describe the image but replaces its function. 
Also information is too general, structure is also information. 
Maybe media-independent content or "HTMLization of all content" may be better titles for A. 
How "Textual equivalent" ? 
I agree that the current sectioning may be improved. 
It is quite difficult to tell from te titles of the sections what they are about. 
Daniel Dardailler suggested: A Descriptive information B Structure/Navigation I think the division and what to put in each is OK, but I don't like the term "Descriptive information". 
This is because e.g., alt text doesn't describe the image but replaces its function. 
Also information is too general, structure is also information. 
Maybe media-independent content or "HTMLization of all content" may be better titles for A. All media understand HTML, but for any other technology there is some media/configuration where it doesn't show. 
E.g, images are not always displayed so you need to hard code in the HTML itself the function of the image. 
The distinction between content and structure is that structure is more global and has to do with the organization of content and thus with navigation. 
(like with meta information, the distinction is not perfect, but I think we are getting to something clearer than before.) 
I am quite happy with Structure/navigation as a title for B. Nir Dagan Assistant Professor of Economics Universitat Pompeu Fabra Barcelona (Spain) 
Daniel said: How [about] "Textual equivalent" ? 
Nir: Very good. 
It doesn't use invalid English "HTMLization" I would try to keep the Hyper in, maybe Hyper-textual equivalent. 
But then its not English, I am afraid. 
So we'll have to settle for textual in the title, and explain the hyper in the prose.

Nir, English is the way it is writ, so hyper-textual could be acceptable. 
(There is something funny about having a Frenchman and a Spaniard working out how to put stuff in plain English) More to the point, Daniel's suggestions sound very sensible to me. 
'Degrading Gracefully' seems to be what Daniel's section A covers. 
And I think a section C 'General Guidelines' or an introduction is a good idea, again as per Daniel's suggestion.
