<s> I raised this issue in Peterborough and took an action item to clarify what I meant by email.  </s>
<s> The current document has 5 sections: A Modality Independence.  </s>
<s> B Output Display Independence.  </s>
<s> C Control Device Independence.  </s>
<s> D Meta-information.  </s>
<s> E General Recommendations.  </s>
<s> I think it's too complex and it's hard to understand what modality vs output vs control device means, compared to say, meta-information (it's all meta data at some level...).  </s>
<s> For instance, how does "graceful degradation" (C.1) relates to "C.  </s>
<s> Control Device Independence." ?  </s>
<s> Or, why aren't "grouping selection in form" and "using list for list" not in the same section ?  </s>
<s> why aren't "title for frame" and "alt for imagemap" not together (they both allow for building a serialized version of an otherwise 2-D graphical presentation) ?  </s>
<s> I think we should aim for 2 or 3 sections: A Descriptive information B Structure/Navigation Under "Descriptive information", I would put - image alt, longdesc, video caption, audio transcipt, frame title, abbrev, acronym, alt script/applet All the things one has to add (i.e. attach) to pieces of data in the document.  </s>
<s> Under "Structure/Navigation" - separation content/style, lang, nesting, keyaccess, form grouping, table markup, link phrase, color scheme Thinds are that are more intrinsic to the document "fiber".  </s>
<s> A third possible section would be like section E today: "General guidelines" - comply to standard HTML/CSS - if all fail, use text-only page although this could be folded in the intro (for HTML/CSS) and the conclucion (for text-only) I think this would greatly simplify the understanding of the guidelines.  </s>
<s> I think the division and what to put in each is OK, but I don't like the term "Descriptive information".  </s>
<s> This is because e.g., alt text doesn't describe the image but replaces its function.  </s>
<s> Also information is too general, structure is also information.  </s>
<s> Maybe media-independent content or "HTMLization of all content" may be better titles for A.  </s>
<s> How "Textual equivalent" ?  </s>
<s> I agree that the current sectioning may be improved.  </s>
<s> It is quite difficult to tell from te titles of the sections what they are about.  </s>
<s> Daniel Dardailler suggested: A Descriptive information B Structure/Navigation I think the division and what to put in each is OK, but I don't like the term "Descriptive information".  </s>
<s> This is because e.g., alt text doesn't describe the image but replaces its function.  </s>
<s> Also information is too general, structure is also information.  </s>
<s> Maybe media-independent content or "HTMLization of all content" may be better titles for A. All media understand HTML, but for any other technology there is some media/configuration where it doesn't show.  </s>
<s> E.g, images are not always displayed so you need to hard code in the HTML itself the function of the image.  </s>
<s> The distinction between content and structure is that structure is more global and has to do with the organization of content and thus with navigation.  </s>
<s> (like with meta information, the distinction is not perfect, but I think we are getting to something clearer than before.)  </s>
<s> I am quite happy with Structure/navigation as a title for B. Nir Dagan Assistant Professor of Economics Universitat Pompeu Fabra Barcelona (Spain)  </s>
<s> Daniel said: How [about] "Textual equivalent" ?  </s>
<s> Nir: Very good.  </s>
<s> It doesn't use invalid English "HTMLization" I would try to keep the Hyper in, maybe Hyper-textual equivalent.  </s>
<s> But then its not English, I am afraid.  </s>
<s> So we'll have to settle for textual in the title, and explain the hyper in the prose.  </s>
<s> Nir Dagan Assistant Professor of Economics Universitat Pompeu Fabra Barcelona (Spain)  </s>
<s> Nir, English is the way it is writ, so hyper-textual could be acceptable.  </s>
<s> (There is something funny about having a Frenchman and a Spaniard working out how to put stuff in plain English) More to the point, Daniel's suggestions sound very sensible to me.  </s>
<s> 'Degrading Gracefully' seems to be what Daniel's section A covers.  </s>
<s> And I think a section C 'General Guidelines' or an introduction is a good idea, again as per Daniel's suggestion.  </s>
