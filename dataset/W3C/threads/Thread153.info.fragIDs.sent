I just discovered that tidy26jun99 doesn't seem to recognize the "http-equiv" attribute value of the meta element. 
Did I miss something or what? 
TIA Rossano Basile. 
tidy2jul99 seems to have the same bug; I found out that in "IsValidAttrName" (file lexer.c) the character '-' contained in the string "http-equiv" makes this procedure return no and consequently the error message (Warning: meta unrecognized attribute value "http-equiv") is generated.

Mea culpa. 
I fixed this locally but didn't submit the changes to Dave. 
FYI, the modification simply consisted of adding the following line to lexer.c:InitMap 
MapStr("-_", extended); And modifying the conditional in lexer.c:isValidAttrName 
to: if( (map &amp; lowercase) || (map &amp; uppercase) || (map &amp; digit) || (map &amp; extended)) continue;

Of course you also need to add #define extended 128 in the /* lexer char types */ section in html.h.
