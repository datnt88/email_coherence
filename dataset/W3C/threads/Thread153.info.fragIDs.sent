<s> I just discovered that tidy26jun99 doesn't seem to recognize the "http-equiv" attribute value of the meta element.  </s>
<s> Did I miss something or what?  </s>
<s> TIA Rossano Basile.  </s>
<s> tidy2jul99 seems to have the same bug; I found out that in "IsValidAttrName" (file lexer.c) the character '-' contained in the string "http-equiv" makes this procedure return no and consequently the error message (Warning: meta unrecognized attribute value "http-equiv") is generated.  </s>
<s> Rossano Basile.  </s>
<s> Mea culpa.  </s>
<s> I fixed this locally but didn't submit the changes to Dave.  </s>
<s> FYI, the modification simply consisted of adding the following line to lexer.c:InitMap  </s>
<s> MapStr("-_", extended); And modifying the conditional in lexer.c:isValidAttrName  </s>
<s> to: if( (map &amp; lowercase) || (map &amp; uppercase) || (map &amp; digit) || (map &amp; extended)) continue;  </s>
<s> Craig  </s>
<s> Of course you also need to add #define extended 128 in the /* lexer char types */ section in html.h.  </s>
