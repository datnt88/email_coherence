<s> As we move towards publishing last call (i.e. after approval on 13th Dec), I propose the following: 0) Ignore link errors between our docs prior to this process.  </s>
<s> 1) designate an editor of each document who has CVS access to W3C as the "publishing editor".  </s>
<s> 2) create a subtree on W3C CVS somewhat like the TR/2002 subtree (but empty) 3) "prepublish" the editors drafts into that mirror tree.  </s>
<s> 4) for each of the documents update all the links into other RDF Core WD to be links to that subtree.  </s>
<s> 5) Run the link checker at this point.  </s>
<s> - there should be no links to any of our docs in the real TR space, but only to our copy of the TR space.  </s>
<s> 6) Once everything is pubrules happy  </s>
<s> 7) Take a copy (not CVS) and global substitute the root of our subtree with the root of the real TR tree.  </s>
<s> (a small Unix script can do this)  </s>
<s> 8) This copy is then given to the publication team.  </s>
<s> Requirements: all docs must be ready on time all docs must have a publishing editor unix somewhere Jeremy  </s>
<s> Or use relative URI-references?  </s>
<s> Isn't that what they're for?  </s>
<s> #g Graham Klyne  </s>
<s> They won't work with the latest symbolic links ... Nice try.  </s>
