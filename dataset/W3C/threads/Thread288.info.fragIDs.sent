I'm puzzled at tidy's behavior on some HTML, of which this is typical, where my intent is for " tt " to apply to all the text inside the outer block, including within the inner block: blockquote tt Indented one level. 
Second 1-level indent. 
/tt /blockquote To my naive eye, this looks okay, but tidy (30.11.99) declares Warning: missing /tt before blockquote Warning: inserting implicit tt Warning: inserting implicit tt and changes it to Tidy complains similarly about pre ... Hn ... /Hn ... pre , saying that pre must be closed before Hn and reopened after it. 
Do those two kinds of nesting violate the current standard? 
(If they do, then my emotional response is "then what's the purpose of nested structures at all?") ___Pete 
If you check out the formal definitions of html, you will see that pre, for instance, is defined as not allowing most other formatting tags within it - it's to be used for preformatted text. 
The same thing may be true for blockquote.

What you're running into is that BLOCKQUOTE is a block element, while TT is an inline element. 
Inline elements can't contain block elements according to my understanding of the formal HTML 4.0 spec.
