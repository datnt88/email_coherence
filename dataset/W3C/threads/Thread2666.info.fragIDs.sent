<s> The  </s>

<s> With the multipart encoding, you could still pick apart the response, but now the timing would be much different (you'd get all parts of the response at once).  </s>
<s> That said, why would a proxy ever want to do this buffering and coalescing?  </s>

<s> But that's the spec.  </s>
<s> The HTTP spec even includes pseudo-code for removing the chunked encoding and resending the body with Content-Length.  </s>

<s> That's one problem.  </s>
<s> Another, which affects both chunked transfer encoding and the multipart technique, is that a proxy is at liberty to set quite a short idle-timeout (say 30 secs to a couple of minutes) to protect itself from hung origin servers and double-sided DOS attacks (malicious client on one side, malicious server on the other).  </s>
