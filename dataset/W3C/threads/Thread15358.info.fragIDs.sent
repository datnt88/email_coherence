<s> Wow, this is very brave Gregg.  </s>
<s> Before delving into the suggestion too much, may I request that we do not discuses this on Thursday's call but the call after that.  </s>
<s> Personally I very much want to attend but I will need warning time to schedule it in.  </s>
<s> I also want to review the proposal properly before the call.  </s>
<s> I understand if that is not doable.  </s>
<s> I agree with the idea that the way WCAG 2 evolved was suitable for when we started working on it but is less suitable now.  </s>
<s> A reevaluation is appropriate even if it is painful.  </s>
<s> Again, this is a brave suggestion -good show.  </s>
<s> However if we are evaluating this essence of WCAG 2 then it would be a shame not to do so with the new understanding of concepts (such as device independence), ect that we have.  </s>
<s> If we dare delay WCAG for reevaluation, then let us make sure we are doing it as professionally as possible.  </s>
<s> I think some of the base concepts suggested by Gregg are no longer true.  </s>
<s> For example, it need no longer be true (if we choose to make it so) to say that some of our guidelines just require content to be marked up, while other guidelines prescribe or restrict the way in which authors would create content or present content.  </s>
<s> (and I believe that was Gregg's first statement on the basis of the new proposal) For example, we can can make content clear unambiguous through mark up.  </s>
<s> - again - by the time WCAG 2 is published there need be no restriction at all on peoples use of text, just that the mark up supports clarification and simplification alternatives.  </s>
<s> Further the whole suggested bases for success criteria may be obsolete by the time it is published.  </s>
<s> With RDF techniques ( that will properly be freely available by the time WCAG 2 comes out), all success criteria and AAA accessibility will be possible the default presentation being " whatever they thought it should be to match the bulk or sweet spot of their audience".  </s>
<s> These techniques will be free for the developer and the end user.  </s>
<s> note: that these techniques are already in use, being tried and tested as in-house tools.  </s>
<s> My suggestion: That we take this back to the drawing board, and involve all the Peaple developing accessibility methodologies, such as the Dublin Core, V2, UB Access, FIT LIFE etc ,and work out a proposal that will not be obsolete by the time it is published.  </s>
<s> PF just put up a paper at some of the concepts it is a member only site so I am also attaching this paper as an attachment.  </s>
<s> It may be helpful for understanding some of the comments above.  </s>
