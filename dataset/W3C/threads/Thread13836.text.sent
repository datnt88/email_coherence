References and/or examples? 
Is it JavaScript (the language) or its uses that are not accessible? 
One could argue that HTML, for example, is not accessible because it can be [ab]used to produce inaccessible documents. 
So can JavaScript, especially when used to create visual effects with no alternative, non-visually accessible counterpart. 
I'm not "defending" JavaScript here, just wanting to be aware of accessibility issues in its use. 
As a programmer, I find JavaScript to be a powerful tool, for example, for client-side forms validation and assistance. 
Is this use necessarily inaccessible? 
I think if I'm sensitive to accessibility concerns in consideration, planning and design, it need not be. 
For example, for public Web sites, I can't (won't) require that the reader/user enable JavaScript to use the form, so part of my design and testing is to make sure the form works without JavaScript. 
I can suggest to the reader/user that they enable JavaScript to obtain specific advantages with that form, but I can't (won't) require that they do so.

Hello, It sounds like you are using JavaScript in an accessible way. 
You are correct in comparing HTML to Javascript in that it is in the use (or abuse grin ) that causes access problems. 
as to how this relates to Charles' comments about suggested changes to C.1, we'll have to give it some more thought.

Chris' use of Javascript sounds like: Using javascripts to provide optional extra functionality, which is not required at any level of the process, and which cannot otherwise be provided in a more accessible format. 
As I understand it, Javascript works OK with screen readers, not at all with lynx and similar systems, so it's value in the context of accessible design is the ability to provide these 'extra' functions, like rollover highlights and pre-submission form validation. 
Where it is used to provide, for example, an on-screen calculator, then it will only be partially accessible. 
It is also important to notify the user that a change to some object will occur or has occurred (there is some discussion of this in PF, with regard to DOM) since a non-visual user may not notice this automatically. 
(This last should probably go into the guidelines somewhere, but I will write a seperate comment next) Charles McCN
