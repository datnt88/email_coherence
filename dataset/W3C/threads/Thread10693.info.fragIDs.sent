<s> Danbri and I have been discussing issue: Its quite hard to get a crisp quote of the problem from the email thread but I think the issue is that schema does not layer the same way as, say UML, in that classes can be members of themselves and one can take a subproperty of subPropertyOf or rdf:type.  </s>
<s> I think we need to clearly articulate the advantages of the design choice that has been made.  </s>
<s> I suggest the following reason for the design choice and why we should not change.  </s>
<s> I welcome comments and other suggestions: 1) RDFS is designed to be a lower layer for the semantic web stack that is extended by restriction.  </s>
<s> All structure at this layer is imposed on all higher layers.  </s>
<s> A layered structure is not necessary and the principle of minimal restriction suggests it should be omitted.  </s>
<s> 2) A further consideration is the cost of change at this point.  </s>
<s> To switch to a layered approach would require a massive rethink and would affect not only the RDFCore specs but also OWL.  </s>
<s> Only a show stopping problem with the current design could justify the cost of such a change.  </s>
<s> We note that it is possible to build more strictly layered languages on top of RDF(S), Owl DL/Lite being examples.  </s>
<s> Brian  </s>
<s> I'm not convinced of a *need* to do this.  </s>
<s> (But if we can, then fine...) I think the main issue here is that the non-layering is a fundamental feature of the RDF we were tasked to clarify.  </s>
<s> I think we don't really have any discretion to consider other design approaches.  </s>
<s> This might be underscored by mentioning the large number of implementations that currently depend on this model (esp schema uses where rdfs:Class is treated as both resource and class, and is a member itself, etc.).  </s>
<s> A good point to make, I think.  </s>

<s> I disagree.  </s>
<s> first, we did not make it, it was imposed by our charter.  </s>
<s> Second, the only objection to it from this comment can be succinctly phrased as "I don't like that way of doing it" which does't really need to be dignified with a careful answer, particularly in view of the fact that when asked for clarification, the commentor's response was somewhere between unhelpful and downright rude.  </s>
<s> That might be well worth articulating in more detail.  </s>
<s> I think we  </s>
<s> could do a fairly exact job on this which a lot of people would find helpful.  </s>
<s> Since Jeremy has already done the donkey work for this in defining how to tell if an OWL-RDf graph is in OWL-DL ( which is precisely the 'layered' subset of OWL in this sense), we should be able to easily adapt his algorithm to define a 'layered style' of writing RDF and put it in an appendix somewhere.  </s>
<s> I am willing to tackle writing a draft of this.  </s>
<s> It would be relevant to vass-01,  </s>
<s> pan-01 and Qu-03.  </s>

<s> While I am not convinced of the value of this exercise I am happy to contribute an articulation of the intersection of OWL Lite and RDFS, with a few sensible relaxations (like allowing cycles of bnodes).  </s>
<s> Jeremy  </s>
<s> The question of layering has been made many times by many people.  </s>
<s> The RDF schema approach is unusual and it is not uncommon for folks, e.g. those familiar with UML, to ask "why did you do it differently".  </s>
<s> I was kinda hoping there was a relatively simple answer to that question.  </s>
<s> And if there  </s>
<s> is, I see no reason for not offering it in response to this comment.  </s>
<s> I personally find the example in the webont docs quite convincing.  </s>
<s> It seems to be that in general I want to be able to treat Cabernet Sauvignon as both an instance of the class of species of grape and a class of grape instances.  </s>
<s> Maybe a response might include something of that nature.  </s>
<s> The world just ain't layered.  </s>
<s> I'm not looking for doing new work at this point.  </s>
<s> Is this work *necessary* to resolve these comments.  </s>
<s> I would like to see simple responses to the comments.  </s>
<s> I'm not at all keen on new appendices.  </s>
<s> There is not just the work of writing them, they need to be reviewed etc. Please lets focus on getting the current tasks completed.  </s>
<s> We are supposed to be done by end of June after all.  </s>
<s> Pat, will you be able to propose resolutions for outstanding semantics issues for this weeks telecon?  </s>

<s> The design derives from the principle... "Anyone Can Make Simple Assertions About Anything" One straightforward approach is to refer the commentor to that section and see if it satisfies him.  </s>
<s> Another approach is to elaborate that section to derive the "non-traditional" aspects of RDF/RDFS design (properties of properties, classes of classes) from that principle.  </s>
<s> TimBL has done it a number of times orally; I wish I had a tape recorder.  </s>
<s> Hmm... he chimed in on a relevant thread... Re: FAQ: stratified class hierarchies vs. RDFS From: Tim Berners-Lee (timbl@w3.org)  </s>
<s> Date: Thu, Jun 27 ... but no, that's hardly what I'd send to the commentor.  </s>
<s> Let's see... the argument goes like this, as I recall... 1.  </s>
<s> A tree is more constrained than a graph, i.e. web.  </s>
<s> A central architectural principle of the web is that it is, in the general case, an unconstrained web; trees, lattices, tables, etc. can be embedded in the web, but the web as a whole is unconstrained.  </s>
<s> This is a fundamental architectural feature of the Web; lots of systems that had all the other features of the Web and more, but lacked this one, failed.  </s>
<s> 2. RDF builds on the existing web of URIs, promoting the idea of typed links from something rarely exploited to a central feature, properties, and promoting the informal relationship between linked resources to formal logical... well, formulas; in exchange for the reduced expressiveness of formal systems, we get the benefit of computationally assisted reasoning.  </s>
<s> [hmm... perhaps we can leave points 1 and 2 implicit; but I'm not deleting them from this message...] 3. Consider single inheritance.  </s>
<s> If doc1 says doc1#baseball rdf:type doc1#Sport , and some other party wants to use the same concept of baseball but relate it to a different class, ala doc1#baseball rdf:type doc2#Business , to prevent them from doing so is to artificially constrain RDF, counter to point 1. 4. Consider stratified class hierarchies.  </s>
<s> If docA says docA#DatabaseTable rdf:type docA#ModellingTechnique .  </s>
<s> and docB says docA#ModellingTechnique rdf:type docB#ConceptsInPhilosophyBook1 .  </s>
<s> And docC says docB#ConceptsInPhilosophyBook1 rdf:type docA#DatabaseTable .  </s>
<s> Then any stratified design imposes an arbitrary limitation on the use of these three documents.  </s>
<s> Something like that.  </s>
<s> Hmm... perhaps something in between is more straightforward...  </s>
<s> Yes, that seems responsive to the comment.  </s>
<s> Another possible alternative is for the chair to rule this discussion out of scope on charter grounds; to reply to the commentor that the WG isn't chartered to explore alternative designs.  </s>
<s> That's cheaper in the short-run, but the cost of actually trying to satisfy the commentor should be weighed against the risk that the comment will come back during proposed recommendation review, from a member, when it will be in order to say "well, we're not interested in what we chartered you to do any more."  </s>
<s> Meanwhile... I like the approach of writing up the constrained form of RDFS that matches some of the FOL/UML/OOP intuitions... I'd like that to be a separate NOTE, though.  </s>
