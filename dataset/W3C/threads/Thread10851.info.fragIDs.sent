<s> I was going to reply in detail to Ken Holman's note, and the note from Lee that inspired it, and Ron Daniels' notes that have started this thread, but instead I think I should summarize, rather than doing a blow-by-blow.  </s>
<s> Ron has laid out some strategies for FPI resolution.  </s>
<s> Note that URNs will have _at least_ several alternative resolution mechnisms (probably including some kind of local filesystem access).  </s>
<s> Ron is asking about appropriate mechnisms for resolving FPIs within the URN framework.  </s>
<s> This is great: certainly some variation of catalogs should be useful in the FPI subset of the URN space.  </s>
<s> Note that URNs (of any sort) do not inherently require the use of DNS or any particular machines, though NAPTR defines a resolution mechanism based on DNS.  </s>
<s> Eventually, for some documents, I expect that libraries will get into the act, or some groups filling the social function of library catalogs if they don't fill that niche.  </s>
<s> I think, given that the URN group is willing to figure out how to integrate FPI into URN resolution, that we should encourage and help them on that (but not worry about specifying or discussing those mechanisms here, as it's not the right place).  </s>
<s> The XML standard should specify the option to have a PUBLIC string, expain that it is unique, persistent, etc., and how to get a GCA or ISBN publisher prefix.  </s>
<s> It should point out that resolution is application dependent, but that applications are suggested to use catalogs (We might  </s>
<s> make a simplified catalog format the does not bother with remapping SYSTEM, network resolution, etc, if that makes for 1000's of lines of code), or the Internet's URN mechanisms for FPIs (this latter is being worked by the URN group, and need not be further specified).  </s>
<s> We also need to note that other resolution mechanisms are also acceptable.  </s>
<s> That gives an implementor two things to implement if they desire, and a browser (or other simple parser) can simply use system IDs, and treat the FPI as documentation when reporting the failure, if it does not ignore the FPI completely.  </s>
<s> FPIs can _only_, in principle, guarantee that something has a unique name, not that you can find the thing.  </s>
<s> (But, of course, having a unique name can be of use in finding things).  </s>

<s> I think you are missing David's point.  </s>
<s> He is explicitly not looking for a solution.  </s>
<s> He is looking for the flexibility to implement his own solutions.  </s>
<s> If SGML Open Catalogs happen to be the solution that is useful to many people, then maybe it could be mentioned in the standard, or even required (as a default solution, not as a "universal solution").  </s>
<s> I think that we all agree that we aren't going to solve the global naming "problem" here.  </s>
<s> As David says, "given that the URN group is willing to figure out how to integrate FPI into URN resolution, that we should encourage and help them on that (but not worry about specifying or discussing those mechanisms here, as it's not the right place)."  </s>
<s> All I am asking is that I not be tied to a "solution, of sorts, for now."  </s>

<s> I think this is a very reasonable proposal.  </s>
<s> By saying "can simply use system IDs" are you implying that you would always have a system ID even if you also had a public identifier?  </s>
<s> I'm not sure I'd want to require a system ID in all cases.  </s>
<s> But of course nothing can guarantee the ability to find a thing in the general case (i.e., a open system, e.g., the Web).  </s>

<s> I think that any document that is published on the Web should have system IDs for all entities.  </s>
<s> That could be in an SGML Open Catalog if we make SOCAT handling a mandatory default resolution mechanism, or inline, if we do not.  </s>
<s> Lee is right to complain that there must be a URL somewhere, or else we are just handwaving.  </s>
<s> Within an "internal system", where a resolution mechanism is well defined, URLs may not be useful.  </s>
<s> I am not sure if there is a clear line between "published on the web" and used in an "internal system", but perhaps authors should make that decision.  </s>
<s> If they want everyone to be able to read their documents, they must put URLs where the user agents know how to find them: inline or in some widely-implemented catalog mechanism.  </s>

<s> Seconded -Debbie Lapeyre  </s>
<s> I also agree with this.  </s>
<s> It's best to have a name and a location than one only of each...  </s>
<s> What about for data content notations?  </s>
<s> As many notations don't have publicly accessible definition documents (which is what the external identifier of a notation is supposed to refer to first and foremost), it's seems unreasonable to require URLs for them.  </s>

<s> On NOTATION, I think we need to be careful -- Wherever possible, we should use MIME-types in harmony with the rest of the net -- whether we also want to support FPIs on the same optional basis as we should for documents is an open question.  </s>
<s> Their real use, it seems to me, would be for private types, and since we have the x- mime types (though their use is discouraged officially, I think) we may not even need them for that.  </s>
<s> For notation, I don't know that we need FPIs because that SYTEM ID (if a MIME type) is already globally-unique and persistent, with a well-defined naming authority: IANA.  </s>
<s> I think it would be a compatibility issue, more than anything.  </s>
<s> My impression is that public notations are not very common, but I could be wrong.  </s>
