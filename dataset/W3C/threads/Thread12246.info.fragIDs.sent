<s> Dear blond Kynn,  </s>
<s> You should be signing off on the latest draft (currently 22 Dec) so that we can actually finish this process.  </s>
<s> (so should everyone else, but so far I am the only person whose explicit sign-off i have seen :-(  </s>
<s> Please note that in producing another draft there may be rather minor editorial amendments made.  </s>
<s> However suggestions of minor edits to be made before people sign off are at this stage holding up the process.  </s>
<s> (The definition of editorial amendment that we are working on is that it could be done or ignored and the documnt would not be materially different) cheers Charles McCN Australian blond.  </s>

<s> Could everyone in the group sign off on the present document by Monday, January 3rd, 2000 at 4pm Eastern Time.  </s>
<s> This should be done by sending a message to the list saying that you sign off.  </s>
<s> As Charles stated there may be very minor editorial changes occuring to the document between then and now, these will not be changes that affect the document content or intention.  </s>
<s> Thanks Jutta and have a happy new year!  </s>
<s> Happy New Year everyone, from Oz, where it is now 1900.  </s>
<s> (I think)  </s>
<s> And yes, it would be nice to get explicit sign-offs.  </s>
<s> I know some people are going to in the next few days, but if you hadn't thought about it please get your fingers on the keyboards...  </s>
