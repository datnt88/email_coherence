Hallo, whenever I try to use http put to save a document (into a htaccess protected area) amaya exists with a broken pipe message. 
The authentication scheme used is "basic" amaya is version 1.2a.

Hmmm... Works well at W3C using Jigsaw and Jigedit, which uses access control. 
What server (and version) are you using? 
Is it configured to support PUT? (Apache must be configured to use PUT; it doesn't work out of the box). 
Old servers (HTTP/1.0) will also fail in random ways, due to problems with the protocol, fixed in HTTP/1.1. 
You might also use Henrik Frystyk's command line tool and/or his GUI put tool to test if your server is working correctly.

I use Apache, which is configured to use http/put. 
Works well with netscape and works also if no authentication is required. 
BTW: there is another wierdness about the authentication: It comes up with the authentication dialog multiple times (appearently for every pic in the page, not sure about that number). 
It's an apache 1.1.3. 
Too old? 
Thanks for the pointer. 
I was looking for a command line http put tool for a long time.

Known problem in in the version of libwww that Amaya 1.2a uses. 
You could rebuild against a more recent libwww. 
Yes; that is an HTTP/1.0 server. 
There is no guarantee that a PUT on an HTTP/1.0 server will ever work; it depends on exact details of the network connection and the client and server implementation. 
The protocol itself is broken, and so some servers and clients try to code around the problem. 
Netscape before Version 4 is completely broken with PUT.... (I presume you are using Netscape 4). 
There is no way to reliably do PUT with HTTP/1.0, though you can make it work "most" of the time, which is what Navigator 4 is doing... 
The protocol is fixed in HTTP/1.1 (Apache 1.2 or later; 1.3 just came out: I recommend you install this. 
Yes, send kudo's to Henrik... - Jim
