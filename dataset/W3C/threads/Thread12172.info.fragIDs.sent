Structured content is important for users with disabilities who have to use 
serial media" such as screen readers, or highly magnified screens. 
Reading content that doesn't have structure is much slower for such users. 
How much? 
This is a brief thought experiment in the absence of proper data: I can look at approximately 1000 words in a glance, pick out the headings and links in under a second, and read them in about 1-5 seconds (lower for a page of actual content than for something like search engine output). 
Using a fast speech synthesis system that takes about two minutes. 
If navigating content by recognising these things is 5 percent of using the web, that makes it between about 2 and 6 times as slow overall. 
(I am not sure what there difference is with braille because I don't know how fast that goes, but the same calculations can be done for screen magnification. 
Essentially visual recognition is much faster, and comprehension requires recogition first). 
Similar arguments apply to navigation of content, using input systems such as sip-puff controllers, very limited keyboards, and so on. 
If the user can rapidly access navigation controls providing outlines, link lists, etc. then the difference is reduced to actual reading and "keying" speed. 
Both of these things are important to accessibility. 
The importance for content is reflected in the fact that structure is required by WCAG, and the importance for navigation is that navigation of structure is required (in several ways) by UAAG.

Another seldom-dwelt-on fact is that this is also very important for machines. 
The Semantic Web is essentially Web Accessibility for Machines, all of which are cursed with semantic-pragmatic disability. 
In all the 'droid movies the friendly robot is constantly led astray by simile/metaphor/irony/sarcasm. 
Attending to semantics and exporting/documenting its features is fundamental to authoring, whether of documents or of new languages.

EACH UNINDEXED WEB POSTING WE MAKE IS TESTAMENT TO OUR HYPOCRISY

MRK: I agree, if the page has some visual structure you are not looking so much 1000 or any number of words but the structure itself and skipping to content that looks potentially interesting, reading titles or highlighted words, looking images or tables, finding a navigation bar, reading the beginning or end paragraph, searching info of the writer etc. 
Having to read most of the 1000 words before finding the writer or some other info is pretty slow when we can see almost directly that it is at the end of the page. 
Havings things available visually in front of us frees our memory too as we can always check easily what else is available and we don't have to memorize commands to go to places. 
Exact calculations of speed differences are difficult because it depends on how much can be skipped, how it is done (typing shortcut commands, looking them up from a menu etc.) and the reading speeds. 
However, it is easy to see there is an effect. 
Some visual features tell as pretty fast what is the writer name, a navigation bar, an advertisement, or a title. 
It would be nice to have consistent metadata for more of these structures when they cannot be seen and easy ways to skip to them and back. 
Also we could have some help in memorizing what structures e.g. titles or links have not been read yet etc. Marja
