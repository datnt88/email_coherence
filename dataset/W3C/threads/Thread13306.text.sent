The er working group needs our input on a number of issues. 
I've attached a summary of main issues to date. 
I'd like to arrange a teleconference to proceed. 
Please post to this list your current thoughts on the issues listed below and any other important issues I omitted. 
Also, please send to me kasday@acm.org 
(*not* to the list) what times are good are bad for you for a teleconference on and after Oct. 26. 
Len Here are issues that have been discussed on this list (in chronological order) 1. 
The web report form. 
Last message to this list was Daniels's draft form is at http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/report - Do we as a group have consensus that this is a useful tool? 
- Do we have additional suggestions for improvement? 
- Is there a way to test some of the concepts with users? 
- In addition to sending reports to webmasters, should reports be made public? 
2. Bottom Line evaluation. 
see e.g. David's comments at - What are minimum requirement for "pass"? 
Is starting point a count of requirements passed/failed? 
or is starting point something like . 
"usable with Lynx" 3. Textual Equivalents This concerns tools that try to supply ALT text and other text equivalents when they are missing from web page. 
Daniel's features are at http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/text-equiv.htm - How can we determine value of various approaches? 
e.g. apply by hand to "typical" pages? 
4. Audio browsing simulators e.g. Al's note at - What would value of this tool be?, e.g. compared with viewing via Lynx? 
- Feature design? 
5. Tables. 
According to comments from some folks in Peterborough, tables cause major difficulty once alternative text is taken care of, since the spatial organization of tables conveys information. 
Recommendations for browing tables in the UA guidelines. 
e.g. in the working draft Can we provide some of this functionality to people using current day browsers? 
(I'll be giving some suggestions on this in subsequent email) Leonard R. Kasday Institute on Disabilities/UAP at Temple University, Philadelphia PA Concerning textual equivalents: Two more attributes that may used for creating textual equivalents are ID and CLASS. 
Clearly ID with higher priority since it is document-wide unique. 
In regard to the NAME attribute, it is not defined for IMG in HTML4.0 (or any other W3C/IETF spec.) It is used though to address the IMG element by client side scripts in older browsers who do not recognize ID. Ofcourse it may be used to create a textual equivalent by a program that recognizes it.

ID ok, but class seems far fetched. 
yes, my mistake, AREA too is missing it, I guess because they have ALT. that raises the question of whether this technique document should be limited to what's standard or what's useful As you noticed, I'm now leaning toward a "stepped" version of the report. 
I also maintain a open-issue page for this report form: I think so. 
probably more coming in yes, a trial with this forum for instance. 
I think so. 
I want to use a simple w3c public mailing list where reports are cced and where webmaster and reporters can discuss their points. 
Whatever tool is going to use these techniques should make its best effort to offer as many choices to the user as possible without damaging/loading the setup interface. 
One should be able to select what default operational mode is desired and then select alternative/override techniques as it moves on. 
My student Eric has been working on a TABLE linearizer and I hope to come up soon with a demo online. 
You can read some ideas about it in http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/WG/tablin.txt
