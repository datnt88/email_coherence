Who's supposed to be making our case at the W3C level? 
I've just seen a lengthy report from a UK representative of last month's W3C meeting, and XML is barely there: 2 one-line mentions in a 10-page report on a 3-day meeting. 
Numerous questions were raised to which XML is the answer, but apparently no-one gave that answer, e.g. "Some felt that there should be an HTML extension mechanism (similar to PEP for HTTP). 
Dan Connolly would produce a HTML briefing paper". 
Why doesn't this say "Dan Connolly pointed out that XML addressed this need directly."? ht I attended that meeting and tried to put in a plug for XML whenever I could. 
The W3C folks tried hard to downplay SGML and XML, but they did not manage to keep me quiet. 
It seems clear that they consider XML a bit of a threat and are trying to minimize its role. 
The best way that we can overcome that is to demonstrate the uefulness and practicality of XML as compared to HTML. 
Interest in growing, but it will take time and demonstrable software to sway more people to our side. 
I expect to be atending the next AC meeting on June 17/18. 
Having software to demonstrate at that meeting would be a big help in pushing XML higher up on the agenda for the consortium.

It is competitive. 
We have to live with that and understand the competition. 
The W3C consortium is a collection of conflicting interests. 
Go where they need this: not where they fear it. 
This is when alliance with ISO and WG8 plays to an advantage. 
Don't compare this to HTML. 
Don't compare this to Acrobat. 
This is SGML made practical for practical requirements. 
Figure out what those requirements are first. 
len bullard I think Dan, I and others were discussing some sort of HTML extension mechanism even as far back in the plastocene when the html-wg was still wandering the earth in search of small reptiles to eat. 
I remember attempting to get IANA to register extension names. 
A lifetime ago. 
The modularization of the HTML DTD was an early attempt at what Dan called a "platform for experimentation", and would still be (I believe) the mechanism whereby HTML extensions would be added. 
But as we all know, there's not too many HTML UAs that even bother to interpret the FPI in DOCTYPE, much less parse a DTD or perform entity management, so I think this effort is really doomed to failure. 
It's funny that we're just now discussing one of the features that HTML would need in order to provide some measure of ordered extension functionality: catalogs and entity management. 
Because in HTML there seems to be no movement towards greater interoperability and modularity (in fact, movement away from it if anything) I think the 'X' in XML will never make it over to prefix 'HTML', unless one counts ActiveX, etc. as extensibility.

(This thread seems to have appeared out of nowhere. 
Did someone's private correspondence get forwarded to the list?) [Len Bullard:] Yes. 
I cannot emphasize too strongly the importance of this point. 
HTML is almost perfectly suited to the problem space it was originally designed to address, and for that reason it will probably be around for decades to come. 
It is a big mistake to position XML as competition to HTML. 
XML is not going to take over HTML's problem space, and suggesting that it might just generates needless hostility. 
Jon I suspect Dan would argue with that proposition; I'm fairly sure TBL would if pinned down. 
Nobody on W3C staff said a kind word for XML when I and others brought it up. 
XML was not given air time; or rather it was listed on the agenda but time ran out during the final "quiz the staff" session. 
I hope next year someone from the SGML ERB will be given an hour to present the glowing success story. 
But we'll have to get XML far up the pipeline in the W3C process for that to happen; that pipeline is clogged, and if XML doesn't burst loose in Santa Clara it might not get another chance this year. 
(I wish I could be there.) /kmc For the record, none of the text quoted was actually written by me, although I did participate in the thread.

Jon Bosak: Really? 
No comparison of XML and HTML? 
It makes sense to avoid denigrating HTML, but the question of how XML and HTML compare is going to ask itself, and loudly. 
People have been confused about HTML and SGML for years, and the introduction of XML into their vocabularies will only accentuate the need for rational comparisons. 
It doesn't matter whether comparing XML and HTML is the "wrong question." 
It's the question that everyone will ask. 
Even when we acknowledge the fit of HTML's design to its problem space, some folks will bristle when we suggest that HTML's problem space isn't infinite. 
(Doesn't Netscape's indifference to XML suggest a belief in the sufficiency of HTML?) Even if HTML users agree that XML solves certain problems more efficiently than HTML-plus-programs can, they will have to spend real money to take advantage of XML technology. 
People will need comparisons to make sensible business investments. 
And investments require that businesses assess *competitive* advantages of their investment options: XML or HTML, and for which applications? 
We certainly shouldn't generate needless hostility. 
And the XML initiative can certainly proceed without being hostile. 
But some hostility will greet whatever this initiative produces, and with a proper XML story, which includes SGML-XML-HTML comparisions, that hostility can be defused and can work to XML's advantage. 
IMO ... -Todd. 
Sun Microsystems, Inc. [Todd Freter:] I didn't say that XML should not be compared to HTML. 
I said that it should not be positioned as competition to HTML. 
You can compare a Honda Civic to a Mack truck. 
But you can't sensibly position a Honda Civic as competition to a Mack truck. 
They targeted for different markets. 
Jon In addition, has anyone noticed that XML *doesn't* show up on the main web document at http://www.w3.org. 
You have to dig down in the SGML link to find XML. 
It would be a great benefit to have an XML link since we do have a 1.0 *standard*.
