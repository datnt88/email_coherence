<s> I forgot, what did we decide about this checkpoint?  </s>
<s> 10.2 Until user agents support explicit associations between labels and form controls, for all form controls with implicitly associated labels, ensure that the label is properly positioned.  </s>
<s> [Priority 2] The label must immediately precede its control on the same line (allowing more than one control/label per line) or be in the line preceding the control (with only one label and one control per line).  </s>
<s> Did we bother to figure out yet if we reached that "until user agents" point?  </s>
<s> Do we currently have a chart of all the "until user agent" clauses that shows which ones have been reached yet and which ones have not?  </s>
<s> I checked http://www.w3.org/WAI/Resources/WAI-UA-Support and there is "no information" on 10.2.  </s>
<s> I got asked this in my web accessibility class and I'm of the opinion to tell my student: (a) Ignore 10.2 and just use label , and/or (b) Set up style rules such that you have two labels, one before and one after, with appropriate media selectors, and/or (c) Add redundant @title attributes on the form fields.  </s>
<s> Is the UA-Support page being actively maintained?  </s>
<s> We refer web developers to it via WCAG, but for the majority of checkpoints we give zero guidance.  </s>

<s> No it is not being actively maintained for lack of resources.  </s>
<s> The whole "until user agents" issue is being revisited for WCAG 2.0.  </s>
<s> Anybody who wants to maintain a user agent support page and conduct all the necessary research is welcome to volunteer, however.  </s>
<s> I might, if I ever get off my butt and finish my last project related to CSS-TECHS.  </s>
<s> See, the problem is that WCAG 1 depends on the existence of this document.  </s>
<s> WCAG 1 is unusable as written without this document being maintained.  </s>
<s> I realize this will go away in WCAG 2, but for now it means that WCAG 1 is way up in the air.  </s>
<s> At the very least we should put a notice saying "THIS IS NO LONGER BEING MAINTAINED" on the page, and provide a strategy for web developers to deal with WCAG 1 until WCAG 2 is issued.  </s>
<s> If nobody objects, I'll think about what we want to say there about this and send it to the WG for consideration.  </s>
