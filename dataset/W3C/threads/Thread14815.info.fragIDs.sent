I forgot, what did we decide about this checkpoint? 
10.2 Until user agents support explicit associations between labels and form controls, for all form controls with implicitly associated labels, ensure that the label is properly positioned. 
[Priority 2] The label must immediately precede its control on the same line (allowing more than one control/label per line) or be in the line preceding the control (with only one label and one control per line). 
Did we bother to figure out yet if we reached that "until user agents" point? 
Do we currently have a chart of all the "until user agent" clauses that shows which ones have been reached yet and which ones have not? 
I checked http://www.w3.org/WAI/Resources/WAI-UA-Support and there is "no information" on 10.2. 
I got asked this in my web accessibility class and I'm of the opinion to tell my student: (a) Ignore 10.2 and just use label , and/or (b) Set up style rules such that you have two labels, one before and one after, with appropriate media selectors, and/or (c) Add redundant @title attributes on the form fields. 
Is the UA-Support page being actively maintained? 
We refer web developers to it via WCAG, but for the majority of checkpoints we give zero guidance.

No it is not being actively maintained for lack of resources. 
The whole "until user agents" issue is being revisited for WCAG 2.0. 
Anybody who wants to maintain a user agent support page and conduct all the necessary research is welcome to volunteer, however. 
I might, if I ever get off my butt and finish my last project related to CSS-TECHS. 
See, the problem is that WCAG 1 depends on the existence of this document. 
WCAG 1 is unusable as written without this document being maintained. 
I realize this will go away in WCAG 2, but for now it means that WCAG 1 is way up in the air. 
At the very least we should put a notice saying "THIS IS NO LONGER BEING MAINTAINED" on the page, and provide a strategy for web developers to deal with WCAG 1 until WCAG 2 is issued. 
If nobody objects, I'll think about what we want to say there about this and send it to the WG for consideration.

Whether anybody objects or not, I would certainly like to see your 
proposal.
