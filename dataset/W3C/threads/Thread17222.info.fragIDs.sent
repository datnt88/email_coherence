In section 508, Provision P) calls for a warning when a session is about to 
expire giving the user an opportunity to get more time in the session. 
The 
only way I know of to deliver this warning is through js, Are there other ways and how effective are they and how supported are they? 
Hi David 
What I am about to say only applies if pages are being generated by a script or programme: If I were being asked to do this, I would probably use a REFRESH in the header; this would cause the same page to re-load at a set interval, checking on each load how much time is left. 
When the critical time were reached, I would switch on a warning message when the page is re-drawn. 
Possible problems: I don't know how this would work with screen readers. 
Another alternative is Server Side Push; I mention this out of interest only because I believe that it is only supported by the Netscape browser family. 
Practical suggestion: rather than warning just before a session is about to expire, state somewhere that "your session will expire in xxx minutes unless you do xyz." Cheers M Matthew Smith IT Consultant - KBC, South Australia KBC Web Site http://www.kbc.net.au

Mathew, I like your suggestion, the intent of the provision though is to provide as much time as needed and we don't know how much time that is. 
It is concievable then that someone might not be able to do this in a certain 
period of time. 
The idea would be for the message to come up and the user to have to respond and in this case, the user can respond at as long an interval as necessary and still have an active session. 
So in effect, what we have is a question. 
"Do you need more time"" sitting there waiting for 
an answer. 
This puts the session in to sort of park mode meeting security needs but not disallowing individuals who have time issues from dealing with the site.

I imagine it would be very disruptive, as I don't think that typical Refresh implemenations do If-Modified-Since and inhibit re-rendering if there is no change. 
I'd imagine the page would restart at the beginning. 
Also, even in GUIs, this use of refresh is disruptive, if people are filling in forms, or a long way down a page that will reset to the first screenful until the refetch reaches the right point. 
It might just be usable to stop the user going away when the page takes a long time to create, but I helieve there is an HTTP code for that, although support is probably poor to non-existent. 
Refresh is a Netscape proprietory feature and, as far as I know, "Server Side Push" is just their marketing term for the the use of Refresh, even though it is a pull at the protocol level. 
The simplest way on the web is to use ordinary HTML forms - they don't expire (and if you want to keep session information it can be done easily enough). 
It takes extra work to make a form expire in the first place. 
If you do have some application with time-sensitive forms (for example an auction) there is a fundamental problem - at some point the external constraint is going to come into play. 
In general my suggestion is to let people know how much time they have, to be as generous as possible (don't have expiry times if they aren't necessary, and let people know how much time they have in the form if there is an expiry time). 
For example "you need to complete this form today". 
Or "this offer is valid for the first 5 people who return it - if you are slow you may miss out". 
Or "answers will be accepted until midnight (Kalamazoo time - UTC+0600) tuesday 11 july 2014", or "after approximately 10 minutes this session will be closed for security reasons. 
If you may need more time to complete forms, you can subscribe to our a href="longer" extended time interface /a ."
