<s> Hi, As an introduction to our discussion of what the Technology-specific Checklists layer of WCAG 2.0 might look like, Paul, Wendy and I have been working on a few sample pages and collecting issues and ideas for the group to review as we begin the process of making decisions about how the checklist should take shape.  </s>
<s> The checklists, which are described in the second section of "How to read this document" in the latest draft, are intended to "provide information on what is required when using different technologies in order to meet the WCAG 2.0 Working Draft access guidelines."  </s>
<s> Much of the information included below is a compilation of ideas and discussions that began in small group work at the July face to face in Linz.  </s>
<s> In case anyone is interested in reviewing the discussion that took place there, I've added links to the original draft pages that were presented at the end of the face to face to the minutes, which are available at Many thanks to Paul, Bengt, Avi, Christian and Wendy for help in brainstorming and working through these ideas.  </s>
<s> Issues and questions: *In addition to understanding how to succeed in meeting the guidelines, how can this checklist also describe how and where techniques or technologies might fail?  </s>
<s> For example, should the document make it clear that, for a technology that by definition can not address a specific checkpoint, make a statement asserting that meeting a checkpoint in a given technology is not possible?  </s>
<s> Some suggestions for addressing this issue include: 1.only generate techniques documents for technologies that meet WCAG 2.0 at the minimum level 2.include a "not possible" category that describes how some techniques or technologies may fail and suggest alternatives 3.create an other technology that allows for newer technologies and techniques to be used in meeting a checkpoint.  </s>
<s> That way, the message isn't that authors shouldn't use a technology.  </s>
<s> Instead, it simply means that we don't have techniques yet and provides an opportunity for author to explain how the checkpoint was addressed.  </s>
<s> *How much ongoing work will the group be able to do on this layer (and the techniques documents) after WCAG 2.0 becomes a recommendation?  </s>
<s> *If the checklists include all of the checkpoints (21 in latest draft), success criteria (80 in latest draft) and techniques (there will likely be multiple techniques for each success criteria) in one place, the document is likely to become quite long.  </s>
<s> How can we best optimize the checklists so that they are optimally usable and minimally overwhelming?  </s>
<s> *At this point, it's not clear exactly how the techniques relate to whether or not an author has passed or failed a given success criteria.  </s>
<s> For example, where 5 techniques exist to address a single checkpoint, it's not clear how the techniques would be prioritized.  </s>
<s> Is it possible that in some cases one technique will be preferred/recommended over another given the current state of user agent support?  </s>
<s> Will it be possible to insert something that, for example, says you will have passed a success criterion if you have applied x number of techniques below?  </s>
<s> *For level 2 assurance type success criteria (e.g. the content has been reviewed and .), should a unique set of techniques be included for each?  </s>
<s> Would all of the review requirements of this type be addressed with the same set of techniques or would these recurring techniques be described elsewhere?  </s>
<s> Also, does it make sense to include a space for a reviewer/author to document what they've done or observed related to the review process?  </s>
<s> *Checkpoint 3.3 was included in the sample checklist drafts so that we could take a look at how a checkpoint that includes additional ideas might look.  </s>
<s> Does it make sense to include the ideas here or is it likely that each idea will need its own list of techniques?  </s>
<s> *The drafts currently don't link into the techniques documents because there's nothing to link to at this point in time.  </s>
<s> When we do add links, do we want the entire rule element that will be pulled from the techniques to become a link or should we consider including a techniques numbering system and provide shorter links at the front end as we have with checkpoints and guidelines?  </s>
<s> Draft pages: *An example of a basic checklist layout is available at there are a number of areas where information is missing, not yet linked in, or not yet available, it illustrates how we might handle different types of checkpoints and success criteria in checklist form and puts forth some ideas for addressing some of the issues described above.  </s>
<s> *An alternate example, available at illustrates how the checklist may be presented in a more block-level organization.  </s>
<s> This layout provides some more explicit grouping of success criteria under their respective checkpoints as well as changes the order in which the information is presented by presenting the techniques available for addressing a particular success criteria before querying the user for pass/fail decisions.  </s>
<s> Additionally, this layout provides additional space for an author or reviewer to include notes as to how a success criteria passed, failed, or did not apply.  </s>
<s> Next steps: *Paul has been working with some of the ideas surrounding creating static and interactive renderings of the checklist document and will be posting a follow-up note describing some of the issues and ideas we've addressed thus far.  </s>
<s> *Wendy will create a page to add to the above collection of links that will show how an author might utilize the checklists to evaluate a page or site.  </s>
<s> *A number of organizational changes will need to be made to the current working draft in order to effectively refer to individual success criteria.  </s>
<s> *Once we have consensus on how the checklists will take shape, a transformation to automate the process of pulling the appropriate information from the guidelines and techniques documents will need to be developed so that we can easily update the checklist as each source documents evolves.  </s>
<s> *We'd also like to tie in some of the work that is being done at W3C in the internationalization group regarding implementation guidelines to generate more dynamic views of the checklist.  </s>
<s> Richard Ishida, who is a W3C team member and has had some experience developing implementation guidelines for Xerox has been sharing some of his philosophies about creating checklists with us recently and we're hoping to collaborate further with him to explore some ideas for creating document views that are somewhat more interactive and flexible.  </s>
<s> An example of this might be to utilize an expanding/collapsing mechanism that would allow users to drill down through the checklist, exposing, for example techniques for a given success criteria one at a time.  </s>
<s> Discussion on this topic is on the Agenda for the September 5 Telecon.  </s>

<s> Ben has raised a number of significant questions in his summary.  </s>
<s> By way of contribution to this discussion, I have several personal opinions to offer, as usual.  </s>
<s> These are placed before the group for discussion and debate, as necessary.  </s>
<s> 1.  </s>
<s> I think "dynamically-generated" presentations would be preferable, if they can be implemented given the resources available to the group.  </s>
<s> For example, if I am evaluating a web site that uses a given combination of technologies, I should be able to generate a checklist that specifies all of the techniques relevant to my situation, with references to the success criteria that they satisfy.  </s>
<s> Alternatively, if I am writing an authoring tool which implements a given technology and I want to ascertain what techniques should be followed in order that my tool can produce highly accessible output that meets WCAG 2.0, then I will need a checklist that is restricted just to the technology in question.  </s>
<s> 2. Ben inquired how technologies which, individually, aren't relevant to all of the checkpoints should be treated.  </s>
<s> One solution would be, instead of taking each technology separately, to write techniques which presuppose that certain technologies are used in combination with each other.  </s>
<s> For example, XHTML is typically used with one or more audio or image formats, and with a style language (usually, but not always, CSS), so it might be better to combine the relevant techniques and examples under the assumption that certain types of technology are typically used together.  </s>
<s> If this combining could take place automatically it could be very flexible indeed, and such a possibility might be worth investigating further.  </s>
<s> CSS is a good example of a technology for which there are techniques, but it is always used in conjunction with XML or HTML.  </s>
<s> The conformance claim would be made in respect of the combined XML/XHTML/HTML/CSS etc., content; and it should be easy for an author to obtain a checklist that recognizes this fact.  </s>
<s> I don't want to work through one checklist for XHTML, another for CSS, etc., but rather to complete a single, unified checklist relevant just to the technologies which I have chosen.  </s>
<s> Whether this desire can be practically managed remains an open question, but we should at least consider the issue.  </s>
<s> 3. Regarding the review requirements in the level 2 success criteria, by definition there aren't any "hard and fast" rules for determining whether the content has the indicated characteristics; this is why the success criteria say that a review must be carried out (taking into account the information we provide), and, on that basis, an opinion formed.  </s>
<s> The review should be undertaken according to a consistent process and may involve testing with actual users (cf.  </s>
<s> Appendix B of the latest internal draft).  </s>
<s> We may be able to provide advice in the techniques on how to conduct such reviews.  </s>
<s> Beyond that, I don't think definite technology-specific techniques can be laid down; if they can, then they ought to serve as the basis of further success criteria in the guidelines proper.  </s>
<s> The Education and Outreach working group, as I recall, has been working on issues of content evaluation and may have advice to give regarding "best practice" in the conduct of qualitative reviews.  </s>
<s> Also, we can offer (technology-specific) examples of what we regard as exemplary.  </s>
<s> 4. As already indicated, I think we should distinguish carefully between techniques and examples.  </s>
<s> When Wendy and I reviewed the guidelines last November to gain an overview of how they related to the techniques, we discovered that there were many issues best addressed in "core" techniques, without referring to any specific technology, but for which we could also provide technology-specific examples.  </s>
<s> Thus, an explanation of how to write a good text equivalent (checkpoint 1.1) need not refer to any particular technology, but we can certainly provide examples of how checkpoint 1.1 as a whole is implemented in specific technologies, for example SVG or XHTML.  </s>
<s> There aren't so many points in the guidelines at which technology-specific advice is needed (what I mean is that they tend to relate to certain checkpoints in the docment, e.g., under guidelines 1 and 2, less so in guidelines 3 and 4, and again in guideline 5, to make a broad generalization here).  </s>
<s> 5. It has sometimes been suggested that the WCAG 2.0 techniques should state explicitly which techniques, in which combinations, are regarded as satisfying specific success criteria, and which ought instead to be considered as alternatives.  </s>
<s> To be specific, implementors want to know, for example, that a given success criterion can be satisfied by implementing either technique A, or techniques B and C together.  </s>
<s> This kind of information is essential.  </s>
<s> I don't have a firm opinion on whether alternatives should be prioritized.  </s>
<s> Obviously, selection among alternative techniques is likely to be governed not only by technological factors (issues of user agent baseline, checkpoint 5.2) but also the author's design preferences more generally.  </s>
<s> I would argue that each technique which relies on a particular feature of a technology should indicate, at least, the version of the technology in which the relevant features first became available.  </s>
<s> Whether filtering can be carried out with respect to this information depends on how we set up the dynamic checklist generation system, which appears to me increasingly to take the form of a data base with a prescribed set of fields for each technique.  </s>
<s> I think that covers many of the issues which Ben raised.  </s>
<s> Thanks, Ben, for getting out the information about the checklists.  </s>
<s> I have been working on a prototype "gateway" interface for accessing the checklists.  </s>
<s> We decided to present things in a step-wise fashion.  </s>
<s> On the first page, the user selects whether to access a static or an interactive version of the technology checklists, On the next page, the user selects which technologies to include (e.g. HTML, CSS, script, etc.).  </s>
<s> Along the way, the user can also choose to create a custom checklist (either static or interactive).  </s>
<s> Just so you know, when I say "static checklist" I mean a version of the checklist which is best suited to online viewing and/or printing out on paper.  </s>
<s> When I say "interactive checklist" I mean a form-based version of the checklist which the user can fill out, submit, and then receive a conformance report or rating, along with the necessary EARL markup which can then be included in the page or site itself.  </s>
<s> We have not created these interactive forms.  </s>
<s> I have only created the gateway to them.  </s>
<s> When I created these prototypes, I did not do an XSL conversion, though we'd like to do XSL in the final version.  </s>
<s> So, in light of the fact that I had to copy and paste everything, I did not create a complete checklist.  </s>
<s> I only did the first three guidelines, with their corresponding checkpoints success criteria.  </s>
<s> Even so, you can see that the documents become quite long.  </s>
<s> Also, you'll notice that I just copied and pasted the techniques from 1.1 into all of the success criteria.  </s>
<s> I did this just so that we could have some place-holder content in the techniques.  </s>
<s> (Copying, pasting, and formatting all of that information would have been too time-consuming.) You'll also notice that not all of the text in my "gateway pages" is linked yet, again, due to the large amount of time it would take to generate all of the corresponding documents.  </s>
<s> Lastly, you'll notice that the checklist that I created is somewhat different from both of the versions that Ben referenced in his email earlier.  </s>
<s> My version is simply another conceptualization of the same basic idea.  </s>
<s> At some point we'll have to choose between conceptualizations and then refine the one that we choose.  </s>
<s> Ok. With that preamble, here is the link to the first step in the gateway pages: Follow all of the active links in these documents to get the big picture  </s>
<s> of how the system fits together.  </s>

<s> Hi, i think that would be important to have two kinds of checklist: a full checklist as for the WCAG 1.0 and one interactive.  </s>
<s> This second options is due for the users that prefer to have a "Step-by-step" guide for reach the correct level for accessibility claim.  </s>
<s> The option to have a "full checklist" is still there.  </s>
<s> But the issue is that there is more than one type of full checklist.  </s>
<s> For example, you could have a checklist with every success criterion for every conformance level with all techniques for all technologies (this would be a *HUGE* document).  </s>
<s> You could also have a checklist with every success criterion for every level *without* any technology-specific techniques (you can see this option by going to the main gateway page--http://www.webaim.org/wcag/checklist/step1--then  </s>
<s> clicking on "pre-configured static checklists", then choosing "general - all conformance levels").  </s>
<s> Similarly, you could have every success criterion and every level with only HTML, and so on, through all of the technologies.  </s>
<s> As you can see, there is not really one checklist that fits every  </s>
<s> situation, but it is still possible to generate one generic checklist (without technology-specific information) which includes all success criteria and all levels.  </s>
<s> I think that this is what you are referring to.  </s>
<s> If it is not, then you'll have to clarify.  </s>
