<s> This was prompted by 37signals, my favorite web agency, launching a XHTML/CSS redesign today.  </s>
<s> Why not start a collection of standards-compliant sites?  </s>
<s> You know, have a linkdrop where we post standards-compliant sites and people can go to one resource to see working examples of what the evangelists are talking about,  </s>
<s> the way k10k-type portals showcase what's going on in the design community.  </s>
<s> It's one thing to read the tutorials and try stuff out in your own backyard, but it's great to see what other people cook up too.  </s>
<s> I know my personal interests lie in finding commercial, non-experimental sites like 37signals that put their money where their mouth is.  </s>
<s> The only other company  </s>
<s> like that I've come across was from a Zeldman link a while back, Good idea?  </s>
<s> Al Abut  </s>
<s> I agree ... and we are starting a links database at www.studiowhiz.com  </s>
<s> one of the catagories slated is the XHTML, CSS built sites.  </s>
<s> I'll let you know when this goes live I've also just rebuilt www.kiwi-interactive.com to complete XHTML Strict and CSS.  </s>
<s> This little project is my company site.  </s>
<s> I'm going to use it as a living example of Standards Based site design.  </s>
<s> As I learn more, and push my own boundaries it will change.  </s>
<s> I've yet to add more graphical designs to this.  </s>
<s> The one thing I find...this is me wearing my designer hat for a moment.  </s>
<s> 99% of XHTML &amp; CSS driven sites that I 've seen look very similar and have really lacking imagry.  </s>
<s> You mention k10k ... okay I personally think it's icky .. BUT ... look at the graphically RICH interface there.  </s>
<s> How on EARTH do you rebuild that AS IT IS using standards based HTML?  </s>
<s> IE: no tables!  </s>
<s> I'd love to be able to do this .contentCELL  </s>
<s> {  </s>
<s> top-right-corner: 1px curve green; top-left-corner: 1px square green; border: 1px solid green; bottom-left-corner: 1px curve green; bottom-right-corner: 1px square green; Or similar to enable more "designy" type interfaces like K10K.  </s>
<s> The most common thing I run into is that XHTML &amp; CSS sites are often boring.  </s>
<s> So I'm all for finding really AWESOMELY designed standards based sites, to show that these too can appeal to designers.  </s>

<s> i don't think it would be too difficult -- the k10k uses a lot of graphical titles and other text items, which you can position absolutely on the screen.  </s>
<s> for html-based text, you could use iframe content blocks, which would allow you to absolutely define both the height and width of the content area.  </s>
<s> no worrying about stretchy content.  </s>
<s> and, to support the absolute positioning of all items on the page, you could launch k10k in a separate browser window, with the height and width of the window defined.  </s>
<s> am pretty sure that they already down browser-sniffing and css stylesheet swapping for netscape and ie users to begin with...  </s>
<s> who knows... maybe we could get 37 signals to do a "37betterK10K" site for showcasing this.  </s>
<s> they just did a css/xhtml overhaul of their own site.  </s>
