<s> According to the current spec (12 Nov 2003 public draft as well as 25 March 2004 internal draft) the following is a type error: xs:yearMonthDuration("P2Y") * 2 Multiplication of a duration by a double is allowed, but not by an integer.  </s>
<s> There is no rule anywhere that causes the integer to be promoted to an xs:double in this situation.  </s>

<s> Mike: I made the same point in my mail on 3/11.  </s>
<s> It seems to me that we need numeric promotion rules for operators just like we have for functions.  </s>

<s> Doesn't the mapping to an op: function trigger the promotion rules?  </s>
<s> Thanks Michael  </s>
<s> It would if it got that far.  </s>
<s> But the rules for arithmetic expressions in 3.4 reject this combination of operands during the process of searching for an op: function, so it never gets as far as identifying a function to be called, let alone calling it.  </s>
