Bonjour Karl, I suggest rearranging the sentences for the introduction (more or less): 
"Whether you are a manager, a Web developer, a Marketing or Communications team member, or perhaps an individual Web master, you have read about the interest in Web standards from many sources. 
You have understood that standards are beneficial for your Web site in terms of cost savings, ease of management and profitability, and so you have decided to switch - and employ standards within your Web site. 
Unfortunately, you haven't found a guide which explains the proceesses of where to begin and how to organise this transition of your Web site to being standards-compliant. 
You might think that having a large Web site makes this objective unattainable. 
If you are unsure about what Web standards are, we encourage you to read about what Web standards really mean [WEB-QUALITY], how to purchase and develop a quality Web site [REQ-WEBAGENCY], and why an accessible Web site [WAI-PROFIT] is profitable. 
The method that we propose in this document is valid for Web sites of any size; it will suit your needs whether you are managing an individual, small business or a large corporate Web site. 
We will guide you through the individual steps - all of which you will be able to fulfill individually - from the analysis of your existing Web site to the organization of your new Web site. 
Each of these steps have been designed to be separate, and can be undertaken at various times, different levels, by different persons regardless of their skill level, but in accordance to a workflow." 
I just feel that rearranging these sentences give the first paragraph more "punch", and is thus perhaps more effective because it addresses the audience more. 
:) Thoughts? 
Regards, -steph 
done.
