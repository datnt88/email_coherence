<s> -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- Hash: SHA1 I'm considering of creating an english version of my website (currently there's only a dutch version), but I have never done something like this before.  </s>
<s> ~ My idea about it was to create a page like 'index.php' (i'll call this the languageselector) which uses the http-request to decide wether to serve the dutch or the english version, using a redirect, for the english version to index.en.php and for the dutch to index.nl.php.  </s>
<s> I would create a languageselector for every page, so that i would have three files for every page: 'page.php',  </s>
<s> 'page.en.php', 'page.nl.php'.  </s>
<s> Is this a good idea or are there better/other ways for doing this?  </s>
<s> Are there maybe some 'ready made' solutions for this?  </s>

<s> Perhaps this is a good time for us all to rethink our positions.  </s>
<s> Might it not be so that organisations - like the UN - who do not use language negotiation do so because they are clearly less knowledgeable than those who chose to spend their time following this list - and our esteemed colleague Kevin here illustrate that not even here everyone knows these techniques.  </s>
<s> What we need to do is what David and I do daily: teach.  </s>
<s> This is one case where "Those who can, teach; those who can't should listen" applies.  </s>
<s> There is a growing awareness of the fact that access to information is  </s>
<s> difficult - impossible even - to some groups among us.  </s>
<s> Let us try to teach people to use the technology we have today for the best result, instead of bickering over what might be.  </s>
<s> To quote mom: "Spit in one hand and wish in the other, and see where you get the most".  </s>
<s> "Dissing" the Accept-Language header and inventing a number of more or less esoteric methods to deal with the same problem is wishing, and not for anything nice.  </s>
<s> And to Kevin - bravo.  </s>

<s> In the first place, even in the absence of explicit user choice, the browser already has a clue based on the language set in the operating system and desktop.  </s>
<s> In the second place (and in the real world), ISPs and system administrators will pre-configure language preferences to local norms on behalf of users.  </s>
<s> And as others have pointed out, it's a simple configuration option for those who can use a menu.  </s>

<s> In my real world there live a lot of people whose native language is not that of the country they live in.  </s>
<s> (In Amsterdam alone, 45% of residents are of non-Dutch origin.)  </s>
<s> In that real world, people go to a store to buy a computer for themselves; what they get is a machine pre-configured with an operating system and browser set to the (main) language of the country they live in (often preconfigured to use a particular ISP as well).  </s>
<s> No administrator in sight.  </s>
<s> Just how do those people even find out there is such a thing as a language preference?  </s>

<s> My downstairs neighbor, who is Mexican, never had a clue she could set her *keyboard* to use Spanish instead of Dutch.  </s>
<s> She shares the computer with her daughter who is more fluent in Dutch than in Spanish.  </s>
<s> Even if they know they can set the browser to a language preference - which would they choose?  </s>
<s> Their browser certainly doesn't have a clue what their preferences are.  </s>

<s> If we use the language preferences sent by the user agent to select a default language (and present an obvious option on that page to select other languages): * Users who know how to use their software get the language they want and do not have to find their language from the provided options.  </s>
<s> - Benefit  </s>
<s> * Users who don't know how to use configure their preference get a sensible default which would probably be their preference if they had actively chosen.  </s>
<s> - Benefit  </s>
<s> * Users who don't know how to change their preference AND for whom the default is suboptimal can select a different language from the aforementioned obvious option.  </s>
<s> - Slight negative  </s>
<s> * Users who don't know how to change their preference AND for whom the default is suboptimal AND who fail to noticed the obvious option can almost certainly cope with the default language anyway.  </s>
<s> - Slight negative  </s>
<s> * Users who don't know about the preference, fail to spot the option to change language, and can't cope with their default are likely to be a very tiny minority.  </s>
<s> - Serious negative, but probably only affecting a number of people that tends towards zero.  </s>
<s> If we ignore the language preferences sent by the user agent then *all* users must actively identify the option for their language in the list and select it.  </s>
<s> So, in summary: Using the accept language header removes the need to actively select the language from the great majority of users at the cost of slightly reducing the ease of selecting a different language for the minority.  </s>
<s> I'm of the opinion that the increased difficulty is minimal and will only effect a small minority of users and thus it is worth paying attention to the accept language header.  </s>
<s> I would like to see some evidence as to how many people would be negatively effected by this (i.e. how many people are ignorant of the language preferences and would set them to something other then the default should that be otherwise) and how much extra difficulty it would cause them to identify the obvious language selection option (this would depend on the specifics of the implementation of that option, which has not yet been discussed in this thread).  </s>

<s> People who know how to use *their* software may not be using *their* software but someone else's - and be polite enough to leave its settings alone.  </s>
<s> In fact, in some settings, configuration of the software may be impossible because it was set up that way precisely to *prevent* people changing the settings.  </s>
<s> Think of libraries, schools, Internet cafes.  </s>
<s> - negative UNLESS a web site provides an option to choose language  </s>
<s> I have already addressed that in the post you are replying to: many people do *not* get a sensible default.  </s>
<s> Negative - but whether it is "slight" depends on the number of people involved.  </s>
<s> Don't agree - your "almost certainly" assumes an amount of fluency in the default language that is very often not present.  </s>
<s> Where I live, that is not a small minority.  </s>
<s> Maybe where *you* live, but not where *I* live.  </s>
<s> Sounds like a good idea - because that way at least people *will* find out (you did not address my question which you quoted: Just how do those people even find out there is such a thing as a language preference?).  </s>
<s> I don't agree with your "great majority".  </s>
<s> A majority, true, but it may not be all that great.  </s>
<s> See above - I don't agree with "small minority".  </s>
<s> I'd also like to see how many people don't know about this setting.  </s>
<s> I'll make a prediction though: a very large majority.  </s>
