I'm using a dual-processor HP Kayak (kayuck) running Windows 2000. 
I downloaded the installer for version 5.2 of the Amaya Windows NT distribution (amaya-WindowsNT-5.2.exe) and it installed just fine. 
However, the application failed to launch and/or give any feedback (error messages, events, etc.). 
When double-clicking on the icon or shortcut, it appears as though nothing happens at all. 
I am a developer and not entirely unfamiliar with getting programs to run, but I was unable to achieve success with this particular distribution. 
However, out of desperation, I downloaded the Windows 98 version (amaya-Windows95-5.2.exe) and to my surprise the application ran just fine! 
I have subsequently confirmed that re-installing the NT version still doesn't work and the 98 version still does work. 
Just thought you'd like to know... Same here on Windows XP. 
So it looks like it's something wrng with the NT package. 
Live long and prosper! 
I hope the new package 5.2a fixes that problem. 
Sorry for the inconvenience Irene. 
Works fine now :). 
Live long and prosper! 
These packages were buggy. 
You have to re-download the today package amaya-WindowsNT-5.2a.exe. 
It's the same version but Windows packages were regenerated. 
Sorry for the inconvenience. 
Irene.
