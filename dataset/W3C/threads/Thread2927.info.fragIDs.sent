<s> Browsing 2617, I came across: credentials = auth-scheme #auth-param Is this missing a 1*SP?  </s>

<s> My understanding is that since auth-scheme ends with a token and auth-param starts with a token, LWS is implied by the BNF: implied *LWS The grammar described by this specification is word-based.  </s>
<s> Except where noted otherwise, linear white space (LWS) can be included between any two adjacent words (token or quoted-string), and between adjacent words and separators, without changing the interpretation of a field.  </s>
<s> At least one delimiter (LWS and/or separators) MUST exist between any two tokens (for the definition of "token" below), since they would otherwise be interpreted as a single token.  </s>
<s> However, for consistency and readability reasons, it should probably be made explicit, like in the challenge case: challenge = auth-scheme 1*SP 1#auth-param Alex.  </s>
<s> Ah thanks.  </s>
<s> I missed that, and was led down the garden path by challenge, as you suggest.  </s>
<s> I agree that it should be made explicit, especially since this convention is imported from 2616, even though it doesn't appear to be relied upon as much there.  </s>
