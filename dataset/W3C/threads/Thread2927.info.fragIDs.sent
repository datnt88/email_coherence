Browsing 2617, I came across: credentials = auth-scheme #auth-param Is this missing a 1*SP?

My understanding is that since auth-scheme ends with a token and auth-param starts with a token, LWS is implied by the BNF: implied *LWS The grammar described by this specification is word-based. 
Except where noted otherwise, linear white space (LWS) can be included between any two adjacent words (token or quoted-string), and between adjacent words and separators, without changing the interpretation of a field. 
At least one delimiter (LWS and/or separators) MUST exist between any two tokens (for the definition of "token" below), since they would otherwise be interpreted as a single token. 
However, for consistency and readability reasons, it should probably be made explicit, like in the challenge case: challenge = auth-scheme 1*SP 1#auth-param Alex. 
Ah thanks. 
I missed that, and was led down the garden path by challenge, as you suggest. 
I agree that it should be made explicit, especially since this convention is imported from 2616, even though it doesn't appear to be relied upon as much there.
