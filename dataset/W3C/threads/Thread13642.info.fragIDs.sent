<s> There's no such thing as "accessible or not".  </s>
<s> Accessibility doesn't exist in a vacuum -- this should either say "to which audiences the site is accessible or inaccessible" or "if a Web site is in compliance with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines."  </s>
<s> I think the latter phrase is closer to the work that's been done.  </s>
<s> to make it easier for Web content developers to repair inaccessible Web sites.  </s>
<s> The working group does this by maintaining a list of existing tools, developing new tools, and documenting techniques that tools may implement.  </s>
<s> Hmm. Still thinking about this one.  </s>
<s> Thanks for doing this, Wendy, and getting the ball rolling!  </s>
