I took an action in today's meeting to rewrite the mission statement in the charter. 
How's this? 
The mission of the Evaluation and Repair Tools Working Group (ER WG) is: to make it easier for Web content developers to determine if a Web site is accessible and when it is not, 
There's no such thing as "accessible or not". 
Accessibility doesn't exist in a vacuum -- this should either say "to which audiences the site is accessible or inaccessible" or "if a Web site is in compliance with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines." 
I think the latter phrase is closer to the work that's been done. 
to make it easier for Web content developers to repair inaccessible Web sites. 
The working group does this by maintaining a list of existing tools, developing new tools, and documenting techniques that tools may implement. 
Hmm. Still thinking about this one. 
Thanks for doing this, Wendy, and getting the ball rolling!

Kynn, 
Good comment. 
The mission statement now reads, The mission of the Evaluation and Repair Tools Working Group (ER WG) is: to make it easier for Web content developers to determine if Web content conforms to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0, 
to make it easier for Web content developers to repair Web content that 
does not conform to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0. 
The working group does this by maintaining a list of existing tools, 
developing new tools, and documenting techniques that tools may implement. 
This work is part of the WAI Technical Activity. 
The original charter for 
this group was approved June 1998. 
This work continues the work of that charter as well as pieces from the Evaluation and Repair Interest Group charter. 
The Interest Group no longer exists. 
Does the above change alleviate your concerns for this one?

I suggest a slight rewording to sharpen the focus (new words between asterisks): "...make it easier for Web content developers to *test whether* Web content conforms..." Dick Brown Program Manager, Web Accessibility Microsoft Corp. www.microsoft.com/enable

"conforms to guidelines" is not exactly defined: what is defined is conforming to particular compliance levels, A, double A, triple A, or checkpoints. 
How about adding word "checkpoints" so it reads like this: The mission of the Evaluation and Repair Tools Working Group (ER WG) is: to make it easier for Web content developers to determine if Web content conforms to checkpoints in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0, 
to make it easier for Web content developers to repair Web content that 
does not meet WCAG checkpoints. 
This more obviously includes tools that focus on a subset of the checkpoints rather than the whole guidelines, e.g. tablin.

I have left it as "determine" because the author isn't necessarily performing the tests, per se; the tool is. 
The author may just be looking at the information from the tool (as with the WAVE) to determine if their page conforms. 
thanks for the suggestion, tho.
