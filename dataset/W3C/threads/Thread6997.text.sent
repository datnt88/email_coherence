since they'll probably know better...) (b) support for [URNs] is available in popular browsers and has been for several generations Just curious - how do browsers support URNs? 
I didn't follow URN development closely, but always thought that it was poorly supported. 
Me too -- I'd also be curious on what it does with the URIs, and how it knows what to do (hard coded or does it look it up somehow?). [ Aaron Swartz | me@aaronsw.com

Thru various hooks, esp HTTP proxying... 
It is likewise recommended that, where a protocol allows for retrieval by URL, that the client software have provision for being configured to use specific gateway locators for indirect access through new naming schemes. 
-- RFC 1630 URIs in WWW June 1994 from http://www.w3.org/Addressing/schemes#hack-schemes 
Unfortunately, in NS4.x, this only works for urn: , not for all absolute URIs that follow the right syntax. 
For details, see as a bug (#2110) and it's fixed in mozilla. 
I hear there's something related called protozilla, but I don't know the details. 
Internet explorer also has support for URI scheme extensiblity. 
see #hack-schemes above for details. 
Konqueror had some minor bugs; I reported those, and I think they're being fixed. 
In general, the clients are getting better. 
oded or does it look it up somehow?). 
It's just a local proxy mechanism. 
There are designs for new ubiquitous services for URN resolution, but (a) they're not widely deployed, and (b) the well-designed ones work for all URIs... just as well to make http: URIs more robust as to make urn:'s work.

(b) support for [URNs] is available in popular browsers and has been for several generations Just curious - how do browsers support URNs? 
I didn't follow URN development closely, but always thought that it was poorly supported. 
Only recently have browsers gotten the idea that URI schemes need to be extensible (I.E. was one of the first to get it right). 
Currently they all require a plugin of some type to handle any new schemes (URNs being just one scheme amongst many). 
We are releasing a much more robust URN plugin for I.E. at the end of this month (LGPL license). 
URN support in browsers is sketchy at best (mainly because they thought there was a standard when there wasn't). 
Netscape prior to 6.0 will attempt to send all URNs to its configured http proxy. 
I.E. will just tell you there's no such URI scheme handler. 
I'm not sure about Konquerer, and others (Opera is based on Netscape). 
My hope is that the URI resolution services that are based on DDDS will provide a mechanism for gatewaying to new URI schemes even if the current application doesn't support them natively. 
Part of the problem is that so far the only two people developing URN software has been myself and Justin Couch. 
Everyone has been sitting on the sidelines expecting it to get done. 
We are releasing everything as open source so _please_ help us out by grabbing the code and adding on to it and integrating it into other applications.

Protozilla [1] is a plug-in (not strictly... 
I think they call it a socket adaptor or something) for Netscape6 that allows one to associate certain protocols with a particular action on ones computer: just what you've been looking for, according to:- The two on my personal to-do list are mid: and irc:.

More information about Protozilla is available from [1] which I have pointed out numerous times before after being introduced to it by Aaron (who will almost certainly have sent a similar letter to this by the time I'm through writing). 
Downloads [2] and examples [3] are also available. 
Protozilla also carries with it certain disadvantages: it makes it way too easy for people to start using URI schemes as redirects, e.g. myscheme:ABC could be used to reference starting to use wiki: already :-) [1] http://protozilla.mozdev.org/
