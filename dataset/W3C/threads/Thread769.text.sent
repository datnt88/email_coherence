hello Dave Raggett, i have attached a copy of a test html in which Tidy warns me about the attrib. 
xml:lang="en" in the HTML tag. 
According to this Page { http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/REC-xhtml1-20000126/#normative } section 3.1.1 
in the example provided (in green), this is completely fine.. is it a bug?

I testet your XHTML-document but tidy sayed Tidy (vers 4th August 2000) Parsing "test.html" 
test.html: 
Doctype given is "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" test.html: 
Document content looks like XHTML 1.0 Transitional no warnings or errors were found I had had this error, too but now I am using tidy (release date: 4th August 2000). 
But I think the tags and attributes should be lowercase: !DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd" html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="en" lang="en" www.w3.org" / New DB Table link href="css/looks.css" 
rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" / Create a new DB table form method="POST" action="show_def.php" 
size="30" / Number of Fields [1-9] input type="text" src="imgs/Ssubmit.gif" 
border="0" alt="[go to step 2]" / You can use "tidy -indent -wrap -clean -modify -asxml *.htm*" to do this with all your HTML ands XHTML documents. 
Regards, Max Moritz Sievers A fair number of messages here take some trouble to distinguish between different versions of tidy.exe (the Win32 binary). 
Other messages exhibit varying degrees of conscious or unconscious confusion about which version is which. 
As I'm a non-programmer and haven't contributed anything whatever to the development of Tidy, any suggestion of mine for it might well be impertinent (as well as uninformed and stupid). 
But FW-little-IW: Yes, when you run the program you can see which version it is. 
But in addition to this, how about distributing the binary not simply as tidy.exe but instead compressed within tidy20000430.zip 
(expressing the date), tidy143.zip 
(expressing the version [and, not knowing which version it is, I've chosen "1.43" at random]), or similar? 
Yours ignorantly but always appreciatively.

Then I have to change every script in which tidy occurs. 
But the distribution-package is already with version/date. 
I use Debian GNU/Linux. 
If you want to use differnt versions the same time, you can rename the binary yourself. 
Regards, Max Moritz Sievers Differentiating versions is certainly important, as many bugs are fixed and new features are added in each release of HTML Tidy. 
On a number of occasions, someone reporting a problem has been using an older version, and their problem had been fixed in the latest release. 
Platforms, too, are important, as some behaviors (e.g., implicit configuration files) are specific to certain platforms. 
Those are two vital pieces of information that help list members help others. 
I cannot see any suggestion for improving the product as being impertinent or stupid (uninformed...perhaps, as to the utility of the enhancement or the level of difficulty involved in its implementation). 
Please always feel free to suggest anything that might yield a better Tidy! Versioning an archive containing the executable would, perhaps, be helpful in ensuring that the current version was downloaded (the source archives are already so versioned). 
For example, until recently the Win32 executable available from the Tidy site was the April 2000 version -- two versions out of date. 
A versioned archive of the executable might have prevented that particular problem. 
However, one advantage to distributing the executable directly, instead of encapsulated in an archive, is that it does not require the presence of, e.g., WinZip on the user's Win32 platform. 
The program is ready to run once downloaded. 
But the problem that you cite is really that folks don't report their version, etc., when posting problems. 
As you note, Tidy reports its version when it runs, but often people fail to provide that information when sending messages to the list. 
I'm unsure how versioning an executable archive would help that specifically.

On renaming, Max Moritz Sievers: Well, first I had the Windows rather than the Linux binary in mind. 
But secondly I didn't intend to suggest renaming the binary, but instead renaming the package (.ZIP file, etc.) in which it was distributed. 
(As I reread my message, it does seem a bit unclear; and my title was very misleading. 
Sorry about that.) J. David Bryan (whom I thank for his tolerance of my ignorance): I think so. 
Moreover, while I don't think dates are inherently easier to remember than version numbers -- after all, most of us have been talking of dates since we were barely out of our prams -- I for one find it easier to remember that the version I use of Becky is 2.00 whereas the one I use of Tidy is, um, well.

Very true, but I think everyone who's willing to use a console-mode program with a plethora of switches -- surely well under 20% of the world population of Windows-using drones! 
-- is happy with the .ZIP 
format. 
Moreover, there are free alternatives to WinZIP. 
(As for me, I'm equally happy with .gz or any of a host of alternatives.) Peter Evans evans@i.hosei.ac.jp
