The following request arises from experience within W3C. 
When tidying a document where there are links with name attributes which start with digits, Tidy adds an id attribute but doesn't warn about invalid values. 
ID values can't start with digits.

So you suggest adding something like the following? 
if (name is no valid ID) ReportWarning "cannot add id attribute, invalid ID '1foo'" else add_id_to_element Should we warn about names that cannot be IDs in general? 
Agree. 
Whenever copying a name attribute to an id, it probably makes sense to validate the id value. 
Definitely for XHTML (or any XML), anyway.
