DanC: I've completed the changes you requested to and removed draft status and final @@'s The next step is to send to the director, copying chairs - right? 
Do I send the doc, or a link? 
The request looks different to others I see in the archive, so I'm checking. 
It makes no mention of satisfying dependencies as required by process doc [1] - thats ok - right. 
It doesn't suggest a timescale for review as the recent XML Core request does. 
EDs: The request to advance contains status info about edits still in progress. 
Please verify these are correct. 
I think they are and will go ahead as soon I've verified the process, if I don't hear form you. Brian [1] http://www.w3.org/2003/06/Process-20030618/process.html#transition-reqs 
Test cases, no further edits to do (to the best of my knowledge). 
That is, all the outstanding actions and editorial stuff arising from LC2 is done.

snip To be precise, the Primer will also include editorial updates in response to the first message from Martin, which also arrived 7 November. 
(This message is the one pointed to by the "raised" link on issue "i18n-comments" assigned to Concepts; but some of the comments in that message were directed at Primer). 
--Frank I took a quick look at v 1.36; looks good. 
yes. 
Copy w3c-semweb-cg if you like. 
I'd send a text version of the document plus a link. 
That's less than ideal. 
Ideally, we'd enumerate dependencies under "summary of review", but I'm reasonably confident we did in fact resolve our dependencies (esp. 
I18N, WebOnt, XML Schema) and we can supply details on request. 
Was the XML Core request a CR request? 
The time for a PR review is set in the process document: 4 weeks.

The text there uses the continuous present "are being integrated" which could now say "have been integrated" as the process is finally finished, given Herman's message Pat IHMC(850)434 8903 or (650)494 3973 home 40 South Alcaniz St.(850)202 4416 office FL 32501(850)291 0667 cell phayes@ihmc.us
