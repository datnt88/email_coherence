topic from open directory. 
I can imagine how this works in SKOS. 
And 
how we might represent Bristol as a place in RDF. 
For discussion: how to represent (to machines) the connection between these two worlds. 
We could easily redo the open directory (dmoz, see in SKOS. 
And we can doubtless find some RDF representation of Bristol as 
a member of a class "City", with location info, population, etc... My hypothesis is that a new property in SKOS, skos:conceptualizes, could be used to relate bristol-the-skos-concept to bristol-the-thing-in-the-world. 
Al, what do you reckon?

Would you call this resource a "subject indicator", to use topic maps dialect? 
As an on'n off ODP editor [1] I had proposed internally to have a look at integration of ODP in the SW framework. 
Not with a great feedback, actually. 
Remember that RDF dump of dmoz uses an old RDF 
format. 
... looks to me indeed very close to the notion of "subjet indicator".

I don't know enough about the detailed mysteries of topicmaps there, but certainly this seems close. 
It is, colloqially, a subject or topic, thought of a thing-in-itself, and distinct from both the thing(s) that topic represents, and from documents and data representing either the topic or the, er, subject of the topic. 
I give up! this terminology is too overloaded to say anything ;) 
Put another way... the "etc/England/Bristol/" node in the DMoz topic graph (and its equiv in SKOS) are things that represent "the concept/idea of the place Bristol", rather than representing Bristol directly. 
There is an additional level of indirection compared to 'raw' RDF (and OWL). 
Yep, it is pretty scruffy, was backed by very early RDF code from Guha and friends when at Netscape/Mozilla. 
There are scripts around to, rather minimally, fix it up (namespace URIs, character encoding, etc). 
Those scripts could probably be adapted to emit SKOS rather easily. 
I suspect so too. 
Topicmap people have often said that RDF confuses things with their representations. 
I believe RDF allows such modelling errors to be made, but also that it allows perfect clarity. 
TMs, on my 
understanding, try to have more built-in facilities for preserving 
those distinctions. 
cheers,

Hmm ... trying to sort out terminology ... it's not that difficult, in fact :)) Let's say you have somewhere a formal representation of a Class "City" and an instance of it "Bristol". 
This can be expressed either in OWL-RDF ... .. or in Topic Maps XTM Now you want to say that the dmoz resource somehow "indicates" what the above abstract entity formally "represents" In XTM, this would be expressed by: subjectIndicatorRef xlink:href="http://dmoz.org/Regional/Europe/United_Kingdom/England/Bristol/"/ How you would do it in OWL is not standard ... 
Yes, that's exactly what the above XTM example expresses. 
Agreed. 
In fact there are too many different ways to express clearly any number of levels of indirection in RDF, but unfortunately no standard one. 
Hence the endless debates about URIs "meaning". 
Yes. That does not mean everyone using Topic Maps understand them - let alone those who won't even try to :)) Bottom line : what about "skos:subjectIndicator" to express what you suggest? 
For example: skos:subjectIndicator rdf:resource="http://dmoz.org/Regional/Europe/United_Kingdom/England/Bristol/"/ Say what?

Intriguing to notice (on the same page originally referneced) that the Open Directory has at least 5 subtly different "concept/ideas of the place Bristol" depending on whether the user approaches them via Gloucestershire, South Gloucs, Somerset, etc. 
You can tell they are different, because they have different numbers of postings. 
I suppose SKOS copes happily with representing them differently? 
NB, if you follow the traditional thesaurus model, the preferred term "Bristol" would be allowed to have only one meaning, and multiple access routes would be permitted using a polyhierarchical structure.
