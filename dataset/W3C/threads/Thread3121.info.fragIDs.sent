<s> Hmm ... trying to sort out terminology ... it's not that difficult, in fact :)) Let's say you have somewhere a formal representation of a Class "City" and an instance of it "Bristol".  </s>
<s> This can be expressed either in OWL-RDF ... .. or in Topic Maps XTM Now you want to say that the dmoz resource somehow "indicates" what the above abstract entity formally "represents" In XTM, this would be expressed by: subjectIndicatorRef xlink:href="http://dmoz.org/Regional/Europe/United_Kingdom/England/Bristol/"/ How you would do it in OWL is not standard ...  </s>
<s> Yes, that's exactly what the above XTM example expresses.  </s>
<s> Agreed.  </s>
<s> In fact there are too many different ways to express clearly any number of levels of indirection in RDF, but unfortunately no standard one.  </s>
<s> Hence the endless debates about URIs "meaning".  </s>
<s> Yes. That does not mean everyone using Topic Maps understand them - let alone those who won't even try to :)) Bottom line : what about "skos:subjectIndicator" to express what you suggest?  </s>
<s> For example: skos:subjectIndicator rdf:resource="http://dmoz.org/Regional/Europe/United_Kingdom/England/Bristol/"/ Say what?  </s>

<s> Intriguing to notice (on the same page originally referneced) that the Open Directory has at least 5 subtly different "concept/ideas of the place Bristol" depending on whether the user approaches them via Gloucestershire, South Gloucs, Somerset, etc.  </s>
<s> You can tell they are different, because they have different numbers of postings.  </s>
<s> I suppose SKOS copes happily with representing them differently?  </s>
<s> NB, if you follow the traditional thesaurus model, the preferred term "Bristol" would be allowed to have only one meaning, and multiple access routes would be permitted using a polyhierarchical structure.  </s>
