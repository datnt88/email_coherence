It seems that Internet Explorer and Netscape have wildly different ways of using this method. 
I would like to know which is correct... or at least more correct. 
As an example, in IE you would set an attribute as such: x.setAttribute("className","myclass") but in Netscape you would do something like: x.setAttribute("class","myclass") It appears that Netscape works of the string and applies the matching attribute, whereas Internet Explorer looks for a matching JS method?? 
I'm confused, please help.

Since version 4.0 of IE, our getAttribute() implementation has been focused on OM properties, not the actual html attributes. 
So, here are the ways to set a class: .bar 
{color:green} .foo 
{color:red} divEl = document.getElementById("d1"); 
//this works in nav6 and ie4 and later divEl.className 
= "bar"; //this works in nav6 but not ie divEl.setAttribute("class","bar"); 
//this works in ie but not nav6 divEl.setAttribute("className","bar"); 
We can consider fixing this in the future, however, most web authors probably want to use divEl.className until then since it has worked since IE4 and also works in Nav6.

That syntax should continue to work. 
That's the correct Javascript binding for the "className" IDL attribute which is used to manipulate the "class" HTML attribute. 
Similarly, divEl.setClassName("bar"); should work in Java, since that's the corresponding binding. 
However: //this works in nav6 but not ie divEl.setAttribute("class","bar"); 
_should_ work, since that's the correct syntax for accessing the "class" HTML attribute via the setAttribute operation, and //this works in ie but not nav6 divEl.setAttribute("className","bar"); should set the "className" HTML attribute rather than "class"... in other words, it should "work" but it does exactly what you told it to do, rather than what you intended it to do. 
I don't think there's any doubt about the DOM's intent in this regard. 
There may be some fuzziness in the wording. 
Is a FAQ entry needed?

I don't think we need an special entry for that. 
Not all the HTML IDL 
attributes can be mapped to an HTML attribute for various reasons (it is not an HTML atribute or it doesn't the same semantic or it doesn't have the same name). 
We probably don't want to make an entry for all of them. 
BTW, "class" is a reserved keyword in Java, a future reserved keyword in ECMAScript but it is not reserved in IDL.

Good enough, though there seems to be one very visible case of it being misunderstood... 
We can reconsider if it comes up more frequently.. 
Thanks. 
I wasn't remembering whether this was an IDL issue or a bindability issue... Joe Kesselman / IBM Research
