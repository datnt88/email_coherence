It depends upon whether a level 1 or a level 2 method is called. 
For level 1 methods, the qualified name is used. 
For level 2 methods, the localName ane namespaceURI. 
This means that, depending upon whether a level 1 or a level 1 method was called, a different node may be replaced when setting an attribute. 
This is why it is important that after the document is created in normalized form where both the qualified name and the localName/namespaceURI is unique (usually by a parser) you should only use level 1 or level 2 methods in your application -- not both as some people try to keep suggesting. 
This means that if you ever use namespaces, you should never use level 1 methods which have been superseded, even for those things which do not have a namespace. 
Instead you should use level 2 methods passing a null namespaceURI if there is no namespace.

Hi !! Here's my query!!! ........Can somebody help me out on this.......??? 
In DOM specification, an element's NamedNodeMap contains its attribute nodes. 
In DOM level 1,we use setNamedItem to retrieve a node from NamedNodeMap by its name. 
In DOM level 2 the setNamedItemNS method is used..., I wanted to know ....What should be the lookup key used to retrieve from NamedNodeMap? 
Is it qualifiedName (two-part name containing prefix and localName) or two-part name containing localName and namespaceURI? 
thanx in advance, regards Thara What should be the lookup key used to retrieve from NamedNodeMap? 
As a DOM implementer you have to support both: For getNamedItemNS(), the key is the localname and namespace URI. 
For getNamedItem(), the key is the qualified name. 
This provides backward compatability for DOM Level 1 applications.
