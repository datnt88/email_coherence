<s> Hi, If I create a link in a XHTML 1.0 Strict document, Amaya 8.5 (Win XP) let me set the "target" attribute for the a element, but W3C validator says that this attribute is not supported by the Strict document type.  </s>
<s> If I save and reload a document with a "target" attribute, Amaya does not shown any error message.  </s>
<s> Is it a bug?  </s>
<s> Best regards, Bartolom?  </s>
