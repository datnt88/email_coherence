The DOM Level 2 CSS spec says this about the CSSStyleDeclaration.getPropertyPriority() method: 
Used to retrieve the priority of a CSS property (e.g. the "important" qualifier) if the property has been explicitly set in this declaration block. 
Return Value: A string representing the priority (e.g. "important") if one exists. 
The empty string if none exists. 
My reading of the return value section is that if the property is 
specified, but has no priority, this method returns the empty string. 
It does not say what the return value is if the there is no explicit specification of the named property. 
This is troubling especially since 
the first sentence raises the question of whether the property is explicitly set or not. 
By analogy with other methods of the same interface, I assume that the empty string is returned in this case as well, but it would also be sensible for the method to return null in the case that the named property doesn't exist at all.

Philippe, Your proposed new wording is okay with me. 
I'd be even more explicit, however. 
For example: Return Value: A string representing the priority (e.g. "important") if the property has been explicitly set in this declaration block and has a priority specified. 
The empty string otherwise. 
David Flanagan 
right. 
I would expect it to return empty string and use getPropertyValue to check if a value was specified or not. 
What about this new wording? 
Used to retrieve the priority of a CSS property (e.g. the "important" qualifier) if the priority has been explicitly set in this declaration block. 
Return Value: A string representing the priority (e.g. "important") if the priority has been explicitly set in this declaration block. 
The empty string if not.
