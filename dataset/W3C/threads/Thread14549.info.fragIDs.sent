Before publishing a new working draft I need to add an abstract. 
What do people think of this: Abstract This Working Drafts is the first step towards incorporating feedback received on WCAG 1.0 since its publication in May 1999. 
Primarily, this is the first attempt to write checkpoints that may be applied to a wider range 
of languages and that may be understood by a more varied audience. 
Since this Working Draft builds on WCAG 1.0 it has the same aim: explain how to make Web content accessible to people with disabilities.

looks good to me. 
minor typo: In the first line "This Working Drafts" should be "This Working Draft" (no s). 
Fantastic.

Very nice. 
Do we want to say we are trying to make them apply to a wider range of technologies and understandable too? 
Then it might say we are trying to make them apply to a wider range of technologies and understandable to more varied audiences and in different languages?

Actually, I was "languages" instead of "technologies" not trying to say we are making this understandable to a wider variety of human spoken/signed/read languages. 
I will make this clearer by saying, "Primarily, this is the first attempt to write checkpoints that may be applied to a wider range of technologies and that may be understood by a more varied audience."

how about, Since the intial release of the WCAG 1.0 in May 1999, a wide audience has had the opportunity to review and implement the checkpoints. 
Therefore a working draft of the next version has been intiated with the goal to incorporate comments and to address implementation, additional languages so a wider audience may more easily understand the checkpoints. 
This Working Daft will also reduce the time and costs to review, understand and implement the checkpoints. 
As this Working Draft builds upon the WCAG 1.0, the objective has not changed and that is to 'explain how to make Web content accessible to people with disabilities and a wider audience through guidelines.' i took some liberties and i have my falk vest on smile

The first couple of sentences are good, but I would put them in the status section. 
The abstract just describes the content of the document, as I understand it. 
I would be less certain about whether this will reduce the cost and time, and particularly the cost. 
It might be smart to explain that is a goal, in status. 
(And I like the idea of a Working Daft - a typo in that sentence grin/ ).
