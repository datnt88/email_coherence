<s> I sent comments in [1] on this proposal.  </s>
<s> Ray's proposal is very thin on explanation for the uninitiated.  </s>
<s> I'm not sure how this proposal intersects with the subsequent discussion on 17 Jan [1].  </s>
<s> From your summary [3], it sounds like the ball's in the DOM WG's court to draft a more detailed proposal.  </s>

<s> I recently visited Microsoft (Mac IE), Netscape, Adobe, and Apple.  </s>
<s> I am hoping that as a result of these visits, we will receive evaluations of Mac IE, Netscape, Adobe's SVG Viewer, and Apple's Quicktime player.  </s>
<s> I also expect a review of Grins from Geoff Freed in the near future.  </s>
<s> I have stopped work on this.  </s>
<s> However, I'm paying some attention to deliverables of the QA Working Group (which, by the way, use the WAI guidelines/checkpoints model).  </s>
<s> No progress here from my end.  </s>
<s> I am hoping that JG and I will have a chance to talk about an XML or RDF representation of relationships between the two documents.  </s>
<s> I would like two documents at some point: a) "If you satisfy 508 requirements and these X extra things, you can get UAAG 1.0 Level A (for the following content types labels, etc.)." b) "If you conform to UAAG 1.0 in the following way, you also conform to 508 if you do these extra things."  </s>
<s> I think that UAAG 1.0 and Section 508 are sufficiently different that documents a and b may be suprisingly different.  </s>

<s> AG:: People are populating the template that describes how their products address the 508 provisions.  </s>
<s> If you want to think about what we really want we want them to be able to publish one page that serves both questions.  </s>
<s> So: a key report generator application is one that gathers these pages and presents the information contained there appropriately for UAAG-driven queries.  </s>
<s> One way to get a more robust engine is to kick ideas around in ER.  </s>
<s> There is technology and tool-building capability lurking there and susceptible to recruiting for the right compliance assessment tasks.  </s>
<s> And we should be coordinating with BuyAccessible at Section508.gov.  </s>
<s> They want to be able to treat the template-following pages that live on the Web as a database, too.  </s>
<s> If people should actually be putting these pages up in some strict flavor of HTML for post-processing into the BuyAccessible database, it will help 508.gov and it will help us.  </s>
<s> Or they may have an XML or other data-entry format for submission to the database that we can learn from.  </s>

<s> I think we should get a link on the section508 to WAI activities or at least to UAAG when we get a good comparision of UAAG and 508 available.  </s>
