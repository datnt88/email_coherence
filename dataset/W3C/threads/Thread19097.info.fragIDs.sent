<s> Hi Katie, I note that your this version and latest version URIs are the same, which seems problematic to me.  </s>
<s> I recommend following the standard W3C conventions for URIs to documents: "This version": path /STATUS-shortname-YYYYMMDD "Latest version": path /shortname In this case, since these are WCAG Techniques, I suggest that the shortname be consistent with previous ones: WCAG10-PDF-FECHS If this is not a Techniques document for WCAG 1.0, then the initial string should be rethought (e.g., "WCAG" or "WCAG20").  </s>
<s> If you intend the WCAG WG version to always be under /GL/2000/12, that's fine.  </s>
<s> The latest version would be: and this version: I realize that these URIs are kind of long.  </s>
<s> The short name (WCAG10-PDF-TECHS) might be negotiated.  </s>
<s> Or, make the latest version URI something like: (which is the convention used for the other WCAG 1.0 techniques documents published for the WG).  </s>
<s> Don't change the current document, whose URI you've already published.  </s>
<s> Instead, I recommend starting with the above conventions (and your favorite short name) starting with the next draft.  </s>
<s> More information on publication rules (Member-visible): More information on document ideas: Thank you, - Ian Note: You will have to follow these conventions when the document is published under /TR.  </s>
