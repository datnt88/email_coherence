-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- Hash: SHA1 I'm considering of creating an english version of my website (currently there's only a dutch version), but I have never done something like this before. 
~ My idea about it was to create a page like 'index.php' (i'll call this the languageselector) which uses the http-request to decide wether to serve the dutch or the english version, using a redirect, for the english version to index.en.php and for the dutch to index.nl.php. 
I would create a languageselector for every page, so that i would have three files for every page: 'page.php', 
'page.en.php', 'page.nl.php'. 
Is this a good idea or are there better/other ways for doing this? 
Are there maybe some 'ready made' solutions for this? 
(I use PHP on an Apache server) Kind regards and thanks, Jeroen Budts Person xmlns="http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/"

for the info. 
I myself, was unaware of such features. 
I stand corrected. 
Kevin. 
Perhaps this is a good time for us all to rethink our positions. 
Might it not be so that organisations - like the UN - who do not use language negotiation do so because they are clearly less knowledgeable than those who chose to spend their time following this list - and our esteemed colleague Kevin here illustrate that not even here everyone knows these techniques. 
What we need to do is what David and I do daily: teach. 
This is one case where "Those who can, teach; those who can't should listen" applies. 
There is a growing awareness of the fact that access to information is difficult - impossible even - to some groups among us. 
Let us try to teach people to use the technology we have today for the best result, instead of bickering over what might be. 
To quote mom: "Spit in one hand and wish in the other, and see where you get the most". 
"Dissing" the Accept-Language header and inventing a number of more or less esoteric methods to deal with the same problem is wishing, and not for anything nice. 
And to Kevin - bravo. 
It takes a strong man to admit to having learnt something.

[+46] 0708 557 905 :)The assumption for everyone to know everything intinctivley because it is assumed knowledge, is a misgiving. 
For accessabilities sake us developers should live by: "Never make assumtions, it makes and ASS out of yoU and ME". 
My girlfriend's mother was unaware of such an option for language selection and it was not immediently apparent so she never benefitted. 
This just adds another view of the language barrier on the Web to the discussion from someone who would never verture forth to participate in such a conversation.

In the first place, even in the absence of explicit user choice, the browser already has a clue based on the language set in the operating system and desktop. 
In the second place (and in the real world), ISPs and system administrators will pre-configure language preferences to local norms on behalf of users. 
And as others have pointed out, it's a simple configuration option for those who can use a menu. 
It's just not labelled as HTTP content negotiation - that would be far more technical detail than most users need to know. 
Nick Kew In my real world there live a lot of people whose native language is not that of the country they live in. 
(In Amsterdam alone, 45% of residents are of non-Dutch origin.) 
In that real world, people go to a store to buy a computer for themselves; what they get is a machine pre-configured with an operating system and browser set to the (main) language of the country they live in (often preconfigured to use a particular ISP as well). 
No administrator in sight. 
Just how do those people even find out there is such a thing as a language preference? 
And if they know enough to ask the right questions - will their ISP's helpdesk know enough to help them along? 
My downstairs neighbor, who is Mexican, never had a clue she could set her *keyboard* to use Spanish instead of Dutch. 
She shares the computer with her daughter who is more fluent in Dutch than in Spanish. 
Even if they know they can set the browser to a language preference - which would they choose? 
Their browser certainly doesn't have a clue what their preferences are.

Unfortunately there has been little attempt to get some kind of consensus, so the issue just keeps going in circles. 
Some more extensive rambling... 
There are clear issues where people simply don't know what the tools they have do. 
It is obvious to me that a computer is capable of changing languages. 
So with a little looking around when I got my new computer home I set it up to use my preferred languages in order for internet and general interface features, set up my keyboard to swap between several european layouts, hebrew, arabic, japanese and vietnamese easily, and some other stuff that I wanted. 
But that isn't how it works for everybody. 
I have explained to lots of people that they can have things work more like they want them to. 
From language changes to font styles, these things should be simple. 
But they aren't always, even if you understand that they "must be somewhere" (occasionally you find a system designed so it doesn't have such basic features). 
On the one hand, it is helpful to have something people run into that helps them solve their instant problem. 
If what I want is to buy a train ticket, I would prefer not to learn about the ins and outs of a browser first. 
On the other hand, if I am going to use the web every day, it is probably helpful if I do learn how to get the system to work Products that are a pain to use are not, in a natural market, good sellers. 
But we don't live in a natural market. 
People have a browser, and often are loath to change, or unable to change, however good or bad it is. 
Others change browsers regularly. 
Some people use expensive systems they cannot afford to upgrade, because of licensing or compatibility issues. 
Others use high-performance free software, or have the capacity to rewrite code as necessary to cope with their environment. 
Where do we draw the lines? 
It seems that this question hasn't been very satisfactorily answered, except in the sense that WAI guidelines make a few determinations on specific points (as do other guidelines, not always with the same results). 
Without some kind of agreed answers I think both authors and users are suffering from confusion, and from different people giving and following differing advice. 
This forum doesn't seem to have much mechanism for establishing agreement or resolution - it is a feeder for the WAI working groups, which do have such mechanisms, as well as a place for general discussion... Cheers Chaals
