You have to check your DNS installation. 
Could you try to add the host name of your http server in your /etc/hosts file just to see if the problem persists. 
You can also start Amaya in debug mode and set a break point in GetHostByName 
function to understand what is wrong. 
Regards Irene. 
This problem occurs with any address, even http://localhost/ or This problem occurs on two different machines; one is a nameserver.
