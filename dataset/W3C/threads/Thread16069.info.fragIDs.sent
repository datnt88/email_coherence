<s> After Microsoft releases service pack 2 for  </s>
<s> IE4, this browser, combined with Microsoft Active Accessibility 1.2, has the potential of providing efficient access.  </s>
<s> Until that happens and users have validated it through experience, however, it is a promise and not a reality.  </s>
<s> IBM and Productivity Works also have good accessible browsers in the making, but they are commercial and also not yet proven to the disability community.  </s>
<s> Even when there is an accessible HTML browser on the dominant, Windows platform, a large proportion of users with and without disabilities will not be able to take advantage of it because they will not have the hardware necessary to comfortably run this software.  </s>
<s> A comfortable experience requires a minimum of 32 megs of RAM and a clock speed of 200.  </s>
<s> People with disabilities are often economically poor and not able to keep up with the latest hardware requirements.  </s>
<s> People from developing countries also face this situation, whether they have disabilities or not.  </s>
<s> It has been suggested that, even if one does not use a contemporary graphical browser, it is a trivial matter to use one to produce a good plain text rendering of the HTML page.  </s>
<s> Unfortunately, I have  </s>
<s> not found this to be the case.  </s>
<s> An initial problem is that the line length produced will often be greater than 80 characters unless one takes special steps to prevent this from happening.  </s>
<s> On a standard text terminal, some information is lost when scrolling down continuously through the text.  </s>
<s> If one has to navigate to the right margin whenever some words appear to be missing, the reading process becomes cumbersome, unpleasant, and inefficient.  </s>
<s> A second problem in plain text rendering is that HTML pages usually contain headers, footers, and embedded navigational references that get included in the plain text rendering but are not material to its content, and thus a distraction.  </s>
<s> I generally have to go through the initial plain text rendering to clean out such extraneous material.  </s>
<s> I've developed macros that help speed up this clean-up process, but it requires significant time and effort to edit each page in order to get crisp content.  </s>
<s> I've tried every DOS command-line utility I could find that converts from HTML to text.  </s>
<s> Only one, HTMSTRIP, (from job, in my opinion.  </s>
<s> This further indicates that rendering good plain text is a nontrivial matter which should not be assumed practical for the average user.  </s>

<s> I would contend that computer literacy is a requirement for anyone (for economic reasons or whatever) who is using a DOS-based machine.  </s>
<s> Operation of Lynx via telnet using a telecommunications package (like Procomm Plus or whatever) certainly falls within the required skill set.  </s>
<s> Use of the the HTMLSTRIP utility Jamal recommends would not be difficult for such users, but not required.  </s>
<s> Thanks for adding your perspective to this discussion.  </s>
<s> I agree that IE 3.02 presently provides efficient HTML access with the Winvision 97 screen reader, though not any other reliably.  </s>
<s> It is a temporary niche solution, but not a generally satisfactory one.  </s>
<s> It does not and will not support the latest web standards including HTML 4, and therefore, is becoming obsolete.  </s>
<s> We need to have browsers that are developed to meet evolving Internet standards, so the version to judge by is IE4, which came out over a year ago and is still not accessible with most screen readers.  </s>
<s> It is unrealistic to expect the average user to do the complex setup required of Windows Lynx 32.  </s>
<s> It still has keyboard conflicts with most screen readers.  </s>
<s> Lynx also does not support and is unlikely to support the latest web standards.  </s>
<s> I do use Unix Lynx and if shell accounts were not a dying market choice, I would encourage more computer novices to learn it.  </s>
<s> I agree that we should encourage computer literacy among blind people.  </s>
<s> The level of literacy currently required, however, to efficiently use current graphical browsers is a bit much for a non-techie.  </s>
