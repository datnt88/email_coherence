Hi, Maybe my reading of RFC 2518 is not thorough enough. 
It seems to me that: XML elements are allowed in a copy method to modify the copying behavior. 
But, what kind of XML elements are allowed and how should they be interpreted? 
Thx, -Stanley You are correct, but this functionality hasn't been widely implemented. 
It turns out the server knows more about what properties can and should be kept live on a COPY operation, so the clients never provided this information and servers didn't need it anyway. 
In RFC2518bis this has been removed.

Thx, -Stanley MessageLisa, Then, probably the following statement in RFC2518bis needs to be reworded: 8.9 COPY Method COPY for HTTP/1.1 resources After a successful COPY invocation, all properties on the source resource MUST be duplicated on the destination resource, subject to modifying headers and XML elements, following the definition for copying properties.
