<s> How about 'RDF application'.  </s>
<s> That's pretty broad and generic.  </s>
<s> Clearly at some point we need to be able to talk about what parts of the language must be supported by actual software,  </s>
<s> and it seems we can do that without straying into any definition of the software itself -- apart from requirements.  </s>
<s> Patrick  </s>
<s> I don't see how that is possible.  </s>
<s> When talking about datatypes we are  </s>
<s> forced into talking about information 'inside' RDF and information coming from 'outside'.  </s>
<s> The 'side' that these words are referring to is the boundary of a hypothetical RDF reasoning engine.  </s>
<s> I note that the XML spec makes a similar reference to a hypothetical XML parser, and it does not seem inappropriate there.  </s>

<s> no; we're specifying a language, not a piece of software.  </s>

<s> [Sigh... again, no pointer to the relevant document... I'll go hunting... in your message of 09 Dec 2002 10:59:22 -0600 you referred us to but I can't reach that.... hmm... lemme try from another machine... ok...  </s>
<s> I have something last modified Tue, 10 Dec 2002 00:38:22 GMT] It seems straightforward to me... change make it easier to implement RDF reasoning engines which can check formal RDF entailment.  </s>
<s> to make it easier to implement RDF entailment checking in software.  </s>
<s> Strike the para that begins...  </s>
<s> In operational terms, in order to make use of datatyping information, a reasoning engine would require that the uriref of a datatype provides access to a process which at least can determine, for any character string, whether or not it is a valid lexical form for that datatype.  </s>
<s> ...  </s>
<s> Strike... A 'datatype-aware' RDF engine SHOULD be competent to recognize at least the built-in rdf:XMLLiteral datatype.  </s>
<s> It MAY also recognize the set of all the XML Schema built-in datatypes.  </s>
<s> I'm not sure what to do with the occurence in the glossary;  </s>
<s> if it's informative, (a) it seems harmless, but (b) the glossary should say so, right under the heading.  </s>
<s> If it contributes some novel technical information to the spec, I'd much prefer that the glossary entries had pointers to the sections where the terms are introduced (bonus points for usage pointers too).  </s>
<s> Hm... I see 'engine' isn't the only term that needs scrubbing... reasoner...  </s>
<s> Strike this: Thus, the inclusion of a triple of the form ex:somedatatype rdf:type rdfs:Datatype .  </s>
<s> in an RDF graph can be understood by a datatype-aware RDF reasoner as a claim that ex:somedatatype identifies a recognized datatype.  </s>
<s> Such reasoners MAY post a warning or an error condition when they are unable to access the minimal relevant datatype information.  </s>
<s> 'regognized' is defined as a relationship between interpretations and datatypes; there's no need to bring reasoners into  </s>
<s> the picture.  </s>
<s> I don't understand this bit: While normal RDFS reasoning is valid when applied to the datatype vocabulary, other implications which depend on the properties of the datatype spaces may be missed, and datatype clashes or other error conditions may be undetectable.  </s>
<s> if it contributes some novel information to the spec, please supplement it with an example (and let's get that example in the test suite).  </s>
<s> Otherwise, please strike it.  </s>
<s> Strike this: Although RDFS entailment rules apply robustly to such graphs, datatype-aware RDF reasoners MAY treat a datatype violation as an error condition.  </s>
<s> strike this: Although the definition of entailment means that a D-inconsistent graph D-entails any RDF graph, datatype-aware RDF reasoners SHOULD NOT publish 'trivial' conclusions derived from a recognized datatype-clash contradiction.  </s>
<s> (a) I think it is very inappropriate there; I fought tooth-and-nail to keep it out, but lost.  </s>
<s> I think the cost has been much higher than the benefit.  </s>
<s> (b) the XML WG did not introduce that term lightly.  </s>
<s> There were endless discussions of what constraints to put on XML processors.  </s>
<s> Endless in the sense that they continue to this day...  </s>
<s> Dan Connolly, W3C http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/  </s>
<s> Well, OK, let me respond more to the point.  </s>
<s> I don't see why it is out of place, and I would prefer to keep it in.  </s>
<s> I don't understand the basis for your objection to it.  </s>
<s> I don't mind making that change, but it seems purely stylistic to me.  </s>
<s> It says the same thing.  </s>
<s> I can't just strike it, since it says something important that needs to be said.  </s>
<s> How about rephrasing along the lines you suggest, as follows: ..in order to make use of datatyping information, any software which is checking RDF entailment would require .... What I dont like about this is that it presupposes that software is going to be 'checking' entailment.  </s>
<s> Some engines might do other things, though, based on entailment, like generate consequences or do abduction or whatever, I don't know.  </s>
<s> I'd rather not pre-guess what it is going to be doing.  </s>
<s> Im happy to strike that.  </s>
<s> Yes, I will label the glossary as informative.  </s>
<s> Yes, I will do that.  </s>
<s> I would like to put invisible pointers from the text back to the glossary, like the XML schema doc does, but my HTML expertise does not yet run that far.  </s>
<s> But that relationship only makes sense in this context.  </s>
<s> OK, I can strike it.  </s>
<s> I think we need to say something about this, as otherwise we have a normative semantics which justifies inferring anything at all from a datatype clash.  </s>
<s> I know this is logically correct, but I bet it will confuse a hell of a lot of people.  </s>
<s> I also think that we should tell people that it is OK for a reasoning engine to stop drawing conclusions when it finds a datatype violation.  </s>
<s> There are valid entailments from badly-formed datatypes, so a reasoner which purports to be complete might well be understood to be required to generate them all.  </s>
<s> The point of this is to day that is OK to post an error and refuse to generate the valid RDFS conclusions in this case, and still count yourself as a complete reasoner.  </s>
<s> When reading the XML spec, that is the least of the problems I find.  </s>
<s> I honestly do not know what it is that is bothering you so much here.  </s>
<s> All of these languages are intended for use by software, so why the prohibition against referring to what software is supposed to do or not do?  </s>
