<s> Raised by Pierre-Antoine CHAMPIN in Summary: The Model and Syntax specification does not clearly specify which reified statements are put in which bag when nested description elements have bagID's.  </s>
<s> I propose we close this by resolving: Nested rdf:Description elements with rdf:bagIDs generate the same triples as top-level rdf:Description elements with rdf:bagIDs.  </s>
<s> Specifically, triples generated as a result of nested rdf:Description elements do not get included in bags associated with outer rdf:Description elements.  </s>
<s> (sort of based on the resolution attached to Jeremy's mail -- I hope I got this right  </s>
<s> With respect to Pierre-Antoine's question What model should the following RDF piece return ?  </s>
<s> The first attachment test001.rdf  </s>
<s> contains an updated and completed version of his example.  </s>
<s> (Iadded the rdf:RDF, updated the attributes to be rdf:*, and made absolute URIs) By this resolution it is equivalent to the attached test002.rdf, with the inner rdf:Description moved to the outer level.  </s>
<s> And both generate the same N-Triples However, since IDs/bagIDs are being used, the URLs generated are relative to the location of the RDF/XML files so there are two result N-Triples files.  </s>
<s> The final test case files will be below they are calculated relative to that Dave  </s>
<s> Absolutely.  </s>
<s> I agree.  </s>
