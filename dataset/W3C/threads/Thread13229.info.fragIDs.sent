I think we must evaluate the pages to which we send those using our "existing tools list" for accessibility. 
So far Dr. Watson doesn't work (access denied), a cursory examination of Net Mechanic (incidentally this is a "for fee" service but I've submitted one of our pages for free evaluation) finds at least a "click here". 
I may recommend that we get a "bad" site to submit to any of the tools so that we have a uniform checker and perhaps that each site test itself and our Web presence. 
Whatcha think? 
Love.

Pehtoori HTML validation service leads to an error message. 
"Muffin filtering proxy server" is pretty "geeky" for inclusion in a list that is intended for Web users. 
I'll do more later. 
Love.

I've attached the NetMechanic results of testing our Tool List page. 
I haven't followed the links thereon.
