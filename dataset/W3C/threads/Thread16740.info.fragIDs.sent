<s> I have built a form which has a submit button on it.  </s>
<s> If the user activates the button and hasn't filled out the form correctly, a javascript 'alert' pop-up is presented to the user, giving more information.  </s>
<s> This appears to be in breach of checkpoint 10.1  </s>
<s> Would it be acceptable to provide a warning message, something like 'Submitting this form may result in a pop-up dialog being displayed' before the submit button, in the same color as the background?  </s>
<s> Thus (I believe) making the text available to screen reader users but not to sighted users?  </s>

<s> It is a known trick for stuffing keywords for search engines and may result in the site being boycotted by major search engines.  </s>
<s> One is expecting a major change in content when one submits a form, so one of the main reasons for avoiding popups doesn't apply.  </s>
<s> It also depends on how the screen reader gets its content - readers that are too smart about colours (a useful feature) will realise that the text is invisible and skip it.  </s>
<s> (given the way this is normally used to stuff keywords in pages, it is not a bad practice).  </s>

<s> I don't know how that will behave in the screenreader but it may help get around the problem with the search engine.  </s>

<s> Perhaps not, since putting spider-bait in alt attributes is just as old a search-engine as hiding stuff using colour.  </s>
<s> On the other hand there isn't really anyway I can think of for spiders to know whether they are being baited unless there is a lot of repetition of words other than "a", "the", etc. Spider-baiting in itself is quite a problem for users of text, whether sighted text-only users or users of enabling technologies.  </s>
<s> I've quite often come across sites with little for a text-only user to read but the keywords they want to be listed over repeated 50 times.  </s>
