<s> Monika, Drew, I completely agree with the proposed solution.  </s>
<s> This should definitely be implemented in the next release.  </s>
<s> I also agree, except note that there are 2 proposals "on the table": I think Monika suggested this: Process - hasPrecondition - Precondition where Precondition is a subclass of Condition whereas Drew seems to be suggesting this: Process - hasPrecondition - Condition (with no Precondition class anywhere).  </s>
<s> That reminds me - we still have an open issue about the class of an effect (that is, the range of ceEffect).  </s>

<s> Do people feel that it's OK to have Condition for this range, or do we need something distinct?  </s>

<s> [Monika Solanki, in re DAML-S spec] Currently in the 1.0 version of the process model, we have the following owl:Class rdf:ID="Precondition" / - owl:ObjectProperty rdf:ID="preCondition" rdfs:domain rdf:resource="#Precondition" / rdfs:range rdf:resource="#Condition" / /owl:ObjectProperty Where, Condition is defined as, - owl:Class rdf:ID="Condition" rdfs:comment This is a "place-holder" for now, which awaits further work from the DAML/OWL community.  </s>
<s> An instance of Condition is a logical formula that evaluates to true or false.  </s>
<s> Eventually we expect this to be defined elsewhere, as part of a OWL extension allowing for logical expressions.  </s>
<s> /rdfs:comment /owl:Class Somehow I am not able to grasp the utility of the property "preCondition".  </s>
<s> Since in this model, we have IOPEs as Classes, therefore I believe all we need to do is make Precondition a subclass of Condition.  </s>
<s> owl:Class rdf:ID="PreCondition" rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="#Condition" / /owl:Class The property preCondition, introduces redundancy as it is ranging over the class "Condition" anyways.  </s>
<s> Feedback appreciated in case I missed something.  </s>
<s> You're right, as far as I can see.  </s>
<s> The important property is hasPrecondition, which connects a Condition to a Process or Process step.  </s>
<s> There is no reason for the class Precondition to exist, let alone a property preCondition linking a Precondition to a Condition (itself?). -- Drew McDermott Yale University CS Dept.  </s>
<s> Monika, Drew, I completely agree with the proposed solution.  </s>
<s> This should definitely be implemented in the next release.  </s>
<s> I think we should retain the Precondition class and the hasPrecondition property.  </s>
<s> This is because, although Precondition is effectively a Condition, however it is a "special" kind of Condition.  </s>
<s> In the process model, Condition is a general thing, which is also used for Conditional Effects and Conditional Outputs.  </s>

<s> Effects are fundamentally different from conditions.  </s>
<s> They just don't have the same vocabulary.  </s>
<s> Effects are not true or false; they are "imposed" or "not imposed."  </s>
<s> Here are some examples: (increase q x): means "Quantity q increases by x." (when p e) in an effect means, "If p was true before the action, e is imposed after (new x p): "A new x comes into existence, such that p." (This is not standard, but several people with practical planning applications say it's absolutely necessary, and it certainly seems to be in the web-services world.) On the Precondition-class issue: I am willing to lose on this issue, but I think the winners will eventually repent.  </s>
<s> As Mike Huhns pointed out, all there is to know about a formula is captured in the way it is expressed in some syntactic framework.  </s>
<s> Putting a formula into a precondition slot doesn't change anything about it.  </s>
<s> It's not like moving an animal into the Pet class by housebreaking it.  </s>
<s> If to be in the Precondition class is to be the precondition of some step, then there is no way to decree that a Condition is _not_ in the precondition class.  </s>
<s> How could you ever know?  </s>
<s> You could put every Condition into the Precondition class and it wouldn't do any harm.  </s>
<s> It's as if we had a class Password, such that a string was in this class if and only if it was a password used by someone, somewhere.  </s>
<s> What would be the point?  </s>
<s> What we care about is that a string is the value of the hasPassword property for some particular application.  </s>
<s> (Of course, a particular application could have a class Acceptable-password, which allowed strings with digits and punctuation marks, but disallowed English words, but then it would be something about the string itself that made it acceptable or not.) -- Drew McDermott Yale University CS Dept.  </s>
<s> [Monika Solanki]  </s>
<s> [Sheila McIlraith] I agree.  </s>
<s> We may want to syntactically restrict the types of preconditions we have.  </s>
<s> This affords us that flexibility.  </s>
<s> That would make sense.  </s>
<s> But what Monika actually said is a bit different.  </s>
<s> In the quoted paragraph, she suggested that Condition encompassed preconditions, plus conditional-effect and conditional-output conditions ("secondary preconditions").  </s>
<s> I've been assuming that a Condition was an arbitrary formula.  </s>
<s> After all, it's not a subclass of anything (according to Process.owl).  </s>
<s> It might be reasonable to have a class Formula, and a subclass Condition that was restricted syntactically somehow.  </s>
<s> I'd be very surprised if there were a syntactic difference between primary and secondary preconditions.  </s>
