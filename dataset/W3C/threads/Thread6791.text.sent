Hi all, There was some discussion back in July about using the TR in RDF data to facilitate the creation of bibliography in XMLSpec; while I'm not sure where we are on this topic, nor who should have any action on it, I wrote up a small tool to re-use these data for creating XHTML bibliography, along discussions I had with Ian Jacobs. 
As so often these days :), the tool is based on XSLT: which should present you with XML/CSS or XSLT-aware browsers with an HTML form to submit URIs on which you want to get bibliographic data. 
You can give it dated or undated URIs, separated by a space or a line return. 
For instance, with the following URIs: the results is as follows: QA Framework: Operational Guidelines , L. Henderson, D. Haza?l-Massieux, L. Rosenthal, K. Gavrylyuk, Editors, W3C Candidate Recommendation, 22 September 2003, available at available at http://www.w3.org/TR/qaframe-ops/ . 
QA Framework: Specification Guidelines , D. Haza?l-Massieux, L. Henderson, L. Rosenthal, Editors, W3C Working Draft, 12 September 2003, available at available at http://www.w3.org/TR/qaframe-spec/ . 
[with the appropriate links embedded] I have tried to follow the formatting suggestions given by the Manual of Style [1]. 
Comments and suggestions welcome. 
Dom 1. http://www.w3.org/2001/06/manual/ Dominique Haza?l-Massieux - http://www.w3.org/People/Dom/ W3C/ERCIM This is really cool... another wish come true. 
Request for Enhancement: support link targets. 
The input should consist of pairs label URI and the bibliography should be formatted: Maybe make the labels a check-box option. 
Strike "available at" there. 
That URI is the official name of the document, not just a handy place to find a copy. 
Hmm... the manual[1] says "A sentence containing a text-only URI." For documents that have institutionalized identifiers and bear them on their title page, I think the sentence isn't called for. 
APA suggests Retrieved November 20, 2000, from -- http://www.apastyle.org/elecsource.html 
Request for enhancement: If a reference is a W3C Recommendation track technical report that has not reached Recommendation, state in the References section that it is "work in progress."

If you process the tr.rdf[1] file with tr-bibl.xsl[2], 
you'll get tr.xml[3] which is an XMLSpec bibl for all the documents on the TR page. 
I've also tweaked the customization layer that generates the HTML for the XSL/XML Query specs so that will use the bibl from tr.xml to generate the bibliography entry. 
I'm sure there's room for improvement, but this will be better than checking all the bibliographies in a dozen specs to see if they're consistent.

Trying the latter, I get: Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0 (Second Edition) , T. Bray, J. Paoli, C. , E. Maler, Editors, [snip] Some editors, but poor Michael Sperberg-McQueen reduced to a mere "C."! 
I tried a couple more Recs that have Second Editions: it gets the 1st ed.

: The editors are not given in the original data (which could be fixed pretty easily, I gather), so there is nothing I can do about that in the tool. 
I fixed the bug with regard to 1ed/2ed (hopefully). 
It's likely to break with XML 3rd ed, though, I'll need to do a smarter algorithm, at some point. 
Fixed. 
Should be fixed for all 2nd ed. 
The URI accepted by the system is the one referenced in tr.rdf, which itself is (supposingly) the one given by the document itself. 
And indeed, Latest version: Thanks for the feedback!

15:41, Dan Connolly a ?crit 
: Done, thanks for the suggestion, I was wondering how it could be turned into a more useful bibliography. 
I stroke it, but I don't know what to do with your reference to APA (since you insist on not using the URI as a mere locator, but as an identifier). 
Will look into it, but maybe not now :) Dom Dominique Haza?l-Massieux - http://www.w3.org/People/Dom/ W3C/ERCIM Another idea: accept pointers to other bibliography sources, e.g. the IETF. 
I converted the IETF RFC index to RDF a while ago: # GET http://www.ietf.org/iesg/1rfc_index.txt \ # | perl rfcIndexGrok.pl  
,rfc-index.rdf -- http://www.w3.org/2001/02pd/rfcIndexGrok.pl 
So I'd like to give this bibliography extractor a mix of pointers to W3C specs and pointers to IETF specs, plus a pointer to ,rfc-index.rdf, and get a formatted bibliography back. 
Dan Connolly, W3C http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/ 
The link in the TR page is ".../xhtml1/", which is why I had tried that. 
It does work fine with the actual link ".../xhtml1" in the document itself. 
TR page needs a little fix. 
Regards, Fran?ois Thanks very much, Dom. 
It's splendid. 
Added to the Manual of Style: Also added to the tools index for this mailing list: Is it possible to add a quick note saying "Requires an XSLT-aware browser"? 
MacIE for example displays text rather than a form "Stylesheet to format bibliographic data..." through "$Id: tr-biblio.xsl,v 
1.21 2003/10/28 15:51:46 dom Exp $tr.rdftr.rdf, 
Editors, W3C , , . 
Latest version available at .. ," without a form. 
Thanks again. 
A tool like this can cost US $20 or more a seat yet not quite meet W3C's special requirements. 
This one is perfect.

: Glad you like it ;) Actually, this requirement was only for the test-it-and-use-if-you-like-it kind of announce; but since you have linked to it from more visible places, I created a wider-accepted HTML interface at: which should do the same thing. 
That means you'd have to update the links in the archives cover and in the MoS, but that will probably ease the adoption of the tool itself... Thanks for the feedback, Dom Dominique Haza?l-Massieux - http://www.w3.org/People/Dom/ W3C/ERCIM Done.

: My bad, I was talking of xhtml11, while you were speaking about xhtml1. 
Anyway, the data on which the TR page is built are the same as the data used to query the bibliography extraction, so there should be no discrepancy (and indeed, the link from the TR page is .../xhtml1 not .../xhtml1/, unless I missed something).
