2) FORTEZZA(tm) (including Skipjack) is on the IETF standards track, as an algorithm suite in the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol. 
That doesn't imply that anyone other than posessors of FORTEZZA(tm) cards will be expected, or even able, to use that particular mechanism. 
It meets the need of a large community of users; no objections to standardization of FORTEZZA(tm) as an optional CipherSuite have been raised, or even mentioned, within the TLS WG. well, as best I can tell, there's NO WAY for a classified algorithm to be on the IETF standards track. 
RFC1602 says: (A) ISOC will not propose, adopt, or continue to maintain any standards, including but not limited to standards labelled Proposed, Draft or Internet Standards, which can only be practiced using technology or works that are subject to known copyrights, patents or patent applications, or other rights, except with the prior written assurance of the owner of rights that: l. ISOC may, without cost, freely implement and use the technology or works in its standards work; 2. upon adoption and during maintenance of an Internet Standard, any party will be able to obtain the right to implement and use the technology or works under specified, reasonable, non-discriminatory terms; and 3. the party giving the assurance has the right and power to grant the licenses and knows of no other copyrights, patents, patent applications, or other rights that may prevent ISOC and members of the Internet community from implementing and operating under the standard. 
Now, this is part of the part of 1602 which was generally felt to be "broken". 
However, the replacement for RFC1602, draft-ietf-poised95-std-proc-3-06.txt, says: 7.1.2 
Incorporation of Other Specifications Other proprietary specifications may be incorporated by reference to a version of the specification as long as the proprietor meets the requirements of section 10. 
If the other proprietary specification is not widely and readily available, the IESG may request that it be published as an Informational RFC. 
The IESG generally should not favor a particular proprietary specification over technically equivalent and competing specification(s) by making any incorporated vendor specification "required" or "recommended". 
and, later on: 10.2 Confidentiality Obligations No contribution that is subject to any requirement of confidentiality or any restriction on its dissemination may be considered in any part of the Internet Standards Process, and there must be no assumption of any confidentiality obligation with respect to any such contribution. 
- Bill note that RFC 1602 has been replaced and is no longer the IETF standards process - the new process has not yet been published as an RFC but can be found in the internet-drafts directory as: draft-ietf-poised95-std-proc-3-06.txt 
This new version changes the IPR rules quite a bit and the cited language is no longer in the document. 
Scott oops - I did not read far enough in the note - if the proposal deals with a classified algorithm then I agree with your reading Scott
