The comment is based on the entry in the Xquery document 
err:XQ0052 It is a dynamic error if the content of an element or attribute constructor includes an atomic value that cannot be cast into a string, such as a value of type xs:QName or xs:NOTATION. 
But it presumably applies to XPath and so XSLT as well, so I have not prefixed the subject line with [Xquery] I can see that there are problems with casting QNames due to prefix bindings but NOTATION (and also ID, etc) do not have this problem as they are NCNames and don't have a prefix (or take part in namespace 
processing) so the URI part of the QName should always be "". 
as such there should be a trivial casting to string, namely taking the name() = local-name(). 
schema part 1 says: Schema Component: Notation Declaration {name} An NCName as defined by [XML-Namespaces]. 
XML namespaces 1.0 was famously vague on this point but the wording is clarified in 1.1: No attributes with a declared type of ID, IDREF(S), ENTITY(IES), or NOTATION contain any colons.

This is true for NOTATION attributes defined in a DTD. 
But for some reason which I find quite impossible to fathom, the Schema WG decided that xs:NOTATION values defined in a schema should be QNames. 
Although the name 
property of a NOTATION (like the name property of many other schema components, such as element declarations and type definitions) is an NCName, a NOTATION also has a target namespace property. 
Section 3.2.19 in XML 
Schema Part 2 makes it clear that the value space of xs:NOTATION is the set of QNames of notations declared in "the current schema" (whatever that might be).

Is that really right? 
(A second reading of the schema spec would suggest it might be., although it isn't clear that it has to be read that way) That's er strange is about the only description I could give on a public list... 
Yes I read that, but still read it as just saying that the notations had to be declared but not that they then would wander in to the schema's target namespace, that interpretation is straining the xml namespace spec to the limit isn't it? 
Unlike "other schema components such as element declarations" Notation names are constrained to be NCNames in the document not only in the schema syntax, so what's the point of putting them in a Namespaces?
