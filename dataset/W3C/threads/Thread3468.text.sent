I put up a placeholder at: If someone can tell me the japanese characters for mojibake, I'll test that the page is served properly as unicode. 
feel free to suggest terms to add. 
The page format itself was copied from one of my other pages as quick and dirty, and probably will undergo some other changes and start to look like a w3c page, at least with respect to the front matter. 
But it will take time which I dont have much of at the moment.

Making e-Business Work Around the World Tex: I guess moji must be ?????? (character / letter). 
I don't know what bake would be. 
Neither dictionary I've tried has mojibake. 
Does it mean glossary?

Making e-Business Work Around the World Thanks. 
Unicode settings seem correct. 
The page is off to a silly start. 
As it expands I'll make it more serious.

Making e-Business Work Around the World Bakeru " x " is a verb explained on my dictionary as follows: A badger takes the forms of a girl. 
A deadman's spirit haunts. 
He slipped into the garden in the disguise of a woman. 
Well transformed! 
Your disguies is perfect. 
Monster is Bakemono " x " in Japanese. 
You get an idea how negative it has as its meaning. 
Meanwhile, Chemistry (=Kagaku x ) is often referred as Bakegaku to be distinguished from Science (= Kagaku x ). 
It's a slang and Kagaku is the correct Japanese word, but it's not a negative word in this case. 
-takao I think it means garbage or garbage character. 
I see Takao supplied it. 
I'll add it. 
would be.

Making e-Business Work Around the World It wasn't a very international-friendly def. 
was it ;-) Thought I'd see who was reading and who wasn't. 
internationalisation: Common misspelling of internationalization. lol, some people might say a more appropriate definition would be: internationalization: Common misspelling of internationalisation. Tex Texin cell: +1 781 789 1898 mailto:Tex@XenCraft.com Xen Master http://www.i18nGuy.com
