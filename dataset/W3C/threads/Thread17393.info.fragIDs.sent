Hi, 
*grin* joking aside... 
Yes, I know we can argue that a designer shouldn't control a thing! 
:=) Some site owners wish to keep their visitors on their page, especially if there are *a lot* of outside links. 
I have seen a neat trick (script) that gives the visitor the option of opening up a new window or staying in the same one. 
I think it was javascript, though that isn't cool for accessibility reasons (doesn't degrade gracefully). 
Any thoughts, on how to have a happy balance between the two?

Was it a joke ? 
It would seem we have a slight accessibility problem here; I have tried several times to understand Joe Clark's message to WAI-IG - and failed. 
Such a solution is really uncessary. 
Most modern graphical UAs - which are the only ones we need bother with in this discussion - have the ability of either opening a link in a new window, or opening it in the present one. 
That means the choice - given by the Javascript you mention - is allready built into the UAs. 
Frankly, I see no need what so ever for an author to *force* the opening of a new window of anyone. 
If the user wants to "stay" on the site he'll open the link in a new window; if he doesn't he won't - and if he *can't*, he'll still be able to access the information in the fashion best suited to him. 
Yes. Avoid target; avoid Javascript. 
Let the user choose. 
Less code, less complications, more choice and everyone is happy.

Am I missing something here? 
bit lost in the comprehension front. 
Is it also 
wise on the choice of visited link colours when you go deeper into the site. 
Please explain objective of original post (off list) Pooh Bear. 
To me, your solution is not a happy balance. 
To make a bold statement that, "everyone is happy, seems to reflect on the disregard of, at minimum, some site owners who might "not" be happy. 
I understand that many people say the designer/site owner *shouldn't* take control, however minimal, but there are situations where I believe it's important to keep the visitor aware of the site after exit to other links that have been provided by the site owner. 
Mentioning that "Most modern graphical UAs... have the ability of either opening a link in a new window, or opening it in the present one." 
to me is an obvious remark. 
I really don't want to argue who "shouldn't and should" have control; I have heard and understood that argument for years. 
Forcing it down anyone's throat isn't going to make things better. 
What will make things better, in my not-so-humble opinion, is someone who has a strong curiosity and interest in trying to make "everyone happy" - which is one of those possibly impossible things to do. 
To this thought, I'm thinking of a browser function which somehow prominently points to the last site or page visited before the exit.

Can you clarify this sentence?

sure ........they go a delicate and very pleasant shade of pastel green.........which means when coupled with the given choice of background color they effectivley vanish in certain color blindness situations and the not quite so low vision users who do not wish to be forced into using text readers.

"I believe it's important to keep the visitor aware of the site after exit to other links that have been provided by the site owner." 
I have a question, am I reading between the lines correctly here, of covert approval of opening another window which could effectivley disable the back button? 
or am I just jumping at shadows? 
"What will make things better, in my not-so-humble opinion, is someone who has a strong curiosity and interest in trying to make "everyone happy" - which is one of those possibly impossible things to do." 
Please, a gentle suggestion to remove possibly from that statement.

I wonder if you had a particular point to make. 
Are you implying endorsement of this comment? 
Do you think there is some lesson we should be drawing from this? cheers chaals

Apologies to the list and Joe if I have the wrong end of the stick here but............Joe if the comment is one of your own........your lucky enough to understand web sites, access and find your way round them but there are many people without disabilities out there who cant so it must be a nightmare for people using alternative technology trying to use a site, these are the people the guidlines and we as part of the web community are trying to help, but you know that already, I think your just trying to stimulate good conversation :-). 
I personaly prefer to not to create links opening into new windows and I know this can also raise other issues

Hi all - right, first-post-from-me salutations done. 
=) Firstly, the discussions in this group have really helped to further open my eyes to Web Accessibility issues. 
Thanks. 
I've been thinking about the "open link in new window" debate, and I agree with the idea of maintaining browsing continuity - am in the process of reviewing some of the sites I have designed! 
I don't know if this has been said before, but doesn't Windows default to opening each folder in new windows? 
Apologies if I'm wrong, but I 
just find that interesting... 
I think that has changed for XP though, and folders open in the same window by default. 
Jon Gibbins *learning lots about accessible Web design* 
Why do we keep having these debates about opening new windows? 
We don't seem to be having debates about dialog boxes, or error message dialogs, or 
the various other GUI windows that have been used for over a decade by screen reader users. 
What problem are we trying to solve, the browser problem, an authoring problem, or what? 
For example, if the author codes the link to open in a new window, and the browser+AT doesn't inform the user (if she wants to be informed) then its a browser+AT problem. 
The default behavior of opening windows in Windows XP (and a lot of other GUIs) is good example of user configurability. 
It's not the authors/developers job to code around responsibilities of the browser+AT.

I don't know if this has been said before, but doesn't Windows default to opening each folder in new windows? 
Depends what software you are using to build the page with, or what the defaults are set at. 
In days gone by it was hard enough to get a visitor to 
your site so was concidered foolish to allow a browser to effectively leave your site when providing a hyperlink to somewhere else. 
So you would provide instructions within the coding to open a new window instead. 
But this would disable the back button. 
Not a good idea. 
What was demonstrated in the posting a while back was the back button was not disabled when following a link that opened a new window..............I think. 
Paul (now in a home for the mildly confused and bewildered) 
Apologies. 
I think the comment I made earlier was a little off-topic really... 
I was referring to Windows as an OS (or Explorer more specifically) rather than commenting from a web development point of view. 
With respect to forcing open new windows, I think the debate seems pretty much an 'each to their own' at the moment... but I can appreciate the problems associated with it and I've a little more wiser to it. 
Personally, at the moment I am interested in approaching accessibility problems from the browser application level rather than the markup level. 
.j 
Not sure if this is specifically what we're referring to (I've missed some of the previous emails).... 
But to open a link in a new browser window, you must add the "target=new" attribute in the a href tag. 
It doesn't need to be specifically the word "new" - it can be "target=blank" or what have you. 
But IE does not inherently open all links in a new browser window in default options. 
I don't know if this has been said before, but doesn't Windows default to opening each folder in new windows?

Hello All. 
To some of the newer list members who posted via this thread, welcome. 
Whew, to think this innocuous little posting from Joe "I have my opinions" Clark would start a thread this long. 
Like Joe, I too have opinions, and if I may, I would like to summarize and provide some things to think about. 
Joe started out by pointing to a Blog which supported his opinion that there is nothing wrong with opening second (third, forth and maybe even fifth windows). 
He cites the sarcasm definitive /sarcasm "03nov13. 
Special message to website creators: enough with the "outside link opens new window" junk. 
I can handle it, I'm a big boy now." 
Joe doesn't seem to like or agree with the WCAG Priority 2 Checkpoint: 10.1 "Until user agents allow users to turn off spawned windows, do not cause pop-ups or other windows to appear and do not change the current window without informing the user." 
He now appears to have a concurrence, and happily pointed out the posting, "...see, I'm right". 
As subsequent postings to the list pointed out, some people share his feelings, others (curiously, the regular users of AT) seem to concur with the W3C... I guess list members can draw their own conclusions. 
For those that are still considering using either the Target attribute (deprecated in XHTML, except for the Frameset DTD) and/or JavaScript Popup Windows, may I ask that you consider the following: 1) most users of Assistive Technology (and for this discussion we can focus on screen readers) prefer *Not* having to deal with multiple browser windows, *especially* un-announced ones. 
It's a spatial orientation thing... keeping focus on multiple windows is often problematic for blind users (not to single out any particular group). 
This also *may* be an issue for users with cognitive disabilities (remember the first time your "Back" button didn't work due to a Target="" link?). 
My poor Mum still gets befuddled when this happens, and her only thing is that she lacks experience and gets nervous around computers. 
This kind of experience just re-enforces her opinion... 
Finally, alternative user agents may not support multiple screen windows, and/or older machines may experience a performance hit if/when running multiple browser windows. 
2) the debate on launching a new browser window (pros and cons) has raged ever since Netscape 3 introduced the ability to do so back in the 90's. 
Being an analogy kinda guy, I always liked to use this one: If you owned a brick and mortar store, and somebody came into your shop, would you lock the door and not let them leave until they purchased something, or at least heard you sales pitch and got a business card? 
If that happened to you, would you have a good feeling or bad feeling about the shop? 
Why then would you want to do so with a web site. 
"Locking" them in seems so counter-productive that it transcends even usability/accessibility... Folks, most (all?) browsers have a Back Button, most if not all also provide a useful "history of visited pages" function. 
If you want people to come to your site on multiple occasions, or in some other way feel that your site is/was of use to them, concentrate on content, not tricks. 
Trust me, if the site has value, they will return (via their Back Button, History list, or, if you are lucky, by their bookmark). 
As an added benefit, sites with *real* content, compelling and useful, will generally do better in Search Engine results... 3) related but different department: JavaScript popups. 
Here again issues of spatial disorientation can be a problem. 
But another thing has also happened. 
Compliments of our good friends that first sold "SpyCams" the JS Popup has become endemic on the web... so much so that both User Agents (Netscape 7.x/Mozilla, Opera, others) have built in "blockers" which prevent these types of unsolicited Popups; there are also third party tools which achieve the same functionality (the Google Bar, Popup Cop, Popup Stop, and numerous others). 
Not all have the same amount of "granularity" in being able to differentiate between requested popups and forced popups... some simply disallow their use. 
The W3C WCAG Guideline states,"...Until user agents allow users to turn off spawned windows...". 
Many will argue that we are there now; some UA's do allow the ability to turn them off, and users are doing so in droves. 
Why then would you attempt to swim upstream? 
Surely creative people can come up with alternative ways of providing the same type of functionality using alternative methods... (I've come up with a few myself... interested parties should enquire off list). 
So... if I've not convinced you on the merits of avoiding popups and new browser windows, I guess you've already made up your mind. 
Too bad. 
For while popup help windows are easy for a developer to implement, they exclude some or at least make things harder for some users. 
If a client *really* wants to launch outside links in external windows, I guess it's easier to do than trying to convince them why they shouldn't. 
Arguments that these abilities provide for a "richer" web experience however will fall on deaf ears here... Cheers!

** "target=new" attribute in the a href tag. 
It doesn't need to be ** specifically the word "new" - it can be "target=blank" or what have you. 
There is a specific target, which might be _new (with a leading underscore) that always opens in a new window. 
Otherwise the browser will try to open in an existing window of the same name - windows are treated like detached frames, and suffer the same inability to encode the complete screen state in a URL that framesets have. 
The only special target I half remember is _top, which should *always* be used when linking off site, as it replaces the whole nested set of nested framesets with the contents from the new link. 
(This does assume that your lawyers/marketing people haven't insisted that you start a new window in this case.) 
These are generally modal, and, to a large extent can be treated as special standard controls, rather than an arbitrary new document. 
It depends on which of the file manager applications you use. 
winfile doesn't. 
Windows explorer doesn't. 
I think that My computer does. 
I don't use XP enough to know if it has changed again.
