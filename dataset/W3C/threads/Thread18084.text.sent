******* Section 17.11 of the HTML 4 [1] specification describes accesskey and tabindex. 
[1] http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/forms.html#h-17.11 - Ian Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org) http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs Cell: +1 917 450-8783 Mickey, One of the problems of the W3C HTML 4.0 specification is that it only describes the syntax of how to markup an element to attach an accesskey. 
There is no specification of behavior. 
The only implementation that I know of is for IE 4.0 and IE 5.0. 
Basically it uses the ALT key in combination with the accessksy specified to move the focus to a link or control.
