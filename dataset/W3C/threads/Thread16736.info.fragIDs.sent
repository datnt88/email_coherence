After several very cheering responses to my Online Writer column this morning (it's at ego deflated a bit when I realized the column could have provided one very useful link for anyone interested in pursuing plain writing. 
It's the Plain Language Action Network, at http://plainlanguage.gov/ -- and it has a great deal of helpful material. 
The Reference Library link is especially valuable. 
Among other treasures, it supplies the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission handbook on plain language in PDF format *and* links to plain-language sites outside the US--in the UK, Canada, Australia, even Sweden. 
Worth a bookmark.
