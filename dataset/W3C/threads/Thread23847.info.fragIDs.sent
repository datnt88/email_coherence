<s> Piracy The outline information in the PFR is encrypted to prevent piracy.  </s>
<s> I think I've said this before, it took me 30mins to figure the decryption method (that was just thinking time), once I'd figured it I "did" a font in 10mins, so much for that encryption.  </s>
<s> Hackers could conceivably crack the PFR's but they'd have to collect a lot of them and do major tweakage in Fontographer before they could assemble a maybe complete character set including redoing hinting, character mapping and kerning (can you spell get a life?).  </s>
<s> A few copy and pastes and you're there, even if you don't get a full set you're going to get 90% of U&amp;lc from a smallish site, the whole set from a large one.  </s>
<s> The amount of work is minimal compared to designing and digitising a font from scratch.  </s>
<s> Web designers need to recognize the highly skilled work and long hours involved in creating quality typefaces and support the artists who gain their livelyhood from this work by buying type from reputable distributers, type designers and foundries.  </s>
<s> I think this is the most telling thing that Andrew says.  </s>
<s> The fact that he has to point it out is scarey enough.  </s>
<s> The problem here as I see it is that TrueDoc pays no heed to embedding bits or licensing, Bitstream constantly repeat the mantra "and developers you can be confident that our technology using a non infringing data type and is completely legal", fact is it isn't true.  </s>
<s> Ok, it is true in the US, but only if a type design isn't covered by Design Patent.  </s>
<s> It is illegal in many other countries including Canada, Australia, New Zealand and most of Europe.  </s>
<s> Not only that, any foundry could change its licensing agreement to specifically exclude conversion to TrueDoc.  </s>
<s> If Bitstream could be persuaded to make TrueDoc obey embedding bits and licensing hard coded into font formats then I think many of the foundries in the world would have no problem with it.  </s>
<s> As long as they ride roughshod over other people's rights then there will be friction.  </s>
<s> Though if they did include embedding bit/code support TrueDoc would cease to be a solution to anything.  </s>
<s> Just for the record, Acrobat, as everyone knows, supports font embedding (and has done since version 1.0), but Acrobat supports hard coding in fonts to prevent embedding or force subsetting.  </s>
<s> Currently this will only work with PS fonts, there doesn't seem to be a way of coding TT fonts.  </s>
<s> TrueDoc "font resources" are no better optimised (size-wise) than CFF/Type1c/Type2.  </s>
<s> Some will dispute what I have written above, well go read the PDF specification, then come back and tell me I'm wrong.  </s>
<s> PDF on the web need be no larger than graphically rich HTML or FreeHand generated Shockwave vector art (embedded PDF has the advantage over embedded vector based Shockwave in that it actually prints, something Shockwave won't do, at least on my system).  </s>

<s> The clever semantics of Bitstream are getting old.  </s>
<s> A file containing a typeface description is a font by any standard.  </s>
<s> Calling the Truedoc fonts 'portable font resources' is a way of being gramatically correct when saying Truedoc documents don't contain fonts.  </s>
<s> But lets not kid ourselves, for all intents and purposes, PFR's are fonts.  </s>
<s> They're just as portable as Truetype fonts or type1 fonts, and contain just as many curves and serifs.  </s>
<s> PFR relies on a Truedoc rasteriser being present on the client system, just other fonts like to be rastered by their own rasterisers.  </s>
<s> There is nothing remarkably portable about Truedoc, you still have to be in luck that some company somewhere decides to write software for your platform.  </s>
<s> Whether that's Microsoft, Adobe or Bitstream does not really matter.  </s>

<s> Microsoft and Adobe are at least trying to address the issues.  </s>
<s> Bitstream only invented a blanket excuse to the entire system and ignores it for the rest.  </s>
<s> Note that Bitstream has become yet another internet wannabe, and has severed most ties to their typographic past.  </s>
<s> The legal issues tied to Truedoc in most countries not USA will certainly be investigated and possibly tried in court.  </s>
<s> It's curious that Netscape is getting tied up with such a risky technology.  </s>
<s> Bitstream has used the argument that Truedoc fonts are inseperable from the document as a way to illustrate that the PFR's really are not fonts.  </s>
<s> But this is losing credibility, as PFR fonts are now downloaded _separately_ from a server 'just like a gif or jpeg'.  </s>
<s> That means that unless something incredibly complicated (signatures?) happens, PFR fonts can be linked to by any other document as well, perhaps from an entirely different domain.  </s>
<s> Then the world needs only one single PFR on a site for every typeface used in the world!  </s>
<s> Subsetting this font can be easily subverted by making a document that contains all characters.  </s>
<s> PFR fonts can be offered as incentives, they can be traded, posted, mailed, reused.  </s>

<s> Serious flaws that threatens all type manufacturers.  </s>
<s> As long as fonts cost money, there will be an incentive for getting them for free.  </s>
<s> Truedoc fonts in Netscape make that a whole lot easier.  </s>
