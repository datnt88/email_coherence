<s> I've just looked through the N-triples section of the test cases draft [1].  </s>
<s> I think it's fine to publish as WD.  </s>
<s> I do have some small comments for consideration, [1] http://www.w3.org/2001/08/rdf-test/#ntriples Section 3:  </s>
<s> NOTE: N-Triples is not an user RDF syntax - it is intended for RDF Core WG testing purposes and checking RDF applications for conformance with the specifications.  </s>
<s> I'm not sure what is meant here by "user RDF syntax" -- I could claim the  </s>
<s> same applies to RDF/XML.  </s>
<s> Suggest something like: N-Triples is not recommended for general exchange of RDF data - ...  </s>
<s> Section 3.1: language ::= ( character - ( '.' | ws ) )+ and containing any allowed xml:lang content as defined in The syntax production here is very generalized compared with the RFC3066 syntax productions (and RFC1766 before it, as cited by the cited document).  </s>
<s> I suggest either: (a) don't give any syntax production, just cite the REC-xml section, OR  </s>
<s> (b) give a syntax that matches the RFC3066 production, which in ABNF is: The language tag is composed of one or more parts: A primary language subtag and a (possibly empty) series of subsequent subtags.  </s>
<s> The syntax of this tag in ABNF [RFC 2234] is: Language-Tag = Primary-subtag *( "-" Subtag ) Primary-subtag = 1*8ALPHA Subtag = 1*8(ALPHA / DIGIT) The productions ALPHA and DIGIT are imported from RFC 2234; they denote respectively the characters A to Z in upper or lower case and the digits from 0 to 9. The character "-" is HYPHEN-MINUS (ABNF: %x2D).  </s>
<s> -- http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3066.txt  </s>
<s> (I'm not sure offhand if the XML syntax notation can do the counted sequence productions.)  </s>
<s> Section 3.2: Given the restricted use for N-triples, per note in section 3, this paragraph seems out of place: It is recommended but not required that the resulting Unicode character string be made available to applications in UTF-8 encoding.  </s>
<s> I suggest dropping it.  </s>
<s> Section 3.3: This read oddly to me: URI references are sequences of US-ASCII character productions as defined in [RFC 2396] or must result in a URI reference after the standard escaping procedure is applied.  </s>
<s> The procedure is applied when passing the URI reference to a URI resolver.  </s>
<s> The standard escaping procedure is described in [RFC 2396] using UTF-8 as the character encoding.  </s>
<s> Hmmm... when does N-triples call for a URIref to be passed to a resolver?  </s>
<s> I'm not sure exactly what is intended here, but I think it was something like this: URI references are sequences of US-ASCII character productions as defined in [RFC 2396] for a URI character sequence.  </s>
<s> Where the original URIref contains characters not allowed in such a sequence, the standard escaping procedure described in [RFC 2396] using UTF-8 as the character encoding is applied, using UTF-8 as the character encoding.  </s>

<s> Graham Klyne said:  </s>
<s> This disclaimer is there because this syntax is primarily for test cases and has not been designed in particular, to be very easy to use with for non--US-ASCII, which is a requirement for all new W3C formats.  </s>
<s> Hence the dumb restrictions and verbosity (but clarity) we have on it that would be removed for a more user-friendly language.  </s>
<s> Such a language would be nearer N3 that this.  </s>
<s> I've changed this to NOTE: N-Triples is an RDF syntax intended for RDF Core WG testing purposes and checking RDF applications for conformance with the specifications.  </s>
<s> The recommended RDF exchange syntax is RDF/XML as defined in [RDF-SYNTAX].  </s>

<s> Funnily, Jeremy suggested removing that citation.  </s>
<s> and Jeremy didn't suggest this.  </s>
<s> Personally I'd something nearer the latter.  </s>
<s> I'll wait for some more feedback before changing this.  </s>
<s> It was only a suggestion.  </s>
<s> Deleted.  </s>
<s> I was wondering about linking it [RDF-CONCEPTS] sections?  </s>
<s> Changed to your wording.  </s>

<s> That works for me.  </s>
<s> Jeremy's suggestion was closer to my (b):  </s>
<s> Not quite, but close.  </s>
<s> Jeremy's suggested syntax allows a few forms that are not permitted by RFC3066, but I think it's probably as close as one can get without count restrictions (or some very tedious syntax productions.  </s>
<s> I'm happy either way.  </s>
<s> My main concern was that there were two very different forms of definition.  </s>
