<s> The commentary at http://www.w3.org/Submission/2002/06/Comment discusses the limitation of "rights" languages with respect to expressing all  </s>
<s> possible exceptions.  </s>
<s> I have been interested in this subject for some  </s>
<s> time, prompted initially by talking to representatives of various  </s>
<s> societies for blind people in the context of eBook consumption.  </s>
<s> It struck me that expressing low-level definitions of permitted actions  </s>
<s> is where things start to go wrong.  </s>
<s> If I say that an eBook can only be  </s>
<s> consumed using a certain font, on a certain device, etc, etc, then the  </s>
<s> exception of allowing a text-to-speech conversion is ruled out.  </s>
<s> However, a publisher could not possibly think of all the exceptions.  </s>
<s> It  </s>
<s> is simply not scalable.  </s>
<s> Would it not be better to allow some form of trusted interpretation of a  </s>
<s> higher-level set of rules?  </s>
<s> Before people start shouting about  </s>
<s> complexity, I don't say this is an easy task, and it certainly requires  </s>
<s> a well thought-out trust framework.  </s>
<s> Using trusted interpretation that takes account of trusted context, one  </s>
<s> might even be able to tackle some of the "70 years after death" issues  </s>
<s> (a certificate from a trusted agency attesting to date of death might  </s>
<s> form part of the context of interpretation).  </s>
<s> Interpretation is not restricted to changing existing rules; it might introduce some new ones, based on well-defined meta rules.  </s>
<s> I attach a paper (Zip archive containing HTML + 5 images) that I don't  </s>
<s> think I've shared with this list before (I might have, if so, apologies), although it has been shared with MPEG and OeBF so some readers may have seen it.  </s>
<s> It explores some ideas around the above theme.  </s>
<s> Please view the ideas as examples, and not an attempt at a definitive answer.  </s>
<s> I'd be interested in responses.  </s>

<s> Along the lines of David Parrott's excellent posting, I refer members of this list to the following: Mulligan, D., Burstein, A., and Erickson, J. Supporting Limits on Copyright Exclusivity in a Rights Expression Language Standard.  </s>
<s> A requirements submission to the OASIS Rights Language Technical Committee.  </s>
<s> On behalf of The Samuelson Law, Technology &amp; Public Policy Clinic, and The Electronic Privacy Information Center.  </s>
<s> August 13, 2002.  </s>
<s> From the Introduction: Copyright law grants certain rights to purchasers and other users of copyrighted works.  </s>
<s> It is neither a legal nor a practical requirement for users to declare (or claim) these rights explicitly in order to enjoy them.  </s>
<s> While the public's legal rights cannot be altered by Digital Rights Management (DRM) systems per se, we can imagine scenarios in which DRM systems may require users to make these kinds of declarations, in order to work around inherent technical limitations.  </s>
<s> It is therefore essential that a rights expression language (REL) provide the vocabulary necessary for individuals to express, in a straightforward way, the rights that copyright law grants them to use materials.  </s>
<s> The user's claim of right would provide the essential information for a usage-rights issuing agency to give the user the technical capability to use the work in a particular way.  </s>
<s> For the purposes of this discussion we will set aside the question of whether contract law may qualify (or narrow) the rights that a recipient of a work has under copyright law, acknowledging that there are contexts in which a party may wish to narrow the rights it grants to the recipient of a work.  </s>
<s> Outside the context of the relationships created by copyright between rights holders and users, there are contractual relationships that the REL must also support.  </s>
<s> For example an employer may want to control employee use of company information.  </s>
<s> In  </s>
<s> many instances it is important that both parties in the relationship be able to  </s>
<s> assert their rights and/or desired terms.  </s>
<s> True negotiation between parties requires that, at a minimum, the REL provide the vocabulary and syntax to support bi-directional exchanges.  </s>
<s> Otherwise, the rights transaction reduces to the mere request for and acceptance of an offer of permissions asserted by the rights holder.  </s>
<s> This document therefore suggests certain accommodations that DRM architectures, and especially their rights expression language components, must make to adequately express certain core principles of copyright law.  </s>
<s> Rights holders must have the means to express that a work is available on terms that reflect existing copyright law, as opposed to the limitations of a simple contract.  </s>
<s> The REL must also enable rights holders to express the more generous terms -i.e. copyleft, with attribution - commonly attached to digital resources today.  </s>
<s> At a minimum, recipients of works must have the ability to assert their rights as recognized under copyright law, and have these assertions reflected in their ability to use the work.  </s>
<s> Extending an REL to support a broader range of statements that reflect current law is, however; insufficient.  </s>
<s> The rights messaging protocol (RMP) layer must also be extended to accommodate both the downstream and upstream assertion of rights.  </s>
<s> We recognize that the RMP layer is not currently within the scope of this discussion, but we believe that the assumption of a one-way expression of rights has in part led to the current deficiencies in the REL.  </s>
<s> We will first review the DRM Reference Model, a generic view of how current DRM systems operate and the basis for our discussion.  </s>
<s> Next, we review the general  </s>
<s> copyright reference model and explore specific exceptions to authors' exclusive  </s>
<s> rights.  </s>
<s> We will then discuss and illustrate the tension between the DRM Reference Model and the norms of copyright law and practice.  </s>
<s> In conclusion, we recommend the establishment of a standardized rights messaging protocol and recommend changes to the REL to increase its capacity to support copyright-consistent expressions.  </s>
<s> While these changes do not reconcile the DRM Reference Model with the legal framework of copyright, they will enhance the ability of DRM system specification to accommodate both purchasers and rights holders who are concerned with maintaining fair use activities.  </s>

<s> David, I'm obviously way behind on my email, but I thank you for the piece on rights, which I will look over more carefully in the next few days.  </s>
<s> I am concerned about the enumeration of rights as well, but perhaps from another point of view.  </s>
<s> As someone involved in academic/non-profit  </s>
<s> information I find the requirement to list of positive rights to be a  </s>
<s> barrier.  </s>
<s> How would I, in most rights languages today, state that I wish the work to be in the public domain?  </s>
<s> Must I list EVERYTHING that one is allowed to do with the work?  </s>
<s> Similarly if I want my file to have to standard GNU licensing terms - I would have a long list of "do's" to express what is a fairly simple license.  </s>
<s> Copyright law tells you what you cannot do, and leaves the rest to your imagination.  </s>
<s> This prevents certain behaviors but allows for some level of freedom and innovation.  </s>
<s> Reversing this to be: "if it isn't listed here you can't do it" is going to run afoul of technological change very quickly.  </s>
<s> If nothing else I want DRM systems to have a switch where I can say: this license lists permissions/this license lists prohibitions.  </s>

<s> Hi Karen, a very interesting suggestion that also would cover the grey-areas we defined at the DRM-Workshop.  </s>
<s> Perhaps Renato can tell us more whether ODRL could also work with this upside-down concept.  </s>
<s> It might also be the case that this can make DRM  </s>
<s> less threatening in the overall community thus making it overall possible.  </s>
<s> The best was always the enemy of the good.  </s>
<s> The will for too much protection might hinder any acceptance of protection.  </s>
<s> ..yet another piece in the mosaic..  </s>
<s> I'm pleased to see that my comment on the submission triggered a reaction.  </s>
<s> It has taken me a long time as I tried to really understand.  </s>

<s> Karen, I have never been comfortable with positive rules only.  </s>
<s> Indeed, none of my requirements submissions to the various standards efforts has ever assumed positive rights only.  </s>
<s> As you say, it is often far simpler to list negative exceptions than positive rules.  </s>
<s> There is a tendency for technologists to vote for whatever is the more straightforward to implement.  </s>
<s> I believe that is why there is a bias towards positive rules only.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, whatever languages become the standards, they must be technically "implementable" in the domains in which we seek to implement them.  </s>
<s> Usually, the best way to drive these things is to participate in the standards efforts and to submit use-cases.  </s>
<s> I don't know of any academic studies of expressiveness for the various flavours of language construct that exist today (grateful to hear, if anyone else does), so use-case scenarios are probably the best we have right now for testing expressiveness.  </s>
