Topic 1. 
For Images that are defined in OBJECT , how will a long description be implemented?? 
What implications does this have for the use of LONGDESC with the IMG tag? 
three options: - free style: in the object content, which is its short description, put a link to the long description in plain french or using a D. photo of the earth from space A HREF=long.htm D /A - rel convention: in addition to free style, you mark the A to the long desc with rel=longdesc (or dlink) photo of the earth from space A REL=longdesc HREF=long.htm 
D /A - using param: photo of the earth from space A HREF=long.htm D /A adding semantic (like REL or PARAM) allows for better processing on the UA side. 
we need more experience from user or object param to decide. 
Wendy also raised a issue with nested OBJECT and which long desc applies to what, that I'd like to see presented in relation to that. 
none, I think we should drop mention dlink for IMG altogether, just talk about LONGDESC, people that do longdesc before it's in tools will and can decide for themselves if they add D links or not. 
The PARAM method described by Daniel seems a good solution, since it allows UAs to construct a pretty form of nested LONGDESCs for nested OBJECTs. 
Personally I favour the use of D-links as well. 
Using REL="dlink" would provide the same capacity for UAs should they choose to take it up, without leaving behind everyone else. 
I am against the use of LONGDESC on IMG - I think D-links should be used instead. 
The real truth is that ONJECT should be used instead, as this would provide an impetus for the UA makers to implement it properly. 
At any rate, it seems more likely that OBJECT will be implemented than LONGDESC (and TITLE) by the 'big 2', since both MSIE 4 and Netscape 4 offer some kind of support for it already.

In response to Charles McCathieNevile, I don't think OBJECT will ever be used much for the rendering of images, since the IMG tag is backwards compatible with older browsers and most authoring tools support only the IMG tag for images. 
I am curous why you are against using LONGDESC.

I disagree that PARAM is the best place. 
The whole idea of LONGDESC was because ALT, while allowing very long strings, does not allow markup. 
The inner text of OBJECT allows for markup. 
Also, how will the user agent "know" to read the PARAM? 
Most OBJECT 's have multiple PARAMs. 
Seems very clear to me that the designers of HTML knew that the best place for additional information about the OBJECT . 
The HTML 4.0 specification says: "One significant consequence of the OBJECT element's design is that it offers a mechanism for specifying alternate object renderings; each embedded OBJECT declaration may specify alternate content types." 
I say that the markup is the best place for that information. 
I agree that PARAM is the best way to mark longdesc in OBJECT. 
The philosiphy of the PARAM element is to be able to include attributes to OBJECT. 
However since new object types may require different attributes, by using PARAM rather than attributes to OBJECT one wouldn't need to change the HTML specs whenever a new object type is born. 
Althogh longdesc may be considered generic, and not object-type dependent the absence of longdesc as an attribute justifies using the PARAM mechanism. 
Being somewhat pedantic, concerning an example previously on this mailing list, PARAM elements must come before any other content of the OBJECT.

using PARAM to provide a LONGDESC for OBJECTs is analagous to using LONGDESC. 
It can point to a full document, with all the markup you could want. 
It can also handle the cascade of objects nicely. 
The use of OBJECT content is slightly different - it is an either/or situation. 
The sort of problem which PARAM could solve is where an OBJECT is used with a MAP, and it is desirable both to present the OBJECT, and to give users access to a fuller description of it. 
This does not mean OBJECT should not have content - it MUST.

I am against prioritising LONGDESC higher than D-link, since the latter works and the former doesn't. 
In order to provide backwards compatibility I agree that IMG will be with us for some time to come, if only as part of the content of OBJECTs. 
If one accepts that argument, it makes sense in such cases to use D-links, which are backwards compatible. 
To use the IMG tag, with LONGDESC but not D-links (as has been suggested on the IG list) provides backwards compatibility at the expense of accessibility, completely defeating our purpose. 
I am not actually against the use of LONGDESC per se, but I feel that it is a forward-looking solution to problems raised by the continuing use of IMG, which is completely backwards incompatible. 
The problem it solves, how to provide marked up information as an alternative to the IMG object, is better solved by OBJECT, particularly with the use of a PARAM to specify a longdesc. 
To achieve backwards compatibility AND accessibility, one should use IMG and a D-link as content for the OBJECT. 
Which makes the LONGDESC effectively redundant - it is a new solution to a problem, but before it is implemented a better solution has already been produced and partially implemented.

Daniel said my example is ridiculously complex. 
That's true. 
Where it would apply is to nested OBJECTs. 
The IMG might be a default for an image, rather than a wrapper OBJECT. 
I would prefer to push for OBJECT anyway. 
If LONGDESC is recommended practise for the future, D-link will continue to suffer. 
Since there is no real alternative in any UA so far, that seems unacceptable in the short to medium term. 
Daniel also thought we should drop the idea of using PARAM to provide a D-link/LONGDESC for OBJECT. 
I disagree. 
OBJECT is in such a prototype state at the moment that it we could implement it with very little legacy implication (by contrast to the LONGDESC/D-link case). 
And as an historian, I too like PARAM better than A REL="longdesc" Charles McCN
