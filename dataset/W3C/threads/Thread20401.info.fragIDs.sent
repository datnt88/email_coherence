<s> I am thinking about writing a tutorial to familiarize users with the features of Amaya.  </s>
<s> If I pursue this, I would like to know: * What features should I cover?  </s>
<s> * How should I format it?  </s>
<s> * What has given you the most trouble using Amaya (besides bugs)?  </s>
<s> * What formats should the tutorial be available in?  </s>
<s> Thank you ahead of time for any input.  </s>
<s> Thank you for your response, I will try to address these issues, but I have attempted to answer your problems right here.  </s>
<s> I, for one, would be quite grateful, being an illiterate in designing websites, writing webpages and coding.  </s>
<s> But learning and sensitive to the request of W3C to format personal webwriting the right way.  </s>
<s> Questions I am struggling with right now are: * Why and what is the difference between the possible documentformats  </s>
<s> The different document formats include HTML, XHTML, XML, PDF, and many others.  </s>
<s> I will probably use an XML based language since it is easy to convert to other XML-based formats.  </s>
<s> * What is a loose DTD  </s>
<s> A loose DTD includes pieces of HTML that are now deprecated (shouldn't be used).  </s>
<s> * How do you use Amaya with a prescribed DTD, or CSS  </s>
<s> What exactly do you mean by prescribed DTD, or CSS?  </s>
<s> * Can Amaya be the editor in something like Frontpage (I tried this but the programme got stuck)  </s>
<s> I highly doubt it, but I am not a developer so you might ask one of them.  </s>
<s> Besides, I don't think Microsoft would like it.  </s>
<s> * I will make a list of explained codes to consult myself, what is p, what is block, what href, etc. Strange, every programmemanual I read does not have this, one has to buy or borrow a book.  </s>
<s> p is paragraph.  </s>
<s> In HTML, the p element is used to markup where a paragraph begins and ends.  </s>
<s> A block starts on a new line, while inline elements are, well, inline.  </s>
<s> div is a block element, while span is an inline element.  </s>
<s> href is an attribute used to give a hypertext reference.  </s>
<s> This is most used in anchors and links.  </s>
<s> Forgive me if the above is stupid, but you asked.  </s>
<s> No question is ever stupid.  </s>
<s> Asking questions is how you learn.  </s>
<s> Don't put yourself down for asking questions or let others put you down for doing so.  </s>
<s> In article 3CD33E1E.3030002@cherokeescouting.org ,  </s>
<s> Mmmmm! Thinks!  </s>
<s> Seriously, What about writing a Schema for Tut-ML and then xslt's for HTML, xhtml, PDF, TeX(?). etc - then tutorials can be written for many kinds of software - particularly that produced by W3C of course - I think in particular of the XML Schema Part 0. Just thought!  </s>

<s> Hi Brant, I think this is a great idea.  </s>
<s> I would be inclined to include it as a supplement to the user manual.  </s>
<s> Are you aware of the (pretty basic) attempt at some tutorial stuff I did that was in the documentation until the rewrite?  </s>
<s> (I think it is still in CVS).  </s>
<s> I would suggest that you do this in HTML.  </s>

<s> My 2 cents: For the features: who is the target of your tutorial?  </s>
<s> - Is it a writer who moves from any other wordprocessor to Amaya?  </s>
<s> cover the amaya interface and the results - Is it a writer who moves from any other wordprocessor to HTML? cover the html basics and how to use them - Is it a writer who moves from any other wordprocessor to XML? cover html and xml basics and compare them to show differences.  </s>
<s> - Is it an experienced html/xml writer who moves to Amaya?  </s>
<s> cover the amaya features and show what happens in the code.  </s>
<s> In general, I prefer to point users to strictly separate the document from it's style: In the document use only the available html codes, put al the style in a stylesheet.  </s>
<s> Specially for professionals: one corporate stylesheet for the basic layout and optionally cascaded stylesheets for tech-documentation and other dedicated usage.  </s>
<s> For the format: use the Amaya make-book featrue as with the amaya manual.  </s>
<s> My troubles with amaya is where to find the features.  </s>
<s> It does not conform to any other tool I use so I frequently browse the menus in search for features.  </s>
<s> BTW: Do NOT make your tutorial a walk trough the featrues!  </s>
<s> Better make some short tutorials to create several dedicate pages.  </s>
<s> Start with a "hello World" page and show what it does.  </s>
<s> Then define several types of documents.  </s>
<s> End with a tutorial on how you created your tutorial, including the cascaded style sheets and other fancy stuff.  </s>
<s> I think you document sould be available in multy page html as the amaya manual is.  </s>
<s> Using amaya, every user can create a single page html (Special- MakeBook).  </s>
<s> With any browser, every user can create their required format, hence do not bother to create postscript, pdf or any other propriatry format.  </s>
<s> CBee  </s>
<s> * Can Amaya be the editor in something like Frontpage (I tried this but the programme got stuck)  </s>
<s> No, it's very easy to use another editor within FrontPage, just go to Tools  Options  Configure Editors FrontPage will not alter any source code.  </s>
<s> However, to avoid version conflicts and allow working on server-based webs, FrontPage passes temporary copies to external editors, not the original files.  </s>
<s> Thus, saving the file in Amaya (or any other editor other than frontpg.exe)  </s>
<s> doesn't affect the original file.  </s>
<s> FrontPage won't update it until you close Amaya.  </s>
<s> Best regards, Christoph Schneegans  </s>
