<s> As mentioned in last week's meeting I have begun drafting a new charter [1].  </s>
<s> It is still very rough.  </s>
<s> As usual, the roughest areas are marked with double at signs (@@).  </s>
<s> note that the charter is for a working group.  </s>
<s> This would officially combine the current IG and WG groups into one group.  </s>
<s> I look forward to your comments, --wendy [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/erwg-charter.html wendy a chisholm world wide web consortium web accessibility initiative madison, wi usa  </s>
<s> I would like to see something in the mission statement to the effect that we want to encourage that all tools used in accessibility matters be themselves accessible to PWDs.  </s>
<s> This is often overlooked, to put it mildly.  </s>
<s> It wouldn't hurt to include this "urge" in other sections as well even to the point of using our forum to exemplify these issues.  </s>
<s> An ERT that cannot be used by its supposed beneficiary is an abomination.  </s>
<s> If it can be worked out I would like to see a *lot* of emphasis on the "accessibilizing" of Amaya (esp.  </s>
<s> in Section 4) as an example of what can be done.  </s>
<s> Ultimately that "test bed" should include most/all of the tools' functions that we uncover/create - possibly to the extent that Section 5 contain some language indicating that a true "success criterion" would be a usable tool that encompassed accessible authoring, browsing, evaluating, and repairing "stuff Web".  </s>
<s> As there is no longer much "big buck" potential in editors/browsers there will be little to preclude support from many sources in making our stuff, particularly Amaya, very open and free.  </s>
<s> As the Web becomes more application-intensive it will be commonplace to use the Web to surf and publish to the Web ("recursive"?) with nothing much in the way of localized computing power.  </s>
<s> But we must always keep our "eyes on the prize" and heavily emphasize that at all stages of this undertaking, the product must itself be accessible.  </s>
<s> Love.  </s>
<s> ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE  </s>
<s> Just one thought on the charter - Under 2.1 - Intended audience of tools - you mention transformation tools as a possible related tool to Repair.  </s>
<s> Maybe it would help to view repair tools as on-line and off-line tools.  </s>
<s> An off-line tool would assist an author in repairing a page prior to posting.  </s>
<s> An on-line tool would transform the page on the fly for a user encountering a page with a particular access problem.  </s>
<s> Where the two tools could accomplish the same "repairs" automatically, they could use the same algorithm, though the off-line tool could do a lot more due to author querying.  </s>
