Hi, I've been thinking about the table issue and am not at all comfortable with the proposal that access to tables will be provided by the access technology without the access technology developers agreeing to the approach. 
In a way, what is being proposed is that access technology will also need to include certain aspects of browser technology. 
Do access technology developers really want to do that or are they being forced into it to compensate for the limitations resulting from various browser developers' refusal to provide appropriate direct access in the software being developed? 
I'm considering posting a note to some blind-related mailing lists which the various access developers read and get their opinions on this issue. 
If most of the access technology developers do want to also develop browser technology, then I probably won't have a problem with what is being proposed.

These are good questions and they should be answered. 
In my experience, very little good information can be gotten off of the various blindness related mailing lists. 
Just email the companies directly. 
Mostly the technical support staff monitor the mailing lists, not their developers. 
However, this exact issue was discussed in detail at one of the face to face meetings. 
A particular concern was that the "native" implementation would be too generic and not serve the particular needs of any sub-set of users. 
This leads to the discussion that as a whole, there isn't much need to unroll or linearize tables VISUALLY on the screen. 
Very few users require that. 
Accessibility aid vendors can currently get the information about the table structure and use it. 
Only one vendor "forces" unrolling by modifying the object model. 
Several other vendors use the object model (in this case, Active Accessibility) to discover the structure of the table and provide navigation.

Scott said: "I am not at all comfortable with the proposal that access to tables will be provided by the access technology without the access technology developers agreeing to the approach ..." Isn't access to tables something that the access technology developer can use to make their product better than the competition? 
I look at it that way for IBM Home Page Reader.

In response to Scott, The object model approach is becoming the standard means for AT companies access information, at least in windows. 
Many vendors are AT already using the Active Accessibility to access object models for MS-Word and MS-Excel to access information. 
We are contacting ATIA to encourage member companies to review the next working draft release. 
We are contact the ATIA president and trying to get his cooperation in helping to get ATIA member companies more interested in reviewing and hopefully participating in the working groups.

Jim-- It's true that quality of table rendering --or any other form of rendering for that matter can be used by speech browsers (as with any other browser) to differentiate a specific tool/user-agent in the market place. 
However, this does not necessarily argue in favor of having a broken world to start with --just so the various screenreader vendors can compete on the basis of their specific ideosyncracies and kluges. 
I do not think IBM home page reader would do the above (somewhat dubious/immoral marketing)-- but I'm afraid screen-reader vendors in general will simply stick in heuristics that work for specific pages or popular sites and then market their product on this basis. 
Take the current state of affairs with Windows screen-readers-- in the last few years, each vendor has tried to say "we're the best because we can do foo with application bar" --and the net effect is that most if not every screen-reader impaired user I know has more than one screenreader installed --simply because "screenreader foo works in a desirable manner with application bar --but not with something else" --the combinatorial explosion of this mess that would result if access vendors started touting how well they worked with a specific site or class of sites e.g. CNN or Time is mind-boggling --the resulting FUD that would result helps no one.

This "explosion" of features is exactly what I'm getting at regarding needing a standard interface for communication with AT devices. 
If the back end of access systems, whether input or output, were standardized, then products would differentiate themselves in terms of the user interface. 
A screen reader would be noteworthy in terms of ease of use and configurability of controls rather than the fact that it will read an Excel spreadsheet or other specific application that may not matter to some set of users.
