Can someone provide a roughly comprehensive list of cognitive disability types and what problems those people might have in accessing information? 
For example: DISABILITY ACCESS PROBLEM Dyslexia May not be able to read words quickly and may not be able to enter text (such as in search boxes) without misspellings etc. 
Note that I'm not a dyslexia expert so the above entry is probably WRONG, it's an example of the type of information I'd like to see listed. 
(The next step in the chart above, of course, would be a third column that describes how we can best address those access problems and solve them!) How many types of users are we grouping together when we glibly use the term "CD"?

I recall a pointer a while back for a tool that would 'greek' a web page so you could see how comprehensible it was without the words. 
Does anybody recall where that was? 
Marti 
You can do this roughly by doing a print preview which is too small to read the text, but I don't recall specific tools that allow 'greeking'. 
I think this is a feature of some page-layout tools though.

Let's look at a slightly different approach - what are the different kinds of functional requirements? 
This doesn't really group cognitive disabilities by themselves, since the different requirements cover some other groups as well. 
But it probably helps us answer the question "what do we need to do to solve the problem?". 
Here are some guesses + Not being able to read text (but not having a problem with arbitrarily complex content) 
+ Not being able to concentrate on one thing among many potential distractions 
+ Not being able to comprehend abstract concepts without concrete examples 
+ Not being able to understand complex oral language I trust there are people in this discussion who can improve on this.

I disagree, I think we need to start with users first to make sure that we are dealing with -real- problems and not just -possible- problems. 
When we talk about access for people with CD, we need to look at them, not look primarily at groups they intersect with. 
But we've been told repeatedly (why, I don't know) that screenreaders, which compensate for inability to read text, are not a solution for CD user. 
See, to me, you're getting way to broad here. 
This is like trying to approach visual impairment by saying: + Not being able to visually recognize all objects that may be on a screen. 
In my opinion, it's much more helpful to look at the different types of visually impaired users -- those who are completely blind, those who can see with the help of magnification software, those who can't see colors -- and then proceed from there. 
It feels too much like trying to lump CD people together and then extracting "commonalities" will abstract the humans out of this equation. 
Wait, that sounds like this mailing list when dealing with CD issues.

Humnour me for a moment, please *grin*. 
Actually, what we are told is that 
there are some people who cannot read text easily, but for whom screenreaders are indeed helpful. 
There are other people who not only cannot easily read text, but in fact cannot understand complex written OR oral language, and screen readers will not be particularly helpful. 
Among the latter will be 
people who are deaf, and for whom any written or spokemn language is a second language. 
(Or is this an i18n problem... Actually I believe it is a disability problem, but illustrates the deeply related nature of the two areas).

Riiiiight, which is why identifing users must come before identifying accessibility hurdles. 
The same hurdle may be solved in different ways for different people -- for example, a solution for a deaf user may not be the same as a solution for a deaf-blind user! 
Agreed. 
But I think it's important that we -do- identify users with CDs distinctly before proceeding, so we know that we are indeed meeting their needs. 
Jonathan and Anne seem to be indicating that we have not, and that concerns me. 
So, humor -me- for a while, as I try to figure out who exactly we are talking about when we talk about CD users.

Well, let's look for a middle road then. 
The guidelines are written in terms of requirements to meet functional limitations - for example being unable to see hear an audio file, or to process an applet. 
So at the guideline-writing end of the process we need to understand what that requirement is. 
But you are right that the way to understand that is to understand what kinds of disability people have, and how that affects them. 
(Why that is only part of the puzzle is that the requirements we end up with are determined by a combination of what people can do and what assistive technologies can do.) 
So I am going to start a new thread from this one talking about functional requirements, and carry this one on with different types of disabilities. 
For my involvement, this one will be very general -i don't have a lot of knowledge in the area. 
So let me throw in a handful of buzzwords I have heard and ask people to try and add meaning to them (Note that interpretations of these things can vary widely. 
For example the interpretation of Attention Deficit Disorder / Hyperactivity within Autralian psychiatric/medical/educational circles is a hotly debated topic. 
But the requirements that result may be less affected than the requirements of the people debating them). 
Note that I am going to approach this not just from a cognitive disability perspective, but from a general perspective of disabilities that make reading difficult (potentially to the point of being impossible). 
Dyslexia Aphasia Autism Attention Deficit Disorder Short-term Memory loss Learning disability Downs Syndrome Acquired Brain Injury Deafness (not a cognitive disability as such, but can lead to difficulties in understanding written/oral languages in the same way that blindness can create difficulties in understanding graphics).

aloha, y'all! 
ok, so we're looking for facts and for individuals... for the former: 
or, for those of you who either understand spanish, or for whom spanish is your native tongue, the brain center contains a lot of useful information about terminology, which we might consider adapting, or at least using as a starting point to develop a working vocabulary within the working group... note: the english version of the page is table-ized -- so you might want to run it through Tablin http://jigsaw.w3.org:8000/tablin/ once again, as i requested at the L.A. Face2Face, we should take a long look at the World Health Organization's (WHO) classification schema for cognitive disabilities, since: 1. the WAI is international in nature 2. the WHO is international in scope yes, i know that there have been objections to using the WHO classifications in the past as they are too medically oriented, but in attempting to establish a common working vocabulary for the next iteration of the Web Content Guidelines, we need to agree upon a common working vocabulary that has a corollary in the real world, which is precisely the reason why the WHO promulgated a disabilities classification schema... no, it ain't perfect, but why should we further muddy an already opaque issue further by defining our own schema, when there is an international body which has already published one? 
as for working with persons with cognitive disabilities, the new york times today ran an obituary for Milton Brutten, a leading american authority on dyslexia and cognitive disabilities... his obit mentioned several schools and institutes with which he had been involved over the course of his life, so i decided to follow up the leads provided by the article, in the hopes that the GL WG can liaison with some of the people for whom the following resources are intended, and, by testing techniques and test suites, obtain feedback directly from a user base which has not yet had the opportunity to speak for itself... here are some of the resources i stumbled across while following up leads from the obituary: 1.

Doctor Brutten's book, "Something's Wrong With My Child," first published in 1973 and written with Charles Mangel and Dr. Sylvia Richardson, was, the obit said, quote widely considered one of the premier books on learning disabilities of its time. 
unquote has anyone read this book? is it worth reading? 
it is currently out of print, according to amazon.com, and pricescan.com 
couldn't turn up any hits on it... i did find a full citation quote Something's Wrong With My Child.

unquote which suggests that the book is available from the "The Resource Collection" of the Connecticut Parent Advocacy Center (CPAC) are Doctors Richardson and Mangel still around? 
i searched for Sylvia Richardson, and turned up a lot of inconclusive evidence... as recently as 11 November 1999, she delivered a paper at the Montessori Conference subtitled "Positive Psychology for Today's Challenges" held at the Regal Minneapolis Hotel in Minneapolis, Minnesota quote 11:00 a.m.-12 noon A Positive Outlook for Learning Disabilities, Sylvia Richardson Too often, children are labeled as learning disabled and given a specialized learning plan that focuses on their weaknesses.

unquote i'm not sure whether this is the same Doctor Richardson who co-authored Brutten's book, but it seems likely that she might be... another hit lead to an article entitled "To Promote or Retain", which appeared in the The Special Education Advocate, and in which Doctor Sylvia Richardson is quoted, can be read online at at the "Who Are We Page" of the Spalding Education Foundation, which is located at: i discovered a bit more about Doctor Richardson quote Dr. Sylvia Richardson (FL) Distinguished Professor of Communication Sciences, Clinical Professor of Pediatrics, University of So.

Dempsey, and available from: but i couldn't turn up any other information about a Doctor Charles Mengel and developmental disabilities... 4. In 1977, Doctor Brutten founded the Crossroad School for dyslexic students in Paoli, Pennsylvania; at first, the only valid hit for the Crossroads School and ADD was a page containing contact information about the school (which apparently also retired to Florida) can be found at: the listing does explicitly state quote Only caters for and specializes in the treatment of children with Attention Deficit Disorders; Residential program for children out of state/country available unquote i subsequenly found a home page for the Crossroads School which contains a "Links" link: which leads to a page of "Resources for Parents", which include 4A) LDOnline 4B) LDAP (Learning Disabilities Association of Pennsylvania) 4C) CHAADD (Children and Adults with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorders) 4D) The International Dyslexia Association whose physical contact info is: The International Dyslexia Association, International Office 8600 LaSalle Road, Chester Building, Suite 382 Baltimore, MD 21286-2044 USA Messages (800) ABCD123 Voice (410) 296-0232 4E) LDInfo.org which contains a "Resources for Parents" frame, the direct URI of which is: and a frame containing "Internet Resources for Learning Disabilities Topics", the direct URI of which is: as well as a frame listing "Organizations Concerned with Learning Disabilities", the direct URI of which is: 5. he served on the boards of many professional organizations, taught at Bryn Mawr College and Temple University -- there's a Temple University connection within the WAI, isn't there, Len? 6.

Charles a good list of CD but how does this help address their neeeds? 
Reductionist arguments are not very helpful with CD. 
Each individual has their own needs, I really think that it is the wrong approach to start from what is achievable, or technologically so. 
CD requires an overall generalisation, and we can perhaps apologise for how little has been achieved.

Re: CD resources I am stunned, a very lengthy and hopefully useful resource. 
Did Gregory visit the sites? 
Were they designed for use by clients or carers? 
Did they use graphics, sound or text? 
In my experience they will in the main be designed for academic staff, parents and carers. 
Publishing resources for CD is very time consuming. 
Many graphics packages are copyright and the owners remain unwilling to allow their use on the web. 
If you find sites that you have reason to believe would be of use to people with CD, please forward them to me. 
We will use them, they are a very rare commodity.

Re:the need to cater to individual needs: i think we can all agree that if we had to read the music in order to enjoy it most of us would be excluded. 
The photo of a pop star, the tune, the sheet, and the lyric all have uses. 
WAI and many other site are predominantly text based. 
This does not mean it is accessible. 
I for one would love to be able to select my listening by sound rather than station, in fact I currently have to any way. 
wouldn't it be wonderful to have a listening web, burble for radio 4 or discussion, shout for news, sing for music... seriously the ones amongst you who consider accessibility to be about cross browser issues are missing out. 
That's an important issue, but not even a small part of the major concerns coming. 
Multimedia is a huge area, as is preffered learning method. the relationship between these two and the technologies employed is the central concern. 
That might sound a tad eowg, but somehow the guidelines need to be people 
not technology centred and reflect the fact that accessible means different things to different people.

Re: types of CD I came across a beautiful analogy in a class this week. 
Non of the clients new of vowels and consonants. 
though one recalled the use of the words in a panel came on TV. 
They all know the names for the letters but not the sounds. 
So I asked them each to make the noise a dog, a cat and a duck make, and they all agreed that this was different from their names. 
letters don't speak but this was concrete enough an analogy to get over the idea of phonetics. 
I don't say they will have learn't this. 
However it is a huge block on reading if you learn your ABC and expect words to follow that pattern. 
Most of my students that are learning to read have got stuck on this. 
And I spend many hours on it. 
Others fail to appreciate the importanceofbreaksbetweenwords, and believe me I have terrible typing and yet every word gets a space, i had to rub them out, even though i knew what I wished to achieve. 
Most can copy and nearly all can illustrate. 
This is why it is important to them to use images. 
Symbols they can copy, whereas only a few could copy photographs. 
Most can copy text, unfortunately it does not in all cases indicate understanding. 
We all know of the reader who has not understood. 
CD is complex and whilst i could write more, i am not convinced its in our best interests. 
It is important that they also succeed. 
Before I was on the web I developed a small vb application that allowed users to author sentences by selecting pictures, the words came with them. 
It was well recieved by my colleagues. 
However about that time the web arrived, and i am still trying to get back there.

aloha, jonathan! 
i apologize for the length of the post, but i wanted to collate as many resources in one place as possible, so as to jump start the process... jonathan asked quote Did Gregory visit the sites? 
unquote i at least verified that the resources to which i pointed the WG still exist, and spent a bit of time dipping into each site, save for most of the individual schools' sites... jonathan also asked, quote Did they use graphics, sound or text? 
unquote most of the sites do incorporate graphics, but i was actually hoping that you might visit them, and give us an analysis as to whether or not any of the sites i referenced would actually be of use to the CD community (however nebulously defined that term remains within the WG) -- particularly those sites listed as "Resources" jonathan asked, quote Were they designed for use by clients or carers? 
unquote most -- if not all of the sites -- were designed and implemented by either care-givers, teachers, academics, or parents, but some of them have sections designed for use by children with quote learning disabilities unquote the main point, however, in posting such an extensive list of resources, was not only to improve our understanding of the term cognitive disabilities, but to point us towards resources through whom, and with whom, we can work directly with individuals with cognitive disabilities, so as to solicit their individualized feedback as to what they need in order to access content on the web... many of the resources listed -- including all of the schools -- i envision not as an end in themselves, but the means to an end -- basically a bridge between the GL WG and persons with cognitive disabilities -- especially those for whom access to the web is currently either unavailable or extremely difficult... it is my earnest hope and desire that this WG ensure that any checkpoints and techniques relating to cognitive disabilities first be tested by persons with a wide range of what are generally classified as cognitive disabilities, in order to ensure that any checkpoints we require web content designers to implement are based firmly in reality, and do not rely upon the theories of a particular faction of care-givers or academics... gregory.

Re: email for online resources? 
I certainly think there is ample need for a study of current web resources. 
Equally it would certainly be a benefit to evaluate their success for end users. 
It could be useful to make general suggestions regarding their commanalities with pointers to specific examples. 
I'd certainly be interested in (and am) contributing to this process. 
It is an ambitious project especially if you expect to author materials from the guidelines produced, and check their suitability. 
I think the first step, would be to assume that all resources that appeared to be designed for CD were successful. 
Given teachers are busy, and why would they be wasting time? 
Secondly I would probably ignore material designed for carers, academics... Unless specifically designed to help authoring. 
I would estimate that we are already planning for us to look at 1000s of pages, and I have a 56 connection which can be very slow state side. 
Perhaps we could email CD colleges and institutions asking them to send us links, given the group effort and make it a professional approach. 
We'd then have to publish the results... jay@peepo.com

I agree with this. 
This "apologize" attitude, though, is bullsh*t. 
For god's sake, man, quit insulting those of us who are trying to work with you on a solution, and stop harping on the idea that there's an intentional attempt to disenfranchise people. 
The -only- disenfranchisement that I've seen on this issue have been the number of people who your attitude has turned off, and are thus unwilling to work with you on this, and are waiting for a better spokesman for the needs of CD users to come along. 
I'm not in that category myself (yet?), but little tricks such as suggesting an "apology" should be made contribute very little to solving this problem.

Okay, how? 
I, for one, am sold, and have been sold on this for quite a while. 
I'm just waiting to hear some specific ways to meet the needs of THESE people. 
If you're expecting ME to figure that part of the problem out, it's not going to happen -- I'm not the expert on CD, I'm the expert on web design. 
Tell me what you know needs to be done, and we can go from there. 
So, uh, how do we meet the needs of these people? 
I still have had little concrete information this. 
Here's a hint: Saying "use pictures!" means -very very little- in this context. 
Kynn Bartlett kynn@operamail.com 
My Browser Is Faster Than Yours 
Hi folks, I agree with Kynn that we are here to meet the needs of all users with disabilities. 
If we have not done so to date, it is certainly not out of ill will, and therefore I don't think apologies are required. 
It is more likely that other constraints, including human resources, time, and understanding the problems, have prevented us from doing more (and more is clearly required). 
I personally cannot apologize for being busy trying to produce three Recommendations to promote the accessibility of the Web. 
I am convinced that all of us here are just as dedicated and just as busy. 
There is more work to be done, notably on CD, and the WG has been expending considerable energy and bandwidth to improve the situation. 
Please continue to use the list to promote and exchange ideas so that more can be done for the communities we are trying to serve. 
If you want to address extra-professional issues, please do so off the list with the Chairs or the W3C Team members in this Working Group.

Kynn, A fairly conservative list of cognitive issues is copied below from a paper describing work funded by the NIH. 
Note that these topics are concepts and are difficult to quantify. 
Many are perceived to be situational and have more to do with what can be measured than how cognition actually works. 
At any rate, the list does provide a starting point for thinking about the design of web pages and supports for at least a subset of these topics. 
It will be nearly impossible to take them all into consideration so highlighting a few will be critical to the work. 
I am attempting to fit this list or some other topic list related to CD into CAST's Universal Design for Learning framework. 
I'll share that when I am just a bit further along. 
You will note that I have a pointed interest in how the Web is used for research and educational purposes so my thinking about this will have that particular bent. 
We are working on a significant upgrade to the CAST Website that will allow users to experience the types of supports that we feel all learners should have access to on the web. 
A significant problem right now is simplification (a cognitive overload issue). 
As you know, built in flexibility and redundancy can inflict complexity. 
We intent to hide the tools or support modules then gradually introduce them as users become accustomed to having such supports. 
Our intent is to provide information about how various types of learners will benefit from these supports in order to provide concrete examples of how web developers might design pages (and tools) to improve access and learning opportunities. 
It is important to note that the design of the page content is only part of the solution. 
We want to make certain that we don't create unintended barriers for various cognitive differences. 
We also have continued work on our talking browser so that learners with reading problems will have text to speech support with synchronized highlighting. 
Navigation of complex pages has been a bit challenging but significant progress has been made. 
I mention this tool to impress on the working group the solutions required for CD extend well beyond the preparation of content and it will be difficult to keep in mind the complex interplay between tools and content. 
In our case, we are using the Microsoft IE5 component as our talking browser so we benefit from improvements that made to the user agent. 
I apologize for not jumping in sooner but have had a bit too much on my plate lately. 
Further, my patience for discussions about an icon oriented world simply ran out.

Major Cognitive Dimensions Cognitive processing involves a broad range of activities involved with "thinking." 
Cognitive dimensions are intimately involved with the performance of everyday activities. 
Significantly, these dimensions are intimately involved in learning how to use computing systems, and using them. 
In attempting to turn to computer technology to overcoming cognitive disabilities, one is confronted with a cure which is intimately involved with the condition it seeks to address. 
The most widely accepted dimensions in neuroscience are as follows : Executive Function which includes diverse areas such as problem solving, planning, self-monitoring, task sequencing, prioritization, and cognitive flexibility. 
Memory which subsumes facets such as short-term, long-term, verbal and visual, procedural, declarative, and implicit memory. 
Orientation and Attention including freedom from distractibility, focused attention, and divided attention. 
Visual-Spatial Processing which includes perception and integration of visual information in space. 
Sensory-Motor Processing Language including expressive and receptive language, repetition, prosody, and speech rate, and fluency. 
Emotions encompassing control of and expression of emotions, detection and understanding of emotions, and frustration tolerance. 
Among psychologists and neuroscientists, there are a number of different classification approaches to cognitive dimensions. 
But, what can be generally agreed upon is that cognitive functions are not unidimensional. 
Rather they are comprised of many distinct operations comprising a larger network and are expressed differently depending on the particular situation. 
Cognitive dimensions are constructs, methods of classifying a phenomenon for some research purpose, and necessarily represent a simplification of a process. 
These dimensions often are related to diagnosis, and to the design of diagnostic tests (Lezak, 1995; Kolb and Whishaw, 1990; Bigler, 1988). 
Well, thanks for taking time. 
You have given a rather more professional dimension to my concerns regarding the large task involved in meeting these needs.
