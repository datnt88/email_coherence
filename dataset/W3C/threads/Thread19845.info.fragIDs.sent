<s> Hi, I've now installed amaya 1.2 LINUX-ELF on my system (glibc 2.06, PPro running kernel 2.1.85), and I like it much better than the previous version :) The layout (e.g. with tables) seems to be much improved.  </s>
<s> However, I still found some bugs.  </s>
<s> Here are a few:  </s>
<s> Scrolling still doesn't work well.  </s>
<s> The horizontal scroll bar doesn't work.  </s>
<s> Also, if I am near the top of the page, and I go up one page, amaya will sometimes go beyond the top of the page.  </s>
<s> example, look at "http://sdcc13.ucsd.edu/~bredelin/Essays/layer2.shtml".  </s>
<s> This looks strange, and you will see why if you use the structure view.  </s>
<s> Amaya has made LOTS of a name elements, instead of the original ONE in the source code.  </s>
<s> In this example, amaya draw two lists on top of each other: --------------temp.shtml---------------------  </s>
<s> I'm not sure, but its completely socially constructed.  </s>
<s> Futhermore this word represents a concept, and so illustrates the fact that everything we say is just one way of looking at things.  </s>
<s> However, this way of looking at concepts is not just one way among many, but is the only way for all non-arrogant people.  </s>
<s> Since all answers are equally correct (being socially constructed), we asked an informant from the idyllic !Kung tribe.  </s>
<s> However, we forgot the interpreter, so we "constructed" the following answer: Once upon a time a man went to the store.  </s>
<s> At the store he bought a large watermelon.  </s>
<s> The vodka is strong but the meat is rotten.  </s>
<s> --------------------------end temp.shtml--------------------  </s>
<s> Lastly, along with the scrolling problems, amaya also sometimes redraws things incorrectly, or fails to redraw images when amaya is brought out from under another window.  </s>
<s> Unfortunately, this is hard to reproduce... regards, -BenRI  </s>
<s> Thanks for your comments.  </s>
<s> Horizontal scrolling is considered as an extension for a future release.  </s>
<s> closed by a /a tag.  </s>
<s> Amaya considers that the anchor applies to all following elements until it encounters another a tag that is properly closed.  </s>
<s> Another problem with anchors in the documents you mention is that they often appear in an invalid context.  </s>
<s> The HTML 4.0 DTD (http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/sgml/dtd.html), as well as previous HTML DTDs, state that anchors are inline elements: they can only appear in block elements such as paragraphs, headings, list items, etc.  </s>
<s> In the example below, the empty anchor named "how" should be placed within the H3 element, not between that element and the previous UL.  </s>
<s> When properly placed, an empty anchor works correctly in Amaya.  </s>
<s> To avoid any trouble, you may consider validating your pages.  </s>
<s> See for instance http://validator.w3.org/  </s>

<s> Thanks for your answers.  </s>
<s> However, I still have some problems with the way amaya handles incorrect HTML.  </s>
<s> I do not know how difficult it is to handle mistakes in HTML, but I like the fact that amaya usually complains about them, and I hope it is possible to make amaya even "smarter."  </s>
<s> Bug: Amaya draws the sample document (bottom of this message) incorrectly.  </s>
<s> The second list is drawn on top of the first!  </s>
<s> To fix this problem, all I have to do is add a space after the /a , which seems rather broken.  </s>
<s> Anyway, it is possible that the a element should be inside the h3 and should not be empty.... but I think that amaya should at least WARN that the HTML is incorrect if it does not plan to handle the bad HTML! Also: in the link that I mentioned (below: layer2.shtml), an /a tag is missing.  </s>
<s> Amaya does not complain about this, but instead tries to put everything inside the a tag.  </s>
<s> However, having h3 inside a is not allowed, so amaya reverses the order.  </s>
<s> The effect is that the a tag gets multiplied about 5 times :) It would be nice to have some kind of warning/explanation: amaya: Warning!  </s>
<s> Did not find /a for a on line X. amaya: Fixing: Assuming that everything is inside the a tag until next a tag on line Y amaya: Warning!  </s>
<s> h3 cannot be inside a amaya: Fixing: Moving a copy of a inside h3 amaya: Warning!  </s>
<s> p cannot be inside a amaya: Fixing: Moving a copy of a inside p amaya: last 2 messages repeated 4 times I don't know that all the warnings are necessary, but amaya probably should at least say that the /a tag is missing before mutilating the document (because this time it guessed wrong: it was only a typing error).  </s>
<s> Thanks, -BenRI  </s>
