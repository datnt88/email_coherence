Hi, I've now installed amaya 1.2 LINUX-ELF on my system (glibc 2.06, PPro running kernel 2.1.85), and I like it much better than the previous version :) The layout (e.g. with tables) seems to be much improved. 
However, I still found some bugs. 
Here are a few: 
Scrolling still doesn't work well. 
The horizontal scroll bar doesn't work. 
Also, if I am near the top of the page, and I go up one page, amaya will sometimes go beyond the top of the page. 
example, look at "http://sdcc13.ucsd.edu/~bredelin/Essays/layer2.shtml". 
This looks strange, and you will see why if you use the structure view. 
Amaya has made LOTS of a name elements, instead of the original ONE in the source code. 
In this example, amaya draw two lists on top of each other: --------------temp.shtml--------------------- 
I'm not sure, but its completely socially constructed. 
Futhermore this word represents a concept, and so illustrates the fact that everything we say is just one way of looking at things. 
However, this way of looking at concepts is not just one way among many, but is the only way for all non-arrogant people. 
Since all answers are equally correct (being socially constructed), we asked an informant from the idyllic !Kung tribe. 
However, we forgot the interpreter, so we "constructed" the following answer: Once upon a time a man went to the store. 
At the store he bought a large watermelon. 
The vodka is strong but the meat is rotten. 
--------------------------end temp.shtml-------------------- 
Lastly, along with the scrolling problems, amaya also sometimes redraws things incorrectly, or fails to redraw images when amaya is brought out from under another window. 
Unfortunately, this is hard to reproduce... regards, -BenRI 
Thanks for your comments. 
Horizontal scrolling is considered as an extension for a future release. 
closed by a /a tag. 
Amaya considers that the anchor applies to all following elements until it encounters another a tag that is properly closed. 
Another problem with anchors in the documents you mention is that they often appear in an invalid context. 
The HTML 4.0 DTD (http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/sgml/dtd.html), as well as previous HTML DTDs, state that anchors are inline elements: they can only appear in block elements such as paragraphs, headings, list items, etc. 
In the example below, the empty anchor named "how" should be placed within the H3 element, not between that element and the previous UL. 
When properly placed, an empty anchor works correctly in Amaya. 
To avoid any trouble, you may consider validating your pages. 
See for instance http://validator.w3.org/

Thanks for your answers. 
However, I still have some problems with the way amaya handles incorrect HTML. 
I do not know how difficult it is to handle mistakes in HTML, but I like the fact that amaya usually complains about them, and I hope it is possible to make amaya even "smarter." 
Bug: Amaya draws the sample document (bottom of this message) incorrectly. 
The second list is drawn on top of the first! 
To fix this problem, all I have to do is add a space after the /a , which seems rather broken. 
Anyway, it is possible that the a element should be inside the h3 and should not be empty.... but I think that amaya should at least WARN that the HTML is incorrect if it does not plan to handle the bad HTML! Also: in the link that I mentioned (below: layer2.shtml), an /a tag is missing. 
Amaya does not complain about this, but instead tries to put everything inside the a tag. 
However, having h3 inside a is not allowed, so amaya reverses the order. 
The effect is that the a tag gets multiplied about 5 times :) It would be nice to have some kind of warning/explanation: amaya: Warning! 
Did not find /a for a on line X. amaya: Fixing: Assuming that everything is inside the a tag until next a tag on line Y amaya: Warning! 
h3 cannot be inside a amaya: Fixing: Moving a copy of a inside h3 amaya: Warning! 
p cannot be inside a amaya: Fixing: Moving a copy of a inside p amaya: last 2 messages repeated 4 times I don't know that all the warnings are necessary, but amaya probably should at least say that the /a tag is missing before mutilating the document (because this time it guessed wrong: it was only a typing error). 
Thanks, -BenRI
