<s> Dave, does the acceptance by the HTML-WG of ALT on IMG required mean that the IMG won't display unless there is the ALT="text" attribute?  </s>
<s> Is Netscape and Microsoft part of the discussion yet?  </s>
<s> Does it also include other instances of SRC= and "image" like form ... input type="image" src=foo.gif object ?  </s>
<s> If these are yes, now we're doing accessibility!  </s>
<s> Netscape and Microsoft were included in the decision to make ALT on IMG and AREA required.  </s>
<s> But this doesn't require them to not display IMG if Alt is missing.  </s>
<s> In general, W3C so far as avoided normative definitions for error handling in HTML.  </s>

<s> Spekaing of ALT #require  </s>
<s> Does it also include other instances of SRC= and "image" like form ... input type="image" src=foo.gif object ?  </s>
<s> One thing that's worth mentioning is that in the case of INPUT, the fact that it's an INPUT image is determined using the type attribute (=image), and SGML doesn't allow another attribute (like ALT) to be #required in a context dependent way.  </s>
<s> Also note that since the ALT text is conveyed using regular markup content in OBJECT , attribute dependent semantics as well, the HTML4 specs cannot make it required.  </s>
<s> Does it also include other instances of SRC= and "image" like form ... input type="image" src=foo.gif object ?  </s>
<s> No its only required for IMG and AREA.  </s>
<s> This was resolved in a recent HTML-WG phone conference.  </s>
