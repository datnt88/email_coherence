Dave, does the acceptance by the HTML-WG of ALT on IMG required mean that the IMG won't display unless there is the ALT="text" attribute? 
Is Netscape and Microsoft part of the discussion yet? 
Does it also include other instances of SRC= and "image" like form ... input type="image" src=foo.gif object ? 
If these are yes, now we're doing accessibility! 
Netscape and Microsoft were included in the decision to make ALT on IMG and AREA required. 
But this doesn't require them to not display IMG if Alt is missing. 
In general, W3C so far as avoided normative definitions for error handling in HTML.

Spekaing of ALT #require 
Does it also include other instances of SRC= and "image" like form ... input type="image" src=foo.gif object ? 
One thing that's worth mentioning is that in the case of INPUT, the fact that it's an INPUT image is determined using the type attribute (=image), and SGML doesn't allow another attribute (like ALT) to be #required in a context dependent way. 
Also note that since the ALT text is conveyed using regular markup content in OBJECT , attribute dependent semantics as well, the HTML4 specs cannot make it required. 
Does it also include other instances of SRC= and "image" like form ... input type="image" src=foo.gif object ? 
No its only required for IMG and AREA. 
This was resolved in a recent HTML-WG phone conference.
