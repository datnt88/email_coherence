<s> I have tried my best to keep this whole discussion as close as possible to specifically XML-related issues.  </s>
<s> I want to stress that I am *not*  </s>
<s> proposing any kind of general support for LINK (not even just implicit  </s>
<s> link, or even a restricted subset of it) for XML 1.0.  </s>
<s> All I am talking about at this stage is use of the syntax as a way of achieving the goal of associating XML-specific processing semantics with the document structure.  </s>
<s> As I said in my reply to Paul Prescod, I may have bent the stick a little too far with my use of the word "processing" (although I have in many cases tried to qualify it with expressions like "processing- related").  </s>
<s> In particular, calling the stuff in the LPD a processing *specification* may be misleading.  </s>
<s> The specification of the processing is DSSSL's domain (unless it is built into the [XML] application itself).  </s>
<s> It is the *association* of the processing (specification) with the document structure that is LINK's domain.  </s>
<s> In other words, the LPD provides the link (or "bridges the gap") between the structure and the processing.  </s>
<s> Because the information being supplied (e.g. "my xref is an XML tlink") is very much oriented towards a particular form of processing, it should not be in the DTD.  </s>
<s> Nor should it be in the *document instance* (for reasons I think we all agree on).  </s>
<s> The fact that the LINKTYPE declaration is formally part of the document entity does not worry me unduly.  </s>
<s> (If I understood Joe English correctly, he saw it as the "fatal flaw".) The separation between the DTD, the LPD  </s>
<s> and the instance is so clear that I do not regard this as "mixing processing and markup".  </s>
<s> (And in fact you don't even have to put the LPD physically in the document if you use SP-based tools.)  </s>
<s> In any case, it beats me how anyone can claim that this is the case -- and then turn around and suggest putting fixed attributes in the DTD!  </s>
<s> Or is the DTD not part of the document?  </s>
<s> (Don't answer that: We all know it is.)  </s>
<s> In summary: LINK and DSSSL do not compete, they complement one another (which explains why James implemented both).  </s>
<s> David's final argument is that LINK is so underspecified that there is no guarantee of compatibility between two implementations:  </s>
<s> At any rate, the result is not required to be _anything in particular_ -- certainly not the annotation of the ESIS (or whatever the application sees) with new attribute values not declared in the document.  </s>
<s> In other words conforming LINK implementations according to 8879 are _not_ required to look at, or even have access to, link attributes.  </s>
<s> This could create a compatibility problem even between the 3 applications that have implemented LINK.  </s>
<s> This just isn't true.  </s>
<s> Attribute information for the link attributes is very much part of ESIS (see for example page 590 in the handbook).  </s>
<s> It is certainly no less clearly defined than the rest of ESIS and it is very clearly defined in the grove.  </s>
<s> A parser that supports the LINK feature is *required* to inform an application about link attributes.  </s>
<s> (Of course, what the application then *does* with that information is up to the application -- as always in SGML.)  </s>
<s> And at this point, I think we have pretty much exhausted the arguments.  </s>
<s> I have no intention of repeating myself, so this looks like a good place to take time out.  </s>
<s> If and when new arguments turn up I will be back.  </s>
<s> At the latest, expect a return to the LINKTYPE proposal when the time comes to decide how to point at style sheets :-)  </s>

<s> Fine. Murray was, so I have had to answer that (even more disturbing) prospect.  </s>
<s> In answering your arguments, I have stuck to the core issues: attribute namespace.  </s>
<s> As far as processing semantics you declare your intention to advocate the use of LINK for stylesheets, so I guess that my arguemnts, contra your statements, are really not out of bounds.  </s>
<s> Well, I for one, believe that no _mandatory_ association of processing specifications should be part of the _XML language_.  </s>
<s> Terry Allen and Len Bullard has presented good cases that in some situations XML software should be able to force such an association.  </s>
<s> I'm not in agreement with them about the scope with which these things should be applied, but that's not germane here.  </s>
<s> I do feel that instances that contain processing specifications are bad.  </s>
<s> This is in some sense a "religious" belief, but it is supported by a philosophy af document markup and document application design that is fundamental to the intended applications of SGML.  </s>
<s> I am a simple man.  </s>
<s> The fact that the document subset (and LINK subset) appear in the same entity is what bothers me.  </s>
<s> The formal distinction that declares the document instance to be only part of that entity does not impress me -- ordinary folk will not make it.  </s>
<s> Well, I'm glad that you're easy in your mind, but the argument that new users of XML will see the distinction of Document instance from document entity so clearly seems optimistic...  </s>
<s> yes, funny that SP should have chosen to be non-conformant in that way.  </s>
<s> Wihtout asking I would suspect that James is bothered by the same thing I am, to the extent that he's willing to ignore the standard in his implementation.  </s>
<s> I agree, and I think that the need to put hypertext link info in documents imposes strict restrictions on our hypertext markup -- that it not include any rendering or processing aspects, but only pure connectivity and type information.  </s>
<s> You can read about 60K of spew on that topic between me an Len B. on the back issues of this list.  </s>
<s> I won't revisit that either.  </s>
<s> Hypertext linkage should be subject to the same forms of abstraction that document content is, and for the same reasons -- reuse, genericity, and management.  </s>
<s> Last I heard, MARK-IT used significant comments in LINK delcarations to invoke a scripting language.  </s>
<s> Maybe it does something different now?  </s>
<s> ESIS is non-normative text.  </s>
<s> It is the only place where you can find a description of what _might_ be done with link attributes, so it is useful.  </s>
<s> Is there any parser other than SP that actually processes LINK in this way?  </s>
<s> I'm sorry I forgot the ESIS hook.  </s>
<s> I think I will stay out of that one.  </s>

<s> I did say I'd said my last for the time being, but I have to clear up an error I made (I think):  </s>

<s> I may have been half-remembering something else (that the "-A archname" option automatically activates any LPD of the same name).  </s>
<s> But it would be a nice feature to have -- and calling it "non-conformant" is a bit silly: All that would be happening would be the on-the-fly creation of a virtual document.  </s>
<s> Nothing in the standard that prohibits that.  </s>

<s> While MARK-IT provided a mechanism for attaching scripts to both IMPLICIT and SIMPLE links it also allows IMPLICIT links of the type proposed by Steve Pepper to be run in pure SGML mode.  </s>
<s> However, as it is SGML conformant, it will not allow you to use the barstadized form suggested by Steve for XML (which, incidentally, will never be approved by WG8 as an extension to SGML while I am on the committee as it is application specific!)  </s>

<s> Martin! I thought you knew me better than to think I would propose an application specific extension to SGML!  </s>
<s> My thought was that it might serve to enhance the LINK feature generally if the syntax allowed some defaulting.  </s>
<s> Specifically (and this is off the top of my head, so please make allowance for that): [8879:1986] !PROCSPEC xml-proc tei.2 #IMPLIED [ !ATTLIST xref xml-link CDATA #fixed "xml-tlink" ] [amended] !PROCSPEC xml-proc [ !ATTLIST xref xml-link CDATA #fixed "xml-tlink" ] NOTES: !PROCSPEC xml-proc tei.2 #IMPLIED [ [8879:1986] !PROCSPEC xml-proc [ [amended] - defaults to the active document type and implicit link !PROCDEF #INITIAL xref [8879:1986] (omitted) [amended] - default (when no named #INITIAL link set) is that the implied initial link set consists of link rules which use the default values of all attributes declared in the LPD.  </s>

<s> Only a hack as you described it.  </s>
<s> But what SP does (I'm fairly sure--I haven't actually used SP, but I know James) is not to slip a LINKTYPE declaration into a pre-existing document entity; rather it creates the document entity out of more than one pre-existing file.  </s>
<s> Which is the job of the entity manager, and doesn't violate SGML principles or rules.  </s>
