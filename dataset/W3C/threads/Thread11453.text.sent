Hello translators, I've started the translation of XHTML Basic 1.0 into Russian. 
A few questions to begin with: 1. Take a look at the following fragment: becomes Do I have to indicate the xml:lang of the latest acronym as "en" (The html xml:lang attribute is "ru")? 
Is it correct to translate the title without the acronym itself? 
Other examples include various acronyms and abbreviations like "W3C", "PDF", "Co.", "Inc.", "Ltd.", "DTD", "WAP", "WML", "SGML" etc. 2. Is there a way for me to get the right pronunciation for the names in the Acknowledgements and References sections? 
3. I translate the first appearance of a person's name in the text, for example: Mark Beiker (Mark Baker), Deiv Reggitt (Dave Raggett) etc. 
Is it necessary that I indicate the language of a name like that Mark Beiker ( span xml:lang="en" Mark Baker /span ) This may result in additional difficulties... 4. Do I have the right to translate the comments in the Appendix B, i. e. 
SGML Open Catalog Entry for XHTML Basic, XHTML Basic Driver, and XHTML Basic Customizations? 
I mean the preformatted text. 
I'm waiting forward to hearing from you! 
Happy translating.

I think you should use a similar solution here as you use for names (3. below). 
For example acronym xml:lang='en' title="Extensible HyperText Markup Language" XHTML /acronym (Rashiryayemiy yazik razmetky giperteksta) or XHTML (Rashiryayemiy yazik razmetky giperteksta) (and maybe add the text only the first time, but some WAI experts may know better). 
(Well, for my name, please use 'Martin Dyurst' for transliteration.) Yes, I think this would be the right way to do it. 
It is definitely more work. 
But I don't see anything particularly difficult/complicated. 
Did I miss anything? 
I think you can translate the comments. 
It should help the readers understand what's going on. 
But I gess you should add a remark at the start of each piece (catalog, driver,...) saying that you translated the comments, and suggesting that for production, the version in the original is used. 
Regards, Martin. 
Hello translators, First of all, may I ask you to help me to translate "content model" and "content elements"? 
XHTML /acronym (Rashiryayemiy yazik razmetky giperteksta) Okay, I'm forward this piece to w3c-wai-gl@w3.org. 
Thank you, Martin. 
It wasn't difficult to figure out how to pronounce your name, but there are a lot of others. 
I knew you would say that. 
In this case every appearance of XHTML Basic is to be enclosed in span xml:lang="en" too. 
You did, Martin. 
I'm not afraid of having a lot to do. 
I'm afraid I won't find the languages the names are written in. 
Some examples: Takuya Asada, Tantek Celik, Herman Elenbaas, Ann Navarro, Markku Vartiainen and others. 
I can guess their names origin but that'd be only a guess. 
In general it would be a good idea (for those writing the specs) to indicate a name's language using span with xml:lang on it. 
Do you mean content/sofware developing? 
Sounds logical. 
Thank you. 
Happy translating.

http://croll.da.ru/ Hello Martin, Hello Alexander, just to swim against the tide. 
I never translate people?s names, not because I?m afraid of the work to find all languages for the xml:lang, but I think it is simply not necessary. 
I haven?t met any English speaker who pronounced for example my name the right way. 
That is not a matter of phonetic transcription, that?s a matter of that he is not a native German speaker, but that is not really a matter. 
;-) I think it?s more important to recognize a name at once in other documents. 
To stay by your example: If you see the name Deiv Reggitt in a translation and look into another document (news, Rec, whatever) where the name is in it?s original form, do you recognize it at once? 
If you like to tell people, how to pronounce it, why not go the way: span xml:lang="en" Mark Baker /span (pronounced: Mark Beiker) . 
So that you ever give your reader the original name. 
Not necessarily. 
Agree.

Hello translators, Stefan, Ordnung muss sein, Stefan. 
For this purpose the following is done by the respectable Russian newspapers: the first appearance of a name is translated into Russian following by the English form in parenthesis. 
A hypothetical article: p Segodnia v 14:00 po moskovskomu vremeni v kongress-tzentre gostinitsi Radisson-Slavyanskay vstrechalis' dva nebezizvestnih predstavitelya konsortziuma W3C: Deiv Reggit ( span xml:lang="en" Dave Raggett /span ) i Martin Dyurst ( span xml:lang="de" Martin Duerst /span ). 
/p p Gospoda Reggit i Dyurst obsuzhdali problemi rasshireniya geografiyi W3C za schyot vostochnoy Evropi. 
/p Note that the first appearance of "Deiv Reggitt" was not translated (because it's a heading) as well as the third one (because it's not the first appearance). 
If you use this style any reader who reads the article from the very beginning will notice the original form. 
Assuming you're right what is the purpose of xml:lang attribute? 
Happy translating.

http://croll.da.ru/ Hello translators, Hello Alexander, Tell me, where do you know this sentence from? 
It?s the most popular sentence in Germany. 
;-) Ok, so if your newspapers do it this way, your readers are used to it. 
So it?s the right way for you. 
(Personly I would prefer to always read the original name of somebody and see the pronounciation once.) Our newpapers handle that a bit different. 
In this case I wouldn?t use the xml:lang, because it?s quite obvious, that XHTML Basic is an english term. 
Why explain (with xml:lang) something, that is already known. 
But that?s a point we surely can argue about hours and hours, where to use it and where not. 
In cases where you find similar terms in both languages, I would use it to explicitly distinguish between both terms. 
Or like you use it to tell your reader the english spelling. 
And maybe in several other cases. 
Happy weekend, Stefan Stefan Schumacher Oesterberg 20 0172/2718968 58553 Halver 02353/130119 Germany www.schumacher-netz.de 
For those who don't know, it means 'Order must be', or in a better translation, something like 'Things must be kept in order.' 
Well, I disagree. 
Have you ever seen a Russian name in its original? 
I think more or less the rule is, in most places: - Names in the same script are kept as is (within the limits of available accents,...) - Names in a different script are transliterated. 
In most cases, the original is not given at all, definitely not in German newspapers. 
Regards, Martin.
