I suggest we remove technique 1.1.11 - "Check A elements for valid text content" for the following 2 reasons: 1) This does not really fall under guideline 1 "Provide a text equivalent for every non-text element". 
2) It's covered by technique 13.1.1

Chris W3C Web Accessibility Initiative http://www.w3.org/WAI Location: I-cubed, 110 Victoria Street, Carlton VIC 3053 Postal: GPO Box 2476V, Melbourne 3001, Australia Makes sense to me to not check A elements for valid text, given that an image with ALT text would be acceptable. 
However, we would need then to perform the validation on the image's ALT text that we might otherwise perform on textual content of an A element, like forbidding "Click here". 
As you say, that's covered under 13.1.1 
but we'd need to be sure it's stated that it includes validating ALT text, or any other form of textual equivalent inside an A element.
