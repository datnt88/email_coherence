It seems that I just ran into a problem with Web Folders and wondered if anybody else has seen this. 
Or if my assumptions are mistaken :-) I set a property on a file like so: There is no default namespace defined. 
When I select "Properties" in a Web Folder, it pops up an error dialog saying "Unable to display properties." 
I've narrowed it down to exactly this property. 
Just setting this one single property on a file will do it. 
Has anybody else seen this? 
Or duplicate it? 
The User-Agent is "Microsoft Data Access Internet Publishing Provider DAV 1.1" Cheers, -g Greg Stein, http://www.lyra.org/ 
I never got them working as well... Nor visualisation of extending props, nor setting of standard props like attribs... 
The Webfolder does simply not show them. 
So if anyone has a working sample for a PROPFIND with depth 0 please send it in... But I even tried this with an IIS and the setting of props was not supported ether... Henrik If you are doing this with mod_dav, you might be hitting the bug (in mod_dav) I have reported recently: Do you have a trace to verify? 
Totally unrelated to that. 
Sheesh. 
And I left out the most important part. 
The setting of xml:lang is what blows it up.

Indeed. 
I can reproduce your problem with IE6 + Sharepoint Client. 
It seems that the webfolder client gets the namespace Uri and fails to foresee the case that it may be null. 
What's interesting is that the client is asking for all properties, although it will only display a hardwired set.
