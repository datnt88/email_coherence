<s> Hi, Here is a proposed mission statement for our working group.  </s>
<s> This is intended as a device to initiate discussion within the group.  </s>
<s> Our mission statement is the first step toward our CSF analysis.  </s>
<s> Please keep in mind that this statement is subject to change based on your input - it is by no means final or even close to what we will end up with.  </s>
<s> It's only Daniel's $0.02.  </s>
<s> Let's start this conversation by looking at your Charter [1].  </s>
<s> The most relevant text I could find was this: The Web Services Choreography Working Group...is chartered to create the definition of a choreography, language(s) for describing a choreography, as well as the rules for composition of, and interaction among, such choreographed Web services.  </s>
<s> At first blush, we might think that this is a good candidate for a mission statement.  </s>
<s> Modify the working a little and go...right?  </s>
<s> Unfortunately, I don't think so, for these three reasons: a) The text above makes a serious mistake in its direction to the group.  </s>
<s> The problem is what I call "presupposing the solution" and it's very common.  </s>
<s> Instead of posing a problem to be solved and saying "go forth and solve this problem" the text doesn't bother to explain the problem in any detail, but it tells us what the solution is already!  </s>
<s> This artifact- and deliverable-centric approach isn't likely to produce a good solution.  </s>
<s> b) It's begging the question - do we really need Yet Another Markup Language (YAML)?  </s>
<s> Sez who?  </s>
<s> To do what?  </s>
<s> What is the problem we want YAML to solve?  </s>
<s> The world doesn't necessarily need YAML; it needs a solution to the choreography problem, and while that may or may not result in YAML, we don't need to constrain ourselves by thinking about the problem in these terms.  </s>
<s> Not yet anyhow.  </s>
<s> c) It's circular - apparently we need a choreography language to choreograph Web Services.  </s>
<s> The logic isn't exactly clear.  </s>
<s> Based on this thinking, I decided that I'd like our mission statement for this group to have the following features: 1) It must clearly set forth the problem to be solved, including an indication of the overall scope of the problem.  </s>
<s> 2) It must not presuppose any solution in advance of the problem analysis.  </s>
<s> 3) It must be clear and in the imperative case, so that a reader can easily tell if the problem they have falls under our area of effort.  </s>
<s> 4) It must be contextually-driven, taking into account the current state of affairs as we know it.  </s>
<s> When the charter was originally written, we didn't know about the OASIS fiasco, for example, and our mission certainly has to take these things into account if we intend to accomplish our goals.  </s>
<s> 5) It has to be reasonable - the problem to be solved has to be scoped in a way that allows us to actually have a fighting chance of success.  </s>
<s> Let's ask ourselves "What problem is it that we are trying to solve?"  </s>
<s> If I had to put it simply, I would say that we want to solve the problem of interoperability among Web Services and other systems.  </s>
<s> We want all our Web Services to come home with report cards that say "plays well with others".  </s>
<s> That's it.  </s>
<s> But that's a huge issue...and we cannot (and aren't charged with) solving the whole problem, just a part of it.  </s>
<s> Which part?  </s>
<s> The part that concerns interactions between one or more Web Services and any external systems.  </s>
<s> More specifically, we are concerned with the rules and constraints that a Web Service has to follow in order to interoperate reliably with the rest of the world.  </s>
<s> We can exclude the definitions of the interface of any given Web Service - WSDL group is doing that.  </s>
<s> We can also exclude questions of underlying low-level protocols, because we want to leave this deliberately unspecified.  </s>
<s> The content and packaging of Web Services messages are largely being handled by the SOAP WG.  </s>
<s> That leaves us with a set of constraints on the sequencing (the ordering of events in time) and composition (the patterns of message and response among one or more Web Services and one or more external systems, which may or may not be other Web Services, human beings, non-Web Service services, or something else altogether.  </s>
<s> So...after saying that, here is what I've come up with.  </s>
<s> YMMV.  </s>
<s> The mission of the Web Services Choreography Working Group at W3C is to specify the means by which Web Services may collaborate with external systems, specifically in the composition of multiple services and the sequencing of messages among them.  </s>

<s> So if anyone has an opinion for or against WSDL, can you please clarify whether you refer to the WSDL services, WSDL interfaces or WSDL whole.  </s>
<s> I think that alone would bring a bit more agreement into the discussion.  </s>

<s> IMHO, the main limitation of the upper part of WSDL is the lack of definition of service type.  </s>
<s> Without this definition it is merely an IDL, IMO.  </s>
<s> Based upon the WSD WG meeting currently ongoing (guess where I am? :-), I think it is reasonable to assume that this will be added to WSDL.  </s>
