<s> I've created a (very) rough draft of the techniques for guideline 3.1 (navigable) and posted it at: This is really just the techniques from the AERT that seem to fit the new 3.1 guideline.  </s>
<s> These techniques are referenced by title but in the final document they would be filled out as in the AERT.  </s>
<s> I've placed the techniques under the 3 categories of minimum, level 2 and level 3 as I thought they fit.  </s>
<s> Before going any further I thought I should see if I'm on the right track.  </s>
<s> What's right or wrong with this document?  </s>

<s> My apologies, I'd like to join this call, but am unavailable between 15:00 and 16:00 GMT Jonathan Chetwynd  </s>
<s> Chris,  </s>
<s> Thanks.  </s>
<s> This raises some good questions and issues.  </s>
<s> 1. We need to figure out how to combine AERT with the current HTML Techniques draft [1].  </s>
<s> Or will we have two documents?  </s>
<s> Also, keep in mind the relation to ATAG and ATAG Techniques [2].  </s>
<s> 2. How will we handle overlap of techniques?  </s>
<s> For example, you have technique 3.5.1  </s>
<s> "Check document for header nesting" associated with checkpoint 3.1, but these might also be relevant to checkpoint 1.3 "Make all content and structure available independently of presentation."  </s>
<s> 3. I'm curious how you sorted the techniques into Levels.  </s>
<s> There are some WCAG 1.0 priority 1 techniques in Level 2, Minimum Level are primarily WCAG  </s>
<s> 1.0 priority 2. If this sorting is correct, then people who conform to WCAG 1.0 will be a bit confused when they move to WCAG 2.0.  </s>
<s> (the next two questions are from your document)  </s>
<s> 4. What is a major section and what is a long document?  </s>
<s> 5. Can valid long documents be devoid of paragraphs?  </s>
<s> This might relate to the applicability axis we talked about at last Thursday's telecon.  </s>

<s> Wendy,  </s>
<s> Are our accessibility techniques based upon the WCAG2 document or its techniques document?  </s>
<s> The techniques document seems more precise than the WCAG2 so it would be easier to base our accessibility checking on it.  </s>
<s> But does the techniques document cover everything that could be related to accessibility?  </s>
<s> A quick look over shows that it covers accessibility issues quite well.  </s>
<s> Yes, there will definitely be overlap.  </s>
<s> If, however, we base our accessibility techniques on the WCAG techniques then we won't have to worry about overlap.  </s>
<s> It seems to me that the WCAG techniques are HTML element oriented like the AERT.  </s>
<s> WCAG  </s>
<s> The guideline for minimum level deals with titles and paragraphs so I placed all the techniques dealing with titles and paragraphs under it.  </s>
<s> Reviewing my initial sorting has shown up some errors.  </s>
<s> Yes, it could be confusing to people migrating from 1.0 to 2.0 if we're not consistent.  </s>
<s> Perhaps that should be a contributing factor to where we place the techniques.  </s>
<s> The WCAG2 Techniques document talks about "long documents" and "sections" without defining them.  </s>
<s> Hmmm, how precise do we need to be?  </s>

<s> track.  </s>
<s> Inevitably, authors will have to make those determinations themselves.  </s>
<s> You can't shove a formula down people's throats: "If your document exceeds x kilobytes of text, it is considered a long document."  </s>
<s> Heavens, yes.  </s>
<s> Images, anyone?  </s>
<s> Flash?  </s>
<s> Ever watched a movie trailer?  </s>
<s> I listen to John Peel's BBC Radio 1 show for six hours a week.  </s>
<s> Those are pretty long documents, don't you think?  </s>
<s> And not a p /p element anywhere.  </s>
<s> I appeal to WAI to free itself from its ongoing bias that the only true Web documents are those jammed to the margins with words words words.  </s>
