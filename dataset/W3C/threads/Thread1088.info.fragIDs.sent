I've a case where I'd like to use tidy to check files marked up with a blend of ColdFusion and HTML. 
ColdFusion is a preprocessor type application server language (think PHP, ASP, etc.). 
Right now, I have the following in a tidy config file: new-inline-tags: CFABORT, CFAPPLET, CFAPPLICATION, CFASSOCIATE, CFAUTHENTICATE, CFBREAK, CFCACHE, CFCOL, CFCOLLECTION, CFCONTENT, CFCOOKIE, CFDIRECTORY, CFELSE, CFELSEIF, CFERROR, CFEXIT, CFFILE, CFFTP, CFGRIDCOLUMN, CFGRIDROW, CFGRIDUPDATE, CFHEADER, CFHTMLHEAD, CFHTTPPARAM, CFINCLUDE, CFINDEX, CFINPUT, CFINSERT, CFLDAP, CFLOCATION, CFMAIL, CFMODULE, CFOBJECT, CFPARAM, CFPOP, CFPROCPARAM, CFPROCRESULT, CFREGISTRY, CFSCHEDULE, CFSEARCH, CFSET, CFSETTING, CFSLIDER, CFSTOREDPROC, CFTEXTINPUT, CFTHROW, CFTREEITEM, CFUPDATE, CFWDDX new-blocklevel-tags: CFFORM, CFGRID, CFHTTP, CFIF, CFLOCK, CFLOOP, CFOUTPUT, CFQUERY, CFREPORT, CFSCRIPT, CFSELECT, CFSWITCH, CFCASE, CFDEFAULTCASE, CFTABLE, CFTRANSACTION, CFTREE, CFTRY, CFCATCH However, 
HTML Tidy for Solaris (vers 1st June 2002; built on Jun 11 2002, at 06:28:18) is generating this type of error: line 1 column 1 - Warning: cftry is not approved by W3C line 6 column 1 - Warning: cfif unexpected or duplicate quote mark line 8 column 1 - Warning: missing /cfsetting before /cfif 
etc. Does anyone have any ideas on how to get tidy and ColdFusion pages to work better together?

You can't get rid of those warnings. 
Declaring the extra tags changes them from error (which causes tags to be deleted, even with --force-output yes) to a simple warning. 
In large part, because Tidy now knows how to treat the tag. 
How does your output markup look? 
take it easy, Charlie 
I'm trying to use tidy, not as a beautifier, but as an error detector. 
And as an error detector, the output generated still mixes info about the CF tags with the real errors/warnings (and in fact, I have concerns that real warnings are masked because of the CF warnings). 
Tidy is the tool that CF developers on Linux/Solaris/HP-UX are often told to use for doing syntax checking - I had assumed that I was just missing some sort of options to actually be able to do this.

Could you please provide a sample document?
