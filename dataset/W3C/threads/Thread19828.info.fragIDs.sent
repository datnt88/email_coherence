<s> Some basic questions I haven't found answers to yet... they don't appear to be addressed in the developer writeups, or in the archives.  </s>
<s> (BTW, it would be nice to have a search capability on the text of the archives).  </s>
<s> - Is an API available that would enable one to capture and manipulate all HTTP outgoing requests and incoming replies?  </s>
<s> If so, can this be done in Java as well as C?  </s>
<s> - I've seen that the UI of Amaya can be changed by altering config files, but can I alter the UI on the fly or only at start-up?  </s>
<s> - Does Amaya support standard NS/IE plug-ins?  </s>
<s> If not, does it support any kind of plug-in concept?  </s>
<s> - Has anyone embedded an ORB in Amaya?  </s>
<s> In NS, ORBs can only be embedded in applets, not plugins...  </s>

<s> If you use amaya-java version.  </s>
<s> I'm not sure that there is an HTTP API.  </s>
<s> Please contact Yves.Lafon@w3.org  </s>
<s> for that (He is the person in charge of Java HTTP classes used in Amaya).  </s>
<s> But, I know that an API is available to manipulate HTML documents.  </s>
<s> Only at start-up in C version.  </s>
<s> In amaya-java version, it'd be possible to change UI on the fly.  </s>
<s> Yes, but only on Unix platforms (including Linux) at the moment.  </s>
<s> I don't think.  </s>
<s> Regards Irene.  </s>
<s> Sorry, I was away from the office and from my mail for a few days, I hope this answer doesn't come too late.  </s>
<s> Considering the set of question in your initial mail, I would suggest that you have a look at Amaya-Java.  </s>
<s> This is an experimental version of Amaya embedding the Kaffe Java JIT run-time.  </s>
<s> This allow to extend Amaya with Java code.  </s>
<s> This code has access to the Thot internal API used by Amaya and also to the HTTP implementation.  </s>
<s> Amaya-Java uses the client HTTP classes developed for Jigsaw (entierely written in Java) instead of LibWWW for HTTP accesses.  </s>
<s> Hence it is very easy to modify trap the HTTP requests and replies issued from Amaya and to handle them in a specific way.  </s>
<s> This was done for example to build a version of Amaya implementing PICS filtering.  </s>
<s> However, Amaya-Java currently lacks portability, this is mainly due to problem using Kaffe on platforms different than Linux.  </s>
<s> Also Amaya-Java gets a lot less testing than the standard Amaya version.  </s>
<s> There is some provision in the Amaya-Java code to modify some of the Amaya interface dynamically at run-time, however this is largely untested.  </s>
<s> Amaya distribution embed code to support Netscape plugins (this is not by default, you need to recompile your own version).  </s>
<s> The Amaya-Java distribution can be compiled to use ILU, both for HTTP accesses and to export it's internal APIs.  </s>
<s> It is possible to compile Amaya-Java with both ILU and Java, in this case it will use the HTTP stack from Jigsaw, but will still exports it's own APIs from ILU.  </s>
<s> No attempt has been done yet to give full access to ILU core from Amaya.  </s>
<s> But it could certainly be done.  </s>
<s> It's mainly a question of time and priorities, I am the only one supporting Amaya-Java and it's not my main project, I only devote 10 percent of my working schedule to it.  </s>
