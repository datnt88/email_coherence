<s> Hi, I am a final year student in the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore doing my Masters.  </s>
<s> I am new to this mailing-list and also a new user of Amaya.  </s>
<s> Can I get to know the exact subset of MathML elements and entities supported by Amaya ?  </s>
<s> I am not able to view entities like "&amp;ll" and also MathML elements like mtd .  </s>

<s> Hi, Tthe exact subset of MathML elements and entities supported by Amaya is described in the Math.html page (see help command): Amaya doesn't implement the Content Markup, but only the Presentation Markup.  </s>
<s> The mtd element is supported, it's part of the matrix.  </s>
<s> Some entities can be missing, but I don't know the entity "&amp;ll".  </s>
<s> Regards Irene.  </s>
<s> I am not sure if I the problem is in my build but I have noticed the following : a) In a form you can't use the tab to go to the next text input field.  </s>
<s> b) A password field shows the text which is being typed in.  </s>
<s> Did I do something wrong?  </s>
<s> S.B.  </s>
<s> I don't think this is wrong, I experience the same behavoure.  </s>
<s> I think this is because Amaya is an editor with limited brouwser capabilities.  </s>
<s> It is not a brouwser with edit capabilities.  </s>
<s> You think you are filling out the form but you are not, you are editing the file!  </s>
<s> - Fill out the form and save the file to a local file.  </s>
<s> Open it with an ascii editor and see.  </s>
<s> - Have a look at the structure while you are typing.  </s>
<s> It might be a good idea to be able to switch amaya to brouwse/test/read-only mode so you can test your forms or browse with it.  </s>

<s> The entity ll is listed in the REC-MathML/chap6/MMALIAS2.html as the double-less-than sign with Unicode 226A.  </s>
<s> Also when I am using "&amp;Newline" inside MTEXT amaya is giving error: invalid entity "&amp;Ne".  </s>

<s> True this is not implemented yet.  </s>
<s> No, it's a bug in password field management.  </s>
<s> We're working on it.  </s>
<s> Regards Irene.  </s>
