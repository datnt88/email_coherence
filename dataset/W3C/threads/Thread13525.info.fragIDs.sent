<s> Um... WTF is EARL, OK?  </s>
<s> It's a language for making statements about the accessibility of something, in a standard machine-readable (and human-displayable) way.  </s>
<s> For example: * I could run a program like Bobby or the W3C validator, and get back a report in EARL which records those things Bobby or the validator can measure.  </s>
<s> * I could sit down and test a site, and record my results in a format that gets changed into EARL (maybe by a script prompting me for answers).  </s>
<s> * I could use a nifty new editor which, on demand, generates an EARL statement about the code it is creating for me.  </s>
<s> * I could then combine all of the above EARL statements into a composite and see how the site measures up against various W3C specifications, such as WCAG or XHTML.  </s>
<s> Failures to comply could also be noted in EARL as well.  </s>
<s> EARL is "just" a common language and syntax for expressing things that we current talk about in English, such as "this page is single-A accessible and it includes D-links" or "this fails checkpoint 2.1" or "alt text exists, but William Loughborough doesn't think they're adequate."  </s>
<s> (The last one is not a tongue-and-cheek joke; EARL, as I understand it, does indeed allow for value judgments and identification of who made those calls.) Kynn Bartlett kynn@reef.com  </s>
