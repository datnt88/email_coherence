<s> Hi  </s>
<s> AFAIK it has never been in any HTML spec and it was an attribute that was created by Netscape back in the days when textareas behaved in a different way from the now usual way -- now all browsers seem to have wrap=virtual by default.  </s>
<s> I'm not aware of a CSS way of achieving the same results as the wrap attribute and for this reason I think it's an attribute that would make sense to have in the transitional DTDs, but that isn't a debate worth having again :-) Chris Chris Croome chris@webarchitects.co.uk web design http://www.webarchitects.co.uk/ web content management http://mkdoc.com/  </s>

<s> It's not deprecated; it's simply never been part of W3C HTML.  </s>
<s> You can only deprecate things that have previously been part of the standard.  </s>
<s> It couldn't be introduced into XHTML as it is presentational, and therefore belongs in CSS, etc.  </s>
<s> I wonder if it's main use is in abusing text area for displaying licences.  </s>
<s> thanks again  </s>
<s> read through a few postings going back to 96 and inferred that it had been removed...  </s>

<s> No, as David explained, wrap="physical" was never part of any HTML specification.  </s>
<s> As far as I know, it was never even proposed.  </s>
<s> And actually it would work against the way textarea elements have always been intended to work: to allow input of multiple lines with no limit on line length.  </s>
<s> I'm not sure whether there are particular _accessibility_ issues involved.  </s>
<s> But there's a long explanation of the history of the wrap attribute for textarea at Jukka Korpela  </s>
