<s> (This is a proposal for a registration; I am using the template from draft-freed-charset-regist-02.txt) Charset name: SCSU Charset aliases: (none, except for the implicit csSCSU) Suitability for use in MIME text: No Published Specification: Unicode Technical Report #6 "A Standard Compression Scheme for Unicode" Note: SCSU is a Character Encoding Scheme (CES) of Unicode and ISO 10646 (of the UTF-16-reachable subset).  </s>
<s> ISO 10646 equivalency table: Same as specification.  </s>
<s> Additional Information: SCSU is a Character Encoding Scheme for Unicode/ISO 10646  </s>
<s> that allows significant size reduction of text compared to UCS Transformation formats.  </s>
<s> It approximates the size of text that is otherwise achieved with language-specific charsets while encoding all of Unicode (up to U-0010ffff).  </s>
<s> SCSU is byte-based, which helps further, traditional compression (LZW etc.).  </s>
<s> It is stateful and uses all byte values including NUL. CRLF may or may not be represented by 0x0d 0x0a depending on the encoder and the text.  </s>
<s> Encoders can be trivial by emitting one command byte (0x0f) followed by the text in UTF-16BE.  </s>
<s> Fairly simple encoders yield good results with average text of any length.  </s>
<s> Decoding is simple and requires no mapping tables.  </s>
<s> If no control characters other than NUL, TAB, CR, and LF are used, then text in US-ASCII or ISO-8859-1 is already valid SCSU text.  </s>
<s> There is a Unicode signature byte sequence defined (0e fe ff, see specification).  </s>
<s> SCSU is a good charset for application/xml, for example.  </s>

<s> Two comments only:  </s>
<s> - the "charset" SCSU is, as far as I can see, the combination of the CCS UNICODE/ISO 10646 with the CES of UTR #6.  </s>
<s> This should be expressed clearly in the "Published specification" section; as currently written, it sounds like you're registering the CES only, which is a no-no.  </s>
<s> - I would like to add under "Additional information": SCSU is completely useless for applications that require a canonical representation of text.  </s>
<s> This is an intentional part of its design.  </s>
<s> I don't like it much as a general purpose tool, but it may find a market niche somewhere.  </s>

<s> This is a good way to put it.  </s>
<s> I will update my proposal.  </s>
<s> Well, I will try to find a somewhat nicer way to say this... :-) You are right.  </s>
<s> The intention behind SCSU is not to have an encoding that is good for internal processing; the intention is to have an encoding of Unicode that is more compact than UTF-8 or UTF-16 and that is useful in files (beware of searching though) and especially in protocols.  </s>
<s> For example, the XML parser that I know always converts everything from the document charset into UTF-16 before it does anything else.  </s>
<s> It does not care about such issues.  </s>
<s> That's fair.  </s>
<s> What is the next step?  </s>
<s> Do I need to update and resend the proposal?  </s>
<s> Should I wait for a few days to give more people time to respond?  </s>
<s> markus  </s>
<s> Update and resend the proposal.  </s>
<s> Once you get around to doing that, most of the comments will be in :-) (experience says that most comments occur within the first 48 hours after a proposal is first submitted) Harald Harald Tveit Alvestrand, EDB Maxware, Norway Harald.Alvestrand@edb.maxware.no  </s>
<s> Hello Markus, No major complaints, except for:  </s>
<s> Please remove this sentence.  </s>
<s> The only charsets really good for XML are UTF-8 and UTF-16, because they are guaranteed to be understood by the XML processor.  </s>
