<s> PNG Transparency does not seem to be working.  </s>
<s> Example page is background is trandparent in Mozilla.  </s>
<s> Also, the W3C part of the W3C HTML 4.0 logo appears incorrect.  </s>
<s> It shows as having a dark blue background, but it should be red.  </s>
<s> To enter a quotation mark, I must press the quotation mark key twice.  </s>
<s> Multi-imbedded lists do not cycle marks.  </s>
<s> Testcase is at bottom of The W3C images in the Test Suites column appear to be stretched.  </s>
<s> The underlines on links at lower than the underline for the rest of the line.  </s>
<s> The alternate stylesheet is unavailable for enable/disable stylesheet lists.  </s>
<s> To enter a quotation mark, I must press the quotation mark key twice.  </s>
<s> this might be because multi-key is enabled?  </s>
<s> The underlines on links at lower than the underline for the rest of the line.  </s>
<s> Oh, cool.  </s>
<s> I hate underlined text that isn't a link, because underlining is one of the best-established presentation conventions on the web, and much more useful than guessing where there is a link, so being able to tell what is a link even when things are underlined sounds to me like a feature.  </s>
<s> Cheers Chaals  </s>
<s> GIF transparency doesn't work either.  </s>
<s> Example page: http://www.oxnardcc.org/committees/curriculum/; the condor image in the upper left corner has a transparent, not white, background, and should blend smoothly with the light blue background rather than being displayed in a whitish square.  </s>
<s> Other images on the page exhibit the same problem, although the condor makes the problem the most obvious.  </s>
<s> Compare the rendering with that of the same page in IE 5 or 6, Mozilla 0.9 or 1.0, or Opera 5 or 6.  </s>
<s> It probably works properly in Netscape 4.x, too, but I haven't tested it.  </s>
<s> Also note (at least in Win98SE) the slight misalignment of the second column of the main layout table.  </s>
<s> The blue-dot bullets are supposed to be just to the right, not the left, of the vertical blue/white boundary in the upper portions of the page.  </s>
<s> Again, comparison of the rendering with one of the browsers listed above will show the original intent.  </s>
<s> --MB  </s>
<s> It works with the GTK version and the OpenGL version.  </s>
<s> With Motif and Win32 versions with supports only a subset of PNG transparencies.  </s>
<s> As the future is to use OpenGL, we won't spend time to improve these implementations.  </s>
<s> Where?  </s>
<s> That is not under the control of Amaya.  </s>
<s> I have the same problem with other applications on the Windows platform where the problem occurs.  </s>
<s> Bug not detected by the team either on a Windows platform nor on a Unix platform.  </s>
<s> Yes the alternate stylesheet is not supported yet.  </s>
<s> I have attached a screenshot of this.  </s>
<s> It seemed to appear okay in the GL version.  </s>
<s> Only the GL version supports 255 level of aplha and blending.  </s>
<s> GTK only has one aplha level (due to imlib limitation) Motif and WIN32 (GDI) may only have one level of 'alpha' = only if the background an uniform color.  </s>
<s> As Opengl is going to be the main version, we do not plan to code alpha levels management for others version.  </s>
<s> (And we'll need any bug report on this version before making it the main version, including graphic card vendor) -Paul  </s>
<s> Yes, the handling of the alpha channel is too limited in the non-GL version.  </s>
<s> Irene.  </s>
