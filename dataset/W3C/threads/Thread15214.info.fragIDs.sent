<s> There are millions of people who have problems understanding language -written or spoken.  </s>
<s> There are many people who have worked hard the last thirty years of their life to build up a vocabulary of say 1000 words.  </s>

<s> This lexicon is available, and is short, and they manage to describe all their news broadcasts using it.  </s>
<s> We want to say: use words that more people can understand For example use words in a six year old's vocabulary not.  </s>
<s> However if this is too difficult for your site's content, then try and keep the "age" bar down as much as you can.  </s>

<s> What we agreed was that Lisa would expound on all the ideas that were chopped up into pieces in the current checkpoints, adding as much detail and background as possible, including benefits, history, profiles of the kinds of disabilities, etc..  </s>
<s> From this expansion, we could then work backwards to make a list of checkpoints, and then from there try to decide what could be core and what would have to be extended.  </s>
<s> So, Lisa, two things: First, let me apologize for blundering and using the phrase "dumbing down" when talking about reading James Joyce.  </s>
<s> I think that it was an obvious reference to my own need, and Cynthia's, for simplification of Joyce's ideas, but the moment it slipped out of my mouth, laughing as I was, it felt totally inappropriate.  </s>

<s> Hi Lisa, and others...  </s>
<s> I thought that it would be relevant to add some very rough notes / introduction in to what we are investigating for cognitive impaired users and in particular symbol users.  </s>
<s> I'm involved in the EU funded WWAAC (world wide augmentative and assistive communication) project along with Bengt Farre, Colette Nicolle and load of other people.  </s>
<s> In brief: - the are several communication vocabulary sets all of which are proprietary &amp; produced by different companies - there is currently no way of electronic interchange between users, - for example a user of the PCS vocab couldn't send a translated message to a user of a widget vocab.  </s>
<s> - what we are in the process of developing is a ConceptCodingFramework that will allow such a translation to occur.  </s>
<s> Roughly... We're building an RDF onthology of concepts (using the Voice of America and the Bliss 1500 most frequent words) - this is done via wordnet and kaon; An API that we'll then pass on to AAC vocab developers for them to export their concepts into - producing an api bridge that matches their concepts to the concepts in our onthology.  </s>
<s> So in future if someone was sending an email or browsing a webpage, they could translate that material using xpointers and rdf, query our onthology, and choose the representation they want eg.  </s>
<s> Bliss, PCS etc etc.  </s>
<s> We're planning to run a workshop this november (in Dundee, Scotland) introducing this work (now it is taking shape).  </s>
<s> The aim of the workshop is to get input and feedback on the design and implementation, and just to spread the word on this work especially to AAC manufactures.  </s>
