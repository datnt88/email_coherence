<s> hi again, We promised[1] to learn more about the people we arereaching wth our dissemination efforts, and one way to find out more is to ask website visitors about themselves.  </s>
<s> At the last face to face we decided it would be useful to have a short questionnaire for visitors, linked to information about the newsletter.  </s>
<s> We need to decide what those questions should be.  </s>
<s> Here are my suggestions, based on [1].  </s>
<s> (1) Which group are you from?  </s>
<s> Our dissemination plan is based around reaching four different (often overlapping) groups: * Internet, Web and Open Source developer communities * Academic and Research Community * Content and Tool Producers  </s>
<s> * Industry and Commerce and perhaps * other  </s>
<s> so being able to pick from those (check-box-style) would be one important question.  </s>
<s> (2) Where are you geographically based?  </s>
<s> To evaluate whether the project is too uk-centric, it would be useful to know where visitors to the site were based.  </s>
<s> Perhaps a drop-down menu would be appropriate here.  </s>
<s> (3) How did you hear of us?  </s>
<s> This might be useful for working out which are our best dissemintation efforts.  </s>
<s> Any thoughts?  </s>

<s> Being able to pick multiples is important I think, and having a box for free comment is always a good thing - whether they are otehr or not.  </s>
<s> Europe, Eastern Europe, North America, South America, Africa, Asia/Pacific?  </s>
<s> please specify country?  </s>
<s> The difficulty is that because most of the site is in english (I have a couple of things in spanish, french and italian there) it makes sense that people who speak other languages look in other places, even for stuff that comes from the project.  </s>
<s> We should ensure that we have a privacy policy for all this, and that it matches what we say on the site.  </s>
<s> cheers Chaals  </s>
<s> A little one: questions along the lines of "Are you currently using semweb tech?" "Are you planning to in the near future?"  </s>
<s> might help see whether emphasis should be on initial exposure or a step (or two) further along.  </s>
<s> yep, good idea... (we'll end up with rdf, right?) chaals  </s>
