MAP is allowed to have block content in HTML 4.0, and I am wondering wht needs to be changed to make it work in Amaya I guess that the HTML.S needs change. 
Now it has MAP as LIST Of (AREA) and that should be AREA, Block And the types menu needs to have Map as an option - but it looks like there are a few things I need to do to allow a MAP that is not associated with an image. 
(This is an accessibility requirement in particular) Any help?would 
be greatly appreciated Charles McCN --Charles McCathieNevile mailto:charles@w3.org

From what I have been able to find (in not enough time to look properly) Amaya's DTD does not allow for block content, only areas. 
When I get a spare moment again... Charles In particular what would you expect a (any) browser to do with: I suspect the answer is basically, ignore the MAP element.

I know that new MAP specification of HTML 4.0 and the new proposed updates in HTML 4.01. 
In Amaya we didn't do anything around MAPs, firstly by lack of time, secondly because we didn't have a clear idea of what we have to do. 
Extending the HTML structure to accept a BLOCKQUOTE within a MAP is not so complex. 
But there are real issues around that: - as a MAP can includes a BLOCKQUOTE, a BLOCKQUOTE can include AREAs. 
We can add the BLOCKQUOTE level and it could be displayed in the "Alternate View". 
But what we have to do with AREAs within a simple BLOCKQUOTE. 
- what Amaya has to do when the user wants to create a MAP? 
Does it have to generate the BLOCKQUOTE? 
Does it have to open the "Alternate View" to encourage the author to add text around AREAs? - if a MAP may be associated with one or more elements (IMG, OBJECT, or INPUT), its should have more than one position and the element which follows that MAP must ignore the MAP existence. 
We know how to make the MAP overlapping ONE element and to make the following element ignoring the MAP existence. 
But we don't know how to overlaps more than one element. 
We should generate copies of the MAP and its contents. 
- if the MAP is not associated to any element it has to be displayed as a BLOCKQUOTE and the element which follows that MAP mustn't ignore the MAP existence. 
It's not very easy to express in the P language that the follwing element may ignore or not the MAP position. 
For us it would be better to have a simple BLOCKQUOTE here.

Hmm. 
I think I should have answered this a while ago, but I guess better late than never... What should happen is that if there is something inside a MAP other than an AREA, it should be rendered (as usual). 
It should be possible to create a MAP element in the same way as a DIV element, and to add things inside it if one is created by defining an AREA in an image.
