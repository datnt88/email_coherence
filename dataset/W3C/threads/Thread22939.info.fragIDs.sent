<s> You'll need someone more expert than me to give you a definitive answer, but I've used the 'onchange' attribute of SELECT to indicate when a new OPTION is selected, and this _has_ to assume that SELECT has a value.  </s>

<s> SELECT has a 'control name'.  </s>
<s> (HTML4.01 17.6) "Each control has both an initial value and a current value, both of which are character strings" (HTML4.01 17.2) And SELECT may have an 'onchange' attribute which implies a value.  </s>
<s> (HTML4.01 17.6) But there's no mention of what the value represents, nor of what the initial or default values might be.  </s>
<s> However, checking in IE5 and Mozilla, the value of SELECT does indeed return a string corresponding to the value of the currently selected OPTION.  </s>
<s> Useful though it may be, I'd hesitate to regard it as definitive.  </s>
<s> Probably wouldn't be a problem if HTML4.01 had been more explicit.  </s>
