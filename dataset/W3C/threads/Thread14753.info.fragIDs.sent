<s> Agreed.  </s>
<s> This is part of a larger issue, however.  </s>
<s> Forms are only an instance of the more general concept of a user interface, so at a minimum it should read: Provide interfaces customized for different skill levels and preferences.  </s>
<s> Then the question is asked what the success criteria should be.  </s>
<s> As I don't have a clear answer, I won't try to draft any here.  </s>
<s> Instead, I shall raise several issues surrounding this proposed checkpoint which I think need to be resolved along the way.  </s>
<s> By way of background, it should be noted that (any appearances to the contrary notwithstanding) the technologies underlying the web are evolving, and indeed quite rapidly.  </s>
<s> Two examples may be briefly mentioned.  </s>
<s> First, the W3C is already becoming involved in the development of standards to support so-called "web services".  </s>
<s> The basic idea, as I understand it, is to foster application interoperability below the user interface level.  </s>
<s> As Gregg suggested at a recent teleconference, one approach would be to limit our guidelines only to web content that provides its own user interface; but, as he also recognized, this has the disadvantage that content which operates below the user interface level may not then have the necessary semantics and abstractions to support accessibility, even if the underlying markup language follows the XML accessibility guidelines and hence supports the required features.  </s>
<s> Moreover, there are checkpoints in our guidelines which need not be restricted to content that "comes with its own interface", whatever that means.  </s>
<s> Examples include most of guidelines 1 and 5; checkpoint 4.1 also applies to any content that contains text, even if it is destined to become part of a larger interface.  </s>
<s> The second trend worthy of note is the development of user interface abstractions, for example in XForms, and the growing support for constructing user interfaces customized for different device types, including audio (VoiceXML), visual (XSL formatting objects) and so forth, not to mention handheld and mobile applications.  </s>
<s> In such an environment I think our guidelines need to be very clear as to what requirements apply in different situations.  </s>
<s> Also, there are now more options available in customizing user interfaces to meet various user requirements and to adapt to the context in which the web content is being delivered.  </s>
<s> I would suggest a break-down along the following dimensions: 1.  </s>
<s> It should be made clear to a reader of the guidelines which checkpoints presuppose that the content author has a significant degree of control over the user interface, and which are applicable to scenarios in which this is not the case, including web services.  </s>
<s> This may of course be evident enough already, but if not then we need to clarify it.  </s>
<s> 2. Guideline 1 essentially requires that sufficient structure and text equivalents be included to enable a user agent, a proxy server or other application processing the web content to adapt and customize the interface.  </s>
<s> Of course, the author may, and in practice often does, provide style sheets or "alternative forms" of the content for the purpose of enhancing and customizing the interface.  </s>
<s> When this is so, there are two interrelated dimensions of customization relevant to our guidelines, viz.: a. customization to suit different user needs and/or preferences.  </s>
<s> b. customization to enhance the quality of the interface for one or more device types.  </s>
<s> Of course, both categories are strongly connected, in that strategies intended for one type of customization will often benefit the other.  </s>
<s> For example, simple interfaces with few options available at any given moment, may be easier to present on devices with small screens.  </s>
<s> They are also of undoubted benefit to users with certain cognitive disabilities.  </s>
<s> Thus our guidelines need to say, in broad terms: If you plan to customize the interface (instead of just allowing the default user agent processing of the content format to take effect) then we recommend that the user interface be enhanced along two dimensions: a. to accommodate different skill levels and user preferences; b. to accommodate different device types.  </s>
<s> Much of this belongs in guidelines 2 and 3, though at present I am not sure how best to formulate these requirements as checkpoints.  </s>
<s> Another interesting question is: under what conditions should the author be required (for minimum conformance) to enhance the user interface in either or both of these ways?  </s>
<s> Can we establish general criteria here?  </s>
<s> I can only offer quite general observations at present.  </s>
<s> Obviously, if there are good grounds for believing that, without customization on the author's part, the default presentation created by particular types of user agents won't be satisfactory, then there are good grounds for the author to offer appropriate interface-level enhancements, including, where appropriate, the provision of multiple interfaces.  </s>
<s> There may also be some kind of complexity threshold beyond which it is advisable to offer a simpler alternative, but I suspect this is likely to be another case of "the interface has been reviewed and found to be as simple as is appropriate for the task, or a simpler alternative has been provided" (cf.  </s>
<s> checkpoint 4.1 in current draft).  </s>
<s> To summarize, I have identified two dimensions of user interface customization and argued that both should be treated in our guidelines.  </s>
<s> I have also argued that it may be necessary to clarify which of our checkpoints apply to content that doesn't include its own user interface, and which presuppose that a significant degree of authorial influence over the interface is possible.  </s>
<s> I'm thinking that a search function would fall more into 5.4 since it is basically a user interface.  </s>
<s> A search function would not fall into 4.3 simply because it would not necessarily be a complex operation, no fashion of abbreviated, and there are no summaries or definitions.  </s>
<s> What would be the alternative to a search function?  </s>
<s> Well, I haven't looked in quite some time now, but search engines used to have a help page.  </s>
<s> On the help page the engine provided examples on how to do various searches.  </s>
<s> I've seen too many times where a search wouldn't accept the pipe as an OR statement.  </s>
<s> I've also seen searches that don't accept the plus sign for AND searches.  </s>
<s> Therefore, I would recommend that we require a link to a help page so that people can understand how the searches are performed and what declarations can be used to handle AND, NOT, NOR, and OR searhes.  </s>
