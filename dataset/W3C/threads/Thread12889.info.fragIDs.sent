<s> Judy asked for comments on the slide content as follows: quote cite="" Our latest version, as of today's discussion, and on which I'll be asking for feedback on from the WAI CG (Coordinating Group): What is Web Accessibility?  </s>
<s> An accessible Web is one that can be used by people with disabilities, and also benefits other users of the Web.  </s>
<s> Web accessibility includes: - content that is presented in a way * that can be perceived, operated, navigated, and understood by people with disabilities;  </s>
<s> - software used to access the Web * that can be used by people with disabilities, * and that works with technologies that some people with disabilities use  </s>
<s> - software used to build Web sites * that can be used by people with disabilities, * and that supports creation of accessible Web sites; - technologies that underly the Web (HTML, CSS, SMIL, XML, etc) * that support accessible Web content and software.  </s>
<s> Yes, I have serious heartburn about this slide.  </s>
<s> What the WAI provides is knowledge about what it takes for the Web to be accessible, where "accessible" in this context means "accessible to people with disabilities."  </s>
<s> Stating that that is what "an accessible Web" *is* (implying outside of the discourse conducted on the W3C site) is an affront to the autonomy of every reader of this material.  </s>
<s> Don't go there.  </s>
<s> It is placing a gratuitous barrier in the way of having the reader sign on to follow our lead.  </s>
<s> Making the message inaccessible.  </s>
<s> There is also a problem that Wendy raised: the breakout that follows reflects a backward-looking view of what the Web is.  </s>
<s> This still reflects the Web one can browse today, but it does not describe the Web that the people PF talks with are building technologies for.  </s>
<s> But the real problem is not this obsolescence in the "what is the Web" story assumed.  </s>
<s> More fundamental than this accidental obsolescence is the unfortunate mixing of 'how' into 'what.' Break these out and tell both stories.  </s>
<s> "*What* an accessible Web *is* (in the context of the WAI publications) is a different matter from *how* to have an accessible Web (which is the topic of the WAI publications).  </s>
<s> The public controls the "Journalist's Agenda" of topics: who what when where why and how.  </s>
<s> If we haven't decomposed our story enough to distinguish among these primitives, we are not speaking in the common rhetorical vernacular.  </s>
<s> It's not just simple words, it simple story lines and roles within the plot that will make our story accessible.  </s>
<s> If we in the WAI are not re-factoring [see Extreme Programming] our understanding of our customer, the Web; and re-grouping our efforts around a forward-looking map of where the action is in creating the to-be Web, we will always be at least one technology generation behind in our assistive provisions, and we won't even be able to keep up with maintaining that, to boot.  </s>
<s> What we need on this point is something more or less like the following statement: "When we in the WAI talk about an 'accessible' Web, we mean "a web that is accessible to people with disabilities."  </s>
<s> What's the difference?  </s>
<s> We don't claim that this is what an 'accessible' Web *IS*, i.e. what this language should mean in any and all discourse contexts, but rather we take a humbler posture and _describe_ for the reader a short-cut form that we will habitually use because we need to refer frequently to this concept whose plain-language statement is a nested prepositional phrase.  </s>
<s> But that nested prepositional phrase employs a syntactic form that is controlled by the vast majority of speakers of English World-wide, and in the expanded adjective phrase form, it does not depend on any Terms of Art -- it uses terms that are current in the common parlance in their common senses.  </s>
<s> I am not sure if you want to include the development below in your overview stuff.  </s>
<s> It is how one should teach this patch of usage conventions, however: accessible [Webster] ::= readily grasped (to a user) [aside, to be developed in a footnote, but must be understood to see why the next is said as it is.] the Web is both a medium in which information is delivered and actions accepted from users, and a corpus of services engaged in those activities.  </s>
<s> Users don't distinguish between the medium and the message.  </s>
<s> [Here message == service, wherein web documents afford an information-transmittal service.]  </s>
<s> an accessible Web is a Web where: - the user can grasp the information that web content is trying to tell them, limited only by their ability to understand, not by any artifacts of the medium of expression.  </s>
<s> - the user can attain any outcome that Web applications are trying to offer them.  </s>
<s> - the user can remain confident that they are directing the course of the dialog  </s>
<s> a Web which is accessible to people with disabilities is one where the above three qualities are sustained in the presence of human conditions impairing functions often employed in the human-computer interaction of the user engaged with the above services.  </s>
<s> a Web which offers equal access to people with disabilities is one where the performance on the above three axes: complete delivery of information, complete access to outcomes, and effective command of the process -- is subtantially the same for people with disabilities and for people without disabilities.  </s>
<s> Recap: To make what we mean by various terms clear, we - must not make it sound as though we assume people should always equate accessibility with PWD accessibility.  </s>
<s> I.e. recognize and affirm the general sense of 'accessible.' Distinguish _our_ use of 'accessible' from what 'accessible' 'is' already to our audience.  </s>
<s> There is a great line on this in the current CACM in the article by Philip Agre "P2P and the Promise of Internet Equality[1]."  </s>
<s> He points out that technologists turned social advocates are singularly naive in failing to start with an assessment of how the public _already_ views the issue where they wish to sway public opinion.  </s>
<s> We have fallen into the same trap on this one.  </s>
<s> We don't define the topic.  </s>
<s> We have to engage with the topics that the public perceives.  </s>
<s> - distinguish between 'accessible' and 'equally accessible' because the bulk of experience falls within the difference between these two.  </s>
<s> Those are the basic must-haves in this phase of our exegesis.  </s>
<s> In addition, this slide degrades our exposition of what it is for the Web to be accessible (to PWD) -- which is simply a matter of the user's experience.  </s>
<s> This slide mixes in a deployment of "what it takes for the Web to be accessible" based on a backward-looking model of what _the Web_ is.  </s>
<s> This is bad on two counts.  </s>
<s> Don't mix the statement of what it is to be accessible -- which is in in operational performance terms in the user's experience -- with methods for attaining this outcome.  </s>
<s> Those have to be on two different slides.  </s>
<s> The bottom four bullets address "how the structure of the WAI Technical Activity addresses the issue of ensuring that the Web will be accessible."  </s>
<s> That is a very different issue from what "an accessible Web" 'is.' And we should not make that the question, anyway.  </s>
<s> Make it "The accessible web we are talking about _here_ is explanation/ ."  </s>

<s> Al, I agree that the WAI should use more phrases like "what we in the WAI mean by xxx is yyy", other than that however, you may have lost me.  </s>
<s> I do have a comment about the second bullet on the slide:  </s>
<s> - software used to access the Web * that can be used by people with disabilities, * and that works with technologies that some people with disabilities use  </s>
<s> My comment is that it is more than software, it also includes devices and other technology, including graphics displays (or monitors), voice synthesizers, Braille displays, printed output, small displays, etc.  </s>
<s> So, I would simply add the word "hardware" along with "software" - software and hardware used to access the Web * that can be used by people with disabilities, * and that works with technologies that some people with disabilities use Regards, Phill Jenkins IBM Research Division - Accessibility Center 11501 Burnet Rd, Austin TX 78758 http://www.ibm.com/able  </s>
<s> It is a little difficult to respond without seeing all the context.  </s>
<s> I looked through the group archives, but it was not entirely illuminating.  </s>
<s> I agree with Al that we should remember that what we mean by an "accessible Web" is narrower than what people in the wide world understand.  </s>
<s> But I don't have any heartburn about using the term like this.  </s>
<s> I also agree that the suggested phrasing confuses the "what is" with the "how do we make".  </s>
<s> I think Al's suggested approach of saying:  </s>
<s> is a much better approach, although it could do with some editing.  </s>
<s> (I also like short slides.  </s>
<s> In an online presentation there is room for more than in slides which are used in a talk, but the draft below seems very long).  </s>
<s> It should then be followed by a slide or two that talks about how this can be achieved, and the fact that there are different parts to the puzzle.  </s>
<s> (I would use two - one on authoring, which includes standards for content and tools that support that, and one on tools people use to get to the content, that support the standards and requirements.  </s>
<s> Your mileage may differ...) On Phill's point about  </s>
<s> My assumption is that this is a three-line explanation of UAAG and its role, and it seems to compress too much.  </s>
<s> Outside the office-bound desktop-plus-assistive technology there are real hardware issues in using browsers.  </s>
<s> Mobile phones, PDA's whether visual, voice or braille based, kiosk-style terminals, cash registers, internet refrigerators (being heavily promoted in melbourne right now) and the like are often not very flexible about how you can interact with them, yet they are taking on more of the role of providing access to the Web for work and civic participation.  </s>
<s> This is in addition to the software that they use to access the Web - in some cases it also encompasses their own operating system software.  </s>
<s> So the issues strike me as including both the hardware and software people use to access the web, and that this needs to be usable by everyone, configurable to suit their preferences, and able to work with any additional hardware or software they require to support their needs and preferences.  </s>
<s> Sorry for the delayed response.  </s>
<s> I spent some time trying to find more context for the slide, but couldn't.  </s>
