<s> What we have done is come up with a Developers Object that Works with AccMonitor this will allow for organizations to impliment a web based AccVerify.  </s>
<s> This object uses configuration and tests from AccMonitor to test for All QA Factors including Accessibility.  </s>
<s> We will be Releasing a Complete C# ASP.NET Developers Kit and a VS.Net Solution Sample Later this week.  </s>
<s> We are currently running tests on how it works from different platforms, We have put a sample Application up on our site and have configured it for Accessibility and Alt Text Quality tests.  </s>
<s> We would appreciate any feedback on the beta tester and how people found the default (Basic) interface to use.  </s>
<s> While users of this solution will develop their own interfaces for their organization this will most likely be the starting point.  </s>
<s> * This will also be the basis for the New Spanish Language Tester that we are Jointly Developing with SIDAR www.sidar.org  </s>
<s> * In the Near Future, Working with our Partners of the cynthiasays.com  </s>

<s> [Beta Testers] Request for testers AccVerify ASP.NET InterfaceHi Robert!  </s>
<s> I just tested a page with http://www.hisoftware.com/aspnetdemo/default.aspx and I do not understand, where do you have this guideline from: "2.1 Validate that Alternative Text is  7 and 81 characters in length Short alternative text may not be valid, warn the report user if alternative text was found that is less than seven characters in length or greater then 80 characters in length."  </s>
<s> Thanks in advance for your kind response.  </s>

<s> HSFT Alt Quality 2.1: http://www.hisoftware.com/cc/altquality.htm#a21  </s>
<s> The Alt Text Quality Report is based on what we have found to be a flag on determining programatically if alternative text may need to be reviewed.  </s>
<s> Fo example is it descriptive enough or should longdesc be used.  </s>
<s> We have created this custom Guideline based on some "Best Practices" that have been pointed out by our customers over the last few years.  </s>
<s> Within the Software the user can modify these custom test to match their best practices that they follow.  </s>
<s> The XML File that drives these files can be modified and in most cases needs to be.  </s>
<s> Explains what this test does and it issues a warning - It is meant to flag alt text that may need to be reviewed.  </s>
<s> Here is more information on the custom checks: We provide an editor for these checks or they can be edited in any XML Editor or even text editor.  </s>
<s> I hope this helps!  </s>
