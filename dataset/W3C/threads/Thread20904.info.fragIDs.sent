<s> Hi, The current Amaya release procedure could be improved if deadlines for contributions were stated somewhere.  </s>
<s> Amaya team should take into account that the translation of messages and help files should be done after English version is frozen.  </s>
<s> I suggest the following procedure: Day 1: Pre-release.  </s>
<s> Announce the number of days for pre-release testing (a week at least, say n1) Day 1+n1: Pre-release testing ends.  </s>
<s> Day 1+n1+1: English version freeze.  </s>
<s> Announce the number of days for translation (2 or 3 days, say n2) Day 1+n2+1+n2: Translation freeze.  </s>
<s> Day 1+n2+1+n2+1: Release.  </s>
<s> Best regards, Bartolom?  </s>

<s> We can publish new translations after the Amaya release is done as translations are delivered in separate files (amayadoc-8.2.tgz and amayadoc-8.2.exe).  </s>
<s> What date would you propose for a new version of the documentation.  </s>
<s> Irene.  </s>

<s> Hi  </s>
<s> Help files are in separate files, but message files are not, are they?  </s>
<s> I can send updated Spanish help files on Tuesday (November, 18th).  </s>
<s> Best regards, Barto  </s>
