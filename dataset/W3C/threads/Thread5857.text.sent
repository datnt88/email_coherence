Good afternoon, Concerns : OWL Web Ontology Language Guide page 7 of 49 xml:base should be ="http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/PR-owl-guide-20031215/wine" and not ="http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/PR-owl-guide-20031215/wine#" page 8 of 49 xml:base is not ="&amp;vin;" Yours sincerely * Prof. Pierre GASPART * * Dept Flexible Production Systems * * University of Brussels (U.L.B.) * * 50 Av.

If so, Which kind of ontology is OWL specification? 
It is a representational ontology or task ontology? 
Yours sincerely You ask a hard question - because it hinges on exactly what one defines as an ontology, a representational ontology, or a task ontology. 
OWL is precisely specified in our documents and in a sense the only true answer to your question is "what is in the documents is what OWL is" --- that said, perhaps the following will be useful in helping you to answer your own question: 1 - OWL minimizes the "content" component purposely (by charter) - in other words OWL is not a specific set of content, but rather a convention for expressing content. 
There are some terms which are defined by OWL (or used consistently from RDF and RDF Schema), but in general it is meant to be a language for defining ontologies - not an "ontology" unto itself 2 - OWL has been used in many cases to define what has sometimes been called a "representational ontology" where that means soemthing like a specification of physical entities and their relationships. 
Many good examples of this can be found in the DAML Ontology Library [1] 3 - OWL has also been used to define "task" or "process" ontologies, where this term is used to mean a description of things in the world that change over time or a description of what the AI community has called in the past "planning operators." 
The best example I know of this can be found in the OWL-S work, which aims to use OWL to provide semantics for Web Service applications [2]. 
I hope this helps.
