I've just installed netscape 6.1, and it seems to present a problem for my clients... 
I cannot get it to plain open.... one has to select a 'profile' then 'activation' starts, and one has to either, type in a user name and password, or click cancel it is very insistent about allowing cookies. 
Has anyone else tried this version? 
any views on its accessibility, is this something for UA? is it perhaps a sign of the times?? 
thanks jonathan chetwynd IT teacher (LDD) j.chetwynd@btinternet.com on the web" I just checked mozilla 0.9.3 and it has a similar problem, selecting a 'profile' thankfully the cookie and activation problems are currently not. 
jonathan chetwynd IT teacher (LDD) j.chetwynd@btinternet.com Jonathan; The process you're describing is a process that will create a local directory for users. 
This stores user preferences and data (like password remembering data) unique to the user. 
After that is complete you'll be asked to activate a membership at the Netscape portal, though this can be cancelled. 
Mozilla.org has an accessibility coordinator, but I'm unsure of the priority accessibility has in the development there.

That's skeptical, and more than a bit cynical, but probably closest to the truth. 
Well, not exactly that bad grin / . 
BugZilla is reporting 12 active bugs, half of them assigned to developers. 
Two have triggered errors with support for the ATAG and the UAAG, there's a few for Microsoft's Active Accessibility. 
There are also a couple where folks have noted errors on the mozilla.org 
site using the WCAG 1.0.

Yeah, well...Pardon my skepticism of the net community's generally caring about accessibility. 
Case in point: AOL. 
The thing still doesn't work more than laughably with screenreaders, and the NFB never restarted their lawsuit, which looked hopeful to really garner attention after the AOL-TW merger and make changes happen. 
In a message dated 8/20/01 4:42:59 PM Eastern Daylight Time, I haven't checked every possible problem or its resolution, however the profile selection seems to be completely unusable via jaws and this will exclude blind users, I believe, as well as my clients. 
Oh. beautiful....Y'know, this brings up a huge thought...Does anyone bother to talk to Hunter-Joyce/Freedom Scientific about these things? 
I've been noticing a LOT of things like this, where it seems like a little input from the developers could go a long way. 
actually, there are many situations in which a scren reader user may be using a shared system but let's put that asside for the moment and talk about the original question which was pointing out the fact that the profile box did not work with a screen reader. 
This should be over come not swept asside. 
As to who is talking to who, I think when the dust settles on this one, it should be fairly accessible although I cannot understand why we had a fairly accessible netscape through 4.75 and now suddenly the wheel is being re-invented. 
I haven't checked every possible problem or its resolution, however the profile selection seems to be completely unusable via jaws and this will exclude blind users, I believe, as well as my clients. 
anyone I've input Hang on for a moment. 
I've not tested this in Netscape, but in Mozilla 0.9.3 (which is the latest stable release), the command mozilla -P profilename starts the browser without prompting for a profile. 
This should solve the described problem, yes ? 
I am making the less-than-ideal assumption here that a visually impaired user is not sharing her/his machine with too many other people in the same situation, and in such a case defaulting the profile with -P should work. 
- Tina Holmboe Open source projects tend to be [*] notoriously bad when it comes to usability and accessibility. 
Usually they are written by programmers, for programmers, and there's never anyone with any sort of "QA" or "UI design requirements" who can enforce those on the rest of the project. 
--Kynn [*] = "tend to be" means "almost always but you can find exceptions" so please don't post to describe an exception -- I know that there are such things, but the generalization still stands.

- Tina Holmboe of course Mozilla is open source so like most all open source projects it gets only as much attention as the volunteers put into it, if there are folks on the dev group that are concerned about access then there is likely to be good access, and if there isn't well it is unlikely to be there.

Thanks Correct. 
However, the profile box is not a necessary evil, as it can be circumvented - I do so regularly to avoid Mozilla hanging whilst waiting for input if I open it trough - for instance - xchat or tkrat (IRC and mail client respectively). 
This is - in my opinion - a very similar situation. 
I use several virtual monitors, and a browser window always appear on one specific one of them. 
If, then, I start the browser from a different virtual monitor I cannot see the profile box, and it will theoretically hang there until I check. 
The problem has alot in common with the oh-so-popular pop-up windows on the web; some of which pop up on parts of my virtual monitor where I am not looking. 
But enough rambling. 
The -P workaround does mean that Mozilla is able to work with JAWS, yes ? 
Is this really an accessibility *problem* ? 
- Tina Holmboe But enough rambling.

no -P in windows though? 
jonathan chetwynd IT teacher (LDD) j.chetwynd@btinternet.com on the web" A quick dig in Mozilla's documentation gives me which does list -P as a Win32 option as well. 
Granted, it also states that "NOTE: Several of these features still haven't been fully implemented, so expected results might vary from build to build" but that isn't uncommon for works-in-progress. 
In addition to -P, it lists a few other options - like -nosplash - that seems to be useful for more streamlined use of Mozilla. 
The quoted option is used under Win32 only, and removes the 'splash' screen at startup. 
I don't run Windows myself, so I never tested these, however. 
- Tina Holmboe yes, we still have a problem. the less "special" requirements on the user end to make a product usable, the more likely the product will be used. 
The profile dialog is accessible on the system I use it on but that is before ns6. 
But enough rambling.

jonathan chetwynd IT teacher (LDD) j.chetwynd@btinternet.com directory on the web" I understand your points. 
To explain more fully, a computer that is used by many people in one house or place may not have the convenience of setting different network log ins for one reason or another so will be presented with the dialog. 
all members of the family or group but those without the capability of accessing the dialog will have no problems. 
Again, I want to emphasize that although it has always been possible to configure as you suggest and it is a good approach, it does not come down to the level that many consumers are dealing with. 
Network admins and savvy pc users such as those many of whom are found here will be able to climb the steps. 
Others will need a ramp so why not make the dialog accessible? 
I might after all be a blind sys-admin. 
[ Could you quote according to standard, please ? 
It really messes up my mail-handling. 
Thankyou. 
] Hm. 
It seems to me that what you are suggesting, here, is that any built-in method for changing the behaviour of a system falls into the 'special requirement' cathegory ? 
I would have no difficulty understanding the problem IF the dialog you speak of was a) impossible to get around, and b) always necessary. 
The profile dialogue of Mozilla is needed only in the event of a multi-user system, and in such a case can be configured to start with the profile matching the user currently logged in. 
Should the dialogue be useable with JAWS, it still requires the user to select a profile before proceeding. 
Specifying it directly seems a much more flexible and useable method; as well as leaving the profile handling to the system administrator instead of the user. 
Could you describe in more detail the problem you see here ? 
I am quite sure I've not understood it properly. 
From my point of view it seems that any system you can set up to automatically remove unnecessary bits and pieces of 'fluff' is *more* accessible, not less. 
It certainly does remove complexity that way. 
Thankyou.

- Tina Holmboe AG:: No, no, no. 
But command-line switches are a 'special requirement' for a Windows user, by gum! 
You have to create a scriptlet that invokes with the command line switch and then create a shortcut to the scriptlet. 
Not equivalent facilitation to your basic install and personalization assistance. 
It is precisely to avoid burdening user with this kind of requirement that the makeUserProfile wizard was introduced in the first place. 
The wizard is a mode-specific implementation of something that optimizes getting going for GUI capable users and makes it worse for those not GUI capable because now the other way of doing it is there but inadequately documented and supported and all that. 
Search the UA list archives for 'rosmaita' for discourses on the documentation requirements of the UAAG. 
This is a chronic sore point, that because initial configuration functions are infrequently performed the publishers forget to make them accessible. 
Thereby defeating the access to all the accessibility mods they put into the in-use mode.
