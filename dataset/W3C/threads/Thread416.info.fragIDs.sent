Hello Dave Please forgive my writing to you but I am a little confused about a behaviour in tidy.exe. 
If you write a terminating tag - /span , for example - but with a space between the slash and the tag word - / span - tidy.exe does not detect it and puts another terminating tag - in the "correct" format - where it thinks appropriate. 
Is it a W3C requirement that there is no intervening space character between the slash and the tag word?

The tag name must immediately follow the tag delimiter.

Yes, you can't put spaces between  and the tag name for a start tag, neither can put spaces between / and the tag name for end tags.
