<s> Hello Dave Please forgive my writing to you but I am a little confused about a behaviour in tidy.exe.  </s>
<s> If you write a terminating tag - /span , for example - but with a space between the slash and the tag word - / span - tidy.exe does not detect it and puts another terminating tag - in the "correct" format - where it thinks appropriate.  </s>
<s> Is it a W3C requirement that there is no intervening space character between the slash and the tag word?  </s>

<s> Yes, you can't put spaces between  and the tag name for a start tag, neither can put spaces between / and the tag name for end tags.  </s>
