Hi, I am doing some work for a large UK company that sells a range of 'accessible' products alongside its standard product range. 
They are currently under the category of 'accessible products' - BUT in user testing when looking for accessible products NOBODY look in this category! 
'Accessible' is a great word for people in the industry, but currently it doesn't mean a great deal to anyone else. 
Can anyone suggest another term? 
We tried 'special needs' but the client isn't happy with that because the phrase has negative connotations in the UK.

Patrick Patrick H. Lauke Webmaster / University of Salford I don't think the suppliers of products that don't fit into the 'user friendly' (i.e. accessible) category, would be very happy about that.

"Easier use"? 
I was in a bar the other day. 
The main toliets were up a flight of stairs. 
There was a toilet on the main floor, labelled with the text "Easy access toilet" which struck me as being quite a nice inclusive term; it wasn't for disabled people, to was for people who couldn't get up the stairs. 
Andrew Andrew McFarland Why have a label at all? 
For example, speaking from a UK perspective, what about older people - surely having different options benefits everyone doesn't it ? 
I think using the categories is starting from the wrong place. 
There is repressed demand I think (people choose from only standard products as you point out). 
ok, maybe that doesn't solve your problem.

I like the term "easy access", however it doesn't cover the 'carer products' such as emergency pendants for the elderly that they can use to summon help from carers. 
All good stuff though mischa "Easy use"?

Inclusive? 
Or if they're selling to consumers (so it's end-users making the decision), some form of the wheelchair-symbol thingey?

Hi, I like the idea of including the items in the most appropriate mainstream category (by product description) eg: * phones (xyz brand big button phone), * hardware (abc brand amplifier or visual alert signals) * emulators eg TTY Maybe the quick search categories could also include an accessible design options, but my experience is that most people would start looking by product description rather than a discrete category that is seperate to other 'standard' products. 
People with disabilities also benefit from features such as cordless phones, handsfree/speaker phones and mobile phones (illuminated displays, vibration call alert, voice dial etc) - would these be classified as accessible or standard? 
Cheers, Sandra.

Why either-or? 
List the stuff in the general category to which it belongs, *and* then include a cross-ref link to "easy use/accessible products." 
That way folks who don't know what to look for find it, and folks who do know what they're looking for find it also. 
my two pesos, Leslie Universal?

Nick Kew In urgent need of paying work - see http://www.webthing.com/~nick/cv.html "Universal" does makes good sense, Nick. 
yes, the wheelchair is great, and a 'magnifying glass' symbol might be good too. 
I think the text "assistive" or "assisting" would be very appropriate. 
Perhaps you/they can "quickly" survey to determine what category name would get used - possibly a poll.

Subject: a word for 'accessible', that people get. 
testing "Real world ready" "Realistically usable" "Ready for use" "Unencumbered" "Human friendly" "Access friendly" "Access ready" "Accessified" If the products are described in sufficient detail in such a way that people can make an informed purchasing choice, then the 'accessible' label *should* be academic. 
Labeling products as being specifically for 'the disabled' reinforces the idea of separateness, and runs contrary to concepts of inclusion and universality. 
For that reason, the best terms would be 'universal', or 'inclusive'. 
Good idea to poll these though (if you have time). 
For that reason too, definitely no to the wheelchair symbol. 
Although it's easily recognized, the wheelchair symbol negatively and inaccurately labels the range of people with a disability and reinforces stereotypes. 
Far better if you can come up with a symbol for 'easy use'. 
Good luck on that one! 
Lars Stenberg Sensory Trust "Universal" does makes good sense, Nick.

Stephen Jones assistive or inclusive technology may fit your needs, speaking of which you may wish to contact: http://www.inclusive.co.uk/ take especial care to look at their online catalogue.
