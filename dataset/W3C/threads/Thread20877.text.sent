The following contains an XHTML error -------------------------------------8??-------------------------- !DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.1//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml11/DTD/xhtml11.dtd" / blockquote xml:lang="ang" "Hige sceal &amp;thorn;e heardra, heorte &amp;thorn;e cenre, p mod sceal &amp;thorn;e mare, &amp;thorn;e ure m??gen lytla&amp;eth;.... " /blockquote -------------------------------------8??-------------------------- and, when loaded into Amaya 8.1b on Win2k, it notes that this is not well- formed and asks whether to show errors or display as HTML. 
Choosing the former shows up the message:- Each error line is a link. 
It can be activated by a double (or a single) click *** Errors/warnings in filename line 12, char 0: warning - unsupported language: ang line 13, char 18: mismatched tag Odd behaviour #1 (bug) If I edit the source window, by dragging the scrollbar to show the spurious p , putting my cursor at the start of the erroneous tag, dragging to select it all and then hitting the delete key, subsequently selecting the File menu shows the Save option "greyed out", as if the change hasn't quite registered. 
I have to click in the source window to move focus somewhere else before the Save option is made available. 
Odd behaviour #2 (simply weird) When I close Amaya, then drag the now-fixed file onto the desktop icon, this time there is no load-time message at all about the section marked with the ISO 639-2 code for Anglo-Saxon that there was previously. 
This leads to a number of questions - How does one get to show warnings by themselves, if that's all there is? 
What is meant by "support" of a language anyway? 
On Fri, 17 Oct 2003 09:43:38 +0100 There is an event sent to Win32 to refresh menu entries after the editing. 
Probably you see the menu with the Save option "greyed out" before the refresh event was managed. 
Your file was stored into the libwww cache. 
Amaya manages only the ISO 639 list of languages.

, Ah! But there is ISO 639-1 which defines two letter codes for language names and ISO 639-2 which defines three letter codes for language names. 
I have XML Schema for them both if anyone is interested.
