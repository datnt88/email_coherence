<s> This includes a significant improvement to the DTM system which should remove our past limitations on number of documents and/or document size, by allowing a DTM to "overflow" from one DTMID to another.  </s>
<s> It also includes a few critical bugfixes in other areas.  </s>
<s> Executables, documentation, and samples are now packaged separately from the source files and testcases.  </s>
