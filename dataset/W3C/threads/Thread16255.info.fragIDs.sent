Hi, It looks like I'm going to be meeting with some people from the New York Times as part of a project. 
Is there anything I should point out to them about their web site? 
Scott 
aloha, scott! 
please let them know that the text-only slash low bandwidth version of 
their site makes them the most accessible online newspaper that i've yet to 
encounter.... 
overall, their web site (with a few significant holes, such as the magazine 
section) is easy to use, and is quite a popular source of news for blind users, especially those who use lynx... gregory.

Hi, Gregory Your response is kind of unexpected. 
First, the use of text-only versions means that the NY Times is out of compliance with the guidelines. 
Another interesting aspect is that your comment supports what I've been saying about the usefulness of multiple versions of dynamically generated web pages. 
It also points out that the guidelines may need to have different requirements depending on whether the web pages are created dynamically or not.

aloha, scott! 
extending my complimentary comments on a text-only version of a site that is comprehensively updated every 24 hours to a text-only version of a more 
static site mis-characterizes my comments... my response represents a gut-level reaction that is (a) common amongst blind users because they have no better alternatives; (b) is an example of a well-thought-out alternative to the full-blown graphical version of the site; (c) a solution which not only pre-dates WCAG; but which was not intended to be a quote accessibility-oriented unquote implementation; and (d) is specific to a particular site which is conscientiously updated to be in sync with the full-blown graphical version of the site... furthermore, whilst i am philosophically opposed to the maintenance of 
parallel text-only sites, the new york times' text-only slash low bandwidth site does not strike me as an incidence of cyber-ghettoization, as it is not a static parallel, but is as dynamically updated as the high-bandwidth version of the site... and, i'd hardly be surprised if the content contained in both versions comes from one central source and is then dumped into the appropriate template... the text-only slash low-bandwidth version of the new york times site is simply an example of providing a much needed service -- making the content of the site available to the broadest range of users possible... the 
text-only version wasn't created with accessibility in mind, but with convenience, general usability, and (most importantly from the service providers' point of view) maximum market penetration in mind -- you may recall that the online version of the new york times was not originally intended to be free forever, but was originally intended as a pilot program to ascertain demand for an online version of the newspaper, which the times originally envisioned as a fee-for-service site, out of fear of undermining sales of the print edition, but which proved so popular that no-fee access to the content of the newspaper continues today... in summation, it is an example of something that works for a lot of disabled users by happenstance, and not design, which bolsters the argument that accessibility issues aren't quote special case unquote issues, but general usability issues...

Scott, I don't understand why you say: "... the use of text-only versions means that the NY Times is out of compliance with the guidelines." 
I can't find any checkpoint in the content guidelines that prohibits text-only sites. 
The pertinent checkpoint seems to be 11.4: "If, after best efforts, you cannot create an accessible page, provide a link to an alternative page that uses W3C technologies, is accessible, has equivalent information (or functionality), and is updated as often as the inaccessible (original) page." 
Would you please elaborate? 
Thanks, Dick Brown

Hi, Gregory I believe that you may have mis-interpreted my statements. 
I was referring to dynamically generated web pages which could be created in a text-only format or in a graphic format. 
I wasn't referring to static web sites. 
One thing I hear you saying is: (b) is an example of a well-thought-out alternative to the full-blown graphical version of the site which gives the impression that you approve of well thought out alternatives to graphical versions of web pages on web sites which are frequently updated. 
Am I correct in my understanding? 
If the web site were updated ever 15 seconds, it would seem that you would approve of that. 
So, it would seem reasonable to assume that you would approve of text-only pages which were generated on demand. 
I think you are getting to understand a point I've been making. 
Dynamically generated web pages can share the same content from the same source, but present it in different formats. 
I question an assumption you are making that all accessibility needs are usability needs. 
This is very faulty. 
For example, when I get on an airplane, I need to use a special narrow aisle chair. 
I have never seen it used by a non-disabled person. 
I believe a more accurate perception is that there are some accessibility needs which also help with usability. 
There are other accessibility needs which are very specialized and do not contribute to usability. 
I believe that some disabled people don't want to see their needs as special because they don't want to be seen as having special needs. 
They sometimes stretch their accessibility needs into usability needs in order to feel better about not having special needs. 
What is universal design? 
It is based on needs. 
However, there really has not been a study about what needs do blind people have when using web pages. 
The only investigations are more along the line of what do blind people need when they share web pages with sighted people. 
The result is that various needs of blind people when using web pages have been ignored or over-looked. 
If needs of a user group are ignored or over-looked, can a design truly be called universal?

Hi, Dick 
That was the checkpoint I was referring to. 
However, my statement was not about text-only web sites, but web sites with parallel graphic and text-only web pages which the checkpoint strongly urges avoiding unless absolutely necessary. 
Scott 
"absolutely necessary" is hard to define. 
Note, also, that it doesn't forbid the creation of text-only 
sites for _non-disability-access_ reasons. 
For example, it's possible that they think a text-only site is the best way to convey their information or they're trying to cater to a Lynx crowd.

All, It might also be the best way to convey information to low bandwidth areas, 
which includes a large portion of the world.

Hi, Kynn Yes. 
You're absolutely right about the checkpoint. 
I was stuck in the disability access mode.

aloha, kynn! 
in response to scott, you observed: quote

unquote 
which was part of my original point -- the alternate slash parallel version of the site was created with anything but accessibility in mind -- maximum market penetration is what the times was and is after, and their text only 
version not only caters to the text-only market, but may someday become the basis for a fee based dial in phone service... gregory He that lives on Hope, dies farting -- Benjamin Franklin, Poor Richard's Almanack, 1763 Gregory J. Rosmaita unagi69@concentric.net

People with cognitive disability also benefit from text summaries and small images where bandwidth is limited. 
large amounts of text offer a poor solution to bandwidth where english is not the first language. 
small graphics are an enormous benefit in aiding comprehension. 
It(text only) might also be the best way to convey information to low 
bandwidth areas,

If I might make a comment on that specific point: it seems to me to be a fundamental misunderstanding to "cater to" Lynx users by generating text-only versions. 
Text-only versions can (paradoxically?) be useful to those using graphical browsers, because those browsers typically do not behave well when auto image loading is turned off. 
Lynx has no difficulty in accessing a non-customised web page in text mode, and displaying the appropriate text-mode fallback that has been provided (we hope, in accordance with good WWW design practice). 
No matter how cleverly the multiple variants of the same page might be generated, the procedure inevitably impacts cacheability. 
If the benefits outweigh that, then it would be OK, and there could well be situations where that seems to be the case; but as a general principle, I don't believe they do. 
best regards 
I wasn't endorsing the design consideration, only trying to explain a possible (valid) design consideration. 
As long as you allow access for -everyone-, it -is- a valid design decision to create pages optimized for a particular browser or set of browsers. 
(Doing this correctly is difficult, which is why information ghettoization is a problem.) I don't personally -agree- with this design decision and I would argue against it, but I would not argue that it's an invalid thing for someone to want to do.
