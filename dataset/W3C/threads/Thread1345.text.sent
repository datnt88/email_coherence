Currently, you can specify a "Depth:infinity" header for MERGE. 
Since you can get the same effect by saying that a MERGE is always depth infinity, and that you can just use the version URL of a version-controlled collection if you want a "Depth:0" merge, I vote that we remove the Depth header as a needless complication to the MERGE method. 
Any objections?

Dropping an additional parameter is always a Good Thing(tm).

Go ahead and remove it.
