<s> Dear friends, There is the quite interesting situation that the browser market is more or less controlled by Microsoft's Internet Explorer respectively some people use Netscape and Opera.  </s>
<s> When you create a website, you just need to take care of these three type of programmes.  </s>
<s> We publish an e-mail newsletter and we are confronted with the fact that there are hundreds of mail programmes (MS, AOL, T-Online, ...) and freemail websites (Yahoo, Hotmail, GMX, Web.de, ...).  </s>
<s> We made the experience that there are some basic rules that every uses.  </s>
<s> But others like IBM Lotus Notes don't even know the command table width="x" .  </s>
<s> Why has W3C achieved standards for the internet, but (until now) no standards for e-mail that everybody uses?  </s>
<s> Best regards from good old Europe,  </s>
