<s> Hi, I have been studing the HTTP/1.1 specs and have noted with interest the changes to HTTP/1.0 which formally define the requirements for agents, to use peristant connections and caching.  </s>
<s> There seems to be a certain incompatibility in the methods used to achieve caching the ones to reduce latency and bandwitdh requirements by the use fo persistant connections.  </s>
<s> Put simply persistant connections require me to place all my related documents, images, etc on a single comman server, while to facilitate caching it might be very useful to use a comman url for inlaid images.  </s>
<s> For example an entire university might use images located on a master image server and use a single URL for refering to their emblem.  </s>
<s> Also certain very comman images almost always exist in the cache (like the icons used by the apache web server (for mime types..), etc) Since caching still (and this is a real disappointment) depends on the URL matching exactly and not on some new unique name space both the requirements cannot be achieved concurrently.  </s>
<s> I have a couple of suggestions for a new scheme which allows for the use of the present URL scheme while still retaining the benefits of both persistant connections and caching.  </s>
<s> I don't think I have been particularly clear on the topics I have mentioned but I don't hope the main point is noted.  </s>
<s> I'll come up with a page that explains these is a better fashion, but don't you all think this is an issue that has to be opened.  </s>

<s> I may be wrong, but I believe that e.g. Netscape opens 4 connections by default.  </s>
<s> Can it (or any agent that opens multiple conections) have persistant connections to multiple servers, and win/win ?  </s>
<s> This seemed to me to be a good idea in general, but I'm not so sure about linking images from places around the world (Blue Ribbon, etc.) due to network problems giving partly-broken pages.  </s>
<s> See I think some of these problems may go away if/when URNs are deployed instead of URLs (for multiply-sourced objects) Andrew Daviel mailto:advax@triumf.ca TRIUMF &amp; Vancouver Webpages  </s>
<s> HTTP/1.1 clients can have as many TCP connections simultaneously open to DIFFERENT HTTP servers as they want.  </s>
