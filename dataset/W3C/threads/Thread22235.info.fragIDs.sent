<s> Been a long road to this point.  </s>
<s> Probably would be good to tag the CVS at this point and continue on with the next milestones.  </s>
<s> Any W3C convention for tagging releases in the CVS?  </s>
<s> If not, how about calling it L1Core-R1.0?  </s>
<s> Probably next step would be to identify the open issues with the L2 Core suite.  </s>
<s> Obviously, the getElementsByTagName("*","whatever") issue needs to be resolved.  </s>
<s> I don't remember any other open issues off the top of my head.  </s>
<s> The Mozilla HTML loader in DOMTestSuite.js was failing, but it might have just been a nighly build issue.  </s>
<s> It had worked with previous versions, I haven't tried it with the 0.9.8 milestone release.  </s>
<s> What I had misinterpreted as a problem with getElementsByTagName()'s case-sensitivity appears to be a failure to load the body element into the DOM (which causes massive numbers of test failures).  </s>
<s> The Mozilla XML implementation will crash in one of the DOM L2 Core tests (about 2/3 of the way through).  </s>
<s> There had been a similar situation earlier with the DOM L1 tests.  </s>
<s> It would be nice if someone could do a find the cases that are failing.  </s>
<s> With the DOM L1, basically had to do a half interval search, splitting alltests.xml  </s>
<s> into smaller fragments until the failure was located.  </s>
<s> I don't know if the Venkman JS debugger will let you debug a script that large (MS Interdev 6 had problems with massive scripts).  </s>
<s> If you have access to Mozilla's talkback data, if you can find a recent log for carnold@houston.rr.com, it should point to the method that failed.  </s>
<s> I'll probably change test-to-jsunit.xsl  </s>
<s> to add an unload() call at the end of any test that loads and modifies a document.  </s>
<s> Closing the corresponding window in that call would minimize the desktop clutter from running the HTML tests.  </s>
<s> It would do nothing in XML or SVG loaders.  </s>
<s> I use the date for the DOM specifications: such as "CVS Tags: WD-DOM-Level-3-CMLS-20010209"  </s>
<s> how about "DOMTSL1Core-20020213" ?  </s>
<s> Philippe  </s>
<s> And adding to that, let's think in terms of rewriting the HTML tests for the updated release of DOM TS L1  </s>
<s> Yeah, I know I've been quiet lately; sorry I've not been able to make more time available.  </s>
<s> The "." in the tag name is not allowed by CVS (probably not by RCS  </s>
<s> either).  </s>
<s> For Python, we tag minor releases with r version and major releases with release version , just dropping the dots (though that doesn't scale).  </s>
<s> Using a different term for "release" makes it easy to read through the list of tags at the top of "cvs log" output.  </s>
<s> If the W3C doesn't already have a convention, I'll propose the tags have the form what -(r|release) version , where what is something like the "L1Core" you propose (perhaps a hyphen between the level and the component would help readability?), and version is the version number with dots replaced by underscores or hyphens (but always the same).  </s>

<s> either).  </s>
<s> The DOMTS seems a little redundant in the DOM-Test-Suite module, however what is 5 extra characters.  </s>
<s> I like it actually, though I'd be inclined to stick an extra hyphen in there.  </s>
<s> ;-) As long as the DOM TS shares a CVS repository with other projects, the tags should be carefully identified.  </s>
<s> -Fred Fred L. Drake, Jr. fdrake at acm.org PythonLabs at Zope Corporation  </s>
<s> I tagged the repository using the following command: cvs tag DOMTSL1Core-20020213 * It matches the name of the zip/tgz files at Philippe  </s>
