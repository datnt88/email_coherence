<s> aloha, charles!  </s>
<s> to which Gregory responds: true, enough, but as was debated at the cambridge face2face meetings (i believe) when it was proposed that portions of 2.7 be rolled into 2.4, this is important enough an issue to address in a discrete guideline... the point is that while, yes, it is definitely a P1 to quote make generation of accessible content a naturally integrated part of the authoring process unquote, it is also necessary to make accessible content a naturally integrated part of the help system... the difference here is that guideline 2.4 is concerned with getting the authoring tool to present the user with the accessible solution first and as the default, whereas 2.7 is concerned with the documentation of accessible authoring practices, and the natural integration of accessible markup into each and every applicable example of implementation methods (i.e. choosing style sheets to change font size and color) and in every example of code (the sample markup for a form, for example, should include fieldset, legend, label, accesskey, and tabindex, etc.) yes, 2.4 and 2.7 are inter-related, but they are 2 methods of achieving a common goal: the production of authoring tools that not only output accessible content and which are themselves accessible, but which also educate the user (or at least alert him or her) about accessibility issues, thereby enabling them (that is, the authors themselves, rather than the tool exclusively) to make educated decisions about the content and (equally important in my mind) structure of the pages they produce... what a specific guideline on help/documentation does, therefore, is to assist in the production not only of more accessible (and more structured) content, but in the production of more enlightened authors, as well... if accessibility isn't addressed in each and every applicable instance in the help files and documentation that accompanies the tool, the implicit message is: accessibility is a quote worthwhile unquote consideration, and there exist methods of making ubiquitous mark-up accessible, but these built-in features of the markup are not really as important as the rest of the quote hardcore unquote markup and output with which ninety percent of your users will interact...  </s>
<s> how can we condone, let alone give our stamp of approval to, a tool which shows how to construct a form or table _without_ including the accessibility features associated with such elements as part-and-parcel of what constitutes a form or a table?  </s>
<s> if we leave the current 2.7.1 as-is, and the current 2.7.2 a p2, we doing just that...  </s>

<s> Not really, Gregory, because Charles is arguing that you only get the stamp of approval if you do P1 _and_ P2 checkpoints.  </s>
<s> Which, frankly, is confusing and bothersome to me, and I think that Charles needs to propose merging P1 and P2 if that's what he really wants done.  </s>
<s> Which is as much a skewing of the multi-tiered priority system as proposing only 2 priorities -- frankly, I think that may be a better idea, or possibly requiring compliance with ALL priorities (P1, P2) and offering lesser-ranked priorities (P3) as techniques under a more broad "principle-based" checkpoint.  </s>
<s> PRACTICAL EXAMPLE: We have only one P3 currently in section 2. The rest all are P1 and P2 which Charles would like to see as mandatory, minimum compliance items.  </s>
<s> Checkpoint 2.3.4 is the only "optional" P3 under this scheme: "Provide a mechanism to manage alternative content for multimedia objects, which retains and offers for editing pre-written or previously linked alternative content."  </s>
<s> This could easily be a technique for 2.3.3 and/or 2.3.5, or a more general P1/P2 checkpoint: "Allow authors to easily manage alternative content" With the technique being a specific example of how to implement that.  </s>
<s> Once you've dealt with 2.3.4, we don't _have_ P3s anymore, and with P2s being the baseline for conformance, all checkpoints are now equal.  </s>
<s> Ta da, I have now proven that checkpoint priorities are meaningless.  </s>

<s> I am not convinced that we condone it.  </s>
<s> We say the following: P1 items are basic requirements.  </s>
<s> If you don't do them, your tool cannot be used by certain people, or your tool cannot be used to produce accessible web content.  </s>
<s> Which is a polite and technical way of saying we think your tool should not be allowed out on its own.  </s>
<s> and furthermore, if you do fulfil p1 requirements, but not P2 requirements, there are significant barriers to poeple using your tool, or using it to make accessible content, or both.  </s>
<s> Which is to say that it is possible to use your tool to make the world better, but I wouldn't recommend it.  </s>
<s> And if you fulfil P1 and P2 but not P3 then people will be able to use your tool, but you could make life better.  </s>
<s> Which is to say that this is a pretty acceptable level - when your 2-person open-source startup gets a tool to meet this standard it deserves to be taken seriously.  </s>
<s> And if you fulfil P3 then you actually have a good tool on your hands, which we can heartily recommend to all and sundry as being superbly built to enable accessibility.  </s>
<s> This document is a technical activity, and we are obliged to look at the world as it is.  </s>
<s> I would rather manufacturers fixed all the P1 problems than fixed some of them and all the P2s.  </s>
<s> I would not personally be interested in recommending a product that did not meet all P1 and P2 requirements except as the best of a bad bunch, in which case a product which met all P1s would win out over one which did not meet one or more of them, however many P2 requirements it met.  </s>
