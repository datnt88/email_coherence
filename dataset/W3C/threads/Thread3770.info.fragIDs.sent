<s> Hi all, After about a month with Dom and myself more-or-less away from (regular) business, we're finally back.  </s>
<s> This may be a good time to review our plans for (the beginning of) this year.  </s>
<s> A few questions that may be worth discussing: - Any (technical/logistical) help needed?  </s>
<s> Anything not going quite as good as it should?  </s>
<s> - Development plans (I am yet to test the newest stuff, esp. the XML validator)?  </s>
<s> - Hos is the Dev Team going?  </s>
<s> Too small?  </s>
<s> Should we invite other people in?  </s>
<s> - Release plans (validator's 0.6.2, publicizing the LogValidator - through a beta2 release- , others?)  </s>
<s> I am yet to catch up on everything that has happened during the past weeks, so if I say something irrelevant, please don't hesitate to tell me.  </s>
<s> Thanks, I wish you all best for this year.  </s>

<s> To the "others" category; I'm planning to try out Xerces-J's HTML validation capabilities sometime, just for fun, and possibly combined with JavaScript parsing with Mozilla's Rhino.  </s>
<s> And maybe CSS with the CSS-validator/SAC/flute code...  </s>
<s> \/ille Skytt?  </s>

<s> Ville,  </s>
<s> Looks interesting.  </s>
<s> FYI, there's a new release of the CSS validator coming soon, I've been told.  </s>
