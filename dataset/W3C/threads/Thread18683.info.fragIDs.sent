<s> Here is a list of information requirements that I believe need to be met to  </s>
<s> implement an AT like Home Page Reader: 1.  </s>
<s> For each element (DOM node) as well as at the page and frame level, be able to:  </s>
<s> - Retrieve and change all content - Retrieve and change all attribute information - Receive event notifications and all related information: - For all mouse events and their character and pixel location - For all keys pressed and all their information, like is it from the numpad - For all changes to any content or states/attributes - Others  </s>
<s> - Determine it's containing structure (form, table, frame, page, etc)  </s>
<s> - Simulate events on every element even if not a link or control-type element (left or right mouse click, mouseover, set focus, etc) 2. For each character on a web page, be able to: - Retrieve and change the actual presentation attributes as displayed - Determine where it is in the document (DOM node and character offset) as well as pixel location - Simulate an event even if not in a link or control-type element (left or right mouse click) - Receive event notifications for all mouse click and keyboard events  </s>
<s> 3. Ability to find the process/window for and place keyboard focus on an embedded object or applet.  </s>
<s> 4. The information and events from the APIs and DOMs must reflect the web document displayed (i.e. both must include error correction or not). 5. Ability to select/highlight text, controls, and images at character offsets programmatically like you can select with a mouse.  </s>

<s> Can you define containing structure?  </s>
<s> Does this mean: * The element whose semantics is to group a number of descendant elements?  </s>
<s> * The rendering of an element that, in two dimensions, encloses some other content?  </s>
<s> In short: can this be determined from the markup language alone?  </s>
<s> [snip]  </s>
<s> The binding between process and window is something that is likely done at the OS level.  </s>
<s> In UAAG 1.0, we talk about "viewports".  </s>
<s> UAAG 1.0 doesn't require any particular type of selection; it can be text-only or text-and-images, etc.  </s>
<s> Our requirement is that, whatever the selection encompasses, that information be available through the API.  </s>

<s> In short: can this be determined from the markup language alone?  </s>
<s> CKL: What I mean is that an AT should be able to always determine from the DOM (or an accessibility API), that an particular element is within the bounds of another element.  </s>
<s> I am most interested in elements that are within a particular form, table, select menu, map, or list.  </s>
<s> All of these "containers" have beginning and ending tags in HTML, so the DOM is usually pretty accurate.  </s>
<s> However, if any elements are missing end tags within a form, for example, the IE DOM will be incorrect and show that there are no elements in the form.  </s>
<s> I am less interested in thinking of containers that have no ending tags, like headings as implied containers for sections, although an AT should be able to determine this type of container by the order of elements in the DOM.  </s>
<s> [snip]  </s>
<s> The binding between process and window is something that is likely done at the OS level.  </s>
<s> In UAAG 1.0, we talk about "viewports".  </s>
<s> CKL: Yes, we can use the OS level to do this, but I was just pointing out that this is not possible to do using the DOM interface but something this is necessary to do as a web access AT.  </s>
<s> UAAG 1.0 doesn't require any particular type of selection; it can be text-only or text-and-images, etc.  </s>
<s> Our requirement is that, whatever the selection encompasses, that information be available through the API.  </s>
<s> CKL: I think we can get what the selection encompasses from the IE DOM assuming that a blind user could select a portion of text using the keyboard, but we cannot use the IE DOM APIs to select both text and images (and controls) using an API.  </s>
<s> That is, there is an API for doing a SetTextRange but not doing a set range that also includes images and controls.  </s>
