An article describing their goals, focusing on uniform browser implementation of CSS &amp; other standards is available at: Patrick Here is the text of the article: August 06, 1998 Web Designers Protest Microsoft and Netscape Standards Rift By Alex Lash A group of high?profile 
Web designers is forming a coalition to protest the differing standards between Microsoft's and Netscape's browsers. 
"We're in danger of getting to the point where the Web is made of fragments, with one browser supporting one fragment and the other browser supporting another, and with no middle ground," says Glenn Davis, spokesman for the Web Standards Project. 
WSP members hope that grassroots developer pressure will influence Microsoft and Netscape as the companies work on their fifth?generation 
browsers. 
In the past, both companies have added nonstandard technologies without waiting for approval from the Web standards overseer, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). 
Sometimes that approval never materializes, as with Netscape's HTML "layer tag," or Microsoft's Windows?only Active X. 
However, Davis says that between the companies' 4.0 browsers, Microsoft Internet Explorer is closer to full support of most Web standards, while Netscape's lack of support for the cascading stylesheets standard, which enables designers to display and rearrange information dynamically within the browser, is a major concern. 
The debate over diverging browser standards has in part been sparked by Microsoft's decision to merge its browser into the dominant Windows operating system. 
By developing sites for Internet Explorer, Web designers know that millions of Windows users will be assured of accessing those sites. 
But Netscape's Navigator remains the more popular browser by a slim margin, and developers are hesitant to throw their lot into only one camp, thus inflating the cost of Web development. 
Davis, who runs Web?design firm Project Cool (www.projectcool.com), 
estimates it costs 25 percent more to develop a cutting?edge 
site that can be fully accessed by both browsers. 
Microsoft product manager Mike Nichols said the company is committed to leading support in all industry standards and technologies and will continue to do so with IE 5.0. 
Netscape was not immediately available for comment. 
Microsoft has released a developer?only 
beta of IE 5.0, while Netscape is counting on its decision to free its browser source code to spur innovation for Navigator 5.0. 
The Web Standards Project is also concerned with future browsers that will run on non?PC devices, such as palmtops and Web phones. 
"Lack of standards support is going to hurt that development," said Davis. 
Other members of the Web Standards Project include Martin Diekhoff of the Getty Information Institute(www.gii.getty.edu), 
Ann Navarro of Webgeek Communications (www.webgeek.com), 
Roger Black of Interactive Bureau (www.iab.com), and John Shiple of Squishy Designs (www.squishy.com). 
The group's Web site (www.webstandards.org) will be live on Monday.

University of California Los Angeles Disabilities &amp; Computing Program Analyzing Usability Since 1994 [David Poehlman] Both one of their founding members and one of their designers have said that it isn't possible to get good design in all browsers and still be standards-compliant. 
The founding member in question also said that any assertions otherwise were "horseshit". 
I encourage you to contact the WSP if you disagree.

How petty is it of me to notice that nearly all of the sites linked to from http://www.webstandards.org/members.html 
member bios don't pass validation according to http://validator.w3.org/? 
I shudder to think of what Bobby would make of 'em. 
Part of the message that WSP is trying to get across, is that the demands of design sometimes require implementations that don't validate: in part, because of inconsistent support of the standards in the major browsers. 
IOW, to make a design present consistently, what otherwise might be seen as "bad habits" and "invalid HTML" may need to be used. 
WSP is not about "validation before anything else." 
It is about educating those responsible for producing user agents that the divergence in support for the standards results in developers jumping through hoops that cost the entire web community a significant investment of time and money. 
If all browsers fully supported the standards, there'd be more to the fact that some of these sites don't validate. 
Regarding this specific post: While a founding member, Steve's time with WSP was limited when it came time for the steering committee to form so he wasn't privy to the SC's plans to incorporate full HTML4 complience into the website based upon the draft site created with current tools. 
He was, present, however in the beginning discussion when WSP was forming in which we were all lamenting the fact of just how difficult building websites were without breaking the standards that we should all be able to use and it's quite easy to see how his personal opinion may have grown from those discussions. 
And finally, the site was scheduled for launch tomorrow. 
I suggest anyone with concerns about the validation behavior of the site check back in after official launch time.

(Tooting my own horn: www.hwg.org, linked to from Ann's bio, does pass validation and Bobby, as does www.cgu.edu, the Claremont Graduate University homepage (but not the rest of the site), and www.idyllmtn.com 
(although the accessibility of that page is seriously doubtful, regardless of what Bobby may think...)) Kynn Bartlett kynn@hwg.org

Interesting. 
Why do these people claim to support existing standards but put such little value in, well, the existing standards? 
The agenda is puzzling. 
What _are_ they after, besides more attention for their own group, which seems to exist to, well, draw attention to their group? 
Anyway, this is not the list for talking about WSP anyway, and I'm sure they're just going to redirect me to /dev/null for pointing out hypocrisy, so I'll drop it. 
Kynn Bartlett kynn@hwg.org 
Vice President, Marketing and Outreach, HTML Writers Guild Okay, so the WSP suggests that web authors ignore the published vendor-neutral standards, and instead use specifics hacks just to get around problems in implementation? 
No, I didn't say that. 
I said that inconsistent implementations of those vendor-neutral standards, proffered by a body that many of the user-agent publishers belong to, cause significant extra development effort that costs an enormous amount of time and money. 
and what exactly is WSP planning to do to make this happen? 
The web site gives solid information on what the group is about. 
It does not have "we plan to contact Mr. Jones, at Company X, and tell him Y." To expect that is unrealistic. 
The steering committee has influential contacts at the companies we wish to form a dialog with, and intends to use those to get our message across. 
I know, I know, it'll be on the website tomorrow. 
Hopefully I'll find something that makes me think this isn't just another case of "form an official sounding organization because it makes us look more impressive, despite not having any way to accomplish the goals we've for ourselves." 
That statement assumes much, including "not having any way to accomplish..." As a supporter of WAI, I find it puzzling that you would deride an effort that could result in more developers embracing CSS and other techniques that lend themselves to more accessible web sites, should those standards be fully and consistently implemented in browsers. 
Any further constructive commentary on the group's activities is welcome on it's mailing list, info available from the site.

(I used a pseudo-hack on www.hwg.org's stylesheets, because Netscape's support for CSS is ... less than robust. 
However, there's nothing invalid about it, it simply is designed to degrade gracefully.) Isn't it rather condescending to assume that browser authors -- mainly you're talking about Netscape and Microsoft, right? 
with a little attention to Lynx, Opera, and whatever else? -- need to be "educated"? 
Is a whole organization necessary to reach these people, and what exactly is WSP planning to do to make this happen?

KB In article 199808100139.VAA18415@ruby.ora.com , Chris Maden crism@oreilly.com writes That's not quite the way I read it: in URL:http://www.lists.ic.ac.uk/hy permail/xml-dev/9808/0289.html at least, the "horseshit" applies to the assertion that "any org promoting standards compliance should stick to the standards", and goes on to say "If the standards were implemented correctly, you could" [stick to them]. 
Of course, the issue is clouded by legacy issues of backwards compatibility; but nevertheless this seems, to me at least, be the crux of the matter - as has been debated for literally *years* on newsgroups like ciwah. 
One of my biggest problems, as a web author, is that of attempting to create a standards-based product in a field in which there *are* no standards: and knowing that the body which is the closest there is to an international standards authority (*without being one*) is tied so closely with, if not outright controlled by, major organisations who continually demonstrate their contempt for any formal standards process. 
Thus although every page we author bears a link to what used to be the "Kinder Gentler Validator" (and is now the W3C's own HTML validator), I can sympathise entirely with the web author who defies validation in pursuit of accessibility (I have no sympathy at all with those who would use the accessibility issue an excuse for non-validation). 
As far as I can see, the more voices we have raised in favour of promoting standards, the better.
