Hi Folks, I'm running into something that I could use some help with. 
I'm trying to rename a collection and am receiving a 502 Bad Gateway. 
It appears that if I use the hostname in the Destination header, ie, webfolders.mydocsonline.com:80, then all goes well. 
However, if I resolve it to its IP address and use that instead, 38.144.45.187:80, then the command fails. 
Oh, the collection is empty in case that matters. 
Should the hostname and IP address be interchangable, or am I required to always use the hostname as part of the Destination header. 
Below are copies of the working and non-working MOVE request. 
Thanks in advance!

As Keith implied, in the Xythos implementation we only treat the host name and IP address as identical if the administrator sets them up this way. 
lisa Hi, You should be using the hostname if you know it. 
If your client is given a hostname, then resolves it to the IP address, and uses that IP address the Host header, that defeats the whole point of having the Host header in the first place: name-based virtual hosting. 
Consider that a serious client bug. 
:) If your client is only told the IP address by the user, then I think you're stuck, unless you do a reverse DNS lookup, which might not be a good idea anyway. 
Apache/mod_dav won't like an IP address in the Destination header in the default configuration[*], and MOVE/COPY will return 502. 
Regards, joe [*] though it can be configured to know the IP address with the ServerAlias directive
