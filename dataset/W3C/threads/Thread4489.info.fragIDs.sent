<s> Mary, In [1], you submitted the following comment on the Last Call Working Draft of XSLT 2.0 and XQuery 1.0 Serialization on behalf of the XML Schema Working Group:  </s>
<s> [C] [Section 2: Serializing Arbitrary Data Models] Saying the process  </s>
<s> fails  </s>
<s> for sequences containing xs:QName or xs:NOTATION nodes seems unhelpful.  </s>
<s> What  </s>
<s> happens if I have such a sequence?  </s>
<s> This appears to be a serialization  </s>
<s> error  </s>
<s> because processor is unable to cast an atomic value to string.  </s>
<s> Suggestion:  </s>
<s> replace 'process will fail' statement with 'serialization error'.  </s>
<s> Thanks to you and the working group for this comment.  </s>
<s> The XSL and XML Query Working Groups discussed the comment, and agreed that the description should indicate that this is a serialization error.  </s>
<s> In fact, the second and sixth items in the numbered list in Section 2 already normatively indicate that fact.  </s>
<s> For clarity, the note in Section 2 will be changed to use the term "serialization error" as well.  </s>
<s> As that is the change the XML Schema Working Group recommended, I trust it will be acceptable.  </s>
<s> May I ask you to confirm that the working group finds the response acceptable?  </s>

<s> We find the clarification as a serialization error an improvement and accept that.  </s>
<s> We continue to be deeply troubled, however, by the fact that data models with xs:QNames fail to serialize and therefore validate correctly.  </s>
<s> We are heartened by our knowledge that the Query/XSL Working groups have continued to discuss that matter, and encourage them in that effort.  </s>

<s> I think we need to work together to find a solution to the QName problem.  </s>
<s> It's wretchedly difficult having a data type where the value in the value space has no context-independent lexical representation.  </s>
<s> Adding the possibility of representing QName values in a lexical notation such as uri##local would greatly ease the pain.  </s>
<s> (We choose choose a format that can potentially be used anywhere in XML, XML Schema, XSLT, XPath, or XQuery that lexical QNames are currently used).  </s>
