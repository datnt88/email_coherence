There is a very innovative of use of symbols on the following site. 
www.signbrowser.demon.co.uk 
Also I think you could check out the widgit site www.widgit.com 
Dusty' Home page here photos are used as bookmarks/links. 
The photo bookmarks act as visual reminders to the user who has difficulty in reading returning to their favourite pages. 
Meldreth Manor School www.rmplc.co.uk/eduweb/sites/meldreth use a combination of large print and speaking by symbols. 
One curious thing here is that these web sites are accessible to people with learning or cognitive disabilities but probably not accessible under the w3org guidelines. 
A bit of a dichotomy I think Eamonn Quinn to follow up on what Mencap in N.I. 
said: We had a thread like this on webwatch-l. 
The PA guidelines group thinks that they have avoided a _dichotomy_. 
That is to say, you don't have to violate the guidelines to make pages friendly to people with learning or cognitive disabilities. 
You can even make the LD-friendly presentation the default presentation and lay in the left-brain stuff behind the scenes in ALT etc. fields. 
But it would be a very interesting test of this claim to work with the pages Eamonn cites to demonstrate that universal pages are possible. 
Al I looked over them. 
They are very nice, and they do comply with the guidelines in large part. 
The Duttons' pages are short a few alt-tags. 
The Meldreth school has a very incomplete navigation system, and some of the alt-tags could possibly be improved a bit, but generally it seems accessible, if slightly confusing to me.
