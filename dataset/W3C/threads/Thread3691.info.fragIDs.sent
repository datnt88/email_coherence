Do we want to shorten the C "Heisei (Non-Normative)" section? 
I don't see the point of including the detailed explanations. 
I originally sent it out just for your information, but didn't really expect the whole piece to be included in the doc. 
A suggested version is as follows: Imperial Calendar is commonly used in Japan. 
Heisei is the current era, and it started on January 8th, 1989. 
Year 2002 is Year Heisei 14. 
Showa is the previous era ended on January 7th, 1989 or Showa 64. -takao 
Hello Takao, I thought about the same a few days ago, but forgot to bring it up yesterday. 
I have shortened the appendix along your suggestions. 
If we need more details, we can always bring them back in. 
Regards, Martin. 
Yes, I agree, I didn't think it belonged in the spec, but felt at this point it didnt matter if it was included. 
Thanks for suggesting/offering to remove it. 
The material would make a good web page though. 
I might use it for my web site if you dont mind. 
It might be good to have it on the w3c i18n site along with some other date formats.
