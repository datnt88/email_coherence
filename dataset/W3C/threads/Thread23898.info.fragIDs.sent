<s> Perhaps with the OpenType Jamboree next week in Redmond there'll be some pressure to correct this quickly.  </s>
<s> With it public, they can't continue to ignore the problem until it's too late to correct it.  </s>
<s> 1. Yes they can, they're MS. They're good at ignoring pressure.  </s>
<s> There is FAR more pressure on them to pull their head out of their nether orifice on the Java issue and they haven't.  </s>
<s> I doubt the average user cares at all about this, many care about not being able to run valid Java applets under IE.  </s>
<s> 2. I don't agree that they need to fix anything.  </s>
<s> Now, my understanding is that if the bit were set correctly on the font in the first place, IE is no less secure than any other application using the same fonts.  </s>
<s> The issue is the fonts being downloadable as a distribution system and then being hijacked and kept.  </s>
<s> But if the font foundaries had set the bit correctly to start with it wouldn't be an issue.  </s>
<s> It looks to me like the foundaries made the mistake, and now you're whining that MS needs to bail them out but adding *another* level of control to supercede the one there now.  </s>
<s> Personally I hope they don't, and foundaries pay more attention to how they set things in the first place.  </s>

<s> And what about users who convert typefaces from PostScript to TrueType -- often within the bounds of their end-user license agreements -- but don't have the tools to set the embedding bit at all?  </s>

<s> Is this MS's fault?  </s>
<s> No. IE should not be treated any differently than anny other application.  </s>
<s> If they are allowed to converted from PostScript to TrueType and are not required to set the embedding bit.  </s>
<s> AND their license allows them to distribute the font online.  </s>
<s> Then that's too bad - that means the licensing agreement is too loose and the foundaries should tighten them up to work in the real world.  </s>

<s> I consider it fair.  </s>
<s> This is life on the Internet.  </s>
<s> The Internet has been around for a while now, and people have been emailing documents with included fonts for years.  </s>
<s> I started seeing Word documents with the fonts saved with the document online years ago.  </s>
<s> So it was obvious it was coming.  </s>
<s> That's just life.  </s>
<s> You don't invent a new system everytime a new use is created.  </s>
<s> You just accept it is too late to change the past and go forward with new knowledge.  </s>
<s> It happens to just about every sector of the computing industry connected with the Internet.  </s>
<s> HW vendors make decisions that later prevent them from supporting a new protocol so they lose sales.  </s>
<s> Or they invest in a new protocol that never catches on.  </s>
<s> Software vendors write things that end up being obsolete before they ship.  </s>
<s> Everyone gets burned at some point.  </s>
<s> There is no point in whining about it.  </s>
<s> The idea that fonts would be distributed on the web is NOT new.  </s>
<s> It has been discussed in various forums for years now.  </s>
<s> Anyone who didn't see it coming was blind.  </s>
<s> So I just don't feel sorry for anyone who claims they didn't have time to prepare.  </s>
<s> And I completely disagree with the notion that MS is somehow responsible for providing a new mechanism to control fonts.  </s>
<s> So what, in a few years when some new system that no one thought of today comes out we get to do it again?  </s>
<s> Live and learn, and just keep moving.  </s>
