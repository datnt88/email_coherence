Hi, 
what's the policy on use of JavaScript in validator or checklink? 
Is it a no-no or can it be used to enhance the UI? 
There are some useful little things like focusing a default form element when a page is loaded and preventing form submission if the URL field is empty etc, for which IMHO JavaScript could be used. 
Just a notice in advance, I think "application/x-javascript" should be used for the content type for javascript, instead of "text/javascript" (*not* registered), even though using the former makes MSIE 6 to ignore the scripts most of the time... \/ille Skytt?

That kind of enhancement is a permanent lurker on my todo list.

I'm not sure there's any such thing as a policy for this. 
My policy, if any, would be that if it's valid/standard and usable with any agent, there's no reason not to use it.

Like Nick, adding suitable little bits if JavaScript has been on my TODO for ages (and I've been bugging Jim Ley about adding some ;D). 
It obviously needs to be super-carefull not to make any stupid mistakes that might legitimize stuff like browser-sniffers to Joe R. Wubduhsigner, but even more, it would be nice to be able to act as a showcase for JavaScript __done_right__! 
IOW, Accessible and inclusionary JavaScript would be a big plus as far as I'm concerned... Everytime I write a rhyme these people thinks its a crime I tell `em what's on my mind. 
I guess I'm a CRIMINAL! 
I don't gotta say a word I just flip `em the bird and keep goin, I don't take shit from no one. 
I'm a CRIMINAL!
