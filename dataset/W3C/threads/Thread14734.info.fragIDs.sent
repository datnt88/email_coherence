<s> John's message is right on the mark.  </s>
<s> There are good reasons why RNIB recommends yellow text against a black background as the ultimate low-vision styling -- the one that will get to the people just short of where there is no know way.  </s>
<s> [If I recall correctly w.r.t.  </s>
<s> RNIB allegation] Here is the way I wrote it up just the other day for another person 4. Remember that the basic high contrast mode for text is light text on a dark background.  </s>
<s> In fact the conventional wisdom is yellow on black.  </s>
<s> Stick figures light on dark will preserve recognizability through more low pass filtering than will more equal light-dark areas with less border length.  </s>
<s> A plus sign is more different from a circular disk than is a solid hexagon or octagon.  </s>
<s> Think in terms of how far the light has to fuzz to blend indistinguishably into the fuzz it is meeting from the next light area.  </s>
<s> Light diffuses, dark doesn't.  </s>
<s> One of the factors or interface transformations you should be thinking about is "at what point does the interface go through a light-dark inversion phase boundary" between dark on light and light on dark.  </s>
<s> You won't want to deny light on dark to those who need it and you won't want to burden those who don't need it with this mode.  </s>
<s> And it's a discrete leap, not something that happens continuously.  </s>

<s> Al, You make a very interesting point although the remainder of you comments seem to contradict the single point that stands out so heavily.  </s>
<s> "Light diffuses, dark doesn't."  </s>
<s> If light diffuses then that would mean that it is harder to read against a dark background that doesn't diffuse.  </s>
<s> The light simply gets squished, like the article from Microsoft stated, when it is placed on a dark background.  </s>
<s> However, you did make one point that will stand forever.  </s>
<s> "You won't want to deny light on dark to those who need it and you won't want to burden those who don't need it with this mode."  </s>
<s> The question is how do we do that.  </s>
<s> As everyone has been pointing out ZoomEyes and the other programs have the capability to show the page in reversed colors.  </s>
<s> At least that is what I have come to understand.  </s>

<s> And it's a discrete leap, not something that happens continuously.  </s>
<s> I agree with Lee, Al, and John, that people need the choice because there are different situtations.  </s>
<s> But I thought I would try to tackle the point below.  </s>
<s> In a light-on-dark screen, where there is a large diffusion effect, the letters will "bleed over".  </s>
<s> So it becomes hard to distinguish a circle from an octagon.  </s>
<s> In dark-on-light the light background bleeds over the dark characters, to the point that it can make them almost disappear.  </s>
<s> When computers were often used with poor-quality televisions or monitors for screens light-on-dark was by far the preferred mode, because it was much easier to read.  </s>
<s> The changeover tended to come with quality screens and window systems - in the early 80s with the Macintosh, the 90s with windows, and even today many people who use unix or DOS command-line systems work in light-on-dark.  </s>
<s> As well as better quality screens makng it easier to read, there is the impact of the light on the eyes to consider.  </s>
<s> Backlit LCD or "normal" CRT monitors are bombarding the eyes with light in a dark-on-light setup, less so the other way around, although there is a higher effective contrast (a little bit of light stands out in the dark.  </s>
<s> A little bit of dark is masked by the presence of so much light).  </s>
<s> Each can lead to different kinds of "afterburn" - the effect that comes from staring at the sun too long.  </s>
<s> (And if you do use a screen a lot, go outside on a dark night and look at the ground.  </s>
<s> Those little glowing worms and bugs aren't there - they are burnspots in your eyeball...) Chaals Al, You make a very interesting point although the remainder of you comments seem to contradict the single point that stands out so heavily.  </s>
<s> "Light diffuses, dark doesn't."  </s>
