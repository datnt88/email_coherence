I meant to send this to the list yesterday and not just to Lee, but evidently hit 'Reply' instead of 'Reply-all'. 
==Message begins== Lee, thanks for the Microsoft reference. 
I assume that the snippet below is what you're referring to as grounds for the statement that text should always be darker than the background: "It is clear to everybody that black text on a white background is extremely easy to see, which is part of the reason why most of the printed material you read is black text on a white background. 
Likewise, white on black produces high contrast, but it is more difficult to read because black is perceived as being heavier than white and, thus, squeezes it out a little. 
" I'm sure this is true for most people, especially those with so-called normal vision. 
I am equally certain, however, that *some* people with limited vision find it far easier to read light text against a dark background. 
If for example you look at CCTV (closed circuit TV) systems that display magnified images of print material on computer and/or TV screens, you'll find that many of them have switches that allow users to choose between dark on light and light on dark, as well as choosing different color combinations. 
The same is true for many software based screen magnifiers such as AI Squared's ZoomText. 
And Kara Pernice Coyne and Jakob Nielsen report in _Beyond ALT Text_ (Nielsen-Norman Group, 2001) that users with low vision often switched back and forth between "normal" and "inverted" video (i.e., between dark on light and light on dark) to ease eyestrain and fatigue. 
I used to do that when I could still see enough for ZoomText and CCTV to be worth the trouble. 
And I used to use MS Word's settings to display white text on a blude background-- the option was there to ensnare Word Perfect users for whom those were the default colors, but it was good for me, too. 
I finally had to stop because JAWS couldn't handle it any more.... 
So perhaps the success critierion should involve giving users the ability to choose between light on dark and dark on light, and to make that choice readily available rather than a one-shot deal. 
Sorry for length of message.

John's message is right on the mark. 
There are good reasons why RNIB recommends yellow text against a black background as the ultimate low-vision styling -- the one that will get to the people just short of where there is no know way. 
[If I recall correctly w.r.t. 
RNIB allegation] Here is the way I wrote it up just the other day for another person 4. Remember that the basic high contrast mode for text is light text on a dark background. 
In fact the conventional wisdom is yellow on black. 
Stick figures light on dark will preserve recognizability through more low pass filtering than will more equal light-dark areas with less border length. 
A plus sign is more different from a circular disk than is a solid hexagon or octagon. 
Think in terms of how far the light has to fuzz to blend indistinguishably into the fuzz it is meeting from the next light area. 
Light diffuses, dark doesn't. 
One of the factors or interface transformations you should be thinking about is "at what point does the interface go through a light-dark inversion phase boundary" between dark on light and light on dark. 
You won't want to deny light on dark to those who need it and you won't want to burden those who don't need it with this mode. 
And it's a discrete leap, not something that happens continuously.

Al, You make a very interesting point although the remainder of you comments seem to contradict the single point that stands out so heavily. 
"Light diffuses, dark doesn't." 
If light diffuses then that would mean that it is harder to read against a dark background that doesn't diffuse. 
The light simply gets squished, like the article from Microsoft stated, when it is placed on a dark background. 
However, you did make one point that will stand forever. 
"You won't want to deny light on dark to those who need it and you won't want to burden those who don't need it with this mode." 
The question is how do we do that. 
As everyone has been pointing out ZoomEyes and the other programs have the capability to show the page in reversed colors. 
At least that is what I have come to understand. 
Thanks, Lee 4. Remember that the basic high contrast mode for text is light text on a dark background.

And it's a discrete leap, not something that happens continuously. 
I agree with Lee, Al, and John, that people need the choice because there are different situtations. 
But I thought I would try to tackle the point below. 
In a light-on-dark screen, where there is a large diffusion effect, the letters will "bleed over". 
So it becomes hard to distinguish a circle from an octagon. 
In dark-on-light the light background bleeds over the dark characters, to the point that it can make them almost disappear. 
When computers were often used with poor-quality televisions or monitors for screens light-on-dark was by far the preferred mode, because it was much easier to read. 
The changeover tended to come with quality screens and window systems - in the early 80s with the Macintosh, the 90s with windows, and even today many people who use unix or DOS command-line systems work in light-on-dark. 
As well as better quality screens makng it easier to read, there is the impact of the light on the eyes to consider. 
Backlit LCD or "normal" CRT monitors are bombarding the eyes with light in a dark-on-light setup, less so the other way around, although there is a higher effective contrast (a little bit of light stands out in the dark. 
A little bit of dark is masked by the presence of so much light). 
Each can lead to different kinds of "afterburn" - the effect that comes from staring at the sun too long. 
(And if you do use a screen a lot, go outside on a dark night and look at the ground. 
Those little glowing worms and bugs aren't there - they are burnspots in your eyeball...) Chaals Al, You make a very interesting point although the remainder of you comments seem to contradict the single point that stands out so heavily.
