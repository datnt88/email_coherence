<s> Hi Jim,  </s>
<s> Thanks for taking the time to comment.  </s>
<s> Can you say more on what you think would be expensive to implement?  </s>
<s> Jon and I reviewed existing APIs and both MSAA and Java APIs (and probably others) cover the indicated requirements.  </s>
<s> In what way would the end user have  </s>
<s> to provide information?  </s>
<s> The user agent ultimately determines the  </s>
<s> choice of font families, for example, after taking into account author preferences, user preferences (in the UA and the Operating Environment), and available font families (and probably other factors as well).  </s>
<s> Please expand on your scenario.  </s>

<s> I'm not thinking of the user, the scenario I was imagining is where I use a number of other software components to create a more accessible browser, so for example I may use Batik to render SVG elements in the page, if Batik doesn't make exact locations available to my tool, I can't meet the requirement.  </s>
<s> So the fear I have is that we'll only be able to use components which do provide the exact location information.  </s>
<s> I guess I think of a UA as a series of components tht plug together, and I often think of the final renderer not necessarily doing exactly what it's told (it may be a few pixels out, or substitute fonts itself.)  </s>
<s> I'm also not sure what would happen where an element has text content which is rendered in a number of fonts - if a font does not contain a particular character, it's reasonable to substitute the font from that character with a font which does, but you'd not substitute the others - so we now have an element where 2 fonts are used - what would be returned in this scenario?  </s>

<s> Jim, This requirement was put in because the needs of AT developers to know what is on the screen.  </s>
<s> They identified that the source as represented by the DOM does not always represent what is rendered on the screen.  </s>
<s> This is due in large part because the HTML is not valid and the DOM and rendering engines use different repair strategies.  </s>
<s> In the use case you describe this also would seem to be an issue as none of the tools knows the exact rendering.  </s>
<s> In this case it would the a requirement of the final rendering system to make available what actually was rendered.  </s>
