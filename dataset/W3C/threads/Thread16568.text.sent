Dear Paul and all: First of all, our list is NEVER meant to be publicly available.

Our objective is to present to the Spanish parliament and other regulatories bodies a petition to pass a law similar to section 508 in the States. 
Portugal carried out a similar initiative with success a few months ago. 
Furthermore, we represent SIDAR, which is an organism part of the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs to further ensure your privacy and avoid any attempt to make commercial use of the collected data. 
We open our petition internationally because such petitions have a better chance to influence politicians when it is shown an international support for the petition. 
I hope this explanation will eliminate any doubts.

Dear all, I request you to give the maximum diffusion possible to the following information: Campaign of Collection of Signatures Accessible Internet for ALL Starting from September 4 2000, it starts the campaign of collection of signatures for an accessible Internet for ALL............................................... Well call me cynical, call me cruel, call me nasty, whilst I openly support all action to promote accessibility, this would produce a ready made active email list that any software producing company would die for, correction, kill for. 
And you wish to publish this? 
I get very few spams on a weekly basis, and even they are too many, I get a strong feeling that these would increase once your list was made public. 
Have you thought this through?................err.........if not....(can I have the UK marketing rights?) cheesy shark like grin Paul Davis www.ten-20.com
