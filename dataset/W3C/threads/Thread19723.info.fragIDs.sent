Is there setup information for Amaya under Windows? 
The readme files only 
refer to Unix type installations. 
By looking at the Thot.ini file I was able to guess that setting the "THOTDIR" and "HOME" environment variables would make it work, which it did.

No particular setup. 
- Unzip amaya-WindowsNT-1.1a.ZIP - execute Thot\WINNT\bin OR Thot\WIN95\bin

OK, I thought there might have been something needed. 
Otherwise I was going to start experimenting anyway.
