<s> Greetings, I've recently been experimenting with creating mathematical text for the web using MathML and Amaya and I thought it would be a good idea to pass along some comments in the hope that the W3C can use them to improve the quality of the MathML specification and the Amaya program.  </s>
<s> Please feel free to pass these comments to the appropriate party if I am addressing the wrong person.  </s>
<s> First let me say that I truly appreciate the work that the W3C has done in this area.  </s>
<s> I've read some the the mathematical text on the web that does not use MathML and, from what I've seen, the results are far from satisfactory for reasons I'm sure you can list as well as I can.  </s>
<s> My first attempt at creating the attached document was using Amaya as an  </s>
<s> editor.  </s>
<s> I found this somewhat awkward and confusing.  </s>
<s> The most serious problem I encountered was that if I closed the Amaya window with unsaved changes in the editor, I could not cancel this action without the program crashing.  </s>
<s> Fortunately, my work was restored when I restarted the  </s>
<s> program again.  </s>
<s> Even without the program crashing, the way this works is non-standard, at least in the Windows world.  </s>
<s> Most Windows programs in this situation give the user three options: Yes - Save and exit.  </s>
<s> No - Exit but don't save, and Cancel - Don't exit.  </s>
<s> Another problem I  </s>
<s> encountered was in adding and deleting MathML operators.  </s>
<s> When I tried to add some operators the program would insert an additional character which was rendered as a black rectangle, and I couldn't seem to delete  </s>
<s> some operators once they were added.  </s>
<s> Finally, the file output from the program did not use the CR/LF sequence for line breaks that is standard in Windows.  </s>
<s> This made it difficult to open the file in a text editor.  </s>
<s> (For debugging purposes, I was using v3.2, July 4, 2000, on a Windows 98 platform) Amaya did render MathML correctly with the following exception, when I tried to use the &amp;LeftAngleBracket; operator, it was rendered as a '?'.  </s>
<s> I used &amp;langle; instead, though this operator does not seem to be documented in the specification.  </s>
<s> There were a couple of small formatting issues as well.  </s>
<s> First, I noticed that when a line started with either a '(' or a '[', the start of the line was not flush with the other text.  </s>
<s> Second, when I used the ':' operator, there was no space between the ':' and the next character as would be expected.  </s>
<s> Lastly, though I realize that the MathML specification is not intended to be a tutorial or a beginner's guide, I would like to suggest that a few links to complete pages that use MathML would be extremely helpful.  </s>
<s> I eventually found some very useful examples at mathematical notations on http://hutchinson.belmont.ma.us/tth/mmlreview/ but I didn't think this was useful as an example because it is implemented using complex tables and not with MathML proper.  </s>
<s> Feel free to use the attached file in whatever way you see fit, though I won't make any claims as to the quality of the mathematical content.  </s>
<s> If you have any suggestions as to how the document can be changed to conform better with the MathML standard I would appreciate your sending them to me.  </s>
<s> Also, I apologize in advance if any of the problems listed above are due to my own ignorance or incompetence.  </s>
<s> Rich, I do some mathml and html math.  </s>
<s> I use different software to generate the mathml.  </s>
<s> Here is my web page.  </s>
<s> The Math stuff is in the middle of the first page.  </s>

<s> We tested some Math edition on Windows and Unix and didn't have this problem.  </s>
<s> Do you remember the scenario that caused that trouble.  </s>
<s> The Amaya dialogue seems clear: Save the document XXX before closing it Save document - Close don't save - Cancel  </s>
<s> I guess it's an empty element which is rendered just to be selected by the end user.  </s>
<s> Do you know a program that is not able to read files generated by Amaya?  </s>
<s> All Windows editors I tested are able to read files generated by Amaya.  </s>
<s> When Amaya cannot access a special character it renders as a '?'.  </s>
<s> I guess this problem is fixed now.  </s>
<s> This implies the analyze of the contents of the mathematical expression.  </s>
