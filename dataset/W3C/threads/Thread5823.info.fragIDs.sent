<s> Owl-lite struck me as not such a good idea.  </s>
<s> Not sure about the name especially.  </s>
<s> Maybe change owl-lite to owl 1.0 and owl to owl 2.0 beta.  </s>
<s> Overall I think the goal is to use owl and have owl-lite as a stepping stone for tool developers/user communities.  </s>
<s> "Lite" to me implies a choice of  </s>
<s> necessary features rather than a stepping stone.  </s>
<s> Owl version 1.0 would imply eventual movement to higher conformance.  </s>
<s> The use of Individual for "objects that belong to classes" while semantically correct leads very easily to confusion with its definition pertaining particularly to people.  </s>
<s> The confusion is further reinforced by the use of people in the examples in the Feature Synopsis.  </s>
<s> I favor the use of the word "Object" but other potential words to use instead of Individual are: Item, Thing, Entity, Occurrence, Singleton, Solitare.  </s>
<s> In the Feature Synopsis under the individual description.  </s>
<s> A statement says to see the reference description document for the exact syntax for defining individuals.  </s>
<s> This statement should apply to the exact syntax for all owl syntax and should be generalized and moved to a more appropriate location.  </s>

<s> If Ontology A only wishes to use term T from Ontology B does Ontology A have to import Ontology B. What if Ontology B also contains terms that conflict with Ontology A or the author of Ontology A does not agree with?  </s>

<s> A very good point.  </s>
<s> I'm going to bring this up for consideration by the Working Group.  </s>
<s> Yes, in some sense.  </s>
<s> Section 6 was added later.  </s>
<s> I've revised the paragraph to claim no ``definition'' of the exchange syntax.  </s>
<s> Agreed, but order is difficult to incorporate, particularly as RDF is essentially unordered.  </s>
<s> The issue does remain as an issue for the working group.  </s>
<s> OK, I'll make these changes.  </s>
<s> :-) Good reading, by the way.  </s>
<s> This used to be true, but the document was reordered a bit.  </s>
<s> Thanks for noticing.  </s>
<s> Another good catch.  </s>
<s> This is partly by design, as the full conditions on when a property can be transitive are mentioned in the next paragraph.  </s>
<s> The ``or'' in the wording does not mean ``at most one of''.  </s>
<s> However, I found a better way of saying the same thing, which happens to match the axiom better.  </s>
<s> It is possible to state minCardinality=5 maxCardinality=4.  </s>
<s> There will be no instances of the restriction but this is not an error.  </s>
<s> It doesn't help to rule this out syntactically.  </s>
<s> Maximum cardinality of 0 even more acceptable, as all it is stating is that instances of the restriction have no values for the property.  </s>
<s> This is needed for definitions like bachelor, a man with no wife.  </s>
<s> Actually 5.3.3 should be 5.2.3.  </s>
<s> Yes, this was an oversight as the name was changed some time ago.  </s>
<s> I can see and agree with the rationale of allowing me to specify properties  </s>
<s> with no values.  </s>
<s> My uneasiness should have been better expressed as, "Why the positive-integer restriction of minCardinality?".  </s>
<s> Maybe what is missing is more description of the rational on the cardinality  </s>
<s> definitions in the document both under OWL and OWL-LITE.  </s>
<s> 5.1.2 does not seem to allow for minCardinality 0 | maxCardinality 0 | minCardinality 1 maxCadinality 0. If this is correct I think it should be spelled out in the text of the abstract Syntax document as well as some of the other documents that seem to specify only that the cardinality descriptors are restricted to 0 or 1. 5.3.3/5.2.3 allows cardinality 0 under cardinality as a non-negative-integer  </s>
<s> but not minCardinality 0 under minCardinality as a positive-integer.  </s>
<s> If cardinality 0 is expanded out to minCardinality 0 maxCardinality 0. This seems to imply minCardinality can have a value of 0 but only if maxCardinality is also 0. Again this is ok but should definetly be spelled  </s>
<s> out if this is correct.  </s>
<s> Also of slight note is that the http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl document has all the cardinalities listed as non-negative integers.  </s>
