All: I have incorporated Tex's comments, done another round of wordsmithing, and uploaded the results. 
Following Tex's suggestion, I have split the requirements into problem statement and requirement, which has meant very extensive revision of some of the requirements and the addition of a fair amount of text. 
The result, I think, is much clearer to external readers. 
I have tried to be as generic as possible in setting up the requirements, but at least a couple of them are now fairly specific. 
Please take a close look at the new version (online now at http://www.w3.org/International/ws/ws-i18n-requirements-edit/ in both HTML and XML formats). 
Thanks, Addison Addison P. Phillips Director, Globalization Architecture webMethods | Delivering Global Business Visibility Chair, W3C Internationalization (I18N) Working Group Chair, W3C-I18N-WG, Web Services Task Force Internationalization is an architecture.

Addison, Thanks for all the work you did. 
It reads much better and is more to the point. 
I'll try to make a more detailed pass over it this evening. 
1) It is perhaps too much work now, but it would be very nice if the each requirement referenced the relevant scenario(s) in the scenario document. 
That would help people understand the justification for the requirement as well as tie in the other work. 
I wouldn't include any text, just add links at the end of each requirement. 
(e.g. see scenarios link1, link2.) 2) The headings are now much clearer. 
I might change r005 to be "Standard for Locale Identification" or "Standardized Approach to Locale Identification". 
3) I wonder how web service designers will be able to know which international considerations they must take into account when designing or describing their services. 
I suggest there might be a requirement for Guidelines for Web Services Internationalization to accompany the other requirements. 
I think anyone reading the other requirements will have this question, so it is worth addressing and it paves the way for our future tasks... Very good work Addison!

Making e-Business Work Around the World Hi Tex, Thanks for the comments. 
1. 
I thought of adding the links. 
Just didn't have time to figure it out. 
2. Agreed. 
I'll make that change. 
3. That's a good idea. 
Folks: any objections to adding this as a requirement?

It is not a feature. 
I agree on all three. 
For 3) I assume something like "Iternational Guidelines for Web Service Implementers and Developers" with a "check-off" list keyed back to the Requirements and Scenarios.

Hi Mike, Thanks. 
Such a document is more likely to be something like the other GEO documents (such as the Authoring Guidelines for (X)HTML) and FAQs, but certainly with ties back the Ur-documents.
