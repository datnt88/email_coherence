Here are comments, mostly typos on the version of the doc available last night. 
section 2.1.2.2 description second paragraph, second sentence- change "The senders" to singular "The sender". 
next para: change "middlewares" to "middleware". the plural and singular are the same. 
sec. 
2.2.1.2 desc. 
search for "HTTP biding, how" replace with "HTTP binding, how can" (fix spelling of binding and add "can"). 
sec 2.3.1.2 desc. 
sentence beginning with "Date varied by time-zone" should be "Date varies by time-zone," (comma added and varied- varies) next sentence change "distinct" to "distinguish" sec 2.3.2.2 desc. 
in the examples change getAvailableFrightResponse to getAvailableFlightResponse (several places) sec 2.3.3.1 scenario def. 
first use of currency should be made plural- currencies. 
second use is misspelled. 
cunrrecy - currency (I am not sure I agree with the ed. note that this is a legacy issue. 
mismatched currency is bound to be a problem between systems. 
But no change required for this version) The paragraph after the first example beginning "The most of regional services" should be changed to: "Most regional services use the default region's currency,..." or "Most regional services use a default currency,..." next to last para: change "effect" to "affect". 
sec. 
2.3.4.2 desc. 
reference to appendix C should be prefixed with "see appendix" so it reads: (H means Heisei era. 
See appendix C Heisei) first para after the example: add "with" after handshake: "... a receiver can handshake with each..." sec 2.5.2.2 desc. 
global search and replace "custermiz" with "customiz" (at least 3 places) sec 2.7.1 Oursorcing- typo- change to Outsourcing.

Making e-Business Work Around the World Hello Tex, Many thanks for your comments. 
I fixed those that hadn't already been fixed by Kentaro (plus some more). 
Regards, Martin. 
We discussed this at the f2f. 
Our opinion was that in a clean design, the currencies would be noted very close to the actual amounts (like examples in 2.3.2), but that a default currency header as used here might be necessary to ship some blobs of legacy data. 
Regards, Martin.
