<s> I built successfully Amaya ex CVS Sunday with motif in (in LINUX-MOTIF directory).  </s>

<s> EDITORAPP.c is a file generated by app.  </s>
<s> EDITORAPP.c mustn't be in this directory.  </s>
<s> (and so on about all *APP.c int this directory) It probably comes from a previous try to compile or configure amaya in the home/mhf/src/Amaya/ directory instead of the Amaya/"obj"/ drectory...  </s>
<s> The best way is to erase the Amaya dir and re-follow the guidelines from the begining (without compiling or configuring while in the /home/mhf/Amaya/ directory but only in subdirs).  </s>
<s> This is the only way to avoid further problems.  </s>
<s> -Paul  </s>
<s> I have deleted all files in the Amaya/amaya directory dated after the download date.  </s>
<s> Then I followed the procedure and it compiled allright.  </s>
<s> The view problem is fixed and it seems to be quicker than motif.  </s>
<s> I will use it from now on and report back on my experience.  </s>
<s> Thank you Michael  </s>
