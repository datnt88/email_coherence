POLL ON TELECONFERENCE MEETING TIMES This poll is to help us find available times for the MEP task force to meet by teleconference. 
I've (somewhat arbitrarily) proposed several candidate times below. 
Feel free to suggest other times as well, by following the same format below. 
HOW TO VOTE Erase everything above the top "-=-=-=-" line and erase everything below the bottom "-=-=-=-" line. 
Do not erase anything between these lines. 
In the brackets next to each proposed time, indicate your availability as follows: Vote Meaning 0 (or blank) Neutral. 
I can meet at this time. 
-1 I prefer NOT this time, but I can do it if necessary -2 I CANNOT meet at this time Please indicate your availability for EVERY proposed time below. 
Then mail the ballot to me: dbooth@w3.org . 
I'll collate them and post the results. 
Don't worry about spacing of the columns or any quote characters (" ") that your reply inserts.

David Booth W3C Fellow / Hewlett-Packard Argh, this is so damn complicated .. what's wrong with a good old Web form? 
I guess you W3C guys are more comfortable with email!!!! Anyway, preferences below. 
Bye, Sanjiva. 
Sorry, I already had a perl script for counting them from email messages, and a Web form would have required me to get the System Team to set one up, which didn't seem necessary for only 9 people. 
David Booth W3C Fellow / Hewlett-Packard up, Of course .. I was just giving u a hard time. 
In any case, this seems like a useful form to have for general use given how often we all have to go thru this process. 
Sanjiva.
