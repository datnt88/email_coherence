<s> I still consider the question unresolved as to what version an HTTP/1.x server should return for an HTTP/1.0 request.  </s>
<s> I claim the draft (section 6.1) does not specify it: "The first line of a Response message is the Status-Line, consisting of the protocol version followed by ..." To review (minus the pros and cons), the issue is whether the server should return (1) HTTP/1.0 (the version of the request) or (2) HTTP/1.1 (the version the server software understands).  </s>
<s> The concern people have expressed is that in the first case you could never determine whether a server understands HTTP/1.1.  </s>
<s> I favor case one.  </s>
<s> Henrik Frystyk Nielsen has noted that clients should begin to send HTTP/1.1 in their requests.  </s>
<s> HTTP/1.1 servers would respond in kind.  </s>
<s> HTTP/1.0 servers (with two known exceptions) generally respond to HTTP/1.1 requests with a response of HTTP/1.0.  </s>
<s> We could also [hack] recommend as a convention that servers include the protocol version that the server understands as a comment in the Server: header.  </s>
<s> My opinion notwithstanding, I offer wording for the two cases for section 6.1, to follow the Status-Line syntax:  </s>
<s> Case 1 (return HTTP/1.0 to HTTP/1.0 request): The protocol version in the response MUST be the lesser of HTTP/1.1 and the protocol version in the request.  </s>
<s> The headers in the response MUST be consistent with the protocol version in the response.  </s>
<s> Case 2 (return HTTP/1.1 to HTTP/1.0 request): The protocol version in the response MUST be the greater of HTTP/1.1 and the protocol version in the request.  </s>
<s> The headers in the response MUST be consistent with the protocol version in the request.  </s>
<s> We need to agree on one case or the other and (I believe) to choose words to add to the draft.  </s>

<s> There are multiple possible interpretations of "The headers in the response MUST be consistent with the protocol version in the (response|request)".  </s>
<s> Interpretation A: the headers in the response must be _defined_ in the protocol version in the (response|request), or Interpretation B: the headers in the response must _not be inconsistent_ with the protocol version in the (response|request).  </s>
<s> The way in which the major/minor version scheme works is involved with this.  </s>
<s> It's always supposed to be possible for a 1.n client to receive 1.m responses from a 1.m server and behave reasonably according to the capabilities of version min(1.n,1.m).  </s>
<s> If m =n, the headers will describe how a version 1.m client should behave, and the 1.n version should be able to do that.  </s>
<s> If m n, the response should still have a reasonable interpretation in 1.n.  </s>
<s> If this can't work, the major/minor version system isn't going to work.  </s>
<s> If we believe interpretation A above, then a HTTP 1.0 proxy anywhere between a HTTP 1.1 client and a HTTP 1.1 server would prevent the server from ever being able to pass any 1.1-only headers through the proxy to the client in either case (1) or (2).  </s>
<s> Furthermore this would require proxies to remove 1.1 headers when responding to 1.0 clients.  </s>
<s> So, this is pretty bad.  </s>
<s> If we believe interpretation A above, then, since 1.1 is supposed to  </s>
<s> be backward compatible with 1.0, if headers defined in 1.1 are left uninterpreted (and this is the crux of the major/minor version scheme), then it is always OK to return a normal 1.1 response to a 1.0 request.  </s>
<s> This seems to suggest it makes sense to return a 1.1 version number as well.  </s>

<s> In the discussion so far the proponents of "send HTTP/1.1 in response to an HTTP/1.0 request" emphasize the desirability of advertising the server's capabilities.  </s>
<s> But that shouldn't be necessary.  </s>
<s> If a client understands HTTP/1.1, it should send an HTTP/1.1 request (as Henrik first noted).  </s>
<s> An HTTP/1.0 server (with two known exceptions) will respond with HTTP/1.0.  </s>
<s> If a client sends an HTTP/1.0 request, then sending an HTTP/1.1 response advertises something that's apparently of no use to that client.  </s>
<s> I agree with Dave Morris that we're trying to overload the meaning of the protocol version in the status line.  </s>
<s> If it's truly desirable to advertise capability (and I'm not convinced), then I think the version of the response and the capability version should be separated.  </s>
<s> The extra information would only be necessary when the two versions differ.  </s>
