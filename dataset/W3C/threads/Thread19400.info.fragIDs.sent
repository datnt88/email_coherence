<s> Hi Bert, First note that the mailing list has been changed to be the same as on w3.org.  </s>
<s> This has been part of the CSS specification draft some time ago.  </s>
<s> It has been removed since but I think it's useful for user's preferences, so I maintained it in Amaya.  </s>
<s> See http://www.w3.org/{team, member}/WWW/Amaya/User/CSS.html for the current status, what's in, what's not.  </s>
<s> The full ISO-Latin-1 charset is supported except the division and the multiply characters which are used for the rendering of OElig and oelig wich are not part of the ISO.  </s>
<s> See http://www.w3.org/{team, member}/WWW/Amaya/User/Keyboard.html for complete table of key, name and keyboard mapping.  </s>
<s> What should be the sorting order ?  </s>
<s> There is no predefined order, except that HTML and BODY should go first, and an alphabetic one doesn't seem good.  </s>
<s> How would you compare ".pinky" (class) and "H1 EM" ?  </s>
<s> Agreed, that's common use.  </s>
<s> I just hope it won't become a standard just because of Netscape old bad behaviour on unknown elements in HEAD  </s>
<s> Yes I am quite surprised ... Will check an correct it !  </s>

<s> Hello Irene,  </s>
<s> It only occurs when you try to change an attribute value (the bold text in the structure view): put the mouse on a character in an attribute value and type ^D, no other keys are accepted after that, until you press the mouse button again.  </s>
<s> The cursor disappears as well.  </s>
<s> There is no problem when deleting a character in the element's content.  </s>
<s> It was in HTML 3.0 and it is also in HTML i18n.  </s>
<s> It inserts the appropriate Q quotation marks /Q for the current language.  </s>
<s> Arena supports it, but has a bug that allows a line to break between the quote and the word; GNNpress supports it, but has a huge bug: it only inserts the opening quote.  </s>
<s> Emacs-W3 supports it.  </s>
<s> Tango supports it completely, including the language-dependent quotes.  </s>
<s> Still, there is somethig wrong.  </s>
<s> It also appears to be possible to set the focus to the main window, then type characters which will not appear in the main window but only in the structure view, until the next screen update.  </s>
<s> When I put the mouse cursor over a button in the toolbar and press the space bar, that button will be selected.  </s>
<s> When I'm typing in the main view and accidentally move the mouse to the title field, my characters will go into the title field instead of into the main text.  </s>
<s> It must have something to do with the resource keyboardFocusPolicy, which is probably forced to `pointer' somehow, since adding it to the resources with 'amaya*keyboardFocusPolicy:explicit' doesn't have any effect.  </s>
<s> It also means that I can't use the tab to change the focus from one button to the next.  </s>
<s> Btw.  </s>
<s> Amaya doesn't support the -xrm command line option.  </s>
<s> Maybe it doesn't call the X toolkit correctly?  </s>
<s> Ah, it works for all elements except SPAN...  </s>
<s> I agree, but it is a requirement by the HTML ERB, in order to give old browsers some protection.  </s>
