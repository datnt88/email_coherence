I just wanted to report that I had no trouble at all porting amaya 0.95b to FreeBSD (2.1.5).

The X11R6 libraries were from XFree86 (3.1.2), and Motif 2.0 was the SWiM package from ACC Corp. 
If there is anything else you would like (config.h?, any binaries?), let me know.

Date: 04/01/97 Time: 09:56:16 This message was sent by XF-Mail Great, thanks a lot for your report and diffs. 
Did you try to compile Thot Editor also ? 
Sould be just a matter of fetching thoteditor-src-2.0b.tar.gz from ftp://opera.inrialpes.fr/pub/sources/thot/ 
extract it under Thot directory, cd to FreeBSD and type in make thot (also need to build the schemas in Thot/schemas to actually use it). 
Well I would be interested in the final content of the Thot/FreeBSD directory, mainly the config.h and precompiled libraries (zlib, jpeg, png and libwww) but I guess the main problem is to have Motif ... Concerning the binaries I don't know what's the usual distribution channel for FreeBSD binaries. 
However I would appreciate a binary distribution to store here, e.g. a tar with : Thot/FreeBSD/bin/amaya Thot/FreeBSD/bin/print Thot/batch/MachineType that would be perfect ! 
If uploading, use ftp://opera.inrialpes.fr/incoming

I have not tried that but I may get to it in the next few days. 
FreeBSD is available via ftp from ftp.cdrom.com, or on CDROM from Walnut Creek Software, cf. http://www.cdrom.com and FreeBSD formalizes the notions of "package" and "port". 
For packages, one can install the binaries (executables, libraries, or both) directly from the CDROM or by ftp. 
The system is set up so that packages can have other packages as pre-requisites, and an attempt to install a package will trigger the installation of pre-requisites if they can be located. 
There are packages for the jpeg, png, z, and www libraries. 
(Eventually there could also be a package for amaya if you want to set up some connection with one of the FreeBSD core team to accomplish this, cf. http://www.freebsd.org. 
I encourage you to do this. 
There a lot of FreeBSD users out there and you can increase amaya's exposure greatly this way.) For a port as opposed to a package, one gets off the cdrom or from ftp a simple Makefile (and a few data files) that when made fetches a source distribution from wherever and then patches it for the FreeBSD environment and finally makes the software (but stops short of installing it). 
As a minimum, it would be easy to take what I already gave you and give it to someone on the core team to set up an amaya port. 
As you say, the problem usually is that people who have FreeBSD don't necessarily have Motif. 
OK, presumably you want a compile with -O not -g. 
In a few days I will do that and send the results to the ftp url above. 
I am slightly behind the latest FreeBSD release; I am still waiting for the 2.2 CDROM to arrive on subscription. 
If that does arrive soon, I will give you binaries based on FreeBSD 2.2, X11R6.1 from XFree86 3.2 and (still) Motif 2.0 from ACC Corp. Otherwise, I won't wait and I'll send you what I can do for now.

Date: 04/01/97 Time: 10:39:55 This message was sent by XF-Mail Well I guess I won't have the time needed to do it in the normal way (I didn't even took time to package things for RPM Linux RedHat). 
Well the Amaya Team will be at the WWW6 conf next week and we are quite busy until then. 
Take your time, we will do a clean package when you will have the latest version compiled. 
Time is not much an issue and we know now that there is no real problem for a FreeBSD version :-) thanks, Daniel
