<s> This message is a topic-framing thread starter for a review and hopefully reform of the Web interface to the W3C email archives.  </s>
<s> Gregory Rosmaita has noticed that the interface to the email archives has accessibility defects.? Judy Brewer has indicated that we should prepare a reform that is for all W3C archives, and not just for the WAI lists.  </s>
<s> So Daniel Dardailler and I have sketched out a two-cycle plan of attack.  </s>
<s> Homework phase 1: review and design, leading to design proposal.  </s>
<s> I will coordinate the formulation of a design proposal for a restructuring of the web archive interface.? This will be based on review of the existing interface.? It will include preparation of design options as hand-built individual pages, but not generation of a whole list archive.? I would like to run this discussion on this list.  </s>
<s> Please use the mark [archives] to identify posts in this thread so we don't get too mixed up with the glossary or other topics that run concurrently.  </s>
<s> Let's take at least a week on datagathering.  </s>
<s> This includes access or usability issues with the current web interface to the W3C email archives, suggestions of good sites that serve a similar function, drafting page mockups to show what could be done, etc.  </s>
<s> Then there will be a time interval I haven't estimated yet.  </s>
<s> Have to see what we get in the way of raw data.  </s>
<s> This phase will draw to a close with a written review of the issues and draft redesign offered for Jose to review and the next meeting to decide about.  </s>
<s> Meeting 1: decide on a redesign for an evaluation version or draft change: Daniel will chair a caucus where Jose and the proposers go over what the design proposal would mean in terms of modifications to Hypermess, and settle on a design change to take into Homework phase 2: Homework phase 2: implement and evaluate evaluation version: Meeting 2: Review evaluation results for evaluation version.? Agenda: Decide whether to implement the evaluation version or a close derivative thereof site-wide across W3C archives.  </s>

<s> Is there a reference available to a document or e-mail message describing what the supposed problems are?  </s>
<s> I have been using the W3C e-mail archives  </s>
<s> for years without any difficulty whatsoever, and a quick perusal of the HTML source doesn't reveal anything that would strike me as a significant access issue.  </s>
<s> Which checkpoints (either in WCAG 1.0 or WCAG 2.0) have not been met, or are there issues here which aren't reflected in the WCAG, but ought to be?  </s>
<s> AG:: No there is no paper trail up until now.?  </s>
<s> There is prior correspondence but it is not all in the archives and what is in the archives is scattered.? So we need to re-build the record here.?  </s>
<s> That is why it is helpful to have this list set up in a way that it can support special studies on an ad hoc basis.  </s>
<s> The point where I hit the wall, that is to say I concluded that "absolutely, we need to do something about this," concerns the link content within the table of links to different index pages on the front page for the sub-site dedicated to archiving one list.? If one goes for example to w3c-wai-gl@w3.org Mail Archives http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl http://lists.w3.org/Archive s/Public/w3c-wai-gl/ And considers the injunction "make each link have distinguished link text" one immediately finds a question raised by the fact that "date, thread, author, subject" appear over and over for different links.  </s>
<s> The entire difference between your success and the putative failure mode probably has to do with a certain difference between caution and abandon in approaching the page.? If one reads all text within the table, the date ranges that qualify the "date, thread, author, subject" entries will be fresh in one's mind, and the links will be adequately identified.? On the other hand, if one tries to go through this page by tabbing, the identity of the link targets is effectively opaque.?  </s>
<s> You don't know which author index page is what.? Or for that matter that 'author' is a category of index page.  </s>
<s> This experience -- that you yourself don't miss what is missing -- illustrates how one needs a continual supply of fresh newbies as testers.? The old testers learn too many tricks along the way and stop noticing problems.  </s>
<s> This table of links clearly violates checkpoint 5.1 [P1] of WCAG 1.0, and for tabbing through violates 13.1 [P2] as well, I hope that is enough prima_facie evidence so that the judge will please grant a warrant to investigate further.  </s>

<s> I followed the link you created in the WAI-IG mailing list.  </s>
<s> My first question when I got there was 'Where the heck am I'? Some suggestions..... 1. Create a Mailing List Title at the top of each message, with a link to tell you about the group, how to post etc. 2. The current first line of the post (the subject) should be made consistent with the 'From' and the 'Date'.  </s>
