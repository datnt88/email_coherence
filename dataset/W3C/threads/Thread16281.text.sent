So far all we have as guidelines for making sites accessible are some validators (excellent ones!) and what we learn from each other on these eMail list and the W3C guidelines (WAI) for making sites viewable to as large an audience as possible. 
I listen to what everyone has to say and if I learn something new I test it on my page and then validate it. 
I use Cast/Bobby, W3C Validator, W3C CSS Validation and I put it through several browsers. 
If it passes and looks good in the browsers, I feel I have done a good job and will use it. 
But, I have never felt that designing accessibly was harder than not nor that it really took more time. 
I made up my mind (when I learned about the accessibility issue) to design all my sites this way from that day forward. 
I am choosing to go back over my older sites and start updating them (and it is going to take quite a while). 
I hand code and am at the point where coding for accessbility seems to come naturally. 
When I tell my clients how I design their pages, this pleases them. 
If one chooses to charge more for designing this way, then that is one's choice. 
I don't because I feel it should be intergrated in with the design from the beginning. 
This is only my opinion. 
Joyce Taylor Joyce, we have to make a distinction between "designing accessibly" -- which is a mindset, a method, a general way you do things -- and specific accessible web design techniques. 
The mindset in which one designs accessibly, with a concern for those who may not access the web in the manner that we -- or the majority of current users -- access the web, does not put a burden on the creator. 
In fact, it's liberating once you realize the potential of the web and how you utilize the full power of the world wide web concept. 
However, there are specific techniques for -doing- accessible web design that may take time, and sometimes may take considerable time (or cost). 
So it's important to make a distinction between the philosophy of accessible web design, and the practice of accessible web techniques.

Dear Kynn, This statement is a little ambiguous to me. . 
. 
Kynn, I haven't found any yet that refers to the way I design or has cost me in anything other than time. 
But please keep in mind, if it did cost me more time, that is okay because I choose to design this way. 
This is my philosophy and my practice. 
I will design my sites to be as accessible as I know how. 
I have learned so much over the past few years and I guess I just do not find it that much of a hardship. 
If I didn't care about this issue, I would not spend so much time learning all I can about how to do it properly. 
I'm still learning. 
This is my education. 
"The Education of Accessibility" *Smile* Joyce Hi Joyce, I find that by and large designing for accessibility is not different from other design. 
There are some cases where there is a little more work to make things accesible. 
For example, providing alt and longdesc takes more time than not providing them, and when I build sites for money I charge by how long it takes. 
But the real costs always are in overall information design and production. 
And not desiging for accessibility is something i just don't bother with. 
I simply explain that it costs whatever ridiculous sum I can think up to ignore accessibility. 
I find that it can be difficult to convince a client that things they have seen somewhere are a bad idea, but there are things the web is not good at. 
(Sadly, this includes making me coffee in the morning, as well as ensuring that everybody gets pixel-level design control and perfect colour reproduction in whatever machine they use to view the web.) My basic position is that accessibility is one of the requirements for communicating via the web - if the idea doesn't get from person to person then it is irrelevant how the technology works or is used. 
Most clients are pretty happy with that idea.
