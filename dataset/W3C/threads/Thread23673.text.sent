Hi Bug-fixer! 
OK, this probably isn't a bug, rather just my poor attempt to poll yahoo.com with a search search for dog + cat. 
I am told  Sorry, no matches were found containing 3ddog+cat Hey! 
I did a search for dog+cat NOT 3ddog+cat What's going on here? 
Here's what I sent to yuhoo [snip] XFORM=FORM ACTION http://search.yahoo.com/bin/search 
METHOD GET XBASE = http://www.yahoo.com/ 
XFORMREPLY = TEXT p=dog+cat Search=on XSUBMIT_NOW = on XFORM= /FORM - Allan.

Okay, you should probably turn off quoted printable and set your charset to US-ASCII on your e-mail program! 
Send only plain text in US-ASCII form to the server, whenever there are fancy options that require encoding, other charset or something similar, www4mail could have problems decoding them properly. 
Thanks Clement Onime Hi, I started to use your server two,three weeks ago with a quote of 80-90 messages per week UNUSED. 
The problem started when I requested 6 'sends' (maybe 1 or 2 more, mainly text docs, in one message ... From that time there is no response at all. 
I've looked in your help and found 5 'sends' allowed. 
Whats my ststus now? 
thank you in adv.
