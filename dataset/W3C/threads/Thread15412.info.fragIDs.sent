<s> Hello, While trying to think about the used case scenario, I was browsing through WCAG 2 and the Gateway doc and again the same thought came up: What is in the Gateway doc is a lucid explanation of every checkpoint.  </s>
<s> For instance if I do not understand what is meant by checkpoint 1.3 that reads, "Both [information/substance] and structure are separable from presentation.",  </s>
<s> I would turn to the explanation in the Gateway doc.  </s>
<s> This piece of explanation or those following any other checkpoint in the Gateway doc does not state any specific technique for accomplishing the checkpoints.  </s>
<s> These will be in the technology-specific docs.  </s>
<s> So I do not really understand why the content following every checkpoint contained in the Gateway doc cannot be in the main WCAG 2 doc.  </s>
<s> I brought this up yesterday during the tel-conference and it was explained to me that WCAG 2.0 is a normative doc while the gateway is not.  </s>
<s> The WCAG 2 contains definitions, benefits and examples (all non-normative) for each checkpoint so why not the explanation for every checkpoint?  </s>
<s> I think the WCAG 2 is the best place for these explanatory paragraphs.  </s>
<s> A user does not have to link to another doc and read that.  </s>
<s> If he/she does not want the explanation he can just skip it and jump to the success criteria or whatever.  </s>
<s> It will save a lot of time and effort in writing and vetting up all other sections necessary(abstract, status of doc, TOC, etc) to make the doc complete.  </s>
<s> Well, the required success criteria can be taken up in the Gateway doc grouped by checkpoint but without the present explanatory content.  </s>
<s> The techniques can be linked for every success criteria.  </s>

<s> Likely approaches to use Gateway and Techniques doc for WCAG 2.0 1. Developers wanting to implement WCAG 2.0 or those testing for compliance In all likelihood they will consider core checkpoints first and then regard extended checkpoints They should be able to conveniently identify Gateway and Techniques doc content relating to core checkpoints and extended checkpoints 2. Developers / managers debating on development methodologies might want to check out techniques offered by one technology versus another technology for complying with specific required success criteria / checkpoint 3. An individual who has decided to follow a particular technology path will want to focus on the specific techniques suggested for various checkpoints in the relevant technology doc and not concern himself with other technology docs.  </s>
<s> 4. Those considering switching from one technology to another 5.  </s>
<s> Those who are pursuing WCAG 1.0 and are now checking how WCAG 2 will affect them.  </s>
<s> They mmight use the checkpoint matching document, WCAG 1 and WCAG 2 for comparison Any of the above users will want to navigate from the WCAG doc or the techniques doc to the explanatory content for a checkpoint to gain a clearer understanding of the issues involved.  </s>
<s> 6.  </s>
<s> Those concerned mainly with policy level issues will not delve into specific technologies.  </s>
<s> They will keep switching back and forth between the checkpoint and details in the WCAG doc and the explanation in the Gateway doc.  </s>
<s> Example: - Individuals responsible for framing Web access standards / policies for their organization / state - researchers - for preparing edu and outreach related presentations Trust this is helpful Sailesh Sorry I wasn't clear.  </s>
