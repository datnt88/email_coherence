<s> Some Maltese web pages use a 'Maltese font' to produce the gh and h (h with a line across) and other symbols.  </s>
<s> Unfortunately this font is not unicode standard, so a page with the word 'Tigi' where the g has a dot over it cannot be produced to degrade nicely as 'Tigi' (without the dot) if the user does not have the required Maltese font.  </s>
<s> Yes, now there is the netscape 4 TrueDoc solution but could the Maltese symbols be added to the unicode standard (the g with a dot is already there I noticed some time ago) ?  </s>
<s> Symbols required would be gh (the h has a horizontal line on top), h (with the same horizontal line as in gh), g (with a dot on top), c (with a dot on top), still required will be h (without a line, just a normal h as in English and other languages), g (without a dot on top).  </s>
<s> There is no c without a dot in Maltese except when one writes some foreign word directly.  </s>
<s> How can we eventually get Maltese web pages to move towards HTML font standardisation ?  </s>
<s> Any hints would be appreciated.  </s>

<s> Hello Clyde,  </s>
<s> You have mentionned Unicode, and that's indeed what you should use.  </s>
<s> The h with the line is at U+0127, the c with a dot on top is at U+010B (these are lower case, the upper case alternatives are provided also).  </s>
<s> Please have a look at  </s>
<s> Well, very simple indeed: Use Unicode as your character repertoire, and UTF-8 as your encoding (most compact because most of your characters are ASCII).  </s>
<s> As for fonts, there is the Cybebit font from Bitstream (not directly related to truedoc), and I think some Windows variants also contain an extended set of glyphs in their fonts, with a good coverage of extended Latin.  </s>
<s> Happy Maltese surfing!  </s>
<s> Regards, Martin.  </s>
<s> The Maltese characters Clyde Meli to which refers are included in Unicode Latin Extended-A.  </s>
<s> Their Unicode identities are: U+010A Latin capital letter C with dot above U+010B Latin small letter C with dot above U+0120 Latin capital letter G with dot above U+0121 Latin small letter G with dot above U+0126 Latin capital letter H with stroke U+0127 Latin small letter H with stroke Also included is the dotted Z, which I believe is also necessary for Maltese.  </s>
<s> U+017B Latin capital letter Z with dot above U+017C Latin small letter Z with dot above I would be very interested to know if you anyone think of a reason why the g/barred-h combination should exist as a separate character for encoding purposes.  </s>
<s> My understanding is that this digraph affects the pronunciation of a subsequent i or u, producing specific diphthong sounds.  </s>
<s> Is there any reason why this digraph should not always consist of the two separate characters?  </s>
<s> Is this digraph sorted separately in dictionaries, for example?  </s>

<s> In Maltese dictionaries, the g/barred-h combination is listed as a separate character.  </s>
<s> However, I don't see why it would need to be encoded separately.  </s>
<s> The 'g' and 'barred-h' each represent other characters when not appearing in a digraph.  </s>
<s> Typically, similar digraphs in other languages are encoded as the sequence of their component characters.  </s>
<s> Since that holds true for many other languages, I can't see why it should be different for Maltese.  </s>
