Some Maltese web pages use a 'Maltese font' to produce the gh and h (h with a line across) and other symbols. 
Unfortunately this font is not unicode standard, so a page with the word 'Tigi' where the g has a dot over it cannot be produced to degrade nicely as 'Tigi' (without the dot) if the user does not have the required Maltese font. 
Yes, now there is the netscape 4 TrueDoc solution but could the Maltese symbols be added to the unicode standard (the g with a dot is already there I noticed some time ago) ? 
Symbols required would be gh (the h has a horizontal line on top), h (with the same horizontal line as in gh), g (with a dot on top), c (with a dot on top), still required will be h (without a line, just a normal h as in English and other languages), g (without a dot on top). 
There is no c without a dot in Maltese except when one writes some foreign word directly. 
How can we eventually get Maltese web pages to move towards HTML font standardisation ? 
Any hints would be appreciated.

Hello Clyde, 
You have mentionned Unicode, and that's indeed what you should use. 
The h with the line is at U+0127, the c with a dot on top is at U+010B (these are lower case, the upper case alternatives are provided also). 
Please have a look at 
Well, very simple indeed: Use Unicode as your character repertoire, and UTF-8 as your encoding (most compact because most of your characters are ASCII). 
As for fonts, there is the Cybebit font from Bitstream (not directly related to truedoc), and I think some Windows variants also contain an extended set of glyphs in their fonts, with a good coverage of extended Latin. 
Happy Maltese surfing! 
Regards, Martin. 
The Maltese characters Clyde Meli to which refers are included in Unicode Latin Extended-A. 
Their Unicode identities are: U+010A Latin capital letter C with dot above U+010B Latin small letter C with dot above U+0120 Latin capital letter G with dot above U+0121 Latin small letter G with dot above U+0126 Latin capital letter H with stroke U+0127 Latin small letter H with stroke Also included is the dotted Z, which I believe is also necessary for Maltese. 
U+017B Latin capital letter Z with dot above U+017C Latin small letter Z with dot above I would be very interested to know if you anyone think of a reason why the g/barred-h combination should exist as a separate character for encoding purposes. 
My understanding is that this digraph affects the pronunciation of a subsequent i or u, producing specific diphthong sounds. 
Is there any reason why this digraph should not always consist of the two separate characters? 
Is this digraph sorted separately in dictionaries, for example?

In Maltese dictionaries, the g/barred-h combination is listed as a separate character. 
However, I don't see why it would need to be encoded separately. 
The 'g' and 'barred-h' each represent other characters when not appearing in a digraph. 
Typically, similar digraphs in other languages are encoded as the sequence of their component characters. 
Since that holds true for many other languages, I can't see why it should be different for Maltese.
