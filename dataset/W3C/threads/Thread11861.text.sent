This has been discussed at length in the group. 
The most recent occasion it was brought up was the Working group meeting on 1 September, where the suggestion of doing something similar (providing a vconformance that did not require meeting the checkpoints in what is now guideline 7) was rejected. 
Although this has been a difficult issue for the group, I think a fair summary of the working consensus is that a tool which conforms to the Accessibility Guidelines must be accessible, and until that goal is reached the tool in question is merely good for some aspects of accessibility (in the same way that a tool which is accessible in itself, but leads the author to produce inaccessible content, or prevents the author from producing accessible content, should not be able to claim conformance). 
Regards Charles McCN You only have one type of conformance listed in the document. 
I know there was discussion a few months ago related to the issues of the authoring tool being accessible and producing accessible content. 
It was brought to the attention of the coordination group. 
I was wondering if there was any discussion about having two types of conformance, instead of the one listed in the last call document? 
Conformance types I was thinking of: 1. Conformance in creating accessible web content 2. Conformance for an accessible interface and compatibility with assistive technology It seems to me that two levels would give developers more managable goals to target their accessibility resources and highlight to consumers the level and type of accessibility of authoring tools as developers increase the accessibility of their product. 
I checked the AU issue list to see how it was resolved, but there was no reference to when or how the issue was resolved.

Responses in JRG: JRG: You may want to provide a link to the conformance discussion in your issue list. 
I am sure that many companies during proposed recommendation will want to review the discussion that lead to this group decision. 
Since it is a potential hot button issue during proposed recommendation you may also want to outline the different options the group considered, the process that was used to reach consensus and why group reached this consensus. 
You may also want to include references or statements from the developers participating in the working group that they felt that this was a resonable conclusion. 
JRG: Again I think the two types of conformance just gives more detail on what are the authoring tools capabilities and gives developers a chance to focus their resources on shorter term compliance while they learn more about the other type of conformance. 
Sometimes smaller carrots are easier to chew that one big carrot. 
As a person who would like to have able-bodied instructors on campus use tools that support accessible markup, I would like to see the two types of conformance. 
Since it may take a long time for many tool developers to make their tools more accessible to assistive technologies and build in accessibility features. 
I think you also need to stengthen the checkpoints in guideline 7. I would recommend adding a checkpoint related to supporting the keyboard for all functionalities.

I will update the issues list to link to the minutes of the various discussions of this issue (including, of course, this email thread). 
Selecting individuals' opinions seems to me to have the potential for being seen as questioning the role of the working group, and the value of the input provided by anybody whose opinion is not selected, so I am not inclined to do so. 
Most individuals do not need a completely accessible tool (as described by the guidelines). 
Some people do not need particular features to enable them to use the tool; some do not need any documentation exaplining accessible authoring practices; some do not need any validation or prompting. 
However the current guidelines are designed to enable tools which can be used, and produce content that is useful to people regardless of disablity, as per the working group's charter.

W3C Web Accessibility Initiative http://www.w3.org/WAI MIT/LCS - 545 Technology sq., Cambridge MA, 02139, USA aloha, jon! 
i am adamantly opposed to splitting the conformance statement for the AUGL -- the goal of the AU WG, as spelled out in its charter [1], is to produce a document that will assist software manufacturers to develop authoring tools that not only produce accessible content, but which are themselves accessible... check the wording of the charter and the introductory text carefully, and you will see that the accessibility of the tool and of the content that it produces is not an "either-or" proposition, but that the 2 are inter-related and (at least for the purposes of the AU WG and AUGL) inseparable... splitting conformance as you suggested would lead to the most pernicious form of cyber-ghetto-ization, in which disabled individuals would be forced to rely upon others to produce content for them, rather than reclaiming their inalienable right to create content for the web by themselves... it is not unreasonable to ask developers to ensure that their software is accessible, for -- just as the first step towards the accessibility of web content is use of valid markup -- so too is intelligent and conscientious programming the first step towards building an accessible application... all we are asking the developers of authoring tools to do, therefore, is to exercise care and to follow _published_ guidelines and standards in developing their tools' interfaces... allowing developers to produce authoring tools that are not themselves accessible is akin to awarding the Martin Luther King Freedom Award to the editor of a major publication who has always taken a strong stance on equal rights and integration, but who belongs to a country club that won't extend membership to blacks, Jews, or women... gregory.

Gregory, My problem with the one type of conformance is that it will only idenitify tools which comply to all checkpoints. 
I am assuming that it may take a long time for authoring tool developers to understand and to comply with many of the checkpoints in guideline 7 and until some developers do there will be no tools that conform. 
I hope I am wrong about developers interest in accessible tools, but based on the AU discussions it is a controversal issue and acceptance of it maybe slow by developers. 
But again I hope I am wrong about developers interest and priority of adding accessibility features, especially if only one level of conformance is maintained in the guidelines. 
So in the mean time tools that produce accessible markup can only be identified through trial and error. 
This will mean alot of work for me and other people to identify tools which produce accessible markup to recommend to authors (in my case instructors on the UIUC campus) to produce accessible web materials. 
If there were two levels of conformance then it would be a lot less work for me and other people to identify a tool capabilities. 
Naturally I would like to recommend tools that produce both accessible mark up and are highly accessible to people with disabilities, but many authors have strong preferences on tools may not care about accessibility of the tool (unfortunatley I think this may be the majority of web authors and hopefully something WAI and other groups can help reduce). 
The advantage to me and others like me who want to recommend tools to have two levels of conformance is basically: 1. 
More timely information on a tools capabilities related to accessibility 2. Potentially gives authors more choices on tools that produce accessible markup. 
Many authors have strong preferences and giving them choices improves the chance of them using tools that create accessible markup. 
I am in total support of the goal of having accessible authoring tools and accessible markup, I am just stating my interest in how the guidelines conformance statement can help me in improving the accessibility of Web materials on the UIUC campus.

Jon, An example of a tool which seems to already meet all the checkpoints of what I could test and the author's claims both suggest that it does) is asWedit, available from advasoft - http://www.advasoft.com.au 
Although I have not used it myself I believe that HoTMetaL 5 is very close to this point. 
There are other tools which meet it but do not necessarily meet all the others - emacs is a pretty common example in the Unix world. 
Any developer (or third party) is free to to a test of which checkpoints a tool meets, and to publish it. 
Indeed, as a sample of how such a test is done, and an indication of how a particular class of tool (a WYSIWYG editor) can meet the checkpoints, we have provided a conformance test for amaya, which spells out which checkpoints it meets, and which it does not. 
To claim conformance to the guidelines a tool is required to meet the entire set of requirements for the level of conformance claimed. 
The group has decided against enabling conformance claims for tools which remove some of the barriers to accessibility, which is not to say that tools which only meet some of the barriers are not worthwhile, just that there are other barriers that are faced by people with disabilities. 
Although the example I cited earlier, asWedit, is pretty close to double-A conformance overall, there are requirements which it does not meet, and it is therefore not conformant (at any level). 
Whether this takes two weeks or two yeras to fix is beyond the control of the working group, but the things that it does not do are things that other authoring tools do, so the requirements do not seem to be impossible to meet.
