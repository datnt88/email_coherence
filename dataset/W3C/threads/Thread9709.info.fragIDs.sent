<s> Specifically don't read that as qnames but evocative of how XSD is used in XML; similar how the xsi:type is being used in this RDF/XML - a special attribute.  </s>
<s> But I'm still waiting for the triples for these RDF/XML + xsi:type examples.  </s>
<s> Which is hard to do if they have no n-triples syntax.  </s>
<s> I'll create a better N-triples if needed when I'm clear what (if anything) has changed in the graph.  </s>

<s> What's changed in the graph is that the space of "literals" has expanded; that is that jenny age "10" .  </s>
<s> and jenny age number(10) .  </s>
<s> are distinct triples, but that jenny age number(10) .  </s>
<s> bob age number(10) .  </s>
<s> indicates that jenny and bob really do have the same age.  </s>
<s> As to how much it has expanded: this proposal seems to be capable of going two ways: 1. the space of literals is expanded by a small set of other literal types to provide a sufficient foundation for datatyping to be built upon.  </s>
<s> That a small set can be sufficient is indicated by the success people have in using RDBM systems, I suppose.  </s>
<s> This proposal would then need guidelines as to what to do with other "datatypes": eg: factor out units in property values; use uri-labelled resources for enumerations and taxons; use graph-structure to express compound types.  </s>
<s> This reading means that the RDF parser must have a transform from some serialised form to the appropriate value, but that the values are what are present in the graph.  </s>
<s> In this case, the "hook" for that transorf is the xsi:type attribute.  </s>
<s> The space of literals is not extnsible by third parties.  </s>
<s> Presumably for datatyping and range constraints, etc, rdf:Literal (rdfs:Literal?  </s>
<s> I forget) is subclassed into numbers (or ints and reals), strings, langstrings, whatever.  </s>
<s> That literals are essentially self-denoting entities is obvious in this setup.  </s>
<s> 2. the space of literals is arbitrarily expandable by users, and literal nodes in the graph are of the form type, thing where a "thing" may or may ont be a lexical form.  </s>
<s> Treatment of compound, union, intersection of types is unclear in this system.  </s>
<s> In this case the proposal is effectively "drawing a circle" around the construct from one of the other datatyping proposals that uses node-and-arc constructs, and calling the whole contents of that circle "the literal" jan grant, ILRT, University of Bristol.  </s>

<s> Well, no; in fact, they can't be self-denoting in this setup.  </s>
<s> If (int)10 is supposed to denote an integer, then if it were self-denoting it would have to be an integer, which it isn't.  </s>
<s> In fact, you can't put integers into syntax, so *anything* that denotes integers isn't self-denoting.  </s>
