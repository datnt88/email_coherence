<s> Currently, we have 3 votes (Stefan, Geoff, Jim) in favor of Stefan's resolution (i.e. disallow a delete on the stable URL of a resource if there are any other bindings to that resource), and 1 vote (Julian) in favor of Julian's resolution (have DELETE handle the stable URL the same as any other URL).  </s>
<s> Since there appear to be no compatibility or implementability issues here (just "usability" ones), unless we get some more feedback, it looks like Stefan's proposal is the winner.  </s>
<s> As for the other topic, i.e. which URL appears in property values, I'm inclined to leave that up to the server for now, until we get more experience with these alternative URLs.  </s>

<s> Removing the stable binding does not affect which URL will be reported in the live properties -- the resource just itself isn't accessible  </s>
<s> through the stable URL anymore.  </s>
<s> This relaxes the "stable URL" requirement such that clients still can rely on the stable URL when being mapped to be  </s>
<s> mapped to the initially created resource (it won't be reused).  </s>
<s> Upon encountering a 404, they would however not be able to conclude that the resource itself is gone (I'd still like to hear why that would be a problem).  </s>
<s> This model is completely deterministic and avoids special-casing DELETE and  </s>
<s> BIND for these resources, therefore it would be a protocol simplification (a  </s>

<s> DeltaV has the concept of stable bindings, but if there's no interoperable way to discover them, the whole concept is *completely* useless.  </s>

<s> I didn't see any new arguments in your previous mail, just a restatement of your orginal argument.  </s>
<s> I thought that Jim and Stefan both gave good reasons for why they prefer requiring the stable URL to be mapped to a resource as long as there are any bindings to the resource.  </s>

<s> That's fine with me.  </s>
<s> I'm guessing most folks are not especially concerned because they are not planning on implementing multiple bindings to either version histories or versions (but for the same reason, would have no problem if this is made explicit).  </s>
<s> And if we get *that* issue resolved, I'd really like to see a *discussion* of the argument I made:  </s>
<s> The only argument I see here for this alternative resolution is that avoids special-casing DELETE (there is no special casing needed for BIND).  </s>
<s> The reason given in favor of special-casing DELETE is that it guarantees that a client can store away a stable URL with confidence that it will be usable for operating on the resource as long as that resource is accessible by any other URL.  </s>
<s> Jim, Stefan, and I believe that this behavior is more important than avoiding the special-casing for DELETE.  </s>
<s> You believe the opposite.  </s>
<s> It seems appropriate to mark this issue as resolved until you can provide an argument that at least one other person finds compelling.  </s>
<s> Cheers, Geoff  </s>
<s> How can you not implement multiple bindings, if they appear as port of working collections?  </s>
<s> Anyway, I think this should be marked as resolved (the spec should state that all version and VHR URIs that are reported in live properties must be the stable URIs).  </s>
