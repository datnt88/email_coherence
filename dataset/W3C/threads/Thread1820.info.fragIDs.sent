Currently, we have 3 votes (Stefan, Geoff, Jim) in favor of Stefan's resolution (i.e. disallow a delete on the stable URL of a resource if there are any other bindings to that resource), and 1 vote (Julian) in favor of Julian's resolution (have DELETE handle the stable URL the same as any other URL). 
Since there appear to be no compatibility or implementability issues here (just "usability" ones), unless we get some more feedback, it looks like Stefan's proposal is the winner. 
As for the other topic, i.e. which URL appears in property values, I'm inclined to leave that up to the server for now, until we get more experience with these alternative URLs. 
Cheers, Geoff in RFC3253

Any discussion of 14.4_CLARIFY_VH_DELETE_2 should be mailed to the deltav mailing list, not to the general webdav mailing list. 
Actually, I think there are *two* issues, one of which is the one above (where I clearly disagree with the current resolution), and... 
For all live properties that refer to version resources or version history resources, which one of possibly multiple bindings should be reported? 
(I think we all agree that the stable binding should be reported). 
As we also have agreed (months ago) that the fact that the a deltaV live property points to a specific URL does *not* guarantee that the reported URL 
is still mapped (so a client can get a 404...), I hereby ask again to consider the following alternate resolution to 14.4_CLARIFY_VH_DELETE_2: Bindings to version resources or version history resources may be deleted in 
any order. 
Removing the stable binding does not affect which URL will be reported in the live properties -- the resource just itself isn't accessible 
through the stable URL anymore. 
This relaxes the "stable URL" requirement such that clients still can rely on the stable URL when being mapped to be 
mapped to the initially created resource (it won't be reused). 
Upon encountering a 404, they would however not be able to conclude that the resource itself is gone (I'd still like to hear why that would be a problem). 
This model is completely deterministic and avoids special-casing DELETE and 
BIND for these resources, therefore it would be a protocol simplification (a 
hopefully shared goal of the WG :-).

Geoff, I have to say that I completely disagree, and I would have really hoped that the arguments in my previous mail would actually be considered (I've seen no reply -- does this mean nobody had anything to say about it???). 
In particular: 
No way! 
DeltaV has the concept of stable bindings, but if there's no interoperable way to discover them, the whole concept is *completely* useless. 
So if we wan't agree that live properties such as "DAV:checked-in" *always* identify the stable binding, it makes no sense whatsoever to keep this concept. 
So we *really* need to write that down. 
Does anybody have a problem with this (just in case: silence means "no"!)? 
And if we get *that* issue resolved, I'd really like to see a *discussion* of the argument I made:

I didn't see any new arguments in your previous mail, just a restatement of your orginal argument. 
I thought that Jim and Stefan both gave good reasons for why they prefer requiring the stable URL to be mapped to a resource as long as there are any bindings to the resource. 
I will summarize those reasons below. 
DeltaV has the concept of stable bindings, but if there's no interoperable way to discover them, the whole concept is *completely* useless.

Does anybody have a problem with this? 
That's fine with me. 
I'm guessing most folks are not especially concerned because they are not planning on implementing multiple bindings to either version histories or versions (but for the same reason, would have no problem if this is made explicit). 
And if we get *that* issue resolved, I'd really like to see a *discussion* of the argument I made: 
The only argument I see here for this alternative resolution is that avoids special-casing DELETE (there is no special casing needed for BIND). 
The reason given in favor of special-casing DELETE is that it guarantees that a client can store away a stable URL with confidence that it will be usable for operating on the resource as long as that resource is accessible by any other URL. 
Jim, Stefan, and I believe that this behavior is more important than avoiding the special-casing for DELETE. 
You believe the opposite. 
It seems appropriate to mark this issue as resolved until you can provide an argument that at least one other person finds compelling. 
Cheers, Geoff 
How can you not implement multiple bindings, if they appear as port of working collections? 
Anyway, I think this should be marked as resolved (the spec should state that all version and VHR URIs that are reported in live properties must be the stable URIs). 
I'll answer the "other" issue in a separate mail (which will take time).

It turns out this typo was already fixed in the current revised draft, but the issue does not appear in the issues list. 
So the revised draft is unchanged, but I updated the issues list.
