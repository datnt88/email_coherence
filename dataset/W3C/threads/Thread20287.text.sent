Trying to build under solaris7 gcc-2.95.2, 
I get: creating libwwwutils.la 
(cd .libs 
&amp;&amp; rm -f libwwwutils.la 
&amp;&amp; ln -s ../libwwwutils.la libwwwutils.la)

What further information can I give that will help you find the problem? 
Hugh hgs@dmu.ac.uk Hello Hugh, In our previous episode, Hugh Sasse Staff Elec Eng said: The problem there is that the zlib.a, 
zlib.h, and zconf.h are not found where the libwww configure expects them to be (/usr/local/lib/libz.a or /usr/lib/libz.a, and the same for the include/zlib.h). 
We don't have right now any mechanism allowing to pass an extra include dir to the libwww configure. 
What you can do is to go the libwww/Library/src directory and make a symlink to zlib.h and zconf.h. 
You can find those files in the Amaya/libpng/zlib directory. 
It should compile then. 
Of course, now the question is... why don't we arrange our configure to use those files systematically? 
or should we try to continue using those found in the system? 
-Jose This libwww is the one distributed with Amaya. 
Should not Amaya's configure check these exist, and if not, patch or replace libwww's configure? 
Really? 
Is it not just a -I option on the compiler? 
Set CFLAGS or something? 
link them to what? 
See above for a suggestion. 
BTW, can you tell me if the suggestions about how the install-sh is found have been intgrated for the next realease? 
Thank you. 
Thank you, Hugh Hello Hugh, Sorry for the slow replies. 
We're quite busy preparing some demos for next week at WWW9, in Amsterdam. 
Your install-sh proposition should be already in CVS. 
In our previous episode, Hugh Sasse Staff Elec Eng said: You're right. 
We're already using our own configure in order to be able to compile only a part of libwww. 
The libz problem is a quite new one. 
So far we had only compiled Amaya in boxes which had libz in /usr/local or in /usr/lib, and the configure scripts take this into account. 
I don't have time to try your suggestions right now, but I'll definitely work on this problem when I come back from WWW9. 
If you have time to help us with this problem in the meantime, we'd appreciate it and add your patches to the base. 
No, the CFLAGS in libwww/Library/src are hardcoded. 
They don't take into account what's being passed thru the environment (unless I'm wrong). 
Make a symlink between the libpng/zlib/{the above files} and libwww/Library/src. 
The latter is the directory where there is the source. 
Thanks for your feedback and patience! 
-Jose That is OK, thanks for getting back to me. 
Thank you. 
I see. 
At least I helped pick this up :-) Thank you. 
:-) I am also trying to proare for a confence, so I think you will gt there first. 
OK, thanks. 
Hugh
