Hi ! 
I'd like to know how does a webdav server to store file properties. 
I undestrand that you put a/some propertie(s) with a PROPPATCH, and you get them with a PROPFIND, but WHERE are these properties on the server ? 
I'm actually working with an Apache server (withe mod_dav module), and I don't understand how does that works... Thanx in advance. 
It doesn't really matter where they are as there is no way for clients and servers to interoperate on the semantics of the properties anyway. 
So unless you're doing something custom on both the client and the server side, the properties might as well not exist as far as the server is concerned.

I think there was a misunderstanding. 
I understood the question as: "where does mod_dav actually store the properities?". 
Last time I looked, mod_dav stored them in files/directories starting with '.' on the file system. 
If you have a UNIX shell on the server, just type 'ls -a' and you will see... Best Regards, Stefan [mailto:ietf-dav-versioning-request@w3.org]On
