states: "For example, in CSS, use 'em' or percentage lengths rather than 'pt' or 'cm', which are absolute units. 
If absolute units are used, validate that the rendered content is usable by checking the results on various browsers or systems." 
This is confusing. 
My interpretation of 3.4 is that even one instance of an absolute value will result in failure to meet the checkpoint. 
However, the above seems to suggest that I can still meet the checkpoint provided I have tested that the output (which relies on absolute values) is usable. 
Please confirm that absolute values in a CSS file still pass checkpoint 3.4 as 
long as I've validated that the rendered content is usable. 
We're OK with relative font sizing but have yet to achieve the desired results for positioning of block elements with relative lengths and still rely on pixel widths for navigation bars etc. Regards Michael Virant Important - This email and any attachments may be confidential.

That seems to be what WCAG 1.0 is saying, as I read the checkpoint. 
Note that WCAG 2.0, which is still under development, will be much clearer in specifying the conditions that must be met in order for a checkpoint to be satisfied. 
Meanwhile, I would suggest interpreting WCAG 1.0 by looking at the purpose of the checkpoint, rather than by trying to interpret the language in a strict or pedantic fashion. 
I am in no way suggesting that you have been doing the latter; rather, I am merely indicating that when questions arise, it is best to consider the rationale of the requirement and to interpret the text accordingly. 
Of course, you are welcome to raise questions, as in this case. 
Checkpoint 3.4 is concerned to ensure that, when a user specifies a large font size in their personal style sheet or configuration settings, the document will still be rendered properly, with styles being applied correctly. 
If absolute units are used, enlarging the font will often be disastrous to the presentation. 
Thus I would suggest checking that the presentation still "works" reasonably well if the user specifies relatively large font sizes. 
If so, then (as I read the checkpoint), you will have met the requirement. 
Note: the above are my personal views and do not necessarily represent a consensus opinion on the part of the WCAG working group.

CMN Aah. 
One of those rare occasions when Jason and I disagree. 
As I read the checkpoint "Use relative rather than absolute units in markup language attribute values and style sheet property values" using absolute size values fails it. 
Michael quoted: states: "For example, in CSS, use 'em' or percentage lengths rather than 'pt' or 'cm', which are absolute units. 
If absolute units are used, validate that the rendered content is usable by checking the results on various browsers or systems." 
CMN As I read this it is going beyond the checkpoint. 
My interpretation is that if you use absolute values you fail to meet the checkpoint. 
Even if you fail to meet the checkpoint, you should try to minimise the actual problems this causes. 
(That works as a general principle - not just for this checkpoint). 
Often it is difficult to get size and positioning right in complex layouts. 
In many of these cases simplifying the layout is helpful for users, as well as for the designer trying to make their layout work accessibly. 
Complex layouts of links, especially, often arise because too much is being squeezed into one page. 
Although this helps to compensate for the fact that browsers never seem to quite manage to get bookmarks perfect (they should be more like authoring web links and less like some magic different thing, but most browsers are built on the assumption that the Web is more like TV than an interactive place for knowledge sharing), it makes pages hard to use for anyone. 
(I would cite any number of government and large corporate pages I use as a regular Australian as evidence - finding a link among 60 or 120 is difficult, and harder when they have been styled to blend into each other...) Like Jason, I am not representing any group opinion here, just my personal understanding.

I have a problem with this checkpoint then. 
I had interpreted it in the same way Jason did. 
I have to support NN 4.x in our sites and 'em' and 'small' are destroyed. 
The only way to get the sites to render identically in all browsers is with 'pt' or 'px'. 
I assumed that by checking the site by turning on the ignore colors, font sizes and styles was a good check. 
The sites look awful but still retain their structure and are usable. 
If using relative sizes is the only way to pass - then I'm unable to comply.
