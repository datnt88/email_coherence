<s> With regards to having a community process, it is heavily related to who is going to do the coding - different people working on Amaya have different priorities.  </s>
<s> That said, having some fairly open way of working out what is on the timeline as a sooner, or later, plan would be helpful, and what has been rejected.  </s>
<s> With regards to having a border, what you want to do is apply a style property, not create a table.  </s>
<s> In previous versions of Amaya the manual contained a section whicch described the various ways of marking up information available in HTML and in Amaya.  </s>
<s> (So on the top of my priority list now is finding what happened to that and working out how to rework it...) And yes, amay has a template mechanism.  </s>
<s> If you have a single template file, just save it, and then in the preferences set that as the template file.  </s>
<s> If you have half a dozen, save them all, make a link from a "template start page" (a page that lists all the templates you have, and is set as the template server for Amaya preferences), and there you are.  </s>
