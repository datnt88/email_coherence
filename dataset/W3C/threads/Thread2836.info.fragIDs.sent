<s> Hmm.  </s>
<s> I confess that I no longer remember all of the discussion behind this, but I lean towards SHOULD.  </s>
<s> Consider the request: PUT /foo.data  </s>
<s> HTTP/1.1 Host: whatever.com  </s>
<s> If-None-Match: *  </s>
<s> Content-Length: 0 The basic intent is to prevent a race condition where the origin server performs this request and overwrites an existing resource when the client didn't realize it already exists.  </s>
<s> But in the absence of that pre-existing resource, presumably we want the effect to be the same as PUT /foo.data  </s>
<s> HTTP/1.1 Host: whatever.com  </s>
<s> Content-Length: 0 Of course, I don't think we ever state whether a server SHOULD or MAY perform any arbitrary (but valid) request that it receives.  </s>
<s> MUST would be too strong - there might be resource constraints that the server needs to observe.  </s>
<s> But I think it would be unfortunate if HTTP servers started rejecting requests for essentially random reasons, and not what the average user expects, and so "SHOULD" seems like the more appropriate choice.  </s>
<s> I'll avoid commenting on whether any existing implementations do, in fact, reject requests for seemingly random reasons :-) -Jeff  </s>
<s> I think it actually is correct although the logic maybe more complex than need be: *If* there is an "If-None-Match: *" header *and* no representation exists then the server can either a) discard the "If-None-Match: *" or b) use it according to the algorithm outlined in the second paragraph above.  </s>
<s> Assuming that your example below SHOULD work, then the result should be the same.  </s>
<s> However, I am not sure that a) in fact makes sense as presumably the server would have used the existence of the "If-None-Match: *" header to check for existing representations before finding out that it could have ignored it.  </s>
<s> This is like saying: "After you have used it you may find out that you don't need it, but that's OK." Therefore, I would suggest that the first paragraph is simply removed.  </s>
<s> The second handles all cases as far as I can see.  </s>
