<s> Hi people, Could someone explain me why DOMStringList interface has no appendString() or insertString() method?  </s>
<s> Without that, DOMStringList is useful only as a method's return value and can't really be built to serve as a parameter.  </s>
<s> DOMStringList was designed to fulfill the needs of DOMConfiguration.parameternames and NodeEditVal.enumeratedValues.  </s>
<s> We had no reason to add appendString or insertString since the attributes are readonly.  </s>
<s> Philippe  </s>
<s> The CSS WG is working on the CSS Editing Object Model that reuses DOMStringList as a return argument of a new method querying classes or IDs "defined" in a given stylesheet or stylerule.  </s>
<s> That would be very cool to allow the calling code to merge DOMStringLists without having to "clone" them into an Array with an expensive chunk of code.  </s>
<s> I see nothign preventing the CSS WG from extending the DOMStringList interface to something that is a mutable list of strings, i.e. create a new interface that inherits DOMStringList and add the methods you need...  </s>
<s> jst  </s>
