Sorry, I regrets for today. 
If you need to assign me some bugs, don't esitate to do it :) The Techniques teleconference is scheduled for Wednesday, 04 June from 14:00 to 15:30 UTC (16:00 to 17:30 Central Europe/10:00 to 11:30 U.S. Eastern/7:00 to 8:30 U.S. Pacific).

After the call I realised that not all the relevant files were on the site, including the (brief) documentation. 
They are now there, and I have updated the documentation. 
To understand the approach for generating outline files you might find it useful to start with n-build.html 
Hope that helps, RI Richard Ishida W3C
