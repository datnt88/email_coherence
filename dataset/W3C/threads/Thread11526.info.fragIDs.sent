Hello Susanne, Semantic Web is an often heard word in these days, maybe you are interessted in RDF? 
It's not the shortest and not the most recent recommendation, but some people would be pleased to have that one available in German. 
As far as I can say, anything else would be fine, too. 
Just choose YOUR recommendation. 
Questions are welcome Stefan

Hello Stefan, do you mean the document: http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-rdf-syntax-19990222/ "Resource Description Framework (RDF) Model and Syntax Specification"?

Stefan, somebody was already working on RDF as part of our translations project (www.edition-w3c.de). 
I have to check the status of the translation... Kind regards, Stefan www.mintert.com

Hi Stefan, ok, I'll wait with the translation until you've checked. 
Is there some other document with RDF or about Accessibility which needs translation into German?

Hi Susanne, it has nothing to do with RDF, but another idea would be a german translation of the MathML spec. 
But this would be a very large document: Recommandation: http://www.w3.org/TR/MathML2/ Second Edition (Working darft) http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-MathML2-20030411/ 
There is a small introduction document which to have in a german version would also be very helpfull.
