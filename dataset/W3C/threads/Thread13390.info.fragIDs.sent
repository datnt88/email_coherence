<s> What about link colors?  </s>
<s> Color makes a difference.  </s>
<s> Generally, disabilities reduce sensitivity to the extremes of the light spectrum, viz.  </s>
<s> red and blue.  </s>
<s> This implies 1.There shouldn't be any red or blue on darker backgrounds, since the red and blue will get darker and reduct contast.  </s>
<s> 2.There shouldn't be any green, yellow, cyan on lighter backgrounds (because lighter backgrounds will contain some red and blue and become darker, thus reducing contrast.  </s>
<s> This is a bit of a simplification, since theoretically dark green on light green is OK.) For examples of these see search down the page for "color" For more explanation, see I don't know of any good quantitative procedures, especially for people with vision impairments.  </s>
<s> So as a rule of thumb, follow the above rules and make contrast subjectively very high for normal vision.  </s>
<s> Note that simply viewing in some arbitrary monochrome does NOT constitute a good test, since the conversion to monochrome does not necessarily show what would happen with visual impairments.  </s>
<s> Also, note that color contrast is more important for images than for BODY color, since users can override body and font color in their browsers.  </s>
<s> But they can't override colors in images.  </s>
<s> This is another reason that background images are a problem.  </s>
<s> For example,  </s>
<s> if a peson chooses light text and dark BODY, then there's a big problem if the page has a light background image.  </s>
<s> So a tool should look at images too.  </s>

<s> Len, Thanks for the suggestions.  </s>
<s> I had a look at your site and the lighthouse site and picked up some good ideas.  </s>
<s> The problem now is how do we quantify the colors.  </s>
<s> On your computer, the colors are represented by 3 values (red, green and blue) and the values range from 0 to 255.  </s>
<s> So what represents a poor visibility red?  </s>
<s> What values make up a 'dark' background?  </s>
<s> I have a small test program that allows you to modify the background and text colors and view their RGB values.  </s>
<s> I'll send you the program in a following message.  </s>
<s> If anyone else is interested in the program, let me know and I'll send it to you.  </s>
<s> Chris  </s>
<s> The values are mapped to screen intensity in a non linear way, roughly.  </s>
<s> a power function.  </s>
<s> v^gamma.  </s>
<s> To make matters more complicated, gamma is different for Mac's, PC's, and some unix machines like SGI.  </s>
<s> In addition, the allowable contrast difference depends on the size of the text.  </s>
<s> I looked at this a while back and didn't find satisfactory quantitative data, even for people with "normal" vision.  </s>
<s> We have the makings here of a good research project.  </s>
<s> At least an update on the literature search I did.  </s>
<s> Possibly some experiments.  </s>
<s> If someone wants to do a bit of research I'll be glad to dig up my old notes.  </s>
<s> Perhaps there are folks in the psychology dept up there who would like to look into this... viz. the folks in visual perception.  </s>
