<s> There was a thread recently on this list which actually looked for screen readers that could do this.  </s>
<s> It turns out that on some platforms (e.g. macintosh) it is normal that the screen readers get it right, while on others (e.g. Windows) it is normally not right (at least by default).  </s>
<s> The thread is available from the archives: I note in that that I said I would try to gather the information into a Web page - I haven't done that yet.  </s>
<s> Sorry.  </s>
<s> As for how many people stick to this, the answer is "some".  </s>
<s> The real question, surely, is how much of a problem does it cause?  </s>
<s> And the answer, surprisingly to me, seems to be "still quite a lot".  </s>
<s> Although it is getting better.. (I would have tought it would be solved by now.  </s>
<s> I think the difficulty for screen readersis that they are required to work with a wide range of different products, not just Web browsers, so the development time available for one product becomes limited.  </s>
<s> As far as I am aware, the speech solution in the Windows OS - Narrator, only available in english - is not capable of dealing with two columns of text at all yet, but I have not checked for a while).  </s>

<s> A screen reader will read across the column boundaries unless it manages to sense the blank area between columns.  </s>
<s> From what I've heard, JAWS is not a screen reader but actually accesses the document object model and may linearise the table sensibly, at least when used with IE. (I guess Windows screen readers must intercept the GDI calls that write text to the screen, as the only other alternative is OCR, albeit with consistent character shapes.  </s>
<s> As such, they will have some information about the order in which the program refreshed the screen, which may not be the logical order, even when none of the window is ever obscured and will be controlled, to some extent, by Windows, when there is an obstruction.  </s>
<s> Can anyone give some first hand knowledge here?) Accessing such a table in Lynx will also linearise it.  </s>
<s> The real problem is that tables often are not as simple as this.  </s>
<s> It's quite likely that the linearised form of a table will actually be: navigation menu, top banner and menus, real text, producing a lot of noise to be bypassed.  </s>
<s> As I remember the WCAG rules, using tables for layout is tolerated and the preferred method until browsers properly implement CSS, but the tables are required to linearise correctly, which, in my view, would probably mean giving the main text first in the above example.  </s>
<s> The leading screen readers (JAWS 3.7, Window-Eyes 4.0, etc) and speech enabled browsers (IBM Home Page Reader 3.0) do a very good job of reading tables in their logical order (cell-by-cell).  </s>
<s> As you might guess, their older versions (I'd guess more than a year and a half old...) do not.  </s>
<s> So it comes down to the difficult question of when we can "write off" the older technologies.  </s>
<s> The vast majority of screen reader-users I have worked with acutally use fairly current technology ( -- but most of my work has been in workplace settings, where the screen reader is likely purchased by the employer or state vocational rehab agency).  </s>
<s> Either way, it is becoming an increasingly difficult battle to try to convince web authors not to use tables for accessibility reasons, especially when the discussion includes demonstration of a modern screen reader.  </s>
<s> Without better support from the browsers, CSS Positioning just doesn't seem to be a practical alternative.  </s>
<s> The note on checkpoint 5.3 says "once user agents support style sheet positioning, tables should not be used for layout" -- it sure seems that today's screen readers do a better job dealing with tables (for layout) than today's browsers do with style sheet positioning.  </s>
<s> I would be interested to hear if anyone has come to any different conclusions on this issue.  </s>
