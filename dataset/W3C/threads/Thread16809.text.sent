Hello all, Recently, I was asked to come up with an accessible way to provide my organization's 'org chart' on-line. 
Traditionally, these charts have been put in PDF format, but (obviously) that poses barriers to some users. 
I've whipped up a simplified (and fictional) version of what came to mind and would love some feedback (either off-list or on) on the effectiveness of this solution. 
Any advice on better ways to do this would also be appreciated. 
The page is: This question, I think, is bigger than just org charts. 
Perhaps a broader way to phrase it is: How do you best linearize tree-like information? 
Thanks in advance!

The first thing is to ask what kind of information you are trying to convey through the chart. 
What does a sighted person get by looking at the chart. 
The next step is to figure out a linking mechanism that can most closely model eye-brain information retrieval operations (if I glance up I can find out who is at the top); if I glance to the right I find out...). 
Be careful of two-dimensional trees. 
This is my term for trees that have perhaps two kinds of hierarchical information (maybe "consists of" and "supervises". 
Can you do this with just one list of links or do you really have, in effect, two trees? 
(Of course, a tree diagram is 2d when drawn on paper or screen but I'm focusing on logical dimensionality rather than display dimensionality) For a linking mechanism, I look for: 1. 
Consistent link text - if you link by office name, use this throughout and have the same information for each office in the same order. 
2. A level by level traversal is best, (I like the model of a book: Chapter titles, Sections, subsections- if I click on Chapter 1, sections for chapter 1 only come up) 3. leaf node material should appear at the top of the page followed by nonleaf nodes( links to the next level.) 
I'm not sure if this helps. 
Some of this may be just my preference. 
Steve ITS NYSED If it is really tree-like information, then XML is an ideal way to encode it. 
You might like to use SVG to provide pictures and words together, in a way that can use CSS to present the thing in a text view. 
An example of this (but for a diagram of a network) is provide in the Note Accessibilty Features of SVG - http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG-access 
Or you might provide an XSLT transformation to produce HTML output. 
I haven't done one of those yet, although it is on my "to-do" list.
