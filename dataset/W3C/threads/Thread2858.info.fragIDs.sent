<s> First an editorial point on Rev 6 of the 1.1 spec: There seems to be a missing word in the second sentence of section 8.1.4  </s>
<s> Practical Considerations: A single-user client SHOULD NOT maintain more than connections with any server or proxy.  </s>
<s> There needs to be something between "than" and "connections".  </s>
<s> Second, I was looking through this section trying to find out if it's legal for proxies to multiplex requests from different clients on the same connection to a server.  </s>
<s> I  </s>
<s> couldn't find a clear answer in the spec or in the archives.  </s>
<s> That is given two clients A and B talking to the same server S via the same proxy P, what is minimum number of connections required.  </s>
<s> Clearly there must be a connection from A to P and from B to P. Can the proxy use just one connection to S or must it open separate connections for each client?  </s>

<s> Its's legal, but not advisable.  </s>
<s> Section 8.1.4 says A proxy SHOULD use up to 2*N connections to another server or proxy, where N is the number of simultaneously active users.  </s>
<s> It might have been a good idea to explain the reasons behind this a bit more carefully.  </s>
<s> The problem is "head-of-line blocking."  </s>
<s> Consider, in your scenario, what would happen if A makes a request that generates a really lengthy response, and then B issues a request.  </s>
<s> Because there is no packet-level multiplexing, B has to wait until A's response is fully transmitted.  </s>
<s> More concretely, suppose that A = Administrative Assistant B = Big Boss  </s>
<s> and A requests a download of, say, the latest MP3 hit just before B requests, say, a short piece of critical business information.  </s>
<s> (Not likely that these two resources would be on the same server, I guess, but this is just an example.)  </s>
<s> If we ever get a decent QoS infrastructure, this would make it even more desirable to segregate request streams from different users onto different TCP connections.  </s>

<s> I saw this, but took it to mean a recommended maximum bound, with out recommending any minimum bound.  </s>
<s> I wasn't sure if a recommended minimum would be N or 1.  </s>
<s> much more illustrative than Alice and Bob :-)  </s>
<s> So there is an ordering issue.  </s>
<s> The proxy must wait for the response before sending a request from B. Is this also the case in handling 100 Continue responses to a POST or PUT request?  </s>
<s> Must the proxy wait for the 100, and then wait again to get the body from the client, send it to the server and wait for the response before sending a request for B?  </s>
<s> Thanks.  </s>
<s> Howard  </s>
<s> Jeff, your answer deals well with the question of whether or not a proxy should pipeline requests from different clients on a single connection - that is, whether or not it should send the request from B on the same connection before the response for A has completed.  </s>
<s> I agree that for the reason you gave, this is a bad idea; but this is just a partial answer to the original question.  </s>
<s> Suppose that the proxy is 1.1, sends a request and receives a 1.1 response that does not specify 'Connection: close'.  </s>
<s> There is no reason why the proxy should not keep that now-idle connection open for a reasonable time in anticipation of another request to the same server, even if that request comes from a different client.  </s>
<s> This might often be very advantageous if the target server is a busy sight often accessed through the proxy (an upstream proxy, altavista, the corporate internal web site at HQ overseas).  </s>
<s> For this reason, origin servers should never assume that requests received on the same TCP connection are from the same user agent.  </s>
