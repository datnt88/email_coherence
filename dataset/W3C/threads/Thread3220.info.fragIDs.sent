Thanks Eric! 
I tested it today and something is still wrong. 
Not sure if it is the 
server or the Amaya version. 
I do an annotation and post it to iggy. 
Everything looks fine except that when I look the document info at annotation window it gives me a local address instead of an iggy address. 
However, when I close the annotation window the pencil icon disappears. 
Did you change the way Amaya is supposed to ask for the annotations now? 
Maybe you could check with Jose that part. 
Here is an annotation on iggy that I made with the /usr/local/Amaya/GTK/bin/amaya 
It looks OK to me in the query interface except that IE cannot open the body when I click the link (I think we had fixed this IE MIME type problem).

Eric, 
I think the problem is in my test Amaya version as I can see the annotation 
with an older stable Amaya version. 
(We did not have any problems with the 
DC 1.1 annotations even with the older servers just with the DC 1.1 replies 
that used dc properties in the query.) 
I will probably need a corrected Amaya test version before I can continue testing iggy. 
I did notice that in 
is using DC 1.0 for the creator when it uses DC 1.1 for everything else but 
while we do want to correct that to make the conversion final, the queries should still work.

I was hoping someone else would respond and clarify... but since no one 
has I'll ask: what is the DC 1.0 vs. 1.1 issue? 
Is it just a matter of the server and client working together regardless of which version of Dublic Core is used?

Thanks Jose! Amaya in swada works now. 
Tried both an annotation and a reply. 
I really appreciate you correcting this Jose. 
Too bad I did not notice it earlier. 
We have been concentrating on bookmarks so maybe the bug creeped there in some Amaya version that we did not test because there were supposed to be no changes. 
And with all the test versions we have been using it was not surprising to occasionally have problems. 
I wonder if Amaya team would be willing to add a simple annotation test for their preversion tests to prevent this in the future.

We're using somthing around DC 1.08 . 
Less flippantly, we're part way through migrating from 1.0 to 1.1 . 
The test server queries for either 1.0 or 1.1 (which inspired implementing OR which was great fun) and generates 1.0. 
The amaya client is publishing annotations with 1.1 and parses either 1.0 or 1.1 . 
After a reasonable deployment interval, we'll switch the server to generating 1.1 for the DC data that it adds.

Thanks for the detailed explanation. 
It all makes sense to me. 
It would be nice if the server could be "adaptive" and send DC 1.0 to older clients and DC 1.1 to newer clients (but I do not know how the server would know which flavor to send).
