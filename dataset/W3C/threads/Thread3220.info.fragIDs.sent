<s> I tested it today and something is still wrong.  </s>

<s> I do an annotation and post it to iggy.  </s>
<s> Everything looks fine except that when I look the document info at annotation window it gives me a local address instead of an iggy address.  </s>
<s> However, when I close the annotation window the pencil icon disappears.  </s>
<s> Did you change the way Amaya is supposed to ask for the annotations now?  </s>
<s> Maybe you could check with Jose that part.  </s>
<s> Here is an annotation on iggy that I made with the /usr/local/Amaya/GTK/bin/amaya  </s>
<s> It looks OK to me in the query interface except that IE cannot open the body when I click the link (I think we had fixed this IE MIME type problem).  </s>

<s> (We did not have any problems with the  </s>

<s> Is it just a matter of the server and client working together regardless of which version of Dublic Core is used?  </s>

<s> Thanks Jose! Amaya in swada works now.  </s>
<s> Tried both an annotation and a reply.  </s>
<s> I really appreciate you correcting this Jose.  </s>
<s> Too bad I did not notice it earlier.  </s>
<s> We have been concentrating on bookmarks so maybe the bug creeped there in some Amaya version that we did not test because there were supposed to be no changes.  </s>
<s> And with all the test versions we have been using it was not surprising to occasionally have problems.  </s>
<s> I wonder if Amaya team would be willing to add a simple annotation test for their preversion tests to prevent this in the future.  </s>
<s> Marja  </s>
<s> We're using somthing around DC 1.08 .  </s>
<s> Less flippantly, we're part way through migrating from 1.0 to 1.1 .  </s>
<s> The test server queries for either 1.0 or 1.1 (which inspired implementing OR which was great fun) and generates 1.0.  </s>
<s> The amaya client is publishing annotations with 1.1 and parses either 1.0 or 1.1 .  </s>
<s> After a reasonable deployment interval, we'll switch the server to generating 1.1 for the DC data that it adds.  </s>

<s> Thanks for the detailed explanation.  </s>
<s> It all makes sense to me.  </s>
<s> It would be nice if the server could be "adaptive" and send DC 1.0 to older clients and DC 1.1 to newer clients (but I do not know how the server would know which flavor to send).  </s>
