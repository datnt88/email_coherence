<s> Split+Join is described as follows in Here the process consists of concurrent execution of a bunch of process components with barrier synchronization.  </s>
<s> With SPLIT and SPLIT+JOIN, we can define processes that have partial synchronization (e.g., split all and join some sub-bag).  </s>
<s> For some reason, I'm having trouble understanding that.  </s>
<s> There doesn't seem to be a separate Join, so how do you "split all and join some sub-bag"?  </s>

<s> Does that mean there's no OWL-S syntax that corresponds to the above semantics?  </s>
<s> In the document about OWL-S surface syntax, it says (Split+Join List-of-processes) executes all the processes in the List-of-processes in parallel, then waits until all complete before proceeding.  </s>

<s> Jeff - It seems to me that's what it means - and I appreciate your pointing this out.  </s>
