<s> I'm not sure it is legal or not but I have added the folowing in a style sheet file: body {xml:lang="fr"; lang="fr"} Then I linked it to my html document.  </s>
<s> But, the spell checker is still working with english.  </s>
<s> It's work fine with the style atribute of body in the page itself.  </s>
<s> I'm runing Amaya 5.2 on win 98.  </s>
<s> And by the way, is there any development made to suport CSS float and clear?  </s>
<s> It's often useful to make the text folow the side of an image.  </s>
<s> Hi Alex, The language should be an attribute of the body element and not a CSS property.  </s>
<s> If you define the body element this way body xml:lang="fr" lang="fr" the Amaya spell checker will use the French dictionary.  </s>
<s> Not yet.  </s>
<s> Tankyou.  </s>
<s> I should have notice that this property wasn't part of the style attribute.  </s>
<s> CSS is used so often in Amaya that I made a mistake.  </s>
<s> By the way, my email adress wasn't correct on my first post it's alex.jasmin@sympatico.ca  </s>
