Betreff: Re: Update on namespaces Likewise namespace prefixes; those who want to put a disambiguating prefix in front of GIs and attribute names can do so in their applications. 
Neither approach needs explicit support from general-purpsose XML parsers, so neither one needs to be enshrined in the XML spec, Prinicpial agreed but there is one argument we can?t ignore: Defining a nampace separator now opens the way for a future approach of minimizing element names by automatic prefixing the namespace depending on whatever (AF, DTD ...)

A namespace separator was defined by WG8 5-6 years ago for the revision of ISO 9070. 
It is "::". 
Please don't expect WG8 to adopt an alternative one just to please the XML ERB. Martin Bryan, 29 Oldbury Orchard, Churchdown, Glos.

For details about the Open Information Interchange initiative contact Uh, for those who don't have it at the front of their minds, that would be: ISO/IEC 9070:1991 Information technology -- SGML support facilities -- Registration procedures for public text owner identifiers The relevance of this particular standard is open to question. 
Furthermore, if this is something that is going to be used as part of SGML markup (which it clearly is, sitting in the middle of the GI) then self-evidently the syntax must be abstract, there must be a role for this, NMSPPFX, or some such, which we can make concrete as ':', right? 
-T. 
It defines ISO's formal rules for structured naming of objects. 
Obviously this is of no interest to the XML ERB, even though it was developed by WG8. 
We all know by now that the ERB has nothing to do with applying ISO rules! 
In a minute you will notice that nearly (if not) every example of structured namespaces produced by a member of WG8 that has been placed on this list uses :: rather than : - I wonder why? 
Any guesses what the WG8 panel are likely to assign as the default to NMSPPFX? Martin Bryan, 29 Oldbury Orchard, Churchdown, Glos.
