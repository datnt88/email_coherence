I doubt there will ever be a version of mIRC for OS X. Xchat aqua, is the best freeware irc app available for OS X. r|0|0|t I use JediKnight which seems to be pretty good.

Check out the mac OS X page on the IRC help site -- pointers to a several cheap shareware ircs. 
Mozilla also includes chatzilla, a good bare bones irc with a few nice features (create irc channels as bookmarks for your browser) and many people who use X11 for their Macs use Xchat aqua, esp. 
to get through firewalls (has good proxying). 
There's also the open source beta of mchat I haven't used it myself, but have heard it recommended as a simple way to get started (also several others on the macosx download site) so no excuse not to get irc'ed... Professor James Hendler hendler@cs.umd.edu
