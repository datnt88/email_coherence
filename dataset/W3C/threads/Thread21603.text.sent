I've now read through Part 2. Here is a list of the things I noted, in the order they appear in the spec. 
Gudge 1.Section 1 The language we use for bullet 4 doesn't match the other bullets 2.Section 2.1 "this, if any" should read "thus, if any" 3.Section 3.1.1 
We should put a cross-ref to Part 1 at the end of numbered bullet 2. 4.Section 3.1.6 
"considered to be of unspecified size" should read "considered to have a single dimension of unspecified size" 5.Section 3.1.7 
For consistency we should say the type is enc:valueType 6.Section 4 We should drop "only" from "not limited only to the SOAP HTTP Binding" 7.Section 4.2.2 First bullet should be removed ( left over text ) 8.Section 4.2.2 The numbered bullets use the term 'terminal node', but that term no longer exists in the data model. 
We should rewrite in terms of nodes with a lexical value. 
9.Section 4.4 The language in the numbered bullets doesn't seem consistent with other language concerning infoset items 10.Section 5.1.1 
First bullet has an example which is a QName ( should be a URI ) 11.Section 5.1.2 Diagram. 
Should the cloud with "Net" in it read "Network"? 
Overall status: all done except 8 and 9. Match is now slightly better Already done done done done done Alredy done NOT DONE NOT DONE Already fixed (example removed) I can live with "Net" but not a biggie Henrik Marc and I went through the remaining of Gudge's issues for Part 2 and here's what we think we (spec editors) need to do: Pending Gudge's recovery Add text to the first occurance of "Value of Code" as in part 1. Henrik Frystyk Nielsen "considered to have that term no consistent with Status: 8 is still pending Gudge's recovery. 
Otherwise done done Henrik Frystyk Nielsen
