<s> Hi Nikki, I completely agree.  </s>
<s> So now I think nodes types as 'soks:Concept' should NOT be allowed to have a language property.  </s>
<s> ONLY the labels should be allowed to have a language property/tag.  </s>
<s> Representing non-exact equivalence relationships between concepts derived from different languages is then covered by whatever we end up doing for inter-thesaurus concept mapping.  </s>
<s> This does have consequences for constraining the data model.  </s>
<s> It means a node typed as a 'soks:Concept' must then be allowed to have multiple 'soks:descriptor' properties, one for each language.  </s>
<s> Is it then possible in OWL to express the constraint that a concept may have one and only one 'soks:descriptor' property for each language?  </s>
<s> If not, can we live with  </s>

<s> Hi Alistair My philosophical angle on this is: Human society distinguishes itself from (the rest of) animal society by its reification of abstract concepts, done primarily via language.  </s>
<s> So the concepts don't come from the language, they exist independently - languages evolve in the attempt to articulate human understanding of abstract concepts.  </s>
<s> Different languages have evolved over time of course, and have much in common, but also some languages have sought to reify concepts that other languages don't, and so on... Coming back to the question of a pragmatic solution to modelling multilingual data: I tend towards Option 2, but then I've not experimented with much 'real' data, so you might want to give me some illustrative counter examples.  </s>
<s> Is it not the case that the *concepts* being reified by one language can be mapped - partially or otherwise - to concepts being reified in another language?  </s>
<s> And if there are "missing" concepts for some languages then that's ok? i.e. is it possible to always map thesauri at the conceptual level as opposed to at the 'label' level?  </s>
<s> I know this means deriving concept hierarchies from thesauri from thesauri that don't have this explicit - but I thought that was what we were aiming for anyway?  </s>

<s> I've added this issue to the discussion on the RDF Thesaurus wiki page http://esw.w3.org/topic/RdfThesaurus  </s>
<s> Here is a summary:- Issue 4 - Concepts as language-embedded, language independent, or both?  </s>
<s> There are multilingual thesauri.  </s>
<s> When modelling multilingual data in RDF, we can choose one of the following options: Option 1: Concepts in a language - allow language properties only on nodes typed as Concepts.  </s>
<s> Option 2: Labels in a language - allow language properties (or tags) only on nodes (or literals) which represent labels.  </s>
<s> Option 3: And/or - allow concepts and/or labels to have language properties.  </s>
<s> The choice of solution has bold implications.  </s>
<s> If we choose option 1 we are assuming that all abstract concepts are embedded in a language; there can be no language independent concepts.  </s>
<s> If we choose option 2 we can model only concepts that are deemed to be 'language-independent'.  </s>
<s> If we choose option 3 we can represent both language-embedded and language-independent concepts, however there may be some considerable scope for confusion.  </s>

<s> Only if you represent content-in-a-specific-language as a class, which would mean having a different class and different cardinality constraint for every language.  </s>
<s> Which probably wouldn't be workable.  </s>
<s> But in any case you need to add the qualifier "in any given conceptual scheme".  </s>
<s> That definitely makes expressing the cardinality constraint in OWL unworkable.  </s>

<s> Hi Alistair and Dave,  </s>
<s> I've been trying to consider some options here: 1. throw out the 'descriptor' cardinality constraint for multilingual thesauri (as well as for/as distinct from monolingual thesauri?) and don't worry about it - live with it, &amp; provide recommendation of use instead.  </s>
<s> 2. model multilingual thesauri in a specific way: express each language's interpretation of a concept uniquely by giving the same concept different uri's in each of the languages in question.  </s>
<s> Then map the concepts (using "owl:equivalentTo").  </s>
<s> That way we could still specify exactly 1 preferred label/'descriptor' per concept.  </s>
<s> Does it upset us to give different uri's to what certain communities believe to be the same concept?  </s>
<s> I guess how inferencing is then conducted over the thesaurus data (for queries) is then critical &amp; I haven't thought about this in any depth.  </s>
<s> Therefore I'm not sure if this approach is currently "legal".  </s>
<s> 3. Subclass 'soks:Concept' with what we'd understand to be concepts in the context of a particular language.  </s>
<s> I think this is similar to what Dave is referring to?  </s>
<s> And yes, it feels cranky: e.g. 'soks:Concept' 'soks:English_concept' Then we'd potentially have multiple properties (e.g. soks:english_language_concept, soks:japenese_language_concept etc.) hanging off any one 'soks:Concept' in a thesaurus schema.  </s>
<s> [I guess 'soks:english_language_concept' has domain 'soks:Concept' and range 'soks:English_concept' ....] Using this approach, we can keep the cardinality constraint = 1 for 'soks:descriptor' properties (because there would be one for each of 'soks:English_concept', 'soks:Japenese_concept', etc)?  </s>
<s> [I suppose 'soks:English_concept' could be further subclassed for American_english etc.] However, typically, one then feels that further constraints are now required to protect data integrity.  </s>
<s> Such as a constraint that the 'descriptor' property value for any [Language]_concept must be in the same language as that [Language]_concept bla bla.  </s>
<s> Hmmm ... :-) Nikki  </s>
