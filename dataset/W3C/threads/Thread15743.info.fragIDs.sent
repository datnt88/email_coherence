I'm increasingly concerned with the high technical level of stylesheet proficiency that we seem to be requiring for people to create accessible web pages. 
The problem is that the way the guidelines are written (and this is improved on current rewrites -- but not necessarily enough to solve the problem!), you need to have detailed knowledge of HTML and some CSS experience in order to make an accessible web page. 
Sad to say, this cuts out over half of the people currently designing web pages! 
Stylesheets alone are a confusing new concept to anyone who hasn't tried them -- and that may be enough for them to decide, "accessibility is too hard -- I can't do stylesheets, I don't know what an OBJECT is or even what the difference between a 'tag' and an 'element' is -- so I won't even bother to try to make accessible pages!" 
I'm currently teaching an accessibility course for the HTML Writers Guild's online classes, and that was one of the comments from a student. 
In addition, the Guild's AGI project found that 38% of the respondents thought there was too much HTML 4.0 technical knowledge necessary to understand the guidelines (April 14 version), and 54% -- over half -- were turned off by the emphasis on stylesheets! 
Now, as someone who knows HTML 4.0 pretty well himself, and is decent with stylesheets, I can understand entirely why those need to be part of guidelines, and why they're good and useful features to use when designing web pages. 
But I'm also an expert at this, and do this for a living -- and not everyone falls into that category. 
However, those people still need to make accessible pages! 
Web accessibility is not only for the advanced authors, it something _everyone_ should know! 
But, of course, there's the problem -- how to communicate _only_ what the beginner needs to know, without making them think that's all they'll _ever_ have to understand about accessibility. 
Has anyone dealt with this problem before? 
Do you have a nicely written, "stable", newbie-friendly document that touches on the basics of accessible web design, without overwhelming the casual author with LONGDESC and CSS2 and other unfamiliar concepts? 
If so, can I have a URL? :) If not, am I volunteering myself for more work?

Amen, in general things are getting too complex. 
We need to look at the 80/20 rule and figure out what simple things can be done to make web pages as accessible as possible with the least amount of effort!

Kynn: You may be interested in a free online workshop on accessible curriculum design which we are offering through the Adaptive Technology Resource Centre at U of Toronto. 
The purpose of the three week workshop is to provide a user-friendly introduction to the functioning of adaptive tech, basics of accessible HTML, with optional resources for those who are readly for more. 
I am still working on the content of the course, but it will up on Oct. 13. 
The URL for info on this, and our other online courses related to special education is: We also have an accessible web design service, called Web-Savvy, and have posted a summary list of the WAI standards which we are using as design guidelines. 
This is not a learning tool, but rather a short list of all accessibility standards, divided into "Required Protocols" (Priority 1), or "Recommended Protocols" (Priority 2, 3). 
The "Research and Development" section of the ATRC web site also provides some good summary information on accessible web design: Hope this helps!
