Hi, For some months now I have been reading with great interest the debate that has raged. 
Quite frankly I haven't participated before because someone else usually had the same viewpoint. 
The issue of multiple versions of a page has however seemed to be missing 1 point. 
If you have already covered this, then I apologise - just ignore this email. 
Focusing on abilities is better than focusing on disabilities. 
It's important to remember that very often particularly if the disability is intellectual or cognitive, that it is accompanied by other disabilities. 
For example, my son has Down Syndrome, autism, a moderate hearing loss and probably photo-sensitive epilepsy. 
He also has no depth perception and requires glasses to read. 
All I'm really saying is - consider the possibility of more than one disability. 
Easier said than done I know - since I don't know how to program for that either. 
It's nice to finally talk to you all and thank you for the significant effort you are all putting in to helping people like my son. Lee Otto Lee Otto ASPECT Ph: (02) 6245 8133 MIMEsweeper has been used to check this email for security 
Hi, Perhaps, one possibility is that there was an initial assumption was that the best approach to web page accessibility was for there to be only one version of a web page. 
This could be an example of a chosen value limiting analysis of alternative approaches.

I am sure there are some "reasonably obvious" groupings. 
Why aren't they documented anywhere? 
If this thread is to make any further progress, someone needs to write a proposal related to the guidelines. 
Here is what we know so far: 1. Server-side techniques are already being worked on. 
Those who are interested, but not already involved, should contact Wendy Chisholm wendy@w3.org 
to coordinate. 
2. It is agreed by everyone involved that server-side techniques will have an impact upon the nature of our conformance scheme, most significantly in determining how content for which multiple versions exist can satisfy the guidelines and how a conformance claim should be scoped to ensure that the information it provides regarding the accessibility of the content is useful and accurate. 
Does anybody want to write a proposal in relation to either or both of these issues? 
Are there any other issues in this area that ought to be discussed? 
If so, how do they affect the guidelines? 
This probably already is included in the second point of your agenda, but I would add to the list as a reminder that we should also examine the use of good techniques for storing and updating the content and keeping track which data is related so that it becomes less easy to update content in one version and forget to update it in another. 
For instance, the content should be taken from the same source whenever possible for all the versions and CSS and different transformations e.g. table linearizer may be used to modify the presentation and interaction if needed. 
Furthermore, if sound track is replaced the designer should be warned to check the accuracy of related captions and if an image is replaced the designer is given the places referring to it in the main text body that should be checked. 
In these cases the user writing the document has defined (hopefully with a good tool) which caption is related to which soundtrack or which places in the text explain the image. 
Always providing one version where the maximum amount of interaction flexibility (for all disabilities) is available is probably a good idea. 
The user can then optimize it himself or herself with some fine tuning as users do right now. 
The other versions mainly provide selected user groups an easy, ready made optimization.
