I would like to know if you can answer the following questions. 
1. Do you have an RMP for the new release of AMAYA We plan to have it soon. 
2. When I run amaya in the LINUX-ELF/bin directiory the amaya page appears but I can not acess any of the functions? 
What I am doing wrong. 
Something was wrong during the building of the Linux version. 
So we had republished this version end of July. 
Could you check if the problem persists with this new version. 
Regards Irene. 
What is the executable file name for your browser? 
Thanks- Greg Linton (glinton@usa.net)

That depends of the platform you are working on * Thot/archi/bin/amaya on Unix platforms * Thot/WINNT/bin/amaya.exe on Windows platform Regards Irene.
