Looking for EOWG testers We will get more people to test this once we circulate it for broader review, with more background, shortly, but can a few EOWG members volunteer to give the Preliminary Review a preliminary test over the next few days? 
The idea would be to take what's written at pretend that's all you knew about evaluating Web sites, and that you'd never used or downloaded these tools before, and try to follow the process, step by step, writing down comments about anything that's confusing or annoying. 
[See also the questions below, as possible ways to focus your comments] Thanks, - Judy EOWG: FOR COMMENT PLEASE I have updated the "Preliminary Review" section of Evaluating Web Sites according to today's change requests Please reply on list to the following questions AND/OR raise other comments (I'm going to send separate thread-starters for the other sections of the document, but if in doubt, go ahead and raise comments wherever on EOWG list) - is the tone of intro paragraph better now? 
- is the representative sampling of pages ok w/ the entry page added? 
- I moved the note about reviewers with disabilities sometimes needing to pair up (to second step of preliminary review); does that work? 
- in the sub-list of five "browser tricks," are the instructions about what to do clear and useful? 
- I added a note about "experienced users of screen readers" in step #3, with a little bit of caution in different directions, to try to work in what Carlos was saying since this seems to be a way to fit it in even in the preliminary review - for a "preliminary review," I'm assuming it is not necessary to add a summary/reporting step, since this is really focused on a "do-it-yourself-without-getting-up-from-your-desk approach, and the intended audience is probably the person doing the review. 
Unless it makes sense to briefly advise the reviewer how to sum up the results of the preliminary review, e.g. something like "5. Summarize review results, being careful to emphasize that this is a preliminary review only and not a determination of conformance level" -- reactions? 
- other comments on preliminary review section of this document? 
Thanks, - Judy Judy Brewer jbrewer@w3.org +1.617.258.9741 http://www.w3.org/WAI Director, Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) International Program Office World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) MIT/LCS Room NE43-355, 200 Technology Square, Cambridge, MA, 02139, USA Judy, Having done these kinds of evaluations before (for Qwest) I know that lots of people don't know how to turn off images, increase font sizes, etc. on their browser, and that every browser has the commands/instructions located in different menus and calls them different things (for example in Netscape you turn images off in preferences, but in iE you unselect the show pictures option on the advanced tab of the Internet options pop-up). 
I also know that I forget between times I do it and waste a lot of time rediscovering the process... 
So I think there should be more instructions for how to do the things that we are telling users to do: turn off images, change the font size (larger and smaller) in the browser, turn off the sound, and change the display color to black and white. 
The instructions will have to be browser specific - so I guess we have to decide how many browsers we want to give directions for. 
Maybe this could be hyperlinked (Ex: link = for instructions for testing your web page with X browser). 
Am I the only one who has difficulty remembering how to do these things? 
Lila Lila, I too forget and fumble. 
It looks like you have a good start to a worthwhile resource. 
Since WAI should not be exclusionary, the set of expected behaviors should be taken, say from the UAAG, and the request made to any browser supplier to describe how that behavior is achieved in the form of instructions for achieving it. 
The advantage of inviting the supplying vendors is so we can be as inclusive as we get contributions, and not leave anyone out. 
As we advertise that we are making a comparative document, I believe that the vendors will want to be properly included. 
Note that such a document is transitory, with need for updates as products get updated. 
That too is to the vendor's advantage, if we provide a means to make new versions. 
The problem of non-standard names for the desired effect suggests that the WCAG/UAAG checkpoint text have its alternative if any given for each browser. 
Browser suppliers should be invited to augment a starting list of these, contributed however incompletely by anyone who has the experience and organization to pull it off. 
The WCAG, ATAG, and forthcoming UAAG guidelines have associated "techniques" showing that some implementation is feasible for each checkpoint. 
There is no requirement that the method to meet a checkpoint is described for all browsers/AT. 
A place for vendor input could well be the User Agent Accessibility Guidelines Techniques document. 
This is expected to be changed more often than the Guidelines themselves. 
An answer from a browser supplier could be "depends on/requires some attached assistive technology." 
Descriptions of methods can be convoluted, depending on interdependent user settings and author/source desires. 
For example the style cascade of CSS2. 
Example: Description of some capabilities, such as font size, are treated differently: IE: Smallest, Smaller, Medium, Larger, Largest The default seems further adjusted by styles, say for hN. 
Accepts absolute font sizes, in keeping with the desire to round-trip from MS Word without loss of presentation. 
Not sure of precedence among explicitly included size in the document, stylesheets, and user preferences. 
Not sure of persistence across loaded documents with and without stylesheets or explicit size in document markup. 
Opera: 21 percentage choices, 20% to 1000%, setting persists for new loaded document. 
NSC 4.74: smaller: Ctrl-[ larger: Ctrl-] unlimited? 
sizes, setting persists onto new loaded document. 
May not affect content with specified font sizes. 
Regards/Harvey Lila, I agree that it would be helpful to have such information available, via a link. 
I'm concerned about the effort to put it together, and would not want that to delay making the general resource available. 
Perhaps the EOWG document is not the place to try to specify exactly how to perform each section of an evaluation, but rather the ERT WG might come up with parallel information as they make progress on naming specific techniques to test each WCAG 1.0 checkpoint. 
Harvey, Given that we have had considerable difficulty, with considerable effort expended, getting browser developers to respond to basic questions of user agent support for accessibility features mentioned in WCAG 1.0, I am pessimistic about getting response to these more detailed questions about configurations across multiple browser products and versions.
