Hi folks, A configuration parameter lets users follow a link with a simple click or a 
double click. 
As Rick asked do you think we have to set "simple click" by default? 
Irene, I've just compiled Amaya on my linux box for the second time. 
This time I gave it more of a chance, I've discovered that the default action for a link is a double click. 
The last time I tried it (Being the impatient one that I am) I assumed that the URLS just didn't work. 
Then I had a problem with the X file browser because I kept double clicking on it and for a bit (again, my dimmness) I thought I was having a problem with it. 
Now that I realize that it's a functional peice of software I've taken the trouble to set the user preference to single click and it works the same as everything else. 
Anyway, my suggestion is that you change Amaya to default to single click activation so that it works like everything else out of the box. 
Unless you're trying to fllter out the numbskulls like myself that is. 
Cheers! 
Rick.

Well, there is a problem here. 
Amaya used as an editor makes the single click annoying. 
Since the average WYSIWYG editor (Amaya, GoLive, Composer, Dreamweaver, probably others) has the components to be a proper browser, with extended editing functionality, I would prefer not to dumb them down to the level of the more limited offerings that are browser-only. 
On the other hand the use of double click in a real browser is "a little" uncommon, so it should probably be made very clear right at the beginning - something like "How is Amaya special" on the standard splash page, as well as in the help files. 
Much as I think it is reasonable to pick on Rick in particular (just joking Rick ;-) the more helpful we are to new users in explaining how amaya works, the better their first experience will be. 
(The other key point is for editing: "Escape / F2 is your friend" is one of the best things I ever learned about Amaya, although I wish the key was the same across platforms). 
cheers Charles

Bonjour, 
a 
IMHO, yes, it would be better... Hoping this help, Guy Capra, 
I think the default startup should be browser mode/single click. 
Amaya should switch to double click mode automatically when user selects edit mode. 
Bill. 
By default the edit mode is selected because Amaya is mainly an editor. 
Probably we can set the single click when a browser profile is selected. 
In other cases the edit mode is attached to a document and can be different for different displayed documents. 
Irene.
