Accidentally caught by the spam filter. 
- Jim Looks like, MS-Explorer treat each resource with not empty DAV:resourcetype as collection. 
For example, if resource type is this version is displayed as folder. 
Does anybody knows how to solve the problem and make this version visible as normal file (not folder) in MS-Explorer? 
Thanks in advance, Konstantin mailto:KKnizhnik@togetherlab.com a) AFAIK, there's no workaround for this particular problem in Microsoft's compliant. 
Keep complaing to them. 
b) But: why are you trying to specify a resourcetype of DAV:version at the first place? 
That's not in RFC3253... 
Not only is DAV:version as a resourcetype not in RFC-3253, it is explicitly forbidden in RFC-3253 (the DAV:resourcetype of a version must be the same as the DAV:resourcetype of the version-controlled resource that was checked in to create it). 
And also note that this one done to some extent with the WebFolders problem in mind ... In particular RFC-3253 only gives non-null DAV:resourcetype values to resources that have no content (which means that it should cause no problem to have them be treated as "folders" by WebFolders).

We have to use DAV in our application so I am searching abt it on google and got few links but can anyone let me know more abt it or can you send me any other links which are good .

The WebDAV working group site also has a wealth of information: But, since you've done a Google search, you undoubtedly have already found these pages... - Jim Behalf Of Hiren Shah-SSI Hi, I am totally new to DAV.
