I'm udpating an "Interpreter Services" form on our website and part of that is adding in TABINDEX as a feature. 
The problem I'm having is when testing my TABS, I get down to RADIO buttons and instead of tabbing in order, it jumps to the top of the page to our office email address. 
I'm using this format: TD WIDTH="150" INPUT TYPE="RADIO" NAME="branch" VALUE="army" TABINDEX="6" Army /TD TD WIDTH="150" INPUT TYPE="RADIO" NAME="branch" VALUE="navy" TABINDEX="7" Navy /TD TD WIDTH="150" INPUT TYPE="RADIO" NAME="branch" VALUE="air_force" TABINDEX="8" Air Force /TD ( I also tried using just one TABINDEX for the entire set) Thanks Scott Scott M.

This is the way it should work.
