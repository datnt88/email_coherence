Is anyone aware of any groups tracking commercial take up of semantic web technology? 
Some of the applications we included in our applications survey report were commercial but I sure there are lots more that weren't covered in that. 
In particular, I was intrigued to notice this quote in an Interweek article on the Semantic Web: "But W3C spokeswoman Janet Daly said RDF technologies are in use today by AOL Time Warner Inc., Hearst Corp. and LexisNexis. 
" Anyone know what any of these people are using RDF for?

AOL Time Warner Inc. has, I believe, Some RDF capacity in its browser, "Netscape". 
(You've probably heard of it :) I don't know anything more useful than that, but since the three groups do things like dealig with documents which can be in multiple forms that might be their real use...

Yep, the only one I know anything about is the Mozilla/Netscape RDF implementation, which was the first RDF implementation out there and is probably the one on most desktops, even if folk don't realise it. 
I don't know about the others. 
I'll ask... Dan 
With respect to you specific question, these companies are using PRISM [1][2] to facilitate the exchange of publishers content.

With respect to your more general question on tracking commercial uptake of semantic web technolgies, I am (as best as possible). 
However some 
RDF based tools for facilitating this 'cataloging' process and allowing for this to be more of a collaborative effort would be extremely helpful (wink wink nudge nudge :).

Thanks Eric - I should have read the Primer more closely! 
Excellent. 
Its possible the RDF schema and formatting tools we used for our SWAD-E report [*] could be useful. 
It'd take a bit of work to make them user friendly though. 
When (if!) my current work crisis abates it'd be fun to think about this.
