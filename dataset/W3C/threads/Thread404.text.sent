I'm getting 'Text exceeds memo capacity' errors from Tidy. 
Is there a fix for this? 
I also want to change the default settings for Tidy. 
Could someone explain in *very simple terms* how I set the environmental variable HTML_TIDY in Windows 98 please. 
What exactly do I need to type and in which file? 
Frank I use Win2k here at work, so these directions for Win98 are just off the top of my head ;). 
But, I'm pretty sure they're right. 
And, though these steps should work fine, it's possible that there is also a GUI-way of doing this in Win98 as well. 
1. 
Using Notepad.exe, open "autoexec.bat" in your root directory. 
For instance, if you boot off of C:, the file to open would be "C:\autoexec.bat". 
If that file doesn't exist on your system, just open Notepad anyway. 
2. Scroll to the bottom of the file and add a new line such as the following, without the quotes: "SET HTML_TIDY=C:\Progra~1\tidy\tidy.cfg". 
I chose to use 8-letter version of "Program Files" because I'm not sure of the syntax for environment variables with long filenames. 
If someone knows the "real syntax" for long filenames in environment variables, please post :). 3. That's it. 
Just save the file, and reboot your PC (this is necessary only because autoexec.bat is only run on startup). 
Also, if in step #1 you didn't have an "autoexec.bat" 
(and you had to open Notepad anyway), just be sure to now save the file as "autoexec.bat" 
in your root directory (such as c:\autoexec.bat). 
But, be sure to use the quotes around the filename when you save! 
They're to get around a "feature" of Notepad -- it automatically adds ".txt" to filenames for you, unless you use quote-marks in the File-Save dialog box :-/. 
Also, here're the steps for Win2k/NT4: 1. Open Control Panel, and load "System". 
2. Goto the "Advanced" tab and click on "Environment Variables" 3. In the "System Variables" section, click on "New" 4. For "Variable Name" enter "HTML_TIDY" (without the quotes). 
5. For "Variable Value" enter the path such as "C:\Program Files\tidy\tidy.cfg" (without the quotes). 
For Win2k/NT4, long filenames are ok (that's how I'm doing it, and it works fine). 
6. Choose the "Ok" button until you're out of Control Panel 7. A reboot is not necessary with these operating systems IIRC. 
PS Frank: It's possible that Win98 now has some kind of GUI for setting environment variables, as Win2k/NT does (but I haven't used Win95/98 in ages, so I have no idea). 
So, feel free to go through the Win2k/NT steps above, if you're curious.

Hi folks, As (nearly) always in programming, there are different ways to get to the same result... But I don't think that hacking the system startup files is an excellent idea. 
On my behalf, I'd prefer creating "ad hoc" "bat" files, as I did before getting rid if the Micro$oft systems. 
You don't need to reboot the system, and you simply declare the HTML_TIDY variable at the very moment you need it, then "undeclare it" just afterwards. 
So your "personalized_tidy.bat" file may look like this : SET HTML_TIDY="this_is_your_html_tidy_value" rem declare the html_tidy variable your_tidy_path\tidy.exe %1 -your_tidy_command_line_options rem run tidy with the html_tidy variable set by invoking: rem "personalized_tidy.bat 
yourpath\yourfile.htm" 
SET HTML_TIDY="" rem unset the html_tidy variable So, you can open an MSDOS window, execute the .BAT 
file and "that's all folks" ;-) By the way, you can create lots of different .bat 
files as you see fit, e.g. a "tidy_to_html_4_but_not_clean.bat" file, a "tidy_xml_output.bat" 
file, or a "tidy_no_warnings.bat" 
file etc.... as many as you need... 
I think this method will work on all M$Windows releases. 
The only problem to be aware of is that your .BAT files and the TIDY.EXE program MUST NOT have the same name, if they reside in the same directory. 
If you have a directory which contains "tidy.exe" 
*AND* "tidy.bat" , invoking "tidy" will execute the "tidy.exe" 
file (i.e. all options set to "default"), *NOT* the "tidy.bat" 
file.

- TUX powered ;-) Or, if you happen to go the route of a separate batch file (as mentioned above), you could just run Tidy by typing "tidy.bat", which would work even if your batch file has the same name as your Tidy executable file. 
Additionally, I can see Norbert's point of avoiding messing with your system files. 
If you're concerned about that, you could always make a backup of your autoexec.bat 
file before making changes to it (you could copy it to another directory, for instance). 
But, on the other hand, Norbert's method still works, so if you want to use it, that's fine.
