<s> Jacob, you're so close.  </s>
<s> If you'd just stop assuming the conclusion you'd get it.  </s>
<s> "How can the contents of that section be interoperability tested?  </s>
<s> Exactly why is such a section allowed, even though it cannot be interoperability tested?"  </s>
<s> Two different implementations must be able to correctly parse obsolete messages.  </s>
<s> Implementations should never generate those messages.  </s>
<s> The easiest way to do the test (and hopefully every MUA vendor will do this) is  </s>
<s> simply to telnet to port 25 and feed in the obsolete message from the example.  </s>
<s> Thus, the obsolete section would be interoperability tested if both implementations produced the same parsed message.  </s>
<s> There is no requirement for interoperability on generation, and in fact, MUAs are required NOT to generate such messages.  </s>
<s> Thus, your second sentence doesn't  </s>
<s> follow.  </s>
<s> If this still seems unclear, I would reread the whole thread and reread section 4.1.2 in RFC 2026.  </s>

<s> You keep coming back to this notion that a conformance specification can somehow defeat the interoperability requirements.  </s>
<s> This just isn't true.  </s>
<s> A protocol can say what it likes about what it means for an implementation to be conformant.  </s>
<s> But this has no effect on interoperability requirements at all.  </s>
<s> I am just trying to understand the IETF rules for moving a standard from proposed to draft status.  </s>
<s> I do understand that the base requirement is still, that moving a standard from proposed to draft requires that there are two implementations based on different code base which can interoperate using every feature in the standard.  </s>
<s> And I do now understand that this rule is only valid for every single feature, not for any combination of features, and not for an arbitrary number of recursive application of the same feature.  </s>
<s> But I still have the impression that there are exemptions from this, that there are certain things you can say in a standards document which is exempt from the interoperability requirement.  </s>
<s> But I do not quite understand which features are exempt in this way.  </s>
<s> In particular, how can a standard ever specify a requirement only for receipt, if all requirements must be interoperability tested?  </s>
<s> Surely interoperability testing requires that systems can both receive and generate a certain format?  </s>
<s> For example, the drums msgfmt document has a list of things you should be able to receive but should not generate (the obsoleted features section).  </s>
<s> How can the contents of that section be interoperability tested?  </s>
<s> Exactly why is such a section allowed, even though it cannot be interoperability tested?  </s>
<s> Is it because the section is labelled "obsolete", because the section is labelled "for receipt only" or why?  </s>
<s> Take ICMP as an example from an entirely different area.  </s>
<s> ICMP defines a bunch of different sorts of messages, quite a few of which are only used in very specific circumstances.  </s>
<s> There are lots of agents that generate ICMP packets that have no need to ever generate certain sorts of ICMP messages.  </s>
<s> It it then appropriate to claim that these features of ICMP don't interoperate merely because some agents cannot produce them?  </s>
<s> I think not.  </s>
<s> The interoperability requirement is not for all implementations, only for two different implementations based on a different code base.  </s>
<s> So my understanding is that there must be at least two different ICMP implementations which can send and receive every single ICMP message, and which can interoperate when handling this message, but it is not necessarily required that every implementation can handle every ICMP message, not even that there are two implementations which can handle all the ICMP messages in just those two implementations.  </s>

<s> And of course this again begs the question of what it means to have a generator of a given protocol feature.  </s>
<s> As I pointed out before, while you may not be able to get a set of GUI MUAs to generate deeply nested multiparts in one go, such things do get generated quite regularly.  </s>
<s> In the case of the obsolete stuff in DRUMS I would agree that this is reasonable.  </s>
<s> Although I suppose that in the abstract sense we'd be better off simply removing any obsolete feature that has never been used.  </s>
<s> But this amounts to proving a negative about the installed base, which is impossible.  </s>
<s> And as a practical matter, finding real examples of all the obsolete stuff in DRUMS is likely going to prove to be depressingly easy.  </s>
<s> But in the case of a new protocol, while the extreme situation of having nothing but hand-created examples of a single isolated feature is probably sufficient to meet the letter of the interoperability testing requirements, one can argue that a feature that's demonstrably been shown to not be used other than in testing isn't worth having and should probably be removed from the protocol.  </s>
<s> But you're right in saying this isn't required for a move to draft.  </s>
<s> There's also a slippery slope here should we start trying to figure out what constitutes a legitimate "generator".  </s>
<s> For example, there are several implementations of what you might call "MIME object generators" out there.  </s>
<s> These are things that take one or more objects and put them in a MIME structure.  </s>
<s> The ones I'm familiar with can be used to build basically arbitrary MIME structures with only a few commands.  </s>
<s> Is such a thing a generator?  </s>
<s> Where do we draw the line?  </s>
<s> Personally, I draw the line by not worrying this issue on this basis at all.  </s>
<s> When we move something from proposed to draft or from draft to full it makes sense to review the list of features not only from the perspective of "does this interoperate" but also from the perspective of "do we really need this".  </s>
<s> The former is required by the process and if not met, of course justifies the removal of a protocol feature.  </s>
<s> The latter isn't required but isn't prohibited either, and can and has been used to remove unnecessary complexity from various protocols.  </s>
<s> And this is especially true of the move to full standard.  </s>
<s> A good example here is multipart/parallel.  </s>
<s> There were several agents capable of sending and receiving it back when MIME was moved to draft.  </s>
<s> But other, more powerful constructs appear to have taken its place, and nobody bothers with it much any more.  </s>
<s> This was pointed out back when MIME recycled at draft, and at the time I pointed out that the requirements for moving to draft had been met in full, and so it should stay in.  </s>
<s> I still believe this to be true for draft standard.  </s>
<s> But what about moving to full standard?  </s>
<s> I'm not sure multipart/parallel meets the requirements for full standard.  </s>
<s> Perhaps it should be moved to a separate, informational document at this point, should we ever get to moving MIME to full standard... Ned  </s>
<s> Jacob, what seems to be lacking in this discussion is an application of judgement.  </s>
<s> The IETF has never defined interoperability rules as formally as you seem to desire them.  </s>
<s> Most RFCs (including the MIME specs), contain what formalists may see as a huge mishmash of requirements, implementation advice, background discussion, non-normative definitions, and even humorous asides.  </s>
<s> (My personal favorite is the discussion of incorrect implementations in RFC 1982: "Nothing can be done with these implementations, beyond extermination.")  </s>
<s> But, while some might say that this is no way to run a standards organization, many (including myself) find that it the only way to do so, and any other approach to be stiflingly bureaucratic.  </s>
<s> So, to your specific question, no, my suggestion below is not the official IETF policy on to how to deal with an obsolete features section.  </s>
<s> But, it seems reasonable to me and it may very well seem reasonable to the IESG and the AD responsible for overseeing the interoperability report.  </s>
<s> If you want to review all the different approaches that have been taken to IETF interoperability testing, you might start with http://www.google.com/search?q=interoperability+testing+ietf&amp;num=30&amp;sa=Goog  </s>
<s> le+Search .  </s>
<s> Instead, I would suggest that you use your judgement in conducting the testing and then produce a report like http://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/Forum/Reports/rollup.txt , although hopefully far less detailed since MHTML is a much simpler standard.  </s>
<s> If you really want help from this mailing list or ietf-822, then I would suggest writing up your plan for interoperability testing and having it reviewed by the list (with the understanding that the IESG are the audience that really counts at the end of the day).  </s>
<s> But these abstract conversations are not getting us anywhere, and therefore I too hereby drop out of the thread.  </s>

<s> I thought interoperability meant that one implementation could receive what another implementation produced.  </s>
<s> You say that interoperability means that two implementations will handle the same manually generated input in the same way.  </s>
<s> Is that really right?  </s>
<s> Or is that a special variant of interoperability, to be applied to "receive-only" specs, while "send-and-receive" specs will still be tested by testing that one implementation can receive what another implementation sends?  </s>
