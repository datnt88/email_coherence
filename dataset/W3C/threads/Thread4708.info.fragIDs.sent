<s> Hi Ashok, The following is an entirely personal (not official) response, offering a couple of clarifications.  </s>
<s> As the new chair of the I18N Working Group, I want to assure you of a swift response.  </s>
<s> Since many of our members are traveling or on vacation at the moment, it may yet be a few days before you receive something official.  </s>
<s> As the new guy, I'm a little hesitant to leap into this discussion.  </s>
<s> Nonetheless, I have some comments below which might help.  </s>
<s> On the question of the timing of CharMod's finalization, it's very clear that this is a key deliverable that a lot of WGs are waiting on.  </s>
<s> Certainly I've seen the requests from the I18N WG asking people to reference the CharMod or aspects thereof.  </s>
<s> It's unfair of us to do that if we can't get a reasonable schedule for release.  </s>
<s> I hope to clarify that shortly and to everyone's satisfaction.  </s>
<s> If you have concerns or questions about the I18N WG's methods, deliverables, or comments, I would urge you to contact me privately to discuss them.  </s>
<s> I'm very concerned that we address such issues.  </s>
<s> Following my sig are my comments on the technical questions raised in your note.  </s>

<s> It is not a feature.  </s>
<s> When CharMod talks about "normalization" it refers to Unicode normalization forms as defined in the Unicode Standard (currently version 4.0).  </s>
<s> Every character has well-defined combining characteristics, so your comment: (Most combining characters are accents and it is arguably rare for such characters to start a sentence but aren't 'h' and 'l' combining characters is Spanish for the forms 'ch' and 'll'?  </s>
<s> If so, many sentences will start with these characters) ... while insightful about the nature of some languages, is not applicable in this case.  </s>
<s> 'c', 'h', 'l' and other characters are always fully spacing.  </s>
<s> Some languages, as you note, use digraph characters: other examples include the Dutch 'ij' digraph and many such letters in Central European langauges.  </s>
<s> None of these cases are at issue here.  </s>
<s> A Unicode combining character is defined as a character with a combining class  0 in the Unicode character database.  </s>
<s> In all cases, a character either *is* a combining mark at all times and in all languages or it is *not* a combining mark.  </s>
<s> The language of the material does not affect this, allowing algorithmic normalization.  </s>
<s> It seems to me that you are correct about the nature of the fn:substring function being able to create strings that are not fully-normalized.  </s>
<s> If fn:substring were modified require its output to be fully-normalized, then I think the right thing to do would *not* be to delete the starting (offending) character, but to insert a space character at the start to "carry" the combining mark (I think this is actually covered, but not very explicitly in comment [61]).  </s>
<s> This has the side effect of: substring(mystr, 0,10) + substring(mystr, 10, length(mystr) != mystr Therefore I would say that the fn:substring operation cannot produce fully-normalized text, because that would seem to fly in the face of the purpose of such an operator.  </s>
<s> Again, speaking strictly for myself, I can see how you have arrived at the conclusions you have made.  </s>
<s> There are functions which can produce "fully-normalized" strings and check strings for "fully-normalized-ness": they are exactly the same as the function that produces Unicode Normalization Form C, plus a check that the first character in the string being normalized is a base character (e.g. has a combining class of 0).  </s>
<s> If the last test fails, a space is inserted at the start of the data to carry the combining mark.  </s>
<s> This loses no information.  </s>
<s> A function such as fn:normalize-unicode can easily be written.  </s>
<s> Whether other XML Query operations should be defined as producing fully-normalized output (or not) I think is a separate question.  </s>
<s> In fact, I think there are cases where it might be better if they were defined as NOT producing fully-normalized and rather only produce include-normalized text (such as the substring example above).  </s>
<s> Then a separate operation such as fn:normalize-unicode becomes very important (in the event that a segment of content produced by a function that does not guarantee fully-normalized output must be emitted as fully-normalized).  </s>
