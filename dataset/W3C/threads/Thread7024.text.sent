I've been asked to propose a charter for a possible URI working group to work on next phase topics. 
The working group should be narrowly focused to insure viability and keep us from wandering into unsolvable problems. 
For this purpose, I propose the following items to be in scope: (1) update RFC 2396 as follows: Focus is to be consistent with existing, current widespread deployment. 
The goal is to prepare to move RFC 2396 to Standard. 
(A few exceptions to this noted below.) (a) Fix bugs already noted in errata (bugs in the BNF?) (b) document variations in current practice, as warnings to implementors. 
(c) fold in changes proposed for IPv6 addresses (this may not be exactly 'current practice') (d) include additional terminology definitions for common words used with URIs ('resolution'), and update the description of URI/URN/URL language in accordance with current usage. 
(2) update RFC 2717 (Registration Procedures) and RFC 2718 (Guidelines for new schemes) to take into account current practice. 
NOT IN SCOPE I propose to NOT fold in the IRI definition, but to allow it to proceed along standards track at its own pace. 
The revised URI standard can note the IRI work as a separate effort. 
OTHER TOPICS I think it would be good to finally 'obsolete' RFC 1738, but it's necessary to do something, I think, with the URI scheme definitions that are only documented there: "file" is used widely but documented correctly nowhere. 
"http" was defined in the HTTP spec and "mailto" has its own RFC, "telnet" is still used, "news" and "gopher" less so, and I haven't seen a "nttp", "wais" or "prospero" in years. 
I think Roy Fielding has started on some of this update work, but I haven't heard status in a while. 
Roy? 
Larry Larry, I don't want to pre-empt the IRI experts, but I have a hunch that giving the URI %HH escapes a formal definition of representing UTF-8 (rather than the present undefined encoding) would help the IRI activity enormously. 
My guess is it would leave them free to define a canonic mapping of IRIs into URIs without requiring any further URI spec. 
changes. 
If I'm right, would this simple change be out of scope? 
Chris Haynes There is an underlying flaw in that concept. 
Many browsers and servers today are passing or inferring non-utf-8 input from the URI or header fields. 
Many are passing utf-8 data. 
As the specification makes no preference or definition, the server is responsible for inferring some meaning by the context of the request by the client, and returning the response in kind. 
Making such a change by fiat would be inappropriate. 
Some additional information has to be passed by the client to preempt any inference of the high-bit octet codes. 
If this were a change to the HTTP/1.2 specification, that would be the indicator that all headers and the URI itself are utf-8 encoded. 
Without a bump of the HTTP version number, it's entirely out of scope. 
I'm not clear here about Larry's intent, so I will ask; Larry, did you mean for the next document revision to spell out an HTTP/1.2 conformance? 
If not, is Chris Haynes' proposal out of line, if he introduces the appropriate header field definition to assert that the client and server treat the now-opaque octets %80-%FF as utf-8? 
Bill I think you're asking a fairly confusing question. 
I was asked to propose a charter for a group to update the URI spec, and I proposed *NOT* introducing -- into the same specification -- the IRI concepts. 
An IRI isn't a URI, it's something else. 
They're related, but different. 
Whether one wants to create a version of HTTP which uses IRIs instead of URIs is a completely separate issue which the IRI group might consider but would be out of scope for the URI update. 
Since "uri@w3.org" 
seems to be open to more general discussions, perhaps we need another list whose focus is the narrower topic of URI update. 
Larry Larry, I think a new URI WG and spec revision would be great as long as the public has read and write access to the lists. 
William, I think HTTP is out-of-scope for this discussion. 
We're talking about URIs which have a much wider usage and no versioning mechanism. 
Roy, I remember you saying something about adding a note that UTF-8 was standard in the new document (replacing "It is expected that a systematic treatment of character encoding within URI will be developed as a future modification of this specification.") but this got some people upset along the lines below: Perhaps we could have some sort of signal, ala the Unicode BOM (Byte Order Marker) to show the encoding was UTF-8?

Hello Larry, I had some discussions on this at the IETF last week. 
It wasn't clear whether we would need a WG for this, and one idea was to first wait to see Roy's update to be able to judge the nature of the changes. 
My take is that if it's just simple updates/cleanup of RFC 2396, a WG may not be necessary. 
But if we are going to work on other documents, too, then maybe it's better to have a WG. 
I propose to add one additional item: Update the syntax of host names: Currently, this is one of the only places where %hh-escaping isn't allowed. 
Implementations are mixed, some browsers e.g. accept http://www.w%33.org while others don't. 
So this may go under "(b) document variations in current practice, as warnings to implementors." 
below. 
With Internationalized Domain Names, allowing %hh in host names is necessary for consistency. 
The actual text is currently in and there is some chance that the IDN WG moves this forward. 
But in either way, it should be folded into the URI spec. 
Regards, Martin. 
I agree. 
Pointing out the relationships in the new URI spec is a good idea, but the two specs should stay separate (in particular also because the IRI spec is further along the path than the URI update). 
Well, rather than the 'IRI group' (which is actually the W3C Internationalization WG), this should be considered by the HTTP folks. 
For the moment, I think using the same list is okay. 
If we get a real WG, we can create a new list. 
I guess W3C may be able to host it. 
Regards, Martin. 
I have set up a public cvs module for tracking the editing of the URI spec and an associated test suite. 
has all of the current stuff, including a validating xml version of RFC 2396. 
Anonymous cvs access is described in I'll put together an issues list and welcome files and then put it up on my website somewhere, followed by editing the spec itself. 
So far, the only changes I have made (under the rev-2000 subdirectory) have been to update the front matter and improve XML validation and XSLT translation of the document. 
....Roy Which is always the case for an IETF WG. 
I think we need to replace this sentence with something explaining the tendency to move towards UTF-8 (which is almost the same, but clearly different from 'it's always UTF-8'). 
Well, first, there is a saying 'if it looks like UTF-8, it is UTF-8'. 
For details, see [Duer97] Duerst, M., "The Properties and Promises of UTF-8", Proc. 
11th International Unicode Conference, San Jose , September 1997, http://www.ifi.unizh.ch/mml/ 
mduerst/papers/PDF/IUC11-UTF-8.pdf . 
Second, it would be weird to use a special marker for the 'usual case' and leave all the other cases unmarked. 
Regards, Martin. 
I'd like to have a BCP RFC documenting the recent practise for new fragment identification mechanisms like XPointer or as proposed in XFrames to use some functional notations in the fragment identifier just like document#xpointer(...) document#frames(...) document#xmlns(...)%20element(...) 'nntp' is less common, because most software allows the 'news' scheme to refer to NNTP servers, just like news://nntp.example.org/ 
followed by either a message id or a news group name. 
'news' is rather common, though, but mostly on Usenet for obvious reasons. 
hello. the problem here is that there is no such thing as a best current practice (at least that's my impression). 
xpointer and draft-borden-frag-00 use parantheses, while others are opposed to this syntax and prefer a simpler way of designing fragment identifiers (for example, see roy fielding's comment in the previous thread about "updated internet draft: 'URI Fragment Identifiers for the text/plain Media Type'" http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/uri/2002Aug/0004.html) now, the question i have is: since there is no established current best practice, what should i do with my draft about text/plain fragment identifiers? 
should i wait until there is an established way of designing fragment identifiers (how long will this take)? 
should i choose roy's good old days syntax? 
or the more recent xpointer-syntax? 
any comments are very welcome, since i would like to make a choice and then stick with it.

do, or do not. 
there is no try.
