hi everybody! 
i'm currently developing a xml-parser in php, having problems with not wellformed html/xml. 
problems i could solve by myself, but with an amount of time i don't want to lose if there is already a program that can do it for me. 
so my question is: is there a version of html tidy for php implemented or planned? 
thx for support mac Tidy processes PHP code fragments embedded using or in element context. 
Enhancements for inline PHP substitution, e.g. are somewhat less likely to happen, and structural cleanup of dynamically generated code is even less likely (and actually not doable), e.g. handling code fragments like Klaus Johannes Rusch KlausRusch@atmedia.net Take a look at http://tidy.sf.net/ 
Once Tidy is a free-standing library, it will be easy to integrate it into PHP.
