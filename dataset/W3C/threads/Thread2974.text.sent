Suppose a client has requested for page. 
The page is a big file Before the whole response has come, client wants to indicate to server that it is no more interested in the data. 
At the same time, I do not want the TCP connection to be closed. 
Since I want to make use of Keep-Alive and keep the TCp connection alive How can I do it ? 
Can sending "Connection:close" do the job ? 
But I guess it will tear down the "Keep-Alive" connection in HTTP/1.1 Am not sure about its behaviour in HTTP 1.0 Thanks Diwakar Am Donnerstag, 06.02.03, um 13:31 Uhr (Europe/Berlin) schrieb Diwakar Shetty: Once the response is underway, it is not possible for the client to interrupt the sending server other than by closing the connection. 
What a client, concerned about the size of a GET response, can do is to send a HEAD request to the server first and examine the Content-Length (hopefully known by the server) in order to decide. 
Hope this helps. 
//Stefan Hopefully there exists a provision to specify the "BYTE RANGE" in "HTTP request" to hint the Web-Server about the Length of data Client Browser can accept. 
Exploring more on 'HTTP Partial Download' may help.
