<s> How can you paste the X selection in Amaya?  </s>
<s> I haven't been able to find a way.  </s>
<s> On sun keyboard, one uses the Copy and Past function key.  </s>
<s> Otherwise (Linux for example) the key F6 is mapped to the function exporting the current selection to the X11 cut buffer.  </s>
<s> The F8 key is to paste the cut buffer.  </s>
<s> Check the Thot/config/amaya.keyboard .  </s>
<s> You can have your own copy in $HOME/amaya.keyboard  </s>
<s> and customize it.  </s>
<s> see http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Amaya/User/Configure.html under the section Keyboard Shortcut to get the syntax of the file.  </s>

<s> What about the standard X way?  </s>
<s> Copy by dragging the mouse with button 1 pressed and paste by pressing button 2.  </s>
<s> I use the function keys of my QWERTY keyboard (it's best for a developer) for the French accented letters.  </s>
<s> So what?  </s>

<s> Surely, it's a good idea, but we don't have any time to do that.  </s>
<s> If someone is interested doing that, we'll be very happy to integrate this work.  </s>
