Here are the new guidelines and principles - up to half way through 1.2 Proposed wording for Principle 1 Principle 1: Content must be Percievable. 
Guideline 1.1 For non-text content, provide text equivalents that serve the same purpose or convey the same information as the non-text content, except when the purpose of the non-text content is to create a specific sensory experience (for example, music, visual art) in which case a text label or description is sufficient. 
Level 1 1.1-Sc1Text equivalents are explicitly associated with non-text content, except when the non-text content is intended to create a specific sensory experience (for example, music without words, visual art). . 
The text equivalent fulfills the same function as the author intended for the non-text content (that is, it conveys all of the intended information and achieves the same function as the non-text content). 
1.1-SC2 - non-text content that is designed to create a specific sensory experience (such as music without words or visual art) has a text label or a text description. 
Level 2 (no items in level 2) only item here was deleted for consistency with changes to 1.1 that eliminate the phrase "expressed in words" Level 3 1.1-SC3 
A single text document (e.g script) is provided that includes all important visual information, dialogue, and other important sounds). 
Proposed wording for Guideline 1.2 1.2 Provide synchronized media equivalents for time-dependent presentations. 
Level 1 Proposed wording for Guideline 1.2, SC 1 1.2-SC1. 
an audio description of visual events is provided for audio-visual media Proposed wording for Guideline 1.2, SC 2 1.2-SC2. 
Captions are provided for all significant dialogue and sounds in time-dependent material. 
WE NEED TO ADD A DEFINITION: time dependent - need def that captures that it includes audio and visual information presented at the same time, as well as audio or visual with interaction, or in combination with real time events. 
WE STOPPED HERE - THERE ARE MORE SUCCESS CRITERIA FOR 1.2 BUT WE DID NOT GET TO THEM YET. 
Should we add something about being explicitly associated to this one?
