<s> Hi, How does one report javadoc bugs to the java bindings that are published by the W3C DOM WG?  </s>
<s> The bindings came from the following URL: -Edwin  </s>
<s> This new version should fix the javadoc [1]: If the new Java bindings are ok, they will be integrated as an erratum.  </s>

<s> Hi Philippe,  </s>
<s> Yes, it fixes most of the bugs.  </s>
<s> One bug that was not fixed is below: The description ( javadoc comments ) of the org.w3c.dom.Node.getNodeValue()  </s>
<s> says that values returned by the method is described in some table : "public String getNodeValue() throws DOMException The value of this node, depending on its type; see the table above" But there is no such table either in the method's description or in the description of the interface org.w3c.dom.Node.  </s>
<s> See attached patch for a sample fix.  </s>
<s> Thanks, -Edwin *** /java/pubs/ws/jamie-merlin/webrev/src/share/classes/org/w3c/dom/Node.java-  </s>

<s> Here is a new try:  </s>
<s> Since the Java sources are generated, I had to change the DOM scripts to generate the documentation of Node.  </s>
<s> It fixed the same problem in the Document interface (createElementNS, createAttributeNS).  </s>
<s> Also, the description of importNode wasn't "well-formed".  </s>
<s> Philippe  </s>
<s> Thanks, it looks better.  </s>
<s> From a quick scan, I've noticed these items: + The url href mentioned in more than one file does not exist:  </s>
<s> + It looks like the get/setXXX() methods have the same javadoc, which may be suboptimal b/c for example, Attr#getValue() says it can throw a NO_MODIFICATION_ALLOWED_ERR while the DOM spec says that only the Attr#setValue() method should do this.  </s>
<s> In addition, the other javadoc comments may sound somewhat awkward.  </s>
<s> Since it sounds like you are auto-generating the java bindings, it may be difficult to fix this.  </s>
<s> So, I will leave it up to you as to whether it is worth fixing this to avoid user complaints.  </s>
<s> -Edwin  </s>
<s> I was using the editors work version of the DOM Level 2 sources to generate the bindings.  </s>
<s> I'll make sure to use the REC version to generate the final version for the erratum.  </s>
<s> Yes. Unfortunately, the XML sources don't contain enough meta informations to know if an exception should be generated or not.  </s>
<s> I think it's better to have this solution than having no documentation at all.  </s>
<s> We should probably fix that in DOM Level 3 but it means modifying the xmlspec DTD... Thank you for your report, Philippe  </s>
