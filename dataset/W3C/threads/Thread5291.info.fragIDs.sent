<s> 4. WORDNET TASK FORCE [Christiane Fellbaum expected to join the discussion] Issues to discuss: Christiane introduced herself as working on Wordnet, an author of a book on Wordnet and interested in spreading the use of Wordnet.  </s>
<s> She stated that Wordnet is really a lexicon and she is interested in mapping it to an ontology and thus she is sympathetic to our request.  </s>
<s> However she has also been contacted by Adam Pease and is wondering if we are competing.  </s>
<s> [Adam Pease chaired IJCAI-2001 Workshop on the IEEE Standard Upper Ontology , per http://home.earthlink.net/~adampease/professional/  </s>
<s> ] Guus responded that the rationale for this task force is that there are several different translations of Wordnet to semantic web languages and it would promote interoperability and use of Wordnet to agree on one representation using one namespace.  </s>
<s> Thus we are not competing with Adam.  </s>
<s> Guus explained that we are proposing two steps.  </s>
<s> The first step, the low hanging fruit, is create a direct translation of Wordnet in a semantic web language.  </s>
<s> The second step, which is not yet ready for standardization given there is no consensus on how to do it, is how to relate Wordnet to an ontology.  </s>
<s> However we can facilitate this research if it can be based on a common encoding of Wordnet in a semantic web language.  </s>
<s> Christiane agreed that we are not yet ready to standardize the mapping to an ontology and with the split into two phases, doing the first one first.  </s>
<s> Guus suggested that if we can agree on a namespace and on an encoding then the working group will provide the tools to do the translation from the prolog form of Wordnet to RDF. Guus requested that the translation be shipped as part of the standard wordnet distribution.  </s>
<s> Christiane, whilst emphasizing that she has not resources, agreed that the Wordnet group would help with reviewing the proposed translation and advising on solutions to technical issues.  </s>
<s> She also agreed that the Wordnet team maintain Wordnet and this might be shipped in the next version.  </s>
<s> There was some dicussion of ongoing maintenance that didn't reach a firm conclusion.  </s>
<s> Christiane asked if there were commercial aspects to this work, and Guus replied that this is the product of a W3C working group, working in public, so not directly.  </s>
<s> Christiane stated she was sympathetic to the proposal and requested the WG provide a document summarizing the proposal she could use to discuss with her colleagues.  </s>
<s> Aldo agreed to produce this document.  </s>
<s> It was agreed it would be reviewed by the WG before being sent to Christiane.  </s>
<s> Guus emphasized the internationalization aspects of the encoding.  </s>
<s> ACTION Aldo Prepare summary of Wordnet proposal document, and send to Christiane after review by the WG. Danbri thanked Christiane for Wordnet which he described as a great resource he has been using for 5 years and asked about future plans for Wordnet.  </s>
<s> Christiane replied that it is largely stable, though still changing, it will change more slowly.  </s>
<s> Asked about proposals to change the upper level structure, Christiane replied that the Wordnet team were not always aware of such proposals.  </s>
