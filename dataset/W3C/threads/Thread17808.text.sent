material for my task Check guidelines for information about ToolTip control. 
ToolTips (sometimes called popup descriptions)are the little popup windows of additional information about an element. 
In IE and NC (Netscape communicator) the ToolTips popup when the mouse pointer is over an image and the ALT text is displayed in the ToolTip. 
In Opera the URL of a link is displayed in the ToolTip. 
ToolTips (by whatever name) are also provided in the Window 95/98 and Mac operating systems. 
ToolTips and other popup information (spawn windows) are distracting/disorienting to people with some types of learning and attention related disabilities. 
I am currently searching for how to control ToolTips. 
I have found no information in the guidelines specifically regarding ToolTip or control. 
However, I think a checkpoint is needed under guideline 4.4 "Guideline 4.4 Ensure that users can disable features that might interfere with accessibility Users must be able to turn on and off support for features that may interfere with accessibility. 
User agents are only expected to provide this control for content that it recognizes." 
4.4.15 Allow the user to turn on and off the rendering of "ToolTips" Jim Allan, Statewide Technical Support Specialist Texas School for the Blind and Visually Impaired 1100 W. 45th St., Austin, Texas 78756 "We shape our tools and thereafter our tools shape us." McLuhan, 1964 I think this is a good checkpoint. 
What do others think?

(From [1]) Does this fall under: 4.4.12 [Priority 1] Allow the user to turn on and off support for spawned windows. 
What is the difference between the accessibility barrier created by a tool tip and one created by an opening browser window?

A tooltip does not create another instance of the browser, but could obscure information or be confusing to a person with visual impairment.

I thought a tooltip spawned a little window too.

I'm wondering whether it's useful to have one checkpoint that's slightly more general, or two specific ones (for windows and tooltips). 
Are there other similar phenomena that cause orientation problems?
