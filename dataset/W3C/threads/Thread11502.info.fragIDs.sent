<s> Greetings.  </s>
<s> First of all, thanks for the redesign of the translation pages.  </s>
<s> The result was superb!  </s>
<s> I have a few comments about the way the idiom pages were organized, which I think may help to improve the accessibility.  </s>
<s> They are related to the Portuguese entries, but probably they apply to other idioms which have localized versions.  </s>
<s> Although it is nice to tag documents either "pt-PT" (Portuguese in Portugal  </s>
<s> style) or "pt-BR" (Portuguese, Brazilian style), some translators forget to include the country code, or just choose not to do so because the language  </s>
<s> differences may be irrelevant to that document.  </s>
<s> [BTW, it should be pt-BR and not pt-br.  </s>
<s> Country codes should br uppercase.]  </s>
<s> Since you (or the page generator) created only two entries (pt and pt-BR),  </s>
<s> what happens is that some pt-BR documents are listed in  </s>
<s> discriminated them for your convenience: pt-PT Especifica??o de Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language 1.0 (SMIL) (SMIL1.0)  </s>
<s> Leonel Morgado pt-PT CONSELHOS PARA FAZER S?TIOS WEB ACESS?VEIS (WAI Quick Tips) Leonel Morgado pt-PT Inicia??o: Como Fazer S?tios Web Acess?veis: Como Fazer S?tios Web Acess?veis (WCAG Getting Started) Leonel Morgado pt-PT Directivas para a acessibilidade do conte?do  </s>

<s> Claudia Dias pt-BR XML em 10 pontos.  </s>
<s> (7, de fato...) (XML in 10 Points) Fabr?cio Rog?rio Santos Santana  </s>
<s> You have two options: you can use only one Pottuguese entry (pt) and put all documents there, or create differente entries for each localization.  </s>
<s> Up to this date, just pt-PT and pt-BR are there, but there are other Portuguese parliant countries.  </s>
<s> Since style differences are just a added flavour, and documents can serve people from both countries, I suggest you use only one pt entry, and optionally classify the documents inside that page (just pt, pt-PT or pt-BR).  </s>
<s> This should also correct some inconsistencies.  </s>
<s> For example, the document I translated (XML in 10 points) is at the pt-BR page but has an older version entry int the pt page (see  </s>
<s> above), for Fabr?cio tagged it as just pt.  </s>
<s> This way, it looks like they are different translations of the same document, when in fact they are translations of different versions.  </s>
<s> This may not apply to all languages that can be localized -- some are too diferent, like zh-hk and zh-cn.  </s>
<s> Curiously, I see no distinction between en-EN and en-GB, fr-FR and fr-CA, de-CH and de-DE, etc.  </s>
<s> In particular, I expected to see es-ES, es-MX, es-AG, etc., since there is alot of regionalities that apply to spanish as spoken in Latin America.  </s>
<s> Hope this helps to improve the indexing.  </s>

<s> Up jpcb to this date, just pt-PT and pt-BR are there, but there are other jpcb Portuguese parliant countries.  </s>
<s> Since the language tags are hierarchical, a query on "pt" should return those tagged as 'pt' or 'pt-BR' or 'pt-PT' or indeed 'pt-anything-anything-anything' whereas a query on 'pt-BR' (or pt-br or any other case mixture) should return only Brazilian Portugese documents.  </s>
<s> Same for all languages of course.  </s>
<s> jpcb This may not apply to all languages that can be localized -- jpcb some are too diferent, like zh-hk and zh-cn.  </s>
<s> But equally, if someone asks for 'zh' the they should get all chinese  </s>
<s> documents.  </s>
<s> As you point out, for some languages they are less likely  </s>
<s> to do that.  </s>
<s> jpcb Curiously, I see no distinction between en-EN and en-GB, (There is no en-EN because EN is not a country code.  </s>
<s> I assume you meant that en-US and en-GB and en are not distinguished).  </s>
<s> jpcb There are only 10 kinds of people in the world: those who jpcb understand binary and those who don't.  </s>
<s> Chris mailto:chris@w3.org  </s>
<s> Marcello, thanks for your comments.  </s>
<s> As you noted yourself, the two Chinese versions are a different problem, due to the differences between simplified and traditional character sets.  </s>
<s> If we forget about that, Brazilian Portuguese is the only one which came up, simply because that was the only case where I found translations which explicitly flagged themselves as Brazilian Portuguese as opposed to simply Portuguese.  </s>
<s> In other words, the fact that there is no special entry (yet?) for Canadian French is simply because, well, nobody claimed a translation to be Canadian French... So it leaves us with the (until now) special case of Brazilian Portuguese.  </s>
<s> And I very well realize the problem you are hinting at, I was actually tempted to merge the various Portuguese versions.  </s>
<s> Although I finally chose not to, your solution of merging the two and possibly flagging them might be a better one.  </s>
<s> It will require some twisting of my code (ie, it will not  </s>
<s> be overnight), so in the meantime I will change the data of the documents  </s>
<s> below (for the sake of consistency).  </s>
<s> However, I would welcome more input from others on the list who might be (potentially) in a similar situation... ivan  </s>

<s> DC Hmm... that's an interesting idea... No.... its not 'an interesting idea' ;-) its how language tags have been defined ever since RFC 2070.  </s>
<s> However, reading on, it seems you misunderstood what I was discussing.  </s>
<s> DC what sort of query did you have in mind?  </s>
<s> Neither of the ones you list below....  </s>
<s> I meant "query" in the sense of 'the part of the URI after the ?' because the URIs just announced for translations use ?  </s>
<s> for that.  </s>
<s> In other words, the query parts of URIs that were just announced in this thread.  </s>
<s> For example to get translations for just SVG, its to get translations just in Finnish, its So, looking at the language= part, I was just suggesting that it should work in the way that language tags are defined to work, which does not seem especially unusual or interesting, just the defined and correct way.  </s>
<s> DC xml:lang support in RDF query is a hairball...  </s>
<s> I don't DC think cwm[1] does it at all (let alone any sort of support DC for hierarchy); I went around for weeks claiming[2] DC that nobody does it, and then finally I got somebody to DC say "we do".  </s>
<s> Sesame or something, I think.  </s>
<s> It would seem highly desirable that RDF could use the same xml:lang stuff that everyone else uses.  </s>
<s> But that was not the subject of my suggestion or of this discussion.  </s>
<s> DC I have no idea whether XML Query works as you expect.  </s>
<s> Ok I guess I should ask Paul Cotton or someone (but again, that wasn't what I was talking about although it is of course what one would expect).  </s>

<s> Chris mailto:chris@w3.org  </s>
<s> Yes... sorry for reading too fast.  </s>
<s> Here's hoping the cost of the diversion ends up being outweighed by resulting benefits...  </s>
<s> Just one small detail: RFC 3066 language codes are case insensitive.  </s>
<s> All tags are to be treated as case insensitive; there exist conventions for capitalization of some of them, but these should not be taken to carry meaning.  </s>
<s> For instance, [ISO 3166] recommends that country codes are capitalized (MN Mongolia), while [ISO 639] recommends that language codes are written in lower case (mn Mongolian).  </s>
<s> So no need to bother with this detail.  </s>
<s> Regards, Martin.  </s>
<s> Hello Chris, Thanks for the idea of using and similar to get at various sets of translations.  </s>
<s> I think it is the right direction to go.  </s>
<s> Some more details below.  </s>
<s> Please note that language tags as such are not defined to work that way, but RFC 3066 defines a construct called "Language-range" that works like this (and pretty much looks like a language tag).  </s>
<s> (see http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3066.txt,  </s>
<s> 2.5 Language-range).  </s>
<s> And then to be formally correct, we would have to make sure that works, which should not be too difficult, just redirect that one to http://www.w3.org/2003/03/Translations/OverviewLang.html.  </s>
<s> I think for the query part of the URI, that sounds good.  </s>
<s> The question is what to list on the right of Do we list all variants, or make some shortcuts?  </s>
<s> And how do we organize the pages that we get back if they have more than one (sub-)language.  </s>
<s> Anyway, I think we got some very good ideas, but it will take some time for them to be implemented, so please be patient.  </s>
<s> Regards, Martin.  </s>
<s> The trick is restricting the check in xml:lang attribute to just the number of characters present in the query.  </s>
<s> This way, a query to "pt" would return any documents tagged with either "pt", "pt-BR", or "pt-anything".  </s>
<s> If you go a step further and restrict the test to the minimum number of charaters of either the query string and the testes string, then it would also return "pt" documents when asked for "pt-PT", but not "pt-BR".  </s>
<s> I think this behaviour is exactly what is expected from xml:lang.  </s>
<s> This is easy to implement, just tweak the XPath expression in the query using the string-length() and starts-with() functions.  </s>

<s> jpcb The trick is restricting the check in xml:lang attribute to just jpcb the number of characters present in the query.  </s>

<s> Right.  </s>
<s> And further, it has to be seen as a hyphen-separated list of tokens.  </s>
<s> Its not a substring match.  </s>
<s> So "p" or "pt-b" should not match anything.  </s>
