The agenda for Thursday's meeting, which will be held at 2100 hours UTC (the usual time) on the W3C/MIT Longfellow bridge: +1-617-252-1038, is as follows: 1. 
Should 2.1 be split into two checkpoints? 
2. Should checkpoint 2.4 be dropped on account of its being a user agent requirement? 
3. Action items from the face to face meeting. 
In particular, the navigation mechanisms proposal at and the "distractions" proposal at 4. Status of drafts and ongoing work resulting from last week's meeting. 
My regrets for the meeting, as previously announced. 
But some quick thoughts on the agenda proposals inline... 1. 
Should 2.1 be split into two checkpoints? 
CMN I don't think so. 
I do not care too much either way though. 
2. Should checkpoint 2.4 be dropped on account of its being a user agent requirement? 
CMN No. There is still a requirement on authors not to code this way, and also not to rely on it (these two ideas are linked in a few of the checkpoints that we have - sometimes we say it one way, and sometimes another. 
Maybe we should try to clarify that). 
I'm going to have to send my regrets, as well. 
I'm being called away at the last minute. 
On the agenda items: MM I think they should. 
It's already clear that interaction behaviors and navigation mechanisms are distinct enough to warrant different definitions in the checkpoint itself. 
This one checkpoint also happens to cover three-fourths of Guideline 13 from WCAG 1, so I think it should be split rather than being one overburdened checkpoint. 
MM No. I don't think the user agents will be able to filter out, for example, DHTML-induced flickering or blinking, since it could be coded n number of ways by the page designer, and it's also necessary to ensure these needs are delineated in technology documents other than (X)HTML. 
However, a common usage which I think should be an exception case would be a zero-second meta refresh used to redirect users to new sites. 
It's common for site designers, particularly those who are hosted remotely and don't administer their own machines, to need this functionality when the site is moved. 
If they don't control the site, they wouldn't be able to do an HTTP redirect, and I don't believe meta http-equiv="location" would work on all browsers. 
I'd like to see this taken into consideration, either by making an exception, or stating in XHTML techniques that these redirect hacks don't convey any content to the user, and as such aren't subject to 2.4.
