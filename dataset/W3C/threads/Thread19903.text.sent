There appears to be a mismatch between version 1.4a of Amaya and version 2.1e of Thot. 
The DeleteElement now takes a second argument, pDoc, but Amaya code isn't passing that argument. 
Should I not be trying to use these versions together, or is this just a brief incompatibility that I happened to unluckily stumble upon. 
Is this obvious patch the right one? 
Thanks, Greg This isn't directly related to the previous post but it reminded me of a problem related to Thot. 
I don't remember where I first found a link to the Thot site but it doesn't seem to be from the Amaya pages. 
I see Thot mentioned in several places, but none of them are links. 
At a minimum, there should be a link to the Thot site from the Source pages and/or a local copy that the Amaya team has used to build the current version of Amaya.

The last Thot release is one year old. 
During that time the Thotlib and Amaya continued to change. 
Each Thot Editor and Amaya applications are released with their Thotlib version. 
Exactly. 
If we have enough time, we will publish a new version of Thot.

The Amaya distribution is complete as it is, so the Thot toolkit is distributed with Amaya. 
The pointer to Thot was removed just because people were confusing. 
However we are happy to let know that Amaya is the result of our previous research activity at INRIA. 
I will add in http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User page a link to Thot (http://www.inrialpes.fr/opera/Thot.en.html) Regards Irene.
