Jan has called for volunteers to review: It would be great if we could get these approved at the next telecon. 
Brian Jos, Dave and I have reviewed these, and they appear to be OK. 
In particular, they are simple reflections into test cases of decisions already approved by the WG. I'd like to include these in the next version of the WD - which Dave and I need to get to Eric ASAP today. 
Is it possible to approve these by email? 
Need an answer quickly on this.

Yes I think we can approve. 
You have two reviewers. 
They are not controversial. 
Unless you hear any objections, by say 1pm uk time, list them as approved.
