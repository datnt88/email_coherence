<s> Jim forgot Edgar Schwarz and Preston Bannister's messages (both dated 2/3/2001), both of whom voted for submitting the combined document to the IESG.  </s>
<s> Also, Jim Amsden left me phone mail saying that he was in favor of submitting a combined document to the IESG (JimA, please do send email to the list, to make it official).  </s>
<s> Greg and Juergen expressed their desire to split the document before we cleanly separated out the core and options sections.  </s>
<s> So I'd  </s>

<s> So with the addition of JimA, Eric, and Ron, that makes it: JimW, Larry, Mark, Lisa, Chris in favor of splitting Greg, Juergen possibly in favor of splitting Geoff, Tim, James, Edgar, Preston, Eric, Ron, JimA in favor of keeping together So that makes the straw poll: 5 for splitting 2 maybe for splitting 8 for keeping together So depending on how we count the "maybe"s, that would make it either 8-7 in favor of keeping together or 8-5 in favor of keeping it together.  </s>
<s> So as Jim said, "Not entirely rough consensus, but it certainly shows a leaning in one direction."  </s>

<s> - Jim  </s>
<s> Right.  </s>
<s> With the current document organization, I'm ambivalent.  </s>
<s> It is quite fine, and I can easily build an implementation with it in hand.  </s>
<s> The speed of progression through the IETF has some merit in terms of how to treat the document, but I also find it rather disturbing that a standard has to be a slave to the IETF process.  </s>
<s> Personally, I'll code against the draft as it is submitted to the IETF, whether as a single or two-part draft.  </s>
<s> It doesn't matter to me, and it doesn't matter how fast it progresses to Draft Standard.  </s>
<s> One of the luxuries of Open Source coding, is that I can build something without a marketing department forcing interoperability or forwards/backwards compatibility.  </s>
<s> If the spec changes later, then I can change the code at will.  </s>
<s> (of course, I do feel some weight from mod_dav users and it being used in some cases as a reference point; but forward development is much easier on me; changes can be fixed) Ah well.  </s>
<s> Point is: the speed of progression thru the IETF doesn't bother me.  </s>
<s> And the unified document is somewhat more appealing and may encourage people to look at what their other options are when they investigate the core versioning.  </s>
<s> In Apache terms, I'd say that I'm "-0" on splitting it... meaning that I'm not for it, but wouldn't complain if it was split.  </s>
