<s> Hello, In the 23 October draft [1], the "text" content label includes three checkpoints: 3.3, 4.1, and 4.2, all of which refer to requirements related to visual rendering of text: 3.3: Blinking and animated text.  </s>
<s> I assume here that this only applies to visual rendering.  </s>
<s> 4.1, 4.2: Text size and font family.  </s>
<s> Therefore, consistent with our use of the word "text" to mean "characters (before rendering)", I propose changing the content label to "visual text".  </s>
