<s> Hello, I'm trying to implement some of the changes and clarifications regarding focus and viewports that we discussed at the 1-2 March face-to-face meeting [1].  </s>
<s> I outline the conceptual model I'm working from and then propose changes to a few checkpoints and definitions.  </s>
<s> I think that most of the proposals in this section are editorial (with the exception of the change proposed for checkpoint 7.2).  </s>
<s> Reference document: 24 Feb 2001 Draft [2].  </s>
<s> [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/2001/03/ua-minutes [2] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20010224/  </s>
<s> The model 0) Each viewport has four associated state variables: content focus, user interface focus, selection, and point of regard.  </s>
<s> * The point of regard may be, but is not required to be, established by the content focus or the selection.  </s>
<s> * The selection may be empty.  </s>
<s> I think that the content and user interface focus can be empty as well (but I'm not sure).  </s>
<s> The point of regard is probably never empty.  </s>
<s> 1) At any given moment during the user's session, if N viewports are open, only one of 2N content focuses and user interface focuses will receive keyboard (or other device) input; this one is the current focus.  </s>
<s> Only one of N selections will receive keyboard (or other device) input; this is the current selection.  </s>
<s> I don't think we need to define "current point of regard" because we have a requirement to keep a chosen graphical viewport on top and the concept isn't useful in the audio world.  </s>
<s> There is generally only one pointing device location (which directs pointing device events).  </s>
<s> 2) It is hard to define "current viewport" because in some environments, one viewport may house the current focus and another may receive pointing device input.  </s>
<s> This split does not generally happen on Windows or Mac systems.  </s>
<s> But since it could happen (even in the Windows environment if you get the right software) and I can do this in X Windows.  </s>
<s> It also seems that the "current viewport" is closely bound to input devices rather than what the user is currently viewing (output).  </s>
<s> The term might cause confusion as to whether it is determined by input or output.  </s>
<s> Note: I doubt there are systems where you could change the content focus in one viewport and the selection in another.  </s>
<s> But I don't know for sure.  </s>
<s> 3) For user agents that implement history mechanisms, each entry in the history may have distinct values for the four state variables (content focus, user interface focus, selection, and point of regard).  </s>
<s> 4) If there are N viewports open, and each one has M entries in its history, there are N times M values available for each of the current content focus, user interface focus, and selection.  </s>
<s> Our requirements deal with changes to these state variables and highlighting of these state variables.  </s>
<s> Comment: There are other checkpoints related to selection, focus, and viewports that are not mentioned below because I think they are unaffected by this discussion.  </s>
<s> Proposal 1: Checkpoint 4.15 Allow the user to configure whether the current focus moves automatically to a viewport that opens without an explicit request from the user.  </s>
<s> a) Do not broaden the checkpoint to require additional configuration so that the current selection, and pointer do not move automatically to a viewport that opens without an explicit request from the user.  </s>
<s> I actually think that additional configuration not to move the pointer around would be a good thing, but I am not proposing that change.  </s>
<s> b) I don't think that configuration is necessary at all if the user agent never moves the current focus automatically.  </s>
<s> c) Some editorial changes to simplify the text.  </s>
<s> Allow configuration so that the current focus does not move automatically to viewports that open without explicit user request.  </s>
<s> Configuration is not required if the current focus can only ever be moved by explicit user request.  </s>
<s> For the techniques document: * Suggest additional configurability for the other state variables.  </s>
<s> Proposal 2: Checkpoint 4.17 For graphical user interfaces, allow the user to configure the user agent so that the viewport with the current focus remains "on top" of all other viewports with which it overlaps.  </s>
<s> a) Do not broaden the checkpoint to require additional configuration so that the viewport with the current selection or the one designated by the pointing device remains on top.  </s>
<s> What does "on top" mean for more than one state variable?  </s>
<s> (One may offer different configs; that could be in the Techniques document.) b) Editorial simplification For graphical user interfaces, allow configuration so that the viewport with the current focus remains "on top" of all other viewports with which it overlaps.  </s>
<s> Proposal 3: Checkpoint 7.1 Allow the user to navigate among all viewports (including frames).  </s>
<s> Note: Navigating into a viewport makes it the current viewport.  </s>
<s> a) I think that the term "navigation" is unclear (we had some of this discussion at the face-to-face).  </s>
<s> I think that  </s>
<s> instead we should say that each viewport has to be able to have the current focus/selection/pointing device designation.  </s>
<s> I don't think this broadens the checkpoint since I suspect we already meant all of these things.  </s>
<s> b) Delete the Note about current viewports (as part of dropping  </s>
<s> the term from the document).  </s>
<s> This is a change from what we decided at the face-to-face meeting.  </s>
<s> Allow the user to make the selection and focus of each viewport the current selection and focus, respectively.  </s>
<s> For interfaces that support a pointing device, allow the user to interact with each viewport using the pointing device.  </s>
<s> Note: Often, a change to one of these variables may cause a change to another (e.g., cliking in a viewport with the pointing device makes that viewport's focus the current focus, and its selection the current selection.  </s>
<s> Proposal 4: Checkpoint 7.2 Associate a point of regard with each state in a viewport's browsing history and when the user returns to a state in the history, restore the associated point of regard.  </s>
<s> a) I think that all four state variables should be restored when you return to a state in the viewport's history.  </s>
<s> I think this is a slight broadening of the checkpoint.  </s>
<s> b) Note: We do not require the UA to implement a history mechanism.  </s>
<s> If it is implemented, the UA must do these things.  </s>
<s> For each state in a viewport's browsing history, associate a point of regard, content focus, user interface focus, and selection.  </s>
<s> When the user returns to that state in the history, restore all four of these states.  </s>
<s> Proposal 5: Checkpoint 8.7 Provide a mechanism for highlighting the current viewport.  </s>
<s> For graphical viewports, the default highlight mechanism must not rely on color alone.  </s>
<s> a) Avoid the term "current viewport".  </s>
<s> I propose narrowing this checkpoint to the viewport with the current focus (the same scope as 4.15 and 4.17).  </s>
<s> Provide a mechanism for highlighting the viewport with the current focus.  </s>
<s> For graphical viewports, the default highlight mechanism must not rely on color alone.  </s>
<s> Proposal 6: Delete the term "current viewport" Proposal 7: Definitions of focus, content focus, user interface focus, current focus Focus is a user interface mechanism that has the following properties: It designates a location of potential user interaction.  </s>
<s> In most user agents today, the focus is only sensitive to keyboard input, but this could be generalized to other input devices.  </s>
<s> The focus is highlighted in the viewport so that it stands out.  </s>
<s> The focus has state (more so than the transient pointing device), so the user may use it as a placeholder.  </s>
<s> For instance, the user may set the focus (through the user interface or programmatically), review other content (e.g., by scrolling the viewport or otherwise moving the point of regard), and then return to the focus having decided to activate the designed enabled element.  </s>
<s> User agents generally implement two types of focus: The "content focus" designates an enabled element.  </s>
<s> A viewport has at most one content focus.  </s>
<s> The "user interface focus" designates a control of the user agent's user interface (e.g., a radio button, text box, menu, etc.).  </s>
<s> A viewport has at most one user interface focus.  </s>
<s> In this document, the term "focus" used alone includes both types of focus.  </s>
<s> Where either content focus or user interface focus is meant, that term is used.  </s>
<s> When several viewports coexist, each may have one content focus and one user interface focus.  </s>
<s> At all times, only one content focus or one user interface focus receives input events; this is called the current focus.  </s>
<s> Proposal 8: Definitions of selection, current selection The selection generally identifies a range of content (e.g., text, images, etc.) in a document.  </s>
<s> The selection may be structured (based on the document tree) or unstructured (e.g., text-based).  </s>
<s> Content may be selected through user interaction, scripts, etc.  </s>
<s> The selection may be used for a variety of purposes: for cut and paste operations, to designate a specific element in a document, to identify what a screen reader should read, etc.  </s>
<s> The selection may be set by the user (e.g., by a pointing device or the keyboard) or through an application programming interface (API).  </s>
<s> A viewport has at most one selection (though the selection may be rendered graphically as discontinuous text fragments).  </s>
<s> When several viewports coexist, each may have one selection.  </s>
<s> At all times, only one viewport's selection receives input events; this is called the current selection.  </s>
<s> On the screen, the selection may be highlighted using colors, fonts, graphics, magnification, etc.  </s>
<s> The selection may also be rendered through changes in speech prosody, for example.  </s>
<s> Proposal 9: Definition of point of regard The point of regard is a position in rendered content that the user is presumed to be viewing.  </s>
<s> The dimensions of the point of regard may vary.  </s>
<s> For example, it may be a point (e.g., a moment in an audio rendering or a cursor in a graphical rendering), or a range of text (e.g., focused text), or a two-dimensional area (e.g., content rendered through a two-dimensional graphical viewport).  </s>
<s> The point of regard is almost always within a viewport (though the dimensions of the point of regard could exceed those of the viewport).  </s>
<s> The point of regard may also refer to a particular moment in time for content that changes over time (e.g., an audio-only presentation).  </s>
<s> User agents may determine the point of regard in a number of ways, including based on viewport position in content, content focus, selection, etc.  </s>
<s> A user agent should not change the point of regard unexpectedly as this may disorient the user.  </s>

<s> Ian wrote in part: instead we should say that each viewport has to be able to have the current focus/selection/pointing device designation.  </s>
<s> I'm uncertain as to what this means in the following context.  </s>
<s> If I want to know what elements there are or how many of them there through a quiry mechanism, that is also navigation?  </s>
<s> We don't have those specific query requirements.  </s>
