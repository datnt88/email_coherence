<s> RDFCore, We say that rdfs:member (the superproperty of rdf:_1, _2 etc) has an rdfs:domain of rdfs:Resource, allowing it to be applied to anything without implying that thing is a Container.  </s>
<s> I believe the text in is perfectly consistent with that.  </s>
<s> *However* the rdfs:comment for rdfs:member says: "A member of the subject container."  </s>
<s> This is a bug (thanks to Roland Schwaenz for spotting it).  </s>
<s> We need a new and more non-commital rdfs:comment for this property.  </s>
<s> Creative suggests welcomed.  </s>
<s> In the absence of inspiration, I propose: rdfs:member, "A member of the subject resource."  </s>
<s> Admittedly this doesn't make much sense, but we don't give ourselves a great deal of space in our rdfs:label glosses to expand on detail.  </s>
<s> Any objections to running with the above proposal?  </s>

<s> This may raise more questions than it answers, but here's a stab for discussion: Asserts that the object is a member of, or in some sense "belongs to" the subject resource.  </s>
<s> It is intended to be used as a common relationship between containers and all of their members, but is not so restricted and may be used with subjects that are not of type rdfrs:Container.  </s>
<s> The overall vagueness of this leaves me wondering *why* rdfs:member doesn't have a domain of rdfs:Container.  </s>
