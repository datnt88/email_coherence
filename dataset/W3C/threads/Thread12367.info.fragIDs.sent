Liddy has been admirably getting up at 2am on a regular basis to join our call. 
I don't think we should continue to ask her to do that. 
I 
would like to find an alternative time that works for everyone that 
regularly attends the teleconference. 
This needs to take into account European time, Australian time and both east and west coast North American time. 
How is everyone with 4:00pm EDT on Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday? 
This would make it 6:00am in Australia and 9:00 pm in Europe. 
Or does anyone have an alternative suggestion?

According to the International Meeting Planner, Jutta's suggestion of 4pm EST is pretty good - although it is actually 10pm in Europe. 
3pm EST would be 5am in Australia and 9pm in Europe.

Thank you - I do appreciate this gesture. 
I believe 4.00pm on Tuesday would clash with the IMS meetings, if they continue at that time... Liddy 
Hi Jutta, 
The same issue arose a few weeks ago in the PF group. 
It is very difficult to find a common time that works for every time zone. 
10pm Central European Time means I can make some of the calls, but not all of them, but I understand the change.

I hesitate to speak for Heather, but in her absence, the time is do-able here in Pacific time; however, at glancing at her schedule she may have conflicts with this time, at least on Mondays/Wednesdays--Tuesdays look like a 30 minute conflict (at the last 1/2 hour). 
I don't know if these are times that she can adjust or not. 
She'll be back and able to speak for her own schedule next week. 
When did you need to make a firm decision? 
Thanks!

Jutta 
does it help to have different times? 
I will be in Europe for a few weeks soon and so we could have meeting times that suit the meetings - boring but maybe better for actual events? 
Liddy 
I'm comfortable with whatever time is set and will remain flexible, even if it's 5:00am PDT.

Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday at 4:00 pm EST would work for me but Tuesday or Wednesday would be better. 
Fyi, I'm back but Lou Nell is going to sit in on the next call for me -- It's still Monday at 12:00 EST right?
