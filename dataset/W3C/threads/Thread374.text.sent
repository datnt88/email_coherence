I noticed that tidy has a problem parsing Microsoft Webclass tags. 
All webclass tags begin with " WC@". 
The programmer of the webclass defines these tags for the application. 
For example: Even if defining WC@DOMAINNAME in the .CFG 
file as a block level tag, tidy stops parsing the tag name at the '@'. 
becomes: Any ideas (besides not using webclasses) g Thanks, Todd Clark Tidy is picky about what characters it expects within tag names. 
Perhaps I should add an option to make it less picky. 
In the meantime you could patch the code for ParseTagName() in lexer.c or you could add @ to the namechar set defined in InitMap() also in lexer.c. 
The source code is available from the Tidy home page Thanks for the input.
