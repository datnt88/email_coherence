<s> I'll bring my usual set of nitpicking editorial comments to the IETF meeting for personal delivery.  </s>
<s> Meanwhile, here are some substantive ones.  </s>
<s> 1) Sect 1.2 [Proxies] MUST forward the WWW-Authenticate and Authorization headers untouched....  </s>
<s> I would like MUST to be SHOULD.  </s>
<s> I've brought this up once before.  </s>
<s> There may be services (LPWA, lpwa.com, is one such) whose legitimate purpose is to provide authentication services for a user, such as replacing special character sequences in Authorization with a user's computed identity.  </s>
<s> The proxy ought to be able to do so without being considered non-compliant.  </s>
<s> 2) Sect 3.2.1, under "nonce" ... is the dotted quad IP address ... How to handle IPv6 addresses?  </s>
<s> 3) Sect 3.2.2, syntax should be entity-digest = " ... The "date" attribute description bears no mention here of what date we're talking about.  </s>
<s> I inferred from text much further on that it's supposed to mirror the Date header of the request/response.  </s>
<s> 4) Sect 3.2.2, semantics Consider sender - proxy - receiver.  </s>
<s> The entity-digest incorporates information from headers from the sender.  </s>
<s> Consider, for example, Date and Content-Length.  </s>
<s> A proxy could add Date if one were missing.  </s>
<s> A proxy could add a Content-Length after gobbling up something that the sender sent "chunked".  </s>
<s> The receiver wouldn't know that the proxy had added those headers.  </s>
<s> It would use the added headers in its calculation of entity-digest and derive a different value from what the sender calculated.  </s>
<s> Dave Kristol  </s>
<s> Yes, this was resolved in the discussion [1] on the list.  </s>
<s> The solution that was last called is stated in [2].  </s>

<s> Henrik Frystyk Nielsen, World Wide Web Consortium  </s>
<s> Another comment.  </s>
<s> I detected another bug in the spec.  </s>
<s> On page 13, it says: entity-digest " KD (H(A1), unquoted nonce-value ":" Method ":" date ":" entity-info ":" H(entity-body)) " ; format is " *LHEX " should be: entity-digest " KD (H(H(A1)), unquoted nonce-value ":" Method date ":" entity-info ":" H(entity-body)) " ; format is " *LHEX " It is supposed to be this way so that when you have a centralized key server, you can send it the initial nonce, the user name, and the response-digest, it can validate it, and send back H(H(A1)), so that the server need not ever have H(A1) -- a good thing, because otherwise it would give the server the ability to authenticate as the user.  </s>
