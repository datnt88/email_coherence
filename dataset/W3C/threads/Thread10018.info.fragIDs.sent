<s> It would appear that folks are biting at the bit to discuss untyped literal  </s>
<s> semantics.  </s>
<s> As this is a topic that arouses some passions, I'd like to  </s>
<s> suggest some guidelines for how we conduct it.  </s>
<s> My first suggestion is that we use rdf/xml syntax throughout.  </s>
<s> The issue is  </s>
<s> not really what: a b "foo" .  </s>
<s> means.  </s>
<s> As Pat has recently shown, we can create new constructions in  </s>
<s> n-triples more or less at will.  </s>
<s> That still leaves the question of what does  </s>
<s> the following rdf/xml translate to in terms of n-triples.  </s>
<s> I suggest the issues here arise in RDF/XML, for example in CC/PP and DC and what will be readily understood by our community of rdf/xml users.  </s>
<s> Secondly, I suggest we aim to decide, one way or the other.  </s>
<s> As some folks  </s>
<s> have recently pointed out there may be the possibility of ducking the question.  </s>
<s> My motivation in getting involved in this WG was a desire to make the current specs more clear and precise.  </s>
<s> I suggest it would be better to decide if we possibly can.  </s>
<s> Only if we cannot, should we duck the question.  </s>
<s> Third, I suggest we are choosing between one of three options: o untyped literals are self denoting o untyped literals denote a value from the value space of some datatype o we can't decide  </s>
<s> Please can we couch any discussion in terms of advantages and disadvantages of these choices.  </s>
<s> As this is an issue which can ascend to the philosophical, I suggest we give greater weight to pragmatic concerns.  </s>
<s> Finally, I suggest we guillotine the discussion.  </s>
<s> The decision will be made at the telcon of 20th Sept unless a consensus emerges before then.  </s>
<s> Brian  </s>
<s> I believe there is another disjunct decision that the WG should make, as suggested  </s>
<s> by Jeremy, which would insulate most of the documents which must deal with the concrete and abstract syntax from the above decision; and that is to make inline literals syntactically (not semantically) untidy in the abstract syntax (and NTriples), and assign to them a unique systemID such as used to name bnodes.  </s>
<s> Thus  </s>
<s> would be represented in the abstract syntax as Jenny age (_:x, "10") .  </s>
<s> Adopting this form of syntactically untidy representation for non-typed  </s>
<s> literals will also facilitate developers who opt for untidy semantics, even if we opt to not decide ourselves on the semantics of non-typed literals.  </s>
<s> Note that making untyped literals syntactically untidy does not force  </s>
<s> any application from using an internally tidy representation in the interests of efficiency, etc.  </s>
<s> I would like to see this addressed by the WG before or in parallel to the separate and important issue of semantics and, if so adopted, reflected in the editorial changes being made to reflect Part 1 of the restructured datatyping specification in the various documents.  </s>

<s> literal  </s>
<s> my understanding of "untyped" is "no type"  </s>

<s> is  </s>

<s> I would say  </s>
<s> :jenny foo:age "10" .  </s>

<s> i.e. unknown type Jos De Roo, AGFA http://www.agfa.com/w3c/jdroo/  </s>
<s> [Patrick Stickler, Nokia/Finland, (+358 50) 483 9453, patrick.stickler@nokia.com]  </s>
<s> Well, per Jeremy's proposal for untidy syntax, irrespective of the semantics, we'd always have :jenny foo:age _:t"10" .  </s>
<s> and then decide in the MT whether _:t denotes an unknown datatype or is simply a syntactic mechanism preserving the uniqueness of the occurrence of the literal.  </s>
<s> The abstract syntax would be the same in either case.  </s>
<s> If we opt for tidy semantics, then we simply say that for any non-explicitly-typed literal node, its interpretation is that it denotes the literal I(xxx"LLL") = "LLL" If we opt for untidy semantics, then we say that the systemID denotes some datatype, and rely on mechanisms such as rdfs:range to clarify which datatype it is I(xxx"LLL") = L2V(I(xxx))("LLL") Taking the above approach, having a single consistent concrete and abstract syntax for either tidy or untidy intepretation, allows all of the documents but the MT to be completed without later impact by any decision made about semantics, which simply can be addressed in the MT document as required.  </s>
<s> And if we choose not to decide about the semantics, it allows applications to augment the RDF MT accordingly to adopt either tidy or untidy interpretation without having to introduce any changes on the syntax.  </s>
