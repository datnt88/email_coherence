In the introduction to [1], you say: User agents can render "alt" text as a tool tip, thus providing additional information to the general populace. 
I think recommending that alt text be rendered as a tooltip is a bad idea, since it will encourage authors to write alt text that is suitable for a tooltip rather than alt text suitable for replacing an 
image. 
(The title attribute is generally considered more appropriate for tooltips, I think.) David Baron [1] http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WD-WAI-PAGEAUTH-19990226 
Well spotted. 
I'd like to support your objection to that wording. 
I'm sorry that I haven't had the opportunity to follow the blow-by-blow drafting of these documents; I'm actually still uneasy about this too: providing a short description of the image's function via the "alt" attribute I'd much prefer something like "providing a textual substitute for the image's function...". 
That word "description" seems to cover all kinds of blunder that are seen in practice in ALT texts. 
Again in the Techniques document (section 1.2): A text equivalent (or alternative text) describes the function or 
purpose of content. 
Again this word "describes". 
To my way of thinking, the alternative text is a textual alternative or replacement for the function. 
Calling it a "description" seems to me to be too indirect. 
It isn't a "description of a function": when done properly, it "provides the function", "serves as the function", or some phrase like that; the only difference is that the original provides the function by means of an image, the alternative, by means of text. 
I wouldn't call the text a "description" of the image, any more than the image is an illustration of the text! 
They're both supposed to be doing the same job, just in alternative fashion. 
The rest of that paragraph in the techniques document: A text equivalent should not describe visual appearance or how something sounds. 
For example, if an image of a magnifying glass is used for a search button, the alt-text would be "Search" rather than "Magnifying glass". 
is perfectly fine, on the other hand. 
best regards 
I agree that equivalent text does not describe the function of the graphic, but rather fulfills it. 
This point had been made before and, due to inattentiveness on my part, I had not noticed that it was not reflected in the actual text. 
As Gregg mentioned in a different context, the text only performs the function of the graphic so far as is possible. 
For instance, a description of a painting would probably not produce an equivalent experience to that of an aesthetic encounter with the painting itself; and the same can be said, mutatis mutandis, of music and certain other types of auditory content. 
The editors will remove the statement about tool tips from the introduction. 
Thank you for these comments. 
We will be moving the definition of "textual equivalent" to the Guidelines document and the editors will clarify the meaning at that time.

Jason, We'll add a statement to that effect - there are limits to equivalence - in the definition of textual equivalent.
