<s> In the introduction to [1], you say: User agents can render "alt" text as a tool tip, thus providing additional information to the general populace.  </s>
<s> I think recommending that alt text be rendered as a tooltip is a bad idea, since it will encourage authors to write alt text that is suitable for a tooltip rather than alt text suitable for replacing an  </s>
<s> image.  </s>

<s> Well spotted.  </s>
<s> I'd like to support your objection to that wording.  </s>
<s> I'm sorry that I haven't had the opportunity to follow the blow-by-blow drafting of these documents; I'm actually still uneasy about this too: providing a short description of the image's function via the "alt" attribute I'd much prefer something like "providing a textual substitute for the image's function...".  </s>
<s> That word "description" seems to cover all kinds of blunder that are seen in practice in ALT texts.  </s>
<s> Again in the Techniques document (section 1.2): A text equivalent (or alternative text) describes the function or  </s>
<s> purpose of content.  </s>
<s> Again this word "describes".  </s>
<s> To my way of thinking, the alternative text is a textual alternative or replacement for the function.  </s>
<s> Calling it a "description" seems to me to be too indirect.  </s>
<s> It isn't a "description of a function": when done properly, it "provides the function", "serves as the function", or some phrase like that; the only difference is that the original provides the function by means of an image, the alternative, by means of text.  </s>
<s> I wouldn't call the text a "description" of the image, any more than the image is an illustration of the text!  </s>
<s> They're both supposed to be doing the same job, just in alternative fashion.  </s>
<s> The rest of that paragraph in the techniques document: A text equivalent should not describe visual appearance or how something sounds.  </s>
<s> For example, if an image of a magnifying glass is used for a search button, the alt-text would be "Search" rather than "Magnifying glass".  </s>
<s> is perfectly fine, on the other hand.  </s>
<s> best regards  </s>
<s> I agree that equivalent text does not describe the function of the graphic, but rather fulfills it.  </s>
<s> This point had been made before and, due to inattentiveness on my part, I had not noticed that it was not reflected in the actual text.  </s>
<s> As Gregg mentioned in a different context, the text only performs the function of the graphic so far as is possible.  </s>
<s> For instance, a description of a painting would probably not produce an equivalent experience to that of an aesthetic encounter with the painting itself; and the same can be said, mutatis mutandis, of music and certain other types of auditory content.  </s>
<s> The editors will remove the statement about tool tips from the introduction.  </s>
<s> Thank you for these comments.  </s>
<s> We will be moving the definition of "textual equivalent" to the Guidelines document and the editors will clarify the meaning at that time.  </s>

<s> Jason, We'll add a statement to that effect - there are limits to equivalence - in the definition of textual equivalent.  </s>
