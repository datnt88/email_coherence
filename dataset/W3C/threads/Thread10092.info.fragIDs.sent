<s> This boiler plate needs a few tweaks: a.  </s>
<s> We need to be consistent as to whether we cite the full names of authors and editors, or just their initials.  </s>
<s> The current boiler plate has a mixture.  </s>
<s> b. We also need to be consistent as to whether we say "Work in progress" or "work in progress"; again, there's currently a mixture.  </s>
<s> Also, having changed the Primer to be consistent with what I thought was the latest Concepts and Syntax documents in citing Schema as [RDF-VOCABULARY] (and having announced that to the list on Tuesday), we're now going back to [RDF-SCHEMA]?  </s>
<s> Boo!  </s>
<s> --Frank  </s>
<s> True.  </s>
<s> I vote for initials on the grounds that it is less work.  </s>
<s> ALso do we need a uniform convention for style of text references?  </s>
<s> Do we have [HUNTER] [DAVIS] or [Hayes&amp;Menzel] or [Hayes &amp; Menzel 2001] or .....  </s>
<s> Doesnt that depend on where you are in the sentence?  </s>
<s> Maybe it would help if someone in the middle, like Brian, just TOLD us what to do here, and then we all did it.  </s>
<s> Brian?  </s>
<s> Can you just tell us what style to use?  </s>
