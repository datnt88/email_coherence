<s> Me too.  </s>
<s> But sometimes we cannot; sometimes a fairly complex table is the most feasible way to present complex technical information.  </s>
<s> I'm still struggling with the question what to recommend for tables in general in my practical short guide to Web accessibility.  </s>
<s> Considering the fact that most (data) tables on the Web make little or no attempt at using any accessibility features, even the distinction between th and td , I think I'll first present the very basics of proper table markup, then proceed to any extra markup we might add for accessibility.  </s>
<s> One reason to this is that accessibility features for tables are the most confusing thing in HTML markup related to accessibility.  </s>
<s> When experts are confused, I can't really expect novices to learn to use the complicated constructs easily; and using them  </s>
<s> _wrong_ way is probably worse than not using them at all.  </s>
<s> As far I can see, your usage is correct: you use ID for the TH elements and list (as a space-separated list) in a HEADERS attribute in a TD element all the heading cells (TH elements) that apply to the current cell.  </s>
<s> However, the example is not very good in the sense that there is little reason to use two levels of header cells.  </s>
<s> In fact  </s>
<s> you will probably have difficulties in finding a real example of such a situation where that would be needed and where consequently you would need to use ID and HEADERS instead of the much simpler approach of just using SCOPE attributes in TH cells.  </s>
<s> In this example, it would be in several ways better to have just the headers Title, Director, Star, and Co-Star.  </s>
<s> I would also recommend using SCOPE in any case.  </s>
<s> There might be user agents that recognize SCOPE but not HEADERS and ID. Besides, SCOPE is a logical thing to use.  </s>
<s> Without it, TH  </s>
<s> markup does not really tell whether the cell is a header for a column or for a row (though heuristics might answer this in most cases).  </s>
<s> As regards to other issues in the markup (I'm interpreting the question in the Subject line as a broad one):  </s>
<s> I would use a summary attribute that more clearly expresses the content and structure of the table, e.g. "Information about movies: Each row contains the title, the name of the director, the name of the star, and the name of the co-star, of a movie."  </s>
<s> Maybe this is just fine tuning.  </s>
<s> This, especially when combined with the width attributes for the cells, reduces flexibility.  </s>
<s> This is a general design issue rather than accessibility, but I cannot help noticing that even in fullscreen mode, my IE shows the name "Harrison Ford" as divided into two lines in the last column, when I test your example.  </s>
<s> And such splits may have some impact on accessibility.  </s>
<s> For a less known name, or for a hypothetical  </s>
<s> reader who does not know Harrison Ford, the question may arise in the reader's mind whether the cell tells about two co-stars by their surnames or about a single co-star.  </s>
<s> tr td headers="title" Star Wars /td  </s>
<s> It might be argued that in a table like this, the cells in the first row (movie titles) are logically headers for rows.  </s>
<s> I would use th scope="row" ... here.  </s>
<s> This is somewhat debatable of course, especially since typical browsers display th elements by default centered and in bold, and this might be undesired, even distracting.  </s>
<s> The centering can be prevented using an explicit align="left".  </s>
<s> Bolding is a different issue, but in practice, using CSS (font-weight: normal) would probably be sufficient.  </s>

<s> Most often I find that a complex table is the result of laziness.  </s>
<s> Oh good, so it's not just me.  </s>
<s> OK, that's good.  </s>
<s> I haven't found any really comprehensive documentation about how all of the attributes are meant to be used.  </s>
<s> And when I look at the table in Opera's author mode (which can linearize tables), I can't tell if the attributes really *work* or not.  </s>
<s> Agreed.  </s>
<s> I was just trying to throw somethign together quickly.  </s>
<s> Which is what most people do when they design a table.  </s>
<s> Most people being the ones who don't take accessibility into account:)  </s>
<s> Agreed.  </s>
<s> I think that the proper approach is to create the table in a manner that allows for only the scope attribute to be used.  </s>
<s> I just threw that in there to have a summary.  </s>
<s> I use those attributes along with CSS to speed up table rendering.  </s>
<s> The point is well taken though about the name being on two lines.  </s>
<s> As always, thanks for the feedback, Jukka.  </s>
