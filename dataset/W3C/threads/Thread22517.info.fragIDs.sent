<s> If no one else wants it, fine.  </s>

<s> destinationDoc.transferNode(originalNode); // transfer the original node Comments?  </s>
<s> Don Park  </s>
<s> Docuverse  </s>
<s> Don (and all),  </s>
<s> The problem with transferNode below is that it assumes that the destination node can change the ownerDocument for the node, which currently isn't possible between implementations.  </s>
<s> As for Document.createCopy, this seems distinctly non-OO.  </s>
<s> Wouldn't it require the document to test what kind of node  </s>
<s> it was copying and then have some very node-specific operation for each (or have I missed something here)?  </s>
<s> I'd like to revisit cloneNode(bool deep, Document newDoc).  </s>
<s> I still haven't seen any counter arguments for this approach.  </s>
<s> Stephen Savitzky started the suggestion to put cloneNode in Document with the following advantages:  </s>
<s> The node creation methods would still be on document.  </s>
<s> Granted, the node would then have to transfer some data, something like: Element::cloneNode(deep, targetDoc) targetDoc.createElement(tagName);  </s>
<s> // Transfer attributes if ( deep ) // clone children But this would actually be very neat, being able to clone attributes and so on, with each class handling its own cloning.  </s>
<s> I don't see what would have to be modified for new node types.  </s>
<s> I don't see a problem with the above approach either.  </s>
<s> To summarise, we are only going to get small changes into Level 1 at this stage (if that).  </s>
<s> Unless there are serious problems with the simple change proposed, why not go with it?  </s>
<s> Alfie.  </s>
<s> Alfie,  </s>
<s> Yeah, I realized my forgetfulness right after posting it.  </s>
<s> This basically  </s>
<s> forces transferNode implementation to always move by copying the content.  </s>
<s> However, your suggestion also forces cloning.  </s>
<s> The question is, are there any way to do this without cloning?  </s>
<s> Just change the definition of insertChild/appendChild?  </s>
<s> Don  </s>
<s> Don, I'm not sure I understand this debate about cloning or transferring.  </s>
<s> As I see it, the current spec doesn't say anything about transferring nodes without cloning, so presumably it can be left to implementations.  </s>
<s> The reason I wanted a targetDoc on cloneNode is so that we can  </s>
<s> mix implementations.  </s>
<s> So if I do an appendChild from one implementation to another, it can use cloneNode to get a clean copy in its own implementation.  </s>
<s> I now see that it can also be used to transfer nodes between documents too.  </s>
<s> For example (in pseudo code):  </s>
<s> Node Element::appendChild(Node newChild) // Check implementation NodeInternal customNode=newChild.QueryInterface(INodeInternal); if ( (customNode == NULL) || (newChild.ownerDocument  </s>
<s> != ownerDocument) ) // Not my implementation/document customNode=newChild.cloneNode(TRUE, ownerDocument); // Add to my children m_children.push_back(customNode);  </s>
<s> // Here's where we use the custom interface customNode.parentNode=this;  </s>
<s> Does this make any sense at all in Java?  </s>
<s> Without a lot more work (ie.  </s>
<s> Level 2), I don't think we can get a transferNode which works between implementations/documents. However, if cloneNode is given a targetDoc parameter, implementations can decide whether to clone or not, and have a clear mechanism for doing so.  </s>
<s> A performance boost might be to say that if the newChild is the same implementation, has a different ownerDocument but doesn't have a parent  </s>
<s> (perhaps after a removeChild), the custom interface could be used to modify  </s>
<s> the ownerDocument and the parentNode, and thus avoid cloning.  </s>
<s> This raises a question.  </s>
<s> What happens to ownerDocument and parentNode after removeChild?  </s>
<s> Alfie.  </s>
<s> the  </s>
<s> In cases where the "transfer" requires creating new objects (ie, when copying content between implementations), this doubles the heap churn.  </s>
<s> I'd  </s>
<s> suggest instead that there be a Move option as well as Copy (or rename Copy  </s>
<s> and make this a boolean parameter), which could then recognize same-class as a special case and optimize appropriately.  </s>
<s> Joe Kesselman / IBM Research Unless stated otherwise, all opinions are solely those of the author.  </s>
<s> The various node types probably would take responsibility for copying their local data anyway.  </s>
<s> If you start copying a tree, _someone_ is going to have to dispatch to the appropriate factory methods based on the DOM type of the source node.  </s>
<s> That dispatch is going to want to loop back through the Document's factories to obtain the new nodes, in case the DOM's user has subclassed a node type and  </s>
<s> subclassed Document to override the factory to produce that modified node.  </s>
<s> So there's something to be said for making the "produce our version of one  </s>
<s> of these" mechanism live in Document; it is a factory, albeit of a build-to-order flavor.  </s>
<s> Level 1 declared that multiple documents weren't supported, so all of this is probably going to be deferred to Level 2. Which is fair... but which  </s>
<s> probably means Document.cloneNode() should be _explicitly_ undefined in Level 1. Joe Kesselman / IBM Research Unless stated otherwise, all opinions are solely those of the author.  </s>
<s> The point is that an implementation which is transferring a node of an  </s>
<s> implementation it recognizes can do whatever it wants beyond the public APIs to change ownerDocument.  </s>
<s> It is only immutable through current public APIs.  </s>
<s> But I will clone in any case, because that is more efficient in my implementation.  </s>
<s> Ray Whitmer ray@imall.com  </s>
<s> I agree.  </s>
<s> I do not think that the appendChild method of element should automatically clone.  </s>
<s> Probably.  </s>
<s> I strongly disagree.  </s>
<s> This is far worse than simply adding transferNode.  </s>
<s> cloneNode should always clone the node.  </s>
<s> The type of complex behavior you describe should never be a part of cloneNode, i.e. sometimes it clones and sometimes it returns the original.  </s>
<s> If you want transferNode, then call it that.  </s>
<s> ownerDocument is a read-only attribute that always points to the document that created it (or perhaps in the future, that it was transferred to).  </s>
<s> When a child is removed from the parent, the parentNode attribute becomes null.  </s>
<s> Was this what you were asking?  </s>
<s> Ray Whitmer ray@imall.com  </s>
<s> I don't really understand what the problem is.  </s>
<s> Document.cloneNode  </s>
<s> with a shallow copy would just be another Document identical to this one but without children.  </s>
