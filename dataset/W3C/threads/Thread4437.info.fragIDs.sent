In the table summarizing accessor functions (Section 2): 1. 
It says that the data function accepts "zero or more nodes". 
This 
should now say "zero or more items". 
2. It says that the base-uri function accepts "Element, document or PI 
node or no argument". 
This should now say "zero or one node of any kind". 
Thanks, Priscilla 
Fixed. Thanks! 
All the best, Ashok 
Are you sure that base-uri is defined on attribute nodes and -- in the XPath case -- on namespace nodes?

I guess it depends what you mean by "accepts". 
As I understand it the base-uri function _accepts_ those node types, it just isn't very useful for them since it returns the empty sequence. 
While we're on the subject, I think the current wording for the base-uri function is confusing. 
At the end of the first paragraph, it says "The base-uri of all other node types is the empty sequence", "other" meaning not document, element or PI nodes. 
Someone not reading this closely might interpret that as saying that the base-uri function returns the empty sequence for those "other" node types. 
This is not true of text and comment nodes that have parents, as explained in the next paragraph. 
I think that sentence can be removed. 
Thanks, Priscilla

Base URI on an attribute is essentially a convenience function: the base URI of an attribute is always the same as that of its parent element. 
This is where the confusion comes from.
