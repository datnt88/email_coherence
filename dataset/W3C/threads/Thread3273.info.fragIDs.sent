After I have publish (2004-02-28) my danish survey about governmental/national/municipal authorities and their use of W3C standards (HTML/XHTML standards). 
Then I have got some e-mails with the question "What about Danish private companies and the W3C standards?". 
I have now made a minor survey about this issue. 
I have made a test on the 250 largest Danish companies home pages. 
The picture is 62 % is missing the DOCTYPE-Declaration 25 % have problems with encoding Only one company did follow the W3C standard 100 %. 
This gives 0.4 % of all the 250 tested home pages

Another interesting document I think if we publish a method and tools/templates to create such a survey, It might be possible to encourage people to do the same in their own country. 
I'm pretty sure 
for example the interop group in France would be happy to run such a survey. 
It might also help us to identify where the efforts are needed and it will attract the press on such results. 
* Is there a small group of volunteers on this mailing list to start such a guide? 
The thread we already had on the list will make it easier to write.

Well, I've got both..., see for pretty-printed sample output for the invalid W3C XML Schema homepage, http://www.w3.org/XML/Schema , and see for 371 such reports for all W3C Member homepages. 
I look forward to (X)HTML documents generated from the latter :-) regards.
