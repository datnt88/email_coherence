<s> Two of my students offer the following comments on TRACE:  </s>
<s> From: Louis Discepola disc7701@sparky.cs.nyu.edu  </s>
<s> The protocol states that "a TRACE request MUST NOT include an entity".  </s>
<s> For someone writing a server program, this requirement implies that the server program must check that this condition is upheld.  </s>
<s> But after reading a line of data from a client, there is no way for the server program to distinguish whether it received the first line of an entity body or the fist line of a badly formatted request line.  </s>
<s> It cannot therefore reply with an accurate response code.  </s>
<s> I suggest that the HTTP/1.1 specification clearly force the client side to enforce this requirement.  </s>
<s> From: Catalin Floristean floriste@slinky.cs.nyu.edu  </s>
<s> The specification states that if the request is "successful" it should return a 200 message containing the whole original request as message-body but does not define what successful means.  </s>
<s> Understandably, it should be checked for correct syntax and semantics, but how far should the semantic check go?  </s>
<s> Specifically, in the case where the  </s>
<s> Request-URI is the URL of a resource and not "*", should the origin server also make sure that the resource exists and is readable?  </s>
<s> Since the intention is just to provide a loop-back trace method (otherwise a HEAD request would do), probably a syntax check and a basic semantic check (the protocol version, presence of the Host header containing the correct host/port in case of HTTP/1.1) should suffice and this fact should be clearly stated.  </s>
<s> Also, it would help if it were stated clearly that the request headers apply to the trace response (e.g. a TRACE request with a "TE: chunked" will have it response's message body -- the trace -- chunked) and that a "*" URI is allowed here (although this could be implied from other sections).  </s>

<s> 1) The presence of an entity is signaled by the presence of an entity header, such as Content-Length or Content-Type.  </s>
<s> Without some indication that there's an entity there, the server must assume there is none.  </s>
<s> 2) I don't necessarily agree with the assertion that the "server program must check".  </s>
<s> The statement that "a TRACE request MUST NOT include an entity" is more a requirement on the client.  </s>
<s> It equally well means that  </s>
<s> if a client does send an entity, then there's no guarantee about how the server might/must respond.  </s>
<s> In particular, consider three scenarios: a) If the server is written with the assumption that there's never an entity, then, on a persistent connection, it would assume that the next line that follows the end of the previous request would be a new request line, not part of an entity.  </s>
<s> b) OTOH, for that same example, if there happen to be entity headers in the TRACE request (but there's no entity) and the server is written to  </s>
<s> read an entity, even though one is not defined by the specification, then the second request would be interpreted as an entity, not as a request.  </s>
<s> c) The server in the second example could instead return a 400 Bad Request because there's an entity implied by the headers, but TRACE does not permit one.  </s>
<s> The specification is quite imprecise about what to do in many error cases.  </s>
<s> It is mostly concerned with what's supposed to happen if you do things the right way.  </s>
<s> 3) The specification can't *force* the client (or server) to do anything.  </s>
<s> The "MUST NOT" you cite is about as good as you can do.  </s>
<s> How can you make the client "enforce this requirement"?  </s>
<s> Either it does the right thing or it doesn't.  </s>
<s> 1) I think the wording "If successful, the response..." is poor English.  </s>
<s> (It isn't the response that's successful!) Perhaps it should say "If the request is valid, the response...." What constitutes a valid request is sprinkled through the specification.  </s>
<s> 2) I think the student is trying to read too much into the specification.  </s>
<s> The description of the response says only that the request message should be returned as an entity.  </s>
<s> It says nothing about checking the Request-URI or the resource so-identified The topic of what to do when something is unstated often comes up in discussions here (and I often raise them :-).  </s>
<s> If the specification doesn't say to do something anywhere, then don't do it.  </s>
<s> In this case, a server might or might not check the syntax of the Request-URI, but it need not check the resource so-identified.  </s>
<s> I think we've been here before.  </s>
<s> "TE: chunked" doesn't say the server *must* chunk the response.  </s>
<s> It says the client would accept "chunked".  </s>
<s> But for an HTTP/1.1 request, that fact is implied and, therefore, the header is redundant.  </s>
<s> Dave Kristol  </s>
<s> It can distinguish this with a CRLF pair.  </s>
<s> Because a TRACE request cannot contain an entity as per the specification, then anything after the CRLF pair (not including additional CRLFs) would have to be considered the beginning of a new request.  </s>
<s> However, another question to ask would be how a server should handle a TRACE request when a Content-Length header, for example, is included.  </s>
<s> Should the server simply read in the entity in any event even though it's forbidden by the spec (I'd think so, in keeping with being lenient), and then just not return it with the response?  </s>
<s> Or should the server respond with the entire trace?  </s>
<s> Or should the trace, in this case, be answered with a 400 status code?  </s>
<s> I think we all missed the point of TE. "TE: chunked" is never required since chunked encoding is *always* acceptable, correct, working group?  </s>
<s> Adam  </s>
<s> I would just make a general comment here: it is true that in most cases it is easy to infer common sense answers to these questions, e.g. it is common sense not to check the resource identified by the Request-URI of a TRACE request.  </s>
<s> The point is though, for some reason I still believe that a good, solid specification should rely less on common sense answers and more on clearly stated definitions, descriptions, terms etc. (even if this implies a reasonable amount of redundancy).  </s>
<s> I believe this leads to a rapid and reliable implementation (and that's how you get a big, ugly, hard-to-read yet complete ANSI standerd :).  </s>
<s> --Catalin  </s>
<s> If you're referring to the ANSI C standard, I had a small hand in that.  </s>
<s> The danger with adding redundancy, as I found out from the ANSI C effort, is that it's very easy to introduce inconsistencies.  </s>
<s> If you say, "Do a, b, and c" in one place and "Do a and b" in another, you invite incompatibilities.  </s>
<s> The safest way to write a standard that's consistent is to say each thing only once, if possible.  </s>
<s> As with the ANSI C specification, you cannot understand the HTTP specification by looking at just one part.  </s>
<s> Unfortunately you have to understand all or most of it as a unit.  </s>
<s> Dave Kristol  </s>
