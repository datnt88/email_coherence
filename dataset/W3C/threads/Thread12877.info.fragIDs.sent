more food for thought: From "Understanding Web Accessibility" chapter in Constructing Accessible Web Sites book * At the most basic level, web accessibility is about people being able to get and use web content. 
It is about designing web pages that people can present and interact with according to their needs and preferences. 
A primary focus of accessibility is access by people with disabilities. 
The larger scope of accessibility includes benefits to people without disabilities. 
While accessibility is presented here in its relationship to usability, it is important to remember that the fundamental point is the ability to access web content. 
What is nice to have for some people is required by other people for them to be able to access web sites at all. 
...Accessibility is more concerned with making web sites perceivable, operable, and understandable.... Accessibility can be defined as the quality of a web site that makes it possible for people to use it - to find it navigable and understandable - even when they are working under limiting conditions or constraints. 
Accessibility is about designing so that more people can use your web site effectively in more situations. 
Although most people consider accessibility in terms of disability, that is not the whole picture. 
A more broad definition of accessibility covers people operating under situational limitations as well as functional limitations: - Functional limitations pertain to disabilities, such as blindness or limited use of the hands. 
Functional limitations can be visual, auditory, physical, or cognitive (which includes language and learning disabilities). 
- Situational limitations relate to the prevailing circumstances, environment, or device. 
These limitations can affect anybody, not just people with disabilities. 
Examples include mobile devices and device limitations, such as having no mouse, or constraining circumstances, such as interacting with a web site through a computer integrated into a car's dashboard, where use of the hands and eyes is limited. 
Most of the legal requirements for accessibility are concerned with meeting the needs of people with functional limitations, or disabilities. 
Understanding the benefits of accessibility to people who are operating with situational limitations, clarifies some of the benefits to people without disabilities and the related business benefits of accessibility. 
*(available in PDF on-line pdf. 
Please don't pick on me about PDF! 
That was macromedia's decision. 
It is also available in reasonably-accessible HTML from the publisher, by sending in the book's registration card marked "CD". 
Please don't pick on me about that process! 
The book authors have complain incessantly about it. 
Feel free to share your disapproval with the publisher if you so choose.) 
One recommendation and one follow-up from discussion today: 1. 
A recommendation that I didn't think was worth taking up time on the call Repeat the explanation of the asterisk ("* indicates documents that are stable at this time.") as a footnote at the bottom of the page. 
Reason: Some people will not read it in the text. 
People commonly look to the bottom of a page for explanation of an asterisk indicator. 
2. Follow-up on space between list items Here's one way to put space between items in a list: in style sheet: li.spaceafter { padding-bottom: .5em; in page HTML: for example: http://www.uiaccess.com/resources.html
