<s> I was reading where Jonathan proposes closing 5.13  </s>
<s> by creating a mime type registration for OWL.  </s>
<s> [Speaking for myself, not RDF Core.]  </s>
<s> It seems the key aspect that it is recording is the entailment parameter which has a small set of fixed values: simple, RDFS, lite, DL, full (latter being the default)  </s>
<s> I was wondering several things: * Is this not limiting to the users - how easy is it to create a MIME TYPE parameter in a document (I'm thinking of the HTTP-Equiv meta you have to use in the HTMl family) * A fixed list of values seems odd to me from a semantic web architecture point of view - don't we use URI(-ref)s?  </s>
<s> * Your list assumes these parameter values are distinct and complete; surely there are more subtle relationships between them that would have to be put in this registration document?  </s>
<s> * If this is of such general utility would it be better to just add this to the RDF mime type draft?  </s>
<s> Seems occam's razor applies.  </s>
<s> * If this is such a key requirement, wouldn't it be better to add it to the OWL abstract syntax, and consequently the RDF/XML, such as a parameter off rdf:RDF ?  </s>
<s> I was told in personal communication that crawlers for some of this data use namespaces, file name suffixes to try to guess the appropriate semantics.  </s>
<s> Surely we can do better than that?  </s>
<s> It would seem to benefit from being several layers higher than (HTTP say) Content Type parameter Content Type Transfer Protocol File name suffixes, (looking for .owl  </s>
<s> etc.) abstract syntax being at the concrete syntax level where users have more control and can put it in the files directly.  </s>
<s> I'm not even sure how you'd enable people to generate all 5 types of entailment on one system using common tools such as apache - you'd need five filename suffixes.  </s>
<s> And which one would be .owl  </s>
<s> ?  </s>
<s> * Of course if it was put in rdf:RDF , the default would have to be RDF entailments, so that would mean OWL would have some more boilerplate in the header.  </s>
<s> This seems more of a brain dump since this is only a proposal by Jonathan.  </s>
<s> Cheers Dave  </s>
<s> I said:  </s>
<s> I worded that poorly, sorry.  </s>
<s> I meant to say, my comments are more of a brain dump of points that occurred to me on the idea rather than as a general comment on the document itself.  </s>
<s> Dave  </s>
<s> e-for-OWL  </s>
<s> To be honest, I wrote those down as parsed from an email by Dan Connolly -- and the entailment parameter just occured to me -- i.e. this is probably a half baked idea that I've posted for discussion.  </s>
<s> Indeed, this would be a better idea.  </s>
<s> e.g. application/owl+xml; entailment=http://example.org/OWL#DL  </s>
<s> My idea is that each value of the entailment parameter might license distinct entailments e.g. ex:foo rdfs:range owl:Class .  </s>
<s> ex:bar ex:foo ex:baz .  </s>
<s> simple: = nothing new RDFS = ex:baz rdf:type owl:Class .  </s>
<s> lite, DL: = error, classes can't be instances full: = ex:baz rdf:type owl:Class .  </s>
<s> Not a document under our control.  </s>
<s> Surely and media types are limited, not a perfect means to indicate semantics, particularly when any or combinations of several semantics might apply, but this is (just) a media type registration, not part of OWL syntax.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, this is not to say that a similar parameter off rdf:RDF would not also be useful.  </s>
<s> well, perhaps .rdf,  </s>
<s> .rdfs,  </s>
<s> .owll,  </s>
<s> .owldl,  </s>
<s> .owl  </s>
<s> ...  </s>
<s> Thanks, to be honest, I'm not sure that this is the solution to the problem of how to deal with the various possibilities of which entailments are licensed according to which part of the various specs, but this is a proposal on the table.  </s>
<s> Jonathan  </s>
