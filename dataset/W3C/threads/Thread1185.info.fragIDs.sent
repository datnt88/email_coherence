<s> Hi There, My name is Kobi and I'm using the JTidy.  </s>
<s> I am trying to parse piece of HTML content using the JTidy (for example HTML table), then I'm doing some manipulations on the loaded Dom.  </s>
<s> So far so good, but when I'm getting back the result the Jtidy returns the snippet HTML but with the HTML BODY and META tags... My question is how can I get only the snippet HTML without the added tags?  </s>
<s> Your quick answer will be very appreciate!!! Many thanks, Yaacov (Kobi) Pinhas Software Engineer  </s>

<s> In normal tidy it would be the --show-body-only option.  </s>
<s> Maybe jtidy has something similar.  </s>
