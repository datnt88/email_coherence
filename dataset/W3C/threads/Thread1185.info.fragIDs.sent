Hi There, My name is Kobi and I'm using the JTidy. 
I am trying to parse piece of HTML content using the JTidy (for example HTML table), then I'm doing some manipulations on the loaded Dom. 
So far so good, but when I'm getting back the result the Jtidy returns the snippet HTML but with the HTML BODY and META tags... My question is how can I get only the snippet HTML without the added tags? 
Your quick answer will be very appreciate!!! Many thanks, Yaacov (Kobi) Pinhas Software Engineer

In normal tidy it would be the --show-body-only option. 
Maybe jtidy has something similar.
