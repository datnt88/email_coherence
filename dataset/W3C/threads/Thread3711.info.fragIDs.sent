While reviewing the WS i18n usage scinario document, I have noticed that there is a semantic difference between XML and HTML language specs. 
In section 8.1 of HTML 4.01 spec at there is an example that reads: P Q lang="en" Her super-powers were the result of &amp;gamma;-radiation, /Q he explained. 
/P and: ...Interpreted as French... P lang="es" ...Interpreted as Spanish... P ...Interpreted as French again... P ...French text interrupted by EM lang="ja" some Japanese /EM French begins here again... 
From these examples and explanaition, the lang attribute just aids the client system to do a better job by giving it a "hint". 
The various elements with different lang attributes are *not* mutually exclusive. 
All of them are rendered. 
This HTML fragment: will result in both sentences to appear on screen. 
But in XML, the lang attribute provides a mutually exclusive, choice semantics, according to the description and examples given in Section 2.12 of XML 1.0: The screen would be empty if the above fragment (substitute lang with xml:lang) is interpreted by XML parser running in non English locale (or even in en-CA locale!). 
I wonder this deviation in semantics is a conscious decision made for XML. 
I also wonder if there should be a mechanism to provide a fall back lang tag so that at least one element is selected as a fall back when none of the alternative elements is chosen because of the mismatch with lang attribute. 
Has this been discussed?

Could you point out where you found the description. 
I couldn't. 
The section says "A special attribute named xml:lang may be inserted in documents to specify the language used in the contents and attribute values of any element in an XML document." 
To my knowledge, xml:lang doesn't regulate XML processor's behavior. 
And I believe that a XML processor must process (and report 
to the user) all elements and attributes in the document regardless the locale it's running in.

Yazawa-san, 
I guess you are right. 
As far as XML spec is concerned, it only regulate how the XML parser behaves. 
What I was worried was the application level semantics that the XML spec does not intend to address.
