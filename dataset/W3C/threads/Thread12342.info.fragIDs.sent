<s> Hello all, We will have a meeting today at 2:30 pm Boston time at meeting so we can put together a list of gaps that can be worked on in Bristol.  </s>
<s> The agenda is: 1. Charter, http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/charter4  </s>
<s> 2. Evaluation process specification, http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/ATAG10-EVAL  </s>
<s> 3. Face to face meeting tasks.  </s>
<s> 4. Device Independent Authoring Workshop http://www.w3.org/2000/07/diw  </s>
<s> 5. Conformance Tool Specification http://www.w3.org/2000/09/conf-tool  </s>

<s> ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE  </s>
<s> want to know what checkpoints a particular variety of tool must conform to for various levels.  </s>
<s> The rows could just as easily be things like "image editor", "save-as-html word processors", etc.  </s>
<s> This is in a very early stage.  </s>
<s> If anybody salutes this just suggest row titles and applicable checkpoints and I'll make one for that purpose.  </s>

<s> ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE  </s>
<s> Hi Everyone, The format I have been playing with for the images part of the conformance evaluation process involves telling the evaluator to perform a number of test tasks depending on the domain of the application.  </s>
<s> After each task, the evaluator is asked a number of yes/no questions addressing the accessibility issues related to the task.  </s>
<s> This type of process lends itself well to a form-based Web tool that can lead the user through the process, compiling the results as it goes.  </s>
<s> The tool can ask the evaluator to perform a task and provide two choices (done, not possible).  </s>
<s> If the evaluator selects "done" then the associated questions are asked, otherwise the questions are skipped and the next task is presented.  </s>
<s> In this way, the evaluator only needs to see the questions related to the domain of the tool.  </s>
<s> If we decide to do this, we should continue to work on the document version as the specification for the automated tool.  </s>
<s> After the document is done it should be very simple to convert it into a form-based wizard.  </s>
<s> Cheers, Jan Jan Richards Access Software Designer Adaptive Technology Resource Centre University of Toronto  </s>
