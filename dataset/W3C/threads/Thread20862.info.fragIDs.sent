<s> We have a fonts configuration file for GTK and GL versions.  </s>
<s> See: * Amaya/config/fonts.gl for the GL version on Unix platforms * Amaya/config/fonts.unix for the GTK version on Unix platforms * Amaya/config/fonts.win for the GL version on Windows platforms Unfortunately we didn't find time yet to develop the user interface that provides menus to update the fonts configuration file.  </s>
<s> Today, you have to copy the current used fonts configuration file in your AmayaHome directory (see info about Configuring Amaya) and to update it by hand.  </s>
<s> The development of the Amaya user interface is in progress and we are open to good suggestions about fonts management.  </s>

<s> Personally I would go with an interface similar to Opera which lets you first select the element and then choose a dialog box which has several characteristics to select like family, size, color.  </s>
<s> If the element list was arranged with the most likely to be altered at the top, it would be more efficient.... and of course the storage file could/should be a css stylesheet setting the font characteristics only.  </s>
<s> This would allow hand tuning!  </s>
<s> The selector should access the installed font directory on the particular o/s so that all registered font families can be used.  </s>

<s> Almost all font selectors I have seen make you work into a small properties dialog.  </s>
<s> This is cruel, specially for people with biger screens.  </s>
<s> It should be resizable.  </s>
<s> I can imagine two use-cases for font selection, the "fast" and the "touristic".  </s>
<s> The fast one is about somebody that knows exactly what she wants bus can't write the full font name by heart.  </s>
<s> In this case it would be fine to allow the user to start typing characters of the part of the name she remembers with focus into the list.  </s>
<s> THe list should react shrinking itself to display only those font names that contain the typed partial text.  </s>
<s> Not those that *start* with the typed text but those that include the text somewhere in the name.  </s>
<s> The user can then shrink the list up to the point where there is only one item or where is practical to select from within a few elements using the mouse or the KB arrows.  </s>
<s> The touristic selection is about somebody looking around for an interesting font without a neat idea of what he wants.  </s>
<s> In this case the dialog window should be resizable, with a generous area where to show a sample.  </s>
<s> Don't use lists for properties that have a few options like (Bold | Plain | Foo | Bar), it's much better to use radios, because all options are visible at once.  </s>
<s> You already know this ... :-) Only: related options are easier to identify when they are clustered togwther and equally spaced and aligned.  </s>
<s> See Style ==  Character style ...: The names of the frames would be better if slightly bolded, one could spot them much faster.  </s>
<s> Notice that this dialog has a "default" option anywhere, this is very good!  </s>
<s> If color is to be selected then use the regular Amaya color picker, for consistency.  </s>
<s> If I were to set the priorities, the fast option should be first, then the other if ever.  </s>
<s> From a marketing point of view the touristic is a "feature", but you can't sell a browser based on it's font selector.  </s>
<s> Naybe in it's overall ease of use.  </s>
<s> Well, enough ... I hope this is useful.  </s>
<s> Please write me if something is not clear.  </s>
