HSwayne's action item for the 3/11/02 teleconference... Suggest adding a new high level section to the end of the current Appendix A: Techniques for user prompting document to explain this particular issue in more detail. 
Prompting of real-time/live authored content If an authoring tool is producing real-time/live content the ability to wait for the critical point (i.e. publishing) to intrusively alert or prompt the author is lost. 
While at the same time, authors in this environment tend to be less receptive to intrusive alerts and prompts. 
Below are some suggested techniques for authoring tools of real-time/live content: *If the author is only communicating with one other individual, assume that they know each other and will communicate in a way that is acceptable to both users. 
Therefore by default use unintrusive prompts and alerts. 
To illustrate this consider an author communicating with a hard-of-hearing associate, it is unlikely that the author would need to provide a textural equivalent to an audio files, since it would be unlikely for the author to send this individual that type of document, opting instead to rely on textual based communication. 
*If the author is communicating with a small number of individuals, assumed some may be unidentified users with disabilities. 
Again is recommended to use unintrusive prompt and alerts. 
*If the author is preparing for a live presentation, the authoring tool does have the opportunity to provide both intrusive and unintrusive prompts and alerts as the tool becomes aware of the content the author is planning on presenting. 
To illustrate this consider a professor preparing for an online class, as she imports an image to be used in her lecture she could be prompted to provide an alternative representation of that image. 
*If the author is communicating with a large number of individuals, and no preparation environment is provided, a mechanism should be provided by the tool to designate an individual from within the live community to provide the necessary supplemental information to assist an individual with a disability. 
In a conventional meeting room this individual could be a sign language interpreter or an individual quietly providing an explanation of visual images to the person sitting next to them. 
In a large chat environment, this communication could be provided through a separate channel between the designated assistant and the participants needing this alternative information (moving us back to a one-on-one communication model). 
This suggestion also preserves the main communication environment/flow. 
As always is most effective to allow the author to choose the types of prompts they would like to receive. 
Allowing the author to also choose to the type of prompts based on the type of real-time/live communication they are using would be even more powerful.

I think Heather has captured some of the nuances .... and shown how hard it is to come up with a good solution - the most telling point is that people will want to choose how their computer/software treats them - and they will probably choose for it to be silent unless they are convinced they are getting helpful advice from it ... but the difference is broadcast vs interaction surely? 
and then we might ask, how reasonable is it in real time interaction to determine if there are accessibility needs not being met? 
guess this is not what we want users to have to do? 
Hi Heather, I've taken the ideas I was working on for real-time authoring added added them to your. 
Thoughts? 
Special Case: Prompting of real-time/live authored content When authoring tools produce real-time/live content, the luxury of prompting on a user configurable schedule is lost to a large degree. 
In addition, authors in real-time/live environments tend to be less receptive to intrusive alerts and prompts. 
There are several factors that must be taken into account in order to address prompting in real-time authoring: 1. Determining Need: If a real-time/live communication takes place between individuals with no special communicative needs, there may be no need for real-time prompting (but see Archiving, below). 
However, the author may not personally know all the special communicative needs of the participants (even if the author knows everyone personally). 
The tool might be able to facilitate a decision about providing supplements by asking participants which types of supplemental material they wish to have made available and then prompt the author (or see Assistant Author, below) to provide these (preferably during Preparation Time, below). 
When it is not possible to know the needs of everyone participating in a communication, the tool should assume there are unidentified users with disabilities. 
2. Archiving: Even if there are no individuals with special communicative needs participating in the original real-time/live communication, if the communication is archived, the potential for accessibility problems increases. 
Therefore, the authoring tool may include an option that allows the author to run through the original communication without interruption and then, once the communication is finished, take the author through an intrusive prompting process to check for and repair accessibility problems prior to archiving. 
3. Assistant Author: In some cases it may be possible to designate a secondary author in the live community, who can receive and respond to the intrusive prompts for supplemental information generated as the primary author proceeds uninterrupted. 
The secondary author might be an unrelated specialist, analgous to Sign language interpreter, or a co-author (helpful for describing technical drawings, etc.). 4. Preparation Time: If the authoring tool allows the author time to pre-assemble materials for a live presentation (e.g. a professor preparing for an online class), this authoring is not considered real-time authoring. 
The authoring tool has the opportunity to provide both intrusive and unintrusive prompts and alerts as described elsewhere in this document. 
For example, when the professor imports an image to be used in her lecture, she could be prompted to provide an alternative representation of that image. 
In the end, if the author must provide real-time/live supplements, but has no preparation time or Assistant Author, then the authoring tool can facilitate the inclusion of supplements by: -Providing previously used supplements as defaults (see ATAG 3.5) -Providing voice recognition of author speech input. 
-@@[what else?]@@ -allowing the author to choose the types of prompts (intrusive or unintrusive) that they would like to receive.

Nice, I totally forgot about Archiving. 
I'm not sure I understand what you mean by "Providing previously used supplements as defaults" in the last paragraph. 
Can we discussed at the next teleconference?

Thanks, your stuff was a solid start. 
Since that is a week from now, I'll quickly clarify here. 
I meant that, if the author is inserting multimedia objects etc. in a live environment, then even though she did not prepare, she may have used those objects before (in a Web page, etc.) and the tool may have saved supplements for them (a la ATAG 3.5). 
In that case, an intrusive prompt that asks only "I found this supplement for the object, is it appropriate, yes or no?" might be acceptable to authors. 
- Yes
