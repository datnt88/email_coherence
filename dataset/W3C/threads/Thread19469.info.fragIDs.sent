..\..\Icons\WWW\W3C_home is an image. 
It is used in the help files. 
What kind of image is it? 
No Windows 95/98 applications can view it. 
If you are going to have a multi-platform program you need to use standard images.

..\..\Icons\WWW\w3c_home is a PNG image (Portable Network Graphics). 
It's a W3C Recommendation since 1st October, 1996 and any Web application should support it. 
See http://www.w3.org/Graphics/PNG/ for more information. 
Regards Irene. 
What web application supports it? 
What bit mapped editor can view and edit it? 
Why it is not w3c_home.PNG 
so we know what it is? 
Why is PNG needed when we have gif, jpg, tif, bmp, pcx, cgm, eps, pdf, 
Jim FitzSimons 
IE4 and NS4. 
Opera may do as well. 
The new version of Paintshop Pro can (if I remember correctly), and probably several others as well. 
It would make sense. 
eps, pdf, I think PNG is intended to be the replacement format to GIF, as it's more efficient.

It is a problem with windows 95/98. 
I can not view the PNG files on my 
own computer. 
I guess windows needs a PNG on the end of the file to view it. 
I can view the PNG images with all my browsers on the internet.

Are you using Win95 or Win98 ? 
Because on Win95 there is no problem with PNG files even without .PNG in the file name. 
However, We have not yet make tests on WIN98.

There is one better reason, all about richts, see the PNG info at the W3 homepage. 
Note: the only thing we need is the capabilities to make vector oriented pictures. 
The best thing I have seen in this relation is the draw 
command on my old msx: - Simple drawing commands like: line (x0, y0, x1, y1, [options]) box (x0, y0, x1, y1, [options]) circle (x, y, r, [options]) [options] include: - line thickness - line color - line style (line, dashed, ...) - line picture (stretch, concatenate, ...) - fill color - fill style (...) - fill picture (tiled, centered, [see the xv application for more options]) - Complex drawing command: - draw (x,y, 'plotcommands' [options]) where plotcommands resemble plotting like go-ing up, down, left, right and things like pen-up and pen-down) In the above, the x , y and other position elements are pixels or percentages of the current box. 
Positive values start at the left or top and negative numbers start from the right or bottom. 
The box is a defined box like a box around a picture or a table cel. 
If not in a box, just the entire page (or frame cel). 
If it must be on the background or foreground should be an option and defaults to the order in the code (first is bottom, latter is top) Now I think of it, a special box can be the visual part of the screen: the picture fills the brouwser window and does not scroll if the page scrolls. 
On printing this one, the picture is on every page. 
This can be verry hard for some easy brouwsers but that also comes with tables and extentions like math.

Subject PNG "I think PNG is intended to be the replacement format to GIF, as it's more efficient." 
I believe that the main reason for the development and support of PNG by W3C was that GIF contains a patented algorithm owned by Unisys. 
They enforce licencing of the patent. 
Visit their web site to see the licence conditions. 
PNG was an alternative developed by a large community of software engineers and put in the public domain (I think). 
I am told that PNG has better interlacing and transparency and greater compression than GIF but less compression than JPEG and no animation. 
See URL http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-png Go to http://www.group42.com/develop.htm 
for a free implementation in C for PNG. 
Go to http://webreview.com/97/05/09/feature/pngeditors.html for a list of graphic editors supporting PNG. 
So, unless you wish to licence the algorithm (LZW) for a product, use PNG.

When this page is on a Web server, this allows the server to return the right format (png, gif, jpg, tif, bmp, etc.) according to: - the list of formats supported by the browser (specified in the http header) - the list of formats available on the server. 
It's called the content negotiation In our example, the W3C server returns w3c_home.PNG 
to Amaya and perhaps w3c_home.gif to another browser.

The W3C is working on it. 
See "What the Future Holds" in 
Irene. 
I just checked Windows 98 and it requires .PNG on the end to view the 
PNG images. 
Windows 95 is the same. 
The Browsers can view the images without the .PNG on the end but not any other application 
even paintshop pro. 
They all say unknown format when I try to load the image without the .PNG on the end. 
All of these applications have no problem with images with the .PNG on the end. 
I think it would be more standard to always include the .PNG on the end. 
Jim FitzSimons 
That works if it is on the server. 
It does not work if it is on a computer. 
Why not add the .PNG to the end of the image file name? 
All jif and jpg have a .jif or .jpg on the image file name.

This is fundamental to the Microsoft way of doing things. 
Microsoft work from file extensions, Unix works from looking at the first few bytes (although compilers look at extensions) and Macintosh and web servers use out of band file type information. 
Internet Explorer, applied to HTML, breaks the Microsoft rule in that it uses Unix rules, even when it should be using web rules, and will interpret files as HTML in spite of extensions and Content-Type declaring otherwise. 
(Some tools for Windows will use Unix rules, but will normally only be launched based on MS rules.) David Woolley - Office: David Woolley djw@bts.co.uk BTS Home: david@djwhome.demon.co.uk Wallington TQ 2887 6421 England 51 21' 44" N, 00 09' 01" W (WGS 84) 
In terms of semi-open standards, you already have Postscript and PDF (and in my view PDF is technically the right approach for most commercial web pages which are about form rather than content). 
Machine generated Postscript tends to look complicated but simple diagrams in hand coded Postcript really are quite simple. 
PDF is Postcript minus programming but with file structuring for fast navigation. 
It still has the same primitive graphic operations, but they have to work on numbers, not expression. 
There are also the ancient Unix draw commands and more recent FIG ones. 
Commercially, there is Shockwave.

Actually, the Flash format (but not Director) is open and there is a free Flash player (including Netscape plugin) for Linux already. 
This is a great format for vector animation, and perhaps also vector still images.

Aptly put... what is being observed is the Windows file name extension associations, the quirks thereof, and the attempts by various applications to work within (or possibly in spite of) the system ~design~. 
It can be done, but as you observe can be a challenge to do so. 
You are overstating it a tad,as there are some applications which have the smarts to do so. 
Please, if you wish to reference standards, include citations and do so accurately. 
I'm not sure of what you refer, but the PNG specification (W3C REC-png 1.0) at "8.1 File name extension" makes a ~recommendation~ (not a requirement) and indicates that _lower case_ ".png" is preferred. 
The issue here hardly seems to be one of standards, as Amaya seems to be behaving properly. 
Rather one of interoperability, to make the documentation more accessible, even on lesser-abled systems such as Windows. 
g As such, a desirable petty (but useful to some) improvement would be to change the names of PNG files to include a ".png" (lower case) file name extension. 
(If I understand correctly, such a change will likely be done in a future release.) /Harold 
ps. As far as Windows being a PITA in a number of ways, I think it fair to say that most of us who've made extensive use of a variety of computer systems over the years have also found other than Windows to be a PITA at times. 
Ergo, our goal here is to identify and deal with platform PITA issues, while trying to sidestep *.advocacy issues.

I hate windows but I have live with it. 
If you are going to exist in a meanfull way in the world you need to support windows applications. 
A smart application works and adapts. 
Very specialized things no matter how "superior" will die. 
I will welcome the interoperability improvement. 
This last statement fails interoperability. 
What is PITA? 
I have been using and programming different computer systems since 1963 and I am not ashamed to be stuck using windows now.

Your web site fails validation. 
Did your amaya to make your site.? Jim FitzSimons 
No: PDF is an approach for distributing documents, not for web pages. 
A web page is one page at a time to be seen in a brouwser, where pdf is aimed at documents of more than one page to be printed on your local printer. 
True: strip it to a core default (as with sgml -- html), change tags to sgml tags and there you have something I meant. 
NO: try to read any postscript in your favorit editor, it will not complain about characters outside the readable ascii range where a pdf file contains binary data..... 
Just select one to include in html.... 
CB Try not to let implementation details sneak into design documents. 
Corne' Beerse| Alcatel Telecom Nederland 
Just as HTML has moved towards being a page description language, PDF has moved to being a web site language. 
On a system that supports HTTP byte ranges, you can fairly efficiently access PDF a page at a time from the server. 
My main point, though, was that most commercial web page designers are trying to create page descriptions, not revisable, logical document structures, as a result, they are fighting HTML to get a controlled layout. 
There is nothing that intrinsically requires a PDF file to contain binary data, and, in fact, PDF 1.1 format files created by ghostscript are pure text, except for the comment, at the beginning, designed to trick mail programs into treating them as binary, and any bit mapped images. 
(PDF 1.2 allows the unpatented deflate algorithm, so these are compressed by ghostscript.) Conversely, although baseline postscript is printable, there is nothing to stop one using exactly the same compression filters as used by PDF. 
Note that the binary nature of PDF comes from the compression; the uncompressed data uses printable format numbers. 
The compression is compress or zip type compression, not binary coding of values. 
The structuring information in PDF (location of objects) does rely on exact character offsets, so requires that no DOS/Unix/Mac end of line conversions are done. 
This is a fragment of a valid real PDF file containing vector graphics (m is move, l is line) in text format. 
%PDF-1.1 %This line contains top bit set characters - I've removed them to %avoid going to quoted printable mode.
