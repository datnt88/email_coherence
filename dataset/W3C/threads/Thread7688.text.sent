At Jim Whitehead's request, I have updated my Internet-Draft, draft-ietf-webdav-dublin-core, on how to use Dublin Core metadata in WebDAV. 
This time it's much more coherent: since the Dublin Core group has defined an RDF encoding for Dublin Core metadata, I can use that syntax directly. 
The new Draft is attached, so I can get comments before resubmitting it. 
One important note: I have not been able to find the actual specification of the RDF encoding, only an example or two. 
Could someone from dc-general please give me a URL to refer to?

3 Introduction This document specifies a mapping for using the metadata vocabulary of Dublin Core ([DUBLIN]) in a WebDAV ([WEBDAV]) server. 
WebDAV defines a protocol for manipulating metadata on a Web resource; in WebDAV, an element of metadata is called a property. 
Dublin Core defines several metadata elements, with standard names and standard meanings. 
A server which stores Dublin Core metadata for its content may wish to make the metadata available as WebDAV properties; to forestall the emergence of incompatible ways to provide this functionality, this document defines a mapping from Dublin Core element labels into WebDAV property names. 
4 Mapping The approach taken in this mapping is to leverage the RDF encoding ([DC-RDF]) of Dublin Core. 
An [RDF] document encoding Dublin Core data would look something like this: Stracke [Page 1] INTERNET-DRAFT Dublin Core in WebDAV May 22, 1999 rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#" xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.0/" 
xmlns:dcq="http://purl.org/dc/qualifiers/1.0/" dcq:creatorType rdf:resource="http://purl.org/dc/schema/LastnameFirstname#"/ The mapping defined here works by identifying each subelement of rdf:Description with a single WebDAV property. 
Since WebDAV properties are expressed as XML elements ([XML]), using XML namespaces ([XMLNS]) allow different groups to define sets of properties without interfering with each other, the mapping is direct and one-to-one. 
In this case, the namespaces being used are URI:http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.0/ , URI:http://purl.org/dc/qualifiers/1.0/ , and URI:http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns# . 
To obtain the Dublin Core creator for the resource http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc822.txt , a WebDAV client would issue a PROPFIND method to the resource, requesting the dc:creator property: PROPFIND /rfc/rfc822.txt 
HTTP/1.1 Host: www.ietf.org 
Content-Length: xxxx The response to the request would provide the dc:creator element just as in the RDF document above. 
4.1 Complications A previous version of this document had some difficulties with advanced sections of the Dublin Core model. 
This version addresses these problems, but it may be useful to enumerate them for future reference. 
4.1.1 
Multivalued Properties A WebDAV property can occur on a resource only once, while a content item may bear more than one instance of a Dublin Core element. 
The Stracke [Page 2] INTERNET-DRAFT Dublin Core in WebDAV May 22, 1999 previous document defined an ad hoc XML syntax for listing multiple values, which drew criticism from people who wanted more general multivalued property support for WebDAV. 
This document is able to sidestep the problem because Dublin Core now has its own solution, and it is not necessary to create a new one. 
In the above example, if RFC-822 had multiple authors, the dc:creator element would contain multiple rdf:value elements. 
4.1.2 
Subelements When the previous document was written, some members of the Dublin Core group had plans to support more structure in their metadata, but had not yet defined a syntax for it. 
At this time, the debate over subelements is still not fully resolved, but the syntax in the RDF encding has been established: to add extra data on a dc: element, one nests a dcq: element within it, as a qualifier, as in the dcq:creatorType element in the RDF example above. 
5 Internationalization Considerations XML is an inherently internationalizable format, able to express any language or character set; as a result, all WebDAV properties, including the Dublin Core properties defined here, are internationalizable. 6 Security Considerations The security considerations of this mapping are those of [DUBLIN] plus those of [WEBDAV]. 
7 IANA Considerations The namespace defined here is isomorphic to the element namespace defined in [DUBLIN], so this document introduces no new IANA considerations beyond those of [DUBLIN].

Stracke [Page 5] Thanks for taking the lead on this John! 
Please go ahead and submit this draft, but after internally renaming it to draft-ietf-webdav-dublin-core-01 (the only other revision the IETF knows about is the -00 one). 
After quickly reading through the document, it seems to me that most of the pieces are in place, but I'd still like to see: * A complete list of the names of the WebDAV properties that correspond to each RDF element. 
I think this is as easy as creating a table similar to that in Section 5 of and you know they're going to be the same, as the element name, but I still think it makes sense to spell this out. 
* I'd feel much happier seeing a complete, non-trivial example done out. 
I'd like to see Example 14 from the document, (1) showing how a PROPPATCH would be used to set it, (2) showing how PROPFIND can be used to retrieve an individual property from this set (say dc:title), and (3) showing how PROPFIND can be used to retrieve a few (but not all) of the DC properties, and (4) showing how PROPFIND can be used to retrieve all of the DC properties in one request. 
* I think you should bring in the RFC 2119 terms and then use them to be more precise in some of the restrictions. 
In particular, I think the document should explicitly state that the abbreviated encoding MUST NOT be used, and that multiple instances of each element (like multiple dc:creator elements) MUST NOT be used. 
This is a nice draft! 
With the changes suggested above, it's fairly close to complete. 
But, I'd appreciate it if other people familiar with DAV and RDF would take a look. 
Also, extra bonus points to the first person to write a small utility program to allow me to save and read Dublin Core metadata on a resource. 
I suspect that using Jim Amsden's DAV4J client API (available at: - Jim From: w3c-dist-auth-request@w3.org [mailto:w3c-dist-auth-request@w3.org]On 
Behalf Of John Stracke Sent: Monday, June 07, 1999 1:40 PM Subject: Re: Dublin Core in WebDAV, revisited I was planning to ask them to let me call it -02, to avoid confusion with the unofficial -01. 
(In retrospect, I obviously shouldn't have released the -01 without submitting it; but it's too late now.) I'll probably mail in two files with different numbers, so they can pick easily. 
I'll take a look. 
Unfortunately, doing a table may be hard, because I'm using a hand-rolled XML-to-text converter (with custom tags designed for the kinds of things that are needed in Drafts), and I don't have anything like table . 
I might cheat and create a pre tag, though. 
:-) OK, sounds good. 
Right, OK. Thanks.

-- John Kirch | (Doing large chunks of quotation for the sake of the dc-general list, which didn't get Jim's post.) OK, done. 
(I wanted to try to get the IETF to accept it as -02, but, in off-list discussion, I was basically told that's been tried, and it won't happen.) So, dc-general, heads up: there's going to be an official Draft with the same version number as the unofficial one that's been on one of the DC websites since last fall. 
("Official" simply means "published in the IETF Internet-Drafts repository", of course.) 
You can distinguish them at a glance by looking at the first line: if it says "J. Stracke, Netscape", it's the old one. 
Done. 
I've done 1-3, but not 4, since there's nothing special about "all DC properties". 
(There is a way to get all a resource's properties at once, but it'd include non-DC stuff, so "all DC" would be the same syntax as "a few DC".) Done. 
The updated Draft is attached; if I don't hear any further comments, I'll submit it to the IETF later this afternoon.

3 Introduction This document specifies a mapping for using the metadata vocabulary of Dublin Core ([DUBLIN]) in a WebDAV ([WEBDAV]) server. 
WebDAV defines a protocol for manipulating metadata on a Web resource; in WebDAV, an element of metadata is called a property. 
Dublin Core defines several metadata elements, with standard names and standard meanings. 
A server which stores Dublin Core metadata for its content may wish to make the metadata available as WebDAV properties; to forestall the emergence of incompatible ways to provide this functionality, this document defines a mapping from Dublin Core element labels into WebDAV property names. 
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALLNOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and"OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [MUSTS] . 
4 Mapping The approach taken in this mapping is to leverage the RDF encoding Stracke [Page 1] INTERNET-DRAFT Dublin Core in WebDAV May 22, 1999 ([DC-RDF]) of Dublin Core. 
An [RDF] document encoding Dublin Core data would look something like this: rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#" xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.0/" 
xmlns:dcq="http://purl.org/dc/qualifiers/1.0/" dcq:creatorType rdf:resource="http://purl.org/dc/schema/LastnameFirstname#"/ The mapping defined here works by identifying each subelement of rdf:Description with a single WebDAV property. 
Since WebDAV properties are expressed as XML elements ([XML]), using XML namespaces ([XMLNS]) allow different groups to define sets of properties without interfering with each other, the mapping is direct and one-to-one. 
In this case, the namespaces being used are URI:http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.0/ , URI:http://purl.org/dc/qualifiers/1.0/ , and URI:http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns# , as specified in [RDF] and [DC-RDF]. 
To obtain the Dublin Core creator for the resource http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc822.txt , a WebDAV client would issue a PROPFIND method to the resource, requesting the dc:creator property: PROPFIND /rfc/rfc822.txt 
HTTP/1.1 Host: www.ietf.org 
Content-Length: xxxx The response to the request would provide the dc:creator element, and all its contents, just as in the RDF document above. 
4.1 Correspondences The following table illustrates the relationship between [DUBLIN] element names and [WEBDAV] property names. 
The dc: prefix is assumed to be mapped to the namespace http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.0/.

4.3 Complications A previous version of this document had some difficulties with advanced sections of the Dublin Core model. 
This version addresses these problems, but it may be useful to enumerate them for future reference. 
4.3.1 
Multivalued Properties A WebDAV property can occur on a resource only once, while a content item may bear more than one instance of a Dublin Core element. 
The previous document defined an ad hoc XML syntax for listing multiple values, which drew criticism from people who wanted more general multivalued property support for WebDAV. 
This document is able to sidestep the problem because Dublin Core now has its own solution, and it is not necessary to create a new one. 
In the above example, if RFC-822 had multiple authors, the dc:creator element might contain an rdf:Bag element containing rdf:li elements.

Qualification (Subelements) When the previous document was written, some members of the Dublin Core group had plans to support more structure in their metadata, but had not yet defined a syntax for it. 
At this time, the debate over subelements is still not fully resolved, but the syntax in the RDF encding has been established: to add extra data on a dc: element, one nests a dcq: element within it, as a qualifier, as in the dcq:creatorType element in the RDF example above. 
Stracke [Page 3] INTERNET-DRAFT Dublin Core in WebDAV May 22, 1999 5 Examples The examples in this section are based on Example 14 of [DC-RDF], showing how [WEBDAV] would be used to set and get the properties presented there. 
(Note that non-ASCII characters in Example 14 have been elided for the sake of the ASCII Internet-Draft format.) 5.1 Set with PROPPATCH 5.1.1

Specifically, the document discusses means by which the fifteen elements of the Dublin Core (as defined in RFC 2413) may be expressed using the Resource Description Framework (RDF) and encoded with the eXtensible Markup Language (XML). 
RDF-based mechanisms by which the 15 elements may be qualified are also introduced.

Spesifikt diskuterer dokumentet hvordan de femten elementene i Dublin Core (slik disse er definert i RFC 2413) kan uttrykkes ved hjelp av Resource Description Framework (RDF) og kodes ved hjelp av eXtensible Markup Language (XML). 
Videre introduseres RDF-baserte mekanismer for a kvalifisere de 15 elementene.

8 IANA Considerations The namespace defined here is isomorphic to the element namespace defined in [DUBLIN], so this document introduces no new IANA considerations beyond those of [DUBLIN].

11 Acknowledgements The triviality of this specification is due to the hard work put into [WEBDAV], [DUBLIN], [XML], and [XMLNS] by their respective authors and working groups. 
The need for this specification was pointed out (by Jim Whitehead, I think) during the variants discussion held after a meeting of the versioning design team of the WebDAV working group. 
Thanks to Liz Parrot for alerting me to the question of subelements. 
Thanks to Paul Miller for clarifying to me how [DC-RDF] handles multivalued properties.

Stracke [Page 10] Looks good to me -- submit! 
Since this document is pretty heavily based on [DC-RDF] have any idea on how this document is going to progress? 
For example, if your I-D were to be submitted as anything other than Informational, [DC-RDF] would need to be a stable reference (e.g., a W3C Rec, or an IETF Proposed Standard). 
Even if you only want to go to Informational, how stable is [DC-RDF]?
