<s> We took the whole 90 minutes and then some, today.  </s>
<s> I'm sorry I extended the meeting without asking.  </s>
<s> In fact, next week I think I'd like to stay within 60 minutes.  </s>
<s> With a few exceptions, we have pretty much met each other, and we've got a shared document that is moving in a direction that we're pretty happy with (http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/DataAccess/UseCases).  </s>
<s> It's now time to find text that we agree on.  </s>
<s> Discussing wording is feasible only to a small extent in teleconferences, and the more we do it, the more we disadvantage those that (a) live where the sun is not up while we're talking, (b) speak some language other than English, primarily, or (c) have colleagues they really need to discuss things with.  </s>
<s> So please review the UseCases document and send mail about anything that you think should change; include suggested text if at all possible.  </s>
<s> I expect Kendall will get back to you one way or another within a few days to a week ala "yes, thanks.  </s>
<s> done." or "yes, looks good; unless I hear arguments against in the next day or so, I'll put that in." "hmm...  </s>
<s> I dunno; I'd like to see more support" or "I don't quite understand; please clarify" or "hmm...  </s>
<s> I'm not sure what to do with that; please put it on the agenda, DanC" So between now and our May publication, I'm going to really emphasize the importance of (a) getting more done via email, and (b) when we resort to phone, having text already available to the whole WG in email (or a web page...) in advance of the agenda.  </s>
