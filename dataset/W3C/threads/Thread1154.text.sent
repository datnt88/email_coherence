'd like to register with the IETF a new charset - geostd8 according to [very] draft is attached - draft-giasher-charset-geostd8.txt would you be so kind to review, edit or/and comment it Charset name: GEOSTD8 Published specification: The proposed charset was published by Standartization Commettee of Georgia in May 1998. 
Order No.70 SSP 18.1-98 -- Information Technologies ???- 8-bit single-byte coded graphic character set -- Georgian alphabet -- Part II Person &amp; email address to contact for further information: Gia Shervashidze Georgian Internet Avenu Tbilisi Georgia WWW: http://www.gia.ge [may be] useful additionl info - code-points graphical view you can see here: draft overview about Georgian 'standards' here: note, that proposed and approved national standard [unfortunately] is not "unicode sequential". 
best regards, g.\ Just for my information, so that I am sure I understand it: - is it true that Georgian has no upper/lower case distinction? 
- the proposed charset can be used to write both Latin script and Georgian script. 
Right? 
It seems good to me - sending the draft to internet-drafts@ietf.org will make it public for 6 months; it may very well be a Good Thing to publish this as an info RFC so that it is permanently available. 
I-D submission is now closed before the IETF; you can send in the submission after December 15th. 
Good luck!

Both are right, contemporary Georgian (and proposed charset) is "case insensitive". 
see http://www.gia.ge/georgia/language.htm#Writing about writing system &amp; alphabet(s) in the chart http://www.gia.ge/g13n/geostd8.gif mentioned in the previous message only upper/lower half of single-byte table is shown, not-shown corersponding lower/upper half - ASCII. 
full description of charset is done in the attached document (in previous letter). 
did you meant any convenient/relevant/appropriate place for publishing it as Info-RFC? 
thanks, g.\ Just for my information, so that I am sure I understand it: - is it true that Georgian has no upper/lower case distinction?

I meant that you should send the document to internet-drafts@ietf.org for publication as an internet-draft, and then ask for it to be published as an RFC. 
This provides a stable reference for the registration.
