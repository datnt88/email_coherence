<s> I'm going nuts trying to find the java package org.xml.dom.*.  </s>
<s> Where can I find it?  </s>
<s> Steve Mato  </s>
<s> I'm really not sure what you mean, nor what you are exactly looking for.  </s>
<s> The XML java package for DOM is called org.w3c.dom.xml.  </s>
<s> But there is currently no java package available which implements the DOM as far as I know.  </s>
<s> For sure W3C hasn't provide any.  </s>
<s> The only material currently available is the draft specification of the DOM.  </s>
<s> This can be find at Arnaud Le Hors - W3C, User Interface Domain - www.w3.org/People/Arnaud  </s>
<s> Thanx for the reply.  </s>
<s> I was trying to rebuild the SAX &amp; SAXDOM java classes.  </s>
<s> The later is the file which refered to it.  </s>
<s> I found it in a most recent SAXDOM distribution.  </s>
<s> Thanx again, Steve Mato  </s>
<s> There was one distributed with SAXDOM.  </s>
