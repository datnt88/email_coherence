Hi Everyone, Just a reminder that the AUWG conference call will take place on Monday December 15 at the regular time.: 4:00 pm ET (617) 761-6200 ext. 
2894# AGENDA: (1) Face to face meeting planning (2) Proposed changes to draft of the ATAG References to WCAG See below. 
(3) Guideline 1 and ISO 16071 vs IBM (4) Review of Work items: (see below) (5) Other Technique Work Items (1) - Update techniques for guideline 1 (consider how 1.1 should be organized if either the IBM software guidelines or the ISO document are adopted, review the rest, asking what needs to be dropped or added?) = TIM (2) - Update techniques for guideline 2 (review all checkpoints, asking what needs to be dropped or added?) = LIDDY (3) - Update techniques for guideline 3 (review reliance on WCAG numbering in 3.1, review the rest, asking what needs to be dropped or added?) = JAN (4) - Update techniques for guideline 4 (add techniques for 4.2 (4.3, a.k.a 4.X still does not have success criteria yet), review 4.1 and 4.4, asking what needs to be dropped or added?) = GREG (5) - Take a wide of the document. 
Is it well structured? 
Is it easy to use? 
What is missing? 
= KAREN (6) - Update the references (Go through the document and adding or correcting references as necessary, update and repair the references page) = GREG (7) - Maintain the glossary (Ensure terms are up to date, keep synchronized with glossary in guidelines, both glossaries need to develop with an eye on other WAI and W3C glossaries) = KAREN I may not be able to make it to this telecon, because of a conflicting meeting. 
For my action item (3 below), I have done some preliminary mappings, which are in the attached files. 
Is this what you wanted? 
If not, let me know and I will revise. 
Best wishes, Tim Boland NIST Regrets for this.

I expect to have a sandbox up tomorrow or Wednesday showing some of my ideas like a combined Glossary for ATAG 2.0 _and_ the techniques. 
I'll post the address when it is ready.

In order to resolve this, we need definitive word from the W3C on whether references to non-free documents (i.e. ISO16071) are allowed.
