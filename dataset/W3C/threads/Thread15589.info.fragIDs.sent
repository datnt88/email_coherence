Please volunteer to write the summary for one of these guidelines: 1.2, 1.3, 1.7, 2.5 
Goals (as outlined in 11 December minutes [1]): to get more discussion on list, to get through comments, to be more prepared for telecons. 
Task: Summarize the issues related to a particular guideline. 
Collect the issues from Bugzilla using the information from Ben [2]. 
Summary template: Issues, Current wording, Past proposals, New proposals You may also want to list: dependencies between guidelines, assumptions (what assumption do you make when thinking about this guideline?), and rationale (why this guideline is important).

I volunteer to summarize guideline 1.3 (Information, functionality, and structure are separable from presentation). 
This happens to be one of my favorite guidelines since it is so fundamental which makes it widely applicable to different types of accessibility problems. 
Since this is such a broad guideline, I will need some time to write the summary. 
I expect I can send the summary to the list in the last week of February. 
If you need it sooner perhaps someone else can take this one.
