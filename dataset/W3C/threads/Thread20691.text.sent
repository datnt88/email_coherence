Hello, attached is a small file with comment symbols for HTML. 
amaya seems to misunderstand one comment. 
winfried [DJW:] The first and fourth variants are invalid in both HTML and XML. 
I'd be surprised if the the fourth wasn't invalid in SGML. 
As the latest Amaya is broken for me, what do you see, and what do you expect to see?

I guess you are referring to ! 
This is not a comment. 
There is no reason for Amaya to recognize that character string as a comment. 
Refer to: or your favorite SGML documentation.

Well ... actually ! is a valid (empty) comment declaration, at least in an SGML sense. 
HTML 4 spec is a bit unclear whether it allows empty comment declaration, but HTML 2.0 (RFC 1866) allows empty comment declaration and explicitly lists ! 
as an example in "3.2.5. 
Comments" [1]. 
On the other hand, ISO/IEC 15445:2000 explicitly says "[t]here shall be exactly one comment per comment declaration" in "12 Comments in HTML" [2], so empty or multiple comments in a comment declaration is not allowed in ISO/IEC 15445:2000, like XML. 
Of course !P is an invalid declaration. 
I would say, authors should avoid using empty comment declaration in HTML, on the other hand, HTML user agents should tolerate it.
