Hi, Recently I have noticed that I'm having a lot of problems connecting to your validator web site. 
I use it quite a bit for validating web pages and have found it to be a very useful tool. 
The error I get when I'm trying to connect is as follows: Gateway Timeout The following error occurred: A gateway timeout occurred. 
The server is unreachable. 
Is this a problem with your servers?

Hmm... had tried several times this morning &amp; the page didn't work, but as soon as I sent this e-mail, I tried again and (of course!) it DOES work now!
