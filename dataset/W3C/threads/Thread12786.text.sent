Was there an agenda for the meeting last Friday? 
My last mail from the list is from Chuck dated November 12 and from Judy dated November 11. 
I'm just wondering if I've been thrown of the list.

unquote aloha, helle! 
no, there wasn't an agenda for the meeting last friday, but the following topics were discussed: 1. Outreach updates 2. WAI Curriculum / Slide Set Update 3. AOL Case as an Outreach Issue 4. Brainstorming for Authoring Tool Working Group "FAQ" 5. Wrap-Up and Announcements i minuted the meeting and converted the minutes to hypertext and sent them to judy last night so that they can be posted in EO's web space... i apologize for not getting the minutes out sooner, but a small nagging thing called life kept me offline all weekend! if you would like, i can email you a plain ASCII copy of the minutes, gregory.. He that lives on Hope, dies farting -- Benjamin Franklin, Poor Richard's Almanack, 1763 Gregory J. Rosmaita unagi69@concentric.net
