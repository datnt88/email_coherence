<s> Appendix A.1 EBNF Technical It looks like that we cannot parse an expression of the form: "1" cast as xs:integer = "1.0" cast as xs:integer.  </s>
<s> Which is semantically the same as xs:integer("1") = xs:integer("1.0").  </s>
<s> Based on the precedence table, I would assume that cast as binds stronger than =, and from a composability point of view, I would also expect to be able to write the above.  </s>
<s> However, when following the grammar, it looks like the grammar pops out without consuming the =.  </s>
<s> Here is the parse process: "1" is consumed by Expr- SingleExpr- OrExpr- AndExpr- InstanceOfExpr- TreatExpr- CastableEx pr- CastExpr- ComparisonExpr- RangeExpr- AdditiveExpr- MiltiplicativeExp r- UnaryExpr- UnionExpr- IntersectExpr- ValueExpr- PathExpr- RelativePat hExpr- StepExpr- FilterStep- PrimaryExpr- Literal- StringLiteral Which then pops back to CastExpr that consumes "cast as xs:integer" Then we pop back to the top and realize that we have left overs and raise a parse error.  </s>
<s> This is also a problem for the related treat as, castable as etc.  </s>
<s> Hi Michael.  </s>

<s> Since the November document, the WG has agreed to change the precedence of  </s>
<s> instance-of, treat, castable, and case (in response to a previous issue  </s>
<s> raised [2] by you).  </s>
<s> The precedence table is now looking more like: 1 (comma) 2 FLWORExpr, some, every, TypeswitchExpr, IfExpr 3 or 4 and 5 eq, ne, lt, le, gt, ge, =, !=, , =,  ,  =, is,  , 6 to 7 +, - 8 *, div, idiv, mod 9 unary -, unary + 10 union, | 11 intersect, except 12 instance of 13 treat 14 castable 15 cast 16 ValidateExpr, /, // 17 [ ], ( ) so that these operators bind much more tightly.  </s>
<s> In the most recent test parser, your expression parses fine: Type Expression: "1" cast as xs:integer = "1.0" cast as xs:integer |QueryList  </s>
