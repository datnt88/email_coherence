<s> David HTML Tidy looks like an interesting program, but I think converting it David to Autoconf/Automake standards would make it more easily maintainable David by the legions of GNU developers.  </s>
<s> This would probably make it easier David to build on all the many varied UNIX systems out there (and possibly David Windows).  </s>
<s> Finally, it gives a lot of control to the installer in David deciding where and how to install it.  </s>
<s> David I've already taken a quick whack at that conversion and could send David it to whoever would like to see it (its not that hard).  </s>
<s> There are a David couple of questions I have, though, that would help in the conversion David (note: I have not yet gotten to trying to use tidy): David * What are the GIF files for (tidy.gif and grid.gif)?  </s>
<s> * In David order to make the name more specific, would you mean if it was David called "htmltidy" instead of "tidy"?  </s>
<s> * Have you thought of doing David documentation in plain text and then converting to HTML?  </s>
<s> David Anyone interested in this?  </s>
<s> I did it because it's in keeping with David the installation of other tools we use here.  </s>

<s> There may be differences between GNU and w3c licensing concepts that you ought to investigate...  </s>

<s> Hello David [humm... lots of Davids or Daves on this list... ;-)], The original page of HTML Tidy [http://www.w3.org/People/Raggett/tidy/] is included in the downloadble source archive, and with it the two GIF files (the icon in the header and the grid in the background).  </s>
<s> As far as I know, this is the only use for them.  </s>
<s> I agree regarding the naming, but have one objection: "tidy somefile.html" is simply more intuitive than "htmltidy somefily.html"... thus, if you decide to rename it, you should at least provide an alias (symbolic link on Unix, batch file on DOS), what do you think?  </s>
<s> Other than that - I had no problems at all compiling Tidy on my Linux machines (nothing but calling "make"), and since only one file ("tidy") is actually needed, "installation" is as easy as copying this one file to where you want it to be... sebastian  </s>
