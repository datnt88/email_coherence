Is there any legal requirement to have accessible web pages when the target audience is not the public?

This depends where the pages are, what they are for, and who they are for. 
For example, in Australia, the Disability Discrimination Act would generally apply to a case where an employee could not use an intranet, or to where an employee was not hired becuase they had a disability that meant they could not use some corporate system such as the intranet. 
A government agency such as a government department, University or a public school would, as far as I understand the act, not be able to make the defense that it would cost too much to change this. 
I understand that the law is different in the USA, but that many of the same results would aply in particular circumstances. 
I am not a Lawyer, and this is a legal question. 
In addition, it is one that needs to be answered on a case by case basis. 
So I would suggest that unless you are certain of the laws applicable to you, you should be aware that there really is a potential that you will have to ensure your intranet is accessible. 
just my 2c worth.

Doesn't the DDA say something about employers making provision for employees to be able to do their job. 
If info pertaining to someone's job is put on an inaccessible page on an intranet then that would seem to me to be a contravention of the DDA. 
That's the assumption I'm working on anyway.

Dear Gavin, An extranet could well be accessed by the public, so in that case accessibility most definitely is something that requires thought. 
I would also say that for internal, browser-based applications it makes sense to carry accessibility through. 
This would surely be the case if it were corporate communications, or an offering that was made to the workers (such as social clubs, other work-related information that is used to help a person do their job) that could not be accessed by, say, a blind worker. 
I think that on a commercial scale it is always best to advise clients of the pitfalls, even if there is no precedent set in court about it (as there is not, yet, in the UK), so as to essentially cover them should an employee find that they cannot access required information through an alternative browser, for example. 
And, of course, cover yourselves should the client find themselves in a compromising position! 
If the work is for a government agency, or a site funded by public money, then I believe that it would be classified under the guidelines for websites that will be published in the UK in May 2002. 
This means that accessibility is a major priority for sites such as these. 
The following article is from Warwick University and regards accessibility for students who access information through an intranet application, so this might provide some information that can then be fed to the client.

There is also the following that relates to Section 508 and intranets, which might also help in some ways: http://www.access-board.gov/sec508/guide/1194.22.htm 
Although I work for an agency that is perhaps considered a "rival" of Zentropy (or maybe not *grin*), would it be possible to know in which sector the client is in, as this may well have a bearing on the answers that you receive? 
Or, is this just a general question? 
I hope that this information has been of help to you. 
Good luck with the project

The legal requirement is often higher in such cases. 
If your company uses an Intranet that is not accessible to a particular individual then that individual couldn't work for you. 
If you don't hire someone because of a disability that doesn't directly affect their ability to work (i.e. they could do the job if it wasn't for your Intranet's poor design) then you are guilty of discrimination in employment. 
The requirement there would be to make proper provision for disabled employees, without discrimination. 
An inaccessible intranet might violate that requirement. 
There may be a little more flexibility, inasmuch as the employer can make provision for employees affected on a case-by-case basis. 
However, if you find yourself with a prospective employee for whom no solution compatible with your network can be found, then you would probably need to argue that the situation had arisen in spite of your best endeavours, and really can't be helped. 
That's going to be a very difficult argument to make if you haven't followed the WCAG. 
Don't forget: it's not just current staff, but prospective future staff, who will have to (be able to) use the intranet! 
help companies meet their obligations (among other things).

Clients are thinking about accessibility and thoughts are turning to their own extranets - these are large commercial companies.
