<s> All: Due to some internal administrativa, this weeks WSTF teleconference has been moved to TOMORROW at 3:00 PM Pacific (5:00 PM Eastern).  </s>
<s> Sorry about the late notice.  </s>

<s> It is not a feature.  </s>
<s> First, a correction: With 3h between the coasts, this doesn't add up.  </s>
<s> It's actually 2pm Pacific, please don't miss it (it's at 6am my time, and I don't want to get up for a teleconference that doesn't take place).  </s>
<s> Second, a wish/proposal: Starting next week, I propose the following time slot: Tuesday, 7pm Eastern / 4pm Pacific (this is 8am in Japan) Tuesday at 6pm Eastern doesn't work, because it overlaps with the Core TF teleconf.  </s>
<s> or alternatively: Wednesday, 6pm Eastern / 3pm Pacific (this is 7am in Japan) (of course, an hour later is no problem for me :-) Regards, Martin.  </s>
<s> Wednesdays at 3PM Pacific Daylight don't work for me because I hold a meeting at that time.  </s>
<s> But Tuesdays at 4PM Pacific Daylight are fine.  </s>
<s> I have always wished that my computer would be as easy to use as my telephone.  </s>
<s> My wish has come true.  </s>
<s> I no longer know how to use my telephone.  </s>
