<s> Anne P., Jonathan, How do some of the pages linked to from "IPL Youth Collection: Reading Zone--Picture Books" at meeting your standards for "reading optional" sites?  </s>
<s> I have CC'd this page's author because it is a shame to me that an "index  </s>
<s> of picture books" (like this page is):  </s>
<s> 1)Has a large and distracting navigation sidebar (the attractive and inviting icons take away from the resources on the page).  </s>
<s> IMHO this material belongs only at the bottom.  </s>
<s> 2)There are no representative pictures for the links to the various picture books!  </s>
<s> This omission is tragic!  </s>
<s> This means that non-readers who find their way to a book they like will have a heck of time finding their way there again (on another day)!  </s>
<s> (Assuming that they have this IPL picture book page indexed in some usable way.)  </s>
<s> For reasons I cannot fathom, those who create web sites are not following the most basic of structures used in children's books and picture books &amp; magazines for older folks, putting the graphics on the page with (or facing) the text it applies to.  </s>
<s> You might take a look at http://www.ipl.org/ for kid appropriate content.  </s>
<s> Regarding: http://www.ipl.org/cgi-bin/youth/youth.out.pl?sub=rzn2000  </s>
<s> I didn't suggest that website for the purpose of providing an exemplar for the use of images to strongly support meaning or to replace text.  </s>
<s> I understood  </s>
<s> that Anne was looking for kid appropriate stories and content for a home  </s>
<s> schooling task.  </s>
<s> One of the great features of a web page is that it can be saved then altered for one's own purposes when used for learning.  </s>
<s> Educators are catching on to the fact that the web page content is malleable.  </s>
<s> You still need to buy a book or CD-ROM to get the very best of children's literature with images that strongly support meaning and intended affect.  </s>
<s> I expect that will be true till there is full agreement on issues of commerce, security and content preparation by the eBook standards group.  </s>
<s> Then, the most current and high quality content will have to be paid for by the consumer.  </s>
<s> By the way, images are just one alternative form of information for non-readers.  </s>
<s> Talking browsers with synchronized highlighting provide support for children and adults who cannot read as well.  </s>
<s> The hard work is ahead.  </s>
<s> How  </s>
<s> do you provide support that will encourage kids to read on their own when they  </s>
<s> can but provide text-to-speech support when they cannot?  </s>
<s> We have been working  </s>
<s> on this problem but have much to do to accomplish what Al Gilman described as  </s>
<s> "even strain".  </s>
<s> Chuck  </s>
<s> Searching for a solution that suits all is well beyond current abilities.  </s>
<s> Providing a picture alternative is not.  </s>
<s> jay@peepo.com  </s>
<s> a www for those learning to read.  </s>
<s> Please send us links to your favourite websites.  </s>
<s> Our site www.peepo.com is a drive thru.  </s>
<s> When you see a link of interest, click on it.  </s>
<s> Move the mouse to slow down.  </s>
<s> It is a graphical aid to browsing the www.  </s>
<s> We value your comments.  </s>
<s> There would be a huge problem getting a cognitively disabled reader to find the picture books.  </s>
<s> They must be able to read enough to find the material they can enjoy ....  </s>
<s> Once you get to the picture book, the navigational controls are graphical and don't include "Next Page" on them.... you have to guess that the arrow moves you through the book.  </s>
<s> But, if cognitively disabled folks can always count on a teacher or caretaker to take them to the right part of a site, the IPL site is useful for some children and perhaps entertaining for cognitively disabled adults.  </s>
<s> For Taylor, my newphew, the site was a near bust.  </s>
<s> He's past reading the pictures books and the bedtime stories are beyond his ability to read himself (he's in 3rd grade: the stories available are Alice in Wonderland (7th gr reading) and the Little Lame Prince (similar level but I haven't tested it yet, may be lower).  </s>
<s> Many sites to link from ipl go to "classics for children", but they invariably include only the guttenberg offerings in e-text (none of which are written low enough for Taylor to use to learn to read, or offers to buy the books.  </s>
<s> If I was trying to set up a year's worth of work following the Universal Design idea of CAST, I would be stopped dead in my tracks planning for its use in third grade.  </s>
<s> I am finding some of the content needed for science, the study of survival pattersn, migrations, hibernation, and eating habits of animals, but much of it will have to be read to Taylor instead of his reading it himself.  </s>
<s> Nothing has shown up yet useful for his learning about matter, energy and simple machines.  </s>
<s> I've found a little for his social studies in the beginnings of civilization, but it is spotty and will need a lot of supplementaation (buying books) for him to learn the fullness of the concept anticipated by the state objectives.  </s>
<s> You are absolutely right.  </s>
<s> The user cannot get to these sites without help from someone who can read.  </s>
<s> The site should be designed so that once a user clicks on the icon for Youth on the opening ipl site, everything to get to the desired books is user friendly for children.  </s>
<s> I had to go back twice to see what you were referring to.  </s>
<s> So, no, it isn't distracting, at least not to me.  </s>
<s> This is a bad flaw.  </s>
<s> The kids have to be able to read one or more sets of high-level content words (text version, illustrated version, etc) to get to the beginning of the story.  </s>
<s> Once you get to the story, it's OK, but getting there will depend on an adult or older person guiding the young reader.  </s>
<s> Sorry it took so long to reply.  </s>
<s> I spent all day Sat. studying the CAST site and pursuing some of the links there, picking out what had material with potential and finding lots of stuff I can't use for a 3rd grader.  </s>
<s> I spend much of yesterday with the ipl site, looking specifically at the offerings for "youth" on reading.  </s>
<s> I've looked at everything from that set of links except fables (which I will do today).  </s>
<s> I haven't looked at the math offerings yet because for at least the first part of the year he will be working with operations of whole numbers and I can create materials for his lessons easily on my computer by using the random number generator in excel and spitting out reams of worksheets to do to firm up and expand his computation skills.  </s>

<s> The talking browsers must allow viewing of the graphics as well as  </s>

<s> Chuck, children are likely to progress from text-to-speech to reading on  </s>
<s> their own when the content permits on their own, because once they can read, reading is faster than listening to the text read to them.  </s>
<s> (perhaps  </s>
<s> some research to be sure this happens would be in order?)  </s>
<s> The "even strain" probably needs to be applied individually rather than to a class at a time, and will require coordination of the material, the teacher, the student, and if motivation is critical, the parents and significant others in the student's life.  </s>
<s> I'm not sure you can do much with the "even strain" from a distance.  </s>

<s> Jonathan, You hit the crux of the matter.  </s>
<s> An initiative that has encouraged the development of high-tech solutions to reach the blind and the motor-impaired, low-tech solutions to aid the color-impaired, has a much  </s>

<s> The resistence to this  </s>

<s> I don't know that I would agree with your characterization of the WCAG that classifies the requirement of things like ALT tags as "high-tech".  </s>
<s> Sophisticated computer users (who definitely were high-tech), and who happen to be blind, discovered, much to their chagrin, that it didn't matter if: 1) They were very skilled; 2)They had the latest and greatest computer / browser / screen reader; Poorly written HTML documents could still be inaccessible to them!  </s>
<s> That is what the WAI is about.  </s>
<s> There are users who, until the World Wide Web, could handle just about any word-processing, spreadsheet, or database document that came their way.  </s>
<s> Then, this new medium comes along.  </s>
<s> It's electronic -- so it should be so much more accessible than paper.  </s>
<s> But, because too many authors are taking shortcuts, artificial and unnecessary roadblocks are being created!  </s>
<s> The WCAG is meant to try and stem this tide.  </s>
<s> The audience Anne P and Jonathan are trying to reach NEVER WERE SOPHISTICATED COMPUTER USERS.  </s>
<s> So why does it follow that the Web should be put into a format that is digestible to them?  </s>
<s> The WCAG is about REMOVING  </s>
<s> and PREVENTING roadblocks that, in an electronic medium, are totally avoidable.  </s>
<s> It is like we are creating buildings for the very first time and at the beginning someone has the insight to mention how much nicer  </s>
<s> ramps are than steps.  </s>
<s> We would not have to put in curb cuts if we did not create curbs in the first place!  </s>
<s> If sites that house picture books are not functional to non-readers, well how the heck can general interest sites be made useable to this population?  </s>
<s> Let alone, how can we create specifications that tell others how to do this?  </s>
<s> Well, I am tired and cranky and obviously on a rant.  </s>
<s> I'll shut up now.  </s>
<s> Thank you for your time.  </s>

<s> I suspect that you have not heard anyone who is blind using a flat,  </s>
<s> non-expressive voice, at 500 words per minute.  </s>
<s> Kids often try this too but it  </s>
<s> is not unusual for kids using text-to-speech to gain access to subject area content in spite of reading difficulties to move through the materials faster than their reading peers.  </s>
<s> I am not recommending it as an approach for speed, but it can be faster.  </s>
<s> It is not uncommon for middle school kids to set the reading rate to 225 or 250 words per minute.  </s>
<s> Chuck  </s>
<s> No, I've been told it can be done, but have never heard one in operation.  </s>
<s> Without having experienced it, but having experienced a flat non-expressive voice at a "normal" rate of speed, I don't think I would be able to stand it.  </s>
<s> Kids often try this too but it  </s>
<s> If this is so (I don't doubt it, but it's the first I've heard it), I can understand your concern about having children move from listening efficiently to reading inefficiently.  </s>

<s> Bruce, Hope you're feeling less cranky today.  </s>
<s> So that they can become sophisticated computer users.  </s>
<s> Are you saying that if computer hadn't been invented we wouldn't have to be figuring out how to include people with all disabilities to the table?  </s>
<s> The same way the picture books site can be functional INCLUDE MEANINGFUL GRAPHICS so that a user can get to where he or she is going on that site.  </s>
<s> It's like putting the picture books on the top-most shelf in the library --- out of reach to the users without help from others.  </s>
<s> Carefully, sincerely, openly and acceptingly.  </s>
<s> Just as we want folks to act towards any other accommodation for persons with any disability.  </s>
<s> I honestly don't think that the folks first to the table should be turning away the newcomers.  </s>
<s> A hearty welcome, along with welcoming accommodations would be so much better.  </s>
