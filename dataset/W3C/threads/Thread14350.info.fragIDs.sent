One of the major shortcomings of our work is that we are (mostly?) all still hung up on printed stuff. 
THIS IS THE WEB - HTML AND ALL THAT! 
Our document need not be like something to be printed out in order to read it in the comfort of one's favorite chair. 
There is a feature on many pages in which one lands on a particular item and a box of explanatory (contextual help) text shows up. 
If you read: 2.5 Ensure that the logical structure of the content is preserved in the markup or data model, together with any additional semantic distinctions that facilitate rendering of the content in the visual, auditory and tactile modalities. 
and then push some key and have superimposed on it enclosed in a box: 
The logical structure of the content needs to be explicitly preserved for two purposes. 
First, it allows style rules (other than those provided by the author) to be applied, thus enabling the content to be presented effectively and appropriately in different modalities, with a range of output devices. 
Secondly, it provides the basis for structural navigation by the user. 
In order for the content to be rendered in all three modalities, it is also necessary to capture such distinctions as emphasis and changes in the natural language or notation in which the text is written. 
Note also that if this guideline is followed, it will enable more sophisticated analysis of the content by search engines and other document processing applications. 
you have: 1) saved "real estate" on the screen making for a less daunting reading/viewing/listening experience; 2) saved cognitive loading; 3) avoided a "duh" for those who know what was meant in the first place. 
It would help both those who see the first rendering and would say "I knew that" when forced to wade through the explanation part and those who "click it up" and say "Oh! now I understand what that means." 
We aren't making full use of the medium. 
It doesn't have to be presented as a whole. 
It doesn't have to be printed out. 
It should serve as an exemplar of what hypertext medium is all about. 
Inline links are so underused as to make one wonder if we really believe in this stuff. 
Love. 
ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE 
Well, this is true for presentation on the web. 
But for a number of reasons people have by and large not learned to read hypertext yet, and do print stuff out to read on paper - especially as reference material. 
So we need to cope with that circumstance too. 
Since printing HTML until recently has not been particularly well handled by many browsers we have even provided other formats that might print better. 
The use of CSS would enable a lot of this to work in both media... Charles McCN One of the major shortcomings of our work is that we are (mostly?) all still hung up on printed stuff.

Yes and no. 
Our document need not be like something to be printed out in order to read it in the comfort of one's favorite chair. 
However, our document needs to take audience into account, and, at the very least, offer a print-worthy version. 
People _will_ print out W3C specifications if they are working with them. 
_I_ print out W3C specifications, and I'm about as "wired" as you can get. 
(I have a copy of WCAG 1.0 on my Windows CE machine, even.) 
I don't know. 
There's no good cross-platform way to do this easily, especially for people with disabilities, and it may give the wrong impression.

This might be an interesting way to present such information. 
I'd have to see an example of someone else doing this first, and it working -- and I think that our "real specification" shouldn't have to rely on these tricks at all, and should stand alone.
