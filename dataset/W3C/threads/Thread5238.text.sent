Personally I feel that in most cases the cause is lost for existing **emission systems** (e.g. TV, DAB, DVD) adopting TT. 
Not at the authoring level and at a level midway between authoring and emission. 
Absolutely - TT will hopefully be ideal for authoring, storage, QA and pre-transmission manipulation. 
Case in point: I know one broadcaster that has the idea (not a very solid one, in my view) of converting all subtitling and even closed captioning to Microsoft Word files (!) that are simply pushed through at airtime, rather comparable to live-display captioning. 
Hmmm! 
Current multimedia standards (eg SMIL) are generally not appropriate for subtitling. 
That's a tad broad. 
By subtitling I am referring to my admittedly narrow perspective of subtitling and captioning of broadcast video. 
I have looked at SMIL and Quicktime and cannot see how to reconcile the timing aspects of these standards with the timecode in an external broadcast signal (where the timecode may be discontinuous due to advert insertion). 
Comments please?

It is necessary to distinguish between media play time, such as represented by the NPT mechanism, and a broadcast transport stream's program clock reference (PCR). 
The latter (PCR) is indeed discontinuous at insertion in/out points; however, the former (NPT) is not. 
In the context of SMIL, it is generally the media time that is used when expressing syncbase offsets.

My throw-it-out-there-and-see-what-sticks Proposal 0.0, which uses the SMIL timing model, illustrates how relative timing works. 
The SMIL timing model also supports absolute timing. 
-- Charles Wiltgen In response to: Actually isn't it the other way round? 
In broadcast transport stream (by which I assume you mean a DVB stream) the PCR is always continuous (but wraps at just over 24 hours). 
Discontinuities in PCR would have a disastrous effect on the decoder. 
It is the apparent media play time prior to the encoder that is discontinuous. 
The timecode I refer to here is the VITC or LTC timecode seen by any equipment in the broadcast chain downstream from the switch that effects the changeover between program and advert. 
It is common practice for a broadcast program to be timecoded starting at 10 hours. 
Adverts tend to be timecoded from 1 hour (this helps engineers tell the material type from the timecode display on the front of the tape machine!). 
So when playing out a program the timecode will start at 10 hours and go forward 1s per s. 
When an advert occurs the timecode will jump backwards to 1 hour then go forward. 
Several backward jumps will probably occur! 
When the interrupted program resumes the timecode continues from the program timecode value prior to the ad-break. 
Subtitle inserters have to match the apparent timecode in the broadcast signal with an absolute timecode value in the subtitle file and output the appropriate subtitle. 
Hope this helps!

No, PCR is indeed often discontinuous in real life broadcast usage. 
See ISO 13818-1 for the details. 
All real world MPEG-2 decoders accommodate this reality.
