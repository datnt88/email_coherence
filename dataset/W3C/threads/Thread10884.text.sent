In the meeting of Dec. 18, the ERB discussed how we might start moving forward on hyperlinking. 
Attempts to proceed as we did with the base XML language, i.e. agree on a statement of principles and start subsetting an existing standard, seem fraught with difficulty; in particular it seems very difficult to separate the meta-discussion of design goals from the discussion of implementation details and standards compliance. 
To help get things going, and after running this idea past the ERB, I am introducing a proposal entitled Minimum Progress Required to Declare Victory. 
The idea is to continue running with the XML premise; that you can do a lot with a little. 
In particular, we should be able to offer the Web community something subtantially better than they're used to without having to go very far. 
It should be borne in mind that to do a good job on specifying even a little, you have to fight through some surprisingly hairy problems (as witness our recent experience on this list). 
This is an attempt to spot the low-hanging fruit in the hyperlinking jungle. 
Sensible reactions to this proposal include: - suggestions that we add facility X, because it's easy and useful - suggestions that we add facility X whether it's easy or not because it's such a basic need that we're wasting our time if we leave it out - suggestions that we remove facility X, because it'll get us in trouble - suggestions for compliance, at some level, with some existing standard - meta-suggestions for good ways to structure this discussion - comprehensive yet compact fully thought out proposals for a hyperlinking facility, supported by multiple public-domain reference implementations This will presumably launch us on a fairly free-form discussion ranging from philosophy through implementation, which is no bad thing at this stage. 
At some point we will have to impose structure on the discussion and generate a draft and so on; this point will doubtless arrive before many of us are comfortable that we're ready. 
Speaking unofficially, but I think on behalf of the ERB, it seems that the breakneck pace at which we plowed through XML was on balance a good thing, and we'll try to stick with that. 
Having said all this, I should emphasize that while the ERB gave me the OK to post this and get things going, it is *not* a position of the ERB, and no hint should be taken that we are leaning in this direction or any other. 
Once again, it will be helpful if those responding use subject lines to help sort out threads. 
I'll place an HTML version of this at Minimum Progress Required to Declare Victory 1. Background The Web is the largest working hypermedia instance. 
It supports one widely-used form of hyperlink, the A or Anchor element. 
These links are unidirectional and [this is a basic design principle of the web] specify basically nothing about their target except its location. 
The links carry no typing or role information, beyond the unconstrained text that may be found between the A and /A tags. 
HTML offers another hyperlink facility, the LINK header element, but it is not widely used. 
Web links support a variety of behaviors, governed by the interaction of the "scheme" part of the URL (http:, file:, ftp:, mailto:) and the logic in the "User Agent" (typically a browser). 
It might be argued that there are really a smaller number of behaviors (a) retrieve and display, (b) retrieve and save, (c) send mail; but the number of behaviors exceeds one. 
There are a variety of other standards that support hyperlinks, of which the most visible are HyTime, part of TEI, and in the area of object naming, the IETF URN work. 
None of these, at this moment, has overwhelming market acceptance, or credibility at the level enjoyed by SGML. 
HyTime has ISO's blessing, URN has the IETF's; TEI is used to encode many billions of bytes of text. 
2. Minimum Progress on Deliverables The minimal deliverable is a smallish document (smaller than the XML spec) with an independent existence and name - for example, XHA for Extensible Hyperlink Architecture. 
The hyperlinking mechanisms should be applicable to XML of course, but also to SGML and (to the extent possible) to HTML. 
XHA should have no dependency on XML. 
However, we may choose to build special machinery into XML (reserved elements/attributes/archforms) to optimize support for XHA. 3. Minimum Progress on Hyperlink Enhancement The minimum set of hyperlink constructs should: 3.1 subsume the existing WWW Anchor semantics in a smooth and natural way. 
3.2 provide a hyperlink mechanism with richness similar to that of the HyTime "ilink" construct. 
This means that the link - has a type, - has multiple ends, each of which has a role, and - may be located away from any of its ends, thus supporting links into read-only material. 
3.3 support addressing at least by URL and ID attribute, alone or in combination. 
4. Minimum Progress on Behavior The minimum set of behavior machinery should provide: 4.1 mechanisms for users to identify and describe behaviors associated with hyperlinks. 
4.2 predefined behaviors equivalent to those already in wide use on the Net. 5. Minimum Progress on Link Roles The minimum set of link role machinery should provide: 5.1 mechanisms for users to identify and describe roles for link-ends. 
5.2 predefined link roles equivalent to those already in wide use on the Internet Cheers, Tim Bray tbray@textuality.com

+1-604-488-1167 There is a vital element missing here - the ability to address part of an object that does not have an ID (or a name attribute if we are to fully meet 3.1) associated with it. 
If we are going, as claimed in 3.2 to "support links into read-only material" we have to presume that the objects we are pointing to have not been named in a reasonable way. 
Therefore we need an addressing mechanism that can identify any part of any document. 
URL and ID are not sufficient, either alone or in combination. 
I would also argue strongly for letting a single anchor role point to mutliple locations, which is not possible when you say "has multiple ends, each of which has a role". 
Anchor roles can type location sets, just as the ilink construct allows you to type links. 
Incidentally, in the HyTime TC ilinks will become a deprecated form: the extended HyLink architectural form will subsume their role and would form a better basis for this work. 
(More on this later, if Eliot does not beat me to it!) Martin Bryan Martin Bryan, The SGML Centre, Churchdown, Glos. 
GL3 2PU, UK Martin, your contribution addresses two points in the MPRDV note, which could either be identified by number (3.2sub2, 3.3) or name (addressing un-ID'd objects, link-end to address sets.) To achieve some sort of order in this discussion, it would help if people would use the "Subject:" line to support discussion threads at a level somewhat narrower than "Hyperlinks".

+1-604-488-1167 I would say that FRAME , IMG APPLET , OBJECT , etc. are also a form of hyperlink... Thanks for beating me to this one. 
Yes. 
Objects and applets are what the MID considered, xenoforms, calls to external apps for which we could provide parameters. 
Eventually, we found we also needed to describe the behavior, (goto, gosub, spawn). 
Too much to do tonight. 
Glad this discussion has begun in earnest.
