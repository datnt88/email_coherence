<s> Perhaps if you explain your problem, people will be more likely to understand why they should respond.  </s>
<s> I can't see that big of a problem, as long as the keyboard and the mouse work as usual for typical tasks.  </s>
<s> Certainly not as big a problem as popups.  </s>
<s> This doesn't interfere with the standard keyboard mechanisms, and doesn't interfere with clicking except with a click-and-drag operation.  </s>
<s> It prevents selecting text and right-clicking on my browser, and it fails to let me click on the links on the page in Firebird, but that's just universally bad design.  </s>
<s> Stupid?  </s>
<s> Absolutely.  </s>
<s> Broken?  </s>
<s> You bet.  </s>
<s> Inaccessible?  </s>
<s> Not necessarily.  </s>
<s> It would at least pass WCAG 1.0 Checkpoint 8.1 at Priority 1 because the functionality is presented elsewhere (i.e., within the browser).  </s>
<s> And the left mouse button can be ignored when using this script, which should leave regular page interaction for most users.  </s>
<s> I doubt many sites will see any benefit to introducing a feature that users won't understand, discover or use.  </s>
<s> Things like popups and CAPTCHA became a problem because companies had an economic benefit to implementing them, accessible or not.  </s>
<s> There is no such benefit to this "feature."  </s>
<s> It only does (poorly) with a mouse what is well-implemented via keyboard shortcuts in the browsers.  </s>
<s> Of course, the place to implement gestures is in the user agent, where the user can configure it, or disable it.  </s>
<s> The big three browsers already have mouse gesture support built in or bolted on: m  </s>
<s> Like some others, I really do not see a big accessibility issue with "mouse gestures" as they can, if properly implemented within a browser, can be turned off.  </s>
<s> It seems that an implementation that would NOT disable the function of the right mouse button would be important but this is really a user agent issue for the most part).  </s>
<s> As stated, so long as the function of the keyboard and mouse are NOT compromised when "mouse gestures" are turned-off - seems like not such a big deal for most users.  </s>

<s> WAI-GL crap is also prevalent and more germane to our discussion.  </s>
<s> In all fairness to my esteemed colleague, he does glancingly bruise an important point.  </s>
<s> WAI needs a much more real-world evaluation of issues that straddle browsers and content.  </s>
<s> Pop-up windows; longdesc handling; user stylesheets; and frame and iframe handling are topics that come to mind.  </s>
<s> WAI's reflex in such cases tends to be simple: BAN IT! even though none of the people advocating the banning has ever bothered to survey the existing uses of those technologies, let alone ways to deal with inaccessibility that do not force authors to rewrite their work the WAI way.  </s>
<s> I certainly agree with Phill's posting:  </s>
<s> The whole point of my earlier post was to question the logic of where to place the burden of removing the barriers, where to place the burden of doing the transformation?. Options include the author, the browser+assistive technology (including server side), and the user's configuration settings in the Operating System/platform.  </s>
<s> The only way to accommodate both those who want multiple windows opened - and - those who need to only have one is for the assistive technology, browser, and/or the operating system/platform to handle it.  </s>
<s> When we place all the burden on the author, by telling her that she can't use code that opens the help page in a new window, then everyone unfairly gets the same result.  </s>
<s> I do not agree with placing overlapping checkpoints in the various guidelines.  </s>
<s> For example if we place a requirement in WCAG to require the author to tell the user that the link will open in a new window, and then we also tell the user agent in UAAG to also notify the user that the link will open in a new window, then what the end users ends up hearing is: "opens in a new window, opens in a new window" twice.  </s>
<s> As a user I can turn off the second announcement, if the browser and/or assistive technology will allow, but how do I turn off what the author placed in the content?  </s>
<s> As an end user I can't go randomly deleting text, nor is it always efficient to ask the author to add more notation to conditionally exclude some of the text.  </s>
<s> My working philosophy for today is: If we have a chance to offload what would otherwise be a Web Content Accessibility Guideline onto one of the other guidelines, let's do it.  </s>
<s> WCAG WG tends to screw up more than the other working groups do.  </s>
<s> WCAG WG also seems less clueful about the Web, and more contemptuous of it, than the other working groups.  </s>
<s> The more we let other working groups handle these issues, the fewer problems we'll have after everyone's guidelines are frozen and published.  </s>
