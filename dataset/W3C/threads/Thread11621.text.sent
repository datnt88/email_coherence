Hello, everyone, I am new to this list, and I did not see this question in the archives. 
In this question, I will be referring to the French and Spanish translations of XHTML 1.0 which are located at: French: http://www.la-grange.net/w3c/xhtml1/ 
Spanish: http://leo.worldonline.es/jlgranad/xhtml/xhtml1.htm An object model is a model for an object in any language, I am sure. 
But... In French we have: Mod?le Objet de Document HTML = an object model of an HTML document. 
In Spanish we have: Modelo del Objeto Documento de HTML = a model of the HTML Document Object Have I understood these translations correctly? 
Is only one of them correct? 
Is the HTML Document Object Model: (1) an object model of an HTML document; (2) a model of an HTML document object? 
Or, is the translation of this simply language-specific? 
Thank you, - Zeno Hi Zeno, I don't think both interpretations are so different, DOM is (1) an object model of the HTML document, and assumingthis description in terms of object oriented description, it is (2) a model of the HTML document object. 
Anyway, any suggestion on the translation will be appreciated. 
Thanks, Juan.

I agree that in English, the distinction is unimportant; the phrase is clear without any analysis. 
However, I wish to translate the phrase correctly, so I must examine such things. 
Please allow me to include the following separate excerpts from the DOM, which have been cut from different paragraphs: The Document Object Model provides a standard set of objects for representing HTML and XML documents, a standard model of how these objects can be combined, and a standard interface for accessing and manipulating them. 
The name "Document Object Model" was chosen because it is an "object model" in the traditional object oriented design sense: documents are modeled using objects, and the model encompasses not only the structure of a document, but also the behavior of a document and the objects of which it is composed. 
The structure of SGML documents has traditionally been represented by an abstract data model, not by an object model. 
In an abstract data model, the model is centered around the data. 
In object oriented programming languages, the data itself is encapsulated in objects that hide the data, protecting it from direct external manipulation. 
The functions associated with these objects determine how the objects may be manipulated, and they are part of the object model. 
In the first sentence of the second excerpt, we are told that the name was chosen because DOM is an 'object model'. 
In the last sentence of the second excerpt, we are told that a document may be composed of multiple objects described by the (object) model. 
Because of these two statements, it seems clear that we are not speaking of a 'document object' at all, but an 'object model' describing possibly multiple objects within a document. 
We were discussing the following two possibilities: (1) an object model for an HTML document; (2) a model of the HTML document object. 
Surely, these are different, because from the DOM, we have seen that the second translation must be incorrect. 
There is a third which we were not discussing: (3) a Document Object Model for HTML. 
I think that our remaining (1) and (3) are closer in meaning than (1) and (2). 
In the first excerpt, we are told that "the Document Object Model provides a standard set of objects for representing HTML and XML documents". 
I can find nowhere in the specification where the DOM refers to HTML or XML, only to HTML documents or XML documents. 
Perhaps in an exercise of redundancy, one could say 'the HTML Document DOM' or 'the XML Document DOM', but that would be silly. 
Because of our above discussion of the 'object model' and the pairing of 'HTML documents' and 'XML documents', I believe that (1) is the correct translation (or concept). 
Your comments helped me immensely and I thank you for them. 
If you can see any flaws in my reasoning, please let me know! 
Otherwise, I will go with 'HTML-document object-model' or 'an object model for an HTML document'. 
Thank you, - Zeno
