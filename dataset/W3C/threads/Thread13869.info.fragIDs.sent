The techniques doc uses in some cases terms like "whenever possible" or "if possible". 
It seems redundent, as clearly authors are not expected to do the impossible in other cases, now do they?

I'm not sure exactly which item you are referring to but this language is generally used where it is likely that the guidelines will look unreasonable otherwise. 
It is to assure users that it is understood that this guideline will not always make sense or be possible.

The "whenever possible" qualification should already be conveyed in the priority assigned to the technique, and is redundant in the text. 
Moreover, even the guideline which advises authors to avoid deprecated elements and attributes, is unnecessarily impeded by the "whenever possible" proviso. 
It is in principle always possible to avoid deprecated features of HTML, just as it is always possible to avoid non-standard proprietary extensions. 
These guidelines should not be qualified in any way, except by their designation as "priority 2" recommendations. 
I think the problem was that people might suggest "That's impossible. 
Therefore these guidelines are not internally consistent. 
Therefore they are rubbish. 
Therefore I will continue to leave ALT text and NOFRAMES out of my website." 
(Or some like-minded piece of drivel) I am not sure that this is such a likely scenario, except among those looking for a rationalisation to explain their failure to make an attempt. 
Those people will probably find another one. 
Another part of the story is time-dependent. 
C.1 says "Where possible use a W3C technology..." At the moment there is no W3C recommendation on images, although that may change soon. 
Likewise scripting languages, and lots of other goodies. 
So having the 'where possible' clause does allow the guidelines to be interpreted in light of the state of the art at the time of interpretation, rather than at the time of compilation.. 
So I am happy for it to be there, judiciously used. 
It seems much better than 'for the moment' or 'until such time as' which we had at one stage for some things.
