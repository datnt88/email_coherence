<s> Quick question.  </s>
<s> In earlier versions of Acrobat, it was not possible to make PDF files accessible if the files were actually developed on a Macintosh.  </s>
<s> Is this still the case with the latest version of Acrobat for the Mac (version 6.0, I believe)?  </s>
<s> Thanks for any information.  </s>

<s> Hello Loretta/Doyle, I am just not sure what the Make Accessible feature really does.  </s>
<s> I am a JAWS user and a PDF file is as usable or unusable as it was before I run the Make Accessible feature on it.  </s>
<s> I'll be glad if you can enlighten me on this.  </s>

<s> Sailesh, Make Accessible is a command that attempts to analyze an untagged PDF file and infer logical structure from the marks on the page.  </s>
<s> This would be used by an author who is trying to repair accessibility problems in an existing PDF file.  </s>
<s> The best analogy is that it is doing OCR on the logical strucure.  </s>
<s> Like OCR technology, it is imperfect, and the results should be reviewed and corrected, if necessary, by the author.  </s>
<s> In Acrobat 5, this command was only available on Windows.  </s>
<s> In Acrobat 6, it is available for both Mac and Windows.  </s>
<s> When the Adobe Reader 6.0 is presenting an untagged PDF file to assistive technology, it automatically runs MakeAccessible internally to infer logical structure.  </s>
<s> This can make loading an untagged PDF considerably slower than loading a tagged PDF, but makes it possible, for example, to read tables even in an untagged PDF.  </s>
