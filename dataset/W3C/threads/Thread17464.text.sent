Hi Folks, I am pleased to pre-announce Hera, Sidar's web-based evaluation tool. 
I am pre-announcing it because we think that you can use it, but it is a beta and we know there are some things we haven't done yet. 
Try it at Among them is translating the entire documentation. 
It was written in Spanish (naturally enough) and although the basic procedure stuff is translated the very detailed help stuff isn't yet. 
There are also some pieces missing. 
But comments on these are welcome either in english to the WAI ERT list w3c-wai-er-ig@w3.org which is probably more appropriate or here (which I watch). 
Comments in spanish are welcomed by Sidar's G1 group (tools). 
Hera is mostly based on CSS style sheets that allow the user to identify various aspects of a page - a little like the Wave, but more step by step. 
For that reason it requires a good implementation of CSS to function properly. 
It is designed to work with Opera, but most of the important features work with Safari or Mozilla (we are working on a testing tool that will allow us to record which features exactly work where). 
It generates reports either as HTML or as EARL - W3C's RDF language for recording test results, using the latest working draft. 
It is available in both english and spanish, and is content-negotiated so you should get whichever version your browser asks for by preference (if neither, the default is spanish).
