<s> Here you are... Jean-Jacques.  </s>
<s> 221: I think the resolution is problematic.  </s>
<s> Agree.  </s>
<s> OK, how should we proceed.  </s>
<s> This issue is closed as far as the WG is concerned.  </s>
<s> 286: Add '(which may or may not also be SOAP  </s>
<s> intermediaries)' to first  </s>
<s> note?  </s>
<s> Sounds reasonnable.  </s>
<s> Done.  </s>
<s> 289: What does an intermediary do when it receives a fault?  </s>
<s> Is the fault guaranteed to be passed on to the original sender (  </s>
<s> or previous  </s>
<s> intermediary)?  </s>
<s> Since we don't indicate what happens when faults are generated in the first place, I think the most we can say is that intermediaries MAY forward fault messages.  </s>
<s> However, I am wondering whether this is not raising a deeper issue, which is how intermediaries forward response messages.  </s>
<s> I think sections 2.7.* are written from the POV of request messages; do they cover adequately response messages?  </s>
<s> Good question.  </s>
<s> What do the other editors think?  </s>
<s> 334a: Mention SOAP Response MEP????  </s>
<s> I don't think we need to.  </s>
<s> I also don't think we should.  </s>
<s> Done, issue closed in edtodo  </s>
<s> 334b: Seems to me that MEPs are one of the extensibility points in SOAP... So what do we need to say???  </s>
<s> I'm confused by the issue as well.  </s>
<s> Ignore?  </s>
<s> That's my gut feeling.  </s>
<s> Issue closed in edtodo  </s>
<s> 335: I don't think we need to change it, it is only an example...  </s>
<s> Agree.  </s>
<s> Done. Entry closed in edtodo.  </s>
<s> 352a: When refering to the QNames of types use QName production ( prefix:localname ) rather than 'localname'  </s>
<s> I think this would improve readability (although, strictly speaking, prefix should be replaced by the corresponding URI ;-)).  </s>
<s> Well, given we state in the intro what the prefixes map to that isn't necessary.  </s>
<s> I'll do a pass through the spec and make this change.  </s>
<s> 352b: Use textual identifiers for references rather than numerics  </s>
<s> I believe I have done this already about two months ago, after this were pointed out for WSDL... BTW, this is not a stylesheet issue, we only need to change the key in the bibtex entry (or whatever the XML production name is).  </s>
<s> You are correct, this has already been done.  </s>
<s> Thanks.  </s>
<s> 352d: Ensure all occurences of Infoset properties appear in square brackets; e.g. '[specified]' rather than 'specified'.  </s>
<s> The better long term solution would be to create and use a new XML element.  </s>
<s> We should then s/[/ prop /.  </s>
<s> OK, I'll put in the appropriate markup and update the stylesheet.  </s>
<s> 353a: Provide examples of 'struct' and 'array' from some  </s>
<s> programming  </s>
<s> language  </s>
<s> I agree with Marc, we should not do this.  </s>
<s> I also think this is out of scope for the primer.  </s>
<s> OK. Closed in the edtodo  </s>
<s> 353b: Provide at least one example for each section  </s>
<s> Possibly.  </s>
<s> 353c: I propose we change the section title from 'Rules for  </s>
<s> encoding  </s>
<s> Graphs in XML' to 'Mapping between XML and the SOAP Data Model' or some such.  </s>
<s> 20020820 MJG  </s>
<s> Works for me.  </s>
<s> Done.  </s>
<s> 357: Change DataEncodingUnknown to SOAPEncodingUnknown  </s>
<s> Sounds good.  </s>
<s> 373: suspect this issue really needs to be kicked 'upstairs' to the WG.  </s>
<s> Agree.  </s>
<s> OK. Mail sent to xml-dist-app.[1]  </s>
