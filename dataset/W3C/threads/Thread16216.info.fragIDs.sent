For those following the U.S. Section 508 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, WAI's comments have been submitted and are available at: 
While I cannot confirm this directly, I have heard from several people involved in submitting that the U.S. Access Board is still accepting comments through this week. 
If you are interested, you could contact them to confirm.

This is very well-written, Judy. 
Great work and thanks to everyone 
involved with working on this.

I appreciate the thorough and detailed comments WAI submitted. 
I find interesting the 508 generalizations and omissions that you have so carefully expressed. 
Your identification that the W3C work has copyright implications poses an interesting dilemma to the access board, as they pick and choose, and rephrase without W3C permission. 
The W3C WAI guidelines do refer to W3C recommendations, which do not always generalize to new means to convey information. 
A concern of the Access Board is to avoid locking into old and aging technology. 
Some of the W3C enthusiasm for developing consistency among their various, and rapidly evolving technical recommendations 
I hope you are right; the deadline was May 30. 
Minor typo in mis-transcribing from 508: In (b)(7) "carat" (a gemstone measure) should be "caret" (a pointer).

Harvey, 
It seemed that in the case of some of their rewordings, that their changes in meaning from WCAG Checkpoints may have been inadvertent (though very real). 
But that is one of the risks that occurs when rewording guidelines and checkpoints that have already gone through a long period of discussion among many parties -- some of the phrasings in WCAG may look a little labored, but they sometimes capture important nuances. 
The copyright implications have always been there. 
The advantage to publishing accessibility guidelines in a forum such as the W3C includes the visibility and credibility in the Web industry that the guidelines can acquire, which helps their promotion. 
At the same time, the guidelines fall under the same document-use policies as apply to other W3C work -- essentially these policies are in place to help promote as broad as possible use of common specifications on the Web, without creating a jumble of conflicting versions of those specifications. 
In other words, the document use policy is very encouraging of use, copy, and distribution without fee or royalty -- with some conditions though, including providing a link back to the original, acknowledging the copyright conditions, and providing the status of the document; and the license explicitly excludes permission for modifications or derivatives. 
(The document use policy is generally linked from any document on the W3C site.) The document use policy also states that W3C may on some occasions grant permission for derivative or modified versions. 
Among other things, this permission requires enough dialog to ensure that the work will not create misunderstandings about W3C documents, which have undergone an extensive consensus-building process. 
W3C _Recommendations_, in particular, represent work that the entire membership of W3C has endorsed, whether or not they have yet implementated that work in their own products. 
Some of the Access Board's changes actually lock their proposed provisions _more_ into old and aging technology. 
The WCAG WG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines Working Group) is currently looking into ways to make WCAG 1.0 even more friendly to advanced technologies, and welcomes all contributions to that discussion -- but I didn't notice things in the Web-related sections of the NPRM that more adequately address advanced technologies than does the current WCAG 1.0. 
I think something was missing at the end of your paragraph?
