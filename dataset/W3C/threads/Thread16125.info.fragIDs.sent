If members insist that the correct approach is textual. 
Please could they indicate where the W3C documentation on illiteracy &amp; cognitive disability and www accessibility is. 
I am still labouring through the large amount of mail and hope to answer some more tomorrow. 
this is a small plug sorry: Our site has recently been upgraded and I hope works due to caching this is a little difficult to check on. 
I suggest members interested please visit www.peepo.com and click on the second airplane for a display of 200 symbols most of which are generally understood and connected in a simple way. 
This part of the site is not linked onwards as yet. 
ideally any site that felt it appropriate could provide a "picon" or small image to aid searching for non-readers.

Our site www.peepo.com is a drive thru. 
When you see a link of interest, click on it. 
Move the mouse to slow down. 
It is a graphical aid to browsing the www. 
We value your comments. 
I, for one am very interested in your images but how do I "click on the second airplane"? 
I did manage to figure out that a Java enabled browser is required, that seems to reduce your possible audience. 
There are a lot of links listed, is one of those the way to your images for navigation?

This is not a sentence. 
I am having problems understanding you due to lack of correct English use on your behalf. 
I am not sure what obligation I have to understand you when you are not easily understood by _me_. 
Can you please provide _your_ documentation on how to make a web site more accessible to people with disabilities? 
I am getting pretty frustrated at lack of direct information; this may be all a subtle attempt to show what it's like to be cognitively disabled or something, but I would prefer some direct, cooperative examples that I can learn from and use, rather than these repeated accusations and demands.
