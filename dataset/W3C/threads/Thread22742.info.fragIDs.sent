<s> createElement method on L2 says in short that attribute nodes are automatically to be created if any.  </s>
<s> Does this rule also apply to the new createElementNS method?  </s>
<s> Next, I have the following issue.  </s>
<s> What is the namespace name of the attribute which has been created auto by DOM in cases where the prefix of the attribute's qualified name is "xml:" ?  </s>
<s> Here is the example of DTD definition: Will the attribute node gets created by DOM covertly as having Namespaces REC states that xml: is bound to http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace.  </s>
<s> Therefore naive users will assume that DOM is aware of it and creates the node properly.  </s>
<s> In general, I know L2 makes namespace prefix and name independent by design.  </s>
<s> However, the case shown above seems to me the one for which short description should be added.  </s>

<s> Does this rule also apply to the new createElementNS method?  </s>
<s> Default attribute values, if defined by the DTD or schema, should automatically be available on the Element, whether it's a Namespaced or non-Namespaced Element.  </s>
<s> L2 still does not provide any mechanism for setting up the definitions of default attribute values, so this is handled "by magic" -- that is, it's implementation-dependent.  </s>
<s> The namespace name for these attributes is problematic.  </s>
<s> DTDs do not handle namespaces at all well (or, more accurately, namespaces are not very compatable with DTDs), and DTDs can only directly specify the prefix.  </s>
<s> The prefix-to-URI binding is presumed to be resolved at the time that the attribute node is created and assigned.  </s>
<s> The URIs for the xml: and xmlns: prefixes will be hardcoded to always be "the right thing", as defined in the Namespace spec.  </s>
<s> Attempts to override these will not be accepted.  </s>
<s> Better support of DTDs, and some form of Namespace lookup/checking, is currently expected in DOM Level 3. Joe Kesselman / IBM Research  </s>
