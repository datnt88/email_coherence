<s> Ian Jacobs, 06 Oct 2002 The provisions of this checkpoint are not verifiable.  </s>
<s> Instead, these design goals are XAG design goals and should be manifest in that specification (though in more concrete terms).  </s>
<s> Perhaps this is the checkpoint that should read "Use formats that conform to XAG." The requirements of Checkpoint 5.3 require device-independence, inclusion of accessibility features, require publicly documented interfaces for accessibility, and require the use of the operating system for certain applications.  </s>
<s> I'm not an expert on XAG, but my concern is that XAG is only a supporting specification of the WCAG that deals with XML and some of the other standards.  </s>
<s> Standard markups and CSS do not fall within the XAG area of responsibility.  </s>
<s> If a developer is not using XML they would have no reason to look for information inside XAG for specifications or requirements.  </s>
<s> Requiring a developer that is only working with HTML and CSS to meet the requirements of XAG will only chase people away because they would consider the information "not relevant" to their particular needs.  </s>
<s> Sun (via Earl Johnson), 27 Oct 2002 How about, "Choose technologies that programmatically support, expose, and make possible building content that meets the WCAG." Although, it is hard to tell exactly what this checkpoint applies to.  </s>
<s> Perhaps it would be better to put the jist of this feedback (structure and content must be programmatically available to an AT) into Guideline 5's wording or into 5.1 or 5.4 IBM (via Andi Snow-Weaver), 29 Oct 2002 This is an important consideration but should not be a checkpoint.  </s>
<s> If you meet all the checkpoints, then you have obviously done this.  </s>
<s> If you haven't, then what difference does this make?  </s>
<s> SAP (via Audrey Weinland), 31 Oct 2002 *The baseline AT needs to be defined.  </s>
<s> Otherwise it's too difficult to figure out which AT to support.  </s>
<s> *minimum level #1 subpoint #3: Not sure what this means.  </s>
<s> What are publicly documented interfaces?  </s>
<s> *minimum level #1 subpoint #5: Not sure what this means.  </s>
<s> Please clarify.  </s>
<s> Sun's recommendation provides some insight into issues that would otherwise be left open.  </s>
<s> I recommend we use their wording, "Choose technologies that programmatically support, expose, and make possible building content that meets the WCAG."  </s>
<s> This would then require the following elements be clearly expressed: 1. device-independence (Checkpoint 2.1 defines character input, but does not specifically require non-character input as in other methods of navigation used by disabled persons - designers typically do not consider mouse inputs as character inputs because they are not associated with keyboards and speech navigation is clearly not understood as a character input), 2. include accessibility features (this would require that applets, PDF's, Flash, and any other technology that comes along to meet the requirements of this checkpoint), 3. have publicly documented interfaces for interoperability (this would require action on two parts - first the developer of the technology to provide documentation on how to develop with accessibility in mind, and then the part of the designer using the technology with the accessibility features in mind) 4. make use of operating system accessibility features (either directly or via the user agent) supported by assistive technologies in the natural language(s) of the content (this would require that the designer ensure the technology being used is supported in the natural language of the content, thereby ensuring that the disabled population related to that natural language can utilize the content), 5. are implemented in user agents and/or proxies in the natural language(s) of the content ***** this point can be deleted because it is clearly required by subpoint 4.

<s> I understand the first part about not using Mouseover etc. and agree.  </s>

<s> (e.g. must be operable from keyboard).  </s>
<s> I don't understand your second part about not wanting things to be keyboard only.  </s>
<s> The proposal just says it must be keyboard operable.  </s>
<s> Not that you can't have it do other things as well.  </s>
<s> I presume you don't want to lose keyboard operability in favor of other things (i.e. mouse only or pointer only").  </s>

<s> NOTE: Other interface methods such as pointing can and should be supported in parallel with keyboard operability as appropriate, but keyboard operation is always required for functionality whose name or result can be concisely expressed in words."  </s>
