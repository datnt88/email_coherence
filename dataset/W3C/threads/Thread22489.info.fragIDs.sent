<s> Are there plans for a standard query/filter language based on the DOM?  </s>
<s> Has anyone implemented one?  </s>

<s> Presumably one could (and would) implement an XSL processor on top of the DOM.  </s>
<s> Is that what you're looking for?  </s>
<s> Joe Kesselman / IBM Research Unless stated otherwise, all opinions are solely those of the author.  </s>
<s> Perhaps it might be worth adding getElementsByPattern(String pattern) to Element and Document interfaces.  </s>
<s> Pattern expression could either be XSL pattern or prefixed with pattern language type like URL protocol type.  </s>

<s> On the DOM Activity page, at http://www.w3.org/DOM/Activity, you will find the statement "Level two will include a style sheet object model, and define functionality for manipulating the style information attached to a document.  </s>
<s> It will also allow rich queries of the document and define some event model.  </s>
<s> " So yes, we are planning on adding this to the DOM in the future.  </s>

<s> XPointer is AFAIK the closest you can get at the moment, and there are several DOM-based implementations.  </s>
<s> See One thing that would be nice to have would be a query/filter language based on CSS2 syntax.  </s>
<s> That would be more or less ideal since it would give us the things that are likely to be the most used, with a nice concise syntax and special features for HTML.  </s>
