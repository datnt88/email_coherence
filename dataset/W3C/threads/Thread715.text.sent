Hello TidyFolks, The following HTML code: ...validates as strict HTML 4.01, according to the W3C validator. 
However, Tidy 4-Aug-00 complains: line 17 column 1 - Warning: html doctype doesn't match content t.html: Doctype given is "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN" t.html: Document content looks like HTML 3.2 ...and will tidy the resulting output by replacing the doctype with one for HTML 3.2. 
In order to convince Tidy that this is valid HTML 4.01 Strict, one must place "Some text" in a paragraph element: This apparently is required by code in the "ParseBlock" routine of "parser.c", 
specifically lines 661-666: HTML4 strict doesn't allow mixed content for elements with %block; as their content model lexer- versions &amp;= ~VERS_HTML40_STRICT; continue; Is Tidy wrong here, or is the W3C validator? 
It appears to me that Tidy is in error, as the TD element is not %block but rather %flow: where %flow is: So the inline content should be acceptable in HTML 4.01 strict. 
-- Dave Hi Dave, I think that what Tidy is reporting is not that it is invalid, but just that you only need an HTML 3.2 interpreter to be able to correctly decode this file. 
I think that each new version of HTML is basically a super-set of previous versions, and your simple table doesn't require the latest "hot off the press" version of HTML for it to be to be decodable. 
As such, a 3.2 Doctype would be correct. 
I think all old browsers will still attempt to display a file, whatever its Doctype, but it wouldn't be unreasonable for them to give up on the grounds that it is a type of document it doesn't understand. 
Therefore, the correct Doctype declaration to use is the minimum that is actually required.

First, I'm afraid that I've muddied the waters a bit here. 
The warning I cited ("html doctype doesn't match content") and the replacement by the HTML 3.2 doctype doesn't occur in the distributed Tidy 4-Aug-00 version. 
It occurs in a version that I patched to fix a bug with doctype reporting (see an associated message of mine for details). 
I apologize for not testing my assertion with the released version. 
Here's a better example that does work improperly with the released version: This is valid HTML 4.01 Strict, as confirmed by the W3C validator. 
However, Tidy 4-Aug-00 reports: t.html: Doctype given is "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN" t.html: Document content looks like HTML 4.01 Transitional If, however, I replace the table data cell line with: ...then I get: t.html: Doctype given is "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN" t.html: Document content looks like HTML 4.01 This illustrates that Tidy thinks that TD elements cannot contain inline content in HTML 4.01 Strict, but as far as I can tell, the standard says it can. 
So I believe that Tidy has a bug here, unless I've misinterpreted the DTD. 
I believe that is contraindicated by this statement in the "Status of this Document" section of the HTML 4.01 Specification: "W3C recommends that authors produce HTML 4 documents instead of HTML 3.2 documents." 
(Producing an "HTML 4 document" requires using an HTML 4 doctype.) -- Dave Hmmm, the way I would read that recommendation is that the W3C is trying to encourage HTML 4 standards. 
For example, the use of Style Sheets rather than the use of embedded FONT xxxx commands. 
I am open to persuasion, but none-the-less feel sure that a filetype should always be specified as the minimum version necessary for a reader to be able to decode it - else why bother with the declaration at all?

But note that it states that HTML 4 documents should be created _instead_ of HTML 3.2 documents. 
A document containing, e.g., just simple paragraph elements will validate as either an HTML 2.0, HTML 3.2, or HTML 4.01 document. 
The difference is only in the doctype chosen. 
However, to comply with the recommendation, one must use an HTML 4.01 doctype, because only then is the document an "HTML 4 document." 
The sentence after the one I quoted from the HTML 4.01 Specification is: "For reasons of backward compatibility, W3C also recommends that tools interpreting HTML 4 continue to support HTML 3.2 and HTML 2.0 as well." 
By stating that support of earlier HTML standards should be maintained for "backward compatibility," I would think that implies that these earlier standards are not recommended for new authoring work, i.e., that all new documents should carry one of the HTML 4.01 doctypes. 
That would appear to argue that one should never use the HTML 4.01 Strict doctype, because any strict document will also validate at the "lesser" HTML 4.01 Transitional level. 
Wouldn't the HTML 4 Strict doctype be pointless then? 
Also, that would require that if I create a simple Web page with some paragraph elements, I should use an HTML 2.0 doctype. 
If I then edit a paragraph in that page to include an abbreviation marked by ABBR tags, then I would change the doctype to HTML 4.01. 
And if I delete the paragraph containing the ABBR element and replace it with a table, I must then reset the doctype to HTML 3.2. 
That doesn't seem practicable for a Web site of any size or even for a single page that's updated frequently. 
The "Techniques for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines" at: has, as "Checkpoint 11.1:" "Use W3C technologies when they are available and appropriate for a task and use the latest versions when supported. 
[Priority 2]" Regardless of whether I have a page of simple markup or one that uses the latest 4.01 features, I would argue that "use the latest versions" implies that I should be using HTML 4.01 doctypes exclusively for all new authoring. 
Of course, as one of the editors of the HTML 4.01 Specification, Dave Raggett would be in a perfect position to tell us the intent of the standard. 
Dave, is it a replacement for previous HTML versions, or is it co-standard to be used only when HTML 4-only features are needed? 
(Actually, I am sympathetic to Barney's position that the doctype should reflect the level of the content. 
I just don't believe that the W3C recommendation intends this. 
:-) -- Dave
