Re: http://www.passcenter.com 
typo sorry and tx apparently one can download the toolkit: probably as I said i'd like a non-applet version. 
Iain Cormack of passcenter wrote me: Thank you for your query to Passcenter support. 
If you visit our parent company web site www.idarts.com 
there is a downloadable Passfaces toolkit. 
This is configurable to use with the internet and Web based applications. 
Hopefully the toolkit will meet your requirements, if you have any further questions then please feel free to contact me.

I tried to sign on to the passcenter service, but after completing the registration form, I was taken to a blank page. 
I never got to choose any faces. 
I'm waiting for a response from support. 
I did see the demo faces, and they were all smiling. 
I thought it would be much better if people had different expressions on their faces, making it easier to remember them, than a sea of people with the same cheesy smile.

I'm waiting for a response from support--David I also signed up and when I went back to use the product, they returned that my user name was not registered. 
So I went through the registration process again, picked the same user name and received a messaged stating the user name was already taken. 
So I wrote to support and still haven't received an answer as to why my user name was but wasn't registered. 
I did get to see the faces, but thought, like David, that all the smiles didn't help in the recognition process.

they have some serious usability issues to deal with, especially if they are wanting illiterate or disabled clients. 
I still have received no reply to my query, which was very polite and clear about exactly what the problem was.
