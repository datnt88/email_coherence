Looking at http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/TR/WD-rdf-testcases-20030117/ dated 5 September 2003. 
some editorial comments I only just noticed: "come out false" --?-- "be false in any interpretation" or maybe "always be false" RDF-Entailment -- RDF-entailment section 2 datatype-aware entailment tests, why is 'supported' inside quotes in last bullet but not elsewhere? 
Also second bullet ends "finally," but there are two more. 
My action item 20030919#14 PatH To consider amendments to test cases concerning nonentailments was to suggest a form of words for describing what it means to pass a negative entailment test, right? 
Suggestion: "The test is considered to be passed if the entailment is em not /em drawn using the rules of RDF-entailment or RDFS-entailment, as above." 
-- "The test is em failed /em if the conclusion can be drawn from the premises using the rules of RDF- or RDFS-entailment. 
The test is considered to be em passed /em when a thorough attempt to fail the test is unable to achieve failure." 
This sounds vague, but then success at a non-entailment test *is* vague, so the wording is designed to suggest to a thoughtful reader that the notion needs some care.

Pat: I'm afraid that I can't make code for that last part... Adjectives like "thorough" and "vague" are soft for humans but hard for soft(ware)... 
I actually have no other wording and so I pass ;-) Jos De Roo, AGFA http://www.agfa.com/w3c/jdroo/ 
Interpret it as: when you run your code to exhaustion (it stops, or runs out of memory or time according to your view of what its resource limitations are) it fails to fail. 
The vagueness arises from the fact that if you had bought more RAM, maybe, or let it run for TWO weeks, maybe it might have failed.

Alternative, maybe too long-winded (?) "The test is em failed /em if the conclusion can be drawn from the premises using the rules of RDF- or RDFS-entailment. 
The test is considered to be em passed /em when it can be conclusively demonstrated that the conclusion cannot be so drawn. 
In practice, the test may be considered to be passed when a thorough attempt to fail the test is unable to achieve failure."
