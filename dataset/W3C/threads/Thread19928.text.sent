Hi, Does amaya's printing/postscript generating engine support "page-break-before" yet? 
(is it planned?) (I'm somewhat inexperienced/ ignorant about web concepts so sorry if this easy...) I did try several thinks (included below) and searched the w3 web site and mail archives. 
I did not see anything specifically say amaya supports this. 
I did see a couple of "this is how you do it, but I don't know if any browsers support it..." I'm running on Redhat 6.1 Linux. 
(I did check that netscape 4.7 does not support it.) (Maybe someone knowns of an "html2ps" that supports controlling page-breaks) Thanks for any suggestions, Ron Things I've tried with amaya: In the html (various combinations of inclusion of): STYLE type="text/css" media="print" H2 { page-break-before: always } And in the stylesheet H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, H6 { page-break-before: auto; /* the default */ page-break-inside: avoid; /* no page breaks inside... */ page-break-after: avoid; /* ... or after */ H1, H2 { page-break-before: always; /* begin new chapters; overrides previous rule */ BR.page { page-break-before: always } @media print { H1, H2 { page-break-before: always } BR.page { page-break-before: always } Could someone please help? 
Thanks, Ron IE 4+ does. 
Note that html2ps is the name of a specific program which may well also support it, or permit easy addition of the feature. 
Hi, Amaya doesn't implement "page-break-before" yet. 
The thotlib is able to do that, but we didn't find the time to add the needed glue between the CSS parser to thotlib.
