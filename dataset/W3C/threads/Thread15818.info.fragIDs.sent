This issue points out one of my main bones of contention with the WAI and the blind community.? It seems that many accessibility experts and blind users view the Web as a visual medium, and so they seek to describe Web pages visually in the name of accessibility.? I view the Web as an information medium, neither visual nor non-visual since the presentation is determined chiefly by the user and her browsing environment, with suggestions from the author. 
As an author, my goal is to provide Web pages so that each user feels that the page is designed specifically for her, regardless of her abilities and browsing environment at the time.? If you were designing a page specifically for an aural browser, you wouldn't include an image.? For this reason, I wouldn't want an aural user to hear ALT text like "[Snowflake]" or "XYZ Company Logo". 
When we try to tell the aural user that "There's an image here", we're saying that "This Web page is visual--it isn't made for you or your browsing environment."? 
I want to convince the aural user, and every other user, that the page is designed specifically for her.? This is true accessibility and it's seamless. 
The question of whether the graphic is gratuitous has been decided by the author, not the user. 
And then there are the blind web designers out here who LIKE knowing graphics are on a site and how they were used. 
I'm frequently altering my position too, 
as I basically agree with Liam, but this particular issue is "iffy," in my opinion, subject to the author's discretion. 
I maintain it's better to have too 
much information than not enough, particularly as web pages are often used as 
learning tools for others.

RD:: "I maintain it's better to have too much information than not enough..." 
WL:: The discussion usually involves those who take that position and those who get sick of hearing a TITLE="thin blue line separating section A from section B" sort of droning away with no easy way to turn it off and Bobby demanding it! 
There may be a correlation between caring whether one's shirt color clashes with the rest of the ensemble and wanting to know what those "gratuitous graphics" contain. 
Some of us rue that "clothes make the man" is taken seriously, even literally, while others may think it shouldn't matter, but does. 
One suggestion that there be a "for decorative purposes only" label for certain IMG thingies but the consensus has been that very few authors 
regard *their* background images as non-informative. 
If the only way to get ALT= in places where it is required for accessibility is to put it *everywhere* that it's possible, then perhaps we'll have to live with excess verbosity. 
The notion that "In the beggining was The Word" is enhanced by being set to music or having a special font or whatever seems absurd to me but I am in a very small minority who thinks that "virtual reality" is an oxymoron and that one's own imagination provides whatever "enhancement" is suitable for emphasizing such as "we hold these truths to be..." and that a great deal of what passes for visual/auditory improvements on verbal content is author vanity. 
Love. 
ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE 
That's what the TITLE attribute is for, to give a title to the image (usually in the form of a short description). 
The ALT attribute still gives alternate content, and purely decorative images don't need any replacement.

for an aural text, black on black is nice. 
DL: Hello, I'm new here. 
My name is Davey Leslie, I'm in Japan. 
Anyway... 
DL: Ah, hmm, well... 
I'm trying to figure this out, because it's clearly important, but I go round and round on this issue. 
When sighted people view a graphic layout, there are subtle visual cues that let us know "oh, this is important; this is not." 
Our eyes do not move in a linear fashion, but instead, scan the page and pick out the useful bits quickly. 
As designers, we use this fact to our advantage-- perhaps it's even one of our main tools. 
But then we come to the aural user. 
If we include a paragraph of description for each and every graphic, aren't we warping the relationships between the different bits of information, and, in effect, challenging the aural user to wade through the swamp of information and pick out the useful bits? 
Isn't there a point of information overload? 
Isn't a "clean" text-only page better? 
Is a wall of information really better? 
I really don't know.

LQ:: I wouldn't do anything merely to satisfy Bobby, but TITLE="End of Section A", TITLE="Start of Section B" or TITLE="New Section" would be more appropriate and less verbose for an HR element. 
For an IMG element, the TITLE should be context-free; TITLE="Thin blue line" would probably be best. 
The ALT attribute on IMG would provide a suitable replacement in the spirit of HR's TITLE attribute. 
I think TITLEs on HR elements are rather silly though. 
The level of the next heading should indicate whether one has reached a new section or not. 
When writing new pages, I find myself not using HR. Sometimes I use a style sheet with a 'border-top' instead of an HR, but usually I find that the document is more attractive visually without any dividing lines. 
It's structurally sound either way. 
WL:: 
LQ:: I use ALT="" as a "for decorative purposes only" label. 
LQ:: Then I think we'd be sacrificing the high level of usability provided by seamless accessibility.

I think blind readers have strong opinions about people who 'hide' keywords on their site by setting the text colour to the background colour so they can have multiple "recreation, holiday, recreational holidays..." on their page. 
Which is a frequent use of black on black or white on white.

well, perhaps we should consess a bit with the use of shading then. 
make it just a little less dark than the background or perhaps a bit more dark than a light background. 
the problem I have is with printing the things.

The world is not black and white. 
there are shades of everycolor. 
In discussions of Braille use it is generally recognized that only a relatively small percentage of blind people are Braille users. 
When talking about degree of visual perception we can talk about the small number of those who are totally blind vs those with usable light perception and degrees of Low Vision. 
But when we talk about access to the Internet you've gotta hear it or see it, but you don't get to do both. 
I want to do both. 
I hate being forced to go to a text only version of a web site just so I can avoid Java buttons and be able to navigate. 
I hate being shut away from 
the visual appearance of the page even though what I am seeing isn't the 
whole picture in all its detail and glorious color. 
I resent being shoved off to the text only interpretation where it is then determined that since I'm using text only I certainly have no interest in the graphics and therefore I am told by an alt tag that an image is "A PICTURE," "logo," "image," or some other totally non-informative description. 
I want to have 
the option to decide what is worth working to see. 
If I choose to look at something, since I was forced away from seeing it inthe first place by having to move to the text page just to navigate, I at least want to be able to right click on the image and display it if i choose to press nose to screen with a magnifying glass or use a screen enlarger to zoom in and look at the picture. 
If I don't know what's there to look at, how can I decide whether or not it's worth my effort? 
I really don't choose to be totally blind just because I am legally blind. 
I want access to all I can see as well as all I cannot see.

LQ:: You shouldn't have to. 
With seamless accessibility, all you do is disable Java and you're left with a usable alternative (as the content of the APPLET element). 
KSW:: 
LQ:: With seamless accessibility, the ALT attribute provides a replacement for the image, not a description of it. 
The TITLE attribute gives a title for the image, typically in the form of a short description. 
KSW:: 
LQ:: The TITLE attribute tells you what's there to look at. 
The ALT attribute replaces what's there to look at. 
Seamless accessibility does not deny you any access. 
If you want to know about the images, you can know about them through their TITLE and LONGDESC attributes. 
If you don't load images and don't care about them, you never have to know that they're there. 
Either way, the page appears optimized for your browsing environment.

Help! I am new to the project and having differculty getting started. 
Where do I start? 
Would appreciate any help from others.
