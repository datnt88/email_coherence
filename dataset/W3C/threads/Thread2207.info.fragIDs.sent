Re. ftp://ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-daviel-web-copy-control-00.txt 
This describes a simple HTTP header syntax (or HTML META tag) to define the copyright status of a document in a machine-readable way, and provide a link to a reference document which would define the status explicitly. 
The purpose of this proposed header is twofold. 
1. 
To make it easier to design agents that may create compilations of existing work automatically, or to search for only copyright-free material. 
2. To make it clear to consumers (via a popup, for instance) that certain material is copyright when they perform actions such as printing or saving a page. 
There is not intention to provide a mechanism for document signatures, modification control, etc. 
This work was in part prompted by a pamphlet on copyright issues for schools which included a note "Don't print anything from the Internet". 
Briefly, one includes a header or META tag such as Copy-Control: v 1.0 p 1 s 1 q 2 u http://some.org/copy.html 
or where the values for p(rint), s(ave), q(uote) are given 0 = forbidden, 1 = conditional, 2 = allowed. 
"quote" means to copy a portion of a document, is meant to reflect 
the common usage in printed material (for purposes of review, etc.), and might be checked by a clipboard function. 
The URL (required for level = 1 "conditional") fully defines the conditions, copyright holder, etc. (in human-readable form). 
This does not address saving of documents by search engines (addressed by the "ROBOTS" META tag and /robots.txt 
file), or saving of documents in cache (addressed by the "Expires" header and HTTP 1.1 extensions). 
It does not enforce copyright control, since it is easily circumvented. 
It merely provides notification. 
The syntax is a compromise between a rigorous definition useful for agents, and a form that is simple enough to write by hand. 
Possible revision (thought of since the original submission): define a numeric limit below which permission need not be sought, viz. 
Copy-Control: v 1.0 p(25) 2 s(1) 2 q 2 which states that 25 copies of a document may be printed without permission. 
This feature would be used by search agents, for example a teacher looking for an article about Mars rovers which could be printed out for a class. 
Why can't the existing &amp;copy; tag be used ? 
Obviously, this header doesn't replace that, since the header or META tag is invisible to the user. 
Firstly, the usual copyright notices are small and at the end of a document (whereas the notices on videotape are usually large and at the beginning ..), and secondly, since there is no defined format it is difficult for agents to interpret the tag (which might be in the body of text and referring to some other document, for instance).

This is an interesting approach. 
I've been thinking about IPR protection for a couple of years now. 
Previously it was with respect to SMPTE headers, which caused big problems because of the question of what fields and information to include (proposals for specifying usage rights can become quite unwieldy). 
This was a problem, because we did not have convenient ability to point elsewhere (as we do on the Web), hence what we packed into the header could become quite a religious issue. 
However, on the Web we are a bit more fortunate, _and_ the PICS standard that you can find off of (http://www.w3.org) seems to be the perfect method for specifying the type of information you propose. 
PICS has this goal directly in mind. 
This type of functionality is already included with respect to "appropriateness" in IE. 
To map something similar to PICS, consider the case in which Mark Twain wrote the material at http://www.twain.com/story.html . 
He also has a page describing the copyright statement in fuller detail at specify with respect to "Print", "Save", and "Quote", where the specified values represent 0 - disallowed, 1 - conditionally allowed, 2 - unconditionally allowed: (PICS-1.1 "http://www.wipo.org/v1.5" by "Mark Twain" labels on "1994.11.05T08:15-0500" for "http://www.twain.com/story.html" 
full "http://www.twain.com/IP-notice.html" 
ratings (print 1 save 1 quote 2)) Some of the benefits of using PICS: 1. 
Multiple distribution methods (embedded within the document, transported by the server, or from a label bureaus). 
This improves the management of the copyright information. 
(i.e. Organizations can control the use and access to their IPR from their server. 
Organizations can create "audit" spiders.) 
2. Generic labeling (implicitly rates every URL for which the specified URL is the prefix of) This improves the management of the copyright information, since I don't have to label every document in a directory if they have a similar status. 
3. Capabilities for digital signatures are provided. 
4. It is being widely leverage in Web development.

The same thing as with robots exclusion protocol. 
Regular expressions are needed, URL prefixes are not enough.
