<s> I've been getting lots of bug reports due to corrupted or out dated caches.  </s>
<s> I would like to propose an extension to the If-modified-since header to improve the situation.  </s>
<s> I'd like to start sending If-modified-since: DATE; size=SIZE The addition of size=SIZE informs the server of the current size of the document cached by the client.  </s>
<s> The size acts as a checksum, if the size of the file to be served is different than the size given in the If-modified-since header than a 304 should not be returned.  </s>
<s> The advantage of size over other checksums is that it is highly efficient.  </s>
<s> Clients and servers can obtain the information at little or no cost.  </s>
<s> The disadvantage of size is that it is not completely accurate as a checksum.  </s>
<s> An MD5 hash or some other content based checksum would be far more accurate but would require lots of additional overhead.  </s>
<s> In the future, if a stronger checksum is deemed necessary it can be added as another part of the If-modified-since header.  </s>
<s> Perhaps: If-modified-since: DATE; size=SIZE; md5=SIGNATURE I have tested this change against the Netscape, NCSA, CERN and Apache servers and all of them ignore the addition of size=SIZE, so we can add this addition without fear of backwards compatibility concerns.  </s>

<s> In addition to supporting size=SIZE I encourage other server authors to do an _equals_ comparison rather than a greater than or equal comparison of the two dates.  </s>
<s> Isn't this what the standard says anyway?  </s>
<s> Will the "size" be determined from the Content-length header or the size on the cache's disk?  </s>
<s> If the former, documents with incorrect content-length headers are essentially uncacheable, as are results from CGI scripts which generally don't have content-length headers.  </s>
<s> If the latter, could there be encoding problems?  </s>
<s> The size is determined by taking the current length of the document in the cache.  </s>
<s> The content-length of the transfer is discarded, so encodings should have no effect.  </s>
<s> I assume you anticipate this being implemented by having software simply ask the underlying file system for a byte count of the file?  </s>
<s> This will break between any two machines with different end of line sequences.  </s>
<s> As an example, many servers read text files in their native format, converting EOL sequences as they are sent to the client (proxy).  </s>
<s> This means that the data stream as transmitted to the client (and cached) is a different size from the actual size of the data stored on the disk at the server.  </s>
<s> I think this problem alone is enough to make this scheme unworkable.  </s>
<s> This will also break any checksum scheme as well.  </s>
<s> Macs, Windows, VMS, and Unix servers all have different EOL sequences and the you can bet that the data stream sent by a server is substantially different from the image of the file that resides on the server's disk.  </s>
<s> As I said earlier, the correct solution is to fix the problem with corrupted caches.  </s>
<s> The modification date is a sufficient mechanism for determining whether or not a document has changed, assuming both ends are able to maintain data integrity.  </s>
<s> If the proxy server needs to maintain a table of checksums for the files it caches in order to ensure data integrity, that's fine.  </s>
<s> But it needn't involve the server of the original document in determining whether or not its own cache has been corrupted.  </s>
<s> Simple comparison of the local checksum to the local data store is sufficient to indicate corruption.  </s>

<s> In addition to supporting size=SIZE I encourage other server authors to do an _equals_ comparison rather than a greater than or equal comparison of the two dates.  </s>
<s> If it wouldn't be so, an incorrect future date would make a document unavailable with a backwards corrected date.  </s>
<s> Will the "size" be determined from the Content-length header or the size on the cache's disk?  </s>
<s> If the former, documents with incorrect content-length headers are essentially uncacheable, as are results from CGI scripts which generally don't have content-length headers.  </s>
<s> If the latter, could there be encoding problems?  </s>
<s> The size is determined by taking the current length of the document in the cache.  </s>
<s> The content-length of the transfer is discarded, so encodings should have no effect.  </s>
<s> Is the content-length discarded by the proxy in every case ?  </s>
<s> Even without transfer-encoding header ?  </s>
<s> Why not keeping the Content-length and transfer encoding headers in the cache file, and compare them against the new headers sent by the server owning the document ?  </s>
<s> It is most likely that the transfer encoding, and the transfer length will not change if the document itself hasn't changed.  </s>
<s> If the transfer encoding scheme is the same, but not the content length, it can be assumed that there's a new version of the document.  </s>
<s> If the encoding scheme changed, we still have the Date header to check.  </s>
