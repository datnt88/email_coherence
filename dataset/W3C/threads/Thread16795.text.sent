And the registration form has inaccessible images (ie.

OK, that's just pathetic.:-) 
Then again, it's probably designed for sighted pwoplw who otherwise don't have a clue about accessibility (EG, FedGov webmasters). 
Y'know what was disturbing, though? 
Whilst fiddling with a demo copy of JAWS, I headed over to the Army Digital Training and Doctrine Library (ADTDL) at www.adtdl.army.mil. 
It's designed for current soldiers. 
Training and such....In other words, not for the general public, and definitely not the blind. 
It was close to the most accessible sight I've seen yet. 
That scares me. 
For the record, Army National Guard recruiting has THE most accessible site among the military/DOD that I've found yet; They speak some pages by default; Others, nothing. 
Which brings up the question: WHY? 
These sites are not designed in any way to have use to those besides those already either in service or qualified for it. 
Kinda curious, considering HHS (lead agency for the disabled) had largely inaccessible sites from what I saw.
