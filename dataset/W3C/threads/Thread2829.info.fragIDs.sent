In section 11 "Access Authentication", the statement "HTTP provides several OPTIONAL challenge-response authentication mechanisms which MAY be used by a server to challenge a client request and by a client to provide authentication information." is not a requirement, so the "MAY" should be changed to "may".

I'll change the "MAY" to "can".

"MAY" is not used to designate requirements, but goes along with OPTIONAL; if something is OPTIONAL, then you MAY do it. 
It's not necessary to say both OPTIONAL and MAY, but there's nothing wrong with the text as it was. 
But you MAY change it if you actually think it's better.
