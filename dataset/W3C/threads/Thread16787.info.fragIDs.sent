<s> of course Mozilla is open source so like most all open source projects it gets only as much attention as the volunteers put into it, if there are folks on the dev group that are concerned about access then there is likely to be good access, and if there isn't well it is unlikely to be there.  </s>

<s> I understand your points.  </s>

<s> Again, I want to emphasize that although it has always been possible to configure as you suggest and it is a good approach, it does not come down to the level that many consumers are dealing with.  </s>

<s> I would have no difficulty understanding the problem IF the dialog you speak of was a) impossible to get around, and b) always necessary.  </s>
<s> The profile dialogue of Mozilla is needed only in the event of a multi-user system, and in such a case can be configured to start with the profile matching the user currently logged in.  </s>
<s> Should the dialogue be useable with JAWS, it still requires the user to select a profile before proceeding.  </s>
<s> Specifying it directly seems a much more flexible and useable method; as well as leaving the profile handling to the system administrator instead of the user.  </s>
<s> Could you describe in more detail the problem you see here ?  </s>
