<s> I have now worked through the last call issue resolutions and the editors draft of concepts should be up-to-date.  </s>
<s> I need to review it, and I hope Graham will join me in so doing at this stage.  </s>

<s> Patrick:  </s>
<s> "The datatype abstraction used in RDF is compatible with XML Schema Part 2: Datatypes..."  </s>
<s> Pat on datatypes:  </s>
<s> That reads OK to me also as a first sentence, although you might want to qualify it pretty quickly since we explicitly rule out some of the XMLS datatypes as being incompatible.  </s>
<s> I now have " ... is compatible with the abstraction used in XML Schema ..." I also explicitly say at end "[RDF-SEMANTICS] contains a more detailed discussion of specific XML Schema built-in datatypes."  </s>
<s> If Pat could provide an anchor on the table of XSD datatypes then I would link directly to that.  </s>
<s> gk:  </s>
<s> I agree.  </s>
<s> But I think the following: A URI reference or literal used as a node identifies what that node represents.  </s>
<s> A URI reference used as a predicate identifies the relationship between the nodes it connects.  </s>
<s> A predicate URI reference may also be a node in the graph.  </s>
<s> should be revised to say something like "... identifies the relationship between the things represented by the  </s>
<s> nodes it connects" I did this and also changed from "the relationship" to "a relationship" jeremy concerning semantics:  </s>
<s> The new text is: "A datatype is identified by one or more URI references" which excludes a free floating datatype with no URI but makes no unique names assumption.  </s>
<s> I beleive this agrees with semantics.  </s>
<s> The new text reads: "A URI reference for identifying this datatype is ..." Brian reminds me:  </s>
<s> 2002-11-22#5 jjc check that RDF Concepts does not allow a synonym for rdf:XMLLiteral  </s>
<s> The text above is intended to allow a synonym, without actually saying so explicitly.  </s>
<s> If the WG believes this detail does need explicit text I have a weak preference for it to go in semantics.  </s>
<s> Jeremy  </s>
<s> Heads-up...  </s>
<s> I'm about 2/3 through my detailed review.  </s>
<s> Generally I think it's looking very good.  </s>
<s> I do have a number of comments, mostly minor and many purely minor editorial, which I plan to submit before the telecon.  </s>
<s> However, I suggest that we treat the 19 June 2003 editors' draft as the basis for any discussions today, rather than chasing a moving target.  </s>
