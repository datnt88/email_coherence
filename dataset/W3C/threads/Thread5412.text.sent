It read good. 
Hopefully, it should be sufficient. 
To borrow a phrase from Dorothy Parker; "This is not a patent to be tossed aside lightly. 
It should be thrown aside with great force."

That's good news. 
Hopefully, the courts will reverse their judgment and MS won't have to distribute a new browser after all. 
I wonder if this case could eventually be used for the patent office to consider doing away with software patents. 
Wishful thinking?

W3C Director Tim Berners-Lee has written an unprecedented request to US Under If Tim Berners-Lee needs additional assistance I can offer proof that the concept, understanding and working of the '906 patent was already publicaly discovered and discussed in Feb '93 as an additional potential use for the XMosaic browser to load QT. 
Only reason it did not make a splash then was modem speed limitations and because XMosaic was still under going beta development. 
Everything the '906 patent relies on to work was already discovered and understoodm, whether by actual applications or because it was totally obivious by virtue of current and past web developments that eoloas had nothing to do.
