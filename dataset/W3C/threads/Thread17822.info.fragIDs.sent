<s> The general topic of user interface accessibility for computer software  </s>
<s> exceeds the scope of this document.  </s>
<s> I question that disclaimer.  </s>
<s> Nowhere else to my knowledge is this topic covered, and I think that is our charter.  </s>
<s> Given it, though, I believe mention that the UA-TECHNIQUES document indicates current user interface accessibility suggestions is appropriate.  </s>

<s> I don't appreciate why the "number of the current" link is useful.  </s>

<s> Are they counted?  </s>
<s> First occurrence number used?  </s>

<s> a page or site may verify that the checkpoint has been satisfied.  </s>
<s> Should refer to user agent, not page or site.  </s>

<s> Suggest remove ";" from ends of each UL LI  </s>
<s> [Suggest if dependent UA, further qualify limits expected by that UA.  </s>

<s> [Do we expect that the dated version of the guidelines will drop the date in the event this document becomes a W3C Recommendation?]  </s>
<s> 4. User Agent Accessibility Guidelines  </s>
<s> Para 1  </s>
<s> Input devices include pointing devices, keyboards, braille devices, head  </s>
<s> wands, microphones, and others.  </s>
<s> Input devices [add: touch screens]  </s>
<s> Output devices may include monitors, speech synthesizers, braille devices, and  </s>
<s> printers.  </s>
<s> [add: force feedback graphics, refreshable "paper" (is that device or media?]  </s>
<s> Please note that "device-independent support" does not mean that user agents  </s>
<s> must support every input or output device.  </s>
<s> User agents should offer redundant  </s>
<s> input and output mechanisms for those devices that are supported.  </s>
<s> For example,  </s>
<s> if a user agent supports keyboard and mouse input, users should be able to interact with all features using either the keyboard or the mouse.  </s>
<s> [?  </s>
<s> I am uncertain that mouse needs to provide all keyboard capabilities?]  </s>
<s> 1.3 _active elements_ needs link to glossary  </s>
<s> [General questions: How handle the bootstrap process to get started: what can be assumed: operating system, file system, available device "plug &amp; play"?]  </s>
<s> 2.4 Allow the user to configure element sets for various navigation  </s>
<s> mechanisms. [Priority 2] For instance, allow the user to choose which element types to navigate sequentially (e.g., links alone, links and headers, headers and lists, etc.).  </s>
<s> Similarly, allow the user to choose element types for direct  </s>
<s> navigation and searching.  </s>
<s> [Choices should be dynamic, and readily changed to match the user's current desires.]  </s>
<s> 3.2 Describe product features known to promote accessibility in a section of  </s>
<s> the product documentation.  </s>
<s> [Priority 2] [How find these initially?]  </s>
<s> 4.8 Allow the user to turn on and off support for scripts and applets.  </s>
<s> [Priority 1] Note.  </s>
<s> This is particularly important for scripts that cause the screen to flicker, since people with photosensitive epilepsy can have seizures triggered by flickering or flashing in the 4 to 59 flashes per second (Hertz) range.  </s>
<s> [I believe european frequency is 50 Hz.  </s>
<s> I expect that 59 Hz value was picked to be just below the 60 Hz. US/Canadian AC power frequency.  </s>
<s> I note that the effective 30 Hz of US TV interlace seems to violate the above as well.  </s>
<s> This should have been caught in the Web Content Guidelines.]  </s>
<s> 4.10 Allow the user to turn on and off support for author style sheets.  </s>
<s> [Does this mean substitute for author style sheets, in part or completely, using the CSS cascading and IMPORTANT indications?  </s>
<s> Or was the intent: audible, rather than author?  </s>
<s> If author, should audible style sheets be a separate list item?]  </s>
<s> 4.13 ?automatic  </s>
<s> page forwarding?  </s>
<s> [I'm unfamiliar with this, is it a "feature" of existing browsers?]  </s>
<s> 5.8 Allow the user to control video frame rates.  </s>
<s> [That presumes adequate net support for bandwidth and non-interruption.]  </s>
<s> 5.11 Allow the user to control audio playback rate.  </s>
<s> [That presumes adequate net support for bandwidth and non-interruption.]  </s>
<s> [Suggest for parallelism with 5.8-5.9 that 5.13 come before 5.12.]  </s>
<s> 6.8 Allow the user to specify that captions for audio be rendered  </s>
<s> at the same time as the audio.  </s>
<s> [replaced "at the same time" by "synchronized with"] [Similarly for 6.11 and 6.12]  </s>
<s> Guideline 7... Note:  </s>
<s> [why is the style for the selection and the focus link different from  </s>
<s> that for active elements?]  </s>
<s> 7.2 Keep track of the user's point of regard ...  </s>
<s> [point of regard should be a link]  </s>
<s> 7.5 Allow the user to navigate directly to active elements in the document.  </s>
<s> [Priority 2] For instance, the user might navigate directly by selecting the number of a link or by entering the first letter of link text.  </s>
<s> [Why would these numbers on links (or of links) be known?  </s>
<s> In the case of repeated first letters of link text that are repeated, move to next so-starting, case independent.]  </s>
<s> 7.6 Allow the user to search for active elements.  </s>
<s> [Priority 2]  </s>
<s> [active elements should be link]  </s>
<s> 8.5, 8.6 make link of viewport 8.8 For dependent user agents.  </s>
<s> Allow the user to view a document outline  </s>
<s> constructed from its structural elements (e.g., from header and list elements).  </s>
<s> [Priority 2] [Not all list elements have any identification that would help to differentiate structure.]  </s>
<s> 8.9 ...[from] the document root.  </s>
<s> 8.16 Make available whether a chosen link has already been visited.  </s>
<s> [even if multiple instances of that link occur in the document.]  </s>
<s> 11.1 For desktop graphical browsers.  </s>
<s> Use and provide accessible interfaces to  </s>
<s> other technologies.  </s>
<s> [Priority 1] To promote interoperability, open standards should be used wherever possible.  </s>
<s> [open standards or W3C recommendations]  </s>
<s> Native support A user agent supports a feature natively if it does not require  </s>
<s> another piece of software (e.g., plug-in or external program) for support [Native support does not preclude more extensive support by AT, so the interface for that support may still be needed.]  </s>
<s> General: reference to [TECHNIQUES] should probably be to [UA-TECHNIQUES] as there are other techniques documents.  </s>
<s> End: Suggest that [checklist] should show both the table and list forms separately Regards/Harvey Bingham  </s>
<s> (Note: I've integrated Harvey's comments that are unanswered here into the document for the next revision.)  </s>
<s> They are actually in the TOC, but not in the UL of the TOC (because they are external documents and I wanted to distinguish them).  </s>
<s> Thus, after "6. References" of the UL , the following statement indicates they are appendixes:  </s>
<s> The appendix list of checkpoints is available as either a  </s>
<s> tabular summary of checkpoints or as a simple list of checkpoints.  </s>
<s> " There are more references to the fact that these are appendixes to this document in the Status sectino.  </s>
<s> 1.1 Principles of Accessible Design Ensure that the user interface is accessible.  </s>
<s> The general topic of user interface accessibility for computer software  </s>
<s> Charles is working on a W3C Note that will include references to vendor-specific guidelines for software accessibility.  </s>
<s> I would like to refer to that Note once it's available.  </s>
<s> Help Orient the User  </s>
<s> ...how many links the document contains or the number of the  </s>
<s> This is meant to refer to element instances (not link text or link destinations).  </s>
<s> Thus, every "A" element is numbered (uniquely).  </s>
<s> It's useful to know that I'm on the 75th link of the document if I have a navigation mechanism that lets me return to it (by number).  </s>
<s> I admit, this is very technique-y as it suggests numbering links as a way of letting readers know where they are.  </s>
<s> There are undoubtedly other techniques.  </s>
<s> For this reason, I question whether these checkpoints should be checkpoints at all (to be discussed at the 23 June teleconf).  </s>
<s> Refer to checkpoint 8.14  </s>
<s> This could appear in the techniques document, but in my opinion goes to far in suggesting an implementation.  </s>
<s> The purpose of the checkpoint is not to ensure fast downloads (though this is interesting) but to provide a measure of progress (whatever the speed).  </s>
<s> 3.1 Conformance Conformance claims  </s>
<s> I'm not sure what this means.  </s>
<s> Can you give an example?  </s>
<s> No. Conformance will refer to a specific, frozen version of the specification, not the latest version.  </s>
<s> 4. User Agent Accessibility Guidelines Please note that "device-independent support" does not mean that user agents  </s>
<s> That's an interesting point.  </s>
<s> For example, must I be able to type via the mouse (e.g., by using an entry palette)?  </s>
<s> For generality, we should not assume an operating system or file system (e.g., when using a kiosk).  </s>
<s> Where should we mention this?  </s>
<s> 3.2 Describe product features known to promote accessibility in a section of  </s>
<s> There is information about this in the Techniques Document (3.9.1 of 11 June version).  </s>
<s> 4.8 Allow the user to turn on and off support for scripts and applets.  </s>
<s> Jon has flagged this as an issue for discussion.  </s>
<s> 4.10 Allow the user to turn on and off support for author style sheets.  </s>
<s> I would suggest that "support for author style sheets" means that they are parsed and cascaded with other style sheets according to the style sheet spec.  </s>
<s> Turning off support would mean they are ignored.  </s>
<s> 4.13 ?automatic  </s>
<s> page forwarding?  </s>
<s> Some browsers support META element declarations such as this: After a 5-second delay, the new page is loaded.  </s>
<s> 5.8 Allow the user to control video frame rates.  </s>
<s> It sounds like there are two scenarios: streamed video and local playback.  </s>
<s> Does is matter which type the user is viewing?  </s>
<s> 5.11 Allow the user to control audio playback rate.  </s>
<s> 6.8 Allow the user to specify that captions for audio be rendered  </s>
<s> I think "at the same time" doesn't mean "synchronized with" in this case, but rather that both are rendered.  </s>
<s> In other words, when captions are available (and as captions they are already synchronized), all the user to view them while the video is running (as opposed to captions-only).  </s>
<s> The focus is a mechanism used to identify active elements.  </s>
<s> It may  </s>
<s> not be the only mechanism.  </s>
<s> 7.5 Allow the user to navigate directly to active elements in the document.  </s>
<s> See comment above about numbering "A" elements.  </s>
<s> 8.8 For dependent user agents.  </s>
<s> Allow the user to view a document outline  </s>
<s> Which list elements are those?  </s>
<s> I think the word "element" is supposed to suggest markup.  </s>
<s> 8.16 Make available whether a chosen link has already been visited.  </s>
<s> A "chosen link" means a particular A element, not the content of the element or the destination of the link.  </s>
<s> Thank you for the comments Harvey! - Ian Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org) http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs  </s>
<s> The appendix list of checkpoints is available as either a  </s>
<s> Interesting extension of the word "appendix".  </s>
<s> My book-centric use is appendix in the same document.  </s>
<s> Why bother to call these external documents "Appendices?"  </s>
<s> 3.1 Conformance Conformance claims  </s>
<s> Old screen readers went across table cells as they knew not of the possibility to fold cell content onto multiple lines.  </s>
<s> That DUA only serves a particular class of use, and presumes some information in its dependency with the general UA.  </s>
<s> How is that interface specified?  </s>
<s> 4. User Agent Accessibility Guidelines Please note that "device-independent support" does not mean that user agents  </s>
<s> So far as I am aware, that capability was omitted from XMetaL 1.0, possibly to be put back into XMetaL 2.0.  </s>
<s> It was available in HoTMetaL, I believe since version 3. It and the other accessibility features of that product never got any mention in any product reviews, so their inclusion in the first product of SoftQuad Software, Inc. was less important than getting to market with a product.  </s>
<s> Not sure.  </s>
<s> Without assumptions, what can we say about making that process accessible?  </s>
<s> 4.10 Allow the user to turn on and off support for author style sheets.  </s>
<s> 4.13 ?automatic  </s>
<s> page forwarding?  </s>
<s> That "automatic page forwarding" remains semantically confusing.  </s>
<s> Can we describe it differently, or expand the description.  </s>
<s> The "forwarding" part implied to me that I will somehow be doing the forwarding.  </s>
<s> "Refresh" is the concept that asserts server-side action.  </s>
<s> How about "automatic refresh to a different page content after a time delay"?  </s>
<s> Good point.  </s>
<s> The issue remains at what granularity is the synchronization, or "at the same time".  </s>
<s> I guess I read more into "at the same time" than just "concurrently".  </s>
<s> 8.8 For dependent user agents.  </s>
<s> Allow the user to view a document outline  </s>
<s> In the DOM sense, structure and sibling sequence preserves structure.  </s>
<s> Unordered list items may have no presentational differentiation.  </s>
<s> Nor may definition list terms.  </s>
<s> For these, the sequence of occurrence might be used associated with a count of position for that otherwise undifferentiated structure.  </s>
<s> 8.16 Make available whether a chosen link has already been visited.  </s>
<s> My proposal would mark all occurrences of a visited link, if any one were visited.  </s>
