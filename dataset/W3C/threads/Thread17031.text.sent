Hi, Has anyone played with stylesheets to render SVG data down to good ol' html image maps? 
Whilst looking at some XSLT that went the other way around [1], it occurred to me that this might be useful in situations where an SVG viewer wasn't available and/or there was an assistive technology that could make some sense of an image map but would baulk at SVG. Cheers, Danny.

That would seem problematic in the general case.

And the result tends to be wildly inaccessible, slow, heavy, and of poor quality.

That seems unlikely, and contrary to UAAG guidelines. 
A real, interoperable XML DOM is a far better bet for an assistive technology that either screenscraping or a problematic and browser-dependent, undefined, 'HTML DOM Level 0'. Chris mailto:chris@w3.org 
Hi Chris, CL That would seem problematic in the general case. 
Very true. 
CL Rendering of static images is fine, for such situations, but I would CL be reluctant to go too far down the imagemap /sliced table / ton of CL javascript route because it dumbs down what SVG is capable of and, if CL lots of effort is put into it, merely delays the general rollout of CL SVG.

Urrgh! 
I certainly didn't have a ton of Javascript in mind. 
Or a ton of effort. 
Image maps may be slow, heavy &amp; poor quality, but on a browser that doesn't support SVG they are at least visible. 
I personally would prefer the rollout of SVG to be as quick as possible, and something like this might even encourage SVG uptake as the source format would be SVG, though realistically I doubt whether it would make any difference one way or another.

I must re-read the guidelines. 
A real, interoperable XML DOM is a good aim (for the present) I agree, I just thought this might be a simple pragmatic approach to make some material more available. 
Forget I mentioned it ;-) Cheers, Danny. 
Hi Danny, I assume that your question is specific to [1], where your SVG file would only consist of a set of transparent paths with links, in front of a background image (no filters, animation and other fancy stuff). 
Even this would be hard to do in (pure) XSLT, since it takes rather complex calculations to compute an approximation of closed paths using the rectangles. 
Or maybe you would simplify the approximation down to compute the bounding box of the SVG path. 
Even that wouldn't be trivial, since XSLT 1.0 is not so good at parsing strings or computing min/max over sets of values. 
Max. 
Thanks Max. 
I think the idea has now been soundly placed in the bin marked 'not worth the effort'. 
Cheers, Danny.
