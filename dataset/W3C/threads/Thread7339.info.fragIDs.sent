<s> WEBDAVers, Couldn't make the mtg in Irvine, but I have a question about draft-0.6.  </s>
<s> Is there a rationale for defining complementary MIME types for requests and responses to a method besides the ability to unambiguously determine the nature of the message out of context?  </s>
<s> Are you that much more likely to retain the C-T header than the HTTP request/response line?  </s>
<s> If a lock request is in the form of: LOCK foo HTTP/1.x  </s>
<s> Content-Type: application/lock [lock request entity] and the response is in the form of: HTTP/1.x 20x OK Content-Type: application/lockresult [lock response body] The main reason that I can see for creating MIME types for request and reponse is that you are missing the HTTP request or status lines but manage to keep the Content-Type header value around.  </s>
<s> Contrast this to the message/http content type that doesn't need to a separate IMT for the request and reponse as its form is unambiguous.  </s>
<s> -marc  </s>
<s> Excellent question.  </s>
<s> There are several choices for where method parameters can be placed.  </s>
<s> 1.  </s>
<s> In the URL, via munging (e.g., 2. In headers, which often end up being method-specific (such as LockEntry, which if used as a header would have limited applicability outside LOCK and CHECKOUT).  </s>
<s> 3. In the message body.  </s>
<s> In this category, we had the choices of a) using the same content type for all methods (e.g., application/davparams) or b) having method-specific content types.  </s>
<s> Combinations of the above choices are also available.  </s>
<s> Combining approaches #2 and #3 offers the advantage that headers which have utility across methods can be placed into headers, where appropriate.  </s>
<s> This combination approach is primarily what was followed in the current WEBDAV draft, with the "Overwrite" header being an example of a header which has utility across many methods (however, the overwrite header may not be necessary, since existing headers may cover its functionality).  </s>
<s> When the design team decided how to package method parameters, there were several concerns: a) the agreement made at the Palo Alto meeting (from the minutes): * The group reached rough consensus that new DAV functionality should be specified with new HTTP methods, with request parameters in the message body.  </s>
<s> However, this was subject to the caveat that existing HTTP/1.1 headers should be used where appropriate and consistent with existing meaning and usage.  </s>
<s> Also, this design choice was not meant to preclude the definition of new headers, if they are the best design choice.  </s>
<s> This reflected a sentiment expressed at this meeting that method-specific headers were not desirable within HTTP -- headers ideally should apply to all methods, not just a single method.  </s>
<s> b) the desire to accomodate potential email access to DAV functionality (this group is not actively working on how this is done, but wishes to make it easy to do so in the future) Affecting the thinking of the design team were the leftover bodies from the approach of using POST with all parameters in the message body, which was in previous drafts.  </s>
<s> At the Palo Alto meeting the group decided to define separate methods rather than do all DAV capability via POST.  </s>
<s> This was due to the consistent feedback from HTTP server authors (I polled Robert Thau/Apache, Anselm Baird-Smith/Jigsaw, and Jim Cunningham/Netscape), that methods were far preferable than a POST based approach.  </s>
<s> However, in the POST approach all parameters were in the message body, and this colored our thinking.  </s>
<s> The other fact that affected the design team was our lack of knowledge about the message/http content type.  </s>
<s> With the design team's biases out on the table, I still find the current approach for parameter packaging (parameters primarily in bodies with specific content types, with a few new headers which apply to many methods -- consistent with the agreement reached at the Palo Alto meeting) to be better than alternatives.  </s>
<s> Alternatives, and their advantages and disadvantages are discussed below: 1. URL munging.  </s>
<s> While this has the advantage of working with downlevel clients, URL munging is bad for many reasons.  </s>
<s> First, URLs are opaque strings which identify resources.  </s>
<s> Once you do parameter munging, an entry in the namespace isn't the identifier for a resource, but rather an identifier for some arbitrary computation.  </s>
<s> Also, the munge then adds extra semantics to the URL, which then makes the URL non-opaque.  </s>
<s> Never seriously considered for DAV because it breaks the semantics of URLs, this technique is used by some existing versioning systems.  </s>
<s> 2. All parameters in headers.  </s>
<s> This approach has the advantage of not requiring many new content types, and is closest to existing HTTP/1.1 practice.  </s>
<s> However, this approach does create a feature interaction problem.  </s>
<s> Every time a new header is introduced into HTTP, it is necessary to detail the interactions between that header and existing methods.  </s>
<s> Also, in the future, every time a new method is added to HTTP, all existing headers must be checked for applicability or interactions with the new method (in fact, there is a definite need to go through all of the HTTP/1.1 headers and decide whether they apply to the DAV methods, and what they mean if they do apply).  </s>
<s> This problem is mitigated by placing the method parameter information in the message body.  </s>
<s> With all method parameters in the body, the parameters are *modularized*, and are in a location where the server can immediately know the information relates to a specific method.  </s>
<s> This allows a server to immediately reject a method-specific parameter if the client sends it as a header.  </s>
<s> And, if a new method is introduced, the parameter attributes do not need to be examined in the light of this new method.  </s>
<s> If the new method wants to use existing parameter attributes, it can, but it isn't forced to do a time-consuming evaluation of the new method versus all existing headers.  </s>
<s> Similarly, the method parameter attributes for all DAV methods do not need to be examined to see if they affect existing HTTP/1.1 methods, which would be the case if they were defined as headers.  </s>
<s> The design team also believed that method-specific content types which encapsulate method parameter attributes would be conducive to email access to DAV functionality.  </s>
<s> However, given that the HTTP message would be packaged into a message/http content type (which could carry the method parameter attributes as headers as easily as parameters in the message body), this does not end up being a substantial advantage for the parameters in message body approach.  </s>
<s> However, the email usage case *does* provide support for using method-specific content types rather than using an application/davparams content type.  </s>
<s> Since email may deliver messages out-of-order, by having the method name in the content type, a client can reconnect a method response to a method request.  </s>
<s> The design team worked to make sure the response carried enough information so that a client could reconnect a response it to a request, even if it was received out-of-order.  </s>
<s> Having the request information packaged in a special content type also has the advantage that a request can be formulated once, stored in an intermediate location, then reused verbatim in potentially many requests.  </s>
<s> However, I cannot easily come up with a convincing usage case for this capability.  </s>
<s> Thus, the most compelling argument in favor of packaging method parameters into the message body and defining new content types is modularity, and the information hiding that results from this modularity.  </s>
<s> This prevents the need for an exhaustive header interaction analysis for new method parameter headers.  </s>
<s> The compelling argument in favor of method-specific content types is reconnecting out-of-order responses with initial requests, which may occur in email usage of DAV.  </s>
<s> This post represents my understanding of the design team's rationale for their choice of method parameter packaging.  </s>
<s> I welcome your comments on our choice.  </s>
<s> Certainly, if the group decides on an alternate approach, then the opinion of the group will hold.  </s>
<s> - Jim  </s>
<s> The problem really is that "method specific content type" is contrary to the spirit and practice of MIME.  </s>
<s> Content types were intended not as an arbitrary type space, but as a specific method for determining the appropriate DISPLAY method for a package of data.  </s>
<s> If you want to send arbitrary data packaged up, you might as well use ASN.1 and BER.  </s>
<s> I think that the "design group" got itself into a bind by taking the rough sentiment of the Palo Alto meeting without letting the group interact about the consequences of that design.  </s>
<s> # 1.  </s>
<s> In the URL, via munging (e.g., http://foo.bar.com/junk.html?type=exlusive_write)  </s>
<s> Part of the reason you've gotten to this place is by having interfaces with too many parameters.  </s>
<s> Why should the client have to decide ahead of time whether a call is "exclusive write"?  </s>
<s> # 2. In headers, which often end up being method-specific (such as LockEntry, # which if used as a header would have limited applicability outside LOCK and # CHECKOUT).  </s>
<s> Why are lock entries different from entity tags?  </s>
<s> # 3. In the message body.  </s>
<s> In this category, we had the choices of a) using # the same content type for all methods (e.g., application/davparams) or b) # having method-specific content types.  </s>
<s> Or multipart/form-data or even application/x-url-encoded. As long as you're pursuing the tack of doing a general purpose distributed object protocol, and the question is "how do you hide this in HTTP", you'll wind up solving a problem that is much more general than you needed to solve, and with much more serious entailments.  </s>
<s> Larry  </s>
<s> As a compromise between overloading POST, a method with well understood semantics with the risk of breaking proxies, why not create a single DAV-specific server-side collection management method that will function as an extended POST with its actions keyed off of the request IMT? -marc  </s>
<s> It seems to me that the approach most consistent with the HTTP architecture is 1. Define a new method (using PEP perhaps?) 2. Use a standard media type in thed request header, such as multipart/form-data. 3. Encode any parameters (including the request type) in request body.  </s>
<s> I have to agree that kludging the media type by adding a new webdav type is a major departure from the HTTP architecture, an we shouldn't go down this road.  </s>
<s> Another idea I've been considering (and maybe this is why I suggested multipart/form-data) is to use Content-Disposition to specify what server object (I can't think of a better term) should handle the request.  </s>
<s> Possible objects would include lock and version managers.  </s>
