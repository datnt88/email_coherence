<s> Yesterday I did a CVS "GET" of the full DOM-Test-Suite and am now having problems running the DOM Level2 HTML tests.  </s>
<s> IE6 now reports 363 failures.  </s>
<s> I looked at some of the errors and there seemed to be a fair amount that were reporting incorrect values for the "ASIZE".  </s>
<s> Most were returning an ASIZE value of 0 when 1,2 etc. was expected.  </s>
<s> Anyone else have a similar problem or suggestion?  </s>

<s> Don't recall any recent activity that would have caused anything to change.  </s>
<s> However, I pretty sure that the HTML tests (like the XML tests under Mozilla) precariously depend on faking a synchronous load and would be subject to massive failure if the test file load didn't complete when expected.  </s>
<s> You might check the readyState property on the test document to see if it is possible that the test document is not fully loaded.  </s>
<s> Guidance on how to do this would be greatly appreciated.  </s>
