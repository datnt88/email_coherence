Hello, I'm running Amaya2.1 on SCO ODT 5.04. 
When viewing html-pages with "a lot of" .gif pictures Amaya tells me gifhandler: too much input data, ignoring extra... and some .gif - pictures seemes to be incomplete. 
What does that message mean ? 
We use a old gif package and we don't have time to update that package. 
How can I avoid this problem ? 
(There is no way do decrease the amount or size of .gif files; the html-pages are part of an existing documentation). 
It's more a problem of internal structure then a problem of image size. 
Irene. 
It shouldn't be too difficult to upgrade to the latest version of libungif (4.1.0), which is currently maintained by Michael Brown. 
See: This library seems to be the most popular one currently in use. 
Many Linux distributions already have it installed as shared library by default.
