<s> Bijan and I thought a heads-up is in order.  </s>

<s> Dan Connolly, W3C http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/  </s>
<s> Interestingly, I note the log seems to include a fair amount on the issue of whether the p in "s p o" is somehow more important than the s and o.  </s>
<s> This is one Bijan and I disagree strongly on -- the little bit of logic programming training I cling to always started by saying the Predicates are more important than the constants or variables they refer to for determining how the program runs -- that is P(x,y).  </s>
<s> P(x,y) :- Q(x,z), R(z,BIJAN).  </s>
<s> would be mainly dependent on P, Q, R -- BIJAN would just be a database lookup, or would require looking for a rule with respect to R thus, when I taught Prolog, I taught a lot about design of the predicates, and nothing about the design of the constants except "they must bind"  </s>

<s> This seems to me an argument that predicates may be more important than subjects and objects in the design of inference processes, but not necessarily that they are more important in the determination of meaning.  </s>
