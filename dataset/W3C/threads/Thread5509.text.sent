Many thanks to Scooter Morris for updating this directly as we discussed it at the workshop. 
I have made a few changes to reflect new W3C situations. 
Comments? 
Best wishes, Steven Pemberton Just as a reminder, the workshop is documented at Greetings Steven, just a couple of minor observations. 
In section 4 you explicitly call out a small number of groups with which there should be some coordination. 
You include Accessability &amp; Internationalization but omit a similar broad based activity Device Independence. 
As a member of the DI WG I am endeavouring to encourage more interaction between these three activities. 
You last point in section 6 begs the question "based on what metrics?". 
Regards, Roland "Steven Pemberton" steven@w3.org

Best wishes, Steven Pemberton Just as a reminder, the workshop is documented at #### uig-charterx-v2.html has been removed from this note on January 23 2003 by Roland Merrick ...metrics for success... 
I'm not sure what we could use for metrics. 
we are begging the question, I think, because we would consider just getting some discussion going with IG participants and other W3C groups "success" in the short term. 
Perhaps this is enough for section 6. I'd like to see some thoughts from W3C folks about this since I am not familiar with other W3C charters.

Subject: [Moderator Action] Re: Draft Charter Will we be making a distinction between Web sites and Web-based applications? 
Are we lumping the two together, or are Web-based applications outside the scope of this group/consortium? 
Cheers!

In theory, theory and practice are the same, but in practice, they're not -- anonymous Is this draft on the website yet? 
4) Other groups I don't know what all the acronyms mean. 
Best practice in a document is to spell out the names in full and put the abbreviation in brackets after. 
For this sort of effort to success it should be explicitly multi-national and multi-cultural. 
Maybe there should be more reference to non-US groups (assuming that they are all US groups), such as the British HCI group. 
6) Success I'd like to see the success criteria in a 3-column format with headings of item, description, measure Measures don't all have to be hard, but I think it's weak to have 'useful comments'. 
Who decides what's useful, and if the number of 'useful' comments meet the mark? 
In this case we could have something like 'positive response from the chairs of other W3C groups on the input from this UG'. 
7.2) Communication As an example of usability best practice, the words 'domain leader' should be linked to a small popup, or a page elsewhere that defines the term. 
All publications should follow this principle if, as in this case, they are likely to be read by people who are unfamiliar with the jargon.

* Good question. 
As a practical matter, we are just starting the interest group and don't have a lot of resources, so it makes sense to me to initially just look at web sites. 
The question of web apps being in scope or not is, perhaps, something that should be discussed once the IG gets going. 
There are obviously some issues that would carryover, but once you enlarge the scope to apps you have to look at software usability issues in general. 
The WAI guidelines, for example, skirt around this issue. 
Many guidelines are specific to markup languages, but where needed they mention things like making embedded applications accessible or recommending good software design practice. 
I don't think the scope in the charter itself needs to be more specific at this point.

In theory, theory and practice are the same, but in practice, they're not -- anonymous Quoting Nick Gassman nick@netwiz.demon.co.uk : I'll put it on the http://zing.ncsl.nist.gov/uig_w3c/ 
site today, dated. 
It is in the listserv archives as well: good points about acronyms and non-US HCI groups; I agree. 
Look at the WAI charter: success criteria is similar to ours: At this point I think it is premature to put in tables and spend a lot of time. 
I do like NIck's re-wording of "useful comments" to'positive response from the chairs of other W3C groups on the input from this UG' IN general YES, but the audience here is the W3C executive committee so this is not jargon to them. 
Sharon I would take this further. 
Some of the people who attended this workshop did so solely due to their interest in improving web-based applications. 
If the scope is dropped to only be web sites, not only will the group lose the chance to improve the tools and standards of a vast set of web applications, they will lose interested participants as well (including myself, for one). 
Todd, great quote in your signature.
