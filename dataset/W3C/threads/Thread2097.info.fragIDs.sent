<s> I recently came upon this question while moving a web server from one machine to another.  </s>
<s> The need was to keep some executables and cgi scripts on the original machine.  </s>
<s> What appears to happen when a POST is redirected is the client attempts a GET at the new URL so that the user can fill-in the form again (it may have changed when it moved)  </s>
<s> Is this "correct" handling?  </s>

<s> That sounds broken, IMHO.  </s>
<s> The source of the form has nothing to do with the Action method of it.  </s>
<s> For example, I frequently use a small form which I took from http://src.doc.ic.ac.uk/archieplexform.html,  </s>
<s> trimmed, and embedded in my home page.  </s>
<s> When I submit the form, it posts it to src.doc.ic.ac.uk via http.  </s>
<s> If the redirect meant I had to fill in the form again, I wouldn't be happy at all.  </s>
<s> Or maybe this is a psychological tactic, to encourage users to update permanently moved links...  </s>
<s> For temporary redirects, it's definitely wrong (for example, the redirect may depend on the form data).  </s>

<s> There are several pages on the Web ("The Revolving Door" comes to mind) which, on the basis of form input, redirect you to one of a number of different pages.  </s>
<s> These pages then need to be retrieved using GET.  </s>
<s> This usage appears to be much more common than a redirect where the client is supposed to POST again on the target system.  </s>
<s> At a very early stage of development, Enhanced Mosaic would actually do another POST after a redirect.  </s>
<s> In every case that this happened, it generated incorrect results (like an "Action not allowed" response).  </s>
<s> I think that switching to GET after a redirect is current practice for most browsers.  </s>
