I, I'm still suprised that in V3.1 of Amaya, the Link Attribute function doesn't call a file browser where we can put such an www adress or a HMML, JPG... file name ! 
Actually, we have to write all the path and file name in the menu entry. 
Could something con be done ? 
Thanks to Amaya team, Benji.

You're right. 
We propose a file browser for opening a document but not for linking it. 
Irene.

Benji, Are you aware that if the target of the link is open in an Amaya window, you can just click on that window? 
This means that most of the time you don't have to type a full URL if you are editing related documents, as you have the target open as well. 
You can choose a particular spot within the target document if you turn on "Show Targets" in the View menu. 
Cheers, Scott 
That's not fine for making link towards a picture (not insert picture) : I still have to type all the path and name of the picture. 
Moreover, when I work in a html file, I don't want to be forced to open the other one in order to make links, especially if it's an external link the web and you aren't connected all during the day. 
That's the reason I sent you a mail 10 days ago. 
Thanks for all, Benji.
