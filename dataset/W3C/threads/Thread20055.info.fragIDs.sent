<s> I, I'm still suprised that in V3.1 of Amaya, the Link Attribute function doesn't call a file browser where we can put such an www adress or a HMML, JPG... file name !  </s>
<s> Actually, we have to write all the path and file name in the menu entry.  </s>
<s> Could something con be done ?  </s>
<s> Thanks to Amaya team, Benji.  </s>

<s> You're right.  </s>

<s> Benji, Are you aware that if the target of the link is open in an Amaya window, you can just click on that window?  </s>
<s> This means that most of the time you don't have to type a full URL if you are editing related documents, as you have the target open as well.  </s>
<s> You can choose a particular spot within the target document if you turn on "Show Targets" in the View menu.  </s>
<s> Cheers, Scott  </s>
<s> That's not fine for making link towards a picture (not insert picture) : I still have to type all the path and name of the picture.  </s>
<s> Moreover, when I work in a html file, I don't want to be forced to open the other one in order to make links, especially if it's an external link the web and you aren't connected all during the day.  </s>
<s> That's the reason I sent you a mail 10 days ago.  </s>
<s> Thanks for all, Benji.  </s>
