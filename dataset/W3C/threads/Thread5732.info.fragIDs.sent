<s> Hi, I need some help.  </s>
<s> I can't seem to get the wine ontology [1] to work.  </s>
<s> From earlier posts on w3 realated mailing-lists I have gathered that there has been some problems with this ontology.  </s>
<s> First of all, is [1] the correct (i.e. most up-to-date) wine ontology?  </s>
<s> I am using the ontology together with RACER [2].  </s>
<s> The problem is that I can't realize the ABox.  </s>
<s> I am told that the ABox is incoherent and that  </s>
<s> doesn't sound right.  </s>
<s> Anyone with similar experience?  </s>
<s> Any suggestions, pointers or ideas would be much appreciated.  </s>

<s> Hi, Racer still assumes the unique name assumption (UNA) for individuals.  </s>
<s> Therefore, Racer finds the wine Abox inconsistent.  </s>
<s> This should be fixed soon because we are working on a pre-alpha release of Racer (version 1.8) that does not assume the UNA anymore as default.  </s>
<s> It will be possible to optionally switch on the UNA.  </s>

<s> Thank you for clarifying that for me.  </s>
<s> Now that you mention the UNA situation I remember seeing a post about it on some related mailing- list but it had completely slipped my mind.  </s>
<s> Could you mention any timeframe within which the new version of Racer, not assuming UNA, would be available?  </s>
<s> Cheers, Jakob  </s>
