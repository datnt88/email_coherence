Hi, I downloaded the windows executables for 1.4a and tried them out. 
The browser does not appear to display jpg files in the web page (GIFs are okay). 
The downloadable binaries for 1.3a would display them, but when I compiled 1.3a 
it had the same problem, so I'm assuming my compile (still running) will also 
not display JPEGS. 
Any idea how to correct this? 
The code appears to be all there... On a related note, it also does not appear to display background pictures ("background" tag for the body declaration). 
Any way to make it? 
Thanx E. Evan McLean ev@deathsdoor.com

We forgot to patch the libjpeg in the Windows 95 release. 
Now it's correct. 
PLEASE RELOAD THE UP TO DATE FILE: amaya-Windows95-1.4a.exe 
The patch is not available in the source tarfile. 
We're looking for a solid solution. 
That depends of the picture format. 
Regards Irene.

also 
Is there a procedure for patching my own compiled binary so that it will display jpegs? 
What is the issue with the libjpeg library being linked in?
