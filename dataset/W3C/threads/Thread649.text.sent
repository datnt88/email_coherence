I have been using Tidy for some time but keep having to fix a recurrent bug result: I have the output set to XHTML, but Tidy invariably alters "&amp;amp;" to "&amp;mp;". 
I have gone through and manually changed every single preference that Tidy offers to no avail. 
This sounds like an old bug that was fixed quite a while ago. 
What version of Tidy are using? 
The current version is dated 4 August 2000. 
-Randy Any reply to this? 
May we assume that this is fixed?

Yep, Brian told me that he downloaded the latest version and it disappeared.
