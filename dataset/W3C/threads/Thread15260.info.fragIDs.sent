The regular WCAG meetings will resume next week. 
I guess this is because of Thanksgiving? 
The US is the only country who celebrates Thanksgiving, as far as I know. 
Does this mean that if the US has a holiday, the meeting is cancelled by default? 
How many countries have to celebrate a holiday before a meeting is cancelled? 
Or is it because the conference bridge is located in the US? 
Since this is an international newsgroup I would appreciate it if meetings that are cancelled because of holidays somewhere in the world would be announced a bit earlier. 
If I hadn't had to cancel, I would not have known there was no meeting tonight and would have called in for nothing and wondered what was happening. 
For you Americans out there: Enjoy the holiday!

Hi Yvette, It is not at all unusual for the meeting to be cancelled right after a face-to-face, especially when some members are still traveling back home. 
Also, I think you will find that the working group would cancel the call for any holiday or event that caused a large portion of the working group to not be present. 
This one was cancelled because of the percentage of regular members who would not be able to attend.
