In both the DOM Level 1 and Level 2 specifications, the HTMLSelectElement interface has a "value" attribute. 
I believe this to be an error, as evidenced by all of the following: - The SELECT element in HTML 4.01 has no "value" attribute. 
- The Netscape JavaScript documentation does not list a "value" property for Select objects (see - The HTML 4.01 specification states that when a form is submitted, SELECT elements' names are paired with OPTION elements' values in building the form data set; there is no mention here either of a "value" property for SELECT elements. 
- The description of HTMLSelectElement's "value" attribute in the DOM specification is hopelessly vague: it reads "the current form control value". 
I alluded to this fact in email to this mailing list over a year ago (see received no reply. 
So I'll state this again: I think that the "value" attribute should disappear. 
Could we possibly get this change into the upcoming DOM Level 2 recommendation, or is it already too late for that? 
-adam for form The value property is very usefull for getting what is selected in a SELECT . 
I do agree that the spec is vauge but I think that should be fixed rather then removing the property entierly. 
The two cases that I thing need specifying/clairfying is when no element is selected (can only occur when size  1) or when more then one element is selected (can only occur when multiple is set). 
/ Jonas Sicking You'll need someone more expert than me to give you a definitive answer, but I've used the 'onchange' attribute of SELECT to indicate when a new OPTION is selected, and this _has_ to assume that SELECT has a value. 
It's true that HTML4.01 doesn't explicitly specify a value attribute for SELECT, but it does seem to be implied: 'Menu' is a control type. 
(HTML4.01 17.2.1) 
SELECT has a 'control name'. 
(HTML4.01 17.6) "Each control has both an initial value and a current value, both of which are character strings" (HTML4.01 17.2) And SELECT may have an 'onchange' attribute which implies a value. 
(HTML4.01 17.6) But there's no mention of what the value represents, nor of what the initial or default values might be. 
However, checking in IE5 and Mozilla, the value of SELECT does indeed return a string corresponding to the value of the currently selected OPTION. 
Useful though it may be, I'd hesitate to regard it as definitive. 
Probably wouldn't be a problem if HTML4.01 had been more explicit.
