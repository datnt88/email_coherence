<s> That's quite important given the whole webont layering thing, should probably be lifted up into the first part of the doc.  </s>

<s> Before we contemplate changing what we're calling a "schema" to an "ontology", I'd like to get WebOnt's official blessing on the idea that what we actually have in an RDF schema is an ontology (primitive, perhaps, but an ontology).  </s>
<s> Do they really consider RDF Schemas to be ontologies?  </s>
<s> There have been very extensive debates in various circles on exactly what you have to have in a language in order to claim you have an "ontology" and, if we're going to get involved in such debates, I'd want to make sure the W3C semantic web groups at least are speaking  </s>
<s> with a reasonably common voice.  </s>
<s> My own response to someone who asked whether an RDF Schema was a schema or an ontology would be "it's not an "or" kind of question".  </s>
<s> If they asked whether an XML Schema was a  </s>
<s> schema or an ontology, my response would be "depends on what you intend to use it for" (we have some XML schemas that claim to be ontologies, and in a sense they're probably right).  </s>

<s> This is my view too.  </s>
<s> My own response would be that a _specific_ RDF Schema is an implementation (or embodiment) of a _specific_ ontology.  </s>
<s> To the extent that an ontology can be expressed in a variety of ways, `schema' is the more precise term.  </s>
<s> If you speak of schemas and ontologies in general terms then they tend to become interchangeable.  </s>
<s> Perhaps you can use the words `program' and `algorithm' to illustrate a similar contrast.  </s>
<s> For these reasons it seems right that we should talk about schemas (the embodiment) and WebOnt should talk about ontologies (the abstract).  </s>

<s> Hmmm... I think we ought to be wary about conflating schemas and ontologies.  </s>
<s> They are, I think, related but different ideas.  </s>
<s> Let's see if I can say why... According to John Sowa ["Knowledge Representation", appendix B], an ontology is: a catalogue of the types of things that are assumed to exist in a domain of interest [[D]] from the perspective of a person who uses a language [[L]] for talking about [[D]].  </s>
<s> By contrast, I'd say that a schema is a catalogue of terms in some language, together with descriptions of how they can or should be used.  </s>
<s> The first difference that appears to me is that - an ontology is focused on the domain of discourse (semantics), even if with reference to a particular language, where - a schema is focused on the language (syntax).  </s>
<s> Further, it seems to me that a schema describes a vocabulary, only some  </s>
<s> terms of which may relate to ontological categories.  </s>
<s> In summary, I think we should restrict our discussions to the term "schema", as used to describe the vocabulary of RDF.  </s>
<s> Other groups may have a proper desire or need to use the term "ontology" to talk or reason about categories in their domain of discourse, using RDF language and schema as a vehicle for expressing some of those ideas.  </s>
<s> #g [More...] John Sowa's Knowledge Representation Appendix B goes on to discuss  </s>
<s> languages like CGs and KIF as ontologically neutral, and then to discuss informal and formal ontologies, and in particular axiomatized ontologies.  </s>
<s> Against that background, I think that RDF schemas are language tools that is/will be used and augmented by DAML/OWL to describe axiomatized ontologies.  </s>
<s> I think that the when a schema is described as an ontology, it would be more correct to call it a description of an ontology.  </s>
<s> This seems to be one of those conveniences of expression that is all very well as long as the underlying distinctions are understood.  </s>
<s> Graham Klyne  </s>
<s> .....and what are those, exactly?  </s>
<s> I have never known what this term is supposed to mean.  </s>
<s> Do you mean an RDF graph containing RDFS vocabulary?  </s>
<s> Right, and let's not.  </s>
<s> Both terms have weeds attached that cause confusion.  </s>
<s> Maybe we should use a new term altogether so that *we* can say what it means., something bland like 'module'.  </s>
<s> (??) Or what wrong with just talking about RDF graphs?  </s>

<s> I repeat what I sent to DanBri on this subject:  </s>
<s> The relationship between RDF Schema and XML Schema may need to be clarified; but I hope that's not because both use the term "schema".  </s>
<s> "RDF Schema" is fine!  </s>
<s> Keep in mind that the Web community is not the only relevant community here.  </s>
<s> The database community in particular is quite used to the idea of a "schema" as precisely the sort of thing being described here (and was using the terminology first).  </s>
<s> Both RDF and XML schemas are variants of this same theme.  </s>
<s> We can't possibly invent new terms each time we find some kind of terminology clash (or similarity) when different communities come together.  </s>
<s> We're supposed to be supporting the Semantic Web, for heaven's sake!  </s>
<s> If people can't figure out how to distinguish "RDF Schema", "XML Schema", and "database schema", they're in the wrong business.  </s>
<s> If people are going to have trouble telling an "RDF schema" from an "XML schema", imagine that "RDF" and "XML" are namespace prefixes, and spell them RDF:schema and XML:schema respectively.  </s>
<s> If people can't keep them straight then, we need to go back to the XML namespace folks and tell them it'll never work.  </s>

<s> the problem with 'schema' used as a noun is that there are lots of rdf docs that use RDF schema vocab in various ways, and only some of them (intuitively) feel like things we might label 'schema'.  </s>
<s> Pinning down criteeria for which docs 'are schemas' and which 'merely use RDFS vocab' is pretty slippery.  </s>
<s> Not that we couldn't do it, just that we haven't yet, and it's non-trivial.  </s>
