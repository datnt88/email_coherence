<s> ** Website owners face prosecution ** RNIB takes action over websites which fail to comply with new laws on ease of use for people with disabilities.  </s>
<s> Andrew Sinclair BBC Look East reporter Ensuring web sites are easy for disabled people to use is no longer an option - it is a legal obligation.  </s>
<s> The Royal National Institute of the Blind in Peterborough is warning that anyone running a site faces prosecution if they fail to comply with the law.  </s>
<s> Mark Smith is blind and a great fan of the internet.  </s>
<s> Using voice recognition software he spends hours surfing the net.  </s>
<s> Many of the sites  </s>
<s> he showed me were easy to navigate but not all of them.  </s>
<s> When we find a site for a well known tourist attraction in Norfolk there are graphics and pop-up windows.  </s>
<s> "It can be quite confusing," Mark said.  </s>
<s> "Often there can be difficulties with graphics on the screen, sometimes  </s>
<s> there aren't always text labels and sometimes websites are so large you  </s>
<s> spend some time having to manipulate your speech programme to find the information you need." Adapted keyboards which allow people to use Braille when they type and  </s>
<s> special software to enlarge the screen allows access to a world of information.  </s>
<s> "It's quite exciting because we can get much more of what we need when we need it, " says Richard West, of the Norfolk and Norwich Association  </s>
<s> for the Blind.  </s>
<s> "But now we've got to learn how to manage all the information that's available."  </s>
<s> Under new legislation websites must be easy for disabled people to navigate.  </s>
<s> From their offices in Peterborough Julie Howell of the Royal National Institute of the Blind has begun to prosecute organizations whose sites  </s>
<s> fall short.  </s>
<s> "Companies would be really wise to think about this now," she said.  </s>
<s> "Opening up a website to more people shouldn't mean stifling creativity - it should bring firms so much more business."  </s>
<s> "A lot of companies haven't done anything about it yet.  </s>
<s> You can't avoid  </s>
<s> this.  </s>
<s> It is the law and it's enforceable," said Peter Ballard, of Foolproof, a company in Norwich which advises companies on web page design.  </s>
<s> He said ensuring a site is disabled user-friendly is not as daunting as it sounds.  </s>
<s> Fancy graphics and flash technology are fine as  </s>
<s> long as it can still be read by basic software.  </s>
<s> The new legislation applies anyone who runs a website - individuals or companies.  </s>
<s> There are  </s>
<s> signs that some webmasters are beginning to get the message - but many have not and the RNIB is planning to step up its prosecutions until all  </s>
<s> websites are user-friendly.  </s>

<s> Is this a job-creation measure, or a method to punish either unaware or unexperienced site producers/owners?  </s>
<s> Is it something else, e.g. a technology blockade by declining everything not 100% accessible (okay, chuck away Flash)?  </s>
<s> I don't think Accessibility or Discoverability matters should be a duty-by-law, but a kind of altruistic (I don't do it for me, I do it for other people) option and a self-imposed duty related to the thought there are people who are not that competent to make content accessible for everyone (right now).  </s>
<s> And remember, when you created your first Web page, did you think about (color) blind people or other disabled Web users?  </s>
<s> I didn't, sorry (so I'm glad to see I'm not in prison right now).  </s>
<s> Last but not least, I think W3C's way is best -- to (strongly) recommend Accessibility to all Web site owners or content providers, alluding to all people who cannot handle blinking screens with grey-on-black text and who want to know what 150k image adorns the upper part 'above the fold'.  </s>

<s> Jens, Gang, From what I am aware in the UK the legislation is as such.  </s>
<s> The Disability Discrimination Act of 1995 is in three parts.  </s>
<s> All the interpretations I have seen (not being a lawyer) suggest Part III covers general accessibility in web sites.  </s>
<s> However to my knowledge part III does not come into effect until Oct 2004.  </s>
<s> Also I would imagine as with more conventional (or at least physical) forms of accessibility a certain amount of leeway will be in place for existing sites to get their act together, new sites being expected to be accessible from the get go.  </s>
<s> However what is interesting in Britain is the only formal references (again to my knowledge) to reasonable standards of accessibility are in UK Govt.  </s>
<s> web site guidelines which are not legislative.  </s>
<s> These list several criteria of accessibility and give WCAG 1.0 as a reference but do not specifically insist on any level of conformance.  </s>
<s> This might of course be over ruled by the EU which does specifically use WCAG 1.0 as a measure.  </s>
<s> One does wonder what level of conformance will be obligated since I myself feel that WCAG 1.0 triple-a conformance is eminently possible, obvious other parties don't agree (take section 508, WCAG 1.0 a with skip nav).  </s>
<s> Just some thoughts and perhaps a little information, Tom Behalf Of Jens Meiert (Thank you, John) Well, although almost everyone subscribed to this list is an Accessibility protectionist, I'm really struck by this article -- this can't be true.  </s>
