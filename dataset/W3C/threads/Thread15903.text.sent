Here's a section from some documentation for my prototype browser. 
The section discusses frames and framesets. 
Frames If this browser reads a page with frames, it will display a menu with a description of each frame. 
The description can include word count, number of links, number of forms and a list of significant words. 
To choose the desired frame, just enter the number of the frame followed by the RETURN key. 
If you ever want to change to a different frame for that page, just type the 'fs' command followed by the RETURN key to re-display the frames menu. 
LRK:: One common frame idiom is for one frame to be a table of contents. 
When you pick a link or button in the table of contents it changes the contents of another frame. 
In the present version of your browser, what happens when the user picks such a link or botton? 
If someone can tell us what other browsers, or combinations of browsers and screenreaders, do, please join in. 
BTW, the author guidelines discuss frames at Also, what would be a good home for collecting this sort of information, i.e. the behavior of current browsers and browser/screenreader combinations? 
E.g. should it be considered as part of the charter of the new RC group http://www.w3.org/WAI/RC/ ?

Holmdel NJ 07733 If the user is viewing an index frame in the second area and selects a link which changes the frame in the third area, my browser will switch to displaying the new frame in the frame third area. 
LRK:: Excellent! 
So we really shouldn't give up on frame access. 
This confirms that frames show logical relations which can be presented to a blind user in a non-visual way. 
to follow up on what Scott Luebking said: If the user is viewing an index frame in the second area and selects a link which changes the frame in the third area, my browser will switch to displaying the new frame in the frame third area. 
When the browser switches frames, is there any cue that this has happened? 
Al Gilman SL:: I'm not quite clear about the question. 
The frame changes in response to the user's action so the user is expecting a change. 
I think the browser does say something about a new frame so that the user doesn't think that link changed the web page rather than just the frame. 
Scott What happens depends on the screen reader and browser technology.
