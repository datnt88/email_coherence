Hi, I configure an Apache server to send a special mime.types 
when serving files with a special extension : myfile.dchtml is served with "application/amaya" mime.type myfile.dchtml are in fact generated html files. 
The goal is to tell every client to launch Amaya when this type of document is requested. 
It works. 
Because Amaya does not know this special mime.type, the document is opened in text mode. 
Is there a way to let Amaya know that these document are in fact HTML documents ? 
Thanks. Best regards, Catherine.

Amaya detects that the document is written in html: 1) when the mime-type is text/html 2) when the suffix is (case insensitive) .html, 
.html.xx, .htm, 
.htm.xx, shtml, jsp, xht, xhtml 3) when the mime-type is text/xml and the document includes the tag html 4) when the suffix is xml and the document includes the tag html You can play either on the mime-type or on the suffix.

Thanks Ir?ne. 
But all these extensions may already be defined and used by other applications. 
That's why I was thinking of defining a specific combination of mime type and extension. 
So I patch Amaya code to add a new extension and tell Amaya that files having this extension have to be treated as HTML. 
To do that I : - open AHTURLTools.c 
- search for the IsHTMLName function - add the new extension among if (!ustrcmp (nsuffix, TEXT("html")) || !ustrcmp (nsuffix, TEXT("htm")) || !ustrcmp (nsuffix, TEXT("shtml")) || !ustrcmp (nsuffix, TEXT("jsp")) || !ustrcmp (nsuffix, TEXT("xht")) || !ustrcmp (nsuffix, TEXT("xhtm")) || !ustrcmp (nsuffix, TEXT("xhtml"))) return (TRUE); - compile and build There are more and more applications which are defining their own extensions to treat special html files. 
I am thinking for example of .asp, 
.php, 
.dwt 
(dreamweaver HTML templates files)... 
So having a ressource file to define that in Amaya without recompiling would be useful. 
Thanks to think about it. 
Best regards, Catherine. 
All in all it is better if you can use HTTP to give you a content-type for the file (and if you can specify one with new documents). 
Then the suffix is not so important. 
The other problem with suffixes is that there are clashes - Some RealMedia files and most RPM packages use the extension .rpm 
so it is only possible to find out what they are from getting a content-type. 
And beause the Macintosh OS has always included a content type (of sorts) Macintosh users typically do not bother to use any extension since they don't need one.
