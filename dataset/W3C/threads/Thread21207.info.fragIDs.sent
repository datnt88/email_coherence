<s> the following short test program shows that Amaya doesn't display title attributes while all other browsers tested show them as tooltip like popup boxes.  </s>
<s> These can be extremely useful to page readers as longer explanations can be offered as to where a hotlink may take them or perhaps a definition of a rarely used word or term.  </s>
<s> Consistency  </s>
<s> between ways browsers render attributes and properties help both the author and the reader as one can't enforce tools other uses.  </s>

<s> All we can do for the moment is to display the title attribute with the href attribute in the status bar when one click on a link.  </s>

<s> ok -- as long as this is on wish list!  </s>
<s> i realize that there are many priorities and this may be one that is low compared to others... i use the title attribute as a redundancy for javascript tooltips but javascript also fails ;-] thanks for responding.  </s>

<s> I would prefer that approach if it is easy to do - it is what iCab and Safari do, and I find it much less intrusive than tooltips, at the same time being helpful.  </s>

<s> what happens if the title attribute is associated with other elements say a heading tag or in my case is use it with a span tag to mark a word needing definition in context .... does clicking on that elements contents reveal the message ??? title attribute has many uses ;-] ;-] Date forwarded: Wed, 16 Jul 2003 11:46:52 -0400 (EDT) Copies to: www-amaya@w3.org  </s>
