Hi Rob, I only just got around to doing a quick test. 
I certainly looks quite useful, and the output is simple to browse. 
One thing I miss though: file upload. 
I am working on an application where users must always first login - which means that Cynthia could never test more than the login page (which is about the easiest one). 
Any plans to add a file upload feature? 
I also wondered why 508 is the default choice - that seems inappropriate for a web-wide service. 
WCAG 1 or 2 would be better as a default IMO. 
Or set it to no choice (blank) and require the user to make a choice.

perhaps an interface could be added for the purpose of allowing you to log in from Cynthia Says.

Alas, that would (often) not be enough. 
At least not for many sites where login is required: there are many mechanism for logging in to applications. 
While basic authentication (implemented by the web server) could be easily implemented by allowing a username/password part of the URL to be tested, the situations where logging in is implemented by the application itself are far harder to handle and will differ from one application to the next. 
Excepting basic authentication (which actually may already work with Cynthia, although there's a security aspect, of course), once Cynthia *had* logged in, it (she?) would still need to navigate to the page to be tested: depending on the application that may not just be a URL either but involve separate steps. 
While file upload isn't ideal, at least it allows the developer to make a capture of a (generated) page and have that tested. 
I'm currently doing that to be able to test for XHTML-compliance at the W3C validator.
