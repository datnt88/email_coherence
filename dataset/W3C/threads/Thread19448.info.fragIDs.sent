<s> Hi When I "Open Document" in Amaya installed for Win95, and I "Browse" to open a local file, Amaya totally shuts down when I "Confirm" the selected file.  </s>
<s> I've tried the Enter key instead, as welll as opening a new window but that does not work either.  </s>
<s> It also does not take an address typed in the Address box.  </s>
<s> Is there a bug in the program?  </s>
<s> BTW I agree with Mario Alves that Amaya should focus on being a browser -- and a proper one.  </s>
<s> Forget about your authoring service.  </s>
<s> Thank you Jacques  </s>
<s> Dr Jacques Steyn wrote in message ...  </s>
<s> The notion that "everybody can be a publisher" is fundamental to the Web and has been there from day one: Tim Berners-Lee's first NextStep browser was also a GUI editor.  </s>
<s> I agree with you that Web apps should be fast but what we can show with the latest Amaya is that by using an optimized HTTP protocol stack, editors don't have to be slow nor do they have to break the "browsing" mode of users.  </s>
<s> Henrik Frystyk Nielsen, W3C  </s>
<s> I agree.  </s>
<s> Amaya should focus on continuing to be the best cross-platform multi-view editor available.  </s>
<s> Improvements to the browsing would be nice, but there are more good browsers than good editors to choose from at the moment.  </s>

<s> Henrik Frystyk Nielsen replied to a previous message of mine:  </s>
<s> I agree with your approach, and really support you guys at the W3C in this regard.  </s>
<s> But my point was really the following: By trying to be both a browser and editor, Amaya has not succeeded yet in  </s>
<s> being either.  </s>
<s> 1.  </s>
<s> There is currently no browser that can understand HTML 4.0 and CSS 2.0 markup and render it properly.  </s>
<s> From the W3C recommendations I often get some or other intention for an element or the like, but proprietory browsers seem to follow their own noses and release browsers that do not follow the W3C's intentions (as I read them).  </s>
<s> So I am looking to Amaya to fulfil this role -- to show how intented markup should be rendered.  </s>
<s> 2. Over the past few years I have used many different kinds of markup editors: SGI's WebMagic and CosmoCode, Miscrosoft's Frontpage, and now I  </s>
<s> use Macromedia's Dreamweaver.  </s>
<s> Apart from Dreamweaver all the other packages force  </s>
<s> markup in where I do not want it, so I have grown accustomed to using  </s>
<s> Jot on Unix and Notepad on Windows to panelbeat the resulting markup.  </s>
<s> In fact, panelbeating has become such a schlepp that once I knew the elements properly I preferred using a bland text editor to anything available on the market --  </s>
<s> until Dreamweaver came along.  </s>
<s> The beauty of this package is that you can work in its (kind-of) WYSIWIG window and markup editor simultaneously, and most importantly, it does not overrride one's markup.  </s>
<s> So in my view standard text editors do the job of authoring just fine.  </s>
<s> Apart from Dreamweaver there is not really any authoringware I would like to use and nothing to recommend.  </s>
<s> I'd rather stick to Jot or Notepad.  </s>
<s> So I think it is a waste of time to try to develop Amaya as authoringware.  </s>
<s> Given the present state of Amaya you will have to go a very long way before you reach the efficiency of Dreamweaver.  </s>
<s> And for those who cannot afford this expensive package, a plain text editor does just fine.  </s>
<s> Admittedly, the learning curve is steeper, but with copy and paste, and the large number of validators available, who needs another package that seems to be battling to get off the ground, and at this stage seems to need to go a very long way before it gets to the Dreamweaver level of efficiency?  </s>
<s> I really think that there is a greater need for a proper browser than for yet another editing tool.  </s>
<s> It would be interesting to see if others share this view -- and perhaps even be more interesting to see what methods are used to cook up markup.  </s>
<s> But don't take this too harsh.  </s>
<s> I think you guys are doing a great job!  </s>
<s> Regards Jacques  </s>
<s> I use a text editor and several other editors.  </s>
<s> I want something to test HTML 4.0 and CSS 2.0 markup and render it properly.  </s>
<s> I want something to test MATHML markup and render it properly.  </s>
<s> That does not exits yet.  </s>
<s> Amaya does not do this yet.  </s>
<s> Even Microsoft word can produce HTML.  </s>
<s> I need to test then HTML from these  </s>
<s> editors.  </s>
<s> The verification service is the only way I have of testing HTML.  </s>
<s> That is a slow process.  </s>
<s> If Amaya could verify HTML 4.0 that would be a  </s>
<s> big step forward.  </s>
<s> If Amaya could point to the error that would be a big step forward.  </s>
<s> You can open two windows, Amaya and the editor.  </s>
<s> It is easy to jump between the browser and the editor.  </s>
<s> There is little advantage to having them in the same program.  </s>

<s> said:  </s>
<s> Except when it come to editing tables or complex multi-level lists, in which case WYSIWYG editors are far superior.  </s>
<s> Have you tried AOLpress?  </s>
<s> It's available for free for Unix, Windows and Mac platforms at http://www.aolpress.com/download.html.  </s>
<s> It supports HTML 3.2 and is quite impressive at generating good HTML syntax.  </s>
<s> I've been using it for years now, and keep using it when I don't need to do HTML 4 specific stuff.  </s>
<s> It allows you to edit the HTML code directly, if you wish, and you can choose when the updated HTML code should be parsed to update the WYSIWYG window.  </s>
<s> Unfortunately, I don't think it is still maintained, which means that it will stay an HTML 3.2 editor.  </s>
<s> Anyway, going back to your comment, I don't think you can accuse Amaya of forcing mark-up on you, can you?  </s>
<s> I really hope that W3C will keep working on Amaya as a WYSIWYG editor with embedded browsing capabilities.  </s>
<s> I find it very useful, and I find the "book" and link printing capabilities very useful too .  </s>
<s> I would just hope they had more manpower to move a little faster at implementing all of CSS1.  </s>
<s> Peace, Bertrand Ibrahim.  </s>

<s> Amaya is mainly an editor.  </s>
<s> We think that a good editor needs to be also a browser, because the management of links and the publishing are important parts of the editing task and they can be well done only if the editor integrates browsing facilities.  </s>
<s> The goal of the W3C and the Amaya team is not to build a product (we don't have the task force to do that), but to push some important ideas.  </s>
<s> Mixing of editing  </s>
<s> and browsing is one of them.  </s>
<s> Another is to avoid people to have to learn HTML, but this can be true only when authoring tools will produce good HTML code.  </s>
<s> It seems that you don't like that approach, and you prefer to edit freely the HTML source.  </s>
<s> That's OK today for computer scientists but not for many people.  </s>
<s> I agree with you that Amaya has to make progress, we are working on it, but you have to accept to learn a minimum about it to discover that some features should be developed (links management, multi-views, management of map areas, XML support) Regards Irene.  </s>
<s> I think one of your problems here is that you are seen as the only viable non-commercial browser by people who want a Microsoft free system (Netscape is a lot behind IE in its support for CSS and HTML 4).  </s>
<s> I appreciate that is not your aim, but I think that you need to appreciate the policital context.  </s>
