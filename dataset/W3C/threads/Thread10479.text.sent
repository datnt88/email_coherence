Outstanding objections document LC1 Issue xmlsch-02 Discussion of (member only) draft comments from XML Schema WG and the whitespace processing xmlsch-02 issue. 
A straw poll was held on the proposal by JJC in and did not receive strong enough support for that change. 
The default of no document changes on this issue remains.

FrankM to respond. 
DaveB noted http://dublincore.org/documents/2002/07/31/dcmes-xml/ 
"comments on 26 September version of RDF Semantics document" - PFPS PatH has responded to all of these points "RDF Semantics: partial review" - Herman ter Horst PatH has adopted some wording changes to clear up things here. 
JJC noted that more comments may appear as this is a partial review. 
LC2 review period for other groups web services - interested, nobody yet signed up to do the work xml core - met and agreed to provide responses, want 4 weeks xml schema - on agenda in WG meeting today, expect to say yes htmlwg - expect to review it, no comments on what timescale ACTION 2003-10-03#9 ericm chase other groups on the 'heads up list' re reviews for RDF LC2 WDs Document status and critical paths concepts - missing SOTD, no links scripts yet primer - Need to update rdf:RDF change just made and using non-validating XML parsers; will update by 6th Oct. semantics - tiny further edit needed for NFC syntax - none Script for links ACTION 2003-10-03#10 ericm produce boiler place for RDF LC2 SOTD template. 
If done earlier, editors will add document-specific bits. 
ACTION 2003-10-03#11 daveb work with danbri's script for fixing up internal references Details: Reference urls like this (for schema): Publication date (put this on the documents and in references): 10 October 2003 Docs should be ready by Wednesday 8 October 2003 Change logs should be checked that they are correct and mention non-editorial changes; ones that are visible from a test case. 
A suggestion that HTML diffs from previous versions may be produced (bwm to investigate). 
Proposal: Hayes/IMWC Move all 6 working drafts to second Last Call Seconded: Carroll/HP. 
Against: none. 
Abstain: none. 
Review of critical path people/groups primer - want to see change made to rdf:RDF in syntax by daveb concepts - waiting for some i18n feedback (Martin Duerst primarily) syntax - none schema - none, we believe it is ready and unchanged semantics - done, path happy to get eyeballs JJC suggested telling reviewers looking at the current WDs to stop for now, thank them and note new LC2 WD out soon. 
test cases - wording about negative entailment ACTION 2003-10-03#12 daveb either work with jang to change the negative entailment test wording, or do it himself by monday 6th October A new version of the LBase note will be published to go with the LC2 WDs with some small changes; it may be published with them if it is ready, not critical to go that day. 
Meeting closed 13: Handling lc2 comments. 
Not reached snip Not quite. 
I accepted an action to reflect the optionality of rdf:RDF in the Primer. 
It seems silly, given all the examples currently in the Primer, to have yet another example just to omit the rdf:RDF. 
What I propose to do is to comment, at the point where rdf:RDF is introduced, that the enclosing rdf:RDF element is optional in situations where the XML can be identified as RDF/XML by context (but it doesn't hurt to provide it anyway), and to see the Syntax document for further details. 
--Frank On Sat, 04 Oct 2003 15:53:10 -0400 OK. I've done the same in the editor's draft of rdf/xml - mentioned it when I gave the 'full example' and used rdf:RDF for the first time. 
Dave Makes sense to me.
