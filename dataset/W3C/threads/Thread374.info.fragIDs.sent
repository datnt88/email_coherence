<s> I noticed that tidy has a problem parsing Microsoft Webclass tags.  </s>
<s> All webclass tags begin with " WC@".  </s>
<s> The programmer of the webclass defines these tags for the application.  </s>
<s> For example: Even if defining WC@DOMAINNAME in the .CFG  </s>
<s> file as a block level tag, tidy stops parsing the tag name at the '@'.  </s>
<s> becomes: Any ideas (besides not using webclasses) g Thanks, Todd Clark  </s>
<s> Tidy is picky about what characters it expects within tag names.  </s>
<s> Perhaps I should add an option to make it less picky.  </s>
<s> In the meantime you could patch the code for ParseTagName() in lexer.c or you could add @ to the namechar set defined in InitMap() also in lexer.c.  </s>
<s> The source code is available from the Tidy home page Thanks for the input.  </s>
