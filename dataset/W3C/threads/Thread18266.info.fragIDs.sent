<s> Hello, At the 20 July teleconference [1], Eric Hansen suggested that the UA Guidelines (presumably including the 7 July draft [2]) uses the terms style/content inconsistently: "In some places, we don't distinguish style and content, in others we do.  </s>
<s> We need to elaborate our definition of content."  </s>
<s> The definition of "content" in that draft says that "content refers to the document object as a whole or in parts."  </s>
<s> The document object definition says that "the document object is the user agent's representation of data (e.g., a document)."  </s>
<s> This would include style sheets.  </s>
<s> I think we should leave this definition as is.  </s>
<s> For distinguishing structure from presentation (both conveyed in content) I propose that we do what was done in the Authoring Tool Guidelines, which defines the terms structural markup [3] and presentation markup [4].  </s>
<s> I propose that we reuse or adapt those definitions (quoted below) as necessary.  </s>
<s> All of this relates to issue 297 [5], which is entitled "Style v. content and background sounds" (the title needs fixing since it opposes style and content).  </s>
<s> The question is how much UA control is required over certain types of content, notably when that content is used to achieve a presentation effect?  </s>
<s> I think that the answer depends on the type of content: 1) Users need full control of content whose purpose is not a presentation effect.  </s>
<s> The first question is: can we distinguish content intended for a presentation effect from content not intended for a presentation effect?  </s>
<s> My answer would be: the best we can do is rely on what we can recognize as being for style: HTML transitional elements and attributes, style sheets, known non-standard markup such as bgsound.  </s>
<s> (Yes, authors may misuse structural markup for a presentation effect and vice-versa.) Note that I don't have a term for "content not intended for a presentation effect."  </s>
<s> I think we tend to use the term "content" (meaning "having information") here, and that's the source of the inconsistency.  </s>
<s> We can oppose style and structure, and style with non-style.  </s>
<s> Do we need a term for "non-style"?  </s>
<s> (I hope we don't.)  </s>
<s> I would also note that this discussion sounds a little like the discussion about content meant for humans v. content meant for machines.  </s>
<s> Refer to Al's comments on this topic [7]: "The distinction between data (raw content) and meta-data (markup) is an artifact of the view assumed by the author.  </s>
<s> There is no fundamental semantic difference between what is called data vs.  </s>
<s> metadata.  </s>
<s> They both play the same role as bearers of information Semantically, it is all just one class of data.  </s>
<s> This is a little-understood fact of information science."  </s>
<s> Al, will you make the same comment about an assertion that presentation v. non-presentation (or structure)?  </s>
<s> 2) Users also need control of content whose purpose is for presentation, but the level of control depends on the nature of the content (I would argue).  </s>
<s> In some cases, "on/off" control may not suffice for providing access.  </s>
<s> For example, the user needs to be able to select a font family that provides access (and can't just turn off fonts).  </s>
<s> In other cases, I think that on/off control suffices; access is made possible by being able to turn off blinking content, animations used for decoration, and background sounds used for decoration.  </s>
<s> While fine tune control might be useful, I think that a requirement to turn off the interfering content is the Priority 1 requirement.  </s>
<s> I think my proposal for issue 5 that arose during the Mac IE evaluation [6] is still appropriate in this light.  </s>
<s> - Ian P.S. The proposal should include a comment that independent control of volume for different audio sources should NOT be required for background sounds.  </s>
<s> The user must be able to  </s>
<s> configure the UA to not render this merely decorative sound, and that should suffice.  </s>

<s> Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org) http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs Cell: +1 917 450-8783 "Structural markup" is markup language that encodes information about the structural role of elements of the content.  </s>
<s> For example, headings, sections, members of a list, and components of a complex diagram can be identified using structural markup.  </s>
<s> Structural markup should not be used incorrectly to control presentation or layout.  </s>
<s> For example, authors should not use the BLOCKQUOTE element in HTML [HTML4] to achieve an indentation visual layout effect.  </s>
<s> Structural markup should be used correctly to communicate the roles of the elements of the content and presentation markup should be used separately to control the presentation and layout."  </s>
<s> "Presentation markup" is markup language that encodes information about the desired presentation or layout of the content.  </s>
<s> For example, Cascading Style Sheets ([CSS1], [CSS2]) can be used to control fonts, colors, aural rendering, and graphical positioning.  </s>
<s> Presentation markup should not be used in place of structural markup to convey structure.  </s>
<s> For example, authors should mark up lists in HTML with proper list markup and style them with CSS (e.g., to control spacing, bullets, numbering, etc.).  </s>
<s> Authors should not use other CSS or HTML incorrectly to lay out content graphically so that it resembles a list.  </s>
<s> [not promising to have read the rest of the message...] No. These concepts are well-posed enough, even if HTML elements don't sort neatly along these lines.  </s>
<s> In fact, I would try to clarify my earlier remark.  </s>
<s> The syntactic distiction between markup and marked-up content is perfectly clear.  </s>
<s> What I was trying to say is that some people think of metadata as semantically a different class of stuff from data.  </s>
<s> That is what I was claiming is illusory.  </s>
<s> The meta-distinction is a byproduct of the view or packaging, not in the semantic meaning of the data.  </s>
<s> In the case of HTML some markup [counting style rules in a stylesheet as markup, loosely] is clearly presentational and some, such as DIV is clearly structural.  </s>
<s> Now, of course, there is markup like FRAMESET and TABLE which are both.  </s>
<s> This markup has both layout and structural semantics in one  </s>
<s> element type.  </s>
<s> So at least in HTML it is possible to talk about markup with presentational semantics and markup with structural semantics, but it is not possible to partition the set of element types into two groups which are purely one and purely the other.  </s>
<s> Hope this is responsive to your question.  </s>

<s> AG:: I see "quick and truly dirty" ways to do this and "clean and truly too slow for UAAG" ways.  </s>
<s> So I want to know what is the question that we _have_ to answer to release the UAAG as a Recommendation.  </s>
<s> The subject line says "issue 297." Issue 5) Style v. content and background sounds.  </s>
<s> [Note: I believe Eric has already raised this point a number of times.]  </s>
<s> Question: Some content is only meant to decorate.  </s>
<s> This includes simple graphics, colors, animations, and sounds (namely background sounds).  </s>
<s> We require the UA to allow the user to control the volume, speed, and other aspects of animations and sounds.  </s>
<s> But it seems like this is overkill for visual or sound content that is only meant for decoration.  </s>
<s> The author is required by WCAG 1.0 to include text equivalents for every non-text.  </s>
<s> It may be a bug in WCAG 1.0, but I don't think this should be required for non-text content that is only used for decoration.  </s>
<s> We don't require a text equivalent for the fact that the background color of a page is pale yellow.  </s>
<s> Should we require a text equivalent for a background sound that adds to the browsing experience but is only *background sound*, i.e., decoration?  </s>
<s> My opinion on the particular question at hand is that I would not try to give User Agents an exception in this case because it does put information the user could beneficially use out of reach, and it doesn't really save the User Agent much.  </s>
<s> The reduced requirement that I am contemplating is that if a sound is invoked from a BGSOUND attribute or an EMBED element that the only requirement would be to allow the user to permit or forbid the play of the sound.  </s>
<s> The reason this is a bad idea is that it is reasonable and useful for the user to inspect the sound, that is play the sound by itself, even in situations where by reason of contention over the audio output channel the user cannot tolerate having the sound playing in the background as part of browsing the other content of the page.  </s>
<s> Compare the "image links" function in Lynx where all IMG references are turned into links so that the image can be inspected, i.e. displayed separately from the page context.  </s>
<s> The reason I say the exception doesn't save the User Agent builder much of anything is that the difficulty of providing controls over the play of the sound is associated with the type, not the role, of the sound.  </s>
<s> What matters in this regard is whether the sound is MIDI, WAV, or Real, not whether it is elevator music in the background or the voice announcing that you have won the million dollars.  </s>
<s> The user should have the capability to play a) the whole ensemble, b) just the sound, or c) the whole ensemble without the sounds in the ensemble.  </s>
<s> This last would be required because the audio channel has been reserved for the reading of the text.  </s>
<s> Then, in the case of playing just the sound, all the controls that the player exposes for this type should be available, and we would like them to meet our list.  </s>
<s> No matter that the user is inspecting a decoration on the original page.  </s>
<s> That is what they are focusing on, and the usual play controls are of interest in this scenario.  </s>
<s> One key thing to realize about a background sound is that the syncronization of a background sound with the rest of the document is very loose.  </s>
<s> They are not syncronized except that the sound is germane inside some document region and not germane outside that region.  </s>
<s> This is as far as the association gets.  </s>
<s> There is no relationship that matters between where you are in the sound and where you are in the rest of the document.  </s>
<s> So aside from the ability to include, exclude, or inspect the sound, there is no more fine-grained syncronized access to the whole thing that needs to be required.  </s>
<s> I agree that the "inspect function" may be a new function for the browser presenting pages with background sounds, but it is the same old requirement that we need all over the place in multimedia.  </s>
<s> This looks like one of those places where we should screw up our courage and say "Yes, if you are going to use multimedia effects in web pages, you should live by multimedia rules."  </s>
<s> Enabling the user to play the pieces in isolation is one of those generic rules.  </s>
<s> So, to return to the smaller question, I don't think we need to go through HTML and designate which sound roles are substantive and which can be relegated to "just decoration" because in fact the language does not enforce this to a sufficient degree.  </s>
<s> What goes in the sounds covers the full range of decorative to substantive regardless of how invoked.  </s>
<s> Besides, I don't think we need to answer _how_ to tell which sound roles are considered to be decorative, because I don't myself believe we should make the exception in the first place.  </s>
<s> Just because people need to suppress the background as background doesn't mean they don't need to be able to hear the sound (separately).  </s>
<s> Al  </s>
<s> al, I think you have captured the escence of our intent.  </s>
<s> in ie, if you uncheck play sounds, no sounds are played automatically but here again, we  </s>

<s> [snipped some intro text from AG] My comments preceded by IJ:  </s>
<s> IJ: My understanding has been that information conveyed through style sheets (or their markup equivalents) is intended for a particular rendering only and is "disposable" with respect to other renderings.  </s>
<s> Of course, we require that the raw style sheet be available to the user (as part of all content).  </s>
<s> Refer to our discussion about the "W3C Working Draft" background image and lack of alt text from 1999.  </s>

<s> We ask user agents to allow users to turn off background images because they can get in the way.  </s>
<s> However, we don't require more control than that (e.g., the ability to inspect the image as Lynx provides) since background images are disposable and don't require additional control.  </s>
<s> Of course, it's possible to abuse style sheets; the author could insert the entire document with the 'content' property.  </s>
<s> But this is an authoring problem, and I don't know whether we should make additional requirements on user agents based on bad authoring practices.  </s>
<s> IJ: That is the part that I don't agree with.  </s>
<s> Do users need to rewind or slow down sounds that are used purely for decoration?  </s>
<s> Are authors required to provide a text transcript for background sounds that have words?  </s>
<s> We have said that authors are not required to provide alt text for list bullets because they are graphical decoration for structure encoded in markup (refer to discussion on the WCAG list from Nir in 1999 [5]).  </s>
<s> I think that we should require user agents to provide adequate control over content rendering, but I think we don't need to require maximum control over content whose role is only decorative.  </s>
<s> [5] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/1999AprJun/0077.html  </s>
<s> On a related note: Should we require user agents to allow users to rewind and slow down beeps or other short sounds (even "You've got mail")?  </s>
<s> Those sounds may be part of the native user interface or part of content.  </s>
<s> These sounds have a function: convey a message about an event.  </s>
<s> We require that these messages be made available as text in the user interface (checkpoint 1.5).  </s>
<s> Are we also requiring stop, start, pause, rewind, advance, and slow down of this audio?  </s>
<s> If not, why not?  </s>
<s> In this case, the information is not purely decorative.  </s>
<s> The fact that some piece of audio content has a text equivalent doesn't mean that the user agent shouldn't provide control over the audio.  </s>
<s> Thus, I'm not arguing that as soon as an auditory track has an associated text transcript, additional control is not required.  </s>
<s> But I don't think users need to be able to rewind beeps.  </s>
<s> Refer to comments from Eric Hansen about "short sounds" not being part of audio presentations ([6], [7]).  </s>

<s> IJ: Is that an authoring problem?  </s>
<s> Or just because one can't draw the line.  </s>
<s> If it's an authoring problem (i.e., encoding non-decorative information in style) then I don't see why the user agent developers should have to implement more control.  </s>
<s> What about the ability to inspect background images separately?  </s>
<s> That is not currently required by the UA Guidelines.  </s>
