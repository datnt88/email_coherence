<s> I started to test the package with my newbie mode and here is some comments: The zipfile does not create its own directory.  </s>
<s> would be nice if the package unzip in a directory such as "DOML1Core-20020206".  </s>
<s> It is important imo to use the date as a version number.  </s>
<s> correct the link to NIST logo.  </s>
<s> Copy the W3C Icon (instead of link to the web site) copy activity-home.css and toc.js (instead of a link to the web site) Overview provide a link to http://www.w3.org/DOM/Test on the text "DOM Conformance Test Suite"  </s>
<s> Running the ECMA tests - I tried to run alltest.html  </s>
<s> but it did nothing.  </s>
<s> Seems to be at least the same error as Jason (I use mozilla 0.9.8)  </s>
<s> So I applied the patch from Curt and it worked: Runs: 290 Errors: 63 Failures: 25  </s>
<s> I got 3/4 javascript warnings in the console but it worked.  </s>
<s> Running the Java tests: - add "junit-run.jar is in dist/" (java -jar dist/junit-run.jar)  </s>
<s> - if I run java -jar junit-run.jar  </s>
<s> in dist/, the program output: Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/w3c/dom/DOMImplementation  </s>
<s> move the sentence "The parser must be put in the dist directory" before the command line.  </s>
<s> - Once I got the interface, I don't see anything to select.  </s>
<s> If I put org.w3c.domts.level1.core.TestXerces or ...AltConfig, it keeps saying "failed to invoke suite():java.lang.NoSuchMethodError".  </s>
<s> I do have xerces.jar  </s>
<s> in dist/ ... I looked into dom1-core.jar  </s>
<s> and this class doesn't seem to exist?  </s>
<s> Copyight: (s/Copyight/Copyright) please provide a link to a copy of this file in the package?  </s>
<s> (similar to the one included in the DOM specs packages) missing section "How to contribute"?  </s>
<s> Unfortunately, that was the only way I could find to fake a synchronous parse with Mozilla.  </s>
<s> That should be described as an expected exception if you don't have a parser in the classpath.  </s>
<s> The first way described to run the tests should be: java -jar dom1-core.jar  </s>
<s> Which will run all tests in two modes on the default JAXP parser and print results to the console.  </s>
<s> The "TestXerces" and other classes are JUnit specific and therefore are located in junit-run.jar.  </s>
<s> JUnit's GUIs don't populate the combo box (at least for us), but do remember previous entries.  </s>
<s> I haven't seem that message before, it would indicate that the class was loaded, but the suite method doesn't exist which should not be the case.  </s>
<s> Any more diagnosis you could provide would be appreciated.  </s>
<s> I copied a xerces.jar  </s>
<s> found in the CVS repository of xerces itself.  </s>
<s> After checks, it appears that the jar file didn't contain all the relevant class files.  </s>
<s> It worked after using the appropriate xerces.jar.  </s>
<s> I tried with Xerces 2.0 but xercesImpl.jar doesn't seem to be the right jar file to use.  </s>
<s> Philippe  </s>
<s> For Xerces-J 2, you need both xercesImpl.jar and xmlParserAPIs.jar in the directory.  </s>
<s> comments inlined I'll update the sidtro so that it contains stylesheets, pictures and so forth, even though I think the IPR disclaimer should point to W3C, especially sine a verbatim is provided in the matrix.  </s>
<s> For the rest:  </s>
<s> [dd] I'll add a section saying that the TS is produced in accordance with the Process docuemtn and point to it from there.  </s>
<s> [dd] I left this out on purpose since it is a distribution with source files; i could include relevant info in the main page with appropriate links  </s>
