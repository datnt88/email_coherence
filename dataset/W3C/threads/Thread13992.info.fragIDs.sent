[my comments are organized as a list where each item starts with a DD: on column 1 followed by the section number or name] DD: "Status of this document" section. 
unfinished sentence: The goal of the WAI-GL group is to ... I think it should point to the charter. 
DD: "Comments" section. 
I don't like the sentence that says: "We cannot guarantee a personal response but we will try when it is appropriate." 
Basically, this means: we can ignore your comment/request if we want, and that's not acceptable. 
We need to point people to an up-to-date "issue list" document where *all* the issues raised are stored together with their status (need more discussion, ok to be incorporated, no for this and this reason, etc) and their origination (author, date, pointer to message/thread). 
I have several requests for Rating change: DD: 2.5 Provide descriptive titles for all images used as links. 
From Recommended to Required DD: 8.1 Create link phrases that make sense when read out of context. 
From Recommended to Required Even though this is something the browser could have a say about, and help with, I think we should make it a required as it is really a very important navigability issue DD: 5.1,2,3 HTML structural elements are only used to convey meaning, not presentation. 
HTML presentational elements are only used to convey presentation, not meaning. 
Headings are nested properly and are not used for layout. 
All 3 From Recommended to Required, they need to be at the same level as using SS at the beginning. 
DD: 6.1 List structure and list items are correctly encoded. 
From Recommended to Required - same thing as above. 
DD: 3. In the Applet section, I think there is too much Required. 
Given that Java Accessibility is going to be a reality, we should force people to transcribe their applet in some other formats. 
DD: 9.1 Ensure that your pages are readable and usable without frames. 
From Required to Recommended, or an Interim. 
A browser issue really. 
More comments: DD: 2.5 We should also add "descriptive link title", or "description anchor title" to disambiguate with the IMG title.(the 
example is clear, but it's dropped from the checklist for instance) DD: 2.1 We need a section focus on ALT/TITLE/A-TITLE/LONGDESC usage (I sent a separated message about it already) DD: 3. Applets and Scripts Say upfront that APPLET is deprecated. 
DD: 4. Need more examples for AUDIO/VIDEO. 
I understand this could go in the Central Reference but as is, it is inconsistent with other section, such as image, form, which are full of example. 
Either they all get examples, or none of them do. 
I'm for putting at least a short example in all sections (It's nice that they are all marked with a class=example, and CODE ) For the TABLE example appendix, I'd move it to the Central Ref and keep a shorter version inline (no appendix here in other words, besides the checklist) DD: 6. 
We need to talk about list that use image as bullet here, as it is one of the most recurrent abuse of HTML structuring. 
I'm reposting my examples: First, the image is purely decorative and can be expressed solely in CSS. 
UL { list-style: url(button.png) 
} LI Audrey LI Laurie LI Alice Second, the image conveys some information and has to appear in the markup, not in the style (and the default style list visual is turned off so that you don't get double bullet) UL { list-style: none } LI IMG SRC=browneye.png ALT="bullet. 
brown eye drawing" Audrey LI IMG SRC=greeneye.png ALT="bullet. 
green eye drawing" Laurie LI IMG SRC=blueeye.png ALT="bullet. 
blue eye drawing" Alice DD: 12. 3. Offer navigation bars for easy access to the navigation structure. 
Apparently, pages that starts with a navbar are bad for sequential reading (speech in particular) as they force the listener to listen to the same navbar over and over again. 
I think we need to be a little more specific and I suggest we propose a authoring guidelines to "classify" navbar, using the HTML class attribute applied to the element used (frame, image map) or a DIV if there is no navbar element per se: This way a browser can move it down the page or offer it as an option on demand. 
DD: 12.12 Test the site with at least: a text only browser (such as Lynx) a self-voicing browser (such as PWWebspeak) I think requiring lynx is OK (given web ready lynx-it service) but self voicing is unrealistic. 
I concur with Daniel's comments. 
Examples of the use of style sheets to overcome the problem of associating list items with images are definitely needed: both the case in which the image can be relegated to a CSS style and that in which it conveys significant content and needs to be given in the markup with associated ALT text. 
I also think that navigation bars can be problematic. 
An interim solution might be a navigation page which could serve the same purpose, with a link to it at the start of each HTML document. 
The navigation page could provide both an image map and a textual alternative. 
If navigation bars are used, they should be marked with class=navbar as Daniel suggests. 
Likewise, if the PRE element contains computer programme code rather than text in a natural language, this fact should also be marked for the benefit of braille and speech output software, perhaps as class="code". 
Standardised class values are an important component of accessible HTML document construction, since they will also enable the reading order of the document to be modified by the HTML user agent. 
This topic will presumably be discussed within the Protocols and Formats group. 
The BLOCKQUOTE element should only be used to mark genuine quotations, but not as a means of indenting text where no quotation is intended. 
This is probably discussed somewhere in the guidelines but I can't remember reading it in the latest version.

I think using HTML's CODE element inside the PRE element would be better than reliance on classes in this case since CODE gives the structural information to all early browsers. 
Authors could use the CLASS attribute on CODE to indicate the kind of code, e.g., class="HTML" or class="Java". 
Speech browsers could then process common kinds of code more appropriately.

PF will discuss ways to metadating (with RDF) pieces of markup but this document could be more detailed about usage of the existing HTML class attributes. 
It's under 5.2 
JW:: Without re-reading the HTML specification on this point, I am under the impression that any markup inside the PRE element (prior to the end tag of PRE itself) is treated as part of the preformatted text rather than as markup. 
My memory may be wrong here, however. 
If I am right, then using 
the CLASS attribute of the PRE element to distinguish code from text in a natural language would appear to be the only feasible option. 
No it's OK, you can have CODE in PRE: !ATTLIST PRE %attrs; -- %coreattrs, %i18n, %events -- 
A better solution would be to separate the semantics from the presentation by using the "white-space" property: 
CODE.mylanguage { white-space: pre } BEGIN block for i in 1 to 10, do 
end for END block However, this would only work for CSS-enabled browsers.

I guess this means not acceptable, since this would break guideline 1.1...
