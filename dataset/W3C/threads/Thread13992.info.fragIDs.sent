<s> Basically, this means: we can ignore your comment/request if we want, and that's not acceptable.  </s>

<s> I'm for putting at least a short example in all sections (It's nice that they are all marked with a class=example, and CODE ) For the TABLE example appendix, I'd move it to the Central Ref and keep a shorter version inline (no appendix here in other words, besides the checklist) DD: 6.  </s>

<s> Apparently, pages that starts with a navbar are bad for sequential reading (speech in particular) as they force the listener to listen to the same navbar over and over again.  </s>
<s> I think we need to be a little more specific and I suggest we propose a authoring guidelines to "classify" navbar, using the HTML class attribute applied to the element used (frame, image map) or a DIV if there is no navbar element per se: This way a browser can move it down the page or offer it as an option on demand.  </s>

<s> I concur with Daniel's comments.  </s>
<s> Examples of the use of style sheets to overcome the problem of associating list items with images are definitely needed: both the case in which the image can be relegated to a CSS style and that in which it conveys significant content and needs to be given in the markup with associated ALT text.  </s>
<s> I also think that navigation bars can be problematic.  </s>
<s> An interim solution might be a navigation page which could serve the same purpose, with a link to it at the start of each HTML document.  </s>
<s> The navigation page could provide both an image map and a textual alternative.  </s>
<s> If navigation bars are used, they should be marked with class=navbar as Daniel suggests.  </s>
<s> Likewise, if the PRE element contains computer programme code rather than text in a natural language, this fact should also be marked for the benefit of braille and speech output software, perhaps as class="code".  </s>
<s> Standardised class values are an important component of accessible HTML document construction, since they will also enable the reading order of the document to be modified by the HTML user agent.  </s>
<s> This topic will presumably be discussed within the Protocols and Formats group.  </s>
<s> The BLOCKQUOTE element should only be used to mark genuine quotations, but not as a means of indenting text where no quotation is intended.  </s>
<s> This is probably discussed somewhere in the guidelines but I can't remember reading it in the latest version.  </s>

<s> I think using HTML's CODE element inside the PRE element would be better than reliance on classes in this case since CODE gives the structural information to all early browsers.  </s>
<s> Authors could use the CLASS attribute on CODE to indicate the kind of code, e.g., class="HTML" or class="Java".  </s>
