I have not reviewed the guidelines to establish where these checkpoints would best fit, but the following suggestions come to mind in respect of mathematical content: 1. 
When browsers provide support for viewing and processing it, use MathML to represent mathematical expressions occurring in a document. 
2. Until MathML is supported by browsers, images may be used to represent mathematical content, so long as alternative text providing an ASCII representation of the mathematics is supplied. 
In the Techniques document, an example could be given of the latter method, adopting the ASCII representation used in Donald E. Knuth's TeX typesetting system. 
Rationale: an ASCII version can be read by today's assistive technologies. 
Query whether there are characters in Unicode that could be used in ALT text to represent the mathematical symbols and whether these would provide a better interim solution (I suspect that they would not be supported by current assistive technologies and that we will need to fall back upon straightforward ASCII as mentioned above). 
The two proposed checkpoints are modeled on the provisions related to style sheets and the legacy problem associated with the use of tables for layout purposes. 
Make sure that the guidelines are written such that "ascii representation" of math does not get interpreted as ASCII art --that would be useless both now and in the future.

One question that I have been considering is whether to recommend a particular "ASCII representation" as an interim solution, and if so, which one. 
TeX is the obvious starting point: it is relatively well known and, as I understand it, largely unambiguous, but there may well be other possibilities. 
What we need is a kludge that will serve as an acceptable, albeit inadequate solution while we wait for software to be developed that can render MathML, both visually as well as in audio and braille media. 
This is definitely not my area of expertise, so perhaps I should not be commenting on it. 
you dont say ascii representation --you say markup notation e.g. TeX and leave it at that. 
TeX is the lingua franca of the mathematics community at this point.
