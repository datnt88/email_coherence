<s> Dear OWL-S developers, reading the OWL-S document, I found a few places, where a wording appearently did not reflect the semantics, as I had understood them from the text.  </s>
<s> 5.1.1  </s>
<s> Process * Preconditions and Effects The _output_ describes the actual event: that the amount of money in the credit card account has been reduced.  </s>
<s> In my opinion, this is just the difference between output and effect - the output is some information like the invoice, yet the reduction itself is the _effect_.  </s>
<s> 5.4 Composite Process Unordered X = (Sequence a b) Y = (Sequence c d) Z = (Unordered _A_ _B_) The example only makes sense, as far as I can see, if Z = (Unordered X Y)  </s>
<s> I hope you can find out whether I misunderstood, or your draft is incorrect in this matters.  </s>

<s> Yes, looks like a typo.  </s>
<s> Yep, nother typo.  </s>
<s> Nope. Good catches both.  </s>
<s> Cheers, Bijan Parsia.  </s>
<s> Thanks, Sebastian, and Bijan.  </s>
<s> I've just made these corrections in our source, and in the published HTML of the Tech.  </s>
<s> Overview.  </s>
<s> The PDF and PS forms will have to be updated later.  </s>
