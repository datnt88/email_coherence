This is the usual weekly call for agenda items for this weeks telecon. 
Currently, my list of possibles includes: o isDefinedBy semantics revisited o faq-html-compliance o approve test cases: Jan - do you have some you need reviewed? 
o WG comments on charmod WD o daml:collection o mime-types and W3C specs o rdfms-assertion o xml:base feedback o documents schedule Brian Datatypes: stake-in-ground vs simpledatatype2 [yeah, I know, slap me...] Patrick I regret that you weren't at the after hours conversation last week. 
I found it helpful, and thought Aaron's e-mail summarised what I learnt: While I continue to support simpledatatype2 I believe that the group should as much as possible concentrate on getting the current datatype stuff out to the community as a WD. 
As such, I would support the chair in stating that your agenda request is about an issue that is currently not open. 
Jeremy As do I. Aaron's comments may be true for some preceptions of DC, but other applications (actually, most of them, from what I've seen, including I think alot of common perception about DC as well) still take an untidy simpledatatypes2 view of things. 
In fact, I've been working for awhile on some RDF querying stuff that relies on the inline idiom being understood to "provide" a datatype value, and unfortunately since the present stake-in-ground proposal does not offer this (much to my disappointment and due to my own misunderstanding of the MT) I find myself in a position of being a co-editor of a specification that I myself will reject and not use for most of what I am using datatyped RDF for. 
So, clearly, I'm rather concerned. 
I agree. 
I didn't mean to imply that getting the present WD finished and out would be held up by discussing the concerns already raised about it by you, myself, Graham, etc. 
I don't know whether Pat or Sergey presently has the lock, but it's not me. 
But I'm also eager to see it get out to the public (both because it's well overdue, and because I expect that the issues already leveled against it will find support in the general RDF community). 
Still, I wonder whether it still reflects the true concensus of the WG... (i.e. would the WG still vote the way it did) Hmmmm... well, I consider datatypes to still be an open issue, or at least, to be an issue that still has problem areas and not "a done deal" so to speak. 
But I certainly will understand if Brian deems it to be inappropriate for tomorrow's aggenda. 
Cheers, Patrick
