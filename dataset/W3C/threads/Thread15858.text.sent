Is there a typo? 
Isn't "Dalmatian" spelled with an "o" . 
I have a dalmation and this kit is NOT everything you need to train a dalmation. 
Anyone who owns these wonderful spotted wonder (hyper ) dogs will tell you that you need "cookies." 
They ain't stupid and they refuse to listen unless there is a treat involved! 
They love human contact and really get upset and destructive if you leave them alone! 
It has taken ten years (and an unfortunate surgery, see http://www.neuticles.com/index.html/Tp10e.htm) 
to get him to calm down. 
Now he just throws pillows and, if the trash is down, will spread it through the house....need I say more. 
Sorry, its Friday and I couldn't resist!

Remember - no "O" in DalmatiAn" Please tell me you didn't spend money on neuticles! 
That would indeed be unfortunate. 
It is, however, fortunate that you did have him neutered! 
He should be, unless he is such a perect specimen that he could be used as part of a breeding program to improve the dalmatian breed.
