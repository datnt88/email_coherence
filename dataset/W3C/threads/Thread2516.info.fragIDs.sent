<s> [ appended ] The commentURL points to a resource which can be requested by a UA under a variety of circummstances, not just in conjunction with an assessment of whether to accept a new (not previously accepted or  </s>

<s> (e.g., tentatively) accepted cookie.  </s>
<s> A link for that URL might have been bookmarked, or added to some document.  </s>
<s> The server thus must be prepared to have Cookie headers in requests for those resources, and should act on them as it would for other requests sent by UAs.  </s>
<s> If you impose restrictions for such URLs, you are creating complications, not alleviating them.  </s>
<s> In those cases where the UA is sending the request in conjunction  </s>
<s> with an assessment of whether to accept a new cookie or delete an existing one, I still see no compelling reason to omit a Cookie header from the request, if there are cookies which the UA would normally send to that site.  </s>
<s> I also think it is desireable to send at least the cookie for which a comment is being requested, to ensure that at least one cookie is included in the request (That's a MAY, not a MUST.  </s>
<s> :) Such a cookie would have the modern format for UAs which have adopted the modern IETF specs.  </s>
<s> Consider, for example, the case for a host which does need to impose a port  </s>
<s> restriction.  </s>
<s> It's needs cannot be met by a blanket port restriction, as in the current RFC.  </s>
<s> The inclusion of a cookie with the modern format provides assurance to the server that the request comes from a modern UA, and that a document which is suitable for modern UAs can be returned.  </s>
<s> Otherwise, the server may elect to return a comment such as: WARNING: Your browser may have a historical implementation of  </s>
<s> cookie handling which inadequately protects your privacy and  </s>
<s> might result is transmissions of your cookies to inappropriate sites.  </s>
<s> See IETF RFC??? URL: ... for more information.  </s>
<s> A list of browsers with modern cookie support is available from URL: ... .  </s>
<s> Such browsers will enable you to derived the full benefit of services offered by our site.  </s>
<s> Of course, the WebMaster for the server might consider that particular message impolite, or risks cache busting.  </s>
<s> The point is that there are reasons why it would be good to allow exchanges of cookies in conjunction with the requests for commentURLs, and how they are handled is an "implementation issue" dependent on the context in which the UA issues the request.  </s>
<s> All that's needed is a word of caution about getting caught in a loop, and if you go too far beyond that at this time, it may turn out that you're added a bug rather than alleviated a problem.  </s>

<s> The reply to what?  </s>
<s> To the request for the CommentURL?  </s>
<s> The UA just needs to know if it should or should not accept a cookie that's been sent to it.  </s>
<s> The CommentURL allows the user to make an informed decision about whether they should or should not accept the cookie.  </s>
<s> The process of attaining this "decision making information" should be "sacred"... without cookies or sessions or anything... it should be anonymous, as though the browser does not have support for cookies, and it should not be something that will result in any cookies being accepted, rejected, or changed in any way, except for the one cookie that is in question, and the point of the whole process.  </s>
<s> Foteos Macrides:  </s>
<s> Parsing error, indeed.  </s>
<s> The server should not send any "new" cookies, meaning none that are not included in the UA's Cookie: header, and the UA should deal with the situation of a server doing so.  </s>
<s> However, if you get so heavy handed as to bar any cookie exchanges, that's like the blanket port restriction in the current RFC, with it's side effect of blocking all cookie sharing between http and https servers, including unencrypted cookies from an http server going encrypted to an https server.  </s>
<s> If you make it that heavy handed, even UAs which do want to implement the IETF specs are likely to respond with "Sorry, we're not going off the deep end with you."  </s>
<s> The folks arguing *for* CommentURL say it's a valuable feature and (I think they would claim) easy to implement.  </s>
<s> I agree that, at the bits-on-the-wire protocol level, it's simple to specify, but I've always been skeptical about the UA implications.  </s>
<s> I think Foteos's wording for how a UA should handle a cookie that it receives while examining a CommentURL page (not reproduced here) help to make my point.  </s>
<s> I think they're complex.  </s>
<s> Some of the disagreement results from differing visions of when/how a user could inspect a cookie.  </s>
<s> (And we must allow for that flexibility.) I imagined that the inspection would take place at the point where a cookie arrived, subsequent to a user's clicking on a link, and before some or all of the content has been received.  </s>
<s> In that circumstance, if the UA offers the user the opportunity to follow the CommentURL link for the cookie, I think it's inappropriate for the UA to send a cookie to the very server whose cookie policy the user is (presumably) about to examine, or to accept cookies from that server or others.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, if the cookie inspection mechanism is "off-line", in the sense that it functions when the UA is otherwise quiescent (no page retrieval taking place), then different rules may apply.  </s>
<s> The interrogation of the CommentURL could be treated similarly to retrieval of any other resource.  </s>
<s> I think a UA could (perhaps *should*) provide both mechanisms.  </s>
<s> The question is (assuming you agree with the two paragraphs above) how to word the spec.  </s>
<s> to restrict the first case and not the second.  </s>
<s> Dave Morris proposed:  </s>
<s> A potentially confusing situation exists if a user agent's cookie inspection interface allows a user to follow a CommentURL link within a dialog which is prompting the user to decide if the cookie containing the CommentURL is acceptable AND following the CommentURL link results in receipt of a new, not previously approved cookie.  </s>
<s> The useragent MAY discard any cookie received in this context in order to avoid the complexities of interacting with the user regarding nested set-cookie requests.  </s>
<s> Servers which depend on cookies MUST allow for the possibility that URLs used in their cookie's CommentURL value will be ignored by user agents.  </s>
<s> Well the technical issue has only received intense discussion for a day and there would seem to be convergence.  </s>
<s> The simple problem is that as a protocol design we are demanding that UI/UA designers provide a meaningful dialog with end-users for control of cookie usage in the interest of protecting user privacy.  </s>
<s> Without including the CommentURL we are not providing any way for the enduser  </s>
<s> and origin server to have a mutual understanding of how the cookie will be used.  </s>
<s> There is no way to require the server to provide the CommentURL or to provide a meaningful message but one might expect that users who bother to police their cookie transactions would be less inclined to accept cookies which don't have the CommentURL.  </s>
<s> As far as the accuracy of the CommentURL description is usage is concerned, I would speculate from a limited legal background that publishing a false statement could be the basis of legal action for false advertising,  </s>
<s> misrepresentation, etc.  </s>
<s> The difference between the Comment attribute and the CommentURL is the difference between the Windows application which provides a message box with a message like: "Unable to write bookmark file" and one which presents the message: "Unable to write bookmark file: C:\home\user\internet\bkmrks.fil because the file already exists and is owned by another user" In the first case, only a user familiar with the application internals could guess where to start looking.  </s>
<s> In the second case, the average reasonably knowledgable user of the operating system usage would have a good chance at successful problem resolution.  </s>
<s> If user privacy is important to our protocol effort, we must make it  </s>
<s> possible for the user to receive sufficient information for informed consent.  </s>
<s> If we don't, the user community will throw their hands up and take the course of least resistance and all of our concern about cookie sharing will be moot.  </s>
<s> In other words, I don't consider CommentURL as icing on the cookie, it is central to any possibility of achieving user control over privacy.  </s>
<s> Dave Morris  </s>
<s> The criteria by which a UA might accept particular cookies in Set-Cookie or Set-Cookie2 headers, and might include particular cookies in Cookie headers, are in the specification.  </s>
<s> There is no MUST for acceptance of cookies, nor for sending them.  </s>
<s> For a URL obtained via a commentURL, the UA could apply those criteria, and perhaps include cookies in a Cookie header when requesting that URL.  </s>
<s> It could apply those criteria, and perhaps accept cookies in any Set-Cookie or Set-Cookie2 header that accompanies the server's reply, all dependent on the context, the manner in which the UA has implemented cookie support, and any configuration or run-time options set by the user.  </s>
<s> There is nothing about the commentURL which requires holding up LAST CALL, unless you want to change the critera, rather than just making suggestions or adding words of caution in the comments/explanations.  </s>
<s> Just say yes.  </s>
<s> The FQDN issue is another matter.  </s>
<s> That's a change in the critera.  </s>
