<s> I'm not sure what's supposed to be there.  </s>
<s> Neither am I. It's an issue :-) The W3C Quality Assurance group is chartered to investigate a test point definition language.  </s>
<s> As long as such a framework is scaled up to the Web, it should be possible to integrate it neatly with EARL.  </s>
<s> As for the fragments, what you have there is a document that is in your own temporary language.  </s>
<s> EARL 0.95 does not provide information for identifying the type of a test case document.  </s>
<s> It does define a set of classes whose semantics are left for future interpretation by the group.  </s>
<s> One of these classes is the "TestCase" class, which has a predicate testId relating it to a test case file.  </s>
<s> This allows one to bundle a group of test case documents, test point specification, levels, and exclusions together - for example: all of the WCAG 1.0 priority 1 checkpoints except for 2.1.  </s>

<s> Sean, I completely disagree on this question.  </s>
<s> I think that what should happen if there are two reports made which conflict in their details is precisely what you have outlined below.  </s>
<s> The resource (the thing being tested) hasn't changed what it is, and nor has the EARL schema (probably).  </s>
<s> Some details may have changed, but most URIs do not have any guarantee that they remain byte-identical forever.  </s>
<s> It is a question for the client processor what to do about conflicting statements - a generating tool just produces those statements.  </s>
<s> If a web page is not accessible on tuesday, and is accessible on thursday, then it is up to a client to interpret the results and decide that if the same person makes confliting claims, the best resolution is to accept which set of claims has the latest date attached.  </s>
<s> (This is not new.  </s>
<s> It is like the CSS cascade, and like principles of applying law that have been around for hundreds of years).  </s>
<s> Alternatively, a client can make the decisions on the author, if there is more than one and they differ.  </s>
<s> Or ask the user to tell it how to decide in this case.  </s>
<s> Or point out that there are differing opinions.  </s>
<s> None of these things will happen if you invent a new namespace for the thing being tested each time you run a test - it is important that it has the same  </s>
<s> URI if it is the same thing.  </s>
<s> (otherwise we end up in the urn rathole - urns are a great idea, but the only way to find them is to define a urn- URI mapping, at which point it makes more sense to have some rdf using uris and be done with it...) cheers Chaals  </s>

<s> Well, some bits hold and some bits don't - and it also depends upon the type of query.  </s>
<s> For example, you can reduce a bit of EARL so that it loses all of the context info using a filter/rule.  </s>
<s> In my previous email, I reduced the statements from the following evaluations:- [ earl:asserts [ rdf:subject [ rdf:type earl:WebContent; earl:reprOf http://www.w3.org/blargh ; earl:date "2001-10-15" ]; rdf:predicate earl:fails; rdf:object :MyTest ] ] .  </s>
<s> [ earl:asserts [ rdf:subject [ rdf:type earl:WebContent; earl:reprOf http://www.w3.org/blargh ; earl:date "2001-10-17" ]; rdf:predicate earl:passes; # typo in original rdf:object :MyTest ] ] .  </s>
<s> RDF Core seem to be in the process of deciding that one reified statement is not necessarily the same as another, even with the same subject, predicate, and object.  </s>
<s> That's consistent with the way in which I reduced the statements - it's intutive, and it works well with EARL.  </s>
<s> Of course, we don't actually reify all of the statements in the model.  </s>
<s> We only reify the actual earl:Assertion itself, because it's all that we need to reify; the others are objective truths, whereas an earl:Assertion is subjective, and varies from tool to tool.  </s>
<s> This method has been up in the air for some time now, but no one seems to have challenged it, modulo DanBri's hypertext-in-RDF idea.  </s>
<s> I'd certainly like some discussion of the model - which I've been pondering for some time now - by the group, although everybody seemed happy with it from day one.  </s>
<s> In fact [credit where credit's due], the model came after an entire weekend of work, and hours of discussions with Aaron Swartz - in which he proposed [1] the model that we had in EARL 0.9.  </s>
<s> The model in EARL 0.95 is basically the same, except that the predicate and object in the assertion are swapped around since it seems to make a little more sense that way.  </s>
<s> I can recall discussing the "only reify the Assertion" idea before somewhere, but it's pretty difficult to find specific discussions on the list.  </s>
<s> It's a bit sad that 90% of the design rationale for EARL is in the lists... ugh.  </s>
<s> Then again, at least it's all archived.  </s>
