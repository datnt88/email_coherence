Hi, 
Could someone at the Consortium offices give a reset to the test results page for OWL implementations 
(http://www.w3.org/2003/08/owl-systems/test-results-out). 
Trying to 
get a re-generation to occur, and its failing on re-importing the RDF 
files from the different implementers. 
Thanks, Jack Jack Berkowitz Vice President, Engineering Network Inference, Inc jack.berkowitz@networkinference.com 
Actually, it's run manually, so it needed a different kind of kick. 
The "manual regeneration" is just to view a private copy. 
I've run it; let me know if the results are as you expect. 
I see the Bossam and Jena feeds have gone 404. 
I'll run it again in a few days and see if they've come back.

Hi, Bossam feed is now on-line again, which is at Best, Minsu

Sandro, Still "No Joy". 
Clicking the regeneration button from here yields: / Page generation progress report . 
/ loading http://www.mindswap.org/2003/pellet/results.rdf .

We are just wanting to check the results for our upcoming release! 
thanks, Jack 
Oh, I thought you wanted the main page regenerated. 
For doing a custom page, if it's hanging on mindswap, just remove mindswap from the text-form of sources to include. 
You might want to removed everything but the test-manifest itself.
