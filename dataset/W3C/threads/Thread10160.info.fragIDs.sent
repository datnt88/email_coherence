8: Book Review Shelly Powers is finishing off a book and is seeking volunteers to help review it. 
She is particularly concerned about the chapter on reification. 
See: 9: LBase Document Propose approve publication as a note. 
See: 
10: Literal Abstract Syntax Questions arising: 
o Are datatypes restricted to XSD datatypes? 
o Do typed literals have a language identifier? 
o Does the abstract syntax require a datatype URI to refer to a datatype and that the lexical form be from the lexical space of that datatype o should a parser barf if it sees a datatype for which it cannot validate that strings are from that datatypes value space and for which it cannot compute the lexical to value mapping o is there a generic value entailment in the model theory: a b dt1 "foo" . 
entails c d dt2 "bar" . 
whenever dt1.value("foo") = dt2.value(bar)? 
o The n-triples form: a b dt1 "foo" . 
requires further parser lookahead than say: a b "foo" dt1 . 
The latter is easier to parse.

Oh! yeah verily. 
TimBL and I were just discussing that the other day... Granted, n-triples is only informally related to N3, but we do have some relevant implementation experience, and it would be nice to build on it. 
We haven't finished coding up the details, but he proposed "foo"^^ dt1 . 
because it harks to his "path" shortcut for [ dt1 "foo"], namely "foo"^ dt1 . 
We're not particular about ^^ vs some other delimiter, but having the dt1 come after the "foo" makes life much easier for implementation in cwm. 
Paths These are just shorthand. 
x!p means [ is p of x ] in the above annonymous node notaion. 
You can read it as "x's p". 
This is a liitle remiiscent o f the "." in object oriented programming "object.slot" 
syntax. 
The reverse traversal, x^p means [ p x ] . 
For either forward or backward traversal, p is a property, and x can be a whole path with both ! 
and ^ in it. 
Any path with at least one traversal is anonymous. 
Example: :joe!fam:mother!loc:office!loc:zip Joe's mother's office's zipcode :joe!fam:mother^fam:mother Anyone whose mother is Joe's mother.

FYI, I've sent a brief message to CC/PP WG list noting the decision made, and what I think will be the level of impact on CC/PP.

I believe the 2002-10-10 concepts document [1] covers 1.1 (what is...?), 2.2 (mapping) and 2.3 (typed literals). 
I have not included material from 1.2 (desiderata) because I don't see how it fits or helps in the revised document structure: I think it was useful to guide us during development of datatyping issues, but now we've got to where we are I really don't think it will further enlighten readers in any important way.

I volunteer for next week (last week I thought that I would miss this week's telecon because of sea side holidays, but we leave right after the telecon) 
this one was/is still discussed in WebOnt but it seems getting a happy end with Ian Horrock's message 
I will try DanC's response "foo"whatever dt1 . 
later tonight Jos De Roo, AGFA http://www.agfa.com/w3c/jdroo/ 
I missed out: o Are old style literals untyped or do we give them a type, if so what type? 
Brian 
On the semantics issues, which I don't honestly expect we will reach, can I suggest we also add rdf:List semantics into the pile of things to discuss, see: I would like us to reach consensus on list semantics before the next MT WD. 
I also have a Webont action that I can't progress until RDFCore makes a decision here.

Belated regrets for this morning's telecon due to the DAML PI Meeting.
