<s> o Are datatypes restricted to XSD datatypes?  </s>
<s> o Do typed literals have a language identifier?  </s>
<s> o Does the abstract syntax require a datatype URI to refer to a datatype and that the lexical form be from the lexical space of that datatype o should a parser barf if it sees a datatype for which it cannot validate that strings are from that datatypes value space and for which it cannot compute the lexical to value mapping o is there a generic value entailment in the model theory: a b dt1 "foo" .  </s>
