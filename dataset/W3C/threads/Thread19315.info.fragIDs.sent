I am attempting to compile the lastest Amaya source distribution for 
Linux on the PowerPC architecture. 
The configure script (invoked with no argumnents) produces this warning: 
configure: warning: Thot editor sources not found 
but finishes with this hopeful message: Amaya package is now configured Amaya configured with libWWW Amaya configured with Math support Amaya configured with Graph support So I attempted to "make all." 
The compilation produces a few warnings but they do not appear to be serious. 
However, the compiling stops when it reaches this point: ==== rescandialogue is done make[1]: Leaving directory `/home/hajhouse/prog/src/amaya/Amaya/batch' make[1]: Entering directory `/home/hajhouse/prog/src/amaya/Amaya/amaya' Makefile:62: .depends:

Make finally gives up with this error: System wide unix-thot.rc

These errors are very puzzling to me since I followed the compiling instructions exactly on a freshly unpacked source tree from the official tarball. 
Thank you.

Hi Henry, 
I guess you only forgot to create the object sub-directory as explained in You have to launch the configure process in that sub-directory "../configure" 
Irene. 
In-reply-to: Your message of Tue, 18 Jan 2000 18:39:17 -0800." 
Yes, how silly of me! 
That definately explains my problems. 
After re-reading the instructions, the source tree compiled without problems. 
Thanks! -- Henry House 
I've been having similar problems because I didn't understand those instructions on the web page, either. 
The wording you just used is clearer, Irene. 
I should've figured it out from the '../configure' command but I guess I read that as './configure' Jeff
