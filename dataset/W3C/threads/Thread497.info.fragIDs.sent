<s> Hello, I've encountered the same problem with Tidy, using Tomcat 4.0.1, Sun's Jdk 1.3, and Microsoft JVMs.  </s>
<s> I extracted sources files from jtidy-04aug2000r6.zip and compiled them with Sun's Jdk 1.3 ; then, I rebuilt a Tidy.jar  </s>
<s> It works !  </s>

<s> Anyone working with Tidy and vb/asp.  </s>
<s> Is it just to download the code from the tidy4aug00.tgz and recompile it as a COM? then register it and use it in the code?  </s>
<s> Or is there a special process.  </s>
<s> Have you looked at TidyCOM?  </s>

<s> Seen it, but it worries me that it is over 1 year old.  </s>
<s> cheers, Howard  </s>
