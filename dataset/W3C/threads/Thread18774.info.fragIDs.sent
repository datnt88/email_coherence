[I'm still collecting action item assignments - report to come out soon - there are still some opened, so don't be shy!] We've been discussing internally whether or not the W3C logo (http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Icons/WWW/w3c_home.gif), as used in example, should be marked with ALT text "W3C", or "W3C logo". 
What do people think ? 
Use "W3C logo". 
It is specific, without suggesting more than is actually there. 
My understanding of ALT strings is they should be minimal without misleading. 
Note example of the ALT="NCAM access logo".

Subject: ALT content question We've been discussing internally whether or not the W3C logo (http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Icons/WWW/w3c_home.gif), as used in example, should be marked with ALT text "W3C", or "W3C logo". 
They are both inappropriate. 
The ALT text should be W3C Projects Status 
or more briefly Projects Status To explain: This particular link is a bottom-of-page synonym for the "top" link. 
It is offering you the function "move to the root within [some scope]" The appropriate ALT text is the external title of [some scope]. 
The "home" connotation of the icon is, as it is used in this context, more important than the "W3C" branding. 
But you don't want to label this link just "home." 
It is better, since there are multiple values of "home" depending on the degree of locality or globality of focus, to explicitly identify the scope that this link takes you "home" within. 
The anchor content should advise you what is at the far end of the link. 
If this image were not the content of a link, but used to frame the signature section of the page, the ALT text is better "W3C" and not "W3C logo" if the browser is Lynx. 
In Netscape with the graphics turned off, I might prefer "W3C logo." 
In speech, ...?

and 
Shouldn't the TITLE attribute convey the information about the 
destination of a link ? 
I'd rather separate the meaning of the image from the meaning of its application in a particular context using different attributes. 
e.g is one thing and (TITLE is now a core attributes in Cougar but was in A since day one) 
You realize of course that it's better not to depend on a particular browser, but could explain why one is better in one context.

I have only tried two, by I have yet to find a browser that does anything useful with the TITLE if it is annotated onto this anchor in the HTML. 
This raises the question: "For the purposes of what timeframe are you asking? 
Now or in the ideal future we want to migrate toward?" 
In what follows I will try to separate responses related to a) best workaround now and b) framing requirements for a better solution. 
I'd rather separate the meaning of the image from the meaning of its application in a particular context using different attributes. 
e.g is one thing and (TITLE is now a core attributes in Cougar but was in A since day one) It would appear from my cursory examination to be an un-implemented attribute. 
In the here and now, you only get one shot. 
The priority [which is use-based] of informing the user where they are about to go is higher than the priority of describing the image. 
[sorry, image.] 
Given the currently deployed client behavior [range] the best workaround now is to use the ALT tag for an alternative anchor content (like its acronymous name) and not for a descripiton of the image. 
In terms of framing the context for a solution, I 100% agree that the model of the process has to distinguish three things: 1 - the a_priori characteristics of the resource 2 - the a_posteriori characteristics of the local substructure created by the use of the resource 3 - the tailoring information which must be applied in the invocation operator so as to transform 1 into 2. On the other hand, it is premature to think we know what subset of this information wants to be in HTML and what wants to be accessed by more HTTP. 
Please return to my "percolation" white paper starting at http://www.access.digex.net/%7Easgilman/web-access/announce-two.html for an introduction to how there is a tradeoff between data and action solutions to this need. 
You realize of course that it's better not to depend on a particular browser, but could explain why one is better in one context. 
For the long term, I am in 110% agreement with this point. 
I could have said 80X24:For a browse where the display medium is 24 rows of 80 monospaced characters each VGA16:For a browse where the display medium is a graphical slate of minimum 640X480 pixels each capable of at least 16 colours. 
But in order to be brief in email I said "Lynx" and "Netscape" instead. 
For the purposes of here-and-now guidelines it is absolutely necessary to deal with the demographics of browser behavior for the browsers (including versions, sigh) in the field now. 
It is hard to discuss what "should" be in terms of this example, because a more use-related image "should" appear as the content of this link, if a link is needed. 
More likely, the need to identify the corporate author is more important than the need to provide yet another link to the top of the presentation. 
Assuming that that is the basis for using this image, it belongs in the GUI presentation of the file. 
Independent of use, this image has a variety of text descriptions: Text content: W3C Title: W3C logo Description: The W3C acronym displayed in a box. 
Capital W and numeral 3 are in one colour and Capital C is in another as a allusion to _the derivation of the acronym_. 
Here I have surrounded with underscores text which should be an hyperlink to an explanation of the derivation of the acronym. 
Note the emergence of requirements for HTML in descriptions. 
Descriptions for sensitive maps should also embed all the links in the map. 
To return to "how to meet the need represented by the use:" What I haven't got across well enough yet is how little is lost if the presence of this image is entirely hidden in the 80X24 and particularly non-visual browse. 
Suppose that browsers did display the TITLE tag in a way that would replace the image as the content of the anchor. 
Then for 80X25 and pure audio browsing, the preferred ALT text would be ALT="" i.e. hide it entirely. 
The slide bearing this example image and link is full of pro-forma navigation aids. 
As the size of the display pipe goes down, more and more of this infrastructure wants to migrate into implicit information displayed only on explicit request and not be presented in the default "display" view. 
Appropriate accomodation of browsing is not just changing or stripping fonts. 
The focus or viewframe is going to be scoped differently, as well. 
Not only breadth of topic but in depth of detail, as well. 
One way is for the content form to contain priorities and the preferences to play off the priorities to prune the data presented. 
That is what this slide would take to morph it gracefully all the way to audio. 
The navigation buttons would not turn into presented audio but be aliased to standard navigation commands. 
The more we expand the data model, the more important it is to understand that there will want to be filter-driven hiding on the way to the non-visual browse display. 
What do you think, Mark? 
Am I in the ballpark?
