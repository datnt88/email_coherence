<s> Resent-From: www-rdf-interest@w3.org Resent-Date: Fri, 8 Aug 2003 16:34:21 -0400 (EDT) Hi, I am trying to use the NTC utility at files but it doesn't seem to like me.  </s>
<s> I built it and it keeps saying that the files dont match even when they do.  </s>
<s> Maybe I don't understand how its supposed to work.  </s>
<s> I am just trying the samples (First.001,  </s>
<s> Second.002 etc etc) with the utility and this is what I am getting.  </s>
<s> Any help will be apprecaited before I start wading through the code.  </s>
<s> ntc -d Second.001  </s>
<s> First.001  </s>
<s> First model read: Dump of model.  </s>
<s> Static triples: foo:bar random:p2 "hoho" .  </s>
<s> foo:bar random:p1 o1 .  </s>
<s> Anonymous triples: Done.  </s>
<s> Second model read: Dump of model.  </s>
<s> Static triples: Anonymous triples: Done.  </s>
<s> Comparing models: Non-anonymous statement sets of different size They don't match It doesn't seem to be reading the second model.  </s>

<s> GHC will compile it to a stand-alone executable (tested on Windows, should work on Linux/Unix).  </s>
