Folks, Is there an object model diagram or IDL for the most recent Delta-V protocol specification that you are aware of? 
If there is one, could you point me to it. 
There was such a thing a long time ago that Jim A produced I think. 
Thanks Sankar I did post a new model diagram to the web site a few weeks ago, but it still needs to be fleshed out with details. 
Let me know if you have any trouble reading it.

Thanks Sankar Any chance you could produce IDL from the Rose model you're using or make the Rose model available for the WebDAV object model?
