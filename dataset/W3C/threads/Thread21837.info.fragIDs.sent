<s> Hi Dan, Thanks for the update!  </s>
<s> Note that I'm cc'ing Lisa Dusseault, Co-Chair of the WebDAV WG (and, incidentally, author of a book on WebDAV soon to be published by Prentice-Hall).  </s>
<s> In the WebDAV community, we've recently started a discussion on what the future of DASL should be.  </s>
<s> There seems to be some consensus around shipping the current specification more or less as-is, since it's quite useful for searching unstructured DAV properties (that is, it provides a good way to perform SQL-like queries on properties that map well to single relational DB cells).  </s>
<s> While this isn't as general a protocol as I might like, in practice it's pretty useful.  </s>
<s> There are multiple interoperabile implementations of DASL currently in existence, so we'll likely go to Proposed with the current specification, though there is some discussion of going to Experimental.  </s>
<s> Follow-on efforts for this protocol are likely to go in the direction of adding data typing to DAV properties to permit better handling of user-defined ("dead") properties (i.e., properties where the underlying relational database doesn't know how to assign a RDBMS type).  </s>
<s> This will improve handling of conditionals, sort ordering, etc.  </s>
<s> More discussion on typing of DAV properties can be found in a recent paper of mine, "The WebDAV Property Design":  </s>
<s> One question we're not likely to address in the WebDAV WG is how to remotely perform XML and RDF queries.  </s>
<s> The DASL architecture is quite open -- a request is a SEARCH verb, followed by a query specification in the request body.  </s>
<s> This request body, if formulated correctly, could probably be used with either SOAP marshalling or the SEARCH verb.  </s>
<s> So, the open question is how to marshall XML and RDF queries that are executed over a network, either  </s>
<s> in the presence of resources that have DAV properties, or not (ideally the protocol should handle both cases).  </s>
<s> IMO, this question has greater relevance to the W3C community than the DAV community, and I'd be interested in moving consideration of this issue to an appropriate W3C venue, of course subject to the typical concerns of whether it's an appropriate W3C activity, if the W3C members are interested, etc. - Jim  </s>
<s> I think there are two separate questions here... one is about RDF and one is about XML.  </s>
<s> Although RDF can be serialized in XML, the sorts of queries people are doing today with RDF query languages are over the abstract graph, not over the XML representation.  </s>
<s> For XML documents, and resources that present themselves as XML, one might reasonably consider using XML Query.  </s>
<s> It turns out there are lots of fairly complex things one might reasonably want to ask about the contents of XML Documents, so perhaps it's not surprising that XML Query is a rather large specification.  </s>
<s> I wouldn't expect all DAV implementations to support it, even in XML environments.  </s>
<s> So maybe this is an area where technical experimentation is needed before any standardization is considered.  </s>
<s> We could go to the XML Query Working Group and see if there is consensus on any such technical work; my personal expectation is that they are too busy right now to focus on such issues, just because of where they are in their editing cycle, but that this may well change by January.  </s>
<s> I can't comment on the RDF aspects.  </s>
<s> best, Liam Quin, XML Activity Lead, W3C Liam Quin, W3C XML Activity Lead, liam at w3.org, http://www.w3.org/People/Quin/  </s>
<s> Agreed.  </s>
<s> XQuery certainly would be my choice for XML query language.  </s>
<s> But, even once you've settled on XQuery, there are a number of protocol issues that would need to be addressed.  </s>
<s> For example, can clients ask that responses not exceed a particular size?  </s>
<s> Are query responses resources, with a URI, and how long can that URI be dereferenced?  </s>
<s> How should query errors be passed back to the client?  </s>
<s> True, although there is a growing class of DAV servers that sit on top of XML databases, and so are interested in this capability.  </s>
<s> Never hurts.  </s>
<s> I'm seeing some experimentation among DASL implementors already.  </s>
<s> This timeframe is probably right on.  </s>
<s> I think if things got rolling early to middle of next year, that would be fine.  </s>
<s> Inaction on this does have opportunity costs, but they're still fairly low.  </s>
<s> - Jim  </s>
