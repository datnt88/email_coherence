Hi, I would like two see two simple commands into amaya: - a comment/uncomment element item wich places the selection in comment or remove the comment - remove the englobing element. 
This would allow to avoid going in the source view to remove a div around an element.

You have to select the englobing element and to use the "transform" command (Edit menu).

The first command also exists, but it is normally only available in the structure view. 
You would have to add the structures menu to the foramtted view. 
This is probably a reasonable idea anyway, although it becomes a question of how to make it work. 
Maybe like the annotations interface, where adding content is done by opening a dialogue...
