<s> - what are these?  </s>

<s> - Would they all be operable from keyboard?  </s>
<s> I think this is important.  </s>
<s> There has been some discussion in the User agent  </s>
<s> group about how to use DOM 2 to provide device independent handlers - essentially the user agent decides what triggers to give, and can be configured.  </s>
<s> character input is one approach to triggering them, mouse/keyboard commands and menus is another.  </s>
<s> 2.Operable from Keyboard - assumes all devices have a keyboard?  </s>
<s> - what keys on keyboard?  </s>
<s> (function keys too)?  </s>
<s> This is too general (what keys, is there a keydown/keyup function?  </s>

<s> response: Yes, I mean that it should be possible to use an onscreen keyboard (as is  </s>
<s> done in kiosk type environments in some cases).  </s>
<s> The point is that most users  </s>
<s> now prefer to use a mouse, and in some situations (such as the EIAD browser  </s>
<s> designed for people with brain injuries) rely on a touch screen.  </s>
<s> Using the keyboard to move around requires an abstraction of navigation.  </s>

<s> Though I haven't arrived at a satisfactory solution, I do have some ideas to share.  </s>
<s> 1.  </s>
<s> The requirement under checkpoint 2.1 should not forbid the use of certain kinds of device-specific event handling.  </s>
<s> Rather, it should insist that the web content ought not to rely on them in order to be operable.  </s>
<s> 2. Text input is, I think, a reasonable expectation.  </s>
<s> It isn't possible to design, for example, a large data base with a search facility that doesn't rely on text entry.  </s>
<s> We could however add a suggestion that alternatives to text entry be provided; actually I think this is already mentioned under the "handling of input errors" checkpoint, or at least used to be. 3. The problem is: how to define the kinds of input processing that we want to allow, without confining ourselves to implementation-specific scenarios which have undesired implications, or unduly restricting the range of implementation choices.  </s>
<s> The fundamental idea, I think, is that preference should be given to methods of input handling which can be characterized as logical actions within an application context, rather than as events which reflect the physical state of the input device.  </s>
<s> A clear example of the latter is an event which takes the coordinates of a pointing device as parameter.  </s>
<s> 4. In general terms, then, the success criteria are as follows: a.  </s>
<s> Where the implementation technology provides logically defined events, ensure that the web application can be operated entirely using these events.  </s>
<s> b.  </s>
<s> Where the implementation technology provides only device-dependent events (that is, events which are described in terms of the state of specific input devices) provide parallel, redundant implementations of the input mechanism so that it can be operated entirely from each type of input device for which events are defined.  </s>
<s> Exception: support to enable pointing devices to perform character input is typically provided by assistive technologies and need not be supplied by the application itself.  </s>
<s> This is a very rough initial proposal.  </s>
<s> Improvements are welcome, as is a draft of what would become the actual checkpoint.  </s>
<s> The exception at the end of the previous paragraph is somewhat anomalous and could be refined further.  </s>
