<s> HTML4.0 specifies several events that can be used to trigger scripts.  </s>
<s> Some are logical: onload, onunload, onfocus, onblur, onsubmit, onreset, onselect, onchange Some are input device specific onclick, ondblclick, onmousedown, onmouseup, onmouseover, onmousemove, onmouseout, onkeypress, onkeydown, onkeyup Our proposal for future versions of HTML (e.g. XHTML) is to mark this second set deprecated and to replace it with the following equivalents: onactivate (for onclick, onkeypress) onsuperactivate (for ondblclick, onkeypress+mod) onarm (for onmousedown, onkeydown) ondisam (for onmouseup, onkeyup) onfocus (for onmouseover) onblur (for onmouseout) onmousemove (since there's no clear device independent equivalent of onmousemove, so we could keep it in with a warning mentioning this, and suggesting that only decorative effects be triggered this way) The real work behind this change needs to happen in User Agents land.  </s>
<s> In particular, there is an interim period where UA needs to treat equivalent events the same way, e.g. if a page has an onclick init, the UA should allow a trigger using onkeypress, if onmouseout is used, keyboard traversal and onblur should trigger the script too, etc.  </s>
<s> A related feature I've been thinking about is a new attribute on the SCRIPT element to indicate if the script is purely decorative/visual or not.  </s>
<s> This would allow UA to ignore most of the script at the end of onfocus (e.g. onmouseover), onarm, etc.  </s>
<s> I would agree that supporting device independent input would include supporting keyboard input for control.  </s>
<s> However, I think that the techniques document would have to specifically address keyboard and ASCII code for control of all functionality.  </s>
