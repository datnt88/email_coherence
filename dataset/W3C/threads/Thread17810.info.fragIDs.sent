Will the onfocus work with a keyboard directed focus change (tab key). 
For example, web page with pull down menus. 
Currently moving focus with the keyboard does not cause the menu to pull down. 
There is also a need for keyboard navigation of menus and activation of selection once they are pulled down. 
I don't know if it will, but that's what we should be asking for in UA guidelines: keyboard access to all elements otherwise operatable my a mouse (including pulldown) -----Original Message----- Daniel,

Here is my current take on that, based on discussion on the list with Charles and others. 
HTML4.0 specifies several events that can be used to trigger scripts. 
Some are logical: onload, onunload, onfocus, onblur, onsubmit, onreset, onselect, onchange Some are input device specific onclick, ondblclick, onmousedown, onmouseup, onmouseover, onmousemove, onmouseout, onkeypress, onkeydown, onkeyup Our proposal for future versions of HTML (e.g. XHTML) is to mark this second set deprecated and to replace it with the following equivalents: onactivate (for onclick, onkeypress) onsuperactivate (for ondblclick, onkeypress+mod) onarm (for onmousedown, onkeydown) ondisam (for onmouseup, onkeyup) onfocus (for onmouseover) onblur (for onmouseout) onmousemove (since there's no clear device independent equivalent of onmousemove, so we could keep it in with a warning mentioning this, and suggesting that only decorative effects be triggered this way) The real work behind this change needs to happen in User Agents land. 
In particular, there is an interim period where UA needs to treat equivalent events the same way, e.g. if a page has an onclick init, the UA should allow a trigger using onkeypress, if onmouseout is used, keyboard traversal and onblur should trigger the script too, etc. 
A related feature I've been thinking about is a new attribute on the SCRIPT element to indicate if the script is purely decorative/visual or not. 
This would allow UA to ignore most of the script at the end of onfocus (e.g. onmouseover), onarm, etc. 
I would agree that supporting device independent input would include supporting keyboard input for control. 
However, I think that the techniques document would have to specifically address keyboard and ASCII code for control of all functionality.

Actually, for a voice-input system there are some extra constraints which can arise. 
It seems to me that device independence is the P1 requirement, and keyboard access is a good way of doing it most of the time. 
Specific keyboard access may be a P2 requirement in its own right - I am not sure. 
Remember that a 108-key keyboard is not universal either.

REFERENCE DOCUMENT: I would offer that this scenario is covered by checkpoint 4.2.1 [Priority 1]: Ensure that all functionalities offered by the user agent interface are available through all supported input devices. 
These include the installation procedure, access to documentation, and software configuration. 
Activating a menu (be it in the document or in the tool) I think is part of the user interface functionality. 
I think your example illustrates one particular need well and would be useful as an example. 
I therefore propose that we don't add a checkpoint but that we add the example to the document.
