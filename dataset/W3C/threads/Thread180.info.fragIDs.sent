<s> Could Tidy be made to automatically "clean" (FONTs to CSS) if the Strict DOCTYPE is requested?  </s>
<s> An HTML or XHTML Strict document can't have FONT tags according to the DTDs.  </s>

<s> An interesting idea.  </s>
<s> Since people often use font tags in place of headings, this isn't such a straightforward thing to do.  </s>
<s> One idea would be to set the clean option automatically if the strict doctype was requested.  </s>

<s> That would be ideal -- have the Strict doctypes automatically invoke "clean" (and have "drop-font-tags" automatically invoke it too -- since "clean" must currently be separately specified for "drop-font-tags" to work).  </s>
