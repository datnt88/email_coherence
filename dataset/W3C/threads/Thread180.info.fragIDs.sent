Could Tidy be made to automatically "clean" (FONTs to CSS) if the Strict DOCTYPE is requested? 
An HTML or XHTML Strict document can't have FONT tags according to the DTDs.

An interesting idea. 
Since people often use font tags in place of headings, this isn't such a straightforward thing to do. 
One idea would be to set the clean option automatically if the strict doctype was requested.

That would be ideal -- have the Strict doctypes automatically invoke "clean" (and have "drop-font-tags" automatically invoke it too -- since "clean" must currently be separately specified for "drop-font-tags" to work).
