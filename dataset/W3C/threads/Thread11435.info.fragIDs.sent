<s> I've translated the "XML in 10 points" to Indonesian language, and I have posted it to http://www.xml.or.id/w3c/xml10poin.html  </s>

<s> Hello Junaidi,  </s>
<s> Many thanks for your translations.  </s>
<s> You need to ask explicitly for permission to translate that, because it is not a W3C specification.  </s>
<s> I do not expect any problems once your request comes in.  </s>
<s> Please tell us when you are done.  </s>

<s> You're welcome!  </s>

<s> I've done now.  </s>
<s> It's in http://www.xml.or.id/w3c/xml-spec.html  </s>
<s> Maybe you can add a link in translation page of XML 1.0 in W3C site.  </s>
<s> Thank you very much!  </s>
