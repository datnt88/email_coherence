I've translated the "XML in 10 points" to Indonesian language, and I have posted it to http://www.xml.or.id/w3c/xml10poin.html 
This translation is dedicated to all Indonesian XML community. 
I also just started translating "Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0 (Second Edition)" from http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/REC-xml-20001006. 
I will post it in the sama site, too.

Hello Junaidi, 
Many thanks for your translations. 
You need to ask explicitly for permission to translate that, because it is not a W3C specification. 
I do not expect any problems once your request comes in. 
Please tell us when you are done. 
Regards, Martin. 
You're welcome! 
I've already had a permission from Mr. Bert Bos when I wrote my previous letter. 
I've done now. 
It's in http://www.xml.or.id/w3c/xml-spec.html 
Maybe you can add a link in translation page of XML 1.0 in W3C site. 
Thank you very much!

I would like to keep in that. 
Or aftertransilation if you wanto keep on w3.org i can send that page to you.

Soon after I finished and published "Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0 (Second Edition)" translation to http://www.xml.or.id/w3c/xml-spec.html, 
I translated "Namespaces in XML" from accessed at http://www.xml.or.id/w3c/xml-ns.html. 
I hope that these translations can be linked from W3C translation pages, so any Indonesian visitor can easily find the translations of these specs. 
Thank you very much. 
Sincerely, Junaidi Kurniawan
