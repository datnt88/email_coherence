<s> Hi, A question I keep running into is whether forms are accessible or not.  </s>
<s> Some aspects to take in consideration are: 1.  </s>
<s> If some blind computer users can access forms, are they accessible?  </s>
<s> 2. If a person has a preferred screen reader which doesn't work with forms, are they accessible?  </s>
<s> 3. If it takes blind computer users three times longer to use forms than sighted users, are forms accessible?  </s>
<s> 4. If blind users make more errors using forms than sighted users, are forms accessible?  </s>
<s> If forms are not considered accessible, what are the implications for all those applications which let users interact with online databases?  </s>
<s> Are all these applications inaccessible if forms are the only interface provided?  </s>
<s> Does this mean that for online systems, non-form based interfaces must also be provided?  </s>
<s> If forms are considered inaccessible, what are the implications under 504, 508, ADA etc? Scott  </s>
<s> The HTML 4.0 draft allows labels and keyboard commands to be associated with each item in a form.  </s>
<s> The WAI HC working group has also proposed an important enhancement to the SELECT element, whereby options can be grouped into hierarchically organised lists.  </s>
<s> If all of these features are widely used by authors and supported in braille and speech-based HTML software, there should be no further accessibility problems with respect to forms.  </s>
<s> At present, I use Lynx version 2.7.1 and have not encountered any access barriers related to forms.  </s>
<s> Some of them are slow and cumbersome to complete, and I hope this shortcoming will be resolved by (1) the ability to select items in a form by way of keyboard commands; and (2) the hierarchical grouping of options as proposed by the WAI.  </s>
<s> Hi Scot!  </s>
<s> At different times in my life, I might give different answers to this question, but let's consider a couple of things.  </s>
<s> I may be stating the obvious here, but please bear with me.  </s>
<s> Forms are variably accessible depending on 1 the product, and 2 the reciever.  </s>
<s> the product is the form and what has generated it. the reciever is the "browser" if you will and the interface to it.  </s>
<s> these interact with each other in subtle ways and a number of mixes emmerge.  </s>
<s> The purest deffinition for access in this case is can a form be read, comprehended and compleeted by anyone who has the mental cpacity to do so. the best way to insure this as far as I can tell is to make the form a simple fill in the blank rather than having buttons which imply and require the application of something on the recievers end which may or may not be present.  </s>
<s> I hope this answers your enquiry or at least takes us in an appropriate direction.  </s>
<s> I tell people not to redesign their forms, just provide an alternate means of access to them so that they may be serviced.  </s>
<s> for instance, can I email my response or quiry?  </s>
<s> can I phone it in or mail it in?  </s>
<s> cn I ask for a form in email which is structured differently but provides the same data?  </s>
<s> Thanks!  </s>

<s> A couple of thoughts on Scott's question of when forms are accessible.  </s>
<s> I think the question needs to be "how accessible" rather than "accessible yes or no".  </s>
<s> One factor is how many people are affected.  </s>
<s> For example, if a page is not accessible with Explorer and Jaws but is accessible with other software (e.g. Lynx and JAWS, or pwWebSpeak) the "degree of accessibility" depends on statistics how many people use Explorer.  </s>
<s> Of course, we don't want to ignore a rarely used setup if it is essential to a particular group of people, e.g. Braille by people who are deaf and blind.  </s>
<s> Does anyone know of statistics on how many people have what setups with what capabilities?  </s>
<s> And, for little used setups, how possible it would be for those users to switch to the more popular setups (e.g. not possible for deaf individual to switch from Braille to speech)?  </s>

<s> Hi, Al  </s>
<s> What I originally brought up is whether forms could be considered accessible to blind people.  </s>
<s> Some aspects are:  </s>
<s> 1. If some blind computer users can access forms, are they accessible?  </s>
<s> 2. If a person has a preferred screen reader which doesn't work with forms, are they accessible?  </s>
<s> 3. If it takes blind computer users three times longer to use forms than sighted users, are forms accessible?  </s>
<s> 4. If blind users make more errors using forms than sighted users, are forms accessible?  </s>
<s> Blind users have a wide range of success using buttons on forms depending on the combination of screen reader and browser.  </s>
<s> You mentioned Lynx as being accessible.  </s>
<s> However, suppose that the form uses Javascript.  </s>
<s> I think that Lynx would have problems.  </s>
<s> If a legal challenge was needed in the future, on what basis could it be stated that web pages are (or are not) accessible?  </s>
<s> Scott  </s>
<s> to follow up on what Scott Luebking said:  </s>
<s> Probably not, ipso facto, their inclusion or exclusion of forms.  </s>
<s> That question is too broad to have a yes/no answer.  </s>
<s> As you said,  </s>
<s> We want to move that distribution until it is clustered at the "high degree of success" end.  </s>
<s> To do that maybe we should try to learn what it is that does and doesn't work.  </s>
<s> It's not so simple as being a form or not being a form.  </s>
<s> We probably need to take a variety of cases and examine them in more detail.  </s>
<s> Then maybe we can learn how to discipline both the composition of the forms and the behavior of the user equipment so that usability is the norm, not pot luck.  </s>
<s> I imagine that is what the groups working with Jon, Chuck and Gregg are setting out to do.  </s>
<s> -- Al Gilman  </s>
<s> Hi, Al Yes, I pretty much agree with you.  </s>
<s> The combination of browser and access technology is variable in providing successful access to different types of forms.  </s>
<s> This variability is frustrating for web site developers who want to make their web sites accessible.  </s>
<s> Unfortunately, the current murkiness of whether forms are or not accessible probably means that it will be harder for an individual to prove that a web site using forms provided by entities covered by ADA Title II or Title is not in compliance.  </s>
