Suggestions for the agenda at http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/meetings/9jan01.html 
Re Evaluation (and Repair) language (EARL) which is already on the agenda: 
What would motivate authoring tool designers to input EARL? 
To output EARL? 
E.g., to avoid need to do all testing, to address test results from 
third party. 
What should authoring tool do to make application of EARL easier (e.g. id on each element) Possible additional topic: 
Also discussion of plenary. 
How to coordinate meetings? 
Have one big meeting? 
Whom to invite? 
Len Leonard R. Kasday, Ph.D. Institute on Disabilities/UAP and Dept. of Electrical Engineering at Temple University (215) 204-2247 (voice) (800) 750-7428 (TTY) Chair, W3C Web Accessibility Initiative Evaluation and Repair Tools Group The WAVE web page accessibility evaluation assistant: 
Added. 
Please also review the draft prepared by Jan Richards to integrate the AERT 
techniques into ATAG techniques and check that there are not things missing 
or things that should not be there. 
(Long URI warning): Cheers Charles McCN

Another agenda item should probably be review of AERT document integration into the AU Techniques, and strategies for tackling unresolved issues. 
(Charles can you make sure the last draft from Jan is available for review). 
Thanks Jutta 
That is on the agenda (and there is a link to the sources area which links to 
the techniquees from Jan and the SMIL techniques that we need to integrate 
together...)

Which (SMIL) reminds me... 
[MK] Macromedia have published "guidelines" on their web sites (effectively not guidelines, more like techniques) for creating accessible 
Flash. Anything we should do with that? 
(Ignore, integrate, refer to, ...)

Hi all, my regrets for our conference call this week. 
Talk you next week, Matthias Matthias Mueller-Prove mprove@adobe.com,

Well, I had a look. 
Some of it is material that would count as techniques for WCAG, with 
explanation of how it is done in particular products. 
We might want to use or point to some of that. 
But the examples I looked at required Flash (which I 
don't have on the linux platform) with no alternative content provided (they obviously didn't follow their guidelines or use their techniques). 
So from my look I didn't find anything that we should include - anyone got more specific reference suggestions? 
Or are you suggesting these as platform-specific guidelines? 
(I am not aware of Flash being available as a platform for anyone else to develop in - am I wrong on that?) Charles McCN Which (SMIL) reminds me...

Charles, 
Yes, indeed as I noted, it's more techniques than guidelines. 
I also noted that the examples did not themselves have alternative content :) (But then that was not what the examples were illustrating, at least not the ones I stumbled over.) While one could classify the whole exercise as "too little, too late," I'd rather see it as "better late than never". 
It may not be perfect, and they don't have all the terminology straight. 
OK, so they're still learning, but 
they are making an effort, and the current result is at least useful for Flash developers. 
Much better than nothing, in my view. 
I would suggest we refer to it, rather than including it. 
We could add some sort of qualification, too (not complete, good starting point?). Platform-specific guidelines? 
I don't think so; technology-specific guidelines (rather, techniques!) would be more to the point - comparable to guidelines / techniques for SMIL; it is another multimedia-presentation technology, after all. 
[As an aside, I'd also like to note that whereas many sites really try hard to force Flash down your throat (I encountered one this morning that just kept on reloading the image, and popping up the dialog to download the plugin, making it practically impossible to even click on a link; I had to try really hard to get past the home page), Macromedia do not make that mistake. 
There is only a small link on their pages that you can follow if you _do_ have the plugin. 
Excellent example of how to have Flash content without forcing everyone to load it.]

Susan Morrow, Marketing manager at Macromedia, came to a pf meeting in Washington recently. 
Wouldn't it be nicer if we could advise her on improvements to her 'guidelines'? 
She seemed more than willing to listen and learn. 
I get the impression that they really are trying, but like lots of us, there's a lot to learn. 
Regards DaveP 
Dave, Does Susan have an email address (so we could copy her on the conversation)? 
As a suggestion, she could subscribe to this list and actively take part (or just lurk) - it's a public list, and she'd be quite welcome. 
Concrete suggestion to begin with: "Guidelines" are what you are trying to accomplish, and what (one / an application) should conform to; "Techniques" are specific tactics and strategies one follows (with a certain Authoring tool) to accomplish such conformance. 
Note that I'm not intending to criticize Macromedia here - I proposed looking at their effort precisely because I really think it's useful for developers! 
Cheers, 
Marjolein

And with their market share, we reach a lot of developers that way :-) Regards DaveP
