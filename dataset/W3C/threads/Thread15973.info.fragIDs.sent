Hello--The Federal Communications Commission would appreciate any feedback you may have on a new website on enforcement. 
The URL is: complaint form where any consumer can file complaints, and we expect a percentage of these complaints to be from consumers with disabilities. 
The complaint form URL is: The web staff has gone through steps to ensure accessibility, however, we realize that it is hard to catch everything with a first draft. 
Accessibility is a high priority to us. 
Thank you in advance--Pam Gregory, Deputy Director, Disabilities Issues Task Force. 
A pretty good job, although there is (as there usually is in life) room for improvement. 
Some specific suggestions: It seems that the seperation into a frames and a nofrmaes version is unecessary - the only differences in content I could discover were a lack of links to ccb from the text-only version. 
Placing the content of the textonly welcome inside the noframes would be a good way of making the impression of a 'second-class entrance' disappear. 
The 'banwindow' in the navigation frame is confusing - it frustrated me that there appeared to be a broken link until I went into the source and read the script. 
And the use of repeat framesets means that some of the framesets have no NOFRAMES content at all, which is not very good. 
I didn't find anything that requires masses of work to fix (although I haven't checked the scorecard, which I downloaded - that takes several steps, and a link to a plain-text version, or even better an HTML version, would be nice.) I checked using Lynx and Netscape - I'll have a look at it again with IE under Jaws if I get time. 
Charles McCathieNevile Opinions my own.

Reply to: RE FCC website accessibility The thing that stands out the most is that link at the top of the page-- the one that leads to the text-only page-- is a graphic. 
Thus, my screen reader can't locate the text-only link and I can't get to the text-only page. 
If you make this link text instead of a graphic, that would make it very easy to get to the text-only site.
