<s> Short version: I think that the solution is now clear to the "signed in parts"problem, that you must define (using xpath or sed or whatever) the way a valid document is a function of the parts, and sign that document.  </s>
<s> Long version:  </s>
<s> I am worried that this "meaning of document closure" thread is suggesting that signing parts should be construed as parts having meaning in context.  </s>
<s> Basically, logically, a document is a sentence in a language, and we have applications which process documents according to specs, and we say that documents have meaning.  </s>
<s> Parts of documents do not have meaning per se.  </s>
<s> It is not, of course, for the digital signature spec to say what the semantics are of a document -- that is the for the language.  </s>
<s> It is for the digital signature to show how a document has been signed with a certain key.  </s>
<s> It is for a trust system to determine the algorithm for defining what can be inferred from  </s>
<s> a document signed with a given key.  </s>
<s> When we talk about signing parts of a document, then they only way I can see of giving meaning to this is to say that we are signing a some document which is not acutally given, but is formed by making a particular transfortion on the document given.  </s>
<s> One can try to talk about the "semantics of a part of the document in its context in the document" as much as one likes but one can only define what it means by showing or defining that it is equivalent to some other notional document.  </s>
<s> John Boyer says, "An element's meaning can be  </s>
<s> changed by tags and attributes of any element in its ancestor path.  </s>
<s> " Well, you can change is by making any change anywhere along the lines of "this overrides what I said in the paragraph above" -- depending of course on the language you are writing in.  </s>
<s> But XML has no rules outlawing langauges which allow that.  </s>
<s> So you can't ask me to sign the odd-numbered second level elements of a document.  </s>
<s> You can ask me to sign the document which would be formed by stripping out all even-numbered second-level elements.  </s>
<s> Life is then simplified.  </s>
<s> A signature is over a document.  </s>
<s> The document can be referred to, and/or enclosed, directly, or specified as a manipulation function.  </s>
<s> So long as both parties know how to do it, any function can be used.  </s>
<s> This puts the (xpath, say) function into a very similar position to the canonicalization function.  </s>
<s> We don't have (here) to discuss what modifications may or may not be made to a document later.  </s>
<s> A particular sentence has been signed.  </s>
<s> According to the language, one may be able to deduce other valid things and craete other believable documents  </s>
<s> by futher manipulations but this spec doesn't have to worry about that.  </s>
<s> A signing user should of course be presented with the function being signed rather than any original document.  </s>
<s> I think this addresses for exaple the scenario Phill mentions in Tim BL  </s>
<s> (By the way, I think of closure in the sense of the set of all objects obtained by repeated application of an operation.  </s>
<s> I expected the term to  </s>
<s> represent the repeated operation of finding all dependent references within the document and signing them.  </s>
<s> Dependent references meaning something which  </s>
<s> affects the meaning and you won't already know and trust.  </s>
<s> Tim, I agree with your analysis.  </s>
<s> I think we are essentially arguing the same case but with slight differences in terminology.  </s>
<s> What is signed is by definition the document.  </s>
<s> In order to verify the signature the document the client has to assemble the exact bit sequence that was signed.  </s>
<s> The client has no business trusting any document other than the document that the verified bit sequence represents.  </s>
<s> One XML document may well be transported encapsulated in another but unless the enclosing document is signed the data it contains cannot be trusted.  </s>
<s> Phill  </s>
<s> Hi Tim, I guess I could not tell from your letter whether you intended to disagree with me, but I agree exactly with what you've said in this letter and see it as further justification for why the WG should proceed in the way we seem to be proceeding now.  </s>
<s> Contrary to implication, the quote you gave of mine was not designed to be the only type of data interdependency that I could see among elements.  </s>
<s> It was designed to provide a specific 'proof by counterexample' against the sufficiency of the inclusion logic for document filtering which was actively being defended in earlier drafts of dsig specs.  </s>
<s> Most if not all of my communications about these issues have stated that we do not have a specific vocabulary in mind, so we need exclusion logic as well or we will only be able to sign a subset of XML.  </s>
<s> If XML permits a data relationship, then we have to provide a way for the author of a document filter to capture the data relationship.  </s>
<s> This is the more graph theoretic sense which made me choose the word closure to describe what I mean.  </s>
<s> Literally, we are talking about transitive closure on a digraph of data dependencies, as in obtain the set of elements 'reachable' from a given element by a path of data dependencies.  </s>
<s> The definition I gave in my email is a more practical one whose utility is easier for the WG to see.  </s>
<s> It is the view of document closure as seen by those who must manipulate documents and construct document filters.  </s>
<s> It is a definition that helps the person understand what they are supposed to do with the feature.  </s>
<s> However, if one says that the entire document must be scanned and that we should permit precise identification of elements for exclusion in order to achieve transitive closure on data dependencies, then it should be clear that either definition implies the other.  </s>
<s> So, although we have no knowledge of the XML vocabulary at play and hence  </s>
<s> cannot construe any semantics about parts having meaning in context, the  </s>
<s> author of the document filter *does* have specific knowledge of the vocabulary, the semantics and even the specific usage scenarios at play and thus can construct a signature whose validation is construed as meaning that the document has not been modified in a meaningful way within the application context.  </s>
<s> The ability to specify the transitive closure of dependent elements is pretty much the same thing as the ability to specify what can change after the signature is applied.  </s>
<s> In conclusion, I agree with the repeated application of a node test (which is exactly what the XPath does), I esp.  </s>
<s> agree that the signature must be applied to the entire document (which is necessary both for transitive closure interpretation and for the implementation of exclusion logic), I obviously agree that exclusion logic is preferrable, I agree that the document filter is like an application c14nalg (as opposed to an XML c14nalg), I agree that it is a transformation function, I agree that the transformed document must include the transformed function in the hash, and I agree that it is the transformed document must be presented to the user.  </s>
<s> Best of all, this is how XFDL operates.  </s>
<s> Since we seem to agree on every substantial point (once one looks deeper at what I've been saying and why it was said in particular ways), I am hoping you will let me know if I have misinterpreted anything you are saying.  </s>
<s> John Boyer Software Development Manager UWI.Com -- The Internet Forms Company  </s>
<s> Here is my short version: 1.  </s>
<s> I agree that the meaning of parts of documents should not be assumed out of context.  </s>
<s> 2. I believe that a document part *can* be paired with a reference to its context.  </s>
<s> I think that is what a "document closure" is, if I understand how the term is being used here.  </s>
<s> 3. But, signing documents or parts of documents should have nothing to do with the meaning of the documents.  </s>
<s> We only sign the bits and bytes of the document, not the meaning.  </s>
<s> The signature itself may have meaning, but that is separate from the meaning of the document being signed.  </s>
<s> We can sign a package containing a document and a reference to its intended meaning, but that is different from the meaning of the signature itself.  </s>
<s> And the long version....  </s>
<s> I would say that parts of documents have meaning only in context.  </s>
<s> But even whole documents can have a different meaning depending on how they are referenced, and how they relate to other documents.  </s>
<s> The difference is only whether the data is immediately contained or externally referenced.  </s>
<s> This one difference seems to imply that there is also something more authoritative about immediate data, and hence the relationship to the signing.  </s>
<s> But just because you found some bytes next to other bytes doesn't by itself make them more authoritative.  </s>
<s> Rather, it is the *signing* of bytes, whether they are found together or apart, that gives us the authority to say that the two forms, together or apart, are equivalent.  </s>
<s> But in addition to having meaning, documents also are composed of bits and bytes, and this is the level at which signatures operate.  </s>
<s> Why does it matter to a signature what a string of bytes means?  </s>
<s> The difference between immediate vs referenced data is relevant for signing, because a referenced document must be dereferenced before its bytes can be signed, and the dereferencing introduces another risk.  </s>
<s> It may also be important to sign the reference itself, in the context of the document containing the reference.  </s>
<s> Right, but what can be inferred from a document (regardless of a signature) is different from what can be inferred from the signature of a document.  </s>
<s> Transformations may be at various levels of syntax and semantics, depending on where you draw the line.  </s>
<s> But mere "extraction" of the bytes of a part of a document seems like a fairly straightforward syntactic operation.  </s>
<s> The only way it can get more complex is if the bytes of the part are somehow different depending on the context.  </s>
<s> Showing semantic equivalence would be hard, but I don't think it is relevant to signing bytes.  </s>
<s> But life often refuses to be so simplified.  </s>
<s> If a document is merely a representation of a resource, and the resource contains other resources, each with its own separate representations, then we are back to considering whether a part of a document that corresponds to a separate resource might be worthy of a signature.  </s>
<s> On a slightly different tangent, now that I am thinking about all this, how useful or necessary is it to sign parts of documents?  </s>
<s> I'd always thought of XML signatures as being contained in XML documents where the thing being signed was part of that very same document.  </s>
<s> Obviously, in this case, you don't want to sign the whole document including the signature because the signature would be partly a function of itself.  </s>
<s> So this assumes we can sign parts of documents from the outset.  </s>
<s> That doesn't mean it is necessary, however, since we could always sign something external to the XML signature document, referenced by a URI.  </s>
<s> But sometimes we want to be able to sign not only a document referenced by a URI, but the combination of the URI and the document, so that we know that neither has changed.  </s>
<s> In that case, we have to package up the URI and either the whole document, or a reliable hash of the document, and sign the package.  </s>
<s> That package could be a document with its own URI, but we would be back at step one if we relied on resolving the URI for the package.  </s>
<s> So it seems we MUST have signatures of anonymous packages.  </s>
<s> Is this true?  </s>
<s> Belief in what a document says (its meaning) must be distinguished from the belief only that it has been signed by some authority.  </s>
<s> If the meaning of a signature provided by some authority is that everything it signs is true, and if you trust that authority, then you would probably believe in any document it signs.  </s>
<s> But not all signatures have the meaning that the thing signed is true.  </s>
<s> A notory public only asserts that some particular individual signed a particular document on some particular date, not that what the document says is even meaningful.  </s>
<s> That sounds like a transitive closure operation.  </s>
<s> Is it meaningful to distinguish a closure which includes references from a transitive closure with no (meaningful) references?  </s>
<s> I expected the term to represent the repeated operation of finding all dependent references within the document and signing them.  </s>
<s> Certainly in some cases you want to sign both a document (whether a part or a whole) together with things it is dependent on, whether or not those things are explicitly referenced by the document or implicit in some application context.  </s>
<s> You also sometimes want to sign a reference itself together with the document it resolves to (as discussed above).  </s>
<s> This is where it gets tricky.  </s>
<s> A dumb, generic signature function should not be required to figure out any of that, of course.  </s>
<s> Some appropriate higher-level application, together with your preferences and your web of trust, would decide what package of things should be signed.  </s>
<s> Given that, the meaning of documents is irrelevant to signing them at the level of the dumb generic signature function.  </s>
<s> Is your real concern that we will have problems writing those appropriate higher-level applications that attempt to understand some of the semantics of documents to determine what package of things needs to be signed?  </s>
<s> I agree it will be a challenge.  </s>
