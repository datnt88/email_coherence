<s> The rule of thumb I like to use, is that is someone could access the content, (IE: they have the potential ability to understand the content), but they can not because of the design choices of the author (language, style ect) then that content is not accessible.  </s>
<s> We should also add that we have and are working on techniques to allow for an author to write as they choose but simplify they text through markup so that it is neither constraining nor discrediting.  </s>
<s> It would just be another job to do.  </s>
