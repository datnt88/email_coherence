<s> On 23 October 1996, the ERB will vote to decide the following question.  </s>
<s> A straw poll indicates the ERB is leaning to no. C.13 Should XML remove SGML's prohibition on multiple ID or NOTATION attributes on the same element (11.3.3)?  </s>
<s> Yes. Without a DTD, you can't detect it anyway.  </s>
<s> In fact, without a DTD, the only attribute type that makes any sense to me at all is !AttList someElement smething CDATA #IMPLIED Lee  </s>
<s> NO. As I said before, I also think we should hardwire the attribute name "id" to mean "The ID attribute".  </s>
<s> Maybe we should do the same for notation, though that usage is much less common, so maybe we should keep our "notation" unpolluted.  </s>

<s> Note that a Yes vote for this would clash with the idea of a fixed name for ids.  </s>
<s> I think this one has to be No for consistency, even though I hate the idea of having to force Tamils to using a rude word to identify anything in XML! Martin Bryan, The SGML Centre, Churchdown, Glos.  </s>
