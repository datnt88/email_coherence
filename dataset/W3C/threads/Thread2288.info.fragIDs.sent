The syntax for net_path would appear to be buggy: net_path = "//" net_loc [ abs_path ] net_loc = *( pchar | ";" | "?" ) rom these I derive the following net_path ///foo/bar with net_loc - empty string . 
Is that intended?

The triple slash is used quite deliberately in the LDAP URL scheme. 
There it denotes an URL that can be used through any globally coordinated LDAP server. 
I would object if the LDAP scheme was made illegal just after publication.
