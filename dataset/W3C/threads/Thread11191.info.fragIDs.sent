<s> A couple of unanswered questions that I'd like to pre-empt: BTW is there a more recent spec that 961114?  </s>
<s> I trawled the logs but I couldn't see a reference.  </s>
<s> 1. What *may*, and what *must* precede the root element in a well-formed XML document?  </s>
<s> The spec isn't very clear on which PIs are compulsory and which are optional.  </s>
<s> 2. How may entities be used in XML?  </s>
<s> ie whether general entities can be included and to what depth.  </s>
<s> 3. The restriction in WF documents on what elements may occur within what others is not clear (3.2): As a consequence of this, for each non-root element C, there is one other element P such that C is in the content of P, but is not in the content of any other element that is in the content of P.  </s>
<s> Then P is referred to as the parent of C, and C as the child of P.  </s>
<s> Here's a non-root element C which we call PARA in some DTD or other.  </s>
<s> There is _an_other element (not _one_ other) P which we call SECT.  </s>
<s> PARA is in the content of SECT.  </s>
<s> So far so good.  </s>
<s> But SECT has in its content also an element called NOTE.  </s>
<s> NOTE has PARA in its content model.  </s>
<s> In other words: +----- stuff +--- HEAD +----- stuff +--- PARA docroot -| | +--- HEAD +----- SECT ---+--- NOTE ---+  </s>
<s> | +--- PARA +--- stuff  </s>
<s> Is this permitted?  </s>
<s> 3.2 seems to say not: C can only be in the content of P and may not reoccur anywhere on the same branch of the tree.  </s>
<s> This is going to be an impossible restriction.  </s>
<s> Or have I misread it?  </s>

<s> Soon, we hope.  </s>
<s> I read productions 27-31 as meaning: - the root element must be preceded by a prolog - the prolog must begin with an XML declaration i.e. ?XML version='1.0'  </s>
<s> ... ?  </s>
<s> - the prolog may contain PIs, comments, one document type declaration, and white space, following the XML declaration Which part of this isn't clear from the spec?  </s>
<s> Yes, general entities may be used.  </s>
<s> No depth restriction is made.  </s>
<s> The paragraph quoted is referring to the elements (instances), not to their types; to actual containment, not potential containment.  </s>
<s> A PARA contained directly within a NOTE has exactly one parent element: the NOTE.  </s>
<s> The fact that other PARA elements have or can have parents with GIs other than NOTE does nothing to change the nature of the parent-child relationship.  </s>

<s> Sorry, I was less than precise in rewording what I was sent.  </s>
<s> It related to what NAMEs are {required|allowed} in an XML PI in the Prolog?  </s>
<s> VERSION and RMD seem to be required, ENCODING is obviously dependent, EMPTY I believe has been taken away (so one correspondent said, anyway), are TEXT, NOTEXT, DEFAULT, and IDINFO still in?  </s>
<s> Aaaaaah. Sound of light dawning.  </s>
<s> Perhaps something about ocurring in the instance could be introduced to make this clear.  </s>
<s> Many thanks.  </s>
