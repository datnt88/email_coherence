I was trying something like this today: Respond.org.uk: a href="http:www.respond.org.uk/help/index.html" 
Challenging sexual abuse in the lives of people with a a title="learning diasability" LD /a /a I expect someone else can think up a better example, and it is hardly a very serious issue, just thought I'd mention it. 
jonathan There are a number of links like this on the W3C Home Page. 
iCab, which handles abbreviation elements by umarking them stylistically, and providing an expansion of them on mouseover, still does this for a link. 
in the case of something like a href="DOM/" class="navlink" acronym title="Document Object Model" DOM /acronym /a The status bar, on hovering, shows Link to "Document Object Model" (http://www.w3.org/DOM/) Do you have the following example online somewhere so I can test what happens?

The Opera Browser displays the contents of the title attribute in the status bar when you hover the pointer over an acronym element. 
Unfortunately moving the keyboard focus to the element does not cause the title information to be rendered in the status bar. 
2. Netscape 6.2 displays the contents of the title attribute as a tool tip when you hover the pointer over an acronym element. 
No keyboard support.
