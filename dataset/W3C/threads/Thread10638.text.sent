A combination of the W3C site being down and backlog of work after the tech plenary means I didn't have the time to do better. 
Process discussion: Brian queries whether the meeting is quorate. 
Most of the editors are present, so the decision is to proceed with the telecon as a normal working group telecon, but defer formal announcent of any decisions until after the next WG telecon, where the decisions can be retified and/or challenged.

16:11:32 see: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Mar/0025.html 
The meeting's general consensus was to tighten up the specification to use canonicalized form in the abstract syntax, while noting that applications remain free to use a non-canonical form to represent the canonical form. 
This simplifies the specifications, and effectively requires that reasoners do full canonicalization, but leaves applications that don't reason about XML literal forms free to not canonicalize. 
ACTION 2003-03-11#1, JJC: Make a proposal that abstract syntax contains canonicalized XML, with comments. 
pfps-14 Social Meaning discussion: http://ilrt.org/discovery/chatlogs/rdfcore/2003-03-11 
16:46:40 Jeremy reported back from the meeting in Boston: see: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Mar/0027.html 
Unanimous recommendation from that meeting was to strike discussion of social meaning, and attendant issues. 
It was noted that this did not preclude the possibility to define these issues in another, later, document.

It was generally felt that the intent of the current wording, in its context, was not likely to be misunderstood. 
But some improvements to the wording were discussed and broadly agreed.

#g Graham Klyne PGP: 0FAA 69FF C083 000B A2E9 A131 01B9 1C7A DBCA CB5E Issue list: http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20030123-issues/ 
An initial review of these issues: williams-01, What is a node in an RDF graph? 
Both Jeremy and I have made proposals: pfps-16, RDF's Expressive Power I think this is a largely editorial issue, involving text at various places in the document. 
I propose that the issue is addressed by me revising text in sections 2.2, 2.2.6 and 3.5. 
pfps-18, namespace v vocabulary Brian has proposed a resolution: and I have subsequently noted usage in RDF-concepts: I this is a basis for closing this issue. 
pfps-22, reserved names in abstract syntax pfps-23, sanctioned by? 
I think these are really a single issue. 
With respect to section "RDF Core URI Vocabulary and Namespaces": I suggest: 1. Soften the initial sentence: RDF uses URIs to identify resources and properties. 
Certain URIs are reserved for use by RDF, and may not be used for any purpose not sanctioned the RDF specifications. 
Specifically, URIs with the following leading substrings are reserved for RDF core vocabulary: to RDF uses URIs to identify resources and properties. 
Certain URIs are reserved for use by RDF, and should not be used in ways not supported by the RDF specifications. 
Specifically, URIs with the following leading substrings are reserved for definition by the RDF specifications: 2. add some additional text along the lines of: The meaning of URIs in the RDF and RDFS vocabularies (i.e. those that start with the RDF or RDFS namespace name) is determined by the RDF specifications (including possible future revisions and extensions). 
Any information about such URIs that is not supported by the RDF specification should not be taken to be true in all uses of RDF. 
Thus, URIs based on the RDF and RDFS namespace names should be treated as reserved, except for purposes specified by RDF specifications. 
Also note that some URIs in the RDF vocabulary have purely syntactic purpose; e.g. rdf:ID is used in the RDF/XML syntax, and is not specified for use to denote an RDF subject, object or property. 
Such use has no defined meaning, and should be avoided. 
A list of syntactically reserved URIs is in section 5.1, The RDF Namespace, of the RDF/XML syntax specification.

(There's some redundancy here with the existing text, but the goal here to indicate an intent, not rewrite the document. 
So the actual changes would not be exactly as suggested here.) #g Graham Klyne PGP: 0FAA 69FF C083 000B A2E9 A131 01B9 1C7A DBCA CB5E
