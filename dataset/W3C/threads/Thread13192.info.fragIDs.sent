Actually, as I understand the proposal, it's actually a proposal to make CSS more accessible, not just CLASS itself. 
Is that correct?

close quote Well, I like to think that it's class that's being made accessible and CSS is simply the means used to accomplish that.. Theoretically, class is independent of CSS... HTML 4.01 says that user agents can utilize class in other ways (tho it doesn't specify them) And other means could be used to make the class accessible, like the RDF I described (tho I favor using class).
