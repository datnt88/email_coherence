<s> Has anyone worked with ALLClear?  </s>
<s> This is a flowcharting tool I evaluated some years ago that has a syntax for describing flowcharts.  </s>
<s> Semi-colons, commas, and other punctuation marks denoted different flowchart symbols.  </s>
<s> If this or some other scheme was adopted as a standard, then a visuall-impaired person could generate flowcharts, as well as interpret flowchart information!  </s>

<s> Subject: How to describe Flowcharts, Schematics, etc Most image on the web are decoration or icons with simple meanings like "next page".  </s>
<s> so ALT text and long descriptions are relatively straightforward.  </s>
<s> But some images convey information.  </s>
<s> For example, A simple linear sequence, like a flow chart with input going through a series of processing stages to result in an output.  </s>
<s> A tree diagram, like a company's organization chart.  </s>
<s> A more general diagram showing a bunch of interconnected objects, e.g. a schematic diagram or an electronic circuit.  </s>
<s> The most complex is a 3D machine, in motion if you want to make it even harder.  </s>
<s> Are there any guidelines on how to describe these diagrams?  </s>
<s> For example, you could use lists and nested lists for linear sequences and trees respectively.  </s>
<s> Or you could use prose.  </s>
<s> More general diagrams are, well, a more general problem.  </s>
<s> What techniques are best for what purposes and audiences?  </s>
<s> What's good wording, especially for prose decriptions?  </s>
<s> I'm mainly thinking of speech output here, since that's what most blind surfers will be using, rather than Braille or tactile graphics.  </s>
<s> This is no doubt hard to encapsulate... at some point you just have to get a skilled technical writer, especially for the prose versions... Len Leonard R.

<s> One of my favorite sayings (I don't know who said/wrote it): "The map is not the territory."  </s>
<s> In the context of this discussion, the diagram is not the model.  </s>
<s> We need to convey the content and structure of models - organization charts, schematics, etc - independent of their appropriate presentation for a particular user, or the available representation.  </s>
<s> The Object Management Group www.omg.org has done a lot of work in this area.  </s>
<s> In particular, I think their Meta-Object Facility (MOF) and XML Metadata Interchange (XMI) may be applicable.  </s>
<s> MOF is a Meta-Meta-Modelling Language: a syntax and semantics for describing other meta-models: org charts, schematics, computer systems, whatever.  </s>
<s> XMI is an XML format for exporting and importing arbitrary meta-models to and from MOF.  </s>
<s> Through XMI, any meta-modeling language could be converted into any other meta-modeling language.  </s>
<s> *In theory* any model could be converted into XMI for storage on a server and transmission over the Web, e-mail, whatever.  </s>
<s> A User Agent can parse the XMI to read the model and present it to the user.  </s>
<s> To present a different class or set of models, you develop a meta-model, XML DTD, and XMI transforms.  </s>
<s> Optionally, you develop stylesheets for different presentation media.  </s>
<s> For more information about XMI see http://www.software.ibm.com/ad/standards/xmi.html or http://www.omg.org/news/pr99.html#xmi .  </s>

<s> I had said if I could draw the flowchart, I can model it in XML.  </s>
<s> Why invent my own DTD when omg have done it for me.  </s>
<s> Love the idea.  </s>
<s> Love to see a simple implementation so that when my colleagues say can I have a copy, I use the XSL transforms to convert from the XMI to the graphical form for sighted colleagues, and to (say) a hyperlinked HTML version for the VI members of the group, just as I do with the rest of the presentation which is text based!  </s>
<s> Yippee.  </s>
<s> Love the ideas, now how to select from the crap set of graphical symbols in the UML guide graphical set yuk/ to use them for QFD charts, QPD diagrams, system symbolic diagrams ......... regards, and tks for a great idea, DaveP  </s>
