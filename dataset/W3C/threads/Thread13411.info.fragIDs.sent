<s> - Ian  </s>
<s> Briefly, the area under discussion has to do with class tokens that are applied to elements in the HTML markup.  </s>
<s> The DOM core requirements will expose these values because they are attributes.  </s>
<s> So the API requirement to share the document contents in accordance with the W3C DOM means AT software has access to these through this API.  </s>
<s> The part I am vague about is how the guideline that the browser through its  </s>
<s> own UI should give the user access to all content is being interpreted as  </s>
<s> regards CLASS tokens.  </s>
<s> IMHO they should be covered; the CLASS tokens are metadata and I am arguing that authors should set them in a mnemonic fashion as well as eventually tie them to schemata for more precise machine-processable definitions.  </s>

<s> Continuing from Al's intro...  </s>
<s> This came up to cover the following case.  </s>
<s> A web page author want to define "new" parts of a page in a color like red.  </s>
<s> Instead of using a font tag, the author defines a class "new" and uses a style sheet to present it in red.  </s>
<s> So far so good.  </s>
<s> But for this to benefit the blind user:  </s>
<s> 1. The user agent must announce the class names to the user  </s>
<s> 2. The web content guidelines must specify that class names be mnemonic and useful.  </s>
<s> 3. The authoring tools should make is simple to change the class name, in case the initial choice is not good.  </s>
<s> This would involve changing it  </s>
<s> throughout the style sheet and all pages using the style sheet.  </s>
<s> In fact, it would be even better if the text announced to the user could be independent of the name of the class, just like ALT text is independent of the filename chosen for a file.  </s>
<s> Al points out how this can be considered implicit in what we have already (except for the very last point).  </s>
<s> I'd suggest though that it be made explicit in the user agent, web content, and authoring tools.  </s>

<s> It depends on what you mean.  </s>
<s> If you mean that for style alone, then ok.  </s>
<s> But "new" suggests semantics and what's needed is some semantic description: a) In a spec like for HTML (for "new" in HTML use INS).  </s>
<s> b) A new element + a schema.  </s>
<s> I don't think "class" names convey semantics effectively without a formal mechanism for assigning meaning.  </s>
<s> How else is the machine to guess what it means?  </s>
<s> What about values in languages other than what the user knows?  </s>
<s> What about these instead: 1a) Authors should provide alternative style sheets.  </s>
<s> (e.g., aural style sheets for speech output).  </s>
<s> User agents must allow users to select from available style sheets.  </s>
<s> The "class" attribute is for machines, isn't it?  </s>
<s> I don't see how one can rely on human interpretation of class values.  </s>
