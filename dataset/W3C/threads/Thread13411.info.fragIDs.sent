I think we'll have to coordinate with the Guideline and Authoring groups to 
make that point explicit. 
I can't find any explicit mention of CLASS name being readable in the user 
agent guidelines or the web content guidelines. 
In fact, in technique 4.4.1, just after it says "To further ensure that users understand differences between list items indicated visually, content developers should provide a text label before or after the list item phrase:" implying that the CLASS name isn't accessible for that purpose.

Talk to Jon or Ian about where the drafts and issues are. 
They are 
wrestling with how to make the guideline transcend HTML and yet make the checkpoints clear. 
Actually, that language includes placing the text label in such a display by using a style rule to expose the CLASS key. 
It describes how the document should display, not how it should be coded. 
The attribute access in the UA guidelines is a) a drill-down capability, not the default presentation without special processing, and b) not widely disseminated in the field. 
It is reasonable for the content guidelines to go beyond this for something that will show up in the default rendering of existing browsers. 
Sometimes we need to pursue both strategy A and strategy B. The fact that strategy B is pursued does not mean strategy A is not being pursued as well.

Could you please describe the requirement?

Briefly, the area under discussion has to do with class tokens that are applied to elements in the HTML markup. 
The DOM core requirements will expose these values because they are attributes. 
So the API requirement to share the document contents in accordance with the W3C DOM means AT software has access to these through this API. 
The part I am vague about is how the guideline that the browser through its 
own UI should give the user access to all content is being interpreted as 
regards CLASS tokens. 
IMHO they should be covered; the CLASS tokens are metadata and I am arguing that authors should set them in a mnemonic fashion as well as eventually tie them to schemata for more precise machine-processable definitions. 
This is just an intro; please glance over the thread on w3c-wai-er-ig in the archives. 
Use "css abuse" in the subject to find the thread.

Continuing from Al's intro... 
This came up to cover the following case. 
A web page author want to define "new" parts of a page in a color like red. 
Instead of using a font tag, the author defines a class "new" and uses a style sheet to present it in red. 
So far so good. 
But for this to benefit the blind user: 
1. The user agent must announce the class names to the user 
2. The web content guidelines must specify that class names be mnemonic and useful. 
3. The authoring tools should make is simple to change the class name, in case the initial choice is not good. 
This would involve changing it 
throughout the style sheet and all pages using the style sheet. 
In fact, it would be even better if the text announced to the user could be independent of the name of the class, just like ALT text is independent of the filename chosen for a file. 
Al points out how this can be considered implicit in what we have already (except for the very last point). 
I'd suggest though that it be made explicit in the user agent, web content, and authoring tools.

It depends on what you mean. 
If you mean that for style alone, then ok. 
But "new" suggests semantics and what's needed is some semantic description: a) In a spec like for HTML (for "new" in HTML use INS). 
b) A new element + a schema. 
I don't think "class" names convey semantics effectively without a formal mechanism for assigning meaning. 
How else is the machine to guess what it means? 
What about values in languages other than what the user knows? 
What about these instead: 1a) Authors should provide alternative style sheets. 
(e.g., aural style sheets for speech output). 
User agents must allow users to select from available style sheets. 
The "class" attribute is for machines, isn't it? 
I don't see how one can rely on human interpretation of class values. 
What if they're in another language? 
According to whom?
