Sorry is this is a dumb question but what exactly is the difference between ABBR and ACRONYM? 
And as ACRONYM seems to be in the latest HTML4 spec and ABBR is not is it more sensible to use ACRONYM? 
One difference we (RNIB) need to recognise, for an acronym, presented to a low end synth speech system 'reading' a page, the acronym needs to be 'spaced out', such that RNIB becomes R N I B, whereas this is not necessary with an 'abbrev' which can (often) be 'read out' without being 'spelled out' - if you catch my drift. 
This (IMHO) necessitates differentiation between the two. 
How many authors appreciate such finesse I am unsure.

This thread has been going a little while now. 
And a lot of it has presented acronyms and abbreviations with no mark-up. 
Perhaps an important question to ask is "How are those who use screen-readers, braille printers, etc, understanding the discussion so far?" 
As a sighted reader, it has not presented many problems to me. 
Is that the case for others?

Apologies to anyone for whom this has been the case. 
In a context like wai-ig, I feel that I can usually trust others to beat myself up for me, and I think someone would have mentioned it. 
But I have the thread here locally on my Mac, and I'd be happy to edit for legibility and re-post any message if that is the case. 
In terms of the more general question, screen readers will always have to deal with ASCI occasionally, and (although I'm not familiar with the technology) I suspect that on-the-fly parsing of mark-up is not neccisarily standard. 
Being new to the list, I don't want to cover ground that has been gone over before, but thought I'd chip in another perspective on abbreviations and acronyms. 
In the library world, there's a standard reference work called the _Acronyms, Abbreviations, and Initialisms Dictionary_. 
As I recall its introductory materials, it sets out definitions in which acronyms and initialisms are both subsets of the larger body of abbreviations; as has been pointed out, acronyms are pronounced as words (e.g. NASA and UNICEF) and are created from the [usually] first letters of the words in a phrase. 
Initialism is the term given to first-letter abbreviations that are pronouned letter by letter (IBM and FBI). 
The superset of abbreviations includes shortenings that are typically pronounced as the word or phrase they come from (the state of Wisc., Mr. Bob Smith, Jr., etc.); codes that may have little relation to the word they stand for (travelers in the states are familiar with ORD as the code for Chicago O'Hare Airport, the National Weather Service code for Columbus, Ohio is CMH and so on); abbreviations of phrases in one language used for words in another (English language use of 2 lb. 6 oz.) and other miscellany. 
This makes it seem to me that an ACRONYM element is superfluous with a more general ABBR element, and incomplete without it.
