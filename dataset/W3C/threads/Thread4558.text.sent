There are outside requirements to support XQuery on a document node that may contain more than one element besides XSLT. 
The SQL-2003 XML Datatype follows that model. 
Restricting a document node now would not satisfy their requirements either.

On Behalf Of Daniela Florescu Sent: Wednesday, February 18, 2004 12:19 PM Subject: Re: [DM] BEA_006 David, I am not sure I understand your answer. 
Please let me concentrate on the issue that I think will cause more trouble for the future: relaxing the constraints associated with the document node. 
According to this point I only see backwards compatibility issues, not real requirements (XSLT could very easily enforce that documents nodes have to obey Infoset rules). 
With this respect we are in a dilemma: we are either backwards compatibility with XSLT 1.0 or in compatibility with XML itself and Infoset. 
We did choose XSLT 1.0 and ignored XML itself and Infoset. 
That's a strange choice, with unfortunate long term consequences. 
Best regards, Dana What is the rationale for supporting functionality beyond the Infoset: e.g. documents with empty content, with multiple element children, etc ? 
As Michael Kay has said, backward compatibility concerns should mean that removing this functionality is not even under consideration, however this feature is not only there for backward compatibility. 
It is a useful (and much used) feature. 
There is a requirement on XSLT (and any reasonable XML transformation language) to be able to construct external parsed entities as well as complete documents. 
Xpath models these using the same model of a root node (Xpath 1) (Document node in Xpath 2) but without the constraint that there need be exactly one element child, and it similarly merges concepts of an xml declaration on a document and a text declaration on an external parsed entity, and models them both in the same way ie, doesn't model them at all in the data model and generates them based on the same parameters to the serialisation.

- XSLT 1.0 backwards compatibility requires them. 
- SQL-2003 requires them. 
I believe this represents compelling evidence in favor of keeping the existing functionality.
