<s> Well, RDF is a very general standard, similar to XML. Consequently you would first need to create suitable RDF vocabularies with which to express whatever it is that you want to represent in metadata, then the tools to process it.  </s>

<s> PF are helping with this, and in the mean time, for the shear fun of it, I am drafting RDF techniques for WCAG.  </s>
<s> It's objective -to contain generalized techniques to impliment most or all of WCAG 2.0 through RDF.  </s>
<s> It involves going through each checkpoint / success criteria, and seeing how RDF could be used to fulfill each requirement and building the supporting vocabulary.  </s>
<s> Examples: instead of adding and alt tag - having an RDF statement that provides reference to the required extra information This is especially useful for XML legacy languages which may not support alt or long desc Another example, a legacy page without header markup - add an rdf statement similar to: "this element is similar to a H1" I also think it is the best way to address 4.1 I will let you all know when there is a nice draft up.  </s>
