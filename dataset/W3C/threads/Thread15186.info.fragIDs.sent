Is there an RDF techniques document? 
I think RDF could be extremely exciting 
for accessibility. 
Remember that RDF does not have to be written by the author, so that crucial pages could become accessible by the work of care 
givers or volunteers. 
If we are interested in perusing this then I would volunteer to help draft a 
page (preferably with some other people)

Yes, the potential is as vast as the creativity and ingenuity of technology designers. 
Well, RDF is a very general standard, similar to XML. Consequently you would first need to create suitable RDF vocabularies with which to express whatever it is that you want to represent in metadata, then the tools to process it. 
Earl is expressed in RDF and we are planning to use it as one means by which WCAG conformance claims can be made. 
Yes, that is what I am volunteering for, RDF techniques would involve writing a vocabulary for accessibility through RDF.

Or, more likely, multiple vocabularies. 
There is already one for SVG, see SVG Linearization and Accessibility What kind of information would you wish to represent in RDF? 
Have you formulated any requirements? 
Such development may not fall within this working group's Charter, but if there is interest in pursuing it further I am sure a suitable place can be found (perhaps in PF initially, if not in WCAG). 
What we would need at the outset, I suspect, is an indication of the requirements and of the level of interest in working on the proposal. 
Specifically this means that the nature of what the RDF schema are designed to accomplish and the kinds of relationships to be represented therein, would need to be defined at least to the point of making it possible to evaluate the proposal and ascertain the kind of work that would be involved. 
OK, Can I ask you (off the list) for some help with the process?

PF are helping with this, and in the mean time, for the shear fun of it, I am drafting RDF techniques for WCAG. 
It's objective -to contain generalized techniques to impliment most or all of WCAG 2.0 through RDF. 
It involves going through each checkpoint / success criteria, and seeing how RDF could be used to fulfill each requirement and building the supporting vocabulary. 
Examples: instead of adding and alt tag - having an RDF statement that provides reference to the required extra information This is especially useful for XML legacy languages which may not support alt or long desc Another example, a legacy page without header markup - add an rdf statement similar to: "this element is similar to a H1" I also think it is the best way to address 4.1 I will let you all know when there is a nice draft up.
