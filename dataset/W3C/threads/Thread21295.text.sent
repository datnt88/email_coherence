Below is the list of 'de-pinking' I've done. 
I don't see any pink in the doc now! 
The doc is uploaded at[1] ( I'm still not sure about the CVS deal, so I used a different URI, I hope this doesn't cause anyone any problems, if it does, my apologies... ) I get 403 - Forbidden when I de-ref the URI :-( perhaps Hugo/Yves can fix that. 
Just in case they can't I've put another copy at[2] I'm not sure how to update the change log here. 
Henrik made the changes ( but they don't appear in the change log ). 
They're pretty much all rewording/types/clarifications. 
I've not updated the change log with these changes. 
If people feel we should update the change log with some or all of these changes then please either go ahead and update the change log ( feel free to use my initials! ) or I'll update the change log if people would prefer that. 
I release the lock. 
If Marc or Jean-Jacques could let me know when they've got the file at[2] I'll delete it ( currently publically accesible ( not that anyone is likely to guess the URI )) Cheers Gudge [1] http://www.w3.org/2000/xp/Group/1/06/01/soap-02-depinked.html [2] http://marting.develop.com/xmlp/soap-02-depinked.html

I'm still awake ( I'm on the West Coast and it's only 12:30am! ) Gudge frystyk@microsoft.com ; "David Fallside" fallside@us.ibm.com ; www-archive@w3.org ; "Yves Lafon" ylafon@w3.org ; "Hugo Haas" I've got the file at [2]. 
Fixed (note: everytime you create a new document, ask Hugo or me, so we can flip ACL). 
It is now member accessible.
