<s> Behaviour is not up to the user, it is up to the author.  </s>
<s> It is the author/server that has to control what happens when the link is selected by the user.  </s>
<s> Except in rare cases the user should not be able to change the action that selecting a link causes.This is why you must separate presentation from behaviour.  </s>
<s> Note that in Netscape, clicking on a link with the middle mouse button opens the target of tht link in a new window; shift-clicking saves the target to disk.  </s>
<s> These are behaviours chosen by the reader.  </s>
<s> I like this terminology (except for the termini - how the hell do I present Gard du Nord or Waterloo to users?)  </s>
<s> I am beginning to wonder if "terminus" has a non-railway meaning to North Americans???  </s>
<s> It really _is_ awfully comical!  </s>

<s> We tend to steer away from such terminology as "high fallutin' BS".  </s>
<s> OTH, the rate of change in American speech patterns since the invention of mass communications is very high.  </s>
<s> I can't think of any cases off hand when adopting words from dead languages has been much in vogue.  </s>

<s> As far as I know, terminus has no association with railroads for most Americans.  </s>
<s> We call these things "train stations".  </s>
<s> The word "terminus" simply means an end point, if it means anything.  </s>
<s> The hilarity that "terminus" seems to engender in our Friends Across the Sea is probably a good reason to use some other term.  </s>
