I understand that whilst it is not recommended, it is possible to create accessible frames. 
We have a web based application that uses frames to split the screen up so you have a header strip across the top of the screen, a menu strip down the left hand side and then the main area of the screen is split horizontally with listings in the top half of the screen and details in the bottom half of the screen. 
Users select an area to work on from the menu on the left and then browse through the listing to select a particular item that is launched in the details frame. 
Most of the work in the application is based on jumping between the listing and details pages. 
We are just about to redevelop the application in a bid to make it more accessible, however want to try to avoid dropping the use of frames because they are quite integral to the functionality and loosing them will result in a lot more trips to the server and a lot more scrolling of the pages. 
I would be interested to hear your comments.

Unfortunately I'm not completely aware of the accessibility issues with include files, but I know that rather than framesets, I usually build sites referencing an include for what would be the left-hand navigation frame or header frame (for sites built with ASP). 
This allows you to have just 1 file that you are updating with navigation elements etc. and it helps site performance. 
Speaking of which, does anyone know about the accessibility issues with .inc 
files? 
I imagine there are issues I'm unaware of. 
Thanks!

There are no specific concerns with accessibility issues and server-side includes since the file is included before the clients browser sees the code. 
If you go to a website that you know uses server-side includes and you take a look at it's source code, you will notice that the client side has absolutely no idea that the included content was from a separate file.

...Regarding frames, it is my understanding that all you need to do to make the frameset accessible is to use the title attribute on the frameset for each frame. 
But I have no idea how screen readers interpret this.

The problem that screen reader users face is that they can't identify each frame and navigate between them efficiently if they are not coded properly. 
In addition to what Juan mentioned, I would also add a meaningful TITLE to the individual frame pages (make it identical to the TITLE in the frameset). 
This is because Jaws and Window-Eyes for example look at frames in a slightly different way. 
This process ensures that both users have the same experience when navigating the site. 
The screen reader users can pull up a list of frames and navigate to the one they want or simply browse through the frames one after the other by hitting the m key (Jaws) or Ctrl+Tab (W-E). 
Otherwise, they can just navigate the page linearly and every time they reach a frame the screen reader will alert them (frame "title" start) and then alert them again when they reach the end of it (frame "title" end).

About 2 years ago I received a somewhat petulent personal email from a Microsoft employee during a "we hate frontpage" thread on this discussion group (now "in frames" on my office wall as I was so proud to have rattled cages in such hallowed halls!!....it's next to the downright stroppy one from big blue) Anyway, the main problem with frames is you have to keep adding bits to the 
coding, no problem if you know html, but in this drag and drop world we live 
in it is fast becoming a lost art in many everyday web designer circles. 
The more you add to a page the longer it takes to come down the line.....easy when you are on ISDN or Broadband, but many people in digital divide world 
are still on 56k modems....or worse, and say what you like, frames do slow a page down as the server rushes about it's hard drive building the pages when requested to do so. 
And the more you add the longer the process gets. 
Why, put three wings on an aeroplane when one will do the job? 
but they did. 
Why put 4 front wheels on a racing car when the rest of the world made 'em with two? 
but they did. 
However these concepts never lasted. 
Most disabled people in the world that access the internet do not have Jaws, most disabled people in the world that access the internet do not have super fast state of the art computers. 
Do you really want an accessible website or do you want to do the minimum to 
satisfy a piece of unintelligent software and grab the logo?

(no problem if you know html, but in this drag and 
drop world we live in it is fast becoming a lost art in many everyday web designer circles) I would of thought a person would have to know how to 
code or at least know enough to be able to go in and 
add accesskeys, tabindex ect or am I missing out on a piece of software that can do this for me, at the moment the only software I have for this is me and Im getting a bit ragged round the edges :-)

Frames are (or can be) presented to users of screen readers as a list (INS+TAB for Window-Eyes, INS+F9 for JAWS and CTRL+E for HPR); the text in the list should specify the purpose of the frame - like "navigation" and "main content." 
I hope and believe that both Window-Eyes and Jaws will use the title attribute of the Frame element in that list if it is present. 
HPR currently uses the TITLE element of the frame page. 
The biggest problem with frames (as far as access goes, not counting bookmarks etc.) is the fact that IE has it wrong. 
In the example at 
you select a link in the navigation pane, focus STAYS on the navigation pane; it should move to the page that is opened in the main content frame. 
You can check it out. 
HPR was the first to over-ride IE's mistake and place focus where it belongs; I understand that JAWS 5.0 fixes it too. 
But Window-Eyes still leaves focus on the place where the link was activated. 
If IE did it right, then frames would be a pretty nice way of dealing with content for all kinds of AT; but it is broken.

However, as typically implemented, they do prevent page caching. 
Hi, Thanks for the feedback. 
Sorry, I should have said that one should assume that the frames were properly marked up with sensible Title attributes. 
Once the user has got into the main parts of the application, most of the work will consist of moving back and forth between two particular frames. 
Cheers, Julian Voelcker Cirencester, United Kingdom 
Hi, 
Which we do. 
Initially they will be slow to load, but if well implemented once they are loaded they are a lot quicker to use because you are only loading elements of a page as opposed to the whole page, which is particularly attractive when dealing with a very 'feature rich' environment like an on line application. 
Fortunately we know that the disabled people who would be using the system 
would be using screen reader software and hardware that is never likely to be 
more than two years old. 
Not sure what you are on about here. 
Cheers, Julian Voelcker Cirencester, United Kingdom 
Unfortunately include files aren't the solution, although I understand where you are coming from. 
There shouldn't be any because they are just rendering straight html. 
Cheers, 
Julian Voelcker Cirencester, United Kingdom 
Hi Jim, Thanks for the feedback. 
OK, that's useful to know. 
Would it be possible to 'fix' it using Javascript to let the loaded page grab the focus? 
(That's something else I need to know - do screen readers just ignore JavaScript or do some attempt to follow it?)

Thanks Patrick for the clarification. 
In that case it is something that we aren't bothered about.

There is a tendency on this list (always has been) to assume too much knowledge upon the great unwashed. 
This is not a dig at any individual just an observation from a humble salesman who has had to sell web design to company executives (term used loosely). 
I am moving to a Greek island next spring (not spending another cold and damp winter in the UK, my bones are even more frayed!!) and their understanding of what is required on the internet is 5 years behind the UK. 
A couple of weeks back I was seated in a Taverna listening to a very smart Greek girl openly flirting whilst selling web design to a friend of mine who has a hotel in Kefalonia. 
The claims and offers she made were the same misconceptions and errors I made years ago in the .com 
boom days. 
Shame on me, sack cloth and ashes. 
I am a sinner. 
Back here in the UK I am still staggered at the number of small company directors whose next door neighbour has a very talented 16 year old "wot does websites". 
In these not so certain times there is a rapidly growing number of people who armed with their CD rom copy of "everything you need to know about building websites" wrenched off the front of the latest .net 
magazine are setting themselves up as web builders (design not an option, templates provided) and why not?? that's how I started!!! However I hope I have moved on, yet it is these bits of software that provide an impressive and cost effective solution to the unintiated. 
How many of us have sat in offices looking at someone's index page downloading, and on seeing the first bit of a frame declared with a knowledgeable air.."ah!! frames and frontpage, the problem you have with frames is............." Question. 
Was it the way you saw the page download or the template you recognised!!!!? Fact is, you do not need to know one bit of HTML to build a site. 
I trashed 3 computers trying to learn the damn stuff, and still learning....err...don't trash 'em they are expensive to replace. 
In my opinion, one of the main purposes of this group.....is to get a message across. 
Collectively and worldwide budding .com 
millionaires build 
more web pages than this group ever can, what is worse they have never heard of accessibility, W3C, or perish the thought, this group. 
That is not their 
fault,... it is ours. 
Every time you point the accusing finger, there are three more pointing back at yourself. 
It is this group that shares and suggests potential solutions to problems plus individual experiences. 
Within the list we preach to the converted but it is a safe environment where us birds can flock and endorse our own theories and beliefs, whilst impressing our peers with a clever bit of coding and dare I say it ......a little self promotion??!! Everyday I spend on this list my learning curve get steeper and long may that be so. 
But the fact remains, more pages are uploaded to the web by people who do not know HTML than the other way round. 
Long post, but go on smile at someone and make their day! 
there are a few different icons available, and my original comments were not made with any one person in mind more to the general public that monitor this group's discussions, and there are a few. 
If I gave offence to you Julian please accept apologies, not aimed at you personally, sort of present company excepted mode.. smiles Paul 
but the real question is "does the frame and feature rich environment" actually add real usefulness to the site??? or are they just "eye candy" 
how do you know this?? 
my computer is just updated with the latest P-IV and super fast etc etc etc, but won't work worth beans on frames, why because I still like and use LYNX for surfing the web.

Paul, as much as I enjoyed your long story, I really fail to see the point you're trying to make. 
Should we abandon accessible features of HTML because WYSIWYG tools do not fully support them yet ? 
In that case, we could have given up the whole idea of web content accessibility a few years ago, when none of the leading tools was doing *anything* with regards to outputting clean, accessible markup. 
Not having a dig or anything, just trying to understand what you're actually getting at ?

Hi Bob, 
It's or a complex on line database application, using frames makes it a lot easier for splitting up the data enabling us to display/modify subsets of the data without having to refresh everything on the screen. 
The application is being deployed to a closed group of users in a corporate 
environment so we know what they are using and can to a degree dictate a minimum software/hardware specification 
We are just looking now at altering the application to make it accessible in case we have a user in the future with disabilities.

then the intranet provider (company) would need to provide the appropriate software and equipment to access the site by their users, including all people with disabilities, at no cost to the user in excess of what they may be chargeing every other user. 
of course that is USA rules I think the UK rules are similar, but YMMV

certainly not many of the people we are attempting to reach.

no,no,no,no never ever.

I suspect you have a conflict with the other company's lawyers. 
I happened to see some advice from one of the UK accountancy professional bodies which said: - you should always have one of these horrible confidentiality/disclaimer notices on email; - there is an arguable case that such a notice is only legally effective if the recipient is forced to see it before seeing the content, and that it might, therefore, be advisable to make the real content an attachment. 
I would speculate that the email in question was using both rules. 
As far as I am concerned, such notices are often devalued by being used in contexts like this list, and devalue email by destroying its spontaneity, with the result that people move to "instant messaging" to get back the original email concept. 
(On the other hand, your failure to include a disclaimer, and use of the company name as your user name in the email, has misled me, in the past, to think that your postings are on behalf of Access Systems. 
In my view using your personal name in the From line should break the link, but company lawyers tend to want more. 
You may well be caught up in your own company bureaucracy. 
In fact, you do have a short version of the common legal notice, although, strangely, it is only the confidentiality part, when the "does not represent the company view" part appeared first. 
I no longer post from the office, partly because of such a notice.) 
True screen readers are scripting agnostic as they simply work in terms of what is rendered visually. 
The dominant corporate use Assistive 
Technology is an IE bolt on using MSAA; it's not a screen reader. 
It will inherit the IE scripting of the page. 
(Whilst agnostic, a true screen reader may well be a text mode program and be used with a text mode browser; it is difficult to reconstruct the text output by an uncooperative GUI application. 
Current text mode browsers have no scripting capability or only recognize particular idioms in scripts, rather than interpreting the script from first principle. 
Dead links as a result of poping up new windows with scripting is one of the commonest idioms causing problems, so several variations are probably emulated by text browsers that work by idioms.) 
Hi David, 
OK. 
That's interesting. 
Do you know if there are any sites giving a breakdown of the different screen readers/assistive technology and what they can support?
