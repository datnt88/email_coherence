I created a page to see how screen readers work with alternative text in a Java applet (www.webaim.org/tutorials/uofa/java/news_good.htm). 
When I tested the page using JAWS 3.5, the JAWS read the content I added within the applet tags. 
When I tested the page using Homepage Reader 3.0, HPR read the alt tag of the opening applet tag and skipped the content I had added to the applet. 
Is there a setting in HPR which tells it to read the content between the applet tags? 
Is my mark-up correct for the applet tag?

Does HPR 3.0 no longer support the deprecated applet tag? 
I suggest you use the HPR mailing list for the question you are asking about HPR. 
You subscribe to the list by sending a note to requests@talklist.com, and the body of the note should say "subscribe ibm-hpr yourName" without any quotes and filling in yourname. 
Once you have done that you can send a note to ibm-hpr@talklist.com with your question.
