<s> I'm getting artifacts on pages with gif images, usually some kind of noise (bars).  </s>
<s> They are transitory, in that they disappear and reappear elsewhere when I scroll down - they tend to appear over whitespace.  </s>
<s> Haven't tried to reproduce or break down yet.  </s>
<s> Pages with a META REFRESH tag seem not to be working; is it possible this is a bug, or is there something I don't know about support for them?  </s>

<s> [DJW:] There is no such HTTP header as Refresh!  </s>
<s> Also, META http-equiv elements are supposed to be instructions to the server, not the browser.  </s>
<s> The Windows binary leaves lines on the display.  </s>
<s> I will try it on a different computer to see if it has the same problem.  </s>
