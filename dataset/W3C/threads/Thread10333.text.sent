I've just realized that I haven't received any email from the RDFcore list since about 10 April... I seem to have been silently dropped from the mailing list, so I'm seriously behind on what's been happening. 
Is there any way I can have lost mail resent to me? 
Not having broadband internet access, and because of the way my systems are configured, reading and dealing with mail online via a web browser is seriously inconvenient for me.

I have filesystem access to the mail archives, could roll up a tarball of April's message. 
[..] OK, http://tux.w3.org/~danbri/rdfcore/rdfcore.tar.gz (20 days, 1 msg per file) hope that helps... Maybe you can cat the files together into an mbox archive that's locally readable? 
Dan I think I figured what's happened... my previous list subscription was via my ex-employer's mail system, but forwarded to my personal mailbox, so I didn't notice. 
I think they finally got round to pulling the plug on my old email address. 
Got'em, thanks... Now I just have to read through before the telecon.
