The deleted I-D appears to be a mistake. 
I've just sent a message to the I-D editor, but due to the IETF meeting in progress it may not be seen for a while. 
Anyway, my understanding and recollection is that the MIME type registration does refer to the Concepts document. 
I'll digest and contemplate the other points separately.

Dear RDF WG, This is a slightly late, personal, last call comment, about section 7 (Fragment Identifiers) of the Concepts document. 
I have been reading this several times, and have been thinking about it for quite a while, but don't think I can tell you exactly how I think it should work. 
But I have a few comments for improvement. 
Please note that this is not about topics such as 'meaning of URIs' (although at some places, it may look like it gets near to it), it's more technical. 
1) Given the central role of the Concepts document for RDF, and the central role of URIrefs, including fragment identifiers, for RDF, I think it's not a good idea to have draft-swartz-rdfcore-rdfxml-mediatype-xx.txt 
define how fragment identifiers work, and the Concepts draft refer to it. 
It should be the other way round. 
[W3C is working together with the IETF on being able to include MIME type registrations directly in W3C Recs, and depending on timing, that may happen for RDF, but that still leaves the question of where in the document the fragment identifiers would be defined. 
In addition, it seems the draft has expired. 
At txt, I get: This Internet-Draft has been deleted. 
Unrevised documents placed in the Internet-Drafts directories have a maximum life of six months. 
After that time, they are deleted. 
This Internet-Draft was not published as an RFC. 
Internet-Drafts are not an archival document series, and expired drafts, such as this one, are not available; please do not ask for copies... they are not available. 
The Secretariat does not have information as to future plans of the authors or working groups WRT the deleted Internet-Draft. 
For more information or a copy of the document, contact the author directly.

That makes it difficult to comment on some aspects, but I'll try anyway. 
2) The section should not use namespace notation (eg:someurl#frag), because it is confusing (there is no place in actual RDF/XML, for example, where a qname with a fragid can appear). 
3) The section should talk about other media types and other potential rdf formats. 
For RDF to work, I think that all media types that encode RDF data have to use the same conventions for fragment identifiers. 
This may be done in a rather cursory fashion, but it shouldn't be left out, to avoid the impression that each potential new type would be totally free to use different #fragid semantics. 
4) As a special case of 3), and more in need of actual spec language, is the case of RDF fragments embedded in other media types. 
A typical example would be image/svg+xml. 
It has its own rules for fragment identifiers, but it should say that the RDF fragments it may include should be interpreted (including fragment ids) according to the rules of RDF. 
Section 7 should say something to that effect, in a general way, but clear and easy enough for other specs to pick it up. 
This may also include some discussion about the case that a fagment id is used both in the RDF part and in the e.g. SVG part of a document. 
The advice for this case should be that this is a bad idea unless the RDF with that ID is metadata about the SVG with that id. 5) In connection with 4), the sentence "So when eg:someurl#frag is used in an RDF document, eg:someurl is taken to designate some RDF document (even when no such document can be retrieved)." should be modified to take care of cases such as embedded RDF in image/svg+xml. 
6) editorial: "(itself, at least, also any other Web retrievable URIs that it may use, possibly including schema URIs and references to other RDF documents)" should read: "(itself, at least, but also any other Web retrievable URIs that it may use, possibly including schema URIs and references to other RDF documents)" 7) In general, the issues here point to the fact that simply saying "a fragment identifier is defined by the MIME type of the document pointed to" (not exactly what the text says, but what it is often thought to say) is rather inaccurate. 
It is well known that the function of URIs depends both on the context where they are found and on the thing they point to. 
Obvious examples are img src='...'/ , style sheet links, and so on. 
This also applies to fragment identifiers. 
As an example, it is the a href='...'/ context that decides that the target document should (usually) replace the current document, and the browser should *jump to* what it manages to identify (based on the mime type) as the fragment identifier. 
[this may be something that the TAG may also have to pick up] Regards, Martin.

Thinking about items 2-7 of Martin's email. 
These comments, particularly item 3, seem to indicate that Martin is missing the point. 
According to the approach described in Concepts, different MIME types are free to adopt their own fragid handling (I avoid saying 'semantics' here). 
This isn't so much a decision as a recognition of the real world out there. 
Which suggests that some editorial clarification may be needed. 
BUT: 
(a) this section has already been the subject of a fair amount of active 
debate during the first last call period, and (b) the formal semantics leave no room for alternative treatments of fragment identifiers as they appear in an RDF graph, and this is just an explanatory section that attempts to explain how that view is not at odds with the conventional web-retrieval view. 
THEREFORE: I propose that we do not put the publication schedule and consensus already 
developed at risk by trying to address Martin's editorial points in the short period available to us. 
Instead, I suggest that careful editorial work be undertaken for publication in an errata document, and subsequently in a revised publication of the Concepts document.

Would you please phrase that proposal in the form of a draft response to Martin? 
Then the chairs can judge whether it's consistent with the proceedings of the WG and responsive to the comment.

I'm just catching up on a backlog of things-to-do... this comment didn't make it as a formal LC comment, so I don't think it makes sense to invoke formal process for it. 
I don't plan to take any further action at this time, other than to try and prepare the ground for the MIME Content Type registration.
