Home Site is totally customizable. 
If something doesn't work the way you need, you likely can change it. 
HTML Validator, Tag completion, Color syntax-highlighting, etc are all customizable. 
Coding in Home Site is done by hand, and verified to be proper HTML using the built-in CSE 3310 HTML Validator, which you can easily modify. 
The problem is that the built-in validator isn't a real validator. 
In the 
SGML world, a validator checks a document against a DTD, but CSE does not do this, and the result is that some valid HTML 4.0 documents are considered invalid by CSE and some invalid HTML 4.0 documents are considered valid by CSE. 
The result is that it's no longer possible to simply recommend that authors validate their HTML. 
One now has to qualify the statement by naming real validators (such as the WDG [1] or W3C [2] validators). 
I've run across many authors looking for help who "validated" their documents only with CSE when validating with a real validator would have solved their problem.

Yes, you are correct. 
It is relatively accurate. 
It is far more accurate than not having any form of validator. 
My standard practice is to markup a document completely using CSE 3310 in HomeSite. 
When finished, I will run it through the W3C validator to catch any stray errors like missing or incorrect attributes, invalid entities, etc. 
I fix the errors then 
revalidate just to be sure. 
Not as pretty as having a built-in sgmls. 
However, usable. 
When in doubt, I refer to the W3C for the correct answer. 
It is a matter of knowing where to look when an error occurs. 
In my mind, 
W3C is always the definitive source.

That's great--it's how CSE should be used. 
The problem is that many people assume that using two validators would be redundant so they just use CSE and miss the critical step of real validation. 
FWIW, the W3C Validator is not infallible. 
Take, for example, the 
following three URLs: 
These pages are all valid HTML 4.0, but the W3C Validator disagrees. 
(The WDG HTML Validator [1] correctly declares these pages to be valid.)

That's true, because the current W3C HTML Validation Service doesn't understand various character encoding schemes, such as ISO-2022-JP. 
We know that, and we are trying to internationalize the validator. 
Unfortunately, we haven't got the time to work on it so far ... 
That's true, and as Daniel said, some folks are trying to fix it. 
I'm sure this is valid, because I wrote it and validated it ;-) BTW, though WDG HTML Validator found no errors in the following document: but actually it's not valid. 
It's syntactically correct, but its character encoding doesn't match declared charset. 
HTTP response header says it's encoded in ISO-2022-JP, but actually it's encoded in Shift_JIS. 
The result is devastating; it makes the document totally unreadable when one uses a browser which respects charset parameter. 
Some browsers in Japanese Windows platform can read it regardless of the charset parameter when it's encoded in Shift_JIS, so sometimes authors don't realize this problem. 
Anyway, declaring correct character encoding scheme is critical to make your documents accessible.

Sad but true, that's where education is needed. 
An understanding of how things should work will always be better than allowing a validator to make your final decision. 
At this point, I can say with some confidence that there isn't any program that validates HTML perfectly. 
It is mostly a matter of little oversights. 
The humans need to know what they are doing, in other words. 
A combination of good tools (maybe not even perfect) and an understanding of how to use them properly will always be best. 
An ignorant user and a good tool will rarely achieve much more than mediocrity. 
An informed user and a bad or degraded tool has a much better chance.

Well, actually I should have been clearer. 
I am referring to the W3C specs not the validator. 
I wouldn't blindly trust the validator on a particular issue if I thought it was wrong. 
Many folks probably would, though. 
I will have a look at the WDG validator. 
A second check never hurts.
