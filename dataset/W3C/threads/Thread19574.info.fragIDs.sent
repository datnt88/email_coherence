Since so many of us web designers/implementors use the Macintosh, I wonder wht the W3C is depriving itself of feedback from this important community by not having a Mac version of Amaya. 
Was this a conscious decision and, if so, what was the rationale for it? 
The only reason is lack of manpower. 
The (small) Amaya team at W3C supports two series of platforms: Unix and Windows, and in each serie several variants. 
The team is already spending a significant part of the time solving portability issues and can't afford supporting an additional platform. 
We obviously recognize the impact of Macintosh users and developers on the Web, and we are very eager to see a Macintosh version of Amaya. 
Macintosh developers are encouraged to have a look at Amaya and to consider doing the port. 
Amaya is open source and uptodate code 
is always available through the open CVS base. 
Any volonteer?

Funny you should mention a Mac port. 
I spent last weekend doing a first pass of porting the Amaya source to the Mac. 
Based on my initial experiences I think there is little point continuing with this project unless some serious questions are answered about how much tidying up of the code base can be done. 
I found the source files littered with conditional compile directives, more than two hundred. 
All these directives need to be migrated to either header files, or conditional #define's, before I would consider it to be a worthwhile project finishing the mac port. 
I say this as someone who has been a profession commercial shrinkwrap developer for 16 years, 15 years Mac, 10 years Windows, and who has ported apps between the Mac, Windows, and Unix for the last 7 years. 
I've seen lots of multi-platform code bases and have found some very effecive techniques for isolating platform specific code, and for making multi-platform code much more maintainable. 
Based on my initial inspection of the source code it seems like a fairly reasonable quick and dirty port to Windows. 
The main problem with this approach is that while two platforms can be supported and maintained without too much grief, adding a third platform to the mix is usually enough to make the code base very difficult to maintain for the third platform, and usually has a negative impact on support for the first two platforms as well. 
If the Amaya code base was presented to me by a client I would advise them to use the opportunity to do a serious design review of the code base, to make sure that all platform dependent functionality had migrated to a platform services layer, and that this layer was then implimented in a platform neutral manner. 
From what I can see the Amaya code base is a lot closer to this ideal than a lot of the commercial application code bases I've worked on over the years. 
I dont know if this is the correct forum to discuss in more detail what could be done to make the code base more portable, and what would be involved in getting it working on the mac. 
But I would be more than willing to discuss further what would be involved in a Mac port, as I, for one, would love to have Amaya up and running on the Mac. - Joseph McConnell San Francisco, Ca 
Could somebody post the location, userid/password, etc of the open CVS repository for Amaya? 
Thanks.

In-reply-to: Your message of Fri, 18 Jun 1999 17:10:33 -0400." 
We're preparing a new release of Amaya (version 2.1). 
With that new release, we're improving the CVS base access to make user's live easier. 
All instructions to build Amaya from the CVS base will be given too. 
If you see http://dev.w3.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/ today it could work but you will download too many material than needed to compile Amaya. 
Please wait 2 or 3 days for the next release :-) Regards Irene.
