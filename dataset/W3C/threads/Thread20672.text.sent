I have compiled and installed amaya-4.3.2 on top of Solaris 2.7 with lesstif-0.92.26. 
Works fine, as usual. 
Between amaya-4.3 and this new version, we have now &amp;times; and &amp;divide; working, but &amp;oelig; and &amp;OElig; don't work any more (on printed paper). 
How can we make these 2 characters work again? 
If we respect the ISO-latin standard, these characters don't exist. 
To solve the problem we patched ISO-latin-1 fonts, but &amp;times; and &amp;divide; didn't work. 
The right solution is to use oe and OE or to wait for the support of Unicode. 
Irene. 
&amp;inodot; should be not working either. 
However, &amp;#144; can catch it. 
For those who still want &amp;oelig; and &amp;OElig; on paper, modify thotlib/editing/print.c: - replace all "ISOLatin1Encoding" by "ISOLatin1Encodinh" - replace two /.notdef in front of /dotlessi by /OE and /oe &amp;OElig; and &amp;oelig; get printed if you use &amp;#142; and &amp;#143; (it works on paper only)
