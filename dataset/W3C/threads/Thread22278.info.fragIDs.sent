<s> The XML APIs are now part of the "Core".  </s>
<s> There is a caveat in certain interfaces that HTML-only products don't need to implement them (e.g., EntityReference).  </s>
<s> NodeIterator was removed from the Level 1 spec; something like it will return in Level 2. In the meantime, use NodeList.  </s>
<s> Mike Champion  </s>
<s> It's actually rather easy to implement TreeIterator using the various parent, child, and sibling attributes of Node.  </s>
<s> It is also trivial to implement a NodeIterator for the children of a node.  </s>
<s> The thing that's difficult is to get an instance of the correct iterator class from a NodeList; a generic iterator that just keeps track of an index and uses "item" is likely to be extremely inefficient.  </s>
<s> However, I believe there are very few places where you can't use navigation (and hence an iterator) instead of using a NodeList.  </s>
<s> The bottom line is that if you're working in a language that lets you define your own classes (i.e. not JavaScript), you can simply implement your own iterators and use them where they're appropriate.  </s>
<s> This will have the additional advantage that if iterators _do_ come back, you won't be stuck with whatever baggage the spec includes that your application doesn't need.  </s>

<s> This points out _precisely_ the problem that the people working on the DOM spec seem to have.  </s>
<s> You want node lists, iterators, and so on to do ``the right thing'' in all possible circumstances -- deletions, additions, moves, multithreading, and so on.  </s>
<s> The problem is that ``the right thing'' varies with the use you're putting the thing to.  </s>
<s> Nodelists want to be ``live'' when you're executing Javascript inside a browser and you want to start executing the script while the document is loading.  </s>
<s> Never mind that using getNextSibling would be more appropriate.  </s>
<s> Under _all_ other circumstances, nodelists that behave like static arrays are more useful.  </s>
<s> Under _all_ circumstances, node arrays are more efficient, more predictable, easier to understand, and easier to implement.  </s>
<s> Simple iterators that keep track of the current node and perform a depth-first left-to-right traversal are useful, efficient, and predictable when used for tree traversal, searching, and so on.  </s>
<s> They behave _predictably_ when the tree is modified during an iteration; whether this behavior is ``correct'' or not depends entirely on what the programmer has  </s>
<s> been led to expect.  </s>
<s> Iterators that keep track of both the current node and the ``next'' node in the traversal work better for deletion, but have to be more careful about insertion.  </s>
<s> It's perfectly acceptable, in my opinion, to state that the behavior of an iterator or a nodelist is undefined under certain circumstances, or to provide multiple iterator types for multiple purposes.  </s>
<s> At this point I'm probably going to stop hoping that iterators get back into the DOM at some point, and instead count on programmers to design appropriate classes of their own that don't depend on whatever bizarre single-application-specific behavior somebody decides to throw into the spec because they think they know better than I do what my application wants to do with a parse tree.  </s>

<s> I'm not sure I understand the meaning of "correct" vs. "predictable" here.  </s>
<s> If the implementation is understood to be single-threaded, then  </s>
<s> all behaviors are "predictable" no matter how bizarre, since none of the node operations do arbitrary computation.  </s>
<s> But even under a single- threaded interpretation, various "obvious identities" do not hold: (leftSibling(rightSibling(node)) = node, unless node is a lastChild; (rightSibling(leftSibling(node)) = node,  </s>
<s> unless node is a firstChild; (firstChild(parent(node)) = node, if node is a firstChild; (lastChild(parent(node)) = node, if node is a lastChild; (rightSibling(firstChild(node)) = 2nd child of node provided there is one, the algorithm "go to firstChild if there is one, otherwise to rightSibling if there is one, otherwise to parent's (grandparent's (great-grandparents (etc.))) rightSibling until you reach the starting point" walks the descendants.  </s>
<s> etc. etc. etc.  </s>
<s> All of these are false under the DOM.  </s>
<s> The difficulty is that the DOM is not a parse tree according to the meaning of the act; it is a tree-like API which provides access to an underlying implementation that may or may not look like a parse tree.  </s>

<s> (NOTE: The casual reader will find the main point of this message in the last two paragraphs.)  </s>
<s> ``Predictable'' means that it does what a programmer of average competence would expect it to do given a quick perusal of the specification. `` ``Correct'' '' (note that the _original_ was in quotes) means that it does what the application writer requires it to do in order to make the application work correctly.  </s>
<s> I do not understand your point.  </s>
<s> They certainly hold as far as I can tell; the classic algorithm for traversing a tree is:  </s>
<s> traverse(node) { visit(node); if (node.firstChild != null) traverse(node.firstChild); if (node.nextSibling != null) traverse(node.nextSibling);  </s>
<s> That had darned-well _better_ work in the DOM.  </s>
<s> It's also trivial to transform this into an iterator with "node" as its instance variable: class depthFirst { Node node; Node toNext() { if (node.firstChild != null) { node = node.firstChild;  </s>
<s> return node; } else { while (node.nextSibling == null) { node = node.parent;  </s>
<s> if (node == null) return null; node = node.nextSibling;  </s>
<s> return node; A competent programmer can easily look at this code, or a well-written specification of it, and predict that it will behave oddly if the document gets modified out from under it.  </s>
<s> It's even completely straightforward to accurately predict exactly _how_ it will behave (for example, if I delete the node, the iterator will return null on the next call to toNext).  </s>
<s> Piling additional complication into the specification in order to ensure that every node in the tree will continue to be visited no matter what gets done between calls to "toNext", which I believe is what the last spec that included iterators attempted to do, is WRONG, because it makes the simple implementation impossible and because it becomes too complicated for a programmer looking at the spec to guess how it's going to behave.  </s>
<s> It also becomes next to impossible to specify _correctly_, because English is such a lousy programming language (and predicate calculus is almost as bad).  </s>
<s> If it quacks like a duck and waddles like a duck otherwise behaves like a duck, then you can't tell that it isn't a duck.  </s>
<s> (I think it was Alan Kay who said that.) The API is designed to have an obvious model that looks like a parse tree.  </s>
<s> Any programmer, looking at that API, will ``see'' the parse tree in her mind's eye and be able to make intuitive and accurate predictions about how it will behave.  </s>
<s> Moreover, any programmer who wants to implement parse trees in a portable and standardized way will take a superficial look at the DOM, and decide to use it as the API for their parse trees.  </s>
<s> They will then discover that, in the details of the specification, the intuitive view of the DOM as the API for tree-structured documents is WRONG, and that a great deal of non-obvious machinery has to be added in order to make it work.  </s>
<s> To the extent that the ``obvious'' (perhaps it would be better to use ``natural'') model fails to fit an actual implementation, the specification is a failure.  </s>
<s> Things like live nodelists and the children of EntityReference nodes (it would be much simpler if they didn't have any) violate the natural model, and hence are bugs in the specification.  </s>
<s> One is constantly having to say ``yes, this thing quacks like a duck and waddles like a duck and otherwise fits the API of a duck, but in order to meet the taste restrictions it has to be a turkey''.  </s>
<s> I'm going to go a little further, and define ``natural model.'' The natural model of an interface is a class in which all attributes are represented by instance variables, and no other instance variables are present.  </s>
<s> In other words, there are no ``hidden variables'' (in the quantum-mechanical sense).  </s>
<s> There is a similar concept in mathematics.  </s>
<s> My claim is that any specification for which the natural model is not a valid implementation is either incomplete (hidden variables have to be added) or incorrect (it will lead both users and implementors astray).  </s>
<s> It is acceptable for a specification to be incomplete (e.g. a specification for an iterator or a map _should_ leave out the implementation details), but it is simply _not acceptable_ for the natural model or an extension of it not to be a correct implementation of the specification.  </s>
<s> It's simply asking for trouble.  </s>

<s> The trouble with that algorithm is that it is recursive.  </s>
<s> It will blow up if the tree is sufficiently deep.  </s>
<s> Indeed, in languages that cannot be relied on to do tail recursion, like Java, it will blow up if the tree is merely sufficiently wide.  </s>
<s> Furthermore, if there is any end-of-node processing to do, such as emitting an end tag indication, then the algorithm is no longer even partly tail recursive and will blow up on both depth and width even in safe-tail-recursion languages.  </s>
<s> The algorithm I use in DOMParser, therefore, is non-recursive: traverse(Node node) { Node currentNode = node; while (currentNode != null) { visit(currentNode); // Move down to first child Node nextNode = currentNode.getFirstChild();  </s>
<s> if (nextNode != null) { currentNode = nextNode; continue; // No child nodes, so walk tree while (currentNode != null) { revisit(currentNode)// do end-of-node processing, if any // Move to sibling if possible.  </s>
<s> nextNode = currentNode.getNextSibling();  </s>
<s> if (nextNode != null) { currentNode = nextNode; break; // Move up if (currentNode = node) currentNode = null; else currentNode = currentNode.getParentNode();  </s>
<s> Because of the reliability of this algorithm vis-a-vis the recursive one, I believe it should be the standard way of walking DOM trees, and therefore it is essential that DOM implementations make the structural access methods fast.  </s>

<s> John Cowan wrote,  </s>
<s> Even with a remove() operation on the iterator class, this will still cause serious problems, because i will be invalidated every time a node is removed via j.  </s>
<s> Agreed.  </s>
<s> But other solutions are hardly better, since they involve using remove operations with at best O(log n) behavior.  </s>
<s> 1) You can't win; 2) You can't even break even.  </s>
<s> Yes you can ... We just have ultra simple iterators, and *document* the conditions under which they remain valid, and rely on programmers being smart enough to know when those conditions hold and when they don't, or being able to ensure they hold (with manual updates or synchronization, or whatever).  </s>
<s> I you're worried about the 'naive scripters' ... well, maybe they should just be warned away from iterators ... if they _really_ are as naive as all that (which I doubt).  </s>
