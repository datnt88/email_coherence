<s> The W3C's draft techniques document for Accessibility Evaluation and Repair Tools at http://www.w3.org/TR/AERT#color-contrast provides an algorithm for testing to see if text and background colours provide sufficient contrast.  </s>
<s> The document indicates, however, that the algorithm is a "suggested" one that is "still open to change".  </s>
<s> Can anyone shed any light on whether this should be considered as a reliable indicator of colour contrast, or whether some more authoritative/reliable algorithm exists?  </s>
<s> Reason for my question: sponsors/clients of a project I am currently working on believe that the requirements are too stringent.  </s>
<s> This view was expressed after I used the algorithm to generate a report on a range of colour options that were being considered--very few of them passed muster, as I expected.  </s>
<s> I would be extremely grateful for any advice or references to other resources/expert opinions.  </s>

<s> That issue cannot be programmatically determined, full stop.  </s>
<s> Every visually-impaired person is different.  </s>
<s> It's *not* like colour deficiency, which has well-understood patterns and easy-to-follow accommodations.  </s>
<s> Cf.:  </s>
<s> No and no.  </s>
<s> The correct accommodation method is for an author to provide a means of altering colours, as with a stylesheet-switcher.  </s>
<s> The visitor can also adjust browser controls or employ a user stylesheet including !important declarations.  </s>

<s> Certainly for text and backgrounds.  </s>
<s> However, for inside images (i.e., logos, diagrams, photos, etc.) it's another matter.  </s>
<s> To be able to reduce the need for certain users to have to purchase special hardware or software, I believe it is good guidance to give image designer and creators "contrast" as a criteria to always consider.  </s>
<s> Of course that is not always possible, for example when the image is actually a photograph (i.e., individual or scene), except for better lighting, there not much else one can do about reality.  </s>
