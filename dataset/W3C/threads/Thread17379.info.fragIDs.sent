The W3C's draft techniques document for Accessibility Evaluation and Repair Tools at http://www.w3.org/TR/AERT#color-contrast provides an algorithm for testing to see if text and background colours provide sufficient contrast. 
The document indicates, however, that the algorithm is a "suggested" one that is "still open to change". 
Can anyone shed any light on whether this should be considered as a reliable indicator of colour contrast, or whether some more authoritative/reliable algorithm exists? 
Reason for my question: sponsors/clients of a project I am currently working on believe that the requirements are too stringent. 
This view was expressed after I used the algorithm to generate a report on a range of colour options that were being considered--very few of them passed muster, as I expected. 
I would be extremely grateful for any advice or references to other resources/expert opinions. 
Cheers, Dey 
That issue cannot be programmatically determined, full stop. 
Every visually-impaired person is different. 
It's *not* like colour deficiency, which has well-understood patterns and easy-to-follow accommodations. 
Cf.: 
No and no. 
The correct accommodation method is for an author to provide a means of altering colours, as with a stylesheet-switcher. 
The visitor can also adjust browser controls or employ a user stylesheet including !important declarations.

Certainly for text and backgrounds. 
However, for inside images (i.e., logos, diagrams, photos, etc.) it's another matter. 
To be able to reduce the need for certain users to have to purchase special hardware or software, I believe it is good guidance to give image designer and creators "contrast" as a criteria to always consider. 
Of course that is not always possible, for example when the image is actually a photograph (i.e., individual or scene), except for better lighting, there not much else one can do about reality.
