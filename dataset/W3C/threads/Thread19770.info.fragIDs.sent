<s> Hi ted, Thanks for information.  </s>
<s> Did you attach specific function to the double-click with your olwm manager ?  </s>
<s> We run olwm on local stations here and we've never met this kind of trouble.  </s>
<s> Irene.  </s>
<s> Irene, This system is a new install and I'd done nothing to olwm except add a few items to the menu.  </s>
<s> When I started amaya I couldn't even get the link to the docs to work.  </s>
<s> Then I connected to my own web site and couldn't get any of the links there to work.  </s>
<s> I don't know if it means anything to you,  </s>
<s> but I had problems with arena also.  </s>
<s> In arena I couldn't give it a URL.  </s>
<s> I eventually noticed that when I typed in the location window the keystrokes were showing up in an xterm window.  </s>
<s> I noticed no other problems with olwm with any other program, including netscape navigator version 4. All these problems cleared up when I switched back to fvwm.  </s>

<s> I reported this same problem right after the first release of Amaya 1.1 for Linux-ELF.  </s>
<s> I don't believe I ever received a response to my report.  </s>
<s> I was running olwm on Linux 2.0.27.  </s>
<s> The system simply ignored all double-clicks, regardless of the location of the html document.  </s>
<s> I tried adjusting the mouse timing settings in olwm, with no effect.  </s>
<s> I never fixed the problem with olwm.  </s>
<s> I switched to the Lesstif clone of mwm and Amaya worked ok.  </s>
