<s> In lieu of my doing anything genuinely useful with circles, rectangles and arrows, I've posted a diagram of the 0.9 schema here : The picture was generated with Protege-2000 (my favourite toy at the moment) using the Ontoviz (Graphviz) plugin.  </s>

<s> Neat! I already hacked up a simple view of the data model, linked to from:- but it hasn't got anywhere near as much detail as your version.  </s>

<s> I particularly like the furry animal representing the open issue w/dates (at least that's what i'm assuming...) If you've used Graphviz, isn't that the product from AT&amp;T that can generate SVG?  </s>
<s> If so, I agree Sean, link to it, particularly if we have it as both a gif and svg.  </s>

<s> Of course: that's why "Person" is a *sub* class of "Assertor", not daml:sameClassAs.  </s>
<s> From the 0.9 N3 schema [1]:- earl:Person a rdfs:Class; rdfs:subClassOf earl:Assertor .  </s>
<s> Has this not come across in the graph somewhere?  </s>
<s> Hmm... is says "Person isA Assertor", which I guess means that all instances of person are also instances of Assertor.  </s>
<s> While that's correct, it should be noted that this isn't the only sub class allowed.  </s>
<s> The whole point of rdfs:subClassOf is that as well as being a transitive property (as indicated in the graph), it's also a refining mechanism - it allows you to specialize super classes.  </s>

<s> like the graph but think it could be made even simpler (like: why repeating the "hasName, hasPlatform, etc" in the box *and* as label for arrows ?). would be good also to have something linking the 2 "pieces" together.  </s>
<s> good point - what purpose does the 'Person' class serve apart from providing the email address?  </s>
<s> could this be provided by the Address class, dropping 'Person' altogether?  </s>
<s> Though if the Assertor is a person, then another word is probably needed for 'Platform' or just have value : Windows/Linux/Flesh ;-) Danny Ayers  </s>
<s> Ignore my previous comment about dropping Person - Sean's perfectly right here, I was also misreading the diagram... Danny Ayers  </s>
