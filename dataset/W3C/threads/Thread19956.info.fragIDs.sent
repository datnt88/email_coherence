<s> I just installed Amaya 2.5pre on Linux-Mandrake 7.0.  </s>
<s> I notice that the bug that had kept me from using 2.4 is fixed (structure view hangs when text  </s>

<s> Thanks.  </s>
<s> I am surprised, however, that there is no obvious way I can bookmark like Lynx and Netscape allow.  </s>
<s> I think that functionality would make Amaya much  </s>
<s> easier to use for bringing in source material from scattered sites from time to time.  </s>
<s> Will we see bookmarking soon?  </s>
<s> Thanks.  </s>

<s> As Amaya is an authoring tool, it's very easy to create and edit a page HotList.html.  </s>
<s> We considered that was enough.  </s>
<s> Do you think we have to add special functions for managing a default HotList.html?  </s>

<s> Besides the usual releases and pre-releases, could you have automated daily CVS snapshots?  </s>
<s> Then, when a mention is made on this list of a bug being fixed in, or feature added to, the CVS we can try it soon without having to deal with CVS, or wait a few months.  </s>
<s> A running CVS change log and bug/feature list would then be useful, too.  </s>
<s> Another approach is a Web UI to CVS.  </s>
<s> I don't know much about that, though.  </s>
<s> Thank you.  </s>

<s> I would appreciate it if this were possible.  </s>
<s> I would like to try out the CVS version which has the fix for the bug I reported, but I feel that I cannot allocate the time to learning CVS, which is a flexible, and therefore compliecated, system.  </s>
<s> Ftp or http access would suit me.  </s>
<s> I know that to make the CVS versions as easy to install as the releases would be extra work, but I think this would give you more people able to offer you relevant bug reports and, possibly, fixes.  </s>
<s> I applaud this constructive suggestion.  </s>
