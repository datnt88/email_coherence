The entire intent of this requirement was extensibility. 
We wanted to ensure that implementors wouldn't add code that rejected a MKCOL immediately if it had a request body, since this would make future extension of MKCOL impossible. 
In that case IE5 needs to fix this. 
:-) IE5 closes the connection before even reading the body. 
It apparently is not prepared to accept a multi-status response.

I had been thinking this was a server-side extensibility issue. 
I don't think it's unreasonable for a client which submits a MKCOL without a request body to not accept a 207 response, when the spec. 
states that a 201 (Created) is returned. 
So, if a client submits a MKCOL without request body, it really only needs to expect a 201 (Created) as a response code (although it should do the right thing and treat all other 2xx responses as a 200, and a good implementation would also read the body of a 207). 
If a client submits a MKCOL with request body, it should expect either a 201 or a 207 -- both are legitimate responses. 
- Jim I'd like to make a similar observation for IE5's processing of MOVE (and COPY?). 
It would be good if it also supported 207 MultiStatus and checked the body for status. 
This does lead me to another question though. 
Is it acceptable to return a single 2xx return codes within a MultiStatus? 
My reading of the spec suggests it is. 
More shortly.... J.
