<s> Slightly OT: I am making a site that relies almost exclusively on CSS for presentation/formatting of standard HTML tags TD P, H3, etc.  </s>
<s> I have exactly ZERO elements declared with pixel widths, all % and em for font sizes.  </s>
<s> When resizing the browser window in NS7 &amp; OP7 (Win only tests so far) the text is reflowing perfectly but for some reason I can't figure out (driving me mad) IE is not reflowing the text as expected, thus in IE the design is wider than 800 px on some pages... unacceptable.  </s>
<s> I'm wondering if I need some box hack or @import hack in order to load a different CSS for IE.  </s>

<s> Thanks in advance (TIA) Geoff Hoffman  </s>
<s> Geoff There is a mailing list that deals with css issues with some extraordinarily knowledgeable people on it (including a few names that you'll recognise from here).  </s>
<s> Your problem is almost certainly caused by IE's css parsing oddities but without further investigation I'm not sure what.  </s>
<s> A box model hack might solve it but bear in mind that not all hacks produce valid css.  </s>
<s> I'm not sure if there is an @import hack to serve up a css for IE only.  </s>
<s> You could do some php server-side sniffing to detect for IE and then serve up an alternative css based on that.  </s>
<s> Another alternative is to take advantage of IE's conditional HTML comments to serve up a completely different style sheet for all or certain versions of IE.  </s>
<s> I tried doing that as an experiment and it seems to work OK.  </s>
<s> If anyone knows of any accessibility base reasons not to use conditional comments then please could they let me know.  </s>

<s> Funnily enough, I was looking into this only yesterday, pondering various "cox model hacks" and other things on a redesign of my own site.  </s>
<s> As I understand it, there are two syntaxes for writing these comments.  </s>
<s> One reads something like: IE 5 _only_ will get this code (including any amount of markup)  </s>
<s> This is a valid HTML comment (from !-- to -- ) so I can't see an  </s>
<s> _accessibility_ reason why it may be a problem.  </s>
<s> There may be problems with  </s>
<s> bandwidth (because you are sending redundant code to browsers who can't use it).  </s>
<s> There shouldn't be a forward compatibility problem, because even if MS dropped support for this form of scripting in future versions of IE - if any ever arrive - they couldn't retrospectively remove the support form the installed base of IE5.  </s>
<s> The other syntax for writing the comment is be: All browsers will get this (including markup) _except IE5_ This looks a lot more problematic to me, as the comments are not proper comments.  </s>
<s> You are making an assumption about how [Random browser X] will treat these "comments" - for example, will they erroneously treat them as comments and hide what is between; will they treat the comments as unrecognised tags and render what is between, as MS hope, or some other behaviour?  </s>
<s> So I think this method would be flaky on any kind of accessibility / future proofing grounds.  </s>
<s> If you are trying to specifically exclude code from IE5, you could always rewrite to use the first syntax: All MS browsers except IE 5 will get this code.  </s>
<s> Of course, it is hidden to  </s>
<s> non-IE browsers ... So fairly rapidly it gets complex and server-side detection starts to look enticing - if you have scripting rights on your server, that is ... See rview/ccomment_ovw.asp for MS' documentation.  </s>
<s> My view is that it could be useful for detecting IE5 unambiguously, but probably not for anything more complex.  </s>
<s> The most commonly used situation is indeed for some kind of Box Model Hack: link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="standards-compliant-boxmodel.css"  </s>
<s> There are other ways of sending correct box model widths to various target browsers (the Tantek Hack; the Caio Hack; the Simplified Box Model Hack etc.) All have advantages and disadvantages, at least from a CSS point of view.  </s>
<s> Fundamentally, however, they all require writing two widths for a given box - one for IE 5, one for compliant browsers (including IE6 if you force it into standards mode), so arguments about one mechanism or another simplifying maintenance don't wash for me - all require maintenance of two separate values, whether in two separate stylesheets or twice in one stylesheet.  </s>
<s> For someone who in future has to maintain the site (perhaps not the initial author) I think the conditional comments mechanism (or a server-scripted variation) at least has the advantage of being intuitively clearer than the variations that rely on some kind of CSS parsing bug to work - but that is just my view.  </s>

<s> HTML doesn't actually have comments.  </s>
<s> It's a valid SGML directive with a null name and a comment, provided that there are no runs of -s in the text which are not exactly a multiple of four in length (end comment, immediately followed by begin comment).  </s>
<s> Actually odd length runs can be rounded down to a multiple of two in deciding the above.  </s>
<s> A common way of breaking comments is to do rules like this unterminated one:  </s>
<s> A number of browsers have historically not parsed comments properly.  </s>
<s> Lynx has three different ways of parsing them: one for SGML conforming comments and two for different styles of broken parsing.  </s>
<s> People are quite likely to use Lynx in one of the broken modes, because it is more likely to work on the real web.  </s>
<s> A more correct way of doing this would have been: ![%IgnoreIfIE5;[ SGML conditional section that is ignored by an SGML parser if %IgnoreIfIE5 is defined as IGNORE.  </s>
<s> ]] which is why this whole hack is aesthetically so horrible; there is a already a conditional sections features in SGML, but HTML was intended to be simple, so such features wouldn't be needed, which is why early browsers didn't implement it.  </s>
<s> (Note I'm not sure if it is OK to have an empty keyword or undefined entity.**)  </s>
<s> I can't help but feel that if you need to use this sort of tactic you have lost sight of the purpose of HTML and really need a page description language.  </s>
<s> Obviously one can't use the proper SGML syntax for the %IncludeIfIE5; case, but I'm not convinced one should be trying to emulate conditionals, anyway.  </s>
<s> Note I would expect the "If IE5" structure to fail validation.  </s>
<s> I haven't tried the conditional section with no keyword on the validator.  </s>
<s> (Lynx's broken comment modes are: 1) to treat " " as an unconditional delimiter (oops!); 2) to treat "-- " as an unconditional delimiter.  </s>
<s> (1) is off by default.  </s>
<s> (2) is off in the compiled code, but on, for NS compatibility, in the default configuration file of the version I have.) ** As the first definition wins, I believe there is a way round this by defining defaults yourself.  </s>
<s> Only because not sniffing at all gives you better than 95% chance of being right.  </s>
<s> It is very common for minority browser users to imitate IE's User-Agent string in an attempt to get browser sniffing web sites not to discriminate against them.  </s>
