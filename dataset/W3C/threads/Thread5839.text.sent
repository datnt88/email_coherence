Here are some minor editorial recommendations for the Overview document Minor grammatical/typographical suggestions: Introduce acronym (RDF-S) after terms "RDF Schema" in first paragraph of abstract. 
Change "for" to "to" in first paragraph of section 1.1. 
Change "Owl" to "OWL" in first bullet in section 1.1. 
Change "glossary" to "a glossary" in second bullet of section 1.1. 
Section 3.5's bullet on minCardinality, change "has Offspring" to "hasOffspring". 
Section 3.6, first sentence, change "has contains" to "contains". 
Section 4's bullet on unionOf, change "OWL allows" to "OWL DL allows". 
Section 4's bullet on complex classes, change "OWL also" to "OWL DL also" and "OWL full" to "OWL Full". 
Questions/Confusions/Comments: The statement "every RDF document is an OWL Full document" in section 1.3 seems to that there are not any unique requirements associated with the OWL language. 
Is there nothing that is required in valid RDF documents to make them compliant with the OWL specification? 
If so, does that imply that all RDF is OWL Full? 
The annotation properties listed in section 7.1 of the OWL reference document don't appear in the list synopsis for OWL DL constructs in section 2.2 of the OWL Guide. 
The owl:datarange class listed in section 6.2 of the OWL reference document didn't appear in the list synopsis for OWL DL constructs in section 2.2 of the OWL Guide. 
The owl:versionInfo property, deprecatedClass class, and deprecatedProperty class listed in section 7.4 of the OWL reference document don't appear in the list synopsis for OWL Lite constructs in section 2.1 of the OWL Guide. 
Dear Lacy Lee, Thanks very much for comments on the Overview document. 
We will consider them and get back to you. 
Deborah McGuinness OWL Overview co-author (this is a resend, my original posting of 17/06 doesn't seem to have made it into the archives) Dear Lacy, Thank you for your comments on the Overview document dated 21 April (at Below is our response. 
Our apologies for not responding to these sooner. 
All implemented. 
Your reading of our statement is indeed correct, suggesting to us that no change to the document is needed here. 
(We assume that in this comment and those that follow, you refer to section 2.2 of the OWL *Overview*, not Guide) We have added the annotation properties to the synopsis table in section 2.2. of the Overview document, plus a new section 3.9 to list them and point to the OWL Reference for details. 
Added. 
In the process, we also included owl:DatatypeProperty, which was also missing. 
Added. 
As a result, we've also rationalised the sections of the table in section 2.1, and added a new subsection (3.10) on versioning in OWL. 
Thank you again for your comments. 
Can you let us know (with a Cc to public-webont-comments@w3.org) whether you are satisfied with our answer? 
Frank van Harmelen.
