I installed the Sun Java 2 SDK on my Linux &amp; WinXP Pro machines. 
Everything I run aborts with the same error message. 
For example: $ java kbx Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: edu/stanford/TAP/ClientCallback $ java ex9 Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: edu/stanford/TAP/Abbrev at ex9.main(ex9.java:11) 
Dick McCullough knowledge := man do identify od existent done knowledge haspart proposition list 
Have you put tap.jar in your classpath? 
As in: $ java -classpath ./tap.jar ex9 
That changes the error message a little, but still fails: $ java -classpath ../tap.jar kbx Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: kbx 
Dick McCullough knowledge := man do identify od existent done knowledge haspart proposition list 
Have you put tap.jar in your classpath? 
As in: $ java -classpath ./tap.jar ex9 
$ java -classpath .:../tap.jar 
kbx 
Success on Linux !!! Still fails on WinXP Pro. 
I'm giving up on Windows.

$ java -classpath .:../tap.jar 
kbx 
I would certainly agree with dumping Windows, but you might try: c:\ java -classpath .;..\tap.jar 
ex9 it might work. 
It does work using quotes &amp; semicolons $ java -classpath ".;../../tap.jar" 
ex9 I won't dump WinXP Pro now. 
Compared to my Linux machine, my WinXP Pro machine has 10xCPU speed, 10xRAM, 6xdisk capacity. 
Microsoft Windows Services for UNIX 3.0 gives me most of the advantages of Linux.
