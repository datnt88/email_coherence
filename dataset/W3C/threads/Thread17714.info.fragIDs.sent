<s> In general, I believe for a number of reasons that providing choices of alternative rendering via the browsers is preferable for many blind users.  </s>
<s> One reason is that blind users can change access technology without needing to learn new ways that the information is going to be presented.  </s>
<s> This means that a user has some more freedom to switch among acess technology.  </s>
<s> Having the browser provide alternative renderings reduces the problems which can crop up when a blind person in the workplace or at school needs to use the organization-chosen browser that is not well supported by access technology.  </s>
<s> More of the burden is on browser developers rather than access technology developers.  </s>
<s> My suspicion is that it is probably easier for browser developers to "tweak" their software for alternative renderings rather than teaching access technology about web pages because the alternative renderings that are being asked are not that significant in terms of complexity.  </s>
<s> Having the browser handle alternative presentations avoids the lag between versions of access technology handling changes to browser.  </s>
<s> A browser providing alternative renderings does not prevent some access technology from providing additional renderings if some specialize segment needs them.  </s>
<s> I'm not clear that there are very many reasons why alternative rendering should not be done in browsers.  </s>
<s> The first reason is that browser developers may not understand or seek out what blind users need.  </s>
<s> The second reason is why would browser developers go through any effort to have their browser provide alternative arrangements?  </s>

<s> This statement could be used in a number of ways, e.g. legal action, 508, etc. Scott  </s>
<s> While I agree with Scott on his points, making a "universal browser" is exceedingly difficult.  </s>
<s> In cases of specialized rendering, such as voice output to replace the visual display, that is something I do not believe should be in the browser and here is why: 1) Design - Microsoft could not do a good job of designing a audio UI for blind folks and then maintain it moving forward.  </s>
<s> The area of expertise is narrow.  </s>
<s> General voice output, such as Aural Style Sheets is one thing - designing a Speech UI is another.  </s>
<s> Trust me, I know.  </s>
<s> 2) Performance - HTML is used everywhere throughout the operating system.  </s>
<s> The rendering object can be loaded in many, many places.  </s>
<s> Carrying around code that is only useful to a small segment of the total users is wasteful for everyone.  </s>
<s> In this age of bloat-ware, a popular feature of Opera is it's speed and small size.  </s>
<s> 3) Testing - Specialized rendered requires specialized testing, which the major companies are not equipped to deal with.  </s>
<s> Now, that's not to say that I don't agree that the browser should provide as much as possible in the way of alternate rendering and/or accessibility features.  </s>
<s> Microsoft has proven for several years that we are willing to add features to our browser to make it better for everyone.  </s>
<s> We will continue to do that and work with the ISVs to figure out the division between what we can do, verses what the aid can do.  </s>
<s> In many cases, the ISVs feel they can do it better than us and that's a good thing.  </s>

<s> Hi, I'd like to apologize for not being as specific as I should have been in my previous posting.  </s>
<s> When I was talking about rendering, I meant rendering when the presentation was visual.  </s>
<s> I didn't mean that that audio presentation or any other single access browsers should include the same type of rendering aspects.  </s>
<s> Also, I didn't mean to imply that a universal browser was appropriate.  </s>
<s> Please forgive any confusion I may have created.  </s>
<s> Scott  </s>
<s> Hi, Let me give a little background on why I brought up my suggestion on a statement on inaccessibility in the guidelines.  </s>
<s> I'm not sure if the subject has been brought up with other people on this list, but several people have been talking to me about the work the access board will be doing on 508 and technology access.  </s>
<s> My impression is that Congress has assigned the task of determining what accessible technology means to the access board to reach various objectives of 508.  </s>
<s> Since the browser is a key piece of current technology, it is not unreasonable to assume that the access board may have to define what accessible browser/s is/are.  </s>
<s> What I've been asked on a couple of occassions is whether the guidelines can be used to define parameters of an accessible browser.  </s>
<s> My point has been that currently the guidelines are just guidelines but do not necessarily define what an accessible browser is.  </s>
<s> The question becomes what organization is best qualified to say what is an accessible browser.  </s>
<s> I believe that this group is probably more qualified since the technical knowledge is so specialized.  </s>
<s> A suggestion I've been toying with for the guidelines is an appendix listing what features should be included when some law/regulation requires that an accessible browser be specified or defined.  </s>
<s> The issue has some similarity to determining what blind access means in an elevator.  </s>
<s> From what I was told, some elevator developer(s) took positions that blind access was not their responsibility or that they should have the right to determine the degree of accessibility since it was going to affect their bottom line.  </s>
<s> Also, why do elevators have redundant coding in both raised numbers and braille?  </s>
<s> The blind people who prefer raised numbers may have told elevators developers that raised numbers were only needed.  </s>
<s> Braille users may have demanded braille or they would not consider the elevator to be accessible.  </s>
<s> Also, there seems to be no provisions in elevators for blind people with neuropathy.  </s>
<s> Scott  </s>
<s> Scott, is what you mean that the browsers should make the underlying HTML, or an equivalently marked-up rendering scheme, available to assistive technology plug-ins?  </s>
<s> In this case, it seems like a good idea if the browser wants to be a universal one.  </s>
<s> (As opposed to a browser that is concieved as useful for a small number of people, such as EIA, and could justify the 'bloat' argument.)  </s>
<s> To use the guidelines as a legal stick would require that they were much more tightly written, and thingswere much more tightly specified than is desirable, since it would make it difficult to accommodate advances in technology at a sufficient rate to be valuable.  </s>
<s> And it would seem to me that lawyers, who have the necessary background to create documents that can be used in legal arenas do not generally have the background reauired to formulate guidelines.  </s>
<s> Besides which, the law in the US and the law in Australia and the law in the UK operate differently.  </s>
<s> Are we writing an International treaty, or a useful document for people trying to get the best product to the market the fastest?  </s>

<s> Scott, is what you mean that the browsers should make the underlying HTML, or an equivalently marked-up rendering scheme, available to assistive technology plug-ins?  </s>
<s> In this case, it seems like a good idea if the browser wants to be a universal one.  </s>
<s> That is already available in a browser specific fashion with Internet Explorer through the Dynamic HTML object model.  </s>
<s> A generic object model is also exposed that is compatible across applications, we call that Active Accessibility.  </s>
<s> This has been available since May of 1997.  </s>

<s> I would like to move the discussion on the UA guidelines away from judging wether a particular browser is accessible to the "blind" or any other disability.  </s>
<s> Our primary focus is to develop a list of features for user agents that are useful for people with disabilities to access WWW technologies.  </s>
<s> Chuck is correct that the W3C only develops recommendations and does not have any enforcement mechanism to force any member organization to follow any W3C recommendations, including such highly visible specifications like HTML 4.0 and CSS1&amp;CSS2.  </s>
<s> Currently it is primarily market forces that drive a particular companies adherance to W3C recommendations.  </s>
<s> Remmember that our recommendations must be reviewed by other W3C groups, administration and finally approved by the W3C Advisory committee (which all major browser manufacuters partiicpate).  </s>
<s> So even if we wanted to have judgement type statements in the UA guidelines(which I don't), I can guarantee they would be weeded out before any proposed recommendation made it to recommendation status.  </s>
<s> It would also considerably slow down the recommendation process.  </s>
<s> So let's not waste our previous resources focusing on what any paricular company should or should not do related to accessibility, but let's move our discussions to more important issues like table navigation and dynamic HTML accessibility.  </s>
<s> If you want to express your opinion on the merits or problems of a particular browser related to accessibility there are plenty of other lists to send your comments, or you can send your comments directly to the comapny.  </s>
<s> We must restrict our comments on the W3C WAI UA list to user interface issues, if we are to accomplish our goals.  </s>

<s> I think the issue of the "universal" browser relates closely with the issues of Universal Design.  </s>
<s> Of the seven principles espoused as the fundamentals of Universas design (http://www.trace.wisc.edu/docs/ud_princ/ud_princ.htm), the first five are relevant to user agent design.  </s>
<s> To wit: PRINCIPLE ONE: Equitable Use The design is useful and marketable to any group of users.  </s>
<s> Guidelines: 1a. Provide the same means of use for all users: identical whenever possible; equivalent when not.  </s>
<s> 1b.  </s>
<s> Avoid segregating or stigmatizing any users.  </s>
<s> 1c.  </s>
<s> Provisions for privacy, security, and safety should be equally available to all users.  </s>
<s> PRINCIPLE TWO: Flexibility in Use The design accommodates a wide range of individual preferences and abilities.  </s>
<s> Guidelines: 2a. Provide choice in methods of use.  </s>
<s> 2c.  </s>
<s> Facilitate the user's accuracy and precision.  </s>
<s> 2d.  </s>
<s> Provide adaptability to the user's pace.  </s>
<s> PRINCIPLE THREE: Simple and Intuitive Use of the design is easy to understand, regardless of the user's experience, knowledge, language skills, or current concentration level.  </s>
<s> Guidelines: 3a. Eliminate unnecessary complexity.  </s>
<s> 3b.  </s>
<s> Be consistent with user expectations and intuition.  </s>
<s> 3c.  </s>
<s> Accommodate a wide range of literacy and language skills.  </s>
<s> 3d.  </s>
<s> Arrange information consistent with its importance.  </s>
<s> 3e.  </s>
<s> Provide effective prompting for sequential actions.  </s>
<s> 3f.  </s>
<s> Provide timely feedback during and after task completion.  </s>
<s> PRINCIPLE FOUR: Perceptible Information The design communicates necessary information effectively to the user, regardless of ambient conditions or the user's sensory abilities.  </s>
<s> Guidelines: 4a. Use different modes (pictorial, verbal, tactile) for redundant presentation of essential information.  </s>
<s> 4b.  </s>
<s> Provide adequate contrast between essential information and its surroundings.  </s>
<s> 4c.  </s>
<s> Maximize "legibility" of essential information in all sensory modalities.  </s>
<s> 4d.  </s>
<s> Differentiate elements in ways that can be described (i.e., make it easy to give instructions or directions).  </s>
<s> 4e.  </s>
<s> Provide compatibility with a variety of techniques or devices used by people with sensory limitations.  </s>
<s> PRINCIPLE FIVE: Tolerance for Error The design minimizes hazards and the adverse consequences of accidental or unintended actions.  </s>
<s> Guidelines: 5a. Arrange elements to minimize hazards and errors: most used elements, most accessible; hazardous elements eliminated, isolated, or shielded.  </s>
<s> 5b.  </s>
<s> Provide warnings of hazards and errors.  </s>
<s> 5c.  </s>
<s> Provide fail safe features.  </s>
<s> 5d.  </s>
<s> Discourage unconscious action in tasks that require vigilance.  </s>
<s> Note that all of these are simply good design principles.  </s>
<s> With regard, specifically, to web browsers and universal design, there are some features, such as keyboard control, that are common to a wide range of individuals.  </s>
<s> Keyboard controls are useful for anyone who cannot use, or chooses not to use, a mouse.  </s>
<s> Table serialization may be useful for non-visual users as well as those with learning disabilities.  </s>
<s> Features that are desirable across a wide range of individuals probably should be a component of the browser itself.  </s>
<s> Some features, on the other hand, are of use only to very limited populations.  </s>
<s> The browser should not be expected to anticipate and accommodate every possible need.  </s>
<s> But it should be made so that a standard device can provide for the special need.  </s>
<s> The user agent should be versatile enough to accommodate a wide range of common needs, and adaptable enough to accommodate special needs.  </s>
<s> The mechanism needed to provide adaptability are variable, but the ability to plug extensions into a browser for special needs would meet this need, if the information necessary to easily create the plug-ins were readily available.  </s>

<s> to follow up on what Jon Gunderson said:  </s>
<s> As Scott points out, there are people out there whose job it will be to write regulations.  </s>
<s> The WAI-UA group did not set out to do their job for them.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, a scenario where the WAI-UA guidelines get picked up and misapplied by people who are under the gun to write regulations _fast_ seems a plausible risk, to me.  </s>
<s> Either of two outcomes would be an error: if the prospective regulators viewed the document this group is producing as either a) irrelevant to their task b) draft public policy ready for adoption and enforcement that would be an error.  </s>
<s> Partly, that is why we have an International Program Office in the WAI -- to provide the follow-through needed to see that the results of the technical working groups get appropriately applied.  </s>
<s> Maybe a meta-guideline on the relationship between this technical work and public policy initiatives would be a help, and maybe we should ask the IPO to take the lead in developing that?  </s>
<s> Al  </s>
<s> Laws have a different test to become a reality than the current W3C WAI UA guidelines.  </s>
<s> While legislators in some countries may choose the UA recommendations as a basis for an accessibility law, I am sure they will be greatly transformed in the process and look quite different.  </s>
<s> It would also be one of many documents and other types of input that would go into any law.  </s>
<s> I think it would be wise of us to focus on our present task of developing useful design recommendations to meet the needs of W3C member companies and persons with disabilities throughout the world, than to contemplate how our guidelines would be used in developing legislation in any particular country.  </s>
