Attached is a message I've just sent to the W3C Semantic Web Coordination Group list, where we are discussing priorities to propose for phase two of the Semantic Web Activity, beginning later in the spring. 
The mail archives for SWCG are on the W3C Member website at http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-semweb-cg/ so passwords are needed to track that discussion. 
Needless to say the attached view[1] is just my personal opinion. 
I'd be interested in the views of SWAD-Europe folk on how they see things, personal views or otherwise. 
More context: W3C SW page, http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/ and current Activity statement: http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Activity#

Short version: phase two of W3C SW Activity should focus on getting RDF used in the public Web. 
Everything else (especially new technology creation) is secondary to that goal. 
Here's a longer account of my view for SW Activity phase two priorities. 
(Ontologists, note that I write 'RDF' in its broader sense, as a Framework, for which we now have an Ontology language; when I write 'RDF' pls read 'RDF/OWL' if you prefer). 
RDF and SW/Ontology tools are very general. 
They could be used for almost anything to do with modern information management. 
This broad applicability is what draws many of us to the technology, but also a source of risk: by being _usable_ for everything, we risk being _used_ for nothing. 
A reasurringly wide range of groups are exploring the possibilities of RDF, yet RDF is not tailored to any of their specific needs. 
We must be doing something right. 
But we shouldn't forget that more tailored solutions in each field could easily discourage RDF adoption. 
We can't please all the people, all the time. 
Something we might attempt in phase two is to focus our effects a bit on some particular fields for deploying RDF/OWL. 
I propose (this is so obvious as to barely need saying, perhaps) that we focus on the public Web in phase two of the Activity. 
By 'the public Web', I mean the work of Web masters, HTML authors, focussing on publically available sites who are currently mostly using HTML+CSS+jpeg/gif/png as their content formats, and perhaps dabbling with RSS, Flash, SVG and other fancy new stuff. 
I would like to see more RDF files on publically visible Web servers. 
RDF files that use a variety of RDF schemas and Ontologies, and that link to other RDF documents scattered around the Web. 
Once we have this, I'm confident the rest (intranets, domain specific tools, RDF in backend databases etc.) will follow. 
Right now, if you go looking in the public Web for folk using RDF, there really isn't much out there. 
A few large datadumps, a few keys into webservice lookups or screen scrapes, a fair amount of Dublin Core embedded (invalidly) in HTML or linked as separate files, a promising number of RSS files, some of which are in RSS 1.0 (but not really exploiting the RDF aspects of RSS), and a few hundred FOAF files. 
This is pretty modest situation to be in after 5+ years of RDF work. 
It isn't disasterous, but should be a cause for concern, and for focus as we design the next phase of the Activity. 
I would like us to go into phase two with some notion of success criteria: what would count as having succeeded? 
I'm suggesting that an almost quantitative approach may be applicable. 
If there are lots of RDF documents being used on ordinary Web sites, whether commercial, personal, Weblog, portal or academic, then something is going right. 
If we end phase two without this, then we likely should think about packing up and going home. 
Let's make phase two all about roll-out. 
Getting RDF, even simple, perhaps boring RDF, on the agendas, web sites and CVs of ordinary Web masters and content producers. 
That RDF will be all the more meaningful if it draws on vocabularies enriched with OWL, and we will have our work cut out for us helping folk do this effectively. 
If, in attempting to get RDF deployed in this way, we find the reason for resistence is that people need common APIs, more standard query languages, protocols, or rule languages, then yes, we could start work in those areas. 
But right now I don't believe for a second that RDF is relatively undeployed because we've not created enough accompanying Web standards. 
When RDF is used, eg. in RSS, or Dublin Core, it is often 'on faith', ie because people are anticipating some payback from using it where they could have adopted a pre-RDF or vanilla XML solution. 
Many people are still waiting to see what their RDF dabblings bought them. 
By focussing phase two on public Web deployment, I believe we will have a good chance of increasing the number of RDF documents and RDF tools and RDF-basd services that are visible to folk investigating the technology. 
Since RDF is all about data merging and network effects, it becomes a stronger platform for information management with every new shared document that uses it. 
This, if nothing else, should draw our attention towards priorities that encourage the publication of RDF/XML documents on the Web. 
If this account of a theme for phase two is at all persuasive, I think we could derrive some specific work items and priorities. 
But let's agree on what we're trying to achieve, first. 
Even if it something as almost-crass as 'lots of RDF documents on lots of Web sites'. 
Stating the obvious might be worthwhile, I suspect. 
cheers, Dan ps. i'll probably forward this to a public archived mailing list, for b/g in discussions in SWAD-Europe and the RDFIG. 
I mostly agree but with a slight note of caution. 
I agree that it is best to pick one, or a small number of, focused application classes. 
I agree that success on the "public web" would carry more impact than many alternatives and should be the target if possible. 
My caution is that the semantic web is primarily about machine readable data and the public web is, currently, primarily about human readable data. 
This tends to leave the role of the semantic web technology on the public web as mostly concerned with metadata about otherwise human readable documents. 
Metadata is certainly useful but (a) is often internal to a site and so benefits less from standardization and (b) is subject to the bottleneck that people avoid providing metadata if they possibly can. 
Now I *do* think there are roles for semantic web technologies in the public web, otherwise we wouldn't have proposed semantic blogging and semantic portals as our two demonstrator apps! 
However, I'm not sure we have a clear idea of the most useful roles. 
So "yes" to targeting the public web, but work needs to done to make that more specific before you turn it into work priorities. 
Dave [The use of "I" lots of times is meant to indicate that this is a personal opinion.] 
Dan, It would be good to see more RDF "out there". 
Getting real use ("real" being relative here!) both increases the visibility of the semantic web and fuels the software that makes it all go. 
We need to ask what would make for more RDF produced and consumed. 
It is hard today to author RDF or to use RDF. 
One really needs to be comfortable with the specs to make serious progress, especially if others are going to use the RDF. 
For that reason, I think there is much to do in the software tools for RDF to make the barriers to its use much less. 
This is especially true of using RDF read from elsewhere - people will be encouraged to add/create RDF to their webs when people think it enhances the value of their pages. 
So - "yes" to use of RDF on the public web, but it is a bit of a "both" not "either/or". 
Andy I mostly agree but with a slight note of caution.

Group for SWCG are interested otherwise.

anything wide tailored to shouldn't forget adoption. 
some to of the Activity. 
focussing on HTML+CSS+jpeg/gif/png as their new stuff. 
files that documents (intranets, domain you go there. 
A few fair amount promising exploiting the RDF situation to be for concern, what would approach ordinary Web sites, is going packing boring RDF, producers. 
That with OWL, and resistence or rule don't believe enough it is often where still good RDF-basd services about information else, should RDF/XML could we're trying documents
