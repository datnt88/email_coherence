<s> Skipping through 14K of top-posted text here (I love Ph.D.s who can't run E-mail):  </s>
<s> In your formulation below - the first success criteria is that all non-text content have a text alternative.  </s>
<s> Since this says `all' it means all non-text content including spacers, decorations etc. other checkpoints are in addition to this - not instead of.  </s>
<s> Let us all keep in mind a general exception that must be applicable to all our guidelines: If the purpose of the page (section, site, resource, document) is to teach the topic of accessibility itself, it may violate the guidelines.  </s>
<s> Hence indeed not "all" content may be accessible.  </s>
<s> It is easy to imagine giving correct and incorrect examples of accessible methods.  </s>
<s> We do that already.  </s>
<s> The incorrect examples, as Web content, would violate WCAG.  </s>
<s> It is also easy to imagine entire online courses where full Web sites for imaginary companies are posted, with students expected to take the sites and fix them.  </s>
<s> Those sites, with deliberately-incorrect markup, would not be permitted without an exception.  </s>
<s> I don't think that "scoping" is a good way to handle this.  </s>
<s> I suggest a clear and explicit exception.  </s>

<s> There are lots of reasons content may be inaccessible.  </s>
<s> I don't see why explaining something that is not accessible is a good reason for making something inaccessible - it should be possible to provide an accessible explanation.  </s>
<s> I don't think "scoping" has anything to do with it.  </s>
<s> I don't see any need for an exception here.  </s>
<s> Especially if we recognise that we live in the real world, where plenty of things aren't made accessible because it is easier to provide an inaccessile version than to make the effort of turning something into an accessible version.  </s>
<s> Nikud, or captions, or alt texts, are real work.  </s>
<s> Not everyone does it always.  </s>
<s> What's the point of saying "we think this can be called accessible, although we know it isn't" for some class or other of things that have a reason that would stand up in the real world as a justification for simply ignoring the guidelines?  </s>
<s> At least we could otherwise know in advance that some content isn't accessible, as opposed to knowing that it got some exception, and passes the guidelines even though it is not actually useful to someone with a disability.  </s>

<s> Correct, and they are worded accordingly in the proposal.  </s>
<s> I disagree.  </s>
<s> Scoping covers the point perfectly well and there is no need for an explicitly stated exception here, any more than there is in respect of other reasons why content might not conform.  </s>
<s> The better approach was discussed at last week's meeting - to write a section or document for governmental or organizational policy-makers with suggestions on proper use of scoping.  </s>
