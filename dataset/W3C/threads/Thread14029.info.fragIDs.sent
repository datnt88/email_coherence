3. Sign language translations of documents (is there an overlap here with W3C's internationalisation work?) 

Could you clarify/expand upon what you're suggesting here? 
I know we've had this discussion of sign languages - ASL and other - in this list before. 
I'm not familiar with W3C's internationalization work beyond markup of document source language(s) and encoding(s). 
3A) Are you suggesting that documents written in one language - English, say - should be automatically translated into ASL or another sign language? 
3B) Are you suggesting that documents written in English (or equivalent source language) should be automatically transcribed into MCE, Manually-Coded English (or equivalent target sign representation)? 
3C) Are you asking for discussion of how ASL and other sign languages could be formatted/encoded on the Web?

What I am essentially asking is whether any requirements pertaining to the translation of text into sign languages, whether automated or not, or the representation of such languages via the web, should be included in a subsequent version of the guidelines. 
This is one issue which has been consistently raised in discussion but in regard to which no firm decisions have been taken. 
My remarks were intended to ensure that the issue remains on the agenda, rather than to suggest any concrete proposal. 
I would suggest that we consider the possibility of automatic conversion to sign language (one of the easier forms of machine translation, I suspect) and that we attempt to ensure that if it is possible we are able to cope with it.
