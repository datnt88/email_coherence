<s> Daniel-- so you have some background about IPP and BPP: The ICADD 22 was designed to help in the production of etexts and braille texts --these were necessarily looking at documents that had already been published.  </s>
<s> This is why tags representing post-processing information such as IPP and BPP made their way into that DTD.  </s>
<s> As you point out, these do not have a place except in the printing spec, and I'd redirect this to that working group.  </s>
<s> Hopefully there wont be a pagebreak tag coming out of that work, but if there is indeed a pagebreak tag that emerges for inkprint, there may be a corresponding need for a Braille pagebreak tag to indicate to Braille printing software where in the Braille output it is okay to start a new page.  </s>
<s> As far as I can tell, all the FIG tag outlined in the message below is doing is to introduce a logical grouping-- again, do we need a new tag for this?  </s>

<s> (by way of Mike Paciello paciello@ma.ultranet.com ) Subject: Dave/Dan: We would like to propose "D" Tag, use of FIG, IPP and PP at HTML meeting - thanks, Mike Hi, Here is a summary of my notes from the recent ICADD meeting... To accomodate the need for a so-called "D" tag, we agreed that we could use the existing A tag with the REL attribute value set as "DESCRIPTION" The convention for the content of the A element could continue to be the text "D".  </s>
<s> However, when user agents are able to deal with A REL="DESCRIPTION , they might use a style sheet mechanism to hide the content of the element and substitute an icon, or language-specific text.  </s>
<s> In consideration of the potential need for multiple alternate versions of descriptive text, ICADD recommends the use of the FIG element to serve as a container for an image and attendant "descriptions" and "alt" text.  </s>
<s> For example: FIG IMG SRC="image.png" ALT="Picture of ICADD" A REL="DESCRIPTION" LANG="ENGLISH" HREF="...." D /A A REL="DESCRIPTION" LANG="FRENCH" HREF="...." D /A A REL="DESCRIPTION" LANG="SPANISH" HREF="...." D /A A REL="DESCRIPTION" LANG="ITALIAN" HREF="...." D /A ALT LANG="ENGLISH" ... /ALT ALT LANG="FRENCH" ... /ALT ALT LANG="SPANISH" ... /ALT ALT LANG="ITALIAN" ... /ALT /FIG Note: The langauge names listed above are not specified in the accepted syntax.  </s>
<s> They are used to illustrate.  </s>
<s> I will have to update this example with the correct values for language specification.  </s>
<s> To accomodate the need to match the functionality of the IPP and PP elements in the ICADD-22, we agreed that we could use the existing A tag.  </s>
<s> The use of A in this case requires the use of standardized values for the REL and REV attributes, and a convention for the names of target anchors.  </s>
<s> We need conventions for pointing to a target anchor and asserting that it represents the beginning of an "Imprint Page" or a "Braille Page".  </s>
<s> There are two potential and complementary mechanisms available: - Use a naming conventions for identifying anchors, such as "IPP-[0-9]+", "IPP-[ivxlc]", "BPP-[0-9]+" or "IPP-[ivxlc]+", etc. - Use REL="BPP" or REL="IPP" I assert that it would be helpful and reliably redundant to utilize both methods, and am recommending that.  </s>

<s> To accomodate the need for a so-called "D" tag,  </s>
<s> I found a reference for the D tag is this the correct one ?  </s>
<s> What it says is: "A D-tag is a capital "D" text anchor that appears next to or below an image.  </s>
<s> This "D" links to a page with a full description of the image.  </s>
<s> Because D-tag descriptions appear on their own pages, they can be as long as an author wants them to be."  </s>
<s> My understanding is that the new cougar OBJECT tag will in fact serve the same purpose, and so I'm not in favor of doing anything with D tags at this point.  </s>
<s> For example: FIG IMG SRC="image.png" ALT="Picture of ICADD" A REL="DESCRIPTION" LANG="ENGLISH" HREF="...." D /A A REL="DESCRIPTION" LANG="FRENCH" HREF="...." D /A A REL="DESCRIPTION" LANG="SPANISH" HREF="...." D /A A REL="DESCRIPTION" LANG="ITALIAN" HREF="...." D /A ALT LANG="ENGLISH" ... /ALT ALT LANG="FRENCH" ... /ALT ALT LANG="SPANISH" ... /ALT ALT LANG="ITALIAN" ... /ALT /FIG  </s>
<s> Unless I'm mistaken, FIG and ALT are not valid HTML elements at this point.  </s>
<s> Are you suggesting they get added ?  </s>
<s> Note: The langauge names listed above are not specified in the accepted syntax.  </s>
<s> They are used to illustrate.  </s>
<s> I will have to update this example with the correct values for language specification.  </s>
<s> Langage can also be taken care of with HTTP Content-Language negociation.  </s>
<s> To accomodate the need to match the functionality of the IPP and PP elements in the ICADD-22,  </s>
<s> Is there a better reference to the semantics of these elements than: Basically, IPP and PP are for reference to printed page numbering.  </s>
<s> I think our team working on printing HTML/CSS should look at that.  </s>
<s> My reaction is that since we don't know how to print HTML well yet, it is too early to think about any mapping mechanism for accessibility purpose.  </s>
<s> Maybe I'm being blunt, but I have a hard time understanding how this whole IPP/BPP mechanism work.  </s>
<s> This is markup that appears in a source HTML and describe a post formating information ?  </s>
<s> How is that achievable ?  </s>

<s> On the whole, I agree with the trend established by Daniel and  </s>
<s> seconded by T.V. The place where I fall off the track laid down by T.V. has to do with making references to print versions in the accepted indexing medium of the print realm.  </s>
<s> [picking up the quote from T.V.] Daniel-- so you have some background about IPP and BPP: The ICADD 22 was designed to help in the production of etexts and braille texts --these were necessarily looking at documents that had already been published.  </s>

<s> As you point out, these do not have a place except in the printing spec, and I'd redirect this to that working group.  </s>
<s> [Al, here...] This is where my agreement breaks down.  </s>
<s> Specifically, "these do not have a place except in the printing spec" goes too far.  </s>
<s> The Braille user with an ICADD 22 document can get an answer to the question "Where am I in the print-version coordinates?"  </s>
<s> That question should be answerable by some mechanism we support.  </s>
<s> It is not just a matter of instructing the printing device.  </s>
<s> This is required for coordination [over the phone] by people using print and Braille variants of the same document.  </s>
<s> The same goes for print and Web versions of the same document.  </s>
<s> Braille users are not the only users needing cross-index or coordinate tranformation services.  </s>
<s> Compare this with the issue of the West Publishing copyright on the pagination that is required as the means of indexing in court proceedings in the U.S. Al Gilman  </s>
<s> Al-- I do not disagree with you on the need for synchrony between Braille and print versions.  </s>
<s> However, mixing in either print specific or Braille specific markup into the document is wrong --and it is wrong to mixin Braille pagebreaks into the markup for the same reasons that it is wrong to mixin visual printing specific markup into the document.  </s>
<s> Both of these belong in the style sheet arena plus the specs like the printing spec that is trying to solve precisely the same problem.  </s>
<s> The "synchrony" problem between Braille and print that you point out exists in a much more dramatic way for all WWW users today, namely, synchronizing between the printed copy and the online scroll.  </s>
<s> Let's piggy back on the solution that the WWW invents to that problem-- you can bet that that solution is likely to be invented far faster than any access specific thing.  </s>
<s> This could also serve as a model for the way the WAI addresses access issues by bringing them into the mainstream; there is a good chance that the current debate about printing has not considered Braille, and there is an even better chance that once the topic is introduced in that forum along with knowledge about Braille printing, it might well be possible to come up with an integrated approach that solves the three-way synchrony problem, namely, persons A, B, and C carrying out a phone conversation about a document where: A reads a printed Braille version B reads an online scroll C reads an inkprint version.  </s>

<s> [Al, here...] My text: "mixing in either print specific or Braille specific markup into the document is wrong" This use of the phrase "into the document" gives the document too small a scope.  </s>
<s> The layout styling, even if it is segregated into data separate from some more abstract content representation, is still _part of the document_.  </s>
<s> We can't capture the value-added of a book designer without it.  </s>
<s> There remains the question as how this information is represented in data.  </s>
<s> This is an issue where I think end-users take a back seat in the ultimate decision.  </s>
<s> I can see a user-level requirement that flows down to a broad technical policy that all acceptable data formats support public methods that extract core content into public representations.  </s>
<s> Whether this is done by a factored data format or a filter is for the implementors to argue about.  </s>
<s> Part of what powered the ascendancy of WYSIWYG in the computer market is the use of as little abstraction as one can get away with.  </s>
<s> I don't see this as an issue we can dispose of summarily.  </s>
<s> I think that this is a decision on which the group would do well to suspend judgement and invest some time comparing alternatives.  </s>
<s> Al Gilman  </s>
<s> [BPP] in that draft was just PP.  </s>
<s> For symmetry Murray's notes made it BPP to make clear that both Braille and Ink page numbers may be needed.  </s>
<s> In general, there are several BPP per IPP.  </s>
<s> The transformation services could use IPP or BPP, though both are coarse finding aids.  </s>
<s> Thanks for this insight.  </s>
<s> It is quite pertinent.  </s>
<s> A significant reference for that is: On August 6, 1996, the American Bar Association's House of Delegates favorably passed a motion for a universal citation system recommendation to the courts.  </s>
<s> The Resolution from Report No. 107 recommends that courts adopt a universal citation system using sequential decision numbers for each year and internal paragraph numbers within the decision.  </s>
<s> The numbers should be assigned by the court and included in the decision at the time it is made publicly available by the court.  </s>
<s> It also recommends that parallel citations to commonly used print sources be strongly encouraged.  </s>
<s> The Citation system is equally adaptable to printed and electronic case reports and is thus medium neutral.  </s>
<s> The standard form of citation, shown for a decision in a federal court of appeals, should be: Smith v. Jones, 1996 5Cir 15, ?18,  </s>
<s> 22 F.3d 955.  </s>
<s> 1996 is the year of the decision; 5Cir refers to the United States Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit; 15 indicates that this citation is to the 15th decision released by the court in the year; 18 is the paragraph number where the material referred to is located, and the remainder is the parallel citation to the volume and page in the printed case report where the decision may also be found.  </s>
<s> Another reference is: March 1, 1995 Report, AALL Task Force on Citation Formats American Association of Law Libraries I paraphrase its lengthy content: Objective: medium-neutral, vendor-neutral, and in the public domain.  </s>
<s> Recommendation: Document references are sequential by year by court by decision.  </s>
<s> Sequentially numbered paragraphs are the primary internal "pinpoint" targets.  </s>
<s> West Law is again' it; they have a vested interest and have copyrighted their page numbers from their printed versions.  </s>
<s> Lawyers have been doing it their way for over a century.  </s>
<s> Lawyers and judges know how to use their system.  </s>
<s> Paper remains the medium for the origin of documents with legal effect.  </s>
<s> Issues for Generalization: Above applies to persistent, static legal information.  </s>
<s> It gets that way after initial versions are final edited and eventually signed by a judge.  </s>
<s> Adding numbers thereafter could mess up copyfitting and page breaks.  </s>
<s> Paper publishing was the durable medium of choice for centuries.  </s>
<s> Page number referencing was OK as that was all there was.  </s>
<s> Old law on paper is difficult to reliably scan/OCR to become electronic.  </s>
<s> When done, folio numbers are often at the end of the page, not before them.  </s>
<s> Paragraph numbering is finer-grain than page, but subject to ambiguity when done algorithmically.  </s>
<s> Should these be numbered: headings, bulleted items in a list, block quotes, display equations within a logical paragraph?  </s>
<s> Many electronic documents are dynamic.  </s>
<s> No sequential paragraph numbering scheme would survive revisions, without gaps and sub-numbering injections.  </s>
<s> Reorderings would get original numbering out of order.  </s>
<s> Different renditions of electronic documents may have different content or ordering [e.g., some may be text-only, some may have alt text in place of images, some may have D pointers to descriptive text.  </s>
<s> Some may have other footnotes by reference vs. by inclusion, some may have footnotes "nearby", others as endnotes gathered either by division or by document.]  </s>
<s> An SGML way could assign a unique identifier to each tag.  </s>
<s> A means to have fractional numbers would allow injections.  </s>
<s> Missing numbers would indicate omitted materials.  </s>
<s> [The military hierarchic numbering of divisions and subdivisions is a long-standing model for this, possibly to include a comment about the range of deleted material.]  </s>
<s> A hierarchic naming scheme should be able to grow outward, as when one numbered division becomes part of a new parent, or possibly part of two different parents.  </s>
<s> These indicate that the id "uniqueness" is a hard problem.  </s>
<s> So, the IPP BPP issues, when viewed in a larger context, are the URN issues.  </s>
<s> The original purpose for IPP and BPP was locators between dissimilar media for rendition.  </s>
<s> The finer grain pinpoint location to paragraph of the legal citations would be useful here as well.  </s>
<s> Presence of such pinpoint location as a general practice would be useful for universal design, not just accessibility.  </s>
