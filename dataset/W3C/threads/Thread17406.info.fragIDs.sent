hi all, i'd really appreciate your opinions on what the best option would be for my situation both usability and accessibility-wise: background on the site: - designed to 800x600 (client extremely opposed to horizontal scrolling (as am i for the most part) - no javascript - templatised - in both english and welsh 
on some pages the site will return data to the user in the form of dropdowns. the width of the dropdowns is dependent on the number of characters in the lines(the lines are addresses and one of them may only be 20 characters long, but another one may be 400 characters long and that would 
dictate the overal width). 
i am thinking i have the following options: 1.) allow for the full address to be displayed (so that the user may have to scroll horizontally, but at least none of them are ambiguous). 
2.) implement three dots (...) after a certain number of characters. 
i would be interested in hearing other options if you have any. 
i am currently leaning towards option 1 because the option 2 would be difficult to impose because i am not sure what a 'user-friendly' length is for addresses to be cut off at and doubt this would be the same in english as it is in welsh (could rules be different for the languages and if so, does anyone know when it would be user-friendly to implement (...) to an address in english and in welsh? 
also - i'm guessing there would be issues with screen readers. 
would the screen reader read 'dot, dot, dot' or sthg like that? 
also, because of the ambiguity, it is easy for the user to chose an incorrect address (especially because postcodes appear at the end of the address) which could mean a vicious circle of errors. 
so, can anyone think of any other options? 
thanks very much in advance, julie 
Hiya Julie I'm not sure why you say the site is fixed at 800 pixels wide to avoid horizontal scrolling. 
Maybe I'm missing something, but you should be aware that there are millions of displays out there that are less than 800 pixels wide. 
Also don't forget that users with displays set at 800 pixels wide may not have their browser fully maximised to use their entire window space. 
As for drop-down menus, you could consider placing radio buttons in your form instead. 
Then, you could use the full data field in both English and Welsh as the form data, and place a cut-off or even full text caption next to it. 
This would allow the text to wrap onto the next line at the right-hand edge of the browser window. 
Use of the ellipsis would be a good idea if you decide to truncate the text placed after the radio button. 
You could have your server-side script truncate the English at one set number of characters, and the Welsh at another. 
You'd probably want more in the Welsh version anyway. 
Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerych... :o) I would suggest that the "user-friendly" limit of characters is based on your content and not an arbitrary rule. 
It all depends on context. 
Finally, you could also consider returing the address data in table format. 
Imagine a data table with several columns. 
The first column would contain the relevant radio button, the second column the street address, the third column the town, fourth for county, fifth for post code. 
That would make it less likely to rely entirely on the last part of the address, would format your data nicely, and provide your readers an easier method to scan the addresses. 
I couldn't tell if you are intending on returning English and Welsh addresses simultaneously, or as a separate option i.e. Welsh only or English only.

Hi. First, I agree with comments by Jaz-Michael King. 
I wonder where the requirement to use dropdowns is coming from but you probably have your reasons. 
Are the addresses mentioned in your mail postal addresses (as I would assume) or perhaps URI addresses? 
(If they were URIs, you probably would not even think of truncating them. 
Long URIs are problematic in a way that they don't contain spaces and thus don't wrap nicely even if presented in an other way than dropdown lists.) How about adding a textarea to your form, presenting truncated addresses in the dropdown lists and using some scripting to show the full address of the selected option in the textarea? 
[1] To ensure that the application is accessible also without JavaScript, you could initially add full addresses to option texts and truncate them using JavaScript. 
(Maybe even use JavaScript to add the textarea to the form.) Contact me if you find this suggestion interesting and require assistance in making it work. 
Samuel [1] Code example (untested): onchange="this.form.real_addr.value=this[this.selectedIndex].value"
