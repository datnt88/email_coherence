<s> A link to the page would not suffice.  </s>
<s> At least a description of the page (not about the contents of the page bu how it is made up) would be nice, along with a small picture how it looked at the time of addition.  </s>
<s> I kown not all people would be able to use the picture.  </s>
<s> To compensate for this a copy of the -- for instance the main page -- could be mirrored.  </s>
<s> When a site is submitted it could be run through a verification tool like Bobby.  </s>
<s> This check could / should be repeated periodicly and include the dat of the last verification along with the site listing.  </s>
<s> When a site has been redesigned and doesn't meet accessebility anymore a warning email could be send to the webmaster, and a notice should be added to the list saying the site was redesigned.  </s>
<s> When the site is not corrected with a specified period the site would be moved to the list of inaccessible sites.  </s>
<s> This last step should maybe be done by hand of the 'accessebility board' to either move it to the list of inaccessibe site or the one with less accessible sites.  </s>

<s> Hi, Thanks for the comments about the list of accessible and good looking websites campaign (http://www.mcu.org.uk/articles/accessibletext.html).  </s>
<s> I agree with most of what has been said: * The current listing service is not adequate for the job (this covers many sins as outlined in the earlier comments).  </s>
<s> * What looks good to one person doesn't look good to another; subjectvity plays a big part.  </s>
<s> *Some type of peer review system would be a great idea.  </s>
<s> As soon as I get time I will write a more tailored solution.  </s>
<s> I'm also happy to work with a talented and willing programmer to replace the current simple system (they would also need to be generous - because there is no pay).  </s>
<s> I don't agree that Bobby should be used to verify claims - mainly because my experience is that the results can be very misleading; human input is still required.  </s>
<s> Also I think - in this case - the minutia of W3C guidelines and compliance would become the main topic - and deflect from the goals of the campaign; to demonstrate that good design is not the opposite of accessible design (lots more can be said to explain and expand on this).  </s>
<s> Perhaps Bobby along with validation of the HTML could, as suggest, be used to notify the submitter of the site of possible problems - but I don't think the results should then appear on the list.  </s>
<s> Much more could be said - but I'll need to think about how to address the current weaknesses first.  </s>

<s> I think it is a great idea for some sites to work up some lists of other pages that provide good examples for web designers.  </s>
<s> I don't think it would be a good idea for W3C to get involved in providing a review process, a logo process or any other kind of "You are a good guy" kind of certification for a web site.  </s>
<s> First, it remains a vague science as to what is an accessible site.  </s>
<s> Usability is still an art, not a science.  </s>
<s> And Accessibility should build on usability.  </s>
<s> And, I am sure that what is accessible to one is not accessible to others due to different screen readers, Braille tablets, etc. and different browsers.  </s>
<s> I would claim that the rigor required of an international standard (and W3C is really a standards organization) is not yet known for accessibility.  </s>

<s> I would like to see some sort of review process for sites submitted.  </s>

<s> I don't really want a guestbook full of such urls.  </s>
<s> Good looking sites is more than a bit subjective, things like content, navigation consistency and so forth should be considered as well.  </s>
<s> I submitted my site mostly because it follows all of the basics of accessible design in being valid html, valid css, consistent navigation and when styles are off, the navigation *follows* the content instead of proceeding it.  </s>
