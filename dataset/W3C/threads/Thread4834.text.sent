In 7.4.1.1 (concat), the second example is: fn:concat('Thy ', (), 'old ', "groans ", "", ' ring', ' yet', ' in', ' my', ' ancient',' ears.') returns " Thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears. 
". 
There is a clearly a space after "groans" and before "ring", but only one space appears between "groans" and "ring" in the output string. 
Either there should be two spaces or one should be removed from the input. 
--Sarah I think your comment is actually against the [F&amp;O] Working Draft not the [XQuery] Working Draft. 
Do you agree?

Sorry for the confusion.
