<s> Hi, A question that comes to mind is what would be motivating people to make their web pages accessible.  </s>
<s> That might be something to include when researching developers.  </s>
<s> Another question is how much effort are they willing to put into making the web pages accessible?  </s>
<s> What priority is there for accessibility in the web pages?  </s>

<s> As part of my research I am intending to contact developers to find out how they would like to learn about accessibility.  </s>
<s> It seems to be important to discover whether they would like to read Guidelines and use checklists, or use automatic checkers like Bobby, or attend courses or workshops, or, as Kelly suggests, if they use authoring tools, whether they think these should produce accessible HTML.  </s>
<s> Or, indeed, whether they would like a combination of all these things!  </s>
<s> In my opinion, if we can find out how people would prefer to be educated, we have a much better chance of succeeding.  </s>
<s> It may be that some developers have never thought about access for people with disabilities let alone how, for example, a blind person uses the Web.  </s>
<s> Therefore developers may also like to learn more about these practicalities in order to put guidelines etc into a more real context.  </s>
<s> It is also possible that the person who creates a page does not have any control over some aspects of its design.  </s>
<s> I came across an interesting situation recently where a researcher for a large UK company was creating Web pages for his particular project.  </s>
<s> The pages contained frames, very small fonts, and clashing text and background colours.  </s>
<s> When I asked about this he said that all of these things were imposed on him by the company's webmaster and so my contact had no control over it.  </s>
<s> Obviously, there are many different layers here for us to consider.  </s>
<s> As I am just beginning this part of my research, I would be happy to hear from anyone who has any interesting ideas about how to go about this.  </s>

<s> taking into account their audience and the type of web matter they are doing, it comes down to a couple of choices.  </s>
<s> If they are doing public business or are envolved in government or education here in the u s in any case, they are subject to pollicy.  </s>
<s> If they are doing business of any kind, it would stand to reason, that the shear numbers of people that might be attracted to their sites would it were that they were more readable for all might turn the tide.  </s>
<s> In none of these senarios fits, or if other constraints prevail, there is nothing to move the mountain.  </s>
<s> it is in everyone's interest to have information that is given given in a way which is accessable to all.  </s>
<s> Instead of asking what motivates people to produce accessable sites, we should perhaps make it so appealing to do so that they can't refuse.  </s>
<s> microsoft has some passages which summ this up pretty in their accessability documents.  </s>
<s> Why should accessability be a factor in design?  </s>

<s> Hi, I think it is very important to understand what motivates or will motivate a web site developer to make his/her web site accessible.  </s>
<s> I agree that a certain percentage of web sites will need to be accessible because of various laws, ADA, etc.  </s>
<s> In terms of business motivation, the underlying forces are less clear.  </s>
<s> One consideration a business would have is how many potential, qualified customers are blind.  </s>
<s> If the business believes that not many of its customers are blind, the effort for developing and testing accessible web sites may not be worth it.  </s>
<s> (Readability of a web site is important, but accessibility of a web site is more than that.) A third group of web site developers, probably the largest group, develop their sites for non-business reasons and are not under any legal obligations to make a site accessible.  </s>
<s> What will motivate these people?  </s>
<s> I'm at a loss to know how to make accessibility so attractive that it can't be refused.  </s>
<s> Perhaps a goal of making accessibility easier to include in web sites would be more reasonable.  </s>
<s> Scott  </s>
<s> shear numbers make it more proffetable.  </s>
<s> we are not talking just about the blind here.  </s>
<s> If I use a 286 and don't have access to the web but only to email, I cannot benefit from a website with features that stymie current access software.  </s>
<s> so, including me who is not disabled except in the sense that my equipment and access are not state of the art increases the numbers dramatically in terms of accessability.  </s>
<s> How people learn is a good thing to know and this is currently evidenced by the plethora of ways in which people access learning materials both on and off line.  </s>
<s> There are numerous workshops, seminars, demonstrations, books, magazines and many more formats not discounting classroom lectures on and off line that provide a medium for distributing information.  </s>
<s> Perhaps we need to aggressively seek out those who do the teaching and those who make the decissions as to what a website will be designed around with appropriate information and conduits.  </s>
<s> As with tv for one instance, we will never reach all to success for one reason or annother, but we will put preasure on in the market place and some will do what their peers are doing.  </s>
<s> I also think that relying on the medium to help us is also a good strategy.  </s>
<s> I've been mostly successfull in my contacts with publishers of web sites when contacting them with specific information concerning the accessability and readabillity of their sites.  </s>
<s> Educating the consumer in this case can and does go a long way to helping solve the problem of making developpers aware and motivated towards making accessability a part of their goals.  </s>
<s> often, it is after the fact, but in some cases I've gotten requests from people who are working on sites and have asked for access assistance before the site is published.  </s>
<s> I do a lot of referring.  </s>
<s> I also take a look at pages and edit portions to show how they may be made more accessable.  </s>
<s> I've been asked by people who have a problem with a site to look at and also to provide them with guidance on how to approach web developpers.  </s>
<s> Lastly, if we can get the publishers of web developpment software in on this, it can be less likely that sites will be developped that will not be accessable or at least as accessable as can be hoped.  </s>

<s> Hi, Actually, I'm not sure how many business web sites are concerned about reaching all possible customers.  </s>
<s> From what I've been seeing on the different web master mailing lists I monitor, the idea seems to be to attract as many customers while minimizing effort.  </s>
<s> Most webmasters on these lists seem unconcerned about people who use 286's or Lynx.  </s>
<s> I'd say a current concern is about using Java or Javascript.  </s>
<s> Lynx or browser's on 286's are not not getting many webmasters' aatention.  </s>
<s> You have an excellent point that web development software needs to accomodate web page accessibility.  </s>
<s> In addition, this development software itself must be accessible.  </s>
