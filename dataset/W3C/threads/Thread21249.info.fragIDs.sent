Marja- Is there a web page detailing the new work in Annotations? 
Last I checked, http://www.w3.org/Collaboration/ still has Karen MacArthur's name on it; it was updated on 1999/11/30-- what was updated? 
MK: Sorry, the late answer. 
I have been traveling around too much lately. 
The old collaboration page (http://www.w3.org/Collaboration/) is still pretty much the same, we just added some links to our work. 
Information about our presentation at WWW9 developers day can be found from More detailed information is in ucture Although basic things are working we are still in an early phase in this project. 
JG: Also, where is the discussion list which will track this W3 project. 
This one? 
Or another? 
MK: I think this is a perfectly good list for discussions around the annotations. 
Some things are related to RDF so there was a suggestion to have another thread there, but let's first see if we need that. 
It would be nice to get all the annotation developers that we met in Amsterdam to join here too. 
JG: Perhaps w3 might also move towards some of the advanced discussion group systems on the market. 
Many are much more flexible than plain ol' email lists. 
MK: If you have suggestions about good features that you are missing could you send them to the list. 
At times it might be possible to improve something. 
Asking everybody to buy a selected collaboration system is not going to be very successful as we want to include as many people to the discussions as possible.

Hello, I'm been running around as well. 
I organized a BOF (birds of a feather) meeting at WWW9 with the intention to try to create renewed standards activity in the www-annotation list. 
About 20 people attending during the course of the meeting (though most of the W3C folks had to leave the meeting early). 
I am going to summarize the discussions in that meeting and present them to the list soon (like early next week). 
I have also gone through the WWW9 proceedings and identified everyone who presented who has an active interest in annotations systems. 
I am presently codifying that list and extending it to include commercial companies with an interest in annotation systems. 
The consensus of the BOF was to create a concerted activity in the www-annotation mailing list with the intention to progress toward a specific standardization activity for annotation systems, and for demonstration implementations of such standards. 
I have volunteered to coordinate the creation of this statement with the W3C (via Ralph Swick). 
The goal is to create a statement that reflects the interest and then notify those interested parties. 
Please note that CTI is not a W3C member organization at this time. 
However I did discuss options for renewing standards activities with W3C staff at some length while at the conference.

Just wanted to introduce the group to Lucid Fried Eggs, php-based collaboration software. 
I've put together a little collaboration page at www.memes.net. 
Feel free to modify any page you see there, or add new notes. 
Lucid is similar to Wiki, except that links from one note to another are structured. 
Each link must be of a specific type: parent, child or jump. 
This creates a nice navigation scheme. 
It's a bit chaotic, because anyone can modify any page. 
On the other hand, that feature makes it useful for annotating other people's work. 
The biggest problem is scalability. 
If two people are editing a note at the same time, the last one to post the changes will override the other one.

I am very keen to find out if there are any lurkers on this list who live within cooee of me. 
I'm in Sydney and would dearly like to have a local get together with others to discuss and compare practical instances of uses of web annotations You're welcome to call me at the number below.
