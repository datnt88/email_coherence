Hi all. 
Is it generally considered bad HTML form to have a hypertext link in a document that goes right to an image? 
It seems to me that such links generally go to an image that's complex enough that the author intended to fill the whole screen with it, and yet I can't think how one would provide a text-accessible description for such an image if the image isn't contained in anything. 
Is this a reasonable way to think about this issue? 
One other quick question: Can anybody tell me where to look for a description of the proper use of the longdesc attribute? 
Thanks, Jerry Weichbrodt 
Yes, a "raw image" linked from a page has accessibility problems; if you create even a minimal HTML page "wrapper" around it, you can add alternative text and other information.

In my experience, when this is done the linked image is usually just a larger version of an image on the preceding page - which should have it's own alt text. 
I, for example, maintain a personal 'web photo album', where the web pages have thumbnails of the photos, which each link to a larger version of the photo. 
Having a separate web page for each photo would be redundant, and a LOT more work. 
Each photo on the thumbnail pages has alt text which is the 'caption' of the photo, and which I would probably just re-use if each photo had its own page. 
I suppose if I had more textual information about each photo, I would want to have it in a separate page, but I have enough trouble just writing captions for them!

aloha, kynn!

unquote with most of today's technology, kynn, you're right -- and, yet, technically, there's no reason why you shouldn't be able to point to a naked image if you utilize the LONGDESC attribute -- which, would, of course, necessitate support for LONGDESC by quote mainstream unquote browser manufacturers, and it wouldn't hurt if they were also Dublin Core [1] aware -- _then_ the user (no matter whom, no matter the type of device) could not only choose what he or she gets, but actually know (with confidence!) what one is using one's precious bandwidth to obtain... support for LONGDESC would obviously obviate the need for a wrapper, if it is unnecessary or undesired, but would still leave the user with a multitude of options, such as: render the image and the LONGDESC as one document; display the content of the file referenced via LONGDESC in a separate viewport/window, and so on... my conscience just tapped me on the shoulder to remind me that there are proxies to be built to deliver this sort of functionality on the fly to a request coming from older technology, such as an HTTP request from Lynx running on a shell account or someone running a commodore or atari that they bought on eBay, but i temporarily hushed it by reminding it that for embedded images, i use the "encase the image in a link that points at the URI referenced by the LONGDESC attribute" hack to expose the presence of long descriptions to the user by making the graphic itself a link to the URI referenced in the LONGDESC attribute set for the IMG element -- if, that is, the graphic warrants a long description -- sometimes ALT (especially when used in intelligent combination with the "title" attribute) is quite enough ... speaking of LONGDESCs, a question i've been pondering is, should a document referenced using LONGDESC include a link to the quote naked unquote image? 
and if not, why not? 
isn't that providing an equivalent alternative to the descriptor? 
of course, if the graphic was actually an XML based application -- marked up, in Scaleable Vector Graphics (SVG) [2] -- the image itself could not only be richly described, but distinct parts and components of that image could also be richly described, making it possible for users to get a lot, or a little, or none of the alternative information it is possible to embed in an SVG file -- depending, of course, upon the user's need or desire... just one of the many reasons why an XML-based graphics syntax, such as SVG, is far superior to rasterized (binary) graphics, but i don't need to tell you that! gregory References 1.

I find that some multimedia catalogue software is useful for this kind of thing. 
I use "iView Multimedia" (for Mac), which will output an HTML gallery from your image library, and caption it based on keywords, comments etc. that you can add with iView. 
Makes updating easy, but you would have to add ALT tags, unless you could add them with Applescript or something. 
Maybe I should contact the author to mention the issue - the software could easily be updated to automatically create them. 
I'm not sure what equivalents are available for Windows.
