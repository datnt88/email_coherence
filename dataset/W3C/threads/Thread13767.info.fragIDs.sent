(I originally sent this only to the -ig list, because it was in response to one that had been sent only to the -ig list. 
However, I'm asked in email to conduct this discussion on the -gl list, so here goes, with minor editing)... (about using the ALT attribute to provide a description of the image) 
It's text, 
yes 
it's an alternative, 
this is where I disagree. 
It's not, in general, a real alternative... 
and it's presented when the image is not displayed. 
yes 
Seems to fit to me. 
Superficially, maybe, but it doesn't address the "topic of discourse" (a rather pompous phrase, sorry, to describe a rather important concept) 
While I agree that it's better to replicate the function of an image when the image has an external function, 
Not only. 
If the image is conveying information (about the topic of discourse) then the alternative text should also be conveying information about the topic of discourse. 
Providing a description of the image is, in general, not the same thing as conveying information about the topic of discourse. 
Succinctly put, can it be considered "accessible" to withhold either information 
I'm not asking you to withhold information. 
You have the TITLE and LONGDESC attributes of the IMG (or interim D-link) also (and the TITLE attribute of the anchor link, if the IMG is within one); each has its appropriate field of application. 
that could be used to decide whether or not to view an image, or the existence of the image entirely? 
It's the job of the browser to alert the reader to the fact that this ALT text is standing-in for an image, by whatever means the browser designer chooses. 
Most browsers make that clear (it's not quite 
obvious with Lynx, I admit; but the Lynx developers are very receptive 
to accessibility issues: if this forum produces a viable set of principles, I've every confidence that the Lynx developers would find a way to realise those principles in their implementation). 
Certainly it makes reading more comfortable for people who have decided not to interact with images in any way, but at the expense, I would think, of people who may want to interact with SOME images, in SOME manner. 
But that is exactly the way in which I work as a reader (i.e with image loading off, and only loading the specific images I decide that I am interested in), and I believe my authoring advice is quite appropriate for that, even with today's browsers (for which there is still scope for improvement). 
I should stress that I claim no specific expertise in relation to accessibility. 
But a properly marked-up WWW document is meant to be for everybody. 
Put the content-based information into the document markup, and put the presentation-dependent machinery into browsers, that has been the underlying principle of HTML from the start. 
Now, HTML 4.0 could change this, using the title attribute. 
So is it acceptable to assume that everyone reading your page has a user agent that is title-attribute-aware? 
TITLE isn't really new, it's been on the agenda for at least 2 years; LONGDESC is new. 
I understand your reservations about current browsers, but we really must not choose the wrong long-term answer because of short-term problems. 
Transitional arrangements are always possible - but first we must have a clear idea of what we are trying to transition _to_. 
1) Replace stylized text images with the equivalent text. 
Sure: preferably use style sheets _instead_ of making images of text. 
2) Replace images that have an external function (link, warning icon, etc.) with a word or phrase that replicates the function. 
Failing that, replace it with a word or phrase that describes the function. 
I agree 
3) Replace images with no external function (i.e., images that are there just to be images) 
I don't understand what you mean by this. 
Surely no-one scatters random images in their documents for no purpose? 
Whatever their purpose was for providing the image, that also should be the purpose of the ALT text. 
That is the genuine "alternative" in my opinion, and that is a property of the author's document itself; it's not an attempt to bolt-on extra accessibility - something which, to be candid about the majority of authors, will only be done reluctantly and without much consideration (present company, naturally, excepted!). 
Meaningful ALT text is something which even an author untutored in accessibility needs can be expected to supply, whereas the specific needs of different audiences are best addressed by the designers of specialised browsers, who understand how best to _present_ the available _information content_ in different situations, and thus leverage the effort across the WWW, irrespective of the individual WWW authors. 
And I still say that there's a case for empty ALT texts, in specific circumstances. 
If they cause a problem with a particular browser, then let the browser solve the problem. 
Lynx, to take an example, has no problem with this (you just issue the "*" keycommand if you want handles on all images, or you start up with that option as your default if you wish). 
Typical graphical browsers leave you in no doubt about the presence of images, with or without ALT="". 
best regards 
I don't think it should be clear. 
Since the ALT text is a replacement for the image, the average reader shouldn't even know which text is normal text and which is ALT text. 
A document presented aurally would flow much better 
without screams of "Hey, there's an image here". 
Naturally the user should have the option to enable those distractions if he or she chooses, but, in my opinion, the default should be for ALT text and normal text to be indistinguishable. 
I prefer Lynx's default presentation of ALT text.

My apologies. 
I should rather have said that it's the job of the browser to give the reader the option to be alerted to the fact that the ALT text is standing-in for an image. 
Readers who do not wish this should, of course, have the option to turn it off (or to not turn it on). 
And so do I, usually; but anyone who prefers to be alerted would have to issue the "*" keycommand, and the resulting [LINK]-[IMAGE] displays may be considered rather obtrusive.
