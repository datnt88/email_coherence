I haven't had any difficulty as i run a utility that adds/removes cr for moving between m$ and everyone else. 
However if it is easy to add to amaya then go for it. 
The mechanism for selection should be in Preferences as it normally would be set one way or other. 
It is not desireable to make it a part of SaveAs dialog unless it was preset to Preference selection and only touched on a one off basis.... 
The big question is why one would be using NotePad anyways.... 
In the windows world Textpad is far superior as it at least has spellcheck and html tagging thru macros. 
John Russell, VE3LL@RAC.CA Be sure to check your HTML markup code tags by using http://validator.w3.org or For utility: it's very lightweight, doesn't mess up fonts when pasting, doesn't inadvertantly double space your lines, or have any rubbish like spellcheking that eats up memory. 
Yes, it would be easy to write a Python script or whatever to fiddle about with the whitespace, but it would be nicer to have the feature in Amaya in the first place IMO. 
Plenty of feature requests for Amaya though, like don't treat line breaks as whitespace: when editing in a text editor, you have to remember to add a space when re-formatting. Kindest Regards, Sean B. Palmer @prefix : http://webns.net/roughterms/ .

I let people decide what is good for us. 
The good news is that the new Amaya version will let you generate CR/LF if you want. 
Amaya doesn't decide itself to "treat line breaks as whitespace", it just follows HTML and XML specifications.
