Anyway, I think the most widely accessible chat system (except for people with significant intellectual disabilities, or difficulty typing and no voice input systems - both groups who are not well-served by most existing chat systems) is based on IRC - there are any number of clients, including some that work well with screen readers, some rudimentary attempts at producing them to work well for various other users, and it is available on virtually every software platform.

Right. 
There is in fact a client that is based on using picture symbols - I don't have the information to hand, and I don't know if it uses IRC as its underlying protocol, but it should be readily adaptable.

FYI: Here at WebAIM a web based chat was developed for a few distance education classes at Utah State University (USU), and I believe it will be used next month for our On-line Web Accessibility Training Event. 
It seems to work very well. 
The feedback we have received has been very positive so far. 
In our situation we could not find a solution so we created our own and hope to develope it further. 
This has been our approach to many situations where accessibility is a must but accessible software does not exist. 
Jared Smith, the developer of the USU chat, also wrote an article on our website about the accessibility of chat programs.

Well, IRC is outdated in the sense that Unix is outdated. 
Its benefits are that it works pretty well, there are lots of compatible systems and servers and clients, etc. (It is one of the tools that W3C uses a lot internally, and we also use it to support access to meetings for people who have difficulty with the telephone - hearing or speaking difficulties, bad phone lines, need to be able to read what was said two minutes ago again, ...) I know of blind users who have experience with an IRC client in emacs, using emacspeak, an mIRC, a windows client. 
There are lots of others for different situtations, and there is a client built into Mozilla that uses images for some things... cheers Charles McCN David,

IRC 
One can read that every time someone (generally a commercial interest) wants to sell a rival system. 
It's been outdated for at least 8 years now, and has more users than ever. 
I use irc when I chat at all mostly because it does not send me through 
hoops to use it. 
There are a couple of home grown systems that aren't bad but they are especially developped for a particular situation and are not widely used. 
David, Thank you.
