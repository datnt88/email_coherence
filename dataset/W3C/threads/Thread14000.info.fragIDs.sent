<s> This is a proposal from the editors that we remove the priorities from the guidelines and just have priorities on the techniques.  </s>
<s> RATIONALE *We have 17 guidelines at the present time.  </s>
<s> Only four of which are priority two and none of which are priority three.  </s>
<s> *The guidelines themselves aren't assigned a priority based upon their merit.  </s>
<s> They, in fact, inherit their priority as being whatever the highest priority of the technique that is listed under them.  </s>
<s> The result is that it is not entirely clear why one guideline would have a priority one while another which sounds about the same would have a priority two.  </s>
<s> We also have situations where all of the techniques underneath the priority are priority two except for one.  </s>
<s> As a result, the entire guideline ends up with a priority one.  </s>
<s> We also have one priority where it is listed as a priority two, but it should probably be a priority one in many cases.  </s>
<s> As a result, we would like to suggest that we remove the priorities from the guidelines and just have it on the techniques.  </s>
<s> This would also remove the paragraph immediately after the description of the priorities, which awkwardly tries to describe why both the guidelines and the techniques have priorities.  </s>
<s> We will be releasing a new version of the guidelines later this afternoon.  </s>
<s> In that version we have not removed the priority on the guidelines.  </s>
<s> There has been some re-organization and consolidation (see separate note to follow).  </s>
<s> Please look over this version and see whether or not it looks as if we would do just as well (or better) to remove the priorities from the guidelines and just maintain them on the strategies.  </s>
<s> Thanks much.  </s>

<s> I appreciate the rationale motivating this proposal.  </s>
<s> The only disadvantage is that it makes the relative importance of each of the principles enunciated in the guidelines explicitly dependent on that part of the document which is most subject to change, namely the techniques.  </s>
<s> As Gregg recognises, this is the case already, since the priority assigned to each guideline is determined by the highest priority level among its associated techniques.  </s>
<s> It would be helpful to find a means of expressing the relative priorities of the stable principles of universal design which the guidelines themselves are supposed to embody.  </s>
<s> No solutions come to mind, however.  </s>
<s> I think then we are left with a list of guidelines to be followed, all effectively P1.  </s>
<s> There are techniques.  </s>
<s> Where they are relevant the importance of using that technique has a priority.  </s>
<s> I think we should say something like this in the document if we do remove priorites.  </s>

<s> Hello Charles I don't think priorities should be eliminated altogether but perhaps re-thought through.  </s>
<s> There are certain fundamental practices, like including ALT text for images, which should carry more weight than the practice of say, including ALT text for objects, simply because images are the most common accessibility barrier and everyone should be familiar with the problems they pose for adaptive technology users.  </s>
<s> We are currently developing a tool for measuring the extent to which web authoring tools promote accessibility (HTML editors and conversion tools, and web based course authoring packages) .  </s>
<s> We have found that promotion of accessibility must be measured in relation to a product's functionality.  </s>
<s> To accomplish this, priorities were used to add weight to the more fundemental practices, awarding or penalizing products for providing provisions for them or not.  </s>
<s> For example, a product is awarded more points for providing a way to include ALT text with images than for providing a way to include ALT text for Objects.  </s>
<s> Likewise they are penalized more for not providing a way to add ALT text to images than they are for not providing a way to add ALT text to objects.  </s>
<s> With regard to functionality, products are awarded points for providing tools to create various components of Web pages and are assessed on the extent to which those particular tools promote accessibility.  </s>
<s> The results provide three scores, functionality, accessibility, and the ratio between the two.  </s>
<s> I agree that a weighting scheme should be discussed.  </s>
<s> As our measurement tool currently exists, based on the WAI guidelines, I am not convinced that all of the priorities have been weighted appropriately.  </s>
<s> I will make a copy of the Excel measurement tool and its accompanying documentation available for anyone interested in providing input into it's development.  </s>

<s> Hmmm.  </s>
<s> The problem is that the guidelines are not based on 'today', but on what is going to remain true for a while.  </s>
<s> If OBJECT were more common than IMG, your argument would be reversed.  </s>
<s> So the appraoch in the guidelines is 'What things are going to make life impossible for users?' 'ALT text on IMG, content for OBJECT, transcripts/captions for audio and video'.  </s>
<s> So all of those things are priority one.  </s>
<s> The things that are really horrible, but not insoluble, are priority two.  </s>
<s> And things that are nice things to do, but won't make life really difficult for people if they are ignored, are priority three.  </s>
<s> It's a rough system, but it is meant to be robust and stable, which I think it is.  </s>
<s> I think that it can be applied to the texhniques, on the basis that the guidelines are all important to be followed, as per the Rationale thta Gregg originally published.  </s>
<s> The number of techniques which are relevant, and their priority, in a given case, is probably a good rough guide to how important the guideline is in a given case.  </s>
<s> (I haven't been sold on this yet.  </s>
<s> But I have put the money aside from the weekly budget, and I'm trying to think of where it would be best.) Charles  </s>
