Is it possible to implement SSL or STLP for all winsock communications? 
For example, I would like to encrypt all FTP communication with a specific server, without depending on the FTP client application used. 
So - is this possible? 
Is there such an implementation? 
Thanks, Yonat. 
It depends on the SSL implementation. 
That means that you can't negotiate the use of SSL in the FTP protocol. 
So if the ftp server you're talking to does not do SSL, you will not be able to communicate. 
I think it's better to use the FTP options to negotiate SSL. 
Yes. 
Not that I'm aware of.

We do this on our B2 Unix implementation (DG/UX), and a partner is implementing this for Windows. 
The actual implementation will allow arbitrary filters to be configured for specific types of connections for specific users and/or specific hosts. 
SSL will be one of the original filters offered. 
This is not currently available. 
If you would like additional info, let me know.
