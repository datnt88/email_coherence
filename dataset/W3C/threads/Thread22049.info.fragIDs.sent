<s> Indeed.  </s>
<s> I've got a whole bunch more issues, which I'll dump here on the list for the moment (because its a bit much to file single Bugzilla reports on).  </s>
<s> DOMBuilderTest3: there is whitespace in test2.xml, but the test assumes it will be ignored for some reason.  </s>
<s> Also the final nodeName refers to secondElt1 when clearly it should be thirdElt.  </s>
<s> On a related note, is it safe to put a ?xml  </s>
<s> text declaration at the start of a file used by parseWithContext?  </s>
<s> As far as I can see, the LS specification says nowhere whether an 'XML fragment' is the same thing as an external parsed entity.  </s>
<s> (If it's not, files like this could fail due to an invalid processing instructions.)  </s>
<s> DOMBuilderTest5: the DOMConfiguration parameters are wrong, containing underscores instead of hyphens.  </s>
<s> Also supported-media-types-only is an optional feature - should check canSetParameter first.  </s>
<s> DOMBuilderTest6: I don't see where the spec states that parsing an empty input results in null - it only mentions null return values for async parsers.  </s>
<s> An empty Document or some kind of error might also be possible?  </s>
<s> DOMBuilderTest7: doesn't do what it says it does.  </s>
<s> It claims to use a null  </s>
<s> LSInput but actually creates one, effectively doing the same thing as DOMBuilderTest6.  </s>
<s> DOMEntityResolverTest1: assumes external entities are actually resolved.  </s>
<s> Should add a 'validating' implementationAttribute.  </s>
<s> DOMImplementationLSTest1: has a hasFeature 'temporarily commented out' that should probably be put back in.  </s>
<s> DOMImplementationLSTest3: assumes the implementation supports schemas.  </s>
<s> This is not required.  </s>
<s> Could raise NOT_SUPPORTED_ERR.  </s>
<s> DOMInputSourceTest3: invalid.  </s>
<s> Document.inputEncoding should not be affected by the original LSInput.encoding unless a byteStream was used.  </s>
<s> DOMWriterFilterTest0: acceptNode's parameter should be 'nodeArg', no longer 'n'.  </s>
<s> (does this require fiddling with TSML?)  </s>
<s> DOMWriterFilterTest1: tries to use SHOW_ATTRIBUTE, but this is not declared anywhere (should be in &amp;filterVars;).  </s>
<s> Then tries to test for the acceptance of the attr1 node, but this should actually be filtered out according to the given LSSerializerFilter: unlike with LSParserFilters, Attribute nodes and the document element node are, I believe, supposed to be passed to acceptNode.  </s>
<s> Spec is currently unclear on what happend if a filter declines to be SHOWn an element; in Range 2.0's NodeFilter, this would result in a SKIP, not an ACCEPT, but I don't now if this is supposed to apply to 3.0 LS too.  </s>
<s> DOMWriterFilterTest3: SHOW_COMMENT again not defined in &amp;filterVars;.  </s>
<s> CharacterStream1, SystemId1: tries to create an LSParser with mode 0. No such mode, should be 1.  </s>
<s> LSParserConfig6: the description gives the wrong parameter name, it is in fact testing infoset.  </s>
<s> However, it tests to see whether you can directly set it to false - which should have no effect.  </s>
<s> To test it with a false value, set one of the other parameters it affects to the 'wrong' value.  </s>
<s> LSParserConfig7: tries to set namespaces true and then tests it is false.  </s>
<s> Oop.  </s>
<s> (ah, you noted this one already)  </s>
<s> LSParserConfig8, LSSerializer8: actually tests for xml-declaration instead of well-formed  </s>
<s> LSSerializerConfig1: xml-declaration should be true by default, not false, surely?  </s>
<s> LSSerializerConfig2: normalize-characters is listed twice.  </s>
<s> So the result will be 22, not 23.  </s>
<s> LSSerializerConfig6: ignore-unknown-character-denormalizations shoud be true by default, not false.  </s>
<s> The canSet test and the values in the assertDOMException are hence also the wrong way around.  </s>
<s> And here are the test results for pxdom 1.0-pre, WITHOUT fixing the tests for the above issues.  </s>
<s> The remaining failures are mostly to do with pxdom's lack of support for ResourceResolvers, which are omitted for the moment as they're a bit pointless until external entities are fully supported.  </s>

<s> that can explain some of the errors (e.g. in the missing parameter department), but not all...  </s>
<s> I've fixed the thirdElt problem and stripped test2.xml of whitespace and the XML declaration.  </s>
<s> However, the question on exactly what parser with  </s>
<s> context needs to support is a good one and worthy of independent tests.  </s>
<s> The underscores are in the names of the local variables that contain the string values.  </s>
<s> The values themselves should have hyphens.  </s>
<s> I have  </s>
<s> changed the test to support the optionality of supported-media-types-only.  </s>
<s> Fully running the test would require accessing an HTTP server that reports an unsupported media type, loading  </s>
<s> a file from the file system, even if its extension is .pdf should not be  </s>
<s> sufficient.  </s>
<s> I've put in a temporary http://localhost URL.  </s>
<s> Several of  </s>
<s> the serialization tests also require a properly condifigured HTTP server, however none of my available implementations can get far enough  </s>
<s> to fail due to its absense.  </s>
<s> This should result in an fatal error being reported to the error handler.  </s>
<s> I've assumed that any fatal error during a parse would result in a null return value, there is no provision for throwing a checked exception (such as an io exception) and returning a partial document would break XML's requirement that you can't ignore fatal errors.  </s>
<s> However, the spec should be more explicit on the return value and/or exceptions expected during parsing failures.  </s>
<s> I'll try to flesh out more failure tests and then raise the issue to the WG. Oracle throws a  </s>
<s> INVALID_STATE_ERR though it isn't a scenarion described in the exceptions list, Xerces-J throws a NullPointerException.  </s>
<s> Removed the extraneous createLSInput.  </s>
<s> Done.  </s>
<s> The earlier version of Oracle that I've been using doesn't return true, though it appears to support async loading.  </s>
<s> Since it is my only available implementation with any support for asych loading, commenting out the hasFeature allows me to actually run the body of the test.  </s>
<s> Done.  </s>
<s> The spec is explicit that LSInput.encoding should be ignored.  </s>
<s> I've split the test into two parts (3 and 6), one for characterStreams and one for strings, since ECMAScript bindings don't support character  </s>
<s> streams.  </s>
<s> LSInput.encoding is set to UTF-8 but document.inputEncoding is expected to be 'UTF-16'.  </s>
<s> LSSerializerFilter in the candidate recommendation extends NodeFilter in traversal.  </s>
<s> L2 Traversal's NodeFilter uses n as the parameter name.  </s>
<s> Why  </s>
<s> do you think it should be nodeArg.  </s>
<s> I've added SHOW_ATTRIBUTE and SHOW_COMMENT to dom3tests.ent.  </s>
<s> If they had been used outside of an inner class, they would have been detected by schema validation.  </s>
<s> However, in this case schema validation did not catch them and since the inner class extended NodeFilter, Java didn't complain either.  </s>
<s> Both Xerces-J and XDK pass this test apparaently assuming that if not shown an node the response is assumed to be accept.  </s>
<s> This seems to be the desirable interpretation, but if you don't think the spec is explicit enough, please raise it as an issue in the spec.  </s>
<s> Done.  </s>
<s> Late night cut and paste.  </s>
<s> I've modified the test for infoset's peculiarities, please review.  </s>
<s> Done.  </s>
<s> Comment changed.  </s>
<s> Done.  </s>
<s> Done.  </s>
<s> Done.  </s>
<s> I already raised this issue more or less at the end of There should be an exception as far as I'm concerned, not a null return value.  </s>
<s> Not just for empty inputs but also for incorrect documents, missing files etc. Kind regards, --Sander.  </s>
<s> Great! Thanks for the swift fixes.  </s>
<s> (Incidentally: have updated Python domts package to handle the append-item change and a few others - http://www.doxdesk.com/file/software/py/domts.zip)  </s>
<s> I'm still seeing whitespace - a newline at the end.  </s>
<s> Probably CVS has done this.  </s>
<s> (Would require a checkin-as-binary to fix?)  </s>
<s> D'oh. Excuse my foolishness!  </s>
<s> Well... it might be, on a filesystem that stores media type info in metadata (Mac OS does doesn't it?). Whether the extension could be said to constitute such metadata on its own is another issue.  </s>
<s> Anyway, I agree it's probably not something TS should be relying on.  </s>
<s> Yep. Possibly a variant of createTempHttpURI could be created for this eventuality, eg. createTempHttpURI method="get" (as opposed to "put" for the write-to-URI test)?  </s>
<s> SystemId2 works fine for me.  </s>
<s> Agree, thanks.  </s>
<s> Hmm. Not sure about this, should a string be considered to have an encoding at all?  </s>
<s> A bit tricky for Python because although DOMString is 16-bit, it is bound to native string types, which could equally be 8-bit (in which case the encoding would be 'us-ascii'), or 32-bit (in which case it is 'utf-32').  </s>
<s> (In practical terms, setting document.inputEncoding  </s>
<s> when creating a document from a string would mean that it would default to being saved as UTF-16 instead of the usual UTF-8.  </s>
<s> Not sure this is desirable, but again the spec should really clarify.)  </s>
<s> Ah. You're right: only LSSerializerFilter inherits from NodeFilter, LSParser doesn't, which is why the argument names can be different.  </s>
<s> Oops.  </s>
<s> Have done already, yes.  </s>
<s> I would agree that Accept is the intuitive answer, and for the moment pxdom also exhibits this behaviour.  </s>
<s> However this runs counter to the established behaviour of NodeFilter.  </s>
<s> hmm.  </s>
<s> I've modified the test for infoset's peculiarities, please review.  </s>
<s> Looks correct and works for me.  </s>
<s> OK, if these really are meaning to test for xml-declaration, the canSetFalse tests should be assertTrues instead of false (which would make sense for well-formed).  </s>
<s> cheers, Andrew Clover  </s>
<s> Does the terminal whitespace cause the test to fail?  </s>
<s> I think I know a way that this test could be done on Java without having an external resource.  </s>
<s> Pretty complicated, so it isn't going to be on the top of my list until I just need a challenge.  </s>
<s> Could add a  </s>
<s> contentType attribute to getResourceURI.  </s>
<s> If that is specified, it would create a "x-jar:" URL that would also encode the expected content type.  </s>
<s> Would have to register a protocol handler for "x-jar:" that would extract the content type and delegate to the regular jar: protocol handler.  </s>
<s> For ECMAScript, the content type would be ignored and you would have to depend on the HTTP server delivering the test files to provide an appropriate content type.  </s>
<s> Cool. Hopefully, it didn't overwrite your home page.  </s>
<s> The spec explicitly addresses what should be attempted if the URL is  </s>
<s> http. SystemId1 attempts to write to a file: URL.  </s>
<s> I think it represents a reasonable expectation, but might overreach what is actually in the spec.  </s>
<s> Both of these tests can fail for external  </s>
<s> causes.  </s>
<s> If you shut down the local http server or change the permissions, a conformant implementation can fail SystemId2.  </s>
<s> If don't have priviledges to write a temporary file, SystemId1 can fail.  </s>
<s> Should raise this to the working group.  </s>
<s> I'd would like it if the names could be synchronized that is renaming nodeArg to n,  </s>
<s> I believe these were intended as tests on 'well-formed' and 'xml-declaration' was just a cut and paste error.  </s>
<s> I've comitted changes as a continuation of bug 441.  </s>
<s> Yes, because the next-sibling-of-next-sibling tested is whitespace.  </s>
<s> (Similarly another test uses a previous-sibling test to check INSERT_BEFORE.)  </s>
<s> Ouch. Yeah, that seems a bit excessive!  </s>
<s> I don't think an external resource is necessarily such a bad thing, if made available on a known server and optional (so one could still use localhost instead if the external server were not contactable).  </s>
<s> Heh. (No, I haven't got a proper HTTP PUT server hanging around, so I just hacked up a trivial CGI to respond 201 to any request.)  </s>
<s> I think this is more than reasonable, yes.  </s>
<s> If don't have priviledges to write a temporary file, SystemId1 can fail.  </s>
<s> It could perhaps be the test runtime's responsibility to check that a createTempSomethingURI refers to a resource that can successfully be written to before calling the tested implementation.  </s>
<s> Me too.  </s>
<s> I guess no project in the world other than TS actually depends on the exact argument names given in the spec, but this is still desirable from a consistency point of view.  </s>
<s> (Currently I've had to special-case the TSML interpreter for acceptNode, as well as XPath's evaluate.) Andrew Clover  </s>
