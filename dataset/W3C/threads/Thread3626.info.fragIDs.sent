<s> If anyone wants to help develop it  </s>

<s> See http://www.w3.org/International/tests/test-text-transform.html  </s>
<s> I notice so far that IE and Opera strangely fail to transform particular  </s>
<s> characters, whereas Firebird 0.6.1 does.  </s>
<s> No browser seems to deal  </s>
<s> properly with Turkish I's or (perhaps not surprisingly) with German esszets.  </s>

<s> Very nice work!  </s>
<s> Some comments:  </s>
<s> - At the end, you have Greek, but you say Cyrillic.  </s>
<s> - For the following case, there is just no chance that this can ever work.  </s>
<s> How should a browser know whether to lowercase 'SS' to 'ss' or to sharp-s: lowercase "de" (German).  </s>
<s> Same for lowercase capitalize.  </s>
<s> Please remove these tests, or change them to test that they don't do anything weird.  </s>
<s> - In the first block, fifth line, fifth entry, something is missing.  </s>
<s> - I would add some more explanations, rather than just "The left-hand character should match the right-hand one.".  </s>
<s> E.g.: In the following, the source contains pairs of characters,  </s>
<s> a lowercase character followed by an upper case character.  </s>
<s> If the transform works correctly, the lower case character will be transformed, and the uppercase character will not change, and so both characters should look the same.  </s>
<s> - You did Latin up to Extended-A, yes.  </s>
<s> So Extended-B and Extended-Additional remain to be done, yes?  </s>
<s> Regards, Martin.  </s>
<s> John, What font do you use to view the page, that has all the characters?  </s>

<s> AHHHH! That is very nice.  </s>
<s> I have the same fonts and the page displays well on Mozilla.  </s>
<s> The other browsers identify that a font exists and then attempt to use that  </s>
<s> font for everything, showing the missing glyph for characters it doesn't have,  </s>
<s> even though other fonts are available.  </s>
<s> Congratulations to the Mozilla folks!  </s>
<s> I was going to suggest specifying some fonts for different blocks in the style section, so that people testing browsers can see if they are getting upper and lower case chars, provided they have the fonts, and naming the fonts used in the intro.  </s>
<s> Without naming fonts, some results can't be seen on the other browsers.  </s>
<s> I note Deseret isn't being transformed in Mozilla yet.  </s>
<s> tex  </s>
<s> Tex Texin scripsit:  </s>
<s> No one font does.  </s>
<s> But Mozilla (at least for Windows) will try to find characters from any available font as a fallback, font, and I have both Code2000 and Code2001 by James Kass loaded.  </s>
<s> So I see it all, with just a few exceptions.  </s>

<s> Well, I suppose one *could* make it work by using a dictionary lookup as you would for Thai wrapping or Japanese entry, although I agree it would be pretty surprising if someone did this.  </s>
<s> I guess that, except for very special stylistic purposes, text-transform: lowercase is pretty well unusable for German.  </s>
<s> RI  </s>
<s> There is a very useful page wrt multilingual fonts at It includes some good quality fonts that support ranges that Arial Unicode MS doesn't - eg. Mongolian.  </s>

<s> Dictionary lookup wouldn't be good enough, because there are words that are otherwise spelled the same (if you think about it, that better had be the case, or it wouldn't make sense to have a separate letter in the first place :-).  </s>
<s> Well, not exactly.  </s>
<s> If you have the original in mixed case, then lowercasing works quite well, because there are no words that start with an (uppercase) sz. (again, that makes sense, because otherwise, there would be an uppercase sz) There is another issue, however, that can cause problems: To shorten text while being politically correct, there is the convention to use upper case in the middle of a word, i.e. "Studenten and Studentinnen" (students (male) and students (female)) is shortened to "StudentINNen".  </s>
<s> The stylistic uppercasing of this is "STUDENTinnEN", and I guess the stylistic lowercasing would be "studentINNen".  </s>
<s> This probably could be taken care of by some context analysis, it wouldn't need a dictionary.  </s>
