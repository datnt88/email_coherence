Questions: 1. Can an "xlink:href" inside a "use" refer to another document according to the SVG spec? 
2. If so, is my syntax below a valid representation? 
3. Also if so, does Amaya currently support this feature? 
In file r.xml, I have.... 
In another document I have Here is an update. 
The syntax was wrong in teh previous email, but Amaya doesn't seem to support the correct syntax either. 
I was able to get the following r-composite to display correctly in Batik. 
If anyone can verify for me that this is indeed valid, yet not supported by Amaya, I would appreciate it. 
r.svg r-composite.svg 
svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" width="17" height="21" use width="16" height="20" xlink:href="/login/brendav/svg/r.svg#r"/

No. It currently supports only local URI references with the use element, i.e. the use element and the element it references must be in the same file. 
There are plans for full support of URIs in the use element, including non-local URI references.
