<s> What if end tag GIs were required only for elements *with subelements* and optional for elements *without*.  </s>
<s> Then the perl hacker's job is not quite as difficult as with nested elements without GIs in end tags and the user would have a hard time getting "lost" in the levels.  </s>
<s> The "short fields" in database records would also be able to almost always use the short form.  </s>
<s> To put the Perl programmer's plight in more formal terms, the language of elements with an optional GI and no subelements is *regular* (can be described with a regular expression) but the language described by the proposal is not.  </s>
<s> grep may or may not be able to deal with this language, because grep is line-oriented (by default or always???), but character oriented searchers should have no problem.  </s>
<s> I think that the regular expression is: chargrep " /foo " | " foo "[^ *]" / " That's a strange syntax, but the equivalent in your favourite syntax should be no more complicated.  </s>
<s> The downside of this proposal is that if you add a sub-element to an element you must add a GI to the endtag.  </s>
<s> Thus the language is a little bit less regular.  </s>
<s> I would accept a slightly less regular language for hundreds of saved keystrokes and those that can't could stick to the end-tag required syntax.  </s>
<s> I suspect that the math people are going to be VERY interested shorttags.  </s>
<s> I'm not saying we should go as far as shortrefs, but I think that a single level of unnamed end tags (as described in is not too hard to search for.  </s>
<s> ASIDE NAME="Idea" What about regular SGML/XML where you have nested recursive elements, such as DIV ?  </s>
<s> There is exactly the same problem for users and perl hackers.  </s>
<s> There should be a way of labelling start and end tags that will allow the parser to determine that they line up.  </s>
<s> Paul Prescod  </s>
<s> If I understand your final suggestion, you are asking to have it legal to have an ID attribute on an end tag.  </s>
<s> Is that correct, or do I misunderstand?  </s>
<s> No, that's just an aside.  </s>
<s> A future consideration.  </s>
<s> The *real* proposal is to allow a single level of shorttag: shorttag only on leaf nodes.  </s>
<s> This is the usage demonstrated in the Microsoft examples and can be described by a strict regular expression rather than a CFG.  </s>
<s> This brings Dirty Perl Hackers back into the game without requiring them to implement a stack.  </s>
<s> I think it is the best of both worlds but nobody else seems interested.  </s>
