<s> Hunting around the contact info page [1], you find that Aaron Leventhal is the contact.  </s>

<s> Glad to hear that the accessmozilla page is interesting reading.  </s>
<s> It really needs updating, however, as evidenced by the out of date contact info (now fixed).  </s>
<s> My apologies for not being more involved in UAAG.  </s>
<s> I'm sure you can imagine the amount of work that needs to be done for Netscape accessibility.  </s>
<s> I'm still just trying to cover the basics, such as screen reader support via MSAA, and full keyboard accessibility.  </s>
<s> Just so you don't think it's all vaporware, Netscape's progress and plans can be found at http://www.mozilla.org/projects/ui/accessibility/  </s>
<s> We have Microsoft Active Accessibility working in the HTML content area, but not for the UI yet.  </s>
<s> Getting the screen readers vendors to actually use the MSAA that we expose is another matter - that's not typically looked for by default, and everyone implements it differently.  </s>
<s> It's not a clear standard, and not cross-platform, which is another problem for us.  </s>
<s> Any advice or thoughts on our plans/progress are always appreciated -- we're on the netscape.public.mozilla.accessibility  </s>
<s> newsgroup.  </s>
<s> It's usually pretty quiet.  </s>
<s> You might expect that, since, well, we've already got a lot to do.  </s>
<s> I'm definitely having fun already, but I think I need some more "partners in crime".  </s>
