Topic 2. Semantic markup (or META information) of documents: How can we use the REL attribute of the Anchor tag to indicate purpose of a link? 
E.g. "nav"? 
Links for site navigation? 
"toc"?? Links that are atable of contents for the page User Agents could create lists of links based on the REL attribute for direct navigation.

There are two different things to consider. 
One is defining a list of roles for document relationship like "next in print order", "toc", etc. 
The other is defining how to encode this relationship. 
We can work on the former in our WAI forum, although it could probably be handled somewhere as it is pretty pervasive (some of it is already in the HTML spec) For the second, the issue is that we have a W3C technology, RDF, that's coming along with a solution for metadata like that, and we also have attributes, such as rel, that already exists in HTML. 
One question is whether it's worth defining a bunch of roles without an agreed way to implement them (assuming we can't make our mind between RDF and simple/obsolete rel) and what will the UA do with either a too-modern solution or a too-old solution: maybe nothing. 
Since it's in the HTML spec, we could push on author and authoring tools for adding rel for LINK in the HTML head (like the W3C slidemaker tool does) and on UA for presenting them to user (like lynx does). 
In my view, it is more of a problem to nail what meta information/relationships we want to describe rather than how. 
I agree it's more important. 
I think that concerning navigation *within a page* sticking to structural markup and meaningful text, in particular link descriptions (anchors' content) should do the job. 
where does "structural markup" stop and "metadata" start is the issue: what's data to one application is meta to another. 
If a page is so complicated that it needs meta information about the purpose of links, there is something fundamentally wrong with the page. 
how about the example of attributes added to table to allow for better navigation: this is within a page. 
I think that the main usability problems are in navigating within a website, that is, between pages. 
where does frame navigation or form navigation fit ? 
This may be addressed by using LINK elements that describe relations between the source document and other documents. 
User agents may display/process them in some way. 
(I avoid the important question what are the relationships we want to describe, because I don't know the answer) the HTML4 spec already defines a list of such relationship (http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/types.html#h-6.12) 
Using LINK is not in contradiction of using RDF. 
agreed, to the extent that they can both be used together without breaking anything They are complementing each other. 
also agreed to the extent that one (LINK) is a much simpler way of doing something the other supports (or will) more exhaustively. 
The RDF draft suggests to refer to an external RDF document using LINK rel=meta . 
yeah, but that's really a last resort hack (to paliate poor xml include facilities in html) and shouldn't be used as an argument If a page is so complicated that it needs meta information about the purpose of links, there is something fundamentally wrong with the page. 
I was more thinking of rel in anchors. 
Whenever a table is not displayed in a two dimensional fashion the association of headers and cells is no longer self evident. 
I would consider it "structural markup" rather than "metadata", but I am not sure that the distinction is important. 
When I said structural markup, I meant headings paragraphs and lists, rather then FONT, CENTER, and HR. Navigation via elements is I think quite useful. 
One can do a very good document outline from headings and anchors (even if they have no rel). 
But it's quite difficult to do it with FONT and CENTER. 
I think that the main usability problems are in navigating within a website, that is, between pages. 
Frame navigation is evidently between pages. 
They are just dumpped simultaneously at the poor user's subwindows interface to acheive higher confusion and reduce usability. 
For maximum usability its up to the user decide how many open windows he wants and how to arange them. 
I find Lynx' support for frames more usable than Netscape's for sighted users. 
Here we all agree that the title attribute in FRAME can make life of users of Lynx-like interface easier. 
I recommend to all browser developers to learn from Lynx. 
The user gets maximum information, both the links to the frames, and the noframes section. 
If a browser like Opera would provide links to the frames, when frames are turned off, it would be great. 
The user will be able to open the frames in separate windows and decide himself how to tile them or put above each other or to open two out of seven frames or whether they have scroll bars or not, and in which frame images are turned on.

Also the HTML4.0 spec suggests using the profile attribute of HEAD to refer to an (RDF?) file that defines the meaning of the values of name in META (and rel/rev in LINK?).
