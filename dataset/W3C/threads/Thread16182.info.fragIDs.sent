Can anyone help me with some questions I have about tables? 
I am referring to the information found at the following link: h-table-layout 
The guidelines indicate that a table with proper mark up (that is, has summary, 
caption, header attribute, and id attribute) may do the following: "A speech synthesizer might render this tables as follows: Caption: Cups of coffee consumed by each senator Summary: This table charts the number of cups of coffee consumed by each senator, the type of coffee (decaf or regular), and whether taken with sugar. 
Name: T. Sexton, Cups: 10, Type: Espresso, Sugar: No Name: J. Dinnen, Cups: 5, Type: Decaf, Sugar: Yes" 
However, none of the screen readers that we have encountered reads the sample 
table as such. 
Here at the Iowa Dept. for the Blind we regularly work with the 
following screen readers: JAWS For Windows (JFW), Window-Eyes, Window-Bridge, WinVision, and Hal. 
We also use both Netscape and Internet Explorer. 
JFW with Internet Explorer 4.01 will render this sample table as follows when using the re-formatting command (Insert-F5). 
Cups of coffee consumed by each senator Name: Cups: Type: Sugar: T. Sexton 10 Espresso No J. Dinnen 5 Decaf Yes *Note: I created a table without using the header and id attributes and achieved the same results. 
Does anyone know of a screen reader / browser combo that reads the sample table as indicated in the guidelines? 
Are there additional reasons for using caption, summary, header and id in 
table mark-up other than to ensure tables are appropriately translated into linear 
sequences, which only JFW/IE 4.01 does with limited success? 
Thanks in advance for your response! 
Shan Sasser Iowa Dept. for the Blind www.blind.state.ia.us/assist P.S. The guidelines for table mark-up lists the following as a priority 1. "If a table is used for layout, do not use any structural markup for the purpose of visual formatting. 
Should this be Pri 1? 
For example, in HTML do not use the table header (TH) element to cause the contents of a cell to be displayed centered and in bold. 
Other attributes of a table, such as a caption describing the layout purpose and content of columns is valuable, particularly if some cells become navbars, frames, images, imagemaps, or lists of links." 
Probably not, it's a theoritical example of what a browser, a proxy or a screen reader could to, provided the additional TABLE markup was there. 
There's a chicken&amp;egg issue here. 
If user agents do not support a functionality, is it worth asking author to support it ? 
(if it can't be read, should I write it ?). 
Since the things we're asking for TABLE are part of HMLT4.0, which is a standard the industry has endorsed (but has not yet fully implemented), I think it's fine that we ask people to use it if it's good for accessibility. 
Thank you so much for responding to my inquiry. 
In part, Mr. Dardailler stated: 
In part, Mr. Rasmussen stated: 
I don't expect that any browser/screen reader combination supports the new table markup features of HTML 4. Home Page Reader, PW Webspeak, BrooksTalk, Braillesurf or the W3 browser and Emacspeak may support some of this. 
It's a case where the accessibility standards have moved ahead of their implementation. 
I found your responses helpful, and I always instruct web authors who consult with us to follow these standards. 
Now I'm wondering which of the screen reader vendors are incorporating the recognition of the new HTML 4.0 elements into their functionality? 
In other words, will future versions of JAWS For Windows, Window-Eyes, etc. be able to render a table as desired in the guidelines? 
In previous messages to the list, several authors have mentioned working with web editors to ensure that the editors help the web author create accessible pages. 
Is a similar effort underway to ensure that the assistive technology vendors take full advantage of those pages that have included the accessible mark-up? 
A few months ago, I sent a message to Henter-Joyce asking about JAWS' inability to recognize the id and header attributes in a table. 
Perhaps my question to them was not clear, because their reply did not address it. 
Any information on this topic will be most appreciated.
