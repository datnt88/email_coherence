<s> Can anyone help me with some questions I have about tables?  </s>
<s> I am referring to the information found at the following link: h-table-layout  </s>
<s> The guidelines indicate that a table with proper mark up (that is, has summary,  </s>
<s> caption, header attribute, and id attribute) may do the following: "A speech synthesizer might render this tables as follows: Caption: Cups of coffee consumed by each senator Summary: This table charts the number of cups of coffee consumed by each senator, the type of coffee (decaf or regular), and whether taken with sugar.  </s>
<s> Name: T. Sexton, Cups: 10, Type: Espresso, Sugar: No Name: J. Dinnen, Cups: 5, Type: Decaf, Sugar: Yes"  </s>
<s> However, none of the screen readers that we have encountered reads the sample  </s>
<s> table as such.  </s>
<s> Here at the Iowa Dept. for the Blind we regularly work with the  </s>
<s> following screen readers: JAWS For Windows (JFW), Window-Eyes, Window-Bridge, WinVision, and Hal.  </s>
<s> We also use both Netscape and Internet Explorer.  </s>
<s> JFW with Internet Explorer 4.01 will render this sample table as follows when using the re-formatting command (Insert-F5).  </s>
<s> Cups of coffee consumed by each senator Name: Cups: Type: Sugar: T. Sexton 10 Espresso No J. Dinnen 5 Decaf Yes *Note: I created a table without using the header and id attributes and achieved the same results.  </s>
<s> Does anyone know of a screen reader / browser combo that reads the sample table as indicated in the guidelines?  </s>
<s> Are there additional reasons for using caption, summary, header and id in  </s>
<s> table mark-up other than to ensure tables are appropriately translated into linear  </s>
<s> sequences, which only JFW/IE 4.01 does with limited success?  </s>
<s> Thanks in advance for your response!  </s>
<s> Shan Sasser Iowa Dept. for the Blind www.blind.state.ia.us/assist P.S. The guidelines for table mark-up lists the following as a priority 1. "If a table is used for layout, do not use any structural markup for the purpose of visual formatting.  </s>
<s> Should this be Pri 1?  </s>
<s> For example, in HTML do not use the table header (TH) element to cause the contents of a cell to be displayed centered and in bold.  </s>
<s> Other attributes of a table, such as a caption describing the layout purpose and content of columns is valuable, particularly if some cells become navbars, frames, images, imagemaps, or lists of links."  </s>
<s> Probably not, it's a theoritical example of what a browser, a proxy or a screen reader could to, provided the additional TABLE markup was there.  </s>
<s> There's a chicken&amp;egg issue here.  </s>
<s> If user agents do not support a functionality, is it worth asking author to support it ?  </s>
<s> (if it can't be read, should I write it ?).  </s>
<s> Since the things we're asking for TABLE are part of HMLT4.0, which is a standard the industry has endorsed (but has not yet fully implemented), I think it's fine that we ask people to use it if it's good for accessibility.  </s>
<s> Thank you so much for responding to my inquiry.  </s>
<s> In part, Mr. Dardailler stated:  </s>
<s> In part, Mr. Rasmussen stated:  </s>
<s> I don't expect that any browser/screen reader combination supports the new table markup features of HTML 4. Home Page Reader, PW Webspeak, BrooksTalk, Braillesurf or the W3 browser and Emacspeak may support some of this.  </s>
<s> It's a case where the accessibility standards have moved ahead of their implementation.  </s>
<s> I found your responses helpful, and I always instruct web authors who consult with us to follow these standards.  </s>
<s> Now I'm wondering which of the screen reader vendors are incorporating the recognition of the new HTML 4.0 elements into their functionality?  </s>
<s> In other words, will future versions of JAWS For Windows, Window-Eyes, etc. be able to render a table as desired in the guidelines?  </s>
<s> In previous messages to the list, several authors have mentioned working with web editors to ensure that the editors help the web author create accessible pages.  </s>
<s> Is a similar effort underway to ensure that the assistive technology vendors take full advantage of those pages that have included the accessible mark-up?  </s>
<s> A few months ago, I sent a message to Henter-Joyce asking about JAWS' inability to recognize the id and header attributes in a table.  </s>
<s> Perhaps my question to them was not clear, because their reply did not address it.  </s>
<s> Any information on this topic will be most appreciated.  </s>
