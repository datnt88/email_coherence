On stardate 12 Sep 2000, William Loughborough sent a subspace communication stating: 
I have an action item to do something about how an "evaluator" would rate tools for their handling of matters of text (content). 
First I tried to find something to hang a hat on in ATAG to no avail ("simple" isn't in there and "clear" only as part of "clearly" in the glossary) so just off the top of the head I'd have to say that we haven't given developers any cause to take special pains to "prompt" authors to write clear and simple text. 
Of course it could be argued that we demand that they obey all the WCAG, but that's a little vague. 
That's why I didn't write my original report on text in a question and answer format. 
Other than the recommendation to call style sheets, and allow use of the LANG attribute, there's really nothing else in the WCAG. 
So: should an authoring tool urge authors to write clear, simple prose? 
Who knows, and more importantly: who cares? 
You can urge in one hand and defecate in the other and see which fills fastest. 
A scientist's "clear and simple" is a lay person's "What'd he say?" 
So I would say no. Member: HWG Governing Board &amp; Assistant Secretary 
Regrets for this meeting, I'm afraid. 
We're working on a deadline here, I need every minute. 
I will be at the face-to-face meeting, though. 
Cheers, Marjolein

ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE
