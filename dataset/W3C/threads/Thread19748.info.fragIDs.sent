I set up Amaya as a browser for previewing web pages from HotMetalPro. 
Apparently, though, it doesn't take the filename HMP feeds it. 
Are there particular paramaters I should use? 
What I'm trying to do is set up an icon to preview pages in other browsers. 
HoTMetal has an option to set up external browsers (they automatically find Netscape and MSIE) to view pages you are working on. 
You can add other browsers to also use for previewing pages in progress; you simply tell the programme which executable it should run. 
Of sourse, I haven't seen any option to define paramaters to pass to the programme it is calling, so I don't know just how it is sending them. 
The filename path doesn't have spaces, so I don't expect that is the problem.

Hi James, I suppose you're working on local files and you want to filter HMP files. 
Don't you ? 
There is no parameter to control the initial filter value, but you can 
change 
it in the form and re-use this form many times. 
Regards Irene.

Amaya accepts an URL as a parameter, so I guess you can use Amaya for previewing your pages. 
You can start Amaya on a local file or on a remote file: amaya c:\..... or amaya http://www.w3.org Hope that hepls Irene.
