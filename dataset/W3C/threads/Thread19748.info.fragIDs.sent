<s> I set up Amaya as a browser for previewing web pages from HotMetalPro.  </s>
<s> Apparently, though, it doesn't take the filename HMP feeds it.  </s>
<s> Are there particular paramaters I should use?  </s>
<s> What I'm trying to do is set up an icon to preview pages in other browsers.  </s>
<s> HoTMetal has an option to set up external browsers (they automatically find Netscape and MSIE) to view pages you are working on.  </s>
<s> You can add other browsers to also use for previewing pages in progress; you simply tell the programme which executable it should run.  </s>
<s> Of sourse, I haven't seen any option to define paramaters to pass to the programme it is calling, so I don't know just how it is sending them.  </s>
<s> The filename path doesn't have spaces, so I don't expect that is the problem.  </s>

<s> Amaya accepts an URL as a parameter, so I guess you can use Amaya for previewing your pages.  </s>
<s> You can start Amaya on a local file or on a remote file: amaya c:\..... or amaya http://www.w3.org Hope that hepls Irene.  </s>
