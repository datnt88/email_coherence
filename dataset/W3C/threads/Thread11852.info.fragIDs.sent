<s> Given that we have the precedent of the Web Content Guidelines I propose we continue to use the word content to denote the web page/site/document in its entirety and that we adopt the use of the terms information, structure and presentation to denote the smaller components when speaking abstractly and use markup and rendering when we want to be more technically specific.  </s>

<s> We should also expand our definition of Accessible Authoring Practices.) In checkpoint 3.4 the "accessibility content" we refer to is largely mark-up, but may also be information (text alternative to a navigation bar).  </s>
<s> I propose we define "accessibility content" in the glossary and link from here.  </s>
<s> We also use the term accessibility content in guideline 4.

<s> Along with the necessity for structural information it is a cornerstone of accessible design, allowing information to be presented in a way most appropriate for the needs of the user without constraining the creativity of the author.  </s>
<s> It is interesting that in the second paragraph of this introduction we already use the word information to denote the same thing.  </s>

<s> 4.4 would read: Provide a mechanism to manage alternative information for multimedia objects, that retains and offers for editing pre-written or previously linked alternative information.  </s>
<s> To reiterate we need to make the following revision to the Terms and Definitions 1. Define content and its components 2. Define accessibility content 3. Expand our definition of Accessible Authoring Practices If I have time I will have a go at it and send it to the list.  </s>
