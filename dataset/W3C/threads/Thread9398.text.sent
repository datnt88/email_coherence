Thanks for the info. 
This actually makes the example of the size property even more meaningful, as it shows the ambiguity even more clearly. 
Since there is no single derived type "responsible" for disambiguation, there is no explicit means to decide *which* range should be used to interpret the non-locally typed literal.

(this being legit RDF) ... might the allow us to write: But a property may only have one range. 
Right? 
So this isn't legit RDF. 
Or has that changed? 
It's changed.

RDF Schema does not indicate how one chooses which schema to use. 
I assume its the natural one, at the end of the apppropriate URL. 
Alternatively there should be a mechanis, like xsi:schemaLocation for specifying it. 
As a third possibility the application just knows. 
Any single schema should be clear enough, i.e. it is a bug with the schema if it is not possible to decude which *range* should be used. 
A system for selecting the schema then resolves the "different people say different things" problem. 
Jeremy True, but this seems to be a general problem with any datatyping scheme, even the URV idea. 
If I use a URV with a 'unioned' type name, something has to be able to fit the right part of the datatype mapping with the particular lexical form it finds itself combined with. 
God help us if we allow a union of decimal and octal.
