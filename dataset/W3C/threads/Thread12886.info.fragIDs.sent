Hi all, I will make a try too... Web accessibility means that everyone can use the functions of a web site; 
* regardless of disability and the use of assitive technology; * regardless of the operating system and the user agent (browser, PDA, WAP, TV) that is used. 
Web accessibility includes the content of a web site, the authoring tools of web design and the user agents to explore the web. 
In this definition main stream and special use is included (some people like that a lot). 
I know that some of you do have a problem with the wording *everyone can use...*, but what about the Tim Berners-Lee slogan? 
(see below) 
"The power of the Web is in its universality. 
Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect."

Hi All, 
I like Henk's definition in many ways, but Henk asks about the term 
universal access, and I think Judy raised the point that cognitive disabilities might not allow one to 'think' all content. 
We do not claim 
that everyone 'thinks' alike anymore than we claim everyone can see. 
We don't claim everyone uses content alike. 
This is my version of a definition, Web Accessibility is "all" the diverse methods people use to know content as a single unified technology system of guidelines that keeps open channels of 
communication for everyone to know a web site in their specific way and 
need.

current working draft of WCAG20 says: The overall goal is to create Web content that is perceivable, operable, navigable, and understandable by the broadest possible range of users and compatible with their wide range of assistive technologies, now and in the future. 
note: Some of the definitions we discussed used "Web sites." 
WCAG20 working draft uses "web content." the "bare bones" of some of the suggestions is: An accessible Web can be used by people with disabilities. 
Aspects of web accessibility are: - perceivable - operable - navigable - understandable - robust 
Components of Web accessibility include: - Web content (such as HTML pages) - Web browsers, multimedia players, and other user agents - Web page authoring tools - Core technologies (such as HTML specifications) 
This might be a good visual for a presentation, yet not robust enough for stand-alone information. 
Should be an interesting discussion on the call tomorrow...

i'm still afraid that "the functions of a web site" sounds pretty jargony 
i like this last sentence 
where? i don't see that in this version 
hmmmm. 
that's a quote; more leeway to make an emphatic statement. 
this is a slide presenting web accessibility and wai; more need to be precise. 
we are trying to describe what web accessibility is; i think we need to go beyond a slogan.

depends on the extent of cognitive disabilities; many do allow one to understand web sites. 
the particular concern that i expressed in last week's meeting was when someone suggested that everyone would understand 
the content on a web site in the same way. 
given that people's life 
experiences and interests are different, that is rarely the case, regardless of disability. 
interesting. this seems very focused on the user. 
i wonder whether the responsibilities of the content developers and software developers might not come through. 
but it is good to have the user's experience described as well.

comments below, prefaced w/ JB: - judy 
JB: good list, but tough words to wade through 
JB: good list, add: compatibility with assistive technology(?) 
JB: of the suggestions submitted to the list, i still think that some cross between blossom's and sarah's might provide the best framework, with just a few adjustments, perhaps as per comments made to those emails.

Query: 'regardless of' , we are resolving plenty of problems relating to the issues: disabilities and assistive technologies and the configuration of the OS the UA is running in, Placing them outside the remit of WAI is unhelpful, as in the UK at least dissemination of this information is at best slight. 
WAI could be a more useful place to exchange information on these topics. 
though probably regardless of is a slight exaggeration Jonathan
