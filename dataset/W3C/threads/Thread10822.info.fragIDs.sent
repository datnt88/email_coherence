<s> On the other hand -- there are one or two uses of SHORTTAG that I don't think complicate parsing all that much, and might be retained: - empty end-tags - attribute values without quotes around them  </s>
<s> I feel strongly that both of these should not be included in XML.  </s>
<s> They are not necessary to make XML work.  </s>
<s> Certainly they are convenient when entering XML by hand, but according to our design principles that is not a sufficient justification for including something in XML.  </s>
<s> In my experience what makes SGML hard to implement is not so much particular features but the huge weight of hundreds of little features like these, which are all individually fairly easy to implement, but which collectively make implementing SGML hard and a lot of work.  </s>
<s> I think it's vital that we be absolutely fanatical about excluding SGML  </s>
<s> features from XML unless they are absolutely essential.  </s>
<s> We must avoid  </s>
<s> the danger of looking at each feature individually and saying "I like this feature, it's not difficult to implement, so let's leave it in".  </s>
<s> - the omission of attributes which have default values.  </s>
<s> Without SHORTTAG or OMITTAG turned on, 8879 requires that a value be specified for every attribute which isn't defaulted to #IMPLIED -- I think it would be better to allow omission of attribute value specifications for all attributes not #REQUIRED.  </s>
<s> I think there's an argument that this is an essential feature.  </s>
<s> Some DTDs especially those using architectural forms have a lot of defaulted attributes on almost every element.  </s>
<s> On the other hand it complicates DTD-less processing: for example, it would make it hard for a browser to display a document correctly without the DTD.  </s>

<s> God forbid.  </s>
<s> I've seen far too many HTML pages with things like to be comfortable with this.  </s>
<s> Things like color specifications, style information etc. etc. will only make errors more common.  </s>
<s> I would strongly recommned *requiring* that attribute values be delimted by LIT or LITA.  </s>
<s> - attribute values without quotes around them  </s>
<s> I second that.  </s>
<s> When doing conversions, we end up cleaning up a substantial mess because of minimizations.  </s>
<s> I assume that  </s>
<s> one application of XML will be to have a very consistent  </s>
<s> target set for translating SGML sources into.  </s>
<s> To do this, we often build ad hoc tools and these tools need simpler models.  </s>
<s> So, I prefer not to minimize and to disallow mixed content models.  </s>
<s> Our problems start where we have to allow for loosely formatted documents that a customer insists look on the screen as they did on the page.  </s>
<s> This is where we usually have to allow inclusions for font changes, pushing text around, etc.  </s>
<s> The other consideration is cost of teaching employees how to convert.  </s>

<s> James's design criterion sounds like a good one.  </s>
<s> Empty end-tags and unquoted attribute values do indeed fall into the class of things I had looked at and said "It's not too hard, let's leave it in", but which are also clearly inessential.  </s>
<s> Any doubt I had in my mind went away when I asked myself "Well, if this feature isn't in XML, will you be forced to write a pre-processor for it, to translate your working format into XML?"  </s>
<s> There are certainly things I can imagine writing preprocessors for, such as multiple attlist or element declarations, conditional sections, or other things the TEI DTDs currently do with marked sections and parameter entities.  </s>
<s> And my sense that others besides the TEI need such functionality might be a reason for including that function in XML.  </s>
<s> Or maybe not: maybe some things we need can be embodied in such preprocessors, rather than built into the core of XML.  </s>
<s> But on empty end-tags and unquoted attribute values, I think James has persuaded me.  </s>
<s> They are useful for minimizing keystrokes when using dumb software; they are *not* necessary or even particularly useful in providing better data structures.  </s>

<s> If a feature isn't essential, it shouldn't make the list.  </s>
<s> Just to make it clear to everyone the consequences of what you are saying, you will be forcing me to enter OL compact="compact" rather than OL compact .  </s>

<s> Yes. Since the main application area of XML is expected to be program to program communication, losing OL compact does not seem to me to be a big problem.  </s>
<s> Even if users do want or need to type XML documents in ASCII editors, I think it's better this way.  </s>
<s> The posts on HTML discussion groups in which users try to explain to each other the meaning of constructs like OL compact have convinced me, at least, that requiring all attribute value specifications to take the form attribute-name, value-indicator, quoted-string would result in much less confusion and would be a net gain for everyone concerned.  </s>
<s> No, not really.  </s>
<s> As one who has tried to explain this intricacy many times on comp.infosystems.www.authoring.html,  </s>
<s> I will rather immodestly claim to know the *real* problem.  </s>
<s> Essentially, OL compact="compact" is a kludge.  </s>
<s> SGML lacks the "boolean" datatype.  </s>
<s> A boolean defaulted to false (by absence) is the concept many learners *naturally* associate with this form of minimization.  </s>
<s> I'll also add that no popular HTML browser actually groks the minimization concept: all of them barf on things like P center , i.e. minimization applied to name token groups with more than one member.  </s>
<s> Judging from the source code I've seen (and some that I've written myself) HTML browsers actually treat things like ISMAP etc as boolean attribute names, i.e. a parse like this attlist :  </s>
<s> attlist attr  </s>
<s> attr : NAME  </s>
<s> NAME EQ VALUE  </s>
<s> Allowing boolean attributes "solves" the practical problem, IMHO.  </s>
<s> And anyone who says it will complicate parsing shouldn't write a parser:-) Regards, Arjun  </s>
