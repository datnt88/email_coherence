is the page I'm looking at. 
The stylesheet tries to do a drop initial on the first letter of the first line after each h2 element. 
(There are only two in that page.) has more examples. 
(I'm happy to see the action - previous versions just ignored this style.) dan dlh@dlh.com 
Amaya doesn't support pseudo-classes first-letter and first-line See http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/CSSStatus.html 
Thanks for the link. 
I had not noticed that page. 
It helps to follow your progress. 
I tried to guess the URI of a similar HTML or XHTML status page, but failed. 
About not supporting first-letter and first-line: Those same two pages have many paragraphs with first-line indent styles on them and Amaya 5.1 renders them perfectly! 
(Something that neither Netscape 6 nor Internet Explorer 5.5 does.)
