<s> Hello all guy at W3C translations, I'm an Italian university student and I was involved in the HTML 4 translation in Italian few years ago Now I'm becoming intrested in the SOAP messagging protocol... Does anybody know if there is somebody already going in this transalation or if the SOAP, since is just a TR, doesn't need a transaltion for the moment?  </s>
