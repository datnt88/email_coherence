I stumbled across this functionality. 
You can validate a page on the web using the W3C HTML validator, straight from Opera 5.0 Available at www.opera.com

iCab, available only for Macintosh, also offers this. 
You can validate with 
the W3C validator or via BBEdit (a Macintosh authoring tool that validates). 
For HTML there is also auto-validation built in, via a small smiley/frown icon. 
The browser is available from http://www.icab.de and claims to be the first 
browser that fully supports HTML 4.0. 
It is the only graphics browser I have 
used that shows up accesskeys, abbreviations and acronyms, and a few other features by default. 
It does HTML, Java/Javascript, but doesn't support CSS 
in the current version. 
That is apparently on their to-do list. 
Other tools also have validation - HomeSite, an authoring tool from Allaire, 
Amaya, a browser/authoring tool from W3C, asWedit, an authoring tool from alvasoft (not the same people as alva, who make screenreader and braille technology) are some of them. 
And there are a couple of other validators on 
the web, too.

Actually you can add HTML validation capabilities to your Netscape and IE browsers too. 
See my article on "Extending Your Browser" at: See also http://www.bookmarklets.com/ . 
This has a number of "bookmarklets" which might be useful for accessibility purposes (e.g. removing background images).
