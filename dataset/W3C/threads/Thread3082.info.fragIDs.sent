<s> There is a major difference between the entailment relation a expressed by the = sign in cwm and the diff:replacement, which I think indicates  </s>
<s> a big conceptual difference between these two methods.  </s>
<s> In any theory you can consistently have any number of entailment relations with the same antecedent.  </s>
<s> So The cat is on the mat = the mat is under the cat The cat is on the mat = the cat is happy could be consistently held to be true.  </s>
<s> On the other hand: The cat is on the mat {The cat is on the mat} diff:replace { The cat is on the table } {The cat is on the mat} diff:replace { The cat is on grass } Assuming we have somehow limited ourselves to describing the same point in time, the above cannot be consistently held.  </s>
<s> One has to make a choice, between the diff replacements holds.  </s>
<s> A cat cannot be at two places at once.  </s>
<s> Yet each one of the two statements by itself is a valid application of the diff:replace relation.  </s>
<s> I think part of the reason for this is that implication is a relation within first order logic, whereas diff:replace is a relation between theories.  </s>
<s> Implication preserves truth conditions, whereas diff:replace changes them.  </s>
<s> diff:replace is a mapping between theories.  </s>
<s> It says: the second theory can be reached by changing the first theory in this way.  </s>
<s> As an image I think the following will help (if file attachments are allowed on this list) This represents a file containing two diff:replace statements, concerning the same objects.  </s>
<s> Each diff replacement maps to a different and incompatible theory.  </s>
<s> Before continuing let me check that this mailing list accepts image attachments.  </s>

<s> I think diff:replace moves us into the domain of modal logic, as explained for example by David Lewis in his book Counterfactuals.  </s>
<s> The problem with a replacement of a fact is that you can rarely just replace on fact in a theory.  </s>
<s> Replacing a fact entails all kinds of other changes.  </s>
<s> So consider: If I had not paid my bill I would have been in trouble.  </s>
<s> The actual world here is the one where I do pay my bill.  </s>
<s> We are asked in the actual world to consider what would have happened had I not paid my bill.  </s>
<s> we are doing something like {pay my bill} diff:replace {} But the world where I don't pay my bill, is also a world where I have more money, where I could have spent money that evening, that might have allowed me to meet someone who could have changed my life, etc. etc.  </s>
<s> These are all points made by David Lewis in the introduction to his book.  </s>
<s> A little pause.  </s>

<s> Just before anyone points out that the title may be a little exaggerated, I'll say so myself.  </s>
<s> :-) Hopefully the previous posts help reveal what is behind diff:replace so that one can use it appropriately.  </s>
