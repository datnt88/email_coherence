<s> I meant that it is an issue to have this unnecessary checkpoint in WCAG.  </s>
<s> My point, and I think Nick's, was that it should not be in WCAG, and we should not be trying to find methods to test to add to the WCAG success criteria because it is not a content responsibility.  </s>
<s> Flicker is handled by the display's __mhz and the browser - so there is no requirement on the author.  </s>

<s> Hmmm.  </s>
<s> I'm not sure I agree.  </s>
<s> If I understand correctly, photosensitive epilepsy is triggered by specific frequencies of flicker that can be generated by an animated GIF or a Flash file[0], or possibly even dynamic content altered via a javascript.  </s>
<s> Achieveing a flicker rate of between 5 and 60 Hz (which is what the website suggest as the most dangerous range)  </s>
<s> should be possible even accidentally.  </s>
<s> Making sure your content does not contain any such seems emminently suitable for the WCAG, if perhaps a bit obscure.  </s>
<s> But I may be mistaken?  </s>
<s> Whether it makes sense to attempt to _test_ for this is a different matter.  </s>

<s> Well...  </s>
<s> I'm not usually qualified to hold an opinion on my own health, much less anybody elses; but dude, I seen a guy after a Grand Mal attack and it sure ain't pretty.  </s>
<s> If theres a chance normal web pages could trigger it accidentally, and having a checkpoint for it might reduce the risk, I'd say it made sense to have one.  </s>
<s> To expand on this a bit -- without claiming to understand the subject anywhere near well enough to argue the point -- my understanding is that flickering /might/ trigger an attack, depending on how tired the person is and whether or not they are paying attention.  </s>
<s> The cited web page also mentions holding a hand in front of one eye to lessen the probability.  </s>
<s> This suggests to me that using a normal web browser and paying attention so you can take precautions if there is flickering on the screen would be fine for someone with photosensitive epilepsy.  </s>
<s> Given the other things that might trigger such an attack (light refracted off water, seen through tree leaves, etc.), a person with this form of epilepsy would have to be carefull in any case (allthough you might question of easy it is for 9-15 year olds to be so carefull all the time).  </s>
<s> Getting authors to avoid the dangerous stuff would be intended to further reduce the risk.  </s>
<s> But all that is predicated on my very very limited understanding.  </s>
<s> I assume some authority was consulted when the checkpoint was first put in.  </s>
<s> That might be an adviseable course at this time as well.  </s>

<s> -- Tom Bradford  </s>
<s> Hmmm.  </s>
<s> The conclusion I would draw is that people should use software that protects them, and that this is important.  </s>
<s> However, it should be noted that this is something that can be a problem, and there is value in avoiding flicker if it isn't necessary (often, like red-green combinations, it isn't that it was necessary, and in many cases authors are happy to try and change something that affects people if it is easy enough to do).  </s>
<s> As a web content requirement it should still stand I think, although it might be a different priority level.  </s>
