<s> Ok Nick, you got the plug in.  </s>
<s> very pretty site, is not the font size a weeny bit small?  </s>
<s> when you reset your browser to large fonts you have to scroll up and down as well as side to side.  </s>
<s> But I suppose that is nit picking.  </s>
<s> What happened to the Nav bar in the index page? who washed it?  </s>
<s> It appears to have shrunk.  </s>
<s> From the text version of the index page when you hit a link you revert to the visual version.  </s>
<s> I take it you designed the site?  </s>

<s> Any project of this magnitude that is seriously trying -- well, we are not overrun with that sort of plug and we can stand to have an ongoing supply of fresh examples to look at.  </s>
<s> So let the plugs continue, please.  </s>
<s> When it becomes a burden in our mailboxes we can set up a separate edress for such submissions.  </s>
<s> And cry [halleluja!] all the way to the bank!  </s>

<s> Paul Davis To clear up any confusion, we didn't have anything to do with design at open.gov.uk.  </s>
<s> I merely mentioned it for the interest of the group.  </s>
<s> However, we do *try* to work to WAI and W3C (without claiming to be gods of the universe in this sphere) and are currently actively engaged in raising awareness on the issues here in Scotland.  </s>
<s> In the past few weeks we've made good progress in getting stuff about it  </s>
<s> into the business press here, and have had very positive meetings with government and enterprise agencies (Scottish, not UK) with regard to raising the standard of work done in this country.  </s>
<s> We have high hopes of getting it introduced as a contractual standard for any officially supported work.  </s>
<s> We're also doing a lot of networking with anyone with an interest in progressing this in Scotland especially, from any point of view.  </s>
<s> Anyone with an interest is welcome to contact me directly, but please be aware I'm hideously overstretched so may not be able to respond in detail to everyone.  </s>
<s> Oh, and since I've already been accused of plugging grin I may as well mention we and our growing network of associates do offer seminars, training, audits, etc. on both accessibility and usability... Cheers, Nick \__/ Dr Nick Fiddes nick@clan.com  </s>

<s> Hi  </s>
<s> I think this is a really important point.  </s>
<s> It's not just a matter of educating web designers, getting the clients to ask for sites that comply with standards is crucial.  </s>
<s> I have had mixed results in trying to get clients, in public sector organisations, to ask for W3C standards in their specifications, but being able to point them to this page: and being able to say to them -- "these are the standards the government is aiming at, why should your site be designed to any lower standards?",  </s>
<s> helps.  </s>
<s> However I agree that the use of the Triple-A icon is not appropriate, but it *is* a big step in the right direction :-) Chris Chris Croome chris@webarchitects.co.uk work: http://www.webarchitects.co.uk/ play: http://chris.croome.net/  </s>
