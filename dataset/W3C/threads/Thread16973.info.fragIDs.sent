<s> AT&amp;T is wrong, but there is a relationship.  </s>
<s> Section 508 of the  </s>
<s> Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1998 was an amended section for the Rehabilitation Act, which predates the ADA and targets the government.  </s>
<s> The ADA refers to the Rehabilitation Act, so I've heard some legal experts say that things that the Rehabilitation Act targets are included by reference.  </s>
<s> The ADA and Section 508 have the same body for defining  </s>
<s> what is accessible -- the US Access Board.  </s>
<s> I've also heard some, within the DOJ, opine that the ADA's "effective communications" clearly includes web communications where a company chooses to make the web a primary method of communicating.  </s>
<s> For example,  </s>
<s> some e-commerce sites no longer provide phone numbers or catalogs, and don't have physical store-fronts.  </s>
<s> To comply with the ADA, they need to provide accessible, effective communications.  </s>
<s> The way that is endorsed under US law is to follow Section 508's guidelines.  </s>
<s> I'm not a lawyer, so standard disclaimers apply -- don't take my repetition of legal experts to be a statement of law, but as a starting place if you ever get to the point where you need to talk with one.  </s>
