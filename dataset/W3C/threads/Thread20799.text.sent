Your mistake is in the MIME type. 
As the file you want to embed with the object element is a MathML expression, you must use the corresponding MIME type as defined in the MathML 2.0 recommendation, following RFC 3023: application/mathml+xml You can check section 7.1.3 of the MathML 2.0 Rec. 
at: I suggest you use Hope this help.

hi I'm trying to find a way to have a styled MathML-Object embeded into an HTML (or XHTML) file without completly blocking the IE out of that file, so I tried it with embedding it into an object data="integral.xml" 
type="text/xml" , but this is ignored by Amaya, when loading the file itself it's shown (the file is valid XHTML width MathML in it), also Mozilla does it as expected. 
Serversided Mime-Type is txt/xml too. 
Where's my mistake? 
everything to be found at http://mozilla.linuxfaqs.de 
(should end on a B/W MathML in Amaya/CVS, as there's a nested object ).

Hi Kai, The right solution is to include native MathML constructions into your XHTML documents. 
The latest version of Mozilla (0.9.9) now includes support for displaying Presentation MathML and the Math Working Group has made available the "Universal MathML stylesheet" which makes it possible to author a single form of HTML+MathML that will be viewable in many browsers, including IE5.5, IE6 and Mozilla (see http://www.w3.org/Math/XSL).
