Group Pushes Improved Web Access for Disabled (Newsbytes; 03/25/99) TRENTON, NEW JERSEY, 1999 MAR 25 (Newsbytes) -- By Laura Randall, Newsbytes. 
Web sites should make themselves accessible to visually impaired people before anti-discrimination challenges arise in conjunction with the Americans with 
Disabilities Act, warns a group that promotes access for people with disabilities. 
Trenton, N.J.-based Disabilities Information Resources (DINF) has stepped up its campaign to encourage Web sites to use software designed to translate written content and graphics into speech for people who are blind or have dyslexia or other vision problems. 
"We like to think this is not intentional discrimination, but it would make 
more sense to address this before any problems arise," DINF spokesman Phil Hall told Newsbytes. 
Web sites still appear to be cautious when it comes to implementing the accessibility tools that are available. 
"It s on our radar screen. 
It seems like something we would ethically want to do," Jeff Thomas, director of marketing at iSyndicate, a San Francisco-based 
content syndication service provider, told Newsbytes. 
"The short-term answer is 
we aren t doing anything now. 
The long-term answer is it s definitely something 
we d want to consider." 
The software is designed specifically to interact with the information on the Web pages and translate the information into speech. 
The user may navigate through the structure of a document based on its contents, paragraphs and sentences, rather than having to deal with scrolling and interpreting a structured screen display. 
More information on accessibility can be found on http://www.prodworks.com, 
The cost of pwWebSpeak Plus, a Web browser that translates content into speech, is $150. 
Other sites offering information on improving Web accessibility to the disabled are: the W3C HTML Validation Service at http://validator.w3.org, the Bobby accessibility rating tool at http://www.cast.org/bobby , and the W3C Web Authoring Guidelines for Accessibility at http:/www.w3.org/TR-WD-WA1-PAGEAUTH.

Hmmm. Actually the address given for the WAI guidelines is an incorrect version of an outdated address. 
The correct address is http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT

From that article: 
Jeff Thomas, director of marketing at iSyndicate, admits that accessibility isn't a top priority at the San Francisco-based Internet content service provider right now. 
This is obvious to me from looking at their site. 
;) 
But, he adds: "It's on our radar screen. 
It seems like something we would ethically want to do. 
This is a major problem as I see it -- accessibility is _not_ about ethics, _not_ about being "kind" to the "disabled", _not_ about "doing something out of the goodness of our hearts." 
Accessibility is just plain common sense and good business sense; it's not an optional add-on like some charity contribution, it's a basic part of putting a web page on the Internet! 
Yeah, and we're also considering giving $100 to the orphanage down the street, too. 
Jeez. 
Accessibility is neither a short-term nor a long-term "optional feature". 
It's part of daily life for many people who use the web, and in this case, iSyndicate is sending the message "we don't care if you can get at our content, you don't count if you have a need (ANY NEED) for accessible web design." 
I don't mean to tar and feather poor iSyndicate for one simple quote (which may be out of context) in a news article, but I have seen many people taking the same approach that Jeff does here, and it amazes me how many companies simply Don't Get It. And it frustrates the heck out of me.
