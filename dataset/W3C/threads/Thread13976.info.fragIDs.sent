For those who dont have excell 7 - I have enclosed herein an HTML version of the table. 
It is a somewhat strange table but i dont have any authoring tools here on my laptop at home so this is an excel table pasted into Word and then saved as HTML. 
But you should be able to see it with a browser. 
If not, then there is always the unwrapped text version in the last message. 
Gregg For Wendy and Gregg 
The funny thing about this thread is that I thought for a moment that Gregg was sending examples of bad and good tables and what sort of linearization can be done with them ! 
No, Gregg is sending input for today's meeting. 
Anyway, since I was in this mood, I'll just go over the short exercise of analyzing this table markup. 
Besides the use of FONT and B, and other presentational markup, which are not a blocking factor per se, what we see is something like TD current # TD current rating TD 2.1 TD Required This table is simple enough that the only thing it needs to become accessible is using proper TH (header) markup for the first row: TH current # TH current rating TD 2.1 TD Required without that, the UA can only guest that it's a list of rows rather that a list of columns. 
If you use TH, then you get bold effect for free as well, of course.

Of course, Gregg is not to blame, since it's a generated table, from Excel, where I doubt there is support for stating that a particular row is a header row. 
In any case, the TABLE guideline in this case is pretty simple: use structure: mark header with TH (or THEAD), not B. No need for this kind of simple table to include cross pointer attributes from each cell to each header, with information about which cell are headers, the UA can do that and generate the linear version Gregg produced (how, I wonder, thru some Excell macro?) on the fly. 
Anytime anyone notices that generated HTML from a Microsoft product can be improved should email me the HTML and their comments. 
I've let the Office team know about this issue below.
