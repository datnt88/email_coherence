<s> I have to post a large doc that contains redacted testimony.  </s>
<s> What would be the best way to accomplish this from a compliance standpoint?  </s>
<s> I could use a black pixel that I stretch and have an alt tag for it.  </s>
<s> Or would something else be preferred?  </s>

<s> Dear Michele, You timing on asking this question was very bad luck for you.  </s>

<s> "Redacted" is lawyer-speak for taking a big, black magic marker and crossing out items in a document that the redactor thinks are confidential.  </s>
<s> A typical case is items released by United States government agencies under the Freedom of Information Act, where they cross out every word but "the".  </s>
<s> (In response to Mr. Bailey's separate post, the thread he cited concerned a blacklined document, lawyer-speak for INS and DEL .  </s>

<s> One alternate approach would be to use Cascading Style Sheets.  </s>
<s> The danceable example below seems to work okay on Netscape 4.7 and Internet Explorer 5.01.  </s>
<s> This approach allows the redacted material to scale with the font the browser is using.  </s>
<s> It would not work well where the browser was using a user style sheet which set colors.  </s>
<s> (There might be a JavaScript-based solution to this.)One word of caution: I read someplace that using the same background-color and text color is considered spamming by some search engines.  </s>
<s> I do not know if this applies to CSS.  </s>
<s> I also do not know if you want these pages spidered in any event.  </s>

<s> Hmm. There is a basic problem here - if the content is shipped out as part of the source then it would only take a reasonably bright 9 year old to figure out how to find out what was hidden.  </s>

<s> Dear Charles: recommended (and for precisely the reason you gave).  </s>
<s> I continue to believe that a CSS-solution is superior to Ms. Duell's original graphics-based proposal.  </s>
<s> The size of the black boxes would adjust with the user's font selection, so presumably would be easier to see.  </s>
<s> Would in-line text be easier than, the same as, or harder than an "ALT" for screen-reader users?  </s>
