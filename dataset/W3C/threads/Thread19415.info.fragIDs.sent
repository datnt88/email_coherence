Dear Amaya team, 
I have been trying to use Amaya Alpha 0.8a (Linux ELF) and need some help specifying the colors of a few fields on the screen I have set up my .Xresources so the my xterms appear as gold on blue (this is easier to read) *background: blue4 *foreground: gold2 *cursorColor: gold2 
If I issue the command xrdb -remove '*foreground' Then Amaya is usable, but otherwise it is difficult to read 
I tried specifying the amaya foreground using the following xrdb entries, and most of Amaya is readable except for the following fields on the screen "Location", "Title" and the status bar at the bottom of the window. 
Is there a way to have Amaya to not be influenced by the *foreground? 
I haven't found a way to tell my xterms to use the colors I desire except to be as general as I mentioned above. 
I am looking for a way to specify the Amaya foreground color, can you help? 
amaya*BackgroundColor:grey amaya*DocSelectColor: White amaya*ForegroundColor:Black amaya*background: grey amaya*cursorColor:Black amaya*foreground: Black *DtTerm*foreground:Black *XmCascadeButton*foreground:Black *XmCascadeButtonGadget*foreground:Black *XmDialogShell*foreground:Black *XmMenuShell*foreground:Black *XmText*foreground:Black *XmTextField*foreground:Black 
I guessed at the above strings by running strings on the amaya binary. 
Thanks for your help David Dyck dcd@tc.fluke.com 
it can be XTerm*background or xterm*background, etc. 
I suggest to add these three lines only to /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/app-defaults/XTerm not to the general Xdefault. 
But this is not related to Amaya 
seems normal. 
One could change the default background color of the pages by adding : BODY { background : white } 
on in ${HOME}/.amaya.css . 
But I would rather suggest to correct your Xdefaults.

I wasn't trying to change the background color of the pages, but of the foreground text to the left of the URL and Title boxes, which in english was "Location", and "Title", and also the status bar at the bottom. 
Thanks for the suggestion on how to do this, I had tried to be more specific by using xterm*foreground, but "XTerm" did the trick, and now I don't have to customize any resources to view the text. 
(the "XTerm" prefix was not mentioned in my xterm man page) Suggestion: I also looked for some "app defaults" type file, to see if you documented all the resources. 
You might want to release your software with one?
