<s> Dan and Dom, thanks for this document, it's becoming clearer and it seems to be the right way to go.  </s>
<s> Reading of RDF in XHTML.  </s>
<s> It seems you are struggling with a problem that many people have.  </s>
<s> How to use profile in HTML?  </s>
<s> The HTML 4.01 doesn't define it clearly: """profile = uri [CT] This attribute specifies the location of one or more meta data profiles, separated by white space.  </s>
<s> For future extensions, user agents should consider the value to be a list even though this specification only considers the first URI to be significant.  </s>
<s> Profiles are discussed below in the section on meta data."""  </s>
<s> Caveats: - One and only one white space between URIs? - One or more white spaces between URIs? - The first URI is significant: What if I want to use many profiles from different places.  </s>
<s> Later, in the specification, you have Meta data profiles??  </s>
<s> The profile attribute of the HEAD specifies the location of a meta data profile.  </s>
<s> The value of the profile attribute is a URI.  </s>
<s> User agents may use this URI in two ways: ???  </s>
<s> As a globally unique name.  </s>
<s> User agents may be able to recognize the name (without actually retrieving the profile) and perform some activity based on known conventions for that profile.  </s>
<s> Caveats: - known conventions: There's no known conventions.  </s>
<s> Or at least, there are multiple ways to describe profile because nothing mandatory has been done on the format that should be at the end of this format.  </s>
<s> So browsers are unlikely to implement anything.  </s>
<s> It's a big interoperability problems, which IMHO has killed profile before to be used.  </s>
<s> For instance, search engines could provide an interface for searching through catalogs of HTML documents, where these documents all use the same profile for representing catalog entries.  </s>
<s> Caveats: - only private search engines, where you know exactly the vocabulary.  </s>
<s> ???  </s>
<s> As a link.  </s>
<s> User agents may dereference the URI and perform some activity based on the actual definitions within the profile (e.g., authorize the usage of the profile within the current HTML document).  </s>
<s> This specification does not define formats for profiles.  </s>
<s> Comments: - yes the format is not defined and it's missing a lot.  </s>
<s> Ok, is it all that black.  </s>
<s> There is still room to define a format that is usable by search engine.  </s>
<s> to grab it.  </s>
<s> Though another problem is arising.  </s>
<s> Namespaces.  </s>
<s> You have defined xslt2rdf as the value of the attributes.  </s>
<s> But let's say, someone has also a profile on his site with the value xslt2rdf which is generic enough.  </s>
<s> How do I differentiate?  </s>
<s> head profile="http://www.w3.org/2003/11/rdf-in-xhtml htpp://mylocal.example.org/profile"  </s>
<s> In both profiles I have xslt2rdf.  </s>
<s> It becomes impossible to differentiate which one to use.  </s>
<s> I have thought about it and I was wondering if we could create a kind of namespace.  </s>
<s> If the format of the profile at the end of the URI is a well known format, it means that someone could declare in a specific markup the namespace, why not XHTML for example.  </s>
<s> !DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd" dd a rel="definition" This is the place where cows are living /a /dd so let's say I have a document.  </s>
<s> head profile="http://www.w3.org/2003/11/rdf-in-xhtml htpp://mylocal.example.org/profile"  </s>
<s> and in both profile you have barn defined. the first one as a "w3c" namespace and the second one as "moo" so I can write The value of rel is defined by: !ENTITY % LinkTypes "CDATA" -- space-separated list of link types -- So it seems perfectly legal because CDATA is defined as. ??? CDATA is a sequence of characters from the document character set and may include character entities.  </s>
<s> User agents should interpret attribute values as follows: ??? Replace character entities with characters, ??? Ignore line feeds, ??? Replace each carriage return or tab with a single space.  </s>
<s> Tantek ??elik has tried to put a format for Profiles, XHTML Meta Data Profiles XMDP [1], but not in terms of consensus, he has created it without consultation.  </s>
<s> (with a trademark :/) Though It's a good move toward something that *could be* usable, but is not now, because it has the same issues I talked before.  </s>
<s> These issues have to be solved.  </s>
<s> [1] http://gmpg.org/xmdp/  </s>
<s> Sorry to have been long, but it shows a few issues of the "not defined" profiles.  </s>

<s> Your specific suggestion for namespace-qualifying link relationships doesn't seem to address the issue you raise... if you put the prefix inside the profile description, the prefixes can clash as well as the local names.  </s>
<s> i.e. two parties could choose moo as their namespace prefix.  </s>
<s> The namespace prefixes need to be local to the document that uses them in order to really address this issue.  </s>
<s> But I'm not sure how to do that within the XHTML DTD... Hmm... Dan Connolly, W3C http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/  </s>
<s> And only slightly less nutso, I did a grokXFN... grokXFN.xsl,v  </s>

<s> Dan Connolly, W3C http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/  </s>
<s> My first impression was that the results sure seemed quite lengthy!  </s>
<s> But very interesting nonetheless.  </s>
<s> Others have surmised that it would be quite easy to represent XFN in RDF in addition to XHTML, and you have demonstrated as much!  </s>
<s> Looking forward to seeing it.  </s>
<s> Should be easy enough.  </s>
<s> Simply add the XFN profile to the profile attribute in the head element, and add the appropriate XFN values to the rel attributes of the hyperlinks to Joe Lambda's friends.  </s>
<s> Thanks! IMHO they were merely obvious incremental efforts based on HTML4.01 (with a little inspiration from last year's SXSW conference).  </s>
<s> I took a quick look.  </s>
<s> I think the premise of transforming/translating simple user authored meta data formats to RDF is a very sensible one.  </s>
<s> Simple user authored meta data will tend to grow and spread rapidly on the Web because of its ease of use, and the more meta data formats that it can be automatically transformed/translated to, the better for everyone working on making the Web more semantic.  </s>

<s> I think it would not be difficult.  </s>
<s> (I still have my concerns about XFN ;) ) but yes in RDF would be quite easy.  </s>
<s> XMDP yes, definitely, but would deserve a larger forum.  </s>
<s> XFN, not really.  </s>
<s> I completely agree with that.  </s>
<s> I think one thing that could be very useful is to have the "rel" attribute on any kind of element in XHTML 2.0.  </s>
<s> So you could add a poor semantics but still useful to element, it would help to leverage a bit the semantic Web and profiles would become an ontology for the "poor", but a lot easier.  </s>
