Hello, 
Currently, only two of the AERT Appendicies are referenced in the document: 
how to identify bullets and how to identify horizontal rules. 
The file format suffix appendicies should be replaced with a reference to a 
list of MIMETYPES (I have actually done just that in the draft I am working 
on). 
The others are placeholders to discuss placeholder information (ironic 
grin ). 
This information has been covered in discussion of these items or 
should be, in my opinion. 
Thus, do we need them? 
Perhaps they are to be developed into something more substantial. 
If so, where do we reference them from within AERT?

No. Can we replace them with example placeholder text as we're doing with example messages?

Yes, that would be the best approach. 
Also, I stand corrected. 
Each of these appendicies is linked to at least once. 
Appendix A is actually linked to 3 times. 
Therefore, I think we ought to keep Appendix A, the Appendix on identifying bullets and the Appendix on identifying horizontal rules, but incorporate the rest back in with the techniques that refer to them. 
And, i think we should do that by pointing to examples as Chris suggested.
