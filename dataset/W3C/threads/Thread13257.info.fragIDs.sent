<s> I took an action during today's telecon to summarize our discussion of WCAG 11.4 so that we could continue it on the list.  </s>
<s> The minutes are available at [1].  </s>
<s> WCAG checkpoint 11.4 reads: 11.4 If, after best efforts, you cannot create an accessible page, provide  </s>
<s> a link to an alternative page that uses W3C technologies, is accessible, has equivalent information (or functionality), and is updated as often as the inaccessible (original) page.  </s>
<s> [Priority 1] Techniques for checkpoint 11.4 Note.  </s>
<s> Content developers should only resort to alternative pages when other solutions fail because alternative pages are generally updated less often than "primary" pages.  </s>
<s> An out-of-date page may be as frustrating as one that is inaccessible since, in both cases, the information presented on the original page is unavailable.  </s>
<s> Automatically generating alternative pages may lead to more frequent updates, but content developers must still be careful to ensure that generated pages always make sense, and that users are able to navigate a site by following links on primary pages, alternative pages, or both.  </s>
<s> Before resorting to an alternative page, reconsider the design of the original page; making it accessible is likely to improve it for all users.  </s>
<s> "accessible page" is defined as: Content is accessible when it may be used by someone with a disability.  </s>
<s> There were a number of issues:  </s>
<s> 1. When does a person receive a message about providing an alternative page?  </s>
<s> Is it only after they have not satisfied all P1 checkpoints, or all P1 and P2? OR, do people start out by saying, "I want to reach X level of conformance" and if they do not meet all of the checkpoints associated with that level then they are given the alternative page option as a suggestion?  </s>
<s> 2. What are some automatic checks that we can perform to determine if a page as been identified as an alternative page is up to date?  </s>
<s> if it is truly an equivalent alternative page?  </s>
<s> One suggestion is to check that all of the links on the inaccessible page available on the alternative page.  </s>
<s> Others?  </s>
<s> 3. What action do we take if we identify/verify that an alternative page exists?  </s>
<s> Do we suggest that they eliminate it since we prefer they try to make a single accessible page?  </s>
<s> Do we analyze it to make sure it is equivalent?  </s>
<s> Some feel it is a red flag indicating a "cop-out" in some sense.  </s>
<s> Depending on the situation, an alternative page (or set of alternative pages) is reasonable.  </s>
<s> The unfortunate example is when a  </s>
<s> designer has created a whole site with Flash.  </s>
<s> The only alternative that we are aware of is a set of alternative pages.  </s>
<s> 4. We also discussed using nested OBJECT elements (with text content as the inner-most nest) depending on what type of object was being included.  </s>
<s> thoughts?  </s>

<s> We have been contacted recently by a couple of people on their plans to automatically generate text-only pages as alternative pages.  </s>
<s> This approach seems reasonable assuming their page generator does provide an equivalent, of course.  </s>
<s> It may be a 'cop-out' since they give the impression the text-only pages will be generated whether or not needed.  </s>
<s> The technique is understandable given the usual budget and time pressures.  </s>
<s> It also nullifies the argument about text-only pages staying current.  </s>
<s> One question they had was when one enters a text-only page, should the links continue within the set of text-only pages or keep returning to the graphical pages requiring 'rediscovery' of text-only links.  </s>
<s> They commented that the answer is not obvious since their blind, Jaws using employee prefers the second choice with the text-only page popping-up along with the graphical page so sighted users with them can examine the graphical page at the same time.  </s>
<s> Is this and other arguments compelling enough to continue to discourage auto-generated text-only pages?  </s>

<s> BM:: "Is this and other arguments compelling enough to continue to discourage auto-generated text-only pages?"  </s>
<s> WL: IMHO, yes.  </s>
<s> The generation of text-only pages is non-trivial although a case can be made that a Lynx simulator does just that.  </s>
<s> Separate ain't equal.  </s>
<s> Alhough the notion of a cyber-ghetto may seem an overstatement, it is too much like the wheel-chair user having to use the freight elevator to get to the ballroom where she is to be awarded the "citizen of the year" award.  </s>

<s> There's a technical WCAG issue here regarding alternative pages.  </s>
<s> WCAG states  </s>
<s> Conformance Level "A": all Priority 1 checkpoints are satisfied; Conformance Level "Double-A": all Priority 1 and 2 checkpoints are satisfied; Conformance Level "Triple-A": all Priority 1, 2, and 3 checkpoints are satisfied;  </s>
<s> Now lets say there's a page that flunks Level A, but a correpsonding accessible page, a so-called "text only" page that passes triple A. And lets say it's a case where there was just no other way to do it.  </s>
<s> So 11.4 properly applies.  </s>
<s> If we read the conformance definitition literally the page still flunks  </s>
<s> level A, because not all checkpoints are satisfied.  </s>
<s> This is if you read WCAG very precisely, e.g. like a lawyer, programmer, or systems engineer.  </s>
<s> I believe the spirit of WCAG was to pass the page if there's an  </s>
<s> equivalent.  </s>
<s> So there should be an extra clause like "However, a page links to an accessible page per checkpoint 11.4, the conformance level of the former shall be the conformance level of that alternative page."  </s>
<s> Len P.S. Note that if you object to alternative pages altogether, that's not the issue here.  </s>
<s> That would be an argument for throwing out 11.4.  </s>
<s> I'm just saying that WCAG needs this extra statement to say literally what I believe was intended.  </s>
<s> By the way, personally speaking, I think that WCAG 11.4 P.P.S.  </s>
<s> I'm personally faced with applying ratings to some State pages so this is more than an academic issue to me.  </s>
