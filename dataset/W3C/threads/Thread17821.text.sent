I'd like to include a dependency on the continuing development of the XML family, particularly the XSL presentation part. 
Regrets: I will not be able to attend today. 
I've just finished reading the guidelines and will post comments soon before 11:00 a.m. 
EST. 
Regards/Harvey Harvey, Do you have a specific proposal for this set of Guidelines or is this just a general request for the UAGL WG to track that information?
