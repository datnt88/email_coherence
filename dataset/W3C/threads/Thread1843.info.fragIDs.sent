<s> I have a question regarding the Tamino WebDAV Server's implementation of the PUT method.  </s>
<s> It appears that when PUTing an XML document, Tamino stores it preserving the XML infoset but not the actual byte-for-byte layout of the document, so for example, PUTing: will be retrieved using GET as: I've seen some discussion stating that the server must maintain octet-for-octet fidelity of the entity enclosed in the PUT request.  </s>
<s> Is Tamino's implementation wrong or is my description of PUT too strict?  </s>
<s> Thanks.  </s>
<s> Hi. First of all, this isn't really about WebDAV or DeltaV -- it's a generic HTTP question.  </s>
<s> I'd say that yes, a server may use "lossy" ways to persist entities.  </s>
<s> After all, all HTTP is giving you are methods that get/set certain *representations* of resources.  </s>
<s> Now of course this will fail if your client assumes that it can round-trip octet-by-octet.  </s>
<s> In which case I'd recommend just to use a different server (or backend within that server).  </s>
<s> It's a backend optimized for a specific use case (storing XML infosets).  </s>
<s> If this doesn't fit into your requirements, use something else.  </s>

<s> Hello Jeffrey, Tamino XML Server (as the back end store of Tamino WebDAV Server) "optimizes" the XML representation.  </s>
<s> From an XML perspective both representations are identical.  </s>
<s> From a binary perspective, they are obviously different.  </s>
<s> If you want to get back the original input document (also on a binary level), Tamino WebDAV Server offers some configuration parameters, which will allow doing so.  </s>
<s> Please have a look at the community of Tamino WebDAV Sever for more details (http://developer.softwareag.com/tamino/webdav/default.htm http://developer.softwareag.com/tamino/webdav/default.htm , "http put storage").  </s>

<s> Juergen, Julian, Thanks for your responses.  </s>
<s> I agree that this was perhaps more of an HTTP-specific question, but my sense was that in the DAV world, the document fidelity of PUT would be even more important.  </s>
<s> I actually prefer a looser, context-specific interpretation of the PUT semantics as it allows PUT to be more data-centric as opposed to purely document-centric.  </s>
<s> It's never been clear to me where the strict, byte-for-byte entity preservation interpretation came from.  </s>
<s> It seems folkloric.  </s>
