I have a question regarding the Tamino WebDAV Server's implementation of the PUT method. 
It appears that when PUTing an XML document, Tamino stores it preserving the XML infoset but not the actual byte-for-byte layout of the document, so for example, PUTing: will be retrieved using GET as: I've seen some discussion stating that the server must maintain octet-for-octet fidelity of the entity enclosed in the PUT request. 
Is Tamino's implementation wrong or is my description of PUT too strict? 
Thanks. 
Hi. First of all, this isn't really about WebDAV or DeltaV -- it's a generic HTTP question. 
I'd say that yes, a server may use "lossy" ways to persist entities. 
After all, all HTTP is giving you are methods that get/set certain *representations* of resources. 
Now of course this will fail if your client assumes that it can round-trip octet-by-octet. 
In which case I'd recommend just to use a different server (or backend within that server). 
It's a backend optimized for a specific use case (storing XML infosets). 
If this doesn't fit into your requirements, use something else.

Hello Jeffrey, Tamino XML Server (as the back end store of Tamino WebDAV Server) "optimizes" the XML representation. 
From an XML perspective both representations are identical. 
From a binary perspective, they are obviously different. 
If you want to get back the original input document (also on a binary level), Tamino WebDAV Server offers some configuration parameters, which will allow doing so. 
Please have a look at the community of Tamino WebDAV Sever for more details (http://developer.softwareag.com/tamino/webdav/default.htm http://developer.softwareag.com/tamino/webdav/default.htm , "http put storage").

Juergen, Julian, Thanks for your responses. 
I agree that this was perhaps more of an HTTP-specific question, but my sense was that in the DAV world, the document fidelity of PUT would be even more important. 
I actually prefer a looser, context-specific interpretation of the PUT semantics as it allows PUT to be more data-centric as opposed to purely document-centric. 
It's never been clear to me where the strict, byte-for-byte entity preservation interpretation came from. 
It seems folkloric.
