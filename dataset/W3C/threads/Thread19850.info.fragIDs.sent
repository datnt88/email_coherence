I'm attempting to compile amaya on a machine running NetBSD 1.3. 
Configure complains that it can't find Thot sources although they appear to be present (I downloaded the file amaya-src-1.2.tar.gz, and the associated web page claims that the Thot source tree is included. 
After the configuration step, the Makefiles are all empty. 
Any suggestions?

Hello Justin, 
I get the same error on a compile attempt for AIX. 
Something must be broken in the make file.

To err is human...to really foul up requires the root password. 
There is known problem with the configure script execution on some BSD setup, this has been discussed before on this list. 
The problem is probably related to sed(1), as explained previously: Try to get GNU sed, remove the config.cache and rerun configure it may solve the problem !
