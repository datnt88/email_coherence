In section 4.2 "Message Headers", the statement "It MUST be possible to combine the multiple header fields into one "field-name: field-value" pair, without changing the semantics of the message, by appending each subsequent field-value to the first, each separated by a comma." is a restatement of the preceding requirement, "Multiple message-header fields with the same field-name MAY be present in a message if and only if the entire field-value for that header field is defined as a comma-separated list [i.e., #(values)]." 
placing a requirement upon future extensions to the protocol rather than on implementations of HTTP 1.1. 
I think the "MUST" should be changed to a "must". 
Ross Patterson VM Software Division Sterling Software, Inc. No, in fact, it is a requirement placed on future versions of the HTTP/1.X family of protocols. 
The issue is that there are deployed proxies that do exactly this kind of header transformation, and the requirement is to prevent breaking them. 
We might wish this isn't so, but it is, and for this generation of protocol, we're stuck with it. 
- Jim Seen in that light you're obviously correct. 
Thanks, Ross
