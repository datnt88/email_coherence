Hi All, I followed the procedure described in the file http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/Win-Compiling.html to compile the Amaya source code in Visual C++ 6.0 on Windows NT platform. 
I could find the directories and files mentioned in the file upon unzipping the .tar 
file. 
After loading the Compilers.mak, 
I gave Build option. 
The following is the error that I encountered Compiling resources... D:\Amaya\batch\Compilers.rc (67): error RC2104 : undefined keyword or key name: COMP_OPEN I could not find the identifier COMP_OPEN defined anywhere in the source files. 
Further, upon clicking the Resources tab in the Visual C++ environment, a message 'Load Failed' is appearing. 
Could anybody help telling me how do I get over this problem. 
An early response would be appreciated.

resource.h is missing from the source tar file. 
It is attached toi this e-mail and you have to save it in: Amaya/batch directory.
