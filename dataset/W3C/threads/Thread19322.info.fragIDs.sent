<s> Hi All, I followed the procedure described in the file http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/Win-Compiling.html to compile the Amaya source code in Visual C++ 6.0 on Windows NT platform.  </s>
<s> I could find the directories and files mentioned in the file upon unzipping the .tar  </s>
<s> file.  </s>
<s> After loading the Compilers.mak,  </s>
<s> I gave Build option.  </s>
<s> The following is the error that I encountered Compiling resources... D:\Amaya\batch\Compilers.rc (67): error RC2104 : undefined keyword or key name: COMP_OPEN I could not find the identifier COMP_OPEN defined anywhere in the source files.  </s>
<s> Further, upon clicking the Resources tab in the Visual C++ environment, a message 'Load Failed' is appearing.  </s>
<s> Could anybody help telling me how do I get over this problem.  </s>
