<s> Outline of proposed solution: the URI '*' refers to the server, independent of any specific URI.  </s>
<s> The Host: header may be used to specify a named proxy or origin server in a chained environment The Max-forwards: header may be used to specify a maximum number of hops the request may be forwarded in a chained environment The Compliance: header may be used on requests to ask about compliance, and on responses to assert compliance.  </s>
<s> The Non-Compliance header allows proxies to indicate when they fail to comply with something that the origin server complies with.  </s>
<s> We define a new IANA-registered namespace for compliance assertions.  </s>
<s> Proposed Solution: (1) In section 5.1.2, remove this: If a proxy receives a request without any path in the Request-URI and the method specified is capable of supporting the asterisk form of request, then the last proxy on the request chain MUST forward the request with "*" as the final Request-URI.  </s>
<s> For example, the request OPTIONS a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu:8001" http://www.ics.uci.edu:8001 /a HTTP/1.1 would be forwarded by the proxy as OPTIONS * HTTP/1.1 Host: www.ics.uci.edu:8001 after connecting to port 8001 of host "www.ics.uci.edu".  </s>
<s> (2) In section 9.2 (OPTIONS), replace: Unless the server's response is an error, the response MUST NOT include entity information other than what can be considered as communication options (e.g., Allow is appropriate, but Content-Type is not).  </s>
<s> Responses to this method are not cachable.  </s>
<s> with An OPTIONS request MAY include Compliance headers (see section 14.ZZZ) that indicate the set of options the sender wants information about.  </s>
<s> Responses to OPTIONS are not cachable, unless caching is explicitly allowed by the originating sender (see section 13.4).  </s>
<s> (3) In section 9.2 (OPTIONS), replace: If the Request-URI is an asterisk ("*"), the OPTIONS request is intended to apply to the server as a whole.  </s>

<s> If the specified host has more than one `virtual server', the OPTIONS request applies to the specified virtual server.  </s>
<s> Note: An OPTIONS request may also include a Max-Forwards header, as described in section 14.31.  </s>

<s> A 200 response SHOULD include an Allow header field (see section 14.7).  </s>

<s> If the subset is empty, the response SHOULD include a Compliance header with an empty field-value.  </s>
<s> The response SHOULD include any other applicable general or response-header fields.  </s>
<s> Note: if an OPTION request contains a Compliance header, and the response does not, the response may have been generated by RFC2068-compliant implementation, which would not support Compliance.  </s>
<s> In this case, it is not possible to infer that the sender fails to support all of the options listed in the Compliance header of the request.  </s>
<s> If the OPTIONS request passes through a proxy, the proxy SHOULD add a Non-Compliance header field (see section 14.QQQ) to the response, to list those options that apply to a proxy's capabilities and that are known to be unavailable through that proxy.  </s>

<s> JM (8) [For the moment, two possible alternatives here!]  </s>
<s> I'm afraid that I can't decipher whether it is (8a) or (8b) that I like or whether I don't like either one.  </s>
<s> Simply stated, I would prefer that proxies never modify either Public or Allow headers; they should always be end-to-end headers.  </s>
<s> I choose this alternative because I think it is easier for a client to discover what is going on this way.  </s>
<s> If proxies DO modify the Public and Allow headers, an end-client can't tell whether it is the origin server or the proxy that doesn't support what it wants because it sees the same response from both.  </s>
<s> While it is true that the client may have another way to reach the origin server, if that is not the case there will be no way for the user to determine that the proxy is the problem.  </s>
<s> Since many users are behind proxies they cannot get around, there would be no way for them to discover that the reason they can't use some service is that the proxy is missing something.  </s>
<s> If proxies DO NOT modify Public and Allow headers, the methods supported by the origin server can be discovered by sending an OPTIONS request, and the methods supported by each proxy can be discovered by sending an OPTIONS request with a Max-Forwards header.  </s>
<s> This would be a slight change to RFC 2068 definition for the treatment of these headers by proxies, but as far as I can tell there are no deployed 2068 proxies out there yet, so I don't think that is a practical concern.  </s>
<s> Even if there were, a client could detect that a proxy was 2068-only by sending OPTIONS with a Compliance header to the proxy and get back an OPTIONS response without a Compliance header.  </s>

<s> Good point.  </s>
<s> I think interpretation #2 makes more sense, since the proxy could have sent Non-Compliance: MyNameSpace=MyThing@Somebody.Else.Proxy if it meant #1.  </s>
<s> So I'm adding this to the definition of Non-Compliance: If the compliance-option in a non-compliance-option includes one or more option-param(s) (see section 14.ZZZ), then the proxy server's non-compliance is limited to the scope of the option-param(s).  </s>
<s> If the compliance-option does not include an option-param, then the proxy server is asserting non-compliance with the option in general.  </s>
<s> For example, a response with: Compliance: rfc=9999;uncond Non-Compliance: rfc=9999;uncond@proxy.foo.net states that proxy.foo.net is not unconditionally compliant with RFC9999, but does not imply that proxy.foo.net is not conditionally compliant with RFC9999.  </s>
<s> If the proxy is not even conditionally compliant with RFC9999, it should instead send Compliance: rfc=9999;uncond Non-Compliance: rfc=9999@proxy.foo.net when forwarding the response.  </s>
<s> Thanks -Jeff  </s>
<s> Cool, although I was kinda hoping for a "Whoa!  </s>
<s> We didn't mean for parameters to be supported on Non-Compliance!"  </s>
<s> I guess this means that a client needs to sort out all the Non-Compliance headers it receives from proxies in a response and determine for itself how parameters interact.  </s>
<s> COND and UNCOND will probably be OK, but I wonder about other parameters, especially the ever-present "token" parameter.  </s>
<s> I guess I weigh in as thinking that parameters should not be permitted in Non-Compliance headers.  </s>
