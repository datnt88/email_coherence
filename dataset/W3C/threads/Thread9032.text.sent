All - In Reference to 4.4.4 "The X509IssuerSerial element, which contains an X.509 issuer distinguished name/serial number pair that SHOULD be compliant with RFC2253 [LDAP-DN], " RFC2253 doesn't tell us how to make a string representation of a serial number (only attribute types and values). 
Does the working group put constraints on the format of the actual serial number (e.g. HEX or Decimal?) or is this considered out of scope? 
Thanks, Blake Dournaee Toolkit Applications Engineer RSA Security "The only thing I know is that I know nothing" - Socrates Blake, The sentence you cite is misleading (Joseph: should this be added to the errata document?); it should rather say "The X509IssuerSerial element, which consists of an X.509 issuer distinguished name (SHOULD be compliant with RFC2253 [LDAP-DN]), and a serial number." 
In the schema, you can see that the serial number has to be of type xsi:integer. 
Regards, Gregor I tweaked the errata to make it clear that its the DNAME that is serialized according to our DNAME rules: E01 1.Section 4.4.4 
The X509Data Element: The first two bullets of list item "1" should read, "the encoding of the distinguished name SHOULD be compliant with the DNAME encoding rules at the end of this section."
