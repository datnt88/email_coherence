<s> Greetings EOWG, I'm working on a collection of alternative browsers and screen-readers for one of the EO deliverables.  </s>
<s> this is for reference and to help check pages with different browsers and combinations of browsers and screen-readers.  </s>
<s> this may be discussed during Friday's meeting, and I'd welcome any suggestions for improvements or additions.  </s>
<s> In particular, there could be a third section for "mainstream alternative browsers" such as LYNX, Opera, net-tamer ..., would this be helpful?  </s>
<s> And can you let me have references for any others, Arach.... and others I can't call to mind. the first draft is at http://www.soundlinks.com/absr.htm.  </s>

<s> Peter,  </s>
<s> This is a great start!! Thanks for getting this resource going.  </s>
<s> A few thoughts: Please, particularly since the page is using the W3C &amp; WAI logos, clearly mark at the top that this is a draft resource page for Education &amp; Outreach Working Group review.  </s>
<s> Also please add a sentence "This does not represent W3C or WAI endorsement of these products"  </s>
<s> Browsers: - Add a pointer to Avanti which has some cross-disability access features -- Daniel do you have a link for that?  </s>
<s> - and to Kurzweil which I believe has a browser add-on for learning disabilities.  </s>
<s> - add Lynx - isn't there also an alternative browser by "Bliss..."? - would be helpful to list product name and company name next to each other, since in some cases people are familiar with one but not the other.  </s>
<s> Classification: Categorization is a little confusing.  </s>
<s> We should probably clarify what "alternative browsers" itself means (maybe anything that's not a graphical desktop browser?) In terms of overall "user agent" categories, I think of (for starters): - graphical desktop browsers - text browsers - voice browsers - multimedia players - screen readers - other assistive technologies that work with browsers - though the lines between these get unclear at times, and "voice browsers" in particular is very unclear right now, so I'm not sure this would provide the best organizing structure.  </s>
<s> While this collection may have started as links to screen reader demos only, it may grow to list anything that's an "alternative" to graphical desktop browsers.  </s>
<s> I'm wondering then though whether it makes sense to list those as well, for reference, also since in some cases some access features are being built in.  </s>
<s> Besides, there are not that many to add: IE, Navigator, Opera, Amaya, etc.  </s>
<s> I would not make these the focus of the page -- seems like the focus of the page should be on the alternative access products.  </s>
<s> But let's discuss this more at our meeting tomorrow.  </s>
<s> Screen readers: Do any of the listed screen readers work with Braille output as well?  </s>
<s> I believe several do, but the intro to the listings is misleading then.  </s>
<s> Should be noted; also if there are others that support Braille but not speech those should be listed as well.  </s>
<s> Copyright notice should be 1999.  </s>
<s> Note: I'm still getting some bounce-backs from your e-mail address, can you let me know if you get this message, thanks!  </s>

<s> A couple of new browsers: EIAD, developed by Rob Seiler, is a browser meant for people with learning disabilities in particular.  </s>
<s> http://gippsnet.com.au/eiad/eiad.html  </s>
<s> Tango is used becuase it has good mulitlingual support.  </s>
<s> To clarify: Emacspeak is not a browser, it is a speech output system for Emacs.  </s>
<s> The fact that emacs can incorporate so many functions - a shell, editor, some browsers, mail package, etc, means that it is somewhere between a screenreader and a speech-output enviroment which can include a browser.  </s>

<s> Does anyone know who I should talk to regarding how certain HTML tags and attributes function?  </s>
<s> For instance, Netscape says they've managed to get LONGDESC to function in their latest build of NGLAYOUT.  </s>
<s> However....they don't know how it should be implemented.  </s>
<s> They know it's supposed to be a URI but what happeneds if someone has a graphic that links somewhere else but also has a longdesc attribute?  </s>
<s> They allow the public to contribute to bug reports and I want to make sure all of this gets covered.  </s>
<s> Thanks.  </s>

<s> Jon Gunderson is Chair, and I am cc'ing this message to him jongund@uiuc.edu .  </s>

<s> Thanks...that's what I figured.  </s>
<s> There's the rub.  </s>
<s> It's not Netscape....it's the Mozilla Project.  </s>
<s> They don't have anyone assigned specifically to "accessibility implementations."  </s>
<s> They have several people assigned to HTML, Layout, Forms, and tables.  </s>
<s> I submitted a bug about the TABINDEX attribute for the A element and am about to do the same for the form elements.  </s>
<s> We need more than one person monitoring Mozilla to make sure they're on top of such issues.  </s>
<s> The reason why it is public is so we, as the users who will make use of Netscape 5.0, can make sure it has the features we want.  </s>
<s> The way to make sure the accessibility features get implemented/checked is to do the following: 1) Download one of the latest builds of NGLayout at: They have them for win32 2) Unzip it and run "viewer.exe"  </s>
<s> 3) Direct the "browser" to a Web page with the feature you want to test.  </s>
<s> If it doesn't do what t is supposed to, submit it as a bug in the below sequence.  </s>
<s> Submitting a bug in NGLayout 1) Go to the Mozilla Project's NGLayout bug query page at 2) Using the Ctrl key on your keyboard, select all options under "status."  </s>
<s> They list many unimplemented HTML as done....because they don't know what they should be doing with it.  </s>
<s> The LONGDESC attribute is an example.  </s>
<s> 3) Scroll down the page to an INPUT box that says "description." Enter in an HTML tag or attribute you want to check for.  </s>
<s> If you insert "longdesc" or "tabindex" in the description box, you'll see some of the current bugs.  </s>
<s> 4) Click on "Submit Query." B.K. DeLong 360 Huntington Ave.  </s>

<s> There is no recommended technique, it's really browser/platorm dependent.  </s>
<s> On Windows/IE, you can hit F14 or something like that, and get a propoerty sheet with a direct link to the longdesc doc.  </s>
<s> On another platform, right button click and a context sensitive menu.  </s>
<s> On another platform, a little D-link might be added inline.  </s>
<s> Well, it would be aprpeciated if someone go to the Mozilla Bug page and explain that they haven't fixed the LONGDESC problem if they don't offer one of the options you mentioned.  </s>

<s> Supporting longdesc really means they need to provide easy end-user access to it.  </s>
<s> View Source, Cut&amp;Paste and Load is not a valid answer.  </s>
