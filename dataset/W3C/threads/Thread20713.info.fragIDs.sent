After a new release of Amaya there are situations that may require a bug-fix release for those who do not have access to CVS and compilers... 
I do not know the priorities of the team but I think some of the situations that should cause a emergency fix-it-up and rerelease are: 1] bugs that crash the system 2] bugs that hang the system 3] bugs that destroy files or authors documents 4] bugs that take a file that validated and makes it into a file that no longer validates!!! Currently there exists a type four problem. 
When comments occur prior to other elements in the head element of a validated file, loading the file into Amaya and saving as foobar creates an invalid file. 
meta and link statements can get moved into the body element. 
My example (rrdiesel.htm) is included as a test document. 
This type of action validates the statement that says Amaya produces valid html.... Can a fix be applied! 
And if so can a new binary release be issued so that the 'produces valid html' is legit!!!

There used to be an automatically created tarball of the CVS stuff that was updated daily or {4 hour}ly. 
This seems to have gone, from what I can see on the Amaya website. 
I haven't got my head around this CVS really yet, so I'd support this being made available again. 
Free compilers are available for most platforms... Hugh 
I tested your file. 
I only had the problem when the elements following the comment were preceded by a line break. 
I don't mean a BR -element, but an actual line break in the textfile. 
When the "jumpy" elements (or rather: the first of them) followed the comment on the same line, they didn't jump. 
Instead Amaya inserted an actual line break. 
Is a comment in HTML invalid if anything else follows it on the same line? 
I don't see anything about that in the specification.
