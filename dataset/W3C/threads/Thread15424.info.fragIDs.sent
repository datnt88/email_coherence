Amazing, really, considering our discussions about different cognitive abilities (why do we call them disabilities, really?), that I could completely read this without idiom blinking an eye /idiom . 
Ah, the human brain.

The rset can be a ttoal mses and you can sitll raed it wouthit porbelm. 
Tihs is bcuseae the huamn mnid deos not raed ervey lteter by istlef, but the wrod as a wlohe. 
Amzanig huh? 
It is interesting. 
Dan brickley wrote a bit of ruby code to do something like this to whatever text you feed it. 
might be interesting to use it in conjunction with UBAccess' tools for presenting text. 
There seem to be different ways of mixing things that cause more or less problems, and they seem to mirror the way that some people perceive plain text anyway. 
(I think that my problems in typing the letters in order are different again...) cheers Chaals

I am dyslexic (although possibly not with an average reading level) and I have no problems with this what so ever. 
I would suggest that it actually fits in with the way that I tend to read anyway. 
Rather than reading large words my brain tends to extrapolate from context, I imagine everyone is perfectly capable of this they just never do until it becomes the most efficient method.

Interesting *how* garbled words are processed. 
If we talk about the "brian" as opposed to the "biran" the word takes more time to process largly because of the possible ambiguity with the intended word "brain". 
We process information rapidly at many levels: o phonemes [sounds] o words [units with meaning] o syntax [structure] o narrative [pragmatics, semantics and psycho-social inputs] Chomsky's universal grammar would have us believe that it is the our innate knoweledge of how language "hangs together" that allows us to process what is "supposed" to be present. 
Coincidentally the eye does some rather similar cunning filling-in-of- the-blanks in the field of visual perception.

Intellectual spam... seems this information is NOT based on a REAL study: Gordon.
