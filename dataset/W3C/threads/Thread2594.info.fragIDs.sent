Hi all, Looking at the definition of Chunked tranfer coding 
in draft-ietf-http-v11-rev-06.txt (section 3.6.1), 
one reads: "The chunk-size field is a string of hex digits indicating the size of the chunk." 
Shouldn't this read "the size of the chunk-data"? 
The chunk itself is defined as chunk = chunk-size [ chunk-extension ] CRLF chunk-data CRLF However, looking at how Web servers (Apache, IIS) implement chunked transfer coding, it realy looks like chunk-size represents the size of the chunk-data itself... Am I missing something? 
Thanks for any clarification,

I think this is a typo, and that we have the opportunity to correct 
it soon. 
If there's no objection, we'll try to make this correction as the RFC Editor processes the document. 
(We're almost next on the RFC editor queue.)

That should be possible. 
Just pass detailed editorial notes to the RFC editor, and I am sure they can handle this -- hopefully.
