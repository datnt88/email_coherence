Hi How the POST request is sent internally? 
Is the body of POST request is sent as (name, value) pair? 
Also can i send a POST request along with some parameters, some thing like below? 
POST /servername/some_virtual_directory/somefile.asp?id=x&amp;name=y 
Some headers... and then body.. thanks, regards, Naresh Agarwal If the body of the POST request is the result of filling out a form, then the contents are name,value pairs as you expect. 
They will be url-encoded just like the GET request would be, but the name,value pairs are in the body, not the end of the url. 
Most CGI programs I have seen parse EITHER the end of the URL (query variables) for the GET method, OR they parse the body text for the POST method. 
BUT NOT BOTH. 
It is possible to send such a request, but I don't know how to get a standard browser to do it. 
If you are writing your own sender, you could build such a request, but most CGI programs will ignore the url query variables.

Other forms languages might use different formats and protocols for transmission of forms data. 
HTML 4.0.1 http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/forms.html#h-17.13 specifies how different attributes of the FORM element (method, enctype) control how the form data is encoded, at least when the 'action' is a HTTP URI. 
There are only 3 cases specified: method get, enctype application/x-www-form-urlencoded method post, enctype application/x-www-form-urlencoded method post, enctype multipart/form-data There is no combination of parameters in HTML 4.0.1 defined that will generate combinations of url encoding and form-data. 
While some forms processors will also accept ';' instead of '&amp;' as a field separator in application/x-www-form-urlencoded, it isn't mandated in HTML 4.0.1. 
Of course, other kinds of forms are possible, and compatible with HTTP, but not necessarily with different HTTP server's predefined modules for handling HTML forms.
