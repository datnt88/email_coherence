<s> If you have the time, please review the attachment and give me feedback on whether you think the font is accessible or any other thoughts... Thank you for your consideration!  </s>
<s> What exactly does "accessible" mean to you in terms of a font?  </s>
<s> Fonts are not, in and of themselves, "accessible" or "inaccessible" to various user populations.  </s>
<s> That's like saying "is this color accessible?"  </s>
<s> Colors are not inherently accessible or inaccessible either.  </s>
<s> When we talk about accessibility we are talking about two things: we are concerned with the _what_ and the _who_.  </s>
<s> _What_ is accessible and to _whom_ is it accessible?  </s>
<s> We are talking about the content and the audience.  </s>
<s> Can your audience access your content?  </s>
<s> A font, in a vacuum, is typically not content.  </s>
<s> Thus I can't answer your question about your font -- it all depends on how you use it, and who you are hoping to have access the content.  </s>
<s> * You might be asking, "If I present this specific content as a jpeg, who will be able to access it?"  </s>
<s> The answer, of course, is that anyone who cannot comprehend text in jpegs will not be able to use the font -- but if you present an textual alternative, you can make the use of that jpeg accessible.  </s>
<s> * You might be asking, "If I use this font on my page, will it be readable by visual users including those with low vision?"  </s>
<s> And that is not an easy question to ask; there are multiple degrees of readability and for any specific font type and font size you can find someone for whom the text will not be readable under certain conditions.  </s>
<s> Readability is not strictly tied to the user's disabilities (except at a few key points), and so it's very hard to generalize whether this is "accessible."  </s>
<s> (A comparison, however, may be useful -- do some user testing?) * You may be asking something entirely different, which I have yet to discern.  </s>
<s> So what would you like to know about your font?  </s>

<s> My apologies for everyone in this group.  </s>
<s> I've already gotten several responses.  </s>
<s> What: After your responses, though, I realized that I may have been submitting this inquiry to the wrong group, because the font itself will not be used for the web.  </s>
<s> Instead, it will be used in offline collateral materials, like a corporate brochure.  </s>
<s> Who: We were primarily concerned with those with learning disabilities, particularly dyslexia.  </s>
<s> If you happen to have dyslexia and I would appreciate your input.  </s>
<s> Otherwise, please forgive me for not putting the listserv into context before I submitted my request.  </s>
<s> Thank you, Tai disabilities  </s>
