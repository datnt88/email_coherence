<s> The thing is I'm not totally clear on exactly how rdfs:isDefinedBy should be used.  </s>
<s> The following excerpt comes from [1] : rdfs:isDefinedBy is an instance of rdf:Property that is used to indicate a resource defining the subject resource.  </s>
<s> This property may be used to indicate an RDF vocabulary in which a resource is described.  </s>
<s> What I want is a property that says 'concept X is a member of concept-scheme  </s>
<s> Y'. So I'm not sure if rdfs:isDefinedBy is appropriate?  </s>
<s> P.s. I slept on it and now I'm tending towards option (3) - create a  </s>
<s> subclass of skos:Concept for each concept scheme (mainly because of consistency with DCQ).  </s>

<s> Hmm. I prefer the idea of being able to say thhat a concept is a member of a thesauraus or (the reason why I prefer this over the subclassing Concept approach) of several thesauri.  </s>
<s> One relevant use case here is the WWAAC thing which I will write about in a minute as a trip report - where a handful of concepts are likely to find their way into a number of different thesauri and it seems more useful not to have lots and lots of "sameindividual things floating around to make the system work.  </s>
