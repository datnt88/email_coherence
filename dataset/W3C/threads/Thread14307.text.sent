Hello all, The W3C Workshop on Web Device Independent Authoring [1] will be held October 3/4 in Bristol, England. 
Who could make a face 2 face working group meeting October 5/6, also in Bristol.

How about a gigantic WAI extravaganza the first week of October since AU, GL, and EO are all looking for F2F opportunities? 
Love. 
ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE I can come.
