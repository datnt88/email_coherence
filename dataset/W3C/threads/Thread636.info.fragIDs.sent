<s> The uppercase value is not valid XHTML.  </s>

<s> tidy does not convert attribute values to lowercase.  </s>
<s> As for the method attribute I am somewhat surprised to see that only a fixed set of values is allowed and is required to be in lowercase since methods are generally written in uppercase, and I recall some older browsers wouldn't even handle method="post" correctly.  </s>

<s> HTTP/1.1 defines method names as case-sensitive (so POST and post are different) and defines all its methods in upper-case only.  </s>
