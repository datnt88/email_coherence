Anyways, the question at hand, why isn't this document validating a Strict? 
Well, the " !--"/"-- " commenting style isn't allowed in XHTML Strict. 
The new syntax is, as I understand it: [CDATA[comment goes in here]] Also, with Strict, deprecated attributes are not allowed (CSS must be used instead). 
On the IMG tag, these include align, border, hspace, and vspace. 
And, of course, your DTD should be set to "strict" as well. 
So, I dunno if that'll solve all your validation problems, but it's a start :).

I'm trying to be a good little netizen and make few pages that conform to "4.01 strict" as determined by the w3 html validator. 
I noticed that in addition to center being deprecated the align="center" is also deprecated from div, and p tags. 
The page layout is something like this (cheesy ascii drawing:) The outer box represents the page dimensions. 
I orginally had a div align="center" around the whole page so that the 400px block would sit centered on the page, with the text wrapped within it, left aligned, and the banner centered. 
How do I accomplish this without using the align attribute? 
The only style setting I can find is "text-align: center" which seems to have no affect. 
so basically its like this right now: Text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text and I want that DIV centered on the page. 
anyone? 
-mark But, anyhow, a CSS resource would be most useful to me at work. 
However, I don't have Usenet access here. 
Deja.com offered free newsgroup access via the Web, or at least they did until they folded two days ago. 
I would imagine, though, that there are other similar services around. 
An Altavista search for "+free +usenet +news +post" turned up 157 hits, for example. 
Going to http://www.deja.com now takes you to http://groups.google.com/ where they have "a beta version that allows high speed, high quality access to newsgroup postings already archived by Google since August 2000."
