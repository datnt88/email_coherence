<s> This is the final version of the deltav draft, which has been submitted to the IESG for approval and "nroff'ification".  </s>
<s> All issues raised during the IESG last call (which ended on September 7) have been addressed.  </s>
<s> The changes from draft 17 to draft 18 are described in the "changes and issues" document http://www.webdav.org/deltav/protocol/changes-and-issues.htm .  </s>
<s> I'd like all of my co-authors to carefully review the text version of draft-18 (I have hand edited this version, to fix all of the various Word-generation anomalies).  </s>
<s> If any other member of the deltav working group has some time to review the text version, that would be greatly appreciated!  </s>
<s> Thanks to everyone in the DeltaV working group for all the hard work over the last three years!  </s>
<s> Now we can all focus on finishing up our implementations (:-).  </s>

<s> Since "nroffification" does not appear to have been started, I decided to submit a new draft (draft 19) which fixes the typos detected in draft 18, by directly patching the ascii form (to avoid mechanical transformation errors).  </s>
<s> Many thanks to John Vasta, Roy Seto, and Peter Raymond for their hard work in finding these typos!  </s>
<s> Unfortunately, I submitted draft 18 before getting Peter's most recent message (adding "V3" to the activity diagram), but I'll make sure to get that changed in the nroffified version.  </s>
<s> There's still time to get typos fixed, so all reviews continue to be greatly appreciated!  </s>
