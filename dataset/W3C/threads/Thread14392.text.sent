A regular working group meeting will be held on Thursday, 13 April, 2000 UTC, on the W3C/MIT Longfellow bridge: +1-617-252-1038 Agenda There is broad agreement that the guidelines and checkpoints need to be expressed in more general terms, to take account of the full diversity and potential of current and forthcoming web-related standards and technologies. 
In last week's teleconference, all members of the group were invited to identify guidelines and checkpoints requiring generalization. 
It is proposed to devote the entire meeting to this task, by working systematically, so far as possible, through the guidelines and proposing changes that would increase the generality of the requirements, whilst enabling concrete implementation in the design of web content. 
In terms of generalization I've always had trouble with the selection of one particular representational mode as a major focus: tables. 
A table is much like any means of presentation of underlying data, i.e. it is largely designed for ease of use by eyeballs. 
There is no singularity separating tables from bar charts, pie graphs, or any X-Y presentation of data that lends itself to that. 
In short the important consideration is that the content (raw data points) is separable from its presentation. 
I believe that the guidelines at their highest level of abstraction should deal with that and not with tables used as format vs. tables used as "tables". 
The latter are just a means of presenting underlying data to people of the retinal persuasion. 
Deal with all such issues in some technique/example space but the focus needs to be on maintaining access to the content, never mind what the author thinks is best for the reader. 
Love. 
ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE Although Guuideline 5 is the only one that actaully directly references a 'technique' - table use is the point that I generally have most problem explaining to designers. 
Perhaps this needs to be clarified in Guideline 3 -(proper use of Markup) and 5 should deal with data presentation methods. 
Regrets for todays meeting. 
Marti Some additional thoughts: There are several checkpoints that could be expressed collectively as mark up semantics according the specification. 
For example, HTML provides markup for various kind of semantic differences. 
Tables are one class of this (as well as being one possible presentation of 2-dimensional data).
