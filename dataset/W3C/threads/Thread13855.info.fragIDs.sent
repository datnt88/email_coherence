<s> A.1 technique 7 - for OBJECT, use one of the many ways to provide alternative content.  </s>
<s> I think we should be pushing the use of the content of an OBJECT element, as this provides content to any browser.  </s>
<s> In addition, the UA group currently have a guideline which says that the content of an OBJECT must be available to a user (whether or not the OBJECT is rendered) by some means.  </s>
<s> The use of TITLE, etc, as a primiary means of conveying alternatives requires more of the browsers, and makes life more complicated, since the next thing that will be required in UA is an algorithm for determining which things to make available how (there really are only a limited number of simple techniques).  </s>
<s> A.4 techniques 2 and 3 - providing audio description of video.  </s>
<s> I think we need to make a stronger statement here about providing a text equivalent (which should be a P1) and that text equivalent in audio format, (which should be P2) by rearranging the priorities and the order of the techniques.  </s>
<s> A.10 Use accessible user interefaces for objects with their own interface use SMIL for audio/video?  </s>

<s> From the meeting in Peterborough I got the idea that OBJECT is  </s>

<s> In ways so there is no middle ground left, there is no "anybrowser" way to write an OBJECT.  </s>
<s> Al  </s>
<s> to follow up on what Charles McCathieNevile said:  </s>
<s> The anybrowser component of OBJECT should be the fact that either the OBJECT is rendered or the content is presented instead.  </s>
<s> Otherwise the browser violates the basic principle of ignoring markup if it doesn't understand it.  </s>
<s> But there is certainly incosistency in which types of objects are rendered, and it is not clear why.  </s>
<s> It also seems very bug-ridden - testing it is the easiest way I have found of generating an intermittent terminal failure in a browser (MSIE4, NS4).  </s>
<s> I am going to try it out when I re-install Netscape (it died on me).  </s>
<s> I think Chuck Opperman was surprised that I had successfully used OBJECT in IE4 (sometimes).  </s>

<s> TO:asgilman@access.digex.net  </s>
<s> First, old broswers show the content of the OBJECT.  </s>
<s> That's another reason to use the content rather than the title attribute for alternative content.  </s>
<s> The problems start with those broswers that claim to support OBJECT.  </s>
<s> Bugs include: * images are shown when images are turned off.  </s>
<s> (MSIE4.x)  </s>
<s> * movies are loaded when the browser has no appropriete plugin.  </s>
<s> (Communicator) * images are always shown in their intristic size in a "frame" with scroll bars of the specified size.  </s>
<s> (Explorer 4.x) * Links (and image maps) don't work.  </s>
<s> (Explorer 4.x) (Communicator shows content when the object is an image) * Neither the object or its content is rendered when type or height or width are not specified.  </s>
<s> (Explorer and Communicator) * supported MIME types by the browser are not recognized in OBJECT and content is shown instead.  </s>
<s> (Communicator with HTML or plain text) Provisional solutions: * for images and image maps, use IMG * for Java applets use APPLET The following is informative, not normative: * for movies etc. use EMBED /NOEMBED * for HTML documents use: (Note: you cannot interchange nesting of LAYER and IFRAME) Regards, Nir.  </s>
