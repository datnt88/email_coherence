<s> I'm not sure which question you're asking.  </s>
<s> The DOM Level 2 Event distribution architecture supports both event capture and event bubbling.  </s>
<s> You must explicitly register for the events you're interested in; you can't say "capture all events".  </s>
<s> This should be reasonably clear in the current Candidate Recommendation.  </s>
<s> If not, tell us where the confusing points are so we can try to improve them.  </s>

<s> Hi all, I am new to DOM .So please can any one tell "can we capture all events in DOM 1 as in I.E 5.0" i mean netscape 6 supports that.  </s>
