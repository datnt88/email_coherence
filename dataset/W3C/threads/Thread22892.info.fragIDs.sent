I'm not sure which question you're asking. 
The DOM Level 2 Event distribution architecture supports both event capture and event bubbling. 
You must explicitly register for the events you're interested in; you can't say "capture all events". 
This should be reasonably clear in the current Candidate Recommendation. 
If not, tell us where the confusing points are so we can try to improve them.

(Quick clarification: Note that I said DOM Level 2. DOM Level 1 has no concept of events.) Joe Kesselman / IBM Research 
Hi all, I am new to DOM .So please can any one tell "can we capture all events in DOM 1 as in I.E 5.0" i mean netscape 6 supports that.
