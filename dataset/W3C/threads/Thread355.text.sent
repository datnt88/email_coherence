I have just posted a new release which fixes a few bugs and adds a few enhancements. 
There is a long list of further enhancements left to do which I hope to address in the February release. 
Regards, There is a tab problem in the Makefile on line 28 which prevents building with GNU Make and FreeBSD make - at least on my system. 
Also, the date of parser.c is whack: -rw-r--r-- 1 root www 95354 Jan 12 18:32 parser.c 
Date reports: Wed Jan 12 14:31:46 EST 2000 gmake: *** Warning: Clock skew detected. 
Your build may be incomplete. 
Is your clock one minute fast over there?

Regards, Due to an unfortunate slip up, the Makefile in the Jan 12th release had spaces in place of tabs. 
This was fixed in the release on Jan 13th. 
Let me know if you have any further problems.
