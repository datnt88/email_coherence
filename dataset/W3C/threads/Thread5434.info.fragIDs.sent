<s> A method of treating a relatively permeable formation containing heavy hydrocarbons in situ, comprising: providing heat from one or more heat sources to at least one portion of the formation; allowing the heat to transfer from the one or more heat sources to a selected section of the formation; controlling the heat from the one or more heat sources such that an average temperature within at least a majority of the selected section of the formation is less than about 375.degree.  </s>

<s> - PTO TO NO LONGER IGNORE ABSTRACTS FOR CLAIM SCOPE INTERPRETATION A PATNEWS reader sent me the following observation: Greg, It now looks like 37 CFR Section 1.72(b) has been amended to delete the last sentence in the rule ("The abstract will not be used for interpreting the scope of the claims.")  </s>

<s> I didn't catch that one anywhere... Did you?  </s>
<s> I saw it in a presentation by Bob Spar of the USPTO entitled "Image File Wrapper Final Rule".  </s>
<s> I didn't see it anywhere else.  </s>
<s> It was buried on page 18.  </s>
<s> I happen to think this is a big deal.  </s>
<s> Another PATNEWS reader sent me more information: It has been PTO policy up to now to put applicants on notice that the abstract would not be used by them for claim scope interpretation.  </s>
<s> That was actually a very reasonable policy, since the PTO treated an abstract as a very plastic document during patent examination, even going so far as to give examiners authority to amend the abstract in major ways, even without approval by the applicants.  </s>
<s> This was considered permissible in order to make sure that an abstract contained enough information for a later examiner to better retrieve the patent (once issued) during a later examination.  </s>
<s> (Snicker snicker: this was observed in the breach).  </s>
<s> Be that as it may, as long as the abstract was not guaranteed to be the word of the applicants themselves, but rather as interpreted by examiners, then it should not be considered as in claim scope interpretation.  </s>
<s> Now, if the CAFC is going to use abstracts as claim scope interpretation tools, then the PTO can not afford to allow examiners to tinker with abstracts.  </s>
<s> In a prospective sense this is OK. BUT: what should the PTO do in cases where they are using some very old patent, where they want to use that patent as prior art in some rejection, but they KNOW the abstract in that case has been fiddled with??!!! (This could occur if the same examiner who issued that now-prior art patent is examining some later application).  </s>
<s> What if they use some examiner-mangled abstract in a prior art rejection?  </s>
<s> It would be better if the PTO changed their rule in a date sensitive manner.  </s>
<s> To wit, treating the abstract of a patent issued after HILL-ROM in a way different from one issued prior.  </s>
<s> Does this make any sense to practitioners out there?  </s>
<s> - A WORKAROUND OF THE EOLAS PATENT FOR MICROSOFT?  </s>
<s> Hi Greg, As we all have read, Microsoft has indicated that it will probably make some changes to IE in light of the founding of infringement on the Eolas patent.  </s>
<s> It's interesting that despite the high profile status of this case, I haven't found any discussions or speculation on the Web as to what might possibly be the changes to IE that Microsoft is contemplating.  </s>
<s> I did some research of my own, and read the opinions in the Eolas case to guess what Microsoft would do.  </s>
<s> This is my take on the IE change.  </s>
<s> From what I understand from the Markman opinion in this case, Microsoft can make a simple change to IE that would transparent to the end-user, and would be an effective work-around of the claims in the Eolas patent.  </s>
<s> This is the limitation that is the weak point of Eolas and advantageous to Microsoft: "wherein said object has type information associated with it utilized by said browser to identify and locate an executable application" According to the claim-construction of the court the limitation "utilized by said browser" means that the browser is what does the function of identifying and locating the external application.  </s>
<s> All Microsoft needs to do is to remove this function from the browser and rather recreate it as a function in the Windows OS.  </s>
<s> For example when the browser reads the "type information" for Shockwave application it refers the type information to a component in the OS, which further performs the function of identifying and locating the application.  </s>
<s> It's as simple as that IMO.  </s>
<s> This would be transparent to the end-user.  </s>
<s> So nothing to worry about losing embedded apps from browsers.. - QUESTION ON FILEWRAPPER ESTOPPEL Dear Greg, I would like to know if you have come across any US jurisprudence concerning the effects of prosecution history estoppel and contributory infringement and/or induced infringement.  </s>
<s> For example, during prosecution of a patent application, one drops product claims, and a patent is granted for method of using said product.  </s>
<s> The infringement occurs when one uses our formerly claimed product (ie. the claims that were dropped) and naturally use our claimed method.  </s>
<s> Would you happen to have any information that could lead to a better understanding of how the courts view prosecution history estoppel and contributory infringement in this context... post Festo.  </s>
<s> [GREG note: anyone who has an answer, please send it to me and I will forward it.] - JUDGE 'SLAPS HANDS' OF NIRO SCAVONE FOR FILING FRIVOLOUS REQUEST As you recall, Niro Scavone is the law firm whose client sued me for patent infringement, AND LOST, a lawsuit that said a fair number of insulting things about me, that last time I looked, had nothing to do with patent infringement litigation.  </s>
<s> Another Niro Scavone client is suing Microsoft, and recently Niro Scavone lawyers filed such a frivolous motion that the judge not only rejected their motion, but did so really sarcastically.  </s>
<s> Here is the judge's rejection decision.  </s>
<s> IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT OF THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF WISCONSIN Hyperphrase Technologies, Hyperphrase Inc Plaintiffs v. ORDER 02-C-647-C Microsoft Corporation Defendant Pursuant to the modified scheduling order, the parties in this case had until June 25, 2003 to file summary judgment motions.  </s>
<s> Any electronic document may be e-filed until midnight on the due date.  </s>
<s> In a scandalous affront to this court's deadline, Microsoft did not file its summary judgment motion until 12:04:27 a.m. on June 26, 2003, with some supporting documents trickling in as late as 1:11:15 a.m.  </s>
<s> I don't know this personally because I was home sleeping, but that's what the court's computer docketing program says, so I'll accept it as true.  </s>
<s> Microsoft's insouciance so flustered Hyperphrase that nine of its attorneys, namely Mark A. Camelli, Lynn M. Stathas, Andrew W. Erlandson, Raymond P. Niro, Paul K. Vickrey, Raymond P. Niro Jr., Robert Greenspoon, Matthew G. McAndrews, and William W. Flachsbart, promptly filed a motion to strike the summary judgment motion as untimely.  </s>
<s> Counsel used bolded italis to make their point, a clear sign of grievous iniquity by one's foe.  </s>
<s> True, this court did enter an order on June 20, 2003, ordering the parties not to flyspeck each other, but how could such an order apply to a motion filed almost five minutes late?  </s>
<s> Microsoft's temerity was nothing short of a frontal assault on the precept of punctuality so cherished by and vital to this court.  </s>
<s> Wounded though the court may be by Microsoft's four minute and twenty-seven second dereliction of duty, it will transcend the affront and forgive the tardiness.  </s>
<s> Indeed, to demonstrate the even-handedness of its magnanimity, the court will allow Hyperphrase on some future occasion in this case to e-file a motion four minutes and THIRTY seconds late, with supporting documents to follow up to SEVENTY-TWO minutes later.  </s>
<s> Having spent more than that amount of time on Hyperphrase's motion, it is now time to move on to the other Gordian problems confronting this court.  </s>
<s> Plaintiff's motion to strike is denied.  </s>
<s> Entered this 1st day of July 2003, BY THE COURT: Stephen L. Crocker, Magistrate Judge You just have to love this judge.  </s>
<s> Judge Crocker, if you ever make it to San Francisco, beer is on me.  </s>
<s> Microsoft has claimed for years now that the browser is _AN INTEGRAL PART_ of the OS.  </s>
<s> In fact, they have made that a center piece of some of their legal battles to date.  </s>
<s> They would probably get murdered in court if they  </s>
<s> tried to claim at this late date that the browser _wasn't_ part of the OS for the purpose of this patent.  </s>
<s> If they made a legal filing to that end, they would open themselves to a claim a perjury (because they would have legally under oath on the record claimed two positions that are clearly mutually incompatible) and/or to losing some of the other civil litigation in process against them.  </s>
<s> Benjamin Franz Gauss's law is always true, but it is not always useful.  </s>
<s> -- David J. Griffiths, "Introduction to Electrodynamics"  </s>
<s> The browser is part of the OS; but an OS is not a browser.  </s>
<s> That is the only claim they need to make.  </s>
<s> Then all they need to show is that the part of the OS which "locates and identifies an external application" is useful to significant other parts of the OS and not just the browser.  </s>
<s> Jeffrey Altman  </s>
<s> Maybe that's _WHY_ they've been trying to convince everyone IE is part of the OS! The patent refers specifically to "a browser application"...  </s>
<s> I'm not being serious but perhaps this approach could circumvent it.  </s>
<s> Neil.  </s>
<s> I disagree with the logic of the writer.  </s>
<s> The patent really doesn't specify how the browser associates a MIME type with an external application.  </s>
<s> The browser can do itself or it can make an operating system call to do it.  </s>
<s> Both scenarios I believe are covered by claim #1 of the '906 patent.  </s>
