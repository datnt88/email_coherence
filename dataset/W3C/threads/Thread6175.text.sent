There are still issues with the presentation. 
I was not able to incorporate Katia's image because I couldn't separate it. 
Frank Frank, Great start, lots of good stuff... 
I will give you a list of additional issues to include when I'm done with the current editing pass. 
Some comments: -- The SOA definition is not consistent with the definition in the document. 
-- Feature is not really a core concept of the architecture, not in the sense that it is a "thing" within the architecture. 
It's the definition of a term that can be applied to the architecture (and equally to any architecture), perhaps it would be better to pick another example to illustrate the idea, something more core such as a service, or a description -- Add something about constraints? 
There are a few listed in the document, such as conformance to Web archtiecture, use of XML Info Set, use of Schemas, etc. -- Should we rename "stakeholder viewpoints" - "properties"?

Frank Hi, For the list of issues: -- Check definitions (are the right ones in the list) -- Resolve agent/resource/service/element overlaps and relationships (i.e. if an agent is manageable do we really need an element) -- If we have a discovery service, what other services do we have? 
(Security and transactions come to mind.) -- Are resources by definition manageable or do we need separate concepts?

Frank Right, I'll incorporate these. 
And I'll pick another concept than feature.
