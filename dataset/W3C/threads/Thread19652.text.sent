I can finally edit our web space with less hassle; nothing like reliable put! 
o the text on the menus continue to vanish on me with dismaying regularity; it causes me to have to restart amaya as often as everything else put together. 
o If I fetch a document with embedded objects from the jigedit server, I get asked N times for the password, once for each object. 
This is very boring. 
o would be nice if the forms stuff would work well enough to be able to use the jigedit forms. 
o would be nice if the jigedit forms generated correct html (at least according to amaya, they have problems. 
(not your problem, but someone else's). 
o How do I get rid of the following that Amaya added the following unsolicited to head? 
Netscape shows this junk in the screen, rather than ignoring it? 
A:link { color : #0000FF } A:visited { color : #7F007F } o playing with table widths made it possible to deal with amaya and my big table. 
But at one point I got the following cryptic messages: Thot tool kit error: 54 Thot tool kit error: 55 Thot tool kit error: 54 Thot tool kit error: 55 o keyboard accelarators, particularly for making links, would be greatly appreciated. 
o if text is selected when a target is created, that text should be used as a target name, in my opinion; I'll have to edit these by hand. 
o if I edit a target name in the structure view, it loses the insertion point. 
o once, while playing with a target (trying to delete it by deleting the green text), amaya went crazy; the form became wierd, and I had to kill amaya completely. 
o I would have thought that editing the Title in the dialog box up top would edit the document title; it doesn't... 
A quick perusal of the menus didn't seem to show any other way except the structure editor.

This is sort of echo of the link and vlink attributes of the BODY element. 
You can remove these attributes from the BODY element, as they simply specify colors that are very close to the default ones. 
Then, the style element will not be generated by amaya. 
You can also use a CSS enabled browser that will understand the style tag. 
It does, but you have to press Return (or Enter) with the cursor in this dialog box. 
Your other comments need that we fix some bugs.

Other quick answers to your problems with Amaya. 
Are you sure that the problem doesn't come from your X server. 
I cannot imagine that Amaya causes damage to other applications. 
Jose would see that. 
You can add keyboard accelerators by editing the file Thot/config/amaya.keyboard or making a copy of this file in your HOME directory and modifying it. 
The syntax of this file is explained in http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Amaya/User/Co nfigure.html 
For example if you want that "Ctrl l" creates a link you have to add the line: Ctrl Key l: CreateLink() Amaya generates a unique name. 
I'm not sure that the selected text can be choose as a unique name. 
You can change immediately it by calling the entry "name" in menu "attribute". 
Yes, it's a bug. 
I tried it and it works. 
Nevertheless, you can put the selection inside the anchor and use the command "Delete Anchor". 
In this case the anchor is suppressed without deleting the text. 
I cannot do anything with the core dump you sent. 
Amaya crashes in Xt library called by the Motif library. 
Could you give us a scenario to reproduce the crash. 
Irene. 
I was on vacation all last week. 
In meetings this week, so can respond only sporadically. 
The menu text vanising problem only occurs on amaya; it does not affect other applications. 
Seems to happen often on alpha; you've probably got a latent bug somewhere that only shows up there. 
I still say that it would be nice if text were selected and a target defined, that text would be used as the target name at that point. 
When I figure out how to reliably generate core files, I'll let you know; won't be using amaya again until next week at best.

Yes, it's possible. 
Could you give us the scenario that deals with the vanishing problem ? 
What menu is vanishing ? 
All menus ? 
Is the menu unreadable or undisplayed ? 
It's done in the next release 1.1. 
Ok, Irene.
