<s> Folks,  </s>
<s> If a triple-A rating indicates a site is as close as possible to ALL disabled persons, then I seriously question whether this site deserves such  </s>
<s> a high rating.  </s>
<s> The site is almost devoid of graphics other than the logo and the icons promissing accessibility.  </s>
<s> Even the pages which discuss use of color and techniques to use graphics, are without examples (though examples of code abound!) The content should be of interest to anyone who wants to make a web site, but it doesn't begin to be accessible to much of its intended audience without including meaningful graphics, at the minimal, as examples when referring to graphics.  </s>
<s> In Virginia, the largest audience to this site might be 8th graders who are fulfilling a state objective to have each VA student create a web site by the end of 8th grade.  </s>
<s> (8th graders are typically about 13 years old and use textbooks rich with color and graphics.)  </s>
<s> I would not be able to use the site with disabled high school students, or even with my current (pretty sharp) remedial summer school students, because it lacks one of the basic building blocks of communications - the picture.  </s>
<s> On the positive side, the site looked nice on a color monitor with MSIE.  </s>

<s> A triple-AAA rating indicates a site that is close as possible to all three levels of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0; nothing more, nothing less.  </s>
<s> If you feel that it's not properly accessible, then you must work to get the guidelines updated, rather than dealing with individual sites that claim triple-AAA compliance.  </s>

<s> I agree with Kynn.  </s>
<s> Triple-A sites meet the 1.0 guidelines, and these are the sites that we need to use as the bases for determining what improvements need to become part of a subsequent version of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).  </s>
<s> The challenge for subsequent version(s) of the WCAG will be to maintain the accessibility features already embodied while extending to additional disability groups.  </s>
<s> We also need to discuss how the Authoring Tools and User Agent guidelines will become part of the solution.  </s>

<s> Perhaps the central issue raised by this discussion is whether the web site in question has satisfied checkpoint 14.2, which is a priority 3 item requiring text to be supplemented by graphic and/or auditory presentations where these facilitate comprehension.  </s>
<s> How can you ever tell?  </s>
<s> It's very subjective, I think.  </s>
<s> I am beginning to think that no site will ever attain a Triple AAA ratings; you will always be able to find some fault or say that they haven't "done enough."  </s>
<s> Double AA ratings look far enough away already.  </s>
<s> I suspect the best that the HTML Writers Guild's web site will be able to hope for is a Single-A; the AWARE Center might be able to wrangle a Double-AA if I can find the time to sift through the requirements.  </s>

<s> Kynn, The only reason I am subscribed to this list and to the gl list is to work towards getting the guidelines updated to include the greater number of disabled who depend on graphics and multimedia for comprehension of text.  </s>
<s> My thought in pointing out the lack of accessibility that comes with a web site that supposedly "earned" a triple A rating, is to raise consciousness on the fact that even meeting the lowest level of compliance (or the person said they did), doesn't result in an accessible page.  </s>
<s> As Jason pointed out, the site doesn't meet the guidelines set out in 14.2, even tho 14.2 is a low priority, it was completely ignored on this site, to the detriment of those who would want to access the information.  </s>
<s> This page is (as I understand) now displaying a triple-A logo of compliance, yet it isn't compliant.  </s>
<s> And I will re-interate what I've said before, that guidelines that address the NEED to include graphics, including 14.2 and others, should be much higher priority than level 3 because of the vast numbers of people who NEED this compliance to access the content of a page.  </s>
<s> Jonathan has proposed some good specifics on the guidelines that need to be re-written to include cognitively disabled folks.  </s>

<s> Much of the WCAG is subject to interpretation.  </s>
<s> Take 2.2 Ensure that foreground and background color combinations provide sufficient contrast when viewed by someone having color deficits or when viewed on a black and white screen.  </s>
<s> [Priority 2 for images, Priority 3 for text].  </s>
<s> This seems straightforward enough, but when it come right down to it, "sufficient contrast" is subjective!  </s>
<s> Or how about 3.1: When an appropriate markup language exists, use markup rather than images to convey information.  </s>
<s> The example the techniques document uses for this is for mathematical equations.  </s>
<s> I read this to mean that IMG of text should NOT be used (for headings and the like).  </s>
<s> It is left to the content provider to determine what is "appropriate" though.  </s>
<s> If I can't use CSS to make over lapping letters with a 3D effect, and I think that this is important, then I can use "Welcome" as a .GIF  </s>
<s> rather than inside a H1 .  </s>
<s> 14.2 is no less subjective.  </s>
<s> It is up to the author to decide when to "Supplement text with graphic or auditory presentations where they will facilitate comprehension of the page" and this is strictly a judgement and aesthetic call.  </s>
<s> No where in the WCAG does it mandate that sites be attractive and useful and popular.  </s>
<s> Every content provider does their best to make a "good" page.  </s>
<s> You can't regulate what is tasteful design and what is not!  </s>
<s> The WCAG provides a definition of "accessible" -- that's it.  </s>
<s> The ATW site in question has earned its triple A rating!  </s>
<s> You can't arbitrarily change that definition to mean "usable by non-readers" or some other such thing.  </s>
<s> BTW, I screwed up earlier.  </s>
<s> It is checkpoint 3.3 (not 3.6) that says to "Use style sheets to control layout and presentation".  </s>
