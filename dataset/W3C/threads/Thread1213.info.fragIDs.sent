draft-ohta-jcs-jis-x-0213-00.txt is a product of JCS committee of JIS and is intended to be an RFC to give some description and a poiter on the charsets. 
After the assignment of the MIBemum values, I'll reflect it in the ID and contact the RFC editor. 
Summary of comments on the charsets in last December in ietf-charsets@iana.org and my understanding on them are: There is no detailed description in English The current BCP does require published description but does not require it in English Four of them are declared not suitable for use in MIME While it is not unclear when one should say "not suitable for use in MIME", one can automatically make a charset not shuitable for use in MIME by using some characters in the charset name, anyway JIS X 0213 is not yet published It's content was publisedh by WWW and it is now available on papers. 
The charsets does not add significant functionality that is valuable to a large community JIS is Japanese Industrial Standard of Japan national body So, I think there is no problem for the registration. 
If you need a third party opinion on the charsets, I'd like to recommend Prof. Jun Murai jun@wide.ad.jp , an author on RFC1468 for ISO-2022-JP, for the opinion. 
Thanks in advance.

As far as I know, there are no IANA rules that require a charset registration to be accompanied by Unicode/10646 mappings. 
Correct. 
The exact text regarding this says: Charset registrations SHOULD include a specification of mapping from the charset into ISO 10646 if specification of such a mapping is feasible. 
There are no references to Unicode in the registration specification at all, only to ISO 10646. 
This is in accordance with established IETF policy, which says that we cite ISO 10646, not Unicode.

Hello Ned, Can you tell me where that policy is documented? 
And can you tell me what to do if I need to reference information that is only in Unicode, not in ISO 10646? 
Regards, Martin.
