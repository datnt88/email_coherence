Is there a need to introduce a section in the appendix of the guidelines which briefly introduces assistive technology for the benefit of HTML authors who, for the most part, would be unaware of its nature and function in enabling people with certain types of disabilities to access the web? 
Further, such an explanatory section could briefly outline the "universal design" idea and emphasise the broad range of devices which people may choose to use, whether due to a disability or other circumstance, as an interface to the web. 
Gregg wrote an excellent paper on this subject which appears in the electronic proceedings of the WWW6 conference. 
Although I would not consider a detailed discussion of these issues to be appropriate in the guidelines, a few paragraphs of explanation would surely be helpful, especially if it is expected that the page author guidelines will proceed to W3C recommendation status without the central reference document's becoming a W3C recommendation simultaneously with them. 
My specific proposal would be: divide the current appendix into four separate appendices. 
Three of these comprise the present Appendix, with checklist, acknowledgments and references; but a fourth gives a brief introduction to the issues for authors who are unfamiliar with the technology.

GV:: Hmmmm. 
we are trying to keep the guidelines short. 
should this go in the central reference doc or the level 2 doc instead?

JB: I think this is an interesting point. 
Many people who are potentially interested in these guidelines really don't know about the assistive technologies involved, but would like to. 
This goes among the "most frequently asked" questions I get. 
Even two sentences introducing adaptive computing, combined with links to more info, would give people somewhere to start. the guidelines the central reference doc or the level 2 doc instead?

I thought that "a summary of the issues" was the purpose of the level 2 document. 
The fact that it has not been written yet (at least, not specifically for the WAI) is a bit of a problem. 
Should we be asking for a volunteer to get started on that section?

What I am suggesting is: 1. 
A paragraph of two of text introducing assistive technology, in the appendix to the guidelines. 
2. A sentence referring to this information, included in the introduction. 
Given that the appendix already includes (1) checklist, (2) acknowledgments, and (3) references, and that it is not part of the guidelines proper, I do not think that the issue of unduly lengthening the guidelines genuinely arises. 
An author who wishes to do so can retrieve the document via the web, read quickly through the introduction and the guidelines, and then ignore the appendix, without any loss of efficiency. 
I would also reiterate Judy's point that "how does a person with a visual disability use a computer, let alone the web?" must be placed at the top of my list of frequently asked questions, in any discussion of these issues with people who are unacquainted with assistive technology. 
A brief explanation would not only satisfy understandable curiosity, but also provide insight into the rationale for the guidelines. 
The more interested readers can then refer to the level 2 document or the central reference document for a more detailed analysis.
