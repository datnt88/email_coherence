<s> I'm running Solaris 7; the Solaris 2.6 version of Amaya runs, but that's about it: it won't even let me open up a new file!  </s>
<s> Is this right, or have I not configured something properly?  </s>
<s> (My default shell didn't like the path instruction in the README file, nor did a shell I opened using the sh command, so I just found the executable - path: ~/Amaya/solaris2.6/bin/amaya, where ~ = the directory I unpacked it in - and ran it directly.) Help!  </s>

<s> I'm not sure that I understood your problem.  </s>
<s> First, a comment, we (the Amaya team) haven't yet tested Amaya under Solaris 7, so I can't say it it's bin compatible with Solaris 2.6 or if it runs right out of the box.  </s>
<s> Are you able to launch Amaya and see the browser window on your screen, but not able to browse anything?  </s>
<s> Or are you unable to browse local files?  </s>
<s> Or are you unable to create new files?  </s>
<s> You should have a dir ~/.amaya (where ~ == your home dir).  </s>
<s> Could you mail me the file ~/.amaya/thot.rc  </s>
<s> when you answer my message?  </s>

<s> I guess the problem comes from a buggy libXm.so.  </s>
<s> Could you check the location of that library (execute "ldd" on the amaya binary).  </s>
<s> You can try to replace the standard library by that delivered in the tar file by executing "setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH $HOME/Amaya/solaris2.6:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH" before starting amaya  </s>
<s> Hope that helps Irene.  </s>
<s> Merci, but the problem had already been solved and was a user problem, not a program problem.  </s>
