Hi! 
I'm pleased to announce the first DRAFT of our German translation of XML 1.0. 
It is available at At the moment there's no link to this file; if you can read German (Martin?) please take a look at the legal notes at the top of the page. 
If everything is fine I will announce the draft translation in some German language newsgroups for review. 
Bye, Stefan.

Please do so. 
Please note that you don't have to ask permission here to announce it. 
You just have to anounce here that it is finished (or whatever) and went up. 
It's your responsibility to make sure you correspond to the requirements. 
I happen to read German, of course, but I don't think we have somebody here who reads Indonesian, but we have some volunteers for an Indonesian translation of HTML 4.0. 
If we (or anybody else) finds out that somehow, you don't conform, then we will tell you, and you will have to change it as soon as possible. 
A few points nevertheless: The example at http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/translation-example.html manages to have a different background for the additions made due to the translation. 
I would suggest that you do the same. 
In http://www.mintert.com/xml/trans/REC-xml-19980210-de.html#2.12 
p xml:lang="de-DE" Ich hab' dich gern. 
/p p xml:lang="de-CH" Ch'ha di g x n. /p 
(My Japanese setup may have distorted the Umlauts a bit.) This is a very cute example, and as a Swiss I very much appreciate it, but it's probably wrong :-(. 
The problem lies in the question of what de-CH exactly refers to. 
Does it refer to the Swiss variant of standard German, which has differences to the German version of standard German to a similar extent maybe as American and British English are different, or does it refer to the Swiss dialects of German (which are about as different from standard German as Dutch)? 
The example above assumes the later. 
But general use on computers assumes the former. 
"de-CH" is routinely used for Swiss locales on computers, which besides a different keyboard,... may include different spell-checkers that don't use the sharp "s", and allow such differences as "parkieren" instead of "parken". 
Similarly, in an Austrian version ("de-AU"), words such as Ja"nner instead of Januar and Marille instead of Aprikose would be used. 
But not many differences otherwise. 
This distinction is probably much more useful, because there is much more text in the Swiss variant of Standard German than in any of the many Swiss dialects, and because if "de-CH" referred to the Swiss dialects, to which one would it refer, and in what orthography? 
That's not a problem for the Swiss variant of standard German, which is well defined by Duden.

Above, you say "!!!here the W3C Address!!!". 
For the reasons I explained earlier about the impossibility to use anything like "original translation", the W3C currently (and most probably in the future) also doesn't plan to put translations on its web site. 
What we will indeed do, but what will still need a bit more of work in the case of XML, is that we will reference your translation. 
With kind regards, Martin. 
Regards, Martin. 
Hi Martin (et.al.) 
OK. 
p xml:lang="de-DE" Ich hab' dich gern. 
/p p xml:lang="de-CH" Ch'ha di g x n. /p 
My target was to transform the example into an example which is understood by German readers. 
Since there are no subcodes for German dialects registered with IANA, I could only use a language code as the first subcode segment. 
My Swiss German isn't very good ;-) and I just found this example... 
So the following would be a better example? 
(To prevent problems with you're Japanese setup I wrote the sharp s as a character reference &amp;szlig;) This example is a bit closer to the original "color"/"colour" example.

Sorry, I misunderstood this. 
And the translation example mentioned above (http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/translation-example.html) has a similar link: 
This Japanese version translation is: and it can also be found at: 
I will remove the link in our translation. 
Thanks for your feedback, Martin! 
Regards, Stefan.

Hi Stefan, 
p xml:lang="de-DE" Ich hab' dich gern. 
/p p xml:lang="de-CH" Ch'ha di g x n. /p 
Thanks. 
I don't mind too much, but it will be distorted when I send it back to you. 
Anyway, I think the above is a nice example, and it can even be extended a bit: 
I see. 
I will check what exactly we should do. 
Regards, Martin. 
Hello Stefan, 
I have checked with Joseph Reagle in the meantime. 
We don't currently put any translations on our site. 
But we reserve the right to do so, should we decide that we want to do it. 
I also checked an additional point with Joseph: On your translation, you don't mention that, in the same way as the original, can be freely copied given that the copyright notices,... stay intact (see http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/ipr-notice.html#Copyright, point 2). 
As I have just checked, you do not have to disclose this, so your web site is okay. 
But you have to acknowledge that to us, preferably in the form indicated it the FAQ. 
Regards, Martin. 
P.S.: I have also asked Jon Bosak to put a notice about your translation on the XML home page, because there is currently no page for XML translations, but already some links to translations on that page.
