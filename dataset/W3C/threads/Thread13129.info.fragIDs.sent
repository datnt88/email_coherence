The "Web Design that Works for Everyone" conference (http://www.adaptenv.org/webconference/index.php): 1. has a good line up (including our own Judy Brewer, and people from Macromedia &amp; Adobe, WGBH &amp; NCAM, and the design community, including the executive director of the American Institute of Graphic Arts (AIGA)) and 2. is relatively cheap ($300 for 2 days (early registration discount through this coming Monday 30 Sept)). 
However, registration is very low. 
I am interested in the low attendance at such events. 
Certainly some of it is due to the economy - conference attendance is way down for most established conferences. 
However, I think there is something more going on with accessibility. 
I know of a few different workshop that have had to cancel in the last couple months because of low registration. 
Perhaps one factor is that people feel they can get what they need on the Web? 
I'm not sure what all is at issue. 
Interesting to speculate, anyway.

I can vouch for the fact that attendance is lower due to a wealth of information that is already available online, particularly from the WAI group. 
Companies that I deal with now have considerably more internal expertise than say, a year ago. 
2) Travel budgets have been slashed across the board. 
All types of conferences have been affected. 
3) There are few accessibility evangelists, such as Jakob Nielson with usability, that have a "name brand" which draws a crowd. 
I've often heard feedback that a lot of accessibility recommendations still don't have "real world" applications, and that the business cases presented for it have still not been fleshed out enough (except 508, of course). 
4) Conferences are often used for networking, and a lot of times certain ones tend to draw the same people and become redundant. 
Hello Shawn, Locally we just had the Air California rally which had a pretty good size turnout. 
So we have a lot of interest here in San Francisco Bay Area IT central. 
I also think the Air Rally concept that Phil Jenkins of IBM (and WAI) had a hand in starting in Texas gets a lot of attention. 
I think what I get from the Air California competition is the sense that excellence of design is stimulated by the rally which excites people. 
This then means to me that a focus upon Good design that works accessibly is stimulated by an emphasis on good design itself. 
I wonder what you mean by getting what people need on the web. 
When people are face to face they get contact they can't get on the web. 
In gaming rallies people relish coming into some space together to work all weekend on games together. 
They could just be online at home, but they choose to gather locally. 
Where Laurence writes that there is more knowledge about accessibility may be somewhat true, but the issue is still very far from being known in my area (Corporate world San Francisco Bay Area). 
I just spent a lot of time with developers who came in cold with the concept. 
I tend to think the integration of accessibility into design is far from being well understood. 
I've looked at a lot of "accessible sites" and I think the work is massive in sites that are supposed to be accessible. 
I also think that the economy is slowing down significantly. 
I am seeing that a lot in California in the disability community. 
Again the rally which combines non-profits with corporate development teams showed how much the non-profits as a whole are being affected by the State government budgetary cuts.
