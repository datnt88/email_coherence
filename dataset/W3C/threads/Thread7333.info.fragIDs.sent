<s> - Jim A Proposal for Collections of Web Resources and Name Space Operations Draft v0.6, June 6, 1997 1 Observations on the HTTP Object Model As a prerequisite for specification of collections and name space operations for the Web, a model for collection resources and for namespace topology must be given.  </s>
<s> This section describes a new type of Web resource, the collection resource, and provides a model for discussing the relationship between the resources that are generated as the result of a data-producing process, and the source resources that describe the process.  </s>
<s> 1.1 Collection Resources A collection is a Web resource type whose primary state is a set of URIs and associated values that are recorded as properties on the resource.  </s>
<s> The URIs identify the resources that are members of the collection.  </s>
<s> The values associated with each URI include information such as the Last Modified Date, Entity Tag, Creation Date, Content Type, Display Name, and whether the member is a collection.  </s>
<s> A member of a collection is either an internal member resource, which MUST have a URI that is relative to the base URI of the collection, or an external member resource, which has a URI which is not relative to the base URI of the collection.  </s>
<s> External member resources are further subdivided into propagate members, which have recursive method invocations propagated to them, and no-propagate members, which do not.  </s>
<s> A collection resource may be viewed and used as a compound resource in which the collection is a container for a group of related resources that, together, form a larger logical unit.  </s>
<s> For example, a collection of HTML resources where each resource is the chapter of a book can be viewed as a compound resource representing the entire book.  </s>
<s> Some methods, when invoked on a collection, affect the entire collection.  </s>
<s> For example, it is possible to copy an entire collection and its contents with just a single copy method request.  </s>
<s> The model for performing these operations is a tree traversal.  </s>
<s> The method is invoked on the collection, which then performs the method on itself before propagating the method to all its internal members and propagate external members.  </s>
<s> If these are non-collection resources, the request method is processed.  </s>
<s> However, if the request is propagated to another collection, then the propagation begins again.  </s>
<s> This sequence of actions causes the method to be propagated as a tree traversal of the members of the collections.  </s>
<s> 1.2 Creation and Retrieval of Collection Resources Since the existing HTTP methods for creating (PUT, POST) and retrieving (GET) a resource were defined for non-collection resources, it is not surprising that the semantics of these methods do not transfer well to collections.  </s>
<s> For example, the PUT method is defined to store the request entity under the Request-URI.  </s>
<s> While a description format for a collection can readily be constructed that could be used with PUT, the implications of sending such a description to the server are undesirable.  </s>
<s> For example, if a description of a collection was PUT to the server which omitted some existing resources, this might be interpreted as a command to remove those members.  </s>
<s> However, this would extend PUT to perform DELETE functionality, which is undesirable since it changes the semantics of PUT, and makes it difficult to control DELETE functionality with an access control scheme based on methods.  </s>
<s> While the POST method is sufficiently open-ended that a "create a collection" POST command could be constructed, this is undesirable because it would be difficult to provide separate access control for collection creation and other uses of POST if they both use the same method.  </s>
<s> The GET method when applied to collections is also problematic.  </s>
<s> While it might seem desirable to have GET return a listing of the members of a collection, this is foiled by the existence of the "index.html"  </s>
<s> de-facto standard namespace redirection, in which a GET request on a collection is automatically redirected to the index.html  </s>
<s> resource.  </s>
<s> Because of the difficulty of reusing existing HTTP/1.1 methods for collections, two new resource creation/retrieval methods are needed.  </s>
<s> This proposal introduces the MKCOL method for creating collection resources, and the INDEX method for retrieving the contents of a collection.  </s>
<s> The exact definition of the behavior of GET and PUT on collections is defined later in this draft.  </s>
<s> 1.3 Source Resources and Output Resources For many resources, the entity returned by GET exactly matches the persistent state of the resource, for example, a GIF file stored on a disk.  </s>
<s> For this simple case, the URL at which a resource is accessed is identical to the URL at which the source (the persistent state) of the resource is accessed.  </s>
<s> This is also the case for HTML source files that are not processed by the server prior to transmission.  </s>
<s> However, HTML files can sometimes be processed by the server before being transmitted as a return entity body.  </s>
<s> Server-side-include directives within an HTML file instruct a server to replace the directive with another value, such as the current date.  </s>
<s> In this case, what is returned by GET (HTML plus date) differs from the persistent state of the resource (HTML plus directive).  </s>
<s> Typically there is no way to access the HTML file containing the unprocessed directive.  </s>
<s> Sometimes the entity returned by GET is the output of a data-producing process that is described by one or more source resources (that may not even have a location in the URL namespace).  </s>
<s> A single data-producing process may dynamically generate the state of a potentially large number of output resources.  </s>
<s> An example of this is a CGI script that describes a "finger" gateway process that maps part of the namespace of a server into finger requests, such as http://www.foo.bar.org/finger_gateway/user@host.  </s>
<s> In the absence of distributed authoring capability, the fact that the source resource(s) for server generated output do not have a mapping to the URI namespace is not a problem, and has desirable security benefits.  </s>
<s> However, if remote editing of the source resource(s) is desired, they should be given a location in the URI namespace.  </s>
<s> This source location should not be one of the locations at which the generated output is retrievable, since in general it is impossible for the server to differentiate requests for source resources from requests for process output resources.  </s>
<s> There is often a many-to-many relationship between source resources and output resources.  </s>
<s> Within the HTTP URL namespace managed by servers which implement the DAV property functionality, all resources which have a single source resource, and that source resource has a URI, the URI of the source resource SHOULD be stored in a single link with type Source.  </s>
<s> Note that by storing the source URI in links on the output resources, the burden of discovering the source is placed on the authoring client.  </s>
<s> In the general case, a large number of source resources can comprise a data-producing process that generates many output resources, creating a many-to-many relationship between output resources and source resources.  </s>
<s> If each output resource had links back to every source resource in the data-producing process, there can be a potentially large number of such links.  </s>
<s> Due to the potentially large number of links, and the lack of a policy for ordering access to multiple sources, explicit storage of source relationships is limited to cases with only a single source resource.  </s>
<s> 2 Terms Collection - A resource that contains member resources.  </s>
<s> Member Resource - a resource referred to by a collection.  </s>
<s> There are two types of member resources: external and internal.  </s>
<s> Internal Member Resource - the name given to a member resource of a collection whose URI is relative to the URI of the collection.  </s>
<s> External Member Resource - a member resource with an absolute URI that is not relative to its parent's URI.  </s>
<s> Properties - Also known as small-chunk metadata, a hierarchical set of name/value pairs that describe a resource.  </s>
<s> Live Properties - Properties whose semantics and syntax are enforced by the server.  </s>
<s> For example, a live "read-only" property that is enforced by the server would disallow PUTs to the associated resource.  </s>
<s> Dead properties - Properties whose semantics and syntax are not enforced by the server.  </s>
<s> A dead "read-only" property would not be enforced by the server and thus would not be used by the server as a reason to disallow a PUT on the associated resource.  </s>
<s> 3 Collection Requirements The requirements for collections are given below, reprinted from [DAVREQ]: 3.1.  </s>
<s> List Collection.  </s>
<s> A listing of all resources in a specific collection must be accessible.  </s>
<s> 3.2.  </s>
<s> Make Collection.  </s>
<s> It must be possible to create a new collection.  </s>
<s> 3.3.  </s>
<s> Add to Collection.  </s>
<s> It must be possible to add a resource to a collection directly or by reference.  </s>
<s> 3.4.  </s>
<s> Remove from Collection.  </s>
<s> It must be possible to remove a resource from a collection.  </s>
<s> 4 MKCOL Method 4.1 Problem Description The client needs a way to create a collection.  </s>
<s> 4.2 Solution Requirements The solution: * Must ensure that a collection has been made (i.e. that it responds to the INDEX method) as opposed to a non-collection resource.  </s>
<s> If a collection could not be made, it must indicate a failure to the principal.  </s>
<s> * The server MAY, if necessary, create any intermediate collections so that the underlying storage medium is consistent.  </s>
<s> 4.3 Request The MKCOL method creates a new collection resource at the location specified by the Request-URI, overwriting any existing resource at Request-URI.  </s>
<s> A MKCOL request message MAY contain a message body that specifies additional characteristics or behavior of the collection.  </s>
<s> However, a server which supports MKCOL is not required to support any MKCOL request entity types.  </s>
<s> If the server receives a MKCOL request entity type it does not support or understand, it MUST respond with a 415 (Unsupported Media Type) status code.  </s>
<s> During MKCOL processing, a server MAY add the Request-URI to one or more collections within the server's controlled namespace.  </s>
<s> 4.3.1  </s>
<s> Creating Multiple Collections The server MAY create intermediate collections if they do not already exist.  </s>
<s> For example, if the collection http://server/a/ already exists in the server's namespace, then while performing a MKCOL to create 4.4 Response Responses from a MKCOL request are not cacheable, since MKCOL has non-idempotent semantics.  </s>
<s> 201 (Created) - The structured resource was created in its entirety.  </s>
<s> 403 (Forbidden) - The server does not allow the creation of collections at the given location in its namespace.  </s>
<s> 415 (Unsupported Media Type) - The server does not support the request type of the body.  </s>
<s> 416 (Unprocessable Entity) - A new status code.  </s>
<s> The server understands the content type of the request entity, but was unable to process the contained instructions.  </s>
<s> 4.5 Example This example creates a container collection called /webdisc/xfiles/ on the server www.server.org.  </s>
<s> MKCOL /webdisc/xfiles/ HTTP/1.1 Host: www.server.org  </s>
<s> HTTP/1.1 201 Created 5 INDEX Method 5.1 Problem Description A mechanism is needed to discover if a resource is a collection and if so, list its members.  </s>
<s> 5.2 Solution Requirements The solution: * must allow a client to discover the members of a collection * must always provide a machine-readable description of the membership of a collection 5.3 The Request The INDEX method returns a machine-readable representation of the membership of the resource at the Request-URI.  </s>
<s> For a collection, INDEX returns a machine-readable list of its members.  </s>
<s> For other resources, the information returned by INDEX is undefined, and MAY vary.  </s>
<s> The request message body of an INDEX request SHOULD be ignored.  </s>
<s> The Depth header can be used to indicate how much of a result can be generated for the response.  </s>
<s> The specific values allowed for the depth header when used with the INDEX method are 1 and infinity.  </s>
<s> The 1 value indicates that the immediate member resources should be reported in the result, infinity indicates that all internal descendant resources should be in the result.  </s>
<s> If the Depth header is not given, then 1 is assumed.  </s>
<s> Servers MUST honor a depth of 1. Servers MAY honor infinity.  </s>
<s> 5.4 The Response 200 (OK) - The server MUST send an application/xml response entity which describes the collection.  </s>
<s> 404 (Not Found) - Same behavior as HTTP 1.1.  </s>
<s> The server never had the resource, or the server permanently deleted the resource and has no knowledge that it ever existed.  </s>
<s> This error code implies that, essentially, the server has no information about the Request URI.  </s>
<s> 5.5 Response Message Body The default INDEX response for a resource is an application/xml HTTP entity (i.e., an Extensible Markup Language (XML) document) that contains a single XML entity called collectionresource which describes the collection, and a set of XML entities called memberesource which describe the members of the collection.  </s>
<s> The response from INDEX is cacheable, and MUST be accompanied by an ETag header.  </s>
<s> If GET and INDEX return different entities for the same resource state, they MUST return different entity tags.  </s>
<s> The server MUST transmit the following XML entities for each member resource of a collection: Ref, IsCollection, Content-Type, External.  </s>
<s> The server MUST transmit the following XML entities if it can generate any meaningful values for them: Creation-Date, Last-Modified, ETag, DisplayName.  </s>
<s> The value of content-type, last-modified, and etag XML entities MUST be identical to the value of the response header field of the same name in the HTTP/1.1 specification.  </s>
<s> Since the HTTP/1.1 header fields are described in terms of the on-the-wire entity, the values presented by INDEX are those that would be generated if the resource was accessed using the GET method without content negotiation.  </s>

<s> 6 Behavior of RFC 2068 Methods on Collections With the introduction of the collection resource type to the HTTP object model, it is necessary to define the behavior of the existing methods (defined in RFC 2068) when invoked on a collection resource to avoid ambiguity.  </s>
<s> While some methods, such as OPTIONS and TRACE behave identically when applied to collections, GET, HEAD, POST, PUT, and DELETE require some additional explanation.  </s>
<s> 6.1 GET, HEAD for Collections The semantics of GET are unchanged when applied to a collection, since GET is defined as, "retrieve whatever information (in the form of an entity) is identified by the Request-URI" [HTTP11].  </s>
<s> GET when applied to a collection MAY return the contents of an "index.html"  </s>
<s> resource, a human-readable view of the contents of the collection, or something else altogether, and hence it is possible the result of a GET on a collection will bear no correlation to the state of the collection.  </s>
<s> Similarly, since the definition of HEAD is a GET without a response message body, the semantics of HEAD do not require any modification when applied to collection resources.  </s>
<s> 6.2 POST for Collections Since by definition the actual function performed by POST is determined by the server and often depends on the particular resource, the behavior of POST when applied to collections cannot be modified because it is largely undefined.  </s>
<s> Thus the semantics of POST do not require any modification when applied to a collection.  </s>
<s> 6.3 PUT for Collections In HTTP/1.1, PUT stores the request entity under the Request-URI, and hence its semantics are limited to non-collection resources.  </s>
<s> If a PUT is invoked on a collection, the collection has the DELETE method invoked on it, and then PUT processing proceeds as specified in [HTTP11].  </s>
<s> When the PUT operation creates a new non-collection resource, a server MAY add that resource's URI to one or more collections within the server's controlled namespace.  </s>
<s> 6.4 DELETE for Collections When DELETE is applied to a collection resource, all internal members MUST be recursively deleted.  </s>
<s> The dav:link/propagate members MUST be deleted and their links must be removed.  </s>
<s> dav:link/nopropagate members MUST have only their link removed; the resources MUST not be deleted.  </s>
<s> The Depth header does not apply to the DELETE method.  </s>
<s> It cannot be used to limit the extent of the operation.  </s>
<s> If it is present and has a value other than "Infinite", the request MUST fail with a 412 (Precondition Failed).  </s>
<s> When applied to any resource, the DELETE method deletes all properties on the Request-URI.  </s>
<s> During DELETE processing, a server MAY remove the URI of the deleted resource(s) from collections within its controlled namespace.  </s>
<s> 6.4.1 New Response Codes 207 (Partial Success) Only some of the member resources were deleted.  </s>
<s> The response entity will describe any errors.  </s>
<s> 500 (Server Error) The resource was in such a state that it could not be deleted.  </s>
<s> The response entity will describe reason for the error.  </s>
<s> 7 COPY Method 7.1 Problem Description Currently, in order to create a copy of a resource, the client must GET an entity and then PUT that entity to the desired destination.  </s>
<s> This requires (1) an entity to be transmitted to and from the server and (2) that the resource be expressible as an entity with complete fidelity.  </s>
<s> This is problematic because of the network traffic involved in making a copy, and because there is often no way to fully express a resource as an entity without a loss of fidelity.  </s>
<s> 7.2 Solution Requirements The solution: * MUST allow a principal to create a copy of a resource without having to transmit the resource to and from the server.  </s>
<s> 7.3 The Request The COPY method creates a duplicate of the source resource, given by the Request-URI, in the destination resource, given by the Destination header.  </s>
<s> The Destination header MUST be present.  </s>
<s> The exact behavior of the COPY method depends on the type of the source resource.  </s>
<s> 7.3.1  </s>
<s> COPY for HTTP/1.1 resources When the source resource is not a collection, and is not a property, the body of the destination resource MUST be octet-for-octet identical to the body of the source resource.  </s>
<s> Alterations to the destination resource do not modify the source resource.  </s>
<s> Alterations to the source resource do not modify the destination resource.  </s>
<s> Thus, all copies are performed "by-value".  </s>
<s> If the Duplicate-Properties header is "false," then properties SHOULD NOT be copied to the destination resource.  </s>
<s> If the Duplicate-Properties header is "false" and the Enforce-Live-Properties header is also present, the request MUST fail with a 412 (Precondition Failed) status code.  </s>
<s> Properties SHOULD be duplicated on the destination resource by performing the equivalent actions as a logical copy of the root property on the source to the root property on the destination, following the definition for copying properties.  </s>
<s> 7.3.2  </s>
<s> COPY for Properties Live properties SHOULD be duplicated as identically behaving live properties at the destination resource.  </s>
<s> Since they are live properties, the server determines the syntax and semantics (hence value) of these properties.  </s>
<s> Properties named by the Enforce-Live-Properties header MUST be live on the destination resource, or the method MUST fail.  </s>
<s> If a property is not named by Enforce-Live-Properties and cannot be copied live, then its value MUST be duplicated in an identically named, dead resource on the destination resource.  </s>
<s> For every dead property defined on the source resource, there SHOULD be an octet-for-octet identical dead property on the destination resource.  </s>
<s> Duplicated properties MUST maintain the ordering of properties on the destination, and MUST maintain the tree structure of properties.  </s>
<s> 7.3.3  </s>
<s> COPY for Collections The Depth and Overwrite headers govern the behavior of COPY for collections.  </s>
<s> When performing a recursive copy, all HTTP/1.1 request headers are duplicated on the propagated method request except for the precondition headers If-Modified-Since, If-Match, If-None-Match, If-Range, If-Unmodified-Since, which should only be applied to the Request-URI to determine if the operation should be performed.  </s>
<s> The Destination header MUST be rewritten to preserve the membership of the destination collection, i.e., by appending the relative URI of the member to the URI of the destination collection.  </s>
<s> A Depth of "0" indicates the collection MUST duplicate all of its external members in a new collection at the Destination.  </s>
<s> Since the COPY method is not propagated to its members, no internal member resource is duplicated.  </s>
<s> A Depth of "1" indicates the collection MUST propagate the COPY to all internal, non-collection members and to all non-collection propagate external members.  </s>
<s> If the Overwrite header is "true" the COPY method duplicates all of its external members in a new collection at the Destination.  </s>
<s> If the Overwrite header is "false" and the destination resource is a collection, the COPY method does not duplicate its external members, but is propagated to all internal, non-collection members.  </s>
<s> A Depth of "infinity" indicates the collection MUST propagate the COPY method to all internal members and all propagate external members.  </s>
<s> If the Overwrite header is "true," the COPY method MUST duplicate all of its external members in a new collection at the Destination.  </s>
<s> If the Overwrite header is "false" and the destination resource is a collection, then the COPY method does not duplicate its external members, but is propagated to all internal members.  </s>
<s> A copy operation on a collection should behave as if it were performed atomically.  </s>
<s> 7.3.4  </s>
<s> Type Interactions If the destination resource identifies a property and the source resource is not a property, then the copy SHOULD fail.  </s>
<s> If the destination resource identifies a collection and the Overwrite header is "true," prior to performing the copy, a DELETE operation MUST be performed on the collection.  </s>
<s> 7.4 The Response 200 (OK) The source resource was successfully copied to a pre-existing destination resource.  </s>
<s> 201 (Created) The source resource was successfully copied.  </s>
<s> The copy operation resulted in the creation of a new resource.  </s>
<s> 207 (Partial Success) Only some of the member resources were copied.  </s>
<s> The return entity body describes the status code for each resource.  </s>
<s> 412 (Precondition Failed) This status code MUST be returned if the server was unable to maintain the liveness of the properties listed in the Enforce-Live-Properties header, or if the Overwrite header is false, and the state of the destination resource is non-null.  </s>
<s> 500 (Server Error) The resource was in such a state that it could not be copied.  </s>
<s> This may occur if the Destination header indicated an external (from the point of view of the server) resource and the server has no capability to copy to an external resource.  </s>
<s> 502 (Bad Gateway) - This may occur when copying to external resources and the destination server refused to accept the resource.  </s>
<s> 7.5 Examples 7.5.1  </s>
<s> Overwrite Example This example shows resource http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/index.html being copied to the location destination resource were overwritten, if non-null.  </s>
<s> COPY /~fielding/index.html  </s>
<s> HTTP/1.1 Host: www.ics.uci.edu  </s>
<s> Destination: http://www.ics.uci.edu/users/f/fielding/index.html  </s>
<s> Overwrite: "true" HTTP/1.1 200 OK 7.5.2  </s>
<s> No Overwrite Example The following example shows the same copy operation being performed, except with the Overwrite header set to "false."  </s>
<s> A response of 412, Precondition Failed, is returned because the destination resource has a non-null state.  </s>
<s> COPY /~fielding/index.html  </s>
<s> HTTP/1.1 Host: www.ics.uci.edu  </s>
<s> Destination: http://www.ics.uci.edu/users/f/fielding/index.html  </s>
<s> HTTP/1.1 412 Precondition Failed 8 MOVE Method 8.1 Problem Description The move operation on a resource is the logical equivalent of a copy followed by a delete.  </s>
<s> In HTTP 1.1, the procedure could be performed in several steps.  </s>
<s> First, the client could issue a GET to retrieve a representation of a resource, issue a DELETE to remove the resource from the server, then use PUT to place the resource on the server with a new URI.  </s>
<s> As is the case for COPY, because of the network traffic involved in making a move, and because there is often no way to fully express a resource as an entity without a loss of fidelity, server move functionality is preferable.  </s>
<s> With a DAV server, a principal may accomplish this task by issuing a COPY and then DELETE.  </s>
<s> Network load decreases, but the server load may still be significant because the server must create a duplicate resource.  </s>
<s> If a server knew beforehand that a principal intends to perform COPY and DELETE operations in succession, it can avoid the creation of a duplicate resource.  </s>
<s> 8.2 Solution Requirements The solution: * Must prevent the unneeded transfer of entity bodies from and to the server.  </s>
<s> * Must prevent the unneeded creation of copies by the server.  </s>
<s> 8.4 The Request The MOVE method is defined as the logical equivalent of a COPY followed by a DELETE of the source resource, performed atomically.  </s>
<s> 8.5 The Response 200 (OK) - The resource was moved.  </s>
<s> A successful response must contain the Content-Location header, set equal to the URI in source.  </s>
<s> This lets caches properly flush any cached entries for the source.  </s>
<s> Unfortunately the Content-Location header only allows a single value so it is not possible for caches unfamiliar with the MOVE method to properly clear their caches.  </s>
<s> 207 (Partial Success) Only some of the member resources were moved.  </s>
<s> The return entity body will give the status code for each resource.  </s>
<s> 412 (Precondition Failed) This status code MUST be returned if the server was unable to maintain the liveness of the properties listed in the Enforce-Live-Properties header, or if the Overwrite header is false, and the state of the destination resource is non-null.  </s>
<s> 501 (Not Implemented) - This may occur if the Destination header specifies a resource which is outside its domain of control (e.g., stored on another server) resource and the server either refuses or is incapable of moving to an external resource.  </s>
<s> 502 (Bad Gateway) - This may occur when moving to external resources and the destination server refused to accept the resource.  </s>
<s> 8.6 Examples 8.6.1 Overwrite Example This example shows resource http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/index.html being moved to the location destination resource were overwritten, if non-null.  </s>

<s> In this case, it is possible that the operation will succeed on some member resources, while it will fail on others, thus generating a 207 (Partial Success) status code.  </s>
<s> A user-agent needs to know for which members of the collection the method succeeded and for which it failed.  </s>
<s> 9.2 Solution Requirements The solution must: - communicate the status code and reason - give the URI of the resource on which the method was invoked - be consistent with other return body formats 9.3 Multi-Status Response The default multi-status response body is an application/xml HTTP entity that contains a single XML entity called multiresponse, which contains a set of XML entities called response, one for each 200, 300, 400, and 500 series status code generated during the method invocation.  </s>
<s> 100 series status codes MUST NOT be recorded in a response XML entity.  </s>
<s> Each response XML entity contains two sub-entities, ref, the URI of the resource on which the method was invoked, and status, which holds the status-line from the method invocation.  </s>
<s> A multi-status response MUST be present when a 207 (Partial Success) status code is returned by the initial method invocation.  </s>

<s> Depth: infinity Overwrite: false HTTP/1.1 207 Partial Success Content-Type: application/xml Content-Length: xxx 10 PATCH Method 10.1 Problem Definition At present, if a principal modifies a resource, they must issue a GET against the resource, modify their local copy of the resource, and then issue a PUT to place the modified resource on the server.  </s>
<s> This procedure is inefficient because the entire entity for a resource must be transmitted to and from the server in order to make even small changes.  </s>
<s> Ideally, the update entity transmitted to the server should be proportional in size to the modifications.  </s>
<s> 10.2 Solution Requirements The solution must: * allow partial modification of a resource without having to transmit the entire modified resource * allow byte-range patching * allows extensions so that patches can be done beyond simple byte-range patching * allow ranges to be deleted, inserted, and replaced 10.3 The Request The PATCH method contains a list of differences between the original version of the resource identified by the Request-URI and the desired content of the resource after the PATCH action has been applied.  </s>
<s> The list of differences is in a format defined by the media type of the entity (e.g., "application/diff") and must include sufficient information to allow the server to convert the original version of the resource to the desired version.  </s>
<s> Since the semantics of PATCH are non-idempotent, responses to this method are not cacheable.  </s>
<s> If the request appears (at least initially) to be acceptable, the server MUST transmit an interim 100 response message after receiving the empty line terminating the request headers and continue processing the request.  </s>
<s> While server support for PATCH is optional, if a server does support PATCH, it MUST support at least the application/xml diff format defined below.  </s>
<s> Support for the VTML difference format [VTML] is recommended, but not required.  </s>
<s> 10.4 application/xml entities for PATCH The resourceupdate XML entity contains a set of XML sub-entities that describe modification operations.  </s>
<s> The name and meaning of these XML entities is given below.  </s>
<s> Processing of these directives MUST be performed in the order encountered within the XML document.  </s>
<s> 10.4.1 ResourceUpdate Name: http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/patch/resourceupdate  </s>
<s> Purpose: Contains an ordered set of changes to a non-collection, non-property resource.  </s>
<s> Schema: http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/patch/  </s>
<s> Parent: XML Value: *(Insert | Delete | Replace) 10.4.2 Insert Name: http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/patch/insert  </s>
<s> Purpose: Insert the XML entity's contents starting exactly at the specified octet.  </s>
<s> Schema: http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/patch/  </s>
<s> Parent: ResourceUpdate Value: The insert XML entity MUST contain an octet XML entity that specifies an octet position within the body of a resource.  </s>
<s> A value of "end" specifies the end of the resource.  </s>
<s> The body of the insert XML entity contains the octets to be inserted.  </s>
<s> 10.4.3 Delete Name: http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/patch/delete  </s>
<s> Purpose: Removes the specified range of octets.  </s>
<s> Schema: http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/patch/  </s>
<s> Parent: ResourceUpdate Value: The Delete XML entity MUST contain an octet-range XML entity.  </s>
<s> The value of this XML entity is empty.  </s>
<s> Discussion: The octets which are deleted are removed, which meams the resource is collapsed and the length of the resource is decremented by the size of the octet range.  </s>
<s> It is not appropriate to replace deleted octets with zeroed-out octets, since zero is a valid octet value.  </s>
<s> 10.4.5 Replace Name: http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/patch/replace  </s>
<s> Purpose: Replaces the specified range of octets with the contents of the XML entity.  </s>
<s> If the number of octets in the XML entity is different from the number of octets specified, the update MUST be rejected.  </s>
<s> Schema: Replace XML entity MUST contain an octet-range XML entity.  </s>
<s> The contents of the entity are the replacement octets.  </s>
<s> 10.4.6 Octet-Range Attribute Name: http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/patch/octet-range  </s>
<s> Purpose: Specifies a range of octets which the enclosing property effects.  </s>
<s> Schema: http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/patch/  </s>
<s> Parent: Insert, Delete, Replace Value: number ["-" (number | "end")] Number = 1*Digit Description: Octet numbering begins with 0. If the octet contains a single number then the operation is to begin at that octet and to continue for a length specified by the operation.  </s>
<s> In the case of a delete, this would mean to delete but a single octet.  </s>
<s> In the case of an insert this would mean to begin the insertion at the specified octet and to continue for the length of the included value, extending the resource if necessary.  </s>
<s> In the case of replace, the replace begins at the specified octet and overwrites all that follow to the length of the included value.  </s>
<s> Octet values MUST specify locations in the state of the resource prior to the processing of the PATCH method.  </s>
<s> 10.5 The Response 200 (OK) - The request entity body was processed without error, resulting in an update to the state of the resource.  </s>
<s> 409 (Conflict) - If the update information in the request message body does not make sense given the current state of the resource (e.g., an instruction to delete a non-existent line), this status code MAY be returned.  </s>
<s> 415 (Unsupported Media Type) - The server does not support the content type of the update instructions in the request message body.  </s>
<s> 416 (Unprocessable Entity) - A new status code.  </s>
<s> The server understands the content type of the request entity, but was unable to process the contained instructions.  </s>
<s> 10.6 Examples 10.6.1 HTML file modification The following example shows a modification of the title and contents of the HTML resource http://www.example.org/hello.html.  </s>

<s> Depth = "Depth" ":" DepthToken DepthToken = "0" | "1" | "infinity" | token The optional token allows for extension.  </s>
<s> A server MUST ignore a Depth header with an unknown value.  </s>
<s> 11.2 Destination The Destination header specifies a destination resource for methods such as COPY and MOVE which take two URIs as parameters.  </s>
<s> Destination= "Destination" ":" URI 11.3 Enforce-Live-Properties The Enforce-Live-Properties header specifies properties that MUST be "live" after they are copied (moved) to the destination resource of a copy (or move).  </s>
<s> If the value "*" is given for the header, then it designates all live properties on the source resource.  </s>
<s> EnforceLiveProperties = "Enforce-Live-Properties:" "*" | 1#( Property-Name ) Property-Name = " URI " 11.4 Duplicate-Properties The Duplicate-Properties header instructs the server whether to duplicate the source resource's properties onto the destination resource during a COPY or MOVE.  </s>
<s> A value of "false" states that the server MUST NOT duplicate on the destination resource any properties which are defined on the source resource.  </s>
<s> By default, the value of this header is "true," and a client MAY omit this header from a request when its value is "true."  </s>
<s> Duplicate-Properties = "Duplicate-Properties" ":" ("true" | "false") 11.5 Overwrite The Overwrite header specifies whether the server should overwrite the state of a non-null destination resource during a COPY or MOVE.  </s>
<s> A value of "false" states that the server MUST NOT perform the COPY or MOVE operation if the state of the destination resource is non-null.  </s>
<s> By default, the value of Overwrite is "false," and a client MAY omit this header from a request when its value is "false."  </s>
<s> While the Overwrite header appears to duplicate the functionality of the If-Match: * header of HTTP/1.1, If-Match applies only to the Request-URI, and not to the Destination of a COPY or MOVE.  </s>
<s> Overwrite = "Overwrite" ":" ("true" | "false") 11.6 Destroy Header When deleting a resource the client often wishes to specify exactly what sort of delete is being enacted.  </s>
<s> The Destroy header, used with PEP, allows the client to specify the end result they desire.  </s>
<s> The Destroy header is specified as follows: DestroyHeader = "Destroy" ":" #Choices Choices = "VersionDestroy" | "NoUndelete" | "Undelete" | Token The Undelete token requests that, if possible, the resource should be left in a state such that it can be undeleted.  </s>
<s> The server is not required to honor this request.  </s>
<s> The NoUndelete token requests that the resource MUST NOT be left in a state such that it can be undeleted.  </s>
<s> The VersionDestroy token includes the functionality of the NoUndelete token and extends it to include having the server remove all versioning references to the resource that it has control over.  </s>
<s> 12 Links A collection is stored as a set of links.  </s>
<s> Internal members of the collection, and external propagate members are links of type propagate.  </s>
<s> External non-propagate members of the collection are links of type nopropagate.  </s>
<s> 12.1 Propagate Link Type Name: http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/link/propagate  </s>
<s> Purpose: A propagate link holds a member of a collection that has recursive method invocations propagated to it.  </s>
<s> Schema: http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/link/  </s>
<s> Parent: Any.  </s>
<s> Value: src, dst (See the definition of links in the companion draft, "A Data Model and Operations for DAV Properties").  </s>
<s> Discussion: The source of the link (src) must be the URI of the collection, and there must be only one destination (dst) of the link, which is the URI of the propagate member.  </s>
<s> If the URI is relative to the URI of the collection, then this link describes an internal member of a collection, otherwise the link describes an external, propagate member of the collection.  </s>
<s> 12.2 NoPropagate Link Type Name: http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/link/nopropagate  </s>
<s> Purpose: A no-propagate link holds an external member of a collection that does not have recursive method invocations propagated to it.  </s>
<s> Schema: http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/link/  </s>
<s> Parent: Any.  </s>
<s> Value: src, dst Discussion: The source of the link (src) must be the URI of the collection, and there must be only one destination (dst) of the link, which is the URI of the external, no-propagate member.  </s>
<s> 12.3 Source Link Type Name: http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/link/source  </s>
<s> Purpose: The destination of the source link identifies the resource which contains the unprocessed source of the link's source.  </s>
<s> Schema: http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/link/  </s>
<s> Parent: Any.  </s>
<s> Value: src, dst Discussion: The source of the link (src) is typically the URI of the resource on which the link is defined, and there is typically only one destination (dst) of the link, which is the URI where the unprocessed source of the resource may be accessed.  </s>

<s> A Appendix A - Open Issues The following are open issues.  </s>
<s> 1. Can you have multiple source links on a single resource?  </s>
<s> 2. Whether Depth = 1 header values should be allowed for COPY on collections 3. Should Patch octet references by cumulative or must all absolutely refer to the previous state of the resource?  </s>
<s> (I (YYG) personally believe they should be cumulative)  </s>
<s> My comments re XML usage are the same as for the previous draft.  </s>
<s> This document provokes several other thoughts.  </s>
<s> 1.1 Collection resources.  </s>
<s> I would invert the order of the first 3 paras.  </s>
<s> State the general description of the concept before the specifics.  </s>
<s> Separately, it is important to clarify whether a collection is the entirely of a literary work or whether a literary work may consists of multiple collections ("larger logical units").  </s>
<s> For publishing, as distinct from WEBDAV's particular interests, we need to be able to say that some list of resources constitutes *all and only* a particular literary work.  </s>
<s> In this case, I see no reason why a book might not consist of multiple collections (perhaps one covering chapters 1, 2, and 5, contributed by author A, and another covering chapters 3 and 4, contributed by author B). Please indicate which of these views you have in mind (or some other).  </s>
<s> 5.3, para 2, Depth header.  </s>
<s> This has been tried in SGML, Hytime, Hytime-as-revised, and simply does not work to define any but arbitrary limits in a web of documents, because documents may be deep in some places and shallow in others, and the shallow parts may link to external documents not a part of the literary work in which the links reside.  </s>
<s> Consider a collection that consists of a central work (a collection of its own) with multiple sets of annotations linked to from it.  </s>
<s> Unless you manipulate the structure of the central work so that it is evenly deep throughout, it's hard to ask for N levels of depth and get all of the central work with none of the annotations.  </s>

<s> Thank you for your comments on the namespace draft, and also on the properties draft.  </s>
<s> Just a couple notes of clarification.  </s>
<s> I have been in contact with Tim Bray, a co-editor of the XML draft, who states that there will be a new XML draft available on or close to July 1.  </s>
<s> Agreed, which is why the Depth header can take the value 0 (the collection  </s>
<s> itself), 1 (the immediate non-collection members of the collection), infinity (go as deep as you can).  </s>
<s> Do you see problems with this approach?  </s>

<s> itself), 1 (the immediate non-collection members of the collection), infinity (go as deep as you can).  </s>
<s> Do you see problems with this approach?  </s>
<s> That's not what the spec says s.v. 5.3; it lists only 1 and infinity, and I see I misread, thinking that values in between were allowed.  </s>
<s> I am confused by the terms "immediate member resources" (what is the force of "immediate") and "internal descendant resources" (not in 2. Terms).  </s>
<s> In either case it would appear that External Member Resources would not be listed, yet their only sin is that they possess an absolute URI not relative to their parent's (the collection's?) URI.  </s>
<s> So INDEX will not give a complete listing of the contents of a collection if some are differently URI'd than the collection itself, even if they are on the same server.  </s>
<s> Is that right or am I missing something?  </s>
<s> (And did you intend to allow integers between 1 and infinity?)  </s>
<s> And what is a "noncollection member of the collection"?  </s>
<s> An internal member resource that is not itself a collection?  </s>
<s> Regards, Terry Allen Electronic Publishing Consultant tallen[at]sonic.net  </s>
<s> Davenport and DocBook: http://www.ora.com/davenport/index.html T.A. at Passage Systems: terry.allen[at]passage.com  </s>
<s> Right. INDEX is defined to return a listing of the members of a collection.  </s>
<s> In the example below: A J K Z Depth of 0 would be just A (and hence a very boring listing).  </s>
<s> Depth of 1 is A, J, K. Depth Infinity is A, J, K, Z. So, INDEX was limited to Depth 1 and Infinity so it would actually return something (Depth 0 would only report information about the collection itself, perhaps its human-readable title).  </s>
<s> The intent of "immediate member resources" is the Depth 1 non-collection resources, but the proposal should be more explicit in its language.  </s>
<s> Urrr, I think this is a problem with the wording of the proposal.  </s>
<s> The intent is certainly to return a listing of external members during an INDEX, but I agree with you, the proposal does not clearly indicate this is the desired behavior.  </s>
<s> Yes. I agree, "noncollection member of the collection" is a really awkward term.  </s>
<s> - Jim  </s>
