We have two sessions (well, one two-hour and two one-hour sessions): 8/11 930-1130 Garmisch 8/12 1300-1400 Garmisch 1415-1515 Garmisch Note 8/14 1300-1500: HTTP-NG Requirements BOF 
Here is my current best guess as to times for various agenda topics. 
There are an enormous number of internet drafts. 
8/11 9:30-11:30 9:30-9:45: review of agenda 9:45-10:15: review of current draft, closed issues, conformance table draft hasn't shown up on Internet drafts directory (!) draft-ietf-http-digest-aa-rev-00.txt contains digest updates has the issue list The following I-Ds are available: draft-ietf-http-warning-00.txt draft-ietf-http-options-01.txt draft-fielding-http-age-00.txt draft-cohen-http-305-306-responses-00.txt draft-mogul-http-revalidate-01.txt draft-holtman-http-wildcards-00.txt draft-holtman-http-safe-01.txt draft-harada-http-xconnfrom-00.txt 10:15-11:30: Review of open issues, new issues (e.g., PUT-RANGE, REAUTHENTICATION-REQUESTED, REDIRECTS, SAFE, CONTENT-ENCODING, RE-VERSION) 8/12: 1300-1330 content negotiation draft-ietf-http-negotiate-scenario-01.txt draft-ietf-http-negotiation-03.txt draft-ietf-http-rvsa-v10-02.txt draft-ietf-http-feature-reg-02.txt 1330-1400 PEP draft-ietf-http-pep-04.txt 1415-1445 State Management draft-ietf-http-state-man-mec-03.txt draft-ietf-http-jaye-trust-state-00.txt 1445-1515 Working group schedule 
I suggest that draft-duerst-query-i18n-01.txt, which has now finally appeared on the anouncing list, be added to this list. 
I suggest that it is added after Koen's draft-holtman-http-safe-01.txt because it deals with the same topic of form upload and internationalization. 
Note that technically, the draft is more related to negotiation, and is intended to apply independently of HTTP/1.0 or 1.1. 
There was originally a plan to have a separate BOF on this topic, but it unfortunately had to be cancelled because a lot of specific experts (in particular internationalization experts from the browser side) were inable to attend. 
I therefore don't think it makes sense to allocate much time to it; two or three minutes would be nice. 
The main aim at the moment is to have people to take notice of the problem and the proposed solution. 
Regards,Martin. 
There are enough 'announcement of other topics' items that I'll make time for them. 
However, the working group time is extremely limited, and suggest that you attempt to schedule a BOF anyway to cover this and related I18N issues, which seem to cut across the topics of HTTP, URLs, and HTML.
