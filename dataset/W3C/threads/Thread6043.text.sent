Hi BPMN experts, I would be thankful to you all if anybody can clarify me with the followings. 
In the there is some text about Collaboration (Global) processes as, "Collaboration processes may be contained within a Pool and the different participant business interactions are shown as Lanes within the Pool. 
In this situation, each Lane would represent two participants and a direction of travel between them." 
I guess, in this situation, a lane will be representing binary collaboration. 
But in the figure 2 of (source BPMN Working group) a Collaboration Process Model has been modeled as Abstract Processes that communicate through message exchange only. 
My understanding is this is some what different approach to the text in BPMN (1.0) Can anybody clarify me how one can model collaborations with BPMN and if possible direct me some example BPMN collaboration process models. 
Thanks! 
/Prasad Hi Prasad, As a member of the BPMN WG and liaison to WS-Chor, I forwarded your questions to the BPMN group. 
I'll send you the response as soon as it is ready.

/Prasad Hi Ugo, Thank you very much and another alternative approach that we would like to see in BPMN (Binary) Collaboration process diagrams is as a self-contained process specification in single pool but defined over say three lanes: two lanes for place activities performed by collaborating roles and a middle lane for a shared space to place intermediate events with global interest (i.e. for two parties). 
This would be somewhat similar approach to the standard pattern of a transaction as in http://infolab.uvt.nl/grnsd/lap2003/dietz.pdf defined by Jan L.G. Dietz (http://is.twi.tudelft.nl/ontwerpen/people/dietz.html) 
Any comments? 
Regards!
