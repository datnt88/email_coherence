OEO Thanks OEO Clement Onime Actually, what I required is not from an adult oriented sites, or sites that contain pornographic materials. 
It is a site about the E-mail address of the graduate schools in USA. 
(I have given you two examples) I mean I could get some pages easily, but I couldn't get other pages on the same site via your server, that is strange to me. 
So I thought it is a bug and reported it to you. 
Glad to hear your reply. 
Thanks a lot.
