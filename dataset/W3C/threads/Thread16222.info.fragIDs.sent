<s> I remember having read somewhere that there is a proposed Unicode character for specifying the language of a block of text.  </s>
<s> Does anybody  </s>
<s> know anything about this?  </s>
<s> (I may be misinformed ...)  </s>
<s> If it *is* true, then I think it's interesting from an accessibility perspective.  </s>
<s> We'll finally be able to change language in the middle of attributes (e.g. in the 'alt' attribute).  </s>
<s> Any thoughts on this?  </s>
<s> Karl Ove Hufthammer  </s>
<s> I think that's the Unicode Technical Report #7 "Plane 14 Characters for  </s>
<s> Language Tags".  </s>
<s> It's available from: Note that although this TR has already been approved by the Unicode Technical Committee (UTC), those "language tags" are NOT part of the Unicode Standard Version 3.0 nor ISO/IEC 10646 yet, so they cannot be used in HTML nor XML yet.  </s>
<s> There is a joint W3C-Unicode Technical Report #20, "Unicode in XML and other Markup Languages", at: "3.8 Language Tag Characters" deals with those characters, and this TR doesn't recommend to use those language tags in markup languages.  </s>
<s> I do understand your motivation, but whenever possible, you'd better avoid using attributes to include important information and use elements with proper attributes (e.g. "lang" in HTML or "xml:lang" in XML).  </s>
<s> As for the "alt" attribute, the HTML Working Group is planning to improve the syntax of the "img" element so that alt text can be specified as an element's content rather than an attribute value in the next generation of XHTML.  </s>
<s> In this case you may change language in the middle of alt text using the "xml:lang" attribute via "span" or whatever appropriate element.  </s>

<s> Well, I think making it *impossible* to specify the language of parts of an attribute value is vary bad idea, especially in a ?new? technology like XML is.  </s>
<s> This is of course not just a problem with (X)HTML; it makes it impossible to specifiy language information in attribute values in *all* XML applications.  </s>
<s> This is very unfortunate.  </s>
<s> Well, I can do this already by using the 'object' element, but there's still problems.  </s>
<s> You can't use 'lang' or 'xml:lang' inside the 'title' or 'summary' attribute.  </s>
<s> It's often unavoidable to use words from several languages as attribute values (e.g. proper names).  </s>
<s> Karl Ove Hufthammer  </s>
<s> I imagine that when it comes time for the HTML group to redesign object (and other parts of XHTML perhaps, by and by) they will be more inclined to use full elements insterad of attributes.  </s>
<s> This is certainly the apparent trend among similar groups like SVG and SMIL.  </s>
<s> I agree that it is a problem not being able to internationalise attributes.  </s>
<s> The two approaches are to redesign the elements so they have content (like object does in general, although not for title) that can be real XML, and therefore can be internationalised, or to add attributes that describe the properties of other attributes.  </s>
<s> Either case means buidling new tools, but in teh second one it gets messy much more quickly.  </s>
