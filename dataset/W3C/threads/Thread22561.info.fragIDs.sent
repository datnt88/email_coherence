Am I correct to assume that when splitText() is called on a CDATASection node, the return value (new node created) should be a CDATASection node rather than a simple Text node? 
Should this be noted 
in the spec [1]?

Good question, and good catch. 
Given that we've now moved splitText down to characterData -- which is also 
the ancestor of Comment -- I think I agree that the description needs to be updated. 
And I think you're probably right about the implication that split should create another node of the same type as the node which is being split. 
(Just checked my Level 1 implementation, and I didn't special-case this for CDATASections; they just inherited Text's version, which generated a Text node for the second half. 
That did meet the spec, but...) Joe Kesselman / IBM Research 
Hmm, that'd be in a non-public draft; the latest DOM L2 has only Text.splitText(). 
It doesn't move that method "up" (!) in the hierarchy. 
What was the rationale for that change? 
Re the original question (does splitting a CDATA node make a new text node or a new CDATA node), that also calls to mind few more questions: Document.createCDATASection 
("]] "); Document.createComment 
("--"); Those examples -- and countless related ones where the offending string has other characters before or after it, possibly including those strings -- would appear to create DOM documents which violate basic XML syntax. 
Ditto appending such text to a CDATA section or comment (or appending "-" to a comment ending in "-", etc). 
But those createXXX() methods don't have ways to report any exceptions. 
Shouldn't L2 stipulate that such calls report some sort of DOMException?

Um, we haven't moved splitText at all, it's still on the Text interface. 
Changed the wording to clarify that indeed, splitting a CDATASection node should give you a new CDATASection node.
