<s> Am I correct to assume that when splitText() is called on a CDATASection node, the return value (new node created) should be a CDATASection node rather than a simple Text node?  </s>

<s> Good question, and good catch.  </s>
<s> Given that we've now moved splitText down to characterData -- which is also  </s>
<s> the ancestor of Comment -- I think I agree that the description needs to be updated.  </s>
<s> And I think you're probably right about the implication that split should create another node of the same type as the node which is being split.  </s>
<s> (Just checked my Level 1 implementation, and I didn't special-case this for CDATASections; they just inherited Text's version, which generated a Text node for the second half.  </s>

<s> Hmm, that'd be in a non-public draft; the latest DOM L2 has only Text.splitText().  </s>
<s> It doesn't move that method "up" (!) in the hierarchy.  </s>
<s> What was the rationale for that change?  </s>
<s> Re the original question (does splitting a CDATA node make a new text node or a new CDATA node), that also calls to mind few more questions: Document.createCDATASection  </s>
<s> ("]] "); Document.createComment  </s>
<s> ("--"); Those examples -- and countless related ones where the offending string has other characters before or after it, possibly including those strings -- would appear to create DOM documents which violate basic XML syntax.  </s>
<s> Ditto appending such text to a CDATA section or comment (or appending "-" to a comment ending in "-", etc).  </s>
<s> But those createXXX() methods don't have ways to report any exceptions.  </s>
<s> Shouldn't L2 stipulate that such calls report some sort of DOMException?  </s>
<s> - Dave  </s>
<s> Um, we haven't moved splitText at all, it's still on the Text interface.  </s>
<s> Changed the wording to clarify that indeed, splitting a CDATASection node should give you a new CDATASection node.  </s>
