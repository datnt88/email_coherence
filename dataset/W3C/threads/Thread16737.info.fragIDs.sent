<s> Graham - My inital thoughts are that a Notes developer should be able to create a table within a form that would include the TH element, using passthrough HTML code if neccessary.  </s>
<s> The form with this embedded table would then serve as a template for specific documents.  </s>
<s> Here are a few examples from a Notes/Domino website I've developed that could serve as examples , although I haven't used the TH element myself yet.  </s>
<s> In particular, version 3.2 of the CheckYourPage tool uses embedded HTML code to provide internal links to the various sections.  </s>

<s> Charles, The problem I have seen with lotus notes tables is that they are free form by design.  </s>
<s> there is no standard tempplate to follow.  </s>
<s> One table can be neatly set up with columns (which indicate the field names of the table) and unique rows that show each interation of the data contained within the table itself.  </s>
<s> The next table can have its fields located anywhere on the screen, multiple line formats which make a very big headache for screen readers to follow.  </s>
<s> I really think that Lotus has to standardize its format of table representation in order to make it accessible for people using screen readers.  </s>
<s> This falls in line with the many database developers I find writing custom forms that are visually pleasing, but hell on a screen reader.  </s>

<s> No, you are making a big assumption here.  </s>
<s> Lotus Domino provides for "pass-through" code which is added by the author explicitly, as a way of extending what the system itself supports.  </s>
<s> You can certainly use that to provide th elements.  </s>

<s> I'm assuming that you are talking about the Domino designer tool.  </s>
<s> According to the documentation, one can either use the tool to generate html code, or one can insert pre-written code.  </s>
<s> For the latter instance, the TH tag is supported.  </s>
<s> If the issue is pass through HTML, thats a horse of a different color.  </s>
<s> Many tools let the developer/designer get away with not writing alt tags, etc. Front Page is such a tool, and given that the Microsoft platform is the most proliferate at the government level, it seems a more problematic issue.  </s>

<s> Joy, thanks for the clarification.  </s>
<s> Graham Oliver wrote the intial request, so I will defer to him.  </s>
<s> But as I read it his original request was specifically whether it was possible to get the th element _without_ hand-coding such as inserting passthrough code.  </s>

<s> Yes I was looking at being able to generate the 'th' element without reverting to hand coding html.  </s>
<s> I think that the biggest leverage with Lotus is a focus on the 508 legislation / WAI checkpoint 'Row and column headers shall be identified for data tables' I don't think it would be too big a stretch for them to build it into Domino Designer.  </s>
<s> They have been very good at considering accessibility of the Lotus Notes client.  </s>
<s> Interestingly enough when Domino renders a view to the web it does so as a table, with 'th' elements for the column titles.  </s>
<s> Thus it is possible to create a table that satisfies the letter of the above law, but how the resulting 'table' would perform under a screen reader I don't know.  </s>
<s> I am just finishing (today) an article on how to produce an accessible form with Domino.  </s>
<s> One of the underlying themes of the article is to produce accessible design whilst leveraging Domino's RAD (Rapid Application Development) capabilities.  </s>
<s> The form ends up as Double A compliant without too much work.  </s>
<s> If anyone would like a copy, just let me know.  </s>
<s> btw Charles I have tried to contact Cynthia Ice at Iris (the developers of Notes/Domino) because I think she is their accessibility person, but no reply so far.  </s>
