Hello, I've jotted down some notes about some of the issues that we've faced in the production of UAAG 1.0, entitled "Hurdles of User Agent Accessibility Guidelines 1.0" [1]. 
Comments to this list are welcome on this document, which I hope can be used as the basis for a report after UAAG 1.0 becomes a Recommendation about our experience. 
I also hope that it proves useful as a starting point for identifying requirements for UAAG 2.0. 
I hope that it prevents us from digging up old issues that we've addressed, or at least when we do dig them up that we don't have to start discussions from scratch. 
I don't have any schedule for editing this document. 
As ideas occur to me (or are suggested by you), I may update it, but I may not if we get busy processing review comments. 
If you have suggestions for other topics that should be covered in this document, please let me know. 
If the WG decides at some point that there is consensus about what's in this document, we can put another label on it. 
For now, the status section says that it is endorsed by no one.

can we call it milestones?

Funny you shoudl ask. 
I used a thesaurus to find a better word than "hurdle", but stuck with hurdle in the end. 
Mirriam-Webster says that "milestone" means "a significant point in development", and this could apply. 
However, for me there's also an implication of linearity (perhaps because milestones used to appear every mile). 
And the document as written does not suggest a linear relationship among the steps. 
I have no strong feelings against "milestones".

I think that the document is a valuable resource.
