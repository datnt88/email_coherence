Thanks for the review Marja - Entering name etc. seems to be optional. 
The tool should also state that they are not demanded. 
well, I really want people to fill their name and email in, but I don't want to force them, so I'm just presenting them with the text field. 
I'm concerned that if I add "optional" somewhere, they will not fill it in at all. 
- Would be nice to know how many steps there are. 
just added on the first page - Could we have an option Reset also next to send info? 
You mean, in step4 ? 
something different than the back button ? 
- The text is long. 
I would simplify the message text a little bit e.g.: Hello, This message comes to you from the World Wide Web Consortium's Web Accessibility Initiative (W3C WAI) report tool at (cc: field) of your Web page or site. 
This user experienced difficulty accessing your page either due to a disability (visual, auditory, physical, or cognitive) or due to device limitations (poor connection bandwidth, no support for graphics or support turned off, a voice interface such as a webphone, etc.).

there are important I think. 
- could the webmaster have an easier ui to these reviews if there are more of them? 
A Web page? 
right now, they have the archive, but good idea for improvement. 
- Entering name etc. seems to be optional.

on the other hand, if they think it is demanded and they don't want to give it they might not send the report at all - Would be nice to know how many steps there are. 
- Could we have an option Reset also next to send info? 
yes, so that you can still change your mind when you have seen all there is - The text is long.

URL: www.w3.org Date: Thu Aug 26 15:37:05 1999 I also changed the order a bit to group general things talking about the tool together and then go to the actual errors and their explanation. 
I thought it was shorter as a whole.

Marja - could the webmaster have an easier ui to these reviews if there are more of them? 
A Web page? 
I see. 
We could add "(optional but encouraged)" after each reporter label (name and email). 
- Could we have an option Reset also next to send info? 
I don't get it, this is not an interactive form anymore, so what would reset do exactly ? 
OK, let me reread it.
