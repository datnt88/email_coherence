A dumb thought which I'll share here first instead of sharing on IG: Maybe alt text should _only_ be used for images which are text-as-graphics. 
Everything else gets null alt text. 
Okay, expanding on that a little more. 
The purpose of alt is to be a textual equivalent/substitution/alternative for an image. 
The only textual equivalent for an image is, literally, the text on the image. 
So if an image is my name in a fancy font, the alt text is "Kynn". 
If it is a picture of me, the alt text is "" (quote quote). 
Why? 
Because there's no text in there for the alt to be the equivalent of. 
Let's look at a case raised on the IG list earlier this week: Alt attributes are NOT FOR DESCRIPTIONS. 
"Ducks on the lake on a warm summer day" is a DESCRIPTION of the image. 
This makes NO SENSE as alt text. 
The alt attribute text should flow with the rest of the text. 
After all, that is how it will be read. 
[...] Now, suppose that this lake with ducks is right next to Big Hall, and that the function of the image is to give visual users a sense of what life is like in Big Hall. 
Then an appropriate alt text might read: "Big Hall overlooks Campus Lake and its duck denizens." 
Here is how this flows: "... 
There are four residence halls on campus. 
The biggest is Big Hall, located at the northernmost point on campus. 
Big Hall overlooks Campus Lake and its duck denizens. 
The next biggest is Middling Hall..." I agree with Mr. Munat's statement that alt attributes are not for descriptions. 
I disagree with his next suggestion, though, of hiding image interpretation within the alt text. 
New term: image interpretation. 
We have "text alternative" which I am redefining here to be "the text contained with the graphic"; we have "description" which is "what the picture looks like"; and now we have "image interpretation" which is "what the image is meant to convey." 
It is my suggestion that "image interpretation" is as appropriate for alt attributes as descriptions, which is to say NOT AT ALL. 
Image interpretation should be part of the visible, visually accessible text of any context in which the image appears. 
In other words, the page's visible text content should contain the intended interpretation of the hall and the ducks, which is the point of the image. 
How is this encoded? 
It should either clearly appear within the page's textual content in context, or should be associated via markup. 
There are few markup methods for doing this reliably; one method which is barely acceptable is a one-cell data table with a caption . 
The lack of clear way to associate interpretive and/or descriptive text with an img is an obvious shortcoming of HTML; this should be passed along via PF to the HTML Working Group (XLink may help here). 
Anyway, so the three ways of giving textual information about an image would be: textual equivalent - via alt attribute description - via longdesc interpretation - via actual content and/or markup To answer one objection: I am aware that we discourage the use of textual graphics. 
This discussion has no real bearing on that except to note that in an ideal world where CSS were implemented and there were strong associations between images and description/interpretation, there would be no further use for the alt attribute as I have proposed its use here. 
Thoughts? 
Is this merely proof I've been up too late at night and my mind isn't working properly, or is it a stroke of genius, or somewhere in between? 
--Kynn PS: The term 'longdesc' is dangerous to accessibility. 
This term should simply be 'description' or 'desc' and future versions of XHTML should drop the 'long' prefix. 
The name of the attribute supports the mistaken notion that alt text is for description -- what is longdesc a longer description than? 
Another suggestion to pass along to HTML WG. on the WCAG working group.

Forthcoming: Teach Yourself CSS in 24 Hours Well, I think the PS is pretty smart. 
And I think that if HTML was different (say, was SVG, or what me might like to have in XHTML 2, or some other language) your idea might be applicable. 
But the semantics of HTML and in particular of the relationship between img element and alt attribute (and coincidentally to some extent between the object element and its content) lead me to conclude that your fundamental idea of not using alt for anything except text content is wrong. 
This basically feeds from the ideas I ahve tried to express about the difference between "all content of a document" and "the information a document is trying to convey", and why I think those are important concepts for us to be able to use and identify, in the xtech thread on definition of content (nearly all of the posts in thread). 
There is nothing in the HTML specification that suggests that an img combined with an alt and perhaps a longdesc and/or title is insufficient for conveying information, and that the information in that collection of content must be reproduced in any other form. 
I amm not sure that the specification is correct about this, but I don't think you have established that it is wrong, either. 
I think in a number of cases the use of a graphic identifier (which is the only kind of text I think is reasonable to leave in images, and precisely because I think it is a graphic device that may be related to the shapes of letter in the way that my singing may be related to music) and a text equivalent probably is sufficient, and in other cases adding a full equivalent via a longdesc reference means there is enough there.

Hi, I think when it comes to alt text we need to be very specific about what images require alt tags and what does not (bear with me - this will eventually make sense in context of this discussion). 
1. 
Is the image used for ornamental purposes? 
Ornamental purposes include anything which serves no purpose other than to make the site look a certain way, this means from spacers, transparent gifs, to footer lines etc. 
These images should not have alt text. 
I think everyone is clear on that. 
2. If the image is not used for ornamental purposes, is the image used to present certain information? 
3. If the image is used to present certain information, is the information presented elsewhere? 
This is the point I think Kynn was making. 
If the image is used to present information that is presented elsewhere, then its function as an image is purely ornamental, thus see point 1. 
Using the duck analogy, I really think it is an author call. 
For example, let's say the ducks represent a rural atmosphere at Big Hall. 
Whether this image requires an alt tag depends on the content. 
If the content says 'Big Hall is renowned for its rural atmosphere...', then the image is representing the text, and thus no alt tag is required. 
If the content says, 'Big Hall is the biggest and brightest hall in the entire world...', then the image will be adding more information and therefore requires an alt tag.

(my minor reservation is that I think that an image might be used as a placeholder, and it may be useful to provide some things twice. 
I might be inclined to leave blank alt text, but add a title to an image like "figure 7 - described below" - except that I generally prefer to use a smarter format than the img element, which means a whoe different approach to the technical details grin/ ) cheers chaals (discourteous cc to Kynn - I know he is on the mailing list, but I haven't said hello to him for a while) Hi, I think when it comes to alt text we need to be very specific about what images require alt tags and what does not (bear with me - this will eventually make sense in context of this discussion).
