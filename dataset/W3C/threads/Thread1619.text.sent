This is a change request - I hope it's not too late: A compare-baseline REPORT only contains version URLs. 
This makes it very painful to find out what the changes are in terms of the VCRs that are exposed by the DAV:baseline-collection. 
I would like to see, instead of version URLs being reported by the DAV:compare-baseline, the VCR URLs from the corresponding DAV:baseline-collection(s). 
I would propose the following (just for the added-version case, deleted-version and changed-version would be similar): A DAV:added-version element identifies a member of the DAV:baseline-collection of the compare baseline version whose DAV:checked-in version belongs to a version history from which no version is the DAV:checked-in version of a member of the DAV:baseline-collection of the request baseline. 
As an alternative, both URLs could be reported (VCR and version URLs). 
Boris. 
Now that we have the DAV:baseline-collection for a baseline, I agree that this is a much more appropriate value for the results of this report. 
In particular, I'd just return the VCR URL from the DAV:baseline-collection (you could get the version URL from the DAV:checked-in property, if you cared). 
Does anyone object?

Of course not :-) However, now that I have a supporter I can at least try to be a bit more greedy ;-) For my anticipated use of this report, getting the version URLs as well would be a substantial gain over having to query the DAV:checked-in property for each change. 
Boris. 
As a potential implementor of this report... no issues. 
Personally, I'd also like to see move/copy reflected in the comparison report. 
If a client is fetching the report to detect a difference, it would be nice to see "ah. that was copied from over there ". 
I don't have anything solid syntax to suggest here, though. 
I'll write something up if people think it would be beneficial? 
(and with the understanding that a server is not required to record copies/moves in the report, but could use add/delete).

Agreed. 
Another alternative to making the DAV:checked-in special (or saying that the version resource URL is explicitly returned), is to simply allow a DAV:prop element to exist in the report request, and each set of properties will be returned for each [VCR] href mentioned in the report.

OK, let's get a bit more disciplined here (:-). 
Does anyone else want this change to be made? 
By default, it stays the way it is (i.e. version URLs) unless the working group expresses a clear preference for making the change. 
Note that one could compute the VCR's from the version URLs by just doing a Depth PROPFIND for the DAV:checked-in property on the baseline-collection, and then match up the version URLs with the versions from the Depth PROPFIND.

Assuming that Depth:infinity is not available (a good presumption, given the use of baselines in the first place as a way to avoid overload), then your PROPFINDs will take log(N) requests before you find the VCR that corresponds to version in question. 
However, if you return VCR URLs, you can get the VR URL in a single PROPFIND.

Nah, DAV:prop is obsolete, think DAV:expand-property! BTW the DAV:baseline-collection is defined as a collection of checked-in version-controlled resources -- I assume that the collection itself is 'protected', i.e., servers will fail attempts to check-out those VCRs otherwise the property definition is violated. 
Tim Good point! 
I'll add the appropriate preconditions to CHECKOUT, MERGE, and UPDATE.
