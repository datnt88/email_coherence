Does anyone know of any assistive technologies that are using XML content as part of creating an alternative renderings or alternative inputs. 
This information will be useful in compiling our implementation report and help support the requirements associated with the use of the DOM.

WWW: http://www.w3.org/wai/ua ION Systems' eMonocle reader uses XML content in the Open eBook (OeB) DTD to allow rendering of the content at whatever size font the user needs - from 4 point to 144 point. 
Additional functionality allows low-vision, dyslexic, and scotopic (light and color sensitive) users to on-the-fly adapt the eMonocle user interface to meet their vision and processing needs.

Where Electronic And Print Worlds Converge eMonocle (tm) an XML viewer for simultaneous use by sighted, low vision and, in the near future, blind readers. 
Web Eyes (tm) a web plug-in facilitating compliance with Section 508 and accessibility to any web page for low-vision users.

The players for the ANSI/NISO Standard Digital Talking Book use XML content and are very happy that they get to. 
There are multiple competing implementations. 
Al Al, Are the assitive technologies using the DOM to access content?
