<s> Is this test supposed to have deep="false"?  </s>
<s> In the description it says it should be true but the xml file has: PS: Also the order of the expectedResult members is foiling my assertEqualsList function.  </s>
<s> Not sure if those are supposed to appear in order but it would be nice if you could flip them if it doesn't make any other difference.  </s>

<s> The discrepancy between the test description and the body also appears in nodecloneattributescopied and has apparently been carried over from the original NIST test suite.  </s>
<s> This particular test should not be affected by the value of the deep parameter.  </s>
<s> Unless there are  </s>
<s> objections, I'll change the test description to be consistent with the test body.  </s>
<s> I do not think that it would be very helpful to have a second test where deep really is true.  </s>
<s> On the PS, since the expected result is declared as a "Collection" and not a "List", assertEquals should do a order insensitive comparison.  </s>
<s> The JavaScript production is function hc_nodecloneattributescopied() { var result = new Array(); var expectedResult = new Array(); expectedResult[0] = "class"; expectedResult[1] = "title"; for(var _index = 0; _index  attributes.length;  </s>
<s> _index++) { attributeNode = attributes.item(_index);  </s>
<s> attributeName = attributeNode.nodeName;  </s>
<s> result[result.length] = attributeName; assertEqualsCollection("nodeNames",toAutoCaseArray(expectedResult),result); The Java production is: public void runTest() throws Throwable { java.util.Collection result = new java.util.ArrayList(); java.util.Collection expectedResult = new java.util.ArrayList(); expectedResult.add("class");  </s>
<s> expectedResult.add("title");  </s>
<s> for (int indexN10061 = 0; indexN10061  attributes.getLength();  </s>

<s> attributeName = attributeNode.getNodeName();  </s>
<s> result.add(attributeName);  </s>
<s> assertEquals("nodeNames", expectedResult, result); The assertEquals(String, Collection, Collection) and assertEqualsCollection() should pass as long as both collections have the same number of elements and each element in one collection appears once and only once in the other collection.  </s>
