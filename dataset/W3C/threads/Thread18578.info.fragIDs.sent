<s> Recently I have found time to read some sections of the HTML 4.0 draft, now that it is publicly available.  </s>
<s> I have noticed that the suggestion for an ACRONYM element has been included, and that abbreviations are to be handled by client-side dictionaries.  </s>
<s> It is suggested that link elements in the document's head could provide references to dictionaries for specialised vocabularies.  </s>
<s> However, in the discussion of link types, no  </s>
<s> type value is given for abbreviation dictionaries.  </s>
<s> One solution might be:  </s>
<s> where "dictionary.html" is an HTML document in which each abbreviation and its expansion is given in a definition list.  </s>
<s> I think this is a reasonnable request and I'm forwarding it to the HTML working group (who still has open issues from us on the media type extension and the cascading style/alternate rule).  </s>
<s> I'll take the opportunity of this message to say that this HTML 4.0 public release is not a W3C "recommendation" yet (not even "proposed recommendation"), it is just the announce of the availibility of the public draft, and more importantly, of the version number (so that companies can start claiming conformance with 4.0...) This means we're still on hook for giving input to the HTML WG.  </s>
<s> Just to clarify this proposal, I would emphasize the importance of not only specifying what the link type should be, but also prescribing the  </s>
<s> format of the dictionary file itself.  </s>
<s> Unnecessary compatibility problems  </s>
<s> would arise if different software developers were allowed to decide upon their own dictionary file formats.  </s>
<s> Hence, a single standard for the dictionary file should be provided right from the outset.  </s>
<s> As already indicated, my initial suggestion (and this is of course open to debate if necessary) is that the dictionary file be an HTML document, in the body of which there is a definition list with one entry for each abbreviation.  </s>
<s> Note that if we use a LINK as in There is always the possibility, as when used with Style sheet, to indicate the type: I think this is as far as we can go in this context, and trying to  </s>
<s> define a file format for abbreviation dictionary should be a separate  </s>
<s> effort.  </s>
<s> to follow up on what Daniel Dardailler said:  </s>
<s> On the one hand, I have to agree with Daniel that the issue of  </s>
<s> formats for a public dictionary interface should be worked out  </s>
<s> for dictionaries in general, and not be done in a peculiar fashion for the disability community.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, the universal design approach suggests that we recognize Braille users as a language minority, and because language minorities have an interest in circulating dictionaries separate from applications, that we recognize that our client community has an interest in the success of a public dictionary interface that is fully integrated with the application of HTML and styles.  </s>
<s> -- Al Gilman  </s>
<s> I agree that the HTML specification is not a suitable location for  </s>
<s> describing the preferred dictionary file format and that the issue should  </s>
<s> be treated separately.  </s>
<s> Would it be best to develop an "abbreviation dictionary" specification specifically for this purpose, as a separate document, which could perhaps be included on one of the W3C pages that deals with markup?  </s>
<s> I would still maintain the importance of defining the dictionary file format, and of doing so before the concept of an abbreviation dictionary is widely implemented so that there is little opportunity for divergent standards and incompatibilities to arise.  </s>
<s> Abbreviation dictionaries are likely to be relatively small, and require only two fields per entry: one for the abbreviation and the other for its expansion.  </s>
<s> Thus, the file format would be relatively simple, and I would suggest using an HTML document for several reasons.  </s>
<s> Firstly, it can easily be created using any HTML authoring tool or text editor.  </s>
<s> Secondly, the markup for language identification and the full ISO 10646 character set would be available, as is necessary in a truly international context.  </s>
<s> Thirdly, HTML provides a simple mechanism, namely the definition list, whereby abbreviations and their expanded forms can be listed.  </s>
<s> It could.  </s>
<s> I don't know exactly how W3C expect to deal with the proliferation of new XML DTD or DTD-like proposals in the future.  </s>
<s> It is important, but it's hard to prioritize it against others, like, say, micropayment information format, or chemical molecule representation.  </s>
<s> True, but one could argue that it is a perfect application for XML, where you could define a more semantically richer set of tags, using a small DTD with things like ABBREV and EXPAN .  </s>
<s> Anyway, I'll bring it up in the HTML forum.  </s>
<s> Since XML syntax is reasonably stable, this solution would indeed be suitable even in the short term, provided that W3C is planning to create, or at least register, a certain number of official DTD's for use in specialised applications.  </s>
<s> I was able to meet up with Daniel Dardailler last week in Sophia Antipolis.  </s>
<s> We discussed this idea.  </s>
<s> Its not clear to me what format is appropriate.  </s>
<s> The simplest format would be to place each definition on a separate line, e.g. DrDoctor MrMister okokay A more sophistocated approach would allow one to specify the pronunciation of the expanded form using a textual encoding of phonemic/prosodic information.  </s>
<s> This would be contingent on our choosing such an encoding, which is something we want to do for HTML in any case.  </s>
<s> Maybe for now its best to just reserve a term for linking abbreviation dictionaries.  </s>

<s> I agree that defining a link type for the abbreviation dictionary is an  </s>
<s> important first step.  </s>
<s> Also, I have wondered to what extent the abbreviation dictionary and the phonetic markup work can be combined.  </s>
<s> For example, an external dictionary file might be an appropriate means of  </s>
<s> implementing phonetic markup.  </s>
<s> However, abbreviation dictionaries perhaps  </s>
<s> should not be connected exclusively with the phonetic work, since they may be useful to braille translators as well (for example, I understand that the French braille system distinguishes between a full stop (point) and a "point abbreviatif", which is used in abbreviations).  </s>
<s> I would suggest using either an XML DTD or an HTML document, as discussed earlier in this thread.  </s>
<s> The abbreviation dictionary certainly needs the equivalent of the HTML 4.0 LANG attribute, and should allow a full multinational character set to be used.  </s>
<s> I agree that it would be helpful in some instances for phonetic markup to be included as well.  </s>
<s> to follow up on what Dave Raggett said:  </s>
<s> It is better to reserve a keyword or expression (pattern of keywords) for linking [all kinds of] dictionaries and let the dictionary itself declare its domain of applicability to be expanding abbreviations.  </s>
<s> All dictionaries are collections of entries.  </s>
<s> Each entry binds one short text to one or more longer texts.  </s>
<s> The application of these relationships [dictionary entries] should be up to the dictionary and the application that applies them against the document.  </s>
<s> Not special codes in the document itself.  </s>
<s> At one use of a word one might want to encode the equivalent of for definition use Webster_document select sense #3 .  </s>
<s> But references to dictionaries in the document should simply add the dictionary to the context without specializing the notion of "dictionary".  </s>
<s> Al Gilman  </s>
<s> Exactly. Regards, -- Dave Raggett dsr@w3.org  </s>
