<s> (Eudora won't let me set that myself-- I hate it when Eudora embarrasses me like that) Al Gilman wrote me to ask:  </s>
<s> Would you have the time or interest to review this module and see if they have broken, or failed to add, anything that is needed for accessibility?  </s>
<s> I have only a couple of comments, but a few of them are biggies.  </s>
<s> 4.4.  </s>
<s> CSS System Colors 4.4.1.  </s>
<s> CSS2 User preferences for colors  </s>
<s> I have disputed the need for system colours in the first place (you'll see it in the "Type &amp; Colour" chapter of my upcoming book,  </s>
<s> _Building Accessible Websites_ http://joeclark.org/book/ ).  </s>
<s> I am not convinced it is a good idea to make Web sites or Web applications look like native-operating-system applications.  </s>
<s> I just don't see the need, and I am reminded of designers who make banner ads or even  </s>
<s> graphical Submit buttons look just like MS Windows or Mac OS X buttons.  </s>
<s> And Mozilla developers went to extreme lengths to design their own user interface for forms widgets, including menus and buttons, which exactly contradicts the ethos of system colours even though it results in very odd-looking interfaces on Macs.  </s>
<s> There is no clear need for system colours, and they are poorly implemented.  </s>
<s> In any event, given the W3C's principle of device independence--  </s>
<s> The goal of this document is to suggest that Web content and applications can be authored, generated or adapted for a better user experience when interacting with presentations via many different Web-connectable access mechanisms.  </s>
<s> The general phrase "device independence" is used for this, although the access mechanisms may include a diversity of devices, user agents, channels, modalities, formats etc.  </s>
<s> -- there are a few additional forms of system colours that need to be added.  </s>
<s> I would point out that system colours already defined seem to indicate a narrow focus on application development (e.g., window colours).  </s>
<s> That is, application developers figure "These are the only system colours anyone could possibly ever need."  </s>
<s> But we can think of a couple of access-related system colours: * Highlights for low-vision people (screen magnification and/or colour substitution) * Subtitle and caption colours HIGHLIGHT COLOURS You already have ~4 system highlight colours.  </s>
<s> I could suggest adding: ZoomHighlightForeground Colour for foreground when using display magnification.  </s>
<s> ZoomHighlightBackground Colour for background when using display magnification.  </s>
<s> ZoomPerimeter Colour for outside edging of magnified area during display magnification.  </s>
<s> ReverseColourForeground Foreground colour used during reverse display.  </s>
<s> ReverseColourBackground Background colour used during reverse display.  </s>
<s> SubstituteColourForeground Foreground colour used during substituted-colour display.  </s>
<s> SubstituteColourBackground Background colour used during substituted-colour display.  </s>
<s> Rationale: Low-vision users can zoom the display on their computers or other devices.  </s>
<s> They may wish to alter the underlying original colours to make the zoomed version easier to read-- typically there will be a rounding up to simple black-and-white.  </s>
<s> They may wish to add a different colour around the edge to delineate that edge.  </s>
<s> Example: ZoomHighlightForeground = white ZoomHighlightBackground = black ZoomHighlightBackground = white This gives you white text (and other content) on a black background with a white border.  </s>
<s> Or: ZoomHighlightForeground = yellow ZoomHighlightBackground = black ZoomHighlightBackground = gray Now, it is possible that you have a colour deficit but have adequate visual acuity.  </s>
<s> You may wish to simply invert the colours displayed on your screen.  </s>
<s> Usually this will mean two steps: (1) simplify colours by reducing the variety of colours and (2) change to white on black (remember, without magnification this time).  </s>
<s> But you could set any colours you wanted, like white on blue if you remember and liked the old DOS WordPerfect colours.  </s>
<s> Example: ReverseColourForeground = white ReverseColourBackground = black Or your system may use more complicated logic that will *substitute* specific colours for other colours.  </s>
<s> If you have a red-green colourblindness (usually protanopia or deuteranopia), you may want everything red to become blue and everything green to become purple.  </s>
<s> You could then use: SubstituteColourForeground(red) = blue SubstituteColourBackground(green) = purple (In all these examples, exactly how you configure your software or adaptive technology to do this isn't the Working Group's problem.  </s>
<s> We're just setting variables.) Reversing and substituting colours apply display-wide, hence we don't need an edging colour.  </s>
<s> CAPTIONS AND SUBTITLES First of all, the two are not the same.  </s>
<s> Captions are visible words that transcribe the dialogue and other important sound effects, move to indicate speakers, and use other forms of speaker identification.  </s>
<s> Intended audience is deaf (though in practice more hearing people watch captions in North America http://joeclark.org/hearing-maj.html ).  </s>
<s> Subtitles are visible words that translate dialogue and occasional onscreen type.  </s>
<s> Intended audience is hearing.  </s>
<s> I define "accessibility" to include accommodating any characteristic  </s>
<s> a person cannot change or cannot change easily.  </s>
<s> I am aware this is a more sweeping definition than disability-obsessed advocates particularly like, but just as you can't stop being deaf when you  </s>
<s> want to watch _Run Lola Run_, you can't suddenly start to understand German, either.  </s>
<s> And actually, the W3 definition is compatible with mine:  </s>
<s> Accessibility  </s>
<s> The art of ensuring that, to as large an extent as possible, facilities (such as, for example, Web access) are available to people whether or not they have impairments of one sort or another.  </s>
<s> Moreover, it is quite possible to have separate captions and subtitles-- often in the same language-- on a single program or film.  </s>
<s> So we have to consider them as two peas in a pod.  </s>
<s> Now, in furtherance of the goal of device independence *while also* providing increased compatibility with devices we already know exist, I am suggesting the addition of a few system colours.  </s>
<s> They deal with foreground, background, mask (background area extending well beyond the characters themselves), and edging (shadow on characters-- already found in system colours).  </s>
<s> I'm using the term "character" rather than "display element" here, since the latter is overly general and hard to understand in this context.  </s>
<s> The "mask" colour would extend well beyond the character bounding box, e.g., the bottom third of the screen could be grey.  </s>
<s> Device-independent tokens: CaptionForeground Foreground colour for caption characters.  </s>
<s> CaptionBackground Background colour for caption characters.  </s>
<s> CaptionMask Colour for large background region behind caption characters.  </s>
<s> CaptionShadow Colour for edging or shadow on caption characters.  </s>
<s> SubtitleForeground Foreground colour for subtitle characters.  </s>
<s> SubtitleBackground Background colour for subtitle characters.  </s>
<s> SubtitleMask Colour for large background region behind subtitle characters.  </s>
<s> SubtitleShadow Colour for edging or shadow on subtitle characters.  </s>
<s> The above tokens provide compatibility with: * Any generic subtitling or captioning system * Analog captioning (Line 21 or 22; World System Teletext), which really only has foreground and background colours (no mask or shadow) You'd use language codes to differentiate captions and subtitles in various languages.  </s>
<s> No need to reinvent that wheel.  </s>
<s> Device-specific tokens: Here we provide compatibility with * DVD (four available colours).  </s>
<s> * U.S. digital television (see notes).  </s>
<s> There is no compatibility for European digital television because subtitles and captions are sent as bitmaps.  </s>
<s> Searching the available standards documents http://pda.etsi.org/pda/home.asp?wki_id=3653 (you need to register; but try http://pda.etsi.org/exchangefolder/ets_300743e01p.pdf ) shows next to nothing to do with colour.  </s>
<s> It seems to be unselectable by the viewer.  </s>
<s> In any event, the generic tokens above could be used.  </s>
<s> DVDB DVD Background colour.  </s>
<s> DVDP DVD Pattern colour.  </s>
<s> DVDE1 DVD Emphasis 1 colour.  </s>
<s> DVDE2 DVD Emphasis 2 colour.  </s>
<s> DTVForeground Foreground colour for DTV characters.  </s>
<s> DTVBackground Background colour for DTV characters.  </s>
<s> DTVMask Colour for large background region behind DTV characters.  </s>
<s> DTVShadow Colour for edging or shadow on DTV characters.  </s>
<s> DTVEasyForeground Foreground colour for easy-reader DTV characters.  </s>
<s> DTVEasyBackground Background colour for easy-reader DTV characters.  </s>
<s> DTVEasyMask Colour for large background region behind easy-reader DTV characters.  </s>
<s> DTVEasyShadow Colour for edging or shadow on easy-reader DTV characters.  </s>
<s> DTVWideForeground Foreground colour for wide-aspect DTV characters.  </s>
<s> DTVWideBackground Background colour for wide-aspect DTV characters.  </s>
<s> DTVWideMask Colour for large background region behind wide-aspect DTV characters.  </s>
<s> DTVWideShadow Colour for edging or shadow on wide-aspect DTV characters.  </s>
<s> Notes: DVDs use four colours for subpictures (called B, P, E1, and E2, though the names are not cast in stone).  </s>
<s> Subpictures are full-screen bitmaps that can be put to any purpose, though usually they're used for subtitles/captions and menu elements.  </s>
<s> (And karaoke!) http://www.dvddemystified.com/dvdfaq.html#3.4 (gigantic file) Note that the four transparency values associated with the four DVD colours can already be handled by this proposed CSS3 spec.  </s>
<s> Even after reading the books _DVD Demystified_ and _DVD Authoring and Production_, the exact role of the colours is unclear to me, and in any event, the subtitler/captioner may provide TIFFs of subpicture bitmaps with certain values for the colours and the authoring house may go in and change them.  </s>
<s> In any event, if the authoring house can change them, so should the viewer be able to-- it's not unimaginable.  </s>
<s> Now, in U.S. digital TV, no terminological distinction is given between captions and subtitles.  </s>
<s> Arguably this is a mistake.  </s>
<s> There is a reliance on language codes to solve the problem, but all that means is that if you ask for ENG captions, you may end up with ENG subtitles.  </s>
<s> Or if what you really want are ENG subtitles, you cannot ask for them specifically; you can only ask for ENG captions and hope that the *form* of the visible words is subtitle-like.  </s>
<s> The DTV spec provides for regular, easy-reader, and letterbox or widescreen captions.  </s>
<s> The same program can carry all three in each of several languages.  </s>
<s> The spec documents are Word files available here: http://www.dvddemystified.com/dvdfaq.html#3.4 .  </s>
<s> You want ATSC 65 http://www.atsc.org/standards/A65-A.doc .  </s>
<s> There is no Google HTMLified version.  </s>
<s> Note that there are no colours defined in the DTV spec.  </s>
<s> It's left up to the receiver, which really implies a relationship between the receiver and the viewer (e.g., receiver could give you white captions on black *and that's it* or could let you select any colours you like).  </s>
<s> The same four generic parameters-- foreground, background, mask, and shadow-- are applicable here, so that's what I listed.  </s>
<s> Remember, the principle here is device-independence (hence the generic tokens) as well as acknowledging the real world, which W3C standards docs are usually not very good at.  </s>
<s> COLOURBLINDNESS The spec currently says:  </s>
<s> 4.5.  </s>
<s> Notes on using colors Although colors can add significant amounts of information to document and make them more readable, please consider the following guidelines when including color in your documents: * Don't use color combinations that cause problems for people with color blindness in its various forms.  </s>
<s> That pretty much tells you nothing.  </s>
<s> I wrote an entire chapter on the topic; it's hard to sum up.  </s>
<s> And you *can* use confusable colours in unconfusable ways.  </s>
<s> * If you use a background image or set the background color, then be sure to set the various text colors as well.  </s>
<s> I wish that advice were fine-tuned.  </s>
<s> If you have a CSS that does nothing but add a background colour and you assume foreground will inherit (I use these all the time), it is actually better not to set the foreground so that the background-setting style will be more easily applied to a range of entities.  </s>
<s> The CSS validator warns me all the time about this even though I of all people know what I'm doing.  </s>
<s> I suppose the validator cannot quite be educated enough to know when the user is smart or stupid.  </s>
<s> And anyway, they're just warnings, not errors.  </s>
<s> * When practical, adopt common conventions to minimize user confusion.  </s>
<s> Oh, maybe.  </s>
<s> http://www.spiked-online.com  </s>
<s> uses different colours for each section, and it makes perfect sense to me (and isn't inaccessible).  </s>
<s> I don't see why this clause is necessary.  </s>
<s> Now, then.  </s>
<s> DO WE HAVE TO INCLUDE ALL THIS?  </s>
<s> I know this is last call for this spec, and I am arriving very late to the party, but if you want to do more than just *say* you're using the CSS3 colour module for accessibility, you have to look after a few details.  </s>
<s> I don't see any harm in adding a few dozen more system colours, since, as we all know, they will continue to be ignored by most devices.  </s>
<s> Except, actually, *access-related* devices may *specifically* pay attention to the tokens I suggest we add.  </s>
<s> Suddenly system colours will actually be used-- just not by IE Version Whatever on Windows, which isn't the be-all and end-all in the first place, but by (for example) software DVD players and Web-enabled DTV receivers.  </s>
<s> WHAT'S WITH THE Us?  </s>

<s> Accessibility http://joeclark.org/access/  </s>
<s> Weblogs and articles http://joeclark.org/weblogs/  </s>
<s> You may not think there is a need but marketing people put this very high on their *want* list when generating thin client, web browser, based implementations of products that previously existed as native applications (although not specifically for colours).  </s>
<s> CSS is largely about pandering to wants, rather than what is strictly needed for efficient communication.  </s>
<s> I think the reason that people like the narrow definition is that it is more commercially acceptable.  </s>
<s> Companies don't like catering for what they consider unprofitable markets (leaving aside the validity of that judgement) but, providing everyone else is in the same position, they are more comfortable in supporting people that they can imagine being themselves in later life of their children than people in general.  </s>
<s> The people here running a consultancy or addressing accessibility on behalf of their employers have to take account of this to remain in business/employed; you can possibly see some of this in the person who recently reported that they had had to double subscribe to allow them to express their own opinions.  </s>
