<s> At the telecon I mentioned that we had been conceiving of datatyping as a layer, whereas now we are conceiving of datatyping as "built-in".  </s>
<s> To try and give some examples, in S-A, S-B, TDL, Stake-in-the-ground, the syntaxes (Graph, RDF/XML, N-triple) were unchanged.  </s>
<s> The basic MT was unchanged.  </s>
<s> So a datatyped RDF/XML document could be interpreted by a non-datatype aware RDF processor.  </s>
<s> (Such a processor wouldn't understand the datatypes, but it would not make mistakes.  </s>
<s> Datatyping basically adds additional entailments, and additional guide to the applications).  </s>
<s> Now, however we have moved to a position in which the graph itself is changed and hence all other syntaxes and the MT MUST ab initio understand datatyping.  </s>
<s> There will not be any possibility of supporting RDF 2002 without datatyping.  </s>
<s> Thus the normative content of the datatyping spec is necessarily normative content of the syntax, abstract data model, and model theory specs.  </s>
<s> It is not clear to me that the non-normative content alone justifies another document.  </s>

<s> It seems to me that only a very small portion of the normative content of the datatyping spec needs mention in the other specs, specifically those parts relating to the RDF/XML and graph representations of typed literals.  </s>
<s> It think it would be sufficient for the other specs to say the minimal amount necessary and reference the datatyping spec for elaboration, examples, etc. Eh? Patrick  </s>
