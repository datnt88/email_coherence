Hello, This proposal comes from an action item received at the 28 July teleconf [1]. 
In the 16 July revision of the UAGL [2], checkpoint 9.9 reads: 9.9 Make available the primary language of a document's content. 
[Priority 3] For example, use HTTP header information or language attribute information from the document root. 
Proposed change (Priority 1, for assistive techologies): Render content according to natural language changes identified by markup. 
For unsupported natural languages, allow the user request prompting when language changes. 
NOTES: a) This checkpoint is meant to cover checkpoints 4.1 and 4.3 from WCAG 1.0: both primary language and language changes. 
Note that since 4.1 is priority 1, this one is too. 
b) This checkpoint is also meant to allow users to turn on/off support for alerts to language changes.

aloha, ian! 
i cast an unequivocal vote of support for your proposal... it would be of utmost utility for anyone using assistive technology -- not only speech-output, but refreshable braille and screen magnification as well... one question (with appologies to thatch) -- since the ian's proposed checkpoint is flagged "for assistive technologies" would hybrids such as HPR be covered by this checkpoint?

It is merely a question of conformance. 
Any piece of software may claim conformance as an assisitive technology, which means that it satisfies a subset of the checkpoints. 
If HPR wishes to claim that type of conformance, it must satisfy that checkpoint. 
The question remains: are the two categories useful and will it make sense for software we are familiar with to conform to one category or the other? 
This issue is on the agenda of today's teleconference.... [1] - Ian [1] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999JulSep/0096.html
