<s> Hi Manos,  </s>
<s> Great questions, but perhaps I am biased.  </s>
<s> I have written (and support) a web based XML editor and, separately, I also use Tidy for web publishing of HTML.  </s>
<s> A couple things.  </s>
<s> My XML editor is medium-tech.  </s>
<s> I parse the DTD and generate a config file that drives a form generator package.  </s>
<s> It is good for  </s>
<s> throwing up a data entry form for simple to medium complexity XML instance docs.  </s>
<s> We use it to maintain data sets and parameter sets used by financial modelling tools and it works well for this purpose.  </s>
<s> It is also useful to decouple simple data maintenance from UI/presentation.  </s>
<s> We can configure XSLT pages to render a particular "Document Type" (defined as the DTD URL + the root element name).  </s>
<s> Document editing, however, is much more complex.  </s>
<s> Further, the DTD does not fully describe the document semantics (for either SGML or XML variants of HTML).  </s>
<s> So I ask folks to use their HTML editor of choice and run everything through Tidy at upload time.  </s>
<s> I also convert everything to XHTML on the way in, so that anyone can pull out document fragments using generic XML tools.  </s>
<s> Within the system, we just use Tidy, but this feature is still experimental.  </s>
<s> ActiveX is probably a decent way to go.  </s>
<s> I.e. you need a more response UI for document editing than HTML forms can provide.  </s>
<s> There is a TidyCOM component included with TidyGUI (See  </s>
<s> motivations for the SourceForge project is to build a library version of Tidy to make it simpler to integrate into browser plugins or what have you.  </s>
<s> See http://tidy.sourceforge.net.  </s>
<s> We are closing in on our "bug fix" release (which actually has significantly enhanced HTML handling).  </s>
<s> So work will be commencing on tidylib Real Soon Now.  </s>

<s> Hi Charlie,  </s>
<s> Yes XML is supposed to enable the ease of web based development among other things but poor implementations of standards continue to make a mess out of our every day work.  </s>
<s> Interesting and practical.  </s>
<s> Can I hope for sourcecode lying around somewhere on the web?  </s>
<s> Let's not talk about forms, I had much trouble building that grid interface out of xhtml/css2 ;-)  </s>
<s> Okie dokie.  </s>
<s> I am still hoping that the java version of Tidy might be used instead of the tidy/com wrapper combo after all.  </s>
<s> The grid interface should work just fine in Mozilla (and I'm sure there's room for getting better thanks to a solid CSS support), it would be sad to find out all this work will be useless in other browsers.  </s>
<s> Also, Jtidy would be easier for me to extend.  </s>
<s> Anyway, I'll just start experimenting while keeping an eye on the tidy.sourceforge  </s>
<s> page.  </s>
<s> Promise I will report back with any implementation + documentation to put in the pot as well.  </s>
<s> Thanks for your reply.  </s>
<s> Kindest regards, Manos  </s>
