<s> I am sending a complaint to yahoo.com - I have had 21 of these messages so far.  </s>
<s> They all seem to be advertising websites on geocities.com  </s>
<s> If we all complain, maybe they'll take action.  </s>

<s> All this garbage seems to come through the list.  </s>
<s> I believed that such messages were bounced to the sender.  </s>

<s> The way to report the spammer is to forward one of the messages to abuse@yahoo.com.  </s>
<s> Had I read any of the messages, I would be sure to boycott all products or services advertised!  </s>

<s> Not to beat a dead horse, but we should probably count ourselves as lucky.  </s>
<s> Some public lists I have seen are 99% spam, and I would never post to those lists.  </s>
<s> It is unfortunate that the html-tidy archives are publically available for spam harvesters to troll - a technique that works for Apple Computer's public list archives, is to simply password protect the archives with a documented password that must be entered to continue; other mailing list archives obscure the poster's EMail address.  </s>
<s> I maintain the "tidy-develop" mailing list - this is a closed list, and the users never get to see the spam that gets sent to the list administrator - on a good day I receive 1 piece of spam, on a bad day, it is currently running at about 3-4 pieces.  </s>
<s> I see spam from the same senders occasionally, both to personal EMail addresses, and to lists I am a member of - I recently rejoined the "html-tidy", and I hope that didn't trigger this latest event.  </s>

<s> Good idea.  </s>
<s> To which address will you send your mail ?  </s>
<s> abuse@yahoo.com  </s>
<s> I originally sent a covering note with one of the spams as an attachment.  </s>
<s> I got a reply saying the full headers were not there (they were, of course: I checked) and they cannot receive attachments.  </s>
<s> I resent the complaint, with the entire message (including headers) cut-and-pasted in.  </s>
<s> They haven't bothered to reply.  </s>
<s> [Apologies for slow response: Pipex mail servers had a problem] I had another bunch just now and will be complaining about *all* of those.  </s>
<s> Fortunately I don't get bothered with much spam of late.  </s>
<s> I have discovered after blocking just some of them (I have set up my yahoo account to operate from within Outlook Express, which I would recommend others to do also) a lot of the other spam no longer comes through, this confirms that a lot of them are originating from the same organization/s, just with spoofed headers &amp; sender names etc.  </s>
<s> Maybe you should get to know some of the hacker/s and or hacking groups and after finding out the spammer/s true identity, anonymously mailbomb them (with some sort of subtle warning message included in the email/s), giving them some of their own medicine.  </s>
