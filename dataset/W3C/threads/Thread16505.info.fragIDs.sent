<s> Hello A colleague of mine has asked if there is any information on metadata and accessibility.  </s>
<s> I've not really come across anything about this - can anyone help?  </s>
<s> Thanks very much Kirsty Baker Open University Library  </s>
<s> Hi, yes there are a few bits and pieces.  </s>
<s> First, there is a PICS scheme for identifying WCAG conformance of pages dating back to June 1999 - There is the EARL project, which aims to use metadata to provide detailed information about accessibilty assessments - http://www.w3.org/2001/03/earl  </s>
<s> There is the RDF-based text-only SVG viewer - http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/ASVG which builds on some work in chapter 5 of the "Accessibiltiy Features in SVG" Note - http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG-access Brian Kelly of JISC in the UK has also done some work on this topic...  </s>
<s> From time to time I talk about the topic - an example of some simple slides  </s>
<s> is at http://www.w3.org/2001/Talks/0506-semwai/slide1-0 but that misses the bits that I explained during the talk... cheers Charles McCN  </s>

<s> You pretty much have to get involved in the process by which this is emerging.  </s>
<s> It hasn't been reduced to cut and dried handbook stuff yet.  </s>
<s> The current generations of WAI draft guidelines say "use it."  </s>
<s> The EARL development in the Evaluation and Repair group is working on one way to share such information.  </s>
<s> In terms of a concrete proposal for an access-related vocabulary in which to say things, I would give the lead to the IMS Project as who will probably have a proposal on the table first.  </s>
<s> If your friend has any willingness to _do something_ about this beyond a "just tell me what I have to do" approach and can't figure out what to do next, please have them get in touch with me.  </s>

<s> Kirsty, You and your colleague might also look at the Dublin Core metadata standard, although you may already be familiar with it give your library association.  </s>

<s> The SALT Partnership (Specifications for Accessible Learning Technologies) is working on extending the IMS specifications to handle accessibility needs.  </s>
<s> Metadata is one of the specifications we are examining right now.  </s>
<s> We are looking for ways to code information about the accessibility of instructional materials so that they can be delivered to users with disabilities in the most appropriate way, based on a profile of the user's needs.  </s>
<s> Our Working Group includes some folks from the Open University.  </s>
<s> Martyn Cooper and Chetz Collwell of the PEARL Project are contributing their efforts to design an XML-based user profile/interface to our specifications work.  </s>
<s> A project description for SALT is at: The IMS Accessibility Working Group web page doesn't have much on it as we have just gotten started, but it is at: The PEARL Project is at: I hope this information is useful to your colleague.  </s>
