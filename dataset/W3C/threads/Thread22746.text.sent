I would like to get some feedbacks from this list on having a DOM Bindings repository on the W3C site. 
The documents followed an offline discussion with some of the members of the Python community. 
(and http://www.w3.org/2001/01/DOMBindingsSubmission). 
The problem: - The DOM specifications are only including OMGIDL/ECMAScript/Java bindings. 
(the main reasons are of course needs and interests.) The proposed solutions: 1- Put a page on the W3C page with links to the bindings (note: "bindings" not "implementations"). 
No review or endorsement from the W3C. 
I'm not fond of this idea since I don't think it will improve a lot the current situation. 
2- Include them in the DOM specifications. 
That's no easy since it required reviews and work from the DOM WG but that's still a possiblity. 
This kind of approach will be under the official W3C Process. 
3- something between 1 and 2: the DOM Bindings repository. 
No endorsement from the W3C but a public review of the bindings. 
There is no internal consensus that this is a good idea and this is why I'm looking for comments. 
One of the major comment was that it will be hosted by the W3C and will gain an implicit endorsement from the W3C (which you can't have without the approval of the W3C members). 
Someone already proposed to host the repository outside the W3C site but is it really what the community is looking for? 
Any ideas or comments? 
Philipe Interesting... I seem to be the editor of the Python DOM bindings; should I be involved in this, or would such a restriction be limited to W3C members? 
Actually, would it make sense to break out the Java and ECMAScript bindings into separate documents? 
These are of no interest to large portions of the DOM-using development communities. 
This would be acceptable. 
This would be problematic, as many of the players in the Python/XML community are not members of the W3C and will not be able to join just to work with the DOM bindings effort. 
What is a "public review" in this context? 
Does it simply mean that it would be easier to find information on bindings for languages not directly handled by the W3C? 
The Python community already has a working group for XML topics, and there hasn't been any discussion there about requesting endorsement from the W3C -- the Python community generally ahbors adding process to what is essentially a technical issue. 
On the other hand, I'm not at all opposed to a repository of bindings documents, regardless of it's endorsement status with the W3C. 
-Fred Fred L. Drake, Jr. fdrake at acm.org PythonLabs at Digital Creations What I would suggest is that the W3C keep supporting the three types of bindings that they currently support (OMGIDL/ECMAScript/Java) for consistency and speed sake. 
Then, after a working draft becomes a recommendation, have a bindings recommendation referenced from the DOM recommendation. 
This would consist of having three "areas" stored for the recommendation. 
The DOM recommendation itself, a bindings reference page that the recommendation refers too, then the DOM bindings. 
In this manner the DOM recommendation itself would not change, just a reference (the binding reference page) would change. 
Jeff Yates Regarding the Python DOM Bindings discussion, Uche Ogbuji included your email address in the offline thread. 
Regarding the DOM Bindings repository, it would be a public repository, with public-only comments. 
Hum, rereading the proposal, this is not obvious. 
I need to clarify that. 
On one hand, I would say yes. 
It would also resolve the case of the numbers that are possible to be included in the DOM spec. 
with separate documents, there is no more limits. 
On the other hand, having separated documents increase ... the numbers of documents. 
Our communication team wasn't pleased at all of the split of DOM Level 2. It will increase the number of documents in /TR a lot. 
So, for the moment, the only reason why we didn't do that is a practical reason. 
An other possibility would be to remove the bindings from the specs and put them somewhere else (let's say /DOM). 
They will be no longer normative in that case and I don't think that we want that. 
"public review" is that it will give a chance to people to reject the proposed bindings. 
If someone sends an other (incompatible) version for the Python DOM bindings, I won't a good reason to not list them in the DOM page. 
Philippe I've now dug back through my inbox and found those emails, and read them. 
Thanks for the pointer. 
I understood that the repository would be public; I still don't know what the comments are -- comments *by* the public, or comments by the W3C *to* the public? 
[In response to my suggestion to move the bindings out of the DOM spec...] There are no limits either way, unless your bits are heavier than mine. 
;-) Ah... a classic document management problem. 
I'll consider that a W3C internal matter, and keep out of it. 
I have no reason to suggest that the status of the Java or ECMAScript bindings be changed; I think careful standardization is a good thing. 
This is a little odd. 
If there is a reason for the public to reject a particular binding, that implies that non-rejection is meaningful in some sense. 
If W3C endorsement is not meant by keeping the bindings document in the repository, I'm not sure what is being rejected. 
If it's a matter of people saying they don't like a binding for whatever reason, that's fine, but I'm not sure what is gained over having a mailing list archive for that. 
(Which is not to say there shouldn't be a forum associated with the repository; it's just unclear what the goal is.) -Fred Fred L. Drake, Jr. fdrake at acm.org PythonLabs at Digital Creations Yes. 
grin/ More accurately, it should be an ongoing discussion of whether what's being proposed makes sense from both the DOM and the user-community points of view, and iteration toward a solution which is a good fit (or at least an acceptable fit) to everyone's requirements. 
Joe Kesselman / IBM Research Yes, a DOM Bindings Repository is indeed what the community is looking for, Philippe. 
I do not, however, agree that publicly reviewed bindings for which a listing is posted on the W3C site will garner an implicit endorsement. 
Endorsements come with inclusion in the spec. 
Not so for disclaimed listings. 
Please seriously consider solution #3. smirk These comments have absolutely nothing to do with the fact that I'm probably just a few days away from making what would be a formal DOM Binding Submission for Lingo.
