I have a 17" 1280x1024 screen. 
The base fontsize is a *wee bit* too tiny for my eyes to read. 
Any way to expand it? 
I can't see any.

Create a $(HOME)/.amaya.css 
containing a magnification command applied to BODY: e.g: BODY { magnification : 1 } As an example here is my .amaya.css file, doing justification of paragraphs and a slight magnification: * CSS 1.0 Style Sheet produced by Amaya * User's Preferences * URL : /users/veillard/.amaya.css 
* Last updated 06/25/96 17:10:50 by veillard on praslin BLOCKQUOTE P { text-indent : 0pt; line-height : 16pt; text-align: justify } LI P { text-indent : 0pt; line-height : 16pt; text-align: justify } P { text-indent : 15pt; line-height : 16pt; text-align: justify } UL P { text-indent : 0pt; line-height : 16pt; text-align: justify } DD P { text-indent : 0pt; line-height : 16pt; text-align: justify } BODY { magnification : 1 } /* CSS end */ Note however that magnification implementation is not perfect, it does not do proportionnal scaling of each elements.

Works for me. 
Thanks! 
Some suggestions: o You should publish the source as soon as possible. 
The more people working on the code, the better. 
Yes, some people might hack on it in ways that are incompatible with yours. 
Since you're the authors, you have the perfect right to ignore what they do. 
But some people will write good code, donate their efforts back to you, and you'll find it useful. 
Life is too short to have to do ALL your own programming. 
o The bottom scroll bar refuses to go away, no matter how large I make the window. 
o I'd really, but REALLY, prefer that the scroll bar scroll the text as I move it, and not just after I release the button. 
o I'd like to see Emacs keys for navigating through the document. 
o One thing I really like about PageMaker is that the current text attributes are reflected in the state of the buttons used to change them. 
So, when you move over Emphasized text, the Italics button goes down. 
o File menu could use a "Revert" item. 
o Consider not caching anything. 
If people want a cache, they can point to a caching proxy server, which might even be running on their own machine. 
o Consider using helper applications for mailto:, ftp:, gopher:, news:, at least in the beginning anyway.
