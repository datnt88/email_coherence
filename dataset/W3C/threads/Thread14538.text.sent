E.g. nonliteral translation="going from bad to worse" out of the frying pan into the fire /nonliteral Something like that (modulo the attribute design) would also benefit ESL (English as Second Language) like me who have problem understanding idioms/expressions usually learnt in the early ages of the native speakers. 
It's part of the larger class of alternate (alt for image, expansion of acronym, etc) so should be accounted for in XHTML 2.0 in a generic way. 
E.g. nonliteral translation="going from bad to worse" out of the frying pan into the fire /nonliteral On the other hand, it -does- place a very large burden on the author to know which expressions learnt in the early ages might not be understandable by any given audience. 
It's hard to know what words are "okay to use" even if you're talking about people who speak the same language -- e.g., from different parts of the U.S., or U.S./England, etc. --Kynn, wife is British Kynn Bartlett kynn@idyllmtn.com like me who have problem understanding idioms/expressions One of the problems is that users of "I blew my top" are frequently unaware that it's idiomatic. 
When we tell a blind guy "its' the blue one right over there" we succumb to this feature. 
"But it is the blue one!" 
How do we remember that there is a semantic tone to much of language that is often opposite of what's said: "yeah, right!" meaning "wrong" but there being decreasing-with-use/familiarity with that fact? 
Is "pragmatics" an indispensable part of markup? 
It is clearly one of the main barriers to machine translation and often the basis for much "ethnic humor". 
Love. 
ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE I will try to set up practice page first, and get some feed back if it significantly helps comprehension. 
I think this stuff comes under checkpoints for simplifying language. 
Maybe we should say "provide alternatives for idiomatic or complex text content" as a checkpoint. 
This would include multimedia alternatives as well as simplified text content. 
For the specific case of clarifying short text I would suggest using Ruby - which is part of XHTML 1.1 but has a method for working in older browsers. 
The example would be marked up as: ruby rb out of the frying pan into the fire /rb rp (that is In an old HTML browser this will come out as out of the frying pan into the fire (that is from bad to worse) and in one that supports ruby the normal stylesheet presentation in Amaya would mean the explanation is above the original text, but with the following user stylesheet fragment: ruby { ruby-position: inline } rb { display: none } rp { display: none } rt { display: inline ; font-size: 100% } rt:before { content: "[" } rt:after { content: "]" } the ruby would be displayed as [from bad to worse] Note that this can be further enhanced by the use of class, to select specific classes of ruby structures to display like this. 
More info on Ruby can be got from the specification http://www.w3.org/TR/ruby - it was developed by the internationalisation (I18N) working group, and is to do something that is commonly used in East Asia.

Location: 21 Mitchell street FOOTSCRAY Vic 3011, Australia (or W3C INRIA, Route des Lucioles, BP 93, 06902 Sophia Antipolis Cedex, France) E.g. nonliteral translation="going from bad to worse" out of the frying pan into the fire /nonliteral Unfortunately, the "literalness" of a word or expression is a very subjective determination. 
By way of example, consider the words "fascinate" and "enchant." 
Both originally meant to spellbind or bewitch -- i.e., to use sorcery or magic. 
However, few speakers of English consider the original, literal meaning of these words when using them. 
Should one mark up "fascinating" when one uses it to mean "very interesting" as opposed to its literal meaning of "sorcerous"? 
If not, then where is the distinction made? 
Such a checkpoint would be, I fear, unverifiable. 
Most English is very idiomatic, in ways that native speakers really do not comprehend most of the time, especially those with low literacy levels. 
In fact, most people, it seems, would write "put up with" instead of "tolerate," especially if told to write "clearly and simply." 
I don't believe most American Web designers have the ability to distinguish nonliteral/idiomatic language sufficiently to mark it up properly, even if it were clearly defined. 
Also, in some writing, a certain intentional vagueness of meaning is part of the communication -- humour is frequently based on such things. 
And one can't really mark up humour. 
Some means of designating mode of writing (e.g., Brussels bureaucratic English versus Douglas Adams [R.I.P.] versus American creative-writing textbook) might be useful, but that really falls under the markup folks' purview. 
Using Ruby (as Charles suggested [1]) is a good solution for certain cases, but as he mentioned, all this falls under general clarity of communication.
