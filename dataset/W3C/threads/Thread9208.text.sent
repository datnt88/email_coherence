Corrections to me please. 
Dave Was Dan Connolly actually present on the teleconference? 
Brian I lurked on IRC. 
I don't think that should count as attending; in particular, I don't consider myself party to the decisions made in the meeting. 
If you'd rather I didn't lurk on IRC, just to keep the boundaries of the meeting clear, let me know.
