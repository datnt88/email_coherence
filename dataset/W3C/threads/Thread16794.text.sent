I read for the "Disabled People" the expression "PEOLPLE WITH LIMITED FUNCTIONS". 
I think this expression is more appropriate in this time of emancipation. 
Personally I prefer to speak about "PEOPLE WITH SOME LIMITED FUNCTIONS" to make clear that this people are not limited in all their functions . 
Though this often is thought as I have heard. 
I never found disabled a nice word, but I am Dutch. 
It's honest, though. 
And frankly...speaking as someone who IS disabled...Why NOT? 
I personally find the new emphasis on political correctness ("Physically challenged", "People with Limited Functions", etc.") pitiful. 
Frankly...This is bitter, but hey. 
If you normals want to make like you're so damn caring...Do it with actions. 
Not with revisionist vocabulary. 
John Normals=Able-bodied people. 
Hey, I'm bitter. 
Otherwise...That's a Dutch legal problem. 
Using revisionist vocab will solve NOTHING. 
You need to more clearly define eligibility if you're getting that. 
John I am sorry but this conversation is in my opinion, both off topic and inappropriate.

Hi all, In the Dutch newsbrief "accessibility. 
nl". 
I read for the "Disabled People" the expression "PEOLPLE WITH LIMITED FUNCTIONS". 
I think this expression is more appropriate in this time of emancipation.

I read the haiku of Charles Munat and the flames war mail on the gl-list (is puiblic, is not it) It inspired me to the following poem: The right flamelight??? 
When there are more than one on a list there is always one who insist to have the right flame in the night but what does happen when it is the wrong light ? 
The others cannot see any light and say do you see: this was not the right way you must change all your mind we love only peaceful mankind Ineke van der Maat Lelystad (NL), Thursday the 23th of August 00.15 h Is there some-one on this list who can write the guidelines in a poem. 
I think that will better stick as a sea of words. 
Cheers Ineke van der Maat Hi John, Thank you for your reaction. 
What are you calling normals? 
Did you ever see a normal human being and did you like this? 
I can understand your opinion, but when you know that in the Netherlands nearly one million of people are declared medically unfit to work and get social security money their whole life long because they have a handicap, is my question Why can anybody who has rsi for instance, don't do other work? 
We have 16 million people in this country and nearly one million people cannot work anymore????? 
And many branches need more personal... 
That is of course a social/political question. 
But makes me clear there is something wrong in thinking about disabled people.. That's why I try to find another name. 
But you are right an other more clear name can perhaps change something in mind, but only action is the right way. 
Though a more specified name can change perhaps something in peoples mind... it is only a begin..... and finally action the end?

John -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- Hash: SHA1 This relates to one of the reasons why I prefer to think of accessibility wrt the web in terms that include people using text-only browsers, mobile devices, etc. as well as people with disabilities. 
While using a text-only browser I am, in web terms, someone with limited functions, and the fact that I can choose to see images as well is irrelevant at that moment. 
The most non-PC term for people with disabilities; "handicapped", is actually useful here, though of course I'd never use it to refer to a person's innate abilities. 
People aren't inherently handicapped, but they are handicapped when society and technology doesn't allow them to do something. 
Technology can remove handicaps (Many of the "able-bodied" on this list would be handicapped in a hunter-gatherer society as without glasses they would find many everyday tasks difficult or impossible, in this society they're not even considered disabled, because we have the technology to completely remove that handicap), and it can cause handicaps by allowing some people to do something and not allowing, or actively preventing, others. 
Similarly society can remove or create handicaps in terms of how it treats people with disabilities (or for that matter people that society discriminates against). 
In terms of an accessible web I think our main focus is not so much to assist people with disabilities, but not to handicap any of our users. 
If something makes use of our websites more difficult than it needs to be then there is a problem there, whether this is because of a physical or cerebral disability isn't important, or even any of our business. 
In terms of accessibility and computers in general there are two focii, one is the same as above, and another is to actively remove handicaps, ideally as much as glasses stop myopia from being a handicap. 
Where people with disabilities should be our only concern is in legislation that mandates the above as a matter of justice and civil rights. 
There are two implications to this way of looking at accessibility on the web in a wider sense than just working to help people with disabilities. 
One is a matter of general attitudes to people with disabilities. 
We live in discriminatory societies that quite frankly don't like people with disabilities. 
This dislike ranges from patronising pity, through selfishness to outright fascism. 
The more we can work to technologically assist people with disabilities as part of a wider perspective that also assists other people the more integrated attitudes will be in society as a whole. 
Another implication of this is the flip side of my argument. 
Just as working to enable sites for everyone will include enabling them for people with disabilities, so enabling sites for people with disabilities will enable them for other people as well, which is useful to remember if you find yourself having to justify the cost of work that will increase a site's accessibility (as a "real-world" example, only shops that are wheelchair accessible get my custom, as I'm normally pushing at least one of my children in a push-chair. 
While the selfish or the plain broke businessperson may decide they can do without people with some disabilities they are usually losing a greater market than they immediately realise as well).

In fact, this is how I am presenting the subject of accessibility to the groups and businesses that I am talking to about the subject. 
Don't think of accessibility as something only for the "disabled," but as a way to make sure that everyone can use the web. 
I talk about baby boomers with failing vision, people listening to the web/email being read to them in their cars, people with carpal tunnel, people using wireless devices, people with broken arms, people in low-light environments, people who are color blind, people who for whatever reason have slow connections or old computers,etc. 
-- providing statistics with figures in the tens of millions. 
That gets my audience thinking in terms of something different than "we don't have any blind people using our website." 
Once they start realizing that they probably do have potential customers who can't use their websites, or that their customers have employees and customers who need accessible websites, it is easier to get them to seriously consider making their websites accessible. 
Then we can get down to the WCAG, section 508 and 255, etc. standards. 
Or even better, get past the section 508 standards (or relevant statutes in other countries than the US) -- the "law" -- and just start talking about how to make their websites accessible.
