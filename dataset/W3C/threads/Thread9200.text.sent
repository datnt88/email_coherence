Hi Brian, I recently tried to articulate the working model that I use and it came out something like this: There is a set of resources R. 
Each member of R is identified by a URI by which I mean: r1.uri == r2.uri = r1 == r2 i.e. two resources are identical if they have the same URI. 
two resources with different URI's are different resources. 
I actually learned (not in school) that r1.uri == r2.uri = r1 = r2 but not the other way around so *each* uri denotes/identifies *a* resource but *a* resource could be denoted/identified by * (0 or more) uri's There is a set E of entities. 
Entities are things like web pages, numbers and trees in the park. 
[[[entity The information transferred as the payload of a request or response. 
An entity consists of metainformation in the form of entity-header fields and content in the form of an entity-body, as described in section 7. -- http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt 
There is a mapping D : R - E. i.e. there is mapping which maps resources to entities. 
There is a notion of equivalence. 
Two resources r1 and r2 can be mapped by D to the same entity. 
In that case we say they are equivalent. 
equiv(r1,r2) = D(r1) = D(r2) and finally: D((p,s,o)) = D(p)(D(s),D(o)) so the mapping of a triple resource is equivalent with ??? 
I present this, not because I claim it is correct, it doesn't deal with frag id's for example, but to suggest a language in which we can be clearer about what we mean. 
That's indeed very useful!

I think this is a mistake -- there are many pages which return the same entity (the same set of text) but we cannot assume from this that they have equivalent resources. 
To do so would be a grave mistake. 
The entity returned may vary over time while the resource stays the same. 
Just because at one point in time they return the same entity does not mean that they always will.

i have a page that is described by an URL. 
I change the page, the resource identification (the URL) remains the same, but the entity changes. 
OTH I have two pages that are identical (e.g. gutenberg.hwg.org &amp; www. 
hypermedic.com/gutenberg) but they are not the same resource.
