<s> WAI Interest Group: Please note that the User Agent Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 are currently undergoing last call review.  </s>
<s> The last call review period ends 13 November 2000.  </s>
<s> W3C welcomes review comments before that date, sent to w3c-wai-ua@w3.org .  </s>
<s> This review request may be forwarded to non-W3C organizations.  </s>
<s> These guidelines address accessibility of browsers, and other software that retrieves and renders Web content.  </s>
<s> They are one of the three complementary guidelines for Web accessibility produced by the W3C's Web Accessibility Initiative; the other two guidelines are the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0, and the Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines 1.0, both of which are W3C Recommendations.  </s>
<s> This last call draft addresses issues raised in a previous Proposed Recommendation version of this document.  </s>
<s> Additional information on this Last Call Review Request, and a copy of the formal last call notice, are available at Comments at the last call stage are most important towards stabilizing the document before it re-enters the Candidate Recommendation (if applicable) and the Proposed Recommendation stage.  </s>
<s> Please note also the request for implementation reports included in the formal Last Call review request.  </s>
<s> The User Agent Accessibility Guidelines Working Group (UAWG) has also published an updated version of the Techniques for User Agent Accessibility Guidelines on which the UAWG also welcomes comments at w3c-wai-ua@w3.org .  </s>

<s> Dear all, What all is there (if defined categories are there) in usability apart from accessability?  </s>

<s> Perhaps this is a bit too theoretical to be of much use, but I have thought of a possible compromise for using images to represent text.  </s>
<s> To designers, using style sheets is not a true substitute for using an image  </s>
<s> file to display text.  </s>
<s> And the reverse is true for HTML purists.  </s>
<s> So perhaps  </s>
<s> we could have the best of both worlds... Adding an attribute to the image tag could help define the image as text, which would still define the "meaning" of the piece of information such as: Browsers could display the image for this element if the user has images turned on, or could render the alternative being: This would be an improvement for accessibility and designers.  </s>
<s> Designers wouldn't have thier design destroyed if someone turns off images, and other users would be delivered more meaningful content.  </s>
<s> Just my $.02 -Ben Morris  </s>
<s> This should be done as follows: This already works in browsers like Lynx, but most graphical browsers keep an image placeholder of the same size as the image, and just use a default system font for rendering alt text.  </s>

<s> Two concepts have appeared repeatedly in discussions of this question.  </s>
<s> One concept is that it's not accessibility if the usability defect applies to all, and does not have a discriminatory effect on people with disabilities.  </s>
<s> The other concept has to do with differences in usability that make a task longer or harder to do, but do not materially decrease the likelihood of task completion.? In this circumstance, that is likely to provoke comments of "that's usability, not accessibility."?  </s>
<s> This creates a distinction between 'accessible' and "equal access."?  </s>
<s> It may take longer to roll your chair up the ramp than to run up the stairs, but that is the reasonable-accomodation balance point or tradeoff on access to buildings.  </s>
<s> It may help to think of usability as a _quantitative_ assessment of how _easy_ a task is, and accessibility as a _discrete_, discussion of cases and remedies where the easiness degrades to failure levels under person-with-disability condition.? Accessibility is in this view is metaphorically a special case of FRACAS - Failure Reporting and Corrective Action System.  </s>
<s> This gets sticky when dealing with cognitive issues, because cognition is deep in the human processing of the human:computer dialog, and the associated functional impairments tend to be diffuse and gradual, not as sharply localized in interaction phenomenology as those of sensory or actuation failure modes.  </s>

<s> Step past html:img and html:object to smil:switch.  </s>
<s> Then step back consider how it should work.  </s>
<s> Sketches of "it would be good if it worked like this" will be useful to the HTML Working Group as they consider how they re-baseline lots of things to use X-Link. the OBJECT element is high on their list.  </s>
<s> Son-of-OBJECT could well look something like what Ben is thinking.  </s>
<s> What if an IMG had a TITLE and DESCription, each of which was hypertext, with arbitrary markup captured within it, as a drawing subgroup (svg:g) now has in SVG?  </s>
