I don't know much about SVG but could it be used to produce the same output as UML? 
If it could, it could be possible to transform an SVG equivilent UML file to produce a descriptive "inturpretation" of the graphic. 
For example, I don't know the specifics but suppose SVG looked like this: ... same for other relationships This could be inturpreted descriptively as: Entity name comprises whatever entities, has these properties, data flows between entity name and whatever other entities and comes in from whatever entities... 
This specific example may not necessarily be appropriate for this list but the approach could generalize to handle any SVG representations? 
Am I dreaming again?

process_flow_diagram entity_box text_in_box Entity Name /text_in_box height h /height SVG isn't that high a level graphics language, it's more like an enhanced PDF; I'm sure Adobe see it as a PDF successor. 
It's main concession to accessibility is that, if you strip out all the tags, you are left with the text part of the image, but that assumes that people will actually use text for text and arrange it in a sensible order, and use spaces, not positioning, for word spaces (e.g. PDF authoing guidelines say do this, but it is rare in real life PDF). 
There is a document that lists other supposed accessibility design features, although my impression is that accessibility is a token requirement, albeit one that has had an impact on the structure. 
The main current interest in SVG seems to be as a Flash replacement, but I'm afraid it may become a replacement for HTML with the page pasted up in a fairly random order. 
There is a need for a static vector drawing language, as GIFs are not really the right format for line drawings, but very few questions on the SVG mailing list seem to assume that usage. 
width w /width The SVG philosophy (and I believe the SGML one) is that w here is an attribute, not text. 
There is an old (read unfashionable and not WYSIWYG) language for Unix, called PIC, which tries to do this sort of thing, although I've never used it. 
It's Adobe pushing SVG as Flash replacement. 
I guess it isn't just Adobe - they have the most heavily promoted SVG stuff (plugin, authoring and export in lots of products) as far as I can see, but BitFlash, the Apache project, IBM, Sun, Mozilla, Corel, Amaya, SodiPodi (another open source project), sketch (and another), and others are all producing editors and/or browsers. 
In addition Semantic Web tools such as RDF author and GraphViz are generating SVG output - it is useful because it can include representations of complex data in ways that are nice for people to read, and can include the bits that machines can read and process easily. 
Also you should look at the W3C Technical Reports page section on Working drafts - there are several profiles of SVG in development which are more basic than the full SVG 1.0 cheers Charles McCN They failed to catch up on Macromedia / Flash, and a whole web-animation market is leaded by Macromedia at a moment. 
It's a pity that there is no SVG-Core specification, which has only static objects (no animations, no sounds) and reasonable set of primitives - polygons, lines, beziers, circle, plus some set of gradient and standard fillings. 
Anyway, I doubt that SVG will be some replacement for HTML. 
First of all, SVG is well-formed XML, therefor browser supporting SVG should be able to parse XML as well. 
MS IE accepts a lot of broken HTML, but will report you an error on bad XML. 
If you have page designed in XML+CSS, than I doubt you need SVG unless you want to add something specific (circle, rotated rectangele, gradient, etc.) Problem is that web masters do not want (or don't know how) to design pages in XML+CSS. 
And 99.9% of all *real-world* pages (on Web) is not-valid HTML. 
:-(( That's true. 
I think SVG-Core is what we need in order to make SVG mainstream. 
It's really stupid to use 10MB "plugin" just to draw rectangle or circle on the web page. 
All browsers (absolute minimum: MS IE and Netscape) should support such primitives, and complete SVG specification is obviously too *fat* for this.

Vadim Plessky 33 Window Decorations and 6 Widget Styles for KDE KDE mini-Themes well, you're dreaming up the syntax, and when it was dreamed up in the SVG group it was slightly different. 
But the idea is the same... 
There is a box, which is called "the box", and it needs to be drawn the right size (and the right style) and labelled, and it is linked to a couple of other boxes... translates to something like metadata You can put anything you like in here really, including information about relationships /metadata You might like to look at the way we dealt with this in the SVG accessibility note, although at that time we were working from a version of the spec that required all metadata to be collected in one place, rather than being attached to all kinds of eleemnts as it is now. 
There we were desccribing how the pieces of a network were connected. 
This led to surther work on using RDF in SVG to describe other kinds of relationships, which I think is also a cool start, ubt perhaps overcomplicated - http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/ASVG/ with some discussion about further development starting at cheers Charles McCN I don't know much about SVG but could it be used to produce the same output as UML?

Location: 21 Mitchell street FOOTSCRAY Vic 3011, Australia (or W3C INRIA, Route des Lucioles, BP 93, 06902 Sophia Antipolis Cedex, France) MD I specifically said PC, not PDA - maybe I should have said "smaller than MD PC" instead of "tiny". 
This is why there is SVG Full, SVG Basic, and SVG Tiny - because there is more than one class of "less than PC" to consider. 
MD A scaled back spec definitely has its uses. 
I MD just think on PCs (running any OS) there should be support for the full MD SVG spec, ideally such that you can mix namespaces and have the SVG MD interact with XHTML with a minimum of proprietary techniques. 
I agree. 
MD [...] though Batik still lacks the dynamic MD functionality (they made their own pretty effective scaled-back spec in MD setting goals for their 1.0 release), In fact no, they picked the scaled-back conformance profile of "Static SVG" defined in the SVG 1.0 specification. 
MD and Croczilla is not very far along. 
Well that is a matter of perspective. 
I think it is doing nicely - particularly in the areas of multi-XML-namespae integration you mentioned above. 
And it is scriptable. 
I agree that it does not do filters etc yet. 
Chris mailto:chris@w3.org 
Probably I have made my statement not clear enough. 
I fully agree with you - many companies are contributing to SVG standards and developing of SVG tools. 
But I suggest that Adobe is the *only* company which needs to make from SVG "Flash replacement". 
And this explains why Macromedia is not in your list :-) Therefor, most of the companies you listed would be happy IMO with static SVG (or SVG Core, whatever you call it) At least that's very good for beginning. 
Than you can extend it to further level. 
BTW: What is also quite visible from your list is absence of Microsoft. 
What are in fact Microsoft plans concerning SVG? 
So far, MS bundles Macromedia Flash plugin with every copy of MS IE, and this just increases installed base of Flash players. 
I have conducted analysis of plugins available on desktops of different users. 
Flash is presnt almost on *any* desktop/browser, while SVG ... is not visible at all ! 
And I am speaking about auditory of computer-literate users, not newbies! 
It would be nice if Microsoft will bundle with MS IE either own or 3rd-party SVG plugin, as this increase SVG availability dramatically. 
But that hasn't happened so far. 
Thanks, I will look for more details on that page. 
I just downloaded SVG 1.0 specification as zip file, and was reading it. 
There is a more serious problem out there, though: it seems to me that Adobe is the only company which made SVG plugin available. 
Without wide availability of SVG plugins (or other form of SVG support), this wonderful specification/standard will fail (or go to niche markets) BR, Vadim Plessky 33 Window Decorations and 6 Widget Styles for KDE KDE mini-Themes [many interesting links...] I think for tiny devices a scaled back spec makes sense, but compared to the size of typical browsers and operating systems of Today there is nothing bloated about Adobe's SVG Viewer on a PC. 
Here you are wrong. 
Of course you can't make WinXP or Win98 more bloated by adding *just another 11MB*. 
But this size matters for Linux, and especillay for PDAs. 
How you will put extra 11MB, say, on Compaq iPAQ? 
Rather than put a crippled form of SVG in web browsers, perhaps Adobe should put a rudimentary XHTML browser/XSLT Processor into their SVG Viewer. 
Or make their SVG plugin open-sourced - than people with good coding knowledge will strip all fat from that plugin. 
:-)) Note that there are people who run Linux (or other OSes) on PowerPC, Alpha and other platforms, I know some people run KDE on IBM zSeries servers (previously known as mainframes) Adobe just can't catch up on all those platforms. 
And there is no SVG plugin from Adobe for those platforms. 
Abyway, about putting a rudimentary XHTML browser/XSLT Processor into SVG Viewer - this will not help in case of Adobe. 
I tested Adobe plugin for Linux with Mozilla 0.9.5. 
Mozilla is bloated by itselkd, takesa around 20 sec. 
to load here. 
And .. SVG plugin takes another 15 sec. 
to display page. 
Yes, you can get rid of Mozilla, it will save you 20 sec. 
But 15 sec. 
for startup is still enermous!.. Max Vadim Plessky 33 Window Decorations and 6 Widget Styles for KDE KDE mini-Themes Hi Ian! 
I believe you should use XML for this task and translate it to SVG later. 
Such approach is used, for example, in Kivio (flowcharting program from KOffice, www.koffice.org) 
Internal representation of Kivio data is in XML. 
At a moment, Kivio can't export exactly SVG - but exports drawings in other vector formats, like EPS. 
I guess it will be extended to support SVG for KOffice 1.2 release (somewhere spring 2002) I have heard that some people were using Kivio for UML modeling (or at least were trying to use it :-) No! :-) Vadim Plessky 33 Window Decorations and 6 Widget Styles for KDE KDE mini-Themes I note that they also don't bundle Acrobat and that Adobe is, to me, the apparent prime mover for SVG. 
I draw some conclusiions from that. 
This is why I tend to qualify reservations about SVG by "if it becomes widely adopted". 
I would go further than plugins and say that unless it is included directly in IE, or, at the very least, a reccommended update in Windows Update, it will not achieve general market penetration.

The Adobe Linux/Solaris releases were not production releases. 
There is also Batik and Croczilla that can browse SVG on Linux, for example, though Batik still lacks the dynamic functionality (they made their own pretty effective scaled-back spec in setting goals for their 1.0 release), and Croczilla is not very far along. 
Who knows what tool will be best to browse SVG on Linux? 
Whatever ends up filling this need I think it should support the full spec.

The SVG group is working on several profiules, for smaller kinds of devices that can't hold a full animated SVG viewer (and a static profile was already defined in SVG 1.0 - Batik is almost completely conformant to that). 
On the other side, Jon Ferraiolo, editor of the SVG specification and an Adobe SVG guy, was one of several SVG implementors who worked on the production of a document explaining requirements for a component extension framework, that would allow an SVG plugin to call an XHTML vrowser or XSLT processor as a plugin for included content. 
This is going to be more important as more types of content are used on teh Web - Math, music, chemical information, etc. http://www.w3.org/TR/cx 
It is my hope that this work will progress to a specification, and be implemented, to make the idea a useful reality. 
cheers Charles Apologies if I've not picked up something but it sounds like XML/XSLT + SVG (mixing in one "page"?) combination could be where browsers are heading? 
I was originally thinking that SVG could be an opportunity for the visually impared to possibly get some useful information from a graphical presentation? 
I know it's been said that it is not a Adobe replacement for Flash but if I use flash as an example then we are talking about something which is completely inaccessible correct? 
It obviously doesn't make sense to provide an actual alternative but if we could even get the information out then that would be an improvement? 
I recently came across 3 fantastic offers on books but they were in Flash and so completely useless to me. 
Is it possible or likely to be possible to say get the text from such a book if it were in SVG format? 
I'm concerned that we might be missing an opportunity to possibly define specific standards (as opposed to the general guildelines given in the SVG specification on Accessibility) before SVG becomes more commonly used? 
I'm getting the feeling that my fundatmental lack of understanding of exactly what SVG is and how it works may be letting me down so apologies if the above is simply rubbish!! But my concern is genuine.

Necessity to support PDF (Acrobat) is still questionable to me. 
PDF is not W3C standard/recommendation, and is based on PostScript which is good but aged technology.

Besides, missing PDF/PS support in Windows is not critical at all - as you can install GhostScript and it will do all this stuff for you. 
To prevent (possible) questions about Linux - GhostScript comes as standard with all major Linux distributions, and KDE/QT uses it for printing and "printing to PDF" (PDF generation) My major concern with Microsoft is SVG support. 
MS supports XML and (partially) CSS2, and there are even some CSS3 properties implemented. 
XHTML support is not listed among "available features" of MS IE, but so far it works ok. 
If MS is kind enough and can add SVG to MS IE - it would be great for everyone.

Of course it depends how it is used, so it is important that authors and tools follow approriate accessibility guidelines.
