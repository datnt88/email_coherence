Amaya should complain about the attached file, but it does not. 
The HTML validator at validator.w3.org does complain. 
I made the file in Amaya.

Hello Brant Thanks for your report. 
About the XHTML1.1 attributes "name" and "action" within an element form, I think Amaya should complain, I am verifying in the specs. 
About the character number 150 (x96), I'm not sure Amaya should complain. 
The document encoding is defined as iso-8859-1 and this character belongs to the Iso latin 1 table. 
Regards, Laurent Carcone Amaya team
