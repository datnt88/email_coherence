<s> Hi folks, I am trying to "tidy" (X)HTML fragments.  </s>
<s> The problem is that Tidy corrects them as documents, adding html, head and body tags etc.  </s>
<s> I tried to prevent this using the "input-xml" option, but this disables error correction.  </s>
<s> Is there a way to achieve fragment correction with tidy?  </s>
<s> Please CC me any answers, I am not subscribed.  </s>
<s> Thanks for your time.  </s>
<s> Kindest regards, Manos  </s>

<s> Also, if you use the --body-only yes option, you should get just your original fragment back, without the added html head /head body /body /html wrapper.  </s>
<s> You need the updated Tidy from SourceForge for this.  </s>
