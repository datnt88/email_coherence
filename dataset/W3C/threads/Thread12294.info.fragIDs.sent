<s> I have tried 3 time to call in - all circuits are busy message is all I get! Sounds like a Boston area phone problem.  </s>
<s> I'll try again in a few minutes to see if the circuits are available.  </s>
<s> I have a rough draft of an accessible template.  </s>
<s> Some things I wanted to discuss is the scope of the template: In priority order: 1. Must look good, sound good, Braille good, and print good: "Look good" means it looks good on Nav4, IE4, IE5, and Opera "Sound good" on IBM Home Page Reader and PW WebSpeak "Braille good" on JFW 3.5?  </s>
<s> on Windows w/Braille display "print good" means ?  </s>
<s> 2. Should pass BOBBY.  </s>
<s> 3. Should be valid code.  </s>

<s> sorry)  </s>
<s> Sorry that you had difficulty getting on.  </s>
<s> Several other people also reported problems.  </s>
<s> We will check with the administrator.  </s>
<s> Please send the rough draft for comment.  </s>
<s> My sense of the priorities is: should pass WCAG AAA which can be further verified by the tests you listed.  </s>
<s> Jutta  </s>
<s> Phill, we're finished now.  </s>
<s> I will investigate the bridge problems - seems that there have been a few poeple having them, so if anyone else can add symptoms to the information pool....  </s>
<s> Another possiblity for brailling is running on a line-mode browser.  </s>
<s> We could ask the WCAG and ERT groups to evaluate the templates for us, too.  </s>
<s> But I think the basic requirements seem sound.  </s>
<s> Note that passing Bobby has to be substantially human-tested, and really means being level-A (if I recall correctly - maybe it is double-A) compliant with WCAG.  </s>

<s> Was a short one - problems with the telephones.  </s>
<s> Minutes below - will be added to the site shortly Charles McCN WAI AU Teleconference - 1 March 2000 Details Chair: Jutta Treviranus Date: Wednesday 1 March 2000 Time: 4:00pm - 5:30pm Boston time (1900Z - 2030Z) Phone number: Tobin Bridge, +1 (617) 252 7000 Agenda The Latest Draft is the Recommendation dated 3 February, available at [4]http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/REC-ATAG10-20000203.  </s>
<s> * Review of work progress since [5]last meeting.  </s>
<s> Attendance * Charles McCathieNevile * Jutta Treviranus * Gregory Rosmaita * Jan Richards * William Loughborough * Dick Brown * Kynn Bartlett Regrets * Ian Jacobs Minutes CMN I did some stuff for 3.1 and some 3.2 which I haven't sent.  </s>
<s> There is a lot of redundancy in WCAG.  </s>
<s> Seems like a good approach, and we will end up with lots of stuff JT Redundancy in WCAG CMN In the checkpoints themselves - meeting one checkpoint often already meets several others need lots of cross-referencing JR I tried to stay away from the WCAG techniques CMN I have left in links ot WCAG techniques.  </s>
<s> Are people finding the length impossible?  </s>
<s> JR How many will we have?  </s>
<s> THere are 7 P-R checkpoints.  </s>
<s> Another apporach - I broke mine into different types of alternate content.  </s>
<s> * short descriptive * short function * longer description * metadata * alternate pages * etc For each of these I will leave references to WCAG, and some sample information.  </s>
<s> I had a heading called prompting - think about what the authoring tool needs to automate to get this done.  </s>
<s> GR I really liked the short functional text approach and emphasis on function rather than description.  </s>
<s> JR The difference can mean different types of information needs to be kept.  </s>
<s> CMN How do you find using WCAG JR I think it needs to be tightened up a lot, and that will mean changes CMN Yes.  </s>
<s> That will take time though - I think we will be able to keep up.  </s>
<s> JT The thing we want to get at is how to make sure you have done it in a tool JR There is a problem that you cannot use it as a step-by-step test - you have to go back to WCAG at that point, but they are not totally clear on everything that is needed.  </s>
<s> CMN Please take issues with WCAG to that working group.  </s>
<s> JR I think my text and Charles' can be complementary CMN It sounds like it would work as complementary (but I haven't read it yet.) JR I still have a lot of work to keep doing this.  </s>
<s> DB Heather Swayne is probably going to attend face to face, but no further news.  </s>
<s> WL First thing that came up is whether what Jan was talking about deals with authoring tools rather than the act of authoring.  </s>
<s> As to standing back one thing that comes up is whether the techniques document should be more than examples from the real world JT I think there need to be possible implementations as well.  </s>
<s> WL I started writing something of a long view as to how this fits into accessibility.  </s>
<s> GR I sent out some other techniques stuff.  </s>
<s> I have some stuff i have been working on - how do you want them?  </s>
<s> CMN Attach them or include them as a message to the list.  </s>
<s> JR What kind of templates GR Frameset, etc. JT I went over ERT document.  </s>
<s> It basicaly covers 4.1 and 4.2, and it also provides some material for 4.4 and 4.5.  </s>
<s> There are nice discussions about how to deal with author intervention.  </s>
<s> The question is how to incorporate it CMN Perhaps we just say this is the set of techniques, and link to it.  </s>
<s> JR I would agree with that.  </s>
<s> JT Yes, that would make sense.  </s>
<s> WL I am leaning to deferring lots of techniques to ERT. JT It can serve as pieces for 4.4 and 4.5, but for the rest we need text.  </s>
<s> CMN I think Bill's point about pointing to existing things is good - I would like to have a lot of them JT I think sample implementations are extremely important.  </s>
<s> CMN I would like to produce a new draft of the techniques in the next week, just so we can see if we are going in a sensible direction.  </s>
<s> So please put stuff up as proposals for pieces of the techniques document.  </s>
<s> GR Don't think I can get stuff up by Friday JR I will try to shape some stuff out but probably not friday DB Not just days.  </s>
<s> CMN How about Tuesday?  </s>
<s> /* should be able to have some of them as examples */ JT We will have some examples from courseware tools - that should be done by friday.  </s>
<s> We are going to need implementation test examples.  </s>
