<s> By the way, the Avalon Development Team has decided to discontinue development of Testlet in favor of the JUnit testing framework (see to use the JUnit option for Java.  </s>
<s> One small issue: - The nodeclonenodefalse test seems to fail because the expectedResult list contains two Strings, while the result list contains a String and an Integer.  </s>
<s> This could be fixed by removing the quotes for the second member of expectedResult ( member 0 /member ), but it could also be rewritten as indicated below.  </s>
<s> Original test: getElementsByTagName interface="Document" obj="doc" item interface="NodeList" obj="elementList" index="1" var="employeeNode"/ assertEquals actual="result" expected="expectedResult" Modified version: getElementsByTagName interface="Document" obj="doc" item interface="NodeList" obj="elementList" index="1" var="employeeNode"/ assertEquals actual="cloneName" expected="employee" assertEquals actual="length" expected="0" The modified version asserts that the nodeName is equal to "employee" and that the cloned node has no children without using two lists.  </s>
<s> Maybe the first version was easier to generate from the original tests, but I would prefer the modified version for new tests, because it is shorter.  </s>

<s> I got the test suite to build only 5 hours ago and ran out of steam before I trying to run it, and somebody replicates the build and runs it first.  </s>
<s> Using multiple asserts (as suggested) is definitely much preferred over building expected and results lists and then doing an assertEquals.  </s>
<s> With the multiple asserts, you will know which part failed.  </s>
<s> If there isn't some kind of iterative loop, then you shouldn't be using assertEquals(List,List) or assertEquals(Collection,Collection).  </s>
<s> However, when you do have an iterative loop, then those constructs are extremely useful.  </s>
<s> The pattern was inherited from the early NIST work which could only have one assert per test.  </s>
<s> While repairing some other issues, I did take the liberty of rewriting a few other places where assertEquals(Collection/List, Collection/List) were used, but I did not try to fix any others that compiled successfully.  </s>
<s> I had noticed the discontinuation of Avalon testlet development (announced 1 Aug, I believe) right after completing the Avalon testlet adapter.  </s>
<s> Definitely, JUnit was primary emphasis.  </s>
<s> I had done the Avalon Testlet since the Batik project were interested by the DOM test suite, but couldn't run Junit as part of their build process.  </s>
<s> I assume that Apache and JUnit have found some way to work with each others licenses.  </s>
<s> I apparently bungled the JUnit target when I added the Avalon code.  </s>
