I ran ARP against the test suite: lots of problems :( (21 failures) 1) rdf-charmod-uris/Manifest.rdf#error001 2) rdf-containers-syntax-vs-schema/Manifest.rdf#test006 3) rdf-ns-prefix-confusion/Manifest.rdf#test0002 4) rdfms-nested-bagIDs/Manifest.rdf#test001 5) rdfms-nested-bagIDs/Manifest.rdf#test002 6) rdfms-nested-bagIDs/Manifest.rdf#test003 7) rdfms-nested-bagIDs/Manifest.rdf#test004 8) rdfms-nested-bagIDs/Manifest.rdf#test005 9) rdfms-nested-bagIDs/Manifest.rdf#test006 10) rdfms-nested-bagIDs/Manifest.rdf#test008 11) rdfms-nested-bagIDs/Manifest.rdf#test009 12) rdfms-nested-bagIDs/Manifest.rdf#test010a 13) rdfms-nested-bagIDs/Manifest.rdf#test010b 
14) rdfms-nested-bagIDs/Manifest.rdf#test011a 15) rdfms-nested-bagIDs/Manifest.rdf#test011b 16) rdfms-nested-bagIDs/Manifest.rdf#test012a 17) rdfms-nested-bagIDs/Manifest.rdf#test012b 18) rdfms-not-id-and-resource-attr/Manifest.rdf#test003 19) rdfms-seq-representation/Manifest.rdf#test001 20) rdfms-syntax-incomplete/Manifest.rdf#test003 21) rdfms-xmllang/Manifest.rdf#test002 Of these 4 -17 are obsolete without looking. 1 is presumably an IRI that is not in NFC - now allowed, test is obsolete. 
2,3,18, 20 all have a bagID and should be obsolete 19 the ntriples file needs updating (no rdf:List) 21 the ntriples file needs updating (no lang tag on XMLLiteral) Hence I propose that the following tests should be obsoleted: 1) rdf-charmod-uris/Manifest.rdf#error001 2) rdf-containers-syntax-vs-schema/Manifest.rdf#test006 3) rdf-ns-prefix-confusion/Manifest.rdf#test0002 4) rdfms-nested-bagIDs/Manifest.rdf#test001 5) rdfms-nested-bagIDs/Manifest.rdf#test002 6) rdfms-nested-bagIDs/Manifest.rdf#test003 7) rdfms-nested-bagIDs/Manifest.rdf#test004 8) rdfms-nested-bagIDs/Manifest.rdf#test005 9) rdfms-nested-bagIDs/Manifest.rdf#test006 10) rdfms-nested-bagIDs/Manifest.rdf#test008 11) rdfms-nested-bagIDs/Manifest.rdf#test009 12) rdfms-nested-bagIDs/Manifest.rdf#test010a 13) rdfms-nested-bagIDs/Manifest.rdf#test010b 
14) rdfms-nested-bagIDs/Manifest.rdf#test011a 15) rdfms-nested-bagIDs/Manifest.rdf#test011b 16) rdfms-nested-bagIDs/Manifest.rdf#test012a 17) rdfms-nested-bagIDs/Manifest.rdf#test012b 18) rdfms-not-id-and-resource-attr/Manifest.rdf#test003 20) rdfms-syntax-incomplete/Manifest.rdf#test003 and to delete all the rdf:List triples in rdfms-seq-representation/test001.nt and to delete the @fr from rdfms-xmllang/test002.nt 
Given the time presssures why don't we agree this by e-mail? 
Jeremy That sounds good to me.

http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/ "No generalised law is without exception." 
A self-demonstrating axiom. 
These changes look right to me. 
I'd like DaveB to confirm, but suggest going ahead soon anyway. 
Brian On 24 Jul 2003 13:40:22 +0100 Yes, bagID 1 - yes, obsolete 2 - yes, obsolete 3 - is testing containers. 
The rdf:bagID could just be removed from the rdf:Bag and the N-Triples corrected. 
18 - yes, obsolete 20 - is testing rdf:nodeID on a rdf:Description. 
The rdf:bagID should be removed and the N-Triples corrected. 
yes yes all except 3 and 20 which need correcting. 
yes yes (This is by inspection, I've not machine tested this). 
Dave I have done the changes as suggested by Dave I have not rebuilt the mega manifest. 
I also obsoleted bagID 007 rdfms-nested-bagIDs/Manifest.rdf#test007 where at least the comment is not true. 
jjc: dave: I take that to be the other way round - I obsoleted 3 and changed 2. Jeremy jjc: oops I did not obsolete Have done so now, please rebuild the big Manifest and I think I will pass all the tests. 
Jeremy On Thu, 24 Jul 2003 17:54:14 +0300 I have just done this. 
Yes. 
I've checked all your changes in software now, I found a couple of problems: Jan or you missed one which I've just edited: rdfms-not-id-and-resource-attr/Manifest.rdf#test003 is now obsoleted Jeremy: You obsoleted rdf-charmod-literals/Manifest.rdf#test001 instead of rdf-charmod-literals/Manifest.rdf#error001 so I've corrected that. 
(plus I changed the wording in the comments on rdfms-xmllang/test002.rdf) 
The current state looks good.
