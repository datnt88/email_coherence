Sorry, if this has already been asked - I did not find it. 
What happens if the destination header of a COPY or MOVE (with overwrite) identifies a resource with a DAV:checked-in property or a version resource? 
Are not preconditions like DAV:cannot-modify-version-controlled-content and DAV:cannot-modify-version (see: 3.10) missing in 3.14 and 3.15? 
Thanks, Peter

These are four different questions: COPY/overwrite to a DAV:checked-in VCR is just like a PUT to a DAV:checked-in VCR. 
It will succeed if DAV:auto-version is set appropriately, and fail otherwise (see Section 3.14) For a MOVE/overwrite to a DAV:checked-in VCR, the fact that it 
is a DAV:checked-in VCR is irrelevant ... what matters is whether the collection containing it allows you to remove and add members. 
If that collection is version-controlled, then section 14.7 applies. 
COPY/overwrite to a version always fails. 
This is stated in the definition of a "version resource" in section 1.3: "The content and dead properties of a version never change." 
I agree that it would have been reasonable to have a DAV:cannot-modify-version precondition on COPY for this case. 
MOVE/overwrite to a version always fails. 
This is stated in the definition of a "version resource" in section 1.3: "The server allocates a distinct new URL for each new version, and this URL will never be used to identify any resource other than that version." 
I agree that it would have been reasonable to have a DAV:cannot-modify-version precondition on MOVE for this case.

I agree that would make it quite clear.
