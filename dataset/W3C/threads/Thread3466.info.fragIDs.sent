<s> During the meeting we said it would be a good idea to start collecting terms for a glossary, and I think I might have said that I'd pull an initial document together.  </s>
<s> I hope I wasn't too hasty, and I just wanted to offer someone else the opportunity to do that if they were keen.  </s>
<s> Cheers, RI Richard Ishida W3C  </s>
<s> At the bottom of my guidelines page I list a few glossaries: Sun's, IETF, Unicode, and Microsoft.  </s>
<s> Microsoft's glossaries are their translation glossaries no English definitions.  </s>
<s> The others have explanations.  </s>
<s> Of them, we would probably find Unicode's most useful and the definitions most agreeable, although many are lacking and some are circular.  </s>
<s> Basic Multilingual Plane points you to BMP and BMP goes back to the former.  </s>
<s> You have to look at some other terms beginning with BMP to find the meaning.  </s>
<s> The nice thing about Unicode is there are URL's to each individual definition so you can link directly there.  </s>
<s> Creating a good glossary is a great deal of work.  </s>
<s> I wouldn't mind housing and managing a glossary page, but pulling such a beast together is not a one man job... tex  </s>

<s> I guess a constructive suggestion would be for us to work with Unicode to improve their glossary for charset, encoding, etc. related terminology, to work with WAI and others in the w3c on markup related terminology, and we can maintain a SMALL list of i18n, l10n related terms that are not covered in the markup and encoding spaces, unless we can identify another QUALITY resource for the remainder.  </s>
<s> i18ngurus has a few more glossaries- microsoft, ICU, mozilla  </s>
