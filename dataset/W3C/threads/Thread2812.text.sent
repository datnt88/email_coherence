In section 4.4 "Message Length", does the statement "If a Content-Length header field (section 14.13) is present, its decimal value in OCTETs represents both the entity-length and the transfer-length. 
The Content-Length header field MUST NOT be used if these two lengths are different (i.e., if a Transfer-Encoding header field is present)." 
mean that a receiver should ignore Content-Length, or a sender should not send it?

It means that the sender should not send it in the case of a transfer encoded message, since the transfer-length is otherwise encoded and would result in a contradiction in the lenth. 
I don't see an obvious rewrite to make this more obvious. 
Unless there is some concrete suggestion, I plan to leave this one alone. 
This is one of the parts of HTTP that shows the problems with trying to mush message lengths into the same layer as the semantics of the message. 
Ugh... Always makes me sick to my stomach to look at this part of HTTP. - Jim - Jim It means that the sender should not send it in the case of a transfer encoded message, since the transfer-length is otherwise encoded and would result in a contradiction in the lenth.

"Use the Robustness Principle, Luke!" It means both: it means that the sender MUST NOT send it and that (in the event of a non-compliant sender) the receiver MUST ignore it. 
I agree that the verb here ("be used") is fuzzy. 
So how about: If a Content-Length header field (section 14.13) is present, its decimal value in OCTETs represents both the entity-length and the transfer-length. 
The Content-Length header field MUST NOT be sent if these two lengths are different (i.e., if a Transfer-Encoding header field is present). 
If a message is received with both a Transfer-Encoding header field and a Content-Length header field, the latter MUST be ignored. 
Maybe a little more rigid than formally necessary, but I think we need to take a strong stand against non-compliance in this area (as we did with the Host header), or else we could end up in a bad mess.
