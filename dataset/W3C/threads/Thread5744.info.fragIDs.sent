In the current working draft an example of perform is given (see below). 
informationType="purchaseOrder" role="Retailer"/ this variable "cdl:getVariable(tns:purchaseOrder, 
tns:Retailer)"/ free variable="cdl:getVariable(tns:purchaseOrder, rwns:Retailer)"/ The definition for perform in the same working draft is: /alias + My issue is that the example has no "role" associated with the this and free elements and yet the definition requires it. 
A further problem is that the definition for the perform includes a "name" attribute in the alias element. 
This is missing in the example. 
I would like to get this entire issue related to perform sorted out as soon as possible as it is now holding me up in coding up the TWIST example.

Steve, good catch: The example for the perform in the current WD is wrong: The 2 roles and the alias name are required to be stated in the example. 
We (editors) will fix this. 
Greg can you add this item to the editors todo list?
