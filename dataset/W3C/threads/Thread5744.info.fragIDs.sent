<s> A further problem is that the definition for the perform includes a "name" attribute in the alias element.  </s>
<s> This is missing in the example.  </s>
<s> I would like to get this entire issue related to perform sorted out as soon as possible as it is now holding me up in coding up the TWIST example.  </s>

<s> Steve, good catch: The example for the perform in the current WD is wrong: The 2 roles and the alias name are required to be stated in the example.  </s>
<s> We (editors) will fix this.  </s>
<s> Greg can you add this item to the editors todo list?  </s>
