<s> * Although since my last post, I've had a report that vnd registration with IANA is also quite slow and unpredictable...  </s>

<s> I personally hate the vnd and prs trees -- it promulgates the same failed design as the x- prefixes.  </s>
<s> A reversed dns prefix would at least have made some sense.  </s>

<s> barring that an xml tree (application/xml.soap) which could either be assigned to the W3C or at least incorporate the W3C process.  </s>
<s> That would, of course, require an RFC to set up.  </s>
<s> The +xml suffix seems to beg for the most delays.  </s>
<s> I haven't heard anything like that -- the Apache mime.types file is growing at an alarming rate, mostly due to vnd types.  </s>

<s> Aha; interesting you mention that.  </s>
<s> I have an I-D written and ready to go for it, but have been holding off because of mixed private feedback.  </s>
<s> Do you *like* this approach, or just dislike it less than vnd/prs?  </s>
<s> One suggestion I've heard is to have an xml media type registration that allows an attribute to describes either an opaque intent URI or the namespace URI of the top-level element; e.g., application/nsxml;ns="http://www.w3.org/..." (the alternative is to change application/xml itself, but that would be more difficult process-wise) The problem that I see with this approach is that some (most?) MIME dispatchers can't do anything with parameters, as explained in the appendix of 3023.  </s>
<s> Still would be interesting to have the alternative, though.  </s>

<s> I'm not sure what Roy means by "namespace control of W3C" here, and would appreciate clarification.  </s>
<s> He may be suggesting that no MIME content types beyond application/xml are needed for XML documents, as XML processors can use namespace information to differentiate which application should get which chunk of XML information, and additional information in the MIME content type would be superfluous.  </s>
<s> While I disagree with this view in the current circumstances, it is certainly coherent - but under no one's control in particular.  </s>
<s> I'm not sure what the W3C would want to add to the current namespace process, but suspect that "control" would go over badly with the many organizations beyond the W3C which are in the business of creating XML vocabularies for public use.  </s>
<s> As for this:  </s>
<s> It is my understanding that the W3C itself is unwilling to manage directly any kind of kind of registration system, and that URIs are supposed to resolve these kinds of problems without the need for centralized control.  </s>
<s> To me as well.  </s>
<s> I would offer that there is little technical difference between application/vnd.w3c.*+xml and application/*.xml  </s>
<s> However, there are major practical issues.  </s>
<s> First, for there to be ANY value to the registration, there needs to be a registrar.  </s>
<s> Otherwise, there is no likelihood of interoperation.  </s>
<s> Second, since the registration would be in the vnd tree, it is up to the W3C to maintain, publish, and control the registry.  </s>
<s> That is a problem (beyond the organizational problem of the W3C maintaining a registry) in that Joe Random programmer somehow needs to know to look someplace in the W3C for what registration to use or what a particular value means.  </s>
<s> Third, one could easily envision someone in the IETF publishing application/mumble+xml and someone in the W3C publishing application/vnd.w3c.mumble+xml, where they have totally different semantics.  </s>
<s> Yes, that is theoretically OK, because they are, by definition, different registrations.  </s>
<s> However, most people expect a mumble to be a mumble... Fourth, and conversely to the third, one could envision someone in the W3C publishing application/vnd.w3c.foo+xml.  </s>
<s> Later on, it becomes of value to everyone, so it would make sense registering application/foo+xml in the IETF tree.  </s>
<s> However, we then end up with two registrations for the same thing.  </s>
<s> On a separate topic, I would strongly suggest AGAINST putting everything under application/xml.  </s>
<s> One of the whole points of the MIME type system is that a user agent can make intelligent choices about objects WITHOUT examining the object itself.  </s>
<s> If we went the application/xml route, user agents would have to parse the XML to figure out the namespaces, for example.  </s>
<s> That can be an undue burden on applications.  </s>
