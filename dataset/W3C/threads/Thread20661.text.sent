MathML has a large number of character entities for many operators. 
Amaya could help authors by providing several pallettes preloaded with a selection of operators organized in 'reasonable' groupings , for example calculus , statistics, logic , geometry , etc And even better would be a couple of blank 'user' pallettes that an author could populate either by dragging or cut/paste from an existing one or defining a glyph by entering the entity name. 
This would let author 'customize' the pallette to the current project. 
Additional pallettes would ease the learning curve for math authors who are new to MathML.

Do you list these project proposals somewhere? 
Do you encourage non-local Universities to take these up for their students? 
I expect students would be keen to have "I did a project for the W3C" on their CV.... Hugh We have a Web page in French for our French students: but I can provide an English version on the W3C server Yes, please. 
I will add a link to it from my projects page (most of which are of little interest to this list). 
We get French students here too, so I'll link to that page as well. 
Of course yes. 
I don't know if I will get much takeup, but the more people who link the higher Google will rank your page :-) Hugh We have a Web page in French for our French students: but I can provide an English version on the W3C server Of course yes.
