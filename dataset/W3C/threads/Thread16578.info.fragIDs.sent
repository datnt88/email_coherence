<s> I gather that it proved impossible to have a feature of "rewrapping" the unwrapped page and changing the menu item accordingly.  </s>
<s> I think that the "search" selection in the navbar could be the exception to conforming to the others' compliance with the notion of staying on the page with a navbar selection.  </s>
<s> I think "search" is clearly a certain function and that the current plan makes one do two clicks to get to the entry field of the search.  </s>
<s> Love.  </s>
<s> ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE  </s>
<s> I gather that it proved impossible to have a feature of "rewrapping" the unwrapped page and changing the menu item accordingly.  </s>
<s> I agree with this; if you can "untable" something you should be able to "retable" it.  </s>
<s> Likely this would require a programming fix to the script which does the unwrapping.  </s>
<s> The term "unwrap" is unfamiliar to me, as applied to tables; I don't recall seeing this before.  </s>
<s> This may be confusing to users, and especially note: "Tables" is geekspeak; it's an HTML tag.  </s>
<s> _Users_ (who are not web developers) will think in terms of "columns" not of "tables."  </s>
<s> Of course, you don't "unwrap" columns, so that word will have to go as well.  </s>
<s> Instead, how about "Single Column Layout" or something similar?  </s>
<s> I think that the "search" selection in the navbar could be the exception to conforming to the others' compliance with the notion of staying on the page with a navbar selection.  </s>
<s> I think "search" is clearly a certain function and that the current plan makes one do two clicks to get to the entry field of the search.  </s>
<s> In fact, I'd go so far as to say that instead of the first "Search" link, there should be a (properly labeled) input box and a submit button to allow searching right from the top page, instead of requiring multiple clicks until a search can be started.  </s>
<s> (I feel this is a must-have for the top page, and a "would be nice" for subsequent pages on the site.)  </s>
