I gather that it proved impossible to have a feature of "rewrapping" the unwrapped page and changing the menu item accordingly. 
I think that the "search" selection in the navbar could be the exception to conforming to the others' compliance with the notion of staying on the page with a navbar selection. 
I think "search" is clearly a certain function and that the current plan makes one do two clicks to get to the entry field of the search. 
Love. 
ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE 
I gather that it proved impossible to have a feature of "rewrapping" the unwrapped page and changing the menu item accordingly. 
I agree with this; if you can "untable" something you should be able to "retable" it. 
Likely this would require a programming fix to the script which does the unwrapping. 
The term "unwrap" is unfamiliar to me, as applied to tables; I don't recall seeing this before. 
This may be confusing to users, and especially note: "Tables" is geekspeak; it's an HTML tag. 
_Users_ (who are not web developers) will think in terms of "columns" not of "tables." 
Of course, you don't "unwrap" columns, so that word will have to go as well. 
Instead, how about "Single Column Layout" or something similar? 
I think that the "search" selection in the navbar could be the exception to conforming to the others' compliance with the notion of staying on the page with a navbar selection. 
I think "search" is clearly a certain function and that the current plan makes one do two clicks to get to the entry field of the search. 
In fact, I'd go so far as to say that instead of the first "Search" link, there should be a (properly labeled) input box and a submit button to allow searching right from the top page, instead of requiring multiple clicks until a search can be started. 
(I feel this is a must-have for the top page, and a "would be nice" for subsequent pages on the site.)
