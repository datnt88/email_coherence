<s> By the way: a slightly updated safe internet draft was submitted yesterday.  </s>
<s> See for a copy.  </s>
<s> The main new message in the draft is: we have to solve the `unnecessary confirmation dialog' problem, and work on other solutions being absent, we have to solve it with the Safe header.  </s>
<s> I put this message in the draft because I won't be there to say it in person.  </s>
<s> Koen.  </s>
<s> Larry, Due to the amount of information that needs to be presented at the Monday morning Opening Plenary, the first working group session will not start until 10:00 so it will only be a 1-1/2 hour session.  </s>
<s> You may want to adjust your agenda to reflect this.  </s>
