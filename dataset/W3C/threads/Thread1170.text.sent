Charset name: CESU-8 Charset aliases: csCESU-8 Suitability for use in MIME text: No Published specification(s): Unicode Technical Report #26 "Compatibility Encoding Scheme for UTF-16: 8-bit (CESU-8)" ISO 10646 equivalency table: See specification. 
Additional information: CESU-8 is an 8-bit Compatibility Encoding Scheme for UTF-16 (CESU) that is intended for internal use within systems processing Unicode in order to provide an ASCII-compatible 8-bit encoding that is similar to UTF-8 but preserves UTF-16 binary collation. 
Data encoded in CESU-8 should only be exchanged when it is labeled as such in a higher-level protocol or is agreed upon in an API definition.

Intended usage: LIMITED USE The summary in that TR says: This document specifies an 8-bit Compatibility Encoding Scheme for UTF-16 (CESU) that is intended for internal use within systems processing Unicode in order to provide an ASCII-compatible 8-bit encoding that is similar to UTF-8 but preserves UTF-16 binary collation. 
It is not intended nor recommended as an encoding used for open information exchange. 
The Unicode Consortium, does not encourage the use of CESU-8, but does recognize the existence of data in this encoding and supplies this technical report to clearly define the format and to distinguish it from UTF-8. 
This encoding does not replace or amend the definition of UTF-8. 
The statement "It is not intended nor recommended as an encoding used for open information exchange." is underlined in the TR for emphasis. 
Charset labels are used for exchanging information. 
Thus, CESU-8 is *not* a candidate for having a charset label. 
--Paul Hoffman, Director --Internet Mail Consortium The proposal clearly states that CESU-8 is not for common use, both in the description provided and in the Intended Usage block. 
It can however be used between consenting and supporting systems when appropriately tagged as CESU-8 in a higher-level protocol. 
This also is stated in the DUTR. 
MIME types are just one of the higher level protocols for describing the encodings, although in the case of CESU-8 the registration also states that it is unsuitable for use as a MINE type. 
IANA registration is important to CESU-8 as it will be (is) in systems from several large software vendors, and IANA registered charsets are frequently used within products to provide a canonical and vendor-neutral name for a character set used within code, file descriptions etc. Nothing in RFC 2278 requires that the character set registered is in common use or suitable for open common interchange.

Subject: Re: Registration of new charset CESU-8 03/01/2002 05:01 AM The summary in that TR says: The statement "It is not intended nor recommended as an encoding used for open information exchange." is underlined in the TR for emphasis. 
Charset labels are used for exchanging information. 
Thus, CESU-8 is *not* a candidate for having a charset label. 
--Paul Hoffman, Director --Internet Mail Consortium The more important problem, from the point of view of the Unicode Consortium at this point, is that the "TR" is not yet an approved TR. 
It is a Draft Unicode Technical Report, available for public review, but not yet finally approved. 
I quote from the status section: "This is a draft document which may be updated, replaced, or superseded by other documents at any time. 
This is not a stable document; it is inappropriate to cite this document as other than a work in progress." 
So while it may be appropriate for Toby to start a registration on the basis of the current definition, I don't think it would be appropriate to actually approve and post a registration for "CESU-8" until the DUTR #26 is actually approved by the UTC and posted as a final UTR #26 -- at which point the document becomes stable and referenceable. 
--Ken Two wishes for this registration: 1) Quote verbatim the text from DUTR#26: "It is not intended nor recommended as an encoding used for open information exchange." 
2) Specify that the registration refers to the Draft UTR dated 2001-12-12, and is intended to be updated to refer to the final UTR when that document is available. 
I don't think that we need to wait for final publication before registering the charset label. 
If the definition changes before final publication, and the final one has to be CESU-8v2, that is a risk the registrant takes.
