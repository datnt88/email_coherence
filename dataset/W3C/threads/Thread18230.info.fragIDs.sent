Working Group, I would just like to congradulate all the working group members, past and present, who have helped in developing the user agent guidelines and bring them to this point. 
We have reached an important milestone in going to proposed recommendation and look foreward to your continued contributions in moving the document to a recommendation. 
I would like to offer a special thank you and congradulations to Ian Jacobs our staff contact for all his hard work and insights in editing the UA documents and for his skills in guiding us through the W3C recommendation process.
