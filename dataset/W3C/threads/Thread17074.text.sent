I wonder out loud: Will it be cross platform compatible (ie: PC, Mac, Linux, etc.)? 
Shows promise, but I suspect it will always be a band-aid solution. 
I wonder too if the software app will impart the structural logic required to navigate a long document properly - even PDFs can have "bookmarks" (named anchors) in them; will this functionality be carried through? 
I would be curious to see the application in play - how does it work with other adaptive technologies (ie, can it peacefully co-exist with other screen reading apps like Jaws?) Also, how does it deal with images, charts and graphs, etc. in PDFs? 
What will the business model be - a free plug-in or a purchase add-on/software app.? (Affordability is an accessibility issue too) Many, many questions... JF What gives me the jitters about these types of solutions is that they depend on the existance on ones apparatus of data retrieval of capabilities that by and large, do not exist in many envoironments and even if they exist, their use is precluded by barriers. 
The device independant model is the way to go here and anything else falls way short of the mark. 
These are looked at as regulation compliance solutions when they are not. 
It is difficult to persuade some already for instance that narrator is not a screen reader.
