<s> Dear Jim,  </s>
<s> I haven't used the suite myself, but I know that they are currently implementing accessible elements into their courses, as documented on their website.  </s>
<s> It is apparent that they are working with WebAIM and Equal Access to Software and Information (EASI) to ensure that those with disabilities to use this product.  </s>
<s> Perhaps you could email these people to find out more - although I am sure that WebAIM are on this list(?)  </s>
<s> Sorry that I cannot help you any further on the product, but a quick review of their site seems to show that it is at least accessible to a degree.  </s>
<s> Further testing would be required - something I would love to help with but unfortunately I have no time this week.  </s>
<s> Do let me know if you would like me to perform the usual tests in the coming days and pass on the information to you.  </s>

<s> Hi Simon and Jim  </s>
<s> EASI have a WebCast of an interview Norm Coombs and Dick Banks conducted with Reidy Brown who is the Senior Software Engineer and Accessibility Co-ordinator for Blackboard.  </s>
<s> In that interview Reidy states that there have been major improvements to the accessibility of Blackboard in its latest 5.5 release.  </s>
<s> However, he acknowledges that some sections of Blackboard are still not fully accessible (whiteboard and chat room) as they are licensed to third-party companies and Blackboard does not have the ability to change the source code.  </s>
<s> I gather they are still trying to address this problem.  </s>
<s> So I think the message is that Blackboard is committed to accessibility but their e-learning environment is not yet fully accessible.  </s>
<s> You could email Norm (nrcgsh@ritvax.isc.rit.edu) or Dick (dick@easi.cc) to arrange to listen to the WebCast with Reidy and/or ask for his contact details.  </s>
<s> Simon I'd be interested in your assessment of Blackboard and any other e-learning platforms.  </s>
<s> I am investigating the various commercial platforms currently available and have recently emailed WebCT for details about their accessibility initiatives and future plans.  </s>
<s> If anyone has any experience with any of these or other e-learning platforms I'd appreciate further information from you.  </s>

<s> Hi, actual assessment of stuff, or compiling information and publishing it, sounds like a good idea nearly all the time.  </s>
<s> PLease note that in the case of "learning support systems", or "courseware", or "tools that let you do the things that the web lets you do, but all come in one box and get sold to universities along with support" there are reviews done by the Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines group http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU as part of the implementation reviews they do - this is an important group of authoring tools.  </s>

<s> Thanks for this Charles.  </s>
<s> I think it may be best to complement the work of the Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines group.  </s>
<s> We could do this in the following ways: 1. Contributing to the existing reviews already completed by the group (ie Blackboard 5.5, Domino 5.02a, Prometheus 5.08 and WebCT 3.6) by sending further information, comments etc to the reviewer for inclusion when the reviews are updated.  </s>
<s> 2. Suggesting courseware that needs to be reviewed and is not yet included on the list.  </s>
<s> There are procedures outlined on the site about how to go about this.  </s>
<s> However, Charles, what is not clear, is when the reviews are completed.  </s>
<s> I note there are several packages listed for review but no review links exist.  </s>
<s> I presume that means a review has not yet been completed?  </s>
<s> At the moment the reviews are limited in so far as only four products have been reviewed.  </s>
<s> 3. Submitting reviews (using the draft template document which can be supplied)of courseware not yet listed or reviewed.  </s>
<s> Al, I think this would provide the most efficient means for ensuring consistency in the reviews, adding to the limited list of reviewed packages currently on the site and providing a more effective means for dissemination of the findings.  </s>
<s> Are there any volunteers to contribute to existing reviews based on experiences using the courseware, suggesting additional courseware for review and conducting reviews of courseware not yet evaluated by the Working group?  </s>
<s> BTW, the ATAG pages provide a link to Ocotillo Central which lists the URLs of reviews of many courseware applications: http://www.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/ocotillo/courseware/compare.html  </s>

<s> Sorry to jump in a little late on this question, but for what it's worth...  </s>
<s> In a project with a local community college, I have been working to provide  </s>
<s> Blackboard-based on-line courses to students with disabilites.  </s>
<s> In a  </s>
<s> nutshell, the accessibility of the Blackboard 5.5 system has been extremely  </s>
<s> disappointing.  </s>
<s> Of six blind students who began the course this January, all but two have dropped because of the extreme difficulties they found in  </s>
<s> attempting to use Blackboard with a screen reader.  </s>
<s> (The remaining two are having to rely heavily on sighted assistance to continue.) In addition to the Blackboard-acknowledged issues of the inaccessible third-party chat and whiteboard application, we have run into a frustrating array of accessibility issues throughout the system, for example: (1) A complex, frames-based layout with frames that are ambiguously named/titled.  </s>
<s> (Additionally, the deeply nested framesets appear to be invalid and intermittently cause the screen reader to lose focus (JAWS 4) or fail to render the page (HPR 3.02).) (2) System-generated forms-based quizzes that do not use label tags and use layouts that are extremely cumbersome to operate with a screen reader.  </s>
<s> (The "matching" question construct is impossible to use, and we have had to direct instructors to avoid it completely.  </s>
<s> Students had to be trained on a work around for true/false and multiple choice question types.) (3) System-generated content (e.g. announcement of content or quiz posting) that uses ambiguous and/or repeated link text (e.g. "click here" and system generated/modified filenames) making it useless for screen reader users to "tab" from link to link or use screen reader "link list" utilities.  </s>
<s> (We were able to help instructors to manually re-name the system generated links whenever possible.) (4) Missing alt text on image links in some (admittedly rare) occasions and regular use of unnecessarily redundant alt text on purely decorative images (e.g. "announcement icon" on the every single image used for a bullet in a pseudo- bulleted list of course announcements).  </s>
<s> (5) Use of images of text in navigation/header menus that hinder the effectiveness of "high contrast" display settings for students with low vision.  </s>
<s> (6) A content posting system that appears to cater to and foster the use of non-HTML content, i.e. Word and Power Point documents.  </s>
<s> (A large part of our initial task was assisting instructors to convert all their Word and Power Point-based content to accessible HTML documents.  </s>
<s> However Blackboard's document posting process made the posting of HTML documents, especially those with links to other internal documents/files, far more difficult than posting Word or PPT files.) In Blackboard's defense, I will admit that it is unclear how much the local implementation of the system may or may not have contributed to the accessibility problems we've found.  </s>
<s> (If anyone has had more positive experience with a Blackboard system that might suggest that our experiences are not typical, I would be very eager to hear about them.)  </s>
<s> However, it was especially disappointing to find Blackboard (the company) largely unresponsive in addressing these issues when we brought them to their attention.  </s>
<s> As part of the project (funded by a US Dept of Labor grant), we will be writing a thourough findings report including our experiences with Blackboard -- I'll be happy to share it when it is completed.  </s>

<s> Carol Foster, Web Developer University of Massachusetts, President's Office  </s>
<s> Greg Ritter of Blackboard just gave a presentation on the current and future accessibility status of Blackboard yesterday at the CSUN Conference in Los Angeles.  </s>
<s> You can read a synopsis at WebAIM has provided Blackboard with some consulting, training, and evaluation services, as has EASI, and Blackboard is involved with the SALT project, which helps to set standards for accessibility of educational content.  </s>
<s> This doesn't mean that the accessibility of the product has been perfect, as explained in the conference presentation, but it does mean that they are making an effort and are on the right track.  </s>
<s> Your feedback of specific points is useful as constructive criticism to their developers.  </s>
<s> It's always good to have external evaluators of products such as this.  </s>
<s> It raises the bar in terms of customer satisfaction.  </s>
<s> I would encourage you to pass on the results of your more formal study to the Blackboard developers (see the conference link above for contact info).  </s>
<s> Blackboard has prepared accessibility information on their product at http://access.blackboard.com.  </s>
<s> One of the most useful features of this site is the Blackboard screen reader tutorial.  </s>
<s> During testing, it was found that user orientation was one of the biggest accessibility problems, so the document was created to help screen readers orient themselves within the program.  </s>
<s> It's true that it would be better if the orientation problems didn't occur in the first place, but for current users of the product, this may be useful still.  </s>
<s> Greg explained some of the improvements that are in the forthcoming Blackboard 6.0.  </s>
<s> They have simplified the interface and have created an entirely new chat/whiteboard program from scratch.  </s>
<s> I haven't yet been able to use it, but the intent was to design it with accessibility in mind.  </s>
<s> Hopefully it will fulfill that design goal.  </s>
<s> Although it often takes longer to convince corporate entities of the need for accessibility, many of them are making strides in the right direction.  </s>
<s> There's nothing wrong with pointing out their shortcomings.  </s>
<s> There is nothing wrong with praising them for their successes either.  </s>
<s> Paul Bohman  </s>

<s> Thanks Paul.  </s>
<s> I'll definitely check out the proceedings for the Blackboard 6 presentation.  </s>
<s> It's good to hear that improvements may be in the works.  </s>
<s> We have used the Blackboard screen reader tutorial (http://products.blackboard.com/cp/bb5/access/screen_reader_tutorial.htm) in training our blind students on the necessary workarounds.  </s>
<s> Unfortunately, the problems we've had with JAWS losing it's place in the deeply nested framesets (or HPR failing to render the pages) has limited the tutorial's usefulness.  </s>
<s> (Freedom Scientific hasn't been much help on this one either...) Point well taken on the need to continue to be constructive in providing criticism, and to provide credit where it is due.  </s>
<s> We will definitely share our final findings report with Blackboard in hopes that it may be useful in improving accessibility in future releases.  </s>
<s> Mike p.s. If anyone has had opportunity to test Blackboard with Window-Eyes, I'd be interested to hear your results...  </s>

<s> Except that their definition of accessibility is "does it have a text-only interface" - there is nothing mentioned about whether there is support for authors to create content that is accessible, or whether anything more sophisticated than a text-only interface (for example the use of text equivalents for functions and images provided) is available.  </s>

<s> Sincerely Denise  </s>
<s> Charles Your comment about the definition of accessibility only referring to the option of a text-only interface does not apply to all of the reviews at this site.  </s>
<s> If you look at the review of WebCT 3.7 for example, you will see this description under the title accessibility: WebCT has optimized accessibility for the following assistive technologies: Screen reader software: JAWS 4; Browser: Internet Explorer 5.5 SP2; Operating system: Windows 2000.  </s>
<s> Both Chat and Whiteboard are navigable by keyboard.  </s>
<s> New color scheme provides high contrast between background and foreground elements.  </s>
<s> The high contrast color scheme can be the default or overridden by users.  </s>
<s> Invisible navigation links can be used by screen readers.  </s>
<s> My point was that the review of Blackboard was weak - not containing the detail of some of the other reviews listed on the site.  </s>
<s> Your observation re the lack of detail about accessibility features certainly applies to the review of Blackboard.  </s>
<s> Having said that there are still many accessibility features not mentioned even in the WebCT review.  </s>
<s> I intend emailing the author (Bruce Landon) and suggesting the Blackboard review be updated.  </s>
<s> I will also raise the concern that there is lack of consistency in the review of accessibility features and that there is a need to address at least the priority 1 level checkpoints in such a review.  </s>
<s> You are right Charles - it is a good start and worth encouraging the author to develop further.  </s>
