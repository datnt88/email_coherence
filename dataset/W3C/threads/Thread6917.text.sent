Can you tell me what parameters make it okay to drop the www when entering a URI into a browser? 
Does it have to do with the browser and/or its level? 
Does it have to do with how domain names are registered? 
Any input would be most helpful. 
Regards, Linda Bellitt Linda Bellitt (by way of Martin Duerst duerst@w3.org ) I'm not sure what you mean, but I assume the question is when it is OK to enter an URI like: as opposed to: The answer is that this is based on the DNS records of the domain name. 
When you register a domain name, you provide two (or more) DNS servers which are used to lookup various machines on that domain (www.domain.com, 
ftp.domain.com, 
etc.). 
The effect of dropping the "www" is dependent on the DNS records that exist for that domain.

] One could think of the "www" node in the same way mail servers are often named "mail.foo.com", nameservers are "dns.foo.com", etc. 
It's a convention that got started some time back, but it has no formal basis or meaning. 
For instance, one of my favorite sites is irrelevant; for instance, if you enter http://microsoft.com, 
you get the same site as http://www.microsoft.com. 
Various browsers may have functionality that makes assumptions if you do or don't use it, but that's within the discretion of the browser maker. 
I hope that is helpful -- Ian Linda Bellitt (by way of Martin Duerst duerst@w3.org ) I'm not sure what you mean, but I assume the question is when it is OK to enter an URI like: as opposed to: The answer is that this is based on the DNS records of the domain name.

Larry For http URIs: the www. 
prefix is just a convention: whether it's needed or not is up to the administrators who manage the parent domain name, e.g. example.com 
for www.example.com. 
If they have made an address record for example.com, 
and the webserver at that address accepts the name, then you can use it. 
Likewise for home.example.com, 
etc. urn:ietf:rfc:2219 = http://ietf.org/rfc/rfc2219.txt 
For other URIs, especially non-URLs, www (if it appears at all) may be an essential part of the URI, and removing it could create a completely different URI. 
No; however some Web browsers, if unable to look up an address for a domain name in an http URL, will prefix www. 
and try again. 
No, unless the registered name servers don't allow the necessary records to be created. 
Any input would be most helpful. 
hope this helps, Daniel Biddle deltab@osian.net 
Agreed, it's a useful convention, as one can infer from minimal information the type of service that's likely to be available. 
For example (and in the spirit of 2219), if I'm looking for a DNS "authority" for a given domain, I often seek ns[1].foo.com. 
In your mail, Larry, Outlook displays a working HTTP hyperlink for www.realbeer.com 
but not for realbeer.com. 
However, what I DON'T like about it is the onomotopoiea of "double-u double-u double-u"... g -- Ian duerst@w3.org

Larry Originally, the suggested name was `info.domain', 
rather than `www.domain'. 
I think people found it too general, but it was certainly easier to pronounce. 
Given the `modern web', it might have been a bit optimistic as well. 
chad I find it good practice to redirect other hostnames' port 80 to www, rather than CNAME it, so that search engines, caches and the like don't have duplicates. 
I.e., instead of having foo.com and www.foo.com return the same resources, have all requests to foo.com redirected to the appropriate part of www.foo.com, to reduce duplication. 
This is easy to configure in most servers. 
Mark Nottingham, Research Scientist Akamai Technologies (San Mateo, CA USA) Definitely. 
In fact, it's good practice to limit the number of duplicate URIs for the same resources on your server entirely. 
This helps, but there are often many more things that need to be fixed.

I looked for HTTP redirect configuration options and couldn't find it. 
Does IIS support HTTP redirects? 
Anybody know? 
Dan Connolly, W3C http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/ Yes, it does, per the documentation for IIS 5.0. 
It's on the Directory (Home Directory, Virtual Directory) tab.
