Hi everybody, I just built amaya 0.9a on solaris 2.5 and thought you might find useful the following report of how things went. 
Hope this helps,

Here is my experience while compiling Amaya on my Solaris 2.5 machine. 
In http://www.w3.org/member/WWW/Amaya/User/Compiling.html it is said: 

How to build, short version: Here is a simple recipe explaining how to build on one of the supported target: 
cd to Amaya/Target directory. 
However, there is no Amaya directory in the hierarchy. 
I assume it's really Thot/Target and go into Thot/solaris2. 

$ make gcc -c -O -Wall -DRISC -DSVR4 -DSYSV -I/usr/X11/include -I/nfs/u/lehors/Thot/solaris2 -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I/nfs/u/lehors/Thot/thotlib/include -I/nfs/u/lehors/Thot/thotlib/internals/var -I/nfs/u/lehors/Thot/thotlib/internals/h -I/nfs/u/lehors/Thot/thotlib/internals/f -I/nfs/u/lehors/Thot/schemas -I/nfs/u/lehors/Thot/schemasOPERA -I/nfs/u/lehors/Thot/libjpeg -I/nfs/u/lehors/Thot/libpng -I/nfs/u/lehors/Thot/libpng/zlib -I/usr/X11/include -o /nfs/u/lehors/Thot/solaris2/thotlib/base/compilmsg.o /nfs/u/lehors/Thot/thotlib/base/compilmsg.c

file or *** Error code 1 make: Fatal error: Command failed for target `/nfs/u/lehors/Thot/solaris2/thotlib/base/compilmsg.o' 
I set the following in the Makefile: MOTIFLIBS = -L/usr/dt/lib -L/usr/openwin/lib -lXm -lXt# Solaris STDLIBS = -L/usr/openwin/lib -lX11 -lsocket -lnsl -lm -lc # Solaris COMPIL_OPTIONS= -c $(CFLAGS) $(SYSTEM_FLAGS) -I /usr/dt/include -I/usr/openwin/include -I$(THOTDIR)/${MACHINE} -DHAVE_CONFIG_H This time the build goes all the way through. 
I get to the second step 'make amaya' which fails with the following error: 

cd /nfs/u/lehors/Thot/amaya; /nfs/u/lehors/Thot/solaris2/bin/str HTML sh: cpp: not found 
*** Error code 139 make: Fatal error: Command failed for target `/nfs/u/lehors/Thot/amaya/HTML.STR' cpp on solaris is in /usr/ccs/lib. 
I wouldn't expect people to have this in there PATH. 
cpp should be defined at compile time, and controlled via a variable in the Makefile. 
I add /usr/ccs/lib to my PATH though and restart 'make amaya'. 
This time it works all the way through. 
I try to start it: 

$ bin/amaya ld.so.1: bin/amaya: fatal: libXm.so.3: can't open file: errno=2 Killed 
Gasp. 

$ ldd bin/amaya libXm.so.3 = (not found) libXt.so.4 = /usr/lib/libXt.so.4 libX11.so.4 = /usr/lib/libX11.so.4 libsocket.so.1 = /usr/lib/libsocket.so.1 libnsl.so.1 = /usr/lib/libnsl.so.1 libm.so.1 = /usr/lib/libm.so.1 libc.so.1 = /usr/lib/libc.so.1 libXext.so.0 = /usr/openwin/lib/libXext.so.0 libdl.so.1 = /usr/lib/libdl.so.1 libw.so.1 = /usr/lib/libw.so.1 libintl.so.1 = /usr/lib/libintl.so.1 libmp.so.1 = /usr/lib/libmp.so.1 
(BTW ldd is not available on all systems, on HP it's chatr, etc...) 
I start it with LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/dt/lib:/usr/openwin/lib. 
I'm not sure why I need this since there is -L/usr/dt/lib in the link command of amya... 
One other comment: the lack of edit/browse mode makes it difficult to use amaya as a simple browser since I can modify by mistake the document I'm browsing. 
Could we have an option to make editing inactive ? 
Hi Arnaud, seems that you went throught a number of configuration problems, I guess that most answers were in the same document but at the end in the troubleshooting section : 
right , an error in the doc, the base name changed ... 
Ok, just a problem of includes (and library path in the Makefile) This potentialp problem is handled in "If make failed" section, bullet 2 point 2. 
Section Prerequisite : "Having usual Unix development tools, at least sed, awk and cpp should be available." 
Section "If make failed", bullet 3, point 2 give a replacement for cpp using a script shell based on gcc 
I love this one, that's the beauty of shared libs ... Section "If amaya binary doesn't work", point 1. 
Ok, didn't know for HP systems, on Linux it's ldd too ... I guess the worse is for AIX, we were not abble to found the ldd equivalent . 
I don't think it's very complicated, is it a priority ? 
Thank you for your comments, I will modify the Makefile.orig of solaris2 Target to point to the openwin and dt directories for includes and libraries. 
It's more standard than the paths we are using for development. 
yes definitely, Daniel Daniel Veillard@w3.org | W3C / INRIA Rhone-Alpes | Today's Bookmarks : Daniel.Veillard@inrialpes.fr| 655 av de l'Europe | Linux, WWW, Tel : +33 04 76 61 53 85 | 38330 Montbonnot | badminton, Home: +33 04 76 63 05 86 | http://opera.inrialpes.fr/veillard 
Well, I guess not really, but on the other hand if the ratio benefit/time is high it might still be worth it. 
Excellent. 
This was basically the intent of my report. 
Thanks for the prompt answer too.
