<s> Dear Jim et al., Respectfully, I disagree.  </s>
<s> Lynx quickly revealed problems with the site.  </s>

<s> HomePage reader hardly overcomes the issue of missing ALT content, even -- if it turns out -- that the missing ALT is only decorative .GIFs.  </s>
<s> I use, and promote, an unambiguous definition for accessibility.  </s>
<s> An accessible site is one that addresses all the WCAG P1 checkpoints.  </s>
<s> An inaccessible site fails to satisfy one or more P1 checkpoints ON ANY PAGE -- NO MATTER HOW "TRIVIAL" THE VIOLATION.  </s>
<s> Any other definition gets us onto a very slippery slope, and into the realm of judgement calls and opinions.  </s>
<s> The definition of "accessible" MUST be independent of the browser and assistive technology used to render a site.  </s>
<s> This is not to say that an "accessible" site can not be improved or made MORE accessible.  </s>
<s> This is not to say that an accessible site is usable by  </s>
<s> certain disability populations.  </s>
<s> This is not to say that the site content is any good or even well designed!  </s>
<s> If this definition of "accessible" does not work for someone, then I think the appropriate action on their part is to join the GL working group and contribute suggestions on how to improve the next version of the WCAG.  </s>
<s> It  </s>
<s> is extremely counter productive to make "accessible" a moving, nebulous, and changing target.  </s>
<s> Maybe we need a new word or phrase.  </s>
<s> "Accessible" has a great variety of meaning, much of which in the vernacular has nothing to do with disability.  </s>
<s> "WCAG P1 Compliant" might be more accurate, but meaningless to most folks.  </s>
<s> Personally I am willing to keep up the crusade (tough work) that "accessible" *means* "accessible to folks with disabilities".  </s>
<s> I should also mention that I have heard back from the I-Can Online webmaster.  </s>
<s> The site is in beta, they expect to satisfactorily address all accessibility concerns by the time the site has its official launch latter this spring.  </s>
<s> Cheers, Bruce Bailey  </s>
<s> Accessible with Home Page Reader does not necesarily mean accessible, and there are at least features of the page which do not work in non-javascript browsers.  </s>
<s> At least for students at RMIT University, where my office is, and who have to use lynx or emacs in text-mode, this counts as inaccessible.  </s>
<s> However this does raise an interesting topic - what level of support needs to be provided for technology which is not up to date?  </s>
