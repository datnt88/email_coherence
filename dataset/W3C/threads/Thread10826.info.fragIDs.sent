If PIs are retained then PIC should be changed so that it is not  as this is required for many processing instructions. 
(An alternative may be to allow a character reference to be entered within a PI, but this would make XML incompatible with SGML.) 
This is backwards. 
Changing PIC breaks SGML. 
A character reference would not be recognized by the SGML parser, but could be recognized by the XML application. 
XML would strip out the char refs before passing the PI to the system (or to the designated notation processor if my previous suggestion is adopted).

Nice to have you aboard, Charles. 
I think on this one you're crediting us with too much subtlety. 
References aren't the issue - it's just that there are a lot of things that you'd like to put in PI's where it's irritating that you can't just use " " to mean " " - and since XML is almost certainly going to have a hardwired concrete syntax, why don't we change PIC to "% " or "? " or something, so as to make this irritation go away? 
Obviously the problem has no solution in the general case without getting into some of the other mechanisms Charles mentions, but the difficulties with the single character " " are one of the many little things that add up to constitute the barrier to entry to SGML. 
Clearly this makes it harder to treat existing SGML documents with PI's as XML... which raises an important point: we've been focusing on building XML to encourage a flood of *new* documents out of proprietary formats into descriptive markup; should we be worried about supporting the existing SGML legacy base? 
I think not, but it's a valid question.

I don't think we have to directly. 
As long as we are 8879-legal, I have no problems with filtering mechanisms here. 
It is already the common practice. 
We can safely say, I believe, that XML was designed to enable efficient implementation and use of SGML online. 
Mileage depends on terrain. 
In this statement, all SGML applications are treated equally. 
That is, XML doesn't favor or disfavor HTML, 28001, TEI, on and on. 
We cannot go down the path of ensuring backward compatibiity where application-specific features have been introduced.
