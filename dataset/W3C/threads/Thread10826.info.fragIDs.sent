<s> Nice to have you aboard, Charles.  </s>
<s> I think on this one you're crediting us with too much subtlety.  </s>
<s> References aren't the issue - it's just that there are a lot of things that you'd like to put in PI's where it's irritating that you can't just use " " to mean " " - and since XML is almost certainly going to have a hardwired concrete syntax, why don't we change PIC to "% " or "? " or something, so as to make this irritation go away?  </s>
<s> Obviously the problem has no solution in the general case without getting into some of the other mechanisms Charles mentions, but the difficulties with the single character " " are one of the many little things that add up to constitute the barrier to entry to SGML.  </s>
<s> Clearly this makes it harder to treat existing SGML documents with PI's as XML... which raises an important point: we've been focusing on building XML to encourage a flood of *new* documents out of proprietary formats into descriptive markup; should we be worried about supporting the existing SGML legacy base?  </s>
<s> I think not, but it's a valid question.  </s>

<s> We cannot go down the path of ensuring backward compatibiity where application-specific features have been introduced.  </s>
