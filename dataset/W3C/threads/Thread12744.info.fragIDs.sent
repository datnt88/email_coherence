<s> Rob, To re-interate what Charles is implying in his message, and what I mentioned in an earlier e-mail, there is a W3C process we need to follow for hosting workshops.  </s>
<s> We welcome organizations offering to host, and we'd need to coordinate closely on this.  </s>
<s> I've suggested to you in my earlier e-mail a time we could meet by phone to discuss this.  </s>
<s> Please let me know if that time is possible for you.  </s>
<s> Regarding having a two-day line-by-line discussion of the WCAG, that is what the Web Content Guidelines Working Group did for over a year.  </s>
<s> Current comments can go to the attention of the WCAG editors' addresses noted in the introduction to the document.  </s>
<s> That working group then discusses those comments for possible inclusion in future versions.  </s>
