classy Hi, 'classy' is Al Gilman in Haloween disguise wendy what should be the priority for a draft for the F2F meeting? 
classy Anything that helps answer a bonafide question that came in on WAI-IG JS If every technique was coded with screen shots. 
in the 3 yrs played with. 
table that listed User Agents. 
JM Would like to collaborate on that. 
resiability of fonts have mac and windows, no linux. 
JS I have linux w/mozilla and opera WC webreview chart is great, but don't show interaction w/assistive technologies jm and somewhat inaccurate. 
classy Is there capability in either Adobe or Corel to take a bitmapped screen shot and object-recognize it into SVG? 
Then we could make the screen shots faithful but WAVE like annotated, too. 
js i can start w/font section and work way through list. 
cover opera and mozilla and netscape 6 jm i'll cover whichever you don't cover wc reads classy's question js interesting question. 
good idea. 
wc who wants to follow up? 
.. al? 
classy Let's see if Chaals knows anything. 
He's double dipper on this one, AU and SVG Techs. 
asw - anyone testing w/ie5? 
jm i can do that 5 and 5.5 for mac, 5 for windows asw is all the testing covered? 
i can do home page reader jm aol? 
wc need matrix of browsers/platforms/assistive technologies. 
asw can help edit and maintain list of issues asw how run? 
weekly call? 
classy Accessibility Forum is doing a survey [matrix cells] could collaborate there. 
I could follow up on this one. 
wc some calls, need to figure out how to wok w/each other. 
mm interop w/html techs and coding techniques classy Does our vision for the CSS Techs doc. 
include comprehensive exaples at the page and House Style level as well as point by point exampleLets? 
jm sounds like gathering examples, screen shots good way to go. 
even if get started on before meeting. 
then say yes or no. js divide up the subsections and contribute. 
15 sections i can take the 1st five asw any browser support aural? 
wc think emacspeak w/WWW browser is the only one. 
js sooner or later, baseline capabilities will come up. 
using positioning, etc. what will older browsers we will shut out. 
Kynn hey you skipped me ;) kb editing, piecing together, open issues and bugs classy ag nitpicking 'class' choices if you will tolerate this js jm, you don' thave os 10? Kynn You expect me to tolerate anything you do, Al? :) * wendy reads ag's note Kynn I can work on reviewing feedback js i will take first 5, to code those techniques. 
render in browsers and test. 
provide screen shots. 
classy ciao, Wendy - let me know if GL wants me to follow up on AF/Interop contact or if GV wants to do it. 
Resolved: js take 1st five, jm 2nd five, mm last five. 
This means, they take responsibility, everyone helps. 
Need to coordinate amongst each other. 
asw in gathering issues - go back to november 2000? 
one take ig other take gl kb at least, assemble the list of comments asw - i'll do gl kb i'll take ig wc for now, send stuff to me and I'll post. 
We'll figure out editing privileges and access to W3C server later. 
wc next time to chat? 
monday - 12 november we'll figure out on e-mail.

Whoops. 
Only sent to Wendy by mistake the first time. 
Detailed minutes: Jo testing on Mac. already working on test pages - units of measurement. 
Jo test page is at http://jomiller.com/css/fontsizetest.html 
I am interested in doing this in EARL (see below) which would mean having a URI per test case. 
I have iCab in Mac OS 9 and 10, and a few other obscure browsers - if anything has CSS support I'll look, as well as something that doesn't (like links or wannabe). 
classy Is there capability in either Adobe or Corel to take a bitmapped screen shot and object-recognize it into SVG?

wc reads classy's question js interesting question. 
good idea. 
wc who wants to follow up? 
.. al? classy Let's see if Chaals knows anything. 
He's double dipper on this one, AU and SVG Techs. 
There are several tools that will do conversions from bitmaps, and others that will convert fonts to SVG fonts. 
wc need matrix of browsers/platforms/assistive technologies. 
CMN The results for this would be a good use case for EARL. 
Sean Palmer might be able to help us make a bookmarklet or similar to generate the right code. 
Chaals 
I had a look at the test page for fontsizes using iCab 2.5.3 on Mac OS X.1 and it seemed to do what I expected, but it is not clear what it is supposed to look like. 
Do you know that there is already a fairly comprehensive test suite for CSS - should we use that instead?

Thanks, Chaals. 
Yes, by all means let's make use, whenever possible, of the test suite that exists. 
[1] The purpose of the preliminary test page I was working on [2] was narrow: I wanted to test which units of font measurement allow easy resizing of text by the user in various browsers (emphasis on the "easy" -- using a clearly labeled "size" button in your browser's toolbar qualifies as easy; whipping up a little javascript to custommize your browser's behavior does not). 
I was also interested in seeing the effects of different DOCTYPE statements on the way certain browsers (mainly IE for Mac) handled font sizes. 
Here's some previous correspondence with Joel on that subject, for background. 
More: 
In general, the following units of measurement allow for easy resizing on IE 5-6 for Windows (the most popular browser), IE 5 for Mac, Netscape 4.x-6 on Windows, and AOL 6 (?) for Windows: -em -percentages -x-small, small, medium, large, x-large In Netscape for Windows, points can be resized, but not pixels. 
In IE for Windows, neither points nor pixels can be resized. 
IE 5.x for Mac and Opera for Mac/Windows allow the user to resize all text (pixels, points, you name it). 
I'm still testing with AOL. 
All of this should be considered preliminary, and I would appreciate input from people who know more than I do. 
Thanks!
