<s> Gentlemen, In the latest edtodo list [1] you will find about 33 rows marked as "editorial" (should show up as orange).  </s>
<s> Some of these rows point to separate subparts of the same issue so the actual number of issues is a bit smaller.  </s>
<s> Collectively we have an action item for providing appropriate closing text for these issues and send them to xmlp-comments@w3.org before Sep 25.  </s>
<s> In order to discharge this action item, I suggest that we divide the set of issues into 5 buckets and assign a bucket to each of us (I picked alphabetical order):  </s>
<s> Gudge: 236, 253, 256, 261, 264, 265,  </s>
<s> Henrik: 267, 269, 270, 271, 278, 279,  </s>
<s> Jean-Jacques: 280, 281, 282, 283, 284, 285,  </s>
<s> Marc: 286, 288, 289, 328, 334, 335, Noah: 337, 341, 343, 353, 361 Does this work for everybody?  </s>

<s> Ok, I've done mine, except #280 for which I'm awaiting further feedback.  </s>
<s> Whilst I was at it, I've also done the next three.  </s>
<s> Marc: this closed some of yours (286, 288, 289).  </s>
<s> I hope that's ok with you.  </s>

<s> What's the issue with 280?  </s>
<s> Is it how we say that even though there are  </s>
<s> practical limits we don't restrict the ways SOAP may be extended?  </s>
<s> Henrik  </s>
<s> Sep 25 is what we promised the WG.  </s>
<s> Henrik  </s>
<s> Fine, but it may take me a few days to get to them.  </s>
<s> What is the deadline for getting these done?  </s>
<s> Thanks.  </s>

<s> [Proposal at the end] Eds, I was asked to close issue 280 with "no action" [1].  </s>
<s> In looking at this issue further, I think I now concur with the issuer, and propose that we are more explicit about which changes are allowed to the processing model.  </s>
<s> The issuer wondered whether the following text: "MUST clearly and completely specify the content and semantics of the SOAP header blocks used to implement the behavior in question, including if appropriate any modifications to the SOAP Processing model."  </s>
<s> means that the SOAP processing model can be changed in arbritary ways, without any restriction.  </s>
<s> Changes to the processing model are only hinted at in the section "SOAP processing model": "Mandatory SOAP header blocks are presumed to somehow modify the semantics of other SOAP header blocks or SOAP body elements."  </s>
<s> "The processing of one or more SOAP header blocks MAY control or determine the order of processing for other SOAP header blocks and/or the SOAP body.  </s>
<s> For example, one could create a SOAP header block to force processing of other SOAP header blocks in lexical order."  </s>
<s> Suggestion: insert the following text in Section 3.2, bullet 2 (now 3): Such modifications include, for example, changing the order in which SOAP headers blocks are processed (see specref ref="mustunderstand"/ ).  </s>
<s> Another example would be to completely replace the SOAP processing model defined by this specification by one defined by the corresponding SOAP module.  </s>
<s> What do you think?  </s>

<s> Thanks... Would description of examples of what one can do with features be primer stuff?  </s>
<s> Henrik  </s>
<s> Ok... what about adding the following sentence (*quoted*): "MUST clearly and completely specify the content and semantics of the header blocks used to implement the behavior in question, including if appropriate any modifications to the SOAP Processing model.  </s>
<s> *The SOAP Processing Model may be changed in arbitrary ways.*"  </s>
<s> We might wish to add a safety warning.  </s>
<s> What do you think?  </s>
