Dear Folks, 
In developing the next version of a program using Tidy based code, I am needing to add support for input X(HT)ML files using specific file extensions, to weed out unwanted files, especially when tidying whole directories. 
i.e. we don't want to Tidy "mylargeofficesuite.exe" or "mymapoftheworld.jpg". 
Here is a list of file extensions I am using at the moment : /* [1] */ ".html"; /* [2] */ ".htm"; /* [3] */ ".text"; /* [4] */ ".txt"; /* [5] */ ".xml"; /* [6] */ ".xhtml"; /* [7] */ ".asp"; /* [8] */ ".jsp"; /* [9] */ ".php" 
Looking for suggestions for typical file extensions I may have missed. 
How do other Tidy developers handle this? 
Regards, Terry 
I would add .shtml .shtm 
.phtml 
.phtml 
*.wml (WML 2.0 only) .?html (maybe, depends on whether or not you want to process cHTML also) .?htm (maybe, depends on whether or not you want to process cHTML also) and remove .txt 
Microsoft office products register additional extensions for their HTML templates, try assoc on a Win2000/WinXP machine: .dochtml=wordhtmlfile 
.docmhtml=wordmhtmlfile 
.dothtml=wordhtmltemplate 
.htm=htmlfile 
.html=htmlfile 
.htw=htmlfile 
.htx=htmlfile 
.mht=mhtmlfile 
.mhtml=mhtmlfile 
.pothtml=powerpointhtmltemplate 
.ppthtml=powerpointhtmlfile 
.pptmhtml=powerpointmhtmlfile 
.shtml=NetscapeMarkup 
.xhtml=xhtmlfile 
.xlshtml=Excelhtmlfile 
.xlsmhtml=excelmhtmlfile 
.xlthtml=Excelhtmltemplate 
Fragments are likely to be found in *.ssi or *.inc also. 
Depending on what your program does, you may want to let the user specify extensions, or guess the file type by looking at the content of the document, or both.

What about ".cfm" for ColdFusion files? 
I know we've talked in the past about individuals configuring tidy to recognize ColdFusion tags.

Hi Terry, There are some XML variants: .xsl 
XSL Stylesheet .xslt 
XSL Transform .xsd 
XML Schema I am sure there are others. 
Although, I might avoid generic XML by default. 
As you know, Tidy isn't 100% whitespace safe for those XML variants that demand it. 
I handle this problem by keeping different types of files in separate directories. 
E.g. I don't mix executables and markup files. 
Also, I use consistent files extensions on markup files: either .xml/.xsl/.xsd or .html. 
I bulk Tidy only .html files. 
Sometimes I tidy XML files for readability, but I usually throw away the result for the reason above.
