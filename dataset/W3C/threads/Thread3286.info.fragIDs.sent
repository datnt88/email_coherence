<s> == As far as I know at this point, I'm neutral on the timing.  </s>

<s> Hi, I have a flu so my fevered brain might not be working clearly (well as clear as it gets anyway), so I wonder: 1) Do we have a goal for number of FTF's per year?  </s>
<s> 2) Do we have a goal for regional distribution of the FTF's?  </s>
<s> 3) Do we have milestones which might drive the need to meet?  </s>
<s> It might be easier to answer the questions below if we knew our objectives.  </s>
<s> For example, if we thought we should meet 4 vs 6 vs 8 times per year, it would be easier to answer the need to meet in Jan, Feb or Mar.  </s>
<s> Also if we had an idea that one in "N" meetings should be in Europe or Asia/Pac to accomodate those members we could gauge the suitability of Prague or other locations.  </s>
<s> We can also then tie in to other events we might attend.  </s>
<s> Later our meeting dates will be driven by our need to publish (and therefore meet) before milestone dates.  </s>
<s> For the near term, I think the more the merrier so we can come together as a team (in a social sense, with agreements on working styles and processes).  </s>
<s> That said, I can't make Wash.  </s>
<s> Prague and Boston are ok.  </s>
<s> I wonder if video conferencing is possible?  </s>
<s> Does w3c cambridge have video conf.  </s>
<s> abilities so those of us in boston could attend Wash.  </s>
<s> that way?  </s>
<s> ok back to fighting the fever.  </s>

<s> Hi Richard,  </s>
<s> My first reaction is that it wouldn't make much sense to have two FTF's close together.  </s>
<s> But on second thoughts it might provide a timeframe for us to work towards if we had clearly identified milestones or tasks for each FTF.  </s>
<s> But its academic to me in a sense, since I could only attend either in a virtual sense, by teleconference or videoconferencing.  </s>
<s> Really depends on whether we can get through enough material to make the Microsoft FTF worthwhile.  </s>
<s> I suspect that a FTF at Microsoft and Boston may be too close to get any real benefit from the second FTF, unless we're quite focused.  </s>
<s> Depends onhow much we can work through between the two FtF's within the context of our other commitments.  </s>

<s> Richard, It would be easier to give an opinion on when to do face to face if we had a better idea what our agendas would be for the meetings.  </s>
<s> With out an agenda and just looking at meeting times, it makes more sense to meet in March at the Tech Plenary, than to have one January in Seattle, One at the beginning of March for the Tech Plenary and then one at the end of March in Prague.  </s>
