aloha, kath! 
let me see if i can provide you with some answers... KM Question 1: As Lynx already has access keys, will assigning access keys to a page cause potential conflicts? 
GJR: no -- accesskeys will simply be transparent to lynx users... a few points of clarification: 1) lynx doesn't currently support "accesskey", as defined at: 2) lynx's keybindings can be reassigned by the user by editing a plain text file; 3) to obtain a list of the currently active keybindings, type a 'k' -- and type an 'h' to get 'help' on using and reassigning keystrokes/keybindings... note, too, that Opera (www.opera.com) also boasts a rich keyboard interface (although no support for "accesskey" that i'm aware of) enabling a lot of on-the-fly control and single-key functionality KM Question 2: The title attribute of a href, for example, doesn't seem to do anything in Lynx? 
Is it required in Lynx - and which browsers is it recognised in? 
GJR: the "title" is used by Lynx when displaying a list of links (by default, typing an 'l' will generate the list of links... caveat/bug: the "title" defined for internal (this-page) links and for (some, if not most) partial references (a link to an anchor in a page) are rather annoyingly rendered (at least by default) in the lynx-generated list of links in the following manner, even if a "title" has been defined for the link: form: in [TITLE of document] - ['name' value for link] example: in Blindness-Related Resources - orgs note: while the contents of the "title" attribute is often exposed as a ToolTip in GUI interfaces, although some (such as Opera) offer options as to where to expose the contents of the "title" attribute as for accesskey support, i know it to be supported in: 1. MSIE for Windows: versions 4x and 5x (works differently in 4x and 5x!) 2. MSIE for the Mac: version 5 (i believe--miraz, help me here!) 3. iCab (Mac): http://www.icab.de/info.html 4. Amaya: ??? (i wish i knew--Amaya _still_ doesn't communicate properly/consistently with my screenreader) KM Question 3: Navigation - We have been developing a method of working that included using invisible images as anchor links within the page so that visually impaired users can easily bypass navigation and go straight to the content of a page. 
As the user can use built in keys in Lynx to move around the page we are again concerned about potential conflicts. 
GJR: i'm not sure i understand the concern... lynx must, perforce, offer more scrolling/navigational keystrokes than a GUI browser because it doesn't have a scrollbar mechanism, hence the advance-2-lines and go-back-2-lines commands, as well as the next/last screenfull go-to-beginning and go-to-end and advance/retreat half-a-page keybindings, to name but a few... the exception to this rule is Opera, whose keyboard interface is extremely robust... actually, as has been well documented on the WAI-IG list and elsewhere -- consult, for example: is a far greater potential for key conflicts when accesskey is being invoked in a GUI environment... MSIE, for example, supports accesskey, but uses the ALT key as the triggering mechanism (you have to hold down ALT whilst typing the accesskey in order to invoke it in IE), which leads to conflicts with IE's user interface, since the means of invoking/opening menus in the windows environment is to use ALT as a modifier/trigger key... for examples, try the accesskey test pages located at: as for use of an invisible image to provide transparent aurally/tactilely oriented information, i'd suggest (a) reading the recent thread on this topic archived in the wai-xtech mailing list's archive, which starts at: KM Question 4: Spacer Images - We have been following the RNIBs advice on spacer images and using * as the alt tag. 
However it appears that the page is easier to read in Lynx if the alt tag is left blank for spacer images, which method should we use? 
GJR: i think you may have misunderstood RNIB's advice -- use null ALT text (ALT="") for spacer images and ALT="*" for graphical bullets, list item indicators, etc., so that the user isn't forced to hear: [bullet: rotating homer simpson head] Visit Springfield! 
[bullet: funky multi-colored rotating disco ball] Disco Stu's Party Palace [bullet: funky multi-colored rotating disco ball] Moe's Tavern [bullet: funky multi-colored rotating disco ball] Stoner's Pot Palace as the result of overly literal descriptions of purely decorative elements -- sure, it's cool to know that the bullet defined for the DT in the DL mock-rendered above is a rotating head of homer simpson, but since i've never seen homer simpson's head, and since the point of using his rotating head is to indicate an item in a list, using ALT="*" for the graphic of homer's rotating head, and ALT="+" for the funky rotating disco ball graphic (a) makes the page more readily comprehensible by someone browsing without support for/need for/desire for images; (b) reduces the cognitive load on the visitor; and (c) is a true textual equivalent for the graphic used as a list item indicator -- of course, if you believe in full disclosure, you could always describe the graphics using the "longdesc" attribute... for an example of this sort of literalism in the wild (and at a site which should know better) consult www.rfbd.org, 
which, as of this writing, not only has inaccessible javascripted "extended/pop-up" navigational menus (with no true equivalent/replication of the content of the javascripted sub-menus), but blocks of text preceded by a graphic whose ALT text is repeatedly defined as "The RFB&amp;amp;D headphone logo", when ALT="*" would have been far more appropriate and user-friendly KM Question 5: HTTPS and Secure Sockets - We have been developing a online donation product which we have endeavoured to make accessible to Priority 1. 
When we came to test the site we found that we couldn't open it in Lynx. 
GJR: lynx can be made to support HTTPS -- refer to: and http://lynx.isc.org/current/README.ssl for detailed information on Lynx &amp; HTTPS/secure sockets... for users using Lynx32, the 32-bit windows port of Lynx, this is more problematic, as the windows version of Lynx comes pre-compiled, which means that it isn't easy to patch... a few work-arounds: contact one of the people involved in porting Lynx to the 32-bit windows platform and ask them to compile an SSL-enabled version of Lynx for distribution via floppy -- the reason Lynx doesn't "ship" with SSL support are restrictive encryption laws, which wouldn't impact an effort to distribute an SSL-enabled version of Lynx32 via floppy, for example, as long as you didn't directly export the floppies! 
another strategy is to offer a SSL-enabled Lynx through a telnet session, in the same manner that public versions of lynx are made available or to set up a proxy server which would enable SSL-support for lynx users... the main distribution points for Lynx32 are: 1. http://www.shonai-cit.ac.jp/eci/senshu/ - excellent and up-to-date ports of the latest Lynx build; unfortunately for those who don't comprehend japanese (a classification that includes my screen-reader), all the info on the download page is in japanese, although the link text is in english; which is really unfortunate, as i believe this site is now (and i hope my publicizing this doesn't put an end to it) either distributing a Win32 port of Lynx with SSL support or instructing users how to provide SSL support for the Lynx32 port -- the informational file is in japanese, and when i attempted to run it through a translation engine, the output was nearly as incomprehensible as the original -- hopefully, someone on this list who speaks/reads/understands japanese (perhaps someone from Keio?) can provide a synopsis of the information contained in: (by the way, anyone know of a good, reliable, free japanese-to-english/english-to-japanese translation engine?) 2. http://www.fdisk.com/doslynx/lynxport.htm - various Lynx ports (for DOS as well as Win32) from the "father of Lynx32", wayne buttles, as well as links to other Lynx ports 3. http://www.jim.spath.com/lynx_win32/ - a lynx-port built using Borland i hope this answered your questions -- please feel free to ask for further clarification on any of the points raised herein or any other issues you have about lynx gregory IMPARTIAL, adj.

However, one should note that IE 4+ and NS 6 have a better way of doing this which degrades cleanly: you can set the image for real list bullets using CSS2. 
(I think NS4 on Windows half implements this and will honour alternative stock choices (disc, circle, etc.), but not images. 
Unfortunately most designers have stereotyped code for these UL simulations, so probably don't realise there has been an alternative for several years. 
I'm not completely sure that NS4 doesn't do it with images; NS4 incorrectly interprets relative URLs in style sheets which can break style images. 
Browser support of this CSS2 feature is still not very good, unfortunately. 
IE4-5 will use the image specified in the CSS but will rarely align the images properly next to the list items.
