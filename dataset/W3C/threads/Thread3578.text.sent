With respect to version dates on the questions- I know we have talked about this before, but I want to raise it again. 
Right now we use the cvs date to represent the last modification. 
On systems where I have used file modification dates it became very hard to realistically determine when a page has been truly reviewed by someone vs. the date when the last change was made. 
Occasionally we will want to make global changes to pages, styles, links, etc. and doing so obscures the date where a meaningful change has occured or the page has been meaningfully reviewed. 
My suggestion: we would be better served by have a note at the bottom of each page indicating the last date someone checked the page. 
It is more useful for us, and useful for readers than the cvs date.

Making e-Business Work Around the World Hi Tex, When you say 'reviewed' do you mean 'revised', or when you say 'checked' and 'reviewed' do you mean that someone looked at the page without necessarily making any changes? 
(The cvs date purely and simply indicates the time when a modified version of this file was uploaded.) RI Richard Ishida W3C reviewed or revised; let's say reconfirmed to still be accurate, and recommended- which is what people really need to know. 
I visit some knowledge bases where you pull up info but you can't trust that its contents are still appropriate for the current technology. 
cvs modifications can occur to pages that have not been looked at by humans.
