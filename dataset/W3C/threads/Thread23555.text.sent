At the closing session of the W3C DRM meeting, I well recall the final whiteboarding session which concluded with drawing up three top level activities which we felt should be reconciled, converged, recognised, or at least talking to each other. 
These were W3c (of course), MPEG-21, and indecs (each of which had been described in the meeting at length). 
I was disappointed therefore to see that the published final Report makes no mention in "Related Activities" of indecs, or of DOI which is implementing many of the key issues discussed. 
The final whitebaorded diagram seems to have been erased from history. 
Although there is scattered mention in the detailed minutes, I believe the final report should reflect this more in line with the actual discussion. 
In particular indecs is I believe very relevant as a study for the development of a Rights Data Dictionary (RDD), a common dictionary or vocabulary for intellectual property rights, based on the indecs Framework [which outlined the fundamental principals and key terminology implemented in DOI applications and ONIX (widely used in publishing and increasingly with audiovisual products)] is even now under way. 
(see http://www.doi.org/news/010418-multimediaIP.html. 
One of the aims of this study is to provide input to MPEG 21 and other standards activities. 
Norman Dear all, the Summary Report of the Workshop is now published[1]. 
Please review all, and send comments to the authors, me or our mailing-list: www-drm@w3.org. 
The mailing-list is the preferred place for discussion. 
If you find typos or mistakes, please let me know.

Best, Policy Analyst 2004, Routes des Lucioles mail:rigo@w3.org 
F-06902 Sophia Antipolis Rigo, all, Thanks for publishing the report. 
Although I have some comments, I think it reflects a good job in accurately conveying what was discussed over the twoworkshop days. 
The one thing that is really missing in my view (and I am echoing Norman's comments) is the summary that we did in the end. 
I really think that list belongs in this summary, with appropriate qualifications (it was the result of a braindump after two days of intensive discussions). 
Please add that summary. 
Then, I am anxious to learn about W3C's next steps. 
Detailed comments follow below. 
W3C will now take these recommendations and discuss it internally before making any formal decisions. 
Any view on the time schedule for this? 
There were a considerable amount of voices requiring, that a system should work offline as online. 
This is not a "should", this is the very definition of DRM: persistent governance. 
Was this the conclusion? 
We did discuss the 'digital mangement of rights' versus the 'management of digital rights' yes. 
Privacy DRM is also processing personal information. 
It needs to treat consumer as a "first-class" object. 
That is, a consumer's profile have access usage conditions, and other (user-) rights linked to it. 
Consumers need to be able to express and manage their rights and interests, and DRM can help them do just that. 
To learn about DRM issues use "simulated interoperability". 
No, this was postulated as a potential solution (though I do not understand well how it can be) Architecture Interoperability is a key DRM requirement (see discussion below) A digital Rights Language is seen as a good first step for DRM standardisation (see discussion below). 
"... a good first step for interoperability, but not nearly enough" Security DRM needs a Trust Infrastructure (see discussion below). 
Yes, true, but the real issue was that *Standardized* DRM needs a Standardized Trust Infrastructure, which makes it such a challenge. 
Multimedia MPEG is addressing DRM needs and should work closely with W3C. 
Good header :-) But the statement strikes me as funny. 
"MPEG should work closely with W3C"? 
This can be read in a number of ways. 
"W3C should work closely with MPEG" is something I have heard as well. 
Please make this comclusion more balanced, so that it doesn't (unintentionally) sound like a requirement on MPEG alone. 
Identifiers The identification of content is a critical requirement for Currently there is no single system that can provide all needed features for all sectors. 
(Note that MPEG has begun to address this issue in the Digital Item Idnetification and Description) DRM Interoperability It is clear that a shared architectural model or abstract framework is required, if only for people to fully understand the depth and breadth of the rights management arena. 
A number of position papers explored this in depth; they considered a layered, abstract model that consisting of policy expression, transmission, interpretation/enforcement, and thus introduced "multiple" levels of well-defined interoperability. 
But we did not agree on a framework. 
We just know it has many layers. 
MPEG's presentation of their MPEG-21 "Digital Item Declaration Model" proposal suggests another pathway to interoperability, which is consistent a call for a word missing ("with") ? 
higher-level framework. 
It is important for W3C to be engaged in that activity, while working toward a framework context. 
Note that the Declaration work in itself is not about DRM. 
MPEG-21 *is* though. 
Good points, well captured. 
Also, note that trust isn't automatically transitive or even reflexive. 
[...] Trust-structures are actually such a big task, that they should be considered outside a DRM-Activity. 
Said who? 
I think (said) no DRM standardization will work without regard for this issue. 
MPEG-4: IPMP (Intellectual Property Management and Protection) MPEG-7 Multimedia Description Schemes MPEG-7 MDS is only one of several MPEG-7 parts, and there are DRM implications also at MPEG-7's Systems layer. 
MPEG-21 Digital Item Identification and Description MPEG-21 DIID is only one of several MPEG-21 parts. 
Notably, the Rights Language and Data Dictionary will be imortant too. 
*suggests* a piece of the solution. 
For example, MPEG-4 IPMP may come close to standardizing DRM APIs, but doesn't treat many other aspects of the problem (such as rights vocabularies, rights messaging, etc). 
True about MPEG-4, much less true when taking into account the complete set of MPEG activities, designed to complement each other. 
(Rights messaging *is* actually addressed in MPEG-4 IPMP now) Next Steps There were opinions voicing, that the W3C is the best existing forum to define a forward-looking Framework. 
There was also concern that this may not be as clear to the broader W3C. Rights management presents a broad set of problems. 
, and a "Web-is-Everything and Everything-is-the-Web" view, if present, would surely generate conflicts in process and politics. 
Note that the same could be said of MPEG processes and politics (for example); I am unclear as to what "the same" exactly refers to. 
MPEG has cetainly recognized that the MPEG-21 vision goes beyond MPEG alone. 
The specialized WG's - possibly just one, but surely several (a somewhat contradictory statement) - would address individual missing pieces, such as a rights expression language - while some will see this as essentially a set of rights primitives with agreed-upon semantics (eg a rights data dictionary mapped onto an XML Schema), others will see this as including object definitions. 
Both interpretations are correct, but at different levels. 
I thnk this is taking one specific element and putting it sort of down as the conclusion of the workshop - see my first comment above. 
Best Regards to all who made it to the end of this mail, Rob Norman, indecs was a major input and we are aware of it. 
This is reflected in the position-papers and the minutes. 
I think a table with related activities would help a lot. 
The interpretation I would make of your statement is, that indecs is not well represented in the summary report. 
I would ask for a suggestion from you and/or Godfrey. 
I therefor would appreciate, if you could help me reconstruct the table you mentioned. 
This table was not minuted nor photographed. 
As I was standing with my back to it as I was chairing the session, I have a somewhat incomplete memory of it. 
Thanks in advance for your help.

2004, Routes des Lucioles You asked for my proposal on this. 
My recollection, possibly not photographic after three months [so others feel free to correct], was that the whiteboard containied a simple diagram of major initiatives in this sphere of digital rights management. 
It wasn't a table, mopre a free hand thought bubble diagram. 
The top three ovals were: on the left W3C; in the middle indecs; on the right MPEG-21 The W3C oval then had a link to IETF, indicating existing liaison; the indecs oval had a link to IDF (DOI) and to ONIX, indicating implementation the MPEG oval had a link to ISO, indicating a formal role. 
I recall, that ODRL and XRML were on the chart too; being a whiteboarded diagram it no doubt lent itself to a more flexible interpretation than text. 
So my suggestions: that under "Related Activities" in the report we add indecs/DOI/ONIX, and that the report include the following: "The workshop concluded that liaison and collaboration to prevent needless duplication of effort should be encouraged. 
In particular, three top level activities were noted in this sphere of digital rights management: W3C - infrastructure and syntax standards, link to IETF etc. indecs - semanatic and content industry standards, link to practical implementations e.g. DOI, ONIX MPEG-21 - ISO standards, proposed development of multimedia framework standards As an example of such collaboration now taking place, the development of a Rights Data Dictionary (RDD), a common dictionary or vocabulary for intellectual property rights, based on the indecs Framework [which outlined the fundamental principals and key terminology implemented in DOI applications and ONIX (widely used in publishing and increasingly with audiovisual products)] is even now under way. 
(see study is to provide input to MPEG 21 and other standards activities."

2004, Routes des Lucioles at no a aims activities. 
With thanks for the vote of confidence Brad, the only thing I have in my notes that wasn't in your list (and I'm not sure actually made it onto the board but it was discussed) was for a/the working group to consider auditing/tracking (i.e., messages flowing in the opposite direction to those stating rights and obligations).

? 
: look at patent rights o what do you mean by that? 
o should be expressable o that is out of scope. 
o MPEG does something here ?

human rights (not infringing), international jurisdiction Dear all, I was not able to reconstruct the image you mention. 
But our mailing-list here works reasonably well. 
So I got several bullet-point lists of things, we discussed during the closing session. 
Now, I thought, that the summary report would not be the right place for an unordered list of thoughts, comments and suggestions from a brainstorming session. 
But you were a lot of people requesting, that the end-session should leave more traces than just the rough minutes we got. 
So I took all the lists I got from Norman, Brad, Rob and Renato, I merged them together and classified the results in three categories: -Requirements for DRM - Liaisons -Suggested Actions The result of this can found under I linked this page from the minutes - overview, but also from the summary report. 
And Norman, I also added DOI to the related activities (and some other along your suggestion). 
I hope, everybody is now happy with this summary report. 
Suggestions on the bullet-list can be made to the list and I will update, as my time allows me to do. 
Best, Rigo
