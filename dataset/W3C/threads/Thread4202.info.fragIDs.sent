<s> Hi "20.2 Disabling Output Escaping Normally, when using the XML, HTML, or XHTML output method, the serializer will escape special characters such as &amp; and  when outputting text and attribute nodes.  </s>
<s> This ensures that the output is well-formed.  </s>
<s> However, it is sometimes convenient to be able to produce output that is almost, but not quite well-formed XML; for example, the output may include ill-formed sections which are intended to be transformed into well-formed XML by a subsequent non-XML-aware process.  </s>
<s> For this reason, XSLT defines a mechanism for disabling output escaping."  </s>
<s> But generating mal-formed XML is not the only reason for having to rely on shaky d-o-e.  </s>
<s> Until I can use s.th.  </s>
<s> like (see I use xsl:text disable-output-escaping="yes" ![CDATA[ /xsl:text [1] This satisfies a requirement of an IMHO not-too-esoteric usage scenario, and the results are well-formed.  </s>
<s> (http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml.html#NT-CDEnd must be escaped) As long as d-o-e is one workaround for features that are not available in XSLT, I'm not sure if the wording is appropriate.  </s>
<s> Perhaps adding xsl:serialize is all that's needed.  </s>
<s> Personally, I don't think I have a use case for d-o-e except that one: I could work around the missing xsl:serialize functionality without d-o-e, but it's one example where d-o-e is used without generating mal-formed XML.  </s>
<s> I'd be happy about not having to rely on d-o-e.  </s>
<s> Tobi [1] full (actual and working, but inclomplete) listing: xsl:apply-templates select="$forrest" mode="strip_ws_only_nodes"/ xsl:copy-of select="saxon:serialize( $forrest_stripped, 'xml_snippets' )"/ xsl:text disable-output-escaping="yes" ![CDATA[ /xsl:text  </s>
<s> Text that justifies why a facility is present in the spec, or that suggests ways of using it, is by its nature incomplete, and one way we could respond to comments like this is to take out the existing explanatory text.  </s>
<s> However, the disable-output-escaping facility is so widely misused that I am  </s>
<s> reluctant to do this.  </s>
<s> I am also reluctant to suggest further special effects that can be achieved using d-o-e, since we really don't want to encourage its use; and I think your use case would require a rather lengthy  </s>
<s> explanation.  </s>
<s> But I'll see if I can add some words that suggest that the examples we have given don't cover all cases.  </s>
<s> Michael Kay  </s>
<s> I'd be happy about never having to rely on d-o-e or extensions :)  </s>
<s> After your explanation, I don't think that's absolutely necessary.  </s>
<s> But a short note stating that mal-formed output is not the only reason for using d-o-e may clarify a bit.  </s>
