<s> Acrobat 4.0 And PDF Accessibility This announcement summarizes the current state of Acrobat Access with respect to the new Acrobat 4.0 release.  </s>
<s> First, we would like to thank all access users for their continued support of our accessibility work, including not hesitating to tell us when we fall  </s>
<s> short in our stated goals.  </s>
<s> We would also like to apologize for the release  </s>
<s> of our accessibility solutions trailing the main Acrobat 4.0 release, however we did not want to release the Access plug-in before it was completely tested.  </s>
<s> Access plug-in Available Now The Acrobat Access plug-in for Acrobat 4.0 on Windows is now available for download.  </s>
<s> Please visit the following web site for information on Acrobat accessibility or to download the plugin: If you have additional questions please email to access-b@adobe.com  </s>
<s> Next Steps The server conversion technology on access.adobe.com will hereafter be upgraded to support PDF 1.3.  </s>
<s> Upcoming Goals Here is a brief road map of where we see Adobe's work on PDF accessibility going in the next 12-24 months: Built-in Access We hope to build accessibility into the next major release of Acrobat.  </s>
<s> Accessible Forms and Digital Signatures PDF Forms are not yet accessible using our current suite of access tools; enabling Form accessibility will be a primary focus over the next year.  </s>
<s> In addition, we will address accessibility of new PDF features such as digital signatures.  </s>
<s> Exploit Logical Structure PDF 1.3,the file format used by Acrobat 4.0, includes the ability to include the logical structure of a document.  </s>
<s> This is a feature that was initially motivated by accessibility.  </s>
<s> We will upgrade our access tools to take advantage of the logical structure in PDF, as structured PDF 1.3 documents become more widespread.  </s>
<s> PDF Authoring Guidelines PDF documents, even more than HTML WWW pages, get created in many different ways.  </s>
<s> In order to provide a better level of access, we will be creating a set of PDF content creation guidelines for accessibility analogous to the WAI content creation guidelines for HTML.  </s>
<s> Accessibility Validation As we develop our access guidelines for PDF, we hope to create corresponding validation tools that allow content creators and publishers to verify that the PDF documents they publish are accessible.  </s>

<s> FYI David,  </s>
<s> I am in the Federal Government and I just gave a presentation to the  </s>
<s> Government Printing Office on PDF and Universal Accessibility.  </s>
<s> This was  </s>
<s> attended by Greg Pisocky, the Adobe Federal Account Rep good guy, too .  </s>
<s> My concern is the Federal government has a huge investment in PDF.  </s>
<s> Next  </s>
<s> year, we expect the Federal Government to Mandate the "AA" Conformance level.  </s>
<s> As I interpret the WAI Content Guidelines, Guideline 11, PDF is a  </s>
<s> non-W3C format and if PDF alone is used, we cannot obtain "AA".  </s>
<s> Therefore  </s>
<s> to obtain a "AA" we must provide a HTML document and proof it!  </s>
<s> That is a  </s>
<s> lot of work!!! REPEAT - A LOT OF WORK ON NO BUDGET.  </s>
<s> We cannot rely on plug-ins because not everyone uses the same tools - some  </s>
<s> use screen readers, some use voice based web browsers, etc.  </s>
<s> So the idea of  </s>
<s> using plug-ins or one tool is ludicrous.  </s>
<s> I do like the Plug-in!  </s>
<s> So how can we easily obtain "AA" conformance?  </s>
<s> Here is what I think we need from Adobe: 1. Guidelines that provide formating instructions so documents are properly created in their native format before they are converted.  </s>
<s> For example, a  </s>
<s> very good workflow white paper.  </s>
<s> 2. From Exchange and Reader, the ability to export to HTML, where the images have ALT tags and links are added, Headings are applied.  </s>
<s> Hmmm, what  </s>
<s> about CSS.  </s>
<s> Does Adobe 4 do this? 3. Work with PWD browser companies to provide in-line acess where PDF can  </s>
<s> be read, for example pwWebSpeak.  </s>
<s> Currently I just save the document and  </s>
<s> open else where and read it with a screen reader or convert it to a text  </s>
<s> file and open it with pwWebSpeak.  </s>
<s> Too many steps.  </s>
<s> David, I beleive in PDF and like it very much - ask Greg and Sandy in your  </s>
<s> Federal Office in DC, but would like to see you help the federal government  </s>
<s> incorporate universal accessibility as we are one of your largest customers.  </s>
<s> If you dont, you will have to deal with angry webmasters, techincal and no-techincal and others come next year.  </s>
<s> Please help us out here!  </s>
<s> Also, this was emailed to many lists.  </s>
<s> Please use caution when replying or  </s>
<s> else Judy Brewer will be very mad at me again smile .  </s>
<s> Lastly, please corect me if I have made incorrect statements.  </s>
<s> rob  </s>
<s> The major problem with PDF is that it is difficult to know by inspection whether it is accessible.  </s>
<s> PDF conversion can be done by taking text and putting it into PDF, which has some hooks to get it out again (for example by sending it to the pdf2html converter that Adobe have).  </s>
<s> The other option is to convert text into an image, and include the image in  </s>
<s> the PDF.  </s>
<s> (This is one of the ways MS Publisher does HTML pages too.) This  </s>
<s> causes a complete failure of accessibility, unless people run everything  </s>
<s> through OCR software, a (yet-to-be-developed) program to generate structural  </s>
<s> relationships from visual cues, and then reads it.  </s>
<s> Saving to bad HTML (which most word-processors can do) is better for accessibility, in part because PDF readers are not as widely available as  </s>
<s> HTML browsers.  </s>
<s> Just my 2c worth.  </s>
<s> I too am interested in the discussion.  </s>
<s> Charles McCN  </s>
<s> I'm looking forward to a discussion on this matter.  </s>
<s> In the Food and Drug Administration, we have used Acrobat to put material online in a timely manner.  </s>
<s> It takes much more time to put an HTML version.  </s>
<s> HTML is our preferred format, but due to limited staffing and huge workloads, we use Acrobat as a first posting.  </s>
<s> When we get the time, we use HTML.  </s>
<s> For smaller and less complicated documents, we use HTML from the start.  </s>
<s> Can any of the screen readers read PDF docs?  </s>

<s> Hi Al Thanks for the comments.  </s>
<s> I included the DMU (De Montford University!) example as an illustration of use of a "gratuitous javascript link" (which performs a "Back to previous page" function).  </s>
<s> I agree that if Javascript is switched off or not available this link would not work, and thus undesirable.  </s>
<s> However the link could be created dynamically using Javascript, and thus only visible if JavaScript is available.  </s>
<s> I thought it might be desirable to have a Back link *within* the page (as opposed to part of the browser) - if, for example, the browser navigational options are disabled, or to provide additional help for a naive user.  </s>
<s> The 404 error message could be a good place to implement this as you often want to go back.  </s>
<s> Any thoughts on this - I've no experience on how browsers other than IE, NS, Opera, Lynx, Mosaic and Viola implement the Back button.  </s>
<s> Thanks Brian Brian Kelly, UK Web Focus UKOLN, University of Bath, BATH, England, BA2 7AY Homepage: http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/ukoln/staff/b.kelly.html  </s>
<s> In my view error messages should not include a link to the referring page, since the user can always use the back button if he wishes.  </s>
<s> Including search options, and links to main entry pages or to a sitemap are much more useful.  </s>
<s> Another thing to consider is providing error messages in different languages (depending on the user's accept-language request header.)  </s>
<s> For a mono-lingual site one should send the error message (at least) in the site's language.  </s>
<s> The default server messages are usually in the server's documantation language.  </s>
<s> Also content providers should use 410 (gone or removed permanently) when appropriate rather than the less informative 404.  </s>
<s> Regards, Nir Dagan "There is nothing quite so practical as a good theory." -- A. Einstein  </s>
<s> One of my pet peeves is the lack of proper web server configuration regarding status codes.  </s>
<s> For example, getting a 404 status when the resource has been knowingly moved or deleted rather than sending the appropriate status (300, 301, 302, 303, 410, etc).  </s>
<s> This is a fundamental usability feature of nearly all web servers.  </s>
<s> I can elaborate on this if anyone would like.  </s>
<s> Here is what I did with my 404 status message: Behind the scenes the 404 message, and other permanent errors, sends email to the server admin with a complete description of the error and automatically sets a Follow-Up flag (Mail header 'X-Message-Flag: Follow up').  </s>
<s> The follow-up flag enters the error into the system calendar's To-Do list in supporting clients.  </s>
<s> In the case of outdated URLs, I manually add the appropriate redirect status to the server's access control file.  </s>
<s> The email message explains this, as well.  </s>
<s> I have a fairly complete set of status messages: I modeled the status messages after Microsoft IIS and Roxen Challenger.  </s>
<s> Jakob Neilsen's 404 article is excellent, by the way.  </s>
<s> In fact, all of his articles are excellent.  </s>
<s> It does overlook the lack of sending proper status messages for changed URLs, though.  </s>
<s> Another thing noteworthy.  </s>
<s> Some browsers (IE 5, notably) require a minimum number of bytes of text before they will override the internal status message.  </s>
<s> Jakob Neilsen points this out in an additional note.  </s>
<s> But, he doesn't mention that IE has a 1024 byte requirement for status messages other than 404.  </s>
<s> (Mentioned in known issues with Apache 1.3.6)  </s>
<s> I stick to a 1024 byte minimum so I don't have to remember which size goes with which status.  </s>
<s> A meaningful message is likely longer, anyway.  </s>

<s> "Another thing noteworthy.  </s>
<s> Some browsers (IE 5, notably) require a minimum number of bytes of text before they will override the internal status message."  </s>
<s> "Requires" is little strong, since users have some control.  </s>
<s> MSIE5 has in its "advanced" settings something called "show friendly HTTP error messages".  </s>
<s> When this feature is enabled (default) the minumum bytes requirement holds.  </s>
<s> Otherwise it always shows the server's response.  </s>
<s> Opera has a similar feature but it has three modes: Always show the server's response, never show the server's response, and show the server's response when appropriate (default).  </s>
<s> The latter has a minimum bytes requirement (I think around 1024).  </s>
