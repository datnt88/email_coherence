<s> Following up on item 9 in today's agenda, here are some potential problem areas in Concepts and Vocabulary (I don't claim these are exhaustive): Concepts Section 3.1 begins: "The underlying structure of any expression in RDF can be viewed as a directed labelled graph, which consists of nodes and labelled directed arcs that link pairs of nodes (these notions are defined more formally in section 6).  </s>
<s> The RDF graph is a set of *triples*:  </s>
<s> [image of the RDF triple comprising (subject, predicate, object)]  </s>
<s> Each property arc represents a *statement* of a relationship between the things denoted by the nodes that it links, having three parts: 1. a property that describes some relationship (also called a predicate), 2. a value that is the subject of the *statement*, and 3. a value that is the object of the *statement*.  </s>
<s> The direction of the arc is significant: it always points toward the object of a *statement*.  </s>
<s> The meaning of an RDF graph is the conjunction (i.e. logical AND) of all the *statements* that it contains."  </s>
<s> I've highlighted *triple* and *statement* in the above.  </s>
<s> The text seems mostly to be talking about the subject/predicate/object of *statements*, except for the introduction, which seems to suggest it's talking about *triples*.  </s>
<s> A question is whether we're going to use subject, predicate, and object for talking both about components of triples, and components of statements and, if so, how we keep them straight.  </s>
<s> Note that the abstract syntax uses these terms to refer to parts of *triples*.  </s>
<s> Also, in bullets 2 and 3, tht term "value" is a bit ambiguous: it could be read either as referring to a URIref, or to the thing denoted by that URIref.  </s>
<s> Given the wording in the preceding phrase, changing "a value" to "the thing" would clarify that it was talking about the thing denoted, rather than the URIref (if that's what it is talking about).  </s>
<s> Concepts Section 3.4, the third sentence, says: "A literal may be the object of an RDF *statement*, but not the subject or the arc" This seems to mix several things.  </s>
<s> A literal sounds like the lexical thing, which would be a reasonable object of a triple, but less-clear for a statement (presumably it's the value denoted by the literal that  </s>
<s> would be the object of a statement).  </s>
<s> "Arc" seems to be mixing in the drawing terminology from Section 3.1, and it's not clear it belongs here.  </s>
<s> Concepts Section 3.5 starts: "Some simple facts indicate a relationship between two objects.  </s>
<s> Such a fact may be represented as an RDF triple in which the predicate names the relationship, and the subject and object denote the two objects."  </s>
<s> In this section, the term "fact" is used as the thing represented as an RDF triple.  </s>
<s> In Section 3.1 the thing represented as a triple seemed to be a "statement".  </s>
<s> There may or may not be a problem using "fact" in this kind of text, but its relationship to "statement" needs to be made clear.  </s>
<s> Also, "object" is used in two different ways, as the things  </s>
<s> denoted by subjects and objects, and as the third component of a triple.  </s>
<s> Vocabulary Section 5.3.1:  </s>
<s> This section starts with some nice text that is clearly about subjects, predicates, and objects of *statements*.  </s>
<s> Section 5.3.2 (rdf:subject) then says: "A *triple* of the form: S rdf:subject R states that S is an instance of rdf:Statement and that the subject of S  </s>
<s> is R" This may or may not be problematic.  </s>
<s> The question is whether the reader will interpret S and R as the URIrefs involved in the corresponding triple, or as the resources denoted by S and R. Similar comments apply to sections 5.3.3 and 5.3.4.  </s>

<s> Well held that Man! (English for "good catch") The comment below on the vocab doc doesn't just apply to the reification section, there are many such instances, e.g.: [[The triple P rdfs:range C states that P is an instance of the class rdf:Property, that C is an instance of the class rdfs:Class and that the resources denoted by the objects of triples whose predicate is P are instances of the class C.] That one should go to comments.  </s>

<s> Let me make the following suggestions for a uniform way to approach and present our terminology.  </s>
<s> 1.  </s>
<s> A triple *is* a 3-tuple which is made up of a subject, predicate and object which are respectively a uriref or bnode; uriref; uriref, bnode or literal.  </s>
<s> 2. An RDF graph *is* a set of triples.  </s>
<s> Note that so far there is nothing even remotely graph-theoretic - nodes, arcs, etc. - mentioned.  </s>
<s> This is important for the formal documents, so it would be helpful for readers if the less formal documents at least didn't give the impression of saying something different.. 3. One can draw a *picture* of an RDF graph as a node-arc diagram (which is why we call them "graphs") using the conventions we all know and love.  </s>
<s> Notice that the labels of the directed arcs *in the picture* are always the predicates, and that the bnodes *in the picture* really are blank, etc.. Also in this picture one can see a distinction between nodes and node labels, and arcs and arc labels.  </s>
<s> But that's all just *pictorial*.  </s>
<s> 3a.  </s>
<s> Maybe, when we are being careless, we might use the 'picture' terminology when talking about triples and RDF graphs.  </s>
<s> But that's just being careless and intuitive.  </s>
<s> 4. RDF graphs are typically used to make assertions, by being published on the Web, and when so used they can be seen as *statements*; in effect, they *state* that some condition is true.  </s>
<s> 4a.  </s>
<s> When being careless, we might use the 'statement' terminology when referring to triples or RDF graphs.  </s>
<s> But that's just being careless and intuitive.  </s>
<s> If we all stick to this discipline, then it suggests rewrites similar to the following in the places noted:  </s>
<s> Change to: "The underlying structure of any expression in RDF is a collection of triples, each consisting of a subject, a predicate and an object.  </s>
<s> A set of such triples is called an RDF graph (defined more formally in section 6.) The structure can be illustrated by a directed node-arc diagram in which each triple is represented as a node-arc-node link (hence the term "graph".)  </s>
<s> When some RDF is published or claimed to be true, the triples in the graph are treated as assertions or statements.  </s>
<s> The assertion of an RDF triple says that some relationship, indicated by the predicate labelling the directed arc in a diagram, holds between the subject and object of the triple, indicated by the nodes linked by the arc in the diagram.  </s>
<s> The assertion of an RDF graph amounts to asserting all the triples in it, so the meaning of an RDF graph is the conjunction (logical AND) of all the statements it contains.  </s>
<s> A formal account of the meaning of RDF graphs is given in [RDF Semantics].  </s>
<s> Right.  </s>
<s> I suggest we all do an edit pass to make sure that the words subject/predicate/object are used consistently to refer to the syntactic parts of a triple, and not to anything else.  </s>
<s> Right, I think it is confusing.  </s>
<s> Better to say 'predicate'  </s>
<s> Right. Suggested rewording might be: "Some simple facts can be phrased in terms of a relationship holding between two things.  </s>
<s> Such a fact can be expressed by an RDF triple in which the predicate names the relationship and the subject and object name the things.  </s>
<s> "  </s>
<s> Right, I have used this form of words in the semantics doc a lot, and it caused some confusion.  </s>
<s> But it is hard to see how else to say it, other than by being incredibly long-winded and making the text unreadable.  </s>
<s> Talking about the reification vocabulary is particularly awkward, of course.  </s>
<s> I'm not sure what else we can do, except maybe add some emphasis prose to clarify things at particularly tricky moments, eg: S rdf:subject R is used when referring to another triple S. It states that S is an instance of rdf:Statement and the the subject of the triple S is R." But Im not sure that helps very much.  </s>
<s> BTW, the above is not strictly true: it asserts that the subject of the triple S *denotes* R, not *is* R. -Pat  </s>
