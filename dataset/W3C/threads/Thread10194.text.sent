I am in the middle of reviewing the concepts document. 
It seems to have at least two conventions for indicating a new term that is being introduced/defined. 
Does W3C give any guidelines for this? 
It would be better if all the docs did it the same way. 
belatedly Brian If we do, they're likely to be in W3C Manual of Style Help for Editors and Authors of W3C Technical Reports I'm off to another telcon or I'd check more closely myself. 
Dan Connolly, W3C http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/ Hello, Brian, I don't think we have a firm guideline for introducing terms so far.
