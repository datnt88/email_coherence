Is there a way of detecting the positional location of a specific element? 
Such a feature would be of interest for certain applications, where one likes to position certain elements in relation to the position of other elements.

1-5 P.O.Box 28 61 56 D-28199 Bremen, GERMANY NOTE: These methods are only valid if the document is locked from modification while you are doing the traversal. 
To determine the depth of a node in the tree you can traverse the nodes returned by getParentNode() until the method returns null and count how many ancestors the node has. 
To determine the ordinal position of a node within its siblings you can do the same thing but call getPreviousSibling() instead of getParentNode(). 
You may find the result more meaningful if you only count nodes that are elements. 
Steve Oldmeadow Justice Systems Technologies Hello, To position a node in relation to the position of other elements, one can use the insertBefore() , getPreviousSibling() and getNextSibling() methods defined by the Node interface. 
As far as I know the DOM interfaces provide no method for retrieving the numerical value of the position of a node in a stucture implementing a NodeList.
