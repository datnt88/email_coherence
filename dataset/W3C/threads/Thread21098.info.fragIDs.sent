You don't appear to have gdk-imlib installed. 
On my Debian machine, 
this appears to come from the imlib library, which is probably what you need to install. 
Curiously, this dependency appears to be missing from the Amaya web pages. 
gdk? 
Is that a typo for gtk, because I don't know of gdk? 
Where would I find this source so I can install it? 
I tried to get some gtk stuff to build dillo and could only find RPMs, which I don't have the tools for on OSF1. 
Maybe this information should be in the configure script too? 
Thank you, 
Hugh 
GDK is part of GTK. 
I think gdk-imlib is an interface to imlib which is 
somehow friendly for applications using GTK, although I'm not entirely certain. 
I'm not sure what the canonical source is, but you should be able to get the sources from a Debian mirror (because Debian distributes sources as an archive and a separate patch for the Debian specific changes, you can just take the archive and use it on other systems). 
You'll find that at 
although I must confess that I've never built it from source. 
An alternative might be to build the GL version, which doesn't appear to require gdk-imlib. 
I imagine so. 
Brian 
Oh! I'm not familiar with it, as you can tell :-) I'll google a bit more then, to learn about this. 
That's worth knowing, thank you. 
Hmmm, that may be possible, since the machine is in a 3D imaging group... 
Thank you, 
Hugh

so why is it not finding it? 
Hugh 
The possibilities that come to mind are that it's looking for a libjpeg.so 
(try adding a symlink from libjpeg.so to libjpeg.so.6a), or that it 
isn't searching that directory (try setting LIBRARY_PATH and C_INCLUDE_PATH, or add -L/usr/local/lib to the CFLAGS, or look for a 
configure option to specify the location of the JPEG library). 
Brian 
Turns out there already is one: # diff libjpeg.so* 
# cmp libjpeg.s* 
# cmp libpng.s* 
# ls -l libjpeg.s* 
libpng.s*

Not sure how C_INCLUDE_PATH would help for a library. 
Tried -L... but it din't help. 
I'm still getting the failures with imlib. 
Thanks, 
Hugh 
Hello all, I have been using amaya like a word processor and I have been impressed advanced Web spec and language support. 
But, I am wondering out loud why you have not considered porting to Gecko. 
Personally, I dont know anybody that likes Mozilla's commercial side and it 
feels like Gecko needs to be rescued from [ big conglomerate deleted ]. 
Also, it seems that everything you write for amaya will have to be rewritten 
for Gecko.. and.. lots of folks speak highly of XUL.

This would be another project. 
When you change basic concepts, you're not doing a porting but you're developing a new project. 
I guess Netscape guys already develop a HTML editor based on Gecko. 
I guess it's important to adopt standards for formats and data but that should not imply to have a unique tool.

My concern is the that there aren't enough developers for Amaya and that all the added features in Amaya will have to be rewritten for Mozilla. 
When you google on free html editors, Amaya comes up first. 
It seems there a 
large number of people at least want to use it in their everyday lives. 
A huge 
problem for public software is quality assurance. 
I have found that amaya crashes often and unpredictably. 
On the Mozilla side, Bugzilla has been shut down, creating integrity problems for millions of users. 
Many products are built on top of it. 
Gecko has been embraced by Gnome making it sanctified as a public project, but the rapid changes in the renderer is making the Gnome source difficult to maintain. 
Here is a company that seems to want to build a whole desktop from Gecko where their version of Gecko is Penzilla. 
They are open and seem to be aiming for the embedded markets. 
If amaya were to work with Gecko then it seems that the Netscape product would more closely adhere to the goals of the W3C.

Normally the include "jinclude.h" is necessary to compile a program that uses the libjpeg library. 
Could you check that the include is installed. 
The option -L is useful to locate libraries but not to locate includes. 
Irene. 
Ir?ne Vatton INRIA Rh?ne-Alpes INRIA ZIRST e-mail: Irene.Vatton@inria.fr 655 avenue de l'Europe 
Well, there wasn't one on anything in a directory called include, but the first one found was: ./home/hgs/gnu/Amaya/libjpeg/jinclude.h I.e., in my Amaya build directory, so it should be found, shoouldn't it?

imlib and gtk work with system libraries. 
So you have to install the dev-package of the jpeg library provided with the system. 
Each library version has its corresponding include.

That's what blew up last time: libpng/zlib dependancy would not compile.... Hugh
