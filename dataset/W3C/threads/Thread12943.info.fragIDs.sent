<s> Hello, all - I find the current version of Financial Factors hard to access.  </s>
<s> So, here's my two cents.  </s>
<s> Rewrites include: 1. Removing redundant content and multiple ideas in one paragraph.  </s>
<s> 2. Attempting to group like ideas together.  </s>
<s> 3. Improving flow.  </s>
<s> 4. Changing bolding to focus on headers.  </s>
<s> 5. Removing confusing structure.  </s>
<s> The document is hard to scan, and the structure is not truly hierarchal: - Inconsistent use of bullets and definition lists.  </s>
<s> - The bullets and definition list indentations are different, creating visual hierarchy confusion.  </s>
<s> - Misuse of definition list for formatting and not structure.  </s>
<s> (In particular, JAWS tells users they've reached a definition list and the number of items in the list, which is confusing as the information is not words or concepts with their respective definitions.)  </s>
<s> I may have unintentionally omitted content.  </s>
<s> Attached is a zip file with the revised HTML version.  </s>
<s> I've also included my Word working copy, which tracks all changes.  </s>
<s> If we can't make this document clear and easy to read, people won't read it!  </s>

<s> Blossom said (and Shawn similarly) under Increased Web Usage: "non-profit organization can receive more donations" - I think this is misleading.  </s>
<s> It suggests that donations are the prime reason for NGOs &amp; non-profits to have a web presence.  </s>
<s> In actual fact most of these organisations have web presences in order to spread their message better.  </s>
<s> So the emphasis should be to reach more supporters (rather than donors).  </s>

<s> Here is what I had sent to the list on Oct 23 for your consideration.  </s>
<s> Quantifying Benefits: Measuring impact on revenues, customer / audience reach, goodwill It will be very helpful to track website statistics that reveal : - number of hits on account of improved "searchability" of the website, - average time a visitor remains on the site - number of pages he / she visits - number of transactions successfully completed over the website, - number of cusstomers prefering to access support related content on the website, and - number of customers returning to the website to access content / conduct transactions.  </s>
<s> The above indicators are likely to register a change over time.  </s>
<s> Surveys and customer feedback too will be useful in estimating the increased number of computer access technology users / people with disabilities / senior citizens that the website is attracting on account of improved website accessibility.  </s>
<s> The increased diversity of the user population might be quite visible in some cases (for e.g. program registrants, job applicants, etc).  </s>
<s> Admittedly, this number may not be very accurate when the user of the website chooses not to reveal such information.  </s>
<s> Therefore, in some cases it may not be easy to isolate and precisely quantify the impact of an accessible website on the revenues, audience reach, market share and goodwill.  </s>
