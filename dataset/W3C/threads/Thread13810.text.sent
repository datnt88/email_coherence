Current thread on WAI-IG] Does anyone know what the various tool-tip implementations do if instead of IMG SRC="foo.blah" 
ALT="alternative_string" TITLE="tooltip_string" they encounter IMG SRC="images/blank.gif" ALT=" " TITLE="" ? 
Can one get a non-popup of the tool-tip by a null TITLE string? 
Or null ALT in the absense of TITLE? 
Al In article 199808182054.QAA01678@access2.digex.net 
, Al Gilman asgilman@access.digex.net 
writes IMG SRC="foo.blah" 
ALT="alternative_string" TITLE="tooltip_string" I'm not sure what your question is, Al. 
The fact that the IMG ALT is defined as a space is irrelevant. 
If TITLE is null, then no tooltip is appropriate. 
If in the example given a UA represents the space by a tooltip, that UA is BAD (Broken As Designed). 
I've been through all this before on www-html in the thread to which I referred. 
IMO IMG TAG should *never* be used as a tooltip, since it is ALTernative textual content to replace an image which is not available to the user agent, whereas tooltips are supplementary information. 
Provision of the former as the latter in an environment in which the original image has already been rendered merely provides confusing clutter in the display. 
For example - the case posed by the original poster in this thread. 
Regards Colin Reynolds, The Net Effect (World Wide) Ltd Yes, I think that part's clear. 
Seems to me, though, that there's an extra complication that hasn't been discussed. 
Consider an image used as an anchor link, as they often are. 
Then we in fact have three items (and their purposes are more or less as I give them here, I believe): 1. 
The IMG ALT - provides alternative text for the image 2. The IMG TITLE - provides supplementary information about the image itself, 3. The Anchor TITLE - provides supplementary information about the target of the anchor link. 
My question would be, how should these items be displayed or otherwise made available? 
There's general agreement that the ALT text must be displayed _instead_ of the IMG, when the IMG isn't viewed. 
MSIE uses item 2 as a tooltip. 
However, Opera (at least some versions) uses item 3 as the tooltip. 
I can see logic in both approaches. 
Should all three be somehow available, and if so, how? 
best regards
