<s> I've been working with Sean on the EARL Schema, and I've come up with this simplified model: :Sean earl:asserts { :page :altTag [ :result :Fail ; :confidence :High ; :comment "He put in a longDesc but forgot the alt for some reason."  </s>
<s> ; :date "2001-04-22" .  </s>
<s> Or in English: Sean asserts "page fails the altTag test".  </s>
<s> The basic concept is that an evaluator (a person or a tool) makes an assertion along the lines of: testSubject -test- Result This model can be considered analogous to the buttons on the bottom of pages that say "Validate This Page".  </s>
<s> They link from the page (testSubject) to the Result.  </s>
<s> The result includes more information about the output of the test, including comments, confidence, etc.  </s>
<s> While this would be the basics of the EARL assertion, further information, such as descriptions of the parties and tests involved could be included in the document or gathered from elsewhere.  </s>
<s> This improves extensibility greatly, since other parties can provide information about the evaluators, pages, and tests involved.  </s>
<s> An example would be: :page a :WebContent ; earl:testURI http://example.org/page  </s>
<s> ; earl:testDate "2000-04-22" .  </s>
<s> :Sean a :Person ; :name "Sean B. Palmer" ; :email mailto:sean@mysterylights.com .  </s>
<s> :altTag :name "Alt Tag" ; :comment "Test for an altTag on every image." ; :suite http://example.org/images/ .  </s>
<s> I'm not on the list, so please CC responses to me.  </s>
<s> Thanks.  </s>

<s> Aaron, could you reformulate the examples at with your model, so see how simpler it is ?  </s>
<s> (with all the bits, not a simplified n3 version like here) Sean, what do you think about Aaron's model ?  </s>
<s> Thanks  </s>
<s> It appears that Sean has already redone the examples to fit the model.  </s>
