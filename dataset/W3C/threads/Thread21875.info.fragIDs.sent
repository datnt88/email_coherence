<s> We collected a couple of ideas and statements during the W3C Quality Assurance Seminar, which I would like to present to the mailing list for further discussion.  </s>
<s> I wrote up the first draft from my memory and collected comments by all other participants.  </s>
<s> Right now, everything is collected in one big e-mail but if people are interested in certain aspects please copy the respective part and open up a separate mailing thread.  </s>
<s> Looking forward to feedback.  </s>
<s> -- Markus Summary of ideas collected by: MaryBrady [mb], NIST Jason Brittsan [jb], Microsoft Dimitris Dimitriadis [DD], Improve Markus Mielke [mm], Microsoft Technical details: * To decrease time in test suite development: 1. Provide a library of individual test cases contributed by members.  </s>
<s> These test cases may be of a specific language binding to speed up the process.  </s>
<s> Ideally, these test cases are already written and can be easily submitted.  </s>
<s> (OK; DD, MB.) 2. Develop a generic framework (using XML and transformation methods), which allows for multiple language bindings and automated test generation.  </s>
<s> (Being developed; DD.) a. NIST will provide an updated look at this language (2 weeks) * Modularization of test cases.  </s>
<s> The problem is that the DOM Spec explicitly calls out exceptions to allow multiple implementation systems to be compliant.  </s>
<s> For example, in DOM Level 1 there are notes for systems that do not support the concept of reporting exceptions and implementations that are HTML-Only or XML.  </s>
<s> The best way to incorporate these exceptions in the spec is by having a modularized test suit.  </s>
<s> [Categorization according to specification, being looked into; DD.] Yes, but maybe we should air some of the concerns on the dom-ts list and try to come to agreement on the categorization [mb] Suggestion for DOM Level 1: o Core: HTML-Only With Exceptions o Core: HTML-Only Without Exceptions o Core: XML With Exceptions o Core: XML Without Exceptions o HTML (Exceptions are not used in HTML) Dom Level 2: ??? Dom Level 3: ??? Would it be more useful to try to provide configurable exceptions - maybe a set of entity def's that captures exceptions thrown by a particular vendor, which are then used in the tests, or not check for exceptions at all in cases where the method used is optional.  </s>
<s> Doesn't the spec indicate that an exception must be thrown?  </s>
<s> [mb] The entity def approach could work, but it would require the XML file to be edited/regenerated every time the script error message changes.  </s>
<s> (I don't know how often this might happen).  </s>
<s> Also, the spec states "Some languages and object systems do not support the concept of exceptions.  </s>
<s> For such systems, error conditions may be indicated using native error reporting mechanisms."  </s>
<s> So, the spec says that an error must be thrown, but doesn't mandate that the error must be an exception.  </s>
<s> [jb] * Beside the test development currently in progress it is useful to have a test spec to give a quick overview of areas covered, allow the participants to verify the reasoning behind the grouping of tests and to expose possible holes in the coverage.  </s>
<s> (Definitely, Action item on me; DD.) Yes - I agree - I'll get a complete list of our semantic requirements together for you - you may be able to start from there.  </s>
<s> [mb] In addition to the semantic requirements, I think that a list of test cases is necessary.  </s>
<s> Also, a test matrix would be useful.  </s>
<s> [jb]  </s>
<s> * We need to guarantee platform independence of our tests.  </s>
<s> Tests should  </s>
<s> not rely on the tree structure unless explicitly specified by the spec.  </s>
<s> (I agree with the first sentence, not quite sure what you mean by the second; DD.) Are you pointing to the problems that are exposed as a result of whitespace issues and entity expansion issues?  </s>
<s> If so, do you think that this could be handled by toggling expected results based on whether an implementation has these features turned on or off, or is it more difficult?  </s>
<s> [mb]  </s>
<s> I think the issue being addressed here is that tests shouldn't expect elements in any particular order.  </s>
<s> For instance, a test should not  </s>
<s> expect a list of attributes on an element in any particular order.  </s>
<s> It should only expect that the attributes are present.  </s>
<s> [jb] Structural details: * To be successful in the future, we need a solid foundation of our testing structure.  </s>
<s> * We need a database for issue tracking.  </s>
<s> E-mail (even archived) is not sufficient.  </s>
<s> (W3C CVS; DD) The sooner we get this configured for our use and the proper folks have access to it, the better.  </s>
<s> [mb] CVS is strictly a source management system.  </s>
<s> There needs to be a web based issue (bug) tracking system that is available to all member of the dom-ts list.  </s>
<s> There are defect tracking tools available at * Test case submissions should be entered in a database to insure all submissions are tracked, backed up and easily accessible.  </s>
<s> This process should also incorporate a source control solution.  </s>
<s> (W3C Tracking system; DD) I'm not familiar with the W3C Tracking system - can I get more info?  </s>
<s> [mb] I believe this can be done with a combination of a source control utility (CVS) and a simple database for entering the date/time, submitter, case title, etc. [jb] * The desired XML test case description format should be published.  </s>
<s> It would also be helpful to provide a template and/or sample test cases.  </s>
<s> (Allow two weeks; DD) I agree, but there are some issues that we should probably discuss on the e-mail list - when we are fairly sure that what we have is sufficient, let's make it available officially, and have one place that we can all go to get the latest version - it may change slightly as we go along and uncover additional needs.  </s>
<s> [mb] Agreed.  </s>
<s> One centralized location and an official release are what we need.  </s>
<s> [jb] Open issues:  </s>
<s> * The idea is that the test suite is platform independent.  </s>
<s> How do we  </s>
<s> provide tests for definitions, like the attribute collection?  </s>
<s> The number of returned attributes is dependent on the DTD of the given platform.  </s>
<s> Is there a min-bar, like the attribute collections exists or not to validate these kinds of tests?  </s>
<s> (DD to W3C WG) Can you forward a concrete example of this in the form of a test?  </s>
<s> [mb] I think this issue goes along with the last bullet under technical details.  </s>
<s> Attaching a test case for the attributes collection: In IE, this case will alert approximately 80 attributes because assign all (or nearly all) attributes a default value of an empty string.  </s>
<s> Netscape 6 assigns no default attributes.  </s>
<s> A min-bar would dictate a minimum set of attributes that should be defined (either by default of by declaration).  </s>
<s> [jb]  </s>
<s> Watch out for terminology, since "element" is a key word when discussing XML... A test should certainly expect Elements to be in a particular order, since that's semantically meaningful and well-specified.  </s>
<s> There are specific kinds of Nodes that are not considered to be ordered, Attrs being the most obvious, and a test for those specific cases should confirm that the right things are appearing but not enforce order.  </s>
<s> web based issue (bug) tracking system  </s>
<s> Apache's started using Bugzilla again, now that some security and configuration concerns have been dealt with.  </s>
<s> I have no opinion on it versus other tools, but so far it seems to work and some folks may already be familiar with it.  </s>
<s> I don't think I understand this issue...  </s>
<s> The DTD's default attributes do get included in the result, certainly.  </s>
<s> But the DTD should be specified as part of the testcase, so that shouldn't be an issue.  </s>
<s> If you may be running against multiple DTDs (eg for HTML), either specify which one much be used for this test or enumerate what the results should be for each.  </s>
<s> Joe Kesselman / IBM Research  </s>
<s> The number of attributes returned, for example using a HTML document and a DIV tag depends on the respective DTD.  </s>
<s> I completely agree with you that the test case needs to specify, which one to use if a certain number is expected.  </s>
<s> As a minbar I would be satisfied if the attribute collection exists and returns workable values.  </s>
