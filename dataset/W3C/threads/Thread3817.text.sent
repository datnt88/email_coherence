Well, it seems we've got Dodji (libcroco author) joining us, so I guess we should make CSS a major agenda item. 
I'm not sure if that might pre-empt my next subject due to time constraints ... Another subject that has come up separately is collecting validation statistics. 
I'm thinking we could run a database at qa-dev, with Bjoern's MSIE toolbar feeding it data (at the option ot users of the toolbar). 
This idea arose out of a Usenet thread, and if we put it on the agenda, we might want to invite Michael Rozdoba to join us for it. 
On a separate note, why are there two separate lists of third-party contributors at /QA/Tools/qa-dev/ ? 
Wouldn't it be more equitable just to merge them? 
Nick Kew Interesting, though tricky, topic. 
We're just discussing about it on the IRC channel now, and unless you work on a given panel of pages, it's difficult to achieve. 
True, when I first made the page I first listed the people who had accounts on the qa-dev test server, then added other significant contributors. 
Merged now as people's contribution normally tends to fluctuate anyway, any attempt at a classification is silly. 
Wouldn't it be more equitable just to merge them? 
Not sure there is an equitable way anyway, but you had a point.
