Agreed! I love the new design. 
It's a keeper! 
-Brian Jay Kesecker II Hi, the new (25 Aug 2000) design of your front page is a big improvement from earlier, IMO. 
/Mats Nygren Overall, I like it. 
A few suggestions though... gotta suggest something... 
It would be handy to include links to the specs on the front page. 
for exmple, to reach the HTML 4.01spec, you have to click on HTML and hunt around... it's one quarter down the page ... unless you spot the HTML 4/3.2.0 link about 3/4 down the page... in which case you then have to click yet again. 
To make the list a bit quicker to scanyou could then nest items, e.g. o HTML - 4.01 spec - HTML Tidy - HTML Validator The HTML link goes to the home page of course. 
It would be convenient for people with screenreaders to have links at the top jumping to the index, news, and sitemap (or whatever to call the second column). 
Otherwise they have to tab through all those links on the left... 
You might want them to define a class that makes them hidden to keep the present look. 
It's good that you described the layout in the table summary, but the links would be more useful. 
I looked at the use of H2 and H3 (using the WAVE, and although they make the size of the type right, they don't really seem to be the logical choice. 
I'd suggest re-doing to use them in more logical order and then using CSS to get the sizes what you want. 
Aside from that though, which is getting into the details. 
good job!

However, we intend to address it by improving the TR page rather than putting more links on the home page. 
For instance, we'd like to allow users to search for specs by title, author, etc. 
That's a pending project... 
There are links at the top defined by the LINK element. 
Lynx renders these, for instance. 
But they are not rendered on the screen by most browsers. 
Ok, we'll look at that.
