There's been some discussion about getting rid of external entities in XML LANG. 
The main reason seems to be that the XML LINK solution seems to be better in some ways. 
I think we should keep them in XML LANG. 1) They're easy to understand in the XML LANG form 2) SGML tools already implement them, so fulfilling guideline 3 3) The only required part of XML is XML LANG. 
XML LINK is optional. 
Thus, any feature that goes from being required in XML LANG is, in effect, made completely optional. 
If it was important enough to put into XML LANG in the first place, why make it optional now? 
Lauren I hope my posting (SHOW="EMBED") didn't give this impression, because it wasn't meant to :-). 
There are many cases where I can see external entities being useful. 
The purpose of the posting was to ask 'IF someone uses this mechanism, what are the syntactic, structural and other consequences, 'cos XML-LINK is not very explicit' Agreed. 
I agree, and this should be constantly re-emphasised. 
4) they are easier to understand and implement than the XML-LINK/EMBED approach.
