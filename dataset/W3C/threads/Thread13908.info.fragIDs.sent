Hi, 
Is there a mechanism for saying that all tests in a suite were passed, other than the listed ones, I'm currently looking at something which might have many of thousands of tests, of which 95% will be passed, a certain few however won't, as long as they were tested, the passes aren't that interesting (I'll expect them to pass) so don't want them filling up my triple store etc. 
I don't recall any mechanism for this, other than perhaps grouping testsuites and saying that the group passed, which will reduce the number required, but make things more complicated, and I don't think the groupings can be sensibly designed until we have the information back on what's failing. 
Are there any options? 
Jim. 
ISTM your problem is in what is defined to be your test suite. 
If you want some tests to run but ignore the outcome, then derive a new test suite that defines every possible outcome as a pass for selected tests. 
Or am I missing the point?

Well, you have described the options. 
You could simply record the things that were failed, and define yourself a nearlyPassed result (I guess it is a subtype of fail) with the semantics that everything except those things listed as failed have been passed. 
In my tools the default result is (explicitly) notTested. 
You could set up your tools so the default is assumed to be passed, unless there is a fail result recorded, and then just not record the test-by-test results. 
Having a property like "nearlyPassed" to make this explicit is pretty similar. 
Do you think there are grounds for trying to include it in a new EARL draft?
