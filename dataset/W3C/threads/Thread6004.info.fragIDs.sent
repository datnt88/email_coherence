<s> I'd like to add some comments, and raise some questions, regarding  </s>
<s> Jean-Jacques Dubray's paper (http://www.ebpml.org/ebpml2.2.doc), which  </s>
<s> was discussed a bit in an earlier thread.  </s>
<s> If I can attempt a summary: Dubray's paper advocates separating message flow, data flow, and control flow definitions.  </s>
<s> This provides a  </s>
<s> separation of layers, without precluding the ability to model both  </s>
<s> interior and exterior flows.  </s>
<s> The control flow model is "pluggable", so that in fact the same framework could support different kinds of control flow modelling - the examples use BPSS, but this isn't required.  </s>
<s> A few comments: Generally, this seems to be an interesting and valuable approach.  </s>
<s> It leverages some of the work that has gone into ebXML, which is one of the more sophisticated B2B frameworks.  </s>
<s> The paper envisions that business transactions could involve an  </s>
<s> exchange of multiple messages, that these could be asynchronous, and  </s>
<s> that correlation between messages may therefore be necessary.  </s>
<s> I think  </s>
<s> these are necessary features to support, but the examples don't really  </s>
<s> demonstrate how to support them, as far as I can tell.  </s>
<s> Transactions  </s>
<s> are also identified as being out of scope (p. 15).  </s>
<s> The DataFlow example (p. 15) seems to me overly simple.  </s>
<s> It shows data inputs and outputs connected by XSLT transformations.  </s>
<s> This is useful,  </s>
<s> but it's only one example of what could be a complex transformation,  </s>
<s> possibly involving iteration and other workflow concepts.  </s>
<s> This being the case, is it useful to distinguish a data flow from a control flow?  </s>
<s> (The diagram on p. 15 actually confuses the two, because there's a  </s>
<s> comment indicating that a "Control flow" is starting, but the tag that begins it is called "DataFlow", although its end tag is "ControlFlow").  </s>
<s> It would be interesting to see in more detail whether, and how, something like BPEL4WS could be fit into this framework - I understand that they're fundamentally different approaches, but to the extent that they're attacking the same problem, it ought to be possible to take a BPEL4WS model and re-express its essentials in this framework.  </s>
<s> There is mention at the end of the paper of three planned followup papers - are any of these available?  </s>
<s> --Jon  </s>
<s> BPEL4WS, BPML, WSCI, etc are based on processes defined for each communicating agent, dating back to the model proposed in CSP and  </s>
<s> later  </s>
<s> refined in pi-calculus and other works in that space.  </s>
<s> BPSS and EBPML  </s>
<s> prefer  </s>
<s> to express processes as a centralized sequence of exchanges and then  </s>
<s> each  </s>
<s> agent has to derive its process by extracting all activities related  </s>
<s> to some  </s>
<s> role.  </s>
<s> I think there's conversion from one to the other, but I don't have  </s>
<s> evidence  </s>
<s> that you can move from the CSP model to the centralized one and back  </s>
<s> without  </s>
<s> losing some information.  </s>
<s> I don't think it is accurate to describe BPSS as "centralized".  </s>
<s> It was derived from the UNCEFACT Business Collaboration  </s>
<s> Protocol metamodel, which is a state-alignment protocol.  </s>
<s> That is, the protocol is intended to align the states of  </s>
<s> "common knowledge" or mutually-agreed-upon state machines, which may be implemented using the Half-Object-Plus-Protocol pattern.  </s>
<s> (Nothing centralized.)  </s>
<s> The protocol does make a distinction between external collaborations (whose states must be aligned)  </s>
<s> and internal activities (whose states are none of  </s>
<s> anybody else's business).  </s>
<s> So if you took a model which included both external and internal activities (in this sense), and moved to BPSS, the BPSS representation would only include the external activities.  </s>
<s> That does not mean the internal activies would be lost.  </s>
<s> It's just a separation of concerns.  </s>
<s> -Bob Haugen  </s>
<s> I think that what Assaf is expressing is that BPSS and the paper I  </s>
<s> published on ebPML.org  </s>
<s> describe message exchange with no specific point  </s>
<s> of view (from a party perspective), therefore appearing to be at the  </s>
<s> "center".  </s>
<s> Because these approaches are point of view neutral, they do  </s>
<s> not suffer from the same "centricity" syndrome that characterize BPEL4WS, BPML or even WSCI.  </s>
<s> In BPEL4WS one describe a collaboration by specifying the message exchanges from his/her point of view.  </s>
<s> Of course the other business partners have to have a mirror definition such that it works.  </s>
<s> As I said earlier, WSCI offers a little more flexibility via the "global model" concept borrowed from WSFL, but in essence WSCI does exactly like BPEL4WS, it forces each party to describe the collaboration from his/her point of view.  </s>
<s> So instead of introducing this notion of "centralized sequence of  </s>
<s> exchange" I think it is fair to say that BPSS offers a "neutral" view of  </s>
<s> the choreography while BPEL/BPML and WSCI offers and "interface-bound" or "party-specific" view of the collaboration.  </s>
<s> In all cases, the goal is more or less to achieve state alignment  </s>
<s> between collaborating parties.  </s>

<s> It's the chicken and egg problem and neither spec is free of that.  </s>
<s> In BPML you would describe the internal procedural workflow.  </s>
<s> But we are not  </s>
<s> positioning BPML as a choreography language, we are positioning it as a  </s>
<s> language to describe - in loose terms - the internal procedural workflow.  </s>
<s> Then it's up to you to decide whether to begin with a choreography (in BPSS or WSCI) and build a workflow, or whether to decide that the choreography should support your existing workflow.  </s>
<s> You can make that decision then write a BPSS to support your workflow, can't you?  </s>
<s> It's really a matter of best practice, and I've heard at least once the claim that since some system has an implementation the interface could be expressed using BPSS in order to communicate with it, in effect binding the choreography to the workflow.  </s>
<s> Let's not confuse best practices with models.  </s>
<s> No. But where do you read about 'internal activities'?  </s>
<s> arkin  </s>
<s> Assaf:  </s>
<s> [JJ] I think that we had already concluded that this is not really such  </s>
<s> a problem.  </s>
<s> Clearly what ever is the outcome, the specification need to  </s>
<s> allow for starting from either point of view: collaboration or  </s>
<s> executable business process and derive the other one.  </s>
<s> I don't think it  </s>
<s> is an issue anyways: how could we design a technology that does not allow for that?  </s>
<s> You don't seem to speak about the third level (long-running behavior of  </s>
<s> system components).  </s>
<s> Any thoughts on that level?  </s>
<s> JJ-  </s>
<s> Absolutely right.  </s>
<s> I do assume that we're talking about long-running behavior all along which  </s>
<s> explains a lot of the complexity of the spec.  </s>
<s> In a long-running behavior you would have complex flows that are chained to  </s>
<s> each other.  </s>
<s> You can capture a simple flow with something like a sequence,  </s>
<s> but that doesn't extend well.  </s>
<s> You will probably want to break the complex  </s>
<s> flow into smaller flows and chain them together, which is where we introduce  </s>
<s> spawn and call*.  </s>
<s> In a long-running behavior you would also have flows that repeat multiple  </s>
<s> times within some state and that may be subject to how many messages are  </s>
<s> exchanged (or in reverse, capture the message exchange), which explains the  </s>
<s> need for nested processes.  </s>
<s> And of course you need to address the time issue, whether you want to  </s>
<s> express a minimal passage of time (e.g. delay) or put a time constraint on  </s>
<s> the completion of a flow (e.g. onTimeout).  </s>
<s> And probably some other requirements.  </s>
<s> Anything specific?  </s>
<s> arkin * The notion of recursive composition which is captured in this way and also  </s>
<s> with nested processes is very interesting, since it allows you to draw  </s>
<s> conclusions about a fine grained entities, then about a composition including multiple entities, and a composition including multiple  </s>
<s> compositions, and so forth.  </s>
<s> Seeing how formal process models do it, we've  </s>
<s> structured the language in a similar manner to allow the same form of  </s>
<s> recursive composition/analysis.  </s>
<s> I think a lot of this may be necessary, but (to revisit an earlier issue  </s>
<s> raised on the list) I'm not sure that the requirements for choreography  </s>
<s> necessitate a full-blown workflow modelling language.  </s>
<s> In fact, I have  </s>
<s> some concern that the existing proposals may be overly complex for  </s>
<s> modelling useful types of WS interaction (especially in a B2B context),  </s>
<s> while being less than adequate for more general worklow purposes, in  </s>
<s> which not everything is directly in service of a WS message exchange.  </s>
<s> Which is why the proposal to separate specification of message flow from  </s>
<s> control flow was attractive, at least IMO.  </s>
