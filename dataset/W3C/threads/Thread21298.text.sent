After using the spiffy new CVS server (Thanks!) I decided to try and run the cwm tests locally. 
I ended up with a whole bunch of fails that looked like this: - xmlns:t="file:/cygdrive/c/devel/WWW/2000/10/swap/test/test#" + xmlns:t="file:/Users/aaronsw/Projects/cwm/swap/test/test#" Looks like a good place for relative URIs to me. 
Thanks, [ Aaron Swartz | me@aaronsw.com

Sigh.

Then can we just move them to W3.org-space?
