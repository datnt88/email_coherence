I know this isn't on topic exactly... Does anybody know of any utilities that will take HTML and compile it to a standard Windows HLP file? 
Thanks... Matt What a revolting thought! 
The closest Microsoft tool would be at: -- Dave I'm not a Windows user, and I had a suspicion there is a Mac tool that can do this. 
I did a quick search for "HTML to HLP", and found the following link which might be of interest to you : Regards, Terry There certainly are commercial products such as RoboHELP (from EHelp.com) and ForeHELP that will take in web pages and hierarchies and turn them into compiled HTML Help (.chm). 
They are not for the light of wallet, but they do work. 
Microsoft offers their "free" HTML Help Workshop ( http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/tools/htmlhelp/chm/hh1start.htm ), but it requires a lot of extra work to use that productively.

There are even freeware utilities that do to a certain extent, both to .hlp and .chm.

Dear all, Terry wrote talking about cross-platform end-of-line problems. 
I use BBEdit on the Macintosh which deals transparently with either standard. 
The very basic text editor that comes with the Mac - "Simpletext", equivalent I guess to Win95's "Notepad" - displays small boxes at the start of line if a DOS format file is loaded, and makes a mess of Unix files, as it doesn't recognise their eol $0A's. 
However, Simpletext is so limited that I would be surprised if anyone used it for editing HTML files, especially given that there is a cut-down version of BBEdit available free! 
Another contributor to the list recently pointed out that the HTML spec actually specifies the DOS standard CR/LF format for best compatibility. 
Even though there is a small file-size overhead in this old "teletype" standard, it is none-the-less the standard, and said overhead is really quite small. 
For my two cents' worth, I would recommend detecting any of the end-of-line formats incoming, storing them internally by whatever means, and writing out the CR/LF on output. 
We seem to be going down the road of having a multitude of configurable options on Tidy, so if the rest of the group wanted to be able to output either the Mac or Unix standard instead, then I wouldn't be too unhappy to have an option to allow them to do that. 
However, Tidy was created to make legal files, so shouldn't it really stick to the spec?

Well no, it doesn't. 
Here's what it says: On the Internet, some platforms use carriage return line feed pairs for line breaks, some use just line feeds, and others just carriage returns. 
As a result, HTML user agents should consider both isolated line feed and carriage return chracters as line breaks, with carriage return line feed pairs treated as single line breaks. 
That is, new line = CR LF | CR {not followed by LF} | LF. Concerning line break after img src="... , the specification goes on to say in the very next paragraph A line break occurring immediately following a start tag should be discarded, as should a line break occurring immediately before an end tag. 
This applies to all HTML elements without exception. 
That is to say, any HTML user agent (browser) that treats img src='foo/bar' and the best of luck" in any way differently from img src='foo/bar' and the best of luck" is ***wrong***, "without exception" a line break "should be discarded" "immediately following a start tag" such as img... . 
Tidy is within its rights putting a line break there. 
Since there are broken browsers out there, it may be unwise for Tidy to insist on its rights, but let's be clear about where the fault lies.
