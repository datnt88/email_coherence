<s> Hi Guys, I agree with Stanislaw.  </s>
<s> Clearly the interface of a service doesn't tell us what it does.  </s>
<s> For example we can have two services double sqr(double) and double sqtrt(double) that have the same interface but do radically different things; of course we can have another service : double arbitary(double) that does anything at all!  </s>
<s> On the other hand I would say that there is another alternative, which is to write the interface declaratively; this permits interpretation on the fly of the semantic of the service interface.  </s>
<s> Si.  </s>

<s> The answer is clearly YES.  </s>
<s> However, I doubt that the concept of service type has much to do with "meaning on the Web," except for very loose concepts of "meaning."  </s>
<s> Expressing the type of service requires that service providers and service requesters use the same language, and that it can be shown that P- R, where P is the description published by the provider, and R is the description posted by the requester.  </s>
<s> That is, the "broker" that brings the provider and requester together should be able to verify that if the provider provides a service satisfying P, it will satisfy R, this requester's particular requirement.  </s>
<s> This is a purely inferential task, and has nothing to do with "meaning."  </s>
<s> Of course, to prove that P- R, it may be necessary to make use of background information (i.e., axioms) relating the terms of P and R, but those axioms don't get us any closer to "meaning."  </s>
<s> I think you're being too hard on DAML-S.  </s>
<s> Its notion of _profile_ is supposed to be an independent characterization of a service in a formal language, namely, RDF + OWL (or its predecessors).  </s>
<s> Because OWL is a description logic, P- R becomes "class P subsumes class R."  </s>
<s> Of course, the "roots of the Semantic Web" are always of interest, and perhaps not grown as deeply as we'd like them to be, but one can pursue service descriptions independently of the pursuit of better foundations for the SW. -- Drew McDermott Professor of Computer Science Yale University  </s>
<s> Perhaps the ws-chor is not the right forum to discuss such fundamental problems.  </s>
<s> However, IMHO the idea of web services can not be realized without proposing a practical solution to the problem of meaning.  </s>
<s> Let me explain this claim.  </s>
<s> It is clear that communication between service requester and service provider is necessary.  </s>
<s> Note that both the requester and provider are supposed to be applications.  </s>
<s> The communication is realized at several levels.  </s>
<s> So that there must be interoperability at the transport level (e.g., HTTP), as well as at the message format level (e.g., SOAP, but I do not like it).  </s>
<s> There must be also interoperability at the message contents level, i.e., there must be a common contents language.  </s>
<s> The language is for expressing requests (on the side of requester), service types (on the side of providers), arranging service invocation, and perhaps for much much more.  </s>
<s> Language alone is merely a syntax.  </s>
<s> You are right that formal inference and axioms has nothing (or little) to do with "meaning."  </s>
<s> IMO, meaning is not a thing that is here or there.  </s>
<s> I like very much the Wittgenstein's thesis that the meaning of language is in its use.  </s>
<s> Hence, the meaning is realized as the consensus on how to use the primitive concepts of the language.  </s>
<s> The consensus is a never ending process; some new concepts are introduced (according to some fixed conventions) whereas some old ones disappear.  </s>
<s> New complex notions are created as abstractions of the existing ones.  </s>
<s> The crucial point is to start the process from the very roots, i.e., from the really primitive concepts and to specify explicitly the abstraction rules.  </s>
<s> I did some practical (however, still initial) work towards this direction; see the documentation at http://www.ipipan.waw.pl/mas/enTish  </s>
<s> As to DAML-S, one still missing point (IMO, the crucial one) is the definition of well formed formulae to express precondition and effect of service invocation.  </s>
<s> IMO, precondition and effect formula together may (should!) serve for expressing the complete type of a service, i.e., also service interface.  </s>

<s> As to DAML-S, one still missing point (IMO, the crucial one) is the definition of well formed formulae to express precondition and effect of service invocation.  </s>
<s> We do provide a proposal (in an appendix) for how to add these.  </s>
<s> The reason the proposal is tentative is that we wanted to stay within RDF, and you simply can't do that without stretching the framework at some point.  </s>
<s> Our proposal is to indulge in a little reification, which means that an ordinary RDF processor will miss the formulas.  </s>
<s> (And that the encoding of the formulas is rather obese.) IMO, precondition and effect formula together may (should!) serve for expressing the complete type of a service, i.e., also service interface.  </s>
