<s> Hello , I have a question about compatibility with the "DOM Level 0".  </s>
<s> What dos it exactley mean ? is it that "DOM Level 0" is implemented in a script language which is implemented in Internet Explorer III or Netscape III .  </s>
<s> thanks for your answer.  </s>

<s> That's right.  </s>
<s> It's a shorthand for "the script language support for HTML that is common to Netscape 3.x and IE 3.x".  </s>
<s> It was never formally defined, and I suspect that whatever links we had to various Netscape documents are long dead.  </s>
<s> Basically, the DOM WG tried, as much as possible, to not "break" dynamic HTML programs that ran on the 3.0 browsers.  </s>
<s> "DOM Level 0" is defined in the Glossary section of the Level 2 spec.  </s>
