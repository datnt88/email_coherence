I've created a page for the F2F with a first cut at a suggeted Agenda at: Brian Thanks. 
I'd like to make some comments on it, since out F2F time is so valuable, I think it's important to plan it out carefully: Wed, August 1st (all day), @@ room, Bldg @@ 1030 Establishing a context - users of RDF - PRISM? 
1050 - MUSICBRAINZ? 
1110 - DAML+OIL? 
Rael Dornfest and I would be happy to give a to give a short talk on RSS and its use of RDF. 1145 Presentation of the model theory 1300 Lunch 1400 Abstract Syntax Issues I'm unclear on the difference between model theory and abstract syntax. 
Can someone clarify? 
1545 Short Presentations - 10 mins each on interesting stuff we are doing I'm curious on the goal of this for the Working Group -- i.e. how does this help us? 
0900 More Issues I assume the issues will be decided ahead of time, or will they be issues about the mode theory / abstract syntax brought up the other day? 
1045 short presentations What will these presentations be on?

Excellent. 
Are you also up for MusicBrainz? 
1545 Short Presentations - 10 mins each on interesting stuff we are doing I'm open minded if this is a good idea or not. 
I had a couple of things in mind. 
One was to break the day up a bit, provide a bit of light relief. 
Another was just to share cool stuff - the short presentations have been very successful at recent events I've attended. 
Another was just to keep reminding us of what folks are doing with this stuff as debate the intricacies of skolem functions and the like. 
0900 More Issues I'd like to be as well prepared as possible, though new issues may emerge on the day. 
1045 short presentations If folks are up for this, the idea was to call for volunteers. 
Brian Of course!
