<s> The first question from is basically, does anyone use bagID?  </s>
<s> I know the CARMEN project / MathNet uses bagID with RDF/XML and Dublin Core.  </s>
<s> See the PDF report from Feb 2002  </s>
<s> (in German) for rdf:bagID in the examples and more at Searching for "rdf:bagID" on google I find more uses in various projects, it isn't clear how extensive.  </s>
<s> Tim provides no new information why this syntax should be removed.  </s>
<s> On the second part: The WG was chartered to clarify M&amp;S.  </s>
<s> It wasn't chartered to remove bits of the syntax (though it has done so in other instance where clarification was difficult).  </s>
<s> -- quoting Brian from Dave  </s>
<s> I think this document enhances Tim's case.  </s>
<s> The only occurrence of bagID in the doc is to create a bag that has a matching aboutEach - which we axed.  </s>
<s> Moreover, judging from the surrounding RDF/XML the document author appears to want every triple generated within the XML element to be reified into the bag, rather than only the toplevel triples (as we clarified).  </s>
<s> i.e. this document shows a use of a construct that is not bagID which is useful with a construct which is not RDF. bagID was an ugly sibling to aboutEach and should have been chopped at the same time.  </s>

<s> ht_ap6.pdf  </s>
<s> It isn't the only one, it is just one I knew of, there were hundreds (I didn't bother to count) more references on google.  </s>
<s> and I agreed with you - at the time.  </s>
<s> I also put off implementing rdf:bagID in my parser, expecting we would kill it.  </s>
<s> But we didn't.  </s>
<s> This point is, the WG made the decision so what new information is there to remove it?  </s>
<s> That we removed aboutEach?  </s>
<s> No, that was before.  </s>
<s> If we were to remove it, we would owe people a good reason and would have to make sure it really wasn't used or useful.  </s>
<s> If we were having another last call syntax WD, it would mean new LC WD test cases, LC WD primer to follow the changes, probably not the others in this case.  </s>
