<s> Comments on DOM Level 3 Core Specification based on 09 June, 2003 version of the spec  </s>
<s> 1. Section 1.2.4: (DOMObject): "The DOMUserData type is used to store an application object." - DOMUserData in the above sentence needs to be changed to DOMObject  </s>
<s> 2. Section 1.3.1:  </s>
<s> "The DOM Level 3 Load and Save module provides a serialization mechanism and uses the 'normalize-characters' and 'check-character-normalization' to assure that text is fully-normalized.  </s>
<s> - 'normalize-characters' and '?heck-character-normalization' are used in the spec in the above sentence before defining them.  </s>
<s> Therefore it is not clear what is meant by them.  </s>
<s> Probably, it is required to rephrase this statement to say that these are configuration features and add a link to DOMConfiguration section.  </s>
<s> 3. Interface DOMStringList: "The DOMStringList interface provides the abstraction of an ordered collection of parallel pairs of name and namespace values..." Isn't this a collection of DOMStrings ?  </s>
<s> If yes, the spec needs to be corrected.  </s>
<s> If not, it is not clear whether name or namespace should be returned by the method item(in index).  </s>
<s> This interface could be moved to Validation spec as it is used only in Validation spec.  </s>
<s> 4. Interface NameList: This interface too can be moved to Validation spec as it is used only in Validation spec.  </s>
<s> 5. Interface DOMImplementationSource: The two apis getDOMImplementation and getDOMImplementations could cause confusion.  </s>
<s> I would prefer if a more distinct name is used.  </s>
<s> e.g getDOMImplementationList (Similarly, I would prefer if getFeatures is changed to getFeatureList)  </s>
<s> 6. Interface Document: - xmlStandalone: To be consistent with the other attributes, probably it should be added that "This attribute is false when unspecified".  </s>
<s> "ELEMENT_NODE: specified attribute nodes of the source element are adopted and the generated Attr nodes." - This sentence (in adoptNode) looks incomplete.  </s>
<s> Probably it should be rephrased.  </s>
<s> 7. Interface Text : "If the Text node is a direct child of the Document node, ..." - Document can have only Element, ProcessingInstruction, Comment, DocumentType.  </s>
<s> So a text node can not be a direct child of the Document node.  </s>
<s> "isWhitespaceInElementContent: Returns whether this text contains whitespace in element content" - It is not clear whether the text should be returned when it contains "any" whitespace or when it has "all" whitespace as its element content.  </s>
<s> 8. Interface DOMConfiguration: "However when the feature 'LS' is defined in [DOM Level 3 Load and Save] is supported by DOM Implementation, the parameter 'resource-resolver'can also be used in DOMConfiguration.  </s>
<s> - The parameter 'resource-resolver' is removed from DOM Level 3 Load and Save spec and therefore this sentence needs to be removed.  </s>
<s> Thanks, Anjana  </s>

<s> But it may be used by the application coder even if he doesn't use the Validation module.  </s>
<s> I believe the only good usecase for having Text nodes beeing a direct child of Document is, that you can reproduce the original document structure.  </s>
<s> These Text nodes shall contain of course ONLY whitespaces (#9, #10, #12).  </s>

<s> The purpose of having NameList in the Core draft is to allow its reuse in an other DOM module, different from the DOM Validation one.  </s>

<s> removed "and the generated Attr nodes".  </s>
<s> Since the specified are adopted,  </s>
<s> no Attr node is generated.  </s>
<s> Attr nodes may be generated if you have  </s>
<s> default attributes, but this is reflected in the following sentence: Default attributes are discarded, though if the document being adopted into defines default attributes for this element name, those are assigned.  </s>
<s> correct.  </s>
<s> The sentence has been removed.  </s>
<s> This inconsistency was also reported by Colin Paul Adams at: I did not add this on the Core issues list since it is an error in the LS draft.  </s>
<s> [Other issues were added to the Core issues list] Philippe  </s>
<s> Correct, except that the DOM specification, since DOM Level 1, explicitly prevents you from having Text nodes as direct children of a Document node: The node types, and which node types they may have as children, are as follows: * Document -- Element (maximum of one), ProcessingInstruction, Comment, DocumentType Philippe  </s>
<s> We renamed getDOMImplementations to getDOMImplementationList.  </s>
<s> There is no method getFeatures.  </s>
<s> Philippe  </s>
<s> This method maps directly to the Infoset property "element-content-whitespace".  </s>
<s> In fact, in order to avoid the debate of "whitespace" vs "white space" for the name of this method, we renamed it isElementContentWhitespace, and added a link to the Infoset.  </s>
