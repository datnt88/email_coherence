<s> Hi, I just downloaded the new Amaya 1.3b for Linux, which has really improved a lot.  </s>
<s> Now displaying documents is faster than with 1.3a, and as in 1.3a most of the new entities called by names (codes like &amp;#8733; never work and there exist some exceptions like &amp;dagger; or &amp;permil;) are displayed correctly.  </s>
<s> I have tested this with the WWW manual "HPAM 1.12": The following list contains things which may be improved in later versions: 1) When displaying a special position in a web document and clicking on 'reload', the beginning of the file is displayed.  </s>
<s> Changing large web pages one has to go to the interesting position every time.  </s>
<s> It would be good to store the position and go to it automatically after reloading.  </s>
<s> 2) The ZOOM factor still has to be three on my 1024x768 display (14.1" TFT), and the images are zoomed by the same factor (which looks not so good).  </s>
<s> I would appreciate if zooming of pictures and text could be decoupled.  </s>
<s> 3) I miss the blinking of text (like an exclamation mark etc.) - this is much better than using animated GIFs or Java applets.  </s>
<s> Maybe it would be nice if Amaya will support blinking in CSS and also by the 'BLINK' tag (which has become a pseudo standard).  </s>
<s> [I know that W3C CSS 2.0 specification says "Conforming user agents are not required to support this value" and that it is not part in HTML RECs (and will never be for the sake of CSS), but good browsers should support frequently used features.]  </s>
<s> 4) In unordered lists (UL) there is the option 'TYPE="NONE"' (which is not given in the HTML 4.0 specs [only a Netscape spcial???], but supported via CSS 2.0 REC by 'list-style-type: none;', also not supported by 1.3b).  </s>
<s> I also missed the functions of the options 'VALIGN="CENTER"' in 'TD' and 'ALIGN="LEFT"' in 'HR' (used in combination with 'WIDTH="33%"').  </s>
<s> 5) If images/tables are wider than the browser window, horizontal scrolling is not possible.  </s>
<s> I would appreciate if the next release of Amaya and the intended new features would be announced fully on the Amaya web page.  </s>
<s> Thanks a lot for your help - and developing such a nice tool, Jochen M. Braun  </s>

<s> Hello, just a short note: I've found that some menu items on the AIX binary found on the W3 distribution site are somewhat hard to use.  </s>
<s> E.g., when I request the structure view I end up with the alternate view and vice versa.  </s>
<s> Simillar problems are there with color/font palette and within the sub menues, for isntance cite/code are swaped.  </s>
<s> note: I don't need an urgent fix, right now I'm using it just for me and I can customize myself ;-) But it would be a good idea to fix that, the way it is, I can hardly recoment it to gui people.  </s>

<s> Blinking is very expensive without special hardware support.  </s>
<s> It's OK for Windows 95 products aimed at single users who are assumed to have dedicated high spec machines; its not a good idea for a multi-user system.  </s>
<s> In the general case, the most efficient implementation may be to maintain two copies of the window bitmap and copy them, to swap them, twice for each blink.  </s>
<s> I think this is probably why it is considered optional.  </s>
<s> I think any browser that supports BLINK needs to have a global option to disable it.  </s>

<s> around.  </s>
<s> Those routes (motion gifs, java...) always use much more resources.  </s>
<s> Please provide such a tag so brouwsers can implement the shortest routes to the action requested or provide substitutes for it.  </s>
<s> The requires much more overhead than the required blinking!  </s>
<s> With this route YOU implement the blinking.  </s>
<s> With the tag, the brouwser implements the blinking (and it has the option to disable it)  </s>
<s> Here you are: With a BLINK tag, you can disable it.  </s>
<s> With your provided options, it is not possible to disable it.  </s>
<s> The alternatives to BLINK I can think of are: ALTERNATE: display 2 separate things (text, pictures, etc) alternating.  </s>
<s> This gives the power to blink between BOLD and normal or ITALICS and normal.  </s>
<s> This can be used for blinking: alternate between text and nothing.  </s>
<s> ROULATE: display multiple separate things (text, pictures, etc) roulating: this gives the power to blink between BOLD, normal, ITALICS, UNDERLINE etc. CB Is reading in the bathroom considered Multi-Tasking?  </s>

<s> What I'm describing here is how a browser would need to implement blinking.  </s>
<s> If you want Amaya to blink, then Amaya has to either copy over the whole window twice for each blink, or copy over all of the blinking elements twice for each blink.  </s>
<s> The latter option is more efficient for small amounts of blinking but would be a lot more expensive for extensive use of blinking.  </s>
<s> You get blinking free on some character cell terminals, because there is an attribute for each character and the hardware combines a blinking clock with that attribute and the display data in a gate.  </s>
<s> Bitmap type displays generally don't have a plane reserved for a blinking attribute, so require the whole of the blinking areas to be updated for each blink.  </s>

<s> I don't think Amaya should implement blinking.  </s>
<s> It should just accept it and refer to a stylesheet what to do with it, with a default for 'do-nothing'.  </s>
<s> What do browsers which accept blinking while they print the blinking text?  </s>
<s> What does Amaya if bold is required and the characterset does not provide it?  </s>
<s> Here again, I see 2 alternates: ignore blinking or change it to something else.  </s>
<s> Amaya, btw, has the 'alternate' view which represents a terminal.  </s>
<s> Since this (looks like) usage of a terminal(-emulator) just go for blinking as specified in the terminal(-emulator).  </s>

<s> The AIX version of Amaya in a 1.3a release and uses 1.3b configuration files.  </s>
<s> The problem seems to come from a network problem when the release 1.3b has been done.  </s>
