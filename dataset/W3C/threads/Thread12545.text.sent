The latest working draft of ATAG 2.0 has been posted to the W3C Technical Reports page. 
We'll notify the WAI Interest Group of this tomorrow. 
Thanks to everyone for the hard work on this draft. 
We may be ready to move this to the next level. 
m A lot of point refer to ISO TS 16071. 
In guideline 1, for eg: the success criteria is: The authoring tool interface must conform to [ISO16071]. 
Question: ISO TS 16071 is a "pay-per-view" document, so this is a "close" specification (u can access only if you pay). 
Do u think that ISO can make it available also for free consultation?

m "The authoring tool interface must conform to [ISO16071]". the link refer to the: ISO/TS 16071:2002 but in the ISO web site there is the: ISO/TS 16071:2003 Anyone knows the differences? 
The abstract referenced in the link mentioned uses ISO16071:2002 date. 
The reference used in ATAG is 2002(E) Thank u Tim for the reply. 
In the ISO Web site if I wanna buy i can buy the 2003 edition, not 2002.... :(
