<s> Hello, As per my action item of [1], here's a proposed NEW checkpoint about form orientation based on Gregory Rosmaita's original proposal [2].  </s>
<s> (It resembles checkpoint 9.6 of [3], for links).  </s>
<s> Provide information about the structure and navigation mechanisms specified for a form.  </s>
<s> [Priority 2].  </s>
<s> For instance, provide information about controls with explicitly associated labels, about which keys activate the form controls, about the serial navigation order of the form controls, and about control groups (e.g., in HTML specified with the FIELDSET and OPTGROUP elements).  </s>
<s> We should also include cross-references about device-independent activation and navigation.  </s>
<s> Since checkpoint 9.10 deals with labels, it could be subsumed by this proposed checkpoint.  </s>
<s> Checkpoint 9.10 reads: Provide the user with access to any label explicitly associated with a form control.  </s>

<s> aloha, jon and ian!  </s>
<s> i have no problem with using Ian's re-wording of my proposed checkpoint as a substitute for the current checkpoint on form controls... as a matter of fact, it captures the intent far more eloquently and thoroughly than my original proposal -- thanks, ian!  </s>
