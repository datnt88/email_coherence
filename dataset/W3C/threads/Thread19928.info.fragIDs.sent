<s> Hi, Does amaya's printing/postscript generating engine support "page-break-before" yet?  </s>
<s> (is it planned?) (I'm somewhat inexperienced/ ignorant about web concepts so sorry if this easy...) I did try several thinks (included below) and searched the w3 web site and mail archives.  </s>
<s> I did not see anything specifically say amaya supports this.  </s>
<s> I did see a couple of "this is how you do it, but I don't know if any browsers support it..." I'm running on Redhat 6.1 Linux.  </s>
<s> (I did check that netscape 4.7 does not  </s>
<s> support it.) (Maybe someone knowns of an "html2ps" that supports controlling page-breaks) Thanks for any suggestions,  </s>
<s> Ron Things I've tried with amaya: In the html (various combinations of inclusion of): STYLE type="text/css" media="print" H2 { page-break-before: always } And in the stylesheet H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, H6 { page-break-before: auto; /* the default */ page-break-inside: avoid; /* no page breaks inside... */ page-break-after: avoid; /* ... or after */ H1, H2 { page-break-before: always; /* begin new chapters; overrides previous rule */ BR.page { page-break-before: always } @media print { H1, H2 { page-break-before: always } BR.page { page-break-before: always } Could someone please help?  </s>
<s> Thanks, Ron  </s>
<s> IE 4+ does.  </s>
<s> Note that html2ps is the name of a specific program which may well also support it, or permit easy addition of the feature.  </s>
<s> Hi, Amaya doesn't implement "page-break-before" yet.  </s>
<s> The thotlib is able to do that, but we didn't find the time to add the needed glue between the CSS parser to thotlib.  </s>
