<s> Hi, In DOM Level 2 Core, it is not clear which of several possible Exceptions a method should raise.  </s>
<s> Example: DocumentType::replaceChild (inherited from Node) Possible exception codes listed in the recommendation are HIERARCHY_REQUEST_ERR, WRONG_DOCUMENT_ERR, NO_MODIFICATION_ALLOWED_ERR, NOT_FOUND_ERR.  </s>
<s> Supposed that newChild is from the right document, all error conditions except WRONG_DOCUMENT_ERR apply.  </s>
<s> (DocumentType is always readonly) Which of these exception codes should be chosen, and what is the rule that should be followed here?  </s>
<s> (DocumentType::replaceChild is far from being the only method affected) Thanks for any suggestions, Tobias Peters  </s>
<s> See recent discussion in this list.  </s>
<s> If the operation if always illegal with these two node types, no matter what the values of those nodes are otherwise, it should probably be reported as a hierarchy error, and most existing DOMs seem to do it that way simply because it's easiest to code... but it isn't clear that the DOM has completely nailed this down.  </s>

<s> hello, everyone!  </s>
<s> I have a question about SystemID of DOCType in Document, is there any standard style about it? the following is a DOCType sample, but when I use DocumentBuilder to parse the XML file, it reports there an error about the DOCType of the XML file.  </s>
<s> !DOCTYPE ejb-jar PUBLIC "-//Sun Microsystems, Inc.//DTD Enterprise JavaBeans 1.1//EN" "http://java.sun.com/j2ee/dtds/ejb-jar_1_1.dtd  </s>
<s> Is there anyone can give me some advices ?  </s>
<s> Chaingun Best regards !  </s>
<s> Additional information about this issue: If I changed the DOCType to : !DOCTYPE ejb-jar PUBLIC "-//Sun Microsystems, Inc.//DTD Enterprise JavaBeans 1.1//EN" "./ejb_jar_1_1.dtd" and I create a file named ejb_jar_1_1.dtd in the current directory.  </s>
<s> It works well.  </s>
<s> So, as a conclusion, it is possible to raise any one of the exceptions that apply, and DOM implementors can choose the one that is easiest to implement.  </s>
<s> Thanks, Tobias Peters  </s>
<s> As far as what's actually said in the REC goes.. yes, I believe that's true.  </s>
<s> I think there are strong expectations that the "most appropriate" DOMException will be chosen.  </s>
<s> Generally DOM code shouldn't be throwing exceptions unless the caller did something wrong, and you want to give them the clearest information you can so they can fix their code.  </s>
<s> Which is most appropriate in every possible case is not perfectly nailed down.  </s>
<s> The DOM test cases (now under develoment) may help to focus this more precisely.  </s>
