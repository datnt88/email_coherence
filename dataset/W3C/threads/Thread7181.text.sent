Sent: 07 May, 2003 12:56 Subject: RE: exploring ambiguity via the "something-which-has" URI scheme [Nothing of relevance to RFC2396bis herein] I think that Pat and I actually are in more agreement about this than disagreement, and in fact the disagreement reflected above does not exist but arose out of my misuse of the terminology. 
My key point is that, for the SW (and not any application using RDF that is not considered to participate in the SW) all parties must agree upon denotations of a given URI which are compatible, even if not identical. 
I think one of the continuing terminological problems is this (ab)use of "denotes". 
In the context of RDF formal semantics, and model theoretic semantics generally (I think), the denotation of a URI is a feature of a particular interpretation, and different interpretations may assign different denotations. 
This is irrespective of what we may intend a particular URI to mean or represent. 
As for the intended meaning, I'm still trying to reconcile the ideas that we often think we know what a name is intended to represent, yet, as Pat says, language in general and RDF in particular does not provide any workable mechanism to fix a single meaning for a name. 
I think there's an interesting parallel between the view of URIs as resource identifiers and formal semantics by model theory. 
URIs are used to identify some (loosely specified) underlying concept of a resource that yields certain representations under certain circumstances. 
Those representations are all we actually get to observe -- anything we may wish to know about a resource must be elicited in terms of such representations. 
Model theoretic semantics likewise does not fix the exact meaning (denotation) of a name, but allows us to constrain its meaning by limiting interpretations to those which match certain statements we may choose to make. 
What these seem to have in common is a limiting case. 
The more we say about a resource, the more "closely" it may be constrained to some asymptote of meaning. 
The more representations of a resource that we examine, the more we may learn about its "essential invariant characteristics". 
But certaintly is elusive. 
(Example: let f(x) = sin(x)/x. 
What is the value of f(0)? 
We can't evaluate f(0) directly as it involves a division of zero by zero; but if we consider the region about x=0, then a credible argument can be sustained that f(0)=1, for x in radians, because Lim[x- 0]f(x)=1.) 
In the mathematics I've been exposed to, the concept of a limit is strongly related to some idea of a metric, so that we can talk in terms of relative closeness of pairs of values. 
But there is no obvious metric for denotations of a resource. 
(At this point I muse about things I don't really understand, such as the theoretical work underpinning aspects of denotational semantics of programming languages ala Scott/Strachey, also ideas of subsumption as appear in description logics...) So can it make sense to think of the intended meaning of a name as a kind of region of meaning, bounded by those things we can observe or say about a resource? 
Ambiguity remains, but within bounds that we trust will not affect the results we wish to achieve in using a name. 
There is a kind of presumption here that one can make more observations, assert more constraints, to progressively constrain the nature of a resource in question. 
#g Thanks Graham. 
This fits well with how I've been viewing the matter. 
Even if, according to the MT, the denotation/interpretation of a given URI may differ, what counts for the SW is that those denotations/interpretations be compatible. 
Incompatible denotations/interpretations are what harm the SW. Patrick It seems to me that making use of a URI in RDF amount to an owl:import of the URI's associated web content pretty well solves this problem. 
It would make any incompatible use of a URI looks about the same as self-contradicting RDF graph. 
I argued for this a while ago [1] and mentioned it again yesterday in e-mail which oddly is absent from the archives (with "KIF" in the subject).

Just for the record, this is nonsense as stated. 
One wouldn't expect that two different interpretations would be compatible. 
What I think Patrick meant is that incompatible ASSERTIONS are what harm the SW. 
That is debateable, but at least it makes sense. 
Yes, but... 1. 
There isn't any clear notion defined anywhere (AFAIK) of what is 'the ... associated web content' of a URI. 
(What is the associated Web content of, say, rdfs:Class ?) 
This is precisely the ball that has been dropped between the SW community and the URI community. 
Each thinks that it is the other's problem. 
2. owl:import doesn't have any well-defined nontrivial semantics (yet). 
3. There is no such thing as a self-contradicting RDF graph. 
So while I agree that this picture has a nice intuitive feel to it, a lot of work needs doing before we can make it coherent.

Or, on the server side, as affecting the physical universe? 
What more (less-trivial) do people want than what the OWL docs say? 
I continue to follow the practice of assuming the semantics of an RDF graph are the semantics not just of RDF but of RDF in combination with the semantics of all the terms used in the RDF graph. 
Which, IMO, is the only approach that makes sense in practice. 
And brings us back to my point above. 
When I send you a message, the full meaning of my message depends on the full meaning of all my words; if you don't know all those words, then you'll miss some of my meaning. 
It's clear to me how that works for web-connected machines if the semantics of each term are communicated via an axiomatization available on the web [perhaps using LBase] at the appropriate address; it's less clear to me how to do this with model theory, or in general when you can't say what you want in an axiomatization in some standard language. 
But I strongly suspect using a normative rdfs:Comment is actually sufficient; if you can read the language, you can infer more. 
It's good to have work to do.
