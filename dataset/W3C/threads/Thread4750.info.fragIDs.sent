OK, I think this record of the meeting now has all the essential bits. 
I propose that it serve as a true record: RDF Data Access Working Group Meeting, April 2004 in Amsterdam: $Revision: 1.50 $ of $Date: 2004/04/30 21:37:14 $ Please review it and send any comments/corrections. 
Even if it looks OK as is, I'd like an explicit second or two. 
By the way... I'd like to add those photos. 
Any pointers? 
Mail them to www-archive if you don't have any place else to put them, please. 
Dan Connolly, W3C http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/ see you at the WWW2004 in NY 17-22 May? 
Reviwed as OK 
Seconded
