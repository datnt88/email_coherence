<s> operation.  </s>
<s> If you want labeling, just get a server that supports it, and then it's easy for a client to expose it, since we've standardized on what labeling looks like when it is supported.  </s>
<s> (I'm tempted to make an analogy about the superiority of "market driven" economy over a "command" economy :-).  </s>
<s> When I see how the "market" is taking care that programmers aren't too productive but struggle against badly designed hardware and operatings system I'm not sure about this superiority in some cases :-) An advantage of making labels optional naturally is that a server can decide to implement workspaces and baselines and instead save itself the trouble of implementing labels.  </s>
<s> Nevertheless I would like to see labels in core versioning as a simple means for creating baselines.  </s>
<s> Then there is the question of case significance in labels.  </s>
<s> I would prefer case significance.  </s>
<s> Especially when I read about the trouble with capitalizing letters which don't have an upper case.  </s>
<s> There was a long discussion a while ago and I guess that Geoff takes as a consensus that the server can decide what to do.  </s>
<s> That right Geoff ?  </s>
<s> In this case I see a small problem when resources with labels are moved from a server which supports labels with case significance to one which doesn't.  </s>
<s> But perhaps the market can rule again in this case ?  </s>
<s> Yeah, I was a strong advocate of Workspace headers too, until I ran into those pesky technical problems ... (:-).  </s>
<s> So you will probably want to kill workspace headers completely.  </s>
<s> I just thought whether it would make sense to save it by saying it doesn't apply for the method URL.  </s>
<s> So the server still could find out which subtree and by this which module would be concerned.  </s>
<s> A drawback would be that the method URL would be a special case but I suppose there are bigger problems (Sorry to ask but I don't have time at the moment to get all the postings I missed the last months).  </s>
<s> OTOH I don't like to parse a URL to find out whether it is in some workspace or not (Yes I know it's possible :-) So you see that I have some gripes but these aren't showstoppers for me.  </s>
<s> I suppose I could live with them.  </s>
<s> It's the same with Lisa's proposal of killing some new methods.  </s>
<s> I was sympathetic with some of her ideas but won't fight for them to my last breath.  </s>
<s> Fianlly a question.  </s>
<s> A collegue of mine is doing a lot with Python.  </s>
<s> After looking over www.webdav.org  </s>
<s> I mailed Jim Davis about the Python client mentioned there.  </s>
<s> But it's source is not free.  </s>
<s> Does anybody know about a free Python client ?  </s>

<s> An advantage of making labels optional naturally is that a server can decide to implement workspaces and baselines and instead save itself the trouble of implementing labels.  </s>
<s> That's a good point ... I know of at least a couple of systems that support baselining but not per-version labels.  </s>
<s> And even when a server supports both baselines and labels, a client is *much* better off to use the server's native baseline support, since a good server will implement baselining in a far superior way natively than can be done by a client using the servers labeling mechanism.  </s>
<s> Nevertheless I would like to see labels in core versioning as a simple means for creating baselines.  </s>
<s> Note: In general, I'd discourage a client from trying to "fake" baselines on a server that supports labels but not baselines.  </s>
<s> If the label implementation was truly suitable for supporting baselining (and many are not), then a sensible server writer will do the trivial amount of extra work to support the baselining protocol.  </s>
<s> So it is very likely the only time you will run into a server that supports labels and not baselining is when the label implementation does not support effective (efficient) baselining.  </s>
<s> But that of course is up to the client writer ... heck, you could try to fake all of WebDAV on top of GET and PUT if you really wanted to (it just wouldn't work very well :-).  </s>
<s> But even if you decide to fake baselines on with labels, all that making labels optional would mean is that you would grey out your baselining functionality if neither baselines or labels were available.  </s>

<s> Yes, the problems arise for all URL's whether it is the request URL, a URL in a header, or a URL in the content.  </s>
<s> OTOH I don't like to parse a URL to find out whether it is in some workspace or not (Yes I know it's possible :-) It's not so much a parsing issue (workspace URL's look like any other URL) as it is a property or semantic issue.  </s>
<s> In particular, every version selector in a workspace has a DAV:workspace property which tells you which workspace the version selector is in (if any).  </s>

<s> Cheers, Geoff  </s>
<s> Mr. Schwarz's comments on wanting baselining in core reminded me of an offline conversation I had recently with Jim: Jim pointed out that many of the issues about what to include in core versioning involve the definition of what core versioning is _for_.  </s>
<s> I initially assumed -- since I work on document repositories rather than source repositories -- that core would be suitable for document repositories' simpler versioning needs.  </s>
<s> That assumption was probably unwarranted.  </s>
<s> Nevertheless, I think it would be a Good Thing if we did explicitly or at least consciously target "core versioning" to simple document repository scenarios.  </s>
<s> Source repositories can then implement on top of core versioning any additional features like baselining, forking, etc. that aren't required of document repositories.  </s>
<s> Does anybody feel that core versioning shouldn't be targetted at ordinary document repositories that want versioning?  </s>

<s> I initially assumed -- since I work on document repositories rather than source repositories -- that core would be suitable for document repositories' simpler versioning needs.  </s>
<s> That assumption was probably unwarranted.  </s>
<s> In earlier drafts of the protocol, the core level was called "document management" (and advanced was called "configuration management"), so historically, Lisa's assumption is very warranted.  </s>
<s> Nevertheless, I think it would be a Good Thing if we did explicitly or at least consciously target "core versioning" to simple document repository scenarios.  </s>
<s> Source repositories can then implement on top of core versioning any additional features like baselining, forking, etc. that aren't required of document repositories.  </s>
<s> As is probably clear from my postings, I wholeheartedly (and even vehemently :-) agree with the preceding paragraph.  </s>
