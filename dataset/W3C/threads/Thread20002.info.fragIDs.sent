<s> Hello! Did anyone succeed to compile Amaya on a SGI workstation.  </s>
<s> I tried but I didn't succeed neither with gcc nor with the SGI MipsPro Compilers, neither with gmake nor with make.  </s>
<s> Is there something special I have to take care about?  </s>
<s> Thanks in advance  </s>

<s> Hi,  </s>
<s> This is the list of things we did when we built Amaya on SGI platforms 1) adding the option -fsigned-char.  </s>
<s> I guess the Amaya configure already does that 2) when Makefiles were generated by configure we removed in SGI/amaya/Makefile SGI/thotlib/Makefile the linking options  </s>
<s> -lnsl -lsocket"  </s>
<s> because that libraries doen't exist on this platform.  </s>
<s> I hope that helps Irene.  </s>
<s> -lnsl -lsocket"  </s>
<s> I now tried this.  </s>
<s> But the error I get seems to still be the same as before: gmake[2]: Entering directory `/usr/people/iagkemm/pakete/w3/Amaya/mipspro/thotlib' gcc -O2 -W -fsigned-char -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I.. -I../../amaya/xpm -I../../tablelib/f -I../../thotlib/include -I../../thotlib/internals/var -I../../thotlib/internals/h -I../../thotlib/internals/f -I../../schemas -I../../schemasOPERA -I../../libjpeg -I../../libpng -I../../libpng/zlib -I/usr/include/X11 -c ../../thotlib/dialogue/interface.c -o dialogue/interface.o  </s>

<s> Hi Friedemann,  </s>
<s> Could you check this patch: After the configure you comments the following line in Amaya/SGI/config.h - #define HAVE_STRINGS_H 1 + /* #define HAVE_STRINGS_H 1 */  </s>
<s> Irene.  </s>
<s> This was it!  </s>
<s> now it compiles very fine.  </s>
<s> The only problem remaining was that I had to replace INSTALL = ../install-sh -c by a line with the complete path of install-sh for "gmake all".  </s>
<s> But now it's installed and it works fine as far as I see.  </s>
<s> Thank You very much!  </s>
