Hi Eric, I downloaded annotea server v1.1 and installed it but since the 1st of April the use of my $dateStr = `date`; if ($dateStr !~ m/^(\w+) (\w+)\s+(\d+) (\d+):(\d+):(\d+) (?:(\w+) )?(\d+)$/) { &amp;throw(new W3C::Util::Exception(-message = "bad date \"$dateStr\"")); in W3C::Util::W3CDebugCGI (around line 54) throws an exception on my machine due to the fact that we now have Day Saving Time in place. 
The output of date on my machine is for example: Thu Apr 4 15:02:17 MET DST 2002 and the RE in the if clause does not expect 'DST' I modified it as follows (removed timezone being optional in RE): my $dateStr = `date '+%a %b %e %T %Y'` but it may be better to modify the RE. Hope it helps Bye

Better still to use Perl built-in's instead of relying on platform-dependent commands. 
Some suggestions at based on a CVS pull at the time.

These are mostly incorporated. 
Acknowledged and addressed in MID:20020404150443.A10139@w3.org [1] Try another update and see if it fixes your problems. 
One issue that arose it that the timezone isn't so reliably set (so I defautled it to "NA"). 
I doubt this will cause problems, but thought I'd raise awareness just in case.
