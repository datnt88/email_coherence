<s> I suggest you first to have a look at the Developer's corner in and the Introduction to Amaya: http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/Overview.html  </s>
<s> The whole organization of the code is explained in The Amaya code is based on a editing/formating library thotlib (+ tablelib).  </s>
<s> This library is split in sub-directories and modules.  </s>
<s> Module names give an idea of included functions.  </s>
<s> In any case all external functions of a module are listed in the file Amaya/thotlib/internals/f/module_f.h. Functions exported by the thotlib are listed in Amaya/thotlib/include/*.h and are documented in "The Thot API manual".  </s>
