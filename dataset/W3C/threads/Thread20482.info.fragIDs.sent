Since next Amaya release is set for next month, I am resending the following 
major bug in the hopes that it is fixed in the next version: Platform: PC OS: WinXP Version: 5.3 Problem Description: In a new CSS Style Sheet, it is possible to back space and the file name becomes part of the file. 
Reproducibility: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Start Amaya. 
2. Click File  New  New CSS style sheet???. 3. Click Confirm. 
4. Press BACKSPACE 3 times. 
Actual Results: The file name becomes part of the document.

Other Information: This is also possible with existing style sheets, HTML files (source view). 
I did not test MML, SVG, or other file types.

I suggest you first to have a look at the Developer's corner in and the Introduction to Amaya: http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/Overview.html 
The whole organization of the code is explained in The Amaya code is based on a editing/formating library thotlib (+ tablelib). 
This library is split in sub-directories and modules. 
Module names give an idea of included functions. 
In any case all external functions of a module are listed in the file Amaya/thotlib/internals/f/module_f.h. Functions exported by the thotlib are listed in Amaya/thotlib/include/*.h and are documented in "The Thot API manual". 
I hope this help. 
Irene.
