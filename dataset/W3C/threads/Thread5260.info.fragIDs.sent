<s> To help move things forward with the wordnet activity, I've taken a first pass at translating Guus' note into RDF/XML.  </s>
<s> So far, all I've done is the RDFS stuff, OWL to follow.  </s>
<s> There are some changes from Guus' note, most/all of which are marked as an issue or with an @@.  </s>
<s> I've also taken the liberty of starting of a strawman note that includes an overview diagram of the ontology.  </s>
<s> The files are in the attached zip.  </s>
<s> Brian  </s>
<s> From a quick quick look, is nice progress.  </s>
<s> I'd add in a status/scope disclaimer of some kind though, to note early on something like... "This document presents an RDF/OWL representation of the entire structure of Wordnet.  </s>
<s> By doing so, we allow Wordnet data to be accessed via RDF APIs and query languages, and to be mixed with non-Wordnet data, as well as with other lexically-oriented material, such as extensions to, and derrivatives of, Wordnet and Wordnet-tagged corpuses.  </s>
<s> A related but distinct activity would be to describe the use of Wordnet as a basis for RDF/OWL class and/or property hierarchy.  </s>
<s> Wordnet's noun term (hypernym) hierarchy captures "an X is a kind of Y" relationships between English category terms based on conventional usage.  </s>
<s> While there are several projects working in this area, it is not a task we currently address in this document.  </s>
<s> This current document does not explore the issues raised by the mapping of Wordnet structures into RDF (eg.  </s>
<s> noun terms and/or synsets into classes).  </s>
<s> Future revisions of this document, or companion documents, may address some of the issues this raises, such as the different assumptions underlying lexical databases when contrasted with formal ontologies.  </s>
<s> Here we concentrate on reflecting into RDF/XML the core structures and content of Wordnet, without consideration for mapping those notions into RDF's own notions of classes, properties and instances.  </s>
<s> This approach echoes that of SKOS [ref], which reflects into RDF the broader/narrower relationships used by thesauri, without requiring that each thesauri be re-engineered as an RDF/OWL class hierarchy.  </s>
<s> Unlike SKOS, the structuring vocabulary used here draws directly from the conceptual framework underpinning Wordnet, allowing for concepts such as 'antonym' to be used to relate concepts/synsets.  </s>
<s> It may be possible for future versions of this document and SKOS to share more common structure, since the structuring vocabularies address similar (yet distinct) problems."  </s>
<s> Hmm ok that was off the top of my head, and also a bit of an attempt to explain how three different workitems we are playing with might fit together.  </s>
<s> Not sure how best to use it.  </s>
<s> Comments welcomed... cheers, Dan  </s>
<s> Thanks to Brian for the good presentation effort.  </s>
<s> I agree on the disclaimer by Dan, and it nicely fit the draft note I've just posted as a TF description.  </s>
<s> Let's move on then Aldo  </s>
