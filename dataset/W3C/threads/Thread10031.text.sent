X-MailScanner: Found to be clean As previously mentioned [1], [2], at the request of the I18N WG [3], the XML Core WG has been considering whether the explicit licensing of the use of xml:lang="" to "un-declare" a language should be made an erratum to XML 1.0 or merely included as part of XML 1.1. 
The XML Core WG has debated this issue thoroughly, seeked the input of various groups (including chairs, XML Plenary, and various public email groups), and canvased current implementations. 
It has been decided that the optimal situation is to issue this as an erratum to the XML 1.0 spec. 
Hence, you can see this reflected in the current Errata document at http://www.w3.org/XML/xml-V10-2e-errata#E41 . 
The XML Core WG thanks all who provided feedback in this decision.

In the abstract syntax I could specify that either lang is oblig and defaults to "" or that lang="" is illegal. 
Probably the former is most in tune with XML. 
DaveB might then need some wordsmithing.

I would rather see xml:lang="" as an RDF/XML mechanism only, that has no explicit representation in the graph. 
The whole point of adding xml:lang="" is to turn off any higher scope xml:lang assertion, and the results in the graph should be the same as if no xml:lang attribute had been used at all in the RDF/XML, insofar as its effect on literal node labels in the graph. 
Thus: gives us the literal nodes bar-en and bas (but not bas-"" or any such null language indication in the abstract syntax).
