Can someone please point me to the current schedule for rolling out the 2.0 guidelines? 
In particular, I'd like to know the dates for: - draft of guidelines and techniques posted for external review (is this one 
step or will the guidelines be available before the techniques are ready?) - deadline for review comments - final version complete Thanks, Annuska Perkins PM, Accessible Technology Group 
Annuska, 
When you refer to "final version complete" - are you asking when WCAG 2.0 will be published as a W3C Recommendation? 
We do not have a timetable for going to Recommendation but my own personal opinion is that the earliest this would happen would be by the end of the year. 
Please refer to the W3C 
process that we must follow in order to publish a recommendation: As far as publishing the guidelines for external review, a public working draft of WCAG 2.0 was published 25 January 2001 at February 2001. 
Per W3C policy, it is recommended that we publish work for public review every 3 months. 
When WCAG 1.0 was published, we published the Techniques at the same time. 
I anticipate the same process this time when we go to Recommendation, that all supporting materials will be published at the same time. 
Until then, we should have a variety of work drafts of all of the documents and not necessarily published at the same time. 
We will have several subgroups focusing on different technologies and I expect drafts from each subgroup at different times. 
However, fresh versions of all documents will be generated for public releases. 
Have I answered your questions? 
It would help me to know why you are wondering about timelines. 
I am concerned that some people might see us working on WCAG 2.0 and discount WCAG 1.0, when 2.0 is merely making 1.0 better and should not raise any major inconsistencies. 
in other words, people should go ahead and use WCAG 1.0 since 2.0 won't be out for a while.

Thanks for your thorough explanation, Wendy. 
Yes, you answered my questions and I will read up on the W3C Recommendation Track. 
I was asking mainly because I want to solicit comments from my peers at the right time and let them know of any deadlines.
