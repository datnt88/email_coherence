Hi, Sorry if this question has been asked before... 
I am interested to know if anyone on this list knows of any e-commerce/e-business sites that are judged to be accessible? 
I making a pitch to my group about designing accessibility into the e-business sites we develop for clients. 
It would be great to tell people, look at these e-commerce sites that are accessible - we should be doing this! 
In my searching have come across mostly academic and non-profit organization's web sites that are accessible, e.g., passed Bobby, follows the WAI guidelines, however, I don't remember coming across anything with a more business or corporate focus. 
Thanks for any help you can give me!

On the 1st of december the Australian Government's enquiry, being conducted by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission in Australia should be able to give some examples - the interim report is due then. 
A couple of specific cases which I think are problems are the registration sites for Domain names, which are inaccessible (do not meet level-A of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines). 
In the one case where I ahve followed up on this the site in question has responded that they are planning to overhaul the site and make it accessible, and I am hoping to follow up on the other instance this weekend. 
I just wandered through Amazon.com (since I recalled using it before) and although I didn't actually do the transaction (since I don't want to buy anything today) I put stuff in my shopping cart and went as far as registering my details without encountering any WCAG P1 failures. 
Then I realised there was a book I wanted to send. 
Turned out it was not in print in the US, but I found it in the UK and registered, bought a book, and sent it overseas. 
I knew the title I want, and got it by a search. 
This is not a complete test by any means, but Amazon is a pretty large and well-known site. 
I guess there are only about a zillion other ecmmerce sites I should test, but... Charles McCN

Just to give a little independent verification from a totally blind screen reader user: Yes, Amazon is one of my favorite shopping sites. 
For a large site with dozens of options it is relatively easy to navigate. 
Switch to their text-only version (generated on the fly) to avoid getting trapped in 97 imagemap links. 
Other sites (e.g., CDNOW, as of 6 weeks ago or so) have constant blurbs at the top of each page, so you hear them numerous times, even when trying to concentrate on entering credit card details, which is very distracting. 
Other sites make you enter your password each time you add something to the Shopping Cart. 
Still other sites make use of graphical buttons for the items to be purchased. 
Amazon avoids all these pitfalls. 
Amazon may be getting too big for its own good, though. 
If I'm trying to buy books I don't want to hear about auctions, &amp; if I'm trying to buy electronics I don't want to hear about the top 10 CDs. 
Patrick Not Amazon stockholder, but did get a free plastic coffee mug from them last year 
none that i am aware. 
however the U.S Mint will be investing in a major redesign of their e-commerce web site, http://www.usmint.gov/catalog, to include the general web site, www.usmint.gov. 
Last month there was a press release where we did over seven million dollars in sales for July and we are increasing exponentialy We are currently making a minor revision to the e-commerce web site that has some patches but we need to get our people up to speed and trained. 
We also will be building a quality assurance team to support thisand other efforts. 
To my knowledge there are no site that use Cascading Style Sheets for e-business and we will not use Cascading Style Sheets for a long while on the internet. 
Our customer base is very large and uses so many different types of browsers. 
Plus we know that Cascading Style Sheets causes major problems for certain browsers. 
So the redesign is going to be a challenge, because we use rely on small fonts. 
This allows us to put make more content easily scannable for sighted users. 
This also permits customers to see more on one page, when properly laid out. 
Therefore, we are faced with compliance to HTML where fonts size and other attributes are deprecated. 
This means a challenge when implementing double-A conformance level.
