Even though we haven't been proposing specific spec changes for CSS2 - given that their specification is behind HTML4 in terms of readiness - we should nevertheless make clear our expectations, and I suggest we take some of Jason's input to the HC list and forward that to the CSS2 WG. 
I'm thinking of these messages: With the focus put on "simple" things: 1. 
The selection of elements based on generic attribute values is still not possible; only CLASS and ID values are admitted as selectors. 
Also related to that is the use of attribute values in properties (e.g. how to do get the ALT text to be spoken with ACSS without something like: IMG {speak: attrib(ALT) }) 2. Notes (including footnotes and end notes) are briefly mentioned in section 20.3 (printing) as yet to be developed. 
Is it expected that such work will be completed before CSS 2 becomes a standard? 
Without the actual proposals, it is clearly not possible to assess the degree to which they satisfy access requirements (in this instance, for example, the audio treatment of notes; the braille requirements can be postponed for consideration in the Braille CSS work). 
3. Unable to find any mention of section numbering or paragraph numbering. 
4. generic prefix/suffix text And a mention, for the future (XSL or else), of Jason's more important changes (tree transform and syntax changes). 
Jason, do you feel like drafting a more wordy proposal along these lines ? 
I think one message to the IG (following the HC items is enough, no need to break it in smaller pieces). 
Chris and I can use the archived copy of your message as the starting point for FP:CSS relations. 
You are right; there is a lot of agenda for CSS running around in our mail. 
Some of those we have heard sanguine rumors about, like matching to attributes other than CLASS, but... -- Al 
As long as we start the FP discussions before the CSS Austin meeting and they get our input by then, I'm fine with this path.
