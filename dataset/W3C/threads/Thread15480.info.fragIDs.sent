<s> Even though we haven't been proposing specific spec changes for CSS2 - given that their specification is behind HTML4 in terms of readiness - we should nevertheless make clear our expectations, and I suggest we take some of Jason's input to the HC list and forward that to the CSS2 WG.  </s>
<s> I'm thinking of these messages: With the focus put on "simple" things: 1.  </s>
<s> The selection of elements based on generic attribute values is still not possible; only CLASS and ID values are admitted as selectors.  </s>

<s> Without the actual proposals, it is clearly not possible to assess the degree to which they satisfy access requirements (in this instance, for example, the audio treatment of notes; the braille requirements can be postponed for consideration in the Braille CSS work).  </s>
<s> 3. Unable to find any mention of section numbering or paragraph numbering.  </s>
<s> 4. generic prefix/suffix text And a mention, for the future (XSL or else), of Jason's more important changes (tree transform and syntax changes).  </s>
<s> Jason, do you feel like drafting a more wordy proposal along these lines ?  </s>
<s> I think one message to the IG (following the HC items is enough, no need to break it in smaller pieces).  </s>
<s> Chris and I can use the archived copy of your message as the starting point for FP:CSS relations.  </s>
<s> You are right; there is a lot of agenda for CSS running around in our mail.  </s>
<s> Some of those we have heard sanguine rumors about, like matching to attributes other than CLASS, but... -- Al  </s>
<s> As long as we start the FP discussions before the CSS Austin meeting and they get our input by then, I'm fine with this path.  </s>
