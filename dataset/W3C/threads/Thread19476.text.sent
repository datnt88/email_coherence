I had a hyperlink with the character &amp; in the text; when saving the document, When saving the document, this is what resulted. 
zap.w3.org:/tux/u/jg amaya *** Errors in http://www.w3.org/People/Gettys/ temp file: /tux/u/jg/.amaya/1/Gettys 
line 137, char 27: Invalid entity "&amp;T " *** Thot: Irrecoverable error ***: Error 0 modified documents, if any, will be saved : Error 0 So it appears that Amaya will read in the incorrect HTML, but then only crash when it comes time to save the document. 
This is Amaya 1.3b, on Alpha, but I suspect it is generic. 
Here is a snippet of the HTML that caused the crash.

I downloaded your page with Amaya without any error report. 
I guess you fixed this error: you have to use the entity &amp;amp; here. 
That is due to another problem without any connection with the invalid entity "&amp;T " I know you downloaded a preliminary version 1.3b. 
Did you download the official 1.3b version of October 14? 
What was your last command? 
A save as? Regards Irene. 
Yes, I fixed the page by hand (emacs). 
My last command was a "save as". 
I believe I installed the October 14 version. 
The size and date on the executable are 3842048 Oct 14 11:16 amaya.
