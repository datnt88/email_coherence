<s> RFC 2616 does not state whether a status code of 305 should include an entity or not.  </s>
<s> I am assuming that it SHOULD include an entity just like the other 3xx status codes except 304.  </s>
<s> Is this a correct assumption?  </s>
<s> You missed a part.  </s>
<s> 305 (Use Proxy) MUST include a location header pointing to the proxy to be used using a URI.  </s>
<s> 304 MUST include the date header.  </s>
<s> Or, if clock-less, it MUST include: ETag and/or Content-Location Expires, Cache-Control, and/or Vary  </s>
<s> You'd better read RFC2616 once again, and you see that you make the incorrect assumptions.  </s>
<s> An other possibility is that you mixed the body and entity.  </s>
<s> Entity represents the headers and the body the actual data (e.g. HTML document).  </s>
<s> The body is not needed, but may be included.  </s>
<s> Here is no information about.  </s>
<s> MS-IIS send a body with a e.g. 301 response.  </s>
<s> Other servers may not do this... - Joris  </s>
<s> In general all that is expected with a '305 Use Proxy' response is a proxy name in the 'Location' field.  </s>
<s> Why would you want to return an entity with the response?  </s>
<s> Sumanth  </s>
<s> The spec is silent on the issue of sending entity bodies with a 305.  </s>
<s> I don't recall whether it is silent on purpose -- probably not.  </s>
<s> Whether your assumption above is correct depends a bit on whether you are writing client or server software.  </s>
<s> 1) if you are writing a client that gets 305 responses, you cannot assume anything about an entity body being present, so you must be prepared to handle either case.  </s>
<s> 2) if you are writing a server that sends 305 responses, the most sensible thing to do, in my opinion, is to include a short HTML entity body with human-readable instructions about using a proxy.  </s>
