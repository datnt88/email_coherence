RFC 2616 does not state whether a status code of 305 should include an entity or not. 
I am assuming that it SHOULD include an entity just like the other 3xx status codes except 304. 
Is this a correct assumption? 
You missed a part. 
305 (Use Proxy) MUST include a location header pointing to the proxy to be used using a URI. 
304 MUST include the date header. 
Or, if clock-less, it MUST include: ETag and/or Content-Location Expires, Cache-Control, and/or Vary 
You'd better read RFC2616 once again, and you see that you make the incorrect assumptions. 
An other possibility is that you mixed the body and entity. 
Entity represents the headers and the body the actual data (e.g. HTML document). 
The body is not needed, but may be included. 
Here is no information about. 
MS-IIS send a body with a e.g. 301 response. 
Other servers may not do this... - Joris 
In general all that is expected with a '305 Use Proxy' response is a proxy name in the 'Location' field. 
Why would you want to return an entity with the response?

The spec is silent on the issue of sending entity bodies with a 305. 
I don't recall whether it is silent on purpose -- probably not. 
Whether your assumption above is correct depends a bit on whether you are writing client or server software. 
1) if you are writing a client that gets 305 responses, you cannot assume anything about an entity body being present, so you must be prepared to handle either case. 
2) if you are writing a server that sends 305 responses, the most sensible thing to do, in my opinion, is to include a short HTML entity body with human-readable instructions about using a proxy.
