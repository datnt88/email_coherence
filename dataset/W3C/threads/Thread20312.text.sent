While editing http://www.w3.org/P3P/Group/Specification/p3p-issues.html with Amaya 3.1 (on Win98) I've found that inserting a new table row often (but not always) causes Amaya to get into a state where it is constantly re-rendering the table, causing the browser window to flash, but stop responding. 
It has to be killed and restarted at that point. 
This seems to happen all the time if I place my curser in the last row of the table in any spot other than the right-most cell, and select tr from the types menu. 
While I can understand that this may be partially a user error (I should put my curser in the right-most cell I think -- I couldn't find an explanation of exactly this point in the help pages, but I think that's probably the correct way to use it) I don't think it should crash Amaya. 
Also the help page for tables doesn't explain how to remove a table row. 
How is this done? 
Lorrie You're right. 
If the cursor is currently in the middle of the row, Amaya is looking for in the DTD a way to generate a row here and I guess it found that the better is to split the current cell and the row here, generate a new row and fill the end of the previous row and the beginning of the next row with empty cells. 
Perhaps the context was more complex and Amaya tried to do more than that? 
Probably we have to avoid generic editing within tables and provide specific commands. 
I guess if you selected the row by ESC (or F2 on Windows) then enter a return you obtained what you wanted. 
The right way is to select the row by ESC (or F2 on Windows) then Delete. 
I'll add the information in the help page. 
Irene. 
Actually I find that Amaya takes a very long time to deal with re-rendering tables of any size, but that after I come back from making coffee it is sitting there, very pleased with itself, and has done just what I asked. 
Perhaps you should get more coffee/tea/milk/whatever breaks? 
(Seriously, I have found it can take a couple of minutes or more, but I have not found it actually infinite-looping.) cheers Charles McCN While editing http://www.w3.org/P3P/Group/Specification/p3p-issues.html with Amaya 3.1 (on Win98) I've found that inserting a new table row often (but not always) causes Amaya to get into a state where it is constantly re-rendering the table, causing the browser window to flash, but stop responding.

Lorrie W3C Web Accessibility Initiative http://www.w3.org/WAI Location: I-cubed, 110 Victoria Street, Carlton VIC 3053 Postal: GPO Box 2476V, Melbourne 3001, Australia I did some more table editing with Amaya today and encountered some more problems. 
I created the following page with Amaya 3.1 on Win98: I initially created the table with 10 rows. 
Whenever I put my curser in the left most column and typed something, the typing would appear above the table. 
When I examined the table in the structure view it was fine. 
And when I saved the file and reloaded it, it was fine. 
So this is a rendering problem. 
The strange thing was that the problem went away after I added a few more rows to the table. 
I inserted my curser at the beginning of the "June 14" line near the top, and pressed return in hopes of inserting a new bullet. 
The first time I did this, my entire table was deleted. 
I restored the file and tried again. 
This time the table wasn't deleted but the rest of the bullet list was deleted. 
These problems were NOT rendering problems. 
Amaya does not seem to properly update the screen when I add links inside bulleted lists. 
When I save the file and reload everything renders fine. 
But rendering is problematic before reload. 
The problem is especially noticeable in tables -- the bulleted item goes out of its cell and over writes the cell below.
