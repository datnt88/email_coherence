Subject: Upcoming Journal Publishers XML Tutorial and Math Round Table (EPSIG) Attached is an announcement from EPSIG. 
We are sponsoring a tutorial on the application of XML in Journal Publishing. 
The following day, journal publishers who have requirements to publish math are invited to a round table discussion to share requirements and provide input to vendors who are developing tools to support SGML Math. 
Input from this session will go back to the ISO 12083 meeting this May in Spain. 
If you have any questions, please contact me (Dianne Kennedy). 
Also please share this with any other publishers/vendors who may have an interest. 
XML The New Alternative for Journal Publishing on the Web In the years since SGML was introduced as an ISO Standard, journal publishers have attempted to use SGML as the foundation for publishing. 
We have lived through two standards development efforts (AAP Electronic Document Standard and ISO 12083) only to find that real use of SGML by journal publishers is suceeding in only a limited fashion. 
With emerging requirements by both publishers and those who use journals, it is clear that a ``standardized'' encoding which enables simultaneous delivery of journal information in multiple formats as well as facilitating the ability of users to quickly locate information in journals is critical. 
This tutorial explains the model for journal publishing, existing SGML journal publishing standards, and why implementing them is so difficult. 
It explains existing electronic publishing alternatives to SGML that just don't deliver what the readership requires and introduces XML--a new W3C standard which promises to provide solutions for both Web and traditional journal publishing. 
HTML, the current Web language, is just too simplistic to support ongoing Web publication of journals. 
Its parent language, SGML, has proven to be too complex. 
XML provides a middle ground for journal publishers being sophisticated enough to support full- function publishing on the Web without raising the technical and economic barriers one faces in attempting to use SGML. 
We invite the journal community to come to this tutorial to get a first-hand look at XML and the promise it holds for journal publishers.

About EPSIG The Electronic Publishing Special Interest Group (EPSIG) is a collaboration between Graphic Communication Association and the Association of American Publishers (AAP). 
EPSIG is designed to serve as your source for information about ISO 12083 as well as related standards and industry implementation activities. 
For more information on EPSIG membership, EPSIG News Subscriptions, EPSIG publications and EPSIG@aol.com. 
EPSIG Math Requirements Round Table In conjunction with this tutorial, a roundtable of journal publishers with specific math requirements will be held. 
Rather than focusing on the details of the ISO 12083 Math DTD fragment, the needs and concerns of journal publishers will be considered. 
Math definition has been particularly troublesome for the ISO 12083 working group and for publishers of journals that have an intensive math requirement. 
Vendor support for math has been held up because of conflicting requirements. 
This roundtable will provide a forum for journal publishers to state requirements for SGML math. 
A summary of this roundtable discussion will be presented at the upcoming ISO 12083 meeting in Barcelona. 
The Lecturer Dianne Kennedy is an independent SGML consultant and founder of the SGML Resource Center. 
Ms. Kennedy has been an active participant in many industry SGML standards activities. 
Currently she serves as chairperson for the DTD Working Group of SAE J2008 for the automotive industry and is Deputy Conviener for ISO 12083 Standards work. 
She also has played a vital role as a consultant to the ATA 2100 Specification SGML working group and has served on a number of DoD CALS standards committees as well. 
Dianne Kennedy regularly presents ``SGML ToolTime Seminars''. 
Ms. Kennedy was in instructor for GCA SGML Tutorial Series from 1984 to 1991.
