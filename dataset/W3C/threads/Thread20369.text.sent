When a Mathml document (.mml) includes characters ' ' or &amp; (within a comment by example) the current version 4.3.2 of Amaya doesn't export these characters as entities  &amp;amp; To fix that bug we encourage people to replace their current file Amaya/amaya/MathMLT.TRA by the new version available on our Web server (http://www.w3.org/Amaya/Distribution/MathMLT.TRA) 
It looks like this only fixes installed copies of Amaya. 
Will you be rerolling the distribution or putting up a source patchfile as well? 
I've always wanted to be a dilettante, but I've never quite been ready to make the commitment. 
We cannot patch the current delivered version. 
The version 4.3.2 must be the same for everybody. 
Just after the release we started important developments and we need time to obtain a new stable version.
