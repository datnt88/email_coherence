<s> Hi. What's the point of these datatype properties: process:name (in Process.owl) profile:serviceName (in Profile.owl)  </s>
<s> They are both defined to range over xsd:string.  </s>
<s> It seems to me that the instance names could be used instead.  </s>
<s> At least process:name seems entirely superfluous.  </s>
<s> Perhaps serviceName is reasonable if a service is to have a "public name" shown for purposes of discovery, that is different from the name of the Profile instance.  </s>

<s> Hi Daniel -  </s>
<s> It's a fair question.  </s>
<s> I don't know of anyone who claims that these properties are crucial for any reason, and I'm not aware (offhand) that they've been used in any significant ways.  </s>
<s> I should note that these properties were not conceived for the purpose of providing a unique identifier, but more for something human-readable.  </s>
<s> When you say "instance names", do you mean the rdf:ID?  </s>
<s> If so, I don't think of that as a suitable replacement for a "name" property, in general.  </s>
<s> I imagine the rdf:ID will be automatically generated in many situations, and often may not be human-oriented (readable).  </s>
<s> Also, it may be desirable to ensure that rdf:ID is unique.  </s>
<s> So I wouldn't want that to be the only way to give a name to something.  </s>
<s> Also, I don't see why a process shouldn't have its own distinct name (that is, different from a related Profile).  </s>
<s> I think probably the best argument for eliminating these properties is that rdfs:label can be used for this purpose.  </s>
<s> Regards, David  </s>
<s> Some of us want to think of a service as being an activity with a verb describing its action... verb parameters ... Maybe the service name is one way to see that mapped straightforwardly... rather than just having a service id? Austin  </s>
