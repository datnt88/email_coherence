<s> I want to know what this means for the HTML specification.  </s>
<s> In the DTD we have comments as follows (clipped from most recent public draft): Objects, Images, and Applets in HTML documents (p4 of 48) 14.1 Including an image: the IMG element !--  </s>

<s> src %URL; #REQUIRED -- URL of image to embed -- alt CDATA #REQUIRED -- short description -- longdesc %URL; #IMPLIED -- link to long description -- align %IAlign; #IMPLIED -- vertical or horizontal alignment --  </s>
<s> Is that what you want, or would it be better for the comments to say "To avoid problems with non-visual UAs, provide a brief text alternative for the image via ALT, and avoid server-side image  </s>

<s> The OBJECT element doesn't include an alt attribute since the content of the OBJECT element is used as the fallback.  </s>
<s> This allows for rich text descriptions to be given in place including regular HTML elements such as paragraphs, lists  </s>
<s> and hypertext links.  </s>
<s> The title attribute can be used for a one-liner description of the OBJECT and would normally  </s>

<s> I'd be more explicit: substitute for "for" "describing the information conveyed by"  </s>
<s> Agree: but how about -- text alternative describing image --  </s>
<s> Interesting.  </s>
<s> With your two edits, you have succeeded in bracketing where I would draw a line.  </s>
<s> to follow up on what Harvey Bingham said: [quoted twice is me  </s>
<s> [quoted once is Harvey  </s>
<s> In other words, "To avoid problems with non-visual UAs, provide a brief text alternative describing the information conveyed by the image via ALT, and avoid server-side image..." That one is OK, if not entirely an improvement.  </s>
<s> I would not be happy with that one.  </s>
<s> The classic example of the icon in the software manual illustrates the difference.  </s>
<s> "Exclamation point in triangle (in red)" describes the image.  </s>
<s> "Warning!  </s>
<s> " captures the information conveyed.  </s>
<s> For images whose function is primarily symbolic (they allude to a concept) a verbal expression of the same concept is to be preferred to a verbal description of the visual expression of the concept.  </s>
<s> IMG is too broad in its range of application for one to know from just the IMG element type if it should have a description or an equivalent in its ALT string.  </s>
<s> Over the long haul maybe we could look at defining elements which are more specific concerning the role of the image.  </s>
<s> For now, we still need Gregg's CASE statement in the guidelines.  </s>
<s> As I see it.  </s>
<s> -- Al Gilman  </s>
<s> Somewhere in here I think we need to differentiate the nature of ALT and LONGDESC.  </s>
<s> We sometimes say things like ALT = Short Description LONGDESC = Long Description I think ALT is a little different.  </s>
<s> It is supposed to describe the FUNCTION.  </s>
<s> While LongDesc is more of a description of the appearance.  </s>
<s> Maybe we should say ALT = short description of the FUNCTION LONGDESC = (long) description of the IMAGE For example a bullet shaped like an arrow would have alt text "bullet" not "yellow arrow pointing right" An Image button for search would say "search" Not "Magnifying Glass with Search on it" or "magnifying glass" What you think?  </s>
<s> How do we convey this idea.  </s>
<s> Even more important in light of discussions about tool tips etc. Gregg  </s>
<s> For the most part, Gregg Vanderheiden's summary captures precisely the distinction between the respective purposes of ALT and LONGDESC.  </s>
<s> There will probably be exceptions to such generalisations however.  </s>
<s> For instance, in a previous discussion of this topic, Al pointed out the difference between a third party description of an image, which is to a significant degree independent of its function in the document, and a description supplied by the author of the page, which may be more concise and relevant to the intended purpose of the graphic.  </s>
<s> I would tend to prefer functional descriptions.  </s>
<s> Unnecessarily detailed accounts of visual appearance are generally not useful, and in most cases it should be possible to taylor the description ;to the purpose of the image.  </s>
<s> Essentially, what is needed ;is a ;textual substitute ;for the ;graphical resource.  </s>
<s> The HTML specification does not provide an appropriate context in which to engage in a detailed treatment of this distinction; but it should be discussed in the markup guidelines.  </s>
<s> Gregg Vanderheiden's formulation is the best that I have read so far.  </s>
