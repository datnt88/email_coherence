Dave Reynolds was asking me about the relationship between plain literals and xsd:string, i.e is a plain literal without a lang tag (modulo some funny characters) an xsd:string. 
I adopted the policy of referring him to the spec and indeed he came back and said "found it, its in the bit about entailment rules." 
"Bu**er", I said, that section is now informative! 
I just wanted to check whether we have a normative statement in the specs that _:a eg:prop "aaa" . 
xsd:string entails _:a eg:prop "aaa"^^xsd:string . 
for suitable values of "aaa". 
I should check this myself, but I'm burned this morning and don't want to forget ... Anyone know? 
Does it matter? 
Is there anything else we might have lost by making that section informative? 
Brian I think it's not entirely up to us to make this statement normatively, as it depends upon the definition of xsd:string which is not in our remit. 
There was also a small matter (I think) that some valid plain literals were not valid xsd:string, or vice versa, which would kill the entailment as simply stated (or is that now behind us with the NFC revision?) -- as hinted at by 'for suitable values of "aaa"'. 
I suggest the entailment should follow logically from, rather than be asserted by, our specification together with the xsd specification, which I think it does. 
And maybe reinforced by a suitable test case. 
#g Graham Klyne GK@NineByNine.org True. 
I will put an appropriate remark into the normative section 5. Done.

Eric, I have not copied this into shadow TR space - I didn't want to mess with the docs in the middle of the publishing process. 
I leave it to you to see if you can get the updated version published. 
Pat - thanks - that was very quick.
