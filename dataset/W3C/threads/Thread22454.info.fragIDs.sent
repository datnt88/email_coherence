Hello! 
Are you aware of IDL's syntax wrt indentifiers and case sensitivity? 
It is not allowed to use an identifier twice with the same name and just different casing. 
So this is wrong: interface DocumentContext { attribute Documentdocument; and this: Node setNode(in wstring name, in Node node); 
omniidl2 (the stub compiler from omniORB2), fails to compile this. 
Also I have had problems using IDL syntax words as identifiers, so Attribute may not be a good name for an interface. 
omniidl2 seems to compile it without problems though.

Thanks! I'll make the mechanical changes you mention and look for more ... But Attribute will require a decision by the WG to change. 
Attrib?? AttrNode?? Suggestions/straw vote?

It seems that these have been removed from the spec, for one reason or another. 
But as people are proofreading, please look out for this pattern and report these "bugs" to us.

Here's a list of what I corrected... 
I hope I remembered it all: html.idl: line 161: getItem(in Object name, in Object index); name apparently conflicts with the attribute called name above. 
line 163: getTags(in wstring name); line 183: getItem(in wstring name); line 310: attribute Object object; dtd.idl: line 36: attribute ContentType contentType; core.idl: line 92: Node setNode(in wstring name, in Node node); line 126: attribute Document document; entities.idl: 
line 33: attribute Notation notation; Cheers ANOQ of the Sun / Johnny Andersen E-Mail: anoq@vip.cybercity.dk or anoq@berlin-consortium.org Homepage: http://users.cybercity.dk/~ccc25861/
