Some of these may be obsolete. 
I remember an email from Charles saying that there are now free, readily available user agents that are ok with tables (Am I remembering this right?). 
With Wendy's stats about the number of sites using tables (almost 80%), maybe we should drop this one. 
The "until user agents" may have been reached. 
4.3, 4.1 ,13.2, could go in "Use markup or a data model to provide the logical structure of content" - could just add "use the markup to give as many details about the document as possible including......" Lisa Thursday, 25 January, 2100 UTC (4 PM US Eastern, 10 PM France, 8 AM Eastern Australia), on the W3C/MIT Longfellow bridge: +1-617-252-1038, with the following agenda: The purpose of this meeting is to consider the relationship between WCAG 1.0 and WCAG 2.0. 
1. 
The practice of the working group has been to issue errata to the 1.0 document as needed, and we have also published a revised version of the 1.0 techniques, while working steadily on version 2.0. 
This policy is not, however, expressed as a formal resolution of the working group. 
Are we in agreement regarding this point? 
How far should our efforts to maintain version 1.0 extend? 
2. Consider the checkpoint mapping which describes the relationship between WCAG 1.0 and WCAG 2.0: There are a number of WCAG 1.0 checkpoints which do not have any clear correspondence to the WCAG 2.0 requirements (they are documented near the end of the checkpoint map under the heading "checkpoints without a clear home"). 
a. 
A number of these checkpoints can best be classified as techniques (or technology-specific requirements), e.g., the checkpoints related to layout tables and image maps, which are artefacts of HTML for the most part. 
Even if they enter WCAG 2.0 at the technique/technology-specific level however, under which checkpoints should they appear? 
2. Are there any additional checkpoints that need to be added to WCAG 2.0 to complete the correspondence with version 1.0? 
3. Are there any WCAG 2.0 checkpoints which should be reworked so as to encompass requirements from WCAG 1.0? 
The WCAG 1.0 checkpoints which lack definite relationships with the 2.0 document are listed below (the following is exerpted from the checkpoint map): The issue of priorities which Wendy raises at the end of the checkpoint map will be considered when we discuss prioritization issues. 
Please note also that the question of "user agent capabilities", raised again on the list this week, will be at the top of the agenda of next week's meeting. 
WCAG 1.0 checkpoints without a clear home I did not assign the following WCAG 1.0 checkpoints to any WCAG 2.0 checkpoints because it was not clear where they fit. 
* 4.1 Clearly identify changes in the natural language of a document's text and any text equivalents (e.g., captions). 
[Priority 1] - Perhaps fits with 2.3 - Give users control of mechanisms that cause extreme changes in context? 
* 9.1 Provide client-side image maps instead of server-side image maps except where the regions cannot be defined with an available geometric shape. 
[Priority 1] - Perhaps with 1.1 Provide text equivalents? 
* 4.3 Identify the primary natural language of a document. 
[Priority 3] * 11.3 Provide information so that users may receive documents according to their preferences (e.g., language, content type, etc.) [Priority 3] - Perhaps with 2.1 Provide consistent interaction and navigation mechanisms? 
* 13.2 Provide metadata to add semantic information to pages and sites. 
* 2.2 Ensure that foreground and background color combinations provide sufficient contrast when viewed by someone having color deficits or when viewed on a black and white screen. 
[Priority 2 for images, Priority 3 for text]. 
* 5.3 Do not use tables for layout unless the table makes sense when linearized. 
Otherwise, if the table does not make sense, provide an alternative equivalent (which may be a linearized version). 
[Priority 2] * 5.4 If a table is used for layout, do not use any structural markup for the purpose of visual formatting. 
[Priority 2]?? * 13.10 Provide a means to skip over multi-line ASCII art. 
[Priority 3] I'm on jury duty this week so will be unable to attend today's call. 
Unfortunately, my time off work has also prevented me from getting at my action item from last week. 
Dick Brown, Microsoft Thursday, 8 February, 2100 UTC (4 PM US Eastern, 10 PM France, 8 AM Eastern Australia) on the W3C/MIT Longfellow bridge: +1-617-252-1038: The main purpose of this meeting is to start discussing and developing techniques relative to the version 2.0 guidelines.The 
latest list of technology-specific requirements is at http://www.w3.org/WAI/gl/WCAG20/checkpoints.html(currently this is the 23 August 2000 version, but will soon be updated with proposals from Wendy). 
If time permits, we may also devote further consideration to the issue of identifying the checkpoints and techniques in respect of which the issue of user agent capabilities arises.

just assign all the outstanding action items to me. 
:P Thursday, 15 March, 2100 UTC (4 PM US Eastern, 10 PM France, 8 AM Friday Eastern Australia), on the W3C/MIT Longfellow bridge: +1-617-252-1038. 
Agenda: 1. What should we call the three levels of requirements enunciated in the guidelines (in particular the "technology-specific" ones)? 
At the face to face meeting, there was opposition to calling them "techniques". 
Several proposals have been mentioned on different occasions, including: a. Guidelines / checkpoints / technology-specific checkpoints (this proposal was rejected in an earlier meeting). 
b. Categories / guidelines / checkpoints (proposed by Gregg?) c. Guidelines / requirements / checkpoints (proposed by Charles); note that there is opposition to any use of the term "requirement" in the guidelines (this needs to be clarified as I am not sure who raised it; I think Wendy mentioned it at the meeting). 
2. Should 2.1 be split into two checkpoints? 
3. Should checkpoint 2.4 be dropped on account of its being a user agent requirement? 
4. Action items from the face to face meeting. 
5. Next meeting (who will be attending the CSUN conference next week?). 
The next Web Content Guidelines working group meeting will be held on Thursday, 29 March, 2100 UTC, on the W3C/MIT Longfellow bridge: 1. 
The latest draft of WCAG 2.0, to be published shortly, incorporating changes agreed to at the face to face meeting and in last week's teleconference. 
Regarding checkpoint 2.1, the requirement to provide more than one path or mechanism to find content, seems inappropriate to comparatively small or uncomplicated web sites. 
How should the checkpoint be refined? 
Naturally, you are welcome to raise other issues in connection with the latest draft. 
2. Checkpoint 3.3 (writing style and cognition): how can this be improved? 
Should it be deleted? 
See the mailing list thread at (Kynn's original proposal was to remove the checkpoint). 
What should be the role of readability measures and testing in the formulation or implementation of requirements affecting language comprehension. 
My regrets, I am travelling on Thursday. 
I keep missing these meetings! --Kynn Kynn Bartlett kynn@idyllmtn.com 
I do not think I will be able to be at the meeting tonight, I am a bit on the tied side to stay up to midnight. 
I will have a look to the new draft, and of course I disagree with deleting 3.3 But you all know that, Lisa
