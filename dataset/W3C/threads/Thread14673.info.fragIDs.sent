<s> Hi Rob, This is what I do..................in this instance in layout table cells........ooops!.........not sure about the access key stuff (I just stick it in so one day when it is implemented I might just have to alter it, instead of starting from scratch), but the rest works pretty well for me..................

<s> The page title in the head tag (that is at the very top of the browser, or, at the top of this message, for instance).  </s>
<s> "About us" This is what the screenreader reads first.  </s>
<s> "Welcome to the Democratic Access About us Page" or "The Democratic Access Contact Info Page", tells the visually impaired reader "who" it is "about".  </s>
<s> The image is made at 1 by 1 pixels, but by referencing at 0 by 0, it never renders visibly in any browser that I have tested.  </s>
