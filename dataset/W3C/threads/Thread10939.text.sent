If we want to change the CSS class selector character from ".", we should set whatever political process is needed into motion immediately. 
There are only a few implementations now. 
We should fix this now. 
We should also consider approaching the HTML ERB to ask them to change the HTML DTD to be compatible with the XML-HTML DTD as soon as possible (HTML 3.2? 
Cougar?). 
This change should not invalidate current documents. 
Subject: CSS1 becomes W3C Proposed Recommendation From: Hakon Lie howcome@w3.org 
The CSS1 specification has moved from being a W3C Working Draft to a W3C Proposed Recommendation. 
From [1]: Cascading Style Sheets, level 1 W3C Proposed Recommendation 12 Nov 1996 Status of this document This document is in the course of review by the members of the World-Wide Web Consortium. 
This is a stable document derived from internal Working Drafts of the W3C HTML Editorial Review Board and the public working draft WD-css1-960911. 
Details of this review have been distributed to member's representatives. 
Comments by non-members should be sent to www-style@w3.org. 
The review period will end on 11 December 1996 24:00 GMT. 
Within 14 days from that time, the document's disposition will be announced: it may become a W3C Recommendation (possibly with minor changes), or it may revert to Working Draft status, or it may be dropped as a W3C work item. 
This document does not at this time imply any endorsement by the Consortium's staff or member organizations.

Sorry, I haven't been paying as close attention to this list as perhaps I should have. 
What's the problem with CSS using '.' as a class selector indicator? 
-Chris Chris Wilson cwilso@microsoft.com 
It is a useful SGML NAME character: Since the SGML Reference Concrete Syntax ("regular SGML") doesn't allow underscore as a word-joiner, the loss of "." is a problem.

It's not actually lost; any character can be escaped in a CSS selector name. 
According to section 7.2 of the CSS PR, 'in CSS1, selectors...can also contain escaped characters and any Unicode character as a numeric code...the backslash followed by at most four hexadecimal digits (0..9A..F) stands for the Unicode character with that number...any character except a digit can be escaped to remove its special meaning, by putting a backslash in front, Example: "\"" is a string consisting of one double quote.' Does this suffice to address your concerns?

Sent:Friday, November 15, 1996 9:52 AM Subject:RE: CSS1 becomes W3C Proposed Recommendation No. It would be much simpler all around for interoperability if CSS1 abided by the naming conventions of the Reference Concrete Syntax. 
In fact, insofar as CSS1 has some (integral?) relation with HTML, I see no reason why it shouldn't square with naming conventions legal in HTML. 
Or are you saying that we should take something bog-standard and gratuitously break it with an unnecessary escaping "convention"? 
Arjun "Features whose purpose is to cause errors should be removed." -- Erik Naggum My post wasn't meant so much to say that the current CSS spec should be changed as to encourage conversation to decide if it should be. 
Since nobody else seems concerned, I guess this isn't a big problem, and the workaround will be okay for me. 
That would make me feel more comfortable :^) Paul Presscod Boycott Shell Oil worldwide!
