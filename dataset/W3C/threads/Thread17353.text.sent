On the Access Board web site, they provide the following guidance: "In general, the "safest" and most useful form of style sheets are "external" style sheets, in which the style rules are set up in a separate file." 
My question is if a web page includes html font tags and an external style sheet will this override user-defined style sheets? 
The html font tags are hard coded throughout the page. 
For Example: Thanks in advance, Kim Dear Kim, Without wishing to seem rude, it isn't hard to make a simple web page with attached style sheet and embedded fonts, and see for yourself what happens, surely? 
It should only take you a few minutes to test, not much more than (You can always borrow one of the many publicly available style sheets if you are not confident enough in CSS to make your own yet. 
I have a couple on my web site for example, at http://lois.co.uk/services/access.shtml#styles. 
They are not beautiful, but more than adequate for testing. 
You can use the sample pages too, and add some font tags. 
Don't forget to test in a few browsers, as the results may not be identical.) Lois Wakeman Hi Kim, Lois, ... Well, it doesn't take masses of time, if you have a lot of browsers already installed and know where to look in the specification. 
According to CSS specification font elements in HTML are supposed to be over-ridden by almost everything. 
The specific approach is that they are given a particular place in the CSS cascade which is very low on the priority order. 
You could look at the "Cascade" section of the CSS specifications. 
(And yes, testing this stuff in lots of browsers would be cool. 
Looking in the CSS test suite to find out what they already know would be a sensible way to reduce your workload).

Hi Kim If I have read your question correctly you are talking about the cascade of style sheets. 
In-line formatting such as: Will override anything you have declared in the external style sheet. 
There are 3 places to declare the style of a HTML tag: 1. in-line 2. in the head of the HTML page 3. in an external file If you think about it in the simplest of ways: The browser will 'look' for instructions on how to display a tag firstly in-line, then in the header, then externally, the 'closest' instruction will take priority.

For Example: Thanks in advance, Kim Hi Lois, thanks for the help. 
I already know how to create a style sheet. 
I am testing someone else's site right now and am unsure of the 508 guidelines when it comes to inline styles vs css. 
This site uses both a css and in some pages includes inline styles. 
What I would like to know is if this makes it non-compliant bc inline styles overwrite a user-defined style sheets? 
I was unsure if inline styles actually overwrite what a user would set for their style sheet. 
Any comments would be greatly appreciated. 
Thanks! 
Kim Inline styles are normally CSS! 
I suggest you look at the CSS 2.1 draft. 
The exact precedence of different sources, including presentational attributes is, I think, one of the key things they wanted to clarify. 
Of the top of my head, a user !important style ought to be able to override everything; in the sense that IE accessibilty options for fonts and colours are an interface onto the user style sheet, it is certainly the case that real implemenations override authors completely. 
If by inline styles, you mean ....style="property: value; ..."..., the real objection to them is that they encourage slopply coding practices in which there is no consistent style, and are, essentially, no better than using font elements. 
Kim, Sorry - I completely misunderstood the question there - doh! 
The question you ask is very complicated in its implications, and the simple answer is, I don't know, though I am sure the more knowledgeable members here may have a better idea. 
I would *hope* that anyone savvy enough to use their own style sheet would make sure their rules were set as !important if they needed to override everything. 
(It seems there is disagreement about exactly where inline styles and font tags are located in the cascade anyway, reading the two replies you had yesterday. 
Unfortunately I have a lot on today, as this is something I'd like to investigate for myself. 
I wonder if anyone reading this has some insight?) Lois Wakeman
