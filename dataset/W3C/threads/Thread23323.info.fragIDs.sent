<s> I have previously suggested that DOM Level 3 add some form of getType() method to the Attr interface to report the type of the attribute declared in a DTD.  </s>
<s> One important use-case for this information is any XPath based application such as XSLT and XPointer which need to behave differently depending on which attributes have type ID.  </s>
<s> I was told that this information would be available through abstract schemas.  </s>
<s> Now that abstract schemas has gone to that great web site in the sky, I'd like to reraise this issue.  </s>
<s> I think a simple method in the Attr interface which returns the type as declared by the DTD is important.  </s>
<s> I think this is a separate issue from the type declared by any schema, since a document may have both a DTD and a schema.  </s>
<s> How to handle this for schemas is relatively hard, but handling it for DTDs is not.  </s>
<s> SAX has been doing this for several years 9albeit with a few bugs in both interface and implementations.) The exact signature and behavior can be discussed, but I would really like to have this information available as a standard part of DOM.  </s>

<s> I think the general dropping of Abstract Schema will not generally cause a new DTD-specific API to emerge.  </s>
<s> At least this is not currently within the work of the DOM WG.  </s>
<s> On the other hand ID's has been something that the specification has dealt with in the past.  </s>
<s> As long as you stick to IDs of the type defined by DTDs, I don't think it is a stretch to say that the same functionality would be expected to work in XML Schema, which has direct support for this type, if you are not distracted by all the additional keys it supports.  </s>
<s> Exposing this by supporting Document.getElementByID has always been optional, allowing for non-validating parsers.  </s>
<s> What if there were a boolean read-only attribute on an attribute node to identify attribute nodes known to be ID's -- would this be enough to be useful?  </s>
<s> Obviously on non-validating parsers, the boolean would always be false.  </s>
<s> Or would you require something more to solve the problem?  </s>

<s> I'm not asking for a full-DTD specific API.  </s>
<s> I'm asking for a simple way to get the attribute type from an Attr object.  </s>
<s> This is similar in scope to the current specified attribute in the Attr interface, or the maps of entities and notations in the DocumentType interface.  </s>
<s> These are all information placed in the document model by the DTD rather than the instance document.  </s>
<s> This doesn't worry me too much, though I do think that DTDs deserve to be preferenced over schemas when they conflict; (e.g. if the DTD says an attribute is an ID and the schema says it's a CDATA) then the DTD type is reported.  </s>
<s> For better or worse, DTDs are part of XML 1.0.  </s>
<s> Schemas are not.  </s>
<s> What about attributes declared to have type ID in the internal DTD subset?  </s>
<s> I think all parsers would be required to handle these, whether validating or not.  </s>
<s> It would be useful, but it's not enough.  </s>
<s> There are nine other attribute types (ten if you count "undeclared" as a possibility).  </s>
<s> Some other things we might want: 1.  </s>
<s> Using IDREF and IDREFS attributes as internal links 2. Determining the notation of an element based on its NOTATION type attribute 3. Using ENTITY or ENTITIES type attributes to load external media.  </s>
<s> 4. Using the type of an attribute to determine in-memory normalization of an attribute value One type isn't enough.  </s>
<s> We need all of them.  </s>
<s> Finally, I'll note that the Infoset does specify the [attribute type] as a characteristic of an attribute information item.  </s>
<s> If it's a goal of DOM3 to fully support all infoset properties, then this one is a must, and I think far more important than such weird things as the actual encoding.  </s>
