<s> FWIW, many RDF triple stores actually create "quads" rather than triples -- the reason is that since each triple comes from somewhere (usually a document), one can keep and manage a "provenance" URI very easily.  </s>
<s> RDFlib does this, as does Kowari and I think a number of others (those are the two we use).  </s>
<s> We make heavy use of this, and it seem foolish if the query language didn't give access to these.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, other triple stores don't have these context URIs, and thus mandating them would be equally foolish.  </s>
<s> I can think of a couple of pretty easy designs depending on whether we expect most stores to have these fields (in which case make it a recognized part of the query results where those stores that don't have it return *Unknown*) orif we want to make it an optional featurewe can simply have this be something optionally in a query that can be ignored by stores that don't provide contexts) Seems to me that ignoring a feature that is already implemented in a lot of triple stores might not be the best way to go -- especially as we, and at least 5-6 other groups I know, make heavy use of these context fields and would hate not to be able to share them -JH Professor James Hendler http://www.cs.umd.edu/users/hendler  </s>

<s> Just because something sits outside the purview of a particular data model doesn't mean (imo) it should be considered as lying outside the scope of reference for a query language that queries that data model.  </s>
<s> Given my usual experiential frame of reference (XQuery, no surprise), there were things that the XQuery Founding Fathers and Mothers included in the data model for XQuery that extended beyond the data model for XML, altho XQuery's main purpose was arguably simply to query XML.  </s>
<s> They decided they needed them (primarily PostSchemaValidationInfoset information and the concept of multiple doc fragments) however, and that was that.  </s>
<s> In short, there's precedent for devising a data model for an RDF query language that works with constructs that aren't included in the data model of RDF itself.  </s>
