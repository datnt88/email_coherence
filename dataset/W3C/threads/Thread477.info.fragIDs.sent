<s> The tidy-dev list is probably the right place.  </s>
<s> Sorry if we didn't respond.  </s>
<s> On the enclose-block-text issue, I am not highly familiar with the issue it addresses - mixed content model support in block elements - but taking a look at the text itself, it may be technically correct.  </s>
<s> Basically, it has enclosed all the otherwise unenclosed text nodes within a p ... /p pair.  </s>
<s> Agree, however, that the inserted p tags should probably usurp all content of its parent.  </s>
<s> Should be , strong Forrabury /strong , strong Fowey /strong /p I.e. the opening p tag needs to be moved back to the beginning of the li content.  </s>
<s> Coming in the middle, as it does now, it renders strangely on the browser because beginning a new paragraph starts on a new line.  </s>
<s> Even at the beginning, putting in p elements messes with the vertical spacing on li elements.  </s>
<s> Opinions?  </s>
<s> On the spacing issue, I think we are essentially at a feature freeze for current work and are trying to clear up bugs and couple remaining issues.  </s>
<s> Can you enter a feature request on Source Forge?  </s>
<s> take it easy, Charlie  </s>

<s> While I read all such bug reports, I'm not an expert in many of these areas, so I don't respond unless I have an answer worth listening to.  </s>
<s> However, responding to possible bug reports is made much easier if the person reporting the problem describes in detail the version of Tidy, any command line options, any configuration file settings, a simple test case (if possible) that illustrates the problem, and information on what they tried to find the cause of the problem - saying "it doesn't work" doesn't get much attention.  </s>
<s> And preferably if the bug is reported through the bug trackers at http://sourgeforge.net/projects/tidy , it has a much better chance of not being ignored.  </s>
