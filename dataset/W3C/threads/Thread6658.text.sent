Dear World Wide Web Consortium, I have seen the term 'web site' and 'website' and 'web-site' used interchangeably in the industry and on your w3.org site. 
Can you tell me the w3.org stance on this term or direct me to an email resource who can answer this question?

They say "Web site" for formal writing and that "website" is fine for informal and friendly writing. 
I believe that in the UK "website" is one word and preferred, per the Oxford dictionaries. 
(see the section on Internet and Web) Hope this helps, Susan Lesch http://www.w3.org/People/Lesch/ World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) http://www.w3.org/ Susan: This is very helpful.
