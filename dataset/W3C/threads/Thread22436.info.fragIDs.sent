<s> Hello, I noticed that AttributeList is only referenced in the Document interface as a return value for the factory method Document.createAttributeList().  </s>
<s> Nowhere else in the DOM is it used or referenced.  </s>
<s> Since Element.getAttributes() returns a NodeIterator  </s>
<s> can't AttributeList and Document.createAttributeList()  </s>
<s> be deprecated?  </s>
<s> IMHO DOM users (and implementors) can always create their own collection of Attributes if they need to since it isn't used at all by the DOM.  </s>
<s> Is this another legacy thing or is it a placeholder for a future interface rev?  </s>
<s> Its no problem implementing these things but it just seems like the simpler the better... Thanks, Claude Zervas  </s>
<s> This is only a left over from a previous draft where and AttributeList was used in various places such as getAttributes().  </s>
<s> Arnaud Le Hors - W3C, User Interface Domain - www.w3.org/People/Arnaud  </s>
<s> It is often useful to access attributes by name, so the AttributeList acts as an associative array.  </s>
<s> This may not be strictly necessary with direct access on the Element object.  </s>
