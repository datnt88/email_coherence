Hello, I noticed that AttributeList is only referenced in the Document interface as a return value for the factory method Document.createAttributeList(). 
Nowhere else in the DOM is it used or referenced. 
Since Element.getAttributes() returns a NodeIterator 
can't AttributeList and Document.createAttributeList() 
be deprecated? 
IMHO DOM users (and implementors) can always create their own collection of Attributes if they need to since it isn't used at all by the DOM. 
Is this another legacy thing or is it a placeholder for a future interface rev? 
Its no problem implementing these things but it just seems like the simpler the better... Thanks, Claude Zervas 
This is only a left over from a previous draft where and AttributeList was used in various places such as getAttributes().

It is often useful to access attributes by name, so the AttributeList acts as an associative array. 
This may not be strictly necessary with direct access on the Element object.
