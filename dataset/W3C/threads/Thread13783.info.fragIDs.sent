<s> One of the things I would like to have said, had I been a little more awake, is that I think that compliance with a DTD is a priority one item, for reasons outlined before by Daniel and Jason as well as myself.  </s>

<s> Agree. Actually, this is not just a guideline, but the requirement by the HTML specification.  </s>
<s> Otherwise, such document is invalid.  </s>
<s> One thing I'm particularly disappointed is that none of the previous versions of Page Author Guidelines themselves are conforming to the DTD.  </s>
<s> This is really bad.  </s>
<s> If we don't follow our guideline, who else would follow?  </s>
<s> Furthermore, "How to Release a W3C Technical Report" [1] says: [1] URL:http://www.w3.org/Guide/Reports.html  </s>
<s> W3C Technical Reports Style The authoritative version of a document must be a conforming HTML 4.0, 3.2, or 2.0 document.  </s>
<s> See the W3C HTML Validation Service.  </s>
<s> Technical reports should follow the Styleguide for Online Hypertext as well.  </s>
<s> A technical report must not have any broken links.  </s>
<s> Bear in mind that our reports are used as world-class primary reference material.  </s>
<s> Readability across a wide variety of browsers and platforms is far more important than using jazzy features.  </s>
<s> At some point, what we write becomes History.  </s>
<s> WAI Accessibilty Guidelines should indeed be world-class primary reference material.  </s>
<s> We must be very serious about the markup of our guidelines.  </s>
<s> Otherwise, people will be dubious of our work.  </s>

<s> I would like to reiterate most emphatically the importance of ensuring that the guidelines themselves meet the highest standards of markup.  </s>
<s> Conformity to the HTML 4.0 strict DTD would be a necessary, though not a sufficient condition for this requirement to be met: there should be no &amp;nbsp; character entities or any other characters used unnecessarily, the markup should convey structure rather than presentation, the table should  </s>
<s> use HEADERS, SCOPE, and SUMMARY attributes appropriately, etc.  </s>
<s> The best means of achieving this result is to edit the markup by hand or with an SGML editor (not a web authoring tool).  </s>
<s> I understand that SGML editors verify compliance with the DTD as one makes changes to the document and can help to ensure that the structure is sound.  </s>
<s> Please note that in making these remarks, I am not implicitly criticising previous versions of the document.  </s>
<s> To be frank, I haven't taken the time to examine the markup in detail, but this task must be thoroughly undertaken as part of the preparation of the next draft.  </s>
<s> Indeed.  </s>
<s> We should lead by example.  </s>
<s> I'm maintaining /Mobile Web area at W3C, and all documents under /Mobile are conforming to HTML 4.0 Strict DTD (I never publish Web pages without validation!).  </s>
<s> And also, I'd love to make our pages conforming to WAI Page Author Guidelines.  </s>
<s> Mobile Access does need accessibility consideration, so input from WAI is greatly appreciated.  </s>
<s> If you need help, I can validate and fix the documents.  </s>
<s> Now I'm fixing up markup errors of previous press releases (under /Press ).  </s>
<s> If necessary, I'll do the same work for /WAI as well.  </s>
