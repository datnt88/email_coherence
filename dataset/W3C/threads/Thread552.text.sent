I use a program called GEDPAGE to generate genealogical charts as HTML pages. 
When I run TIDY on them I get the following error message and the hr tags are rendered unintelligible. 
line 13 column 1 - Warning: unescaped hr in pre content Can anyone please tell me why?

Probably because both HR and PRE are block level elements. 
Thus PRE should not contain HR .

Graham F Coward Victoria Australia Visit the COWARD Family History Site at www.alphalink.com.au/~coward/ pre only allows inline content, which hr is not: If the hr tags generated by GEDPAGE are just for decoration, i.e. between two preformatted charts, this could be changed to Otherwise if hr tags are used to draw lines within the charts you would need to replace those with a series dashes -- also more portable than an hr , which may be rendered differently by the browser. 
Klaus Johannes Rusch KlausRusch@atmedia.net Thanks Bob and Klaus. 
That makes sense to me. 
The W3 Validator doesn't like it either. 
Unfortunately there is not much I can do about it except to stop using GEDPAGE. 
It generates far too many files to change each one manually and it works OK with all the major browsers. 
I might try e-mailing the developer of GEDPAGE and see what he says.

In 001d01c18f8b$59e39e00$636fa1ca@grahamcoward , "Graham Coward" between two need which Graham, depending on how the hr elements are used, a simple preprocessing program might be able to change those (if the GEDPAGE developer does not want to change that program) -- feel free to drop me a sample file if you need help.
