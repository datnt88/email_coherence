<s> Hello All, This is with reference to the definition of complex tables and use of summary attribute.  </s>
<s> What might go into a summary is also demonstrated.  </s>
<s> As a user of AT, I regard tables with multiple header rows and / or columns as a complex table.  </s>
<s> I'll illustrate this in a moment.  </s>
<s> Of course tables in which header (or data) cells need to be associated to data cells that are not exactly below them or exactly to their right (in a l-r system) are complex.  </s>
<s> If the purpose is to say complex tables need summaries, I'll add a few more types to the above: - a table (otherwise characterized as simple) which has rows for control breaks.  </s>
<s> eg.  </s>
<s> First column is labeled Month and cells below it contain Jan, Feb, etc.  </s>
<s> But every fourth cell does not contain a month but a description like: Total for Q1, Total for Q2.  </s>
<s> In this case the summary attribute should be used to explain presence of row with quarterly totals to a screen reader user .  </s>
<s> - Another case is also a simple table with no column headings at all!  </s>
<s> Consider: Caption: Train timings from New York to Washington DC (Following are cell contents separated by a comma) Train #1 Departs 5 am, Arrives 8 am Train # 2, Departs 5.30 am, Arrives 8.45 am Train # 3, Departs 6 am, arrives 8.55 am and so forth.  </s>
<s> In this table a summary should be used to tell the screen reader user to navigate the data table withverbosity setting to read only row headers.  </s>
<s> - Yet another case is David's example of traffic cop: a table in which the third column cells contains data in a list structure.  </s>
<s> There can be multiple links in a cell as in this case.  </s>
<s> It makes sense to navigate this table as a data table but when one gets to the third column, one must simply exit table nav mode and use arrow keys to read each list item or link separately.  </s>
<s> In table navigation mode the content of third columns are read as a chunk which can be overwhelming and not very useful.  </s>
<s> A summary should aid navigation by explaining this to the user.  </s>
<s> For simple tables with one row and one column of headers summary is really not necessary.  </s>
<s> Complexxity caused by col span and row span: four examples follow.  </s>
<s> Note: in examples below, R1C1 means row 1 col 1, and so forth.  </s>
<s> I have not used HTML code and hope the manner of presentation used below is effective.  </s>
<s> Example 1: Table with col span in first row: First row of headers: R1C1, R1C2 col span= 2, R1C3 colspan =3 Second row of headers: R2C1, R2C2, R2C3, R2C4, R2C5, R2C6 Then there are data rows with six cells.  </s>
<s> Example 2: Same as example 1 above but second row of headers appears first and is followed by the first row with three cells, two of which use col span as above.  </s>
<s> Example 3: Same as example 1 but also introduces rowspan from row# 3 onwards in data rows in first column Example 4: First and last columns use rowspan starting with row# 3 which are data rows First row of headers: R1C1, R1C2 col span= 2, R1C3 colspan =3, R1C4 Second row of headers: R2C1, R2C2, R2C3, R2C4, R2C5, R2C6, R2C7=empty Third row (data row): R3C1 rowspan=2, R3C2, R3C3, R3C4, R3C5, R3C6, R3C7 rowspan=3 Fourth row (data row): R4C2, R4C3, R4C4, R4C5, R4C6 Fifth row (data row): R5C1, R5C2, R5C3, R5C4, R5C5, R5C6 ... and so forth where row span in first and last columns are not synchronized.  </s>
<s> And there are even more complex designs.  </s>
<s> Screen readers are generally programmed to read column / row headers when they change.  </s>
<s> So unless a user scours the table layout and understands the structure and the spanning which can be very very daunting in situations like example 3 and 4 above, it is difficult to understand the contents.  </s>
<s> Expecting a screen reader user to understan a table that uses only th and scope can be an accessibility nightmare.  </s>
<s> Such tables need headers and id.  </s>
<s> I admit screen readers can do a better job like announcing span, repeating header for spanned cells and interpreting scope better.  </s>
<s> But this will not obviate the need for a summary or cause such a table to be characterized as simple fromm the user's as well as the developer's perspective.  </s>
<s> The summary should explain the layout and how rows and columns are spanned.  </s>
<s> For instance, a summary for example 4 should explain that R1C2 has two sub columns R2C2 and R2C3, etc.  </s>
<s> The first column contains row headers that apply to multiple rows.  </s>
<s> The last columns has remarks that apply to more than one row.  </s>
<s> Armed with this info one can navigate effectively as well as efficiently and not devote a whole lot of time to figuring out the layout.  </s>

<s> * Look up http://www.deque.com  </s>
<s> *  </s>
<s> I certainly agree with Sailesh that tables with multiple header rows and/or header columns (and with row and/or col spans) are complex and difficult to comprehend with a screen reader.  </s>
<s> However that is not the definition of complexity that interests me.  </s>
<s> I want the question to be, for what class of tables are TH (and scope) inadequate to present the headings structure of the table so that the headers/id markup would be required.  </s>
<s> Those are the tables I want to be called complex.  </s>
<s> We can leave the word "complex" out of the requirement and paraphrase from Sailesh's message with: Headers/id markup is required for tables in which heading cells are associated with data cells that are not exactly below them or exactly to their right.  </s>
<s> (I don't like the wording either!) As Sailesh knows from the tool he works with, when all heading cells for a  </s>
<s> data cell are found in data cell's row and column (an l-r system) then the headers/id markup, if you want to add it, can be algorithmically generated knowing the heading rows and columns, in effect, knowing the TH's.  </s>
<s> That is  </s>
<s> exactly why I think headers/id markup should not be required in these cases.  </s>
<s> Since the headings information can be algorithmically generated, I think we should leave it to screen readers (assistive technology) to figure implement the algorithm.  </s>
<s> I still like the idea of requiring summary or CAPTION for data tables and summary="" for layout tables.  </s>

<s> * Simple tables have at most one row and/or one column of headings.  </s>

<s> I think we could define "irregular cell" and "simple cell" and with those two definitions cover the three above ... but that is getting too technical.  </s>
<s> I think the accessibility advice you propose ("use valid code and use headers where possible") is OK for advice but in some cases we think headers/id markup should be required and we were trying to understand when that would be.  </s>
