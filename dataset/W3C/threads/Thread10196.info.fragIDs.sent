<s> Suggestions for things for consistency across the docs that the Series Editor - Brian - might want to consider: 1) The phrasing, order and titles of the documents at the start of all the RDF specs, usually in the Introduction section (as Frank raised).  </s>
<s> For example: which I seem to have in a random order; I can't recall how I picked that one.  </s>
<s> Or in the latest primer draft:  </s>
<s> We really need the new model theory doc title if it is changing Pat: Is it something like RDF Formal Semantics: Model Theory ?  </s>
<s> Maybe also consider if this list should be in all documents?  </s>
<s> 2) The [RDF-SEMANTICS] reference labels to use In particular I'm trying to use the new title "RDF Vocabulary ..." [RDF-VOCABULARY] etc. rather than emphasis the schema word.  </s>
<s> 3) The acknowledgements section with respect to current/former WG members.  </s>
<s> I offer my shorter version of the concepts doc section (last two paragraphs): More trivially: 4) Example code block styles I think primer and syntax are mostly in alignment here since they we use the same style.  </s>
<s> I tend to give each one a label, link to it and have files that can be clicked / downloaded / validated particularly for complete examples.  </s>
<s> 5) Figure colo(u)r schemes If we cared, so that the nodes and arcs were similar.  </s>
<s> However Pat's pictures are so pretty, I don't want him to change them ;) I had a comment that the black-on-red nodes I used was bad contrast and a bit difficult to read, especially when printed.  </s>
<s> Maybe the black-on-green nodes also has this problem?  </s>

<s> I was imaging that the current batch would have quite a few glaring stylistic inconsistencies - and fixing those would be the major change before last call.  </s>
<s> However, if there are things we can fix now, than I am not averse to doing so - but with problems like needing to see the new formal semantics in order to reference it, but it's not ready yet - well that's what the next draft will fix.  </s>
<s> Suggestions for the series editor, maybe for the next round ... Status of this document (I think the series editor should draft us all a boiler plate which draws attention to what we are seeking feedback on at this time - I guess individual documents may vary a bit - but the key issues are cross document now) Versions referenced of various docs (specifically all the WD should refence each other, not older versions, this means the publication date needs to be fixed) Style for notes Style and policy with respect to referring to test cases (at least all the normative specs) Titles should all follow what the manual of style says.  </s>

<s> No, lets just make it "RDF Semantics", or "RDF Formal Semantics" if people prefer.  </s>
<s> I'll let Brian choose.  </s>
<s> Toning down the red to pinkish will probably fix that.  </s>
