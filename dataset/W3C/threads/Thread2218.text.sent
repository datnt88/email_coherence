I wonder what the specification says about ``\)'' within a comment and about ``\"'' within a quoted-string. 
To my interpretation of the specs the character will be "quoted" but according to the grammar will terminate the element anyhow. 
I think some clarification would be good there.

Hmmm, that's odd -- it was supposed to say comment = "(" *( ctext | quoted-pair | comment ) ")" quoted-string = ( " *( qdtext | quoted-pair ) " ) I guess that should be put on the errata list. 
.....Roy Roy T. Fielding: Gack! HTTP/1.0 says: And I guess that most depoyed header parsers conform to this. 
You would get subtle but ugly incompatibility problems if you introduce single-character quoting in 1.1. 
In my opinion, we can only change the parsing of quoted strings if we also increase the major version number. 
The 1.1 grammar is fine, the text is in error.
