<s> deltav is responsible for adding full(?) versioning capabilities to webdav.  </s>
<s> A client implementation of Source Code Management system can be easily built to work with webdav server with deltav extensions, something not possible with just webdav impl.  </s>

<s> Simone, The IETF area directors don't like to see a working group go on forever.  </s>
<s> They prefer to see it specify a charter, execute on the charter, publish standards, and disband.  </s>
<s> This keeps the work fresh, encourages completion of deliverables, and allows new working groups to be created with new members.  </s>
<s> The DeltaV working group is a new working group whose charter is to provide versioning extensions to WebDAV.  </s>
<s> If this work was done in the WebDAV working group, it would take a lot longer to get RFC2518 done which would result in fewer WebDAV implementations.  </s>
<s> By separating these concerns, we encourage development of WebDAV servers which are useful now, and get a new set of working group members who are more experienced in versioning and document management systems.  </s>
<s> So you can consider DeltaV as a continuation of WebDAV for versioning and configuration management extensions.  </s>
<s> However, the WebDAV working group is still active as RFC2518 is not yet an Internet Standard.  </s>
