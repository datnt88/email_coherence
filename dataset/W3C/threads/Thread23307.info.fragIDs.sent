<s> I do a lot of j(ava)scripting with the DOM, now I've written some code that makes a (prototype) object that is cloned several times.  </s>
<s> This object has also an event attached.  </s>
<s> In Internet Explorer this event is available on each node that was cloned, in Mozilla this isn't happening.  </s>
<s> When I use the same code to attach an event to a node which is not cloned it all just works fine.  </s>
<s> Because Mozilla normally is acting like it should, following the DOM standard I looked what was written about cloneNode and events.  </s>
<s> Surprisingly there is nothing said about event already on a node which is cloned.  </s>
<s> What should be the correct action?  </s>
<s> Should events be cloned?  </s>
<s> I hope it should, and I think it has to be specified in the DOM(-core).  </s>
<s> My code of the node: // Create prototype image var protoImg = doc.createElement('img');  </s>

<s> FL_DrawZoom);  </s>
<s> The section of the DOM2-core about cloneNode(): cloneNode Returns a duplicate of this node, i.e., serves as a generic copy constructor for nodes.  </s>
<s> The duplicate node has no parent; (parentNode is null.).  </s>
<s> Cloning an Element copies all attributes and their values, including those generated by the XML processor to represent defaulted attributes, but this method does not copy any text it contains unless it is a deep clone, since the text is contained in a child Text node.  </s>
<s> Cloning an Attribute directly, as opposed to be cloned as part of an Element cloning operation, returns a specified attribute (specified is true).  </s>
<s> Cloning any other type of node simply returns a copy of this node.  </s>
<s> Note that cloning an immutable subtree results in a mutable copy, but the children of an EntityReference clone are readonly.  </s>
<s> In addition, clones of unspecified Attr nodes are specified.  </s>
<s> And, cloning Document, DocumentType, Entity, and Notation nodes is implementation dependent.  </s>
<s> Parameters deep of type boolean If true, recursively clone the subtree under the specified node; if false, clone only the node itself (and its attributes, if it is an Element).  </s>
<s> Return Value Node The duplicate node.  </s>
<s> No Exceptions  </s>
<s> That part of the DOM behaviour is specified in DOM-Level-2-Events.  </s>
<s> See the second paragraph under the "Interface EventListener" heading at "When a Node is copied using the cloneNode method the EventListeners attached to the source Node are not attached to the copied Node.  </s>
<s> If the user wishes the same EventListeners to be added to the newly created copy the user must add them manually."  </s>
<s> Personally I just run any objects that I clone through an "event hookup" function.  </s>

<s> [snip]  </s>
<s> In Mozilla we just fixed CloneNode() to behave the same way as Internet Explorer.  </s>
<s> That should be the behavior in Mozilla 1.0, although, if big problems (regressions, ...) arise from that change, it might be reversed.  </s>
<s> Didn't that only clone eventlistners added using "onclick"-like attributes, not onces added using addEventListner as in the example?  </s>
