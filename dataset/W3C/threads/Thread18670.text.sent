WWW: http://www.w3.org/wai/ua Location: 21 Mitchell street FOOTSCRAY Vic 3011, Australia (or W3C INRIA, Route des Lucioles, BP 93, 06902 Sophia Antipolis Cedex, France) I sent comments in [1] on this proposal. 
Ray's proposal is very thin on explanation for the uninitiated. 
I'm not sure how this proposal intersects with the subsequent discussion on 17 Jan [1]. 
From your summary [3], it sounds like the ball's in the DOM WG's court to draft a more detailed proposal.

I recently visited Microsoft (Mac IE), Netscape, Adobe, and Apple. 
I am hoping that as a result of these visits, we will receive evaluations of Mac IE, Netscape, Adobe's SVG Viewer, and Apple's Quicktime player. 
I also expect a review of Grins from Geoff Freed in the near future. 
I have stopped work on this. 
However, I'm paying some attention to deliverables of the QA Working Group (which, by the way, use the WAI guidelines/checkpoints model). 
No progress here from my end. 
I am hoping that JG and I will have a chance to talk about an XML or RDF representation of relationships between the two documents. 
I would like two documents at some point: a) "If you satisfy 508 requirements and these X extra things, you can get UAAG 1.0 Level A (for the following content types labels, etc.)." b) "If you conform to UAAG 1.0 in the following way, you also conform to 508 if you do these extra things." 
I think that UAAG 1.0 and Section 508 are sufficiently different that documents a and b may be suprisingly different. 
_ Ian Ian Jacobs (ij@w3.org) 
http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs AG:: People are populating the template that describes how their products address the 508 provisions. 
If you want to think about what we really want we want them to be able to publish one page that serves both questions. 
So: a key report generator application is one that gathers these pages and presents the information contained there appropriately for UAAG-driven queries. 
One way to get a more robust engine is to kick ideas around in ER. 
There is technology and tool-building capability lurking there and susceptible to recruiting for the right compliance assessment tasks. 
And we should be coordinating with BuyAccessible at Section508.gov. 
They want to be able to treat the template-following pages that live on the Web as a database, too. 
If people should actually be putting these pages up in some strict flavor of HTML for post-processing into the BuyAccessible database, it will help 508.gov and it will help us. 
Or they may have an XML or other data-entry format for submission to the database that we can learn from.

I think we should get a link on the section508 to WAI activities or at least to UAAG when we get a good comparision of UAAG and 508 available.
