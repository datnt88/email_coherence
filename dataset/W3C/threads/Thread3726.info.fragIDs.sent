<s> Terje just pointed this one at me.  </s>
<s> I just looked at it.  </s>
<s> Bj?rn reports an alleged bug.  </s>
<s> I'm not convinced, and commented:  </s>
<s> The bug report seems to me to be in error.  </s>
<s> Or, more specifically, it hinges on whether unescaped ? is allowed in a QUERY_STRING.  </s>
<s> It may be unsafe(?), but is AFAICS nevertheless legal, so ISTM SP is working correctly, and the bug is in the serverside script.  </s>
<s> Lynx agrees: [nick@jarl nick]$ lynx -dump -source [nick@jarl nick]$ lynx -dump -source If someone can convince me otherwise, I could patch it fairly easily to escape 8-bit URIs, but I fear that could introduce serious bugs when working with a 16-bit charset.  </s>
<s> So at the very least I'd have to ask on openjade-devel.  </s>
<s> Bj?rn is basically saying that OpenSP should have escaped the first URL to the second.  </s>
<s> AFAICS it would not be wrong to do so, but neither is it required.  </s>
<s> Who is right?  </s>
<s> Nick Kew  </s>
<s> I am :-) See section 4.2.2 of XML 1.0, * Each disallowed character is converted to UTF-8 [IETF RFC 2279] as one or more bytes.  </s>
<s> * Any octets corresponding to a disallowed character are escaped with the URI escaping mechanism (that is, converted to %HH, where HH is the hexadecimal notation of the byte value).  </s>
<s> * The original character is replaced by the resulting character sequence.  </s>
<s> This is a MUST.  </s>
<s> I don't see any disallowed character under #2.1 of rfc2396 in your testcase.  </s>
<s> Applying the rather different rules you referenced is going to lead to deeper bugs than this alleged one.  </s>
<s> Your testcase was declared as iso-8859-1, so escaping as UTF-8 is at best perverse, and breaks commonsense.  </s>
<s> This is relevant here as  </s>
<s> OpenSP groks SGML (and on the web in general where agents grok some form of HTML).  </s>
<s> If your testcase had declared a 16-bit charset, then AFAICS that rule would lead to more brokenness.  </s>
<s> I'm thinking as I write: what happens if we apply perverse-XML rules when OpenSP's -wxml is in force?  </s>
<s> This avoids breaking SGML, but I'm not convinced about implementing it.  </s>
<s> Terje, how are we applying iconv to incoming documents these days?  </s>
<s> ISTM that any document that is converted to utf-8 before being processed by OpenSP sidesteps this problem altogether (because  </s>
<s> iconv does the job).  </s>
<s> Nick Kew  </s>
<s> All incoming documents are converted to UTF-8 before being fed to OpenSP.  </s>
<s> There is a U+00F6 (LATIN SMALL LETTER O WITH DIAERESIS), URIS most not contain non-ASCII characters, see e.g. section 2.4 of RFC 2396.  </s>
<s> Well, it's a normative requirement of XML 1.0, and actually using UTF-8 for disallowed characters in URIs *is* commonsense, you'll find a similar section in HTML 4.01 (appendix B.2.1), take a look at The requirement in XML 1.0 is however only for the system identifier and there are XML processors that implement it the way the recommendation wants it, e.g.  </s>
