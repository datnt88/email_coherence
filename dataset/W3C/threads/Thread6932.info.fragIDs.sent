<s> Hi Patrick, I would suggest that perhaps uri@w3.org  </s>
<s> would be an even more appropriate forum for this debate?  </s>
<s> Whatever the case, I'll send this to www-talk, BCC'ing uri, and you can decide where to follow-up to.  </s>
<s> To define e.g. an 'http:' URL which is never intended to resolve to anything is IMO contrary to the defined semantics for such URLs and thus bad practice.  </s>
<s> No; you are implying that there is a default base of semantics for HTTP identifiers, that they are intended to resolve to a set of documents, or somesuch.  </s>
<s> HTTP makes no such assumption;  </s>
<s> If the http URI is defined by RFC 2616 (as indicated by section 2.1.1 of of the RFC seems pretty clear --- cut --- 3.2.2 http URL The "http" scheme is used to locate network resources via the HTTP protocol.  </s>
<s> This section defines the scheme-specific syntax and semantics for http URLs.  </s>
<s> http_URL = "http:" "//" host [ ":" port ] [ abs_path [ "?" query ]] If the port is empty or not given, port 80 is assumed.  </s>
<s> The semantics are that the identified resource is located at the server listening for TCP connections on that port of that host, and the Request-URI for the resource is abs_path (section 5.1.2). --- cut --- I.e. there are some defined semantics that http URIs resolve to something located on a server?  </s>
<s> Is the RFC wrong, or am I mis-interpretting it?  </s>
<s> Having said that, I accept that current http URI usage goes well beyond this, i.e. people are assigning http URIs to all sort of things,  </s>
<s> This is my assertion.  </s>
<s> and that we've probably got past the stage where it is worth having the argument.  </s>
<s> Well, it'll take awhile to turn the boat around, but I think it's worth trying...  </s>
<s> A question... If I make an RDF statement about statement about a conceptual namespace, or about the RDFS resource that is at that URI?  </s>
<s> In either case, how do I make a statement about the other one?  </s>
<s> I'm about to submit a number of I-D's to the IETF for several URI schemes, including the following two, which address your question: Web Resource: = the web resource (if any ;-) URI Reification:  </s>
<s> uri:http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns# = the reified URI of the web resource  </s>
<s> e.g. in which case, Bob created the resource but the URI itself was minted by the DOI agency DOI's-R-Us Namespace Reification and Prefixation: xmlns:rdf:http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns# = the namespace, with associated namespace prefix xmlns::http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns# = the namespace, with no namespace prefix I intend to proactively support the URI registration process, taking account of all comments, suggestions, criticisms, etc. with the goal of seeing the above URI schemes registered (along with some others ;-) These two URI schemes belong to the class of URIs called Uniform Resource Primitives (URP) as defined in section 1.1.2 of which is also being revised and expanded as an I-D.  </s>

<s> The HTTP specification can only talk about those aspects of the protocol that  </s>
<s> are relevant to  </s>
<s> HTTP.  </s>
<s> You've just summed up, IMO, the whole issue in a nutshell.  </s>
<s> The HTTP URI is relevant only to the semantics of the HTTP protocol.  </s>
<s> And the HTTP protocol is for *access* of concrete web resources.  </s>
<s> Thus HTTP URIs are only intended to be meaningful to processes based on the HTTP protocol, which expect to *return* something.  </s>
<s> Therefore HTTP URIs are not intended to denote abstract concepts.  </s>
<s> SOAP Web Service endpoints can be named with http:* URIs, and communicated with via XML representations shipped over HTTP.  </s>
<s> But you can't download the service itself; that wouldn't make sense.  </s>
<s> I would argue that the HTTP URI in that case does not denote the service, but a description of the service, if dereferencing the URI provides the SOAP instance.  </s>
<s> Of course, there's a gray zone there.  </s>
<s> Does a CGI HTTP URI denote the service provided by the CGI application or the application itself, or just one access portal to that application (or service).  </s>
<s> Still, its a web-resource, and so it is reasonable to denote it with an HTTP URI.  </s>
<s> When you think of HTTP as a way of talking to some (possibly authoritative) service about URI-named resources, this whole URI thing makes a bit more sense.  </s>
<s> If you think of it as a glorified form of file-sharing (like NFS, Samba etc) URIs for abstractions seem odd.  </s>
<s> Exactly. HTTP URIs for abstractions seem odd.  </s>
<s> HTTP defines, like you say, a global filesystem of sorts.  </s>
<s> HTTP URIs denote real and accessible resources stored in that global filesystem.  </s>
<s> To use an HTTP URI to denote an abstract concept, such as "LOVE" or an ontological term, or a non-web resource such  </s>
<s> such as "The city of Paris" is quite odd.  </s>
<s> I fully agree.  </s>

<s> SOAP Web Service endpoints can be named with http:* URIs, and communicated with via XML representations shipped over HTTP.  </s>
<s> But you can't download the service itself; that wouldn't make sense.  </s>
<s> I'm not following.  </s>
<s> SOAP probably isn't the best example, as it has some odd properties, but its use of URIs to identify endpoints clearly identifies services; service descriptions (e.g., IDLs like WSDL) have separate identifiers.  </s>
<s> Both SOAP endpoints and URIs that point at service descriptions will, when dereferenced, return a representation of the resource in a format that the client is presumed to be able to understand.  </s>
<s> Option two.  </s>
<s> The "CGI application" (which I'm interpreting as "a bundle of code") might encompass one resource or many resources; interactions with those resources might affect application state, having follow-on effects to other resources exposed to the application.  </s>
<s> you may find to be of interest.  </s>
<s> But what is 'non-web'?  </s>
<s> The best definition of the Web is 'an information space', which begs the question; how can you exclude a concept from a global information space?  </s>
<s> HTTP does not define the shape of the Web, or vice versa.  </s>
<s> Whenever you use an HTTP URI in a Web browser, you use it for two things; identifying the resource uniquely in a global namespace, and dereferencing it to get a representation.  </s>
<s> Why is it so odd that some people only want to use it as an identifier, without going off and dereferencing it?  </s>
<s> If it weren't allowed to use a HTTP URI without dereferencing it, how would you talk about the services available at those URIs without dereferencing them?  </s>
<s> The HTTP itself uses URIs in this fashion (e.g. as index keys in caches).  </s>
