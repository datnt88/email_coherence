(by way of "Martin J. Duerst" duerst@w3.org ) Subject: Namespaces in XML Dear Gentlemen: Our publishing company is actually preparing the publication of a book calles "Java XML Programming". 
Amongst other it shall contain the W3C document Rec-xml-names-19990114 specifying the use of namespaces in XML (editors: . 
As the book will be published in German and as this specification only exists in English, we would like to translate the spec document into German regarding the W3C's requirements for such translations. 
Obviously, we would provide the translation to the W3C. 
My questions: -- Is there a formal OK necessary from the W3C to start the translation? 
If so, I would highly appreciate a immediate answer, as we have to finish the translation next week. 
-- Are there any formal rules we have to observe translating this spec doc? 
(Can we use the German translation of W3C XML specification by Behme/Mintert as model?) Thanks in advance for your help. 
Looking forward to hear / read soon from you.

Regine, Fernando, please let me know about your plans. 
We've started to include MITP's finished translation of Namespaces (I was informed about the effort by Fernando) in our German translation project (http://mintert.com/w3c/trans/de/). 
Bye, Stefan.
