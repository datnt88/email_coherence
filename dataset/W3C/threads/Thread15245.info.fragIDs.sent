<s> Hi, here are my suggestion:  </s>
<s> Intended users: As said by John, is important to add in the "intended users" the "Trainer developers".  </s>
<s> Testability: There are a contrast in these two paragraphs: "Techniques related to Success Criteria must be testable.  </s>
<s> Guidance about testing methods may be provided.  </s>
<s> "  </s>
<s> and this:  </s>
<s> "Example implementations should be provided for untestable Techniques where possible."  </s>
<s> I think that we could correct all these with one sentence: "Guidance about testing methods for Techniques related to Success Criteria or example implementations for untestable Techniques related to Success Criteria must be provided."  </s>

<s> assuming that I have got the gist- I think the testability thing is overdone, and I am not sure why we need techniques to be testable.  </s>
<s> The success criteria are testable.  </s>
<s> Making the techniques testable may be overkill , (with negative and positive criteria, and test cases.....) - might reduce usability.  </s>
<s> Overdoing descriptions, commentary, implementation notes, links to resources or training materials, may also reduce usability.  </s>
<s> The thing should read well, give you a sense of context, similar to the old techniques.  </s>
<s> But too many links to resource  </s>
<s> will be confusing.  </s>
<s> In general I find this document hard to understand.  </s>
<s> for example: Where technologies work together (e.g., HTML and CSS), relevant joint techniques must be presented with the host technology (e.g., HTML).  </s>
<s> If techniques do not involve interactions between the two technologies, they must be presented with the techniques for their respective technology only.  </s>
<s> Techniques must state to which versions of the technology they apply, that is, describe a practice to avoid or that will have a positive accessibility impact.  </s>
<s> They may specify all versions, all versions prior to or later than a particular version, or enumerate particular versions.  </s>
<s> is obtuse, but the point is actually simple (unless I have missed the point).  </s>
<s> I think it means, for each technique state what technologies (and dependent technologies and versions of technologies) apply.  </s>
<s> CSS also has application to XML. all the best,  </s>

<s> There is a strong requirement  </s>
<s> for testability of techniques from authoring tool, evaluation and  </s>
<s> repair tool and user agent developers, who are primary audiences of the techniques.  </s>
<s> Also, by having multiple presentations of the material we can create views of the techniques in which only some of the information (namely, that relevant to a particular audience or for a specific purpose) is included.  </s>
<s> Does this adequately address the concern?  </s>
<s> If not, what alternatives are there?  </s>
<s> Agreed.  </s>
<s> A concise exposition is always to be preferred.  </s>
<s> I suspect you missed the main point, which is that where one technology operates within a host language, the techniques for the dependent technology, CSS for example, should be included with the techniques for the host language rather than as a separate document.  </s>
<s> The second point in the above passage is as you stated it, however.  </s>
<s> While it is true that CSS works with XML, HTML was here mentioned only as an example rather than in an effort to be exhaustive.  </s>
<s> I agree.  </s>
<s> It is supposed to address the needs of audiences that aren't well met by more technical documents such as WCAG techniques, as well as to provide a more integrated, tutorial-style explanation of accessible content design.  </s>
<s> As I understand it, the WCAG group will  </s>

<s> EO to ensure that the resulting documents are technically sound and in accord with the guidelines.  </s>

<s> b, techniques that are not testable be included anyway.  </s>
<s> It seems a bit daft to exclude useful techniques because they do not fit with the needs of authoring tools and evaluation and repair tools etc.  </s>

<s> I think that is what was intended.  </s>
<s> The requirements document sets out what is to be included; a separate section will be provided to identify the requirements of each of the intended views.  </s>
<s> My original suggestion on this point was that the testability status of every technique be explicitly identified in the XML source from which the checklists and other documents are generated, indicating whether the technique is machine testable, human testable or not testable at all.  </s>
<s> There has been no intention to exclude non-testable techniques as such.  </s>
<s> Also, by providing such markup it becomes possible to filter the techniques on the basis of testability, which may be desirable for certain purposes.  </s>
<s> It should also be noted that many content authors want testable techniques to be provided wherever possible, without which they can't reliably determine whether their content meets the pertinent requirement.  </s>
<s> Thus, offering testable techniques where possible and clear guidance where not, is the underlying strategy to be followed, in the techniques as well as in the guidelines proper.  </s>
