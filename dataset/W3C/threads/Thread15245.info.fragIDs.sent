I apologize that I did not complete this before the holidays, but you know, things get busy. 
This version incorporates comments received to date (unless I've lost track 
of any) and adds a little more structure. 
The plan is that this version should be close to ready to post as a public draft. 
We have tentatively scheduled a teleconference for Wednesday, January 8 at 10:30am U.S. Eastern Time (I think this is 15:30 UTC). 
This call would be for people who want to discuss the Techniques in detail. 
On the January 9 
WCAG call we will hopefully be ready to request the group's approval to post 
this to TR - keeping in mind that it is still a draft.

I propose that we add the following group of prospective users for the Techniques documents: 
Trainers/developers of training. 
Rationale: People who develop accessibility training materials and programs need access to clear, detailed documentation of techniques for meeting WCAG 2 checkpoints and success criteria. 
Some of these people may be members of EO, who need the best materials we can supply. 
WCAG is no longer the only game in town, especially in the US. Helping trainers see how WCAG 2 techniques documents can help them provide excellent training is also a way to get the trainers on our side, i.e., turn them into advocates for WCAG 2.0.

Yes... i think it is right! 
This night i will read all the tecniques and i will mail tomorrow my suggestion ;)

Hi, here are my suggestion: 
Intended users: As said by John, is important to add in the "intended users" the "Trainer developers". 
Testability: There are a contrast in these two paragraphs: "Techniques related to Success Criteria must be testable. 
Guidance about testing methods may be provided. 
" 
and this: 
"Example implementations should be provided for untestable Techniques where possible." 
I think that we could correct all these with one sentence: "Guidance about testing methods for Techniques related to Success Criteria or example implementations for untestable Techniques related to Success Criteria must be provided." 
these are my two cents :) Roberto Scano IWA/HWG EMEA Coordinator W3C Advisory Committee Representative for IWA/HWG International Webmasters Association / HTML Writers Guild E-Mail: emea@iwanet.org - w3c-rep@iwanet.org 
assuming that I have got the gist- I think the testability thing is overdone, and I am not sure why we need techniques to be testable. 
The success criteria are testable. 
Making the techniques testable may be overkill , (with negative and positive criteria, and test cases.....) - might reduce usability. 
Overdoing descriptions, commentary, implementation notes, links to resources or training materials, may also reduce usability. 
The thing should read well, give you a sense of context, similar to the old techniques. 
But too many links to resource 
will be confusing. 
In general I find this document hard to understand. 
for example: Where technologies work together (e.g., HTML and CSS), relevant joint techniques must be presented with the host technology (e.g., HTML). 
If techniques do not involve interactions between the two technologies, they must be presented with the techniques for their respective technology only. 
Techniques must state to which versions of the technology they apply, that is, describe a practice to avoid or that will have a positive accessibility impact. 
They may specify all versions, all versions prior to or later than a particular version, or enumerate particular versions. 
is obtuse, but the point is actually simple (unless I have missed the point). 
I think it means, for each technique state what technologies (and dependent technologies and versions of technologies) apply. 
CSS also has application to XML. all the best,

I think training stuff is more for the education and outreach working group.

Our trick is to give access to the technique whilst doing a fantastic job of making it invisible. 
if you do a thing well, people don't notice the technique, in many cases describing is redundant, and in the case of humour or magic, well as the saying goes..... 
so rather far from where we are now.... I've found that the reductionist approach taken in the past has left many things near impossible to achieve, so the earlier we demonstrate accessible examples of what we wish to promote, as well as 'fictional' guidelines the better.-)

It depends on the audience, I suspect. 
There is a strong requirement 
for testability of techniques from authoring tool, evaluation and 
repair tool and user agent developers, who are primary audiences of the techniques. 
Also, by having multiple presentations of the material we can create views of the techniques in which only some of the information (namely, that relevant to a particular audience or for a specific purpose) is included. 
Does this adequately address the concern? 
If not, what alternatives are there? 
Agreed. 
A concise exposition is always to be preferred. 
I suspect you missed the main point, which is that where one technology operates within a host language, the techniques for the dependent technology, CSS for example, should be included with the techniques for the host language rather than as a separate document. 
The second point in the above passage is as you stated it, however. 
While it is true that CSS works with XML, HTML was here mentioned only as an example rather than in an effort to be exhaustive. 
I agree. 
It is supposed to address the needs of audiences that aren't well met by more technical documents such as WCAG techniques, as well as to provide a more integrated, tutorial-style explanation of accessible content design. 
As I understand it, the WCAG group will 
have the opportunity to comment on this work and to collaborate with 
EO to ensure that the resulting documents are technically sound and in accord with the guidelines. 
overnight I wondered if OS developers should be included as an 'audience', there are so many issues around configuring computers that might benefit from being more closely related to browser usage. 
for instance many teachers in a recent 'configuring to meet the needs of SLD users' training were unaware of much that is currently possible. 
eg changing the tooltip font size, but shouldn't this be related to the header size in any case? 
obviously this is a large topic, sorry if it seems to also be off topic... jonathan chetwynd 
Thanks for explaing it to me Jason. 
There is a need for testable techniques, but may I recommend that: a, test cases etc be available only in a specific rendering of the techniques (so we do not confuse everybody) - as you suggested and 
b, techniques that are not testable be included anyway. 
It seems a bit daft to exclude useful techniques because they do not fit with the needs of authoring tools and evaluation and repair tools etc. 
For example, clear writing techniques are, oh so hard, for evaluation tools to pick up on. 
should we excluded them? 
Surely these tools are there to enhance accessibility and not limit it.

point). 
dependent technologies and versions of technologies) apply. 
I think that is what was intended. 
The requirements document sets out what is to be included; a separate section will be provided to identify the requirements of each of the intended views. 
My original suggestion on this point was that the testability status of every technique be explicitly identified in the XML source from which the checklists and other documents are generated, indicating whether the technique is machine testable, human testable or not testable at all. 
There has been no intention to exclude non-testable techniques as such. 
Also, by providing such markup it becomes possible to filter the techniques on the basis of testability, which may be desirable for certain purposes. 
It should also be noted that many content authors want testable techniques to be provided wherever possible, without which they can't reliably determine whether their content meets the pertinent requirement. 
Thus, offering testable techniques where possible and clear guidance where not, is the underlying strategy to be followed, in the techniques as well as in the guidelines proper.
