<s> Attached are two files, one in a table for those that are visual folks and one as a nested list.  </s>
<s> This is only one possible direction, but is shows that the site can balance the initiatives and the results of the initiatives.  </s>
<s> There would be cross linking via a "related items" component on each of the pages.  </s>

<s> Michael , The nested layout works for me...  </s>
<s> I can make out the structure and navigate to section of interest.  </s>
<s> Only thing missing was it does not say it is a site map anywhere.  </s>
<s> Perhaps the page title could be WAI Site Map.  </s>
<s> (I understand it is a draft) Another alternative for nesting lists: to use h3 (and if needed , h4) levels to nest links under main groups marked with h2.  </s>
<s> That will obviate the need to have lists with single li items (as is the case now, although they are child lists).  </s>
<s> When headings are nested, their structure is clearer and are easier to navigate using an audio user interface as used by screen reader users.  </s>
<s> The lower level headings too can be indented and the heading size can be a visual cue for sighted users.  </s>
<s> Another thought: If these six h2 level items are also presented as links in one place near the top or in a left side navigation bar, they will also allow one to navigate to the relevant section by activating the link.  </s>
<s> So it is another method of navigation available to one besides navigation by headings. the table representation does not convey structure to JAWS users like me.  </s>
