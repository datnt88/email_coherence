If Amaya is to move towards a browser rather than an editor, it needs to be much more tolerant of real world HTML than is possible with a strict DTD based parser. 
E.g. this afternoon, at least, the main page for TABLE FORM INPUT TBODY Amaya deleted FORM and INPUT, in its error recovery (validator.w3.org seems to close the table instead). 
The result was that it was impossible to make a search! 
(Lynx has had to go as far as both a DTD based parser and a process tag semantics in isolation parser, in order to both be correct and useable.)

Amaya is not moving towards a browser. 
We added the possibility to prevent documents to be edited by error. 
Some times documents are downloaded only to copy information or to make or test a link. 
If Amaya was not tolerant it had rejected the document. 
But what you're asking is that all browsers manage errors in the same way. 
What I would prefer is that users ask altavista page providers to build valid HTML pages and avoid these errors. 
The HTML structure is not so complex. 
It takes two minutes to put the FOPRM /FORM around the Table, but days of work to understand at parsing time what the author wanted to do. 
Irene. 
All true, What i'd expect from Amaya (since it is an authoring editor) is that it should accept about everything which looks like html (4) BUT it should clearly state errors to this language. 
I think Amaya acted as it should do: it was given faulty HTML and it was making the best out of it. 
Only good HTML has expected behavoure, if parts are faulty, rejecting the faulty bits is one of the things Amaya can do. 
You are right that closing the 'accidently' not closed table is a better option, the user can remove the (now empty) table by hand. 
Future implementations of Amaya can ask the user what to do on these bugs if it is in editing mode but in browsing mode I'd like an automated action.

- C. S. Lewis Corne' Beerse| Alcatel Telecom Nederland This point was not really aimed at you, but at the increasing number of the people on the list who see Amaya as a potential free and open source competitor to the big two commercial browsers. 
Personally, I only use Amaya as an extra verification on HTML I write, and it was just because I was in Amaya at the time that I decided to try the Altavista access. 
I did this before posting to the Amaya list, but Lynx users have been doing this for years and the commercial reality is that many page authors only care that their pages look impressive on one or both of IE4 and NS4, and most only care about compatibility with NS and IE products. 
Amaya and Lynx users are at best a nuisance. 
There are reports of quite hostile responses to reports to webmasters from Lynx users. 
Unfortunately most authors these days cut and paste from other broken HTML and don't know how to read a DTD. 
They then test against IE and NS and that is commercially good enough for their purposes. 
So basically I agree with you about what should happen in an ideal world, but I don't think it will. 
Incidentally, I suspect your terms of reference don't really permit you to go into direct competition with the commercial browsers. 
I've championed the do it right position on the Lynx mailing list, but the majority view tends to be towards making Lynx work in the real world by trying to track de facto error recovery.

I guess it's important to react today and don't let MS or NS kill the Web. 
With HTML, people applauded to have a universal and open format to exchange information. 
Maintaining and encouraging invalid HTML is a manner to come back to proprietary solutions. 
In theory all W3C members, including MS and NS, agree to increase the quality of Web pages. 
In fact the future should be a XML version of HTML (Voyager) which will reject invalid documents. 
Users are actors on the Web as well as tool providers. 
Interests of both parties are not necessary the same. 
If users think that open formats are good for them, they have to defend their position. 
That's true. 
Nevertheless I hope we can show that a free and open solution is viable and very helpful. 
There are countries and domains (education for example) were people cannot or mustn't pay for commercial products. 
Sometimes, it's necessary to maintain a minimum of contact with the reality :-( Regards Irene. 
I think it will be very difficult to get rid of support for current generation bad HTML (and deprecated features, like font color) in commercial browsers, because users will see this as a failure of the browser to render the HTML, rather than the fact that the HTML was broken (or obsolete) in the first place. 
Commercial browser writers can't afford to take the high position because failure to render a page will be seen as their fault, and, even if it doesn't cause people to dissuade others from using that browser, it will still cause an increase in their support costs. 
(I think a lot of the reason that current browsers accept broken HTML are to do with avoiding support calls - something similar is IE's tendency to ignore media type information and assume that something beginning html is text/html, even if correctly described as text/plain.)
