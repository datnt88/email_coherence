TO:w3c-wai-ig@w3.org Thanks... so does this mean... 1. 
That if doctype isn't in the first line then?there's 
no point it being there at all? 
2. Can the lang=en be specified in the BODY tag instead of the HTML tag? 
Thanks, Gian More or less. 
The rules that apply are those for SGML or XML depending on whether you use HTML or XHTML (note that XML is a lot simpler than SGML). 
See the HTML specification: http://www.w3.org/TR/html for the latest (currently XHTML 1 published January 200 and revised August 2002) or december 1999, a revision of HTML 4, originally published december 1997 and revised april 1998). 
GSW Yes. 
Then it is only your title any metadata that is in an unknown language. 
Chaals Might I add that if you *must* adhere to W3C Priority 2 Guidelines (ie: interpret as Standards, as is the situation here in Canada), then the DTD *MUST* be present, per the HTML Specifications (http://www.w3.org/TR/html). 
The DTD has been made mandatory in the spec since HTML 3.2 was finalized in 1997; Html 4.01 has been "stable" since 1999. 
WCAG Priority 2, 3.2 states: "Create documents that validate to published formal grammars." 
Thus, to satisfy this requirement, your document must contain the DTD - as that is part of the published formal grammar. 
(I didn't write it, I just read it.) Most user agents today will interpret HTML with or without the DTD, so from a practical "will it still work without" perspective, it's generally not an issue. 
When people ask me why they should be concerned with the inclusion of the DTD, I usually use the following analogies: "(in Canada) Driving your car without wearing your seatbelt does not affect the performance of the vehicle. 
It still drives to and fro and gets you where you need to be. 
Most times, wearing the seatbelt does nothing for you. 
However, should you ever *require* the use of the seatbelt and you are not wearing it, then what? 
If you are stopped by the police, you will get a ticket for not wearing it. 
You have a choice, but with that choice comes consequences." 
The DTD defines the mark-up tags being used in your document; what they signify, how they can be used, how they should be interpreted by the user agent, etc. 
I also use the following: "If I told you I left my lunch in my boot, you'd think I was nuts... but if we were sitting in downtown London, England you'd know that I had left my lunch in the trunk of my car... because the Boot in England is the Trunk in North America" Subtle differences in language can be confusing at the least, critically important at the worst. 
With the rapid emergence of *ML Languages it is not beyond the realm of reasonability that defining the DTD may in fact be crucial some day (very) soon. 
So leaving it out (IMHO) courts disaster... it's like driving without the seatbelt. 
JF Today however some user agents (IE5+, Netscape6+) will interpret the HTML and CSS in different ways if the DTD is present versus absent. 
Typically without a DTD the UA will try to emulate past old, buggy behavior in previous versions of itself, where with a current, correct DTD it will follow the standards more correctly. 
So to get consistent results that you can count on, including a DTD can be very important. 
Bill Mason Accessible Internet w3c@accessibleinter.net Pedantic point: you mean the FPI. 
That's logically correct. 
Though it's also worth pointing out that at the time the WCAG was written, all the online validators would permit omission of the FPI, and would validate to a default doctype in the absence of an explicit one. 
The underlying point is of course that the markup should be correct. 
That too is problematic. 
Valet is stricter about validation than other accessibility tools, and delivers a straight fail on invalid markup when evaluating at AA or AAA. 
This leads to many users finding it too strict, and preferring something to reassure them:-( I would apply a simpler test: they must validate, and they can't validate without it (actually in SGML terms they can, but HTML imposes additional restrictions). 
OTOH I wouldn't quarrel with your answers. 
Are you familiar with my page at Nick Kew Yes. 
The other point to note is that the guidelines aren't really so concerned about the DOCTYPE, they are concerned that the document comply with the DOCTYPE. 
Having out of place tags fails on that point. 
Yes, although you should include it on HEAD as well. 
Neither place will probably be spotted by a search engine. 
However, my impression was that you couldn't control the HEAD and BODY tags (at most one of each is allowed - the HEAD and BODY elements are always present, but the tags need not be).
