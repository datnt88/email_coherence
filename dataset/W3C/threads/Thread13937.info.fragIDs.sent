Hello, 
We have tried to synthesize all of the comments and discussion about how to 
author alt-text for use in the Page Authoring guidelines. 
Please read 
We look forward to your comments and discussion. the editors 
LQ:: 
For "Images and Image maps" (section 2.1--the first one), the first paragraph is great, but the examples in that section don't agree with the advice. 
ALT="XYZ Logo" does not represent the function of the image; it represents a description of the image. 
ALT text representative of the function of the image might be "XYZ" or "Welcome to XYZ", depending on the context. 
Section 2.1.1 recommends using ALT for APPLET and INPUT. 
I don't think ALT should be used with APPLET since alternate content can be given more effectively as the content of the APPLET element, allowing full markup whereas ALT text is limited to plain text. 
With INPUT, it should be 
clarified that the ALT attribute is only necessary for INPUT TYPE=image . 
Section 2.2 (which should actually be 2.3) reads as follows: 
To avoid confusion, if an alternative list of links follows the image 
map, authors should indicate with | the "alt" attribute of the MAP element that there is an alternate list and its location. 
LQ:: There is no ALT attribute on the MAP element. 
Substituting "IMG" for "MAP", the advice seems to suggest ALT text of the form "See text links below". 
Is this really helpful to those not loading images? 
If there are 
text links later in the document, the user will get to them. 
Saying "See text links below" seems like another reminder that the Web is made for people who can see graphics. 
(Of course "below" is also a poor word choice on my part since "below" makes no sense aurally; describing the location in a device-independent way is too difficult to bother with, in my opinion.) If text links are provided in addition to an IMG-based image map, I'd suggest using ALT="" to remove the redundant object for those not loading images. 
(And now people will say that they want to know that an image is there, and I will say that they're thinking of the Web as a visual medium and hurting accessibility... g ) Section 2.3.2 (on MAPs including A elements) suggests the use of the TITLE attribute of A. The example basically just repeats the content of the A element in the TITLE attribute, which seems rather pointless. 
If the content of the A element were an abbreviated version and the TITLE attribute gave a full title for the linked resource, use of TITLE would make sense, but I don't think that TITLE should be used when it just repeats information that is more easily available elsewhere. 
We have to avoid unnecessary redundancies so that user agents don't start assuming that the TITLE attribute is not worth presenting. 
Section 2.4 suggests the use of the TITLE attribute on all A elements that contain an IMG. 
Good, functional ALT text should accomplish the same task, as in this modified example from 2.4: A href="home.html" IMG src="logo.gif" 
alt="XYZ company home page" title="XYZ Logo" /A Note that this provides the necessary information to the many user agents that lack support for the TITLE attribute. 
Even if TITLE were universally supported, I think the preceding use of ALT and TITLE is more sensible. 
An alternative would be as follows: A href="home.html" title="XYZ company home page" IMG src="logo.gif" 
alt="XYZ" title="XYZ Logo" /A Here I've added the TITLE attribute to A since I've used an abbreviated ALT text. 
In the "Guidelines for writing alt-text", it's suggested that ALT text should end with "proper punctuation, such as a colon or period". 
I'm not sure if it's the intention or not, but this seems to suggest that all ALT attribute values should end with some form of punctuation. 
First off, ALT text may be part of a sentence, in which case punctuation would most often be inappropriate. 
Secondly, I commonly use H1 IMG src="logo.gif" 
alt="XYZ Company" /H1 , without trailing punctuation since I want it to be presented as H1 XYZ Company /H1 to those not loading images. 
If punctuation should be used in my ALT text here, then it should also be recommended for the end of each heading, which doesn't seem right. 
For the TITLE attribute, I think the best and most natural way to use it is to provide a title for the IMG, A, or whatever element. 
Each image could 
have a title if it were on its own ("XYZ Logo", "My Wedding Photo", and so on). 
A elements that link to HTML documents would typically use the linked document's TITLE element as the value of the A element's TITLE attribute, though if the A element's content provides an adequate title this would just be redundant. 
For decorative graphics, I think we need to distinguish between important decorative graphics (such as some photographs) and fluff. 
Many decorative images, such as a small mailbox icon next to someone's e-mail address, would be best marked up with ALT="" since they are of no use to those not loading images. 
Decorative photographs (which in many respects are content) could use descriptive ALT text, though I'd suggest surrounding the ALT text with delimiters such as "[" and "]" to ensure that the ALT text is not misunderstood in a given context. 
An example of such a problem is the "Photo of a bull in the water canoeing" howler from Alan Flavell's article on ALT text [1]. 
For graphical bullets, I don't see any harm in using style sheets to provide a graphical bullet where the graphical bullet provides no meaning (as is the case with Example 2). 
In this case, the non-graphical browser would simply render the list item marker as it normally would, which should not be a problem. 
The danger is if the graphical bullet is depended upon to provide a meaning; suitable use of the CLASS attribute could indicate the meaning and style sheets (aural, visual, etc.) could help express it, though the author should not depend on any presentation getting the meaning across.

My comments: "Provide alternative text for all images and image maps" *The "good test to determine if alt-text is useful is to imagine reading the document aloud over the telephone" is excellent. 
*Do not require ALT attribute on APPLET. 
Use markup within element. 
"Provide a longer description for graphics that present important information" *I really think an example would be useful here. 
Show a pie chart, or a stock graph and then show, ALT, TITLE and the LONGDESC page "Provide a description for each link in an image map" *#2 showing the usage of the TITLE attribute is very good. 
"Provide descriptive titles for all images used as links" *Using the TITLE attribute on the A is good, but needs more explanation as to why the TITLE is with the A and not the IMG "General Recommendation" *With LONGDESC, people can use markup effectively. 
For example, a Pie chart can be rendered textually with a table showing each wedge with a name and value. 
"Invisible images used as spacers" *Null ALT text is generally ALT="", where empty ALT text is ALT=" ". 
Maybe it's the programmer in me. 
"Future Notes" *There has to be a wide range of examples with the actual image and calling out the rules used. 
*Include a recommendation that CSS allow the rendering of ALT and TITLE text. 
For example the options can be: *Show all ALT text (expand the box) when image not shown *Do not show ALT text when image not shown *Show TITLE instead of ALT when image not shown *Draw ALT text as link when IMG is within a A when image not shown *Render AREA ALT text as a list of links within a MAP when image not shown *Do not display ToolTip *Other options? 
This gives http://www.sony.com 
http://www.sony.com the ability to not have ALT text clutter the screen while allowing the user a measure of control via a user-side style sheet.

DD:: I need to read it again in the plane to WWW7 but a quick comment is that I think we should specify a way to do class=deco today, so that it's up to the reader/browser to decide. 
Without running much risk, we can give some hints of what is decoration vs what is not. 
DD:: I think "XYZ Logo" is the function of the graphic: it's the logo 
of the XYZ company, that's its job. 
The description could be something like "A multicolored apple", or "A circle of 12 stars", which probably belongs into the long description file if it's more than 5 words (like "part of piano keyboard surrounded by a couple of notes and a G clef") More later. 
I support Liam on this issue. 
I recalled that the APPLET content was meant to be displayed on client agents that didn't support the APPLET, whereas ALT text was meant to be used, in supporting client agents, while the APPLET was being loaded. 
However, I see no evidence of this distinction in the HTML4.0 spec, and it says that the content is to be used both on non-supporting client agents and on client agents that are capable of supporting it but the option is currently disabled (these are two rather different situations in my opinion, and arguably might call for different handling). 
And the concrete examples in the 4.0 spec are pretty dumb as far as the wording of the APPLET content is concerned. 
What the heck is the point of the words "Java applet that plays a welcoming sound" on a client agent that doesn't support Java applets? 
It might better say something like "Hello, good evening and welcome", substituting the _function_ of the APPLET, in preference to describing that function. 
I.e the principle is again the same as Liam was stating for IMG ALT. 
(re. the section that should be numbered 2.3): 
("Later" or "next" or "shortly" might be less presentation-specific terms than "below"). 
Yes, I feel that this paragraph needs reworking in a number of respects. 
I'm not quite sure what the document has in mind when it posits a situation "When a server-side image map must be used", but let's assume for the moment that such situations exist. 
If a simple list of text links can do an adequate job, then one might wonder why the imagemap is there anyway; if a simple list of text links _can't_ do an adequate job (example, a public transit map) then I'd propose offering a genuine alternative means of navigation, such as an A-Z index or a search engine - something that can be a useful feature for all readers, irrespective of whether they're able to use the imagemap. 
And then there is no longer any need for, nor point in, providing a simple (but long and unmanageable) list of text links. 
To sum up, I'd want the recommendations to say e.g "where a server side imagemap must be used, then authors should provide some viable alternative means of accessible navigation. 
That might be a simple list of text mode links - on the page or on an alternative page - or might be an additional A-Z index, search engine, or whatever is appropriate for the situation." 
This last sentence in the paragraph: 
seems to me to be quite confusing and unclear. 
Either it should be reworded, or a good concrete example provided of what is meant by it. 
(I agree with Liam's further comments at this point, but for brevity I'll omit them). 
At this time, where support for TITLE (whether on IMG or on enclosing A anchor links) is still only partial, I think we need to keep keenly in mind both the ideal principles for usage of ALT and TITLE, as well as the actual results that are likely across reasonably-current browsers. 
This inevitably involves some temporary compromises. 
The ideal is that TITLE for IMG is a property of the image itself; if the image is acting as a link, then the place for the TITLE of the link is not the IMG - it is the enclosing A anchor link. 
In practice, for now, we have to compromise on this, bearing in mind the mutually incompatible behaviour of browsers such as MSIE and Opera. 
In the "Invisible images" section, I think you need to distinguish between null alt-text (i.e ALT="") on the one hand, and white space (ALT=" ", or possibily in some situations even something like ALT="&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;") on the other hand. 
In this context, your example is of white space, which seems the right choice - your description should reflect that. 
(I think the term "empty text" would be ambiguous and best avoided). 
Please take this as constructive criticism - clearly a lot of hard work has been put into producing this document, and I don't for a moment intend to decry that. 
All the best. 
There's no general answer to that kind of question - one needs to consider the logo in context, and to know why it's there, IMHO. 
Actually, only the author can know that, but as outside observers we can draw conclusions. 
You may feel that there is a fine distinction between "being a logo" and "identifying a company". 
My feeling is that most logos are put onto web pages in order to perform the latter function, but you say you feel otherwise, if I understand you right. 
If you're a manufacturer of logos then logos are your content, and "XYZ Logo" is an exhibit of your work. 
No problem with that. 
If the logo is doing the job of identifying your XYZ company, then ALT texts such as ALT="XYZ Company", ALT="Welcome to XYZ Company", and ALT="" (and many other variations) could, it seems to me, all be appropriate in different situations, depending on what other identification is present on the page - in other words, depending on what is the function of the logo, why the author put it there. 
But unless the content of the logo itself is germane to its presence on the web page (which is, IMHO, a rarity), then I'd say that ALT="XYZ Logo" is inappropriate. 
I definitely don't want to see it included in guidelines as a concrete example, because I feel that it's wrong far more often than it's right. 
Remember, you still have the TITLE attribute at your disposal for describing what it is - as distinct to stating the function which it performs. 
Elsewhere we are urged to think what we would do if reading this page out on the telephone. 
This seems to me to be excellent advice. 
Would I read out: "XYZ Company Logo. 
XYZ Company" in response to H1 IMG ... XYZ Company /H1 ? 
I would not. 
Would you? 
best regards 
I would. 
I would say: there is the company logo on the left corner (do you want me to describe it?), then it says "Welcome to XYZ", etc. 
So that later, on, if I refer to "the page with the company logo on it", then it would make sense. 
It's just information, and I don't see why I would not give it away. 
Except that this XYZ's company policy requires the company logo to be on all of their pages, so that detail doesn't help. 
Are you going to bother the listener with this detail on every single one of their pages? 
They also demand the pages to be a specific shade of blue, so that is also an important piece of information (or at least, the XYZ company design office considers it to be an important piece of information). 
And the design office insists that the font has to be New Baskerville, so that's another important detail that you need to convey to the listener, it seems. 
Where shall it end? 
As I said, this depends on the specific situation, I don't believe one can make an absolute rule that takes no account of the context. 
Apart from that, I gather that you put the borderline between content and decoration in a different place than I do - I don't claim to be the final arbiter of that, I was only expressing a personal view, and I'm content to leave the discussion at that. 
My answer to that would be that concentrating on extraneous visual detail can be distracting the listener from the real content of the page. 
But again, it's all a question of context, and the author's intentions for the various components of their page. 
Can I briefly suggest that half the problems related to the ALT-text discussions are simply based on user knowledge we don't know or are unsure of? 
Discussions like this tend to be very subjective in nature....and while I appreciate that it's critical for the WG to "get it right", I don't think it's possible until you implement user interface testing into the WAI process to help you truly determine what a blind or text-client user will need/want. 
Please note that I've used "client" since it's clear that we're dealing with multiple client interfaces -- not just PC-type or voice-based browsers. 
Regards, Mike 
Underlying the endless debate on ALT text and many other issues is the question of whether we want to describe a Web page visually or to convey its information seamlessly. 
My view is that a well-authored Web page is device-independent, neither visual nor non-visual since its presentation is determined by the user agent based on suggestions from the author and user. 
The result of this view is that I want to convey a document's information seamlessly so that the graphical user, the Lynx user, and the pwWebSpeak user all think that the page was made for them, written specifically for their browsing environment. 
This is true accessibility. 
If you were writing a Web page specifically for aural rendering, you wouldn't include an image. 
On a truly accessible Web, the aural user should feel that each page is tailored for her browsing environment. 
When we try to tell the aural user that "There's an image here", we're saying that "This Web page is visual--it isn't made for you or your browsing environment." 
While this may be the case in some situations (e.g., photo albums), most Web pages convey information that need not be tied to a visual rendering. 
So let's decide: Do we want to treat the Web as a visual medium and tell non-visual users how pages look? 
Or do we want to treat the Web as a device-independent medium and communicate its information seamlessly to anyone?
