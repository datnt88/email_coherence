<s> I am not sure whether this fits in overall (I think so) or in specific checkpoints.  </s>
<s> If people think this proposal is worth following up I can fill out the examples stuff a bit better with more complete ones, and information about who it is supposed to help and so on.  </s>
<s> anyway, here is the proposal: proposed checkpoint  </s>
<s> For any description of a process or a of relationships, provide a graphic equivalent.  </s>
<s> Techniques stuff... 1. Use case: A description of how to decide whether someting is conformant to WCAG Method: Draw a flowchart 2. Use Case: Describing a network Method: represent the original in RDF and use an RDF to image service to generate an image Example: A textual explanation (of sorts): http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG-access/#Structured  </s>
<s> The RDF is incorporated in the SVG version of the image: There is a gif/png version too: The resulting diagram (generated from the RDF - doesn't matter if the existing image is there or not): 3. Use Case: A recipe for cooking a pavlova Method: provide step by step drawings of a process 4. Use case: A description of how to plait a stockwhip or belt Method: provide a movie demonstrating how to do the process 5. Use case: A description of how to make a medieval-style tent Method: Provide illustrations of the key steps  </s>

<s> Incidentally the instant proposed checkpoint should likely, at least IMO,  </s>
<s> provide a graphic equivalent?  </s>
<s> We should examine everything in the document  </s>
<s> to ascertain which ones fit this proposed checkpoint.  </s>
<s> Then we can be more into "doing" in a more elaborate sense than *just* "talking"?  </s>
<s> One implication of the long thread is that the checkpoints are mostly acceptable?  </s>
<s> Love.  </s>
<s> ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE  </s>
<s> Yes, I would ike to have more illustrations for the checkpoint and teh  </s>

<s> But I had a time shortage, and I figured getting something out and modifying later is better than waiting forever in case I get to do it perfectly.  </s>

<s> Charles, William is right, this is an excellent concrete proposal, and good examples of how to illustrate ... I used to have an SVG viewer, but lost it in a drive crash a few months ago (haven't needed it since!) .. Can you please tell me again where to download it from?  </s>
<s> Very messy situation, not having the SVG viewer ... It spawns a new window, that stays blank, no clue what's going on, tho you can X back to the original page ... Anne  </s>

<s> "Steve has a site with embedded SVG examples that can be displayed in Mozilla (with SVG support).  </s>
<s> " but the link to http://jerbaker.dhs.org/mozilla/ was down when I tried it.  </s>
<s> tool I wonder what tool was used to draw the tiger?  </s>
<s> was a pressure sensitive tablet?  </s>
<s> My experience of vector based tools, is that it would not be easy to emulate.  </s>
<s> It would certainly be worth having links to good examples of how to achieve more complex effects, the hub is fine and well linked the tiger is not.  </s>
<s> gimp and sketch are a world apart.  </s>
<s> code your examples of svg code look great.  </s>
<s> Perhaps you could link to the tiger code so we could have another more complex great example The lion example: http://www.skeeter-s.com/svg/lion2.xml  </s>

<s> Working with LDD clients I find it essential to get feedback asap, otherwise one can be lead astray.  </s>
