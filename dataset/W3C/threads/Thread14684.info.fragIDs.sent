I am not sure whether this fits in overall (I think so) or in specific checkpoints. 
If people think this proposal is worth following up I can fill out the examples stuff a bit better with more complete ones, and information about who it is supposed to help and so on. 
anyway, here is the proposal: proposed checkpoint 
For any description of a process or a of relationships, provide a graphic equivalent. 
Techniques stuff... 1. Use case: A description of how to decide whether someting is conformant to WCAG Method: Draw a flowchart 2. Use Case: Describing a network Method: represent the original in RDF and use an RDF to image service to generate an image Example: A textual explanation (of sorts): http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG-access/#Structured 
The RDF is incorporated in the SVG version of the image: There is a gif/png version too: The resulting diagram (generated from the RDF - doesn't matter if the existing image is there or not): 3. Use Case: A recipe for cooking a pavlova Method: provide step by step drawings of a process 4. Use case: A description of how to plait a stockwhip or belt Method: provide a movie demonstrating how to do the process 5. Use case: A description of how to make a medieval-style tent Method: Provide illustrations of the key steps 
Now we're getting somewhere approaching "concrete". 
Incidentally the instant proposed checkpoint should likely, at least IMO, 
provide a graphic equivalent? 
We should examine everything in the document 
to ascertain which ones fit this proposed checkpoint. 
Then we can be more into "doing" in a more elaborate sense than *just* "talking"? 
One implication of the long thread is that the checkpoints are mostly acceptable? 
Love. 
ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE 
Yes, I would ike to have more illustrations for the checkpoint and teh 
examples. 
But I had a time shortage, and I figured getting something out and modifying later is better than waiting forever in case I get to do it perfectly. 
(But then, I would not claim that my email propsal was accessible, either...) Cheers Chaals

Perhaps we can start getting into that as a group? 
Keep them icons coming.

Charles, William is right, this is an excellent concrete proposal, and good examples of how to illustrate ... I used to have an SVG viewer, but lost it in a drive crash a few months ago (haven't needed it since!) .. Can you please tell me again where to download it from? 
Very messy situation, not having the SVG viewer ... It spawns a new window, that stays blank, no clue what's going on, tho you can X back to the original page ... Anne

3 queries on svg: viewer, authoring tool and code. 
with some great examples of illustration helping understanding. 
viewer how does one get mozilla with svg working? 
"Steve has a site with embedded SVG examples that can be displayed in Mozilla (with SVG support). 
" but the link to http://jerbaker.dhs.org/mozilla/ was down when I tried it. 
tool I wonder what tool was used to draw the tiger? 
was a pressure sensitive tablet? 
My experience of vector based tools, is that it would not be easy to emulate. 
It would certainly be worth having links to good examples of how to achieve more complex effects, the hub is fine and well linked the tiger is not. 
gimp and sketch are a world apart. 
code your examples of svg code look great. 
Perhaps you could link to the tiger code so we could have another more complex great example The lion example: http://www.skeeter-s.com/svg/lion2.xml 
has no comments, nor a wealth of useful functions . 
Working with LDD clients I find it essential to get feedback asap, otherwise one can be lead astray.
