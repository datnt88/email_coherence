hello, I am using amaya v 2.2. 
Each time I press return, I get two paragraph elements instead of one. 
Any idea what's going on and how I can stop this? 
In looking at the keyboard config file, i don't see anything out of the ordinary.

It could be a bug that occurs in a specific configuration. 
Could you send me the exact scenario when that occurs. 
What is selected (you can check at the window bottom) just before hitting the Return button? 
Irene. 
This bug is fixed in the current CVS release.

I've had a problem with select boxes (browsing other sites). 
The first one I use will work fine, but if I click off the box (without selecting an option from the menu), I can no longer access the options of that select box or even others (even on other pages and after reloading!) during that session. 
If I close Amaya and reopen, functionality returns.
