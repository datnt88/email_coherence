<s> For example, a publisher might maintain RDF metadata that includes the titles of books and articles.  </s>
<s> While such titles are often just simple strings of characters, this is not always  </s>
<s> the case.  </s>
<s> For instance, the titles of books on mathematics may contain mathematical formulas that could be represented using MathML [MATHML].  </s>
<s> Titles might also include markup for other reasons, such as for Ruby annotations [RUBY], or for bidirectional rendering or special glyph variants (see, e.g., [CHARMOD]).  </s>
<s> RDF/XML provides a special notation to make it easy to write literals of this kind.  </s>
<s> This is done using a third value of the rdf:parseType attribute.  </s>
<s> Giving an element the attribute rdf:parseType="Literal" indicates that the contents of the element are to be interpreted as an XML fragment.  </s>

<s> I agree; this is a useful clarification.  </s>
<s> On another issue, since we're clarifying things: in the text below, in discussing exclusive canonicalization, the text says: "This causes declarations of used namspaces to be added to the fragment..." I wonder if this wouldn't be clearer if it said: "This causes declarations of *namespaces used in the fragment* to be added to the fragment..." to distinguish namespaces used in the RDF/XML in general from those explicitly used in the fragment.  </s>
