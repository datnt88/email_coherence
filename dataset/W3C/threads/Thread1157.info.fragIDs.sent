<s> The IANA registration for the charset "macintosh", which represents the Mac OS Roman character set, currently refers to RFC 1345.  </s>
<s> Since RFC 1345 was published, the definition of the MacRoman character set has changed.  </s>
<s> In particular, the code point 0xDB, which was formerly U+00A4 CURRENCY SIGN, was redefined to be U+20AC EURO SIGN.  </s>
<s> What would be the appropriate course of action to deal with this discrepancy?  </s>
<s> Registering a new "macintosh-euro" character set seems like overkill.  </s>
<s> Apple would prefer to just redefine the IANA-registered character set "macintosh" to conform to the new definition of MacRoman.  </s>
<s> Is that allowed?  </s>
<s> If so, what procedure should be followed?  </s>
<s> The definition of MacRoman can be found at: Would it be appropriate to refer to that rather than to a (revised) RFC?  </s>

<s> nobody seems to have commented on this.... if "macintosh" is used in the industry to refer to a charset that has the euro sign in it, then I, personally, think that we should update the registration to point out that fact.  </s>
<s> In a more rational world, a new "macintosh-euro" charset would be registered, but the currency symbol is the single most useless character I know about - redefining its codepoint does not cause a great deal of harm to the world.  </s>
<s> What do others think?  </s>

<s> Whenever a character in a charset changes, that can cause data to be  </s>
<s> corrupted.  </s>
<s> It is especially important nowadays, when the internal character set is Unicode/10646, and XML (or HTML) are used to serialize the text in a different character set.  </s>
<s> Here is what happens. 1.  </s>
<s> An implementation with the old definition emitting data marked as "Macintosh" will escape a Euro sign (???) as &amp;#x20AC; while leaving the currency sign (??) alone.  </s>
<s> An implementation with the new definition receiving that data will correctly handle the Euro, but misinterpret the currency sign as a Euro.  </s>
<s> - While the currency sign is little used (and was badly conceived in the first place), it is used.  </s>
<s> For example, both in Windows and on Java it is used as a stand-in for the currency sign in a currency pattern string.  </s>
<s> Changing that to Euro would cause even apparently unrelated currency values such as dollars to appear as Euros.  </s>
<s> 2. An implementation with the new definition emitting data marked as "Macintosh" will escape a currency sign (??) as &amp;#xA4; while leaving the Euro sign (???)alone.  </s>
<s> An implementation with the old definition receiving that data will correctly handle the currency sign, but misinterpret the Euro as a currency sign.  </s>
<s> - This is even more serious.  </s>
<s> All new data with Euros will be misinterpreted on older implementations.  </s>
<s> To sum it up, changing any character in a set can be dangerous.  </s>
<s> The best way to avoid these situations is: A. Define fully qualified names for all versions of character sets.  </s>
<s> The TR22 naming conventions are strongly recommended (http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr22/).  </s>
<s> Encourage implementations to use the fully-qualified names.  </s>
<s> B. One can also have a partially-qualified name (e.g. "Macintosh") as an alias for one of these.  </s>
<s> And that alias could change over time to be the latest version.  </s>
<s> Implementers can also use the partially-qualified character set names in circumstances where robust data conversion is not as important.  </s>

<s> While all of these problems can potentially occur, do we in fact think that any of them will actually occur?  </s>
<s> If field practice is that people use the label "macintosh" to label text that comes from a machine running Mac OS, then in fact such text has been assuming the Euro for that code point since the Mac OS 8.5 era.  </s>
<s> I'm guessing since this change was made over two years ago that no one has run into severe problems due to the mismatch between the RFC and what Mac OS actually uses that code point for.  </s>
<s> It seems to me like defining a new "macintosh-1999" character set might be going a little overboard.  </s>
<s> However, I'd like to continue to gather input.  </s>
