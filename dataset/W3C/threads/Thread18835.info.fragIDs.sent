Charles do you have more specific information on the conference URL, name William Loughborough wrote another article, and his next one will be on Authoring Tools Judy - this does not fit on the events page. 
I remember a discussion (haven't looked it up) about have a list of web access articles, etc. 
It should go on that page if it exits. 
If it does not exist then perhaps it should. 
What should we do with the link to Williams article Jim
