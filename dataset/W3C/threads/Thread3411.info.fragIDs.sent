<s> Now that Netscape 7's been released, has anyone heard anything about the continued support of Netscape 4 by AOL?  </s>
<s> I know that NS4 will still be out there, but a supported and non suported product are two entirely different animals.  </s>
<s> John  </s>
<s> Netscape 4 is no longer supported and has not been for quite some time, the only reason that minor upgrades are still released is due to a contractual agreement with some large companies that obligate Netscape (who outsourced that part to a different company) to continually address any security issues that are found.  </s>

<s> Someone just told me last week that NN4.8 had been released.  </s>
<s> So it seems that there still is some support for the 4 versions out there.  </s>
<s> I do not know what types of changes were made to this release version.  </s>
<s> Mozilla may be another or better option for the web designer/developer.  </s>
<s> There are some nice added tools, and less of the packaging/promotion type items that slow down or add weight to the netscape versions.  </s>
<s> Rendering pages and support of items should be the same across the browsers.  </s>

<s> It was released, on or around August 22.  </s>
<s> I have yet to install it.  </s>
<s> Netscape's release notes are available, although they (as usual) don't actually say anything much.  </s>
<s> I can't understand why they would release this ancient browser in the same week as version 7. Maybe it's a coincidence, or some larger scheme is afoot.  </s>
<s> Ah Netscape, still an enigma... -Joseph  </s>
