<s> Problem with extra Carriage Return in Windows.  </s>
<s> I find that carriage return-linefeeds (CRLF) are getting converted to CRCRLF, an extra carriage return.  </s>
<s> This causes ever-lengthening text with Windows tools which expand a lone CR into CRLF.  </s>

<s> Hmm, which version of HTML Tidy do you use?  </s>
<s> I think I fixed all line end bugs in spring 2003.  </s>

<s> I can confirm that there does appear to be a problem/bug in Charles Reitzel's HTML Tidy for Windows dated February 17 2003.  </s>
<s> When used in write-to-file mode, eg "tidy -i mypage.old   </s>
<s> mypage.htm", it produces line-terminators of the form CRCRLF Subsequent passes through Tidy do not further change the line-terminators.  </s>
<s> In-place conversion, eg "tidy -im mypage.htm",  </s>
<s> works correctly.  </s>
<s> The "Original" August 2000 WinDos HTML Tidy (tidy04aug00.exe)  </s>

<s> In Charles Reitzel's HTML Tidy for Windows?  </s>
<s> If so where can we get a copy?  </s>
<s> I suspect that TidyLib may have been fixed but that the fiz hasn't made it's way into HTML Tidy for Windows.  </s>
<s> Not that it's a problem for me, I just wanted to warn others.  </s>
