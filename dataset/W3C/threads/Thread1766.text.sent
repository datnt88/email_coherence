Hi, Section 1.6 of the DeltaV specification defines how the pre and post condition XML elements should be returned. 
It says: "the appropriate XML element MUST be returned as the child of a top-level DAV:error element in the response body, unless otherwise negotiated by the request. 
In a 207 Multi-Status response, the DAV:error element would appear in the appropriate DAV:responsedescription element." 
This is the only definiton of DAV:error, there is no DTD for this element as far as I can tell and no examples of it's use within a multistatus response. 
It would seem to violate the DTD defined in RFC2518 for DAV:responsedescription. Am I correct in thinking that the syntax should be: Label specified does not exist The human readable text describing the error and the DAV:error element are children of the DAV:responsedescription element. 
This seems very odd. 
Why not have the DAV:error element as a child of the DAV:response element?

The rationale for putting it in the DAV:responsedescription node is that the DAV:responsedescription corresponds to the "body" of a non-multi-status response, and that is where the DAV:error node appears in a non-multi-status response. 
This does not violate the DTD for DAV:responsedescription, because a client is required to ignore any node that it doesn't understand, so it doesn't matter where you put it.

Hi, The DTD for DAV:responsedescription is: If you want to put the DAV:error element beneath DAV:responsedescription then the DTD should be modified to something like: This would allow a mix of character data and the DAV:error element. 
As the DTD stands today it only allows character data.

RE: Definition of DAV:error and it's use in multistatus...Peter, the DTD isn't normative. 
It can't be. 
I think this was discussed to great length on the ACL mailing list in December, but for some odd reason, the archive for this particular month is missing... [mailto:ietf-dav-versioning-request@w3.org]On

I agree that if DeltaV had a DTD for DAV:responsedescription, then it should take the form that you describe below, but my point was that this does not violate the 2518 DTD for DAV:responsedescription, because you would first strip out all "unknown" element types (such as DAV:error) before checking it against the 2518 DTD.
