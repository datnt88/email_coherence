<s> In addition to the answer from chaals, is it possible to provide a description that will provide a description that will direct people to certain car parks dependent upon how they enter the city?  </s>
<s> I notice that there is a description of what lies to the South, North, East, West, etc, so using landmarks near here, would my idea also be a viable option.  </s>
<s> I say this because I used a screenreader and found I was confused (although I am not blind I like to use the technology that my users could well be using).  </s>
<s> This is by no means a fault of your department Julian, it is difficult to pin down the best method of providing directions to someone, sighted or not!  </s>
<s> *grin* Particularly if they do not know the City of Sheffield well.  </s>
<s> Looking at the page in Lynx provided me with some other thoughts... the links around the map (in the graphical form) take the user in the direction described graphically.  </s>
<s> However, I am not sure that this comes across like that in a text-only browser.  </s>
<s> Again, this is only my observation and I hope that it has been of help to you.  </s>

<s> Many thanks to all who replied - very useful and constructive comment.  </s>
<s> Oops, hadn't even considered that.  </s>
<s> The alt text associated with those image links is actually the direction that the arrow points in but I guess that a more appropriate bit of text would be "move east" or "go east of here" or something similar since this is essentially what the image says.  </s>
<s> The title property for those links could (should!) give more details as to what's happening.  </s>
<s> Also, since that whole map is a series of images held tightly together in a table (we tried cssp, honest) it doesn't really make as much sense when it's linearised.  </s>
<s> Hmmm.  </s>
<s> I think a mixture of Chaal's street intersection idea and Simon's landmarks will end up being used but this is going to be a long job for someone ;-) [It may be easier to get all the car parks closed !!] Oh, Simon, fyi the guy who wrote about the 'Gary' band is dyslexic and I think we should consider ourselves unfortunate that his spelling mistake this time was actually a viable word; normally it's quite easy for us to spot them ;-) (Must have a word about spelling grey with an 'a' though -that's just not British!!) [Everybody, please note that I'm not poking fun at dyslexics; I have a couple of extremely close friends who not only have trouble with spelling but also have an innate independence and drive to succeed that fills me with admiration.  </s>
<s> I'm sure they wouldn't mind me writing about them in this list like this.] regards Julian  </s>
