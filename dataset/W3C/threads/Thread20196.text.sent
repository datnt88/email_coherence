-Jose In our previous episode, Armand said: remove Would there be any possiblity of an announcement list for Amaya? 
As an essentially entry level html coder that is merely looking for a useful tool to generate compliant pages, it's not terribly useful for me to be on a list (apparently) primarily concerned with programming Amaya itself. 
On the other hand, I would be interested in an announcement list that sends out updates of new releases. 
Thanks In-reply-to: Your message of Thu, 07 Oct 1999 12:43:08 -0500." 
We could maintain that list for announcements and bug reports and have another mailing list for amaya developers and compilation problems. 
What do you think? 
Irene. 
From The GreatWhteNorth My suggestion, stolen just before I could get it outa my mouth.. Paul Good Afternoon Paul, I thought that this was the announcement list. 
I was just added to this list. 
The description from the W3C site it says that, the www-amaya@w3.org 
mailing list is: This mailing list is for discussion about general issues of Amaya, the W3C testbed client. 
This is the official forum where we announce new Amaya releases. 
It's also a place for submitting bug reports, for proposing enhancements to Amaya, and for discussing installation and configuration problems. 
" So, Paul it would seem that you are in the official announcement forum. 
Or am I mistaken? 
Hope everyone has a Great Weekend! 
:) Wendy Arnett Assistant Webmaster Everett Computing Operations The Boeing Company This mailing list is for discussion about general issues of Of late, there has been a large amount of discussion regarding the development and compiling of Amaya. 
Not that I'm complaining, but none of which is terribly useful for me. 
I suppose you could 'argue' that this is covered within "installation and configuration problems". 
I brought it up as a suggestion, and Irene refined that suggestion by saying that there could be another list created for announcements and bug reports. 
(Which I think would be terrific, by the way). 
I'm not insistant though, since I'm not sure how much demand for something like that would be.
