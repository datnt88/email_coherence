So is the question "Should SAMI be included in the guidelines similar to 
MSAA and JAP?" or is the question "Let's review SAMI as part of the UA 
guidelines?" Of course, I'm just talking about the first question. 
ew (fwd) 
We recommend the use of accessibility APIs, and have a reference to known 
accessibility APIs including Active Accessibility. 
But we don't try to set 
or discuss specifications for those accessibility API standards. 
We can 
have input into W3C recommendations. 
Is SAMI part of any W3C recommendation processes? 
Jon 
A couple of points - the W3C does not create standards, they create recommendations. 
The guidelines reference Java Accessibility API which is considered fairly proprietary. 
If the guidelines recommend those, why should they not recommend SAMI?

If some one from Microsoft or anywhere else has any other information, please post to the list. 
This same issue came up with accessibility APIs.

I think this is what was promised.

Subject: SAMI Closed Captions are now available for your review SAMI Article #1: With the recent release of Windows Media Player came SAMI captions. 
SAMI, Synchronized Accessible Media Interchange, is a single authoring format 
for 
captions and audio descriptions. 
This article and set of demos focus on captioning. 
There will be subsequent articles on audio description (see 
list 
below). 
SAMI Overview article: http://microsoft.com/enable/products/multimedia.htm http://microsoft.com/enable/products/multimedia.htm ******* Please review the following before you download any SAMI demos******** SAMI Format article: http://microsoft.com/enable/products/sami.htm http://microsoft.com/enable/products/sami.htm There has been much confusion about the role of SAMI vs. the role of SMIL. 
The two are quite different though they use similar techniques to 
accomplish 
their goals. 
SMIL is a set of XML based elements used for presenting and positioning synchronized components of a multimedia presentation. 
On the other hand, SAMI is an authoring format solely designed to deliver synchronized captions and audio description. 
SAMI has been designed to provide multiple language and style support. 
The latter is critical for accessibility. 
That is, if the user is unable to read the captions due to 
a 
visual impairment then we can question whether we have provided captions 
to 
that user. 
Thus, SAMI supports multiple styles so the caption author can provide, in addition to a standard font, several varieties of large print 
or 
color combinations for the user to select from. 
Furthermore, SAMI 
introduces 
an optional Source ID line that continuously displays the source of the sound. 
This is valuable for many dyslexics and people with short-term 
memory 
loss (those, like myself, over 40). 
Future articles: * Using SAMI for Closed Captions on the Web (mid September) * SAMI Support of Audio Description (mid October) * SAMI as an authoring format for EIA608, EIA708, DVD, and Web encoding - full SAMI spec (mid November) * SAMI Caption Authoring Tool (mid December) Note: We are currently working on version 2 of Windows Media Player's SAMI support. 
Please send your suggestions directly to me.

I originally posted this as part of the smil track because those of us in that subgroup are looking at all of these types of pluggins and operables if you will just like we all look at the different browsers. 
My reason 
then was to provide something besides g2 and the wgbh smil examples for us 
to look at for issue comparison. 
I think unless jim allan and the rest of 
the ggroup are ready to do so that I'm not aware of, we don't have a 
guideline or an issue track as yet unless you look at the current work. 
Also chuck, I'm quite interested in the audio description component soon to be added. 
and I've a question. 
is there going to be a player independant util for this. 
for one reason or annother some of us will not or cannot use the ms media player. 
I am not one of them but there are issues even if rhumoured you know. 
Thanks!

Response to Chuck Oppermann. 
1. 
The UA guidelines would want to focus on the potential user interface issues of a SAMI player related to accessibility. 
2. The potential recommendation or reference to use SAMI as an authoring format for accessibility would be under the Page Authoring guidelines to consider. 
3. Features for Authoring Tools to create accessible SAMI documents would be part of the tools working group. 
Would you like to propose adding a section in the User Agent guidelines on features for an accessible SAMI player?
