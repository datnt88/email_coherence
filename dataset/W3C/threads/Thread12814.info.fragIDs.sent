<s> I am a bit concerned by these results.  </s>
<s> I find that several of them are not fully accessible according to WAI guidelines, and the majority of these designs would not be considered acceptable in any commercial environment, which I was hoping the contest would encourage.  </s>

<s> Laurence, Alan, I've added it to our agenda for tomorrow's EOWG meeting.  </s>
<s> I had some of the same reaction as Laurence, but noted that all the winning sites in the contest seemed to be university-based, and so aren't necessarily going to reflect leading edge electronic commerce design.  </s>
<s> My general reaction is that these kinds of contests really help awareness.  </s>
<s> I don't think that they're supposed to be a substitute for the "gallery" that we've been talking about http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/Gallery ; and over time, there should be more &amp; more choices of Double-A WCAG compliant Web sites from which any contest can select winning designs, and also more &amp; more choices of tools &amp; approaches with which to comprehensively evaluate sites.  </s>
<s> But in the meantime -- nice to see people including accessibility as in contests.  </s>
<s> By the way, I get an error message at the "extraordinary design" award site -- "Could not find the application specified in the URL", using Opera 3.61.  </s>
<s> Anyone else get similar result?  </s>
