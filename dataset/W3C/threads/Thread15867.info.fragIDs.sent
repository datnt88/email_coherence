This is a general question regarding the evolution of Lotus Notes databases into warehouses for online documents. 
My organisation is seriously looking at changing its website from a html centric site, to one where the documents reside on a domino server, within Lotus Notes databases. 
The way this Notes centric site will work is that the documents will be developed as rich text only, then dumped into a Lotus Notes database. 
Only when this document is called by someone on the web will domino then add html on the fly to the document, making it web-visible. 
As we consider the issue of accessibility an important one for our organisation, we are concerned as to what impact this may have on the accessibility of the information. 
It seems that if the html is developed on the fly when a document is called, then we would have limited control as to the quality of that html. 
I would appreciate any views on this.

to follow up on what Robert Savellis said: 
What you get from the automation is consistency. 
If the HTML conversion is good, it will all be good. 
Automation is ultimately your friend, once they get it right. 
I would claim Chris Maden's recent post as support for this idea. 
You are left with the question "Have they got it right, yet." 
That question is something one could actually look into. 
Consider requesting references from your Lotus sales organization to sites now served in this way which are comparable to what your site would do. 
Get some of your friendly web users to review the example sites. 
Back them up with a little HTML Validator and Bobby evaluation, but trust the people. 
Review your punch list with the people who would be maintaining the Lotus scripts that generate the HTML.

Before asking about the quality of the conversion process, you have to wonder about the quality of the storage format used by domino, rtf it seems. 
Does it allow for attaching textual description of images, short and long, does it separate presentation from content/structure (i.e. is it style sheet based), does it provide the required level of abstraction for list and table, if it has input, like imagemap and form, does it store alt text for sensitive spost or things like accesskey and field grouping ? 
Another question. 
Does the model use frames to provide navigation and actual output text (as Cold fusion, a simialr product, does where I have seen it, or does it provide the interface with the text served, as per alta vista? 
As I understand it, this would still be problematic.
