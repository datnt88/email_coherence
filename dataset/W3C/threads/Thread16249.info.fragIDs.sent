I can't get the live audio from the ADA/Internet hearing. 
Is anyone getting it? 
It crashes my poor Mac and on Windows I'm told it can't find the server.

I have contacted the U.S. House of Representatives, Committee on the Judiciary offices twice. 
Both times they have said they are working on the feed but experiencing technical difficulties.

aloha, madeleine! 
it's crashed my WIn95B box thrice, i've connected to a steady stream of static four times, and MediaPlayer has reported that it can't find the server six or seven times... as i pointed out in a post a couple of days ago, there isn't any contact info listed on any of the pages concerning the audio feed, so i sent my problem report to webmaster@house.gov and sysadmin@house.gov
