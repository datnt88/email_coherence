Hi Chris, In the 16 Jan 2001 draft of the User Agent Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 [1], there are two checkpoints that involve control of animations: 4.4 Allow the user to slow the presentation rate of audio, video and animations. 
For a visual track, provide at least one setting between 40% and 60% of the original speed. 
For a prerecorded audio track including audio-only presentations, provide at least one setting between 75% and 80% of the original speed. 
When the user agent allows the user to slow the visual track of a synchronized multimedia presentation to between 100% and 80% of its original speed, synchronize the visual and audio tracks. 
Below 80%, the user agent is not required to render the audio track. 
The user agent is not required to satisfy this checkpoint for audio, video and animations whose recognized role is to create a purely stylistic effect. 
[Priority 1] 4.5 Allow the user to stop, pause, resume, fast advance, and fast reverse audio, video, and animations that last three or more seconds at their default playback rate. 
The user agent is not required to satisfy this checkpoint for audio, video and animations whose recognized role is to create a purely stylistic effect. 
[Priority 1] We are currently discussing whether these requirements should apply to any type of animation (does that make sense?) or format used to create animation (markup, script, image format, style sheet). 
Note: We have a general "exemption" clause in our document (for the purposes of conformance) that says that if the format doesn't enable the UA to recognize or control the animation effect, then the requirements don't apply. 
So my questions are: 1) Do you think that there are any classes of animation or animation formats for which these requirements don't make sense? 
2) Do you have a good definition of "animation" handy? 
Thanks for any input, - Ian [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20010116 Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org) http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs Cell: +1 917 450-8783 
I have a question and a comment: question: is there an example of a "stylistic effect"? 
comment. 
With pitch supression as it is done through speech synthesis today, the audio can be much slower than 80 percent and still be understood. 
I can get my accent to comprehend quite low rates for instance at 50 percent. 
if the voice is pre-recorded and synched then of course, at low rates much like a recording of any kind, it falls off the low end of the comprehensibility scale. 
A further note. 
many animations are accompanied by synthesized speech such as in ms agent. 
The characters move and speak but we currently have no control over the motion or the audio.

There is a risk that changing the speed, even while respecting the synchronisation, will make one component harder or impossible to understand. 
We should note that possibility. 
But that is the price to pay for getting another track better understood, although it might end up being two passes to get the whole message (this is better than two passes that end up with no ability to understand it).

One customization that I would like: Allow my audiogram (hearing loss vs frequency) to shape the algorithm used for rate change without pitch shift. 
This is significant to me, as I have 60db loss between 2Khz and 3Khz. 
I would like to have the plosives to be stretched, to reduce their high-frequency harmonics. 
Does anyone have any experience with this possibility? 
An analogous technique might be important to shorten low-frequency phonemes (such as changing to a female voice to avoid the too-low fundamental). 
My customization desire would apply to listening to narrations in SMIL, as we need for digital talking books.
