Dear readers, Unfortunately I will nog be able to join the coming GL meeting. 
I think the current documents cover the needs of regular HTML readers. 
One item though, that is mentioned several times, is not really solved properly. 
This concerns interactive aspect of WWW usage. 
More and more sites use JavaScripting for this. 
I'd be happy if some guidelines could be added to regulate scripting. 
Problems: - Instability of the screen becuse of moving objects (already mentioned but from a different view point). 
- In many cases Javascript-based links behave different than HTML links. 
How can this be avoided. 
- Links sometimes have strange names: the names of the scripting routines they belong to. 
How can this be avoided. 
- Because of scripting requirements links show up in the tab order that are no real links. 
They are only needed for technical reasons. 
How can these "hidden links" be avoided or how can they be recognized by the screen reader (and rejected as irrelevant) or by the user? 
I do hope you see my point. 
Since more and more sites require interaction this problem is becoming more and more important.

Tricky problem. 
The best way to have them avoided is not to use them. 
If you do, provide an accessible alternative. 
(The reason for putting them in links is that Internet Explorer only deals with them in links. 
The HTML 4 recommendation, which provides the triggers most authors are using, makes no such stricture, and it is perfectly possible to put a trigger directly onto an element as per the specification. 
It just means that MSIE falls into the large net of browsers which don't handle scripts properly (I think actually every browser is in that category at the moment).

Jaap, Good to hear from you. 
Your comments on interactive pages were discussed in the working group telecon yesterday and I took the action to write up the discussion. 
We believe most of these concerns are addressed by the checkpoints under "Guideline 6. Ensure that pages featuring new technologies transform gracefully." 
However, when it comes to spurious stopping places in the tabbing sequence, the User Agent guidelines are involved, too. 
The User Agent working group is developing guidelines on navigation inside the page that address knowing what places to stop and where not to stop. 
For suitable navigation stops, including genuine links, the Web Content guidelines require them to be self-explanatory, to let you know why you are stopping there. 
Some unnecessary anchor tags are indeed placed around scripts to make the pages work with current browsers. 
This is discussed in http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/1999JanMar/0322.html . 
When the browsers implement the User Agent guidelines this misuse of markup will no longer be necessary.
