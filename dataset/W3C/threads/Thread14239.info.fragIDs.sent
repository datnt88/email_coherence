<s> Tricky problem.  </s>
<s> The best way to have them avoided is not to use them.  </s>
<s> If you do, provide an accessible alternative.  </s>
<s> (The reason for putting them in links is that Internet Explorer only deals with them in links.  </s>
<s> The HTML 4 recommendation, which provides the triggers most authors are using, makes no such stricture, and it is perfectly possible to put a trigger directly onto an element as per the specification.  </s>
<s> It just means that MSIE falls into the large net of browsers which don't handle scripts properly (I think actually every browser is in that category at the moment).  </s>

<s> Jaap, Good to hear from you.  </s>
<s> Your comments on interactive pages were discussed in the working group telecon yesterday and I took the action to write up the discussion.  </s>
<s> We believe most of these concerns are addressed by the checkpoints under "Guideline 6. Ensure that pages featuring new technologies transform gracefully."  </s>
<s> However, when it comes to spurious stopping places in the tabbing sequence, the User Agent guidelines are involved, too.  </s>
<s> The User Agent working group is developing guidelines on navigation inside the page that address knowing what places to stop and where not to stop.  </s>
<s> For suitable navigation stops, including genuine links, the Web Content guidelines require them to be self-explanatory, to let you know why you are stopping there.  </s>
<s> Some unnecessary anchor tags are indeed placed around scripts to make the pages work with current browsers.  </s>
<s> This is discussed in http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/1999JanMar/0322.html .  </s>
<s> When the browsers implement the User Agent guidelines this misuse of markup will no longer be necessary.  </s>
<s> Al  </s>
