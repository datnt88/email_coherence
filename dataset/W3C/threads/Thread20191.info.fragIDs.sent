<s> I am trying to use the HTML parser of Amaya.  </s>
<s> (compiled html2thot.c  </s>
<s> in STANDALONE mode).  </s>
<s> I've parsed an HTML file into a Document.  </s>
<s> I then try to save the document back to another HTML file using TtaExportDocument(Document doc, char* fileName, "HTMLT"); (The last parameter is either "HTMLT" or "HTMLT.TRA".  </s>
<s> I am sending the mail from my NT boot and my development env is in my Linux boot and I need to reboot into Linux to know exactly which.  </s>
<s> Anyway, I got the value by looking at the code in HTMLSave.c  </s>
<s> file) The resulting HTML file is nothing like the original HTML file.  </s>
<s> It lost its TITLE and the BODY.  </s>
<s> What am I doing wrong here?  </s>
<s> Thanks Hima  </s>

<s> We didn't test the standalone version of the Amaya HTML parser for a while but there is no reason for not generating the TITLE and the BODY if they are there in the original document.  </s>
<s> An extra-code in Amaya adds these elements if they are not present.  </s>
<s> Perhaps you need to add part of that extra-code.  </s>

<s> Thanks for the response Irene.  </s>
<s> I resolved this problem a couple of days back but hadn't got around to letting you know.  </s>
<s> The placement of the compilation directive (STANDALONE) in html2thot.c is wrong.  </s>
<s> The HTML file is not parsed correctly into the document.  </s>
<s> I will send you the modifications I made as soon as I can spare a moment (probably tomorrow).  </s>
<s> Also, the HTML parser in standalone mode should only need libThotKernel and libz.  </s>
<s> However, libThotKernel as it is built using the makefile in 'Amaya/obj/thotlib' does not allow this.  </s>
<s> Some of the object files (*.o) had to be changed to (*ND.o) by the appropriate insertion of the 'NODISPLAY' compilation directive in the source code.  </s>

<s> OK I'll integrate your modifications.  </s>
<s> Is your proposal to force the building of the libThotKernel in the "make html2piv"?  </s>
<s> Irene.  </s>
