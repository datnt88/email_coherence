<s> Some suggestions about FTP possibilities for AMAYA using HTML Interface : The FTP utility that adds a new button to Browser, the FTP button, that shows a FTP Toolbar in a similar way to Radio Button in Internet Explorer.  </s>
<s> The buttons that would appear in the FTP ToolBar would be ( like the WS FTP buttons) : - Connect (to select the FTP server).  </s>
<s> - Cancel - Options - Exit ( the download/upload can continue even if the FTP button has been loosen ).  </s>
<s> In the Browser?s Window would appear six frames: - One LOCAL SYSTEM ( para el disco duro local ) - The second, near the first, with the necessary buttons to manage local files ( change Dir, Make Dir, *.*, View, Exec, Rename, Delete, Refresh, DirInfo, los mismos de WS-FTP, pero en formato web) - Central with transfer buttons ( - y - ). - Fourth for REMOTE SYSTEM - Fifth to manage local files ( change Dir, Make Dir, *.*, View, Exec, Rename, Delete, Refresh, DirInfo) - Sixth, under the rest, would be the Status one.  </s>
<s> In Browser?s Edition function would be included a command "Save with FTPWebbrowser" that would open Internet Explorer with the local address of the file to transfer - and if saved in Options - the remote address to upload the edited page.  </s>
