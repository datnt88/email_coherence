<s> Hello: Please could someone let me know how one might insert a date/time (e.g., for showing the last time a document was saved) in a XHTML document suing Amaya.  </s>
<s> I have tried every menu key, as well as searched the archives.  </s>

<s> At W3C we use a server-based trick for doing this - if you have a magic string in a document and save it to our servers, it will replace the magic string with the current date/time as it saves.  </s>
<s> This is not a function of Amaya.  </s>

<s> Hi Nilo, We don't have that functionality in Amaya.  </s>

<s> Just as Charles mentioned the technique Amaya uses, I do the same within a programming utility that also converts a flat file to a list construct.  </s>
<s> If you are in wintel platform i can provide just the date convert part.  </s>

<s> You could use RCS to do this for you, with $Date$ and/or $Revision$.  </s>
<s> I have a few links to info on RCS at: SCCS will do similar things for you, but I can't remember how.  </s>
<s> Note, the timestamp refers to the checkin date.  </s>
<s> Hope that is near enough for your needs.  </s>
