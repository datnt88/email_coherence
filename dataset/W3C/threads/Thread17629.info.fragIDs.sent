<s> Find [next] instance matching pattern .  </s>

<s> Have you played with the Lynx functions?  </s>
<s> They are pretty simple but there is some adjustment of what class of elements is numbered, and then there is both incremental and absolute motion within that class.  </s>
<s> [Incremental motion over a default class even when nothing is numbered] This is of enough interest so that this functionality is still growing.  </s>

<s> Given the dubious success in making forms slick for all, access to query formulation is a research topic IMHO.  </s>

<s> To be as intuitive as possible, you might have a generic "Find the next like this" command that worked for all types of markup.  </s>
<s> If the point-of-regard were on a Header1, it would find the next Header1, if on a form control, it would find the next form control, if on a table, it would find the next table.  </s>
<s> This is an implementation question, but could be a fairly cool feature to have in a browser!  </s>
