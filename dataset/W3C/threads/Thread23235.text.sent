W3C is pleased to announce that DOM Level 2 HTML is a W3C Candidate Recommendation: Status of this document This section describes the status of this document at the time of its publication. 
Other documents may supersede this document. 
The latest status of this document series is maintained at the W3C. 
This is the 05 June 2002 W3C Candidate Recommendation of "DOM Level 2". W3C publishes a technical report as a Candidate Recommendation to indicate that the document is believed to be stable, and to encourage implementation by the developer community. 
Candidate Recommendation status is described in section 5.2.3 of the Process Document. 
The DOM Working Group expects to request that the Director advance this specification to Proposed Recommendation after the DOM Working Group documents two interoperable implementations of at least one normative binding. 
The two implementations must be produced by different organizations. 
The review period ends on 1 July 2002. 
Please send review comments before the review period ends to www-dom@w3.org (archive). 
Publication as a Candidate Recommendation does not imply endorsement by the W3C Membership. 
This is a draft document and may be updated, replaced or obsoleted by other documents at any time. 
It is inappropriate to cite this document as other than "work in progress." 
Some changes from DOM Level 1 HTML are incompatible with that specification but represent more accurately the state of deployed software. 
Therefore, this specification renders the DOM Level 1 HTML Recommendation obsolete. 
W3C strongly suggests that developers and authors conform to DOM Level 2 HTML instead. 
Patent disclosures relevant to this specification may be found on the Working Group's public patent disclosure page. 
This document has been produced as part of the W3C DOM Activity. 
The authors of this document are the DOM Working Group participants. 
A list of current W3C Recommendations and other technical documents can be found at http://www.w3.org/TR. 
Exit Criteria The DOM Working Group expects the Candidate Recommendation phase to last at least one month. 
To evaluate implementations as part of this Candidate Recommendation period, the DOM Working Group will use the DOM Level 2 HTML Conformance Test Suite, produced as part of the DOM Conformance Test Suites effort: Depending on the results, the DOM Working Group may decide to request Proposed Recommendation status, take additional time to seek conforming implementations, or drop some of the features included in the specification. 
Additional notes For issue i6 [http://www.w3.org/2001/12/DOM-Level-2-issues#i6], the Director requested that the following text be added to the document: "Note: The onsubmit even handler is not guaranteed to be triggered when invoking this method. 
The behavior is inconsistent for historical reasons and authors should not rely on a particular one." 
The official issues list for this Candidate Recommendation is available at: Philippe, DOM Activity Lead.
