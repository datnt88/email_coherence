Hi Sorry is this is a dumb question but what exactly is the difference between ABBR and ACRONYM? 
And as ACRONYM seems to be in the latest HTML4 spec and ABBR is not is it more sensible to use ACRONYM? 
Chris chris@atomism.demon.co.uk to follow up on what Chris Croome said: Actually, in the final Recommendation both are there. 
You won't find much difference except in the textual explanation. 
Put the full spelling of the definitive expansion in TITLE in either case.

On another subject has anyone had any bright ideas about what to do with mdashes -- one site I've been helping with has been using two regular dashes, like this: -- and I've been using &amp;#151; on another site. 
However I've now realized that while &amp;#151; works OK it's not in the ISO character set. 
And what is concerning me more is how speech synthesizers would deal with this, anyone got any ideas? 
Thanks Chris chris@atomism.demon.co.uk
