<s> Hello everybody, I am trying to understandand how the DOM provides named access to elements, at least HTML elements but why not to core elements too.  </s>
<s> The IDL for HTMLElement specifies an 'id' attribute, which I assumes has the same semantics as the HTML 4.0 ID attribute.  </s>
<s> For the IMG element specifies a 'name' attribute for compatibility reasons.  </s>
<s> I see the images() methods to get a NamedNodeList which I assumes allows to find an IMG element by its 'name' attribute or by its 'id' attribute...  </s>
<s> The same goes for applets, links, forms and anchors.  </s>
<s> However since all elements have an ID in HTML 4.0 I expect to be able to access any element by its document wide ID (DIV elements for instance).  </s>
<s> How do I do that ?  </s>
<s> I would like to explain to developpers how the code they used to write for the various browsers should be written with the DOM.  </s>
<s> Since there has never been a NAME attribute on IMG in standard HTML I would like to emphasize the use of ID and point out its advantage or uniform semantics for all elements.  </s>
<s> This does not really make sense without a named access to all elements.  </s>
<s> Thanks for your help, Antoine Bertier antoine.bertier@axa.com  </s>
<s> It's more difficult for Core elements, since something called "ID" may not in fact be one, and something with another name may be an ID.  </s>
<s> So we have to come up with a generalised method.  </s>
<s> We will be doing this after Level 1 is out.  </s>
<s> Yes, the id attribute is the ID attribute - HTML does not have  </s>
<s> case-sensitivity.  </s>
<s> Yes.  </s>
<s> This is currently being discussed in the DOM WG and there will be a method in the next public draft to access elements by their unique ID. Lauren  </s>
<s> Thanks for the answers!  </s>
<s> I am eargerly expecting the next public draft.  </s>
<s> In the current draft DOM HTML 1 the id attribute is not described in the text, it just appears in the IDL.  </s>
<s> Regards, Antoine.  </s>
