Hi! 
I am using Microsoft's XML Parser. 
My question is.. 
Is there any way, by which I can load only a part of a document in memory using load method. 
of the "DOMDocument" interface. 
As I want to search in only a part of a document, I want to load only a part of that document. 
Because my document can be really big, loading complete document is going to be really bad for me. 
Please tell me ..is there any way..? regards Santosh Moholkar.

Since you're using Microsoft's parser, I'd suggest you contact one of Microsoft's support channels to find out what they can or can't do for you. 
The DOM doesn't yet have an official answer for this, thought DOM Level 3's Load/Save chapter is expected to address it. 
(The closest thing to a general solution right now is to use a SAX parser, run the SAX stream through a filter that selects only those portions of the document you're interested in, and run the resulting filtered SAX stream into a SAX-to-DOM builder.) Joe Kesselman / IBM Research

Questions on a specific implementation should be asked in the appropriate forum, in this case the newsgroup public.microsoft.xml (also available through http://msdn.microsoft.com) 
I don't believe there is a practical way to have MSXML create a object model for part of a document. 
It is possible in parsers that layer DOM on top of SAX (most likely candidate on Microsoft platforms would be Xerces-C) where you can add a filter between the layers that discard parts of the document you are not interest in. 
Or you may be able to accomplish your objectives using the SAX interfaces of MSXML.
