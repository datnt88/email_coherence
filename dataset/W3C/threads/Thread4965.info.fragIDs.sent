<s> I agree with Dimitre that xsl:key and xsl:id should have the same argument forms but I do question why this is needed (for id() or key()) It is true that the XSLT1 for-each hack was horrible but given that the XPath2 versions allow id() to be used within a path expression and index the document current at that point, what is gained by the new syntax.  </s>

<s> Yes there are a great many things in XPath2 that are more horrible than this small duplication of functionality.  </s>
<s> But actually what is the semantics of the second argument?  </s>
<s> Does it have to be a single document node, or is there some implicit application of union and root() invoked as would be the case if id($a,$b) were defined to be $b/id($a).  </s>
