One year ago Kent State University repositioned its web-presence from academic computing to University Relations and Marketing and Communications (Media). 
When this was done they chose our office to build the "official" site (the portion of the site that provides a "front door" to the the WWW). 
One of the requirements for this was accessibility options. 
The foundation of Kent State University's site is textual information: News stories, biographical paraghraphs, bulletins, etc... 
With this in mind we designed the site with the textual content at the center. 
The second consideration was the layout of the site, our clients (University Communications and Marketing) stressed the importance of consistancy from page to page. 
It was also brought to our attention that a portion of the audience is "print impaired". 
I had never heard this term before. 
It was explained to me that "print impaired" refers to those readers who due to cerebal palsy or near-blindness cannot navigate textual information. 
While many print-impaired individuals can see the text on a page, it takes them much longer to read the layout of a page, and thus to change their mode of navigation- where the navigation tools are. 
Layout was extremely important. 
We designed the layout of the page so that links would always be in the same place, navigation toolbars the same and also consistant. 
This broke up the textual content mentioned earlier into two groups: link text and body text. 
The layout of the page was built using tables with server-side includes in cells, creating "templates" that can be easily swapped when a better or different layout was found to be appropriate. 
The third issue, which in fact had been in the plans from the beginning, was providing a seamless alternate site for those readers who wanted to browse the site without tables and images. 
It has been suggested that providing such alternate pages is in good form with accessibility guidelines gathered from validators like Bobby. 
However, many of these alternate pages require either that readers constantly switch back to a text only page after selecting alink on a text-only page that refers to a image/table page or that maintainters of a site reproduce all content in a text-only form with links changed to the text-only pages. 
With our "template" strategy, we found that it was easier to enable different "views" of the same information. 
The menubar (a cgi which changes its form depending on howit is called in the path information) allowed a mechanisim for transport between these views. 
We installed two servers, one on port 80 and one on port 81. 
The port 80 server (the default) is configured to pull up as its default homepages a file called index.shtml. 
The server on port 81 is configured to pull as default a file called tindex.shtml. 
index.shtml is the tables/image ssi template, the tindex.shtml is an ssi template with no images or tables. 
All urls in the link text are relative (the homepage is referred to as "/"). 
The result is that content need only be edited in one place at one time, and a reader once shifting over to port 81 (the text site) remains on port 81 until they switch back over to port 80 (the tables/graphics site). 
So far we have had no problems, the site is accessible to text readers, provides a consistant layout for the visually-abled print impaired and is easy as pie to maintain.

Thanks, Jack Hines Nick Traenkner,design manager Kent Infoworks pobox 5190 Kent, Ohio 44242-0001 I really dislike the hard-coded carriage returns in the ALT attributes. 
You can never predict what will wrap and won't in a browser. 
Internet Explorer 4.01 has an option to make sure the entire ALT text is displayed, under the View Menu, Internet Options, Advanced, "Always Expand ALT text". 
Internet Explorer 3.x and 4.0 also supported this feature, but was programmatically turned on by the presence of a screen reader.

Thanks, Jack Hines Nick Traenkner,design manager Kent Infoworks pobox 5190 Kent, Ohio 44242-0001 Hmmm, so do I. I removed some from the front page. 
This was unexpected. 
Thank you for the keen observation.

how would mosaic 1.0 handle this?
