<s> I found this message very helpful.  </s>
<s> I realise you have made these points before, and whilst repeating yourself is burden on you, I found that collecting these points together helped clarify things in my mind at least, considerably.  </s>
<s> So, if I can try to summarize (at least my understanding) of the details you gave (I've included some detailed comments amongst your text below, but they are not greatly relevant, I think).  </s>
<s> - users familar with XML will be surprised that the lang tag does not affect an xml literal - users will be confused that plain literals are treated differently from XML literals - the common case is that the user wishes an enclosing lang tag to apply to an xml literal, so why burden the user with duplicating the information - not all XML languages have neutral elements such as span that can be added to hold extra type information - conversion from other XML languages to RDF/XML will require more complex code  </s>
<s> Now, here is an attempt to reconstruct a rationale for why RDFCore chose the option it did.  </s>
<s> I'm not writing this in any sense in a defensive posture.  </s>
<s> My view is that RDFCore simplified the handling of XML Literals post last call and sought feedback from i18n whether it had simplified too far.  </s>
<s> I just want to get the arguments laid out so we can all take an informed decision about that question.  </s>
<s> - RDFCore had last call feedback, particularly from members of WEBONT that the treatment of XML literals in the last call WD's was unsatisfactory, particularly in the formal treatment, leading to a desire for simplification and greater uniformity.  </s>
<s> This is what led to the post last call proposal.  </s>
<s> - RDFCore considered retaining the wrapper element, but decided not to because it is more complicated for *implementors* (I note i18n's arguments are more user centred)  </s>
<s> - It has been argued that there are cases where importation of the lang tag is not desired, so why burden users with having to turn it off Likely I need some help here to correct, clarify and complete.  </s>
<s> RDFCore, please chip in and I'll summarize again if necessary, afterwards.  </s>
<s> I note that i18n arguments centre around a user writing RDF/XML by hand.  </s>
<s> I wonder whether some of the differences of view arise because RDFCore expects RDF/XML to be largely written by machine.  </s>
<s> Martin has rightly pointed out that there are several possible solutions to the issue b), but I would like to be clear whether reintroducing the wrapper element would be satisfactory.  </s>
<s> Martin, in your opinion, would re-introducing the wrapper element and having it carry any in scope lang tag address issue b) to i18n's satisfaction?  </s>
<s> A few minor comments interspersed below.  </s>
<s> Brian  </s>
<s> How do you suggest we will ever be able to explain to users that one of the literals is the same in both cases, because xml:lang doesn't count for the XML Literal, but is different for the other case, because in that case, xml:lang counts?  </s>
<s> That just for the thing that the spec calls an XML Literal, the language inheritance rules of XML 1.0 are put out of force?  </s>
<s> The explanation might be that parseType="Literal" indicates a standalone fragment of XML embedded or quoted within the current document.  </s>
<s> This isn't strictly true in that a default namespace is carried in, but that could be described as an exception.  </s>
<s> XML isn't very good at embedding in itself - I think one of the reasons we have this problem.  </s>
<s> - Adding an additional element is a change of the markup, it effectively creates something different (see my answers to Pat for details)  </s>
<s> True, but that's a feature not an argument.  </s>
<s> - It can get overly voluminous even if (almost) everything is in one language.  </s>
<s> Hmm, not convinced by that.  </s>
<s> - It makes adding language information very tedious even in the simplest cases.  </s>
<s> "very"?  </s>
<s> Thats value laden.  </s>
<s> The objective fact is that it requires the addition of one extra element where one needs to specify a language.  </s>
<s> It is definitely not so that adding language information is the first thing that people creating data are thinking about.  </s>
<s> If it gets too complicated, they will just ignore it (might work out somehow) or they may do it in a haphazard fashion (very bad).  </s>
<s> Martin: is that the sum of your objection?  </s>
<s> Can you provide better examples that clearly indicate the force of your argument?  </s>
<s> I hope I have done so above.  </s>
<s> Thank you.  </s>
<s> Excellent job.  </s>
<s> One of the cons that some people have mentioned is that having language inherit may make it more difficult to integrate data from different sources.  </s>
<s> I personally don't see that argument.  </s>
<s> I assume that data integration would be done on the RDF graph, not in the XML syntax, so that issue just doesn't arise.  </s>
<s> Brian  </s>
<s> (note I am not copying i18n et al.)  </s>
<s> I am not convinced by the "*implementors*" part here.  </s>
<s> At the time I got the impression that the rest of the group just found what I was advocating (retaining the wrapper element) too complicated.  </s>
<s> I don't think we discussed "too complicated" for whom.  </s>
<s> After, as I was contemplating the arguments made by the rest of the group it seemed that really this "too complicated" is too complicated for someone beginning RDF, it's a dirty hack whose inelegance is such that it will put people off understanding this construct.  </s>
<s> Since, as Pat so rightly points out, we take the G view, we are unwilling to have a hack that messes that up badly.  </s>
