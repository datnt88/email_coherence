<s> The closure rules for RDF are incomplete.  </s>
<s> There are XML documents without an enclosing language tag that have the same canonical form as XML documents with and enclosing language tag.  </s>
<s> This means that the RDF entailment lemma is false.  </s>
<s> This comment is correct and the error will be corrected.  </s>
<s> The new closure rule will simply state FROM xxx aaa lll .  </s>
<s> where lll is a well-formed XML typed literal .  </s>
<s> INFER xxx aaa mmm .  </s>
<s> where mmm is a well-formed XML typed literal with the same canonical form as lll.  </s>
<s> where 'canonical form' is defined explicitly using the construction in the Concepts document.  </s>
<s> I would also like to add prose like this: "In rule rdf2, 'same canonical form' should be interpreted so as to take into account any language tags which may be present.  </s>
<s> For example, this rule will sanction the following inference: ex:sub ex:prop " rdf lang="fr" word chat /word /rdf "^^rdf:XMLLiteral .  </s>

<s> I don't believe that this works.  </s>
<s> Well, it appears to me that there needs to be more work in making sure that the treatment of XMLLiteral is the same in Syntax, Concepts, and Semantics.  </s>
<s> Right now, it appears to me that there are differences.  </s>

<s> To the fullest extent possible, I propose to remove all XML-related definitions, structures, etc. from the semantics document and simply refer to the Concepts document, using terminology defined there.  </s>
<s> And if I do use any examples (like the above, which I now see doesn't work) I will get Jeremy or Graham to write them for me.  </s>
