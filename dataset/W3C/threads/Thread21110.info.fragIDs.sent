We have a number of folks using Amaya 8.0 on Linux (Red Hat 9.0). 
For the last 66 buttons as well as the 1st button, the buttons are not labeled. 
(This makes math mode unusable, since the missing labeled buttons include essential characters like greater-or-equal, plus-or-minus, approximately, set operators, logical operators, summation, root, differentiation, etc.) If clicked, the buttons do generate the correct characters, so it's just a problem of labeling the buttons. 
Perhaps the wrong font is used by default. 
(The main Amaya window has no problem with displaying those characters, so it's not that the machines don't have a suitable font installed.) 
If the problem indeed turns out to be the choice of font used for the palette, then given that Red Hat is such a common Linux distribution, perhaps a different default font could be used in the next release? 
In the meantime, any ideas on a workaround? 
Perhaps advice on some font to install?

Amaya uses esstix fonts and the font requested to display the keyboard is 
"-ttf-esstixone-*-*-*-*-14-*-*-*-*-*-*-*" See in the FAQ how to load and install these fonts.

Thank you for the suggestion. 
We went through these steps but the problem persisted. 
It appears to be an incompatibility between Amaya and the GTK version in RedHat 9.0. 
Here's why: 1. 
We managed to install RPMS package version of Amaya 8.0 (GTK version), which was downloaded from w3.org, onto RedHat 9.0. 
We experienced the font problem on the Greek Letters palette. 
2. We installed the same RPM (GTK) package on a PC running Mandrake Linux 9.1. 
No problem with the Greek Letters palette. 
3. We compiled Amaya 8.0 from the source code with GTK option on RedHat 9.0. 
The resultant binary still exhibits the same font display problem on the Greek Letters palette. 
4. We compiled Amaya 8.0 from the source code, using Motif (lesstif) instead of GTK (ie. 
--without-gtk). 
No problem with the Greek Letters palette, even without installing the esstix fonts. 
5. On Solaris platform, we compiled Amaya 8.0 from the source code, with GTK option. 
No problem with the Greek Letters palette. 
Our RedHat 9.0 (not 8.0!) systems were created with the vanilla installation process, and should not be the cause of the problem. 
It should be easy to replicate the problem by trying step (3) above. 
Hope this info is useful.

It could be a problem with the "fonts.dir" 
file or the "XftCache file". 
I published a copy of my esstix directory at This directory is installed on my box at /usr/local/share/fonts/esstix and there 
is a refenrece dir "/usr/local/share/fonts/esstix" in "/etc/X11/XftConfig" and catalogue = ..... /usr/local/share/fonts/esstix, in the file "/etc/X11/fs/config" 
This Motif version doesn't use truetype fonts and xft. 
Perhaps RedHat 9.0 uses a different font server and needs another configuration.

is 
and there 
"/etc/X11/fs/config" 
configuration. 
We believe Redhat 9 does use a newer version of the X font server but we have followed the new configuration guidelines, so we don't think the font server is causing the problem. 
We've also tried using the copy of your esstix directory, but the same problem remains with the Greek Letters palette. 
It would be nice if someone could verify a workable compilation under plain vanilla RedHat 9 with GTK support (with regard to the Greek Letters palette). 
We are currently using the Motif version as a workaround, bit it has minor incompatibilities e.g. with the clipboard for cut-and-paste. 
Thanks again for your help.
