In a training we made this week, a student ask a good question to us and we don't have THE answer so i ask you this one. 
Is there a rule about dynamic sessions (PHP, ASP ...) and time out of them ? 
a lot of blind people have problems with forms for example and sometines the timeout of a session is over before they finish. 
Do you have an idea about that ? 
thanks a lot yoan SIMONIAN ###########o0?Association BrailleNet ?0o

An example would be online banking, for instance, where - in my experience anyway - sessions can expire in a matter of only a minute of inactivity. 
However, I see your point about users with disabilities potentially requiring more time. 
I'm not sure how easily implementable it would be, but it may be an idea to offer users the option of specifying that they may require a longer time-out period. 
In a login-based system, this could be stored as an extra value with the user's information...once they log in, a new session is created and the timer set accordingly. 
Sorry if this reply was a bit vague. 
That's certainly a very interesting point (maybe stretching it, but could this be interpreted as a variation on guideline 7 http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10/#gl-movement ?) Patrick Patrick H. Lauke Webmaster / University of Salford The closest thing in WCAG 1 is checkpoint 7.4 - don't automatically refresh (i.e. change) pages if there is no way to block this. 
In the User Agent Accessibility Guidelines (which should be applied to dynamic sessions, since they are in effect a simple user interface, following WCAG priority 1 checkpoint 8.1 ) there is more: 2.4 ?Allow time-independent interaction (P1) 1. 
For rendered content where user input is only possible within a finite time interval controlled by the user agent, allow configuration to provide a view where user interaction is time-independent.

Nice idea but I'm not sure how easy that would be in reality. 
For instance we're building a PHP intranet for schools and have specified the session time out as 60 minutes. 
It would quite easy to allow site administrators to change this but it would be a global change to a config file and would affect all users who logged in. 
General concensus here is that the authentication mechanism wouldn't allow for differentiation acording to user ie you are either logged out and are "nobody" or you are logged in and are "somebody". 
Unfortunately my PHP skills aren't developed enough to give anymore of a definitive answer but if someone could crack it I would certainly implement it on this and future projects.

Ok, I'm not sure if this would work, but...here goes: how about setting the session time out quite high (1440 minutes) and then set a specific time out for the session cookie (see http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.session-set-cookie-params.php ) depending on whether the user requires more time or not ? 
There's probably a very fundamental flaw with this plan that I'm overlooking (e.g. what happens when cookies can't be set, and PHP dynamically adds the session ID to links etc), but maybe someone more knowledgeable than me could fill in the gaps ? 
Patrick Patrick H. Lauke Webmaster / University of Salford 60 minutes is already a fair bit of time. 
If you had a second config file, and a variable referring to the relevant file, a user could select the "more time" version (just the same, but using the other config). 
Approaching this like a multilingual site - where you autogenerate a mirror version with more time - might be easy. 
Depends on your setup. 
And remember that in some cases there are real world constraints - it is simply not possible to let someone have 90 minutes between noon and 1pm, however much that may impact on their life.

Unfortunately security considerations often conflict with accessibility. 
I can't see anyone doing that, except possibly after some manual vetting of the particular user. 
Otherwise, because people tend to configure for convenience, rather than security, a lot of people are likely to use the feature. 
There can also be more commercially based, but still real constraints. 
E.g. one cannot let someone hold a provisional ticket booking indefinitely, even though one needs to hold it long enough that the user doesn't find it has gone by the time they make their payment.
