this one says it is an internet kiosk. 
anyone know what's up with regard to its potential for accessibility? 
this conference features the product in question and it seems to be quite prevelant. 
Thanks!

Hi David, The Netshift Kiosk that's the subject of the Kiosk Conference you found is described at It runs on top of navigator or explorer, under windows 95 or NT, and has keyboard and mouse access (cf. 
http://www.netshift.com/faq-03.html ) There is no mention of speech output or any other accessibility issues. 
However, perhaps pwKiosk, which is Productivity Works' implementation of Trace's EZ Access, could be ported to the hardware (it adds a button via the USB port).

yes, but does it work with screenreaders? 
I've seen programs with keyboard and mouse support that do not.
