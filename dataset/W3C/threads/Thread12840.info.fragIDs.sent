<s> Does anyone know Kai Gradert?  </s>
<s> A Kai web authoring tool could enable learning difficulty creativity on the web.  </s>
<s> I've been an admirer of Kai products for a while.  </s>
<s> Superb interfaces, and InkLink is yet another.  </s>

<s> For something where you give it a name and it goes and finds you a list of links, I use the term "search engine".  </s>
<s> This is how I think of Google.  </s>
<s> For a site where I get a list of choices that leads to a list of choices that eventually leads to sites I use the term "portal".  </s>
<s> This is how I think of Yahoo (although Yahoo's site also included a search engine last time I looked).  </s>

<s> Search Engine strategy is key to any web site.  </s>
<s> You have two types of submission - Directories and Search Engines Directories are human-indexed and so the meta data is very important.  </s>
<s> You can input your data into these listings.  </s>
<s> Items like Category, site title, and site description.  </s>
<s> Yahoo! and Looksmart are the two most important directories.  </s>
<s> Search engines are computer indexed like google.  </s>
<s> All the major search engines have placement fees for registration and this will have you placed right away.  </s>
<s> In addition, here are some good links 1.Create your Meta Tags here 2. http://searchenginewatch.com/ 3. http://www.searchengineforums.com http://www.searchengineforums.com/  </s>
<s> I agree with Charles' distinction, but would also like to bring up a couple of related issues.  </s>
<s> If you'll recall the "Visualisation rather than text" thread back in October, Brian Kelly brought up a site called The WebBrain which provides sort of a hybrid between the search engine and portal.  </s>
<s> There's a new WebBrain 2.0 Beta that's just been announced this week, so the site should be revisited: Although I won't be able to attend CSUN this year, I will be going to Infonortics' Search Engine meeting in Boston April 8-10.  </s>
<s> Please visit their website, and contact me if you are planning to attend, or wants me to raise specific issues: Regarding WebBrain, I've been working with the Personal Brain product rather intensely for several months now, and it's helped me in contributing to some website redesign projects (the tool can spider an existing site and help you gather links by audience) as well as project/time management (I've developed a Brain where "Today" is the central thought).  </s>
<s> Since The Brain Technologies company is located in Santa Monica, next week's CSUN conference would be an ideal opportunity for some of you to meet with them in person and give some feedback on how The Brain products could be part of assistive technology solutions.  </s>
<s> In particular, I believe that: 1) The Brain could be especially helpful for visually-impaired to manage their bookmark/favorites 2) The Brain could be part of a solution for people with certain types and degrees of cognitive impairments, although individual thoughts would need to be associated with images/symbols and it would likely need to be integrated with some sort of calendaring program that bring up a reminder (launch a thought at a scheduled time or guide someone through a multi-step process).  </s>
<s> With its associative user interface, the Brain can be used to model the way a person thinks about and interacts with the world, and properly designed Brains may be able to significantly reduce the cognitive load of finding documents or links.  </s>
<s> The following paragraph are comments that the developer (Harlan Hugh) gave during an interview; for the complete article, visit Steve Johnson's "Tomorrow's Desktop" article at: http://www.feedmag.com/invent/interface.html  </s>
<s> "When I sit down at my computer (or anyone else's), I want to see a useful representation of everything inmy life.  </s>
<s> The fundamental difference is about focusing on the connections between information instead of the separations.  </s>
<s> All my information should be connected in a single interface?e-mail,  </s>
<s> Web content, contacts, documents, and everything.  </s>
<s> I don't want to use different tools for related information just because it's stored in a different place.  </s>
<s> For instance, the way we perceive email as being separate from other data is an artifact of building interfaces that expose too much of what's going on 'under the hood.' The interface should distinguish information based on its content and not its source.  </s>
<s> Taking this a step further, I'm looking forward to a world where the whole concept of 'e-mail'?a  </s>
<s> special mode of operation where everything is viewed based on discrete transactions?is  </s>
<s> replaced by a much more powerful way of viewing and sharing connected information in context.  </s>
<s> Your screen should not look like a bunch of pretty buttons that you use to order your computer from one task to the next.  </s>
<s> Instead it should be a dynamic representation and experience of everything that's important to you.  </s>
<s> I think The Brain demonstrates the beginnings of realizing this vision."  </s>
<s> Anyone who would like to work with me to help arrange a meeting for The Brain at CSUN is encouraged to reply.  </s>
<s> Thanks, Karl  </s>
<s> I'd be very keen to see a graphical version of The Brain, and endeavour to make a visit, if you'll go ahead.  </s>
<s> Small graphics load fast and the brain, reads them far faster than words, millions of years study.  </s>
<s> The topics have a relation to contents that words cannot emulate.  </s>
<s> You'll see graphics and recognise them far faster than you can name them here: please visit our directory/portal for adults with a learning difficulty: unfortunately our java drive thru with links has been down a while, it does continue to work offline, just cannot find the time to get it working online again..... jonathan chetwynd IT teacher (LD) j.chetwynd@btinternet.com  </s>
