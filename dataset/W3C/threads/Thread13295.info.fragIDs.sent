LK:: "3. testing javascript for accessibility: what are the common problems?

Do we have to examine the "output" of such objects or can they be analyzed in situ? 
Love. 
ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE 
I'm afraid I'm swamped and won't be able to be on. 
Which is too bad, I'm particularly interested in the 1st &amp; 3rd agenda items. 
A couple thoughts: I think we should come up with a way to express a page/site's accessibilty in RDF. 
On thinking about it, I don't think we should do it on a per-checkpoint basis - too long. 
A per-priority basis gets my vote (e.g., the equivalent of "this site passes all priority 1 checkpoints"). 
When generated by tools, we'll need to identify the tool so we know that only automatic support items are covered. 
Javascript - ideally, a tool should process the script so it knows exactly what's going on. 
This is particularly important because if a variable is declared to point to an object we're interested in (like the "window" object), we won't know that unless we are actually reading the script, not just scanning the text. 
If we were doing this, I think it would be theoretically possible to provide full support for all script-related checkpoints. 
As an interim, we can do a string search for common problem methods. 
If we see "write(..." we know content is being generated. 
If we see "location(..." we know the current or another window is being redirected. 
If we see "open(..." we know a new window is being created. 
If we see "submit(..." we know a form is being submitted (it's common to not provide submit buttons for forms that are submitted by Javascript). 
Etc.
