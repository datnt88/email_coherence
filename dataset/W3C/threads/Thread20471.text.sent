Hello: I'm a user who has downloaded Amaya to create my personal web page... 
I'm from Europe and I want to introduce euro-sign (?) and it's not possible in ISO-8859-1. 
I've tried to chenge the charset from Notepad and when I load the web page on Amaya it says XML is not well-formed... How can I get Amaya understand ISO-8859-15??? Thank you. 
Albert Oliver Serra Hello For the moment, Amaya doesn't understand ISO-8859-15. 
Concerning ISO Latin charsets, Amaya understand ISO-8859-1 up to ISO-8859-9. 
So, the best way to introduce the euro-sign is to use the external entity &amp;euro;. 
But Amaya doesn't use the exact glyph for that symbol. 
Laurent Carcone Amaya Team We're currently working on a unicode version of Amaya which will support a more large set of characters. 
Meanwhile you can let your document in ISO-8859-1 and use the entity &amp;euro;
