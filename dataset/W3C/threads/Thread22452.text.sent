Are up online, in case people hadn't noticed. 
The DOM WG would be most interested in hearing comments about the way the spec is now formatted, in addition to comments about the content. 
In particular: 1) How do people feel about having the spec bnroken up into multiple files? 
The WG acknowledges that the lack of contextual clues and next/previous/up buttons hinders usage. 
These will be added if people prefer multiple small pages. 
2) How do people feel about having the spec formatted as a book made up of multiple sub-specs? 
WOuld it be better to treat it as a single specification? 
Has anyone included package names for the Java APIs. 
I have failed to find them. 
Andrew n marshall student - artist - programmer "Everyone a mentor, Everyone a pupil" The package names should be org.w3c.dom. 
In a future release, we will make the full package available so you won't have to cut an paste. 
We're just knocking the bugs out of the conversion scripts. 
Is this true for the xml and html classes also? 
Andrew n marshall student - artist - programmer "Everyone a mentor, Everyone a pupil" I don't remember concensus being arrived at, but I think xml and html should be org.w3c.dom.xml and org.w3c.dom.html
