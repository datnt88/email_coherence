Al As is the fact that "access" is not to be found in the main body of the document. 
I guess it's enough to describe how to prepare XML stuff but doesn't matter how to access it.

Well, I think it would be a good idea to write to the authors and suggest that they consider including accessibility considerations. 
In particular, they might help us thinking about the different circumstances when a format should or should not be considered 'final form'.
