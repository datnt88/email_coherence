<s> Here's what I've come up with for the 4.X stuff: 1.  </s>
<s> I've changed the checkpoint to make it more similar to others in GL4. 2. I've added a new sentence to the rationale from Karen's email (marked by **) 3. I've added a potential success criteria.  </s>
<s> 4.X Ensure that *accessibility prompting, checking, repair functions and documentation* are integrated into the overall workflow when an author develops Web Content.  </s>
<s> (Priority 2) RATIONALE: Accessible design as an afterthought or separate process is much more onerous and therefore costly than when accessibility is considered from the start.  </s>
<s> *Experienced authors develop workflows, familiar and consistently successful routines, with their authoring tools.*  </s>
<s> If the authoring tool supports a workflow in which the author considers accessibility before and/or during the authoring process it is more likely that accessible authoring practices will become a common practice.  </s>
<s> SUCCESS CRITERIA * If the user begins a Web content editing session, performs edits that introduce accessibility problems, saves and then exits an editing session, the tool must have, at some point, intervened in a reasonably obvious way with one or more accessibility prompting, checking, repair or documentation features relevant to those accessibility problem.  </s>
<s> I realize that the success criteria is a bit spartan.  </s>
<s> However, the range of conceivable workflows for all the different types of tools and operations that might be performed with them is very large.  </s>
<s> Moreover, we are quite clear about the need for user configurability, which complicates the situation.  </s>
<s> Thoughts on any of this?  </s>

<s> For success criteria, "at some point -during the editing session-" (add last part)?  </s>
<s> Also is there any way to quantify "reasonably obvious way"?  </s>
<s> Term seems somewhat subjective.  </s>
<s> Great job!  </s>

<s> Hi Tim, I made your changes.  </s>
<s> Does "presented" work?  </s>
<s> I suppose it will need to be defined.  </s>
<s> Here is how it reads: If the user begins a Web content editing session, performs edits that introduce accessibility problems, saves and then exits an editing session, then the tool must have, at some point during the editing session, PRESENTED the user with relevant prompting, checking, repair or documentation features.  </s>
