One of the things I would like to see appear in the Overview html file are some examples of what goes into the new tags config parameter. 
There are now these three parameters: new-empty-tags: new-inline-tags: new-blocklevel-tags: What would be examples of each of these?

Cold Fusion tags spring to mind. 
However, I will add some MathML tags as examples for the next release.

Even a single example of each of the categories, showing when one would use one of the options over the other, would be sufficient.
