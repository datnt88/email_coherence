Dear sir or madam, I would encourage you to facilitate all texts relating to this new exciting initiative also in HTML format. 
Presently they can only be downloaded as PDF and this takes more than ten times longer than the equivalent HTML files. 
Not only so. 
PDF files do not allow to copy the text easily for citing in another documents and the users need an especific plugin to render them in their computers. 
More importantly, this format is not accessible for people with disabilities that can not use standards graphical browsers, like blind people. 
This would be hence a good way to start implementing what is intended as priority area 7, which is eParticipation of the disabled in the information society.

ACCESO | Universitat de Valencia (Spain) | C/ Artes Gr?ficas 13, 46010 Valencia | Dear Steven, Thank you for your comments. 
I understand what you mean. 
I was just trying to simplify my statements so they could be as easily understandable as possible, and, I admit it, trying also to get the maximum impact in very few words. 
There are many more aspects in accessibility than just the ones related to blindness, but I think it is better to start with basics when you don't know the background of your possible public. 
Regards, Rafael. 
Rafael, I applaud your eforts in raising the issue of accessibility to PDF and actually writing a letter to the appropriate people. 
However, one of your statements is an incorrect generalization. 
"...can not use standards graphical browsers, like blind people. 
this is true ins some cases but not all. 
I am totally blind and use a graphical browser, as do many blind people. 
Even though I can and do use a graphical browser(IE 4.01), PDF is not generally accessible. 
The browser per se may not be the issue, the fact that PDF is a graphical format is the issue. 
Perhaps this is what you meant? 
Without the appropriate software to "view" the PDF file, even a sighted person cannot access it,, so the barriers PDF present fall under the broader category of denying access to those without the appropriate software, assistive or not. 
Even though there are freely available conversion services from Adobe, it is my experience that the ywork well only when the PDF document is very simple. 
That is, documents without embedded pictures, charts, graphs, or even footnotes, ( anything that might interrupt the linear flow of text).

ACCESO | Universitat de Valencia (Spain) | C/ Artes Gr?ficas 13, 46010 Valencia | It also depends what country you are in, or more particularly what languages you understand - translating software to different languages happnes at different rates, and can sometimes take a long time or never happen, so in some languages people are much more restricted in available software than english speakers. 
Even in dealing with an english-language document this can be a problem - I use an english-language system (although I can sety my browser, Amaya, to run in french, italian, german or partial czech instead) but I often try to read documents in Spanish or French. 
If my native language was something else, I may be stuck.

Regarding your statement about the adobe conversion services it may also be a result of the method of conversion into pdf. 
There are three methods available. 
One may convert as all text, all images or a combination of the two.

| Unidad de Investigacion ACCESO | | Universitat de Valencia (Spain) | | C/ Artes Graficas 13, 46010 Valencia | Hello from Denmark I think Charles rises a very important issue about the languages and the localization/translation into "small" languages like Danish. 
Where for instance JAWS is the only screenreader software that is translated and we still await the version 3.31. 
This means that all software is delayed and we can't always be sure that we get all the facilities as in the original version, some times we have to wait for a new release to get everything fixed and sometimes we can't use other applications because words have been changed ( I remember once where some OCR software could not be used because the word "files" had been translated into Danish "filer" so the two applications didn't correspond). 
I'm a member of the EOWG and here we have discussed this issue in order to make the work of WAI more internationally relevant. 
I think we have to take the problems about different language versions into the guidelines. 
For instance in Denmark we have few applications to chose between when it comes to assistive technology and we may not be able to use all the techniques mentioned in the guidelines (e.g. tables). 
I think the suggestions about setting up a list where one can see version no. and any other relevant information for software, applications, OS etc. in different languages is very good or maybe we could add language information to the lists with e.g. browsers and authoring tools.
