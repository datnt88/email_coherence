Dear Tobi: 
Thank you for you comments on the F&amp;O documents on May 2, 2003. 
The 
F&amp;O taskforce discussed your comments on the 5/29 telcon and concluded that there was insufficient motivation for adding another function to test for value equality of nodes in addition to vendee-equal. 
We agree 
that other definitions for value equality of nodes are possible but there is not another single definition which obviously needs to be added to the document. 
Also, users can write functions for the flavor of node equality they desire. 
Please let us know whether you agree with this response. 
All the best, Ashok Malhotra on behalf of the F&amp;O taskforce 
Hi Ashok, hi F&amp;O taskforce 
Thank you very much for your reply, and for having discussed the issue. 
(more below) I really appreciate the fact that XSLT and related WGs are quite communicative. 
Which function are you referring to with "vendee-equal"? 
I guess you mean that there will be no fn:node-equal()? 
I can live with it :) 
I hope that an initiative like EXSLT will design and specify a comprehensive library of useful functions for XSLT 2, which can be implemented natively by XSLT processors (not written in XSLT, but in the language the processor is written in, eg C++ or Java).

P.S. (sorry for quoting myself) 
... if the W3C doesn't. 
If still hope that the W3C will (continue to) design, grow, and specify a comprehensive standard library, required for conformance for all implementations or only for a specific category of implementations (the latter would be acceptable for me). 
Initiatives like EXSLT then can provide additional facilities, which might be regarded by some as less general or less widely applicable, or which are prototypes of candidates for future versions of XSLT and related languages.
