What do we consider to be the scope of "RDF core"? 
I think that RDF core consists of the bare RDF language, RDF vocabulary and RDFS vocabulary, with corresponding entailments and intended interpretations. 
I.e. the scope of this working group. 
Any dissent?

I'm not sure why you are asking this question? 
If you you need to take this to the WG it should go on the comments list. 
FWIW, I'm not sure why we need this term. 
I've looked at a few cases where 
its been used in comments and it seemed one could avoid using it entirely. 
I wonder also whether we need to check for consistent use across documents. 
Which documents contain the term, other than to refer to the WG? Brian 
Well it was, I thought, an editorial issue which in no way changes the meaning of RDF as described, but a terminological issue that I don't recall we've discussed. 
As such, I thought a quick check with the WG to see if we all had the same understanding was a quick and easy question. 
I guess we don't. 
I'll plan on editorializing it out.

My preference would be to drop the term.

But, my dear fellow, surely we ARE the RDF core.

Does this mean it's time to charter an RDF periphery working group?
