<s> I presume he means the non-standard HTTP header Refresh:, rather than a button to do If-Modified-Since and/or Cache-Control: no-cache requests.  </s>

<s> Although not insurmountable, Lynx has the advantage that it is text only, but you can actually use Refresh: on other media types, even though most people actually use it as a meta header (usually on servers that don't understand meta elements!), often because they don't know how to generate 30x HTTP responses, or because their ISP won't allow them that level of control.  </s>
<s> If Amaya generates a pseudo link, it will need to wrap images, etc. in a virtual web page.  </s>
