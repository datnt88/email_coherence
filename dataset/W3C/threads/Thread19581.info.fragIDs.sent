Does Amaya support client side refreshes?

I presume he means the non-standard HTTP header Refresh:, rather than a button to do If-Modified-Since and/or Cache-Control: no-cache requests.

Hello, We don't support the Refresh: header in the current Amaya. 
As many sites (e.g., Microsoft's one), tend to use it, we may support it in a future version.

Supporting it the way Lynx does would be nice. 
It shows you what the refresh wants to do, and leaves it as a link.

Although not insurmountable, Lynx has the advantage that it is text only, but you can actually use Refresh: on other media types, even though most people actually use it as a meta header (usually on servers that don't understand meta elements!), often because they don't know how to generate 30x HTTP responses, or because their ISP won't allow them that level of control. 
If Amaya generates a pseudo link, it will need to wrap images, etc. in a virtual web page.
