This is a valid HTML file. 
This is an invalid HTML file after Amaya saved it. 
Why is Amaya removeing the &amp;amp; from S&amp;amp;A? 
Jim FitzSimons The file with S&amp;A is not valid. 
The file with S&amp;amp;A is valid. 
The browsers render S&amp;amp;A as S&amp;A. 
What is correct? 
Is the W3C check program incorrect? 
Are all the browsers incorrect? 
Jim FitzSimons The instance that the &amp;amp occurs is within the alt=" " attribute. 
The value of the attribute, which is text, is not parsed by the browser and as such, &amp;amp; would be rendered as '&amp;amp;' not as an '&amp;'. 
From the HTML 4.0 Spec: alt %Text; #REQUIRED -- short description -- Entities are interpreted in CDATA, so must be interpreted in ALT. 
This is the sort of area where the lazy parsers in most GUI browsers are likely to fail to follow the SGML rules properly. 
Entities in href is another problem area with such implementations. 
Amaya, Lynx, Netscape (4.05) and IE4 (4.01) display this correctly, but Amaya seems to fail to encode when it saves (v1.3 Win32).

Netscape (4.05 and 4.5) really trash the files when they save them. 
Here is an example of Netscape 4.5 saving the same file: Jim FitzSimons In-reply-to: Your message of Wed, 02 Dec 1998 17:22:04 -0700." 
You're right. 
This is a bug. 
It'll be fixed in next release. 
Regards Irene. 
Bug fixed. 
In the next release, Amaya will encode entities in attributes. 
An '&amp;' in an ALT attribute will be saved as '&amp;amp;' Vincent.
