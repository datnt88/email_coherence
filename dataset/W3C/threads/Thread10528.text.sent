Error reports: 9: Doc Publishing - script for cross references 10: heads up re TAG rdfURIMeaning-39 and public-sw-meaning See: 11: xmlsch-02 I think this means that we should be regarding Dave's comment as currently unaddressed, since there has been no formal resolution to decline the comment. 
Status of this comment See: 12: Datatype subclasses See: 13: I18N Comments Status 14: Outstanding comments pfps on normalization pfps comment on sectin 6.4 of concepts pfps on semantics 15: next steps This agenda was produced by Jema, the Jena WG assistant, running on Jena 2 Could someone please provide a pointer to the actual comment... Thanks, Patrick Dave Reynold's original comment: PositiveEntailmentTest xmlsch-02/Manifest.rdf#whitespace-facet-3 - FAIL This tests bNode introduction - that a typed literal entails a graph with a bNode of type rdf:Literal. 
We have deliberately omitted the bNode introduction rules from the reasoner config on the grounds that this is not the way an RDF API should do it - users can query the nodes themselves for type information and creating virtual triples for this would be wrong from an API perspective. 
** Failures - could fix: NegativeEntailmentTest xmlsch-02/Manifest.rdf#whitespace-facet-2 - FAIL NegativeEntailmentTest xmlsch-02/Manifest.rdf#whitespace-facet-1 - FAIL These test non-mutual entailment of a valid literal with an invalid literal that differs only by whitespace. 
Unfortunately our XSD handling library is happy with the whitespace and doesn't treat " 3 " as an invalid int. 
This could be fixed if that is indeed how XSD is supposed to work, though the current behaviour seems more useful in practice. 
Thanks.
