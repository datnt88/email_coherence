1. Placeholders discussed in checkpoints for Guideline 3 should be added to the list of enabled element defintion 2. It seems the current priority 3 checkpoint 2.8 can be satisfied by the Priority 2 checkpoint 2.7, since 2.8 points back to the features of 2.7 as a solution. 
I don't think this was the indention of 2.8. 
a. 2.8 was originally only about images and I am not sure the general conditional content substitution works for this checkpoint with any known results. 
b. Proposed new checkpoint 2.8: 2.8 Allow configuration so that when the author has intentionally provided empty conditional content (alt="") for an image element, the user agent does not render the image (i.e. CSS display property of the image is set to "none").

WWW: http://www.w3.org/wai/ua Reference document: Ok. Checkpoint 2.7 says "generate repair text" Checkpoint 2.8 says "don't generate the repair text of 2.7 unless I tell you" I don't know why this is specific to images. 
Suppose the user provides an auditory track and no synchronized text equivalent, but the user agent can determine that some other html page is a transcript of the track. 
Then it might give the user access to that transcript (this is a little bit of a stretch, but not much). 
I don't think that 2.8 should be limited to images. 
I do think that we should fix the wording of 2.8 to avoid "author intentionally". 
So we should change "when the author has intentionally provided empty conditional content' to "when the user agent recognizes that the author has failed to provide conditional content that was frequired by the ormat specification." 
(In other words, reuse the language of 2.7).

This is to try to minimize the number of empty image placeholders on a page. 
I am concerned about having an open ended requirement to a checkpoint that was originally pretty narrow in scope and would be moved further away from the original intent with your proposed change.

WWW: http://www.w3.org/wai/ua [snip] My mistake: 2.8 is not about "author has failed to provide" but rather "author has intentionally provided empty conditional content". 
That's what distinguishes 2.8 from 2.7.
