<s> I just found a typo in the IANA charset file at Instead of Alais: csEBCDICPT it should read Alias: csEBCDICPT Can this please be corrected?  </s>
<s> The file also contained some spurious spaces, and used sometimes "Alias: None" and sometimes just "Alias:" to indicate the absence of aliases.  </s>
<s> Maybe that can be corrected, too.  </s>
<s> I'm willing to help.  </s>
<s> Many thanks and kind regards, Martin.  </s>
<s> P.S.: Did I send this to (all) the right list(s)?  </s>
<s> Is there any review necessary, or can this be done asap?  </s>
<s> Should be easy to fix, but probably not the highest priority.  </s>
<s> Not controversial.  </s>
<s> Thanks!  </s>
<s> (My guess - you are writing scripts that use the information....?)  </s>
<s> Yes, good guess.  </s>
<s> Regards, Martin.  </s>
