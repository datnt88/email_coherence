<s> As I prepared my IETF trip report, I found the following remarks from the previous (San Jose) meeting: (In a private conversation I had with Jim Gettys, W3C, I learned that Netscape's earlier objections to Digest have been resolved, although it appears to me that the current draft does not include the changes that would make them happy.  </s>
<s> In any case, apparently future Netscape browsers will support Digest.) Supposedly Netscape was going to propose changes to address their concerns, but I have seen no such proposals.  </s>

<s> I believe that Basic authentication falls in this category.  </s>
<s> I'd like to extend the question to other browser vendors.  </s>
<s> Project GNU doesn't exactly count as a `vendor'; nor am I really an official representive.  </s>
<s> However, we internally use very little security, and 99.9% of the time that works fine.  </s>
<s> The fact that my passwords get sent cleartext across the net doesn't really bother me.  </s>
<s> It's true that I wouldn't send credit card information cleartext; but most information I have stored in my accounts isn't really that important to me.  </s>
<s> I'm not paranoid about protecting it anyway.  </s>
<s> As a practical matter, it's a huge inconvinience to me when I'm not root.  </s>
<s> Many other contributors to GNU feel that way, and I think that has something to with our decisions to configure our machines in a less than paranoid way.  </s>
<s> GNU doesn't really have any competiors per se.  </s>
<s> It's true that the NetBSD people tend to reimplement everything GNU does in order to remove restrictions related to proprietary derivatives; and it's true that those who write proprietary software are competitors in a way.  </s>
<s> But I would be quite happy if Netscape or Microsoft decided to use some of the code from E-scape, as long as they follow the conditions of the GNU General Public License.  </s>
<s> Another thing: I hate firewalls.  </s>
<s> It's ridiculous spending hours to get a workstation to print, just because the printer is behind a firewall, and the workstation is outside.  </s>
<s> Especially when there aren't any other machines running any IP server software behind that firewall.  </s>
<s> However, having said that, if someone adds additional capabilities to my browser, and it's clear that there are no legal problems, I'll be happy to merge password encryption code.  </s>
<s> (And it will only take one competent user living in the right country to get those capabilities.)  </s>
<s> However, much as the basic authentication scheme has problems, doesn't SSL solve all those problems?  </s>
<s> Except that SSL is rather heavy weight performance wise and hence may be overkill where the real objective is reasonably reliable identification of a user w/o compromising their password data.  </s>
<s> And frankly, hearing your security philosophy raises concerns about hidden virus being added to complex software many many folks use from the GNU project.  </s>
<s> But that is clearly offtopic for this list.  </s>

<s> Except that SSL is rather heavy weight performance wise and hence may be overkill where the real objective is reasonably reliable identification of a user w/o compromising their password data.  </s>
<s> I still don't quite see this.  </s>
<s> Because if I can watch someone's packets fly across a network segment, can't I take over their connection after it has been established?  </s>
<s> Obviously, for me to read the password, I have to know what I'm doing.  </s>
<s> So hijacking a connection would not be much harder.  </s>
<s> (Especially  </s>
<s> considering I've seen proprietary software that makes taking over a connection extremely easy.)  </s>
<s> And if I were an end user, I'd think that the network connection had just died because of a glitch.  </s>
<s> And frankly, hearing your security philosophy raises concerns about hidden virus being added to complex software many many folks use from the GNU project.  </s>
<s> But that is clearly offtopic for this list.  </s>
<s> If some sort of virus or trojan horse were added to the sources, I'm sure we'd notice.  </s>
<s> I don't want to document all the techniques that are likely to work for us to notice things, because that WOULD reduce security.  </s>
<s> If it's a virus that works by modifying the executable, and source is never distributed for that virus, then standard GNU packages on prep.ai.mit.edu are immune; FSF generally doesn't distribute binaries.  </s>
<s> rom what I've seen, most UN*X trojan horses seem to be distributed as binaries.  </s>
<s> So I generally get the source for the programs I use, and compile them myself.  </s>
<s> Admittedly, that approach looks at the way human nature works, more than trying to make sure I have a bulletproof solution.  </s>
<s> But I should also add that I've seen about two weeks worth of changes to files destroyed, and that didn't change my view on security.  </s>
<s> (But I think we started making better backups after that lossage.) Anyway, as I understand it, Microsoft Internet Explorer has some security problem that allows deleting files; and Java did too at one point.  </s>
<s> So imprefect security is not a unique problem.  </s>

<s> With Digest Authentication, hijacking a connection will not allow you to make subsequent requests over that connection (of different URLs) without knowledge of the shared secret (aka password).  </s>
<s> There's an MD5 hash of the URL, the password, and some other data.  </s>

<s> "The problem with political jokes is that they get elected."  </s>
<s> Please, SSL has nothing to do with Digest Authentication.  </s>
<s> It is not a replacement unless you believe that every password protected page should also be encrypted.  </s>
<s> The purpose of Digest is to allow people to stop using BASIC as soon as possible.  </s>
<s> Nothing else.  </s>
<s> SSL essentially defines a new protocol and a pretty complex one at that.  </s>
<s> SSL unfortunately provides a relatively weak form of security.  </s>
<s> It is great if your definition of security is the use of cryptography.  </s>
<s> It has no real model of how it should interact with firewalls for example - nobody sends encrypted data through the firewalls I have experience with, that is part of their purpose.  </s>
<s> Nor can data from an SSL transaction be cached by an intermediary.  </s>
<s> Phill  </s>
<s> SSL does allow a null-cipher -- in Netscape Servers it's enabled via choice "No encryption, only MD5 message authentication".  </s>
<s> This provides certificate based authentication and message integrity on HTTP data, but the data is not encrypted, so there's minimal overhead.  </s>

<s> This AL provides certificate based authentication and message integrity on AL HTTP data, but the data is not encrypted, so there's minimal overhead.  </s>
<s> It is not nearly as minimal as 2069 - in order use even a null cipher, I must be able to process a certificate.  </s>
<s> For a good many systems, this is too costly (in code to do public key certificate handling, and licensing of that technology) and not justified by the product requirements.  </s>
<s> I don't want to do RSA code in an ethernet repeater or a web coffeepot (and only one of those is a frivolous example).  </s>
<s> Certificate based security is wonderfull, and I fully support its wide use in the Internet and incorporation into all sorts of standards, but it is _not_ a replacement for simpler schemes which have different requirements.  </s>
