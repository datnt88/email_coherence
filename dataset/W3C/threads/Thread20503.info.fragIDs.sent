<s> Hi, I have a layout test page at: It is validated XHTML 1.1 + CSS, and displays almost identically in O6 and IE6, but Amaya makes it very different.  </s>
<s> , but it works very poorly CSS-wise in Amaya, which doesn't seem to take into account: - float - text-align - color - most (but not all) of the border properties - font-family Also, a:hover doesn't work, but this is a known limitation, so I don't mind it.  </s>
<s> I thought CSS support was much better than this exhibits.  </s>
<s> Is there anything wrong although the document validates as indicated, and could I improve its appearance in Amaya, the most important issue being the "float: right" behaviour ?  </s>
<s> Yes we know that limitation.  </s>
<s> In many languages the apostrophe is a separator and could not handled as part of the word.  </s>
<s> In any case the English dictionary doesn't include all words like cat's, dog's, you've etc.  </s>
<s> One solution could be to accept words ll, ve, and isn.  </s>
<s> Hum that's not TRUE.  </s>
<s> The p element line 51 is not closed and that makes your xhtml document not well formed.  </s>
<s> Fixing this error will change the rendering.  </s>
<s> Unfortunately Amaya does not yet implement either float propoerties or the deprecated align attribute of HTML.  </s>
<s> However, this might be closer - the CVS record shows that Amaya has recently added support for the block and inline display properties.  </s>
