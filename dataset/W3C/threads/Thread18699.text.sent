Hi, Firstly congratulations on UAAG 1.0 it looks great, I've got no criticisms of it. 
I just have a question about 2.3 - Render Conditional Content. 
In SVG, there are the foriegnObject, and metadata elements, both of which allow content to be included with pretty much any semantics at all. 
So does 2.3 require that a SVG User Agent, render conditional content included in a foreignObject or in Metadata elements, that it doesn't know the semantics of (and so how to render sensibly.) 
For example, http://jibbering.com/2002/8/static.svg is a simple SVG file, containing just a raster image, with a title and description, and a metadata element which describes the image in some detail, however it's using my own semantics so we can't really expect another user agent to be able to use it( http://jibbering.com/2002/8/img-desc.svg is what I do with it.) The same with foreignObject in SVG, are you expecting that an SVG UA should render the XHTML or PDF, or whatever representation that is included via foriegnObject (but not normally displayed due to switch.) ? 
Jim. 
Thanks Jim! Conditional content is defined by specification. 
For the most part, UAAG 1.0 says "if you recognize it and it's part of a claim, you are responsible for it." 
In some cases (e.g., blinking text, image control), UAAG 1.0 says "if you recognize it and even if it's not part of a claim, you are responsible for it." 
If the content of the foreignObject is defined by specification S, and S says that it's conditional content, and the user agent implements S, then the user agent is responsible for making it available. 
The "user agent" may include a plug-in specifically for this rendering. 
Otherwise, if the user agent does not implement S or does not recognize the content as being conditional, it's not responsible for knowing that it's conditional content. 
Per checkpoint 2.1, the user agent is responsible for following specifications for rendering, so if the content is xml and has associated style sheets, and the user agent implements xml+style sheets, then the user agent is again responsible for proper handling. 
Where do you define your own semantics? 
No, the user agent is not responsible for rendering all formats. 
You can define your user agent to encompass as many formats as you wish: if your user agent consists of an SVG agent and a PDF agent, then it's responsible for both. 
Otherwise, you can claim conformance for the SVG part alone. 
Please let me know whether this is clear enough, - Ian Ian Jacobs (ij@w3.org)

My concern was that SVG defines the content of switch as conditional content, and therefore when the foreignObject is in a switch element it is conditional content and therefore a UA would have to render it (even though it doesn't know anything about HTML, or MathML or whatever) ie 23.4 in http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/extend.html which defines conditional content of a foreignObject containing some HTML, and some SVG text, the UA can safely ignore the HTML portion if it doesn't understand HTML? 
Jim. 
In 23.4, the SVG spec says: "It is not required that SVG user agent support the ability to invoke other arbitrary user agents to handle embedded foreign object types;" UAAG 1.0 doesn't require it either. 
UAAG 1.0 doesn't require that a user agent support any particular content format. 
You (or UAAG 1.0) can't hold the user agent responsible for formats it doesn't recognize. 
If the user agent implements HTML, then you can choose whether to make a claim about support for it. 
UAAG 1.0 section 3.1.2 
[1] states that a conformance profile must include the following: "Information about one or more specifications (e.g., markup languages, style sheet languages, APIs, etc.) implemented to satisfy the requirements of this document. 
A user agent must satisfy the requirements identified by the profile for at least these specifications. 
A user agent is not required to satisfy the identified requirements for other implemented specifications except when a content type label definition states otherwise." 
Thus, it is possible to claim conformance for an SVG agent and to not claim conformance for embedded content in other formats.
