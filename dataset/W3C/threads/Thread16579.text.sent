Has anyone seen third-party reviews of Windows 2000 for its accessibility features and for its compatibility with existing assistive technology products? 
Thank you. 
Bruce, I know Microsoft isn't third-party, but you might check out the Win2K section on our Accessibility site -- http://microsoft.com/enable/products/windows2000/default.htm . 
Also see our catalog of third-party accessibility aids -- http://www.microsoft.com/enable/products/aids.htm . 
The latter is maintained by the vendors themselves, and many include information on whether their product works with Win2K.

Thank you. 
Hi, I would like to know if a listing of the devices that support aural CSS exists. 
I have tried it with 5 Explorer and Jaws, and don't work although the page validates in W3C CSS validator. 
Thanks in advance, Ricardo S?nchez EMACS for UNIX partially supports aural style sheets. 
You will find a link to this and other browsers on the following page: Marie-Claire Guindon Dear Dick and Group, Yes, Microsoft has apparently done wonders with Win2K, and yes, I???ve read all I can from the Microsoft site. 
And yes, Microsoft???s take on it is pretty much the antithesis of third party. 
The news is all so good I can???t help but wonder what the catch is! 
We???ve got Win2K in the office, but I haven???t had the chance to play with it much. 
Let me ask you my two tough questions: Of the software products listed in your ...aids.htm 
resource, less than half are listed as being Win2K compatible. 
(And this is Microsoft???s database mind you. 
Many of the listed compatible products are VERY obscure -- even for someone who has been in the AT business for over ten years.) How quickly do you see this changing? 
What is Microsoft doing to help? 
Try to be realistic, keep in mind that the AT hardware manufactures have been extremely slow to adopt USB -- despite the obvious benefits for companies that specialize in alternative keyboards and mice. 
(In all fairness to Microsoft, a number of excellent packages are already Win2K compatible, so I am optimistic the everyone who wants to upgrade has that option.) Aside from JAWS, are there any screen readers available (from companies I am likely to have heard from)? 
Again, JAWS is a terrific product, I am just trying to get a sense if consumers with disabilities really have many product choices. 
How good is the built-in voice Narrator? 
Does Microsoft believe that it is sufficient for someone who is blind but with, perhaps, modest expectations? 
What Microsoft brand products does Narrator provide full access to?

Bruce, Is this the only list you are on? 
This is a worthy conversation, but seem more appropriate for uaccess or something. 
Just my 2 cents.
