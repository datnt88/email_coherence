<s> I'm not the one qualified to answer this kind of question, but it had something to do with most real-world rdf databases treating rdf properties in a special way.  </s>
<s> Subclassing rdf:Property would then cause them to act in strange ways.  </s>
<s> But why is this necessary?  </s>
<s> It looks cool in n3 (:someone :fails :wcag) but in practice, nobody writes n3.  </s>
<s> None of the existing earl implementations make use of it, and the use of the rdf subject, predicate, object terms just make the earl more opaque for beginners, and (as the rdf experts pointed out) confusing for rdf database/query tools.  </s>
<s> I think it was danbri that pointed out that while the kind of statement you want to make is useful, does it really belong in the main spec?  </s>
<s> We can just as easily write a separate rules file with the renamed predicates that does what you want, should someone want to explicitly use that kind of triple.  </s>
<s> And lastly, what are the outcomes of de-reifying that particular triple?  </s>
<s> Each of the objects is actually a collection of properties, and danbri and nmg seemed to have worrisome observations about non-unique properties of the implicit statement also getting de-reified and it turning into a mess.  </s>
<s> Anyways, the basic proposal is just to change the names of the predicates.  </s>
<s> This placates the people who are afraid of rdf as well as the experts who object to the current names on a philosophical basis.  </s>
<s> And as Chaals says, using earl names makes the structure of earl much clearer from the spec.  </s>
<s> Write all the daml properties you want separately should you want to use that form internally.  </s>
