unmuddled, my point is 1) a document is not flat 
2) iterators are trail through a specific projection of a document at a specific time by an individual. 
So the iteration over sets could be separated from projecting a document in time. 
Does this help, or do I stop now?

Point (2) is the one under contention. 
First, we aren't dealing with iterators per se (unlike past versions, or so I understand). 
Second, not all iterators operate upon a snapshot of the data (which seems to be what you're suggesting); those that don't face the same issues I've been concerned about. 
a XML document is not only flat but its a thin line, a character wide. 
DOM is a projection of that thin line into a two dimensional structure, specifically a tree. 
an iterator over a structure is like cockroach roaming about a house while an iterator over a result is like a dungbeetle crawling around a manure truck. 
a house is made for living while a truck is not. 
i agree that the cockroach and the dungbeetle are two different animal. 
Please continue. 
Its just starting to get fun.
