<s> unmuddled, my point is 1) a document is not flat  </s>
<s> 2) iterators are trail through a specific projection of a document at a specific time by an individual.  </s>
<s> So the iteration over sets could be separated from projecting a document in time.  </s>
<s> Does this help, or do I stop now?  </s>

<s> Point (2) is the one under contention.  </s>
<s> First, we aren't dealing with iterators per se (unlike past versions, or so I understand).  </s>
<s> Second, not all iterators operate upon a snapshot of the data (which seems to be what you're suggesting); those that don't face the same issues I've been concerned about.  </s>
<s> a XML document is not only flat but its a thin line, a character wide.  </s>
<s> DOM is a projection of that thin line into a two dimensional structure, specifically a tree.  </s>
<s> an iterator over a structure is like cockroach roaming about a house while an iterator over a result is like a dungbeetle crawling around a manure truck.  </s>
<s> a house is made for living while a truck is not.  </s>
<s> i agree that the cockroach and the dungbeetle are two different animal.  </s>
