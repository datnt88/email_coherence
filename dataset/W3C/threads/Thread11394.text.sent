That is not much of a reason. 
XML is not SGML, except very superficially. 
XML *is* SGML. 
The spec explicitly lists as one of the design goals: XML shall be compatible with SGML. 
This has been a goal of the XML effort from the very beginning. 
It is a goal that has had an enormous impact on the design of XML and it is a goal that has been achieved: all XML documents are conforming SGML documents (or will be in a couple of months once the SGML TC passes). 
James That is not much of a reason. 
XML is not SGML, except very superficially. 
This is ironic. 
The goal was to have *existing SGML software* read XML documents, not to make XML SGML-compatible co?te que co?te. 
I know about the TC. 
It fixes some problems with SGML but it is a band-aid. 
Useful for some people, no doubt, but irrelevant for XML.

2004 Rt des Lucioles / BP 93 SGML is about to undergo a full revision. 
Anything that you feel is wrong with it should be addressed to ISO through your country's representative or perhaps through a special W3C liason. 
Then all SGML-based information systems will benefit from your ideas, rather than just the Web. 
Paul Prescod Maybe I should. 
But my time is limited and I have too much work already, My apologies. 
I hope there are enough other people interested in SGML to do the review.

2004 Rt des Lucioles / BP 93 Cold but so: most of them are here trying to create an SGML compatible with a design created by people who didn't have enough time or experience to do it right the first time.
