I'm having trouble matching up what Eliot and Steve are saying about BOS with what I know from the 1992 version of 10744, section 6.2.4.2. 
In part: A bounded object set can be determined authomatically by the HT engine by constructing an "entity tree", starting with the SGML doc entity of the hub doc as the root. 
The entity tree includes external entities declared in the hub doc, then external entities declared in those entities, and so on. 
... A limit can be placed on the depth of the entity tree by the "bounding level" att of the hub document. 
... Does this not mean that every external entity declared in the hub doc (and every external entity in those entities) is part of the BOS? 
And 
might it not be the case that I declare as entities in my hub doc certain public text (part of the US Constitution, for example) that are not part of my copyrighted intellectual property? 
(I might declare them for the use of links that refer or traverse to them, rather than for transclusion.) 
The bounding level att works only when my work happens to end at the same level throughout, so appears not to be a solution. 
So isn't BOS applicable to the problem of defining the extent of my intellectual property/literary work only if I can contrive not to declare as external entities anything that doesn't belong to the work?

Yes and yes. 
The BOS is orthogonal to any notion of transclusion or any other semantic that might be associated with a particular link. 
To fix this problem, we've given you a way to explicitly include in the BOS entities that might therwise be excluded. 
This is intended primarily to let you include things like graphics that are semantically part of a document when they would otherwise be excluded from the BOS. 
You can also explicitly *exclude* entities. 
I think you're right. 
I think I would prefer to have an application specific "stuff that I own" document whose semantic is to define the scope of my intellectual work. 
This document could be used as a hub document (and thus would define a BOS), but wouldn't necessarily depend on the BOS facility of HyTime to convey the semantics of ownership. 
It would also be a natural place to apply access policies.

Yeah, this didn't work. 
The HyTime Technical Corrigendum does it differently. 
In the TC, there is a common data attribute that optionally appears on each entity declaration which separately declares for that entity how deeply to recurse. 
There are a couple of other features, too. 
No. I'm embarrassed that I was so unclear. 
I was not proposing that the BOS represents a set of intellectual property. 
I was proposing that an ilink (now "hylink" in HyTime) be used to express the fact that document A contains the intellectual property notices that govern documents B, C, and D. The hylink can be in document A, B, C, D, or E. Whatever document the hylink is in must be guaranteed to be in the BOS, or the application won't know about it and therefore can't display the legal notices. 
(That's where the BOS notion comes in.) I was also saying that any document which contains a link that is used to traverse to another document is itself guaranteed to be in the BOS, unless the user takes special pains to delete it from the BOS after arriving. 
So, BOS discipline can be relied upon to guarantee that legal notices (and, needless to say, any other annotations) can be made available from within read-only documents which themselves contain no evidence that such notices/annotations exist. 
There are additional details, but that's the fundamental idea.
