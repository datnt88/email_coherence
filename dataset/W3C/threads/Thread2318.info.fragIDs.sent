In HTTP 1.1: If the server sends Vary: Content-Language must it also send a Content-Language header ? 
(I would think so) 
If the server has more than one language available, but the user agent does not send Accept-Language, need the server send Vary: Content-Language at all ? 
If it does, what is the 
action of a proxy server on getting a request for that URL without an Accept-Language header ? 
How about: URI=index.var, server preferred language is English User Agent sends Server sends Proxy Server caches - english.html 
URI=index.var 
Content-Language: en Content= english.html 
Accept-Language: en english.html 
URI=index.var 
Content-Language: en Content= english.html 
Vary: Accept-Language Content-Language=en Accept-Language: fr french.html 
URI=index.var 
Content-Language: fr Content= french.html 
Vary: Accept-Language Content-Language=fr 
This way, user agents who fail to set Accept-Language will get the default, proxy caches will be used, and agents such as robots will know the language of the default document. 
Currently (Netscape, Apache, HTTPD 1.0) the ordering of languages in Accept-Language indicates the user's desired weighting, but I believe the ordering in Accept (type) is not significant. 
In 1.1, does the ordering have any defined significance, or should people use the qs scheme to indicate preference? 
(As regards my earlier question about robots, I don't think Vary: Accept Language is very useful on its own (for a robot), so I will have to wait for a definition of the Alternates header).

This question reflects a subtle misunderstanding of the Vary mechanism, although you are certainly not the first person to have made this mistake. 
"Vary: Content-Language" makes little sense, because (1) Fields named by "Vary" are expected to be *request* headers, not response headers. 
The description of "Vary" was rewritten several times during the last few weeks of the drafting process, and it looks like we neglected to stress this point emphatically enough. 
(2) Content-Language is normally a *response* header, at least for the GET method. 
So the question makes very little sense, since the premise is wrong: servers would not normally send "Vary: Content-Language". 
If the server has more than one language available, but the user agent does not send Accept-Language, need the server send Vary: Content-Language at all? 
In this case, the server would *still* send "Vary: Accept-language", since any cache involved might receive future requests from other clients that do send Accept-Language. 
If it does, what is the action of a proxy server on getting a request for that URL without an Accept-Language header? 
If the cache sees "Vary: Accept-language" in a response and then a subsequent request for the same resource without an Accept-Language header, it must forward the request (perhaps as a conditional GET). 
Section 14.43 says this quite explicitly: the cache MUST NOT use such a cache entry to construct a response to the new request unless all of the headers named in the cached Vary header are present in the new request Note the word "all" in that phrase.

It's clear from the example later, you meant "Vary: Accept-Language". 
And no, there is no requirement that Content-Language be provided even though the response includes "Vary: accept-language". 
The server must send "Vary: accept-language" if and only if the response would be different if a different accept-language would be sent. 
If it does, what is the action of a proxy server on getting a request for that URL without an Accept-Language header ? 
"Accept-language not supplied" is a different request from "Accept-Language: en" if the response says "Vary: accept-language". 
No, this is wrong. 
It's much simpler than this. 
If there's more than one language, and the response would be different if you send a different Accept-language, then the response must say "Vary: Accept-Language". 
It's also a good idea to send Content-Language to identify the language you actually sent, but there's no requirement that you send it, that the Content-Language actually match (any of the) Accept-Languages sent, etc. 
It is my belief that my responses are the only reasonable interpretation of what draft-ietf-http-v11-spec-06 actually says. 
Do you disagree?
