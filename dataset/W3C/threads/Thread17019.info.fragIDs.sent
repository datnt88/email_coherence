Our designers are often asked to develop interfaces that feature rollovers using JAVASCRIPT. 
One of the popular requests is for the rollover effect to display a list of items which expands on the information that sits behind the link. 
The idea being that authors can have just a few main links from the home page, but users can easily find the deeper links by rolling over each button and viewing the list of links associated with each button. 
The designers can ensure the major links are accessible by providing alternative text for each button and ensuring that there are redundant links that can be accessed via keyboard control. 
However, is there any way of making the more detailed information that is only displayed with the rollover also available in browsers with JAVASCRIPT disabled and for keyboard users and the visually impaired. 
The alt attribute could work but would be an unacceptable length for alt text. 
Longdesc is not supported by all browsers. 
Any ideas?

* rollovers using JAVASCRIPT. 
One of the popular requests is for * the rollover effect to display a list of items which expands on the This is two different scripting actions - rollover and popup menu. 
The rollover part violates the don't generate popups guideline. 
This is quite a common behaviour that designers think should have been in HTML (really it is styling, not HTML) but is not. 
I must read up on CSS3 sometime, but I don't think it is in there. 
A browser could do it on the table of contents generated from Hn elements used correctly, but they generally treat the entries in the contents as pointing to the heading, not what the heading points to. 
I'd suggest they are using HTML for the wrong reasons; the requirement is too far from the true capabilities of HTML (as against the capabilities of particular versions of MSIE). 
* find the deeper links by rolling over each button and viewing the list They've thrown in graphics as an added complication! 
(We now have graphic links, rollovers and popups!) * of links associated with each button. 
Alt will not work as alt cannot contain markup. 
Object would work for the graphics if object worked, but object, on its own will not work when you throw in scripting, so some care would be needed even if you served alternative content to browsers with broken object implementations. 
* alt text. 
Longdesc is not supported by all browsers. 
Any ideas? 
This is not longdesc; any use of longdesc here would be abusing that attribute. 
If you treat the graphic as a link it needs to be a real link, not a longdesc one. 
Once they have covered the question of actively opting into popups++, rather than having to try to opt out of them, my view would be that they should structure the page as nested lists, style them to display fully expanded, then, on loading, have their scripting determine whether the browser is capable of doing what they want to do (caveat, many pages break on Netscape 6 because designers get this step wrong) and collapse out the list using the styles (I hope you can tell if styles are on by reading back the computed style for an element, but some browsers may not have this in their object model and some might compute the value and then ignore it with styles off!). 
More drastically, you could structure the page with properly nested headings and either add divisions to allow the scripting to collapse the structure, or re-write the HTML using the facilities in modern browsers to regraft branches in the document tree. 
(This is almost a general XML solution, but with the input language XHTML.) ++ Note they need to cover this even when browsers enable popups to be disabled. 
i've seen google don't close tr and td tags with /tr and /td . 
probably to safe some precious bytes. 
and browser don't seems to care. is it still html compliant?

It formally complies with HTML specifications up to and including HTML 4.01, but XHTML 1.0 makes closing tags obligatory for all elements. 
On the practical side, some widely used browsers still choke on some constructs when the "optional" closing tags for table cells are omitted. 
The effects vary from completely messing up table presentation to just ignoring some CSS rules. 
In a word, it is poor economy to save those precious bytes. 
This is basically about good HTML authoring principles in general, so it's something that might be best discussed in the Usenet group news:comp.infosystems.www.authoring.html . 
Naturally, good authoring has an impact on accessibility too, especially since if a page gets all messed up, people will disabilities will often have great difficulties since they probably cannot switch browser as easily as other people might.

It is compliant with HTML, but not with XHTML. 
In other words you will be backwards compatible still, but not forwards compatible. 
It saves bytes over the network, at the cost of kilobytes in browser size, meaning more expensive systems are required to read it. 
(One of the reasons why phone systems all work on XML is that it can be used in a smaller computer, and phones have small computers in them) 
This is the classic chicken and egg problem that plagues accessibility, in one of its easier forms. 
If developers do not produce forwards-compatible code, then there is little point in having newer systems that are designed to take advantage of design improvements. 
So the relatively expensive work of developing accessible systems that take advantage of that will have a tiny market. 
In cases like this, unless bandwidth is a really extremely critical concern I would recommend including the extra bytes. 
(And at $5/minute for a 9600 baud connection I would still rather be sure that the code I am getting is going to work on my system - the bytes saved are a lot fewer than if I download half a page before finding out it is no good to me) cheers Charles McCN i've seen google don't close tr and td tags with /tr and /td .

Not only do the browsers have to be more complicated and expensive in terms of footprint, download time, and development cost, but they will still take 
longer to render such constructs. 
Back in the day when /p was optional (and worse - many browsers treated /p as significant) I speeded up some heavy pages (around 80k-150k for just the HTML - don't ask!) by putting the optional /p tags in. 
Even over a 28.8 on a bad phone line (generally functioning at around 20kbps) the time from start of download to rendering of page was appreciably improved (can't give an exact time as it was obviously faster and I didn't need to know beyond that). 
i've seen google don't close tr and td tags with /tr and /td .

and browser don't seems to care. is it still html compliant? 
This makes sense (though slightly counter-intuitive) - if the tags aren't closed then the browser will have to keep piling the data onto a stack until it can be (reasonably) sure of each block's intended endpoint, which in an extreme case might mean getting right to the end of the doc and having to backtrack all the way through to build the structure. 
Big memory/processor cost. 
Come on Google, close them tags! 
Cheers, Danny. 
yeah. non-compliant to XHTML is a problem for future new non-pc devices. 
but it is not the only trouble. 
current web design is only tested for legibility under popular PC-based browser. 
and most web designer would not sacrifice 'cool factor' (flash, animated gif, big jpeg, moving button, etc) just for the sake of accessibility to all devices. 
most web designer in the near future would probably give alternative version to choose for instead: (1) for people with PC. the design will be just like today. 
but even more complicated, more non-compliant, and more abusive (table as layout etc). 
web designer will get younger and more abundant = more design mistakes. 
(2) for people with non-PC. 
a lazy webmaster aiming for as many people as possible, will only built (2). 
a young, non-experienced, 'cool' designer will only built (1). 
bigger and commerce website will build both. 
currently, there is a race between: - small devices increasing computing power and logic to render more non-compliant websites. 
- and web designer learning to write more compliant websites so it can be rendered on more devices. 
in such a way that we shouldn't worry much about in-existance of tr and td closing tags of today. 
though i agree that to support non-pc internet devices manufacturer, some one should buy that products, which depends on how good it can render most websites, which depends on people writing compliant code. 
everyone has a role here ;) CM It is compliant with HTML, but not with XHTML. 
In other words you will be CM backwards compatible still, but not forwards compatible. 
It saves bytes over CM the network, at the cost of kilobytes in browser size, meaning more expensive CM systems are required to read it. 
CM (One of the reasons why phone systems all work on XML is that it can be used CM in a smaller computer, and phones have small computers in them) CM This is the classic chicken and egg problem that plagues accessibility, in CM one of its easier forms. 
If developers do not produce forwards-compatible CM code, then there is little point in having newer systems that are designed to CM take advantage of design improvements. 
So the relatively expensive work of CM developing accessible systems that take advantage of that will have a tiny CM market.

An alternative would be to add a submenu to each page that duplicates what is on the popup menus. 
Let's say you have a Menu Item called "Company," and when you roll over it, a menu pops up with four subselections. 
If Javascript is disabled, then the popup doesn't appear. 
So if the user clicks on "Company," then they should go to the Company page, which should have a submenu on it with the four subselections that are avialable in the popup menu to a user with Javascript turned on. 
Make sense?

Thank you David for your extremely detailed and thorough response to my request for assistance re JAVASCRIPT rollovers. 
Thanks also Russell - and yes that does makes sense. 
I will certainly retain these suggestions for future reference as we have had requests for this kind of rollover pop-up window selection method in the past. 
However in this case the requirement is less complicated. 
The rollover displays a list of items relevant to the link but these items are not selectable - they are just additional descriptive information aimed at informing the user about the selection. 
Hence my request for advice about an alternative to providing lengthy alt attributes or longdesc for each selectable button. 
In this case, the rollover effect is an alternative graphic image displayed that provides detailed information about the link rather than just a simple alternative visual effect such as highlighter or whatever.

Can we then have a link on the page that shows the list?

Can we have a link on the page something like a d link that would list the items when activated?

Denise, Hello. 
To add to Randal's mail. 
We just developed a site with that very feature that he mentioned. 
The client wanted rollovers with a hierarchal drop down menu. 
Here is what we did instead http://www.healthysmilesforwi.org. 
Once you click on one of the main nav bar links, the sub links are on that inner page. 
Or you you goto our home page http://www.ichp.edu 
you will see something similar. 
Click on one of the TOP links only (with the triangle arrows), and you will see drop down links. 
Christian An alternative would be to add a submenu to each page that duplicates what is on the popup menus.

Thanks Christian and Randal Yes I understand what you are suggesting and that is how we have tackled most situations requiring sub-menus to be displayed from the main page. 
However, as per my last email, the particular cases to which I am referring are not sub-menus displayed as the mouse rolls-over the options, but rather, graphic text elaborating and expanding on the information relevant to the link. 
The idea is that users can "see" what sub-menu items exist in the particular section prior to making the selection. 
An example of what I am describing is here: http://www.library.unisa.edu.au/ 
As you can see the buttons have alt text but to apply this principle for each alternate rollover image would require unacceptably long alt text to capture all of the descriptive information. 
David (P) thanks for your suggestion of a link on the page to show the list. 
The concern with that is the additional "clutter" on the screen as there would need to be links for each button to show the expanded information for each possible selection. 
Thanks to everyone who has contributed to this discussion thus far.
