<s> We don't want to say they must use style sheets if they have no wish to  </s>

<s> I tried to incorporate your comments, Len, in the following proposal.  </s>
<s> Hopefully it conveys that if none of the presentation elements or  </s>
<s> attributes exist then we just need to verify that structural elements are  </s>
<s> not being abused.  </s>
<s> Perhaps this ought to link to those techniques.  </s>
<s> For  </s>
<s> now, I suggest "verify that the author has chosen not to modify  </s>
<s> presentation in any way." that's pretty open-ended, perhaps too much so?  </s>
<s> Technique 3.3.1  </s>
<s> [priority 2] Check document for use of style sheets.  </s>
<s> Discussion Status: awaiting discussion Evaluation:  </s>
<s> Check the document for presence of STYLE or LINK rel="stylesheet" elements  </s>
<s> within the HEAD element or use of "style" attributes throughout the document.  </s>
<s> Check for FONT and BASEFONT elements, and the "text," "vlink," "link," and  </s>
<s> "alink" attributes on BODY.  </s>

<s> Use style sheets to control layout and presentation.  </s>
<s> For example, use the  </s>
<s> CSS 'font' property instead of the HTML FONT and BASEFONT elements to  </s>
<s> control font styles Repair Technique: If none of these elements are identified, verify that the author has chosen  </s>

<s> If FONT or BASEFONT elements or "text," "vlink," "link," and "alink"  </s>
<s> attributes on BODY, suggest or help the author convert the presentatin  </s>
<s> properties to style sheets.  </s>
<s> If the author chosses to convert deprecated markup to style sheets or add  </s>
<s> style sheets, trigger technique 6.1 to verify that the document is readable when style sheets are not applied.  </s>

<s> I like the idea to trigger the suggestion to use stylesheets on just a  </s>
<s> couple of elements, such as FONT, where a stylesheet can be used.  </s>
<s> I would  </s>
<s> add that it's very important to trigger this if we find a layout table as  </s>
<s> well.  </s>
<s> I think one of the big intents of stylesheets was to be able to  </s>
<s> position items that way and move away from layout tables altogether.  </s>
<s> Once  </s>
<s> CSS is widely supported, we would want to see layout tables disappear entirely.  </s>
<s> Michael  </s>
<s> I added the following to the list of triggers;  </s>
<s> If layout tables are identified (see technique 5.1.1),  </s>
<s> trigger this check  </s>
<s> as well.  </s>
<s> michael, does your comment imply that we ought to get rid of the first check:  </s>
<s> Check the document for presence of STYLE or LINK rel="stylesheet" elements  </s>
<s> within the HEAD element or use of "style" attributes throughout the document.  </s>
<s> --wendy  </s>

<s> No, I wasn't suggesting we remove the evaluation to check for inline or external stylesheets.  </s>
<s> My interpretation of the technique is that we check  </s>
<s> for the presence of stylesheets (first evaluation point); if we don't find  </s>
<s> them, but we do find elements that should be replaced by stylesheets  </s>
<s> (remaining evaluation points, such as fonts, tables, etc.), then we trigger  </s>
<s> this technique.  </s>
<s> Is that how everyone else reads it?  </s>
<s> Maybe the wording could  </s>
<s> be cleared up a little bit if so.  </s>
<s> Michael  </s>
<s> I think we need to check for all of them.  </s>
<s> Some people may use a style sheet for some things and FONT for others.  </s>
<s> Therefore, going through all of the checks seems appropriate.  </s>

<s> The rewording still has a check for STYLE.  </s>
<s> No need to check for style.  </s>
<s> Only need to check for FONT, BASEFONT, and, as michael suggests, tables used for layout.  </s>

<s> Michael,  </s>
<s> Why check for Stylesheets if the person isn't using fonts or tables for layout?  </s>
<s> If an author is satsified to simply let the user and his or her browser define presentation (like when HTML was invented) why insist on a style sheet?  </s>

<s> Ok, if I understand what you meant, we should trigger Technique 3.3.1  </s>
<s> - suggest using stylesheets - on elements that should be replaced by stylesheets, such as FONT and TABLE (for layout).  </s>
<s> And we should do so even if we find the page also uses stylesheets on other elements.  </s>
<s> Is that right?  </s>
<s> That approach would make sense to me.  </s>
<s> In that case, maybe I would after all suggest we remove the check for the presence of LINK REL="stylesheet", the STYLE element, and the STYLE attribute.  </s>
<s> We don't want to trigger a recommendation to use stylesheets on a stylesheet.  </s>
<s> Those will of course trigger the separate technique to make sure stylesheets degrade gracefully.  </s>
<s> Just to muddy the waters, what about a situation where an author used FONT elements, and used a stylesheet to redefine the FONT element (used a .font  </s>
<s> selector, or used a CLASS attribute in the FONT element that the stylesheet defined, or even an ID attribute)?  </s>
<s> I would suggest that the author has both  </s>
<s> used stylesheets and made sure they degrade gracefully, and we wouldn't want to trigger either technique.  </s>
<s> I know that this depends on processing stylesheets, which we probably won't implement in this version of the Techniques, but I'd like to see how that sits.  </s>
<s> Michael  </s>
<s> Well, as Ian just pointed out, css does not require that style override font.  </s>
<s> it just suggests that it do so.  </s>
<s> So we've got to ask them to avoid font, period.  </s>
