<s> Scott, I don't understand why you say: "... the use of text-only versions means that the NY Times is out of compliance with the guidelines."  </s>
<s> I can't find any checkpoint in the content guidelines that prohibits text-only sites.  </s>
<s> The pertinent checkpoint seems to be 11.4: "If, after best efforts, you cannot create an accessible page, provide a link to an alternative page that uses W3C technologies, is accessible, has equivalent information (or functionality), and is updated as often as the inaccessible (original) page."  </s>

<s> Hi, Gregory Your response is kind of unexpected.  </s>
<s> First, the use of text-only versions means that the NY Times is out of compliance with the guidelines.  </s>
<s> Another interesting aspect is that your comment supports what I've been saying about the usefulness of multiple versions of dynamically generated web pages.  </s>
<s> It also points out that the guidelines may need to have different requirements depending on whether the web pages are created dynamically or not.  </s>

<s> If I might make a comment on that specific point: it seems to me to be a fundamental misunderstanding to "cater to" Lynx users by generating text-only versions.  </s>
<s> Text-only versions can (paradoxically?) be useful to those using graphical browsers, because those browsers typically do not behave well when auto image loading is turned off.  </s>
<s> Lynx has no difficulty in accessing a non-customised web page in text mode, and displaying the appropriate text-mode fallback that has been provided (we hope, in accordance with good WWW design practice).  </s>
<s> No matter how cleverly the multiple variants of the same page might be generated, the procedure inevitably impacts cacheability.  </s>
<s> If the benefits outweigh that, then it would be OK, and there could well be situations where that seems to be the case; but as a general principle, I don't believe they do.  </s>
<s> best regards  </s>
<s> I wasn't endorsing the design consideration, only trying to explain a possible (valid) design consideration.  </s>
<s> As long as you allow access for -everyone-, it -is- a valid design decision to create pages optimized for a particular browser or set of browsers.  </s>
<s> (Doing this correctly is difficult, which is why information ghettoization is a problem.) I don't personally -agree- with this design decision and I would argue against it, but I would not argue that it's an invalid thing for someone to want to do.  </s>
