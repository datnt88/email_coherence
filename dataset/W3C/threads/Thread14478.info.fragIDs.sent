Scott, I don't understand why you say: "... the use of text-only versions means that the NY Times is out of compliance with the guidelines." 
I can't find any checkpoint in the content guidelines that prohibits text-only sites. 
The pertinent checkpoint seems to be 11.4: "If, after best efforts, you cannot create an accessible page, provide a link to an alternative page that uses W3C technologies, is accessible, has equivalent information (or functionality), and is updated as often as the inaccessible (original) page." 
Would you please elaborate? 
Thanks, Dick Brown

Hi, Gregory Your response is kind of unexpected. 
First, the use of text-only versions means that the NY Times is out of compliance with the guidelines. 
Another interesting aspect is that your comment supports what I've been saying about the usefulness of multiple versions of dynamically generated web pages. 
It also points out that the guidelines may need to have different requirements depending on whether the web pages are created dynamically or not.

aloha, scott! 
please let them know that the text-only slash low bandwidth version of their site makes them the most accessible online newspaper that i've yet 
to 
encounter.... overall, their web site (with a few significant holes, such as the 
magazine 
section) is easy to use, and is quite a popular source of news for blind users, especially those who use lynx... gregory. 
Hi, Dick 
That was the checkpoint I was referring to. 
However, my statement was not about text-only web sites, but web sites with parallel graphic and text-only web pages which the checkpoint strongly urges avoiding unless absolutely necessary. 
Scott 
"absolutely necessary" is hard to define. 
Note, also, that it doesn't forbid the creation of text-only 
sites for _non-disability-access_ reasons. 
For example, it's possible that they think a text-only site is the best way to convey their information or they're trying to cater to a Lynx crowd.

All, It might also be the best way to convey information to low bandwidth areas, 
which includes a large portion of the world.

Hi, Kynn Yes. 
You're absolutely right about the checkpoint. 
I was stuck in the disability access mode.

aloha, kynn!

which was part of my original point -- the alternate slash parallel version of the site was created with anything but accessibility in mind -- maximum market penetration is what the times was and is after, and their text only 
version not only caters to the text-only market, but may someday become the basis for a fee based dial in phone service... gregory He that lives on Hope, dies farting -- Benjamin Franklin, Poor Richard's Almanack, 1763 Gregory J. Rosmaita unagi69@concentric.net

People with cognitive disability also benefit from text summaries and small images where bandwidth is limited. 
large amounts of text offer a poor solution to bandwidth where english is not the first language. 
small graphics are an enormous benefit in aiding comprehension. 
It(text only) might also be the best way to convey information to low 
bandwidth areas,

If I might make a comment on that specific point: it seems to me to be a fundamental misunderstanding to "cater to" Lynx users by generating text-only versions. 
Text-only versions can (paradoxically?) be useful to those using graphical browsers, because those browsers typically do not behave well when auto image loading is turned off. 
Lynx has no difficulty in accessing a non-customised web page in text mode, and displaying the appropriate text-mode fallback that has been provided (we hope, in accordance with good WWW design practice). 
No matter how cleverly the multiple variants of the same page might be generated, the procedure inevitably impacts cacheability. 
If the benefits outweigh that, then it would be OK, and there could well be situations where that seems to be the case; but as a general principle, I don't believe they do. 
best regards 
I wasn't endorsing the design consideration, only trying to explain a possible (valid) design consideration. 
As long as you allow access for -everyone-, it -is- a valid design decision to create pages optimized for a particular browser or set of browsers. 
(Doing this correctly is difficult, which is why information ghettoization is a problem.) I don't personally -agree- with this design decision and I would argue against it, but I would not argue that it's an invalid thing for someone to want to do.
