LONGDESC is designed to eventually replace the D link. 
For awhile we may still need the D link til browsers support LONGDESC. 
However, the information in the LONGDESC and D link should be identical.... 
Or rather I should say that they should both point to the exact same place &amp; text. 
Gregg (Vanderheiden) This well-designed and highly-accessible web site uses what's known as a D link, or "description." 
Clicking on a D link takes users to another web page which offers image or sound descriptions whose robust explanations aren't well served by ALT or TITLE or LONGDESC attributes. 
Excuse me, I thought that LONGDESC was the properly engineered attribute that was intended to replace the D-link kludge. 
I mean no disrespect to the folks at wgbh, they did something that needed doing, and did it with the tools at hand. 
But a properly engineered solution is still surely better? 
best regards alt text would work well for all three audiences: maybe something like img alt="purple line________________________________" and img alt="zig-zag line /\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\" would work well. 
I would use ALT as replacement text, TITLE as an image title: If we treat these attributes this way, we get simplicity and consistency. 
Liam Quinn I would suggest that it should reflect the function of the line rather than the appearance as in IMG ALT= "Section Divider Line" Gregg Gregg C Vanderheiden Ph.D. Professor - Human Factors Dept of Ind.

For a list of our listserves send "lists" to listproc@tracecenter.org I would second Gregg's suggestion. 
Functional descriptions are much more critical to both the navigational and cognitive needs of the user. 
If, however the color of the line somehow implied meaning -- like a street signal -- then including the color would be important.

Gregg responded: than the appearance as in The inclusion of "Line" in that ALT text seems to be reflective of the appearance to me. 
ALT="Section Divider" describes the function of the image, but I believe that ALT text is better used as a *replacement* for the image, which usually means that it *provides* the image function rather than describing the function. 
The distinction between providing the image function and describing the function can be subtle, but I think it's important in the quest for seamless accessibility and device independence. 
My decision to use ALT="-------------------------" is not based on the appearance of the image at all. 
Rather, I'm giving this ALT text as a replacement for the image, providing its function--rendered appropriately as a dividing line on text-only browsers and a pause on most speech browsers. 
(I'm told that some screen readers will say "hyphen-hyphen-hyphen-etc." when encountering such ALT text. 
My response to this is that these devices are misconfigured. 
Would they also say "hyphen-hyphen" when reading a sentence like this--with a dash?) If a speech browser's pause is not a sufficient cue for a section change (I believe it would be, but hopefully those more experienced with speech browsers will chime in), then one could also include "End of Section", or, perhaps more seamless, "This concludes the section on Widgets." 
The hyphens could still be included as an extra aid to visual, text-only browsers: Liam Quinn Web Design Group Enhanced Designs, Web Site Development Providing the meaning rather than the visual indication of that meaning would be better, in my opinion. 
For example, if a site uses images of orange dividing lines before warnings and green dividing lines before notes, then ALT="Warning:" and ALT="Note:" would be better than ALT="Orange Divider Line" and ALT="Green Divider Line". 
Liam Quinn Web Design Group Enhanced Designs, Web Site Development True, but most of this is contextual in nature. 
It's really difficult make a hard and fast statement. 
Technical writing often finds itself in similar situations when describing graphical entities in text books (or at least I did when I was writing). 
It's why I've always recommended that a web site be designed by a team consisiting minimally of: tech writer, graphic artist/designer, engineer, usability engineer and marketing. 
Mike Right, which is why I think it's a mistake to try to treat ALT text as if it can be context-free. 
I suggest TITLE as a context-free image title and ALT as a context-sensitive image replacement. 
Liam Quinn Web Design Group Enhanced Designs, Web Site Development That's basically the way I see it now (after having been dissuaded from my earlier use of "ascii art"). 
But I'm still uneasy about the borderline between information and meta-information. 
It all seems to hinge upon whether we think a text browser should display ALT text seamlessly, or whether it should provide some kind if indicator that it's different in nature from normal text. 
And there are some situations where the one is preferable (for example, where the image is of text in a special font, and the ALT only repeats the text), and some where the other is preferable (e.g where the text is a functional replacement for a graphical sign, and an author is tempted to put the ALT ext in some kind of delimiters, [-] or *-* or whatever, if a typical text browser would otherwise make it appear seamless). 
A dilemma. 
I need to understand what the "intent" of the TITLE element description is first before I'd make that leap. 
However, I think what we're proposing is a tiered description level: TITLE - ALT - longdesc While we're at it, can someone please explain to me why the syntax for the OBJECT tag that includes an image, specifies the ALT text of that image without the ALT attribute? 
(Or at least, that's how the 4.0 spec describes it). 
Seems to be an inconsistent use of syntax. 
- Mike All: It's not useful to have a long thread of messages with the subject line "Ok is this more useful" When you send a message to these archived lists, give some thought to how people might be able to track the discussion at a later date. 
Remember: these conversations we have online are not like hallway conversations where you might say something and walk away-- these bits are going to be around to haunt you for the rest of your life-- so: A) Use meaningful subject lines B) and where possible dont limit the above good intent just to the subject line:-) use meaningful message bodies that you will be proud to tell your grandchildren about Best Regards, --raman as representative of my employer, Adobe Systems Inc. 
Actually, this is the great advantage of the OBJECT element: it allows block-level content to be included as an alternative to the resource which it designates. 
The content of the ALT attribute, if one may use this expression in a non-technical sense, can consist only of text characters and must in practice be relatively short. 
Thus, the alternative to the graphical resource given in the OBJECT element may range from a brief label to an entire description, complete with markup, links to other resources (as are particularly important in the case of an image map), etc. 
Thus, far from being an inconsistency, I would describe the content model of OBJECT as a substantial and positive innovation, which will do much to further the development of accessible HTML documents which are equally appealing in visual and non-visual media. 
[Mike Paciello] The point of the original post that started this discussion was that accessibility should target *everyone* - and for sighted users with a text browser, there should be a visual cue akin to that of a horizontal rule. 
"Section divider" simply doesn't provide the same visual impact that "----------------------------" does. 
Even a short line, with a description, like "---- section divider" would be better then a text- only alt attribute.
