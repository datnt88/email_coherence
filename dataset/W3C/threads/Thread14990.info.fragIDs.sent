<s> I have a concern, with Checkpoint 5.2 - Ensure that technologies relied upon by the content are declared and widely available.  </s>
<s> The success criteria makes no mention of technologies that can only be used on specific operating systems.  </s>
<s> At present we require that technologies and features on the required list are available in at least two independently-developed implementations.  </s>
<s> But no mention of weather it is possible to develop applications for other platforms.  </s>
<s> What if they are only supportable one a specific platform?  </s>
<s> In other works if a web author choses to use a technologies that can only be accessible on Lynix or can only be accessible to user agents run on Microsoft - surely  </s>

<s> Should we also specify that the independently-developed implementations are not themselves dependent on the same proprietary , restricted (non-free) components?  </s>

<s> JAWS 4.5 supports Flash MX through MSAA; so does Window-Eyes, a competing product.  </s>
<s> Flash MX includes features designed to support accessibility.  </s>
<s> Are you saying that a developer who uses Flash MX cannot make a conformance claim even if the Flash content is accessible to people who are using both Window-Eyes and JAWS?  </s>
<s> If this is in fact what we're saying, it worries me-- it sounds like we might be raising the bar to an impossible height.  </s>

<s> The reasoning for two independent implementations was to limit the concept that one group would benefit while another would not.  </s>
<s> At least that was my goal when Jason and I proposed this wording.  </s>
<s> There was to be included a segment that stated that no one could claim an accessible status if they required tools that were built upon the same engine.  </s>
<s> Therefore, any tool using the Internet Explorer engine would have to be considered when the other tool used the same engine.  </s>
<s> It was also pointed out that there is only one user agent that supports the MSAA required by Flash MX.  </s>
<s> I believe that was Window-Eyes.  </s>
<s> Therefore, any site that wanted to claim an accessible status using Flash MX would not be able to do such.  </s>
<s> At least until another user agent provided the access for Flash MX and did not require the MSAA or the Internet Explorer engine.  </s>
<s> (NOTE: not trying to pick on Flash) Sincerely, Lee Roberts President/CEO 405-321-6372 Rose Rock Design, Inc. -----Original Message----- Of Lisa Seeman (by way of Wendy A Chisholm wendy@w3.org ) A few clarifications: I am referring to 5.2 in http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20/ checkpoint 5.2 reads: Ensure that technologies relied upon by the content are declared and widely available.  </s>
<s> success criteria level two reads: Technologies and features on the required list are available in at least two independently-developed implementations.  </s>
<s> Now what is happening is people are claiming accessibility based on technologies that can only be used on the windows/intel platform, and assistive technologies that do not run on window, can not, with all the will in the world, provide support.  </s>
<s> I see a big difference hear between developing based on a free download, or even a none non-free application, and developing for, say, only IBM with windows.  </s>
<s> (hay I use IBM and windows, but that is not the point) Part of the difference is that the user can get a new user agent a lot easer then he can sell his mac and buy an IBM.  </s>
<s> But the BIG difference is that developers of assistive technology for other platforms are barred from developing support.  </s>
<s> The do not have the API's.  </s>
<s> They can not do it.  </s>
<s> It seems to me that this allows potential monopolies, and such games to be played in the assistive technology/platform market.  </s>
<s> I think that it is the disabled who will pay the price.  </s>
<s> Any standard that are relied on for fulfillment of these guidelines must be open and usable on more then one, independently owned, platform.  </s>
<s> Lisa  </s>
<s> I'm concerned that I think Lisa's request goes beyond this, that it doesn't matter how many Assistive Technologies vendors support a technology on Windows.  </s>
<s> As long as AT is only available on Windows, the technology should not be considered accessible.  </s>
<s> We wrestled a lot with what we wanted this checkpoint to say.  </s>
<s> It is a very difficult issue.  </s>
<s> Lisa, I assume you are requesting that we re-open the discussion.  </s>
<s> Loretta  </s>
<s> To The Group - I, too, believe that Lisa's comments go beyond "just" the technologies that are possibly programmed into a web page or an entire site.  </s>
<s> I am having a difficult time trying to figure out the "real" issue.  </s>
<s> Lisa, am I wrong in thinking that you are saying (possibly), some operating platforms/systems are being ignored when it comes to vendors making accessible products/agents/technologies for a lesser selling operating system.  </s>
<s> If this is what you are saying, I can tell you, you are 100% correct.  </s>
<s> In the early years of assistive technology, Macintosh was superior with regard to assistive technology (stuff built into their system and software developers making AT products for the Mac).  </s>
<s> In my humble opinion, I have seen the PC world jump way ahead of Mac related to accessibility products and supports.  </s>
<s> Some vendors are no longer developing multi-platform products, especially assistive tech products.  </s>
<s> Is this what you were talking about?  </s>
<s> Thoughts?  </s>
