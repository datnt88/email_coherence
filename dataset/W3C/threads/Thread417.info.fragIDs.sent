Would be grateful if someone could help me with the following problem. 
Have searched the mail archives, but with no real joy. 
Apologies if this has been handled before ... 
I'm trying to use some custom tags using the following options in config.txt 
(as well as trying different combinations of custom tag types): new-blocklevel-tags: new-empty-tags: new-inline-tags: new-pre-tags: heading, para, text, flowtext, subheading, main_content, select_element, skeleton, nav, start_flowtext, select_element, break When converting the following HTML to XML, I get a problem where the custom tag is causing formatting tags (font, b, etc..) to be split around our new tags. 
Is there a way around this ? 
EXAMPLE INPUT HTML:- EXAMPLE OUTPUT HTML IN OUR TIDY.LOG:- p b font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" /font /b /p b font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" b Got an event this summer that needs a boost /b Thanks, Dominic Jackson 
You probably want your new tags to be inline tags instead of blocklevel or pre tags -- font and other inline tags cannot span multiple blocks.

OK, I've tried making our tags in-line, but this turns our input :- into the following p b font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" heading style="background-colour:#8000FF" b font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" b Got an event this summer that needs a boost /b /font /b /heading /font /b /p which obviously isn't especially desirable, as now the 'font' and 'b' tags are getting applied a secone time within our new 'heading' tag. 
Any ideas ? 
Dom.
