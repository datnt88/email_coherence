<s> Subject: Flash In an earlier message Steve Jacobson was asking some questions about older flash presentations and wanted GW Micro to comment.  </s>
<s> Deneb Meketa, an Accessibility engineer, with Macromedia is much more qualified so he responded.  </s>
<s> I wanted to make this public for all to read.  </s>
<s> The following is Deneb's response: The Flash Player 6 will expose as much information as it can find in any Flash movie, including older content.  </s>
<s> For the most part, this means text and text buttons should come through correctly.  </s>
<s> The overall results will be rough in some cases.  </s>
<s> Starting with version 6 of the Flash MX authoring tool, creators of Flash can add text equivalents to entire Flash movies, and to the individual objects in their movies.  </s>
<s> Authors can also control which objects are eligible for voicing, which can help silence distracting visual elements.  </s>
<s> Some advanced techniques are also available, meaning that authors who are dedicated to creating accessible content should be able to produce some excellent results for screen reader users.  </s>
<s> Beginning with version 6, Macromedia is also promoting accessibility requirements for Flash content in a high-profile way.  </s>
<s> This should help us close the most important gap in Flash accessibility, which is one of design rather than technology.  </s>
<s> In many ways, older Flash content will behave similarly to HTML pages that were written without attention to accessibility.  </s>
<s> The basic text will come through, and all interactive elements will be reachable, but graphics and advanced scripting may not be intelligible, and the overall design may not make much sense.  </s>
<s> It is important to distinguish among the many roles in which Flash content appears.  </s>
<s> First, Flash can be used as a kind of superset of HTML, displaying text, hyperlinks, and interactive elements.  </s>
<s> When Flash is used in this role, it is usually because designers want to create a Web page that is more visually flexible than HTML.  </s>
<s> This is a situation that should work reasonably well for screen reader users.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, Flash can also be used as a high-perfomance animation tool.  </s>
<s> Flash movies of this kind are sometimes called "eye candy."  </s>
<s> They are highly visual and sometimes contain no text.  </s>
<s> Often they have audio tracks as well, but often the audio is created in an ancillary way rather than making sense on its own.  </s>
<s> Our hope is that authors of "eye candy" Flash movies will get into the habit of simply providing an overall text equivalent for the entire movie.  </s>
<s> But "eye candy" movies created prior to Flash 6 will not provide much useful information to screen readers.  </s>
<s> In the end, Steve makes a good point: there is a difference between content that is accessible and content that is usable.  </s>
<s> We believe that the Flash Player 6 gets Flash content from zero to accessible.  </s>
<s> We now face the more substantial task of going from accessible to usable.  </s>
<s> That will require further advances in the Flash Player, but it will also require attention from Flash authors.  </s>
<s> In recognition of this fact, Macromedia is turning a lot of attention to the research and promotion of usable accessible content.  </s>
