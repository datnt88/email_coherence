<s> Hi Andrew.  </s>
<s> Well, typically a requirements document comes first.  </s>
<s> Aac At least I assume that is what this list will be about.  </s>
<s> :)  </s>
<s> Its about using SVG for print - not just 'print this SVG file i am viewing' but also 'generate SVG in print driver for sending to SVG-enabled printer'.  </s>
<s> This may or may not require a separate profile.  </s>
<s> It could also be a set of efficiency guidelines, color matching guidelines, and information for optimising workflows.  </s>

<s> Hi Chris, Um ... :) ... I didn't say the print profile would be *next*.  </s>
<s> :) A Requirements WD would be a good start.  </s>
<s> I am waiting with interest to see what emerges.  </s>
<s> For example, how many of the issues raised at SVG Open 2002 by Canon about use of SVG as page description language, nguage/ will be addressed, what additional colour spaces might be added etc.  </s>
<s> Andrew Watt P.S. Did you receive a private email I sent you a few days ago?  </s>
<s> With the increase in spam I tend to wonder if spam filters are being over zealous at times with AOL mail.  </s>

<s> Aac Hi Chris, Aac Um ... :) ... I didn't say the print profile would be *next*.  </s>
<s> :) Right.  </s>
<s> Neither did I, nor did I announce that a requirements document would be published soon.  </s>
<s> Aac A Requirements WD would be a good start.  </s>
<s> Yes.  </s>
<s> Aac I am waiting with interest to see what emerges.  </s>

<s> Aac nguage/ Aac will be addressed, I would expect to see the majority of them addressed, and all of them noted as feature requests.  </s>
<s> Aac what additional colour spaces might be added etc. Did you have any particular requests?  </s>
<s> Device CMYK, Color managed CMYK, LAB, Hexachrome, spot colors, metallics, varnishes?  </s>
<s> Aac Andrew Watt Aac P.S. Did you receive a private email I sent you a few days ago?  </s>

<s> Chris, In the context of svg-print I don't feel too anxious.  </s>
<s> CMYK would likely be highest on my list, but I hadn't anticipated that you would overlook it.  </s>
<s> And you haven't.  </s>
<s> I do fancy playing with LAB under programmatic control in SVG.  </s>
<s> It might let me move forward from tentative exploration to feeling I am in control (at least at times).  </s>
<s> The reason I am copying this to www-svg is that my main request to the SVG WG currently would be that I would like to see more visible and timely coordination re SVG and XForms.  </s>
<s> Within days of the XForms CR being released last Autumn several of us asked on www-svg about XForms and SVG.  </s>
<s> With no new SVG 1.2 WD yet released it seems there will be, at best, limited opportunity to comment on SVG and XForms before the XForms CR comment period closes in a couple of weeks.  </s>
<s> In my view that is disappointing.  </s>
<s> I think XForms and SVG have enormous potential synergy.  </s>
<s> It would be nice to have the opportunity to explore that potential synergy further before the XForms CR period closes.  </s>
