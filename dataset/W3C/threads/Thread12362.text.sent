The question of priority assignment in matters concerning the documentation for Authoring Tools (as well as for User Agents) was unresolvedly discussed at yesterday's telecon. 
I submit that it is quite permissible for us to, if we so choose, to recognize the important difference between the guidelines concerning the tools themselves and the documentation one must endure in order to install/learn/use said tools. 
Although for all users these latter activities are hoop/hurdle/barrier/nuisance there is a sense in which for PWDs the barriers presented completely preclude the ultimate experience of the tool proper. 
Many other users have access to features within the tools whose installation will be merely inconvenient but because in many cases the mere act of uninformed/misinformed installation can cause cyberfatality the inconvenience rises to the level of *DANGER - THIS MAY KILL YOUR SYSTEM* because their setup is both rare and fragile. 
Further the absence of criteria for reading level considerations also precludes access to documentation for a great many people who aren't strictly covered as "disabled". 
In the light of this I propose: in regard to the documentation for Authoring Tools (the UA can do what they want to, of course) we make it a priority 1 requirement that access to the documentation demands that these documents be Triple-A conformant. 
If they are not, then that means that the tools package itself cannot even be Single-A conformant, which IMO is fair/just/proper. 
Obviously this cannot be retrofitted into ATAG 1.0, but there may be time to debate/resolve/include it in our next version. 
If it's possible to make a version 1.x then I think we should consider it for that. 
Love. 
ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE Amplification re the difference between the guidelines concerning the tools themselves and their documentation: just as metadata is data about data so documentation is a "metatool" - a tool essential to the installation/use/analysis of the subject tool. 
Rather than have a separate "document for documentation accessibility" we can decide that the documentation for a tool that is accessible must meet a higher standard of conformance because it forms a particularly insidious barrier to the use of the tool, particularly for newcomers and PWDs. 
Even should such books as "Home Page Writer for Dummies" come out and be generously linked to suitable slide shows, multi-media presentations, etc. the responsibility for maximally accessible documentation should be emphasized by requiring it to be Triple-A conformant - IMO. Love. 
ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE Hmmm. 
This comes squarely under the rubric of checkpoint 7.1 - make sure the tool is accessible. 
So I guess the answer is to do a survey of the different materials for doing that, and see what they say... Chaals The question of priority assignment in matters concerning the documentation for Authoring Tools (as well as for User Agents) was unresolvedly discussed at yesterday's telecon.

The question is still: "Can it be the case that the needfuls for documentation can make it a higher priority than the document for which it is the skeleton key?" Love. 
ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE What we say at the moment is "do what they say". 
It may be that what "they" say is sufficient, in which case we can rest easy and be grateful. 
If not, we need to make an explicit exception, which is a genuine full blown issue (although I agree with you, that documentation is really really important) that we need to look into. 
Without demonstrating that there is something wrong with existing specifications for making tools accessible I am loath to just add a requirement that I think properly belongs in those other specifications.
