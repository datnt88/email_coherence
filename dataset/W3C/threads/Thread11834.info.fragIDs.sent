currently it reads "do not use inaccessible markup in examples [p1]" I propose that we change it to "Clearly identify any missing accessibility features in each example. 
P1" An alternative possiblity is to make it P1 for features which are web-content-priority-1, p2 for those which are web-content-priority-2, etc. 
But i think this is a general P1, consistent with the application of priority 1 to checkpoints which require the author to be guided towards accessible design.

aloha, charles! 
whilst, at first (quick) listen, i agreed with your rewording of 7.3 -- quote Clearly identify any missing accessibility features in each example. 
P1 unquote, when i re-read it, the only thought that came to mind is: why the hell we can't just say quote Do NOT use inaccessible markup in examples unquote there are (and will continue to be, for as long as the web exists) innumerable web sites where one can go to learn how to use (or, rather, misuse) inaccessible and invalid HTML and other stupid stylistic tricks to achieve a perceived effect for a specific platform, graphics card, browser, etc. -- why should we tell developers quote it is ok if you teach them how to do something wrong, as long as you point out to them the potential problems blah blah blah unquote so, i vote against the proposal, and vote for keeping the original wording, and this is an issue for which i am willing to filibuster, if necessary... allowing AU manufacturers to provide inaccessible and slash or invalid markup in examples is not only unconscionable, it's just plain counter-productive -- not to mention counter-intuative.... gregory.

Hi Gregory! 
I agree with your intent, but I think we need to think about a better way to explain it in order to make it reasonable to implement. 
So I suggest we reword the checkpoint to say "ensure that all examples are triple-A compliant to WCAG [P1]". 
There is still an argument for allowing simplified examples to be built up, although I suggest that a single example might be built in stages, just as the instructions for lego build on smaller pieces which are useless in themselves. 
If a developer really wants to demonstrate how to do some magic trick that only works for mini-market browser 9.5 with speech input turned off and haptic input set to hypersensitive, then to comply with WCAG they will have to provide a complete accessible alternative, and doing that should be part of natural design (and therefore included in the example).

aloha, charles! 
as always, your cool reasoning has tempered my intemperate wrath... i "see" where you are going with this, and will try to take a whack at wording (or at least a technique or 2) myself... and, although i can "see" the justification and precedent, i am wary of using sliding priority ratings on this checkpoint, and would advocate that it be P1, due to the delicate, nuanced, and sensitive nature of the problem with which we are grappling... gregory.

I "hear" you Gregory, and I agree on the priority, having pondered the question since last week's call.
