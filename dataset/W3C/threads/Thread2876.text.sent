Hi There, While going through technical jargons, I came across this term 'Http-Tunneling'. 
It is said that using this,it is possible to send data of any protocol through proxy over HTTP.Can any one tell me how this can be achieved? 
any sample code will provide good idea or send me the urls where I can get the basics of http-tunneling. 
Is it possible to tunnel complex protocols which are used by 'Microsoft Netmeeting', or AIM etc? Thanks in advance!!! yog HTTP Tunneling is designed for Secure HTTP (HTTPS). 
A HTTP tunneling is a method of going through a proxy server, without the proxy server itself handling any data transmitted. 
A tunnel can be established with the connect method: CONNECT host : port HTTP/1.1 CRLF If the HTTP return code is 200 (OK), a connection is established. 
Now any data transmitted is directly forwarded (by the proxy server) to the end-point. 
Take note that most proxy server will only allow tunnels to port 443 (HTTPS), due to security restrictions. 
So they're not usable for anything else than HTTPS. 
Some proxy servers (like the ISA server) can be configured to interfrere with the data on the tunnel. 
Contact the Proxy manual of admin. 
- Joris Somewhat, however you don't understand tunneling concept to well. 
There is a difference between proxying and tunneling: While acting as a proxy, you send a request to the proxy server, the same as you whould send to the orgin server. 
The proxy server can modify/change the request (even deny it or get it from cache). 
A tunnel will establish a connection from you to the other end-point (orgin server). 
This tunnel can be established through one one (or more) proxy server(s), who should not inferfere with the information send through the tunnel. 
To you it looks just like a normal TCP connection from you to the other end-point (actual end server). 
Some more background: tunneling was needed to establish a secure channel between two end-points. 
The property of a secure channel is that nobody, except the end-points, can send data over it and optionally cannot read it. 
Both is the case with HTTPS. 
- Joris Cheers.
