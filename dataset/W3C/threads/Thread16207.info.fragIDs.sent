<s> XML can (and should) be used for many things - using XML for this purpose does not "Hijack" XML standards - it is just using XML in a new way.  </s>
<s> Yes, XML can be used to format data that can then be presented on a web page.  </s>
<s> But it can also be used for: Data Exchange between businesses Database storage Inter-application communication and many other purposes that haven't even been thought of yet.  </s>
<s> Basically, some developers at Microsoft saw a need to be able to package scripts in a more reusable form.  </s>
<s> They could have come up with a proprietary way of 'wrapping' the information that clients of scripts need, but they decided to use an open and extensible standard (XML) to do that instead.  </s>
<s> The sky is not falling, and Microsoft is certainly not pulling it down!  </s>
<s> p.s. - Microsoft did not 'cause' your impugned lack of accessibility to computers any more than any other company, and I wish you would stop saying so.  </s>
<s> You could just as easily blame Apple - they had the first successful GUI.  </s>
<s> Or Xerox - they had the idea for the GUI.  </s>
<s> Microsoft just happens to be the company that has developed the most successful GUI in the marketplace.  </s>
<s> The people on the ADG team at Microsoft are very passionate about what they do, and feel like they are doing good things that are advancing the state of  </s>
<s> the art.  </s>
<s> If you wish to belittle their efforts, or look down on their pride in their accomplishments, please do so after you have done more than they have.  </s>

<s> Using XML in this way does make it proprietary.  </s>
<s> XML is designed for all the stuff you mention, but why should scripts be a *part* of the  </s>
<s> XML document?  </s>
<s> I mean what are applets and parsers for?  </s>
<s> OK, I was going to leave tech politics out of this.  </s>

<s> On the other hand, it's not acceptable to raise perfectly valid concerns about the world's largest software company?  </s>
<s> They do the bare minimum that should be required of such a company, and then they act like they are saviours and release dozens of press releases when they do things for accessibility.  </s>
<s> They act like they are doing users a  </s>

<s> Well, they should HAVE to do all of this.  </s>
<s> Apple don't try to claim they are doing much about accessibility, they don't try to get PR from it, and they have always shipped speech synthesis and recognition with their OS, unlike Microsoft.  </s>
<s> Anyway, I'm not trying to defend them.  </s>
<s> I just think it's interesting that rather than  </s>
<s> dealing with these issues, you want to look for a scapegoat.  </s>
<s> I just  </s>
<s> want these things dealt with, whether it is with MSFT, Apple, or Adobe.  </s>
<s> Microsoft aren't doing anyone a favour, but they act like it.  </s>
<s> Microsoft are the major influence on the inaccessibility of the web, and the majority of the world's computers.  </s>
<s> Their desire to knock off Netscape caused years of degradation of the W3C standards.  </s>
<s> OK, this  </s>
<s> is no joke, that IE browser war made the internet a miserable place to be.  </s>
<s> MS sabotaged Java with Active X.  </s>
<s> I could go on, but you get the idea.  </s>
<s> As far as Windows go, it's hardly usable by non-impaired users, let  </s>
<s> alone the disabled.  </s>
<s> Just look at the ridiculous number of clicks it takes just to do simple things.  </s>
<s> Look at the illogical and verbose dialog boxes, with corresponding nonsensical options.  </s>
<s> It's a usability nightmare.  </s>
<s> Many ordinary office workers go into panic at  </s>
<s> the thought of using a computer, because of Windows.  </s>
<s> I'm sure the ADG team feel that they are pushing the state of the art, but that's just a hallucination.  </s>
<s> Why do they have to fill themselves with rhetoric?  </s>
<s> It's not really about 'pushing the state of the art' anyway.  </s>
<s> It's about standards.  </s>
<s> Why can't they just admit that accessibility is a basic thing, and they are not our saviours, just because they are trying to iron out problems which shouldn't be there in the first place?  </s>
<s> Maybe they are 'good guys', but no matter how good they are, we both know that they would never have the power or  </s>
<s> the inclination to stand up to the rest of Microsoft.  </s>
<s> Sure, they can fix a few problems here and there, but the overwhelming majority of Microsoft is moving away from accessibility.  </s>
<s> For the ADG to really do their job, they have to attack the problem at it's roots.  </s>
<s> Anyone who knows how Microsoft internal culture works, will know that that's  </s>
<s> never going to happen, and the ADG are just as marginalised as anyone else.  </s>
<s> I don't care how passionate they are, can they do the job properly?  </s>
<s> This thing with scripts in XML shows that they have little influence, or are unaware of the bigger picture.  </s>
<s> Another thing.  </s>
<s> Linux is probably the best OS for accessibility.  </s>
<s> Now, if you've seen the MS "Halloween" documents, you will know how Microsoft wants to destroy Linux, which is a better solution for the disabled than Microsoft could ever be.  </s>

<s> You are an ex Microsoft employee, and I don't trust a single word that comes out of Redmond unless it is independently verified.  </s>
<s> Microsoft are the biggest liars and hypocrites this side of a totalitarian state.  </s>
<s> Gates has recently been  </s>
<s> making totally dishonest and false statements to the media.  </s>
<s> Unfortunately, the media doesn't have the guts to call him a liar.  </s>
<s> I don't think the sky is falling, and I can see how you operate - trying to paint anyone who has a divergent opinion as a hysterical anti-Microsoft 'nutcase'.  </s>
<s> I'm just concerned about a serious issue.  </s>
<s> I  </s>
<s> don't think the sky is falling, I just think MSFT is a definite  </s>
<s> threat to the future of accessible technology.  </s>
<s> David  </s>
<s> The genie is out of the bottle.  </s>
<s> People are writing web applications in a mix of declarative HTML or XML quasi-static stuff and imperative-language (i.e. not adequately declarative) overlays that change all that.  </s>
<s> The result is not safe for disability access adapted modes of interaction.  </s>
<s> The threat to accessibility is the fact that if we try to say "don't use scripts" we stand about the same chance as when King Canute decreed to the sea that the tide should not rise.  </s>
<s> Wrapping the script stuff in XML may be hostile, neutral, or friendly to the objective of making the script stuff civil as far as disability access is concerned.  </s>
<s> We don't know.  </s>
<s> We need to take the initiative to analyze the functions performed by the scripts, assert what is needed in terms of declarative meta-function so that this functionality can be morphed appropriately in adaptive UI variants, and steer our commentary on script-in-XML etc. based on that analysis.  </s>
<s> Only then will we actually be useful in steering technology into a "accessible by construction" place.  </s>
<s> Scripting is already the de_facto norm or standard, and it is presently not civil, in the sense that it provides enough morphing support to serve disability access modes successfully and effectively.  </s>
<s> Don't blame scripting on Microsoft.  </s>
<s> They have encouraged this development, but only because they listened to their customers.  </s>
<s> And they are only the biggest fish in the school encouraging this development.  </s>
<s> Not a unique voice making it happen.  </s>
<s> If we can point the way to accessible scripting practices, including how it gets blended or connected with XML, Microsoft will be there among others bringing resources to bear to examine the proposals and if they make sense, implement them.  </s>
<s> Whatever you personally think of Sun, Adobe, Microsoft, et_al., to be effective advocates of the disability interest we cannot affort to demonize any of them or fail to constructively engage with them in the search for an objective, all-are-winners solution to this puzzle.  </s>
<s> All the same reasons that make Microsoft the biggest imaginable pain when they are being a pain, make them the biggest imaginable help when they are being a help.  </s>
<s> Whether they are being pain or help, is, mirabile_dictu, to some degree under the control of the professional attitude we exhibit as we approach the dialog.  </s>

<s> I'm sorry for ranting.  </s>
