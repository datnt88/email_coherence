Hello, I hope this question is not too basic for this discussion group. 
I have read the DAV spec and browsed through the mail archive of this mail list but did not find an answer to the following question: Why has the lock-token to be universaly unique? 
Because it is a property that can be queried by any person, beeing in the state of posessing a universaly unique token does not provide me with a special privileges per se. 
If I understood the spec thats why you have to authenticate yourself to make use of a lock-token. 
But than, why use a token at all. 
Woulde'nt it suffice that the server registers who has taken a lock on the locked ressource (for example with the public key of the lock-owner) and require anybody who wants to perform "critical" operations on the locked ressource to verify his/her identity. 
Thanks in advance for helping me, regards Stefan Schlee / TI[con] See RFC 2518, section 7.6. 
It describes why lock tokens are needed to prevent overwrite behavior from two or more clients that are being run by the same authenticated user.

Thanks in advance for helping me, regards Stefan Schlee / TI[con] Schlee, Section 7 of RFC2518 describes the locking semantics and provides motivation for both lock tokens, and why they need to be unique. 
Briefly, lock tokens need to be unique so that there is never a chance of applying a lock token to the wrong resource. 
The reason the principal id isn't sufficient is that the same principal may have multiple concurrent processes running at the same time. 
Lock tokens provide a way of managing concurrent updates for the same user in these situations.
