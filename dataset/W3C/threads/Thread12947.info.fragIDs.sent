<s> Hi everybody, As I already said some week ago, web accessibility is not only related to people with disabilities.  </s>
<s> At least, not only!  </s>
<s> Web accessibility should be referred to each web user; each web user ahould be able to use a web site, to find an information, to surf the web; every one, including people with disabilities!  </s>
<s> When I'm at home, I'm used to navigate using an ADSL connection, but when I travel, I often have to connect with the analogical modem in my notebook...  </s>
<s> So I have many problems I do not have with fast connections.  </s>
<s> And this happens to everyone who has an old computer, or an old modem, or an old line.  </s>
<s> That's a good example about everybody's disabilities, on technological disabilities... And this example can fit to each of us, to each web surfer, regardless of his eventual disability.  </s>
<s> In my opinion, all WCAG guidelines are designed to prevent frustration in all of us, as all of us can have some kind of disabilities (phisical, cognitive, technological, social, and so on) and such disabilities can came and go in a minute, in a day, in a life...  </s>
<s> The web is for everyone, and so WCAG are.  </s>

<s> Per conto di Alistair Garrison Inviato: domenica 14 dicembre 2003 18.55 A: EOWG Oggetto: Web Accessibility Definition... Dear All, Did we agree a definition for Web Accessibility... If we didn't the definition I am going to start to use is... "Web Accessibility is the process of making Web content in a way that can be used, without issue or consequence, by people with disabilities."  </s>
<s> This follows on from the definition of 'accessible' found in Glossary B of WCAG 1.0 (i.e. 'Content is accessible when it may be used by someone with a disability'), and the fact that several checkpoints in the Guidelines are designed to prevent , or in severe circumstances harm (i.e. flashing content).Web  </s>

<s> This is something that we have discussed many times in EOWG and other parts of WAI.  </s>
<s> Given that the requirements of people with disabilities are so often overlooked when one is addressing the needs of "all" users, WAI does, in fact, focus specifically on accessibility of the Web for people with disabilities and for others such as elderly who sometimes have related functional requirements, but may or may not consider themselves "disabled."  </s>
<s> However, the business case supporting Web accessibility is indeed very broad, and includes many benefits to non-disabled as well as to disabled users.  </s>
<s> The example that you cite -- having only a low-bandwidth connection, while using a dial-up modem, and therefore benefitting from certain aspects of accessible design -- is a good example of an "auxiliary benefit" of Web accessibility.  </s>
<s> There are many such examples, and this is why the business case for Web accessibility is so broad.  </s>
<s> You say "all WCAG guidelines are designed to prevent frustration in all of us, ..." To clarify this, WCAG guidelines are designed to meet the requirements of people with disabilities; but they have the additional benefit of increasing usability for all users.  </s>

<s> Hi Judy, Hi group I know you're completely right, on each point.  </s>
<s> I was just viewing the situation as a teacher (I work as a IT utacher since 15 years) and as a divulgator: if our aim is to reach the largest amount of people and to explain how accessibility can be important for the whole Web, then we may try and focalize everyone attention on web universality; so we may increase the effectiveness of our documents.  </s>
<s> I get so angry when some people say: "People with disabilities are a small precentage of web users, so why should we base our investiments on a small minority?";  </s>
<s> maybe, one way of fighting and defeating this silly convinction is showing how accessibility is fundamental for the web, not only for people with disabilities' web.  </s>
<s> And in my personal exeperiences, it seems working great; when I speak about accessibility founding my lessons and speeches on this concept, I realize that I can capture audience's attention and consent much more than speaking only about people with disabilities.  </s>
