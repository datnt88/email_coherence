- [later] blossom: work on visual design Hi all Some thoughts about our use of personas thus far - following are references to pages which discuss these points far more elequently and knowledgebly than I can (they are also concise so worth a read). 
* Numbers and lack of priority: I am concerned that we are losing focus a bit with our personas - part of that concern comes from our 'difficulty' with prioritising - but lets not go there. 
The net result is we have too many personas such that we cannot realistically focus on them because it is too much information to absorb. 
We need to be able to speak about them in a common currency - about issues that will face them rather than our assumptions about a certain class of user - that's the point of them. 
When debating/deciding design issues/design impacts etc. we need to be able to say 'joe smith would need that because...'. 
The personas need to be well known (not necessarily loved) by us all. 
Can we prioritise a bit? 
To some extent our design impacts analysis thus far has thrown some light on this (primary characteristics here could be incorporated into a primary persona). 
Can we at least prioritise based on material available in the site - different interface (even tone) depending on the role of the content? 
* Too politically correct - not specific enough? 
Another issue concerns our attempting to be to inclusive, which impacts on the specificity of the personas we produce and therefore potentially their value. 
Perhaps we are being too politically correct - we need these to be a tool to make a better interface/site which will improve the experience for everybody. 
Specificity will help us get to the crux of the matter. 
Getting the interface right for one user and meeting their goals (see next) will permit us to abstract to others. 
Remember these are design tools to help not hinder us. 
* Overly task based - need to consider goals At present our personas are largely task based - we should make them more goals based - this will help us make the correct user centric decisions. 
We already have an in-depth task analysis - the personas should not replicate this. 
Goals should be personal and it should be our job to meet them. 
E.g. A goal might be increase job prospects and professional status - the tasks to do this might be multiple and include: gaining in-depth knowledge of technical accessibility issues, becoming involved with the WAI, becoming an source of knowledge about the wider issues. 
The goals act like heuristics we can use to keep the big picture in mind (seeing the wood despite the trees). 
See the refs for more on this. 
* Names I think we should be consistent and we should use both first and second names (I agree with Blossom) - we want to get to know these people - its another instance of specificity.

A general description/introduction to personas (from the cooper stable) Enough from me for now Cheers Jon Thanks, Jon! Actually, lets do. 
I'll add it to the agenda for the next meeting. 
(Charmane, you can hold off editing that section until after our next discussion.) PERSONA WRITERS: Could you take a stab at revising your persona to be more specific and goal based? 
Any chance of sending that to the list today or tomorrow? 
That's at least two votes for. 
Any against? 
Please reply to the list this week if at all possible!
