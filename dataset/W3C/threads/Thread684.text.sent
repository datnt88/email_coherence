?Hello: 
How to use JTidy parsing non-ISO8859-1 charset HTML document just like MS950 (Chinese Traditional) ? 
You may not be able to do it directly, *however* you can do it indirectly. 
Convert the raw document into text using the appropriate charset encoding - and then convert it to UTF and pass the result to JTidy, telling it that you are using UTF. 
I've sent him a version wich supports CN-Big5. 
Actually the offered approach do not work fine with the mentioned encoding as some BIG5- Unicode- BIG5 translations give result different from original document. 
BR VA It can not.

If I set the encoding to utf8 it work fine but I wonder if maybe JTidy could do it automatically ? 
It could detect the charset part of the meta content attribute and change his configuration ?
