Hello, Win95,pentium,1.2GB,32 MB RAM 
I was viewing a FRAMESET based HTML page in Amaya1.4. 
Inside the FRAMESET tag an H1 tag had crept in. 
The file was not written using Amaya and I am just using it to view it. 
Unfortunately, the H1 tag is recognised inside FRAMESET. 
I checked the grammar specified in HTML.S file. 
H1 is not defined inside FRAMSET. 
I dont know about IE, but Netscape4.04 does not allow this. 
The parser should enforce the grammar to some extent and should not allow such blatant abberrations and reject the tag. 
Another classical case is allowing INPUT tag without an enclosing FORM tag. 
I checked for TABLE related tags, some degree of checking has been hard coded 
to ContextOK() of html2thot.c 
file 
I dont think this is the right way of grammar enforcement, since the whole 
purpose(as i see it) of having a '.S' and '.STR' file is to make the code independent of the grammar to a large exent. 
What is the reason for a very liberal grammar enforcement? 
BTW I am an ardent fan of Amaya. 
I really enjoyed using Compiler application 
given in amaya1.4 
Good error messages are given when compiling "HTML.S". 
It helped a lot!! Eagerly waiting for the goodies in Amaya1.5

This is legal, because it can be used by Javascript.

You could also have checked the SGML DTD for HTML 4.0: as both the DTD and the HTML.S file define the same structure. 
You are right: a FRAMESET element cannot contain an H1 element as a child. 
The only safe reference I know is the HTML 4.0 specification: 
In principle, you are right. 
But Amaya has to cope with existing Web pages, and, as you know, very few of them validate against the HTML DTD. 
When designing Amaya, we were faced with a difficult choice: (1) adopt a strict position and reject all invalid pages. 
Most users would be very disapointed not to be able to see mainy pages that other Web clients can display; (2) accept invalid pages and let Amaya fix the most common bugs. 
We took position (2) and decided that Amaya should try to fix bugs, but without losing information. 
If an element is not valid in a given context, Amaya tries to change the structure locally to make that element valid, but it doesn't delete the element or move it to a different place, which could change its meaning. 
That's why the H1 element is kept in the FRAMESET. 
Another important design decision that has been made for Amaya is that, even 
if it accepts invalid documents, the structure and markup that it produces is always valid. 
Obviously, only elements created or changed by Amaya itself 
are concerned here. 
Some invalid parts of the original document may remain when the document is saved. 
W3C has also developed a validator that allows you to check documents. 
Have a look at: You could also use HTML tidy to fix erroneous documents: 
This is an example of these errors that Amaya tries to recover. 
If the structure of a table is wrong, Amaya can not edit it. 
For that reason, it applies some tranformations that make the structure correct. 
The issue is that a DTD or a .S file only specifies the structure of a document class, not its semantics. 
When you consider an invalid document, there are often several ways to transform its structure to make it valid, but each transformation may have a different impact on the document semantics. 
The DTD of .S file does not allow you to choose the right transformation. 
A specific piece of code is then needed. 
See above. 
Thanks for your support.

Hello. Thank u for providing valuable insights to design decisions. 
I have been trying to modify the HTML.S file to get a cut down version of tags and attributes to be recognised by Amaya. 
The new HTML.S is now compiled to HTML.STR and HTML.H using the compiler.exe. 
I have also cut down the respective tags and attributes from HTML.A also. 
I then use the new HTML.STR and HTML.h when building the Amaya. 
There seems to be some problems. 
When parsing and this part of code is reached in tree.c 
case CsIdentity: /* structure is the same as that defined by another rule of the */ /* same scheme */ create = FALSE; pSRule2 = &amp;pSS- SsRule[pSRule- SrIdentRule - 1]; if (pSRule2- SrParamElem || pSRule2- SrAssocElem || pSRule2- SrConstruct == CsBasicElement || pSRule2- SrNInclusions  0 || pSRule2- SrNExclusions  0 || pSRule2- SrConstruct == CsConstant || pSRule2- SrConstruct == CsChoice || pSRule2- SrConstruct == CsPairedElement || pSRule2- SrConstruct == CsReference || pSRule2- SrConstruct == CsNatureSchema) create = TRUE; t1 = NewSubtree (pSRule- SrIdentRule, pSS, pDoc, assocNum, Desc, create, withAttr, withLabel); if (pEl == NULL) pEl = t1; else InsertFirstChild (pEl, t1); break; it goes into infinite recursion by calling NewSubtree () function with the typenum parameter=0. 
Any insights will be appreciated.

You need to maintain a certain coherence between the HTML.S, HMTMP.P, HTMLT.T HTML.A and the Amaya. 
There is a document (http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-amaya-970220.html) which explains the architecture of Amaya and can help if you want to make some change in Amaya. 
The bug you reported is due to a call with typenum parameter=0. 
I suspect that your html2thot.c file is inconsistent with your new version of HTML.S. Irene.
