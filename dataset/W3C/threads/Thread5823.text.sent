Overall I think Owl looks good. 
Some Specific comments follow. 
Feature Synopsis specific comments: Recommend reducing references to DAML+OIL in OWL Feature-Synopsis document. 
All warnings and limitations should be listed in the owl document. 
Owl-lite struck me as not such a good idea. 
Not sure about the name especially. 
Maybe change owl-lite to owl 1.0 and owl to owl 2.0 beta. 
Overall I think the goal is to use owl and have owl-lite as a stepping stone for tool developers/user communities. 
"Lite" to me implies a choice of necessary features rather than a stepping stone. 
Owl version 1.0 would imply eventual movement to higher conformance. 
The use of Individual for "objects that belong to classes" while semantically correct leads very easily to confusion with its definition pertaining particularly to people. 
The confusion is further reinforced by the use of people in the examples in the Feature Synopsis. 
I favor the use of the word "Object" but other potential words to use instead of Individual are: Item, Thing, Entity, Occurrence, Singleton, Solitare. 
In the Feature Synopsis under the individual description. 
A statement says to see the reference description document for the exact syntax for defining individuals. 
This statement should apply to the exact syntax for all owl syntax and should be generalized and moved to a more appropriate location. 
Section 1. Third paragraph. 
4th sentence, add missing as, should read: While it is widely appreciated that all of the features in languages such as DAML+OIL Section 3.3 Transitive Property first paragraph, last sentence missing final parenthesis. 
Section 3.3 Functional Property first sentence, add missing a, should read: Properties may be stated to have a unique value. 
Section 3.3 Functional Property fourth sentence, strike extra is, should read: This has been referred to as a unique value. 
Section 3.3 SomeValuesFrom last sentence, add missing period. 
Section 3.6 More information is needed on what it means to import something. 
If Ontology A only wishes to use term T from Ontology B does Ontology A have to import Ontology B. What if Ontology B also contains terms that conflict with Ontology A or the author of Ontology A does not agree with? 
Section 4. Union Of Example contains a subclass instead of being a direct complementOf relation. 
Section 5. Summary. 
There should be an appendix to the Feature Synopsis showing the owl for all the examples given. 
Abstrat Syntax specific comments Section 1. Paragraph 4 first Sentence. 
Seems to be in Conflict with the presence of Section 6 in the document. 
Section 1.2 First stance: I think order is a very fundamental thing and should be treated as a first class issue and not left out. 
The consequences of the decision will be users inventing individual solutions. 
Section 3 First Paragraph, last sentence, substitute an for a, should read: associated with an ontology. 
Section 3 Second Paragraph, first sentence, add missing an, should read: which is a URI reference. 
Section 3 Second Paragraph, second sentence, spelling error, should read: wherever possible. 
Section 5 First Paragraph Sentence 1. States Owl and Owl-Lite have been the same so far but "nothing" has been mentioned and is only present in Owl-Lite. 
Section 5 Fourth Paragraph Sentence 1. Symmetric is not listed. 
Section 5.1.3 Paragraph 3. The words don't seem to match up with the axiom. 
The words seem to "group and or" symmetric, functional and inverseFunctional but the axiom seems to "group and or" functional, inverseFunctional and Transitive. 
Section 5.3.3 
Shouldn't the third cardinality line have max-cardinality be a positive-integer. 
Otherwise this seems to allow min max where max=0. 
Shouldn't there be a statement additionally that states that min  max. 
Section 5.2.4 should be Section 5.3.4. 
Section 6 DataType Property. 
Transformation lists owl:uniqueProperty should be owl:FunctionalProperty? 
OWL Web Ontology Language specific comments: Section 1, Different Syntactic Forms, Fourth Sentence, change singular to plural, should read: Such other syntactic forms ... Section 2 No mention of authoship-etc from Dublin-Core. 
Section 2 Class Elements: disjointUnionOf not in AbstractSyntax or Feature Synopsis Section 2 Class Expressions: Should the boolean combination be rdfs:class or owl:class tags? 
Section 2 Property Restriction. 
First Paragraph, last sentence, missing Object, should read: neither object restrictions nor datatype Restrictions. 
Section 2 Property Restriction. 
Last Paragraph, Second Sentence, substitute importance for import, should read: ...there should be some semantic importance. 
Appendix A contains equivalentTo which I think is struck from the features in Abstract Syntax Section 1.2 Stance Appendix A contains disjointUnionOf which I think was also struck. 
Still contains equivalentTo which I think is struck from the features in Abstract Syntax Section 1.2 Stance 4. SameClassAs, SamePropertyAs and SameIndividualAs are defined using Equivalent To. Comment for Ontology should read for communication between and among... Still contain disjointUnionOf which is not in AbstractSyntax or Feature Synopsis. 
The comments above are my own. 
Any that sound personal are. 
Any that sound technical can be attributed to my company if they will have them.

I've elided other portions of your message; many of theses will probably be dealt with by the other editors.

Subject: OWL working drafts - feedback Date: Thu, 5 Sep 2002 22:27:19 -0400 A very good point. 
I'm going to bring this up for consideration by the Working Group. 
Yes, in some sense. 
Section 6 was added later. 
I've revised the paragraph to claim no ``definition'' of the exchange syntax. 
Agreed, but order is difficult to incorporate, particularly as RDF is essentially unordered. 
The issue does remain as an issue for the working group. 
OK, I'll make these changes. 
:-) Good reading, by the way. 
This used to be true, but the document was reordered a bit. 
Thanks for noticing. 
Another good catch. 
This is partly by design, as the full conditions on when a property can be transitive are mentioned in the next paragraph. 
The ``or'' in the wording does not mean ``at most one of''. 
However, I found a better way of saying the same thing, which happens to match the axiom better. 
It is possible to state minCardinality=5 maxCardinality=4. 
There will be no instances of the restriction but this is not an error. 
It doesn't help to rule this out syntactically. 
Maximum cardinality of 0 even more acceptable, as all it is stating is that instances of the restriction have no values for the property. 
This is needed for definitions like bachelor, a man with no wife. 
Actually 5.3.3 should be 5.2.3. 
Yes, this was an oversight as the name was changed some time ago. 
I can see and agree with the rationale of allowing me to specify properties with no values. 
My uneasiness should have been better expressed as, "Why the positive-integer restriction of minCardinality?". 
Maybe what is missing is more description of the rational on the cardinality definitions in the document both under OWL and OWL-LITE. 
5.1.2 does not seem to allow for minCardinality 0 | maxCardinality 0 | minCardinality 1 maxCadinality 0. If this is correct I think it should be spelled out in the text of the abstract Syntax document as well as some of the other documents that seem to specify only that the cardinality descriptors are restricted to 0 or 1. 5.3.3/5.2.3 allows cardinality 0 under cardinality as a non-negative-integer but not minCardinality 0 under minCardinality as a positive-integer. 
If cardinality 0 is expanded out to minCardinality 0 maxCardinality 0. This seems to imply minCardinality can have a value of 0 but only if maxCardinality is also 0. Again this is ok but should definetly be spelled out if this is correct. 
Also of slight note is that the http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl document has all the cardinalities listed as non-negative integers. 
Pat a It is possible to state minCardinality=5 maxCardinality=4. 
There will be no instances of the restriction but this is not an error.

Maximum cardinality of 0 even more acceptable, as all it is stating is that instances of the restriction have no values for the property.

Subject: RE: OWL working drafts - feedback Date: Mon, 9 Sep 2002 10:42:58 -0400 Hmm. 
This may be a bit of a bug. 
minCardinality(0) is a null restriction - it has no effect. 
This could be. 
It is most probably an issue for either the Feature Synopsis or the Reference document. 
In conjunction with this explicit allowance of minCardinality(0), the restriction to positive integer is certainly a bug. 
I'll change it. 
Thanks for picking up this divergence between the various documents. 
peter No problem. 
You all did excellent work. 
I was only able to pick out the questions and issues I had because all the documents were very readable and they all did a good job describing the same underlying language.
