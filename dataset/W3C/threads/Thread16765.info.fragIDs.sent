<s> The "W3C" is centred, taking approximately one third of the space, and is followed by a small (about one quarter font size) symbol that this is a registered mark - in this case the symbol of a capital letter "R" enlosed in a circle, in black.  </s>

<s> I don't know what conformance level is being talked about here.  </s>
<s> However, it seems to me that to conform to this level you have to have the resources of a prime time television production company and that your audience needs to have TV type bandwidth (and you must have many times that bandwidth).  </s>
<s> Even to do this legally is going to cost huge amounts of time and considerable money in obtaining copyright clearances, trademark clearances, (without prejudice to their legal necessesity) permissions to link to sites, recording engineers fees, etc. (A large number of amateur sites are almost certainly in breach of intellectual property rights in the illustrative material they use, but W3C cannot officially countenance such breaches.)  </s>
<s> As I say, you are talking of TV programme production costs, not even just magazine article production costs.  </s>
<s> Even relatively traditional media is poor at illustrating concepts; they are much more likely to use an easy to obtain stock photograph to illustrate easy features, basically as eye candy, than to commission new material for the really difficult bits.  </s>
<s> As quoted, there also seems to be an indication of putting everything immediately on display on the page.  </s>
<s> This seems to me to be the opposite of the fundamental web concept, which is that you link to material.  </s>
<s> Once you link to material, you can use other people's material (but note that the cover story for one e-business magazine here in the UK, this week, is that commercial sites are afraid of linking even to home pages, because of the legal risks involved).  </s>
<s> This is ear candy.  </s>
<s> It's unlikely to meet the requirement of adding understanding.  </s>
<s> It's also sort of thing that a glossy site producer would do without prompting if the perceived technical, financial and time scale constraints permitted it.  </s>
<s> By perceived technical constraints, I include the need to use HTML; HTML was not designed as a multimedia language and should only be used to link together true multimedia (computer) lnaguages, where they are needed.  </s>
<s> To a non-literate, user, the sound carries the message "might be a barbecue", whereas even a picture would carry the equivalent of many words of much higher quality information (if it was a picture of the event, not a stock picture).  </s>
<s> I'd say the sizzling sound has more to do with maintainig the "viewer's" attention and pure entertainment, than to actually communicating.  </s>
<s> That again is something that advertising agencies do without prompting.  </s>
<s> This is still going to put you into a high risk area with respect to intellectual property rights.  </s>
<s> The copyright owners may not be prepared to license the use of reduced quality material, or may only be prepared to license it (one service offering aerial photographs of the UK, will only grant a licence for web use if the quality of the image is degraded; this is a paid licence, which is stiil too expensive for amateur use).  </s>
<s> Also, and noting that I am not a lawyer, because the ability to include sound was limited to a few organisations until recently, I doubt that there is much case law on what constitutes "fair use" (a concept that is not well defined at the best of times).  </s>
<s> One of the "fair use" permissions (UK at least) is for criticism and review, but I'm not sure that a clip simply to identify the material would fall under that permission and what is permissible for more explicit criticism and review probably hasn't been well defined yet.  </s>
<s> It's also possible that using low quality material might compromise a "fair use" defence.  </s>

<s> What I would hope for is some sort of compromise in which sites must actively indicate++ that a page may not be deep linked before there is any protection.  </s>
<s> I would hope that home page linking could be made something that couldn't be excluded, but I could see, for example, the band wanting the ability to prevent links to its site from critical sites, or sites incompatible with their image.  </s>

<s> Refer based methods are vulnerable to forgery and cause conflicts with privacy requirements as some people use bogus Referer headers, or none at all, to prevent click trailing.  </s>

<s> The meta data must be delivered at the HTTP level (although many people seem unaware of how to set HTTP meta data) because the resource may not be HTML (e.g. it may be a sound file).  </s>
