<s> Hello All:  </s>
<s> I have been following the byte range discussions with much interest.  </s>
<s> What I propose is that instead of byte ranges, that a concept like time code be utilized to control media on the web.  </s>
<s> Traditional time code has the form:  </s>
<s> hours:minutes:seconds:frames I propose that this be augmented with, for example, the following information: URL:filename:hours:minutes:seconds:frames This would allow the HTML creator to determine what frames to be played from a video or audio stream.  </s>
<s> As for text information the author could determine that each page is a frame for example.  </s>
<s> The text creator would then determine the range of pages to send.  </s>
<s> I am proposing the use of time code because I feel the HTTP server should be viewed as a media server as opposed to a byte stream server.  </s>
<s> If it is considered in this fashion then the HTTP media server coupled with a time code based access mechanism could become much integrated with content creation.  </s>
<s> For example, content creators could go straight from non-linear edit systems to the web.  </s>
<s> Comments ?  </s>

<s> What we really need (to repeat), is a general addressing mechanism similar to that offered by HyTime.  </s>
<s> If we continually reinvent addressing schemes with different syntaxes, it makes supporting all the various syntaxes a real headache.  </s>
<s> One general (and extensible) syntax is far more preferrable.  </s>
<s> Not that I am arguing for adoption of the syntax...  </s>
<s> It seems there at least a couple of questions that can be addressed separately:  </s>
<s> 1. Should there be one uniform syntax for addressing sub-parts of "structured resources" independently of the content-type?  </s>
<s> 2. Should this addressing scheme go into URLs or elsewhere?  </s>
<s> On (1), I find it hard to imagine that it is possible to predict in advance what kinds of parameters, ranges, subspaces, sets, regions, chapters, verses, etc. are going to be needed to describe this in a world of increasing numbers of content-types, so unless someone can demonstrate a sufficiently general design, I suspect this is impractical.  </s>
<s> On (2), since there is little guarantee of an association between a URL and any particular data type, and decreasingly so a content-negotiated world, I think it is a mistake to tie sub-part addressing into URLs.  </s>
<s> It would seem that requests for sub-part  </s>
<s> addressing would have to be tied to specific content-types in the request.  </s>
<s> Yes, which is precisely what HyTime does.  </s>
<s> I can do the same thing in LISP.  </s>
<s> I cannot imagine a way to define a general adressing scheme without also making the addresses almost impossible to remember though... in an ideal world, one would not see most of these links "in the raw" anyway.  </s>
<s> I tend to agree.  </s>
<s> Hi Again: I think the central issue here is where the concept of media is handled.  </s>
<s> If the HTTP server is considered as a media server then it must have the facilities to deal with media.  </s>
<s> Time code is the language of the professional media creators.  </s>
<s> Therefore given the web's ever increasing consumption of media it would have to deal with time code.  </s>
<s> However if the server is still viewed as a byte stream server then this would push the responsibilty for dealing with media out to the clients; ie, browsers and any tools they use.  </s>
<s> Either way there has to be a richer media control mechanism than byte ranges.  </s>
<s> I think time code is it.  </s>
<s> For me the important issue becomes which end handles it.  </s>
<s> The only problem with having it in the client is that it requires every client to understand the data format.  </s>
<s> What happens when a new data format is invented, or when a client wants frame 1 of an MPEG movie in GIF form, because it doesn't have the code locally for handling MPEG?  </s>
<s> I think the central issue here is where the concept of media is handled.  </s>
<s> If the HTTP server is considered as a media server then it must have the facilities to deal with media.  </s>
<s> We've had this discussion at least once before.  </s>
<s> I firmly believe that HTTP should NOT be used for real-time continuous media.  </s>
<s> The URL mechanism allows us to include multiple transport protocols (e.g., HTTP, FTP, Gopher) in the web, and if we want to include real-time continuous, then we should use a protocol optimized for that.  </s>
<s> We should not try to turn HTTP into a kitchen-sink protocol, making it into a second-rate media protocol while also making it harder to implement.  </s>
<s> As a purely practical matter, this working group is chartered to work on IETF standards, which normally require "rough consensus and working code" to progress.  </s>
<s> We would be in relatively uncharted territory when it comes to real-time continuous media, which is still the subject of active research and debate.  </s>
<s> It would be quite premature to try to standardize this kind of thing, especially in the context of the most heavily-used protocol protocol in today's Internet.  </s>
<s> -Jeff  </s>
<s> I'll second this, and point out that the Upgrade header field in the draft of HTTP/1.1 is designed to allow changes in application protocol when the server wants to send a resource with these characteristics.  </s>
<s> ...Roy T. Fielding Department of Information &amp; Computer Science (fielding@ics.uci.edu)  </s>
<s> One major point in making HTTP more supportive of media communication such as this is that a significant number of users will be utilitizing proxies.  </s>
<s> Each new protocol must be handled by the proxy, and if you only have an HTTP proxy, you are out of luck.  </s>
<s> The media would not have to be served in real-time.  </s>
<s> Rather I envision the first pass providing the ability to provide users with richer access to media via mechanisms like time code.  </s>
<s> I don't think including a more media friendly mechansim would make http a kitchen-sink protocol.  </s>
<s> It could make it more powerful to work with media which would ultimately permit a richer communications environment.  </s>
