Hello All, 1. 
I propose that we rechristen the Economics Factors page as Business Factors page (the name of the suite can just be Making a Case for Web Accessibility) I have attempted a complete re-write of the "Economic" Factors page and wonder if there is support for the way I am putting it together. 
What follows is the start ... I am half way through the benefits section and have the costs section to do. 
I am hoping you have a chance to run through it before the meeting. 
Thanks for your time Sailesh Business factors An org's efforts to make its website accessible can impact its profitability and return on investment. 
Many of the factors described on other pages of this document have a bearing on costs and benefits that can be expressed in financial terms. 
The extent will vary from org to org and will need to be assessed in each case. 
Assessing benefits involves examining impact on: revenues, customer / audience reach, goodwill, saving in costs of Web content development / deployment / QA processes, lowered technological and legal risks Assessing costs involves examining impact on: Cost of initial Website analysis, cost of technology needed to implement modifications in Web accessibility,Web content development / deployment / QA processes and hiring / training staff. 
1. Quantifying Benefits: 1.1.Measuring impact on revenues, customer / audience reach, goodwill It will be very helpful to track website statistics that reveal : - number of hits on account of improved "searchability" of the website, average time a visitor remains on the site and number of pages he / she visits, - number of transactions successfully completed over the website, - number of cusstomers prefering to access support related content on the website, and - number of customers returning to the website to access content / conduct transactions. 
It is important to recognize that the benefits of an accessible website can be direct as well as indirect. 
Hence, the above indicators are likely to register a change over time as an accessible website enhances a website's overall usability. 
Surveys and customer responses too will be useful in estimating the increased number of computer access technology users / people with disabilities / senior citizens that the website is attracting on account of improved website accessibility. 
The increased diversity of the user population might be quite visible in some cases (for e.g. program registrants, job applicants, etc). 
Admittedly, this number may not be very accurate when the user of the website chooses not to reveal such information. 
Therefore, in some cases it may not be easy to isolate and precisely quantify the impact of an accessible website on the revenues, audience reach, market share and goodwill. 
1.2. 
Saving in costs of Web content development / deployment / QA processes: To be detailed further 1.3. 
Lowering risks of technological obsolesence and exposure to legal claims for discriminatory website practices.
