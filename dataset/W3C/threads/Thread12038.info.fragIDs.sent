<s> hile not actually agreeing, I dont think it is because you are insane *grin*.  </s>
<s> In implementing the checkpoint there is no particular requirement that you have read the IBM guidelines, just that you have done the things which are standard to the relevant operating system(s), and which are applicable accessibility conventions.  </s>
<s> In the techniques document we give references to a number of guidelines documents to help developers find those which are applicable to their projects.  </s>
<s> Imagine a developer working on platform X, where there are a set of guidelines.  </s>
<s> I would expect those guidelines if they were much good (and many developers have produced comprehensive guidelines) to explain what the accessibility conventions are, or to refer the reader to any other documents which must be read in conjunction.  </s>
<s> Indeed, in the techniques for this checkpoint requirements which commonly appear in guidelines have been listed.  </s>
<s> Clearly they are not all applicable to all situations, and they are not claimed to be complete.  </s>
<s> The reader is referred to documentation which is applicable to various software types, and to various platforms, but the techniques give them a rough idea of what they can expect from a set of guidelines.  </s>
<s> It is true that checking this checkpoint exhaustively may be difficult.  </s>
<s> This is not the same as being an undue burden, and I would suggest reading a couple of the checklists and guidelines documents linked from the techniques to check my claim that in fact it is not really very hard to check in most cases.  </s>

<s> I don't know if we can.  </s>
<s> Not a definitive, absolute, normative definition without a great deal of work and without making our document a lot less generally applicable.  </s>
<s> Is it necessary to define "standard", though?  </s>
<s> Is it necessary for us to have strict definitions for every single word in the guidelines?  </s>
<s> I haven't been participating much in the recent month or so, and a lot of that has to do with the fact that I feel we're not making much progress beyond semantic arguments; I have a feeling (which may or may not be justified) that we've stopped with the exchange of productive ideas and new thoughts and are now working on just cleaning up the language and getting caught in semantic circles.  </s>
<s> And that's not particularly interesting to me; I feel like we spend a lot of time on the minutae, and devoting a lot of energy to specific sticking points that may or may not matter to anyone beyond the people who bring it up, and they may just be bringing it up for the sake of contributing and feeling involved.  </s>
<s> (In other words, someone reading this without the compulsion to get involved with changing the words may not be bothered by something, but because we're on the "team", we are working hard on these little details.) I'm not trying to sound critical of any specific person (certainly not Dick) or of the entire group, but I'm just feeling a sense of running around in circles and little sense of actual progress toward the goal.  </s>
<s> Is it because we've already reached the goal and we're just cleaning up the little details before crossing the finish line, or is it because we've lost our way and are seeing the little picture instead of the big one?  </s>
<s> Apart from the specifics of where we put the "scope" and other terms, and apart from whether or not we split checkpoint X.Y.Z into 2 or 3 parts, do we have all the information we need in here?  </s>
<s> Have we got every single thing necessary, that we know of, in order for someone to make the kind of tool we would like them to make?  </s>
<s> What happens when we take a step back and have a broader look?  </s>
<s> I may just be venting steam because the pepsi my wife brought back for lunch gave me a headache (I usually prefer non- caffeine drinks for lunch), but I've had this uncomfortable sense of "lost in semantics" for a while now.  </s>
<s> Tell me if I'm off base or not?  </s>
