Working group, I would just like to thank all of you who have participated in the development of the last call working draft of the user agent guidelines. 
Without your hard work and participation the development of guidelines would not be possible. 
A special thank you to our editor Ian Jacobs who magically takes what we say and send to him, and converts our thoughts into a cohesive set of user agent guidelines and techniques. 
Truly, we are blessed to have such a fine editor as a resource to our working group.
