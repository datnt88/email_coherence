<s> I certainly don't agree with: "But there are drawbacks to URLs-as-identifiers: 1) Software might try to dereference a URL-as-identifier, even though there is no resource at the "location"."  </s>
<s> (a) there's always a resource there; there might not be a representation available.  </s>
<s> But (b) if there isn't a representation available, there should be.  </s>
<s> i.e. names/identifiers take on meaning by use in protocols.  </s>
<s> I don't see much value for making up names without some sense of how they'll take on meaning.  </s>
<s> And I don't see why the existing URI schemes don't work just fine for naming stuff.  </s>
<s> FYI, the W3C TAG has been doing work in this area; it's not finished, but a stake in the ground is: "Describe resources: Owners of important resources (for example, Internet protocol parameters) SHOULD make available representations that describe the nature and purpose of those resources." -- http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-webarch-20020830/  </s>

<s> The IESG is to publish draft-kindberg-tag-uri as an informational RFC shortly.  </s>
<s> Comments on the draft is to be sent to me personally and the authors.  </s>
<s> A year and a half ago, when we were drafting this, Tim Kindberg phrased that text.  </s>
<s> The phrasing grated a little on my W3C-trained ear at the time, but I thought it spoke clearly enough to the wider  </s>
<s> audience.  </s>
<s> Let me try another phrasing:  </s>
<s> 1) With many URI schemes (such as HTTP) there is no indication in  </s>
<s> the URI itself whether web content is available representing the identified thing; the availability of such content must be determined via metadata or experimentation.  </s>
<s> While this  </s>
<s> flexibility can be very useful in some applications, in others designers may know in advance that for certain URIs such a  </s>
<s> representation will never be available.  </s>
<s> When this is known, use of a tag URI avoids the need to communicate extra metadata or perform the web-retreival experiment.  </s>
<s> Of course the text itself is really just informative, and could be dropped with no change to the specification itself.  </s>
<s> By "take on" meaning, I assume you mean in the social sense of establishing a meaning which is shared by various entities (as opposed to simply having a meaning defined in private by a creator).  </s>
<s> You're right that tag URIs have no such associated mechanism.  </s>
<s> We imagined that in some cases, separation of these mechanisms could be advantageous.  </s>
<s> My imagined application was the Semantic Web with floating semantics: the consensus meaning of an identifier is determined by considering various documents using it, along with document metadata.  </s>
<s> This approach mirrors natural language; Tim Berners-Lee recently said it should work in about fifty years; Pat Hayes said ten.  </s>
<s> In proposing tags, I'm not saying when it might work, just that I'd like people to be able to experiment as soon as they want to.  </s>
<s> Our current work (you and I at W3C) is aimed at applications where there *is* representative content available for retreival, and tags do not support that approach.  </s>
<s> Instead they support an alternative approach which can co-exist peicefully.  </s>
<s> In fact, if people want to not publish initial authoritative semantics, then use of a tag URI makes this clear; it means a system calculating the closure under inclusion-of-origin-documents doesn't need to do a bunch of retreival experiments.  </s>
<s> (In RDF one could provide metadata saying no such experiment will succeed, but that gives authors extra error-prone work.  </s>
<s> And what if the term creator wants to be sure no data is ever taken as creator-authoritative?  </s>
<s> Since triples can be freely dropped, that information cannot be maintained.)  </s>
<s> There are people arguing that it is inappropriate to use each of the other approaches in some circumstances.  </s>
<s> Can you use an HTTP URI to identify a dog?  </s>
<s> Some say no. Can you use an HTTP URI-Reference to identify a dog?  </s>
<s> Some say the dependence on media-type information makes that also a bad idea; the naming is no longer uniform.  </s>
<s> Tags at least get one clear of the controversy of retargetting existing schemes.  </s>
<s> They also get one clear of all the useful machinery of the web, which is too bad.  </s>
<s> I'm not saying which way we should go; I'm just saying we should have tags so we can properly explore the territory.  </s>

<s> When using a URI, there might not always be a resource there as the URI itself can exist just because a unique identifier is needed.  </s>
<s> Whether that unique identifier is said to represent something, yes,  </s>
<s> And that something is the resource in question.  </s>
<s> Quite; as I said "there might not be a representation available."  </s>
<s> Here is where the IETF and W3C view is different,  </s>
<s> These are complex organizations; inasmuch as they have views, their views are matters of record.  </s>
<s> So unless you can cite a source for this difference, I don't see what you mean by it.  </s>
<s> and I am sure your view is correct _for_specific_URI_schemes_, it is not for all of them.  </s>
<s> My view is what it is.  </s>
<s> You may disagree, but that doesn't make your view any more "correct" than mine.  </s>
<s> If it's not correct for all of them, then there's one for which it is not correct.  </s>
<s> Which one?  </s>
