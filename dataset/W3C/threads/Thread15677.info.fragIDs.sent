Reply to: RE  ALT-attribute usage (fwd) I also agree with Chuck (and Mike)-- I think "item" is clearer than "bullet". 
For the record, I normally use outSPOKEN for the Mac, and it gives longer pauses for commas, not colons. 
Thus, ALT="Item, " sounds better on my machine than ALT="Item: ". geoff freed CPB/WGBH National Center for Accessible Media Date: 11/3/97 12:10 PM From: Mike Paciello I agree with Chuck. 
In fact, this is exactly what I stated in my last two workshops. 
Everyone agreed and felt this provided a more accurate description of the entity.

4) Recommend use of Alt = "bullet, " (comma and space important to provide pause) - gets us back to providing a short audible cue between items to separate them and identify them as being items in a list. 
- works on all browsers today - gives the audible equivalent of a visual bullet - allows variation if there are different bullet images (in which case the meaning of the different bullets should be substituted. 
- is annoying to hear if you already know for sure that it is a list item 
From this listing it would appear that "bullet" would be the proper 
approach. 
Since "bullet" essentially means "item" (or new item, or next item), and "item" does not denote any hierarchical value (as does a numbered list), then the use of ALT="Item: " to describe the function of a bullet seems appropriate to me. 
"Item" avoids the pain mentioned by Len in a product list, telling people to order that strange "bullet, train" which is really "Item: train". 
Also, doesn't the colon-space give a slightly better pause than a comma-space?

Reply to: RE  ALT-attribute usage (fwd) 
I vote for "Item." 
Based on my experience with outSPOKEN, I also vote for the comma since it forces a decent (but not long) pause in the reading of the text. 
To keep things as clear as possible, I think it's important to have a pause after the text tag. 
I just ran several tests and found that outSPOKEN doesn't seem to care if there are spaces after the comma. the pause is the same after no space, one space, two spaces or more. 
But outSPOKEN does not pause at all after a semicolon, regardless of spaces. 
To confuse the issue a bit further... when it encounters a period, outSPOKEN drops its pitch slightly. 
Therefore, inserting a period after a text tag might make it clearer that the text tag has ended. 
Maybe a period is a better seperator?

Perfect. 
Just the feedback we needed. 
Unless I hear otherwise the guidelines will recommend 1) that any graphics used as bullets have the alt text "Item" With a character to cause a pause after the word. 
The two candidates are Comma and Semicolon. 
Possibly with a space afterward to keep the word from running into the next word. 
Couple of questions to close this one off - Is there a consensus that there should be "item"? 
(I thought I got one but am not sure) - Is comma the proper character for a pause. 
It is longer but longer may not be better. 
And Semicolon looks better visually and more natural so it might get included more. 
Should we use Semicolon or comma? 
- Is the space needed? 
Can someone confirm? 
Is it needed for comma? 
Is it needed for Semicolon? 
Thanks much.

I would prefer a period or colon. 
Remember that accessibility should mean accessibility to the *sighted*, as well as the non-; "Item, Shoes for sale" looks goofy and ungrammatical. 
"Item. 
Shoes..." and "Item: Shoes..." are both grammatically acceptable. 
If they don't sound good in a screen reader, I would venture that the screen reader has bugs, since these are sensical uses of English punctuation.

By the way, an old question that didn't get answered (at least if it did I missed it - too much stuff too late at night). 
Does HTML 4.0 allow a graphic to be specified as the image to be used in a UL ? 
Can you do it with CSS or CSS2? 
Yes, you can do that with HTML3.2 and CSS1 by playing with the list-style and list-style-image (either putting an image directly in CSS - if it doesn't convey any semantics - or by putting the image right after the LI, in the markup, and removing the ususal bullet visual with CSS). 
I think TITLE and ALT are redundant on IMG, and using either should be fine (and browser should be ready to look for both in some order) When IMG is in A, the TITLE of the A should describe the target while the ALT (or TITLE) of the IMG should describe the IMG itself.
