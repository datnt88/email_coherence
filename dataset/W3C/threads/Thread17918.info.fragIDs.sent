<s> The User Agent guidelines currently define user agent in this way: "A user agent is an application that retrieves and renders Web content, including text, graphics, sounds, video, images, and other content types."  </s>
<s> I propose we expand that definition to say (new text between asterisks): "A user agent is an application *or operating system component* that retrieves and renders Web content, including text, graphics, sounds, video, images, and other content types."  </s>
<s> Why the change?  </s>
<s> There are technologies that Microsoft does not consider applications, but rather part of the operating system, that wouldn't be covered by the User Agent guidelines under the current definition.  </s>
<s> Obviously, the OS vs. application issue has received some attention outside the scope of the WAI, and while I am not prepared to discuss that issue in detail, I hope we can agree on the broader definition.  </s>

<s> I cannot attend tomorrow's call and regret this fact especially in light of this interesting but sugnificant development.  </s>
<s> we discussed at length what a user agent is for purposes of this document and have based many of our guidelines on that deffinition.  </s>
<s> at this late point, if we change the deffinition, it could throw the guidelines into such dissarray that we'd possibly have to go fairly far back in the process because of the high impact.  </s>
<s> I think this is a good idea in lots of ways but would like to see it encorporated as we move forward beyond 1.0.  </s>

<s> I agree with Charles.  </s>
<s> "Anything" may sound too vague when it's translated into some languages, and will make the spec look somewhat indefinite.  </s>
