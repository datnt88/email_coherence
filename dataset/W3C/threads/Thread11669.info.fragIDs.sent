<s> Hi, I would like to know, can I translate the P3P into other language ?  </s>
<s> Best Regards, Shell Hung HomePage : http://www.hkscript.com  </s>
<s> Hello Shell Hung, As said repeatedly on this list, anybody can translate any W3C specification if they conform to our conditions at For these cases, there is only the requirement to tell us that you are starting a translation, but no requirement to ask us for permission, permission is already granted.  </s>
<s> Regards, Martin.  </s>
<s> P.S.: 'Can I translate XYZ' seems to be the most frequent question on this list.  </s>
<s> If anybody has a good idea of how to reduce the number of such questions, please tell me.  </s>
<s> Yes, I have an idea.  </s>

<s> We don't do this, because then somebody else could e.g. change HTML, and people would get confused about which is the right one.  </s>
<s> Also, people would probably still ask us whether they are allowed to translate the spec.  </s>
