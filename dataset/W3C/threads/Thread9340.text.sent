I am looking forward to sharing the battlefield with you folks ;) But which side are you on? 
:-) Frank Manola The MITRE Corporation 202 Burlington Road, MS A345 Bedford, MA 01730-1420 Hi all - I am honored to join the WG as an invited expert. 
I am a visiting researcher in the Database Group at Stanford University and a Ph.D. candidate in Leipzig, Germany. 
I got into a liaison with RDF in the end of 1998 when I was working on my M.S. thesis. 
I was building a distributed XML-based system, and I found myself missing and reinventing many features essential for my application: a uniform way of identifying objects in XML documents, linking those objects, storing the relations between them in a database, etc. Besides, I was juggling tons of navigational code needed to traverse XML trees. 
At that time, RDF M&amp;S 1.0 was nearing completion and seemed a panacea for my needs. 
Thus, it became the data model for my application, and the liaison turned into a tight bond for years to come ;) One of my first experiences with RDF was writing a concise algebraic spec for RDF (which made it into my M.S. thesis) and working on an API for RDF. 
Nowadays, the API is often referred to as the "Stanford RDF API", but it was actually shaped as a community process on the RDF IG list, with me as the code maintainer. 
Starting with the code base of Janne's SiRPAC, the model and syntax aspects were separated, and the parser itself became a replaceable module. 
In the past couple of years my research was focused on interoperability between databases and digital libraries. 
In particular, I worked on mediation between Web services and on model management, which is an approach to storing data schemas and instances as first-class objects and manipulating them using high-level operators. 
For my research, I used RDF extensively for prototyping. 
My most recent industry experience includes helping a telecom startup Last Mile Services Inc. to build and deploy an RDF-based infrastructure for automated service provisioning. 
The goal of my work in the RDFCore WG is to help making RDF accessible and usable for the database community, and the Web community as a whole. 
In the recent years, the database community has contributed significantly to the development of formal models, tools, and products based on XML and targeted at Web databases and services. 
However, for many unfortunate reasons, researchers and developers were reluctant to adopt RDF. 
One of the non-technical aspects that I would like the group to clarify is the relationship between XML and RDF, and the potential (pragmatic, non-ideological) benefits of using RDF in realistic application scenarios. 
Speaking of XML, I am referring to the whole suite of emerged standards including XML linking, XML schema, query languages, and database-related efforts. 
Back to the spec, I would like to see RDF designed in a layered fashion with a clean and stable core, equipped with a flexible, well-understood extensibility path. 
I am looking forward to sharing the battlefield with you folks ;) Best, Sergey E-Mail: melnik@db.stanford.edu
