Dear colleagues, Here is my attempt to rewrite "Reduce site maintenance" in less words (agreed in 16th Of May teleconference). 
I am aware that it gives less information, but the questions whether someone who reads this to make a business case needs more details. 
Reduce Site Maintenance Site development and maintenance are an ongoing concern for all organizations. 
Implementation of the WCAG design guidelines will give the following benefits: - Easy altering of the presentation of web content, by following the guideline using a style sheet to manage the presentation specifications for the web site and using mark-up rather than images to convey information.. - Efficient debugging of web content, by following the guideline to create documents that validate to formal grammars as automated validation tools can be used. 
- Reusable web content for different presentation modalities, by following the guideline to use the latest version of W3C technologies enabling the use of web content for different displays, user agents and (mobile) devices. 
Have a good weekend, Henk Snetselaar Thankyou all for contributing to the development of this section of "technical factors" last week. 
My synthesis of it all, and accounting for the discussion at the last teleconference, is now available at Please suggest further improvements to all three sections of the document.

Note that authoring tools which help users develop accessible content automatically [should/could/might someday] be able to pass on these benefits * Update and redesign time may be reduced by using an appropriate standard markup language and style sheets [possibly distinguished by helping different reading environments] to style and format text, formulae and images instead of maintaining bitmap images.
