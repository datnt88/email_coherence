Dear all, we have renewed the translation pages of W3C at but a change in the way we manage translations. 
Until now, the various lists of translations were kept up-to-date by hand. 
From now on, all data on translations are collected and stored on our site in RDF, which allows us to generate automatically various 'views' of the data, eg, lists of all French translations or of all the translations of XML1.0. 
Note, however, that at this moment only the translations of Recommendations, and of documents like WAI Quick Tips, W3C in 7 points, etc, are listed. 
Translations of various W3C notes and of candidate/proposed recommendations are not yet in the database, but will be added soon. 
As new translations come in (through the translator's mailing list) the RDF data is updated. 
(For the time being this is a manual update, we are working on a more automatic method of doing so.) Some of you maintain your own list for, eg, all Russian translations of W3C documents, or of all available translations of a particular W3C document. 
You should consider using the new facilities to maintain those lists, instead of maintaining the list yourself. 
We offer various possibilities to do that: - you can simply refer/redirect to a full XHTML page on either a language or a list of translation of a particular technology. 
Of course, you have then no control over the output format... ;-) - you can invoke a script returning an XHTML fragment that you can include in your page (either on-the-fly through a server side include when applicable, through some regular automatic update of your own pages, etc) - if you want to manage RDF directly, you can also invoke a script that would return the relevant RDF information (in an XML encoding) (B.t.w., the full RDF data is also public). 
There is a more detailed description of the techniques used, as well as the right URI-s to invoke the various scripts or to get access to the RDF files, in: Comments, ideas, feedbacks, etc, are welcome Ivan Herman &amp; Martin Duerst Ivan Herman W3C Head of Offices C/o W3C Benelux Office at CWI, Kruislaan 413, 1098SJ Amsterdam, The Netherlands ?Very good job, Ivan! ?Congratulations!

First of all, thanks for the redesign of the translation pages. 
The result was superb! 
I have a few comments about the way the idiom pages were organized, which I think may help to improve the accessibility. 
They are related to the Portuguese entries, but probably they apply to other idioms which have localized versions. 
Although it is nice to tag documents either "pt-PT" (Portuguese in Portugal style) or "pt-BR" (Portuguese, Brazilian style), some translators forget to include the country code, or just choose not to do so because the language differences may be irrelevant to that document. 
[BTW, it should be pt-BR and not pt-br. 
Country codes should br uppercase.] 
Since you (or the page generator) created only two entries (pt and pt-BR), what happens is that some pt-BR documents are listed in discriminated them for your convenience: pt-PT Especifica??o de Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language 1.0 (SMIL) (SMIL1.0) 
Leonel Morgado pt-PT CONSELHOS PARA FAZER S?TIOS WEB ACESS?VEIS (WAI Quick Tips) Leonel Morgado pt-PT Inicia??o: Como Fazer S?tios Web Acess?veis: Como Fazer S?tios Web Acess?veis (WCAG Getting Started) Leonel Morgado pt-PT Directivas para a acessibilidade do conte?do

Claudia Dias pt-BR XML em 10 pontos. 
(7, de fato...) (XML in 10 Points) Fabr?cio Rog?rio Santos Santana You have two options: you can use only one Pottuguese entry (pt) and put all documents there, or create differente entries for each localization. 
Up to this date, just pt-PT and pt-BR are there, but there are other Portuguese parliant countries. 
Since style differences are just a added flavour, and documents can serve people from both countries, I suggest you use only one pt entry, and optionally classify the documents inside that page (just pt, pt-PT or pt-BR). 
This should also correct some inconsistencies. 
For example, the document I translated (XML in 10 points) is at the pt-BR page but has an older version entry int the pt page (see above), for Fabr?cio tagged it as just pt. 
This way, it looks like they are different translations of the same document, when in fact they are translations of different versions. 
This may not apply to all languages that can be localized -- some are too diferent, like zh-hk and zh-cn. 
Curiously, I see no distinction between en-EN and en-GB, fr-FR and fr-CA, de-CH and de-DE, etc. 
In particular, I expected to see es-ES, es-MX, es-AG, etc., since there is alot of regionalities that apply to spanish as spoken in Latin America. 
Hope this helps to improve the indexing.

Congratulations Ivan and Martin Regards Juan! jpcb You have two options: you can use only one Pottuguese entry (pt) and put jpcb all documents there, or create differente entries for each localization. 
Up jpcb to this date, just pt-PT and pt-BR are there, but there are other jpcb Portuguese parliant countries. 
Since the language tags are hierarchical, a query on "pt" should return those tagged as 'pt' or 'pt-BR' or 'pt-PT' or indeed 'pt-anything-anything-anything' whereas a query on 'pt-BR' (or pt-br or any other case mixture) should return only Brazilian Portugese documents. 
Same for all languages of course. 
jpcb This may not apply to all languages that can be localized -- jpcb some are too diferent, like zh-hk and zh-cn. 
But equally, if someone asks for 'zh' the they should get all chinese documents. 
As you point out, for some languages they are less likely to do that. 
jpcb Curiously, I see no distinction between en-EN and en-GB, (There is no en-EN because EN is not a country code. 
I assume you meant that en-US and en-GB and en are not distinguished). 
jpcb There are only 10 kinds of people in the world: those who jpcb understand binary and those who don't. 
Chris mailto:chris@w3.org 
Marcello, thanks for your comments. 
As you noted yourself, the two Chinese versions are a different problem, due to the differences between simplified and traditional character sets. 
If we forget about that, Brazilian Portuguese is the only one which came up, simply because that was the only case where I found translations which explicitly flagged themselves as Brazilian Portuguese as opposed to simply Portuguese. 
In other words, the fact that there is no special entry (yet?) for Canadian French is simply because, well, nobody claimed a translation to be Canadian French... So it leaves us with the (until now) special case of Brazilian Portuguese. 
And I very well realize the problem you are hinting at, I was actually tempted to merge the various Portuguese versions. 
Although I finally chose not to, your solution of merging the two and possibly flagging them might be a better one. 
It will require some twisting of my code (ie, it will not be overnight), so in the meantime I will change the data of the documents below (for the sake of consistency). 
However, I would welcome more input from others on the list who might be (potentially) in a similar situation... ivan Ivan Herman W3C Head of Offices C/o W3C Benelux Office at CWI, Kruislaan 413, 1098SJ Amsterdam, The Netherlands Hmm... that's an interesting idea... what sort of query did you have in mind? 
xml:lang support in RDF query is a hairball... 
I don't think cwm[1] does it at all (let alone any sort of support for hierarchy); I went around for weeks claiming[2] that nobody does it, and then finally I got somebody to say "we do". 
Sesame or something, I think. 
I have no idea whether XML Query works as you expect. 
I'd appreciate if you (or Martin or Liam or Michael or Massimo or anybody else, for that matter) would check.

Dan Connolly, W3C http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/ mobile: mailto:connolly+pager@w3.org DC Hmm... that's an interesting idea... No.... its not 'an interesting idea' ;-) its how language tags have been defined ever since RFC 2070. 
However, reading on, it seems you misunderstood what I was discussing. 
DC what sort of query did you have in mind? 
Neither of the ones you list below.... 
I meant "query" in the sense of 'the part of the URI after the ?' because the URIs just announced for translations use ? 
for that. 
In other words, the query parts of URIs that were just announced in this thread. 
For example to get translations for just SVG, its to get translations just in Finnish, its So, looking at the language= part, I was just suggesting that it should work in the way that language tags are defined to work, which does not seem especially unusual or interesting, just the defined and correct way.

I don't DC think cwm[1] does it at all (let alone any sort of support DC for hierarchy); I went around for weeks claiming[2] DC that nobody does it, and then finally I got somebody to DC say "we do". 
Sesame or something, I think. 
It would seem highly desirable that RDF could use the same xml:lang stuff that everyone else uses. 
But that was not the subject of my suggestion or of this discussion. 
DC I have no idea whether XML Query works as you expect. 
Ok I guess I should ask Paul Cotton or someone (but again, that wasn't what I was talking about although it is of course what one would expect).

Yes... sorry for reading too fast. 
Here's hoping the cost of the diversion ends up being outweighed by resulting benefits... 
Just one small detail: RFC 3066 language codes are case insensitive. 
All tags are to be treated as case insensitive; there exist conventions for capitalization of some of them, but these should not be taken to carry meaning. 
For instance, [ISO 3166] recommends that country codes are capitalized (MN Mongolia), while [ISO 639] recommends that language codes are written in lower case (mn Mongolian). 
So no need to bother with this detail. 
Regards, Martin. 
Hello Chris, Thanks for the idea of using and similar to get at various sets of translations. 
I think it is the right direction to go. 
Some more details below. 
Please note that language tags as such are not defined to work that way, but RFC 3066 defines a construct called "Language-range" that works like this (and pretty much looks like a language tag). 
(see http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3066.txt, 
2.5 Language-range). 
And then to be formally correct, we would have to make sure that works, which should not be too difficult, just redirect that one to http://www.w3.org/2003/03/Translations/OverviewLang.html. 
I think for the query part of the URI, that sounds good. 
The question is what to list on the right of Do we list all variants, or make some shortcuts? 
And how do we organize the pages that we get back if they have more than one (sub-)language. 
Anyway, I think we got some very good ideas, but it will take some time for them to be implemented, so please be patient. 
Regards, Martin. 
The trick is restricting the check in xml:lang attribute to just the number of characters present in the query. 
This way, a query to "pt" would return any documents tagged with either "pt", "pt-BR", or "pt-anything". 
If you go a step further and restrict the test to the minimum number of charaters of either the query string and the testes string, then it would also return "pt" documents when asked for "pt-PT", but not "pt-BR". 
I think this behaviour is exactly what is expected from xml:lang. 
This is easy to implement, just tweak the XPath expression in the query using the string-length() and starts-with() functions.

Right. 
And further, it has to be seen as a hyphen-separated list of tokens. 
Its not a substring match. 
So "p" or "pt-b" should not match anything. 
jpcb I think this jpcb behaviour is exactly what is expected from xml:lang. 
Yes.

Possibly.

Hello translators, Ivan, Martin, This renders the previous list for Russian translations obsolete. 
It's a pity the page is no longer needed while it's a pleasure to see the results of your work. 
I hope to see an automated service for keeping a list of translated terms one day. 
:) The translations of CRs/PRs/Notes are not listed yet, thus I will keep the list at w3.hotbox.ru in the meanwhile. 
I believe the second and the third options are quite useful, and we should be able to employ them at a stable location, such as w3.xmlhack.ru. 
I have a number of typographical corrections for Russian entries, I'm gonna send them later. 
Alex. Alexander "Croll" Savenkov http://www.thecroll.com/ 
w3@hotbox.ru 
http://croll.da.ru/ Alex, Your page was tremendously useful already, and I can just express my gratitude for having done it... in the coming weeks I hope to gradually add the notes and other docs to the list. 
As for the typographical errors: thanks in advance!
