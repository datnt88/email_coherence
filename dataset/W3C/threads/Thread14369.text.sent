To the people of WCAG, Many sites use small buttons, menus or tabs that have text as images, e.g. FAQs, Our Team, About Us, Consumer Products, Web Sites, Computers, Welcome, News, How-to, Connect, (this is a mixture from several web sites) Do these pass the following priority 2 checkpoint? 
[1] 3.1 When an appropriate markup language exists, use markup rather than images to convey information. 
[Priority 2] For example, use MathML to mark up mathematical equations, and style sheets to format text and control layout. 
Also, avoid using images to represent text -- use text and style sheets instead. 
I contend no, small image buttons/menus/tabs fail this checkpoint: since an accessible markup exists, viz. 
ordinary HTML. 
Plus the last sentence explicitly says to not use images for text. 
Feasible methods exist. 
You can get rid of the link underline, and control color and font with a stylesheet. 
Rectangular buttons are easy. 
If you want something a bit fancier like rounded corners, it's straightforward to piece together the text parts with slivers of images. 
That's a bit of a kluge, but in balance I think it's better than making the whole thing text, given the importance of that checkpoint to people with low vision, who can otherwise simply enlarge the fonts and/or change the colors. 
(Loads faster too). 
I expect some objections to this position, since a number of well known sites in the disability area use such images, so there are clearly folks who didn't think this was a violation. 
By the way, the one place I would allow text as images are in logos, where there are substantial reasons for making the look exact.

This isn't an academic question for me: e.g. full WCAG is now Pennsylvania State Policy, so we've got to know if image folkder tabs are "legal".

what I disagree with is that the text can be small. 
some people have low enough vision that they need larger text but not use assistives to achieve it. 
Aha, okay. 
So you are arguing that web designers have to account for people who need assistive technology, could benefit from assistive technology, may even have access to assistive technology (such as the screen magnifier in Windows), but who choose not to employ it? 
That's a very dangerous argument to propose, you realize... 
I argue that there are ways for those users who need larger text to get the larger text without requiring that web designers _remove_ their graphical text images. 
The implications of placing the burden on the web designer instead of on the user are that unreasonable expectations are asked of the designer, and she is unable to reasonably comply with those requirements. 
Thus, she ignores them.

There is another issue here, the issue of branding, i.e. creating a distinctive, memorable look that a person associates with a particular brand. 
I understand the importance of branding. 
I'd really like to hear from graphical designers if there are cases where branding requires non-standard fonts... instead of e.g. using a few small images for logos, bullets, and other decorations.. or even having a large image... and relying on text with a coordinated font and background color for the rest of the page.
