Dear friends: Using Red Hat Linux 6.0, AMDK6-2 400Mhrtz, 128 megs of Ram. 
First, my congratulations on what looks like a great HTML editor/browser. 
I appreciate all the work that is being done on it and would like very much to use as my primary HTML editor. 
However, there are strange things going on in Amaya that make no sense to me whatsoever and that make me wonder if I perhaps have failed in some very basic way in trying to operate it. 
First, my urgent need has to do with the fact that when I try to access one of my URL's, Amaya freezes every time, necessitating a Cnt-Alt-Backspace on my KDE. 
In fact, the first time, it refused to even return me to the console and I had to literally power off and reboot. 
I have in mind the following site: 
This is an index of Russian bookmarks called Sher's Russian Index, part of my web site (http://www.websher.net). 
I have no problem whatsoever with this URL in Netscape on Linux nor did I ever have any problem with it on Netscape or IE on Windows in the past (I switched four months ago to Linux). 
The index starts loading WITHIN Amaya and runs up to 99%, which is where is always hangs and freezes. 
I have had no problem closing any other applications when this happens. 
But Amaya keeps hanging and the only solution is a Cnt-Alt-Backspace. 
The index has at the very top of the page (after the brief intro) a hyperlink to a java file that allows the user to search 12 search engines. 
I suspect that this is might be the reason why Amaya hangs. 
But if that is the reason, then why should this be so. 
At any rate, what are my options? 
In addition to this urgent problem, there are a number of other anomalies that need explanation: 
1) All of my directory files on www.websher.net 
(except for the Index) are CENTERED. 
Yet, Amaya refuses to recognize the centering: the text in every department of my site appears left-aligned. 
2) None of the images show up. 
Instead, they appear correctly centered but grey. 
3) When I try to bring up any of my files from my LOCAL repository on my computer, the file appears blank. 
None of this makes any sense to me. 
Could someone please help me understand what is going on? 
Thank you so much.

When parsing this page Amaya enters an infinite loop. 
It tries to recover from HTML errors, but the structure is so weird that it gets completely confused. 
The worst cases are missing or erroneous /font closing tags. 
The first few lines of this page contain a number of such cases, including tags like /FONT color=#000080 size="3" (don't repeat attributes in the closing tag). 
Being an editor, Amaya tries to fix the document structure if there are errors. 
Otherwise, it could not edit the document properly, as most of its actions are based on the document structure. 
If you want your pages to be readable not only by IE or NN, but by any HTML browser, they have to be valid. 
Use a HTML conformamt editor like Amaya to create your pages. 
Discard editors that produce invalid markup. 
Refer to the HTML specification when you write HTML "by hand": and validate your pages, for instance with (Change at least the DOCTYPE declaration before validating your russian index, as this declaration is wrong and confuses the validator). 
Here are some explanations: 
In the following situation: Amaya ignores the center tag as it is not valid within a h3 tag. 
You should write the opposite, h3 within center: 
We have discovered a bug with jpeg images. 
This bug has been fixed in version V2.1 wich will be released this week (Thursday at the latest). 
I have no explanation for that one. 
Could you send me such a file, or an URI? 
Thanks for your report.

Really he should override the style definition for H3, as there is nothing to stop the browser or users's default style for H3 forcing non-centred text.
