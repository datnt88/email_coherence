Hi, a few corrections, minor updates to the article Web-Quality I would like to add two points, but I need your help. 
* "Major companies have invalid websites. 
They don't care about standards, why I should care?" 
* "I'm working in the real world, I'm doing business with real clients and they don't care about standards, they want something that works." Please reply to the list. 
Karl Dubost / W3C - Conformance Manager --- Be Strict To Be Cool! --- I have two specific and two general comments below. 
The specific comments assume that the reader buys your existing arguments. 
Answer: "You should care because you cannot afford overheads that major companies can afford". 
Answer: "Great! 
So use standards because of the other arguments to use them. 
Since your clients do not care and standards work, there is no conflict. 
Also, your clients may start to care tomorrow. 
If you are reading this article today, they may be too. 
Perhaps you can even teach them to care. 
Customers often do not know what's best for them and may seek your advice and expert opinion." 
General comment: Your "Usual comments" section is nice to read, but it would be very helpful to have a succinct summary of "Whys" in a separate section. 
Right now, it is difficult to answer your own "Why?" question without spending time to extract the answers from the "Usual comments". 
In other words, the article does not answer its own Why? question in an easy-to-digest way. 
A bulleted list following the "Usual comments" section may be appropriate. 
A TOC would be nice too, BTW. 
Think of a person who needs to convince management to follow standards. 
That person will benefit from reading "Usual comments", but she cannot send those long paragraphs to the boss. 
She needs a concise summary and a way to prove her points. 
You help with the latter, but not with the former. 
Another general comment: To be complete, the article SHOULD mention Web site software that delivers Web content. 
After all, if the Web server is incompliant, it may corrupt compliant content or otherwise fail to deliver it. 
If you want to argue that standards are the way to go, you should argue that Web servers (and other software involved) should follow corresponding standards like HTTP. 
Note that achieving HTTP compliance (from Webmaster point of view) is simply a matter of selecting compliant software and/or making their preferences known to software manufactures. 
In this context, it is much easier to accomplish compliance because it does not involve arguments such as Web site design quality or cost. 
Yet, most, if not all HTTP servers are not compliant. 
This brings an interesting question: Are you fighting the true cause for incompliance? 
Perhaps all those excuses you are trying to address are not that important if software that does not have similar problems is still not compliant? 
Finally, can you truly say that "My Web site is standard" (the title of your article) if your HTTP server violates RFC 2616 MUSTs? 
Should you be saying "My Web pages are standard, if you can get them" instead? 
I believe this is a serious integrity question. 
From an outside observer, it may look like you are advocating standard compliance where it is easy (for you!) to achieve and ignoring it where it is more difficult.

A few more questions that pop up from time to time: Stephane, Web hobbyist developer says: "I spent dozens of hours reading about and experimenting with standards, and my web site is still using tables and does not validate. 
Can you make the standards simpler?" 
Stephane, Web hobbyist developer says: "I admire your Bene Gesserit skill of saying that standards are simple while keeping a straigth face. 
But really, could you make them simpler, please ? 
Pretty please ?" 
(a lot of web hobbyist developers make their own tools, we can't just tell them to use better tools. 
Tool making has to be simple too. 2 or 3 valid tools is not enough. 
We need hundred of thousands of them to keep the Web an exciting and creative place) (and no, 2 or 3 valid browsers is not enough either. 
Browser making should be doable from scratch (i.e. no Gecko) in a reasonable amount of human hours) Stephane, Web hobbyist developers naively asks: "If we abandoned all concessions to backward compatibility, could we create a simpler standard for web pages? 
Given the weak adoption rate of current standards and the even weaker success rate of adopters, maybe we should consider doing that." 
(I just tried validating pages that proudly display the "Valid W3C" logo, and so far only a very small fraction still validates today) Stephane, Web hobbyist developer says: "My web site incorporates a lot of real-time input (e.g. snippets of HTML, urls with the &amp; character) from end users and other external sources, should I spent hours making my web site validate when a single user input can break the validity?" 
(some very standards-savvy end users do get pissed off when they try to input their fancy blockquote and find out I'm stripping nearly all markup, but I don't want them to break everything because of a typo). 
Thanks, Stephane Web hobbyist developer Not the help you asked for, but I find the title "My Web site is standard! 
And yours?" a bit unfortunate. 
It sounds like the owner is proud of having a boring old standard website instead of a sizzlin' hot high-tech standards-compliant supergizmo! 
IOW: It's not the site that should be standard, it's the code. 
The site should be extraordinary and special. 
At least that's what many webdesigners aim for. 
Cite URLS of other major sites that have valid HTML, correct CSS, accessible code, and look great and are fun to use. 
"If it doesn't work, don't blame it on the standards; blame it on the industry that hasn't caught up with the standards." 
OTOH, that raises the question how "standard" these standards really are if the industry doesn't use them. 
So scratch that. 
In my experience, working with standards doesn't cost more time than working without them. 
But the overall technical quality of the product is often better (depending on your and the client's definition of "quality", of course), easier to maintain, and has a longer life expectancy. 
You could also bring examples from other fields where standardization has saved costs, enhanced quality, and worked.

I would like to add two points, but I need your help. 
* "Major companies have invalid websites. 
They don't care about standards, why I should care?" 
Remember the "David slaying Goliath" story? 
Just because big companies have badly written, non standards compliant sites doesn't mean you should. 
Being large doesn't automatically mean that you are always correct. 
You should care because you want to provide a solid service for your clients and users now and in the future. 
If large companies don't want to do that for their users, want to spend more money now on hacks and even more money in the future on reworking those hacks, then let them waste their bottom line. 
Me, I'd rather keep my money! 
* "I'm working in the real world, I'm doing business with real clients and they don't care about standards, they want something that works." 
Well, standards work. 
At what point are you going to keep on coding for old browsers? 
Netscape have even launched their own campaign to get people to move away from NS4.x IE has moved from to 5.5 to 6 and people don't generally code for IE4. 
Netscape have from from 6.0 to 6.1 to 6.2 to 7 - at what point are you going to carry on pandering to the 4.x range? 
And in the time that these 2 browsers have had that developemtn we've seen Mozilla reach 1.0, 1.1 and Opera leap up the version numbers. 
How about something like this: "You want to be seen as a forward looking company that's leading the way in your field. 
You spend X amount of money on billboards, TV advertising, staff uniforms, etc, etc but the public image you portray to the world via your web site is one of not caring. 
Coding to standards not only gives you a great site now, but will actually save you money in the future which, I'm sure, your shareholders and investors will think is most beneficial". 
Don't know if that's any good... Regards Francis Karl Dubost / W3C - Conformance Manager --- Be Strict To Be Cool! --- Hi Karl, Hi all. 
Good. 
Since you don'y publish a "new document" each time (and thus kep the URI) a small changelog at the end of the document would be a nice addition. 
These 2 questions can basically summarized with "nobody cares, why should I", and the obvious answer is (crudely said) "you are a sheep". 
Then you can add "the rest of the herd is stupid, stop being a sheep" or "the other sheeps are starting to move forward, be a leader among sheeps", depending om whom you want to target (happy or unhappy sheeps). 
I have, however, a problem with those questions. 
The other questions are specific problems for specific people, whereas this question ("nobody cares, why should I") is *the* global question behind non-standard conformance, and if you can find a good, convincing answer, then the whole E&amp;O effort here and everywhere else has reached its goal, thank you, you can go home now. 
Seriously, even though there have been good ideas on this list to answer this question, you will never be able to answer it completely and properly. 
The interest of your document is that it's not yet another (empty) statement saying "standards are good, follow standards!", instead it says why (explaining real-life cases) and how. 
you should keep it this way IMHO. 
cheers, olivier. 
Olivier Thereaux - W3C Stephane, A lot to answer here, I'll focus on the core. the answer is, no and yes. 
I'll assume the "you" is "W3C" in your request... Then no, W3C is not going to make standards easier for web hobbyists. 
Web hobbyists should not read W3C specifications, they should use tools (tools that conform to standards they wouldn't need to read), read books or tutorials... but the standards are not for hobbyists to read. 
W3C specifications are made for implementors (tools/frameworks/etc developers), or the people that write the books and the tutorials that web hobbyists should read. 
And for those, yes, W3C is trying hard to make the specifications simpler. 
and you can actually do more to help than saying the specs are too complicated (indeed some are, unfortunately, we're painfully aware of it). 
As you may know, this list is hosted by the Quality Assurance activity at W3C, among the goals of which is to improve the quality of W3Cc specifications through the creation of a "QA framework [1]", help the "education and outreach" community in their work (through this list), and more... If you think you can help, please participate in the QA Interest Group, which reviews and discusses the framework. 
QAIG home : QAIG public discussion list : [1] http://www.w3.org/QA/WG/#docs Regards, olivier. 
Olivier Thereaux - W3C Why not? 
To be precise, why should not base standards be simple enough for a computer hobbyist to follow? 
I think that should be an ideal, albeit not reachable, goal. 
How does one determine whether the standard is too complex? 
One test could be to check whether it is simple enough for a computer hobbyist to understand. 
You argue that hobbyists should use tools. 
When there are dozens of popular operating systems and programming environments, finding a tool that is both "good" and "works" in your environment is often not possible, especially if you are not using MS Windows or Linux. 
Ideally, I want to code simple, valid *ML using a text editor and validate it using an on-line form on W3C Web site. 
I cannot do that today using bleeding-edge W3C standards. 
I can only do that using old standards that most on this list do not even consider standard enough! 
Very good point! 
On the other hand, if Stephanie is not supposed to _read_ standards, it is highly questionable whether she should be encouraged to participate in _writing_ a framework for them. 
The framework itself, BTW, is already more complex than a "hobbyist" would want it to be, IMHO. 
Full circle. 
I think the answer to Stephane's request is simple -- simple standards cannot be created by an organization that has to balance conflicting interests of hundreds of interested parties. 
If you want a simple (hence, not backward compatible) *ML standard, create one and try to convince others to use it. 
It worked when Tim Berners-Lee invented the Web. 
Perhaps it was a miracle that was possible only due to a unique demand/supply situation. 
Perhaps it will work again, but probably not. 
If you do, and it works, please remember the lessons learned -- try to keep it simple :-). 
Thanks, Alex. Howdy everyone, That just gave me visions of companies going 'baaa baaa'. 
:) For the first point at least, I have this to say: Once upon a time, there would have been no standards for taps and pipe fittings, but at some point, the industry must have recognised that they need to standardise the need to manufacture pipes, taps and fixtures of the right sizes so that things would fit everywhere. 
The Web is young, so standards are still being established and are being adopted by pockets of the industry. 
Technologies for accessing web sites are gradually changing too, and it makes sense to be developing according to standards so that in the future, everything can fit alongside everything else at an infrastructural level. 
If you don't follow standards, you might find a time whereby you can't find a tap to replace the broken one in your bathroom because your pipe is a really weird size. 
(I'm no expert on pipes :D One can use a similar metaphor with old cars or railroad tracks - once upon a time (I was told) to travel from Melbourne to Sydney you have to change trains at the border because the tracks were different widths in the two states so the trains which ran in one couldn't run in the other.) For the second point, perhaps something like this: Web designers are professional, are we not? 
Lawyers are professional, are they not? 
If you go to a lawyer, you expect them to give you the best advice under the circumstances about what action to take. 
When your customer comes to you with a request, you are entitled to express that the best action to take is to futureproof their website with regards to Web standards. 
Your customer has every right to know about Web standards because it will effect them in the future, and that is more important than just 'something that works'. 
Doing things right this time means they would not have to overhaul the current work at a later stage, thus providing cost savings. 
Hope that helps. 
Feel free to elaborate on my ideas :) cheers, -steph Hi Alex, I didn't say they should not be simple enough to be read by hobbyists, just that specs were not aimed at them but at implementors and "translators" (book and tutorial authors are translators from spec-lang to real-world language, IMHO). 
I believe we agree on this point, don't we? Good point, but my main argument remains valid : once people are aware of a problem, it's useless to complain about them, especially since (at W3C) there is plenty of room for people to help/participate in a constrictive manner, through public comments list, through the QAIG, etc. Cheers, olivier. 
Olivier Thereaux - W3C There was a similar situation in England in the 19th Century. 
GWR used wider tracks than the other three main railway companies. 
In London, where all the networks met, they needed to use track with three rails so that both widths of cars could fit on them. 
I've been looking for a picture of this on the Internet, but couldn't find one. 
A more up to date example would be Betamax verses VHS. 
By going for propriety standards rather than vendor neutral standards the video industry was divided. 
Neither of those are quite the same as the situation wrt web standards, but there are parallels.
