"rdf:resource" should be rdfs:Resource. 
BTW, there are a lot of discrepancies between OWL AS&amp;S and OWL Reference, why not build a normative OWL/XML syntax?

We expect to be releasing a new (Last Call) version of these documents very soon. 
In that version, we should have fixed these discrepancies. 
Please check the W3C site later this week to get the Last Call versions of the documents, and if you find discrepancies please point them out to us. 
The WG decided not to do a normative syntax as one of the features of RDF is that the same underlying graph can be built via multiple syntactic realizations. 
In the new versions of the reference and the Guide we offer many more examples and demonstrations of correct syntax -- even though it is not normative, it should make it much easier to learn correct OWL. 
Please let us know if the new documents meet your needs.

It was not clear to us whether your message addressed the new Last Call documents or the earlier ones. 
If you the discrepancies can still be found in the last call working documents, please let us know. 
The following are our Working Drafts in Last Call: * OWL Web Ontology Language Overview * OWL Web Ontology Language Reference * OWL Web Ontology Language Guide * OWL Web Ontology Language Semantics and Abstract Syntax * Web Ontology Language (OWL) Use Cases and Requirements thanks for your input Jim Hendler Professor James Hendler hendler@cs.umd.edu
