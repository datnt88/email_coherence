<s> I just discovered something surprising (at least to me): For IMG elements, JAWS 4.01 reports the *name* attribute when ALT="" and there is no TITLE attribute.  </s>
<s> The NAME attribute is *not* reported when ALT is not empty or if there is a TITLE attribute.  </s>
<s> If the content of the TITLE attribute is longer than the content of the ALT attribute, JAWS 4.01 reports the TITLE.  </s>
<s> It does not appear to matter whether the user has selected "Speak ALT or TITLE" or "Speak longest" in HTML settings for graphics: JAWS reports the TITLE attribute if it's longer.  </s>
<s> In fact, even when the ALT text is longer than the content of the TITLE attribute, TITLE appears to take precedence.  </s>

<s> Jim, thanks for pointing out that I forgot to mention which browser I was  </s>
<s> using.  </s>
<s> I was using IE 5.5 with JAWS 4.01 under Win98.  </s>
<s> The same behavior occurred with IE 6.0 and JAWS 4.02 under WinXP.  </s>
<s> I can think of several reasons why it's *not* appropriate for JAWS to report the name attribute on IMG elements.  </s>
<s> Valid HTML specifically mandates that the ALT attribute be present for *all* IMG elements.  </s>
<s> Good practice also requires that ALT be set to null (ALT="") for such things as spacer Gis and other images that do not carry content, especially when those images are repeated and/or when encountering them would distract or confuse someone using a screen reader, talking browser, refreshable Braille, or text-only display.  </s>
<s> If developers then use the name attribute for internal management (e.g., to keep track of which images go with which Javascript calls, as was the case on the page where I first encountered this), and if AT then *speaks* (or otherwise renders) the content of the name attribute which users were not intended to hear or encounter, the required technique of setting ALT="" is defeated, and *no one* benefits from the defeat!  </s>
<s> Chris, in response to your question about the way the ALT attribute is used on the Virginia site, I'd say "no"-- an ALT text that's merely an identification number doesn't convey any meaning to the user, and the purpose of the ALT attribute is to provide a text *equivalent* for the functionality of the image.  </s>
<s> If the function of the image is to create blank space for layout (for example), then the equivalent functionality for speech output is sielcne.  </s>
<s> How or whether users who are blind/have low vision hear about images that have no ALT text depends on how they configure their screen readers, at least for JAWS: if I tell JAWS to report "Only tagged graphics," it will ignore images without ALT attributes in exactly the same way that it will ignore images with ALT="".  </s>
<s> That is, in both cases it will act as though there is no image present.  </s>
<s> "Only tagged images" is the default setting; therefore, if there *is* ALT text there, JAWS will report it whether it's meaningful or not.  </s>
<s> It should either be meaningful or be empty00 that is, silent.  </s>
<s> Sorry that was so long!  </s>

<s> This is rather odd, as it means Jaws has no support for javascript or any other scripting language, this has not been my experience of JFW 3.70 which has obviously been working on the DOM provided by IE, or aswell as parsing the HTML is also handling the events and scripting.  </s>
<s> Jim.  </s>
<s> Right Jim, It is rather odd, and in my saying  </s>
<s> I should have said "which browser is not relevant as to what JFW speaks or doesn't speak" because, as you observed, they must rely on the browser to support events and scripting.  </s>

<s> It's a good book!  </s>
<s> The name attribute is pretty rare on img elements, as it is only useful (hitherto) for scripting involving an image.  </s>
<s> Using the name attribute for something else is likely to be a bad idea.  </s>
<s> It seems reasonable that JAWS offers users as an advanced 'try to guess what the author meant from the name attribute' option, but that should not be a default in my opinion.  </s>
<s> It is important that there is at least one use mode which assumes that authors have done the right thing - otherwise there is no incentive for them to bother.  </s>
<s> I think you are better doing the correct thing - putting in alt="" where that is what you mean thatn putting in some extraneous characters to work for particular error recovery strategies at the expense of systems that use standards.  </s>

<s> And again, "hear, hear".  </s>
<s> What doesn't seem entirely satisfactory is, as was said earlier on the thread, that images are often used to stand for empty space; but alt=" " (quote space unquote) is apparently deprecated or unsupported for this purpose.  </s>

<s> Now, excuse me for a bit of a digression, but as for the suggestion earlier on this thread, to code alt="#" and have it read as "pound sign", might I point out that according to international standards the "pound sign" is iso-8859-1 character number 163, expressed as &amp;pound; in HTML.  </s>
