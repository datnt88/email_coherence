The glossary entry "equivalent (for content)" employs a concept of an "equivalency target" which is set apart from "the equivalents" for said "equivalency target." 
This distinction is incompatible with the common meaning of equivalency or equivalents.? Equivalence relations are commonly reflexive and symmetrical.? 
Any thing by itself forms an equivalence group.? If there are more than the one equivalent, then there are alternatives and the situation becomes interesting. 
In WCAG 1.1, in the glossary it says: ? 
Equivalent ???????? Content is "equivalent" to other content when both fulfill ???????? essentially the same function or purpose upon presentation to ???????? the user. 
In the context of this document, the equivalent must ???????? fulfill essentially the same function for the person with a ???????? disability (at least insofar as is feasible, given the nature ???????? of the disability and the state of technology), as the primary ???????? content does for the person without any disability. 
For ???????? example, the text "The Full Moon" might convey the same ???????? information as an image of a full moon when presented to users. 
???????? 
Note that equivalent information focuses on fulfilling the same ???????? function. 
If the image is part of a link and understanding the ???????? image is crucial to guessing the link target, an equivalent ???????? must also give users an idea of the link target. 
Providing ???????? equivalent information for inaccessible content is one of the ???????? primary ways authors can make their documents accessible to ???????? people with disabilities. 
???????? 
As part of fulfilling the same function of content an ???????? equivalent may involve a description of that content (i.e., ???????? what the content looks like or sounds like). 
For example, in ???????? order for users to understand the information conveyed by a ???????? complex chart, authors should describe the visual information ???????? in the chart. 
The first sentence in this entry should be regarded as definitive. 
The rest is explanatory. 
It explains how this concept is _applied_ in the context of this document.? It _does not_ further restrict the sense of the term itself, even as used in this document. 
In no way did the WCAG mean to indicate that equivalence, as it relates to accessibility in content, only applies when one user is a person with a disability, or one of the alternative equivalents is incorporated for the express purpose of making the ensemble accessible.? These are included in the range of "equivalent alternatives" [or equivalently, "alternative equivalents] but do not restrict these terms to those cases. 
In the checkpoint which says: ?? 1.1 Provide a text equivalent for every non-text element The term 'equivalent' is used solely to indicate how the text and non-text alternatives are alike in the manner and to the extent stated in the first sentence in the glossary, to wit: ???????? Content is "equivalent" to other content when both fulfill ???????? essentially the same function or purpose upon presentation to ???????? the user. 
The terms 'text' and 'non-text' are the part of this checkpoint which refer to how the alternatives are different.? 
This information is independent of, and in addition to, the similarity indicated by the term 'equivalent.' 
The UAAG should be re-worded to come closer to this understanding of the basic principles. 
The ATAG may provide useful examples of how to do this without being unnecessarily abstract. 
This principle is important to the current work of WAI-PF as regards the reform of XHTML possibly on the basis of something derived from smil:switch as the basis for marking all manner of equivalence groups.? As PF work is affected by the outcome, and the basic question lies in an interpretation of the WCAG concepts, it may be appropriate to coordinate with WCA and PF to gain further input before attempting to resolve this comment.

Re: User Agent Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 W3C Working Draft 23 October 2000 ?? This version: [9] http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-UAAG10-20001023 http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/W D-UAAG10-20001023 [snip] Al, Our mandate is to create for user agent developers a set of requirements known to improve accessibility. 
Each requirement must have a known impact on accessibility, otherwise we have exceeded our charter. 
One of the ways in which the last call UAAG 1.0 ensures that requirements are relevant to accessibility is to "bind" the accessibility impact within definitions. 
This, I believe, is the essence of the debate we are having on the terms equivalent, text element, etc. 
These terms have build-in accessibility implications, which seems to be the heart of your objection. 
So "text equivalent" means more than "B is made of text and equals A", it means "B is understandable to users with disabilities because of the following assumptions, and B equals A". 
If WCAG talks about "text equivalents" and they are not accessible to users with disabilities, what's the point of talking about them? 
WCAG won't have done its job if its requirements don't promote accessibility. 
UAAG is in the same boat. 
It is possible to remove the access portions from the definitions of equivalent, text element, text equivalent, etc. 
However, there are immediate implications to using the same words without the accessibility binding. 
If document A is the French translation of document B, they can be functional equivalents. 
But is it within the scope of UAWG charter to require user agent developers to provide easy access to translated materials? 
Questions: - Do you think that we need to ensure the binding of each requirement to one or more accessibility issuse? 
- If we change the definitions, where do you think we could best "recapture" the bindings to accessibility? 
Thanks Al, _ Ian Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org) http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs Cell: +1 917 450-8783 ** SUMMARY 1. Job of the UAAG. 
The mission of the UAAG is to articulate a profile of guidelines for User Agents which accomplish reasonable accommodation for people with disabilities. 
The selection criteria for UAAG provisions (guidelines and checkpoints) is to pick the _most reasonable_ provisions which deliver _sufficient accommodation_ for people with disabilities. 
Note that "most reasonable" does not necessarily equate to "least capable." 
In examining whether the accommodation is sufficient, all that is relevant is how the provisions affect users with disabilities. 
In examining what is the most reasonable way to achieve this benefit, however, the scope of pertinent factors widens. 
Here the relevant criteria are cost and benefit as viewed by the User Agent implementer considering all costs and all benefits (to all users). 
This is why the most reasonable accommodation is not always the design feature which delivers the least functionality sufficient to meet the needs of people with disabilities. 
If there is an alternative design feature which delivers comparable access and attractive cost and benefit differentials vs. the minimalist approach, then it is a more reasonable accommodation and it should be preferred. 
This can be the result of less cost, more general benfit, or great enough improvement in general benefit so that the pain after considering the gain is more desirable. 
2. Connection to disability concerns: Yes, there should be a clear and documented connection, a rationale, for each guideline and checkpoint in terms of how it affects users with disabilities. 
3. Documentation of the connection In two parts: a) in the "the guidelines" section of the Recommendation document: Each _normative_ provision (guideline and checkpoint) is _accompanied_ by a brief, _informative_ summary of the rationale for this provision. 
The following example is from the WCAG: [quote] Guideline 2. Don't rely on color alone. 
[114]Next guideline: 3 [115]Previous guideline: 1 [116]Go to contents Ensure that text and graphics are understandable when viewed without color. 
If color alone is used to convey information, people who cannot differentiate between certain colors and users with devices that have non-color or non-visual displays will not receive the information. 
When foreground and background colors are too close to the same hue, they may not provide sufficient contrast when viewed using monochrome displays or by people with different types of color deficits. 
[end quote] Note how in this example the normative statement of the guideline is set off as an exhibit, and the heuristic explanation comes in a following, separate paragraph. 
The terms used in the normative statement of the checkpoint itself should preferably be general usage already familiar to the reader. 
If it is necessary to use narrow technical terms to make the statement of the checkpoint sufficiently crisp, the _concepts_ used should be those specific to the technicalities of building User Agent software, not specific to the human factors measurement of person-with-disability consequences. 
It is helpful to explain the usage in the normative clauses in a Glossary if there are terms (words or phrases) used in the normative language in narrow technical senses. 
Note also that in this example, the rationale is only provided for the guideline. 
The rationale for the checkpoints is the same, and is inherited, not repeated or specialized. 
b) elsewhere ad_lib; in informative annexes and by informative reference to other documents: Details of the rationale are in a variety of places. 
The key point is that the rationale is informative, not normative. 
Dependency of the informative rationale summary on the WAI notes discussing the accessibility features of various W3C formats is appropriate, and references to these notes should be used to reduce the burden of writing the guidelines document where they will help do that. 
In addition, some details may only appear in the summary of the review process which goes up to the Director's desk with the finished process and the request for change of status. 
In particular there are higher standards for defending the rationale where comments have been overruled than in other cases. 
** DETAILS the equivalents] AG:: Point one: standard of proof. 
For 'known' substitute 'believed' or 'trusted.'? 
You don't need scientific proof.? What you need here is rough consensus.? 
This is potentially weaker than the U.S. Civil Law requirement of the unanimous agreement of the jury that the preponderance of evidence supports the verdict.?? 
But the "preponderance of evidence" test is very close to what we should be trying to follow.? 
If the preponderance of evidence supports the idea that following the rule has a significant positive impact, then the rule is justified. 
Point two: universal design. 
In the discussions of the UAAG, Universal Design has sometimes been misrepresented as "designing things to meet the needs of people with disabilities."? 
This misses an essential aspect of Universal Design.? Universal Design strives to meet the needs of people with disabilities not by designing product or service features which are disability-specific, but rather by incorporating design rules or features which are simpler and "just better" for a broader segment of the user population.

UD/DA considerations for The Grid http://trace.wisc.edu/docs/ud4grid 
http://trace.wisc.edu/docs/ud4grid/ 
The model for universally designed checkpoints is that a) they are sufficient conditions for success in the disability scenarios we understand or can articulate, and b) the difference between (1) just being successful in the identified disability scenarios and (2) satisfying the checkpoint adopted for the document is a win-win deal; a friendly amendment in the collective rough consensus combining inputs of both providers and consumers. 
In the Universal Design community, there is a general expectation that usually the list of rules imposed will be shorter, the individual rules will be simpler and broader, and the benefits of the rules will be broader than just the disability impact alone. 
The charter does not prevent the UAAG from proposing rules (checkpoints) which deliver more benefit than just the benefit to people with disabilities.? For reasons of economy of effort (the general topic of the UAAG is an immense task) the document should not impose rules that have no articulable justification in terms of disability benefit.? But the test here is: "If there is a disability scenario where imposing the set of checkpoints with this one deleted delivers significantly reduced usability, then there is a disability justification for the checkpoint." 
An example of the application of Universal Design would be to say that if there are rules A and B which match the needs of two disability scenarios exactly, and a rule C which is sufficient to meet the needs of both scenarios, and the implementation burden of implementing C vs. A and B is not significantly worse, and there is either a cost savings or a collateral benefit to non-disabled persons, then the Working Group and document _should_ impose rule C in preference to Rules A and B. (See also the discussion of SMIL, SWITCH, captions and language alternatives below at "** Example.") Yes, if the rule imposed on the user agents which covers both translations and data of assistive purpose without making a distinction is easier to implement and/or of significantly greater general benefit. 
This is the case in SMIL (see example at end). 
[Note: The traditional term is 'tracing,' not 'binding,' when talking about the association of a rule with its justification or rationale. 
But yes, they need to have a connection and the documentation needs to make the connection obvious.] 
Yes, each guideline and checkpoint in the UAAG should be clearly associated with a disability-specific benefit and motivation. 
But the rationale for selecting a particular form of requirement may be based on a combination of factors including not only the disability-specific benefit, but also costs to the implementer and benefits to other users without disabilities. 
The overall decision factors include reasonableness factors as well as accommodation factors, so benefits to other groups may be considered under "what's most reasonable?" 
This is a two-part story. 
The primary strategy is something roughly on the order of what we did in WCAG 1.0. 
Here there is a rhythm (pattern) where for each guideline or checkpoint there are separate statements of what the [in that case content constructor] should do, followed (usually immediately) by a brief summary of why this is of accessibility concern -- the linkage to the access-based motivation. 
But it is clear that the 'what' is normative, and focuses on the content, not the disability, and the 'why' which follows is informative, not normative. 
It motivates but does not modify the 'what' that precedes it. 
Another important piece of capturing and publishing the justification or rationale has to do with the answers to review comments. 
What goes in the actual checkpoints should be definitive. 
It should stand on its own as a reasonably clear and definitive statement of _what_ the content should be like in the WCAG case or _what_ functionality the User Agent should provide in the UAAG case. 
The rationale which follows in the Recommendation [UAAG] document itself is summary and heuristic, not definitive. 
For the details of the rationale, the Director [making the decision to elevate] and the implementer [complaining to her boss about why she has to do this] may be expected to have to do some fairly complicated tracing to find the details of the argument for this 'what' in the record of the working group process. 
It is not enough to say 'the group agreed on this' but the reasoning that the group relied on does not all have to be in the Guidelines document by any means. 
The principal place where the record of the rationale gets tested is where the Group decides to ignore a comment in a review. 
Negative-ballot-response is the IEEE jargon for this. 
The Director will expect the Working Group to articulate their reasoning in a clear and compelling way if they wish to proceed with some decision over the objection of a commentor. 
This is true whether the comment from within or without the working group, the WAI, and the W3C membership. 
The standard for documenting rules that are not contested in review is not so stringent in practice. 
That is why there is so much emphasis on tracking negative comments; they raise the bar for documenting your rationale. 
The group can always propose to the W3C language in a Recommendation which goes against some comment or another. 
But in this case the Director and the process demand a clear documented articulation of the reasoning behind the decision. 
** Example: I want to illustrate this with an example, because the discussion above is all in generalities. 
The example I would like to talk about is captions vs. translations and the constructs of the SMIL format. 
In SMIL we persuaded the SYMM working group to practice a little universal design along the lines described above. 
The SWITCH construct in SMIL is used to introduce alternatives, or elective content. 
The purpose of SWITCH is to support client-side content control or decisions as to which of several alternatives will actually be incorporated in what is displayed during the course of playing the integrated presentation. 
The SWITCH construct is used both for assitive tracks, captions and auditory descriptions, and for language alternatives for use with a multilingual audience. 
There are test variables such as "system-captions" that are pretty closely linked with disability scenarios, but they are not restricted or specific to the disability scenarios. 
You turn captions on to have a quiet TV in a noisy bar, too. 
So these test variables are not limited to disability application. 
Furthermore, there is an extension capability for user-defined test variables, so we cannot guarantee to enumerate all test variables that are important for disability access from just the ones pre-defined in the format specification. 
Considering all these factors, the appropriate level of generality at which to interpret the spirit of UAAG checkpoint 2.3 for SMIL is at the level of the SWITCH construct and the alternatives contained within a SWITCH; not in terms of specific test variables. 
The more general rule here is simpler to understand and implement, and it is the least rule which is guaranteed to give you coverage of all access-related cases because of the possibility of user test variables. 
One of the macro-principles of the UAAG is that "Implementing what is in the format definition is the first line of defence." 
In this case, what is in the format is a method of defining alternatives. 
This method gets applied both for access purposes and for language purposes. 
But there is no gain to give the user agent a rule that says "when SWITCH is used for access data, then the rules of UAAG checkpoint 2.3 apply, but not when it is used for language diversity." 
No, the rule should be "When SWITCH is used in SMIL to create alternatives, the user must have the ultimate control over show/hide decisions so they have access to all the alternatives (as implied by the SWITCH markup) among the various presentation resources." 
This is sufficient to give the user access to captions and auditory descriptions. 
It also ensures access to language variants. 
There are reasons why access to the language variants is an accessibility issue, but I don't want to rely on that argument for the moment. 
The point here is that the broader rule that relates directly and simply to the features that are in the language is much less of a burden on the User Agent developers than it would be to try to separate the assitive applications of the SWITCH construct in SMIL and require only the necessary behavior in the disability-specific cases. 
Note that this directly affects the current work of the WAI-PF group as we advise the HTML working group on the functional reform of XHTML to design XHTML 2.0. 
It has been our general intent to encourage them to prefer features like SWITCH that deliver a broadly useful capability which meets or exceeds the requirements of people with disabilities. 
In the process we are angling to make disability access to web information less dependent on features like the ALT and LONGDESC in HTML 4.01 which are of limited utility outside their assistive use. 
This is based on trying to meet the most needs with the fewest rules. 
We hope that the UAAG will be a force contributing to this process of simplification, because gaining widespread adoption of the numerous, rather narrow features and rules in HTML 4.01 and WCAG 1.0 has not been a total and instant success.
