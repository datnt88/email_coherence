<s> A regular Web Content Guidelines working group meeting will be held on Thursday at 20 hours Coordinated Universal Time (4 PM Boston, 10 PM France, now 7 AM in Eastern Australia due to a recent change of time zone).  </s>
<s> Questions to be considered during the meeting: A. Principle 1: Does guideline 1.1 need to be clarified specifically to include metadata?  </s>
<s> Can it too easily be misconstrued as excluding it, given the historical usage surrounding the term "text equivalent" in WCAG 1.0?  </s>
<s> Current wording: "1.1 Provide a textual equivalent for every non-text (auditory or graphical) component or multimedia presentation."  </s>
<s> Do you favour Andi's suggested restatement of the guidelines under Principle 1, namely: 1.1 Provide a description for each image.  </s>
<s> 1.2 Provide a transcript for audio content.  </s>
<s> 1.3 Provide synchronized captions of the audio portion of a multimedia presentation if it is required for understanding.  </s>
<s> Otherwise, provide a transcript of the audio.  </s>
<s> For example, an animated tutorial video with audio descriptions of the animation should provide synchronized text captions.  </s>
<s> For a simple video of a person giving a speech, it is sufficient to provide a text transcript of the speech.  </s>
<s> 1.4 Provide synchronized audio descriptions of the video portion of a multimedia presentation if is is required for understanding.  </s>
<s> For example, a video of a classroom lecture should provide synchronized audio descriptions of visual materials used that are not described in the lecture audio.  </s>
<s> A video of a person giving a speech does not require an audio description.  </s>
<s> B. Principle 2: Does William's proposed introduction provide an appropriate explanation of this principle and the guidelines which have been placed under it?  </s>
<s> How could his exposition be improved?  </s>
<s> Is such an introduction adequate to promote understanding of the document among web content developers who, though well acquainted with the technology, do not have prior knowledge of the principles and concepts of accessible design?  </s>
<s> C. Principle 3 (deleted from latest draft): Under some circumstances it may be necessary for the author to provide more than simply a marked up document or a data model.  </s>
<s> Concretely, a style sheet, programmatic object, transformation procedure or other infrastructure may be required in order to enable the user agent effectively to process and render the content in the user's preferred modality.  </s>
<s> How should this issue be addressed in the guidelines?  </s>
<s> D. Principle 4: some of these requirements need to be expressed more precisely and in greater detail.  </s>
<s> Are there any volunteers?precisely and in greater detail.  </s>
<s> Do you have any suggestions?  </s>
<s> E.  </s>
<s> Any other action items or issues raised by working group members may also be discussed.  </s>
<s> AS:: "1.2 Provide a transcript for audio content."  </s>
<s> WL: I worry that "audio" content might require some really weird "transcript".  </s>
<s> Music, sound effects, etc. often beggar descriptions, let alone "transcripts".  </s>
<s> While it's probably OK to assume that most users can deal with text (although that's not even universally accepted), it would be very hard to require that a musical score be furnished.  </s>
<s> I think we'd best talk this one through a bit more.  </s>
<s> I more or less prefer the language in the "reformulation" draft even though it's perhaps not as specific as that proposed here for guidelines.  </s>
<s> "1.1 Provide a textual equivalent for every non-text (auditory or graphical) component " has the "every" problem - one is never sure that *all* possible non-text components are capable of having an equivalent (or even that "auditory or graphical" covers all the possibilities) that's expressible.  </s>
<s> But since that's rather deep picking of nits, then I'd prefer it stand.  </s>
<s> The less confident "Provide text equivalents for non-text items where feasible/important" might even suffice.  </s>
<s> The Principles should be a bit lofty without being too vague, IMO.  </s>
<s> How many and which guidelines are chosen is sort of what we're about as well as how specific they must get.  </s>
<s> The line between "too dense" and "too 'DUH!'" is quite narrow.  </s>
<s> Do we want to require extensive knowledge/experience or insult intelligence?  </s>
<s> As to the dropped Principle 3: it is to be hoped that "2.3  </s>
<s> Where presentation is used to communicate distinctions of meaning or structure within the content, ensure that the meaning is captured in the markup."  </s>
<s> might be a template for addressing the missing items Jason evokes in "a style sheet, programmatic object, transformation procedure or other infrastructure may be required..." if we can find some general term that includes *anything* that evokes semantics.  </s>
<s> The guidelines are requiring that the author examine a fundamental (usually visual) prejudice that overlooks that sometimes she's using how things *look* to express what things *mean* and this is not an easily understood concept by people whose native tongue so often uses "blind" pejoratively.  </s>
<s> When we undertake an attack on some unrealized assumptions that almost everyone makes, we lay out a tough course, but if we persevere...  </s>
<s> One problem with the "just a click away" is that "just" is taken so much for granted - there are too many cases of recognizing something "*just* by looking at it" and in many ways that's not very different from Anglocentrism and other problems of translation.  </s>
<s> As to Principle 4 we are asking the author to consider not only people with "differences" but also machines, some of which haven't even been invented yet!  </s>
<s> However some updatable list of potential devices might help.  </s>
<s> An urge to think about the site being accessed by WebTV, WebPhones, Search Engines, Voice Browsers, Text-only Browsers, Screens ranging from those filling a wall to those projected on eyegless lenses - is a heavy requirement, but if we are to really espouse "Universal Design Principles" that's what has to be done.  </s>
<s> The alternative is to make a separate series of Webs for these various devices and that *will* lead to exclusion.  </s>
<s> CC/PP isn't yet a "magic bullet" to handle content negotiation but it (or something very like it) will prevail.  </s>
<s> After all the "CC" stands for "Client Capability" and that can be very detailed in principle.  </s>
<s> However our guidelines must encourage/require the author to make it at least feasible to have "negotiable content" so that there is a basis for negotiation.  </s>
<s> Hope somebody reads this g !  </s>
<s> Love.  </s>
<s> ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE  </s>
<s> Here's some thought.  </s>
<s> Audio is not a form of content.  </s>
<s> Audio is a _medium_ by which content can be conveyed.  </s>
<s> If the audio medium is used, the content must be conveyed in a manner appropriate for the medium -- e.g., a "good" soundtrack may include musical interludes.  </s>
<s> However, that music might _not_ be the content.  </s>
<s> (In some cases it will be.  </s>
<s> In some cases it will not, and is merely part of the presentation.)  </s>
<s> The _content_ must be expressed in a way that does not tie it solely to the audio medium.  </s>
<s> The "audio" adjective on the word content is both unnecessary -and confusing- as it seems to imply that ALL audio presentation must somehow be transcribed into text, and that should not be the case.  </s>
<s> Our general rule should be to provide alternate representation (i.e. marked up text) for all content which is provided in an audio format.  </s>
<s> Let's say I have a web site which plays the opening theme song from the Voyager tv show to people with sound enabled.  </s>
<s> I don't need to reproduce that theme song in a musical markup language; it's _decorative_, although it may be considered "audio content" by some.  </s>
<s> However, it is not the -content- of the site.  </s>
<s> If I put a speech online, the _content_ is what was said, and how it was said.  </s>
<s> It is likely -not- the audio recording of the speech, _even though the speech contains the content_; they are not one and the same.  </s>
<s> Likewise, a transcript may contain the content, but the content is an abstract beast and it is not the transcript any more than it is the recording.  </s>
<s> This is not a pipe.  </s>

<s> I inadvertently omitted the telephone number from the meeting agenda.  </s>
<s> The teleconference is to be held, as usual, on the W3C/MIT Longfellow bridge: There were several other errors in the agenda, which was prepared in a hurry, but none which should in any way affect the conduct of the meeting.  </s>
<s> One small additional comment on audio.  </s>
<s> Kynn's example of background music on a site is like 'decorative graphics', while the score is not needed I might like to know that it is there and perhaps the title of the music used.  </s>

<s> We have to distinguish "might like to know" from "need to know in order to access the content," or else we are talking less about accessibility and usability, and more about your personal preferences.  </s>
<s> There are some cases in which _I_ might like to know the title of a song that's playing, but I don't consider it an _accessibility_ problem that it hasn't been provided for me.  </s>
<s> If the title were essential to understanding the material on the page, then yes, it would be an accessibility problem.  </s>
<s> (Note that personal preferences are not a bad thing -- in fact, in the Edapta model, it's key to the technology, which is why at Edapta we tend to talk about going beyond "just" accessibility.) --Kynn Kynn Bartlett kynn@idyllmtn.com  </s>
