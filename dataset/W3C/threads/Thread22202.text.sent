Things have been pretty quiet here the last few weeks. 
I know that I have been preoccupied with completing taxes and other fun stuff. 
Could we have a quick poll on everyone's activities? 
I'm particular interested in the status of ASLS tests and HTML-compatible versions of the core tests. 
I'm currently migrating the xmlconf event tests over to DOMTSML. 
Getting the events tests working is a good preliminary for the load/save tests which will have to deal with the same type of issues. 
Hopefully, will be able to commit some stuff in the next few days. 
I've not been following the JSUnit enhancements. 
It would be really stellar, if selecting a test in the test runner page could display a test specific configuration dialog in a frame or other window. 
That would provide an opportunity to configure the test by selecting the processor to use, whether to validate, etc. 
I wrote an initial test, after that the conclusion was that we needed an update on the stylesheet to write ls tests. 
(inner class issue for filters) We don't have the time to work on the stylesheet, we will convert our testsuite once the stylesheet is available.

According to http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-dom- ts/2002Apr/0014.html 
(inlined) that I sent a couple of weeks ago, we're working on 1 and 3, and need to continue with 2. Also, as Jeroen indicates, we'd have to produce a level 3 transform before X-Hive can start converting tests. 
All, In order to be able to release the full level 1 DOM TS, we need to look into the following issues: 1. Framework. 
A contact has been made between Bob and Edward on the JsUnit framework. 
People from this list have volounteered to help in the effort, so please feel free to tell us what you need help with. 
[dd] Work is undergoing, I need to report on running on IE/NS(mozilla) for Mac 2. HTML tests. 
We still need to sanitycheck the HTML tests, both the transcribed NIST ones and the submitted ones from Netscape. 
Has aynoen built/run those? 
[dd] This is what we need to concentrate on 3. Grant of license wording. 
Philippe, do you have the final woringd yet? 
[dd] Work underway, we can still release the full level 1 suite without solving this, but we need to look into it for tests that are to be submitted from now on. 
Other things: I have personally heard nothing on using the DOM TS in IE for Mac and have had no follow up from the Microsoft representative I spoke to during the W3C Tech Plenary. 
Also, if possible, could someone run the level 2 TS in IE on Windows and report the results to me? 
I need to report back to the DOM IG list on results and would prefer having the results from a clean Windows environment test reather than doing it in my Windows emulation environment. 
Further comments inlined /Dimitris [dd] this would be in line with what many have stated they want for the ECMA TS. 
However, you yourself indicated that this could grow out of proportion if we were to do the same thing for Java in need to strike a fair tradeoff somewhere. 
We are currently adding subject lines to the level1 and level2 HTML tests and should be able to commit them soon. 
I've been getting inconsistent results when running the HTML tests on both Mozilla and IE6 using jsUnit. 
I used Curt's suggestion(see below) on Mozilla and added a dummy test at the beginning of each interface and am getting 10 errors out of the 442 tests. 
You might try editing alltests.html 
and take the first test of each "family" and duplicating it and calling the first one something like, "testHTMLAnchorElementXX" and run the test again and ignore any test failures on the XX tests. 
That should at least clarify which tests are really failing and which ones might be being run before the document has been completely loaded. 
I've not had as much success on IE6. 
The results have been very inconsistent. 
I'll run the tests and 130 errors will be reported. 
I'll close the browser and run the tests again without making any changes and will have 120 errors.
