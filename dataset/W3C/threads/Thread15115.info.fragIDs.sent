<s> Thanks Gregg Here is the revised draft of 4.1  </s>
<s> Checkpoint 4.1 Write as clearly and simply as is [appropriate / possible] for the purpose of the content.  </s>
<s> Reviewer's Note: This item is under discussion.  </s>
<s> There is consensus for  </s>

<s> We do not therefore have something for the draft at this time.  </s>
<s> There is a list below of items that are being explored for inclusion either as success criteria or as Advisory Recommendations.  </s>
<s> We are also compliling a longer list (approx 50 items) of different ideas that relate to this checkpoint.  </s>
<s> Comments, suggestions and contributions to the discusssion and work on this topic are welcome.  </s>
<s> Refer to the issues list for more information.  </s>

<s> The following are additional ideas for enhancing a site along this particular dimension: Note: It is very difficult to determine what makes writing clear and simple for all topics.  </s>
<s> Some content is derived from other sources and is  </s>
<s> copyrighted so it cannot be altered.  </s>
<s> Some materials or topics cannot be  </s>
<s> communicated accurately in simple language.  </s>
<s> Also, since some people cannot understand the content no matter how simply it is written, it is  </s>
<s> not possible to make any content accessible to everyone.  </s>
<s> Specific objective criteria that could be applied across all types of content are  </s>

<s> PARTIAL LIST OF ITEMS BEING EXPLORED FOR INCLUSION AS SUCCESS CRITERIA OR ADVISORY RECOMMENDATIONS.  </s>
<s> 1. Content under site control is written as clearly and simply as the author feels [appropriate / possible] for the purpose of the content.  </s>
<s> 2. A statement is provided on the site which asserts that those responsible for the site have reviewed the materials on the site and the content under their control is written as clearly and simply as they feel is [appropriate / possible] for the purpose of the content.  </s>
<s> 3. Summaries and/or simpler forms are provided for key pages or sections of the site.  </s>
<s> 4. Provide an outline or a summary for your document.  </s>
<s> 5. Break up long paragraphs into shorter ones, with one idea per paragraph.  </s>
<s> 6. Break up long sentences into shorter ones.  </s>
<s> 7. Provide accurate unique page titles.  </s>
<s> 8. Ensure that headings and link text are unique and that they make sense when read out of context.  </s>
<s> 9. Provide definitions for any jargon or specialized terminology used in your document.  </s>
<s> 10.  </s>
<s> Provide explanations of figurative, metaphorical, or idiomatic uses of language (for example, 'haven't seen you in a coons age' or 'the sight tore my heart out').  </s>
<s> 11.  </s>
<s> Language should be used that your intended audience ought to be familiar with.  </s>
<s> 12.  </s>
<s> When introducing new concepts or terms, they should be defined or annotated in language that the audience is expected to be familiar with, or definitions or explanations should be linked to that might be easier to understand.  </s>
<s> Reviewer's Note: The list above is a partial list of ideas.  </s>

<s> It seems to me that the note to "additional ideas" in this draft is in error, and in any case does not reflect the consensus of the group.  </s>
<s> I would  </s>
<s> prefer that it was removed, and this section was marked "under construction".  </s>
<s> The fact that this is under discussion is reflected by the reviewer's note,  </s>
<s> and the additional note simply claims that it is not possible to have success  </s>
<s> criteria (which would mean that there is no point in further discussion of  </s>
<s> them).  </s>
<s> Charles McCN  </s>
<s> Hi Charles, Actually, that note has been there for a long time - unchanged.  </s>
<s> But since the whole 4.1 is being posted as an open question, it probably makes sense to pull that as text and perhaps change it into a readers note that is less definite.  </s>
<s> That way we may get more input on the topic.  </s>
<s> It is so late in the game I don't know if we can still do this but how about we change it to a reviewer's note that says Reviewer's Note: This checkpoint is very difficult and the group is wrestling with several problems.  </s>
<s> 1) It is very difficult to determine what makes writing clear and simple for all topics.  </s>
<s> 2) Some content is derived from other sources and is copyrighted so it cannot be altered.  </s>
<s> 3) Some materials or topics cannot be communicated accurately in simple language.  </s>
<s> 4) sometimes the form is specific to the intent, (poetry, exposition ) 5) Since some people cannot understand the content no matter how simply it is written, it is not possible to make any content accessible to everyone.  </s>
<s> It is difficult to find specific objective criteria that could be applied across all types of content.  </s>
<s> Any input on ways to address these issues is solicited.  </s>
<s> IF NO ONE HAS AN OBJECTION TO CHANGING THE TEXT TO A READERS NOTE FOR THE TR RELEASE -- PLEASE POST A MEMO IMMEDIATELY.  </s>
<s> Otherwise I will try to push this through.  </s>
<s> It will leave the questions sound less final, and might solicit more input to this very tough area.  </s>
