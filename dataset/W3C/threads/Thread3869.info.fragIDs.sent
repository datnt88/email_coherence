<s> There is a neat trick you can use for this: just declare your namespace as an extension namespace.  </s>
<s> xsl:stylesheet xmlns:x="my.accessibility.namespace"  </s>
<s> extension-element-prefixes="x"  </s>
<s> The XSLT processor is required to ignore extension instructions in a  </s>
<s> namespace that it does not recognize.  </s>

<s> That it be possible to utilise a given namespace for (effectively) comments, i.e. the named namespace is not treated as a literal and output.  </s>
<s> Rationale: E.g. constructing an outline of the stylesheet operation, explanatory documentation, providing multi-modal representations, etc.  </s>
<s> Perhaps something like xsl:ns-ignore prefix='doc'/ The stylesheet application then simply bypasses anything in that namespace, treating it as a comment.  </s>
<s> This would support conformance to the XML accessibility guidelines.  </s>

<s> Oh. I use this trick a lot but I always throw in an empty xsl:fallback element as well I thought this was needed and was surprised by your comment  </s>
<s> the XSLT 1.0 spec seems a bit obscure here.  </s>
<s> 14.1 says An XSLT processor must not signal an error merely because a template contains an extension element for which no implementation is available.  </s>
<s> However the preceding sentence is When such an extension element is instantiated, then the XSLT processor must perform fallback for the element as specified in [15 Fallback].  </s>
<s> and fallback says: if the instruction element has one or more xsl:fallback children, then the content of each of the xsl:fallback children must be instantiated in sequence; otherwise, an error must be signaled.  </s>
<s> I have always read this as saying if there are no xsl;fallback elements then the "otherwise" clause implies that an error will be signaled.  </s>
