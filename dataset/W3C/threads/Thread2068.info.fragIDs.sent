<s> I have seen the HTTP-NG page, but it is my understanding that there is some provisional specifics called HTTP-1.1 .  </s>

<s> They are not the same thing.  </s>
<s> HTTP/1.1 is what is being called the set of extensions to the HTTP/1.0 protocol which are known to be desirable for HTTP1 applications but cannot be implemented properly without some indication that both sides understand the extension.  </s>
<s> Some of these extensions are already listed in the published 1.0 draft -- they will be split off into a separate specification for the next draft.  </s>
<s> NOTE: these are protocol extensions, not server-feature extensions.  </s>

<s> HTTP-NG and HTTP 1.1 are different; HTTP 1.1 is a collection of minor modifications to HTTP 1.0 that are mostly backwards compatible, but which are too major to make into into the HTTP 1.0 spec.  </s>
<s> HTTP-NG is rather more distant from HTTP 1.0 in syntax; it is a binary protocol designed for higher performance and better integration with security and payment schemes.  </s>
<s> A more detailed draft of HTTP-NG is currently under preparation for Danvers (Dave Raggett will be translating from Simonese to English).  </s>
