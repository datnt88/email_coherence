Hi Dave, 
The facility to convert old-fashioned FONT tags etc. to STYLE in HTML Tidy is brilliant, and has certainly helped this novice who was fighting with the STYLE syntax - thank you! 
I find the font size 
percentages that are substituted for the old FONT SIZE="+1" etc. don't accurately reflect how my browser (Netscape 4.7 on a Macintosh) treats the old integer values: is this a symptom of the PC/Macintosh and Netscape/Explorer incompatibilities? 
There are some slightly surprising omissions from these "stylising" conversions though: Colour and background image data, traditionaly added to the BODY tag, can now be encoded within the STYLE definitions. 
B and U tags can also be encoded in STYLE, but Tidy doesn't. 
Would it be a reasonable request that you add these to the list of extra features to implement on a rainy afternoon? 
(We *do* get plenty of those in England at this time of year :-) TTFN, Peter Home: Barney.Wol@noctua.demon.co.uk Work: Peter_Vince@yahoo.co.uk PGP id = 0x332B72C0 PGP fingerprint: 3535 9AD9 C0EA 3606 0DE4 3811 422E 10B4 332B 72C0 
Would you want to add the facility to remove WordPerfect BR WP="BR1" codes and BR WP="BR2" codes as you have for Word 2000 codes? 
(I don't THINK Tidy can do that yet ...). 
I don't think even conversion to br / is necessary, as they seem to replicate the line breaks at the ends of paragraph elements. 
Thanks,

The problem is it can not make presentational markup structural, so in most cases the HTML you get is syntactically and presentationally (on the latest Browsers) correct, but it is not good. 
For example: Word 97/98 exports headings (even if defined in Word correctly) as 'big bold standard-text', not as h1 ... h6 . 
Tidy can convert all the ugly FONT SIZE="5" to CSS but it cannot revert 
those lines of 'big bold standard-text' to real HTML-headings. 
They could but (in contrast to the FONT-element) they are no problem in accessibility and don't harm anybody if defined in complete. 
Defining them (or something different) may be done with CSS additionally. 
In most cases they should rather be replaced by another HTML-element representing their structural meaning like STRONG or EM and the STYLE-Definition should be set for these elements. 
Just converting them to span class="..." would not produce good HTML.

Actually, that is just what Tidy tries to do. 
See AddFontSize() in clean.c. 
The rule of thumb is imperfect but works fairly well.

Can you tell me more about these? 
How would a paragraph appear in html when exported from WordPerfect?
