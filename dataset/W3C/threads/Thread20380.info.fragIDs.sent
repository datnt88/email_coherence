<s> The copyright notice at the bottom of Manual.html should have the copyright character as well.  </s>
<s> I believe that it is required by law to be valid and if it isn't, it wouldn't hurt to have it anyway.  </s>
<s> My research has indicated that the symbol is required with the exception of web pages since it does not always render.  </s>
<s> For web pages, it is best practice to use both the word and the symbol.  </s>
<s> Strictly put, nothing is required for a copyright to exist, except the creation of the work.  </s>
<s> However, AFAIK, to use the marking as a claim, one must use either the standard symbol, or the string "copyright", with (c) not being an option.  </s>
