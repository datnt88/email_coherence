Is there any difference in these two constructs as to when the condition is evaluated? 
In particular, I am looking for a construct that will evaluate the condition FIRST before the action is even executed one time. 
It is unclear from the documentation when the condition is evaluated for each of these constructs. 
I understand the difference between the two constructs with respect to functionality (repeat-while performs an action while a condition is true, repeat-until performs an action until a condition becomes true). 
I just don't understand when the condition is evaluated.

Many years ago, when I used to teach programming, the standard way to characterize these constructions differed in exactly this way. 
Repeat-while tests for the condition, exits if it is false and does the operation if the condition is true, then loops. 
Repeat-until does the operation, tests for the condition, exits if it is true, and otherwise loops. 
So while while may never act, until always acts at least once. 
I'd recommend this, it is very handy.

Thanks Pat. 
That make sense. 
Is there any chance of having this restriction added into the OWL-S documentation to minimize ambiguity?
