<s> Is there any difference in these two constructs as to when the condition is evaluated?  </s>
<s> In particular, I am looking for a construct that will evaluate the condition FIRST before the action is even executed one time.  </s>
<s> It is unclear from the documentation when the condition is evaluated for each of these constructs.  </s>
<s> I understand the difference between the two constructs with respect to functionality (repeat-while performs an action while a condition is true, repeat-until performs an action until a condition becomes true).  </s>
<s> I just don't understand when the condition is evaluated.  </s>

<s> Many years ago, when I used to teach programming, the standard way to characterize these constructions differed in exactly this way.  </s>
<s> Repeat-while tests for the condition, exits if it is false and does the operation if the condition is true, then loops.  </s>
<s> Repeat-until does the operation, tests for the condition, exits if it is true, and otherwise loops.  </s>
<s> So while while may never act, until always acts at least once.  </s>
<s> I'd recommend this, it is very handy.  </s>

<s> That make sense.  </s>
<s> Is there any chance of having this restriction added into the OWL-S documentation to minimize ambiguity?  </s>
