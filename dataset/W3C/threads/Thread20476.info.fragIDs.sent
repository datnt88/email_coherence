<s> Hi, I have problems creating links with Amaya 5.3 in a XHTML 1.1 document, but I have not problems in a XHTML 1.0 document.  </s>
<s> In a XHTML 1.0 document, when I click the target icon with the hand, the link is always created.  </s>
<s> But in a XHTML 1.1 document, when I click the target icon, Amaya opens an Attribute window.  </s>
<s> Perhaps the problem is that the hand that creates the link is waiting for a "name" attribute, and in XHTML 1.1 there is only an "id" attribute in an anchor.  </s>
<s> I use a Windows 98 SE computer.  </s>
<s> Best regards, Barto  </s>
<s> Hello Barto, I don't have this problem with my version.  </s>
<s> The only time I have the Attribute window in this case is when I click slightly beside the target icon.  </s>
<s> What is the message of the opened Attribute window ?  </s>
<s> Regards, Laurent Carcone Amaya team  </s>
<s> I have had this problem with Amaya 5.2 not making links to targets that only have an id.  </s>
<s> But maybe it has been fixed already in the CVS version?  </s>
