- using rdf:dType for datatyping - that S-P/TDL is used for global typing You mean the modified bNode variant of the local idiom, The what? 
This allows parsers to remain unchanged, insofar as datatyping is concerned, and folks to choose to use datatyping or not. 
If legacy content using the inline idiom should be typed, then it should be explicitly converted by the user, rather than automatically by a parser. 
This seems fairer to me. 
Eh? 
I look forward to reviewing your joint proposal. 
I would be happy to take a stab at rewriting the TDL spec, sans MT, renaming it just the "Datatyping Proposal", and extending the verbage taking into account the convergence characteristics and updating the illustrations for the revised global idiom -- and then pass that on to Sergey, Pat, Jeremy, whomever for edits, fixes, and addition of the MT. Thank you Patrick. 
I think this means that I've seen both you and Sergey agree to this. 
I think its up to you and Sergey to agree how best to get this document done. 
However, Sergey's suggestion of keeping it simple (email format?), focussing on the core agreements/issues, and starting from Pat's recent email, which is neutral territory, might permit a faster and more interactive evolution of a proposal/agreement. 
Can both you and Sergey make the half hour after this Friday's telecon to work out how to get this done? 
Time is critical here. 
I'm travelling for the remainder of the week, but could have that done for sure by start of business Monday, EST. 
Bummer. 
Which week? 
Will you have email? 
How does that sound? 
In general, encouraging. 
Brian I'm not sure if my earlier post got through (blasted web emailer, don't have my own machine at the moment)... 
So here's the reply again. 
Possibly. 
I'll be at Heathrow during the concall waiting for my flight back to Finland. 
I think I'll have still 30 mins after the call, but may have to run earlier than that.

I have sporadic email access. 
Probably won't check my mail till tomorrow morning (and that's not certain). 
Attached is a working draft of the convergence proposal. 
I think there's enough there and from the recent posts for the MT afficionados to work on that in parallel. 
Yes? Patrick On Thursday, February 7, 2002, at 03:40 , Stickler Patrick (NRC/Tampere) Rats. 
As it turns out, my flight leaves at 16:25 (I had for some reason remembered 16:55) so I may even have to leave the regular telecon a few minutes early.
