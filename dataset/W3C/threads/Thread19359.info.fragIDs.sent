Hallo, I use the latest amaya bin from amaya-LINUX-ELF-4.0.tgz (on Linux obviously). 
If I follow -- http://www.w3.org/Math/ -- LaTeX2HTML MathML package all amaya windows hang. 
I connect via a local proxy (squid). 
any comments ?

It works on my linux platform. 
The best is to compile Amaya with the -g option and without the -O2 option, and to check where the application hangs. 
I suspect a trouble with system events on your platform. 
Irene. 
the latest 4.1 (as pulled from CVS) is ok! Maybe you want to make your binary distribution site offering the 4.1 binary ?
