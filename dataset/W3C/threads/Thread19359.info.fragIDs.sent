<s> Hallo, I use the latest amaya bin from amaya-LINUX-ELF-4.0.tgz (on Linux obviously).  </s>
<s> If I follow -- http://www.w3.org/Math/ -- LaTeX2HTML MathML package all amaya windows hang.  </s>
<s> I connect via a local proxy (squid).  </s>
<s> any comments ?  </s>

<s> It works on my linux platform.  </s>
<s> The best is to compile Amaya with the -g option and without the -O2 option, and to check where the application hangs.  </s>
<s> I suspect a trouble with system events on your platform.  </s>
<s> Irene.  </s>
<s> the latest 4.1 (as pulled from CVS) is ok! Maybe you want to make your binary distribution site offering the 4.1 binary ?  </s>
