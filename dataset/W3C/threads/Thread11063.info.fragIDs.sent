Note: On this item, the ERB is leaning towards using the terms link, with the obvious meeting, pointer for the pointy bits that point at things, and for the third term, what the current spec calls anchor, the ERB is contemplating link end, end, and terminus. 
For the time being, and in order that Jon can read this without getting headaches, the spec has been adjusted to use link, pointer, and terminus. 
1.4.a 
What do we call the container used to hold the bits that point at other things? 
(in current discussion: link) 1.4.b 
What do we call the bits that point at other things? 
(in current discussion: pointer) 
1.4.c 
What do we call the things that are pointed at? 
(in current 
discussion: terminus) 
During the ERB meeting, my esteemed Co-editor pointed out that a word that is synonym for both "target" and "end" is... "butt". 
So instead of termini, we could have butts. 
Multi-butt links. 
Butt modes. 
Butt syntax. 
I like this.

I think we might add to this: 1.4.d 
What do we call the things that point at other things as well as are pointed at? 
This follows from my other message regarding links (nee HTML Anchors) that contained both NAME and HREF attributes. 
Murray Murray Altheim, Program Manager Spyglass, Inc., Cambridge, Massachusetts "Give a monkey the tools and he'll eventually build a typewriter." 
I don't think there is any such thing in XML. 
[ * * * Warning: HyTime spoken below; feel free to skip * * * ] The only thing that can point at other things as well as be pointed at is a location address-form element "X" which is referenced by a locator "Y", where "Y" has an explicit reference resolution level. 
Otherwise locator "Y" references whatever "X" points to, and not "X" itself. 
XML doesn't have reflevel or any equivalent thereof, so this situation is as far as I can tell impossible. 
[ * * * HyTime warning over, you can keep reading now :-) * * * ] 
In this case, the A element can be, in the current terminology, one of: + A HREF=... : a link and a terminus (of that same link) + A NAME=... : a (potential) terminus (of some other link) + A NAME=... HREF=... : both of the above. 
Here the pointer -- the thing which points at something else -- is the HREF attribute, and there does not appear to be a way for this to be pointed at.
