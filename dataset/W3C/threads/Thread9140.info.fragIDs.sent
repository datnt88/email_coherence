<s> Unfortunately, I was unable to attend part of the meeting, however I hope that doesn't prevent me from making comments on the decisions you came to.  </s>
<s> On rdfs-versioning:  </s>
<s> The WG decided to close this issue without action since it is a known problem that is very hard to solve and is outside the scope of this WG.  </s>
<s> I strongly, vehemently, totally disagree with this decision.  </s>
<s> This is a simple matter.  </s>
<s> As I wrote in: comments/2001JanMar/0047.html  </s>
<s> The RDFS spec states: "this specification recommends that a new namespace URI should be declared whenever an RDF schema is changed."  </s>
<s> (Other than confusing namespace URIs with schema URIs) this statement is a rather silly requirement.  </s>
<s> This is no hard problem.  </s>
<s> All that is needed is to simply remove, or soften the wording in the spec on this matter.  </s>
<s> As it stands, the vast majority of schemas (including the RDF Schema Schema itself!  </s>
<s> - due to character encoding changes) would be in violation of this recommendation.  </s>
<s> This wording must be fixed.  </s>
<s> ** XML Fragments The fragment spec (http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-fragment) is in W3C CR phase.  </s>
<s> I don't completely grasp the specification after a first look through, but it appears to do what we want.  </s>
<s> It defines what it calls the FCS, or a fragment content specification.  </s>
<s> The FCS infoset seems to include all information that is possibly relevant to the fragment.  </s>
<s> It then packages it so that it may be stored in an XML document.  </s>
<s> Here is an example of a package, taken from the spec: p:fcs xmlns:f="http://www.w3.org/2001/02/xml-fragment" sourcelocn="http://acme.com/trans1234#root().child(1,purchase).child(2,book)  </s>

<s> ** rdfs-constraining-containers You have closed this issue claiming:  </s>
<s> other languages such as (DAML+OIL, WebOnt, prose) can express those contraints (sic)  </s>
<s> I would request that the Working Group provide an example of how these constraints can be described in DAML+OIL.  </s>

<s> ** Task Forces A note on task forces: although it does not seem practical to set up lists for each task force that has been created, I strongly request that they all live in public space.  </s>

<s> Hi Aaron,  </s>
<s> The WG decided to close this issue without action since it is a known problem that is very hard to solve and is outside the scope of this WG.  </s>
<s> I guess that counts as dissent.  </s>
<s> The RDFS spec states: "this specification recommends that a new namespace URI should be declared whenever an RDF schema is changed."  </s>
<s> (Other than confusing namespace URIs with schema URIs) this statement is a rather silly requirement.  </s>
<s> I think maybe I should raise my hands to be the cause of this difficulty.  </s>
<s> raised questions of change management of schemas suggesting a need for facilities for deprecating classes and schemas and properties to indicate 'obsoletedBy', 'supercedes' etc.  </s>
<s> I conflated this issue with the one you raised in on the grounds it would be better to consider both at the same time.  </s>
<s> My reading of the situation is that the original issue raised by Jonas has been closed.  </s>
<s> I suggest you propose some new text for the working draft to address the issue you raised.  </s>
<s> other languages such as (DAML+OIL, WebOnt, prose) can express those contraints (sic)  </s>
<s> Are you dissenting from the decision to close this issue?  </s>
<s> If so, on what grounds?  </s>
<s> Brian  </s>
<s> I propose section 4.1.2.  </s>
<s> Versioning and URI references is removed.  </s>
<s> other languages such as (DAML+OIL, WebOnt, prose) can express those contraints (sic)  </s>
<s> I dissent on the grounds that this resolution of the issue does not actually resolve the issue.  </s>
<s> I do not consider the issue resolved until you have an example of how to state these  </s>
<s> constraints in RDF.  </s>

<s> OR... the group has agreed that this matter does not need to be solved by this group, no?  </s>
<s> Maybe the closure here should be to move the issue to the future features pile?  </s>
