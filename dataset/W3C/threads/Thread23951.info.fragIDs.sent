<s> I am trying to get the possible choices for a select1 statement from one instance, and the actual values of the selects from a different instance.  </s>
<s> The problem is, in Chiba, the latter is ignored, and all select boxes show only the first alternative.  </s>

<s> Hi Victor,  </s>
<s> There are three problems here.  </s>
<s> The first is that in your code you have nested the second xf:bind within the first: (I assume there is a closing /xf:bind that you have snipped.  </s>
<s> If there isn't, then this is invalid XML anyway, all of the following is irrelevant,  </s>
<s> and you just need to fix your mark-up be stopping this being a nested bind!)  </s>
<s> Nested binds *are* allowed, but the nodeset of the nested bind you have specified would be: job/result which I assume is not what you want.  </s>
<s> The second problem is that a nested bind is supposed to iterate over the nodeset produced by its parent, and this causes problems if you try to label  </s>
<s> the nested bind.  </s>
<s> For example, if you have:  </s>
<s> it is obvious that the nodeset "b1" represents a nodeset of all x nodes.  </s>
<s> If you then nest a bind: it is also obvious that we want the readonly MIP to be true for all: x/y However, consider the following instance data: If you concatenate the two @nodeset values together (the parent bind and the nested bind) you get the XPath expression: x/y which will correctly find all 'y' nodes that are children of 'x' nodes.  </s>
<s> In our above bind statements, this will set them all to readonly.  </s>
<s> In other words this construct: is equivalent to this: However, nested binds are not about simply concatenating the XPath statements.  </s>
<s> The following is valid, for example: which shows that you have to iterate the nested nodeset 'y', across each iteration of the parent nodeset 'x'.  </s>
<s> If you don't, then not all 'x' nodes will be set correctly.  </s>
<s> I would suggest checking whatever implementations you use for your projects to ensure that this is how they work.  </s>
<s> If you are producing forms that should run on a number of processors then you would be best to avoid labelling your nested binds.  </s>
<s> However, even if you sort this out, not all implementations will behave as you expect - the third problem!  </s>
<s> - since the exact behaviour of an xf:select(1) that takes its selection choices from one instance and places the result in another is still being debated on the Working Group.  </s>
<s> Our formsPlayer implementation does allow this, but we did have to a little shuffling to make this work, so the WG is just trying to ensure that the current implementations are all agreed on how it should be done.  </s>
<s> I'm not sure if that helps you, but at least you know what the issues are!  </s>
