<s> I'm not sure what your question is, Al.  </s>
<s> The fact that the IMG ALT is defined as a space is irrelevant.  </s>
<s> If TITLE is null, then no tooltip is appropriate.  </s>
<s> If in the example given a UA represents the space by a tooltip, that UA is BAD (Broken As Designed).  </s>
<s> I've been through all this before on www-html in the thread to which I referred.  </s>
<s> IMO IMG TAG should *never* be used as a tooltip, since it is ALTernative textual content to replace an image which is not available to the user agent, whereas tooltips are supplementary information.  </s>
<s> Provision of the former as the latter in an environment in which the original image has already been rendered merely provides confusing clutter in the display.  </s>

<s> Yes, I think that part's clear.  </s>
<s> Seems to me, though, that there's an extra complication that hasn't been discussed.  </s>
<s> Consider an image used as an anchor link, as they often are.  </s>
<s> Then we in fact have three items (and their purposes are more or less as I give them here, I believe): 1.  </s>
<s> The IMG ALT - provides alternative text for the image 2. The IMG TITLE - provides supplementary information about the image itself, 3. The Anchor TITLE - provides supplementary information about the target of the anchor link.  </s>
<s> My question would be, how should these items be displayed or otherwise made available?  </s>
<s> There's general agreement that the ALT text must be displayed _instead_ of the IMG, when the IMG isn't viewed.  </s>
<s> MSIE uses item 2 as a tooltip.  </s>
<s> However, Opera (at least some versions) uses item 3 as the tooltip.  </s>
<s> I can see logic in both approaches.  </s>
<s> Should all three be somehow available, and if so, how?  </s>
