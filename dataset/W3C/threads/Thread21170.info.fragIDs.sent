<s> In the Image directory dialog, could replacing text be set automatically to Add Image file name?  </s>

<s> The Idea behind the alt attribute is to explain what the image represents if you cannot see the picture.  </s>
<s> The filename or the image path isn't an explanation at all... so we cannot recommand that as an "alternate image"...  </s>
<s> No. This would contravene checkpoint 3.4 of the Authoriong Tool Accessibility Guidelines - make it harder to improve the accessibility support of Amaya.  </s>
<s> The text should be put there by an author, and be something that can replace the image in a text-only browser - for example "W3C" is used as an alternative for the W3C icon on W3C pages, and "Amaya" for the Amaya icon.  </s>
<s> Other things which are clear in context might be "search", "hearing loss increases as people get older", "bookmark this page!" or "read all about new anti-spam products!!!!". (Yes, many people who rely on the text version of a page such as people who are blind *do* want access to advertising).  </s>
<s> In Amaya you can quickly test whether your alternative text is equivalent in meaning by reading the page in the "alternate view", one of the options under the view menu.  </s>
<s> One particular trick is to use a single space for an equivalent where the image doesn't really mean anything.  </s>
<s> For example a decorative corner in a table (bad idea anyway, but if you must...) or a blank space to force some particular layout.  </s>
<s> One thing that would be useful in Amaya is a checkbox on the image dialog to include a null alt - alt="" rather than a single space - in this case.  </s>
<s> There is still a risk taht people will misuse it, but at least it allows people to meeet widely recommended best practice if they have thought about the role of the image.  </s>
<s> A related bugfix is to ensure that img elements that have no alt attribute at all are flagged as validation errors, and ideally there is a prompt for some value which includes a preview of the image.  </s>
<s> (A preview of the image in the insert image dialog would be really cool in general, and the ability to use the linking interface to select an image to insert would also be cool.  </s>
<s> I will write this up more carefully as a plan to improve the accessibility of image insertion if that would be helpful).  </s>
