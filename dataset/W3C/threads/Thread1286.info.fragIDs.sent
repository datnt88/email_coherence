<s> jra Sure.  </s>
<s> Labels are just a way of distinguishing one revision from another using an identifier that has some meaning to the user making the distinction.  </s>
<s> So in your example, I find lots of meaning in document revisions labeled as "last call" even though there is no relationship between them(manifest as links or references) that needs to be captured as a consistent set in a baseline.  </s>
<s> The label just helps identify which version of the document is in the last call state.  </s>
<s> Its just easier than saying "go look at revision 1AB2795" or some other equally meaningful server generated id.  </s>
<s> This seems pretty useful, and its pretty simple.  </s>
<s> Are you thinking that label support implies baseline support, or that there is even a relationship between them?  </s>
<s> Baselines have nothing to do with labels.  </s>
<s> They are not related in the protocol.  </s>
<s> Labels are just added and removed from revisions.  </s>
<s> The only requirement is that the same label can't be on more than one revision of the same versioned resource at the same time.  </s>

<s> In particular, documents and links to documents are designed to be largely independent of the content of that particular document, so that documents *can* be changed independently.  </s>
<s> (Maintaining a web of tightly interdependent documents is *very* hard, and labels only begin to address the complexities that are introduced ... you probably need activities and merge support before you even begin to get it under control).  </s>

<s> Perhaps it is more useful to come at it like this: - Is it legitimate for someone to use whatever property is identified for label as a property on a core-only system, so that if the system were upgraded or the data was transported to a system with advanced versioning support, everything would work consistently?  </s>
<s> The protocol says that any server that supports versioning MUST reject an attempt to PROPPATCH any property (core or advanced) that is defined as "protected" by the protocol.  </s>
<s> This provides an error check to make sure a naive client doesn't create a property that a versioning aware client could misinterpret as having the protocol defined live behavior.  </s>
<s> Cheers, Geoff  </s>
