<s> I notice that Amaya saves a local copy of my work sometimes when it crashes.  </s>
<s> But sometimes, the nature of the crash doesn't seem to give Amaya the chance; for example, sometimes it hangs (i.e. goes into an infinite loop) rather than crashing.  </s>
<s> How about having it do that local auto-save every 10 seconds or so, crash or no crash?  </s>
<s> That way, even if it goes into an infinite loop and I have to kill it without giving it a chance to save, I won't lose my work.  </s>

<s> Writing the document each 10 seconds is not a guaranty against infinite loops because a large part of the code is also used during the saving.  </s>
<s> The best would be to prevent infinite loops.  </s>
<s> Could you explain what you're doing when Amaya went in an infinite loop.  </s>
<s> Irene.  </s>
<s> What about writing the internal format of the document every so often?  </s>
<s> WOuld that significantly reduce the amout of code called, or just require a whole lot more to be written?  </s>
<s> Also I think every 10 seconds is probably a bit excessive.  </s>
<s> But ifit had an autosave periodically that would be helpful.  </s>
<s> I assume that the power turning off, which my laptop sometimes does to me, is not going to be caught by the normal crash-recovery.  </s>

<s> The main reasons that could generate an infinite loops is a cycle in the structure chaining.  </s>
<s> If the cycling code doesn't call from time to time the event handler (which is very often the case), the program never goes out the infinite loop and cannot be stopped except by a kill.  </s>
<s> The infinite loop is the more terrific problem in a program.  </s>
<s> Irene.  </s>
<s> No, but it does provide a guarantee that Amaya will lose at most 10 seconds of my work.  </s>
<s> If Amaya is going to go into an infinite loop when I try to save, I want to know that before I've entrusted it with, say, a half-hour of work.  </s>

<s> I was trying to change: li 9th: a href="http://www.w3.org/XML/Group/2000/02/xml-schema-ftf.html" 3-4 Feb 2000 in Berkeley, /a li a href="2000/02/xml-schema-ftf-2000-02-minutes" minutes /a /li to: li 9th: a href="http://www.w3.org/XML/Group/2000/02/xml-schema-ftf.html" 3-4 Feb 2000 in Berkeley, /a a href="2000/02/xml-schema-ftf-2000-02-minutes" minutes /a by selecting the a minutes /a , cutting it, and pasting it after "Berkeley, ".  </s>
<s> One surprise: when I cut a minutes /a , the enclosing li and ul go away.  </s>
<s> That seems odd... Amaya doesn't prevent me from creating a ul with a li with nothing inside, so I don't know why it gets rid of ul and li just because I cut the contents of the li.  </s>
<s> Then when I paste after "Berkeley, ", they come back!  </s>
<s> So the ul and li seemed to go in the cut buffer!  </s>
<s> Strange!  </s>
<s> So I went into the show-source view, selected a minutes /a , and then hit down arrow in the structures window.  </s>
<s> The normal view went nutso, scrolling and redisplaying, and finally locking into (what appears to be) an infinite loop.  </s>
<s> Dan Connolly, W3C http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/  </s>
<s> Dan, The simplest way to achieve the result you expect is to put the caret at the beginning of "minutes" and press the BackSpace key.  </s>
<s> One single keystroke and you are done!  </s>
<s> Obviously Amaya should also allow you to do it the way you tried, without looping indefinitely.  </s>
<s> It should not either delete more than what you selected.  </s>
<s> I am sure Irene will look into this quickly.  </s>

<s> For lack of automatic saving, we can provide the possibility to make a temporary save of the file, at the user request.  </s>
<s> This will be particularly useful when you want to work on a remote file.  </s>
<s> The file would be saved in the local temporary space of the user and would be removed when the file would be normally unloaded, after a save or not.  </s>
<s> After a crash Amaya would get: - the saved version (as it works today) - if there is no saved version, the last saved temporary version - in other case the file located at the given URI.  </s>
