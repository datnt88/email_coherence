The popular browsers do not read as yet. 
If they did, this would be a fine solution for some/many, but it isn't here yet. 
Browsers that read to a user are not typically (if any) user-friendly to ordinary users. 
And browsers which work with standard sound cards don't seem to be commonly available even in the nearby cities. 
Perhaps I've looked in the wrong places. 
Anne, Have you (on anyone else on this list) tried these "ReadPlease" products? 
I think they are made by the "textHELP" people. 
Relatively inexpensive ($50) and works with IE, Netscape, Opera. 
My apologies for mistakenly addressing a letter from Jonathan to you. 
this is an excellent solution and one that I think has been propposed. 
there is also simply talker with three modules in one package that talks for cheap too. 
unfortunately but not for this angle, the read please products are not quite accessable to the blind as they require mouse action to make them work. 
However, they will fill the bill for many other situations.

Anne, I'm not sure what you mean by this: * And browsers which work with standard sound cards don't seem to be commonly available even in the nearby cities. 
Perhaps I've looked in the wrong places. 
The widely-distributed browsers such as Netscape and IE don't work directly with sound cards but rely on the operating system (and assistive technology such as screen readers) doing so. 
What kind of problems do you have with the sound?
