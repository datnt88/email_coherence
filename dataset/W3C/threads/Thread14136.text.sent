ISSUE - 7: An AC Member asked that we remove the priority 2 requirement for redundant text links for client-side image maps which is found in Checkpoint 1.2 They felt that client side image maps are handled by text browsers and assistive technologies today. 
They suggested that 1.2 should say to provide redundant links for server-side maps, when server-side maps are required. 
They also suggested we refer to Checkpoint 9.1 in checkpoint 1.2. 
PROPOSED RESOLUTION: In examining this item, it was found that there are user agents for all platforms that will process client side image maps. 
Thus the second list of links is not necessary to provide access. 
In fact, it can be confusing on these browsers since it lists all of the links twice. 
However, it is still a usability problem for those who prefer browsers that do not expose client side links very well. 
The proposal is therefore to set the priority to 3 for client side image maps because of the interference problem and the fact that access is available through multiple browsers (Lynx, Opera, Pwwebspeak, HomePage Reader, etc.) The priority would remain 1 for client side image maps. 
SPECIFIC WORDING: Same as Original Wording except priority for client side is set to 3. (It was 2.) 1.2 Provide redundant text links for each active region of an image map. 
[Priority 1 - if server-side image maps are used], [Priority 3 - if client-side image maps are used.] 
Redundant text links for client-side image maps are only required until user agents render text equivalents for the map links. 
In the last line of the proposed resolution it says client-side where server-side is clearly meant.

W3C Web Accessibility Initiative http://www.w3.org/WAI MIT/LCS - 545 Technology sq., Cambridge MA, 02139, USA Hi Charles, Take a look again. 
It is correct as written. 
It will always be needed for server side. 
But only is needed on CLIENT SIDE until the user agents render it. 
Then it drops off the map for client side (but stays P1 for server) Does it make sense now on re-reading?
