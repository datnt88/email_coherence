--wendy yes, but that title could apply to all of the guidelines and be very confusing. 
We decided yesterday that we need some sort of "modifier" to set us apart from the UA and AU guidelines. 
--wendy Sigh. 
Well then, be specific and reflect what the document is "HTML and CSS Authoring Guidelines". 
Would amazon.com 
be considered "content"? 
Would the designers there say "Hey! 
The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines are meant for me!" yes, but that title could apply to all of the guidelines and be very confusing.

"Web content" appears to express most accurately the essence of what the guidelines are intended to address; thus my vote at this stage would be for "W3C web content accessibility guidelines". 

The guidelines are not specific to HTML or CSS, although the examples associated with some of the checkpoints are. 
But it's also admitted that sites that make heavy use of DHTML are not adequately covered by the guidelines. 
When this was raised before, I was told that DHTML is not a W3C recommendation and thus ignored. 
How can you say the guidelines are not specific to HTML? 
All throughout the guidelines are specific HTML/CSS items. 
The whole set of guidelines is presented with heavy HTML influence with names such as "pages", "elements", "tables", etc. 
A major problem with the guidelines is that it assumes HTML as a static entity of pages, linked together. 
A set of guidelines, such as Trace's, Microsoft's or IBM's, *then* applied as techniques to HTML/CSS/DHTML would be much more useful. 
Such expressions as "element", "table", etc., are generic terms and are not specific to HTML. 
The term "element" for example connotes an SGML concept. 
Likewise, a table or a link can be constructed in XML or SGML, as can any other document component mentioned in the guidelines. 
XSL can be used in place of CSS in relation to any guideline or checkpoint that mentions style sheets. 
I would also dispute the proposition that the guidelines assume that the web consists of static documents. 
Rather, what they assert is that until the technology evolves further, scripts executed by client software are and will remain inaccessible. 
Accessible scripting at the client level requires three components: (1) a scripting language which the user agent can interpret; (2) a mechanism by which changes caused by the script are reflected in the user interface, including effective communication with any non-visual interfaces that are being used; (3) appropriate handling of such changes by non-visual interfaces so that the user can understand and work with the dynamic content. 
On the other hand, scripts executed by the server and which provide appropriate HTML to the client are appropriate and accessible using today's user agents and adaptive technologies. 
Thus it is necessary to recognise that, in order to make web content accessible, there must be a static version of it made available in addition to, or in place of, any version that relies on user agents to execute scripts. 

Thus it is necessary to recognise that, in order to make web content accessible, there must be a static version of it made available in addition to, or in place of, any version that relies on user agents to execute scripts. 
Let me see if I get this right - any page which employs scripting, or does dynamic effects, with or without scripting, is considered inaccessible unless a static version is also available? 
My goal in making comments to this list is to try to improve the relevance the guidelines have to the type of HTML design I'm working with. 
I look at http://www.investor.msn.com and http://www.msnbc.com and ask "How can the guidelines help here?" and am at a loss - scripting isn't covered (provide static versions), dynamic HTML (not W3C) isn't covered, ActiveX objects (not W3C) aren't covered. 
Yet - the guidelines are supposed to be for all "web content" and not specific to HTML. 
Does that mean that HTML contained in product documentation and user interfaces (such as many Microsoft products) are not covered?

CMN:: Absolutely correct as far as I can see. 
Of course there are a number of ways to make the content accessible, the simplest of which is often to provide a server-side implentation of client-side scripting.

CMN:: No, it simply means that at the present time there are many Microsoft products (as well as many parts of the web which are not Microsoft products) which are not accessible. 
The things you mention are covered in the guidelines. 
From the most recent Working Draft: A.2 Provide descriptions for all important graphics, scripts or applets if they are not fully described through alternative text or in the document's content. 
A.9 Ensure that pages using newer technologies will transform gracefully into an accessible form if the technology is not supported or is turned off. 
A.13 Use interim accessibility solutions so that assistive technology or older browsers will operate correctly. 
Charles McCathieNevile Title candidate: W3C Web Accessibility Guidelines With all due respect for the sense of the meeting in the telecon, this to me is the best suggestion yet. 
Let me try to address the concerns: "We felt we needed a word to distinguish the scope of this document from the scopes of its companions." 
There are two reasons why we don't need to do that. 
One is how people will understand the simpler phrase, and the other is the respective audiences of the three guidelines documents. 
In terms of perceptions, if you say "web accessibility guidelines" then the person in the street will hear this as pertaining to what we would technically call the content of the web, even if we don't say so. 
In other words, "content" is the default and may be suppressed without loss of meaning. 
And in titles, less is more. 
In terms of audience, we have to realize that the three volumes are not really peers. 
There is an anchor document, and it is this one. 
Everyone should understand the content of this volume, including the audiences targeted by the user agent guidelines and the authoring tool guidelines. 
The other two volumes serve to amplify the guidelines as required by two audiences of specialists. 
This volume addresses the most general questions of interest to the most general audience. 
The title should answer the question "why read this volume?" 
One doesn't need in the title of this volume to distinguish it from the others because there is no audience that should read the others and not this one. 
In the other two volumes, we need to distinguish the topic from the general topic. 
It is not necessary for this volume to be an all-embracing compendium for it to have the simple "W3C Web Accessibility Guidelines" title. 
It is enough that it is the basic volume that all should read. 
I agree with Al's suggestion. 
This is the "topic" that brought us here and it's the topic that everyone (regardless of the technology area) that everyone identifies with. 
- Mike "content" is I agree with Al Gilman's reasoning behind the choice of "W3C Web Accessibility Guideline".

As a footnote to Charles McCathie-Nevile's excellent treatment of this topic, in addition to providing a generic HTML version of the interactive application which relies on server-side scripts, it has been suggested that the interactive applications themselves be made directly accessible in accordance with the user interface design considerations developed in the User Agent guidelines. 
Unfortunately, as detailed discussion (amounting to almost two teleconferences, as I recall) demonstrated, there is little concrete guidance that can be given in this respect until the scripting languages, the DOM and user interface technologies have been sufficiently developed to allow accessible scripts to be created easily. 
Further details can be found in the minutes of GL teleconferences under the general heading of "dynamic HTML". 
In short I think this topic has received exhaustive coverage, so far as circumstances permit, in the context of the guidelines. 
The techniques document should be expanded to cover it in greater detail as the technology evolves over the next several years, and helpful insight may also be gleaned, as already mentioned, from the user agent guidelines. 
I agree with Al too. 
Content is implied and this guideline is more a foundation than the others. 
I too like W3C Web Accessibility Guidelines. 
Content and site seem clunky. 
The acronym will be very useful: WAG "Wag the Web" has a good ring to it. 
Chuck Behalf Of Daniel Dardailler I agree with Al too. 
Content is implied and this guideline is more a foundation than the others. 
I still find "W3C Web Accessibility Guidelines" to be problematic, because then there is no convenient title by which to refer to all three sets of of guidelines under a single heading, as it were. 

As a footnote to Charles McCathie-Nevile's excellent treatment of this topic, in addition to providing a generic HTML version of the interactive application which relies on server-side scripts, server-side scripts are a totally different topic. 
Dynamic HTML and DOM allow for *client* side scripts. 
That's the whole purpose of Dynamic HTML! Providing "generic HTML" may not be an option and be rejected out of hand by many web developers. 
Guidelines on producing accessible, dynamic content would be useful. 
Direct accessibility, not a lowest common denominator approach. 
Whoops! 
Jason is correct. 
I neglected to consider this. 
Sorry, I haven't followed this thread well enough to remember what's been offered. 
(This is why I perfer discussion forums -- easier to organize threads). 
I assume that "W3C Web Markup Accessibility Guidelines" is too difficult for the average user to understand...and somewhere down the line we'll figure out a diffierent mechanism for page creation.
