Hi, I am discovering Amaya software ... When i do a copy from another software, a text editor by example with 3 lines of text and then a past in Amaya, i loose the line break and get only one line of text. 
In other words, is there a feature (like in Netscape Composer) when you do a paste to get the br tag at the end of each line you copy ? 
Thanks for your answer Patrick GIRARD This was already discussed and today we apply the rule of HTML parsers: - If you paste within a paragraph line breaks are ignored, - but if you paste within a preformatted, Amaya keeps line breaks. 
It's exactly the same a HTML source file is parsed. 
I also had a similar problem with posting a message using a form. 
The message I was typing in ran out of the form box, and when I pressed "enter" the line jumped to the top of the page (over the top of other text/images). 
How "browser capable" is Amaya designed to be?
