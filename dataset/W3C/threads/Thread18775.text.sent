In last weeks HTML working group meeting, I was asked about the WAI's interest in the possibility of HTML elements for marking up abbreviations and acronyms. 
I seem to remember that we briefly discussed this at the WAI meeting recently in Sophia, but can't find the details in the minutes other than: "Acronym element was accepted by HTML group so that proper pronounciation can be done". 
The ACRONYM element would be used together with the TITLE attribute to specify the expanded name. 
TITLE has been added to most HTML elements for the next version of HTML. 
On graphical browsers the idea is that it would be used for tool tips also known as baloon help which pop-up as the mouse pointer is held over the associated element. 
This is a technique commonly used for user interfaces. 
The HTML working group was unable to reach a concensus on the need for a specific element for abbreviations. 
Thomas Reardon (Microsoft) argued that there was no need since user agents would have access to dictionaries covering nearly all abbreviations. 
These dictionaries could in principle be used to identify the abbreviations without the need for explicit markup. 
What do members of this group think?

Subject: Acronyms and Abbreviations? 
"Acronym element was accepted by HTML group so that proper pronounciation can be done". 
The ACRONYM element would be used together with the TITLE attribute to specify the expanded name. 
First, that misses the requirement. 
The pronunciation of NCIL is "nickel." 
That is not a TITLE. 
Acronyms need a more complex lexicographical record than is afforded by one TITLE attribute.

What do members of this group think? 
Both "acronym" and "abbreviation" are too narrow to capture the true requirement. 
There is a general requirement to be able to annotate words with lexicographical expansions. 
These should be distinguished from navigation tags as a different class of navigand. 
The requirement that I have come across repeately in working across engineering sub-domains is the ability for the page author to make explicit to the dictionary service at the client side which of various extant meanings a given lexical graph is to mean. 
Consider it a jargon requirment. 
It means, "In this place, this term must be interpreted in accordance with [value or reference to] definition." 
This would provide the capability to link to preferred pronunciations of acronyms, etc. 
In plain text there are homographs. 
The requirement is to be able to override the default dictionary, not just to supplement it. 
Al Gilman The suggestion is that TITLE would be used for the full name, e.g. MIT becomes "Massachussetts Institute of Technology". 
For pronunciation I have been arguing for a new attribute, for encoding phonemic and prosodic info. 
This is still at an early stage of discussion though. 
The people I have been talking to don't consider acronym and abbreviation as navigation elements. 
Rather they are there for people to find the expanded form, and as an aid to user agents to speak the phrase reasonably. 
TITLE as used for tool tips or balloon help is intended in a rough sense to be used in this way. 
That is as a means for people to clarify the intended purpose/meaning.
