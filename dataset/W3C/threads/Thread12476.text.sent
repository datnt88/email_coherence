I have made a lot of mess on this version! 
I read the text very carefully - what might look like editorial comments are, in many cases, logic corrections, IMHO. 
Specifications need to be very precise and the language needs to be very positive and active - so I have made that sort of change too. 
Liddy Liddy, Thanks for the in-depth edits at: Here is my reaction to your comments (I will not note where I am in agreement): 1.2 Role of authoring tools in Web accessibility -While "Web Resources" makes sense the "Web Content" guidelines do still apply to those services, etc. 1.3 How this document is organized -I'm confused about the meaning of the first comment "I think the integration you want..." 1.5 Conformance -Would modify to "An example of an ATAG-friendly tool is ONE THAT converts" Checkpoint 1.4: - Maybe: "in a way that differs from the most likely browser rendering of the content." 
Checkpoint 1.5: - Maybe two parts. 
- (1) There must be some means to navigate the content via the document structure (i.e. traversing the markup hierarchy). 
- (2) That means must conform to Checkpoint 1.1. 
Checkpoint 1.6: -Update reference to Guideline 7. GUIDELINE 2 INTRO TEXT: -It worries me a bit too - I want to say something foundational though. 
Checkpoint 2.1: - For Success Criteria 1., "accessible" should not be there. 
- Why "relevant" over "appropriate"? 
Relevant is probably harder to define. 
GUIDELINE 3: INTRO TEXT: -"ideosyncratically" seems awkward here. 
Checkpoints 3.1/3.2/3.3/3.4: - I am still looking for feedback on my discussion about collapsing these into a new, more general checkpoint (see - Not sure about "implore" in 3.4. 
- Do you have a definition for "Reasonable Author" and "Moderately Expert"? 
Checkpoint 4.2 -why the bold??? Answer: TYPO-should be removed. 
Checkpoint 4.3 -*** why the ???? Answer: Because I'm not sure if this is a success criterion or just nice. 
Checkpoint 4.4 ***why is 'all' not bold??? Answer: TYPO-should be removed.

Jan I agree with most of these but... where we are referring to the WCAG we need to say content but I still think we need to move into working more openly and explicitly on all content - the word content does not nec. 
achieve this, unfortunately. 
I think that relevant means that there is something that relates to it whereas appropriate means if you think you want to use it - or something... yes - I was struggling to find a word that would do - I was thinking of unpredictably - perhaps... - or not anticipated beg?? invite is a bit gentle but might be OK Liddy Liddy, Agreed - let's talk about this on the next call. 
Your full comment was: "I think the integration you want is achieved by having this introduction. 
When people are trying to implement the guidelines, I think it helps a lot if they can work on bits - so I am not sure there is the problem you have suggested." 
...I'm just not sure to what it refers. 
"Relevant" seems fuzzier to me than "appropriate". 
ex. "SVG is appropriate for encoding blueprints" vs. "SVG is relevant for encoding blueprints"? 
What about: "While ensuring the accessibility of automated output provides a solid foundation for accessible content, without proper supports authors, will likely act in ways that undermine these measures." 
"Request"?

good idea not important !!! we could also talk about this. 
I think that relevant means it deals with the topic while appropriate means that it deals with the topic and i think it should be used here...or something ... yes, but support, authors may act in ways that... being picky!! yes - good! 
Hi, Liddy. 
Great comments. 
Thanks for your input. 
I think that most of my responses are nitpicky, with one or two exceptions. 
First off, I agree that items like passive voice, the subjunctive, and overly complex phrases need to be modified to the extent they can without changing meaning. 
This will have to happen, in fact, in order to make the documents more easily translatable. 
Additionally, the voice of sections like success criteria must be the same. 
Some of them are simple declarative statements, some of them are simple imperative statements, and a few appeared to consist of more prose than is necessary. 
W3C style issue: Recommendation and Note are always capitalized when in reference to W3C documents. 
Comment on "reasonable, moderately expert": I think the success criteria where this term has been added should be reconciled with the checkpoint priorities section, which reads: "Note: The choice of priority level for each checkpoint is based on the assumption that the author is a competent, but not necessarily expert, user of the authoring tool, and that the author has little or no knowledge of accessibility. 
For example, the author is not expected to have read all of the documentation, but is expected to know how to turn to the documentation for assistance." 
Comment on "Web content": Since we have no definition of such, perhaps your concerns can be included in the addition of a definition? 
(Side note: We also don't have a definition for "author". 
I think that will have to be resolved quickly.) Intro 1.6 Accessible authoring practices "...the result is unlikely to be high-level ATAG conformance." 
I propose: "...the result is unlikely to be a high level of ATAG conformance." 
Checkpoint 1.6: A reference to "Guideline 7" remains in the rationale. 
2.1: I think the success criteria here need to be reworked (not relative to Liddy's additions), since they appear to be success criteria about W3C specs, not success criteria for the author. 
2.4: "it would be absurd..." is, while accurate, perhaps not what is needed here. 
I would recommend: "Once _an_ author has made the effort to add accessible content, either manually or with the aid of the authoring tool, _he or she does not wish to_ discard that content when converting..." Guideline 3, first sentence: Liddy's suggestion: "While ensuring the accessibility of automated output provides a solid foundation for accessible content, authors often act ideosyncratically." 
My attempt: "While ensuring the accessibility of automated output provides a solid foundation for accessible content, authors often can introduce accessibility issues on their own." 
3.2: "Content that has been created in association with its presentation may be difficult to separate from its presentation in order for it to be presented in an accessible way." 
I would strike "from its presentation". 
3.4: I would change success criterion 1 from: The authoring tool's prompts implore the author to provide equivalent alternatives for each instance of non-text content. 
to: The authoring tool's prompts _guide_ the author to provide equivalent..." 3.5: Success criteria 1 should read "the tool prompts the author..." 3.11: Success criteria 1: "The documentation contains sample or suggested workflows which, if followed, are likely to increase the chance of higher levels of WCAG conformance than otherwise." 
Full stop after "WCAG conformance" and strike "than otherwise." 
m re Matt's comments... 
I think I agree with these too - except for Guideline 3, first sentence: Liddy's suggestion: "While ensuring the accessibility of automated output provides a solid foundation for accessible content, authors often act ideosyncratically." 
My attempt: "While ensuring the accessibility of automated output provides a solid foundation for accessible content, authors often can introduce accessibility issues on their own." 
delete 'on their own' I think, and maybe have 're-introduce'??? Liddy. 
Ack. 
s/on their own/of their own/ better?
