<s> There is room for a good open source project that incorporates betsy and friends into an open and extensible "personalized proxy" framework.  </s>
<s> Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes.  </s>
<s> I've been fiddling with ways of making Betsie work as a client-side solution but have not managed to come up with anything even remotely satisfactory yet.  </s>
<s> Whether or not the WAI take it on, I'm certainly extremely keen to look at open, extensible solutions of this sort, and I'd love to know more about Raman's personal perl proxy too.  </s>
<s> In terms of client-side proxy filtering, I've been looking at the following five-piece plan:  </s>
<s> 1 - A (accessible) user interface component handling issues like user  </s>
<s> settings and preferences, turning the filter on and off, etc. 2 - A kind of mini-server component, being the proxy itself into which filters like Betsie (or whatever) 'plug in', in addition to having potential support for languages other than Perl if people insist on writing filters in  </s>
<s> them (which they inevitably will).  </s>
<s> 3 - Betsie and/or other filters.  </s>
<s> 4 - Perl and/or the other scripting languages.  </s>
<s> 5 - An intelligent installation script that 'knows' as much as possible about as many browsers as possible and makes it as easy as possible for users to get everything set up, including the relevant proxy settings and so forth.  </s>
<s> The filters themselves are not a problem, or rather, are an ongoing problem around which this is merely a utilitarian wrapper.  </s>
<s> It strikes me that Perl is the ideal default scripting language for all of this, but then of course I think that; meanwhile, it would be highly foolish not to include support for arbitrary additional scripting languages.  </s>
<s> In terms of the mini-server proxy component itself, I suspect that Raman is several light years ahead of me - I've been working on one in Perl myself but it doesn't work (yet) and I'd be delighted to abandon it in favour of something that did.  </s>
<s> As for the architecture of the proxy, I simply don't have the knowledge to say whether or not it should be a complete HTTP 1.1 implementation (in which case the 'mini' aspect of things seems a misnomer), whether it would be ok to go for an absolutely minimal subset thereof, or something somewhere in between; this is one of the main things hampering me in finishing my own proxy bit, quite apart from the 'doesn't work yet' issue.  </s>
<s> Once those things are all in place, though, the UI and the installation script(s) ought to virtually write themselves, although I suspect that some language other than Perl might be required for the latter.  </s>
<s> Does any of this make sense?  </s>
<s> Cheers etc., Wayne Myers Interactive Software Engineer BBC Digital Media 0181-752-6116  </s>
<s> My experience (working with other W3C groups, like Ecommerce) is that there isn't a portable solution for client-side proxy, and you have to adapt your setting and filter to IE, to Netscape, to Lynx, etc.  </s>
<s> For Lynx, for instance, there's a way to compile it (so not supported in every binaries) so that it recognizes some URI schema (say xhttp://) as special and runs a filter thru them.  </s>
<s> See lynx documentation.  </s>
<s> For Emacs/W3, you need to write you own piece of elisp.  </s>
<s> For Netscape, there's a panel (Automatic Proxy Configuration) that let's you play with client side script.  </s>
<s> (see etc. It's too bad that there isn't a simple client side CGI interface, fired thru some .mailcap  </s>
<s> file, like for helpers, that would let anyone install a filter on the client side.  </s>
<s> Incidentally, this is the argument for relational programming or investing in the overhead of a Problem Solving Environment framework.  </s>
<s> In the abstract you define once the outcomes in terms of the relationship between UI behavior and the document content.  </s>
<s> Then the PSE generates for you a solution that delivers these outcomes built in the native resource vocabularies of the different execution environments.  </s>
<s> Al  </s>
<s> Does any of this make any sense?  </s>
<s> Well, yes and no.  </s>
<s> The desire to combine adaptive smarts contributed by diverse authors is very real.  </s>
<s> Encapsulating each contribution as an HTML filter and then applying them somehow via a pre-processor outside the browser runs into functional limitations if each filter doesn't do a full compile on the document, and composing filters from different authors runs into compatibility problems if they are not carefully designed against a shared logical model of the generic document.  </s>
<s> A "more pain, more gain" alternative is to add adaptive smarts in the middle end of a genuine compile process.  </s>
<s> Let a shared first pass [the browser?]  </s>
<s> build a DOM image of the received document, transform this data structure to adaptive advantage, and then return it as a DOM image to the output phase of the browser and possibly alternate rendering engines outside the browser for delivery to I/O devices.  </s>
<s> [In the WAI-PF working group, we have provisionally persuaded Dave Pawson to think in these terms for Braille.]  </s>
<s> There is a temptation in a filterlet to take short cuts, do simple transforms that do not get to the true semantic structure of the document.  </s>
<s> Defining the adaptive transforms in a way that they do not interfere with one another takes some serious software engineering.  </s>
<s> Domain abstraction is one way to do this engineering.  </s>
<s> The methods proper to each domain use abstract references to methods in other domains so that any adaptive shift in the other domain can take effect concurrently with the self-domain method.  </s>
<s> Sorry if this is babble.  </s>
<s> I suspect that a working medium that supports multiple heredity well may be needed if we want adequate mix and match capability over our experimental techniques.  </s>
<s> Java may not be OO enough.  </s>
<s> In practical terms, if we write transforms against the DOM in Java, then they can be applied using existing scaffolding in both client and server contexts, at least for enough people so that we can do distributed user testing.  </s>
<s> The MAVIS people are writing their (e.g. math to Braille) transforms in logic language.  </s>
<s> They get to deal with math so the transforms that they do exhibit a highly logical structure.  </s>
<s> But (as an unreconstructed math fan) I am suspicious that this approach would be beneficial for adaptive transformers, too.  </s>

<s> There is room for a good open source project that incorporates betsy and friends into an open and extensible "personalized proxy" framework.  </s>
<s> In the note quoted below, I argued that fluent extension will require some serious coding discipline.  </s>
<s> I want to make clear that I don't think this should be expected at the outset.  </s>
<s> Or at least, let me introduce a process model we have been kicking around a bit in one of the supercomputer research networks http://www.npaci.edu/ .  </s>
<s> This starts with the idea that if you have an idea for a technique, implement it in whatever programming medium you are comfortable in.  </s>
<s> Try it.  </s>
<s> See if you like it.  </s>
<s> If a second application then picks it up and likes it in their context, too, it becomes a candidate for re-engineering and folding into the mix/match resource library.  </s>
<s> It is understood that at this point there needs to be a fresh and deeper analysis of what this code does and why that is a good idea; along with how it does it and how it could be written to fit better into the emerging pattern of plug and play components.  </s>
<s> The current draft concept of our working medium when we get to the second-customer-likes-it stage is "graph transforms defined against the DOM."  </s>
<s> This is something that has been suggested by the DOM group as a medium of expression they would find friendly for information coming from the WAI concerning what we want the DOM to be able to support.  </s>
<s> It is not clear whether we in this group will ever get to write the second-generation code or not.  </s>
<s> But I want people cutting code here to understand the logical progression from exemplars here which demonstrate assistive effect for techniques into universal design of the shared DOM reference model back to a mix of mass market and niche market code to deliver all the morphs to all the users.  </s>
<s> Al  </s>
<s> enough.  </s>
<s> There is room for a good open source project that incorporates betsy and friends into an open and extensible "personalized proxy" framework.  </s>
<s> I think we should first make prototypes of filtering tools that run on a publically available server rather than the user's machines.  </s>
<s> This first of all gets around the wide variety of personal proxies that Daniel pointed out.  </s>
<s> Also, even if we didn't have that problem, I think it will be much easier to get feedback from a wide range of people if users just have to type a url into a form instead of configuring their browsers.  </s>
<s> Ultimately, it will be more efficient to have the proxies run on the users machines, but I suggest we not worry about that now.  </s>
<s> As far as how to do it.  </s>
<s> I agree that like Al said just piping filters one after the other may be a problem.  </s>
<s> However, it has the big advantage that we can use the various things people have written in java, C++, perl etc.  </s>
<s> We want to re-use as much as possible As far as implementing what Al mentioned about shared first pass into a DOM.  </s>
<s> For Perl fans, there are modules available from CPAN that will create a document tree.  </s>
<s> I've just started to look at this.  </s>
<s> The modules are available from CPAN, Once you're there, see especially HTML-Parser-2.22.readme  </s>
<s> HTML-Tree-0.51.readme Depending on how forgiving these are for bad HTML, it may be useful to preprocess with Dave Raggett's Tidy Even if Perl fans do use this DOM, I'd urge us to figure out how to combine it with other DOM implementations, including non-Perl stuff also, e.g. WAG.  </s>
<s> This implies putting them in a pipeline like Al mentioned.  </s>
<s> You'd probably want to pass hints though.  </s>
<s> For example, one filter may want to tell the following ones "I've already made the font larger".  </s>
<s> One way to do this would be to pass hints and parameters in Meta Tags within the HTML itself.  </s>
<s> That way it wouldn't interfere with forms for example.  </s>
