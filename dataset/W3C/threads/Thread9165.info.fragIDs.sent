<s> My first cut at a Working Draft for the Test Cases is available at: [1] http://www.w3.org/2001/08/rdf-test/ Below are some comments/suggestions (about [1] from DanC and EricM) that have not been factored into the WD. Art DanC: I'd like to see an enumeration of the test cases, or at least a count of them.  </s>
<s> And/or: show the results of running one or two known implementations thru the tests: how many pass/fail/etc?  </s>
<s> Another nifty thing would be a two-column list to correlate test cases with issue.  </s>
<s> Or just: the number of issues that are now clarified by test cases.  </s>
<s> [more for the WG to discuss...] I'd like the n-triples spec to be incorporated wholly in this document.  </s>
<s> EricM: It also seems like one of the basic things missing are RDF descriptions of these examples and a more formal association to their corresponding open issues.  </s>
<s> Perhaps this is something for the Primer instead, but it should be available somewhere.  </s>
<s> I have a test harness set up to do this for a number of recent implementations.  </s>
<s> It outputs in the format for Dave Beckett's RDF Parser Tests.  </s>
<s> Do folks feel this is useful?  </s>
<s> What would be the best way to present this data?  </s>
<s> While trying to set this up, I find that some of the tests are 401 Forbidden.  </s>
<s> Also, misspellings like: tests/rdfcore/rdfms-empty-property-lements/ should be deleted.  </s>

<s> Art I have wondered whether some test cases which are not either bad RDF or RDF &amp; N-triple may be useful.  </s>
<s> A particular test is given two RDF/XML files simply to say if they are equal or not.  </s>
<s> This is useful for tests concerning things that somehow lie outside the scope of n-triple, e.g. xml:lang, embedded RDF, xml literals.  </s>
<s> As an example involving the first two, consider the following two files contain the same RDF model.  </s>
<s> *****file 1 *****file 2 We would also need this if we resolve the XML base issue to have any support at all for xml base.  </s>
<s> (Personally I find convincing the arguments for supporting it at least within an embedding XML document; where the embedding document supports XML base).  </s>
<s> I am considering creating rdf:parseType = "Literal" test cases in this fashion.  </s>
<s> I hope that, if I do, you would be open to supporting those.  </s>
