I got a long spam this morning that appeared to have been Resent-From this group! 
It was addressed to subscriber@internet.com. 
I wonder if anyone there knows how this happens and what could be done to retaliate against the folks who presume to do this sort of thing? 
Love. 
ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE William, Don't reply to the spam message. 
That only generates much more traffic. 
In many cases, the addresses they give are false ones, so you just waste your time for nothing. 
Also, don't go to their web site as it will only give them your email address. 
We are currently working on a filtering solution to avoid this kind of problems in the near future. 
In the meantime, each time we get a spam mail, I add it to a banned email list. 
Sorry for the inconvenients, -Jose Kahan, on behalf of the W3C sysadmin team In our previous episode, William Loughborough said: I'd love to hear the answer to that! 
My answer was to reply with "RE: unsubscribe" in the subject.
