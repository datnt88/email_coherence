<s> Regarding "good policy", I would encourage people to make fragment identifiers, where possible, refer to 'anchor' style identifiers (i.e., using an extensibility mechanism like the 'id' attribute in XML, 'name' in HTML, and so forth) rather than into the syntax and structure of the format (as XPointer allows, through use of XPath).  </s>
<s> Doing so increases the chance that a fragment identifier could be valid and useful across multiple formats.  </s>

<s> I have some questions about fragment identifiers.  </s>
<s> When the media type is determined by negotiation, how can users specify fragment identifiers in advance?  </s>
<s> I'm happy to see that the TAG is already considering this issue.  </s>
<s> If fragment identifiers are interpreted by clients, why should they be standardized as part of URIs?  </s>
<s> To me, they are not part of URIs or protocols, but they are instructions to clients.  </s>
<s> In other words, why different applications for the same media type have to agree on fragment identifiers?  </s>
<s> Cheers, Makoto  </s>
<s> When the media type is determined by negotiation, any fragment identifier specified in advance should be one that is usable with all of the possible media types that might result.  </s>
<s> Suppose there were a new media type for 'whizzymovie' with two players, but player XYZ thought '#part=1-3' meant the first three seconds, while player ABC thought '#part=1-3' meant the first three minutes.  </s>
<s> I couldn't send you something with a link to and know what it was you would see -- would it be the first 3 minutes or the first 3 hours?  </s>
<s> Suppose I also had a version in the 'oldmovie' media type and offered 'whizzymovie' and 'oldmovie' by content negotiation.  </s>
<s> I couldn't send you a link unless the definition of the fragment identifiers for 'video/whizzymovie' and 'video/oldmovie' agreed.  </s>
<s> So it seems like a good idea to try design fragment identifiers that can be used consistently across different media types.  </s>
<s> It's also hard to do.  </s>
