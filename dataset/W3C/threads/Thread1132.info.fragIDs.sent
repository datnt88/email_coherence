Hello, 
I just stumbled over this one: I have some img-Tags with id-attribute. 
Tidy inserts a name-attribute which is not xhtml-conform. 
My config-file 
looks like this: markup: yes wrap: 120 wrap-script-literals: no wrap-asp: yes break-before-br: yes indent: auto indent-spaces: 2 indent-attributes: no uppercase-tags: no uppercase-attributes: no hide-endtags: no enclose-text: yes quote-marks: no quote-nbsp: yes quote-ampersand: yes fix-backslash: yes clean: no drop-font-tags: yes logical-emphasis: yes input-xml: no assume-xml-procins: no output-xml: yes output-xhtml: yes numeric-entities: yes add-xml-pi: no show-warnings: yes doctype: strict char-encoding: ascii wrap-attributes: yes wrap-jste: yes drop-empty-paras: yes fix-bad-comments: yes word-2000: no tidy-mark: yes add-xml-decl: no join-classes: no join-styles: no merge-divs: no How can I make tidy stop adding the name-attribute? 
Thanks Steffen 
No, see http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/#h-4.10 , img elements may have both a name and id attribute. 
XHTML 1.0 Strict and XHTML 1.1 disallow the name attribute but as such documents are less compatible Tidy adds 
the name attribute. 
It probably does not change the document type decl which is a known problem and maybe it should not add it for these two or with HTML 4.01 Strict three document types but doing so would require to change parts of the doctype code and I did not get around to do that yet. 
You can change the tidylib.c:FixAnchors(...) call to set wantName to 'no' but we don't currently offer a configuration option for this.

Since I am developing for XHTML 1.0 strict this in-validates my pages. 
Since I don't want to compile tidy myself I'd guess I'll have to wait for that option... regards Steffen
