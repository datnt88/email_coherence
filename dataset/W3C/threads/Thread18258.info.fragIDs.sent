<s> (this topic has been distributed among a few recent threads but I'll insert my 2 cents into this branch) As for using MAP to define sets of links... there's a problem...  </s>
<s> What happens if you have a link hierarchy, e.g. a series of headings each of which is a link, and each of which has a list of links underneath (e.g. the Yahoo home page).  </s>
<s> How does map apply?  </s>
<s> If we wrap the whole thing in a single map, we lose the hierarchy and flatten it all into one pile of links Can we wrap the whole thing in a MAP, and then also wrap each indivisual list in a MAP?  </s>
<s> No can do.  </s>
<s> For one thing, it doesn't validate... either by my reading of HTML 4.01 or, more importantly, by the w3c validator.  </s>
<s> And even if it did validate, what would it mean?  </s>
<s> It seems the way to address this is to use DIV's and existing structure (cf.  </s>
<s> Al's remarks at Otherwise we lose the structure.  </s>
<s> Now, that leaves the problem that the semantics, viz that this is "a set of  </s>
<s> links", is not machine readable.  </s>
<s> But even if we had MAP, there would still be plenty of semantics that are not readable.  </s>
<s> For example, if we had a page with lots of sets of links, where's the main navigation bar?  </s>
<s> And there are other semantic units that have nothing to do with links.... e.g. "main section" "news" etc. that we often see.  </s>
<s> So MAP would address only a part of all the semantics that are needed anyway.  </s>
<s> That means we do one of the following, seems to me: 1. waiting for XML  </s>
<s> 2. defining conventions for class names (hey, we accept D links)  </s>
<s> 3. defining conventions for titles (well, I gotta have a third alternative) As you might guess, my vote is for 2, defining conventions for class names.  </s>
<s> I realize this was discussed in WCAG and it didn't fly, but perhaps it's time to reconsider.  </s>
<s> Note that even if we wait for XML, that just postpones deciding on the semantic units.  </s>
<s> So why not figure them out now, stick them in class for the time being, and then re-use them when XML arrives.  </s>

<s> I don't think that that's an option.  </s>
<s> XML is already here.  </s>
<s> We need to do the right thing for XML.  </s>
<s> I think the question is what to do for HTML.  </s>
<s> D-links don't require anything from the user agent.  </s>
<s> But asking user agents to recognize classes that are not defined in the HTML specification is problematic to me.  </s>
<s> It could be done - the UA Guidelines could require that conforming user agents handle some predefined classes in a special way - but I think that the HTML spec is the appropriate place for this type of information.  </s>
<s> Here's a nice HTML trick that works with Lynx: Define links to key parts of a page with the LINK element link rel="contents" href="#contents" title="Go to table of contents |"/ Lynx renders these as links, but they do not show up on most graphical browsers.  </s>
<s> Thus the author can create skip-over links even if the UA doesn't support structured navigation to or past groups of links.  </s>
