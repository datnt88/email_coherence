minor points: the title on this page should be corrected: Also, instead of the heading "Questions and Answers" we should use something more pertinent and specific, like: Web Internationalization Questions and Answers or Web Internationalization Q &amp; A or 
W3C GEO Web Internationalization Q &amp; A 
to help search engines properly categorize the page and to suggest to others linking to the page that they title the link appropriately and similarly. 
I think of the 3, I prefer the last, so the "GEO"starts to carry some weight and be associated with quality information that people can use to search for.

Title repaired. 
Thanks. 
The page heading shouldn't say GEO, since this is a WG thing - although we do mention that GEO members are principally responsible. 
(I'm still hoping that we might get occasional contributions from core and ws folks). 
I too have been wondering about the "Questions &amp; Answers" thing lately. 
I'm very tempted to call this a FAQ list - like everyone else does, and 
like I had to to explain clearly what it was while doing outreach at 
LISA. 
Why don't we rechristen it as "W3C Internationalization FAQ" ? 
Votes or counter proposals, please.

I would be all for it. 
Good idea! 
Regards, Martin. 
I think as a name "W3C Internationalization FAQ" is fine, but it is non-unqiue 
so if anyone googles for that title they get 2780 other pages, and it is hard 
to narrow it down further. 
Almost all web pages about web technology mention W3C, many have FAQs, and a good number mention internationalization... 
Personally, I would stick the GEO in there to make it identifiable and credit 
the group, while making it clear in the text or somewhere that it is open to 
others in (just?) the WG to submit. 
If not GEO, let's make up some other acronym or identifier that is memorable 
and uniquely searchable to make it easy to find. 
Anyone got any fun acronyms? 
TWINQ (pronounced twink!) The Web InternationalizatioN Questions WIN-FAQ Richard's I18n Almanac? 
;-) (I'll work on this later...) tex 
Good point. 
That is of course okay if we are at the top. 
And it should be possible to do that because: - W3C does seem to have quite a bit of Google-Karma - We will have all three words, in that order, in the title,... - We will of course produce more and more content and will be linked from other places So I'm not too worried, but of course if we have a better idea, I don't object. 
Regards, Martin. 
Yes, but we shouldn't presume we will be at the top. 
I wouldn't doubt that it is likely we will be near, but banking on it is 
silly. 
The main w3c pages are near the top, but certainly not all. 
I do a number of searches where pages from other sites dominate. 
The key to making a page have a high rank is links to the page and proper use of keywords that you want searches to find the page with. 
(e.g. bidi, unicode, double-byte, etc.) I am just suggesting we use something that makes the page easy for people to pull up.

I was reading a very interesting web page about how to improve your ranking on google http://www.thesitewizard.com/archive/google.shtml 
It suggested downloading the Google toolbar - which on the face of it looks quite interesting. 
According to the toolbar http://www.w3.org has a page ranking of 10/10. 
thought is pretty good too. 
I was also intrigued by some of the languages available (see the attached picture) - especially given that they seem to use an rfc3066 type label on the download page. 
I wonder what they say for pig-latin, or elmer-fudd. 
Let me know if you have time to find out :)

Actually I was wrong - the /International page scores 9/10 ! 
The GEO Core and WS pages scores 8/10.

the google bar is very handy, in fact it is a little too handy. 
Now I research every random thought I have... But if you want some interesting google fun, go here: it visualizes your web site in relation to other web sites. 
It is very useful for getting a realistic assessment of what your site is really about, as opposed to what you think it is about... tex
