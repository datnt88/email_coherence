<s> The page heading shouldn't say GEO, since this is a WG thing - although we do mention that GEO members are principally responsible.  </s>
<s> (I'm still hoping that we might get occasional contributions from core and ws folks).  </s>
<s> I too have been wondering about the "Questions &amp; Answers" thing lately.  </s>
<s> I'm very tempted to call this a FAQ list - like everyone else does, and  </s>

<s> Why don't we rechristen it as "W3C Internationalization FAQ" ?  </s>

<s> I think as a name "W3C Internationalization FAQ" is fine, but it is non-unqiue  </s>
<s> so if anyone googles for that title they get 2780 other pages, and it is hard  </s>
<s> to narrow it down further.  </s>
<s> Almost all web pages about web technology mention W3C, many have FAQs, and a good number mention internationalization...  </s>
<s> Personally, I would stick the GEO in there to make it identifiable and credit  </s>
<s> the group, while making it clear in the text or somewhere that it is open to  </s>
<s> others in (just?) the WG to submit.  </s>
<s> If not GEO, let's make up some other acronym or identifier that is memorable  </s>
<s> and uniquely searchable to make it easy to find.  </s>

<s> Good point.  </s>
<s> That is of course okay if we are at the top.  </s>
<s> And it should be possible to do that because: - W3C does seem to have quite a bit of Google-Karma - We will have all three words, in that order, in the title,... - We will of course produce more and more content and will be linked from other places So I'm not too worried, but of course if we have a better idea, I don't object.  </s>
<s> Regards, Martin.  </s>
<s> Yes, but we shouldn't presume we will be at the top.  </s>
<s> I wouldn't doubt that it is likely we will be near, but banking on it is  </s>
<s> silly.  </s>
<s> The main w3c pages are near the top, but certainly not all.  </s>
<s> I do a number of searches where pages from other sites dominate.  </s>
<s> The key to making a page have a high rank is links to the page and proper use of keywords that you want searches to find the page with.  </s>
<s> (e.g. bidi, unicode, double-byte, etc.) I am just suggesting we use something that makes the page easy for people to pull up.  </s>

<s> I was reading a very interesting web page about how to improve your ranking on google http://www.thesitewizard.com/archive/google.shtml  </s>
<s> It suggested downloading the Google toolbar - which on the face of it looks quite interesting.  </s>
<s> According to the toolbar http://www.w3.org has a page ranking of 10/10.  </s>
<s> thought is pretty good too.  </s>
<s> I was also intrigued by some of the languages available (see the attached picture) - especially given that they seem to use an rfc3066 type label on the download page.  </s>
