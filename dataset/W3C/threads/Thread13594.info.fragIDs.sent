<s> Hello UA and ER WGs, I'm looking for a pointer to techniques for repairing missing alt text in HTML.  </s>
<s> I thought we had such techs in the UAAG 1.0 Techniques document, but I can't find them.  </s>
<s> Any recommended algorithms we can point to?  </s>
<s> The Techniques Document does already include a reference to the Altifier [1].  </s>
<s> Thanks for any tips, _ Ian [1] http://www.vorburger.ch/projects/alt/  </s>

<s> Searching the Web for metadata which provides description is a technique.  </s>
<s> There are several ways to do this.  </s>
<s> Dublin Core description information can be held inside an image - for example SVG allows for metadata elements to contain it (along with title and desc elements that could be used to extract information).  </s>
<s> The JPEG, PNG and GIF formats can also be used to store such information - see the W3C Note "Describing and Retrieving Photos using RDF and HTTP" - It can also be held externally.  </s>
<s> Work along these lines includes Annotea - others.  </s>
<s> The results of the image annotation workshop held in bristol last month will soon be published, and can be expected to provide further leads and links.  </s>
<s> Information may also be available as a result of content negotiation.  </s>
<s> Some resources may have various formats available, including textual and graphic information.  </s>
<s> Finally it may be possible or useful to constuct a cache of images used and alternatives provided.  </s>
<s> Although this is not present in any brtowser I know of, it is possible in authoring tools, including wysiwyg authoring tools that can be used as browsers and offer a lot of navigation and similar features that make them potentially highly accessible to some people.  </s>

<s> We wrote about a variety of techniques in the AERT document.  </s>

<s> I know that LIFT does some kind of automatic categorisation of images.  </s>
<s> I don't know anything about their algorithm and whether it is public or not.  </s>
<s> This allows them to automatically determine with reasonable accuracy the purpose of some images, and so provide alt text.  </s>
