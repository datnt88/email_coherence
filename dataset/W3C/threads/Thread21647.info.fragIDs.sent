Is the W3C XSLT Service at http://www.w3.org/2001/05/xslt supposed to be working? 
Using the example URIs supplied on the page evokes this error - 
Proxy Error The proxy server received an invalid response from an upstream server. 
The proxy server could not handle the request GET /2000/06/webdata/xslt. 
Reason: Could not connect to remote machine: Connection refused 
- as do others I try.

Yeah, typically ;-) Back now. 
Out from server OS upgrade whoas debian potato- woody, 2.4 kernel and still using a 1.3 beta Sun JDK. 
Ran into memory issues apparently, cured with latest Blackdown JDK. 
Regards from your fans in W3C Systeam now conspiring what other services to disable in order to get email from other interesting parties.

Ummm ... I should perhaps mention that I am merely an 'Alan Cox' not 'The Alan Cox'. 
I don't have fans :-( Still, if it gets you to the front of the queue ... Thanks, Alan.
