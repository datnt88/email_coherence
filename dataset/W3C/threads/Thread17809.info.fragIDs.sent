There is now software available that will provide an auditory rendering of images and this can be done on the fly from the web provided that the browser sends a construct to activate the software when an image is downloaded. 
The software currently employed to handle the image to sound conversion in the form of a wav file from a bmp is called the vOICe which some of you may have heard of. 
Peter meeger and I and others have veen discussing this on the ig list and It was my thought that we could ask him to work with this if it is felt to be viable? 
This would have to be a user choice and would of course not be renderable by something like lynx, possibly pwweb speak and hpr as well, but could provide a level of functionality regarding images that is currently lacking. 
The user would also have to undergo some training but we are working on that part of it to comprehend the audio.

What type of markup are you using to associate the WAV file with the image?

Hi Jon and others, I think what David meant is to use existing tags like IMG but add the user option in browsers to select and "tap" the regular image output (as normally visible on-screen) and send the bitmap to an application that can turn it on-the-fly into corresponding image sounds. 
Software for the latter is already available from but browsers would have to be modified to support the use of the alternative image rendering in sound. 
So we are not dealing with wav files but with audio generated directly from gif's, jpg's, and so on. 
Using the current plug-in technology would not work because that requires changes to the web page like adding specialized embed or object tags. 
The idea is not to change or extend the markup (perhaps that can be useful too), but rather to change the interpretation and processing of existing markup, thus allowing for sound rendering of all images on all existing web pages, thereby avoiding any burden on website developers as well as avoiding the need for extra storage space and Internet bandwidth that the use of wav files would have involved: everything is done at the client side by his/her browser in cooperation with a powerful sonification add-on. 
For instance, the McDonalds website shows amongst other images the well-known McDonalds logo with the yellow golden arches making a big "M". 
After selecting this image in the envisioned modified browser and sending the bitmap to The vOICe sonification software, this would result in the "logo sound" (here an 88K wav file for demonstration purposes) This uses a left-to-right sound scan with height mapped to pitch. 
Blind website visitors could thus access and analyze the content of images on an HTML page. 
However, the link to popular browsers is currently still missing. 
Could there be guidelines for this?
