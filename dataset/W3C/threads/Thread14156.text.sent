Hi, This message is about AAATE Web Publication. 
I am not familar with Web files and HTML. 
On the directives you give guidelines and Good Practice indications. 
I do not understand very well. 
I want to know if the only think I have to do is to save my Word document (*.doc) in *.html format and to verify if evrything is OK with different browser ? 
And to send this file (of course!) Truly yours.

Fran?ois, unfortunately, that will not give you much guarantee (unless you test with a very large number of browsers) of compliance. 
One automatic test you could try is Bobby - http://www.cast.org/bobby - you ask it to look at the document you have published, and it will test for some problems and highlight them. 
It will also ask you to check mannually (since it cannot) some features, such as whether you have appropriate "Alt text" for images. 
If you look at your document in Lynx, or another text-only browser, you will be able to discover this. 
(If there is a problem, then I am not sure if you can use word to fix it or not.) Another thing you should do is make sure that you use proper structure - Headings, and so on made using the styles feature of word - since this is more likely to be properly translated correctly into HTML. 
If you are prepared to make an example page public, it might be easiest to use that to explain some more.

There are 2 sets of styles within word that are exclusive of each other. 
Document styles, such as "Heading1, Heading2, etc." and HTML styles, such as "H1, H2..." the default new document in word is for document styles. 
the HTML styles do not appear in the style pull down on the tool bar. 
You must use the document styles. 
Then when you "save as html" you will get font tags without structure. 
It is possible to search and replace various combinations of font tags and replace with Hx tags, but it's not fun. 
In order to "save as html" properly, you must choose the blank web page from the available new document templates. 
then when writing and applying a style you must be sure to pick the HTML styles (H1, H2...)which appear after the document styles - Heading1, etc. on the tool bar pull down.
