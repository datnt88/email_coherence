Caplan Delegada en Argentina del SID@R (Seminario de Iniciativas sobre Discapacidad y Accesibilidad en la Red) del Real Patronato sobre Discapacidad de Espa?a Miembro del Grupo de Expertos del SID@R Dear colleagues and friends in America, these crazy brains are definitely out of the borders of our concerns about inclusive www-design. 
On this rainy and cool Saturday evening in Germany it is still not easy to get back to the rituals of daily life, which for years in some important parts is also shaped by a pleasant and fruitful professional cooperation with you. 
Nevertheless, don't allow HATE to undermine our commitment. 
To show our sympathy with the victims of the terror-attacks in the United States my German fellow citizens and me will put a light or a candle in one or more of the windows of our houses today, 15.09.2001 from 8.00 pm for the whole evening.

One issue I found interesting was the fact that many of those who were wheelchair-bound or otherwise disabled were basically marked to die in the collapse of the WTC towers. 
Web designers and tech personnel in general, as well as the firms many work for, are some of the largest engines of the economy. 
I believe we could do the world a great service by pushing not just for an accessible web, but at least escapeable buildings as well. 
Does it relate to the www? 
No, not totally. 
But I've tended to take a larger view of technology accessibility than most, I admit. 
The web itself being accessible means little if people can't get to someplace to use it, can't use it safely, or have to put themselves at risk to use it in otherwise "normal" situations. 
John Henry Petroski and Samuel C. Florman are two of best sources on civil engineering. 
I've posted links to Dr. Petroski's recent article in the Washington Post, as well as references to Florman's work.
