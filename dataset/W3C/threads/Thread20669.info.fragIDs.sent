I've noticed that the main focus of people testing/using Amaya seems to have shifted to XML and MATHML. 
I haven't seen any comments for a while about the rendering of html and style sheets. 
The following comments are from using v.4.3.2 dated 23 March 2001. 
I've noticed that Amaya now renders complex tables properly, now actually better than IE or Netscape. 
Just one problem with the tables, I can't figure out how to remove the borders. 
In the source I have border="0" but it seems to have no efffect, I'm getting a thin dark border between cells. 
Also buttons for submitting forms don't grow to fit the text. 
Now onto CSS problems, I've set the colours for links but Amaya doesn't seem to show the colours. 
A normal link should be black and underlined, a visited link should be black without underline. 
Amaya uses default colours of blue and purple (the blue is almost impossible to read in the nav bar on the page). 
Also is there an possibility that Amaya will support JavaScripts? 
Looking good, keep up the great work. 
I tested the functionality. 
It seems to work correctly. 
Could you check that the attribute was correctly parsed (no reported parsing error). 
If the error persist, could you send us the document that generates that error. 
Some selectors are not correctly interpreted by Amaya. 
I guess it's the origin of your problem. 
This is still in our todo list. 
We've no plans for that support. 
We're waiting for external contributors.

I think I've figured out what the supposed border is, I've gone through Amaya's structured view and located and fixed several errors and still get the problem. 
After looking closely at the out put the "border" is the same colour as the background of the page. 
It looks like despite using cellspacing="0" in the table definition, Amaya is accidentally putting a small 1 pixel space between cells. 
Thanks for the help, I'll be looking at the source code and seeing what I can come up with down the road. 
Never know, I might actually contribute something.
