<s> I've noticed that the main focus of people testing/using Amaya seems to have shifted to XML and MATHML.  </s>
<s> I haven't seen any comments for a while about the rendering of html and style sheets.  </s>
<s> The following comments are from using v.4.3.2 dated 23 March 2001.  </s>
<s> I've noticed that Amaya now renders complex tables properly, now actually better than IE or Netscape.  </s>
<s> Just one problem with the tables, I can't figure out how to remove the borders.  </s>
<s> In the source I have border="0" but it seems to have no efffect, I'm getting a thin dark border between cells.  </s>
<s> Also buttons for submitting forms don't grow to fit the text.  </s>
<s> Now onto CSS problems, I've set the colours for links but Amaya doesn't seem to show the colours.  </s>
<s> A normal link should be black and underlined, a visited link should be black without underline.  </s>
<s> Amaya uses default colours of blue and purple (the blue is almost impossible to read in the nav bar on the page).  </s>
<s> Also is there an possibility that Amaya will support JavaScripts?  </s>
<s> Looking good, keep up the great work.  </s>
<s> I tested the functionality.  </s>
<s> It seems to work correctly.  </s>
<s> Could you check that the attribute was correctly parsed (no reported parsing error).  </s>
<s> If the error persist, could you send us the document that generates that error.  </s>
<s> Some selectors are not correctly interpreted by Amaya.  </s>
<s> I guess it's the origin of your problem.  </s>
<s> This is still in our todo list.  </s>
<s> We've no plans for that support.  </s>
<s> We're waiting for external contributors.  </s>
<s> Regards Irene.  </s>
<s> I think I've figured out what the supposed border is, I've gone through Amaya's structured view and located and fixed several errors and still get the problem.  </s>
<s> After looking closely at the out put the "border" is the same colour as the background of the page.  </s>
<s> It looks like despite using cellspacing="0" in the table definition, Amaya is accidentally putting a small 1 pixel space between cells.  </s>
<s> Thanks for the help, I'll be looking at the source code and seeing what I can come up with down the road.  </s>
<s> Never know, I might actually contribute something.  </s>
