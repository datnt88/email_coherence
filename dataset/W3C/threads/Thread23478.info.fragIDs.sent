hello. 
i am using a demo version of your software (found it off get it  right). 
i am trying to download 20 files all of which are around 2meg. the copy shortcut works. 
and i receive the mail. 
but the received mail  is only 
5.6k when the file is 2 megs! 
the partial file is corrupt, when opened by winzip. 
I am thinking about registering this software if it works. 
please notify  me if 
I am doing anything wrong? 
please write back at - MrcoolProblems@kinetik.co.nz or kinetik@sinesurf.co.nz this would be much appreciated. 
ps. your program is great, cheers to the inventor! 
Dear, I certainly cannot understand your e-mail. 
Maybe you wanted to send this mail to the originators of mrcool. 
So, Please clearify because www4mail is a completely different software. 
Thanks Clement Onime
