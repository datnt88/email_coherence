OK, I too, am confused about why proxies MUST NOT establish persistent connections with 1.0 clients. 
If the client and origin server connections are handled separately, and if the proxy understands the 1.0 Keep-alive, what's the danger? 
8.1.3Proxy 
Servers It is especially important that proxies correctly implement the properties of the Connection header field as specified in 14.2.1. 
The proxy server MUST signal persistent connections separately with its clients and the origin servers (or other proxy servers) that it connects to. 
Each persistent connection applies to only one transport link. 
A proxy server MUST NOT establish a persistent connection with an HTTP/1.0 client (but see RFC 2068 for information about the Keep-Alive header implemented by many HTTP/1.0 clients). 
EW OK, I too, am confused about why proxies MUST NOT establish EW persistent connections with 1.0 clients. 
If the client and EW origin server connections are handled separately, and if the EW proxy understands the 1.0 Keep-alive, what's the danger? 
I believe that the intent is that the proxy server not assume 1.1-style persistent connections. 
The prohibition does not apply to the non-standard Keep-Alive mechanism; that is why it is noted in the text you quoted: A proxy server MUST NOT establish a persistent connection with an HTTP/1.0 client (but see RFC 2068 for information about the Keep-Alive header implemented by many HTTP/1.0 clients).

If the client and EW origin server connections are handled separately, and if the EW proxy understands the 1.0 Keep-alive, what's the danger? 
Persistent connections in HTTP/1.0 must be established on a hop-by-hop basis, so that intermediaries (proxies) are not forced into persistent connections if they do not understand them. 
The connection: keep-alive header allowed a client to request a persistent connection from an origin server without consideration for intermediaries (end-to-end). 
To prevent this problem, clients connecting to origin servers via intermediaries were required to send a proxy-connection: keep-alive header instead which the proxy could convert to a plain connection: keep-alive header if it also implemented persistent connections. 
Origin servers only respond to the plain connection: keep-alive headers, knowing that if they receive a proxy-connection: keep-alive header that the proxy does not support persistent connections. 
This works fine in this scenario: C -- P -- OS Proxy chains were, in theory, to be supported by ensuring that only proxies at the end of the chain could perform keep-alive header conversions so that upstream proxies were not unwittingly forced into agreeing a persistent connection. 
Where P* is a proxy that will perform keep-alive header conversions, then a typical scenario might be: C -- P -- P -- P* -- OS Finally, the reason origin servers should not provide persistent connections to clients is that if the last proxy in the chain supports persistent connections, then the entire connection will be persistent regardless of whether all the downstream proxies support persistent connections. 
Proxy chains constructed in this way will never work because any proxy that does not support persistent connections will wait for an end of connection from the upstream proxy that will never arrive. 
If the first proxy in our chain did not support persistent connections the data flow would be: |C| -- |P| -- |P| -- |P*| -- |OS| | | | -- | | -- | | -- | | Hope that makes sense (it's not easy to explain without a drawing board).

MIMEsweeper: Content Security for Networks The fallacy in the attached description is the implication that a persistent connection is established on any basis except hop-hop. 
I would suggest reading section 19.7.1 in rfc2068. 
There can be no such thing as "unwittingly forced into agreeing to a persistent connection" and I think the RFC2068 section explains the issues more accurately.
