<s> Make sure that the guidelines are written such that "ascii representation" of math does not get interpreted as ASCII art --that would be useless both now and in the future.  </s>

<s> One question that I have been considering is whether to recommend a particular "ASCII representation" as an interim solution, and if so, which one.  </s>
<s> TeX is the obvious starting point: it is relatively well known and, as I understand it, largely unambiguous, but there may well be other possibilities.  </s>
<s> What we need is a kludge that will serve as an acceptable, albeit inadequate solution while we wait for software to be developed that can render MathML, both visually as well as in audio and braille media.  </s>
<s> This is definitely not my area of expertise, so perhaps I should not be commenting on it.  </s>
<s> you dont say ascii representation --you say markup notation e.g. TeX and leave it at that.  </s>
<s> TeX is the lingua franca of the mathematics community at this point.  </s>
