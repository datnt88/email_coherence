Hello, Is someone can help me ? 
I am searching examples of lawsuit between web sites and people impaired unable to access the sites... 
Is there some links, newsgroup, papers of very known "affair" ? 
By the way, some links towards lawsuit between handicapped and firms or others (always in an accessibility way) are welcome too... Thank you, J. 
There's two I know of, the AOL one: And Sydney Olympics: Tom Gilder 
In addition to those sent by Tom Gilder, there have been several complaints filed - not lawsuits - and agreements signed with U.S. banks. 
Most of these covered ATMs (automatic teller machines) and web, including: - http://www.icdri.org/bank_of_america_atm_settlement_a.htm - http://www.dlc-ma.org/atm/atmfa.htm 
I don't think any of the complaints are on the Internet. 
Some agreements are public, and some are not. 
http://www.icdri.org/news_on_talking_atms.htm lists announcements of talking ATMs.
