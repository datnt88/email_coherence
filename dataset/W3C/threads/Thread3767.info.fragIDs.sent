<s> :  </s>
<s> A few remarks about extract.xsl: - it uses some saxon extension (all the elements prefixed with saxon: ); while it makes life easier, I'd much prefer if you could avoid doing so, since that makes your XSLT not usable in a standard xslt processor.  </s>
<s> You can replace most of your use of saxon:function by equivalent named xsl:template (which are heavier to use, but are standard).  </s>
<s> Note that the part to extract the informations about the specification (title, editors, ...) is not really necessary, since there is already a style sheet that allows to extract those from a TR document: which itself uses a more generic style sheet to extract raw data from such document: With xsl:import, you can directly import the features you need from one or the other of these style sheets.  </s>
<s> I've already sent you my notes about the RDF syntax.  </s>
<s> Here is how should look an entry in an RDF glossary.  </s>
<s> Let's assume for the time being that we map one glossary into one RDF schema; for instance, we create an RDF schema for the glossary created in SpecGL Such a schema would contain an entry for each term looking like: rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/specGL/20030210#discretionaryChoices" rdfs:comment a value or behavior may be chosen from a well-defined enumerated set of two or more possibilities /rdfs:comment rdfs:isDefinedBy rdf:resource="http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-qaframe-spec-20030210/"/  </s>
<s> One of the advantage of using RDF is that you don't need to build specific tools to merge the results, since one of the by-design feature  </s>
<s> of RDF is its mergeability and that there are already tool to do that.  </s>
