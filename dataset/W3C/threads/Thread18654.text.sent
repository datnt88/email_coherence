Folks, I want to draw your attention to the W3C Note [1]. 
That WG is looking for direction on the level of semantic depth folks like you will want in your signatures. 
A couple of related questions bouncing around from that WG (based on an email from Bert Bos): - the XML-namespace draft allows changes in prefixes that namespace-aware applications are supposed to ignore. 
I think DOM-HASH and other processors will have to expand the namespace of every single ns-identifier so as to ensure they have a non-ambiguis hash, no? - if a document has a DTD and in the DTD there are fixed or default attributes that don't occur in the instance, do we consider those attributes to be part of the instance or not? 
- if a document has a DTD that defines "unparsed entities" (links to images and such; yeah, I know people should use Xlink for that, but XML still allows it) then the internal name of the entity is arbitrary. 
Should it be renamed in the canonical form? 
- to what degree should the semantic or surface structure of referenced resources be included in the hash? 
Where would you come down in addressing the old problem (even from PICS days) of what is the semantic scope of a resource that links or is composed of other resources?

DOMHash is defined on the "expanded name" whenever a name is qualified (either by default or an explicit namespace prefix). 
I think we want to consider them as a part of canonicalization. 
XML 1.0 Recommendation clearly states that if an XML processor encounters an omitted attribute, it is to behave as though the attribute were present with the declared default value. 
DOMHash assumes that the DOM structure is created by a conformant XML processor, so it counts the recovered attributes in the hash calculation. 
a Hiroshi Maruyama Hiroshi Maruyama Manager, Network Applications, Tokyo Research Laboratory Also Associate Professor, Dept. of Computer Science, Tokyo Institute of Technology I believe DOMHASH takes care of this by expanding the name (replacing the ns-identifier with the URI) I believe so. 
Also, don't we have to worry about substitute strings for general entities? 
These could change the context drastically. 
Yes, and I believe DOMHASH handles this. 
If I understand the problem, perhaps only canonical external references (but not the referenced content) should be included in the hash. 
However, we should allow signatures of external resources (e.g. external XLinked elements or external documents in non-XML formats.) Rich Himes
