Hi, I have had this bug across a couple of different versions, and it is intermittent but repeats reasonably often in the same circumstances. 
The result is that my X server quits. 
The cause is harder to find. 
It happens when I try to open might only happen when I have had my Amaya session running for a day or more. 
It has happened repeatedly with Amaya 5.3 and 6.1 - in both cases using the fink package for Macintosh OS X (I hope that helps to track it down. 
It is hard to find because it is intermittent but I will try to provide anything new I learn).

I guess it's a Motif version? 
Yes please, try to remember the ten last commands. 
I don't think so - anything else I do on the system works fine, and usually a lack of resources means everything just slows down for a while - it is rare to have a complete crash of my X server. 
Sorry, yes it is. 
Chaals Some more information: It happens when I follow the link from http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/ which is marked 'Member Page', and have to authenticate. 
It is reproducible under those circumstances... Start X server amaya http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF Follow the link 'Member Page' and the X server crashes.
