<s> Bone idle, I guess, Issue: wish to provide a way that 'google' can archive peepo.com  </s>
<s> so that a search provides links that whilst not directly related to a topic, do link directly to that topic.  </s>
<s> for instance: I link to a site that has a great 'tell the time' activity, however this site also has other great activities, such as paint, percussion, ...... Too many to individually provide links to at this time.  </s>
<s> However it would be great to be able to leave a record, so that on a future search this was picked up...  </s>
<s> Is this already a standard?  </s>
<s> if not anyone have a good hack?  </s>
<s> ie where I can dump the info so that google would pick it up?  </s>
<s> thanks  </s>

<s> I believe Google indexes real content only.  </s>
<s> They don't even process meta header elements, for indexing purposes.  </s>
<s> More generally, what you appear to be asking for is a mechanism that would be abused to mislead people into accessing the site.  </s>
<s> A commercial web site operator could create multiple web sites, most of which exist just link to their main web site, but provide irrelevant, but frequently requested, keywords to trick people into accessing the main site.  </s>
<s> I could imagine a service that indexes referrals and not the actual pages, but Google only uses referrals to establish popularity.  </s>
<s> In fact, there are proposals (RDF?) for letting sites create electronic reviews of other sites, however I don't get the impression that commercial sites have taken any real interest in these.  </s>
<s> As we all know, most barely understand HTML.  </s>
<s> I'm not even actually sure whether you really are suggesting hidden keywords referencing third parties or hidden keywords for your own site, but either way, Google's philosophy is that they don't process hidden material, and engines that do would object to sites that have hidden keywords that don't relate to visible content of the same site.  </s>
<s> I haven't tried, but understand one can include text, and either offset, or  </s>
<s> 1pt it, to fool google etc.  </s>
<s> that isn't my concern.  </s>
<s> imagine a jpg with 400M hits, sounds like a good one to me.  </s>
<s> so in order to judge the value of a site we need some guide as to why people visit it. the onward links qualify this, I could put it all in the alt, longdesc or just make up a tag.  </s>
<s> i was merely asking if this is already done, or planned more broadly.  </s>
<s> (seems not from the response) thanks jay  </s>
<s> Google rely on the fact that you will only get lots of incoming links if the site is worthwhile, so they don't police for keyword stuffing.  </s>
<s> However other search engines are likely to blacklist you if they catch you out.  </s>
<s> Marketing people have been thinking of these tricks for years now and search engines operators have been searching for ways to make them ineffective.  </s>
<s> David I am well aware of the issue addressing, it is not the one I originally wrote about.  </s>
<s> which is about information, not 'keyword stuffing'  </s>
<s> thanks j  </s>
<s> or  </s>
<s> The problem is that tools that can be used for one job are often usurped for other jobs.  </s>
<s> As a result, search engine operators have policies that are designed to cope with the real world, not with a world behaving nicely.  </s>
<s> Even the most respectable of blue chip companies have been known to keyword stuff with white on white text - the keywords tend to be relevant in those cases, but it is still producing a page that doesn't match the visible content.  </s>
<s> You are using an end justifies the means argument, but the people trying to increase their sales consider their sales a justified end.  </s>
<s> When making proposals, you have to consider how the technology will be abused and how the abuse counter-measures will impact you.  </s>
<s> If you want to make reccommendations with current search engines, you need to make those reccommendations explicit and visible and then, for popularity based engines like Google, make your page popular.  </s>
<s> As I hinted, there are ideas, I think amongst the semantic web people, for having mechanisms for reccommending pages with specific annotations, but these seem to be limited to a small academic community at the moment.  </s>
<s> One reason for this is probably that commercial web sites are not in the  </s>
<s> businesss of reccommending other commercial web sites (they rarely even link to them).  </s>
<s> Another reason might be that the search engine operators see too much potential for abuse - any means of abusing them *will* be used; that's the way the world works.  </s>
<s> Yet another reason might be the legal risks associated with making negative comments.  </s>
<s> Actually, the biggest real world (i.e. commercial) reason why hidden reccommendations of a site would not be attractive to most people is that they only business model that makes sense is a commission based one (this already happens for overt reccommendations - Amazon, I believe, pays sites when people purchase as results of a link to their site, and it is the basis of how best buy sites work as a business).  </s>
<s> Such a business model wouldn't encourage honest appraisals - it has the same problem as magazine publishers have; they can't afford to offend their advertisers or encourage non-commercial alternatives.  </s>
<s> Probably a closer analogy is "indpendent financial advisers" who will prefer the product with the higher commission.  </s>
<s> (The consumer side of the market forces equation means that they can't be completely driven by commission rates/advertising revenue.) The other business models for referrals rely on people visiting the referring site, generally, to be presented with paid advertising, or at least have market survey data extracted from them (if only be examining what they are asking about and where they go next); or on a subscription service, where the ability to log in to the site needs to be proved to ensure the subscription has been paid.  </s>
<s> Even academics need to maintain publicity of their sites, in order to influence funding bodies.  </s>
<s> That leaves amateur sites.  </s>
<s> Most of which would not be sophisticated enough to contribute to such a mechanism, and the ones that would be sophisticated enough would, at least for me, be the sites I wanted to look at, rather than any commercial sites to which they were referring.  </s>
