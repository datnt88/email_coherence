From: Jan Richards 1. How big will the icons be? 
While 32 x 32 is nice, these larger icons will expand the line spacing and may end up doubling an already long document. 
Can 16x16 versions of the first two icons be produced to get a better comparison? 
I'd prefer the larger ones, are they the 32 by 32? 
At least I can see what they contain. 
They become iconic then, rather than smudges :-) Surely the additional real-estate isn't that much? 
3. Which colours? 
If we decide on colours for each category that are easy to see and distinguish, then all the icons can use the same colours and we can eliminate that as a variable. 
Nice idea! 
Which colors though, considering color blindness etc! I think we need icons that can be identified at a glance by their shape (as Katy says) and colour, without messing up the page layout. 
I like the idea of having a 'shape' to each one!

CMN Since these are essentially replacing text labels, there is an issue if they eat too much space. 
(I think). 
For people who are reading the text close packed for reading efficiency, doubling out the spacing can be very frustrating. 
So it is important that the icons can be rendered at some fairly small size, I think - 16x16 seems to be good based on the test we have here. 
(I the example page I produced the other icons at that size in some of the examples, just to see how it worked). 
But I agree that there will be people who would like to have the icons large. 
Me for example.

Nice idea! 
Which colors though, considering color blindness etc! CMN I don't think that we need to standardise on colours befrore picking the icons - colour is an integral part of a design (at least in terms of saturation and hue balancing), and I think that the colouring of the two schemes that have a lot of it is distinctive in both cases - more so in the set three. 
(See seperate discussion about changing the crossover between content tools and multimedia tools in set one) For people who are colourblind (or have colourblind systems...) it is important taht the icons are easily distinguished by some other feature such as shape. 
That's what I don't like about the second set, which I think are in fact the nicest set of the three. 
Especially when they are reduced in size.

CMN Me too. 
I think that these three requirements are certainly important in the use case, and I suspect that they are generally important to making good icons (the layout one s the most difficult issue of the three - I think both shape and colour are important) cheers Charles Perhaps you could Identify the size for a couple of them? 
Regards DaveP if close fairly here. 
people Why the urge to remove the textual labels? 
Text, properly done, can be at least as helpful as iconography, especially given the learning curve of icons that require a key. 
Not to mention you can't do a find in your browser for an image, and it won't search alt text. 
I think I have time in my busy schedule (hahaha. 
:) to do a textual treatment of your example text, if you're interested. 
I think, with that said, that set 3 does the job most adequately. 
Color, which is extremely helpful when scanning a document like this, is used to good effect here, insofar as the image still communicates the message without the color, and going down to 1-bit color displays, the backgrounds will most likely dither to white. 
Then, if I'm a multimedia tool provider, I can rely on color first, if that's available to me, to scan the page for salient information. 
And if I can't rely on it, I can fall back on pattern matching, which is slower, but that's what all of the other icons here are relying on. 
(Though it's worth noting to the author the high incidence of red-green colorblindness among males...) It's worth noting that set 3 isn't trying to do too much, and it's clear where the icons start and end. 
I agree with Emmanuelle's comment that set 2 is an excellent set of illustrative icons, but since they're used repetitively, I think the goal here is to make the simplest possible icon. 
To critique set 1, I should point out that the other two sets define the boundaries of their icons, where set 1 does not. 
Doing so keeps the viewer from having to define where the icon starts and ends, which takes time to process (defined here as fractions of a second, but still) before they can process the image itself. 
I think set 1 may have tried to communicate too much information in its icons, since these are only needed as indicators of relevance to a tool set, not as descriptive or explanatory images. 
m Not at my best in formulating English right now - maybe I'm just tired g/ Anyway, here's a draft proposal, subject to better wording, but I hope the intention is clear enough: 6.3 In a dedicated section, document the process of producing accessible content. 
[Priority 3] At minimum, provide an overview of tags and attributes that are required for or enhance accessibility. 
Ideally, the text should explain which features help for which types of disability and tools; a general overview of steps to produce accessible content would be helpful. 
Various techniques could help with that, one of them being: At minimum: a "wrapper" document that lists tags and attributes and their function for accessibility, with links to a general HTML reference for syntax and context.
