<s> Hello, I meet this problem that crashes Amaya 6.0 * CRITICAL **: file eazel-theme-draw.c:  </s>
<s> line 1640 (draw_flat_box): assertion `height  = -1' failed.  </s>

<s> Strange, Amaya doesn't include that file and doesn't call that function.  </s>
<s> What it the context of that bug?  </s>
<s> What are you doing (editing, browsing)?  </s>
<s> What file?  </s>
<s> What platform?  </s>
<s> I use Amaya on Linux (Mandrake 8.1), the bug was while editing a table.  </s>
<s> I use 6.1 now, but there's a lot of problem for edition : - The major one is that Amaya is not completly WYSIWYG, because it adds a lot of unneed ' p '. It seems this is due to delete characters ?  </s>
<s> - I notice some strange behavior, that puts the first letter of each sentence to the right, this is again the consequences of the deletion function (supposed).  </s>
<s> Most the time the problems come with the table management.  </s>
<s> Else, I notice that the 6.1 for GTK was in a corrupted .tgz  </s>
<s> format (I try by HTTP I supposed this is the same service).  </s>
<s> Thank for your Work.  </s>
