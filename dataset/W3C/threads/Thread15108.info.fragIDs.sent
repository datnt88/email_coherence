<s> But Text to Speech is an inexact science - even people who are experts cannot agree to pronounce words the same way.  </s>

<s> No, it's not obvious at all.  </s>
<s> Yes, when in doubt, hypenate compounds if you have any doubt as to how long they have been in the language.  </s>

<s> But they do touch on text-to-speech, along with lay persons, people operating in a second language, and others with reading difficulty as at risk on account of unusual words including neologisms: The point is to have and apply a reasonably small word list and handle those things that fall outside this list as special.  </s>
