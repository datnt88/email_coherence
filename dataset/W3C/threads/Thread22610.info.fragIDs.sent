<s> I'm not sure this came up in earlier comments ...  </s>
<s> There's no way to associate NOTATION or ENTITY nodes with a doctype node.  </s>
<s> An API for that should exist, so that portable code can be written to fully populate a DOM tree from parser input (such as a SAX or SAX2 parser).  </s>
<s> - Dave  </s>
<s> DocumentType's "entities" and "notations" attributes are NamedNodeMaps.  </s>
<s> You can retrieve the appropriate NamedNodeMap, then use its setNamedItem methods to add one of these definitions.  </s>
<s> The real problem is that there's no factory method for NOTATIONs or ENTITYs.  </s>
<s> And DOM Level 2 doesn't fix this.  </s>
<s> Level 3 will have to, as part of the DTD/Content Model support.  </s>
<s> Joe Kesselman / IBM Research  </s>
<s> Those are required to be readonly NamedNodeMap objects.  </s>
<s> See the DOM L1 spec as regards the definitions of those attributes.  </s>
<s> The phrase is "cannot be altered in any way".  </s>
<s> What you suggest is nonconformant.  </s>
<s> Like I said, the RFE is **for DOM L2** ... no new features, only asking  </s>
<s> completion of support for the existing features.  </s>
<s> Like finishing the support for DocumentType objects which L2 has already started.  </s>
<s> - Dave  </s>
<s> Hmm. True.  </s>
<s> I keep forgetting that.  </s>
<s> I think the decision has been made to address DTD support in Level 3, and since that will cover your RFE -- and since it's _long_ after Last Call for Level 2 -- I think you'll have to wait.  </s>
<s> Default attributes have the same  </s>
<s> problem; we specified their read behavior but there's still no way to build the data structures required to support them.  </s>
<s> I wanted DTD support in Level 1, and Level 2. Didn't happen.  </s>
<s> We can try to expedite Level 3...  </s>
<s> Joe Kesselman / IBM Research  </s>
<s> I believe any attempt to set or remove an entity or notation should result in an exception in DOM level 1 or two.  </s>
<s> There needs to be a way to do this, but there are issues of liveness to be worked out before it can be supported in a standard way by the specification.  </s>

<s> In short, you're arguing that all issues coming out of reviews from now on will generally be ignored ... hence implying that there is really no need for such reviews.  </s>
<s> Last time I looked  </s>
<s> at W3C process documents, that stage was called "REC" not "WD".  </s>
<s> It's responses like that that give W3C a bad reputation in terms of being a steward for standards.  </s>
<s> - Dave  </s>
<s> What Joe said was that these issues would be addressed in Level 3, which will be starting as soon as we have Level 2 out the door.  </s>
<s> This does not mean the issues will be ignored, simply that the resources were not available to solve all the problems we could see, and the DOM WG as a whole decided it was important to get a Level 2 REC out as soon as possible.  </s>
<s> We have incorporated several of your ideas in the latest draft of the spec (which will be out very shortly) and discussed all of them.  </s>
<s> I'm sorry that I'm so late in getting the disposition of comments ready; one reason for this is that we were discussing the various issues raised by all the reviewers until today.  </s>
