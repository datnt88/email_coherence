Hello, I've a quick question on the fix-uri option of Tidy. 
It is my understanding that the fix-uri option is "yes" by default. 
(Although I've set this option to "yes" in my config file) indent: yes indent-spaces: 2 fix-uri: yes show-warnings: yes output-xhtml: yes output-xml: yes wrap: 72 However, any html with an unescaped link, when passed through tidy with the above config, doesn't result in an escaped link in the final html. 
For eg. the link I'm trying to escape using tidy is: http://www.something.org?onething=1&amp;anotherthing=2&amp;everything=1+2. 
The link arrives in the output html with the '&amp;' character alone encoded with the html "&amp;amp;" .. and not its equivalent escaped url character "%26". 
Am I doing something wrong ? 
I shall read through the documentation again (perhaps even the source code) but if someone' knows what I'm doing wrong and can help me out, that'd be awesome! 
thanks, -Amit.

If it's encoded using the %hh encoding it loses this special meaning, i.e. your link is normally interpreted as having three parameters onething = 1 anotherthing = 2 everything = 1+2 if you change it to ? 
http://www.something.org?onething=1%26anotherthing=2%26everything=1+2 it will be interpreted as having a single parameter onething = 1&amp;anotherthing=2&amp;everything=1+2 If Tidy converted &amp; to %26 most links will break, that's not the intention of that option. 
Ah, but you missed something. 
It is technically correct to use And incorrect to use onething=1&amp;anotherthing=2 While leaving the amp; off works. 
That is because the browsers realize that everyone leaves it off and make it work. 
And when using xml you have to use &amp;amp; to keep the parsers from complaining. 
Sorry everyone. 
My mistake made in my zeal to be able to actually contribute something. 
I didn't read the original email closely enough and what I was saying doesn't apply, and Bjoern hit it on the head.
