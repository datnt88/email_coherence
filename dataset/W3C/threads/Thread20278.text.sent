Dear Sir, Very thank you to read this mail! 
We had a question on Amaya . 
Because we want to find a browser , that can work on embedded-linux playform. 
So we find Amaya , and because it is open source code . 
But we don't know how to make clear the code and how to cut the module for only have browser function , not include edit HTML function. 
So please help us to find some solution . 
Thanks! Regards, Steven.Shiou

I'm sure others will answer this also, but I think Amaya is not a good selection since it is explicitly designed as an editor first and a browser second. 
You should probably be using Mozilla or Konqueror instead, both of which are open source and are much better browsers than Amaya! 
Hope that helps, *** Xanni *** P.O. Box 26, East Melbourne VIC 8002 Australia Phone +61 0401 258 915 You know that Amaya is mainly an editor and it doesn't provide some browser functions like the support of Frames, Scripts, and the Mail. 
Nevertheless if you want to cut editing functions in Amaya, you have: 1) to edit the file Amaya/amaya/EDITOR.A for removing menus New, Edit_, StructTypes, Types, Links, Style, Attributes_, Annotations_ 2) change the makefile for removing all editing modules *edit.c, 
EDIT*.c, UIcss.c, HTMLpresentation.c, and probably EDITORactions.c 3) perhaps you will have to move some functions from one module to another. 
Irene.
