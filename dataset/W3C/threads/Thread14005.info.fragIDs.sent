<s> In my view the guidelines may be improved in everthing related to style sheets.  </s>
<s> I listed down a few tips for style sheets and some examples.  </s>
<s> Wording needs more work.  </s>
<s> I think it is better not to have bad examples in the guidelines, but I included them here for comparison.  </s>
<s> Stylesheet tips: Consistent style throughout the site increases usability, easier to maintain, and faster download for the users: * use a centralized stylesheet for the whole website.  </s>
<s> use linked stylesheets.  </s>
<s> * Avoid inline style.  </s>
<s> To assure good rendering when your site is read without your stylesheets:  </s>
<s> * Use DIV and SPAN *only after* you run out of HTML meaning- carrying elements.  </s>
<s> If you want to strongly emphasize text  </s>
<s> use the STRONG element and assign styles to it, rather than using SPAN.  </s>
<s> Make it possible to use the same classes in stylesheets designed for different media: * Define class and id to mark *content related concepts* that are not covered by HTML elements.  </s>
<s> Define classes site-wide and not in each page.  </s>
<s> Do not define classes by the typographical features of a particular medium.  </s>
<s> bad class choices: redline newbullet dropcap good class choices: new warning summary chapter toc HTML and Stylesheets examples: Bad Example: .newtxt  </s>
<s> { font-weight: bold; color: red; background-color: yellow } .newbullet  </s>
<s> { list-style : url(yellow.gif)  </s>
<s> } End bad example.  </s>
<s> Good Example: STRONG {font-weight: bold;} UL LI.new {list-style : url(yellow.gif);}  </s>
<s> UL LI.new STRONG {color: red; background-color: yellow;} End good example.  </s>
<s> Bad example: P This is an IMG src="BigRedExample.gif"  </s>
<s> alt="example" of what we mean.  </s>
<s> /P End of bad example.  </s>
<s> Good example: STRONG IMG {font-weight: bold; font-size: bigger; font-color: red;} P This is an STRONG IMG src="BigRedExample.gif"  </s>
<s> alt="example" /STRONG of what we mean.  </s>
<s> /P End of good example.  </s>
<s> Some browsers may apply style rules to alt text.  </s>
<s> e.g., Lynx would show the alt text "example" strongly emphasized.  </s>
<s> Opera3.5 even applies the style sheet to the alt text.  </s>
<s> Bad example: .dropcap  </s>
<s> { font-size : 120%; font-family : Helvetica } P SPAN class="dropcap" O /SPAN nce upon a time... Good example: .story  </s>
<s> P:first-letter { font-size: 120%; font-family : Helvetica } P Once upon a time... Bad example (IMG has no alt among other things): End bad example.  </s>
<s> Another bad example: HR.redline { color : red } End bad example.  </s>
<s> Good example: DIV.chapter {border-bottom: thin solid red;} DIV#chapter-7:after {content: "End of Chapter 7 - Visual Displays"} DIV#chapter-8:after {content: "End of Chapter 8 - Auditory and Tactile Displays"} End good example.  </s>
<s> Nir Dagan, Ph.D. "There is nothing quite so practical as a good theory." -- A. Einstein  </s>
<s> I agreed with most of what you say, but I wonder if this is bound to Universal Design/Accessibility, or just to CSS good design guidelines, which is related, I understand, but is getting a little far fetched in terms of what we're asking author to do.  </s>
<s> Better wording: "Instead of using DIV and SPAN elements to add style, try subclassing  </s>
<s> existing HTML elements though the CLASS attribute.  </s>
<s> For example, if you want to stronly emphasize a text, use the EM element with CLASS set to (say) "extra" instead of using SPAN."  </s>
<s> I'm unhappy with both of these formulations, sorry.  </s>
<s> They're expressed negatively, and it's better to start with a positive statement of what is being aimed at, IMHO.  </s>
<s> I'd want something like (but it still needs work): "Give priority to expressing the structure of your content by means of an appropriate HTML tag.  </s>
<s> Enhance these, where appropriate, with a CLASS attribute and stylesheet suggestion(s).  </s>
<s> Only resort to DIV or SPAN when HTML has no more-appropriate tag." (and then your example, by all means).  </s>
<s> hope that was useful  </s>
<s> OK.  </s>
