DeltaV methods which take request bodies are extensible, in that the DTDs for the top-level element in the body are all declared to allow ANY sub-elements. 
However, there are three methods which are not defined to take request bodies: MKACTIVITY, MKWORKSPACE, and UNCHECKOUT. 
Should the protocol explicitly declare that they can be extended by defining request bodies for them?

Sounds reasonable to me. 
Any objections? 
Cheers, Geoff Sounds gratuitous to me, but I don't object.
