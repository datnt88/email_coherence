This is the usual weekly call for items for the telecon agenda. 
On my list of possibles I have: Issues xmlsch-03 xmlsch-04 pfps-13 DanC-04 add a trivially true predicate 
Comments on the Owl docs Proposed rdf schema class timbl-03 - extra rdf:List triples - update from webont language tags in typed literals pfps-13 facets in datatypes xmlsch-01 typed literal structure xmlsch-02 whitespace facets vass-02 property instances Brian 
I didn't mean for this to take WG time. 
I really do think the danc-04 naming convention is actively harmful. 
I ask, again, that you stop using it (for new issues; don't rename existing ones). 
I didn't mean to raise a new issue. 
I meant my "trivially true" suggestion as a contribution to the existing issue about making rdfs:comment semantically vacuous. 
Let's see... where is that one... where's the last call issues list? 
Ah.. "last call issue list published in html and rdf." odd that the link text is "html", but no matter... 
This one: "rdfs:comment semantics" I presumed the recipients of www-rdf-comments would relate my comment to the existing issue rather than make a new one. 
Hmm... I guess I wasn't paying attention when we agreed to this: "While the WG is sympathetic to the need for semantically empty comments, to add a special syntax for them was considered too much of a change to RDF at this stage and possibly outside the WG charter."

We'd already closed horrock-01 when this showed up and to our shame hadn't considered this possibility. 
It didn't take a lot of time, but I felt was worth checking out. 
ok Brian 
I had rather lost the plot ... I was reading the subject as: weekly call or agenda items is trivially true iff weekly call is true or agenda items is true I suspect that given the weekly call we can simply say yes.
