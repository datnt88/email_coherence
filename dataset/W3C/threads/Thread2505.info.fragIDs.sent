<s> Unfortunately, the issues list at references the wrong email message from Roy as the Proposed Resolution.  </s>
<s> The reference to should be replaced by a reference to where Roy said "I am changing my proposed change."  </s>
<s> Anyway, I would like to suggest a few minor, non-normative changes (to Roy's updated proposal):  </s>
<s> (1) I think this note (in Roy's proposal) Note: An origin server wishing to use a relatively new HTTP cache control feature, such as the "private" directive, on a network that includes older caches which do not understand that feature, will need to combine the new feature with an old Expires value in order to prevent the older caches from caching the response.  </s>
<s> could be made slightly clearer: Note: An origin server wishing to use a relatively new HTTP cache control feature, such as the "private" directive, on a network including older caches that do not understand that feature, will need to combine the new feature with an Expires field whose value is less than or equal to the Date value.  </s>
<s> This will prevent older caches from improperly caching the response.  </s>
<s> (2) I think it would be a good idea to include after the last paragraph of this section (14.9.3): If a cache returns a stale response, either because of a max-stale directive on a request, or because the cache is configured to override the expiration time of a response, the cache MUST attach a Warning header to the stale response, using Warning 10 (Response is stale). the following note: Note: A cache may be configured to return stale responses without validation, but only if this does not conflict with any MUST-level requirements concerning cache validation (e.g., a "must-revalidate" Cache-control directive).  </s>
<s> In a private email discussion during March, Roy pointed out that this is said elsewhere in the specification.  </s>
<s> However, I'm concerned that some implementors may misconstrue the discussion in 14.9.3 without such a reminder.  </s>
<s> -Jeff  </s>
<s> Looks good to me.  </s>
<s> ....Roy  </s>
<s> The CLARIFY-NO-CACHE issue: boils down to: the meaning of no-cache="field-name" in a response probably needs to be made more explicit.  </s>
<s> To state the issue in somewhat more detail, RFC2068 says this about the "no-cache" Cache-control directive in a response: 14.9 Cache-Control cache-response-directive =  </s>
<s> "no-cache" [ "=" " 1#field-name " ]  </s>
<s> 14.9.1 What is Cachable no-cache Indicates that all or part of the response message MUST NOT be cached anywhere.  </s>
<s> This allows an origin server to prevent caching even by caches that have been configured to return stale responses to client requests.  </s>
<s> 14.9 also says: When a directive appears without any 1#field-name parameter, the directive applies to the entire request or response.  </s>
<s> When such a directive appears with a 1#field-name parameter, it applies only to the named field or fields, and not to the rest of the request or response.  </s>
<s> This mechanism supports extensibility; implementations of future versions of the HTTP protocol may apply these directives to header fields not defined in HTTP/1.1.  </s>
<s> However, I think it takes a fair amount of inference to combine these two paragraphs into a precise definition of what Cache-control: no-cache=foo really means.  </s>
<s> PROPOSED SOLUTION: I replacing (in 14.9.1) the paragraph: Indicates that all or part of the response message MUST NOT be cached anywhere.  </s>
<s> This allows an origin server to prevent caching even by caches that have been configured to return stale responses to client requests.  </s>
<s> with paragraph: If the no-cache directive does not specify a field-name, then a cache MUST NOT use the response to satisfy a subsequent request without successful revalidation with the origin server.  </s>
<s> This allows an origin server to prevent caching even by caches that have been configured to return stale responses to client requests.  </s>
<s> If the no-cache directive does specify one or more field-names, then a cache MAY use the response to satisfy a subsequent request, subject to any other restrictions on caching; however, the specified field-name(s) MUST NOT be sent in the response to a subsequent request without successful revalidation with the origin server.  </s>
<s> This allows an origin server to prevent the re-use of certain header fields in a response, while still allowing caching of the rest of the response.  </s>
<s> -Jeff P.S.: As I wrote in I'm not sure that this convoluted definition of no-cache really makes life easier for people.  </s>
<s> I remember arguing that we should be using a wider range of names for cache-control directives, and being accused of trying to make the specification "too complex."  </s>
<s> But it's probably too late to change the actual specification of "no-cache", although I think it's clear that we need to clarify it.  </s>
<s> However, my preference would be to replace the BNF cache-response-directive =  </s>
<s> "no-cache" [ "=" " 1#field-name " ]  </s>
<s> with cache-response-directive =  </s>
<s> "no-cache" "no-cache-field" "=" " 1#field-name "  </s>
<s> and then do the obvious simplification of the description proposed above.  </s>
