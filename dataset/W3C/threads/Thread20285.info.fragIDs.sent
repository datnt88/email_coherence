<s> Apparently this message didn't get through the first time (Sunday), at least it's still not not in the WWW archive (Tuesday), though a bcc reached me.  </s>
<s> So I hope it's o.k. that I send it a second time.  </s>
<s> Hi, when I insert special characters into a formula, many of them first show up correctly, after saving it you can see the update in the source code: here there are already totally different characters (one byte code, no entities), others like the greek letters (I haven't tried all of them) are displayed as entities in the sopurce code (like &amp;alpha;).  </s>
<s> After reloading the page in the browser the first type of characters (probably all but greek characters like bullet, infinity, proportional, arrows)are completeley messed up and become just other special characters.  </s>
<s> I use Amaya 3.1 on Win 95; in the last version of Amaya that I used, e.g. a bullet became &amp;bull; in the source, but now it becomes ".".  </s>
<s> I want to use Amaya for a physics presentation soon, and like this it's diddicult to edit formula.  </s>
<s> Is the old version still available somewhere, until this bug is fixed?  </s>
<s> Another minor bug: when clicking the "alpha beta gamma" button a character that is displayed as a square is inserted into the formula.  </s>
<s> Inserting images doesn't work at all (yes, I was clever enough to insert an alt text after the dialog box "alt text is mandatory" showed up, but it doesn't work anyway).  </s>
<s> At least for my purposes the old version worked better, so it would be nice to make it available again until you can fix the bugs!  </s>
<s> Thanks!  </s>
