I clicked on the text only link and all it did was take me to the bottom of the page where the active links are. 
Maybe someone should alert them as to just how accessible their site is, hmmm? 
Joyce Has anyone made a purchase from the US Mint's catalog using Lynx with SSL? 
The URL is http://www.usmint.gov/catalog 
http://www.usmint.gov/catalog 
Would like to know how it works? 
This is one of the things that we have to do. 
We are building a test room and need to get the testers up to speed on the JAWS, pwWebSpeak, and Lynx with SSL. 
Bruce: Thanks for replying. 
No, I don't have authority over either group. 
And, I'll write CommArts for clarification. 
I probably should have slowed down before I posted that question, but when the article said the site was "accessible," I interpreted it to mean ADA compliant. 
And, I doubt that I'm the only one. 
Granted I'm more aware of such issues. 
I should ask whether the article's author made that assumption, or is the webmaster selling the site as accessible. 
It does have a "text only" link and haphazard alt tags. 
My concern, especially after the ADA hearing last week, is that there is a lot of misinformation or lack of information out there. 
I guess the question comes down to what "accessible" is? 
Does a site need to have the W3C/WAI and Bobby seal of approval? 
This is what I've been led to believe. 
Like some, I'm new to this field and am trying to get a handle on HTML coding, scripting languages, etc. Prior to this position, I managed three trade association sites with an HTML editor that was two years old. 
I had no clue that accessibility was even an issue. 
I'm also completing a Masters degree in Library &amp; Information Science and there are very few people in my field that are aware of this issue, and this is a community that is very attuned to traditional issues of access to information. 
I guess it comes down to the fact that we are all working hard to educate friends, colleagues, acquaintance, etc. about how accessibility should be achieved and how it benefits everyone. 
Just my two cents.

Bruce: Thanks for responding! 
The paragraph that mentions accessibility is in the fifth paragraph. 
(You have to select the link for "This week's site on the initial page. 
I forgot to mention that.) "Created with HTML and JavaScript the site is completely accessible and the only real problem is that video clips are presented with MS Media Player and it unfortunately doesn't work smoothly on every machine-as a matter of fact it's downright quirky." 
Having studied the WAI guidelines, I was under the impression that you could only use Javascript if a text alternative was provided. 
Is this true? 
Is there a way to make Javascript accessible without it. 
Any light you could shed on this would be most appreciated. 
Thanks again.

It's not accessible, not even the home page. 
It spoofs Bobby (not deliberately, Bobby is easily confused by JavaScript). 
I will try to give more details tomorrow. 
The "real" URL (that a text browser gets redirected to) is at: Paste that URL into Bobby and you will get MUCH different results than the "false positive" that comes up by default. 
I don't think Bobby's problems with JavaScript are documented anywhere, but it has come up on this list before.

Dear Editor, Your review (and selection of site of the week) of the Victoria's Secret site caused quite a stir on the "Web Accessible Initiative" interest group The discussion was over your article posted at URL: The problem is that your author wrote that the VS site was "accessible". 
What does she mean by that term? 
In the vernacular, "accessible" has become something of a buzz word that is free of semantic content. 
In the disability rights community, we take accessible to mean "functional for people who rely upon assistive technology". 
The VS site clearly does NOT fall into this category. 
Specifically, an "accessible" web site is one that satisfies the Priority 1 checkpoints of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines. 
The full (detailed) guidelines can be found at URL: The quick-and-easy "top ten" version is at URL: Please avoid the term "accessible" unless you mean it in this context. 
I would encourage you to report on accessibility (for persons with disabilities) and formal validity as part of your routine site review process. 
Please let me know if you would like further elaboration on these points. 
Sincerely, Bruce Bailey Webmaster for the Maryland State Department of Education (MSDE) Division of Rehabilitation Services (DORS) 410/554-9211
