<s> Hello Everyone, I'm not an expert on URI's but, I am an author on the LSID specification and would like to clarify some issues.  </s>
<s> 1) URI's are a nightmare in the lifesciences.  </s>
<s> Particularly when used  </s>
<s> to encode semantic information about a particular entity that exists on the web.  </s>
<s> For example (from the DAS 1.0 specification):  </s>
<s> '/wormbase/das/elegans/features?segment=CHROMOSOME_I:1000,2000' This leads the programmer and biologist to certain conclusions about  </s>
<s> query semantics ie. what this URI encodes and (perhaps) what the programmer meant when using a certain encoding scheme.  </s>
<s> People infer meaning from a URI and learn this semantic very quickly.  </s>
<s> Some would argue that this is a good thing however, once the biologist trains themselves on this type of system, the developers of these systems are forever locked into this scheme of identification.  </s>
<s> This will forever become the identifier for this entity.  </s>
<s> In the case noted above, this is particularly cumbersome: If a researcher has started to annotate this region of the chromosome with metadata and the underlying data changes As with any scientific data, there must be a way to reasonably reproduce the evidence that lead to a particular result or hypothesis.  </s>
<s> By encoding things with URI's we do not guard against the fact that the underlying data may change.  </s>
<s> This leads me to a question about "persistent" URI's and URL's  </s>
<s> (PURLS's): How do you ensure that two URI's are pointing at the same object (bytes)?  </s>
<s> If we can collectively answer this question we can encode an LSID any way we please as long as we keep in mind that this information must persist as long as a journal or other well vetted scientific medium.  </s>
<s> 2) (sorry to be repetitive) Scientists typically perform research on  </s>
<s> the web as a supplemental exercise.  </s>
<s> By this, I mean that most researchers use data gathered from the web to enhance their knowledge about a certain gene, protein, transcript, chemical etc.  </s>
<s> This data is not typically referenced in a journal article etc. If we want to allow for the incorporation and dissemination of scientific information and knowledge across the internet as a common means of communication we need to ensure two things:  </s>
<s> a) Persistence b) Provenance Science requires that an experiment be reproducible by other  </s>
<s> researchers and that the discoverer/institution get credit for the discovery made or technique used to make the discovery.  </s>
<s> We must pay particular attention to this as we craft the LSID specification.  </s>
<s> 3) Browsers, HTTP semantics of query, RESTful interfaces, etc. are  </s>
<s> secondary to how data is used in the industry.  </s>
<s> Having a resolver to get at a particular piece of information should not be a huge barrier to the LSID specification's adoption.  </s>
<s> Case in point, IBM's implementation of LSID utilizes a COM plugin to allow users to perform LSID queries from a web browser.  </s>

<s> | I am not sure how to answer this ultimate question.  </s>
<s> Perhaps I need to | understand more about HTTP URIs in order to give comparison with the URN | used in LSID spec.  </s>
<s> To be honest I have tried to find more and I gave up | after reading very nice article about HTTP URIs by Tim Berners-Lee | (http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/HTTP-URI.html) that gave me feeling that I | am out of the league :-( I am by no means an expert on this either :) How URIs are used in the web architecture and the semantic web architecture are contentious issues to say the least.  </s>
<s> Given the importance of standardisation for the life sciences e.g. MAGE, I am simply trying to understand how identifier schemes such as LSID fit into the current thinking about the semantic web and URIs.  </s>
<s> |I think the question is mainly why reinvent a wheel that already exixts.  </s>
<s> Precisely.  </s>
<s> |Using persistent HTTP URIs is a good goal because it is standard and there |exists a lot of HTTP based applications e.g. browsers that understand HTTP |URIs and can provide information of the resource on the Web without |anything extra.  </s>
<s> This is the exactly the context in which I was trying to raise the issue of using LSIDs in RDF.  </s>
<s> Technically speaking there is nothing wrong with the current LSID specification IMO.  </s>
<s> However if I want to allow other users to dereference LSIDs that my authority mints, it requires me to maintain an LSID resolver.  </s>
<s> Clients must also have the necessary libraries to dereference the LSID.  </s>
<s> Having this infrastructure in place adds a practical burden to using LSIDs which would go away if LSIDs were to be specified in terms of HTTP URIs.  </s>
<s> Which, if we assume persistence is an organisational issue, then HTTP URIs are just as good as URNs.  </s>
<s> While the RDF spec says nothing about URIs being dereferenced to provide representations, my practical expectation is that they should i.e. it makes that resource more useful if I can get either a representation of that resource or metadata about that resource.  </s>
<s> The LSID does specify interfaces for retrieving metadata about a LSID which is a good thing.  </s>
<s> However I'll leave the "how to get metadata about a resource" question for later...  </s>
<s> This leads of course to the thorny issue of whether HTTP URIs are names or locations or both.  </s>
<s> My simple view on this is that a HTTP URI is a name in the same sense that the LSIDs are names, however it *may* also be dereferenced to provide a representation of the resource that it is naming (using the existing web infrastructure).  </s>
<s> |When somebody defines a URN they can usually as well reserve a HTTP URI |e.g. http://www.lsid.org/ and define URIs under it e.g. |http://www.lsid.org/path.../enzyme1.  </s>
<s> This maybe one possible solution, however the LSID spec says nothing about this.  </s>
<s> |Why we are now ALSO discussing of using UUID URNs is because we have |problems with local file: type URIs (file: URIs e.g. file//marja/myfile123) |and we want to make them unambiguous when a user cannot do HTTP URIs maybe |because a user does not own a http:// domain name where to publish it or |for some other reason.  </s>
<s> I can see this as an issue for individuals creating local stores of annotated bookmarks.  </s>
<s> In the case of the life sciences it would be easier to control as any authority using HTTP URI based LSIDs would need to have a http:// domain name to participate.  </s>
<s> |After publishing we mostly want to use the HTTP URIs to be able to benefit |from the common Web standards.  </s>
<s> But it is also possible for some application |to benefit from the URN bit of the information when so wished.  </s>
<s> Maybe there is a best of both worlds approach ?  </s>

<s> Greg |By encoding things with URI's we do not guard against the Greg fact that the |underlying data may change.  </s>
<s> Greg Why do we need to guard against the underlying data changing ?  </s>
<s> This is one of the main issues in the use of identifiers in bioinformatics.  </s>
<s> They identify two things: a specific data set, such as a sequence; and the biological entity.  </s>
<s> The former is less stable than the latter.  </s>
<s> A lot of databases have identifiers, which do not change (very frequently) and accessions (which change when the data is updated).  </s>
<s> If you can't cope with versions then you have to keep every past version of the database around or URL's will become out of date.  </s>
<s> Or you apply some new semantics.  </s>
<s> This has happened on the web.  </s>

<s> GT Again, a life sciences identifier scheme that is not part of the web GT is less useful to me.  </s>

<s> I don't see it like that at all.  </s>
<s> To be really useful LSID's need to become part of the web too.  </s>
<s> I have reached the point where I see no difference as a user.  </s>
<s> We quite happily place LSID's in anchor links right into HTML ( A SRC="lsidres:urn:lsid:pdb.org:pdb:1AFT" Check out this protein!  </s>
<s> /A ) - once you install the LSID resolution protocol handler for IE you can "surf the data web" quite happily as a human - the main difference is that your software can too.  </s>
<s> See http://lsid.limnology.wisc.edu/ for an example of where Dan Smith implemented this and picture of an application running in IE that uses the stack.  </s>
<s> Using the client side protocol stack is not any different to using "GET" or some other such utility you would use to download something via HTTP.  </s>
<s> It is good to be able to click on a link and know that the underlying data stack can be safely left to find you a copy of the object you seek, from potentially multiple sources/over multiple protocols.  </s>
<s> Additionally, having a formal method for the accessing of meta-data allows for more sophisticated interaction with the provider of the data, for example for programmatic negotiation of format/semantic type or perhaps the automated discovery of the latest version of an object, given an earlier version (or any other related LSID) as a starting point.  </s>
<s> GT If my "agent" is to add this hypothesis to it's KB, I might instruct GT it to find more information about the processes involved (assuming I GT don't already have this knowledge).  </s>
<s> If the GO terms and GIs were HTTP GT URIs I can dereference them to (hopefully) retrieve some useful GT information about those resources.  </s>
<s> However with LSID I must have the GT necessary infrastructure in place (resolvers, clients etc.).  </s>
<s> We do exactly this in some of the systems we are currently building.  </s>
<s> Various authorities might well build up a lists of definitions for formats, semantic types etc and provide LSID's for them (e.g. urn:lsid:i3c.org:predicates:storedAs  </s>
<s> or urn:lsid:i3c.org:formats:pdb)that are shared widely - this greatly enhances interoperabilty btw.  </s>
<s> Dereferencing on one of these results in a web page which might list (in human readable) exactly what is meant by a concept, a specification of the format, or a list of links to software that can be used for processing that information.  </s>
<s> Additionally this information might be stored as meta-data for that LSID, allowing automated programmatic access to the same/additional data.  </s>
<s> GT You will not be able to "technically" insure two URIs are not pointing GT at the same object using LSID or HTTP URIs IMO.  </s>
<s> Also if LSIDs are GT going to be use to identify "concepts", what is to say that two GT authorities will have LSIDs for the concept p53 ?  </s>
<s> This is especially GT important considering their use in RDF to identify "resources".  </s>
<s> The object may be in multiple places, but the LSID can be the same.  </s>
<s> If the name is the same, it is the same object - it does not matter where the various copies are stored.  </s>
<s> Of course it is better if two authorities use the _same_ LSID for p53 but if they do not, someone else may do it for them by creating a triple that says something like urn:lsid:pdb.org:pdb:p53  </s>
<s> lsid:i3c.org:predicates:sameAs  </s>
<s> lsid:anotherauth.com:proteins:p53  </s>
<s> As you can see, third parties may quite happily use another authorities lsid to say something of their own about the data stored by our original two authorities for concept p53.  </s>
