At the risk of stating the obvious (or what I assume to be the obvious) could it be made clear in title of the next WD for the following documents, that they apply to XQuery 1.0 and XPath 2.0? 
Assuming that is, in fact, the case. 
Corresponding mention of version numbers might also be useful somewhere in the introductory text of each document too. 
Andrew Watt It's not the case. 
This work is proceeding on a separate timescale from XQuery 1.0 and XPath 2.0. 
The idea is to integrate it when it is ready, which will almost certainly be after XQuery 1.0.

I used the term "apply to" not "are part of". 
In my (casual?) approach the unqualified term "XPath" refers to XPath 1.0. 
In the WG's casual approach is something different intended by the unqualified term XPath? 
Presumably it is. 
Am I correct in assuming that the full-text search material does *not*, for example, apply to XPath 1.0 and is not usable with XPath 1.0? 
Should that not be made clearer? 
Andrew Watt XPath 1.0 is already published. 
It can't be changed. 
It does not include full text search. 
XPath 2.0 will probably be published well before full text search is added.
