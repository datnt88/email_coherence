We really really really need to move RFC 2279 to full standard. 
Any takers on looking at this?

Yes.

Good. 
I am happy you are interested in doing this work. 
I have a couple of other people which told me they could help aswell. 
I presume you are ok with taking the token here. 
Martin D?erst and myself talked over the phone the other day, and he let me know he had a list of things he would like to have changed in the document, so a new I-D seems to be needed. 
Discussion(s) about this is suggested to be on the ietf-charsets@iana.org 
mailing list (cc:ed on this message).
