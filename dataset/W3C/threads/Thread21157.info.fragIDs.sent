<s> Hi, Thanks to all the excellent human beings working on Amaya!  </s>
<s> Can someone explain to me what amaya is and is not.  </s>
<s> I am looking for a good stylesheets editor and as a browser, amaya does not accurately display w3c pages like  </s>
<s> I would like my pages to look like the old page that seems to have been there until yesterday.  </s>
<s> Can amaya create these pages which it cannot display or am I missing something?  </s>
<s> I have read the amaya manual  </s>
<s> and am half way through the Hakon Wium Lie/Bert Bos book but am unclear about amaya.  </s>

<s> I answered a similar question last week.  </s>
<s> Please refer to  </s>
<s> This page uses a lot of advanced features of CSS.  </s>
<s> Many of these features are not yet implemented in Amaya, such as absolute positionning, float and list-style.  </s>
<s> Amaya did a better job with the default style sheets that were used until yesterday (Blue shadows).  </s>
<s> But I guess this is the purpose of the style sheets used on the Style area of the W3C server: to demonstrate what CSS can do, and to stimulate browser developpers.  </s>
<s> Some recent progress has been made in Amaya to render these pages better.  </s>
<s> The Gold style used by default now will set a new target for future releases of Amaya.  </s>
<s> You can certainly use Amaya to create such HTML pages.  </s>
<s> If you look at these pages without any style sheet (or with the Handheld style), or if you just check the source code, you will see that they are pretty simple.  </s>
<s> The secret is in the many class attributes they use to refer to style properties defined in style sheets.  </s>
<s> You can perfectly use Amaya to create XHTML pages, to link the style sheets you like to these pages (command Style/Link...), and to put the right class (command Style/Apply class...) on the XHTML elements.  </s>
<s> You have some info in the on-line Help pages.  </s>
<s> There is a FAQ: You can also check:  </s>
<s> I guess most people at W3C just use a plain text editor and create their style sheets by hand.  </s>
<s> But you can also check:  </s>

<s> Well, I am just one person at W3C, and I don't make a lot of web pages (fewer than I used to).  </s>
<s> I use Amaya for almost all my stylesheet editing, because I like to do it by example.  </s>
<s> This means that I have to live without positioning for the moment, or to do it manually, and that I have to copy my stylesheet to an external one.  </s>
