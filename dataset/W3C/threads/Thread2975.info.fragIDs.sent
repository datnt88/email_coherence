<s> There is an HTTP-related security violation approach found/researched by White Hat Security: PR: http://www.whitehatsec.com/press_releases/WH-PR-20030120.txt  </s>
<s> Details: http://www.betanews.com/whitehat/WH-WhitePaper_XST_ebook.pdf  </s>
<s> I bet many of you have seen the related advisories/PR.  </s>
<s> For those who have not, here is the gist: Modern browsers usually do not allow scripts embedded in HTML to access cookies and authentication information exchanged between HTTP client and server.  </s>
<s> However, a script can get access to that info by sending a simple HTTP TRACE request to the originating (innocent) server.  </s>
<s> The user agent will auto-include current authentication info in such request.  </s>
<s> The server will echo all the authentication information back, for script to read and [mis]use.  </s>
<s> Apparently, sending an HTTP request is possible via many scripting methods like ActiveX.  </s>
<s> See the URL above for details.  </s>
<s> With numerous XSS (cross-site-scripting) vulnerabilities in user agents, this seems like a real and nasty problem.  </s>
<s> TRACE method support is optional per RFC 2616, but many popular servers support it.  </s>
<s> White Hat Security advises server administrators to disable support for TRACE.  </s>
<s> What is your opinion?  </s>
<s> Should TRACE be supported by default?  </s>
<s> Is it a good idea to mention this "exposure" vulnerability in HTTP errata or elsewhere?  </s>
<s> Thanks, Alex.  </s>

<s> Hmm. Maybe one could exclude sensitive header such as Authorization, Cookie and Proxy-Authorization from TRACE responses.  </s>
<s> After all, 2616, ch. 9.8 says that the complete request SHOULD be send back.  </s>
<s> So, it's not a MUST and implementation might have a good reason for not doing so.  </s>
<s> Making life harder for such exploits seems like a good idea and it would allow to keep TRACE in the server.  </s>
<s> On the other hand - as it is stated also in the report - there is no protection against XSS-enabled clients.  </s>

<s> Alex Rousskov:  </s>
<s> The entire value of TRACE lies in it being an exact copy; otherwise it's pretty worthless as a debugging mechanism.  </s>
<s> This exploit does not expose any user or application that is not already sending authentication credentials in clear over the net.  </s>
<s> Digest Authentication already solves this problem, and provides the session tracking (via the server nonce) that applications want as well, without exposing anything either on the net or to XSS clients.  </s>
<s> Trying to repair this "new" problem by changing TRACE is like fixing an abdominal bullet wound with a Band-Aid.  </s>
