This is a request for a formal URN namespace per section 4.0 III of RFC 2611. 
File attached as  urn-geo.txt  . 
After playing around with a lot of coordinates etc., I wondered if there were any URI schemes or URN namespaces that would let me refer to them on the WWW. 
After some seraching I couldn't actually find any, although I wouldn't be suprised if someone has already proposed/registered such a scheme. 
I remember Larry referening a paper by Michael Gorlick [1] which is about the closest thing to this that I could find, although that proposes domain names rather than URNs. 
Anyway, comments are most welcome.

There's actually been quite a bit of activity in IETF on spatial location designations of all sorts, beyond the one reference I gave before: BOF &amp; pointer to its mail archives: Newly chartered IETF working group: including Internet draft for initial requirements The working group and discussions around it have had quite a focus on the privacy issues surrounding protocols that might trade geographic information about the devices (and thus users) at the endpoints. 
Note that the geopriv charter says: the working group will select an already standardized format to recommend for use in representing location per se" so the assumption is that there are other (non-IETF) standards that the IETF group will make reference too. 
I wouldn't want to see the "geo" URN scheme choose a different representation than the geopriv working group, at least without some analysis and justification. 
Larry I'm pretty sure that altitude is undefined without specifying what model you are using for the shape of the zero altitude surface. 
Latitude could show similar effects. 
The documents of the Open GIS Consortium might help, here.
