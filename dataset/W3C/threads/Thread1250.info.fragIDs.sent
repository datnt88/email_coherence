<s> Hello, I have two questions about GB* simplified-Chinese charsets: 1.  </s>
<s> There are two entries for GB 2312: 1.a) Name: GB_2312-80 [RFC1345,KXS2] MIBenum: 57 Source: ECMA registry Alias: iso-ir-58 Alias: chinese Alias: csISO58GB231280 1.b) Name: GB2312 (preferred MIME name) MIBenum: 2025 Source: Chinese for People's Republic of China (PRC) mixed one byte, two byte set: 20-7E = one byte ASCII A1-FE = two byte PRC Kanji See GB 2312-80 PCL Symbol Set Id: 18C Alias: csGB2312 How are they different?  </s>
<s> The second one is clearly the commonly used MBCS charset.  </s>
<s> Is the first one the DBCS-only part for ISO 2022, or is it also MBCS?  </s>
<s> Please clarify.  </s>
<s> 2. I cannot find a registration for GBK (Microsoft 936).  </s>
<s> Am I just missing it?  </s>
<s> markus  </s>
<s> Markus, I believe you are not missing GBK -- IANA is.  </s>
<s> In the work I did to enable the Oracle XML Parser for a large list of charsets, I have also found the following charsets are missing from IANA.  </s>
<s> A brief check today indicates that these are still missing, but I could have missed something.  </s>
<s> EUC-TW ISO2022CN-CNS ISO2022CN-GB MS874 MS932 MS936 MS949 MS950 ISCII GB18030 Additionally, missing from IANA registry were a large number of IBM code pages (CPXXX, CPXXXX, CPXXXXX).  </s>
<s> I can send these to you or the IETF list upon request, but I'm hesitant to litter just yet.  </s>
<s> I apologize that I have not yet had time to file RFCs for the addition of all of these charsets.  </s>
<s> Just the same, should someone else like to file these as RFCs, please don't wait for me.  </s>
<s> Thanks, Craig R. Cummings Java NLS Architect Oracle Corporation  </s>
<s> Please clarify.  </s>
<s> query:  </s>
<s> are all these charset names you have seen used "in the wild" where MIME charset names should be used, or are they charsets that you know about  </s>
<s> which are used in some context, and you think there should be registered names for them?  </s>
<s> this will have most influence on the "intended usage" section.... --On 22. august 2001 11:21 -0700 "Craig R. Cummings"  </s>
<s> no RFC required, just a charset registration procedure :-)  </s>
<s> The one I am concerned about, GBK, is the same as Windows codepage 936 (simplified chinese).  </s>
<s> It is the default codepage on Windows in China, and it was the latest specification (though not "standard") from China.  </s>
<s> It is in widespread use elsewhere, and I assumed that it is also in use in chinese email, by virtue of market penetration.  </s>
<s> Repeat: "I assumed" - and I expected to find it in the IANA charset names list, but it's not there.  </s>
<s> However, I do not have direct evidence of its use in email (or in other MIME charset places).  </s>
<s> I just looked at my Outlook Express, and it offers two encodings for Simplified Chinese: GB 2312 and HZ, _not_ GBK.  </s>
<s> OE does use IANA names for these two, I just tried it.  </s>
<s> (It would not surprise me if OE mislabeled GBK as GB 2312, but again I do not have any evidence for it.) So, maybe this is not an issue.  </s>
<s> I am more on a "fact-finding mission" with my questions than trying to register new-old things.  </s>
<s> I would rather not register what's not used so that people don't get the idea to use it :-) markus  </s>
<s> One really can't prove the negative about finding something in the wild, but here is a data point.  </s>
<s> Of all the mail archives that IMC and VPNC keep, the following is what appears as explicit charsets given in content-type lines (with a count of how many times): big5: 20 default: 3 euc-kr: 40 gb2312: 61 iso-2022-jp: 303 iso-2022-kr: 9 iso-8859-1: 4817 iso-8859-15: 3 iso-8859-2: 39 iso-8859-7: 8 iso-8859-8: 4 iso-8859-9: 3 koi8-r: 142 ks_c_5601-1987: 1 standard: 2 unknown-8bit: 62 us-acsii: 4 us-ascii: 51491 utf-16be: 1 utf-7: 2 utf-8: 73 windows-1251: 12 windows-1252: 11 windows-1255: 2 windows-1257: 4 x-roman8: 1 x-unicode-2-0-utf-7: 1 x-unknown: 25 x-user-defined: 5 --Paul Hoffman, Director --Internet Mail Consortium  </s>
<s> The first was very clearly intended as the DBCS-only part.  </s>
<s> I'm not sure it's used at all, but then transmitting DBCS- only data is rather rare anyway.  </s>
<s> Most registrations that have iso-ir-xxx as alias are in a very similar situation (of course some of them are single- byte, but still only half of an actual 8-bit 'charset').  </s>
<s> In the case of Korean, the situation is unfortunately a bit more complicated in practice; please see the thread starting at for details.  </s>
<s> If you think something is missing that you need, please submit a registration.  </s>
<s> Regards, Martin.  </s>
