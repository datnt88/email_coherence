Hello all... 
I have run into a problem with Netscape 4.x and some earlier versions of IE... The following is the server info being generated by me telnet www1 8050 Trying 208............ Connected to www1....... Escape character is '^]'. 
GET /...... HTTP/1.0 Accept-Encoding: gzip HTTP/1.1 200 OK Date: Thu, 07 Sep 2000 03:09:40 GMT Server: Apache/1.3.12 (Unix) PHP/4.0.2 mod_ssl/2.6.4 OpenSSL/0.9.5a X-Powered-By: PHP/4.0.2 Expires: Fri, 08 Sep 2000 03:09:43 GMT Content-Encoding: gzip Connection: close Content-Type: application/x-javascript When I use Netscape to retrieve this same file, I get errors about unrecognized characters in javascript... it isnt decoding the gzip and the js interpreter is decoding binary. 
However, if I remove the Content-Type: application/x-javascript header, netscape does decode the gzip and display the file. 
In order for me to use this as a SRCed js file I NEED the Content-Type: application/x-javascript header. 
Is there a header that is missing?? 
Does anyone know a workaround?? Essentially, i need to be able to send a gzip encoded javascript file and have it interpretted.. 
This does work fine with IE 5. Is it just another example of NS 4 blatant disregard for standards?? 
Or am I reading the standard wrong and encodings of types other than html are not allowed? 
Thank you Joe FYI.... Please begin using my new email address joelink@joelink.net 
joelink@niu.edu will be phased out by Jan 1st 2001 Thank you Sounds like a bug in NS. 
I wouldn't say that IE is any better or worse; IIRC IE advertises that it can do deflate, but doesn't support it correctly (if anyone can demonstrate that it can, pls tell me - I'd love to get it to work). 
Cheers, Mark Nottingham I can think of a workaround on the client side, but it needs Java: use some uncompressed JavaScript that calls into Java to fetch the compressed file, then uses eval() to execute it.
