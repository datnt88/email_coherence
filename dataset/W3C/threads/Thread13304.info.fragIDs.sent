<s> I think we should very well explain to the public why these guys are wrong: To make a long story short, they claim that real validators are bad because they find errors that other "validators" let them get away with.  </s>
<s> They say its bad because "both" Netscape and explorer "support" these errors (invalid nestings, not escaped ampresands in URLs, unquoted attributes etc.).  </s>
<s> The bottom line is that they recommend using mediocre checkers and not to use validators.  </s>

<s> Yes, it's true that the validator shouldn't be criticized for being "overly strict", but there's another point they also make, that the error messages are cryptic: When tag attributes aren't surrounded by quotes, W3C reports "An attribute value must be a literal unless it contains only name characters." Ampersands in URLs (technically a no-no, though quite common) are met with cryptic "General entity not defined" reports.  </s>

<s> Len" There are two thing here.  </s>
<s> 1. Messages are unclear.  </s>
<s> Check the WDG validator [1], it gives better message for both missing quotes and undefined entities.  </s>
<s> It uses nsgmls like W3C and WebTechs.  </s>
<s> So these two features (strictness and lack of clarity) are logically indepent.  </s>
<s> A possible next step for WAI / W3C is to compose friendly messages and allow the user to choose between nsmgls messages and friendly one's.  </s>
<s> 2. They claim that it is technically invalid (a no-no) to write ampersands in URLs but there is no choice (quite common), and they congratulate WebTechs for allowing this (in a sentence that Len didn't quote).  </s>
<s> This is wrong.  </s>
<s> ampersands in URLs are allowed but they must be escaped.  </s>
<s> Escaped ampersands in attribute values including URLs are widely supported by browsers.  </s>
<s> The behavior of webtechs that allows authors to get away with errors is criticized by many including Liam Quinn and Alan Flavell.  </s>
<s> (I appologize for not giving reference) They also complain that the validator errs when it flags an error "element P not allowed here" where here is as a child of TABLE.  </s>
<s> This error in the HTML actually exists on the very page of the survey [2] They should actually criticize the other "validators" for not finding this serious syntax error.  </s>
