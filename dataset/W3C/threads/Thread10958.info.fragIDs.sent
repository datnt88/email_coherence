<s> You stress that your query is purely for information and that private replies are fine, but since I can't imagine anyone not being fascinated by character-set issues, I'll reply to the list ... BaseChar is, very very roughly, the set of letters without diacritics, or, more precisely -- but not *wholly* precisely since I don't have the Unicode manual at home and have not memorized its terminology of character classification --, the set of alphabetics minus the set of combining forms.  </s>
<s> (Since the set subtraction was done by hand rather than by dbms manipulation of the Unicode data file, it needs checking.  </s>
<s> But the intent was Alpha \ Combining.) So 3 BaseChar excludes several things included in 2 Character: (a) punctuation, (b) numerals both decimal and others -- it's startling to realize Unicode has two sets of 'characters' devoted to Roman numerals in upper and lower case (looks like a serious case of legacy compatibility, but what legacy system has characters for i, ii, iii, iv, v, ...?), (c) ideographs, (d) combining characters, (e) various special-purpose things one can read about in the Unicode book, (f) code points unassigned in the current version of ISO 10646/Unicode, and (g) other stuff I have surely forgotten.  </s>
<s> A correct SGML declaration for XML ought to use the extended naming rules to specify name characters and name-start characters; it should also assign case properly to those characters which have case.  </s>
<s> (Bleagh.) There may be a canned declaration with the desired effect already in existence; I don't know.  </s>
<s> The one in the version of 14 November is, as has been pointed out variously, in error, since it declares ASCII, not 10646, as the document character set.  </s>
<s> (It got included because it was the one which actually worked on Jon's machine, but that was because he has an ASCII machine rather than a Unicode machine.)  </s>
<s> What an SGML declaration should do about the unassigned code points, I don't know.  </s>
<s> Is this where, after all this time, I actually get to (? have to?) learn what NONSGML and SHUNCHAR are supposed to mean?  </s>
<s> If anyone with an interest in Unicode is willing to confirm that my translation of the Unicode recommendations for identifier formation into SGML terms actually makes sense, I'd be very glad.  </s>
<s> In particular, I changed the way combining characters were used, in a way which may be harmless, but which won't be harmless if combining characters really have to be legal in identifiers after digits and other characters not in BaseChar.  </s>
<s> While I'm on this general topic, may I ask anyone still reading this if you can recommend a good description of the character encoding model which I gather WG8 has now formulated and accepted?  </s>
<s> I hear people saying things about the SGML character-set declarations (e.g. that they have nothing to do with the way characters are represented in the document being parsed) which I don't believe I ever read in 8879, and I'd like a chance to catch up.  </s>
<s> I've looked on the WG8 server and Charles Goldfarb's server, without seeing anything that looked promising.  </s>
<s> Can anyone help me out on this?  </s>
<s> Many thanks.  </s>

<s> Don't sweat SHUNCHAR; it doesn't really make sense--definitely doesn't make sense in the new model.  </s>
<s> I predict it'll disappear.  </s>
<s> NONSGML applies to character numbers (the numerals that occur within numeric character references), not characters.  </s>
<s> Non-SGML character numbers are those that are marked UNUSED in the document character set parameter of the SGML declaration.  </s>
<s> They may be used in numeric character references, but what character they represent must be communicated to the system using some system-dependent means outside of the document.  </s>
<s> See my paper "The SGML Character Model", in the SGML '96 Conference Proceedings, pp 681ff.  </s>
<s> Basically: The point of view to take is that an SGML parser is, in the abstract, processing a stream of abstract characters--which are of necessity represented somehow in a computer system, but SGML does not prescribe how they must be represented.  </s>
<s> The document character set maps abstract characters to integers so that the parser will know what character intended by a numeric character reference.  </s>
<s> In the process, the characters to which numbers are assigned become "SGML characters", the characters that are permitted in the document.  </s>
<s> Other numbers are specified non-SGML; they can be used in numeric character references but what character they represent is not described in the document.  </s>
<s> The document character set *may* describe the representation of characters at the interface of the entity manager and parser--or they may use some other representation (possibly hard-wired).  </s>
<s> There are pros and cons to both implementation strategies.  </s>
<s> The document character set *may* also describe the storage representation used to store the data from which entities are assembled by the entity manager.  </s>
<s> Or the entity manager may be told by the storage system how it is representing characters.  </s>
<s> Not-to-smart entity managers may not be able to handle more than one storage representation, or may not be able to handle a representation other than that defined by the document character set.  </s>
