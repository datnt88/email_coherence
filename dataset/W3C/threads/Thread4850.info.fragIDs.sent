<s> I'm mostly happy to let the structure of use cases emerge as discussion progresses, but I'd like to nip this naming convention involving people's initials in the bud.  </s>
<s> Please pick names/identifiers that are real-life words that would be reasonably meaningful to somebody who's new to the WG. Yes, it's harder, but coming to agreement on terms is the game we're here to play.  </s>
<s> Use of opaque codewords like XY-23 can lead to inter-group  </s>
<s> efficiencies, but it creates a barrier around the group; it makes it expensive for new people to figure out what we're all talking about.  </s>
<s> Also, naming use cases (and issues and so on) after people is counter the goal of group consensus/endorsement/ownership.  </s>
<s> Each of us should feel free to criticize a use case without giving any signal of attacking a person whatsoever.  </s>

<s> intra-group, rather.  </s>
<s> sigh.  </s>
<s> should have stuck to plain english: ... can allow members of the group to type fewer characters when sending mail to other members of the group...  </s>

<s> 1. I'm taking this as a request for those of us who have submitted use cases to propose new, mnemmonic names for them.  </s>
<s> Yes?  </s>
<s> 2. At what point will we begin to gather these use cases in a public document, similar to the RDF Core issues list?  </s>
<s> So that refs and concensus can be thus focused.  </s>

<s> Well, no, don't double the traffic just to eliminate the initials.  </s>
<s> But please don't rely on the XX-23 names.  </s>
<s> If you use them, include a few other subject words too.  </s>
<s> i.e. don't just say AS-1.  </s>
<s> Say: find stuff about John Smith (AFS-1).  </s>
<s> When we've got at least 2 or 3 that pretty much everybody likes.  </s>
<s> Right now, we have about 72 proposals with varying level of endorsement and criticism.  </s>
<s> We looked at a handful in the telcon and assigned actions; I'd like to see discussion of those cases mature.  </s>
<s> Anybody is welcome to try to do some gathering, but at this early point, there's no guarantee that it'll become the basis of the group's work going forward.  </s>
<s> A recommendation to anybody who tries it: don't try to be exhuastive.  </s>
<s> Pick a few good ones, not all of the ones that have been proposed.  </s>
