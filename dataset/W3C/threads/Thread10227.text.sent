Hmm... note that it does say "indicates *the* resource defining the subject resource" [emphasis added], which seems to imply that you can only specify a single rdfs:isDefinedBy property for a resource. 
Might be worth an rdf-comments mail, but I reckon it's a typo (should be "a resource"). 
It's surely a typo. 
One can have multiple rdfs:isDefinedBy values, where each provide a component of the definition (e.g. just one example, separate RDF Schemas that define labels and comments for particular languages, where a given term then has definition in as many schemas as there are languages defined. 
I'll ping the editor on this. 
This may have already been caught, but I consider this to be a critical error that must be fixed before last call. 
Cheers, Patrick Since Danbri hasn't responded, let me stick in a few words here: ... Hmm... note that it does say "indicates *the* resource defining the subject resource" [emphasis added], which seems to imply that you can only specify a single rdfs:isDefinedBy property for a resource.

Hmm, I can't find the text you complain of in the last call candidate. 
Brian It's surely a typo.

Brian It appears it has already been fixed. 
Great.

Yup, the offending text has gone. 
Sadly imho but shrug/ I'll use regex string hacking to split property URIs into namespace and name instead. 
So this shouldn't be an issue any more.
