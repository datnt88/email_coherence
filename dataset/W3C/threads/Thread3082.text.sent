There is a major difference between the entailment relation a expressed by the = sign in cwm and the diff:replacement, which I think indicates a big conceptual difference between these two methods. 
In any theory you can consistently have any number of entailment relations with the same antecedent. 
So The cat is on the mat = the mat is under the cat The cat is on the mat = the cat is happy could be consistently held to be true. 
On the other hand: The cat is on the mat {The cat is on the mat} diff:replace { The cat is on the table } {The cat is on the mat} diff:replace { The cat is on grass } Assuming we have somehow limited ourselves to describing the same point in time, the above cannot be consistently held. 
One has to make a choice, between the diff replacements holds. 
A cat cannot be at two places at once. 
Yet each one of the two statements by itself is a valid application of the diff:replace relation. 
I think part of the reason for this is that implication is a relation within first order logic, whereas diff:replace is a relation between theories. 
Implication preserves truth conditions, whereas diff:replace changes them. 
diff:replace is a mapping between theories. 
It says: the second theory can be reached by changing the first theory in this way. 
As an image I think the following will help (if file attachments are allowed on this list) This represents a file containing two diff:replace statements, concerning the same objects. 
Each diff replacement maps to a different and incompatible theory. 
Before continuing let me check that this mailing list accepts image attachments. 
Henry I think diff:replace moves us into the domain of modal logic, as explained for example by David Lewis in his book Counterfactuals. 
The problem with a replacement of a fact is that you can rarely just replace on fact in a theory. 
Replacing a fact entails all kinds of other changes. 
So consider: If I had not paid my bill I would have been in trouble. 
The actual world here is the one where I do pay my bill. 
We are asked in the actual world to consider what would have happened had I not paid my bill. 
we are doing something like {pay my bill} diff:replace {} But the world where I don't pay my bill, is also a world where I have more money, where I could have spent money that evening, that might have allowed me to meet someone who could have changed my life, etc. etc. 
These are all points made by David Lewis in the introduction to his book. 
A little pause. 
Henry looking at I would say it does, just that the letters are a bit small to read :) Jos De Roo, AGFA http://www.agfa.com/w3c/jdroo/ 
Just before anyone points out that the title may be a little exaggerated, I'll say so myself. 
:-) Hopefully the previous posts help reveal what is behind diff:replace so that one can use it appropriately.
