<s> Good capture Dave, I think that almost every method of posting has its problems.  </s>
<s> I'm interleaving my comments below your summary points marked with poehlman I've changed the subject, since it appears that top posting impacts sighted users as well.  </s>
<s> My view of a summary.  </s>
<s> 1. top posting can greatly increase volume, and some users still pay for bandwidth.  </s>
<s> poehlman While true, it is not more or less volume producing than other untrimmed posting.  </s>
<s> 2. Replying in context.  </s>
<s> If an email has multiple topics which you want to answer individually, then top posting may make it harder.  </s>
<s> This is obviously far more of a problem in long emails than in brief ones.  </s>
<s> poehlman If you write your messages in other than your email client, good writing solves this.  </s>
<s> In fact, it can even make the necessity of quoting go away.  </s>
<s> Other response methods have their down sides.  </s>
<s> 3. Inferred semantics.  </s>
<s> Determining who said what.  </s>
<s> Interleaved comments to me give some intimation that the text with 5 right angle brackets is getting pretty old by now, the text with no indentation is recent.  </s>
<s> Handled variably by various email clients.  </s>
<s> I've seen one who has the initials of the poster instead of the angle brackets.  </s>
<s> poehlman Pine provides a lot of flexibility on this and I wish other email programs provided this an come to think of it, if I choose to with outlook express, I can use my initials or whatever I want but I think the quoted text then is indented and I choose not to have it marked or indented mostly because when I top post, there is a clear devision between what I post and what I am responding to.  </s>
<s> I hate             or: even more since in the first instance, I will hear three at most and in the latter I will hear each one because they are spaced.  </s>
<s> 4. Line wrap.  </s>
<s> Unsure if this is just visual or not, but I wholly agree its a pain to untangle the line wrap when replies are preceeded by the angle brackets.  </s>
<s> Does it mess up interpretation for screen reader users too?  </s>
<s> poehlman You bet at least where flow is concerned breaking a sentance.  </s>
<s> It doesn't usually break words, but it can.  </s>
<s> It will also break long urls or email addresses which can be a pain to recover. 5. Navigation.  </s>
<s> If navigation is not easy for whatever reason, top posting in other than simple messages isn't easy.  </s>
<s> poehlman I'm not sure why.  </s>
<s> I find it much easier to navigate a top posted message than one which has been chopped and smattered with information both new and old like this one is and will be.  </s>
<s> I probably won't even read this one when it comes back.  </s>
<s> The biggest problem with long messages with comments inserted is that often, the portion following the final response is left in tact forcing one to search through it for more comments only to find that there are none.  </s>
<s> 6. Tool restrictions.  </s>
<s> If your email tool is line based, top posting is easy for you, interleaving isn't.  </s>
<s> poehlman I'm not sure what a line based email client is, but my  </s>
<s> orientation is line gased so even though I may not have a line based email client per se, It works out to be about the same in that I have to search for insertion points in order to interleave and that takes time.  </s>
<s> 7. It could be that long complex emails need treating differently than brief answers, but surely there must be some benefit in a consistant approach.  </s>
<s> poehlman I guess this true of anything in written form, I would opt though for a set of consistant approach that as broadly as possible fit the needs of senarios.  </s>
<s> I've gotten used to most of the styles out there and it is seldom that I see anything I can't figure out if I work at it.  </s>
<s> 8. Be considerate of time lag.  </s>
<s> If your reader isn't going to read your post near the time of others, then top posting is harder to comprehend without the context of interleaved posts.  </s>
<s> poehlman This can be a factor, but it depends too on which email you read first.  </s>
<s> There are some merits on the judgement that it is harder to deal with top posting if you come in on the middle of a thread for one reason or another and I can understand this though in many systems, you will know by the "re:" in the subject line of the message that you are in the midst of a thread and some clients can thread for you or you can read threads in some archives.  </s>
<s> This of course does not totally mittigate the issue, but I know of no effective balance.  </s>
<s> 9. I liked Charles keep the language clear.  </s>
<s> Possibly as important as most of the other points.  </s>
<s> poehlman Agreed.  </s>
<s> What did I miss?  </s>
<s> poehlman If you missed anything, It's above unless I missed something too which is quite possible.  </s>
<s> I guess I should mention here though that if I were listening to a broad cast where a discussion was top posted, I might be a bit confused.  </s>

<s> Dave P, In regard to your question of relevance for how old messages are in a message, that is why it is usefull to have the deviders as below.  </s>
<s> They provide a clear break between the posters that I can jump through far more effectively and which is what makes interleaving much more difficult to work with because these devisions are not apparent.  </s>

<s> poehlman said:  </s>
<s> For the record, most command line tools these days are quite capable  </s>
<s> of providing an interactive page based display.  </s>
<s> So being command line driven doesn't imply that it is a line based tool (although I could configure mutt[1] to use ed[2] if I really wanted to).  </s>
<s> Mutt does, however, know how to cope with the traditional quoting style (interleaved with quote levels indicated by greater than signs) very nicely.  </s>
<s> It colour codes each level of quoting, allows the user to skip past the current block of quoted text by typing S and to toggle quoted text on and off with T. These features do, of course, depend on people sticking to the usual style of quoting and are useless when dealing with top posting or id tagged messages.  </s>
<s> A gratuitous screenshot of mutt can be found (for a short while) at http://dorward.me.uk/tmp/mutt.jpeg .  </s>
<s> It features colour coded quoted material and quite large font sizes (yes, I am aware that some people require much larger font sizes).  </s>
<s> Another part of this thread was discussing the difficulty of line lengths and quoted material, especially as regards to reflowing it.  </s>
<s> My editor (mutt calls a user configurable editor rather then depending on any built in functionality), emacs, is quite capable of reflowing quoted text and maintaining the prefixing of each line with a greater than sign without sprinkling the inner content with them.  </s>
<s> In short - when presented with standard quoting techniques, good tools can handle themselves well.  </s>
<s> This includes email software with an aural output - if such software doesn't exist, then it is at least technically possible to write (and something I might have considered looking into for my third year project at university had I thought of it at the time.  </s>

<s> For the record, most command line tools  </s>
