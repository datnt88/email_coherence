<s> First, regrets for tomorrow -- I will be out of the office in the afternoon.  </s>
<s> Secondly, here is another version of 4.1, recast along the lines suggested by Jason and Wendy et al. Lisa and I would like to get some feedback to see if this form is more agreeable (or if we need to be more explicit about making all the criteria testable.)  </s>

<s> Yes, this is in line with what was suggested at the meeting, and a very good draft as well.  </s>
<s> In view of Avi's absence I suggest scheduling a full discussion of 4.1 for the next meeting (in two weeks time).  </s>
<s> Meanwhile, as always, comments and discussion are welcome on the mailing list.  </s>
<s> In my opinion this is exactly what was suggested at the meeting.  </s>
<s> My only comment is a pedantic point (see below).  </s>
<s> We need to decide whether the considerations listed under checkpoint 4.1 should be expressed as questions or statements.  </s>
<s> If they are to be formulated as questions, then there is a problem in as much as it is only implicit that the "right" or "desirable" answer to each of the questions is in the affirmative.  </s>
<s> This difficulty could be remedied by reformulating the preceding text thus: You review the content and determine that questions such as the following are to be answered in the affirmative, and hence that the level of clarity is appropirate: I realize this is more verbose but if the document isn't sufficiently explicit on the point, the door will be left open for disputes over whether the requirement is that an affirmative answer be given to each of the questions in any review.  </s>
<s> Of course, if the "considerations" listed under checkpoint 4.1 are written as statements, the introductory prose can be simpler, as Avi's first-level proposal demonstrates.  </s>
