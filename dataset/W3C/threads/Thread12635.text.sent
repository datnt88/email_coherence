Can anyone provide any information about the use of PHP in coding online applications and what issues with accessibility might arise. 
Specifically, I was wondering if JAWS can read it and if not, what kinds of alternatives might be offered. 
Thanks, Diana Persell Diana, you should consult the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines - have used PHP or some other language, an online application is web content and the same rules apply. 
This is an active work area for the Web Content Accessiblity Guidelines working group, as we look at moving towards a WCAG version 2 - you may like to follow the discussion in that area.

It's a server-side technology to deliver dynamic content over the net. 
Nothing else. 
You must follow exactly the same Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, because the end-target is to deliver HTML. 
We use it heavily, and from our point of view, makes the life of the webmaster easier. 
Although it might have a limited life-span once other Web Publishing Frameworks based on XML, XSL, XSLT and Java mature a little bit.
