<s> Checkpoint 2.7 says "generate repair text" Checkpoint 2.8 says "don't generate the repair text of 2.7 unless I tell you" I don't know why this is specific to images.  </s>
<s> Suppose the user provides an auditory track and no synchronized text equivalent, but the user agent can determine that some other html page is a transcript of the track.  </s>
<s> Then it might give the user access to that transcript (this is a little bit of a stretch, but not much).  </s>
<s> I don't think that 2.8 should be limited to images.  </s>
<s> I do think that we should fix the wording of 2.8 to avoid "author intentionally".  </s>
<s> So we should change "when the author has intentionally provided empty conditional content' to "when the user agent recognizes that the author has failed to provide conditional content that was frequired by the ormat specification."  </s>
