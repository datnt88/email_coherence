Hi folks, 
Carine's notes about compiling for Mac OS at 
i18n support. 
She mentions the libwcs that needs to be added. 
I have made a fink package for that as a temporary measure if anyone wants it. 
(I also fixed a problem that meant the source was not actually available...) I am not publishing it generally because I think the number of requests will be small and it is a dodgy package - it works fine for me, but the documentation is a bit misleading (it claims to be an editor/browser with a whole lot of functions, not a little i18n-related library...) So if you would like to shortcut that step in compiling for OS X feel free to email me for the package. 
(source or binary available...) cheers Chaals 
About compiling 7.1: 
I have compiled amaya (without the i18n trick) 7.1 on OSX 10.1.5 and then updated the page. 
I had tested only with a google search and it was worky, but today I discover it crashes on www.w3.org! 
After testing several sites, it seems to crash when it needs to load a separate CSS stylesheet. 
Any hint to debug this?

If you have gdb available, please send me the stack: gdb ..../GTK/bin/amaya run where quit

Hi Irene, Here is what I got from gdb:

As I sent earlier, the stack said the problem was in GetLocalPath(...). 
I investigated further and read the hacks I did to compile: I added a #include "stdint.h" to have uint64_t defined, but I now realize that the code contain some bits shifting in AM_get_tempname(...). 
Then it may be "just" an endianess problem...

Hi Carine, Thanks for this report. 
I added an extra test to the configure to add the stdint.h 
library if it exists. 
I didn't need to do so under Linux 386. 
All is committed. 
It's not an endianess problem, as the local name is just ... local. 
Your next message does state out the problem, thought.. going there now.
