<s> I am a definite newcomer to this area (having just had RDF be the topic of the week in the final week of an 8-week course on Web Applications, starting from XML in week 1).  </s>
<s> It was a great crutch for digging into something I had kept putting off.  </s>
<s> I feel relieved that I didn't have to work through that particular history around QNames.  </s>
<s> As a neophyte, I have the privilege of noticing things that might have become invisible, so I don't hesitate to speak up.  </s>
<s> As long as I'm here, I thought I'd point out some things in the new working documents that I found very valuable and useful to me as a newcomer level.  </s>
<s> [Oops, this is not the discussion list that I thought it was.  </s>
<s> Oh well, onward ...] 1.The many primer statements cautioning against overgeneralization from what something signifies to us to what the machine is informed of is extremely valuable.  </s>
<s> I find great mischief in the popular overloading of "meaning," even moreso than the over-working of "intelligence."  </s>
<s> I am heartened by the effort to be clear about the difference between preserving meaning/interpretation and defining meaning in some colloquial sense.  </s>
<s> 2.The formal semantics work is very helpful, especially the model-theoretic approach.  </s>
<s> I don't get all of it, by any means.  </s>
<s> I will have to invest careful, meticulous reading.  </s>
<s> I expect that to be rewarding from what I have seen so far.  </s>
<s> I always find it difficult that we are confined to using language to talk about language, and it is easy for me to get lost.  </s>
<s> (For example, I think I found some places where the word class is used and something like class denotation is meant, but I am too shaky on the fine points to be certain.) 3.Then there are Ntriples.  </s>
<s> I don't think I could have gotten anywhere if it hadn't been for Ntriples.  </s>
<s> What I notice, though, is that Ntriples are too simple and I started using @prefix at once (same reason as those entity definitions ?:).  </s>
<s> I also found myself using informal notations to distinguish cases that seem to be lumped under blank nodes -- ways to help me reconcile defined-and-used only-here (the private single-occurrence case), defined-and-used-only-locally (internal to the set), and vocabulary created here (and usable from elsewhere once a URI for "here" is established), as opposed to vocabulary grounded/anchored elsewhere.  </s>
<s> And I see I am already in trouble using terms of location (which "here" do I mean exactly - I said I get lost in languaging about language, yes?).  </s>
<s> Sigh.  </s>
<s> Still, Ntriples are a great help.  </s>
<s> And the advice about not over-using a URI for what it is in some near-in sense (e.g., a mailto:...) for the persona associated with that entity is very useful.  </s>
<s> 4.Not using verbs as the local name part of property QNames.  </s>
<s> Thank you, thank you, thank you.  </s>
<s> The confusion of predicate in RDF with predicate in schoolroom English-sentence diagramming is seriously not helpful and I am gratified that it is not in the material I've digested here so far.  </s>
<s> Those are some aspects that I find encouraging and helpful.  </s>
<s> Maybe this is better as a back-channel conversation, but I thought it would be good to say publicly what I see working for one person wrestling with these materials for the first time.  </s>
