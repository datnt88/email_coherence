The issue has been raised here about whether we might be making a mistake by encoding some of our request parameters in XML entity bodies. 
The thought is that this may force proxies to read the body of the message, something that they should not have to do. 
I guess there are several questions here: Are we currently forcing proxies to read message bodies? 
Are any of the parameters that are now in the message body ones that proxies have to know about? 
If so, should we make some changes? 
Should we express some design principle for future revisions of the spec, about not putting into the message body any parameters a proxy might need to read? 
Should we consider a more extreme position (that would require significant changes to the current spec): Never put request parameters in the message body?

Put in more detail: If (it involves cachability it goes into the headers) exit; elseif (it is likely to be something a firewall would want to examine it goes into the headers) exit; elseif (it must be used with a method that already has a defined body then it goes into the headers) exit; elseif (it encodes information that is very likely to be expanded on later then it goes in the body) exit; elseif (it has potentially unlimited length then it goes into the body) exit; The second to last rule reflects the difficult of encoding the DAV message model in a header without re-inventing XML for headers. 
The last rule reflects the reality that most proxy/firewall implementations will barf if headers get larger than around 4k. 
This also effects performance. 
Once a proxy/firewall hits content length it can just blindly start passing bits, which is very fast. 
If you have mega huge headers you slow down every single proxy/firewall on the path for info it may not care about. 
As always, it is a judgement call. 
Yaron This is a great statement of some rules of thumb for deciding between headers and XML entity bodies for request parameters. 
Can we put these on the Web site someplace as a reference for the authors of the remaining specs? 
(It would just be a little easier than searching the mail archive for them.) Maybe there are some other guiding principles, too, that suthors should keep in mind. 
--Judy Sure, copy as you will. 
You really should start beating up on me to get me to release a document I have put together which collects all the "Why did you do that?" e-mails I have answered, both in public and private. 
I just have about 10,000 things to do and this one hasn't quite ranked high enough.
