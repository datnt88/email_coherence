<s> One issue I'd like to raise - and maybe it shouldn't emane from the WAI but as a direct input to the HTML-WG - is the issue of overloaded HTML attributes, 'class' in particular.  </s>
<s> For instance, if one wants to declare a TABLE as being both of class=record and class=cost, it's impossible, since SGML only allows for one attribute setting (someone told me that someday, correct and ignore this message if this isn't true).  </s>
<s> As a result, CSS cannot specify different presentation properties for both 'record' and 'cost' classes of table.  </s>
<s> My suggestion would be to extend the class syntax to allow for a comma-separated list of values: class="record, cost" and have the user agent parse it accordingly.  </s>
<s> The wording in CSS would beed to be extended to understand this list of values of course.  </s>

<s> They must be separated by white space characters.  </s>
<s> -- Al Now, the fact that AXIS doesn't do the same _is_ a bug.  </s>
<s> On one side I'm proud to have though about the feature without any further knowledge of it, on the other I feel stupid not having read the spec more thoroughly.  </s>
<s> Oh well.  </s>
