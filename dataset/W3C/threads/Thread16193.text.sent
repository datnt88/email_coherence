Resent-CC: recipient list not shown: ; Standards body translates Web for devices By Paul Festa Staff Writer, CNET News.com 
August 24, 1999, 5:50 p.m. PT The basic language of the Web is due for an overhaul--one that proponents say will make it easier for an array of Web browsing devices to read Web pages. 
Standards body the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) today released a proposed recommendation--the penultimate stage in the W3C recommendation process--of Extensible Hypertext Markup Language (XHTML http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/). 
The proposed recommendation would rewrite Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), commonly referred to as the Web's lingua franca, in Extensible Markup Language (XML http://www.cnet.com/Resources/Info/Glossary/Terms/xml.html), a newer technology for creating Web languages.

small point. 
it is possible to have a screen reader really make a nightmare out of it by spelling mixed case tags. 
Maybe this is a small point, but since xml is case sensitive, this will make it very hard to read/parse using speech. 
How do I really know what a tag is without having to read the entire tag character by character. 
This could be a real nightmare for blind web designers. 
The same sort of problem comes up in case sensitive programming languages like C. Some of this is elleviated by convention (use all uppercase names for #define constants) in C for instance. 
Some sort of elleviated by speech synthesizers dealing with things like imbedded caps: example: ForExampleMySynthesizerReadsThisCorrectly The previous line says: example: My Synthesizer Reads This Correctly Maybe I'm missing something here, but is case sensitivity really necessary? 
Why?

---sig off--- One good solution is to write your tags as you always do, but before putting it onto a server, run it through a script that converts it to the form required by XHTML.
