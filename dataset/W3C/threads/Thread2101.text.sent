A very early, and somewhat incomplete version of my paper is available at http://www.ebt.com:8080/. 
This is subject to large changes in the future, though the core concepts and explanations are there. 
Please take the document with a pound of salt ;-) I will be updating the document, and would appreciate constructive advice or critisism. 
Let's try to avoid "heated discussions" this time ;-) Gavin Nicol, EBT I just checked again. 
Mosaic, Netscape, and Lynx all seem to deal with it fine. 
The HTML is fairly plain too. 
Something's wrong I'm afraid, please fix it as I am really really interested in your work. 
Anyone else having problems? 
I was able to view and print the document using Netscape Navigator 1.0N for X. 
The Multilingual WWW Wed Apr 5 19:14:11 1995 connolly@www19 ../connolly[502] uname -a SunOS www19 5.3 Generic sun4m connolly@www19 ../connolly[505] xdpyinfo name of display: :0.0 version number: 11.0 vendor string: Sun Microsystems, Inc. vendor release number: 3300 Dan I tried to read it, but had some difficulty. 
The HTML seems to be screwed up: The table of contents appears like a staircase, the fonts are extra-large (like everything's a header) and for some reason the browser won't let me look at the source. 
I tried to print it to read it at leisure on the plane to WWW'95, but only obtained a mess with multiple pages printed on the same sheet. 
Something's wrong I'm afraid, please fix it as I am really really interested in your work. 
Cordially, Fran?ois Yergeau yergeau@alis.ca

The only slightly strange thing about the source is that the TOC uses a DL but the DT tags have no DD . 
What browser are you using? 
Anyone else having problems? 
I have a feeling that your copy is corrupted.
