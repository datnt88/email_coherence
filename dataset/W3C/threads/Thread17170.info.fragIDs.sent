<s> Hi Everyone, Can you use the ID attribute with the Label tag while using JSP forms?  </s>
<s> Will the example below work associating the label with the property attribute?  </s>
<s> Thanks in advance for your help.  </s>

<s> Scott, Like PHP, ASP, and other server-side scripting languages, you need to verify that the correct HTML structures will be created by the server.  </s>
<s> In this case, I believe that the "property" attribute in the JSP will create the name attribute in the HTML, meaning that you need to add the id attribute before the label will be explicitly associated with the input field in the HTML.  </s>

<s> You can use ID attribute, but you must write it as styleId="username" Then the jsp processor will generate the in the final rendered html code and assistive technology will pick it up.  </s>
