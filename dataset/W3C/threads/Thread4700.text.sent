Greetings, I believe XQuery is missing an important feature; the ability to serialize a document in URI form, so that the resulting URI may be used as an argument to the GET method. 
Consider the recent TAG finding regarding the use of HTTP GET; "Use GET if [...] The interaction is more like a question (i.e., it is a safe operation such as a query, read operation, or lookup)." -- http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/whenToUseGet.html 
Being able to perform a query via GET requires that a URI serialization of the query (i.e. the XQuery document) be provided. 
Without this, the only way that querying can be performed interoperably would be via POST. 
Thanks! 
Mark.

Thanks for your comment. 
Note that the XQuery WG only specifies the general language semantics and syntax and does not specify its binding to different access methods. 
Therefore, we consider the interaction with the HTTP protocol (or SOAP or JDBC or ADO.net) outside of our scope. 
Best regards Michael used serialization the POST. 
Thanks Michael. 
I understand that position, as at first blush it seems perfectly reasonable. 
But I believe that query languages have a special obligation under the constraints of Web architecture (especially those developed within the W3C), as I attempted to explain with the reference to the TAG document. 
Is your response the official response of the WG? Thanks again. 
Mark. 
First: My response is not the official responds (at least not yet :-)) of the WG. Second: There are many obligations w.r.t. interactions with different protocols and APIs. 
We find that if we open up to one, we will bias the language toward that area and this is not in the interest of the language design. 
Also, I feel that people working in the area of these protocols, APIs and architectures are normally better suited to provide the syntax and semantics for their interaction. 
And I think the WG will be happy to help them (although preferably after we have shipped the recommendation to not further delay it). 
Again, not speaking for the WG... Michael From: Mark Baker [mailto:distobj@acm.org] Sent: Thursday, October 16, 2003 11:59 AM Subject: Re: XQuery and GET semantics methods. 
SOAP seems special reference Hi Mark - I am not sure whether I understand this. 
Are you simply saying you want to be able to write a query to create another query, then use that query as an argument to GET? True, but I think it's also important to keep in mind that: Web application design should be informed by the above principles, but also by the relevant limitations.

There are limits to what fits easily on a URI. 
A 12 page query with functions and schema imports probably doesn't naturally fit into this framework. 
Jonathan No response from an individual is an official response of the WG unless it explicitly says so. 
When the Working Group authorizes an official response, it is written with language that clearly indicates it is official. 
Jonathan Hi Jonathan, No, just to make a URI out of an XQuery query. 
(I really should have used "XQuery and URIs" as the subject of my initial email) Web application design should be informed by the above principles, but also by the relevant limitations. 
-- http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/whenToUseGet.html#practical 
Probably not, no. 
But for smaller, perhaps simpler queries, I think it would be enormously useful. 
Where the WG decides to draw this line, I don't know (FLWR??). 
But I also wonder if drawing a line may be more work than covering the general case, and then letting your customers (XQuery processor designers and app-developers) decide what's too big to go in a URI. 
8-) That's totally your call, of course, but anything you can do in this direction would be progress, I'd say, and would address my concern. 
Thanks.

Perhaps XPath is the right level for this? 
Jonathan I apologize, but I only just realized that I hadn't responded to this. 
Perhaps, but I feel strongly that any query language on the Web (and especially those developed in the W3C) should be able to use URIs. 
I'm also not convinced that a general XQuery URI serialization isn't possible.
