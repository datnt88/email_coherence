<s> well, depends.  </s>
<s> I think the rudiments of html are best understood by using a text editor.  </s>
<s> I think also that once the rudiments are learned, it is easier to learn how to use a tool like: frontpage or netscape composer which I personally like.  </s>

<s> From my point of view: go for HoTMetaL Pro 4.  </s>
<s> from SoftQuad (http://www.softquad.com/products/pc-hmp4.htm)  </s>
<s> you can download a trial version for some 60 days I believe it is by far the best html editor I am aware of HoTMetal comes now with some interfaces to softbraille etc. so it became very accessible as a product HoTMetaL PRO 4.0 is a validating editor, that enables the generation of high quality HTML.  </s>
<s> Using the 'Check HTML' command one can verify that the markup in a document is correct and complete.  </s>
<s> Furthermore, HoTMetaL PRO has implemented a 'Check Accessibility' command which checks documents against a set of accessibility guidelines.  </s>

<s> While I'm not the biggest fan of FrontPage, it really does make adjusting your code to meet accessibility standards a LOT easier than other editors do.  </s>
<s> I use Bobby to check my FrontPage sites without many problems at all.  </s>
<s> The only problems that I've had in that respect was applying what Bobby told me to do with some Java applets that I was using, but I expected to have problems with those pesky scripts anyway.  </s>
<s> Basically, I think that FrontPage 98 is the lesser of the evils, so to speak...but I'm sure that there are a ton of people who would argue with me... :-) Kristine Bradow Wayne State University Enabling Technologies Laboratory Detroit, MI 48202  </s>
<s> Though there are of course quirks I recommend Front Page 98.  </s>
<s> It allows you to change the code to things (like HTML 4.0) that HoTMetaL Pro won't stand for.  </s>
<s> Yes but when it comes to Acessibility, how many times do you have to go through and edit a site done in Frontpage 98 before it follows accessibility guidelines or Web standards?  </s>

<s> Not trying to flame but I disagree with using HoTMetaL Pro 4. I think it is awful.  </s>
<s> It pretty much forces you to write to HTML 3.2 and the "WYSIWYG" editor is pretty far off from what actually shows up in any browser.  </s>

<s> All those lovely things you say about Hot Metal Pro 4 are relatively true, but my experience with it was that it was very difficult to use with a speech synthesizer, and I deleted it from my system before the trial period ended.  </s>
<s> I use a combination of HTMLPRO3 (I think they are up to about 5 now) and DreamWeaver finding the former the very simplest to use with speech access.  </s>
