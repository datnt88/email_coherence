<s> CMcN:: "I have noted in the intro to guideline 4 that things should be done automatically _where possible_..." WL: That may be fine but it plays back into Phill's next question "where is it possible?" - and rightly so, I think.  </s>
<s> I believe we must all re-read the guidelines document with a slightly different *attitude* than we've been using: pretend to be a developer trying to use this document to design a triple-AAA conformant tool and see if there are any ambiguities or impossibilities assumed in the way the original wording "must be designed so that they can automatically identify inaccessible markup..." pretends that such identification can be done (ever?).  </s>
<s> Only if we look at this from the point of view of those who must abide it can we avoid a very proper "digging in of the heels" by those most affected.  </s>
<s> If we can make adequate editorial changes to rectify these issues we won't have to recycle the document.  </s>

<s> while i am in sympathy with a number of the points you made in your recent post on check versus identity, i am still at a loss as to why anyone would want to claim conformance for a straight text-editor... by text-editor, i don't mean an enhanced text editor, such as HotDog or HomeSite, but an application whose primary purpose is to provide the user with the ability to compose a document in plain ASCII... NotePad isn't an authoring tool, although it can be used to write markup, it is simply a plain text editor... it doesn't transform plain text to HTML as Word and WordPerfect do -- the individual using NotePad performs that transformation... therefore, i think the whole question of what conformance level would be accorded a plain text editor such as NotePad, ED, PC-Pico, or BBedit if you gave it to someone along with WCAG, the HTML4 rec, the CSS2 rec, and whatever other supplemental resources you care to throw in, a specious non sequitur... the only way that NotePad could qualify as an authoring tool is if it was delivered in an executable or archived format along with the HTML4 and CSS2 specifications, specifically AS an authoring tool... Emacspeak is a speech-output system for Emacs... therefore, it is not itself an authoring tool, but an adaptive technology for the Unix/Linux environment... it is no more an authoring tool than is Jaws for Windows or JAWS for DOS... granted, without either, i wouldn't be able to create content for the web, but that does not make them authoring tools... just my 2 cents, gregory.  </s>
