<s> Hi all I am giving a talk to the British Computer Society's web publishing group on publishing on the web for people with learning disabilities.  </s>
<s> I have found a lot of good resources on the web, but was wondering if anyone had any other recommendations for good reading, or examples of good websites which are designed specifically for people with learning disabilities which I could demonstrate.  </s>

<s> We have developed our sound pages using flash sound files.  </s>
<s> We are mid development with a new section - which is not really working and flash, but it is too jerky!  </s>

<s> Hi,  </s>
<s> I know this doesn't answer your question, but I did some work with David Crowson on the CharitySkills site using sound and was wondering why you would want to include voice samples of the text on screen?  </s>
<s> Cheers, Julian Voelcker Cirencester, United Kingdom  </s>
<s> Hi Caroline, Take a look at this tool - This is a simulation for different user scenarios.  </s>
<s> Put in any URL.  </s>
<s> Choose the last simulation which is readability for people with some reading disabilities.  </s>
<s> It was created by a W3C member who is dyslexic.  </s>
<s> The idea here is for people to test their sites and check the usability of their site with these different scenarios.  </s>
<s> For the full review tool - www.ubaccess.com/art.html  </s>
<s> I hope this helps.  </s>
<s> Good luck with your talk.  </s>
<s> Jael  </s>
<s> Caroline, looks to be a great site, well done and thanks, we now link to it from the letter 'h'.  </s>
<s> I'm not sure if you've taken the time to look at the peepo site, but you will find plenty of resources there.  </s>
<s> We've always felt it is critical to involve users in creating resources, this sends a powerful message, empowers and motivates.  </s>
<s> teaching staff report that students fail to engage well with icon based resources and prefer photographs of individuals.  </s>
<s> I recognise this may not always be appropriate.  </s>
<s> SVG produces graphics that scale well, this can be a huge advantage.  </s>
<s> sound does take a while to load, it means caching the site before users visit, or as mencap has done in the past provide a speaker button.  </s>
<s> we don't do this only because of the confusion of icons present already.... one real problem we've had is creating web pages that look great and print well.... thanks Jonathan Chetwynd "A web by people with learning difficulties"  </s>
