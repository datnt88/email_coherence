Thanks, Chuck. 
These are posted and linked. 
By the way, the Responsible Ministry for the Ontarians with Disabilities Act (ODA) is: "Ministry of Citizenship" By the way, one way to help get updates posted faster is to send both the English and the French marked up in HTML. 
:-) For Additional Information on the ODA it might be appropriate to link to: "Accessibility Ontario" Hum, I skimmed it quickly and didn't notice anything specifically on Web accessibility. 
Is there? 
If so, should we link to the specific area for Web information?
