I usually lurk on a list a bit before writing, but here goes. 
I'd love to install amaya on my linux box but I can only download about 12k of any rpm using every ftp means at my disposal. 
What is wrong here? 
I even managed to ftp it to my isp but still can't get it from there to my home box.. Yes I have checked the archives.

It seems that the trouble concerns the ftp connection with your isp. 
Could you check that connection. 
Irene. 
Well, I gave up on RPM's and downloaded the *.tgz file with no problem. 
I'm up and running now ;) I figure the problem must have been with rpm-find's ftp site.
