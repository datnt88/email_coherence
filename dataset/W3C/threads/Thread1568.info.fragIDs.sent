<s> I'm familiar with content negotiation, but I guess that negotiating on XML properties would be 'practically impossible' given that WebDAV properties match on name alone (and not attributes), otherwise you could image (assuming xml:lang is the attribute for language tagging, I've no idea what it is) PROPPATCH /foo setting properties with language flags ...xmlns:D="..."... Then a client could get the property value of choice in the language of choice: PROPFIND /foo Content-Language: "frfrench" or even specifying the language in the body of the XML request: PROPFIND /foo /D:author xml:lang="dutch" (With big apologies to XML and HTTP syntax-ites.)

<s> This was a change requested by Yaron to support internationalization.  </s>
<s> You can have the comment string in multiple languages this way.  </s>
<s> I don't believe that the multiple comment strings were intended for property content negotiation, but rather to allow you to put comments in multiple languages on a resource which does not have multiple language variants.  </s>
<s> This could help support searching for a document in multiple languages, even if the document itself is in only one language.  </s>
<s> I agree with Greg's point that a version is unlikely to have comments in multiple languages, but this property is intended for an arbitrary resource, not just for version resources.  </s>
<s> The reason this property (and DAV:creator-displayname) are specified this way is that they can take natural language values, which is not the case for the versioning specific properties.  </s>
<s> So I guess I see some benefit, with minimal cost.  </s>
<s> To make sure I haven't missed anything, is there any cost to this extra layer of XML, other than a few extra bytes?  </s>
