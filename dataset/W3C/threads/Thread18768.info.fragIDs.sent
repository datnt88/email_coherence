Subject: Time:3:03 PM OFFICE MEMO D-tags, etc. Date:5/20/97 Here is a view on the D-tag discussion from one of WGBH's web authors: "The latest version of the HTTP standard (1.1) allows browsers to send an ordered lists of language preferences when they request a page from a server. 
If the server has content in the language at the top of the list, it will respond in that language. 
If not, it will try the next language in the list, and so on. 
Currently, only the Apache server supports HTTP 1.1 and as far as I know, none of the browsers are using it yet either. 
The solution(s) presented in the first message seem unnecessarily complex. 
It would be inefficient to send that much text data for every image on the page when all users (vision-impaired or not) are only interested in one version of the data. 
In addition, the REL attribute and the FIG tag have been around for quite a while, but no browsers have implemented them -- they may be a dead-end street. 
It seems like the ideal solution would be to have additional languages defined, such as "vision-impaired-english" and "hearing-impaired-spanish," that would be set by the user in his or her browser. 
Servers would then respond in the most appropriate "language" without sending redundant information." - Larry Larry Goldberg, Director Media Access WGBH Educational Foundation 125 Western Ave.

I agree with Larry-- except that rather than defining an uncountable number of languages of the form blind-english, low-vision-english, ... the "special need" should be a separate axis that takes values and can be specified by the user agent, e.g. the WWW browser, just as the language is a separate acix. 
The protocol at the server end should map special-need _ language to the appropriate type of content.

[Al, here...] Learn about Lynx. 
Lynx gives you the chance to experience various features of HTTP 1.1 and HTML 3.0 that you may not realize have been implemented.

Of course - even better.

[Al, here...] Not many of our users would agree with that. 
If there are alternatives, our users want to know that the alternatives exist, and control the selection of alternatives, including going back for more or different data if the rules applied at the server didn't work well. 
Yes, they are willing for the server to guess. 
The don't want all the data delivered at first blush. 
But they want the guesses to determine defaults, not stone walls. 
We've had some heated discussions on lynx-dev over this one.

We found in our work that people wanted layered descriptions. 
Something very short and succinct Something more descriptive Something which catches all of the information available visually. 
They don't want to pay for the latter unless they want or need it. 
Suggest we think of Alt Tag as the first level. 
Perhaps the second level could be embedded in the page if it is short. 
The third would be downloaded on request from the server. 
The link for this extended description might be embedded in the second level information somehow. 
This suggestion is not made from the basis of technical feasibility but rather from the fact that it buries it away a bit so that it does not confuse the regular page any more than it has to - but makes it available to those seeking more descriptive information.

Reply to: RE  D-tags, etc. Al, et al., Let me correct the impression that the statement may incorrectly imply: "... all users (vision-impaired or not) are only interested in one version of the data. 
" What is meant is that all users want one version that works for them regardless of their needs, that people don't want multiple copies sent to them if they can get one that truly works. 
Of course this may mean that multiple versions and alternates are available and that users would like to know about these versions, but ultimately just want the one that works for them. 
Still disagree? - Larry Date: 5/27/97 4:28 PM From: Al Gilman My text for this message: From: "Larry Goldberg" Larry_Goldberg@wgbh.org ... all users (vision-impaired or not) are only interested in one version of the data.

[Al, here..] Sounds like we are in flaming agreement. 
To carry the point a little further, I want to get a little distance between "user wants" and "what is sent." 
The users want a form of dialog that works for them. 
This dialog is seen between the user and the client program(s). 
Precisely what the server sends the client is of a lesser concern to the user. 
How much redundancy is used in the client/server messages is, I think, an issue where the developers will take the lead and the users mostly check that the end-to-end capability is not broken.
