<s> I was wondering if there's any text to speech emulators that are free or cheap to use in helping design an accessible site.  </s>

<s> Excellent question -- participants in a HWG project earlier this year identified "a browser that would show me what my site sounds like" as one of the most important aids to creating accessible web pages.  </s>
<s> I highly recommend pwWebSpeak -- it costs $150 but you can get a limited use trial copy for free by asking.  </s>
<s> The webpage is $150.  </s>
<s> This product is a must-have (in my opinion) for serious web designers who care about making their sites universally accessible!  </s>

<s> Have a look at the sigtuna browser, a speech output browser for WinNT (and 95?), for unix systems TVRaman at adobe has written a piece of software called emacspeak, which can be used alongside EMACs and the W3 browser package - Jason White in Melbourne uses such a system.  </s>
<s> Sigtuna relies on a speech system being present already.  </s>
<s> I don't know if there is one available for free, but I would suspect they can be got for very little.  </s>

<s> Thanks! - Eric Eric Engelmann Website Designer Inlet, Inc.  </s>
<s> Wow, thanks for all the responses so quickly!  </s>
<s> I'll definitely look into the prodworks one, but I'd also like to check out this sigtuna browser.  </s>
<s> A quick search on Yahoo and hotbot didn't turn up anything (unless I'm just blind).  </s>
<s> Where can I find it?  </s>
<s> Thanks again, Eric Engelmann Website Designer, Inlet, Inc.  </s>
<s> Does anyone know if pwWebSpeak supports Secure Socket Layers (SSL).  </s>
<s> If so, which version?  </s>

<s> October 21, 1998, 12:35 p.m. PT As the nation observes National Disabilities Month, two firms and a standards organization are honing in on the needs of visually impaired users.  </s>
<s> IBM today announced the English version of Home Page Reader, its browser for the visually impaired.  </s>
<s> The product, already available in Japanese, will be sold and packaged with Netscape Communications' Navigator browser.  </s>
<s> The product advances beyond traditional screen readers by providing navigation tools for links and other HTML elements such as forms and tables.  </s>
<s> The browser reads standard text in a male voice and links in a female voice.  </s>
<s> It also provides searching capabilities for links, helping users negotiate sites with dozens or hundreds of links per page.  </s>
<s> IBM is not the first firm to provide a browser for the blind.  </s>
<s> Productivity Works debuted its voice-based browser in 1996.  </s>
<s> pwWebSpeak is a stand-alone browser, rather than an add-on.  </s>
<s> Productivity Works is gearing up for the launch of another voice-based browsing product, which will utilize the telephone.  </s>
<s> The firm's pwTelephone is geared not only to the visually impaired, but also to people without access to Internet-ready PCs.  </s>
<s> The software may also prove useful to firms that want to provide information, such as schedules or price lists, both by phone and over the Web and from a single source.  </s>
<s> Another Web-telephone product is General Magic's Web-On-Call.  </s>
<s> Interest in phone-based Web access systems is reflected in activity at the World Wide Web Consortium, the standards body whose recommendations are widely respected and recognized among Web developers internationally.  </s>
<s> The W3C this month held a workshop to discuss phone-based Web access.  </s>
<s> The workshop will likely result in a W3C working group for voice browsers, according to Productivity Works cofounder and senior vice president Mark Hakkinen, who attended the workshop.  </s>
<s> "In the world today, far more people have access to a telephone than have access to a computer with an Internet connection," the W3C noted in a call for participation.  </s>
<s> "Voice browsers offer the promise of allowing people to access the Web from any telephone, vastly increasing the number of people who can use Web sites."  </s>
<s> The W3C has an arm devoted specifically to issues regarding Web users with disabilities, the Web Accessibility Initiative.  </s>
<s> The initiative has worked to make both Web languages and Web developers more friendly to visually impaired users, pushing for more descriptive alternative text for images and tables, for instance, and for standards that make tables and columns readable by voice browsers.  </s>
<s> The English version of IBM's product will be available in January.  </s>
<s> PwTelephone will be available next week.  </s>
