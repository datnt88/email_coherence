<s> You might want to set/get individual properties.  </s>

<s> section 4.4.2 of the 1999-03-04 draft), by the style attribute of HTMLElement2 [1].  </s>
<s> So I guess what I really meant to ask about was whether there would be some way te get (but there would be no need to set) the current cascaded style on any element.  </s>
<s> One could do the setting through the style attribute [2], but might want to see the current cascaded value through something like currentStyle (as I believe MSIE implements).  </s>
<s> If it would be too difficult to make the values within currentStyle readonly, then setting currentStyle could be made equivalent to setting style.  </s>
<s> I worry that saying style is of type CSSStyleDeclaration is too CSS-specific.  </s>
<s> But I don't know how else to provide the same features.  </s>
<s> One final note: the parentRule attribute of CSSStyleDeclaration should probably be defined as being null if the parent is not a CSSRule.  </s>
<s> David [1] http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-DOM-Level-2/css.html#Level-2-CSS-htmlelement2 [2] but, as I've said before, it would be nice if it had a specificity of 1000.  </s>

<s> Good point.  </s>
<s> It does seem like too much to ask to expect script authors to parse a string for this information.  </s>
<s> Yes, I found that after making my previous posting.  </s>
<s> Me too.  </s>
<s> I remain of the opinion that a better model would forego this direct manipulation of styles on elements altogether, in favor of an exclusive binding of the scripting language to the style sheet.  </s>
<s> Thus script has the ability to modify only the stylesheet itself at runtime.  </s>
<s> The style rules applied to an element can be modified in the document by changing the element's class or id at runtime.  </s>
<s> These techniques could be consolidated in a behaviors syntax similar philosophically (but different syntactically) to Netscape's CAS.  </s>
<s> It is unfortunate that the current description of CAS is tied to the CSS style mechanism.  </s>
