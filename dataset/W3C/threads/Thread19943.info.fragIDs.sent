Hello Henry, In our previous episode, Henry Meyerding said: 
It should go in the Amaya/dicopar subdirectory. 
If you're using Windows, the Amaya directory is two levels above the directory where the executable file is. 
I'm not sure if you have a dicopar directory. 
Could you verify it and reply back to the list so that we can fix it in the next release? 
In the meantime, if the directory doesn't exist, just make a new one :) Thanks, -Jose

The right place is within the directory Amaya/dicopar Irene.
