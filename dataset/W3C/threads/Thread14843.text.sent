/* changed subject line from "Re: Structure of deliverables: are we too PC for our own good?" */ AG: Let me explain what I perceive as the significance of what Kelly Ford said. 
AG: Kelly has shown us that The Emperor Has No Clothes. 
AG: Labeling active elements adequately, so that the user can be oriented to what they do, in whatever delivery context the user happens to be operating in, is the number one most important problem to be reformed on the World Wide Web today. 
AG: If Kelly Ford, who understands the domain of this document deeply already before reading it, can't find the advice for how to fix this number one problem in this document, it is time to set it aside and think again about what we think we are doing, here. 
GJR: which is the point of public review - wasn't kelly's concern adequately addressed via the response archived at (long URI warning): which contains a proposed addition to the checkpoint text, which has been added (along with kelly's comments) to (long URI warning): it's not a case of the emperor not having any clothes, but of everyone gawking at him as he parades around clad only in a blueprint decorated with small samples of material. 
on the other hand, i think that the topics that you and bill raised need to be addressed by the WG, as we are at a cross-roads, where we are presented with a stark choice - continue with the current plan, or come up with something else altogether, but first it must be ascertained if the foundations we have laid so far for a W3C Technical Recommendation are strong enough to bear the burden of scrutiny, or if they crumble beneath our feet. 
we also need to consider whether some of us should be working hand-in-glove with other W3C working groups (such as Voice Browser) to ensure that accessibility concerns are addressed front-and-center in canonical specs, and not "merely" relegated to a technology-specific module/layer of WCAG2 - accessibility features, concerns, and requirements need to be bolted into specs and their conformance model as normative features/functionality of the spec, and not relegated solely to WAI materials.

Hello!, anybody home? 
This is what the "dogfood patrol" needs to be doing. 
Before we get too involved in "outreach" we MUST get heavier into "inreach". 
This (bolting accessibility features in) is supposed to already happen. 
I'm fairly sure it only does at the "lip service level" - hope I'm wrong. 
Love. 
EACH UN-INDEXED/ANNOTATED WEB POSTING WE MAKE IS TESTAMENT TO OUR HYPOCRISY ts.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2001JulSep/0843 AG:: True confessions, when I read the two assertions up front: - this is technology-specific - it's basically in there both of which I felt were a) important and b) untrue, I stopped reading. 
Yes, the edit in that post eliminates the chance to say "nowhere can I find..." But it's not an adequate response because the rewrite still hides a major point as if it were minor. 
The injunction to "label form controls" is not only not technology-specific, it is just-right abstraction. 
It is abstract because it applies to interactive widgets found in web media from left and right. 
It is appropriately focused because form controls have their own class-specific requirements and problems. 
Talking about labels in general is diffuse and weak. 
Talking about the requirement to have labels for form controls is important to say because that is so often where the process breaks down, and tends to break irreparably. 
The generalized discussion of "use structure and labels ..." misses the essential before:after relationship that is at the heart of this rule. 
Use labels that let the user know before they activate the control what will happen after they activate the control. 
This is the essence inherited from the ten commandments of UI usability. 
And the time separation or sequence is essential to capturing what is required. 
That is why I felt I should come back and reiterate the flow of reasoning I felt had been mostly missed, while it is essential to getting across this critical injunction for web accessibility. 
It's not just a "for instance" of "use labels." 
It's a "for instance" of "give advance warning" as well. 
Of course it is a example of both of those. 
But it is the second which lends it its proper importance. 
Which is, like, at the head of the class.
