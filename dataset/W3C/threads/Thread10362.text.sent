Martin Duerst suggests that we add an exc-C14n test that shows br/ " in RDF/XML exc-canonicalizing to " br /br " in the graph. 
[[I think it would be good to add an example like this just to document how RDF/XML syntax, lexical value, and so on, are related, and in particular, that they are not exactly the same.]] -- http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Aug/0045.html 
This has no consequences on any document but justs adds another exc-C14n test. 
Any implementation that already does exc-C14n or C14n will already do this. 
We happen to have not tested it our existing tests. 
i.e. a new test for rdfms-literal-is-xml-structure - test 006 Option 1 input rdfms-literal-is-xml-structure/test006.rdf rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#" xmlns:eg="http://example.org/" outputrdfms-literal-is-xml-structure/test006.rdf http://example.org/foo 
http://example.org/bar 
" br /br "^^ http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#XMLLiteral . 
Option 2 The br element above remains without a namesapce. 
If we did add one it would likely be the html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" like this: input rdfms-literal-is-xml-structure/test006.rdf rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#" xmlns:eg="http://example.org/" outputrdfms-literal-is-xml-structure/test006.rdf http://example.org/foo 
http://example.org/bar 
" br xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" /br "^^ http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#XMLLiteral . 
Dave br/ " in RDF/XML exc-canonicalizing to " br /br " in the graph. 
I've no objection in principle, and I'd rather satisfy folks than not. 
However, this is late in the day. 
We will need to be careful about what we say in the implementation report, or ask folks to retest. 
Does this test really add something new? 
Brian Would there be scope for collecting "additional" or "unofficial" test cases that can be folded into the mainstream in a future cycle?
