Hi - I'm trying to use Tidy to clean the HTML that the WebObjects builder tool generates. 
WebObjects only has a single added element to the HTML syntax which is: webobject / But, there are many instances where a webobject / tag wraps a tr td /td /tr set of tags in a table to repeat through a list of elements to generate a table. 
Here's an example: Tidy Test With the following Tidy config data: new-inline-tags: webobject output-xhtml: true doctype: strict indent: yes write-back: true tidy-mark: false show-warnings: false quiet: true wrap: 0 Tidy converts this to the following: !DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd" 
Untitled I saw in the documentation somewhere that what I'm trying to do may not be possible but I'm wondering if there is any workaround such as a way to "ignore" the webobjects tags possibly? 
I've tried all the different new-* tags but they all had the problems in my tests. 
Any help would be appreciated. 
Thanks Mike Mike Engelhart EZTrip.com put it in new-blocklevel-tags On Sun, 23 May 2004 19:48:46 -0500, Michael Engelhart Yeah, I tried that but it doesn't generate valid WebObjects code. 
The concept between a "repetition" type WebObjects tag is that the data associated with that tag is an array of data that gets looped through and in my example the tr tags generate rows of data from that array. 
This is the output when I use new-blocklevel-tags: !DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd" 
Tidy Test What I want is: !DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd" 
Tidy Test Thanks Mike I am afraid Tidy does not allow to do that. 
What would be possible is that you specify --input-xml in which case Tidy would not apply any HTML/XHTML processing but might be able to ensure the well-formedness of the document. 
It might also be possible to change Tidy so that it would allow to specify --input-xml yes --output-xhtml yes so that it would additionally allow to use the XHTML pretty printer if that is what you are looking for. 
Other than that, it would probably be rather difficult to add such capability to Tidy. 
Oh well. 
I was afraid of that. 
:-) The problem is that the current WebObjects builder tools generate HTML 3.2 code (although the WebObjects system can parse XHTML just fine) and I'm trying to have it cleaned up before being sent through the webobjects processor and was looking for a way to do this in my build scripts. 
if I did use --input-xml wouldn' it fail being that the input is definitely not going to be well-formed. 
Thanks again. 
Mike
