Although PF is "member-private" the Working Draft of XMLGL is public so I'm not violating any trust by quoting its Checkpoint: 1.1 Provide a mechanism to explicitly associate alternative equivalents for content or content fragments. 
[p1] Which comes under its Guideline: 1.0 Ensure that authors can associate multiple media objects as alternatives The sense expressed in the phrase "multiple media objects" is IMO much more fitting/general for WCAG 2's Checkpoint 1.1 intent than the current "text equivalent for all non-text content".

ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE Well said, William! 
I like something on the order of "provide alternative content for all content and pieces of content".

Me too. 
The second "content" might warrant a modifier/expander? 
Or change "alternative content" to "alternatives"? 
And of course the usual "where appropriate" loopholes. 
Love.
