I am a first time website creator. 
I created several pages using HTML. 
I used notepad to write all my code. 
I then changed my code to follow the XHTML specifications (I think). 
I have not obtained a server yet, so I can't go to your site and put in my URL address. 
I have downloaded a copy of html Tidy.exe 
I would like to use HTML Tidy to see if my code is written correctly. 
I have visited your website to see if I can figure out how to use HTML Tidy, but I believe I am too basic in DOS (and probably web knowledge) to follow the instructions on your site. 
Can you please help me. 
I appreciate that you usually deal with people more knowledgeable with HTML and DOS than I am, and you may not be able to help me. 
However, if you can I would appreciate it greatly.

Does the info on URL:http://tidy.sourceforge.net/docs/faq.html#what-now help? 
If not, it might be worthwhile to download a text editor that integrates easily with HTML Tidy, like NoteTab or HTML-Kit. 
Or use this graphical front-end for HTML Tidy: If you don't like having choices | Rijk van Geijtenbeek made for you, you should start | Documentation &amp; QA making your own.

You can either run Tidy in a console window from the command line, or you may prefer to use a tool the provides a GUI front end. 
You can find several of these linked off the SourceForge page at: Dave Raggett dsr@w3.org
