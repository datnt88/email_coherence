<s> Hello: I'm a user who has downloaded Amaya to create my personal web page...  </s>
<s> I'm from Europe and I want to introduce euro-sign (?) and it's not possible in ISO-8859-1.  </s>
<s> I've tried to chenge the charset from Notepad and when I load the web page on Amaya it says XML is not well-formed... How can I get Amaya understand ISO-8859-15???  </s>
<s> Thank you.  </s>

<s> Hello For the moment, Amaya doesn't understand ISO-8859-15.  </s>
<s> Concerning ISO Latin charsets, Amaya understand ISO-8859-1 up to ISO-8859-9.  </s>
<s> So, the best way to introduce the euro-sign is to use the external entity &amp;euro;.  </s>
<s> But Amaya doesn't use the exact glyph for that symbol.  </s>

<s> We're currently working on a unicode version of Amaya which will support a more large set of characters.  </s>
<s> Meanwhile you can let your document in ISO-8859-1 and use the entity &amp;euro;  </s>
