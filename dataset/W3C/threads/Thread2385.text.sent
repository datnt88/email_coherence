I thought I had sent out a LAST CALL, but apparently it was stealth, and doesn't appear on the mailing list. 
I know many of you have expressed your opinion before, but we need to ask the question just once more: Leaving out any consideration of the privacy issues (which will be addressed once we've resolved the protocol issues), are you, in favor of proposing the mechanism in draft-ietf-http-state-man-mech-04.txt as a Proposed Standard. 
This is a working group LAST CALL on this issue. 
You may send your (preferably brief) opinion to me privately, or to the list publicly. 
I'll summarize private opinions. 
(I would rather not discuss the process or the privacy issues at this point, however.) Larry 4. OUTLINE I second Roys comment on the beginning of section 4: ...and that impact can largely be confined to Common Gateway Interface (CGI) programs, unless the server provides more sophisticated state management support. 
That whole statement could just be cut without detracting from the spec. 
CGI is irrelevant - almost all server implementations provide other mechanisms for programatic access and the state management mechanisms apply to them all equally (whether they are "more sophisticated" or not). 
4.1 Syntax: General av-pairs = av-pair *(";" av-pair) av-pair = attr ["=" value] ; optional value attr = token value = word word = token | quoted-string Why not just make the syntax for 'value': value = token | quoted-string I don't see any use for the 'word' token (and the name 'word' is misleading because it isn't a word in the normal english usage). 
NOTE: The syntax above allows whitespace between the attribute and the = sign. 
... and between the "=" and the value? 
There should just be a reference to the general rule for implied whitespace in HTTP header parsing (section 2.1 in RFC2068).

Okay, okay. 
It did make sense once, I think, but I'll remove it. 
4.1 Syntax: General av-pairs = av-pair *(";" av-pair) av-pair = attr ["=" value] ; optional value attr = token value = word word = token | quoted-string Good point. 
NOTE: The syntax above allows whitespace between the attribute and the = sign. 
I do say that "White space is permitted between tokens," which means much the same thing. 
The point of the NOTE was to alert users of Netscape's cookies spec. 
to this change from that spec.
