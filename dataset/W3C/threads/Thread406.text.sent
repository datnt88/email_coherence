('binary' encoding is not supported, stored as-is) Dear All, I am attempting to intergrate JTidy with my java app. 
I am developing on WinNT platform. 
But first, how to use it? 
I already set the classpath to: c:\jtidy-04aug2000r3\build\Tidy.jar 
As expected I got the NoClassFoundException error. 
ie. fail to run it.

Greetings, [cc'd to the list] Hello, I didn't compile anything(do I have to?). 
The following were my steps of installing JTidy: 1. 
I downloaded the jtidy-04aug2000r3.zip 
file and unzip it. 
2. I set the classpath to c:\jtidy-04aug2000r3\build\Tidy.jar 3. Then I try to run it by typing java Tidy but got the following error: Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: 
Tidy Please try java -jar jtidy-04aug2000r3/build/Tidy.jar -h and tell me what it reports.

Tidy In addition to Sami's reply, try typing java org.w3c.tidy.Tidy -h This should work if you have Tidy.jar in your classpath. 
You need to specify the full package name.
