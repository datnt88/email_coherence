Appendix B says Since the 2nd group implies that complementOf Nothing is Thing, the first group is equivalent to 
which is probably what you want to say, or else omit it all together. 
Even better would be to replace "Nothing" with some variant of "any Class" -- which I believe is what the document says elsewhere.

Dear Richard, Thanks for your comment. 
Responses in-line. 
The class axiom for owl:Thing in Appendix B of Reference defines its class extension to be the extension of owl:Nothing plus its complement, which means all individuals in the universe of discourse. 
owl:Nothing is its complement, so its class extension is the empty set. 
Your revised axiom uses owl:Thing to define itself. 
We would prefer to refrain from such recursive definitions and thus keep to the axioms as they currently are. 
I'm not sure I understand your point. 
The extension of owl:Nothing is the empty set, so it is not "any Class". 
owl:Thing and owl:Thing fulfill a special role, namely as root resp. 
leaf of the class lattice, cf. 
Sec. 
3.1: Consequently, every OWL class is a subclass of owl:Thing and owl:Nothing is a subclass of every class. 
Please let us know whether this response is satisfactory. 
Regards, Guus Schreiber

re: any Class, I meant some class with an extension of size  0. Given any such class, ABC. 
Strictly speaking, Nothing is the class of things that don't exist. 
I don't think it's a good idea to base your axioms on Nothing.

Thing and Nothing belong to two separate universes, the universe of things which exist, and the universe of things which do not exist. 
Axioms for the universe of things which exist A is A A or not A is Thing A and not A is Nothing Axioms for the universe of things which do not exist B is not B B or not B is Nothing B and not B is Nothing B is Nothing Dick McCullough knowledge := man do identify od existent done; knowledge haspart proposition list; 
I see that you have moved this discussion to www-rdf-logic; very well. 
For bookkeeping purposes, this marks the public-webont-comments part of the thread closed.
