<s> I have looked at the test HTMLTableElement31.xml and noticed that the description did not fit the test.  </s>
<s> What the test was supposed to do was test the section of the spec that says "In addition, when the table is empty the row is inserted into a TBODY which is created and inserted into the table."  </s>
<s> The file table1 that is loaded has a non-empty table element.  </s>
<s> I created a new table element that was empty and inserted the new row.  </s>
<s> Before I commit the changes I could someone take a look at the test and see if I'm properly testing this portion of the spec.  </s>
<s> New HTMLTableElement31.xml(below)  </s>

<s> -- The insertRow() method inserts a new empty table row.  </s>
<s> In addition, when the table is empty the row is inserted into a TBODY which is created and inserted into the table.  </s>
<s> Load the table1 file which has a non-empty table element.  </s>
<s> Create an empty TABLE element and append to the document.  </s>
<s> Check to make sure that the empty TABLE element doesn't have a TBODY element.  </s>
<s> Insert a new row into the empty TABLE element.  </s>
<s> Check for existence of the a TBODY element in the table.  </s>
<s> Totally empty TABLE elements are not valid HTML or XHTML since the DTD's requires at least one TBODY or TR to appear in the content model of a TABLE.  </s>
<s> I believe that was the motivation of my changing the test document to not have empty tables which had the side effect of compromising the motivation of this test.  </s>
<s> Creating and adding a table element through the DOM as the test apparently does appears to be the best way to test that passage without requiring implementations to accept invalid documents.  </s>
<s> Is the passage you quoted in both L1 and L2 HTML?  </s>
<s> It is not in the original L1 spec but is in L1(Second Edition).  </s>
<s> I previously asked this question to the mailing list but did not receive and answer about items in the L1(Second Edition).  </s>
