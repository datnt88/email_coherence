<s> Dear www4mail, Thanks for the neat service.  </s>
<s> I'm having difficulty submitting forms.  </s>
<s> When I receive a form via email it comes in web page format and I access it using Netscape browser software off line.  </s>
<s> I'm expecting to see a send button but I don't see it.  </s>
<s> When I press the get document button, sometimes I get a message that the form is being submitted via email (since I'm off line I'd like it to be queued) but nothing seems to happen.  </s>
<s> I use Pegasus for my email.  </s>
<s> I've installed simple MAPI.  </s>
<s> It'd be great to use the forms and just press a button.  </s>
<s> Text mode is a bit complicated.  </s>
<s> Thanks a lot, Geoffrey Wheeler Director Centre for Vocational Building Technology (Under the auspices of the Isan Community Foundation) Kilometer Stone No. 147 Friendship Highway, Group 5, Ban Thin Tambon Ban That, Ampher Phen Udon Thani 41150 THAILAND Phone 66 (042) 24 8423 *** Please note new email address and phone number ****  </s>
<s> When you submit a form, use the submit button(s) already in the page...  </s>
<s> The "Get Selected Documents" button is reserved for LINKS, it does not do form submission...  </s>
<s> You might need to configure Netscape (4.x) to send mails using MAPI Thanks Clement Onime  </s>
<s> Dear Onime, Can you please help me.  </s>
<s> I live in a rural area of Northeastern Thailand.  </s>
<s> I have a special phone system which can connect to the internet but relatively slowly.  </s>
<s> I can maintain a connection for only about 8 to 15 minutes.  </s>
<s> Because of this I cannot download large files.  </s>
<s> The largest I can ususally download is 30kbytes.  </s>
<s> Sometimes I can download up to 65kbytes.  </s>
<s> I have never been able to download 1MB.  </s>
<s> My baud rate usually shows as 9600 bps.  </s>
<s> Actually I get much slower than that I think because other people are using the server.  </s>
<s> Is there any way I can schedule (for example using task scheduler on windows 98) a download for a time when few others are using the server.  </s>
<s> For example, at 3:00 am.  </s>
<s> If I was the only one using the server than I would expect to get a full 9600 bps.  </s>
<s> This would actually give me 576kilobytes per minute.  </s>
<s> I could download 1 MB in 2 minutes.  </s>
<s> For instance, I would like to download the following: which is 986 kb To download during the day time would take at least 1 hour.  </s>
<s> My only other restriction would be the phone system.  </s>
<s> At 3.00 am I would probably have full use of the interchange as well.  </s>
<s> If the interchange doesn't hiccup I should be OK. During the day, especially the afternoon, the line can have a lot of static.  </s>
<s> I would appreciate your comments and suggestions.  </s>

<s> Dear Geoffrey, I did not have planned any way of scheduling file downloads for www4mail, but now that you mentioned it, I think it is might be a useful idea.  </s>
<s> I will look into introducing it in the latest version of www4mail.  </s>
<s> However, there will be problems with Time-Zones, your time is about 6 or 7 hours ahead of mine and about 13 hours ahead of the Canadian server.  </s>
<s> So if a user requests a job to be done at 3 a.m, whose time-zone (server's or user).  </s>
<s> And also there will be other delays introduced by mail servers, which we cannot control!  </s>
<s> Now, immediately, I hope the following discussion might help you: I expect that you must be using www4mail for fetching files, in which case a 969K file will be split into blocks of about 300K (you can also use the GETSIZE option to set it to a lower value of about 60K).  </s>
<s> During the day, you can then configure your e-mail clients not to down load any mail message over 30 K in size.  </s>
<s> Then your mail client, will leave the (files or mails) on your mail server and only fetch the smaller mails, then at about 3 a.m, you can reconfigure your client to fetch mails over 30 K in size and it will then download all the files.  </s>
<s> This should work okay with a POP3 or IMAP server.  </s>
<s> Thanks Clement Onime  </s>
