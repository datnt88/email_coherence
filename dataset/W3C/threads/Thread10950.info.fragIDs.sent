<s> Reasons: CSS is awfully hard to fight at the moment, since both Netscape and Microsoft are working on it like mad, and potentially very vulnerable in a few months time if the design fails under pressure, as some of us suspect it will.  </s>
<s> Is there a way to avoid these notation wars?  </s>
<s> I'm wondering if, at the very least, we can sufficiently influence the concepts in the CSS-layout specification (which is still very much under development) so that they "align" with those of DSSSL-O.  </s>
<s> Perhaps we could attack through Java.  </s>
<s> It sounds bizarre, but right now Java is so heavily hyped that Java-anything is considered good.  </s>
<s> Ergo Netscape has declared "JavaScript Stylesheets".  </s>
<s> JavaScript is evil voodoo, but Java is actually not half bad.  </s>
<s> I am envisioning something we could call "Java stylesheets".  </s>
<s> It would be a DSSSL-like transformation that works on the source object and builds a screen display.  </s>
<s> The style sheet would be delivered as Java byte codes.  </s>
<s> The byte codes would have to have access to a much more powerful display layout API than they do now (fonts, layout, etc...much like DSSSL flow objects).  </s>
<s> Now there are a few different groups working on Scheme- Java, so we could deliver our DSSSL script as Java bytecodes and nobody would be the wiser.  </s>
<s> A war would have been averted.  </s>
<s> Principles: a) Scheme has a stigma (though I *really* like it, I can imagine Marc Andreesen snickering) b) DSSSL will have a scheme-stigma.  </s>
<s> c) DSSSL without scheme is, in my opinion, underpowered, just as CSS is underpowered.  </s>
<s> d) Java bytecodes put everyone on fairly level ground.  </s>
<s> e) Java interpreters are already widely deployed and getting more and more efficient.  </s>
<s> e) maybe once the document UI is controlled in Java there are some interesting interactive things we can do (expandable table of contents, for instance) Once Java-style sheets are implemented, CSS, DSSSL-O and full DSSSL could all be built on top of them, either by compilation *to* Java byte codes, or by interpretation *by* Java bytecodes.  </s>
<s> META-COMMENT Perhaps it is too early in our understanding of online style sheets to choose *any* standardized style sheet syntax.  </s>
<s> Look at the complexity of DSSSL-Print.  </s>
<s> It is only after *centuries* of typographic development that we knew what the right flow objects and characteristics to provide were.  </s>

<s> Anyway, aren't hyperlinks the next scheduled task?  </s>

<s> If Jon wants to get style sheet implementations by April, then we can't wait until too late to start discussing layout.  </s>

<s> The default style sheet language for the W3C SGML Web activity is dsssl-o (see the activity page).  </s>
<s> We don't need much discussion of that right now, but we do need some development if we want to demonstrate this by April; that's what I was suggesting.  </s>
<s> I hope you're right... Jon  </s>
<s> Ok but if that is a done deal, why is it a work item?  </s>
<s> I hope that comes up for debate.  </s>
<s> The CSS guys have their case to make.  </s>
<s> DSSSL-O has few implementations whereas XML gets quite a few with some simple adjustments.  </s>
<s> If a vendor chooses to support CSS, why should that make it impossible to support XML as well?  </s>
<s> Why isn't a stylesheet type on a par with any other notation, eg. as a MIME type?  </s>
<s> So do I but I've been through the debate before and it wasn't that simple to choose.  </s>
<s> Hyperlinking has some notable variants and existing standards.  </s>
<s> Tim is probably right that adopting some HyTime concepts will help.  </s>
<s> We might consider looking at the legacy out there, IOW, how many ways have hyperlinks been defined in existing SGML applications, where are they similar and different, and how can XML support these.  </s>
<s> While the work on DOCBOOK, TEI, Mosaic etc cited in your speech are examples, so is the preexisting and well documented and well-supported work done in MIL-D-87269, MID, proposals to MIL-PRF-28001, the Philly DTD, etc. BTW, for the Quran test file, is this right?  </s>
