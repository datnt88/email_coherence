Hi! I was wondering about the cloneNode method in the 980818 spec. 
As I read it, it says that it clones all attributes of an ElementNode, and all children of all nodes if it's a deep clone. 
However it also says that any other nodes except Element does only create a copy of the Node type without any data. 
Does this mean that for instance the subclasses of CharacterData nodes does not get their text-contents cloned? 
And how about tagName in Element and similar data? 
I think these kinds of data ought to be cloned. 
At least it's the only way to make a deep-clone which actually generates a copy of an entire subtree of a DOM node.

ANOQ, Congratz on your C++ DOM implementation. 
Actually the sentence reads: "Cloning any other type of node simply returns a copy of this node. 
" There is nothing about "without any data." 
When Comment, CDATASection, and Text nodes are cloned, their text contents are also copied for both deep and shallow cloneNode. 
Element.tagName is also cloned. 
I hope this helps, Don Park Docuverse Thanks! 
I guess I just misread or misunderstood it... My implementation should be correct then :) Cheers ANOQ of the Sun / Johnny Andersen E-Mail: anoq@vip.cybercity.dk or anoq@berlin-consortium.org Homepage: http://users.cybercity.dk/~ccc25861/
