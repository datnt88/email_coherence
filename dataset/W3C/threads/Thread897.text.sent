Is it possible to use Tidy to clean some html documents so that it automatically removes.... 
Any javascript Any styles and class references Any comments? 
Cheers, Julian Voelcker The Virtual World (UK) Limited Cirencester, United Kingdom Comments using the --hide-comments yes configuration option; there is no such option for scripts, styles or class attributes, you must either post-process the Tidy result or write your own Tidy application based on the library. 
I would use dsssl and openjade. 
This is a variation of the identity transformation with elimination of certain elements or attributes. 
Jany OK, thanks for the response.
