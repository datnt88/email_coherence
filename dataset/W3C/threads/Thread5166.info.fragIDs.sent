Just to be clear, since I'm afraid some people didn't catch the correction, Bijan was calling Tim's spec-stack argument [1] "otiose" (pointless, superfluous, wasted) [2] not "odious" (abominable, detestable, execrable) [3].

And I use it with the rather more neutral connotation of "superfluous". 
Which I believe is how it's most commonly used and the implicatures are quite polite. 
No "personal" attack was made; indeed, it's unfortunate that my deliberately neutral word choice didn't survive the phone line noise. 
Cheers, Bijan Parsia. 
Oops, sorry. 
As scribe I completely messed that one. 
"otiose" is not a word I've come across before. 
(I did think "odious" seemed an odd choice of word in the conversation, but didn't have bandwidth to stop and question.) #g
