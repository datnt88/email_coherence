Section 13.5.2 of draft-ietf-http-v11-spec-08 contains a minor self-contradiction. 
It first says that `A cache or non-caching proxy MUST NOT modify [...] Content-Length', and later says that `A cache or non-caching proxy MAY modify or add [Content-Length] in a response 
that does not include no-transform, [...]'. 
The problem is that the MUST NOT above is too strong. 
Here is a rewrite of the second half of section 13.5.2 which solves the problem. 
A cache or non-caching proxy MUST NOT modify the following field in a response: 
. Expires but it may add this field if not already present. 
If an Expires header is added, it MUST be given a field-value identical to that of the Date header in that response. 
A cache or non-caching proxy MUST NOT modify the folling field in a response that contains the no-transform Cache-Control directive, or in any request: . 
Content-Length A cache or non-caching proxy MAY modify or this field in a response that does not include no-transform, but if it does so, it MUST add a Warning 14 (Transformation applied) if one does not already appear in the response. 
A cache MAY add this header if not already present. 
If a Content-Length header is added or modified, it MUST correctly reflect the length of the entity-body. 
Note: a typical reason for adding the Content-Length header is that the origin server sent the content chunked encoded. 
A cache or non-caching proxy MUST NOT modify or add any of the following fields in a response that contains the no- transform Cache-Control directive, or in any request: . 
Content-Encoding . 
Content-Range . 
Content-Type A cache or non-caching proxy MAY modify or add these fields Koen. 
I propose to just remove Content-Length from the list of headers affected by "no-transform". 
This is OK -- the section already says that it may not be modified, and it it gets added, it has to reflect the true length. 
This meets the requirements of "no-transform", because the fidelity of the entity-body will not be affected. 
Paul Leach: 
Yes, I think just removing Content-Length from the list of headers would work, though I can't thorougly check it now. 
As far as I am concerned, the editor may choose either solution.
