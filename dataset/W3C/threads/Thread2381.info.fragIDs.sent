<s> Section 13.5.2 of draft-ietf-http-v11-spec-08 contains a minor self-contradiction.  </s>
<s> It first says that `A cache or non-caching proxy MUST NOT modify [...] Content-Length', and later says that `A cache or non-caching proxy MAY modify or add [Content-Length] in a response  </s>
<s> that does not include no-transform, [...]'.  </s>
<s> The problem is that the MUST NOT above is too strong.  </s>
<s> Here is a rewrite of the second half of section 13.5.2 which solves the problem.  </s>
<s> A cache or non-caching proxy MUST NOT modify the following field in a response:  </s>
<s> . Expires but it may add this field if not already present.  </s>
<s> If an Expires header is added, it MUST be given a field-value identical to that of the Date header in that response.  </s>
<s> A cache or non-caching proxy MUST NOT modify the folling field in a response that contains the no-transform Cache-Control directive, or in any request: .  </s>
<s> Content-Length A cache or non-caching proxy MAY modify or this field in a response that does not include no-transform, but if it does so, it MUST add a Warning 14 (Transformation applied) if one does not already appear in the response.  </s>
<s> A cache MAY add this header if not already present.  </s>
<s> If a Content-Length header is added or modified, it MUST correctly reflect the length of the entity-body.  </s>
<s> Note: a typical reason for adding the Content-Length header is that the origin server sent the content chunked encoded.  </s>
<s> A cache or non-caching proxy MUST NOT modify or add any of the following fields in a response that contains the no- transform Cache-Control directive, or in any request: .  </s>
<s> Content-Encoding .  </s>
<s> Content-Range .  </s>
<s> Content-Type A cache or non-caching proxy MAY modify or add these fields Koen.  </s>
<s> I propose to just remove Content-Length from the list of headers affected by "no-transform".  </s>
<s> This is OK -- the section already says that it may not be modified, and it it gets added, it has to reflect the true length.  </s>
<s> This meets the requirements of "no-transform", because the fidelity of the entity-body will not be affected.  </s>
<s> Paul Leach:  </s>
<s> Yes, I think just removing Content-Length from the list of headers would work, though I can't thorougly check it now.  </s>
<s> As far as I am concerned, the editor may choose either solution.  </s>
