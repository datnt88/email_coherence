<s> David, what do you mean by "it places a heavy requirement burden on the user."  </s>
<s> ?  </s>
<s> The user has to have real player installed, and he has to remember the keyboard shortcuts - so far no issues.  </s>
<s> But the biggest problem I see is in an audio interface implemented this way as a bunch of audio files is that when returning to a page, it starts playing at the top again.  </s>
<s> While a traditional screen reader interface will usually continue where you left off on that page - a big difference in my opinion.  </s>
<s> Of course a screen reader will also let you navigate around the page, not just listen in prerecorded sequence.  </s>
<s> And as with most prerecorded audio, there is little chance to change the synthesizer voices.  </s>
<s> I would characterize this site more as limited "interactive radio" on the web.  </s>
<s> Regards, Phill  </s>
<s> I won't have real player installed on my system.  </s>
<s> It is too invasive and the interface is not particularly user friendly.  </s>

<s> The user has to have high bandwidth and a sound card.  </s>
<s> This is not exactly in abundance nor is it within the reach of many users.  </s>
<s> We still need a screen reader to get to the site unless all we want to do with our 600 dollar pc is access that site.  </s>
<s> Also, no braille.  </s>
