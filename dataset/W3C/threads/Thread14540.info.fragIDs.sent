Wow, information overload. 
Daniel, Wendy and Katie in particular look quite different from other portraits of them that I've seen. 
Chaals and Gregory seem familiar (from RDF F2F, and Bristol DI pictures). 
Many of the others I've not seen before (and I've never met any of you)... But come on now, where's a picture of Chris? 
Surely he can't get off that lightly :-) Kindest Regards, Sean B. Palmer @prefix : http://webns.net/roughterms/ .

Antti's two interpreters, who were fantastic, were named Caroline (with longer blond hair) and Maya (with shorter, darker hair). 
I haven't seen the photos so I can't tell you which is which beyond that ;-) cheers Charles meeting2.jpg,

Thanks, Sean and Charles, A fine looking group, especially now that I can see who is who. 
And, younger looking than I'd expected!

Dang. 
One of the highest concentrations of "people I like a great deal" that I've seen for a long time. 
Sorry I couldn't make it, guys, Reef had to cut back on international travel this summer.
