Hi All, Again if there are pointers on this please direct me to appropriate resources. 
I've been experimenting with ways to ensure that a screen reader will read the correct text for things like edit boxes and such on forms. 
If I exclude the table references in the below example I hear all the text read as a prompt. 
If I include the table references I only hear the direct instruction to enter a name. 
What's the best way to code things so a screen reader will only read the direct instruction? 
Is my method acceptable? 
An edit box is where you type information. 
Please enter your name: Hi Kelly, this seems like a bug in your screen reader, although the code as included here is not valid. 
The table should not appear inside a paragraph, and you need the closing tag for the form... Cheers Charles Hi All, Again if there are pointers on this please direct me to appropriate resources.

I copied what I shared here from a longer document at http://www.teleport.com/~kford/formtest.htm that shows as a valid document when I test it. 
That document has the closing form tag and such but the table and paragraph stuff is identical to what I shared here. 
Kelly Hmmm. 
That would be a bug in the validator. 
(Albeit a fairly minor one, assuming the form element is closed in the original.) Unless I am interpreting SGML too strictly. 
The nice thing about XML is unambiguous syntax. 
Sigh.
