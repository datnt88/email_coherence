After having upgraded to Amaya 5.0 I experience problems with the validation of a HTML file an error: *** Errors/warnings in /home/reccmo/Musik2/GMD/ick-style.css line 8: CSS value ignored: none This line is found in a css style sheet ftp://sunsite.dk/projects/icking-music-archive/web/ick-style.css referenced by the HTML file. 
If I ignore the error and continue with externally editing and reloading the file the indentation gets in a hopeless mess:-( I don't get the error message with the previous Amaya release, and tidy doesn't complain either when I let it parse the file in question.

It should not be an error but maybe they are now issuing warnings on unimplemented functions such as a few that are outside the css1 core. 
But this is not outside core just unimplemented.

I'm afraid the problem is more serious than that. 
I've been able to repeat and reproduce the following behaviour: I load http://icking-music-archive.sunsite.dk/scores/Instr.html 
into Amaya5.0 after having had it parsed with no errors by Amaya4.3.2. 
Then I do a small change and save from within Amaya5.0, reload the file and find an extra ' dd dl ' inserted shortly after Bye Christian Mondrup, Computer Programmer Scandiatransplant, Skejby Hospital, University Hospital of Aarhus Brendstrupgaardsvej, DK 8200 Aarhus N, Denmark In that case Amaya doesn't report an error in your file. 
It only informs you that it doesn't interpret that CSS rule. 
This is new feature with the release 5.0. 
What "small change" have you done? 
The Amaya formatting is broken by the comment between the dt element and the dd element. 
We'll check how to fix it. 
Many thanks for your report. 
This bug was caused by the comment within the dl element. 
The correction is available in the CVS version and we'll publish a new release next week.
