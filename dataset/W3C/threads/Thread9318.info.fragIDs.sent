<s> Hi Dave, Just an idea, but can't we just simply specify that characters outside the US-ASCII repertoire are always encoded using UTF-8 and %HH-escaping?  </s>
<s> That would do http://www.w3.org/TR/charmod/#sec-URIs and simplify overall implementation.  </s>
<s> Anyhow, http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/ntriples/ is nice!  </s>

<s> Which falls foul of another rule, i.e. inventing a new escaping mechanism.  </s>
<s> (I assert that adding the ';' terminator changes the escape mechanism.)  </s>
<s> It is not clear to me that a fixed-length form like \uxxxx or \Uxxxxxxxx actually breaks the rule given above: it depends on one's interpretation of "delimiter": counting is a well-established way of delimiting values in some kinds of structure.  </s>
<s> Just an observation: I don't really mind which way we go (but also note that a compelling reason that N-triples is as it is is that existing N3 processors can read it).  </s>
<s> #g Graham Klyne Baltimore Technologies Strategic Research Content Security Group  </s>
<s> I concur.  </s>
<s> My reading of the rule is that the use of a special character as an 'end' delimiter should be avoided.  </s>
<s> BTW, are N-triples really only an in-group convenience, or are people thinking that we are going to endorse it as a public standard?  </s>
<s> If so, I would like to reconsider the line-oriented nature of the syntax, which strikes me as being archaic for a serious standard these days, and will break immediately the language is extended to anything more complicated.  </s>
