Hi, I am looking into the problems of making road maps on the net more accessible. 
Most solutions rely heavily on JavaScript, and that is probably necessary since speed is a big issue. 
I am more interested in how to make navigating the road maps more accessible for keyboard users. 
It is pretty easy to make functions like ZOOM and panning the map accessible and they sometimes are, but I have not yet seen a road map where all the basic functionality were optimized for keyboard users. 
It would help me a lot if some of you could point me to good examples of accessible navigation to road maps, or just point me to the better Map Services, from an accessible point of view. 
Cheers, Jesper Tverskov 
Where is the guideline that requires supporting ALL possible configurations. 
Do you also make the argument that all new MAC software must work on an Apple II? 
And let's not limit this to the MAC platform. 
Perhaps all new PC software should be required to work on a Commadore 64 or PC running an 8086 chip as well as it does on a PC using a P4 chip or the manufacturer should be hauled into court. 
Wonder if this would have any impact on software development.

- or - fix the one or two browsers that don't fully support the HTML 4.01 spec? 
For example, would it be more cost efficient for government to fund the improvement of Lynx than to mandate all the web applications to revert to HTML 2 days? 
I am also surprised at some of the "right's" arguments. 
Individuals I talk to who have disabilities prefer to have access to what everyone else 
how many people with disabilities have you talked to in the third world?? 
has access to, including web application using scripting. 
Most individual's who have disabilities do not want to be ghettoized to use some other less capable web application. 
Individuals who have disabilities NEED the faster client side scripting just like everyone else. 
They want to come in the front door just like everyone else. 
We are dealing with a WORLD WIDE WEB. and I emphisize the WORLD WIDE part. 
in many parts of the world people especially people with disabilities have very limited bandwidth and service and cannot afford to deal with the HUGE resources required to use the more "modern" browsers. 
in at least one contact (an independent living center) I have in Nicaragua they are still linked to the web with a Apple II, and an acoustic coupler. 
can you even support scripting at 1200 baud??? (offered em a newer modem but the telephone lines wouldn't handle it) THESE people need access to the web maybe even more than we do. 
and we must continue to support thier access.

There are at least two reasons why it might not: 1) if the software worked on Apple ][ there would be no reason for people to spend money on the Mac. 
That benefits only Apple, but is one of the primary reasons for the continual changes in Windows (I believe that Microsoft own significant numbers of Intel shares, so they benefit from hardware upgrades as well as software upgrades). 
2) occasionally, there might be some real value to the user that could not be provided within the constraints of the Apple ][, but note that we still use speech even though it is thousands of years since we invented writing; we still use reference books, even with animated online guides; for information communication, new presentation techniques often don't make communication any more effective. 
Windows will still allow you to read plain text documents, like this email.

Web pages are supposed to be documents, not programs. 
Even for software development, many of the changes brought about by faster processors have been in cosmetics, not in real capability. 
Moreover, as I keep saying, one of the key design principles for HTML was that it should work on anything. 
This might not be in the formal specification, but it was certainly in the original concept paper. 
That paper, for example, says that there is no place for colour in HTML - colour being a fairly standard feature of commercial document, and presentation, authoring tools of that time. 
HTML was well behind its time in terms of gloss features, as a deliberate matter of policy. 
Most people these days don't realise what were its true defining characteristics. 
Commercial users probably should not be using it, although academics and governments have better matched requirements.
