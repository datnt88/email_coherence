Things have been very quiet on the cookie front. 
I have been busy with other projects, but I am now able to return to the fray. 
At issue is how to make progress on a successor to RFC 2109. 
One proposal is to split draft-ietf-http-state-man-mec-03 into two pieces: 1) a description of the wire protocol; and 2) a description of the privacy considerations of cookies. 
The second document would comprise approximately these sections of state-man-mec-03: - 4.3.5 
Sending Cookies in Unverifiable Transactions - 7 Privacy The groundrules would be that each of the two documents could/should be discussed separately, but that the IESG would not allow either to become an RFC until agreement had been reached on both. 
I'm soliciting discussion of this approach before I invest the time to split the document in two. 
What do you think of this approach? 
Dave Kristol If the IESG will not move them forward except in tandem, I don't really see the point in splitting the draft. 
Has the IESG indicated that they would prefer this approach because they might later be revved independantly? 
Or is there pressure to do this so that implementations could claim compliance with the wire protocol without claiming compliance with the privacy sections? 
To quote one of the Appl. 
Area Directors: "The point of serializing these efforts is to focus the working group's discussion." 
In other words, you can nail down the wire protocol without getting side-tracked by arguments about privacy stuff, and vice versa. 
So you could do one first, then the other, but neither would progress to RFC until both sets of issues had been settled. 
Dave Kristol I'm not sure I see the point of splitting the document if the wire protocol document can't progress w/o the privacy portion. 
Furthermore, I believe portions of the wire protocol are meaningless w/o the privacy portion. 
And, given that there were privacy concerns to begin with which motivated the privacy related restrictions, I think we would need concensus from everyone who feels strongly about the privacy restrictions that the wire protocol can go forward w/o the privacy specifications. 
Otherwise, there is no point in splitting the document because it doesn't address the composite issues which motivated the specification in the first place. 
Dave Morris Perhaps I am not paying close enough attention, but I don't see the sections that you mean. 
The strict 'how do you keep state' requirement seems to split on the adminstrative level from the 'who is entitled to receive that state' at the next metalevel up. 
It is possible for some kinds of proposals that have not been placed on the table at this time (things like cryptographically certified lists of specific machines entitled to recieve the state) could mix the two levels, but right now they are still seem quite seperable administratively. 
Could you give an example of something in the current proposal that mixes the two levels? 
Or are you suggesting that the split will block the exploration of options such as the one I mentioned? 
Benjamin Franz An alternative proposal is to take the signed cookie draft and combine it with the protocol draft and put that up as the standard. 
That way we don't have to argue over heuristics which prevent legitimate functionality and instead use a policy based system backed up with authentication. 
Yaron This alternative would not be a complete solution since it would drop the default specification for cookie privacy when the cookie presented was not signed. 
I have no problem with an alternative which includes completing work on the signed cookie proposal but I see that as additional specification and not replacing some form of the existing privacy specifications. 
Dave Morris It wasn't so much that the text in the document were intertwined, but rather that the arguments on the mailing list(s) about the technical and privacy issues got intertwined. 
The idea was to disentangle them and deal with them separately. 
The hope was that doing so would lead to some measure of progress. 
Dave Kristol I understand the concerns regarding unsigned cookies but at the same time I do not believe we can create restrictions that are not arbitrary. 
For example, the two hierarchy level restriction. 
As such I believe the best we can do is state "You want security? 
Use a signature." 
How many systems do you know that go out of there to specify security in situations where the user intentionally chooses not to use any security?

It was the best solution we found, and the other privacy restrictions in the RFC were intended to make up for this compromise. 
I do not agree that the privacy restrictions are arbitrary, though I would be foolish but to agree that they are controversial. 
Security is not the same thing as privacy. 
There are plenty of systems that protect privacy even if the user does not explicitly request privacy protection. 
That is my understanding of the intent of the privacy restrictions in the cookie rfc.

To members of the HTTP-WG@cuckoo.hpl.hp.com mailing list: Please do not post additional messages on the subject of 'cookies' UNTIL THERE ARE NEW DRAFTS. 
When there are new drafts, we will discuss them one at a time. 
I reserve judgement as to the order. 
Larry (attempting to moderate WG mailing list traffic). 
The combination of the wire protocol and privacy concerns regarding cookies led to quite a divergence from the technical landscaping of the draft in working group discussions. 
That is why splitting the two issues out seams most reasonable. 
At least this way it will be crystal clear what is at issue in a discussion: the semantics of the protocol or the political/privacy/security/whatever ramifications of cookies. 
All the wire protocol portion would need to address in order to accommodate its other half is a mechanism (if necessary) for allowing whatever is decided (if anything) in the privacy draft to take shape. 
If nothing more than a tool to facilitate concise discussion about the two directions of the current draft, it should be split. 
Judson Valeski As I've said before, I don't think this would be a positive step. 
If we're having trouble making progress on the current specification, trying to make progress on an even more complex one will be that much more difficult. 
I agree with Dave Morris's point that not all applications need or want signed cookies. 
I prefer to regard the signed cookies proposal as an add-on. 
I think it can mesh relatively smoothly with the (successor to) RFC 2109. 
Dave Kristol I'm unsure what you mean by "led to quite a divergence from the technical landscaping of the draft..." Were the privacy provisions all present in Netscape's original proposal? 
No, but some were. 
And if you're implying that the privacy concerns were never discussed adequately on the list, that's simply not so. 
Dave Kristol Privacy - I get scared whenever a public organization tries to decide what appropriate "privacy" is. 
That is a consumer decision, not an IETF one. 
The IETF's job is to provide secure interoperable protocols, not to decide for users what the appropriate level of privacy is. 
Consumers make choices, they choose to use one product over another. 
It is in that choice that they choose how to protect their privacy. 
That choice includes choosing products which default to accepting all cookies. 
2109 - The problems with the current spec have nothing to do with complexity. 
They have to do with an attempt to patch a fundamentally broken protocol. 
Building a cookie mechanism on signed cookies provides a protocol which delivers security without interfering in the UI and feature decisions of software makers.

This comment strikes a chord with something I caught on the radio (BBC Radio 4) yesterday -- a program about privacy and privacy legislation. 
One of the concluding comments was that privacy rules only work (or have meaning) in a fundamentally trusting environment. 
Without the widespread expectation and honouring of trust in dealing with private information, people would simply stop giving out such information. 
This suggests that privacy is and must be a "consumer decision", and the technical infrastructure needs to provide a framework for that choice to be exercised. 
(Or people may stop using that framework?) (On a personal note, I run my browser with cookies disabled, so I get a prompt every time I hit a site that asks to set a cookie. 
A consequence of this is that some sites which set large numbers of cookies often get abandoned after the 4th or 5th such attempt.) GK. Graham Klyne GK@ACM.ORG 
There has been no substantive discussion about Stage Management since release of the -04 draft, because all of the bugs in the current RFC were fixed in the -03 draft and consensus had been reached on the technical issues, *and* because the few paragraphs that commented on privacy issues were nothing more than advice to implementors, and also were fine as they stood. 
I realized you were asked by the Chair to do this, but it appears, in fact, simply to have stalled progress. 
Can it now be put back together again, and move on to Draft Standard status?
