<s> I've just finished installing Amaya Release 1.2.  </s>
<s> I love the concept of a joint browser+editor program, but I've noticed the following problem: {Note: I'm using a Pentium 166 MMX with 64 MB RAM, 6 GB HD w/1.30 GB free space, Windows95 running in 24 bit color mode at 800x600 resolution.  </s>
<s> I've also examined the mail archive, but I didn't see anyone having this same problem.}  </s>
<s> Everytime I click on a link to load up a new HTML document, my System Resources plunges dangerously.  </s>
<s> For instance, after a clean boot up of Windows, I have 85% resources free.  </s>
<s> After loading up Amaya 1.2, the percentage decreases to a reasonable 81%.  </s>
<s> After loading up document (for example, one of the manual pages), the system resources dips to 67%! Clicking to follow a third link, I find the number decreasing to 24%.  </s>
<s> After browsing more than four pages, the system invariably locks up, forcing me to reboot the machine.  </s>
<s> I've tried accessing other web sites and HTML documents in my hard drive, but the machine loses its system resources (sometimes down to 3% before hitting 0%, according to the "Help" screen under the "About" menu in Windows File Explorer).  </s>
<s> It doesn't matter if the subsequent web pages are displayed in a new Amaya window or the same one; the system resources level is not recovered even when I exit Amaya.  </s>
<s> I'm aware that earlier versions of Microsoft Word had this same problem with recovering system resources.  </s>
<s> Have you experienced this problem before?  </s>
<s> Is there a patch?  </s>
<s> Can I do anything else to minimize the resource leaks when running Amaya?  </s>
<s> I am running a similar system and have experienced the same problem.  </s>
<s> I am running a Pentium 166 MHz with 64MB SDRAM, 7 GB disk space, 1 GB free, 24 bit color 1024x768, Windows version 4.01.970  </s>
<s> (Win95 OSR 2.1 plus updates).  </s>
<s> I can't view more than two or three pages without the system dying.  </s>
<s> I start at 80% free, dropping down to about 13% before the system grinds to a halt and starts issuing Resource warnings.  </s>
<s> It starts issuing an unending string of error messages.  </s>
<s> The only recovery is to hard reset the system.  </s>
<s> I had just noticed this several days ago, as I haven't used Amaya for a few months.  </s>
<s> I don't recall any problems when I first installed Amaya several months before.  </s>
<s> I used it for several hours one evening after installing.  </s>
<s> The only major difference between now and then is the RAM.  </s>
<s> I was running 32MB 70ns FPM, now I am running 64MB 12ns SDRAM.  </s>
<s> The only other changes relate to various peripherals that I have installed.  </s>

<s> Hi, This problem is related to Win95 (it's not the case if you use Winnt).  </s>
<s> I'm working on that.  </s>
