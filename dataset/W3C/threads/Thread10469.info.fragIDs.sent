<s> Issuette: Should we change the term: "plain literal" to mean a literal of just a lexical form, and then have a new term "language tagged literal"?  </s>
<s> Possible text based on a 'yes' to this question is:  </s>
<s> Section 6.5 RDF Literals A literal in an RDF graph contains one or two named components.  </s>
<s> All literals have a lexical form being a Unicode [UNICODE] string in Normal Form C [NFC].  </s>
<s> Language tagged literals have a lexical form and a language tag as defined by [RFC-3066], normalized to lowercase.  </s>
<s> Typed literals have a lexical form and a datatype URI being an RDF URI reference.  </s>
<s> Plain literals do not have a language tag or datatype URI.  </s>

<s> The rest of the goofy literals proposal is more-or-less as in: with possible knock on effects of the terminology change with plain literals.  </s>
<s> (Note some of these knock on effects occur in semantics and are quoted in the issue resolution below.  </s>
<s> The equivalent text in 2003May/0151 is with the meaning of plain literal unchanged).  </s>
<s> Further note: the wording used, which actually caused the comment, is intended to be suggestive of a many sorted logic to prevent confusion between say a language tagged literal and a typed literal, or a plain literal and a uriref.  </s>
<s> I avoid being explicit about this because: (a) I think it is overkill solving a problem that isn't really there - this is obvious (b) the complexity of explaining a many sorted logic is greater than the benefit in clarity (c) I believe the wording in semantics allows the separation of the domain of discourse questions from the abstract syntax questions.  </s>
