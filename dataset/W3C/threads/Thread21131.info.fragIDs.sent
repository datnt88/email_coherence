Well, you can run Amaya on the Mac under OS X (it can be compiled or you can use fink for an easy if slow install). 
Likewise you can use something like emacs or vi. BBEdit lite used to be good if you only ever wanted to edit source.

Vim (http://www.vim.org) has pre-compiled binaries for the mac. 
It supports syntax highlighting for many languages and has loads of other features. 
Personally, I don't use the syntax highlighting, but I know it does a pretty good job. 
If you're not a vi user, there are also GUI versions that allow a little more "usual" interaction model in addition to the keyboard commands.
