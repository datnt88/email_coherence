<s> Well, you can run Amaya on the Mac under OS X (it can be compiled or you can use fink for an easy if slow install).  </s>
<s> Likewise you can use something like emacs or vi. BBEdit lite used to be good if you only ever wanted to edit source.  </s>

<s> Vim (http://www.vim.org) has pre-compiled binaries for the mac.  </s>
<s> It supports syntax highlighting for many languages and has loads of other features.  </s>
<s> Personally, I don't use the syntax highlighting, but I know it does a pretty good job.  </s>
<s> If you're not a vi user, there are also GUI versions that allow a little more "usual" interaction model in addition to the keyboard commands.  </s>
