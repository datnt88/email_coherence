I was just looking at the cross links between the docs - I think we got about 2/10 on that one - only Syntax has links to the last call WDs everyone else is linking to old versions, sometimes very old versions Let's try and do better next time! 
Jeremy 
Jeremy, Can you be more specific. 
We can make corrections within the first 24 hours, I believe. 
Eric has just been slaving to do a number of corrections. 
Are there more we need to do?

I just looked through the references on each doc - the ones Syntax were by far the best.

Similarly for Test Cases, Semantics, Primer Jeremy 
Jeremy-- Can I refer you to part of a thread in which I thought the Chairman had decided some things about the form of the references, like we were going to use initials rather than full names, in the *trailing position*, etc.? 
This is why the references in the Primer are in that form (and a *!@*$%@! 
pain it was too!). Can I please ask that we either explicitly allow anarchy on this issue, or make a decision on how the *!@*$%@! 
references are supposed to look, and stick to it?
