I would like some opinions / ideas about how to skip repetitve links -- which are server-side includes. 
We have a framed web site. 
At the bottom of every page in the "main content" frame, we are using server side includes to include a file of text links for navigational purposes. 
We are using the server-side includes to make maintenance more feasible. 
Since the links are at the bottom, we can't put a link to skip over them. 
Without having to change the layout of the page -- and put the links at the top, does anyone have an idea of how we can make it easy for a disabled person using a screen reader -- to skip these links?

Since the user cannot see the end of the page 
they do not know the links are at the bottom. 
Possibly an image with an alt="Page footer begins" (a stretched color square to immitate a 
horizonal rule) and an option of a link to the 
"top" or "back".

As I said in my initial message -- A screen-reader, such as "JAWS", will read every line of every page, therefore, will read these repetitive text links from every page -- at the bottom,

If the links are at the bottom of the page, why do you need to skip them? 
At a guess, I'd say it's because over-reliance on the mantra "let people skip links" -- which is some folks' interpretation of section 508 -- leads to illogical and nonsensical results such as this one.

David, I agree with Kynn's comments on Jim Thatcher's site, which has navigation in the final column of a layout table: 
Jim's site itself is an excellent example of this; while he does have a "skip to main content" link, it doesn't actually skip over any navigation links, just a few headers that define what the site is about. 
(In actuality, I don't think he even needs that link, which only skips two lines content.) Note, however, that a strict reading of 508 regulations could lead you to assume that Jim's site is deficient (or would be, if it were a government site); the 508 rule on "skip links" is: (o) A method shall be provided that permits users to skip repetitive navigation links. 
...and since he doesn't allow for skipping of navigation links (just of two headings) maybe he's in violation? 
I think not, though, since it says "a method shall be provided" and I feel that the layout of his page _is_ that method. 
By putting the links at the end of the page rather than at the beginning, you have arguably provided a method for skipping them. 
Depending on the page itself, perhaps it would be useful to include a link just before the bottom navigation allowing visually impaired users to "skip bottom navigation - return to top of page", but that depends on the page itself and how you expect visitors to use it. 
(Actually, if you're talking about http://www.sti.nasa.gov/, 
I see that you've already got a "return to top of page" link right before the bottom nav.) If your pages contain "last updated" and "contact" information below the bottom navigation menu, you would probably want to provide users with a method for skipping the navigation and jumping straight to the "last updated" line. 
A skip-nav link right before the SSI would do it. 
By the way, I don't see why the fact that these links are SSIs should make any difference to the user. 
It all comes out as HTML on the user's end anyway.

I'm not sure I understand. 
when I use jaws, if the linav links are at the bottom of the page, I can just stop before I get there and go to the next page.

An approach we use when building sites -specifically- for screenreaders (thanks to transformable user interfaces) at Reef/ Edapta goes something like this. 
Each "chunk" of content is labeled with a title. 
This might be "main content" or more likely a descriptive title such as "Description of our Services." 
Another chunk might be "Sidebar: More About Our Health Plans". 
A navigation could be "Navigate Our Site" and another might be "Explore This Section." 
Each chunk is given an "index number" as well to indicate the relative importance within the page. 
These chunks are all stored in an in-house XML format, and then converted to the appropriate markup language for output to a variety of devices. 
When we identify a user as employing a screenreader, we create an interface which builds a menu at the beginning, in priority order. 
In the example sketched out below, this would produce a page like this: Welcome to Our Medical Company 1. Description of Our Services 2. Sidebar: More About Our Health Plans 3. Explore This Section 4. Navigate Our Site Those are all hypertext links to anchors further down in the page. 
We feel that this has several useful effects: (1) It allows direct access to the primary material of the page, which is the -main- reason for a "skip links" requirement in the first place. 
(2) It allows direct access to navigation and other content on the page by building a navigable menu which does not exist in the graphical version of the site. 
(3) By virtue of being a "virtual table of contents" for a page, this approach allows a screenreader user to capture that very important aspect of web surfing that is often lost: Context. 
As has been stated in this thread, often a screenreader user has to experience the entire page before knowing that she's reached the end! 
The contents listing gives her the necessary knowledge of what's on the page before she listens to the whole thing, which is also useful so that she can identify if she is at the right place. 
Note that most of these benefits are actually closer to "usability" than "accessibility" -- without them, the content is _still_ there, and _can_ be accessed, it's just not the best interface possible for that user. 
And the "best possible user experience" is our ultimate goal (at Reef); we don't want to think of ANYONE as being deserving of less than a well-designed UI. Which of course begs the question of "is this the best interface"? 
I think it probably is, but honestly neither Reef nor Edapta has had much time or money for doing usability testing yet. 
So your comments on this would be appreciated. 
The topic of "how do you design a good UI when you know you are dealing with a SPECIFIC audience with disabilities, not designing a one-size- fits-all UI" is mostly unexplored territory. 
I know all about how to make a graphical UI that "degrades gracefully" to a poorly done screenreader UI; that's old hat and we've been doing that for years. 
The challenge facing us at Reef is one of thinking outside the "universal design (of an interface)" box and looking instead at what is the _best_ interface rather than the _compromise_ solution. 
Comments, feedback? 
Volunteers to play with our test sites, once we get them up and running?
