<s> Just using recorded audio and expecting people to listen to it is probably of dubious benefit - it often interferes with people's speech technology.  </s>
<s> Since people need their speech systems running to get as far as your pages, they are more likely to turn off your audio than theirs - so you would be doing a lot of expensive recording that your stated target audience aren't going to appreciate at all.  </s>
<s> Your advice on having decent structure seems to be more valuable in this case.  </s>
<s> I would suggest there is little point just recording the audio unless you have some expectation that the work will be done to use it in a more advanced audio format provided (and of course maintained) as an alternative version - a significant undertaking.  </s>

<s> Dear all, I would caution about making sweeping generalizations about audio formats and about their utility.  </s>
<s> It is also important to look at the specific application and goals and then determine the correct approach.  </s>
<s> For example, if you are trying to provide not only basic access, but a fantastic reading experience, you may choose to produce an audio version using the DAISY specifications (www.daisy.org).  </s>
<s> If you can produce the full text and full audio using a talented narrator, , this provides a fantastic reading experience.  </s>
<s> Reading poetry with synthetic speech is not nearly as good as listening to a well done audio presentation.  </s>
<s> Many types of literature benefit from this approach.  </s>
<s> I would agree that having the text, produced using the WAI guidelines in XHTML for Web based delivery is a great approach.  </s>
<s> Other types of materials may benefit by using a different XML vocabulary.  </s>
<s> The DAISY specifications are based on W3C standards and use SMIL as the  </s>
<s> foundation for the synchronization.  </s>
<s> six types of publications are described.  </s>
<s> One type is the text with the navigation model; Bookshare.org uses this approach.  </s>
<s> Many organizations have volunteers available to do narration, but do not have the full text; this is the case for Recording For the Blind &amp; Dyslexic rfbd.org.  </s>
<s> Some documents, like a dictionary benefit by having much of the material as text and portions, such as the pronunciation of words, captured with audio.  </s>
<s> It would be great if the full text and full audio could be there most of the time, but choices have to be made considering all the factors.  </s>
<s> If we are talking about forms, Al's posting from a few days ago sounded  </s>
<s> like a good approach to explore.  </s>
<s> The DAISY specifications have not included forms or interactive completion of content (workbooks) as of yet, but work continues in expanding the scope of material covered by DAISY's work.  </s>
<s> Hope this helps.  </s>

<s> Thanks sb  </s>
<s> Let's take that in reverse order:  </s>
<s> I would like to know whether or not anyone is using recorded audio, especially with the goal of improving accessibility for visually impaired end-users... and I'd like to hear how it went/is going.  </s>
<s> Absolutely.  </s>
<s> This is a long-standing practice called talking books.  </s>
<s> But it goes on in parallel with the web.  </s>
<s> The audio is distributed in audio media ranging from cassette tape to CD ROM.  </s>
<s> It is useful for print-impaired users more generally than just those with visual disabilities.  </s>
<s> Last I heard RFB&amp;D had more dyslexic subscribers than blind subscribers.  </s>
<s> This is the community that formed the Daisy Consortium to bring their practices into the digital age.  </s>
<s> That group has been careful to frame their standard as a system of publishing coordinated text and sound.  </s>
<s> For the present time the actual books distributed are just converting over from all audio with very limited navigation to audio plus a navigation infrastructure (hypertext table of contents, to the layman) that may just identify major navigation destinations in the volume.  </s>
<s> But for reference volumes, it is essential to provide the full text and the navigation infrastructure to find an entry rapidly.  </s>
<s> One is tempted to think that your manuals are in this category.  </s>
<s> This community looks forward to using the Internet as a distribution channel *in the future.*  </s>
<s> If the University system is contemplating publishing manuals and catalogs on CD ROM they should definitely consider the talking book standard as the format to use.  </s>
<s> This will give you the 'find it' support to allow the superior audio of a recording to be a plus and not a resented frivolity.  </s>
<s> I would like to know whether or not recorded audio is something I should be looking at as a viable way of improving accessibility of web content.  </s>
<s> As Charles said, the answer to this question depends on the objectives of the material that might be recorded.  </s>
<s> But generally speaking, for people with visual disabilities, the answer is probably 'no.' Better to take the money that might be used to pay the readers to record the texts and pay an editor to review the labels on the forms, for example.  </s>
<s> For people with other print disabilities, who haven't already gone native in the dialect of their screen reader voices, it could be a genuine plus, if done right.  </s>
<s> For the work you are doing for your customers, a "work process re-engineering" approach is the right framework for deciding where to apply recorded audio and where it is not worth the trouble.  </s>
<s> In particular this involves looking at what the students and employees with print disabilities will need to do with the information so published, and how they can do those tasks in the context of their laptop and screen reader.  </s>
<s> My customers believe there is value in providing recorded audio versions of textual content.  </s>
<s> We appreciate that you are reluctant to sound insubordinate.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, when there is good news and bad news, you owe them both.  </s>
<s> Don't make it sound like you are telling them what to do.  </s>
<s> But don't tell them less than what you know.  </s>
<s> By now you should appreciate that screen reader users may well greet steps in this direction with hostility.  </s>
<s> "Wasted frivolity, a sop to the ego of the producing activity," or some such reaction.  </s>
<s> Because for someone who is accessing Web content with their computer where they have installed and generally use a screen reader to mediate their access to the applications on that computer, the substitution of site-recorded audio for client-side-synthesized speech is likely to be more nuisance than boon.  </s>
<s> And it is unlikely to improve the go/no-go accessibility of the content for these users one iota.  </s>
<s> Partly it is a matter of the nature of the content.  </s>
<s> If I recall correctly, you first mentioned manuals and forms.  </s>
<s> This sort of content biases the expectations against the sound file gambit.  </s>
<s> The Daisy book deals with novels that you want to drop in and just listen to.  </s>
<s> The only navigation used may be simply to resume where you left off.  </s>
<s> And it also deals with dictionaries and encyclopedias where the text form dominates the value of the access.  </s>
<s> The important part of the task is finding the right entry to read, not cruising the whole thing.  </s>
<s> There are a lot of sample-and-decide cycles that are accomplished in visual browsing entirely by the user random-accessing the display screen without the computer being involved or aware of these decision process steps.  </s>
<s> The same "isolate the section I need" process in screen-reader-assisted browsing use navigation steps closed through the computer: navigation commands that alter the course of the display.  </s>
<s> The absence of persistence in the audio medium means that the user is making many more discrete navigation commands (counting one pointing gesture with the mouse as one command) than in visual interaction.  </s>
<s> To the computer, the eyes-free user appears more active in the interaction, although it is really because much of the action in the case of the visual user is subliminal to the user and hidden from the computer.  </s>
<s> Preserving the functionality to micro-manage the locus of "you are here" is a precondition for any improvements in audio verisimilitude being a gain and not a loss.  </s>
<s> Naive attempts to turn pages into sound files without internal structure would be a setback in access to the information for the kind of information that is in many web pages.  </s>
<s> It sounds as though these manuals could be more like encyclopedias than novels.  </s>
<s> In a given visit to the resource, the user will only want the full text of a small part.  </s>
<s> The name of the game is isolating the right part fast; not how natural the voice is that reads the part you need.  </s>
<s> Likewise, one possible transaction is cutting a course number from a course catalog and pasting it in the list-box search function to select that course in the registration form.  </s>
<s> The number of potential courses is too many to listen through a list that one could review effectively by eye; one will want to use something clipped from the catalog in the text-entry option in a combo box or the search-for-option function in a list box.  </s>
<s> An audio recording of the reference volume is significantly inferior for this trasaction, which is what the student needs the information in the course catalog *for.*  </s>
<s> The student would have to carefully record and re-enter the course number which is bad news for both time to complete and likelihood of error.  </s>
<s> One of the factors that we haven't discussed is that the Web is behind the CD ROM domain in dealing with such synchronized text and audio.  </s>
<s> The W3C has a Multi-modal Interaction Working Group working on how to express the binding of the recorded sound into web pages in a way that works well.  </s>
<s> But the Web isn't there yet.  </s>
<s> We lack the format smarts to blend the superior sound of a recorded voice with the user-directed browse of the manual or user-originated fill-out of the form at the right level of granularity and justInTime play.  </s>
<s> Don't get your back up and lecture your customers.  </s>
<s> But don't let them go ahead down the road to an ugly surprise without trying to clue them in.  </s>
<s> As Cheryl Trepanier said, "People are adapted."  </s>
<s> The people who use screen readers are adapted to the speech patterns of the synthesizers installed with their screen reader.  </s>
<s> The 'obvious' superiority that the lay person perceives in the recorded voice over the synthesized voice is generally a negligible difference in the accessibility of the information.  </s>
<s> The dialect- dependent poetry of Robert Burns or Dylan Thomas are more accessible in the human-spoken word.  </s>
<s> But forms and manuals?  </s>
<s> Most likely not.  </s>
<s> Your mileage may vary.  </s>
<s> You may find a consumer group and an audio format that yields access gains beyond what I have suggested here.  </s>
<s> Just a review of the best current practice in terms of applying recorded readers to information access by people with print disabilities is somewhat cautionary in terms of applicability to the Web.  </s>
<s> Talking books are transcriptions of things designed to be books.  </s>
<s> The related media-melding technologies and design standards for things designed to be websites have yet to be developed, so far as I know.  </s>
<s> Al  </s>
