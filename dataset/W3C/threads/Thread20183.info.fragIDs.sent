<s> I am thinking that it should be possible to save to ftp://somewhere/some/file via ftp.  </s>

<s> I agree that ftp put is not a high priority for the Amaya team, becuase HTTP put is so much better.  </s>
<s> But if an outside contributor were to provide a patch, it would make the tool more readily useable by people who don't have access to proper servers, provide demonstrations that there are other people who think working on Amaya is cool, and perhaps provide an expanded user base from which further patches can come.  </s>
<s> So I think your approach is very sound.  </s>
<s> If I am work on the patch with some help from a friend then a useful product might be some further documentation on the architecture of Amaya and how to work on it - what happens where.  </s>
<s> (and to the practical: I found a test for supported protocols that seemed to allow the inclusion of ftp, and a PutObjectWWW function that passed back a file to be put by the libwww library functions.  </s>
<s> It seemed that the libwww FTP functions would need  </s>
<s> to be included as well as the core HTTP functions.  </s>
<s> I couldn't find a test for whether there should be a PUT or a simple save - that seems to be the same place that you would test for the possibility of doing an FTP put (based on the URI I guess).  </s>
<s> I plan to look at it again when I have had more sleep (than none) - it didn't seem as though it wuld be terribly complicated to do.  </s>
<s> cheers  </s>
