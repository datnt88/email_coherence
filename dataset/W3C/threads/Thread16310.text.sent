Hi, Charles How does a user tell lynx to display it? 
Scott Scott, this sounds like precisely the kind of function that led the authors of HTML to include provision for something like LINK rel="Help" href="aboutEverything" hreflang="en" This works very well on such hi-tech browsers as Lynx, and does not require any magic popups. 
It is documented in the HTML 4.0 spcification fairly clearly. 
If this had been implemented by the people who agreed that it should be part of a recommendation, or asked for before people went off into proprietary solutions, we would have a very simple method of getting help about pages. 
(It is still in the spec...) Charles McCN Presumably it is a configuration option - it just does it automatically to me.
