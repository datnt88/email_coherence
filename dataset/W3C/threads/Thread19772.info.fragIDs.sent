I've been having a look at the 1.1c version of Amaya on Linux. 
X server is XFree86 in case that's relevant. 
However, Amaya seems to totally ignore the charset parameter on the HTTP Content-Type header and always assumes iso-8859-1. 
This seems to contravene the HTTP/1.1 spec (RFC 2068), section 3.7.1: 
"HTTP/1.1 recipients MUST respect the charset label provided by the sender; [...]" 
(See URL:http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2068/rfc2068 for full text). 
Admittedly Amaya's HTTP request says HTTP/1.0, but the documentation on www.w3.org appears to say it supports HTTP/1.1. 
Also, Amaya doesn't recognise "&amp;uml;", and the warning message displayed to the console reports 'Invalid entity "&amp;um"' (i.e. it misses off the 'l'). 
Here are some example pages to play with: This has the same sample text available with the server configured to report different character sets.

Hello Olly, 
In our previous episode, Olly Betts said: 
In its current state, Amaya doesn't interpret all of the HTTP headers which describe the body, and in particular, the charset header. 
On the other hand, Amaya interprets the charset when it's specified inside the HTML document. 
We're currently upgrading our HTTP interface to improve this. 
What kind of platform are you using? 
Amaya does send HTTP/1.1 requests. 
Perhaps you're going thru a proxy? 
That's right! 
This bug has been fixed up and will disappear in the next release. 
Thanks for the URL :) I'll use in my tests. 
Cheers, -Jose

Nope, I was just being dense and read the wrong line in the server logs. 
It's Netscape 4 which sent the HTTP/1.0 requests. 
Sorry for any confusion caused. 
Cheers, Olly
