<s> I've been having a look at the 1.1c version of Amaya on Linux.  </s>
<s> X server is XFree86 in case that's relevant.  </s>
<s> However, Amaya seems to totally ignore the charset parameter on the HTTP Content-Type header and always assumes iso-8859-1.  </s>
<s> This seems to contravene the HTTP/1.1 spec (RFC 2068), section 3.7.1:  </s>
<s> "HTTP/1.1 recipients MUST respect the charset label provided by the sender; [...]"  </s>
<s> (See URL:http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2068/rfc2068 for full text).  </s>
<s> Admittedly Amaya's HTTP request says HTTP/1.0, but the documentation on www.w3.org appears to say it supports HTTP/1.1.  </s>
<s> Also, Amaya doesn't recognise "&amp;uml;", and the warning message displayed to the console reports 'Invalid entity "&amp;um"' (i.e. it misses off the 'l').  </s>
<s> Here are some example pages to play with: This has the same sample text available with the server configured to report different character sets.  </s>

<s> Hello Olly,  </s>
<s> In our previous episode, Olly Betts said:  </s>
<s> In its current state, Amaya doesn't interpret all of the HTTP headers which describe the body, and in particular, the charset header.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, Amaya interprets the charset when it's specified inside the HTML document.  </s>
<s> We're currently upgrading our HTTP interface to improve this.  </s>
<s> What kind of platform are you using?  </s>
<s> Amaya does send HTTP/1.1 requests.  </s>
<s> Perhaps you're going thru a proxy?  </s>
<s> That's right!  </s>
<s> This bug has been fixed up and will disappear in the next release.  </s>
<s> Thanks for the URL :) I'll use in my tests.  </s>
<s> Cheers, -Jose  </s>

<s> Nope, I was just being dense and read the wrong line in the server logs.  </s>
<s> It's Netscape 4 which sent the HTTP/1.0 requests.  </s>
<s> Sorry for any confusion caused.  </s>
