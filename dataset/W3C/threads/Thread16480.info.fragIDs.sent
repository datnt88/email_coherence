<s> Hi Phill, The LABEL construct is inadequate when the labeling text comes from two (or more) places.  </s>
<s> The simplest example is when the form elements are in a table and the headers are, in effect the labels.  </s>
<s> E.g., I think the question of labeling input elements shouldn't be merged with questions of making header information available for table cells.  </s>
<s> The use of these is different by assistive technologies.  </s>
<s> Also the forms I have seen in tables are not as simple as my example above.  </s>
<s> You asked about multiple labels for one INPUT element.  </s>
<s> That is part of the issue and it is forbidden by 4.01.  </s>
<s> Also you may want one label to contribute to more than one input element; there's no way to even write that.  </s>
<s> This is why I argue the title attribute on INPUT elements is a good, practical and simple solution.  </s>

<s> What?  </s>
<s> The label doesn't redirect anything, it only makes an association.  </s>
<s> Focus is always on the control and occasionally, depending on the browser and the HTML coding, the visual focus indicator, the little dashed box, surrounds both the label and the control.  </s>
