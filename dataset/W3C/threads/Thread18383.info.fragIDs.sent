Dear Working Group, I would like to thank everyone for their hard work in getting the document 
to CR, but participation is still very important. 
We have come along way 
in the past three years in the development of the guidelines and we need 
everyone's participation in the next few months to turn the requirements of 
UAAG into reality for people with disabilities. 
It is important that people attend telephone conferences, face-to-face meetings, and take and 
complete action items for evaluations, test suites and techniques. 
I look 
forward to everyone's continued participation. 
Let me know if you plan on attending the 4 October teleconference.

Why is there no archiving of the teleconferences, or live streamed audio from them? 
The telephone is invasive, you have to give it its full 
attention, and have to really be available for the entire discussion, whilst having the discussion streamed live, gives little opportunity for immediate response, it does mean people who aren't able to attend through other commitments to at least to be able to monitor and either add their views to the list afterwards, or just pick up the phone and join directly. 
The Minutes are also very "dry", and you don't really get a full appreciation of the discussion, being able to listen to how the discussion actually went can I imagine save a lot of confusion for people who didn't attend. 
Jim.

We've never tried. 
I think there might be some technical issues (e.g., size of data to store, format of data would probably be proprietary, etc.). 
I'm not sure that we want that type of teleconference. 
An effective Working Group is composed of people who attend regularly, do the homework, and are prepared for discussion (or just to listen, but attentively). 
If people are not interested in participating regularly, then we invite them to subscribe to the mailing list. 
Whether the meeting minutes are text or archived audio, people are always invited to comment on the minutes after the meeting. 
I agree that one can learn a lot by listening to the audio. 
The minutes are not supposed to capture everything, just the essentials and the decisions of the group. 
I would not want to have to listen to 2 hours of audio in order to find out what the group decided on a particular issue; I prefer having the short text minutes, that (as a sighted reader) I can skim. 
I think that recording the meeting is an interesting idea, and offers some advantages, but I don't see it as a replacement for text minutes. 
I will enquire as to the technical feasibility of doing an audio feed. 
Meanwhile, one mechanism that we use regularly within W3C but not with the UAWG is IRC. 
We have not had requests to have live text minuting of the discussion. 
Since I am the (dry grin ) minute-taker, I am willing to take minutes directly on IRC, but so far there has been no demand. 
Would this be useful to you? 
Or are you mostly interested in the audio feed? 
Thanks for the comments, - Ian Ian Jacobs (ij@w3.org)
