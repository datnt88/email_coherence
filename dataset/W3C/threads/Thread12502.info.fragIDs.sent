<s> Hello, On yesterday's CG call, Jon Gunderston elaborated on a proposal he has made to hold one or more workshops in order to publicize the UAAG work and generate interest for future work: The suggestion was made that our group (AUWG) might benefit from participating in such a workshop, in effect making it a Web Tools accessibility workshop.  </s>
<s> Thoughts?  </s>

<s> I read the workshop e-mail: and I agree both groups would benefit, but the real need is to crisply identify the purpose of the workshop.  </s>
<s> I assume it would actually be a "W3C workshop" with position papers, etc. [see note 1], but Jon's e-mail suggest more of a conference session.  </s>
<s> If it's more of an education and outreach session to developers, then I don't think it really replaces the f2f need of our charters.  </s>
<s> If it's more of a W3C workshop with position papers, then I would be more inclined to support it.  </s>
<s> Both could occur at a conference along with informal birds of a feather sessions.  </s>
<s> Some seggestions for the W3C style workshop "Accessibility and Web tools": - my product's support of UAAG/ATAG and strategy for future support.  </s>
<s> - my company's strategy for support of UAAG/ATAG - my company's vision for support of accessibility (more broad than UAAG/ATAG) - my view of the industry's support of uaag/atag (comparison, research) [note 1: W3C Workshops &amp; Symposia Regards, Phill Jenkins, IBM Accessibility Services  </s>
