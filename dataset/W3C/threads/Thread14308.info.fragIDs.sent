A regular working group meeting will be held on Thursday, 20 hours Coordinated Universal Time, +1-617-252-1038 Agenda: Continuation of the discussion surrounding the recently circulated WCAG draft. 
A revised draft may be released in time for the meeting, incorporating changes suggested by Gregg Vanderheiden and taking account of points which have emerged from recent working group deliberations. 
Also, Charles questioned the need for having an "overlayer" of "Principles" to which my answer is that if we make them sufficiently general/abstract it will be almost mandatory that these be in a class of their own with subsumed guidelines, checkpoints, and techniques/examples. 
Incidentally, I cannot find Jason's "Principles" from the GL home page? 
I must reiterate that there should be some place we can all look at the *latest* version under consideration - hopefully without all the "boilerplate" of a W3C document. 
Just the Principles at this time, please! 
Love.

Please add to the agenda a discussion of the early October Face2Face meeting?
