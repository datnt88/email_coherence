<s> Both the validator at w3.org and tidy fail to detect errors of the type style="{color:red}" form.  </s>
<s> Amaya hangs up rather  </s>
<s> than treating it as a parse error.  </s>
<s> and it was a toughy to track down!  </s>
<s> Can the three tools be repaired to trap this type of error.  </s>
<s> i am not suggesting making Amaya tolerant but it should detect and issue warning rather than hanging.  </s>
<s> John Russell, VE3LL@RAC.CA Please send complaints to my legal reps Dewey, Cheatum &amp; Howe ATTN: Sue Alotte  </s>
<s> I don't know if it's defined as an error by the CSS and (X)HTML recommendations (is one allowed curly brackets in attribute values?  </s>
<s> certainly square brackets seem to be allowed); I'm sure there must be folks  </s>
<s> at W3 lurking about who will know.  </s>
<s> But the brackets are unnecessary and not standard practice.  </s>
<s> I did post but maybe it went astray -- anyways I have carbonned this one there!  </s>
<s> Sure.  </s>
<s> Why didn't you post this to the list?  </s>
<s> I think it never occurred to them that anyone would use curly braces in inline styles.  </s>
<s> From: "John Russell" ve3ll@rac.ca  </s>
<s> the worse part is that they cause Amaya to HANG UP! If they are legit then Amaya has to cure the hang If they are not then Amaya has to cure the hang and place a line in the parse errors view to indicate the problem.  </s>
<s> And if it is an error tidy and validate crew should be informed so their tools can be corrected... Bugs that crash or hang Amaya should be very high priority and usually an intermediate release comes out if they are there.  </s>
<s> But it is so close to next release that repair may just get rolled into it.  </s>
<s> John Russell, VE3LL@RAC.CA Please send complaints to my legal reps Dewey, Cheatum &amp; Howe ATTN: Sue Alotte  </s>
<s> It's fixed in Amaya now and there is an error report form the CSS parser in "Views/Show parsing errors".  </s>
