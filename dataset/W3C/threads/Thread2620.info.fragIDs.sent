<s> Is there a document that describes HTTP/0.9?  </s>
<s> What I am particularly interested in is the format of the request line (there were no headers, right?).  </s>
<s> RFC1945 documents HTTP/0.9.  </s>
<s> The format of the request is (was): Simple-Request = "GET" SP Request-URI CRLF and the response format was: Simple-Response = [ Entity-Body ] with no version numbers, no response status line, and no request or response headers.  </s>
<s> Based on my reading of some server source code, I believe that instead of a Content-Type response header, the older browsers apparently understood a tag like PLAINTEXT to indicate non-HTML responses.  </s>
