This is a brief final review of *all* the RDF Core documents (not just the Primer) as of the CVS versions indicated. 
I note that *all* the documents now have the same SOTD, which means that *none* of the documents are explicitly indicated as being normative (see below). 
There are also a few other issues in some of the documents that may or may not be considered problematic. 
Primer Rec CVS 1.44 All the SOTD and References look OK now. 
The Change Log is OK. Section 7.2 of the Primer, in describing Test Cases, says "The test cases are not a complete specification of RDF, and are not intended to take precedence over the normative specification documents." 
On thinking about the discussion on the meaning of "normative" earlier last week, I suppose someone could read this as saying that Test Cases is *not* normative. 
If that's a concern, simply changing this to: "The test cases are not a complete specification of RDF, and are not intended to take precedence over the *other* specification documents." 
would be a simple fix. 
Leaving this alone doesn't bother me if it doesn't bother anyone else. 
Concepts Rec CVS 1.70 SOTD: This SOTD is the same as that in the Primer; there is nothing here that indicates the normative status of the Concepts spec. 
All the links and other material seem OK. References: seem OK In the Change Log, under "References", there's a "TODO" at the end. 
To reduce confusion, this should probably either be done or removed. 
Semantics Rec CVS 1.69 SOTD: This SOTD is the same as that in the Primer; there is nothing here that indicates the normative status of the Semantics spec. 
All the links and other material seem OK. References: seem OK Syntax Rec CVS 1.64 SOTD: This SOTD is the same as that in the Primer; there is nothing here that indicates the normative status of the Syntax spec. 
All the links and other material seem OK. References: seem OK The Change Log lists changes as of the 23 January 2003 last call WD, not the PR version. 
Test Cases Rec CVS 1.83 SOTD: This SOTD is the same as that in the Primer; there is nothing here that indicates the normative status of the Test Cases spec. 
All the links and other material seem OK. References: seem OK The Change Log lists changes since the 20010912 WD, not just the PR version. 
There is also an Appendix B, "Open Issues" that has a bullet "complete the test cases", which suggests the Test Cases document is not complete. 
This should probably be deleted (both here and in the Table of Contents). 
Vocabulary Rec CVS 1.64 SOTD: This SOTD is the same as that in the Primer; there is nothing here that indicates the normative status of the Vocabulary spec. 
All the links and other material seem OK. References: seem OK The Change Log lists changes as of the 23 January 2003 last call WD, not the PR version. 
--Frank Thanks for the careful review, Frank. 
As I understand the process, these kinds of changes are made (at this point, after PR) at the discretion of the Director, rather than by WG decision. 
However, it would be good to know if anyone on the WG sees any problem with any of these changes. 
They all seem good to me, except the idea that the SOTD should say something about normativity. 
As I understand it, to the extent that normativity is conveyed explicitely, it should be in the document main text, or in parenthetical expressions on the section titles. 
And that kind of change is potentially substantive, and so not appropriate here and now. 
I like this change. 
I like this change. 
I'm ambivalent on this. 
There's not wrong with listing old changes, although they are a bit of clutter. 
Ambivalent, ditto old changes.

-- sandro Sandro-- The reason I mentioned the "normative" business was that at one point the second sentence in the SOTD of the documents said "It is a stable document and may be used as reference material or cited as a normative reference from another document." 
(This seems to be standard boilerplate for other W3C normative specifications as well.) 
There was also a statement above that for translations that said that the English translation was the normative one. 
I think these sentences were removed as a result of my pointing out that the Primer wasn't normative. 
However, it seems to me that they *are* appropriate for the other documents. 
However, it's really not a big concern to me. 
I was just pointing out that some changes that were appropriate for the Primer seemed to be carried over to the other documents as well, and I wondered whether that was intentional. 
--Frank snip That's OK with me. 
I have to say, though, that a lot of the email traffic having to do with getting the Recs finalized could have been eliminated if the Editors (or at least *this* Editor) had been better informed as to what was going on. 
--Frank Thanks for catching that - I can't remember what was todo, but either it ot done or it didn't!
