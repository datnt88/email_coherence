<s> The ERB has received a certain amount of grousing from people disappointed at XML's not using MIME or FSI machinery to specify language encoding.  </s>
<s> The reasons for this are twofold:  </s>
<s> 1. Non-network access [This is obvious] a lot of XML files are going to be stored in files and accessed by means other than HTTP, and some encoding signalling mechanism is obviously required.  </s>
<s> Also, we wanted something that was simple, easy to explain, and could be done by anyone with whatever editor they were using.  </s>
<s> 2. Distrust There is, on the ERB, a pervasive lack of trust in the reliability of Mime and other external/metadata encoding signaling devices.  </s>
<s> This is felt particularly intensely by me, based on my experience in processing many millions of HTML pages for the Open Text Index, and by Michael Sperberg-McQueen, based on his years of work in a highly heterogeneous  </s>
<s> networked computing environment.  </s>
<s> I, and I'm sure many of the rest of us, have enjoyed the beneficial effects of Mime technologies in recent years; but if you're doing anything large-scale on the Web, if you rely on external metadata/signalling in general, you're dead - or more formally, your receiving application will suffer an unreasonable number of failures due to various botches and bogosities.  </s>
<s> The reasons for this are, in my experience, a combination of incompetence in website administrators and lack of education in document authors.  </s>
<s> Personally, I think that with  </s>
<s> a *combination* of mime, metadata, and careful examination of the first few bytes of the file to see if any reasonable interpretation of the bit patterns generates something like ' ?XML', we have the tools in place for XML processors to offer more reliable access to heterogeneous multilingual distributed data than anything else I'm aware of.  </s>
<s> We're just specifying the language.  </s>
<s> Although the ERB hasn't voted on this, it seems self-evident that a good XML processor should make use of whatever information might be available external to the language [be it a resource fork or an HTTP header or whatever] to do the right thing.  </s>

<s> MIME headers would meet this requirements, if they are allowed in the file.  </s>
<s> See my earlier posting for an elaboration of this proposal.  </s>
<s> We can make the metadata in the document supersede the data in the HTTP header, if that will improve reliability.  </s>
<s> Then people will stop using the internal headers for HTTP delivery, once they are no longer needed to make things work because of improved HTTP implementation and practice.  </s>
<s> I no longer trust in self-evidence.  </s>
<s> Let's make a (simple) rule.  </s>
<s> Good sense and character set issues never seem to go together.  </s>
<s> I'm sure people will implement naming conventions for XML file suffixes and the like, and we need not worry about that, but we're talking about data that is _essential_ for the document to be processed.  </s>
<s> That cannot be left to the implementers ingenuity.  </s>
<s> (They'll be far to ingenious for their own good!) Neither of these arguments will fly in the Web technical community, unless they can see that we are not tromping on the (sensible) infrastructure that is already defined.  </s>
<s> A brand new character set syntax and self-identification technique tromps, in my opinion.  </s>

<s> That is still insufficient justification for the PI hack.  </s>
<s> You could have just as easily recommended the *.mim format.  </s>
<s> I am vehemently against *data* sniffing.  </s>
<s> If the PI is a header, say so, and then give it a different syntax.  </s>
<s> I cannot see this as justification for the PI hack either.  </s>
<s> Broken software is just that: broken.  </s>
<s> I know, probably better than anyone on this entire list, what the exact dangers are with WWW content labelling mechanisms.  </s>
<s> I also know what the potential is for correctness, and how to overcome a lot of the bogosity/idiocy.  </s>
<s> I do not see the PI hack as a necessary part of this solution, though I agree with the overall *concept* of having a header (which is what it really is).  </s>
<s> I understand the problem you are trying to solve, and understand how your answer tries to solve it.  </s>
<s> I do not think that the problem gives sufficient justification for the answer proposed, though, and think that cleaner mechanisms, both semantically, and syntactically, and both preferrable, and likely to be widely used *irrespective* of XML adoption.  </s>
<s> Let's not repeat the META idiocy here.  </s>
