<s> Hi David, Thanks for all the work on this.  </s>
<s> A couple suggestions on this general topic:  </s>
<s> 1) In the guidelines themselves, I think it would be nice to have the  </s>
<s> links, but have the big long sentences would make it unduly long.  </s>
<s> How about if after every item in the guidelines, we just simply have 2 one-word links.  </s>
<s> Perhaps they could be in square brackets to set them off but they would be in the same line as the guidelines so they wouldn't use up an extra vertical line of space.  </s>
<s> For example:  </s>
<s> [Checklist] [Techniques]  </s>
<s> 2) Traffic cop really does cause people problems and also sounds like  </s>
<s> Bobby, which is not let that function would be  </s>
<s> I don't have a good final suggestion but some ideas to get us thinking.  </s>
<s> - Locator - Technique Locator - Customizer  </s>
<s> 3) On the second illustration where you show the two flow pads off of  </s>
<s> the guidelines, the first box is the guidelines and the last box at the bottom is either the techniques or the checklists.  </s>
<s> Between them are two boxes which have a description but not a name.  </s>
<s> Aren't these really the techniques gateway document and the checklist gateway document?  </s>
<s> If they are, we might just label those boxes on the diagram with those names and then put the function in parenthesis underneath them.  </s>

<s> Hi Gregg  </s>
<s> techniques. what is the purpose of the techniques gateway ?  </s>
<s> Wendy has been working with Shawn from the Authoring Tools Working Group.  </s>
<s> Shawn is in charge of the WAI web site revision.  </s>
<s> She has extensive experience in usability and she conducted usability studies of WAI documents.  </s>
<s> Several of Shawn's key findings include the following: 1) People become disoriented when they are thrust into the middle of a separate document.  </s>
<s> (i.e., bouncing from a guideline in the Guidelines document to the middle of a long techniques or techniques gateway document) 2) Users want a quick effective way to find technology specific techniques that apply to guidelines (without being thrust into the middle of those techniques documents) In preparing for our work, I interviewed 25 Government webmasters who depend on WCAG.  </s>
<s> I also interviewed Frances Grenier of the Kansas State University Accessibility Centre.  </s>
<s> She is on the State wide accessibility committee for the Kansas State Government &amp; University web sites.  </s>
<s> Frances has heard dozens of comments from web masters who depend upon WCAG.  </s>
<s> The primary complaint that Shawn, Frances and myself have found is that it is difficult for users to find their way through all the WCAG documents.  </s>
<s> They don't want to be linked to the middle of a big long technical document.  </s>
<s> They want to quickly chose from all of the technology specific methods available to meet a guideline and see what they have chosen.  </s>
<s> The Locator/Cop is an attempt to meet the needs of our users who are out there working with these documents every day and also to meet the needs of users who do not have an intimate knowledge of the documents and their  </s>
<s> interrelationships such as us on the committee.  </s>
<s> Before the locator/cop, the "Techniques Gateway" was slated to take on 2 different functions: 1) to provide technology independent techniques (such as "how to write a good caption")  </s>
<s> 2) to direct the user to technology dependant documents to meet guidelines  </s>
<s> It has become apparent to some people on the Techniques committee that these two functions work against each other.  </s>
<s> If we are to provide quick, simple access to technology specific techniques then we need to provide a simple menu where users can choose the technology they want to fulfill a guideline  </s>
<s> rather than sending them to the middle of a long Technology Independent document and then force them to fish around for links to technology dependant documents.  </s>

<s> Wendy has been working with Shawn from the Authoring Tools Working Group.  </s>
<s> Shawn is in charge of the WAI web site revision.  </s>
<s> She has extensive experience in usability and she conducted usability studies of WAI documents.  </s>
<s> Several of Shawn's key findings include the following: 1) People become disoriented when they are thrust into the middle of a separate document.  </s>
<s> (i.e., bouncing from a guideline in the Guidelines document to the middle of a long techniques or techniques gateway document) 2) Users want a quick effective way to find technology specific techniques that apply to guidelines (without being thrust into the middle of those techniques documents) In preparing for our work, I interviewed 25 Government webmasters who depend on WCAG.  </s>
<s> I also interviewed Frances Grenier of the Kansas State University Accessibility Centre.  </s>
<s> She is on the State wide accessibility committee for the Kansas State Government &amp; University web sites.  </s>
<s> Frances has heard dozens of comments from web masters who depend upon WCAG.  </s>
<s> The primary complaint that Shawn, Frances and myself have found is that it is difficult for users to find their way through all the WCAG documents.  </s>
<s> They don't want to be linked to the middle of a big long technical document.  </s>
<s> They want to quickly chose from all of the technology specific methods available to meet a guideline and see what they have chosen.  </s>
<s> The Locator/Cop is an attempt to meet the needs of our users who are out there working with these documents every day and also to meet the needs of users who do not have an intimate knowledge of the documents and their interrelationships such as us on the committee.  </s>
<s> Before the locator/cop, the "Techniques Gateway" was slated to take on 2 different functions: 1) to provide technology independent techniques (such as "how to write a good caption")  </s>
<s> 2) to direct the user to technology dependant documents to meet guidelines  </s>
<s> It has become apparent to some people on the Techniques committee that these two functions work against each other.  </s>

<s> In the Jessica example you have: 1) The first link she sends is here: This actually takes you to a checklist gateway for a particularly guideline.  </s>
<s> I was envisioning a Checklist Gateway that is not guideline specific and allows you to select a technology.  </s>
<s> I then assumed that Andy would pick the HTML or CSS set of checklists.  </s>
<s> But, this gets back to how the checklists are organized - is it possible to have all of the checklist for one technology in the same document?  </s>
<s> One other minor nit in the diagram is that I expected Andy to print an HTML checklist.  </s>
<s> You have the printing from the techniques (which is also a good idea) branch.  </s>
<s> I just wanted to include printing so we would think about it when we designed the checklist page.  </s>

<s> I think the idea of separating the Techniques Gateway into two chunks is a good.  </s>
<s> That way the Gateway/Locator can focus on just getting people to where they want to go.  </s>
<s> And the Technology Independent Techniques could do its job of  </s>
<s> showing people the principles of good Captions etc.  </s>
<s> I realize we may want the "Technology Independent Techniques" more prominent than "Technology Specific Techniques."  </s>
<s> If so here's one idea: All XSLT generated pages could include a section titled "Things to Remember" that would list Technology Independent Techniques that are relevant.  </s>
<s> If we want "Technology Independent Techniques" the at the same logical level as the Technology Specific Techniques they would just be one more choice from the menu of Techniques.  </s>

<s> Our current thinking is that the "traffic cop" is a new independent  </s>
<s> document.  </s>
<s> The document currently called Gateway to Techniques is tentatively renamed "Technology-Independent Techniques".  </s>
<s> Instead of being between the Success Criteria and the technology-dependent techniques documents (as a "Gateway" between guidelines and techniques), it would exist at the same  </s>

<s> The "traffic cop" is a central place to tie things together so we don't have to deal with everything linking to everything, and it expands and replaces that part of the role that we previously thought the Gateway to Techniques to could fill.  </s>

<s> I hope my explanation helps to clarify, not muddy, things for those who haven't been on the Wednesday calls.  </s>
