Hello Fabio, Great translation. 
But please make sure that you do the following (from http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/IPR-FAQ.html#translate): 
Prominently disclose in the target language the following 3 items: 1. the original URL, the status of the document, and its original copyright notice. 
2. that the normative version of the specification is the English version found at the W3C site. 
3. that the translated document may contain errors from the translation. 
In particular 3. and the original copyright notice are missing. 
I will then add your translation to the list on the XML page. 
Regards, Martin.
