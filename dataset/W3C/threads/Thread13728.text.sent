I just tried this tool for the first time. 
On first reading, I had expected it to perform automated online tests, in the manner of Site Valet or Bobby. 
When I found the response to be very slow, I naturally thought it was fetching and analysing my page. 
But I find it's a purely manual process. 
It seems to me that if this tool becomes popular, it could easily be abused (intentionally or otherwise) to "cry wolf" with bogus reports. 
Indeed, I could even use it as a spam machine, by pointing a 'bot at it and causing it to crawl the web and mail messages 'from' Site Valet or any other such service to webmasters. 
Most of the tests implied in rep3.cgi 
*can be* easily automated. 
Can I suggest that automation be built into the service where possible, to help users prepare reports and - more importantly - avoid generating bogus reports that could devalue the service / bring it into disrepute. 
I've got the software, so I can put my money where my mouth is here. 
If anyone would like a more detailed proposal, let me know. 
Nick Kew Beyond that, it seems that your participation in the WG would be a big plus for accessibility. 
We need all the help we can get! 
Love. 
ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE Thanks. 
A few weeks ago I went through the motions of expressing an interest in joining the WG, and had a very brief reply from Daniel Dardailler welcoming me. 
Since then I've discovered a problem I didn't quite anticipate: the weekly telecons are scheduled as 90 minutes at peak- time international call rates, and I simply can't afford to do that on a regular or semi-regular basis. 
But I am willing and able to help with the development of WAI/ER tools, if that can be arranged, and if this group really is more receptive to offers of help than for instance the Validator (to which I have offered various things in the past; most recently a fix for a bug that has been discussed on www-validator before now, and which Liam had up-and-running in the WDG validator within about an hour of my announcing it). 
Some of the Site Valet software could fairly easily be re-used to automate a range of checks in the WART (and I daresay some of Bobby could be used to similar effect). 
So it would seem to make sense for me to take a look at it. 
Nick Kew Nick, That would be great for you to help out with the report tool. 
As for calling in... I'll talk about that in a separate thread.

Maybe I should have a look at the source.

It keeps getting mentioned on the lists in two completely different contexts: 1) as a completely finished language that can already be output, and 2) as a develpment by ERT that needs a spin-off group devoted to it (the "friday group"). 
[Note: While I would like to join the "friday group" , I certainly can't get to the meeting, and I still have no way of even getting onto a call...] As far as I can tell by reading through the archives again and looking at the ERT homepage, we have a great deal of discussion about uses etc., but not too much about syntax. 
The most worrying thing is that we have an architecture, but no RDF Schema yet... Daniel made a list of some of the properties needed; could some one look at the ontologies of these, and we should be able to make a Schema fairly quickly. 
Then anything that outputs EARL will have something to conform to: a syntax.

There are a couple of candidates. 
I described one a year ago that has a set of properties, a schema (thanks DanConnolly), a bit of a toy in javascript that can use the properties (with its own prolog-like syntax for amking queries) that Dan Brickley made based on Jan Grant's tiny prolog interpreter. 
This works for basic confromance statements, but needs something else to add things like "who said", and "when" and "how do they know". 
I imagined that Dublin Core would be good for the first two, and AERT would provide a set of tests which have URIs that we could use for the latter. 
There is a desire to produce a more complete EARL - based or not on this earlier one is unclear. 
The meeting on Thursday morning at the W3C plenary will apparently be dedicated to just this task. 
That's as far as I have understood the story. 
Cheers Charles McCN What's the status with EARL currently?

Location: I-cubed, 110 Victoria Street, Carlton VIC 3053, Australia (or W3C INRIA, Route des Lucioles, BP 93, 06902 Sophia Antipolis Cedex, France) hi all [* danbri is trying wretchedly to catch up on this thread] If someone could send me a summary of where things are up to with EARL inc URLs, (and what exactly it is...) we might be able to revisit the Prolog demo, which has improved in capabilities lately. 
Also ILRT now have an RDF query engine in development which runs server-side (no fancy inference stuff though), so that might be useful. 
See Libby's demo at thanks for any pointers your former lurker, dan Everything we have is linked to from http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/IG/#earl 
There isn't a great deal of stuff, only my overview, and Len's uses and BNF cogitations. 
ILRT now have an RDF query engine in development which runs server-side (no fancy inference stuff though) Aw... I want an inference engine! 
Anyway, I'll check this out.

Jan's just hacked up a Javascript RDF parser (alpha) to hook into the clientside RDF/SW prolog-based inference and query contraption we used above. 
Still being polished / debugged for announcement, but since the topic came up, here's a pointer: related links: (for logic/inference fans, Sean...) some more experiments I was doing (partly superceded by XJG stuff) have fun, Dan ps. yep, been lurking here a while; don't manage to read everything but will pop up if I think I can be useful...
