passcode 9224 irc.w3.org 6665, channel #wai-wcag This weeks agenda will be focus on Ian's comments and the Conformance issues and strategies that we didn?t 
get to last week. 
1 - Ian's posting. 2 - Should there be intermediate between 1 and 2 and 3 (Current requirements doc conformance statement says yes so if we come to different consensus we need to change requirements doc) 3 - Should definitions of how we sorted into levels 1, 2 and 3 be updated? 
- do we want to stick with L1 is only invisible 4 - Should checklists be normative? 
What are the issues? 
5 - whether conformance should be based on technology status at time WCAG becomes official or whether we should lean into the future. 
See you Thursday.

What is the typical function to bookmark a page using the various screen 
readers? 
Is there a keyboard function to set a page as one's home page using the various screen readers? 
If there is, what is it? 
Thanks, Lee

Regrets 
Screen readers sit on top of another application, and present the output as voice. 
Sometimes they also add new input or control functions. 
But generally they rely on the underlying application. 
So bookmarking and so forth are left to the individual browser, and the screen reader doesn't have any functionality for it. 
(Nor is it relevant to screen readers). 
Talking browsers such as WebSound, BrailleSurf, or Home Page Reader, will have functions.

JAWS 5.0 has a bookmarking feature of sorts: users can set markers at specific points on Web pages, then jump to those points. 
These markers can be saved, and even shared with other users. 
Haven't used this feature much, but it's interesting that it exists.
