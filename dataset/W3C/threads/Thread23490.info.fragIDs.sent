Dear Mr.Webmaster: I'd like to use the whois-search facility for getting e-mail addresses through your e-mail-server, but I cannot. 
I got the helpfile from your server, but it's no help about whois. 
"Accessing The Internet By E-Mail", or "Guide to Offline Internet Access" describes the technique, but it just do NOT work on your server. 
If there is some document about how whois works on your server, please, be so kind and send it to me. 
Furthermore, I know usually not only the names, but also the street-adresses, although I do not know where or how to use this info in the search for e-mail.. Sorry to bother you but I gave up the fruitless trials, as I just take up the space and time on your server. 
Automatically But Truly Yours: Erik C. Heber 
Dear Heber, Please I would like to have the following information: 1. 
What is the URL of thw whois gateway that you are trying to USE (beause you should use a web gateway to make your queries) 2. Can you determine if the failure was * remote server problems (Error reports or something similar) or * www4mail generated problems (coding of your data ?) or * Wrong form of data input (Were trying to use a direct URL for a page that uses POST?) Okay, Finally please send me a copy of your request and the reply from the www4mail gateway. 
Thanks Clement Onime 
Finally, I almost forgot, if you are using the Browser Interface, please submit form data using the Submit button provided, Not the "Get Selected Document(s) Button" If you must use text mode you can try the following block (4 lines) Note that you enter what you want to serach for after the searchstr= XFORM FORM METHOD POST ACTION http://www.dooki.com/cgi-bin/whois.cgi 
searchstr= XSUBMIT_NOW=Search XFORM /FORM Thanks Clement Onime
