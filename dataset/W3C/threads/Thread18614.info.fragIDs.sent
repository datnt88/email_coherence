<s> 1) Customized bullets for list items -- this is addressed by CSS1 and it would be silly to add this now as an HTML attribute.  </s>
<s> Yes, and the CSS mechanism is more powerful as it supports inheritance of list-style among other things.  </s>
<s> 2) Ditto for button appearances  </s>
<s> Well, not quite.  </s>
<s> The static border look functionality is present (CSS border-style) but the simple pressed/depressed setting using two images that Greg is proposing would have to be done thru scripting in the current spec, which is harder.  </s>
<s> I don't know if Greg has looked at the new BUTTON element in FORM.  </s>
<s> 3) Field groupings-- this is something that is much needed.  </s>
<s> In the summer of 1995, Dave Ragget and I had worked on this and come up with an extension to the forms spec-- that took a back seat while Dave worked on tables.  </s>
<s> Many of those ideas have been folded into an extended forms proposal for HTML (from Microsoft no less) --and I am not sure where that is in the HTML4 work train.  </s>
<s> FIELDSET and LEGEND are in HTML4 FORM.  </s>
<s> I would focus on making sure that that work meets all accessibility requirements and more rather than introducing an accessibility specific field grouping tag.  </s>
<s> Yes, the HTML4 spec is now available and waiting for more review.  </s>
<s> The other extensions in Greg's document cover: - issue with logical ordering of markup, which Al Gilman has already proposed to as a new work item (private mail, on my stack) - issue with TABLE orientation, which needs to be folded in our TABLE work item.  </s>
<s> I like Greg's "HTML Presentation of Tables" document, it has examples :-) PS: Greg, could you send me your documents in HTML, so that I can make them readily available thru our WAI WG site ?  </s>
<s> Greg Lowney has rightly recognised the importance of providing a mechanism by which specific structural components of a document can be presented in a different order depending on the display medium.  </s>
<s> An important question to consider is whether this purpose can best be achieved by an HTML extension of the kind proposed, or whether the presentational order of a document would be better controlled by style sheets.  </s>
<s> The CLASS and ID attributes, together with the DIV container element can be used, as Greg Lowney has noted, to identify various block-level components of the document.  </s>
<s> The order in which they are to be displayed in different media, however, could be specified by style sheets.  </s>
<s> I understand that there already exists a draft style sheet specification dealing with the positioning of elements, but which I have not had occasion to review in detail.  </s>
<s> To what extent does this draft accommodate the need which Greg Lowney has identified, and could it be readily extended, if necessary, to support full control over the ordering of HTML block level elements, using ID and CLASS as selectors in the manner already discussed?  </s>
<s> In general the style sheet mechanism as it exists in CSS1 is not adequate for complete control on the order of the presentation of elements.  </s>
<s> For this, you'll have to use either DSSSL (with all its complexity) or wait for a simplified version of DSSSL or perhaps CSS2.  </s>
