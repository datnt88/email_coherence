Amaya Version: Amaya 5.3 binary for Win NT/2000 System: Windows XP AMD Athlon XP 1700+ 512 MB RAM 60 GB HD Description: If someone clicks somewhere outside the attribute box, the attribute is not inserted in the correct location and where the insertion point is receives what looks like a line break. 
Steps to reproduce: 1. Start Amaya. 
2. Open an HTML document to edit. 
3. Highlight an anchor element. 
4. Click Attributes  type. 
5. Click somewhere else in the document (outside attributes dialog.) 6. Type something in for the attribute and apply and confirm it. 
7. Check the attributes of the anchor. 
The type attribute is not present. 
8. Look where the insertion point was, there is some extra spacing, but no attribute.

Hmmm. 
This is tricky, because this is normal, desirable behaviour in a Unix system. 
It means I can apply one attribute to several different elements in a row with out changing between windows. 
It sounds like Amaya is taking over some of the functions that it should be leaving to the window manager - in particular how to change focus.

Version: 6.0.313 / Virus Database: 174 - Release Date: 1/2/2002 Location: 21 Mitchell street FOOTSCRAY Vic 3011, Australia (or W3C INRIA, Route des Lucioles, BP 93, 06902 Sophia Antipolis Cedex, France) This is due to a feature that allows to apply the same attribute to several elements. 
This is particularly useful when you want to attach the same attribute Class="xx" to a set of elements. 
You have to know that the attribute is attached to the current selection each time you confirm. 
if the current selection is a piece of text a span element is generated. 
How, then, do you select multiple elements? 
I try the CTRL key which is the norm for Windows programs and it functions the same as SHIFT. 
not receives several each present.
