<s> Some time ago, James Clark asked why the full array of tree-walking keywords from the TEI extended-pointer notation was needed for XML linking, and I was asked by the ERB to provide some account of why I thought they were desirable.  </s>
<s> I should note first that strictly speaking the 'functionality' of extended pointers -- pointing at SGML elements or spans within SGML  </s>
<s> documents -- is completely covered by the DESCENDANT keyword, with a  </s>
<s> single numeric parameter.  </s>
<s> DESCENDANT 42878 refers to the 42,878th element in the document (the one with the 42,878th start-tag), and if we limit ourselves to pointing at elements or pointing at spans that begin and end with elements, everything else is syntactic sugar.  </s>
<s> Byte offset is also sufficient, as far as that goes -- in fact, byte offset is more powerful than DESCENDANT because it handles sub-element addressing.  </s>
<s> So no argument for *any* of the keywords can show that any of the keywords adds new functionality; the TEI keywords that do, namely PATTERN, TOKEN, STR, SPACE, FOREIGN, have all already been omitted.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, no one is arguing for byte offset.  </s>
<s> Why?  </s>
<s> It's (a) fragile, (b) opaque, and (c) given to silent failures.  </s>
<s> We want something better than byte offset or DESCENDANT with one argument (which suffers from the same problems), because we want pointers that - are easy to understand / comprehensible / expressive - survive changes to the target document as well as possible - show signs of failure when they fail All of the keywords in question (ID, CHILD, DESCENDANT, ANCESTOR, PREVIOUS, NEXT, PRECEDING, FOLLOWING) serve substantially these same purposes.  </s>
<s> When using natural language to point at texts, we routinely use typed and untyped counts: the third paragraph of the second chapter, or page 232.  </s>
<s> Allowing restriction of the tree-traversal keywords by means of GI and attribute-value pairs as well as counting means that the pointer is clearer (the second quotation in German, or the second quotation after the beginning of page 232, is clearer than "the 82305th sentence of the text") and more robust: a byte offset is broken if even one byte is added or deleted before the target; a pointer to the second quotation after the beginning of page 232 is broken only if a Q element is added between the page boundary and the current second Q -- if the pointer restricts by language as well, only a new quotation in German will break the pointer.  </s>
<s> No pointer is guaranteed safe forever when it's pointing at a changing document.  </s>
<s> But restriction by GI and attribute value, and being able to traverse the tree in any desired direction, from any point chosen for its relative stability (page 232 is *not* a good choice in this regard!) provides much more robust pointers than counters without facilities for such restrictions.  </s>
<s> Counters by themselves are hopelessly fragile.  </s>
<s> Why so many ways to walk the tree, though?  </s>
<s> Well, primarily because in general the best approach to pointing into changing read-only material appears to be to point at some stable point and work from there.  </s>
<s> The stable point may be the end of a section, or the beginning; it may be an element with an ID.  </s>
<s> There is no good way to guarantee that the fixed point will always be above the target resource in the tree, so CHILD and DESCENDANT aren't enough; you need ANCESTOR.  </s>
<s> It's not plausible to assume that the fixed point is always to the left of the target -- sometimes it will be to the right, so if you have NEXT, you need PREVIOUS.  </s>
<s> Some of the keywords are conservative (CHILD, NEXT, PREVIOUS) and are useful for catching typos (a pointer to NEXT(82) is an error if there aren't 82 younger siblings of the current location source); I suspect that for stable documents it might be plausible to work exclusively with these and ANCESTOR.  </s>
<s> But if I want to point at the material on page 23 in a transcription of Lachmann's edition which is currently being prepared, the most reliable way to do it is to say "find the first PB N='23' ED='La' and go till you reach the next PB ED='La' " -- it's more convenient, as well as more robust, not to have to know exactly how many generations down in the tree these milestone elements are.  </s>
<s> A project I am working on now is preparing documents in a data capture DTD and will translate them automatically into an archival DTD later; at that time the nesting level of virtually everything in the documents will change, since the whole point of the data capture DTD is to have fewer levels and exploit some regularities in the data.  </s>
<s> I think it's a strong argument *for* the TEI keywords that xptr xml-link='simple' href="descendant(1,pb,n,23,ed,La)..ditto()following(1,pb,ed,La)"/ will survive that transition, whereas the obvious choice using a smaller set of keywords xptr xml-link="simple" href="child(2)(1)(1)(3)..root()child(2)(1)(2)(2)"/ is almost certain to break; if we add GIs to the parameters we will hear about the breakage, but it will still break.  </s>
<s> To make extended pointers robust, you need keywords that are *not* limited to single-generation jumps or sibling searches: you need  </s>
<s> DESCENDANT, PRECEDING, and FOLLOWING.  </s>
<s> (Note to those who don't want to have to look this up: descendant finds elements at any level of containment; PRECEDING and FOLLOWING search left and right across the entire tree -- unlike NEXT and PREVIOUS they are *not* limited to the siblings of their location source.  </s>
<s> Yes, I know, there's no way to remember which is PREVIOUS and which is PRECEDING -- better names would be welcome.)  </s>
<s> Both functions are needed: PREVIOUS for the case of  </s>
<s> pointing into a relatively stable document where you *want* the more restricted method of counting, to trap errors, and PRECEDING for being able to cross container boundaries.  </s>
<s> I had hoped to produce more concrete examples, but I am running late and have to curtail this message.  </s>
<s> So I'll leave it with the page-reference example: find, at any depth, the first PB with N=23 and ED=La, then take everything up to the next PB from that edition.  </s>
<s> Note that the next PB is not guaranteed to have N=24: page 24 could easily be blank and not marked with a PB. How do you do this reliably in a target document subject to change without DESCENDANT, DITTO, and FOLLOWING?  </s>
<s> I hope this helps clarify why I want a full set of tree-traversal keywords.  </s>
<s> Maybe James is right, and this is sort of a poor-folk's  </s>
<s> query language.  </s>
<s> If so, I suspect it's smaller and easier to implement than any of the Rich Folk's query languages, and to a really surprising degree it does get the job done.  </s>

<s> This is my major concern about having both PRECEDING/FOLLOWING and NEXT/PREVIOUS.  </s>
<s> It's going to be very hard for people to remember.  </s>
<s> This is especially the case since the TEI meanings for PRECEDING/FOLLOWING are the opposite of the SDQL meanings:  </s>
<s> TEI SDQL NEXT FOLLOW PREVIOUS PRECED PRECEDING BEFORE FOLLOWING AFTER (currently used only in prose not in a function name) I notice that the current draft actually defines the TEI terms using the SDQL terms (was this intentional?):  </s>
<s> PREVIOUS selects preceding sibling elements of the location source.  </s>
<s> NEXT selects following sibling elements of the location source.  </s>
<s> PRECEDING selects elements which appear before the location source.  </s>
<s> FOLLOWING selects elements which appear after the location source.  </s>
<s> This suggests to me that the TEI choice of terms is not the best.  </s>
<s> NEXT to me suggests immediately next not any following sibling; and FOLLOWING to me  </s>
<s> doesn't suggest looking at elements that aren't following siblings.  </s>
<s> My concrete suggestion would be to drop the terms PRECEDING/FOLLOWING since SDQL and TEI give them opposite meanings and use PREVIOUS/NEXT/AFTER/BEFORE.  </s>
<s> It does.  </s>
<s> A couple of other issues:  </s>
<s> - Why do we need to allow * for the element type name?  </s>
<s> Why can't we simply require that all steps include the element type name or *CDATA?  </s>
<s> This  </s>
<s> eliminates the confusion over whether * counts pseudo-elements or not.  </s>
<s> It  </s>
<s> makes my life harder as an implementor to have to support both typed and untyped counts: making typed and untyped counting efficient requires different data structures.  </s>
<s> - Why do we need * for the attribute name?  </s>
<s> - Why do we need * for the attribute value?  </s>
<s> - Why do we need *IMPLIED for the attribute value?  </s>
<s> This is only going to work in the presence of the DTD.  </s>
<s> While I have your attention, I have a couple of other open issues from earlier messages which I think need considering:  </s>
<s> As a footnote to this, I would say that the current rule makes sense when you're working without a DTD.  </s>
<s> So I think the rule should be something like: the matching is case insensitive if - you're working with a DTD, and the attribute is declared as a case insensitive type - the attribute value is unquoted in the pointer (should this apply if the attribute is declared is explicitly declared to be CDATA?), or - (maybe) there's a #FOLD keyword present.  </s>
<s> James  </s>
<s> James wrote, in reply to Michael's clear exposition:  </s>
<s> I think that's nearly very good indeed!  </s>
<s> :-)  </s>
<s> I don't think this is any clearer -- without an explanation, I would have no idea at all that AFTER meant only elements after this one in the same container, and that NEXT meant the next element in the input, or the next sibling, or whatever.  </s>
<s> I think the right answer is to be specific: NEXT -- the element whose opening tag occurs next in the input after the current element's end tag NEXT SIBLING -- NEXT restricted to the current container PREVIOUS -- the element whose opening tag occurs most recently in the input PREVIOUS SIBLING -- the element whose close tag is immediately followed by the current element's opening tag.  </s>
<s> I can also imagine extending this to include expr1 IN expr2 where expr1 and expr2 are TEI extended pointer expressions, to mean expr1 provided that it occurs within the content of expr2, and an error otherwise.  </s>
<s> I am not proposing this feature, as I don't think it addes enough it practice, except that it seems to me to be the generalisation of TEI's PREVIOUS and NEXT.  </s>
<s> Well, what about the case where it could be any of a number of elements?  </s>
<s> For example, I want to link to the first bibliographic citation in a note element that's inside a PART, but the note could occur either in a chapter, a section, an appendix or a procudure...  </s>
<s> I don't see that -- if you have typed data structures, can't you use those for untyped links too and ignore the type?  </s>
<s> I agree about IMPLIED.  </s>
<s> I think the other two are useful.  </s>
<s> The second is easiest to find examples for: find the first person with any value for the ROLE attribute.  </s>
<s> I am not sure you can also find the first person _without_ a ROLE attribute unless you have *IMPLIED.  </s>
<s> * for an attribute name is just as useful as * for an element type.  </s>
<s> I can't answer your question on case folding, since I think that case insensitivity is a bad idea anyway, and all comparisons should be case sensitive!  </s>
<s> Lee  </s>
<s> For example, if I was doing only typed counting I might store in the document for each element type an array of pointers to elements of that type in the order they occur in the document.  </s>
<s> Then in each element I might store the index of that element amongst all elements of is type and the index amongst all elements in the document.  </s>
<s> That would allow be to do typed preceding and following efficiently.  </s>
<s> But it wouldn't help me with doing untyped preceding and following efficiently.  </s>
<s> For that I would also need an array of pointers to all elements in the order they occur in the document.  </s>
<s> You didn't provide any argument for this.  </s>
<s> I'm not saying you're wrong, but I don't think it's obvious.  </s>
<s> It's easy to implement any of these uses of * slowly, but implementing each of them efficiently on large documents requires that additional information be stored.  </s>
<s> One can dream up cases where one might use any of these, but this has to be balanced against the implementation cost.  </s>
<s> Are these uses of * really part of the "minimum required to declare victory"?  </s>
<s> Maybe for element type names they are.  </s>
<s> But for attribute names?  </s>
<s> James  </s>
<s> Yikes! How did we all let that happen.  </s>
<s> Never mind.  </s>
<s> I kind of like the names LSIBLING and RSIBLING for the ones that do that.  </s>
<s> Or, to accommodate other writing directions, E(lder)SIBLING and Y(ounger)SIBNLING; or N(ext)SIBLING and P(revious)SIBLING to match the others.  </s>
<s> I find the terms James proposed an improvement, but I think it would be even clearer with "SIBLING" blatently in the name (this may be especially true for ESL speakers who may lack sprachgefuhl for the subtleties of other terms.  </s>
<s> Thus I like Lee's suggestion except for the embedded blanks in the keywords, which would require tweaking some BNF.  </s>
<s> Interesting. TEI strongly recommends using a type, but we didn't feel we could require it.  </s>
<s> If the users are willing, I'm fine with that.  </s>
<s> These are largely for symmetry and completeness.  </s>
<s> If all the parameters don't look as alike as possible, there's more to explan.  </s>
<s> I doubt people actually use * for attr name or value.  </s>
<s> I see James' point re. optimization being harder if you have to go cache counts of attribute values, etc.  </s>
<s> Interesting case.  </s>
<s> If we make such a change, I should think we'd want it symmetrically: all keywords would be able to count themselves as a possibility.  </s>
<s> The most important case is probably ANCESTOR; I've had customers who want to refer to the nearest containing element of type X, whether or not it's where i started.  </s>
<s> DynaText scripting thus added a nearest() function for that, as distinct from ancestor() which it already had but which could never return the element itself.  </s>
<s> This could be accomplished by doubling the number of keywords (yech) or adding a parameter or parameter value.  </s>
<s> steve  </s>
<s> [... justification for keeping TEI keywords ...]  </s>
<s> I'd like to support this - when I demonstrate this facility to people who haven't seen XML before, and tell them it *comes free with the [draft] language* they are impressed.  </s>
