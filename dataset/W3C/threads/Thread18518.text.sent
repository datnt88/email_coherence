Hello, Per my action of the 1-2 March face-to-face meeting [1], please consider the following Guideline splits. 
These will appear in the next draft for review in context. 
1) In the 24 Feb 2001 draft: Guideline 4. Ensure user control of rendering and viewport behavior. 
Split into: Guideline 4. Ensure user control of rendering. 
Guideline 5. Ensure user control of user interface behavior. 
Guideline 5 is the result of the decision to group checkpoints about user control over UI behavior under one heading. 
These (abridged) checkpoints are: 5.1 Allow configuration so that the current focus does not move automatically to viewports that open without explicit user request. 
5.2 For graphical user interfaces, allow configuration so that the viewport with the current focus remains "on top" of all other viewports with which it overlaps. 
5.3 Allow configuration so that viewports only open on explicit user request. 
5.4 Allow configuration so the user is prompted to confirm any form submission not caused by explicit user request to activate a form submit control. 
5.5 Allow configuration so the user is prompted to confirm any payment resulting from activation of a fee link. 
5.6 Allow configuration so the user is prompted to confirm any viewport that closes without explicit user request. 
QUESTION: Should Guideline 4 read: "Ensure user control of rendering and styles" since there a style sheet checkpoint as well? 
2) In the 24 Feb 2001 draft: Guideline 5. Observe operating environment conventions and standard interfaces. 
This guideline has started to grow large and there's a clear division of checkpoints into "things for APIs" and "things related to observing conventions". 
Therefore I propose splitting it into: Guideline 6. Implement standard application programming interfaces. 
(10 checkpoints, all about APIs) Guideline 7. Observe operating environment conventions. 
(4 checkpoints) Note: I don't mind having 12 Guidelines (not as good as 10, but better than 11... and even dozen!) - Ian [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/2001/03/ua-minutes [2] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20010224/ Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org) http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs Cell: +1 917 450-8783 Hello, Per my action of the 1-2 March face-to-face meeting [1], please consider the following Guideline splits.

CMN: Fine by me IJ QUESTION: Should Guideline 4 read: "Ensure user control of rendering and styles" since there a style sheet checkpoint as well? 
CMN Don't see why - style is rendering.

(4 checkpoints) Sure. 
Note that I consider this stuff editorial. 
If it isn't then the checkpoints don't stand properly as a list of requirements which indicates that there is a major flaw in the document. 
Chaals I'd ad style to the title of the checkpoint.
