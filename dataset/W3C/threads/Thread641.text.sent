FYI, The latest (August) version of Tidy is flagging idref as an "unknown attribute" in label .

outbind://21/rickr@rivio.com 
It's right to do so. 
There is no attribute by that name in HTML. 
label idref="name" Name: /label Ah, I think you have misunderstood the syntax of label 's attribute list. 
IDREF is the type of the attribute called 'for', and is a special SGML keyword. 
(See http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/types.html#type-idref .) What you mean is: Is outbind: a real URI scheme? 
hope this helps, Daniel Biddle deltab@osian.net 
That's because the attribute you are looking for is called "for". 
The HTML4 spec says: The for attribute associates a label with another control explicitly: the value of the for attribute must be the same as the value of the id attribute of the associated control element. 
More than one LABEL may be associated with the same control by creating multiple references via the for attribute.

I guess I read that too fast.... Sorry for the blurt-mail and thanks for the response.
