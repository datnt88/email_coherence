8: Confirm Status of Withdrawn Actions ACTION: 2002-06-17#8 guha define the dark/light function for URIREFs ACTION: 2002-06-17#9 patH update the model theory to make statements with dark properties have no semantics ACTION: 2002-06-17#10 guha consider impact of dark triples on test cases ACTION: 2002-06-17#12 patH propose a paragraph on dark triples for the primer ACTION: 2002-06-17#13 daveB ensure that the description of the graph syntax adequately describes darkness AGREED: all closed, by virtue of dark triples no longer being a priority concern (see http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Aug/0168.html) 9: Status of new Concepts and Abstract Data Model WD 2002-08-16#3 EricM publish rdf concepts and abstract data model WD Action continues -- working on last pubrules, should be out soon. 
10: Relationship between XML Schema and RDF (Item skipped.) 11: rdf:Alt's relationship to individual statements Problem with Alt is that different people are using it in different ways. 
Dublin Core are using Alt in a way that doesn't accord with other RDF folks expectations. 
Suggestion to deprecate Alt/Seq/Bag. 
Sentiment is that it's too late to consider throwing out the existing containers. 
People have been asking for a common means of expressing collections for a variety of tasks... preference expressed to have more specific/formal declrations for existing collections rather than just deprecating them. 
More explanatory material in Primer, maybe? 
Main problem is Alt: people are using it without defining a specific vocabulary to go with such use. 
Alt has no special formal semantics of itself, so any such must be associated with properties. 
Suggestion that the primer should have material that use of Alt without special vocabulary is may not achieve intended purpose. 
So, current approach is to leave the Alt vocabulary defined, but NOT to define the semantics that some people might expect. 
Dublin Core are about to approve a spec that uses Alt in such inappropriate ways -- there is an urgent need that they should be notified, preferably by reference to material in the revised RDF documents. 
Suggestion that they might use repeated properties instead of Alt, or explain more carefully in their own document what the Alt construct means. 
As far as RDF is concerned, an Alt collection has a value that is the Alt container object. 
We should make it clear to the DC community that any additional Alt semantics would apply only to properties they define. 
[Suggestion that an "RDF myths" document should be created] ACTION 2002-08-23#1, DanC: review primer text and propose alternative that clarifies status of Alt [and other collections?]. (EricM will help.) ACTION 2002-08-23#2, DaveB: initiate dialog with DC community about the issue of rdf:Alt usage. 
12: rdfms:assertion PROPOSED that the text in section 2.3.2 of the Concepts and Abstract Data Model document resolves this issue and it be closed. 
document is also archived as ZIP file attached to: Some discussion of this paragraph: For example, a media type, application/rdf+xml [RDF-MIME-TYPE ] is being registered for indicating the use of RDF/XML that might be published with the intent of being such an assertional representation (as distinguished from other XML or text that may just happen to look like RDF assertions). 
DanBri says he asked for it to be omitted; GK understood request to be that the assertional requirement be softened (hence the "might ... with the intent" in the above). 
Concerns expressed about misalignment with MIME type registration draft. 
In discussion, the softened wording, quoted above, will do for now but may need further wordsmithing and cross-checking with revised MIME type registration draft. 
Also concerns that the term "assertion" is used in different fashions. 
Also noted that RDF MIME type registration Internet-draft is about to expire, and should be re-issued. 
As part of the review process for re-issue, we should cross-check for consistency with the concepts and abstract model document. 
AGREED: the issue can be closed as proposed above (understanding that the document text may undergo some additional wordsmithing). 
[NOTE (not part of formal meeting record): in post-meeting IRC discussion, there was some debate about whether there should be some explicit mention of HTTP usage in setting the context for RDF being asserted; consensus among those chatting seemed to be that an HTTP context might be introduced as an illustrative example. 
See attached IRC log. 
DanBri made a comment there that might be helpful: "I think we can carve things nicely down the middle. 
(i) RDF/XML docs have propositional content (ii) agents can demonstrate attitdues (believing, fearing, desiring) towards such content."] 
ACTION 2002-08-23#6, bwm: Ensure that WG home page points to current editor working draft documents for WG review. 
ACTION 2002-08-23#7, FrankM: Propose alternative text for the concepts and abstract model document to rectify concerns with conflicting use of "assertion". 
ACTION 2002-08-23#8, AaronSw: Update MIME type draft for WG review prior to re-issue. 
13: Meaning of rdf:type and relationship between RDF and RDFS (Item skipped) 14: Datatypes Need review of latest document, then we can shoot for publication. 
Current document is: http://www-nrc.nokia.com/sw/rdf-datatyping.html Some specific requests: (1) be very clear about document status (2) references to untidiness of literals should be clearly flagged with a request for further community feedback. 
With test case example clarifying consequence (e.g. age "10" and title "10"). 
(3) DC examples in appendix should be RDF/XML not N-triples (4) don't use abbreviations in first examples (e.g. &amp;xsd;): if used, introduce them later. 
More reviewer feedback is required before the editors can formally prepare a new publication candidate.

--meeting closed-- Please refer to static revision of 26 August located at for purposes of review. 
Done. 
Included in static revision. 
I will add this. 
It is not in the static revision posted for review. 
I'm away from the office for a couple of days, so it may be nearer the end of the week before it gets added. 
Done. 
Included in static revision. 
XML entities are still used in the RDF/XML but fully expanded URIrefs are used in the N-Triples for each example, so hopefully this is now clearer. 
Please refer to 26 August revision for review. 
Thanks. 
Done. 
C.f. http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Aug/0232.html 
Also, I'm presuming there is an action on the other two editors to also review the latest revision ;-) Patrick
