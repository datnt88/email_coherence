<s> Hi David, According to the capture of your screen, there is no problem with Amaya.  </s>
<s> It seems that IE uses too large characters but the way Amaya displays the document is the right way.  </s>
<s> Ramzi.  </s>
<s> You can size the text with Amaya this is not a problem.  </s>
<s> However, the Amaya home page is well displayed with Amaya and in right way.  </s>
<s> How to modify text size with Amaya: first edit a paragraph, then click within the paragraph and hit escape key (this allows to select it).  </s>
<s> Use the Style/Character Style Menu and modify what you want  </s>
<s> (size font, ...).  </s>
<s> You can create a CSS rule on the paragraph tag and all your paragraphs will be displayed in the same way than the modified paragraph.  </s>
<s> To create the CSS rule, select again the paragraph you've modified and use the menu Style/Create Rule then confirm.  </s>

<s> Netscape, Opera, and Communicator all display at the correct size, but Amaya displays text small.  </s>
<s> Don't reply, "They're all wrong, Amaya is the only one that displays web pages the right way." Attached is image of Netscape, Opera, and Amaya window.  </s>
<s> And it doesn't matter which web page it is.  </s>
<s> Amaya needs a text sizing option, whether you like it or not.  </s>

<s> Actually, what is currently missing with the Win95 version of Amaya is the abitity to specify a "User's preferences" style sheet, like in the current Unix version.  </s>
<s> When that feature gets implemented in Win95, it will be possible to adjust the way Web pages get displayed by editing the "user's preferences" style sheet.  </s>

<s> This feature is available for Windows version since 1.2a release.  </s>
<s> As explained in the entry "Configurating" in the menu "Help", the Windows "User's preferences" style sheet should be located at Thot\amaya\amaya.css  </s>

<s> Mystery solved.  </s>
<s> Yes, this works.  </s>
<s> I was having trouble having copied my disk to another (bigger) disk.  </s>
<s> For reasons only Microsoft could understand, moving the disk caused the shortcuts to move with them, so I was launching the version installed on the old disk (and therefore was using a different Thot directory).  </s>
