<s> And of course, it speaks HTTP/1.1... The Stanford gadget looks smaller than Itsy (see: http://www.research.digital.com/wrl/itsy/index.html), which has a display, on the other hand.  </s>
<s> Itsy runs off of triple A cells, at much lower power..., so Itsy is clearly the champ on hits/joule... - Jim  </s>
<s> This What about this one: It is 2x2 in, 1.5x1.5 inch core logic without I/O pins It connects directly to a modem.  </s>
<s> Contains PPP server, TCP/IP and HTTP.  </s>

<s> Looks pretty small to me.  </s>
<s> But we'll have to get you and Stanford to compare notes on exactly who is smaller, as theirs is pretty tiny as well.  </s>
<s> So far in the race we have: Stanford and ULM for smallest size Compaq Itsy for slightly larger, but much faster.  </s>
<s> And we can now generate a bunch more bogus performance metrics, like hits/joule of energy, Hits/cubic CC/second, and other fun useless metrics of performance.  </s>
