<s> Therefore, all declarations, including function signatures, end with semicolons.  </s>
<s> This is easier to remember than requiring semicolons for some declarations but not for others.  </s>
<s> It's a bit redundant, but you do get used to it.  </s>
<s> Which is more important, making parser writing easier or making coding XQuery easier?  </s>
<s> I believe coding XQuery, because we're going to have just some dozen XQuery parsers in the world but thousands or tens of thousands of XQuery coders.  </s>
<s> The easier we make the language, the more coders we'll have.  </s>
<s> Empirical evidence shows that the May 2003 syntax is readily parsable (I can point to you engines that parse it without ambiguity) so why push an unnecessarily nastier syntax down to the thousands of future XQuery coders?  </s>
<s> I recognize it's tricky in a WG consisting almost entirely of implementors (it was 100% vendors in the meeting I attended) to think of what's best for XQuery coders.  </s>
<s> The best solution would be to get more coders involved, but in lieu of that, we should at least listen up when a coder like Mark asks the vendors to make his life easier by simplifying the syntax.  </s>
<s> -jh-  </s>
<s> Semicolons were added not because the language can't be parsed without them, but because it's very hard to produce good error messages and error recovery.  </s>
<s> In my view the semicolons are a great improvement because they make the language more robust.  </s>
<s> To achieve good diagnostics, you need to guess what the user intended when their syntax is incorrect, and for that you need a syntax that is not only unambigous but also has some redundancy.  </s>

<s> Hi Jason, I still believe that we should keep semicolons as is, because 1. Semicolons at the end of declarations simplify parsing of the language - not only for recognition, but also for error detection, making it possible to give good error messages.  </s>
<s> 2. Semicolons at the end of declarations give us more flexibility in extending the langauge.  </s>
<s> For instance, if you look at variable declaration syntax in the Nov 2003 WD, you will see that we had to require {} for the value of variables in the prolog because at the time we added that syntax we did not have semicolons.  </s>
<s> Before we added semicolons, we spent way too much time trying to devise a syntax for each kind declaration so that it could be parsed without semicolons - and that hurt the user-friendliness of the language.  </s>
<s> 3. Users get used to ending declarations with semicolons rather quickly, if my XQuery workshops are any indication.  </s>
<s> Incidentally, I prefer a simple rule ("a declaration ends with a semicolon") to any rule that has exceptions ("a declaration ends with a semicolon except if it is a function declaration...) Jonathan  </s>
