oups ! 
I've sent an message to dave personnaly, this list is probably better There is currently few HTML parser wich produce DOM (see ww.docuverse.com). 
That's why I've tried to used tidy to generate an XML, then parse this XML with sun's XML parser in java ( named "project X") to produce DOM. Unfortunatly, I still have some problem with &amp;nbsp : they are detected as errors, and my DOM is not built. 
I don't know if tidy do not generate valid XML, or if sun's parser is buggy, but here is the situation ! 
Thanks for your attention. 
This little filter seems to be missing ? 
PS : please forward me your mail, I've not yet subscribed the mailing list ok, using "-n" works fine. 
I still have a little problem : how to customize the header ? 
*this one make the .xml 
unreadbale by IE5, how can I remove it : !DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-html-in-xml/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd" *this one cause does not seem to be valid (404), and actually I would prefer to have only html : I think it would be valuable to put this "HTML 2 XML for dummies" in a section of the project description. 
thanks for your help.
