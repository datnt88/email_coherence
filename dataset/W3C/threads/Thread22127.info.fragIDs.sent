<s> Hi, Just back from Berlin, trying to catch up with the TS.  </s>
<s> After a quick read I understand that we are moving into a direction where interface methods are defined as Elements within the TS dtd.  </s>
<s> After a series of method calls a set of assertions are issued.  </s>
<s> With the limited knowledge I've got now from the DTD I'm trying to image how a test for a DOM L3 LS call would look like.  </s>
<s> example: void writeNode(in DOMOutputStream destination, in Node node) raises(DOMSystemException); Would probably something like DOMWriter.writeNode var="........  </s>
<s> One of the options for this DOM L3 call is Namespace fixup:  </s>
<s> true: Check namespace declarations and prefixes for consistency, and fix them in the serialized data if they are inconsistent.  </s>
<s> false: Perform no special checks on name space declarations, prefixes or URIs.  </s>
<s> default: true; supported values: true: required; false: required.  </s>
<s> It seems to me that it could be difficult to check the result of this method by a set of asserts.  </s>
<s> Do you think it would be doable to test these kind of methods ?  </s>

<s> Hi Jeroen, The TSML will also have the capability to use complex if's, whiles, for's etc -- all the language constructs that you would expect, so I think that we will be able to cover your example sufficiently.  </s>
<s> At the moment, we are discussing the DOM constructs and the issues related to them -- so you see a stripped-down version of what will be available.  </s>

<s> I think this is similar to problems that you would also encounter in writing tests to test event dispatching and probably traversals (but I don't know traversals).  </s>
<s> Definitely I don't think we want our little language to grow to the point that we can extend arbitrary interfaces.  </s>
<s> I did a few initial tests for event dispatch and the approach that I thought was reasonable was to have a build-in implementation of the listener (or in this case DOMOutputStream) that captured all the events (or output) and allowed you to insert code into the event handler.  </s>
<s> You could make assertions in the event handler or after event dispatching was complete.  </s>
<s> I started with some event tests in Java with Junit: and then added the minimal language constructs that allows to be represent that test.  </s>
<s> Which in my schema was the declare onEvent/ /declare , the EventMonitor.* elements and the EventMonitor datatype.  </s>
<s> I would assume a similar approach would work for Traversals and Serialization.  </s>
<s> Determine what you want to test and prototype a few in the language of your convienience and then add a few constructs to support those types of tests.  </s>
