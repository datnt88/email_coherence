Can we keep a current list of TFs as part of the SWBPD home page?

I promised to send out the format that we proposed for web ont and oep. 
Webont had discussed having a "howtodoit" compilation, or best practices, or tricks of the trade. 
this was modeled off of the tricks of the trade section of Living with Classic. 
This was the example from WebOnt: (it is old - it was put up over a year ago but the format still is the result of a discussion concerning the same issues we are addressing now.) note the "abstracted solution" in this form and natasha's summary of approach in her example. 
I would claim they are similar and important. 
Also, observation in my format may not always be instantiated but it may be used to point out stumbling blocks to an "obvious" solution to the problem. 
natasha has a "considerations" portion in her description. 
This also seems like it would be good to have in the template and might also be considered optional. 
i need to continue the action item of choosing another item from Living with CLASSIC and describing it in this format. 
I will not be on the call tomorrow morning at 1400 utc time. 
Also, given the suggestion below to have the next meeting at either 1400 utc or 1800 utc, i will participate if it is 1800 but can not make it at 1400. 
I would propose that we have it at 1800 and discuss the format for examples in that telecon.

I may have to drop out after about an hour of the telecon (if my 2-year old wakes up earlier than I hope). 
So, I would like to ask to move the discussion of OEP to the top of the TF discussions, if that's ok with others. 
Thanks, Natasha 
one more email on pattern forms for oep my suggestion (from webont) and from:http://www.ksl.stanford.edu/people/dlm/webont/HowToDoIt/closingRoles.html: problem description observations (optional) abstracted solution example natasha's example at: had general issue (could be viewed as similar to problem description) use case example other scenario approaches (with considerations and summaries) welty previously at http://esw.w3.org/topic/PartWhole had Background OWL Formalization Pitfalls References my summarization of these is: problem description (including background and observations could fit in here as well) use case example abstracted solution owl solution implications references if as in natasha's example, there are many solutions, then repeat abstracted solution, owl solution, implications, references as appropriate.

Yes, certainly. 
I had intended to have that done earlier this week but didn't manage. 
I will accept an ACTION to complete this task. 
Hello, Good luck for you and bad for me : since half an hour our IP telephony platform prototype is down i'm going to call FT to repare it :-) So, I'm waiting until it will be repared an d i'm looking for an "old" phone MArco NANNI -----Message d'origine----- De : public-swbp-wg-request@w3.org [mailto:public-swbp-wg-request@w3.org]De la part de Guus Schreiber Envoye : mercredi 14 avril 2004 18:38 A : SWBPD list Objet : [ALL] Agenda 15 April telecon

Belated regrets/apologies. 
I got the time wrong. 
Is there some way to keep these times stable?? Pat IHMC(850)434 8903 or (650)494 3973 home 40 South Alcaniz St.(850)202 4416 office FL 32501(850)291 0667 cell phayes@ihmc.us
