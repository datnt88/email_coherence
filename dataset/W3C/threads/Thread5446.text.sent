Hi, Does any one have any idea of what the results were for the Jan 6, 2004 ruling to stay both the jury award and the modifications to IE? Like many of you, our sites uses a lot of embedded plug-in code and I would prefer not to implement the workaround if there is a stay.

Behalf Of TheoDP@aol.com FYI Friday's Chicago Tribune reported a federal judge will rule Jan. 6 on Microsoft's request to stay the jury's $520 million award until the USPTO reexamination is done.

ry?coll=chi-business-hed If I am not mistaken, I believe the case was put on hold pending USPTO decision on the re-examination. 
Jim Smyser FYI, to keep up with the USPTO's Eolas re-examination you can go to: and search on Application Number: 90/006,831 At last check there's no new updates since December. 
Thanks for the info about Judge Zagel's decision to hold on this case.
