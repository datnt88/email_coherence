<s> Principle 1: All information must be available entirely through visual, auditory, or tactile methods or in any combination required by the user.  </s>
<s> Principle 2: Capture structure and implied meaning (semantics) in markup or in a data model.  </s>
<s> These are going to be somewhat "academic" in tone/content.  </s>
<s> I think that brevity is permissible so long as subsequent materials elucidate for those to whom this sounds "high-falutin'".  </s>
<s> I recommend leaving out "implied" and either "meaning" or "semantics".  </s>
<s> The "implied meaning"  </s>
<s> seems to apply (mostly?) to the uses of structure/presentation to convey semantics.  </s>
<s> "Content" probably doesn't have markup/datamodel requirements but structure/presentation does?  </s>
<s> Thus the "information" in Principle 1 and the "semantics" in 2 must both be revealed in accordance with 1.  </s>
<s> So in effect Principle 1 might say that semantics, whether explicit as in content or implied through structure/presentation must be...  </s>
<s> The structure is "information" and the "presentation" might well be.  </s>
<s> The general/abstract case is that *all* semantic content must be available.  </s>
<s> So in a way Principle 2 would be redundant if Principle 1 were somewhat expanded?  </s>
<s> Principle 3: Design for ease of comprehension, browsing and navigation I'm having a lot of trouble with this one, particularly with the inclusion of "browsing" which seems to me to be a subset of  </s>
<s> "navigation"?  </s>
<s> Mainly, I think the directive to "design for ease..." is essentially impossible to yield agreed-upon methods/goals since "make it simple but not too simple" implies that for some of us "ease of comprehension" is hampered by simplisticism.  </s>
<s> OTOH I think ease of navigation is indeed quite central to these guidelines.  </s>
<s> Principle 4: Design user interfaces for device independence I believe this will be the saving grace of our goal of Universal Design *if we can provide acceptable/practical/usable guidance*.  </s>
<s> Perhaps Bristol will help clarify if we have any chance to continue pursuing this goal.  </s>
<s> If stuff like WAP captures a handhold on handhelds it may be difficult to preclude multiple proprietary Webs in lieu of achieving accessibility via Principle 4.  </s>
<s> Principle 5: Compensate for older technologies and missing or incompletely implemented features of user agents I guess I still think this doesn't rise to the level of a "Principle" since in our ivory tower older technologies are superceded technologies, failings of user agents are temporary and we don't want to modify the Principles just because the telephone operators no longer must insert plugs into some spot on a bank of receptacles or turn a hand crank to ring one's bell.  </s>

<s> ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE  </s>
<s> AG:: Note that the use of the words 'all' and 'entirely' in the above are in conflict with the principles of reasonable accomodation and effective communication.  </s>
<s> Besides, modifiers detract.  </s>
<s> Strike these words and it is a powerful statement.  </s>
<s> The use of "visual, auditory, or tactile" as defining the space of sensory options is technology-specific.  </s>
<s> There is widely available technology in these areas, but the general principle includes other sensory modes including haptic, vestibular, and thermal sensations, along with direct electrical stimulation of neurons.  </s>
<s> Targeting all the above three senses is a strategy, not principle (in principle).  </s>
<s> A problem is that I don't know how to state the general principle in the positive.  </s>
<s> It takes a double negative, to the best of my ability to articulate it.  </s>
<s> It is that "Comprehending the information shall not depend on something the user can't do."  </s>
<s> From this we derive the strategy stated a Principle #1.  </s>
<s> And then add a parallel strategy addressing cognitive barriers.  </s>
<s> Note that "or in any combination required by the user" is unnecessarily restrictive and not a valid part of the requirement as stated.  </s>
<s> If the information is completely comprehensible in the user's choice among single-sense presentations, the requirement has been met.  </s>
<s> The inability to provide perfect equivalents makes it easier in practical terms for the information source to deliver the information in two out of three senses than in just one.  </s>
<s> So because of this supply-side cost factor, it is natural that the graceful degradation sequence flows from "all" through "two" on the way to "one" of the above sensory channels.  </s>
<s> Because at each step you get less 'graceful' and more 'degradation,' in most actual situations.  </s>
<s> AG:: Yes, for the right definition of 'information' the second principle is a consequence of the first.  </s>
<s> However, it doesn't mean that we don't need to break the master principle down into two facets: how to meet this requirement as it affects small chunks of information, and how to meet the requirements as it affects structure, i.e. the content or semantics that are disclosed through the association of chunks with other chunks.  </s>
<s> Technical note: The satisfaction of Principle #1 does in practice generate requirements of a "markup or data model" nature.  </s>
<s> The classic example of this is text alternatives for image data.  </s>
<s> Here there is a structure of equivalence relationship.  </s>
<s> The markup or data model has to communicate what text is equivalent to what image.  </s>
<s> Given that raw sound and image data can convey information, and that some of this information can be captured in textual 'equivalents,' there is a built-in requirement that there be at least enough structural model to capture the equivalence relationships.  </s>
<s> Note 2: The peephole effect is the clearest image I know of to explain why the structure relating different mini- or micro-chunks of information needs to be articulated well.  </s>
<s> [For 'articulated' read "spelled out."]  </s>
<s> The data/information chunk that has focus, i.e. it is in display and occupies the user's foreground attention, is contextualized in the GUI usage pattern by bits on the screen and in the eyes-free scenario by concepts remembered by the user.  </s>
<s> The two main questions that this context answers are "where am I?" and "what is this all about?"  </s>
<s> The structure (information atom connections) has to be comprehensible in both of these alternative views.  </s>
<s> In order to support both views with low rates of error or information loss, it is [very helpful to practically necessary] to make the patterns of connection explicit or machine-interpretable so that the morphing can be carried out correctly by automatic processes executed by a computer.  </s>
<s> The concrete example to illustrate this is the cell-to-header relationships in tables.  </s>
<s> Effective table adaptation techniques make it easy for the user to maintain memory of the header context as they read the cell particulars.  </s>
<s> AG:: Principle 3 is also related to Principle 1.  </s>
<s> There is an adage "the proof of the pudding is in the eating."  </s>
<s> Principle 3 is the eating that proves the Principle 1 pudding.  </s>
<s> You often cannot define "all the information" statically to a sufficient degree, so this operational check is a required piece of the solution.  </s>
<s> Browsing differs from navigation in that it includes absorbing some of the base content, marbled through the motion and vice versa.  </s>
<s> Nibble, move, nibble is the browsing cycle.  </s>
<s> Each part informs the other.  </s>
<s> You don't know which link to follow next until you have absorbed some of the actual content that frames the links in this page.  </s>
<s> And you can't read what you need to read next without exercising the path-control option of following a hyperlink.  </s>
<s> As we have learned from "click here" the labels on the hyperlinks are not sufficient out of context.  </s>
<s> This is true not only for this extreme example.  </s>
<s> AG:: Insensitivity to the display horizon (see above talking about explicit structure and peephole effects) is what the mobile device needs for the content to be equally appealing as in the large-display context.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, if the publishers prepare alternate presentations for desktop and mobile displays, we at least get to pick the one that works on a consumer by consumer basis.  </s>
<s> The eyes-free consumer subscribes to the mobile web; the verbally-challenged consumer to the playstation.  </s>
<s> Even if the retailing of content goes to multiple forms (c.f.  </s>
<s> Radio, TV, Magazines, Newprint) there will still be demand from the information sources for a common mode at the OEM or B2B interface.  </s>
<s> This is why one of the first XML applications was for newswire stories.  </s>
<s> The civil right we seek is addressed if individuals can opt to tap into the universal source form as an option to the targeted presentation.  </s>
<s> This is implied by #4.  </s>
<s> The 'device' seen by the page includes the client-side software.  </s>
<s> I agree in large measure with William's comments.  </s>
<s> Though it would be possible, in principle (if the pun may be thus excused) to subsume all of the requirements under a single overarching maxim, for purposes of grouping the more concrete requirements and elucidating the nature of what constitutes accessible design this would be highly unhelpful.  </s>
<s> We need to arrive at a balance between generality and specificity in formulating the highest-level requirements; these serve as categories within which to organise the more concrete desiderata.  </s>
<s> This reasoning justifies writing principles 1 and 2 as separate requirements.  </s>
<s> The inclusion of "browsing" in principle 4 has its origins in T.V. Raman's doctoral thesis, where it is used in contradistinction to "navigation".  </s>
<s> Essentially, there is a difference between navigating (crudely expressed, finding one's way to a particular point in a document, to stress the spatial metaphor) and browsing the document's contents.  </s>
<s> In the latter activity, one is reaing the document non-sequentially, for instance by concentrating on particular features or structural components.  </s>
<s> For example, in perusing a journal article, one might at first read only the headings, look to the footnotes to determine which references are being cited, and then direct one's attention to particular sections of interest.  </s>
<s> This is different from merely navigating the document--that is to say, searching for particular material within it, for instance via the table of contents or other navigational apparatus.  </s>
<s> I think it is important to recognize that structural markup serves as a basis for both browsing and navigational activities and that although both aspects overlap, they are nevertheless distinct.  </s>
<s> Obviously, what this amounts to in specific terms will be elaborated in  </s>
<s> the more concrete requirements (checkpoints etc.) and also in whatever explanatory text accompanies the guideline.  </s>
<s> Regarding Principle 5, won't it always be true (so long as there is technological change) that older standards, data formats and applications will have to coexist with the new, and hence that some degree of backward compatibility will always be needed, especially where there is a plurality of software solutions available and the needs of diverse communities of users, with various hardware devices and software requirements, are involved?  </s>
<s> In brief, it seems unrealistic to conclude that such issues are likely to vanish, however much we might wish that they would do so.  </s>
<s> capacity only.  </s>
<s> AG:: "Comprehending the information shall not depend on something the user can't do.  </s>
<s> ...add a parallel strategy addressing cognitive barriers."  </s>
<s> WL: We seem to assume that "cognitive barriers" is a way of saying that their possessor *can't* "comprehend the information"?  </s>
<s> At any rate this  </s>
<s> statement of principle seems spot on to me.  </s>
<s> Maybe de-negativization as: "Make information availability independent of users' physical (sensory/motor) or device (user agent) capability"?  </s>
<s> Love.  </s>
<s> ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE  </s>
<s> Cognitive barriers is a way of saying that the document contains artificial barriers which prevent understanding.  </s>
