<s> Comments (part 1) on: The page I experimented with is at  </s>
<s> (It still needs work)  </s>
<s> I realise that the [Shortcut] link is for accessibility reasons, but it confused me for a while.  </s>
<s> It is really not useful for the sighted reader, and will confuse a lot of people, I am sure.  </s>
<s> Is there no way we can hide it in the markup, so that accessible user agents  </s>
<s> see it, and no one else has to be confronted with it?  </s>
<s> Does an empty a with a title work?  </s>
<s> a href="#latest" accesskey="j" title="Latest message" /a .  </s>
<s> I'm a big believer in maximising the content and minimising the wasted space.  </s>
<s> How about moving the icon into the h1 (and making the h1 class="head")?  </s>
<s> The icon positioning would need to be adjusted, but it gives at least three more lines of real content.  </s>
<s> Visually I don't think the hr/ is needed at the top.  </s>
<s> The search box and the following headings already break it up visually.  </s>
<s> Visually I feel the table needs to be indented a little  </s>
<s> I think "re-sorted" should just be "sorted"  </s>
<s> Move the "by" into the header, so it reads "sorted by", and then the columns  </s>
<s> are just thread, author, and subject.  </s>
<s> Move the em from the th s into the stylesheet.  </s>
<s> The 'title's of the links are inconsistent.  </s>
<s> I would make them "March 2002 by  </s>
<s> date", "March 2002 by thread", "March 2002 by author", "March 2002 by subject".  </s>
<s> There are empty rows between the December and the January rows of the tables.  </s>
<s> Apparently this is to signal a change of year, but visually this is very subtle, and I'm guessing it's not that useful from an accessibility point of view either.  </s>
<s> How about having a tbody for each year with a suitable title: tbody title="2002" ... tbody title="2001" ...  </s>
<s> this handles the accessibility.  </s>
<s> Now the visual.  </s>
<s> Hmm neither Opera nor Netscape 6 seem to do margins or borders on tbody .  </s>
<s> That still needs work.  </s>
<s> There should be no br/ after the address tag at the bottom.  </s>
<s> I'm not sure of the value of the extra help link at the bottom (it is  </s>
<s> already at the top).  </s>
<s> I'm guessing that it would be more useful if the accesskey was on the top link, not the bottom one.  </s>
<s> Is there a reason that the accesskey for help is a capital H, and all the other ones lower-case?  </s>

<s> I don't know if an empty a would work... Al?  </s>
<s> Ian has made a suggestion to have a navigation bar in the index page too, and instead of the "shortcut" title, it would be something like "Latest message" which would propably make more sense?  </s>
<s> Otherwise, we could still hide it with a CSS rule.  </s>
<s> Well, an icon inside a h1 is defined as follow according to our house style guide (http://www.w3.org/Project/HouseStyle.html team only): For the home page of an area or subarea, Inside and at the start of the H1, put a large image connected wit the icon or else the icon itself.  </s>
<s> This is the defining occurence of the icon.  </s>
<s> I would rather add a CSS rule to make the icon float on the left.  </s>
<s> Anyway, very good suggestion regarding minimizing the wasted space.  </s>
<s> Indeed, I'll remove it.  </s>
<s> Do you mean there should be more space on the left?  </s>
<s> The re-sorted title has been suggested as being clearer for accessible  </s>
<s> reasons.  </s>
<s> Same as above.  </s>
<s> Good point.  </s>
<s> The current titles have been suggested by Al. Al, what do you think?  </s>
<s> I think having the word "messages" is clearer for those that have it read by their browser.  </s>
<s> I hadn't noticed the empty row, and I like your suggestion of 2 tbody.  </s>
<s> Regarding visual appearance, I hope this can be handled through CSS.  </s>
<s> Good point, will fix.  </s>
<s> Regarding the help link at the bottom, it's not the same as the one at the top (one is for the mail search engine, the other is for the archives).  </s>
<s> It might be moved on the top if we follow Ian's suggestions (sorry, these are not yet on wai-xtech, I hope they'll be soon).  </s>
<s> Thanks a lot for your very careful reading and your very good comments!  </s>

<s> Yes.  </s>
<s> reasons.  </s>
<s> I would like to have *that* explained to me!  </s>
<s> At the point we are at in the hierarchy, we aren't looking at anything sorted.  </s>
<s> If we were in a sorted list, then re-sorted would be fine, but we aren't yet.  </s>
<s> columns  </s>
<s> I can believe that one a bit more, though I doubt accessibility is really improved at this micro-level.  </s>
<s> 2002 by  </s>
<s> I don't care, as long as they are consistent.  </s>
<s> Currently they are: title="August 2001 messages listed by author" title="August 2001 threads of discussion" title="August 2001 messages listed by subject"  </s>
<s> I had hoped that too.  </s>
<s> But I couldn't get it to work.  </s>

<s> I don't have any good argument for this.  </s>
<s> Once again, this was proposed by other people than me.  </s>
<s> It really is: most people using aural browsers go from link to link (vs reading the full web page) and a link saying "by thread" is a little more informative than "thread".  </s>
<s> I see, I hadn't understood it that way.  </s>
<s> Hmm... I don't see that as a too big problem though.  </s>
