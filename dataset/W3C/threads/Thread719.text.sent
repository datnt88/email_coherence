Hi everyone, Here is a problem I encoutered, not so much with tidy, but rather with a page not being displayed at all. 
This may be a little off-topic, but I folks on this list seemed quite knoledgable to me, so I'll try anyways. 
Here's the problem: I've to a page written in XTHML 1.0, I ran tidy on it, and validated it using WDG-Validator. 
The pages validates as XHTML 1.0 without warnings and errors. 
Unfortunately, MSIE 5 is not able to display the page. 
It keeps complaining about accented characters in the text (chiefly "?"). 
If i replace all occurences of umlauts and "?" with the respective entities, MSIE complains that the entity &amp;eacute; is unknown. 
(I have specified the charset property). 
All other browsers I tried (Netscape 4.76 (Win, Solaris, Linux), Netscape 6 (Linux) Opera 5 (Wind), Opera 4 (Linux) had absolutely no problem rendering these pages. 
As soon as I replace the DTD for XHTML with the one for HTML 4.01 and remove the ?xml 
version="1.0"? 
in the first line of the page, MSIE renders the page flawlessly, too. 
If you want to take a look, try differ only in the DTD line. 
Has anyone encountered this before? 
What did I miss?

*** Stephen -- I'm certainly no expert on this but I have been able to replicate your problem. 
Somehow, I think the MSXML support in IE is messed up. 
If I save the document to my local drive, it works fine if I use a .html 
suffix but not an .xml 
suffix. 
Perhaps you'd have better luck posting this on a MS IE related list. 
I've never been able to find a clear explanation of exactly the steps that MSXML support in IE goes through to render a page. 
I would have at least thought that I'd get an error message somewhere but I don't even see that. 
Gary If you use XHTML as HTML, with a MIME type of text/html, the built-in entities of the browser can be used. 
When you use XHTML as XML, with a MIME type of text/xml or application/xml, all entities would need to be defined (no other XML processor would process an XML document with something like &amp;auml; either) Klaus Johannes Rusch KlausRusch@atmedia.net 
How do I influence whether the MIME type text/html or text/xml is used? 
Isn't that what the content-type header is used for? 
I configured my tidy to output xhtml but *not* to produce xml. 
The document in question starts like this: !DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd" 
I checked the tidy-configurarion file and noticed that add-xml-decl has been turned on. 
Will it be sufficient to remove the ?xml 
... declaration at the very beginning of the file go get the file to render correctly in MSIE? 
On the other hand the XHTML doc at http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/ says (just below the first example): Note that in this example, the XML declaration is included. 
An XMLdeclaration like the one above is not required in all XML documents. 
XHTML document authors are strongly encouraged to use XML declarations in all their documents. 
Such a declaration is required when the character encoding of the document is other than the default UTF-8 or UTF-16. 
Are there any MSIE specific mailing lists or newsgroups I could take this problem to? 
They may have a FAQ which covers this.. Cheers -- Stephan Stephan Engelke engelke@gmx.net

*** Typically, your web server controls which mime types are sent. 
I've found these instructions for Apache, but the steps would be slightly different for other web servers: Alex Bischoff 3812078 on ICQ export-a-crypto-system-sig RSA-2-lines-PERL print pack"C*",split/\D+/,`echo "16iII*o\U@{$/=$z;[(pop,pop,unpack"H*", )]}\EsMsKsN0[lN*1lK[d2%Sa2/d0 X+d*lMLa^*lN%0]dsXx++lMlN/dsM0 J]dsJxp"|dc` Proof That There is Strength in Numbers -- http://www.distributed.net/ 
Yes (e.g., see section 7.4.4 of the HTML 4.01 Specification), and it appears that your server is honoring the header when the page is requested: HTTP/1.1 200 OK Date: Wed, 10 Jan 2001 16:06:00 GMT Server: Apache/1.3.14 (Unix) PHP/4.0.2 PHP/3.0.17 Connection: close Content-Type: text/html (This is via http://www.delorie.com/web/headers.html -- the "HTTP Header Viewer" -- a very useful resource.) 
But perhaps IE isn't utilizing the returned Content-type header? 
You might try: microsoft.public.windows.inetexplorer.ie55.browser 
microsoft.public.windows.inetexplorer.ie5.programming.xml 
microsoft.public.xml at the NNTP server: msnews.microsoft.com -- Dave MSIE ignores Content-type headers and determines the content type "automatically".
