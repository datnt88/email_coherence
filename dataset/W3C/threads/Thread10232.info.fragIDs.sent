<s> Thus I am not a good person to comment on whether the semantics LCC actually matches the intent of the RDF Core WG. Given the number of errors that I have caught, both internal inconsistencies and mismatches with my partial understanding of the intent of the RDF Core WG, I feel that the document needs a thorough review by someone who can check that it matches the intent of the RDF Core WG.  </s>

<s> I've quickly looked over the new version.  </s>
<s> The semantics still has strange behaviour with respect to rdfs:Literal and untyped literals.  </s>
<s> The semantic conditions boil down to ICEXT(I(rdfs:Literal)) = LV ICEXT(D) = ICEXT(I(rdfs:Literal)) for D a datatype This means that with XML Schema datatyping I("1"^^xsd:decimal) in ICEXT(I(rdfs:Literal)) I("a"^^xsd:string) in ICEXT(I(rdfs:Literal)) but I("a") not necesarily in ICEXT(I(rdfs:Literal))  </s>
<s> The Lbase appendix still has errors.  </s>
<s> It does not accord rdfs:XMLLiteral its special status with respect to language tags.  </s>
<s> It is not a consequence of the RDFS model theory that rdfs:XMLLiteral(?x) implies rdfs:Literal(?x).  </s>
<s> It is not a consequence of the RDFS model theory that untyped literals belong to rdfs:Literal.  </s>
<s> There are other errors as well.  </s>
<s> The semantics has problems with respect to LV. LV is mandated to contain all literal strings (which is not defined in the document), pairs of literal strings and language tags (which is also not defined), and all well-formed canonical XML documents (there is no pointer given here for this).  </s>
<s> IL is defined to take typed literals with type rdf:XMLLiteral to XML canonical forms.  </s>
<s> It is certainly not obvious that XML canonical forms have any particular relationship to well-formed canonical XML documents.  </s>
<s> However, even if this is ironed out, there is no particular relationship between rdf:XMLLiteral and rdfs:Literal in RDFS.  </s>
<s> The class extension of rdfs:Literal in RDFS interpretations need not include any well-formed canonical XML documents.  </s>
<s> This only comes from the (newly modified) fourth condition in datatyped interpretations.  </s>
<s> The special status rdf:XMLLiteral is not respected in datatyped interpretations, which require that IL(x@"en"^^rdf:XMLLiteral) = IL(x@"fr"^^rdf:XMLLiteral)  </s>
<s> The Lbase document is still not a W3C Note.  </s>
<s> It should have some formal status before the Semantics document goes to last call, as changes to it will affect the Semantics document.  </s>

<s> Unfortunately, IL is inconsistently defined for rdf:XMLLiteral In Section 3.1 there is if ... IL("xxx"^^rdf:XMLLiteral) is the XML canonical form of xxx if ... IL("xxx"@yyy^^rdf:XMLLiteral) is the XML canonical form of xxx with the language tag yyy In Section 3.4 there is for any typed literal L of the form "sss"^^ddd or "sss"@ttt^^ddd in G, if I(ddd) is in D and "sss" ("sss"@ttt) is a valid lexical form for I(ddd), then IL(L) = L2V(I(ddd))(sss) which is inconsitent for rdf:XMLLiteral as long as there is any langauge-tagged XML document whose canonical form depends on the language tag.  </s>
<s> (I have actually fixed up the semantic rule.  </s>
<s> As it is actually stated, it doesn't even make sense.) Peter F. Patel-Schneider Bell Labs Research  </s>
<s> This is not inconsistent, because it is the lexical form of the  </s>
<s> XMLLiteral which contains the language tag.  </s>
<s> I.e., the lexical form of an XMLLiteral can be a pair, not just the XML encoded string.  </s>
<s> C.f. section 3.4 The built-in datatype rdf:XMLLiteral, exceptionally, allows pairs in its lexical space.  </s>
<s> What's unclear here is the mapping from the syntax to the "complete" lexical form of the XML literal.  </s>
<s> I.e. IL("sss"^^ddd) = L2V(I(ddd))("sss") IL("sss"@en^^ddd) = L2V(I(ddd))("sss") IL("sss"^^xml) = L2V(I(xml))("sss","") IL("sss"@en^^xml) = L2V(I(xml))("sss","en") where xml is rdfs:XMLLiteral and ddd is any datatype other than rdfs:XMLLiteral.  </s>
<s> Thus, the rule is consistent, but the exceptional nature of the lexical forms of XMLLiteral needs to be made clearer.  </s>
<s> (As an aside, I personally consider the exceptional nature of XML literals to be a mistake, for lots of reasons, but that's the way they are defined so the "fix" at this stage is to simply make the specs clear about it).  </s>

<s> Hmm.  </s>
<s> Actually, it might be OK, but only because of the wording outside of the conditions that the extra conditions are ``on all datatypes other than the built-in datatype''.  </s>
<s> This wording is cryptic in the extreme.  </s>
<s> There also  </s>
<s> needs to be some clarification here as to whether datatypes are members of the domain or URI references.  </s>
<s> The individual conditions in the table need to have the exclusion explicitly and individually stated by something link, ``if I(ddd) is in D-I(rdf:XMLLiteral)''.  </s>
<s> However, adding this exclusion to the fourth condition would require adding a subclass relationship between rdf:XMLLiteral and rdfs:Literal (which should, in any case, go into RDFS interpretations).  </s>
<s> Otherwise, however, these extra conditions *require* that IL("..."@en^^rdf:XMLLiteral) = L2V(I(rdf:XMLLiteral))("...") and IL("..."@fr^^rdf:XMLLiteral) = L2V(I(rdf:XMLLiteral))("...") which requires that the denotation of XML literals be independant of the language tag.  </s>
<s> The translation to Lbase ignores language tags for all typed literals.  </s>
<s> Agreed.  </s>

<s> Hi Peter,  </s>
<s> I think that's a good point.  </s>
<s> We have had three reviewers go through it, so I think its close to our intent, but your sharp eyes have identified some issues.  </s>
<s> One of the issues may be that we have looked at it so often.  </s>
<s> We are not seeing it with fresh eyes.  </s>
<s> One of the reasons I think we need to get more eyes on it.  </s>
<s> I note your later post where you point out this may be covered but need clearer explanation, if I understand you correctly.  </s>
<s> [[Actually, it might be OK, but only because ...]] I'm currently inclined to deal with this in last call, but we will discuss this at Friday's telecon.  </s>
<s> Hmm, that's a shame.  </s>
<s> However, again I think of these as editorial errors and suggest that we take those that we can't do as a quick fix, as last call issues.  </s>
<s> Right.  </s>
<s> Its been ready for a while, we've just been prioritizing other things.  </s>
<s> Publication is already approved - we just need to crank up the publishing machine.  </s>

<s> The issue that I refer to here is that the model theory does not require that "a" is an element of the class extension of rdfs:Literal.  </s>
<s> There is nothing technically wrong with this stance, but it has strange consequences.  </s>
<s> Hmm. I would regard this as a less-than-ideal situation.  </s>
