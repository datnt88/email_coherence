Dear Dave, every time I run my file thru tidy this line gets shifted further to the right. 
Because it's Chinese?

I can't reproduce this with the current code and the August 04 release, in fact, Tidy reduces white space to a single space character here.

Dan, could you be a bit more specific with what version of Tidy you used, and what config and/or command line options you used. 
The reason I ask is that I am currently trying to track down a bug in the current (01 Oct 01) version of Tidy when using the Big5 or Shift-JIS encodings (and appropriate options to Tidy) ONLY, where the line wrapping algorithm has a problem (it causes NULL characters to be output). 
Regards, Terry
