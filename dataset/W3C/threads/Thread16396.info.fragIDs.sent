<s> Hi, Does anyone know if Microsoft Agent Technology is accessible?  </s>
<s> If I program agent characters like Merlin and Genie through Javascripts and load them on a web page, can screenreaders like JFW get access to the text that the character 'speaks'?  </s>
<s> Is accessibility implemented through MSAA?  </s>
<s> Any thoughts/ideas would be appreciated.  </s>
<s> Thanks.  </s>

<s> I do not think that MSAA is currently implemented in Microsoft Agent, but it was something the Accessibility and Disabilities Group talked about with them, and I think they are working on it.  </s>
<s> Send mail to Tandy Trower - I think he is in charge of the project tandyt@microsoft.com,  </s>
<s> I think.  </s>
<s> Of course, for someone using a screenreader, Agent shouldn't be a problem - they speak what is shown on the screen - so the only problem is if you're using a software based synthesizer - sometimes it is difficult for two applications to use the sound card at the same time.  </s>
