Hi, Does anyone know if Microsoft Agent Technology is accessible? 
If I program agent characters like Merlin and Genie through Javascripts and load them on a web page, can screenreaders like JFW get access to the text that the character 'speaks'? 
Is accessibility implemented through MSAA? 
Any thoughts/ideas would be appreciated. 
Thanks.

I do not think that MSAA is currently implemented in Microsoft Agent, but it was something the Accessibility and Disabilities Group talked about with them, and I think they are working on it. 
Send mail to Tandy Trower - I think he is in charge of the project tandyt@microsoft.com, 
I think. 
Of course, for someone using a screenreader, Agent shouldn't be a problem - they speak what is shown on the screen - so the only problem is if you're using a software based synthesizer - sometimes it is difficult for two applications to use the sound card at the same time.
