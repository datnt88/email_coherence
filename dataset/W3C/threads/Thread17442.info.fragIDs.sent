I suppose most are aware of the Section 508 standards for accessible Electronic Information and Technology in the U.S., but I came across an accessibility checker, "STEP508" at the GSA website: The program is described as: "STEP508 is an excellent tool to assist in the repair of Web sites with large numbers of pages (sites with legacy content, sites with many authors/owners who may not be familiar with accessibility issues) STEP508 is not designed for new projects. 
Instead, Web developers should be trained well in accessibility practices, accessible coding, and testing/validating the site for accessibility." 
I downloaded the file and will install it; yet, I am wondering if others will, as well, and have some opinions to share about the program. 
Do we really need another checker? 
Is this any better, or worse, than others?

STEP508 is not "another checker" - it's a tool for prioritizing the errors that other checkers tell you about. 
It was clearly explained on the web site: What specifically does STEP508 do? 
STEP508 uses the output of accessibility evaluation tools (such as Bobby, LIFT, etc.) and Compares the results of these evaluations (how your site performed on Bobby vs. LIFT, etc.) Prioritizes the errors/accessibility problems that were identified (identifies the errors that are most critical to fix to make your site accessible) Tracks the progress of your accessibility repair efforts over time (gives you a baseline "score" and provides metrics to quantitatively monitor/report your improvements) It was built by WGBH/NCAM and others Regards, Phill Jenkins 
Hello All, I just downloaded, installed and ran "Step"... Does anyone know anything more about it on the list? 
I looked in the help and there was no location to contact the developers. 
I just downloaded 0.0.14 and had a few questions in case anyone knows the product: 1. 
On Several Occasions I get an error: Not Implemented Yet So I assume there is a newer version (Does anyone know the Link?) 2. It appears to have been developed to work with XML, does anyone know if it will be supporting W3C EARL ( http://www.w3.org/2001/03/earl/ ) so that it won't be vendor specific. 
And will support all QA Systems 3. And Perhaps a more important question. 
When Looking at Section 508, is there a less important Accessibility Failure. 
I notice they have an option to treat all checkpoints equally which seems most logical, so if this is the case and without a business related process how can one perform Error Prioritization? 
**** And Most Important: In the help it says: Severity: How seriously does the error impede the accessibility of information? 
While all errors will degrade the accessibility of a web site, some will have a more severe impact on the web site visitor than others. 
STEP allows for all errors to be considered equally or for the built-in severity index to be applied to errors. 
Repairability: How much time does it take to fix the error? 
Can the error be fixed by an automated tool, or will it require a manual (human) fix? 
Location: How "easy" is it to get to the error? 
Importance: Some pages (index pages, gateway pages, high-traffic pages) are more important than others, and consequently the errors on those pages are more important to fix. 
STEP automatically detects index pages, but STEP users can input to the tool which pages on their site they consider to be most important. 
Since the Government was involved in development (Listed as a co developer) of this GSA Specifically, if someone from there or maybe from the Access Board can Chime in on what error is more or less important in the eyes of the access board or the fed it would be great! 
Being a tool developed by the US Federal Government I am curious as to what of the 508 Standard is more or less important.
