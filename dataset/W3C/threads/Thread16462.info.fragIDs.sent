<s> What is the general feeling about DHTML/CSS Filters?  </s>
<s> (See  </s>
<s> example, or http://msdn.microsoft.com/workshop/author/filter/filters.asp for all the details.) They seem to be a much more accessible alternative to the image-based rollovers that so many designers (&amp; clients) seem to love.  </s>
<s> While they seem to be a Microsoft-only feature, they do degrade gracefully on non-MS browsers, leaving just the original text without the filter's styling effects.  </s>
<s> And, using CSS's "hover", you can even get the rollover-type effects without scripting.  </s>
<s> Just trying to figure out why I haven't seen them in use more often - any insights appreciated...  </s>
<s> Thanks, Mike  </s>

<s> I only ever used them on something where accessibility of any description wasn't an issue (I was just playing with the technology, and doing a few deliberately bad things to see what happens).  </s>
<s> And agree that they would probably be more accessible than at least some of the other types of mouseovers, etc.  </s>
<s> I imagine the reason they aren't used much is that they are only IE-applicable, and also some of the more complicated things that can  </s>
<s> be done with them are difficult, which may put developers off the whole thing.  </s>
<s> When you consider that there is a strong overlap between those developers who take particular pains to build accessible sites, and those who believe in following standards for other reasons it may be that this is why they aren't often used to make rollovers more accessible).  </s>

<s> They also work in Opera, iCab, and NS6, I believe.  </s>
<s> As for why people don't use them more--I see them quite frequently.  </s>
<s> If people are not using them, it may be because they are generally leary of css.  </s>
