<s> Basic changes have been made to all the files to accomodate namespace, etc -- the files have not been compiled (Curt, your directions don't work on my win 2000 system, and I haven't figured out what's wrong yet), so I am sure that there are some problems with strings not quoted, or possibly a variable not declared, etc.  </s>
<s> We just need to slap the metadata info around the code and I'll be happy to put them into CVS.  </s>
<s> I wouldn't pull from the test matrix, as the files are out of date.  </s>
<s> If someone could just propose the metadata file, I can tweak a previous transformation, and put the appropriate info in the test files -- my CVS public key doesn't seem to allow access to the repository yet, but I'd be happy enough to make a distribution available and have someone else put them in.  </s>
