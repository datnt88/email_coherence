Dimitris and I would prefer using *.domtest, Fred would prefer a /files subdirectory and neither group would veto the other. 
At this point, it is basically Mary's call. 
I think that we are all anxious to have at least some tests in the CVS so we can move forward. 
If there is some technical problem, like you can't access the CVS, then if you could provide the tests to one of us and we can put it in the CVS on your behalf. 
If the current files are in the test 
matrix or otherwise accessible on the NIST site, then I'd be willing to do something like my previous scraping to get the files into the CVS. 
Mary, are there any other issues that need to be resolved before we are able to add the tests to the CVS and is there anything we can do to speed the process? 
That's my preference, but no more than that. 
I'll certainly get over the emotional distress caused by an x.7 filename within, oh, five or six years. 
Let's just get on with it!

I think my preference is to go with Fred, with a /files subdirectory. 
I don't have a strong preference -- I just prefer leaving the file extensions as they are -- I just don't like a .domtest 
extension if it really is .xml 
inside. 
We need to resolve the metadata issue. 
There has been some discussion, but I don't recall resolution. 
Basic changes have been made to all the files to accomodate namespace, etc -- the files have not been compiled (Curt, your directions don't work on my win 2000 system, and I haven't figured out what's wrong yet), so I am sure that there are some problems with strings not quoted, or possibly a variable not declared, etc. 
We just need to slap the metadata info around the code and I'll be happy to put them into CVS. 
I wouldn't pull from the test matrix, as the files are out of date. 
If someone could just propose the metadata file, I can tweak a previous transformation, and put the appropriate info in the test files -- my CVS public key doesn't seem to allow access to the repository yet, but I'd be happy enough to make a distribution available and have someone else put them in.
