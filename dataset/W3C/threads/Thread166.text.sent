Pretty layout problem when TIDY'd (? sp.) looks like this !-- comment goes here -- !--#include file="footer.inc" 
-- !-- another comment goes here -- Certainly a problem, because the two have different content. 
Put this in an element: This has content '\n' ' !--#include file="footer.inc" 
-- ' '\n' in HTML, or '\n\n' ' !--#include file="footer.inc" 
-- ' '\n\n' in XHTML. 
The flattened form loses some of the newlines. 
Does Tidy always do this, or only in elements where spaces are squished ( P and the like)? 
Hi, Maybe I miss something, but an include file normally contains HTML, e.g. the content of a navigation bar. 
When you put this between pre and /pre , you can get into trouble with the document the server finally transmits to the user. 
In this case I would not change anything with the HTML source, but would really like to see tidy change. 
Here we are only concerned with the pretty printing function of tidy. 
I don't know of any instances, where authors want their comments to be moved around (like being appended to the end of the previous line. 
So I would like to see tidy change to leave comments where they are. 
The only issue one might argue about is indenting. 
BTW, for this purpose, include statements are just comments.

The point remains: the comment moving that HTML Tidy did in the original example CHANGES THE CONTENT of the document. 
It seems as if HTML Tidy is assuming that comments are like tags, where a #RE; following a start-tag is ignored. 
But comments are not like tags. 
Whether on aesthetic grounds or on content grounds, we are agreed that newlines after comments should not be removed. 
No. There is no change, whitespaces aren't significant at that point.
