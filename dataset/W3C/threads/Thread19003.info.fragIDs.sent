<s> Message pages are very noisy.  </s>
<s> Your primary aim is to read the message, the other things are secondary; yet you have to do a lot to get to the message body.  </s>
<s> I have experimented with quietening them down.  </s>
<s> The information is still there (in the titles), but not so in your face.  </s>
<s> See other changes on the example page mentioned above.  </s>
<s> General comments on navigation.  </s>
<s> I note that the hierarchy of the lists are as follows: 1: Archives (many lists) 2: List (one particular list) 3: Sorted view (by author, by date, etc) 4: Message.  </s>
<s> Looking at the navigation you can always get from level n to level n+1.  </s>
<s> You can get from 4 to 3 You can get from 4 to 1 You can get from 3 to 1  </s>
<s> But you can't get from 4 to 2, from 3 to 2, or from 2 to 1: level 2 seems to  </s>
<s> be level-non-grata.  </s>
<s> You can only get to it by going to 1, and then down  </s>
<s> again, and from that level you can only get to its parent by going down one level, and up two (which I often end up doing).  </s>
<s> I suggest that level 2 be treated as a first class citizen, so that you can get to it from all its descendents, and you can get from it to its parent.  </s>

<s> Hmmm...  </s>
<s> I'm not sure I agree.  </s>
<s> I like the idea of having most of the email preserved as is in the pre tag.  </s>
<s> Could you give more input on this?  </s>
<s> Your version is interesting, but some things won't work in production mode: for instance, a message can have several "Next" and "Next in thread" messages: how would you incorporate them in one list?  </s>
<s> yes, you can.  </s>
<s> The link "this list, more time" is supposed to link to 2 in 3 and 4.  </s>
<s> I don't think that there is a so strong relationship between 2 and 1. See my reply to David's mail:  </s>

<s> Oh, I'm very sure of this one.  </s>
<s> The only reason that mail messages need to be in monospace is that some people do layout with whitespace.  </s>
<s> Monospace is a relatively difficult-to-read font; proportional spaced fonts are always easier to read.  </s>
<s> However, there is nothing in the headers that require you to display them in monospace.  </s>
<s> Therefore, to make a more readable page, you should minimise the amount in monospace by displaying the headers in proportional.  </s>
<s> See my example at http://www.cwi.nl/~steven/w3c/lists/ml-message.html (I also reduced the size of the Message-id line, because it contains no readable information, but you might want to refer to it on rare occasions.)  </s>

<s> Look at weep).  </s>
<s> I don't think I ever saw more than one [next]; I have seen more [reply]s though.  </s>
<s> What's hard about [next] [previous] [in reply to] [next in thread] [reply] [reply] [reply]  </s>
<s> Are you sure?  </s>
<s> Because of the word 'more', I assumed it meant a different version of level 3. (I couldn't try it because the link didn't work).  </s>
<s> But I thought David's suggestions were really good.  </s>
<s> I think there is a strong relationship between all the levels, and I use them all (and would use the missing ones if I could, and often get annoyed that I can't navigate easily to level 2).  </s>

<s> OK, good point.  </s>
<s> I'll implement that too.  </s>
<s> A suggestion then: we could add an alternate stylesheet removing the pre-formating of the pre element.  </s>
<s> What do you think?  </s>
<s> Right, I realized that I was wrong and that only "reply" could have several instances.  </s>
<s> In my new proposal (http://www.w3.org/2002/03/archives-improvements/ml-message),  </s>
<s> I have added a link [ replies ] to the list of replies at the bottom of the page.  </s>
<s> Yes, I'm sure.  </s>
<s> The link has been changed to say "more about this list".  </s>
<s> I think that's clearer.  </s>
<s> Are you really using http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/ ?  </s>

<s> Hmm... Implemented it in result is not as cool as I would have hoped since we lose all the formating by moving from white-space:pre to white-space:normal, and especially we lose the separation in paragraph.  </s>
<s> So, unless there is a way that some br/ be added where there is line returns on the original mail [well, I guess there is a way, but an easily implementable way], I'm not sure it would really be useful.  </s>
<s> Steven, any other idea?  </s>
<s> Well, I usually go to mailing lists through my bookmarks, and, the first time, through a link in the relevant page [working group, announcement].  </s>
<s> For public mailing list, I usually prefer http://www.w3.org/Mail/Lists even though it's not complete.  </s>
<s> But http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/ is really the worse for me.  </s>
<s> But I understand that you and others find it useful.  </s>
<s> I hope we can find a good way too integrate it in an hypothetical navigation bar.  </s>

<s> I use it and its peer in Member space all the time.  </s>
<s> How are you trying to use it?  </s>
<s> It's the way I find out how they spelled the name of some list I am looking for, including when I don't know if it is Member or Public.  </s>
<s> I can usually guess enough of a substring of the list name to find the list quickly in this listing.  </s>
<s> I can quickly scan all lists with 'dom' in their name and pick the one I want.  </s>
<s> I also operationally use the URL path hierarchy in getting there.  </s>
<s> I go in my history list to either a Member or Public message page I visited, and truncate the URL to go to the index.  </s>
<s> Since I am doing this with character deletes in a command line, I get to before I reach and so I never get to the latter (where I get a 403 error anyway).  </s>
