Jon, Who says, in answer to "What's the date today?", 
"Oh, its 2003, December 5th" ? 
I think that is a more valid analogy than the format of decimal numbers. 
(I'd never think of it when trying to decipher a date, but I am not a programmer nor a mathematician.) 
*If* there are no language constraints, then spelling the month out is unambiguous whatever format (conventional US, EU, JP) you choose. 
(I realise that is a big if) 
And as Tina says, no Europeans I know use the ISO standard in real life, 
which is presumably what we were originally discussing in the context of form entries.

Yes, I mustn't have been making myself clear when I said that you should use 
the full month name if you can. 
It's only when a client is stupid enough to insist on a short date (for reasons 
I never understand but figure must have something to do with the physical size 
on the screen) but not so stupid as to insist on having a date like 03/04/1984 that I'd use 8601 in a human-targetted context. 
Despite knowing a few Europeans who use 8601 in real life (mostly people like myself who got used to it from particular contexts) I'll agree with that. 
The 
problem is though that the formats 03/04/1984, 04/03/1984, 03-04-1984 and 04-03- 1984 simply don't work unless: 
a. You have good locale information about the user (language isn't enough for anything better than a good guess). 
b. 
The user knows you have good locale information about them, and hence that you chose the format they'd use, rather than your own preference.

Here is an easy to understand reason for designs that use short dates that has nothing to do with the intellect level of the client - data base limitations. 
Many sites use data base driven content. 
I believe achieving a and b below is impossible on the world wide web. 
Clearly 
stating the date format used on a site [or page of a site] and consistently following that format should minimize date confusion for ALL users. 
This applies to both rendered dates as well as input formats on forms.

That, I would hope, is when you point out to said client that the 
system isn't going to be very userfriendly, that the size of the screen is an unknown factor, and that accessibility actually matters. 
After all, a demand for frames would not mean you used that without pointing out the accessibility implications ? 
Not, but the format "xx monthname year-with-four-digits" 
work in all contexts; written - of course - fully and in the same natural language as the document itself. 
If you then want to use the ISO format internally, fine. 
However, if 
you MUST use an abbreviated, locale-dependent, format towards the end user, then I still suggest dd-mm-yyyy - and, of course, always include that, as the OP had done. 
input type="text" size="16" would be my suggestion.

No, that - which I seem unable to quote - is a reason to use short 
date formats *internally*. 
There is no reason what so ever to use the same, restricted by database technology, formats *externally*.

Why would you store the date as a string? 
Databases prefer something like 1071187200000 to either 12/12/2003, 12/12/2003, or any other format. 
It would still be far clearer to use the names of months and select elements 
though.

Sometimes with success, sometimes without. 
Yes, that's why that was the suggestion I made to begin with, although I wouldn't scream at the thought of month dd yyyy. 
And of course the only time HTML uses dates internally they must be in ISO format. 
If designing a human-readable but machine targetted system I'd strongly recommend ISO, but that's even more off-topic than we already are. 
However, if 
If I MUST use and abbreviated locale-dependent format, I'll use which locale I MUST use. 
If I MUST use an abbreviated format I'd use the only locale-independent format that's available. 
Funnily I've been asked by Irish clients (dd/mm/yyyy is the convention here) to use mm/dd/yyyy. 
They'd rather think mm/dd/yyyy will bring in more dollars than dd/mm/yyyy will euros and pounds.

You would actually write "January 05 2003" ?

No but some people would. 
Personally I'd write 5 sup th /sup January 2003. 
But I'd much rather be forced to produce January 05 2003 than 01/05/2003.

And being in the US I would use MM-DD-YYYY. 
That's where the problem comes 
in but in reality as long as it is clearly stated which format you want/need 
people to use it doesn't really matter because intuitive is only good for local users not only because of the different date structure order but also because of the different separators people use. 
I then to use - but my bank requires /, neither is wrong but can mess up some validators. 
It does on my bank site and drives me nuts when I get an error and have to go back and change it as I have to do at least half of the time. 
Same thing about someone's earlier comment on requiring the + on phone numbers. 
In the US we don't use + so for many, if not most people it wouldn't register what they are being asked to provide. 
Forms are difficult unless you know for a fact that you will only get visitors from a limited geographic area. 
I have friends in New Zealand and Singapore who complain that the most commonly used contact and order forms will not accept their addresses because they don't allow enough lines or require items such as county or state that aren't used in their countries.

and even though I am in the USA I work internationally and long ago adopted the DD-MM-YYYY format but it confused so many people I almost universally now DD-MMM-YYYY spelling out the abreviation of the month. 
ie 5 Dec 2003 or 05-Dec-2003 
which is why I preefer to put in the DD-MM-YYYY which replaces as the date is typed in. 
and in some areas of the USA we now have to dial all 10 numbers even for a local call. 
so rather than using (***) ***-**** tele numbers are being written 123-456-7890 
yes if I even suspect I will get someone from someplace else I put an extra address line in and require a country to be entered ie: name address1 address2 city state/province/ken postal code country Bob

I'm afraid it is a common observation from outside the USA that you don't admit to the existence of the rest of the world. 
I don't think that many people outside the USA know the international access prefix from the USA, so, if US businesses don't understand +, they will have problems contacting overseas customers, who will publish international numbers with a +, not with the US outgoing international code (the most common international access code outside the USA is 00, although the UK used to use 010 - I don't think the US uses 00, but I might be wrong). 
(The fact that the default long distance carrier access code within the USA is the same as the USA's country code adds to the confusion.) 
The only time that people in the UK use + explicitly is with GSM phones. 
Using it allows them, for example, to work internationally from the USA and Europe without having to reprogram all the numbers with a different international access code. 
Even if you understand +, you unfortunately also need to understand that UK businesses don't follow the guidelines and, typically, add (0) after their own country code.
