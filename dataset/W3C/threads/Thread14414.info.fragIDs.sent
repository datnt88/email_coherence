<s> using JFW 3.50.37  </s>
<s> to listen to the demo page, this is what i heard: 1) when the page loaded, JFW automatically read from the beginning of the first DIV (DIV tabindex="1" accesskey="d") through to the un-DiVed level one header "Demo", and then stopped speaking 2) using the accesskeys, i heard the following: 2A) ALT+N "Navigation Link One" "Navigation Link Two" (don't know why JFW didn't identify the links as links, though) 2B) ALT+A "ALT A" (keystroke echo only) -- when i routed the JAWS cursor to the application cursor (which was in the "ads" DIV), and issued the read line command, i heard "Navigation Link One An Ad For Something You Really Want" issuing the INSERT+TAB command (read current item with focus, used mostly to speak labels associated with form controls, but which also reads the current hyperlink, if the point-of-regard/focus is on a hyperlink) did not cause anything to be spoken 2C) ALT+C: caused JFW to speak the entire content of the "content" DIV tabindex="6" accesskey="C" , but again, JFW did not identify the links as links, as it is set to do 2D) ALT+D: caused JFW to read from the beginning of the first DIV ( DIV tabindex="1" accesskey="d" ) through to the un-DiVed level one header "Demo"; it also disabled the native UA command ALT+D, which moves focus to the "Address" bar (but i could still query the address bar using JFW's INSERT+A command, which reads the content of the address bar) 3) tabbing through the page, i heard: Navigation Link One Tabindex Directions Navigation Link Two Link An Ad For Something You Really Want link link link another link link subsequent pressing of the TAB key did not cycle through the tabindicies defined for the DIVs, but merely echoed the TAB key's label ("TAB") 4) my best experience of the page was obtained by reloading the page, squelching speech using the CONTROL key when the document finished rendering (and JFW announced "page has 5 links"), and then reviewing it using JFW's "ReadAll" command (INSERT+NumPad2) -- it read the page logically, and fully, and gave me a much better understanding of the page than any of the other methods i had yet attempted... 5) using JFW's Virtual Cursor, i was able to navigate the document in the following chunks: 5A) CONTROL+NumPad5 read first level 1 header "Directions" CONTROL+UpArrow read content of TITLE element: "Demo of Chunk Navigation" CONTROL+DownArrow (after returning to the "Directions" header) full contents of first paragraph in first DIV CONTROL+DownArrow full contents of second paragraph in first DIV full contents of third paragraph in first DIV CONTROL+DownArrow read second level one header "Demo" CONTROL+DownArrow read ("in one breath") link Navigation Link One link Navigation Link Two link An Ad For Something You Really Want CONTROL+DownArrow read content of the final DIV on the page contiguously, without differentiating between the level 2 header "Content" and the ensuing content (which isn't structurally marked up) Note: JFW did not announce the presence and dimensions of tables, as it is set to do (possibly because they occur inside and span DIVs?)

<s> question from Gregg with my comments.... From: Cynthia Shelly [mailto:cyns@microsoft.com] Subject: RE: demo of grouping with divs and accesskey An excellent question.  </s>
<s> In this demo I was just trying out the tech, and ignoring the UI issues (bad dev, no cookie ;).  </s>
<s> When we label form elements on our site, we underline the hotkey (following the windows style), but since these areas don't have text labels, that doesn't work.  </s>
<s> Some options I can think of off the top of my head: add a text label with an underlined letter define a standard set of shortcuts (n for nav etc) either for a site or in general.  </s>
<s> add explanatory text as I did in this example add explanatory text that is hidden from visual user agents and read by auditory user agents.  </s>
<s> I don't know of any markup that would do this, but there may be a way I'm not aware of.  </s>
<s> I'm also not sure if this is a good idea, since power-users could also benefit from this feature if they knew about it.  </s>
<s> have user agents expose all the "accesskey" attributes in a document listed with the title of the tag.  </s>
<s> This brings up another interesting issue.  </s>
<s> I'm not aware of any way to mark a character as a hotkey in a structural way.  </s>
<s> A quick cruise through the HTML 4 spec didn't yield anything obvious.  </s>
<s> We use underlines (either u or span style ) to mark them, which makes sense in a windows world, but doesn't make sense in an auditory UI.  </s>
<s> It would be interesting to have tag similar to the label tag that allowed an author to tie a hotkey to an area.  </s>
<s> something like This would allow user agents to choose a meaningful way to mark the x as a hotkey.  </s>
<s> --Cynthia Interesting I'm sure I'm missing something here but how would a person know what the access keys were?  </s>
