<s> Uh, not really.  </s>
<s> First the information has to get to the screen reader, which then needs to figure it out and use it.  </s>
<s> None do that currently.  </s>
<s> So adding LANG will not improve accessibility of pages today.  </s>
<s> Everyone has to cooperate - the author, the user agent and the assistive technology.  </s>
<s> Like I said, good idea - maybe even great idea, but not a priority 1 issue.  </s>
<s> Try this: 1) Write some web pages and use a screen reader with a multilingual speech engine.  </s>
<s> 2) Throw in some LANG attributes and start writing in French.  </s>
<s> 3) Listen as the screen reader interprets the French into English and starts speaking it using English.  </s>
<s> I won't debate the theoretical benefits, I'm sure there are many, but as a practical matter, is this issue so pressing that it MUST be done by page authors or their pages are inaccessible?  </s>
<s> The following needs to happen: 1) There needs to be a conduit of information about the language to the accessibility aid - DOM is the way to go here.  </s>
<s> This facility is already built into Active Accessibility.  </s>
<s> 2) The few existing assistive technology products that are multilingual need to rev and understand the information.  </s>
<s> The only screen reader currently that is multilingual, and uses the Dynamic HTML object model still reads the text off the screen, so the language info is useless without a revision.  </s>
<s> I'm not aware of anyone using the language information available via Active Accessibility.  </s>
<s> It's never been requested or commented on.  </s>
<s> 3) Get page authors to support it.  </s>
<s> My bar is fairly high for priority 1 issues.  </s>
<s> I just don't think that LANG attributes meet that bar.  </s>
<s> Does anyone else disagree?  </s>
<s> Charles Oppermann Program Manager, Accessibility and Disabilities Group, Microsoft Corporation "A computer on every desk and in every home, usable by everyone!"  </s>
<s> It should be remembered that there is not always a "screen reader" intermediary between the user agent and the text to speech software.  </s>
<s> Indeed, some user agents are designed from the start to provide speech output.  </s>
<s> I am not sure whether any of them supports the LANG attribute yet, but they will undoubtedly do so reasonably soon.  </s>
<s> The user agent group could introduce a priority 1 requirement to the effect that speech output systems must offer the user an option to override the language choice which is in effect.  </s>
<s> This would enable users to handle situations in which no language, or an incorrect language, is specified via the LANG attribute.  </s>
<s> Thus, I think there is a priority 1 issue here, but it belongs in the user agent guidelines.  </s>
<s> For our guidelines, the existing priority 2 requirement that the LANG attribute be specified where necessary, should remain.  </s>

<s> In theory, in HTML the charset and the language are two entirely independent issues.  </s>
<s> "charset" is a technical matter that relates only to the encoding of coded characters.  </s>
<s> There are three valid ways of including characters into an HTML document: coded characters, "numerical characer references" (&amp;#number; representation), and named character entities where available.  </s>
<s> Only one of these three representations is affected by the "charset": the others could in theory (and in practice too, if Netscape had been conformant to publised specifications) utilise an extensive repertoire of characters in a document whose "charset" was us-ascii, or whatever other charset was convenient to the author, just as it works in conforming browsers.  </s>
<s> It would be feasible to transmit, for example, Japanese using solely &amp;#number; representations of the Japanese characters, without any mention of an unusual "charset" in the Content-type header.  </s>

<s> Would it be possible to change the headers in Techniques document to something else than A.N or B.N?
