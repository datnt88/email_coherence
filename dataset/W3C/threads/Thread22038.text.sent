All, It's been quiet for quite some time, and I have a few observations/proposals. 
It may be that we need to reallocate/change some of the things each of us does, or is supposed to do, and in order to clarify this, I'd like each person involved to give a short recap of what they are currently or have been previously up to in relation to the DOM TS. 
I have myself had to decrease the work I've allocated on the DOM TS due to a change in my regular job situation. 
I coordinate between this group and the W3C DOM WG, I am still in charge of the documentation on trying to increase interest for the DOM TS among vendors and implementors of the DOM specification. 
The proposals: 1. Start using the Issue Tracker we have set up on Sourceforge. 
There's been parallel development, primarily on the ECMA framework, which needs to be brought in synch. 
Also, it seems that not all are frequent readers of the mailing list, so listing changes/additions/proposals to any part of the DOM TS on the issue tracker simplifies for all group members to keep in track 2. Move as quickly as possible to publishing the ODM Level 2 HTML and Core TS. Questions relating to some of the tests are hopefully going to be solved in the telephone conference that is being set up for Sept. 20 (more information to follow). 
3. In connection to 2, we should republish DOM L1 TS, using the new framework and also including the changes that have been made to some of the tests. 
/Dimitris No current activity. 
Will participate in conference call barring unforseen conflicts. 
I have been disappointed not to hear anything else from David Faure from MandrakeSoft. 
It would be nice to get Konqueror running the test suite, but there is something (probably simple) that was blocking my earlier attempts to run JsUnit. 
-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- Hash: SHA1 Yes it's still on my TODO list to try with saxon instead of xalan ... But note that the complexity of the build process for the test suite doesn't really help. 
I have to spend much time debugging Java problems (which I don't know much about), when all I want to do is test the Javascript in Konqueror. 
Why not make the generated tests available somewhere? 
It would be of much help if someone could send me a 'built' tarball, with all the tests ready to run. 
I'm also waiting for input from the JSUnit developers, I have reported problems to them (including a testcase of what JSUnit relies on, which doesn't seem to work in any browser? 
Strange). 
Does anyone know when exactly the onload event for iframes is supposed to be emitted? 
In the testcase below, some browsers (Mozilla IIRC) don't emit it at all, some others (IE, IIRC) emit it only during the initial loading of the page... but JSUnit relies on it being emitted when load() is called (i.e. when the iframe loads some new contents). 
function load(uri) window.frames.documentBuffer.document.location.href 
= uri; function loadComplete() alert("loadComplete"); David FAURE, david@mandrakesoft.com,

Rick Rivello David, The only downloadable version of the DOM TS for Level 1 is the one on the main DOM TS page which we released a while ago. 
It could be of help as the tests are basically the same; however, you'd need to change the JsUnit version to see if it runs in Konqueror. 
Later during the day I'll diug throuhg the archives to find latest activities and bottlenecks and will ask that people submit their issues either to the list or the issue tracker (which is preferrable) so that we all can have a fairly goodpicture of where we stand (I've has some problems to give a fair report to the DOM WG as not all issues have been reported to this list, for example.) /Dimitris
