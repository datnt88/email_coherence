Hum, anyone who thinks that Netscape 6 is html 4.x complient is not doing good web development work. 
I not only do html 4, but a load of web programming, as well, and I know, for a fact, that Netscape 6 does not support html 4.x properly. 
Dan I hope he has registered the problems with Bugzilla. 
I wonder though if he is confusing rendering behaviour with what is actually specified in HTML 4. I can't imagine there is much scope for Netcape to get HTML 4 wrong. 
I know it still gets bits of CSS wrong (I have uncleared Bugzilla reports on its handling of z-order), but most sites break because of Document Object Model issues. 
Who is this? 
Are his views worth any more than his vague references to "html 4.x complient[sic]" or "good web development work"? 
Is there any reason to suppose this was anyone other than a clueless deezyner who thinks it should look exactly the same as it does in frontpage? 
That would require the problems to be formulated. 
If he can formulate them for Bugzilla, then presumably he can also do so in whatever forum this post appeared. 
In short, why the **** was that post forwarded to this list?

All of my sites are XHTML 1.0 Transitional, and everything displays fine. 
Can we be more specific in regards to how NN 6 is /not compliant/? 
Randal I forwarded it to the list because I wanted to take back something from this list which I did take back. 
We are not to cross post so I felt it best to do this. 
I have also encouraged people to look at the other posts on this topic in the archives and to join wai ig if their attitudes are right.
