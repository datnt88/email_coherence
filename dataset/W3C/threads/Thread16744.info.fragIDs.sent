Hi. I'm still on my quest for 'free to developers' alternative browsers. 
(or at least free for a trial period) I loaded Jaws and got it to work, and it 
seemed very nice, and reliable, but I have nothing to compare it to and I'm sure there are other browsers out there. 
I have heard about 'eyeball browsers' (at least that's what a Human Factors engineer called them) where the movement of the eye is detected. 
Has anyone heard about these and/or know about developing for them? 
What other browser types are there, besides, voice synthesizer types (like Jaws), Mainstream (like IE), and the eyeball browsers? 
Also, I'm job hunting, where would I find job listings for web developers with an interest in creating accessible sites? 
Thanks for your help, Suzanne www.suzroot.com

Suzanne, This is not meant as a criticism but rather an explanation. 
JAWS is not a browser. 
It is a screen reader and is in fact one software package of several in the category. 
I point this out because the results you obtain with JAWS or another screen reader or any accessibility software for that matter will depend heavily on which browser you are using in conjunction with the accessibility software. 
Most assistive technology is tuned to work with Internet Explorer at this point and time. 
Some other screen readers to be aware of (this is not comprehensive) are Window-Eyes http://www.gw-micro.com 
, Window Bridge http://www.synthavoice.com and a couple different options detailed at http://www.humanware.com . 
The best resource to learn about screen enlargement products is at http://www.magnifiers.org . 
There are also dedicated talking web browsers like IBM's Home Page Reader. 
Details on this are at http://www.ibm.com/able/hpr . 
I believe that the WAI pages also list alternative browsers, although I don't have the specific URL in front of me.

Hi Suzanne not sure where to look for a job. 
But for more info on browsers you might like to look at "Alternative Web BRowsing" at - there is a demonstration version of EIAD now available.) 
As well as browsers, there are systems that people use for their whole computer. 
Eyeball tracking is one of those (others include all kinds of input devices - speech, specialised keyboards of different types, etc. 
Some of this stuff can be done in software, and there are free versions of some of it (for example, I use a half-keyboard on my macintosh that is a free product, and a talking keyboard that is too. 
I got them via a download site called tucows - http://www.tucows.com where accessibility things are listed as a category of educational software - go figure.

Not only is the IBM Home Page Reader free 30 day trial available [1], there are pages [2] that explain how a sighted web developer can use it to design accessible pages.
