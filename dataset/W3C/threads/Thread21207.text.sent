the following short test program shows that Amaya doesn't display title attributes while all other browsers tested show them as tooltip like popup boxes. 
These can be extremely useful to page readers as longer explanations can be offered as to where a hotlink may take them or perhaps a definition of a rarely used word or term. 
Consistency between ways browsers render attributes and properties help both the author and the reader as one can't enforce tools other uses.

All we can do for the moment is to display the title attribute with the href attribute in the status bar when one click on a link. 
Regards, Laurent ok -- as long as this is on wish list! 
i realize that there are many priorities and this may be one that is low compared to others... i use the title attribute as a redundancy for javascript tooltips but javascript also fails ;-] thanks for responding.

I would prefer that approach if it is easy to do - it is what iCab and Safari do, and I find it much less intrusive than tooltips, at the same time being helpful. 
Cheers Chaals Post: 21 Mitchell street, FOOTSCRAY Vic 3011, Australia or W3C, 2004 Route des Lucioles, 06902 Sophia Antipolis Cedex, France The attribute 'title' of a selected anchor is now displayed in the status bar with the uri of the anchor (CVS version). 
Regards, Laurent what happens if the title attribute is associated with other elements say a heading tag or in my case is use it with a span tag to mark a word needing definition in context .... does clicking on that elements contents reveal the message ??? title attribute has many uses ;-] ;-] Date forwarded: Wed, 16 Jul 2003 11:46:52 -0400 (EDT) Copies to: www-amaya@w3.org
