Hi folks-- I've been working on the next rev, V2.1, of the XMLspec DTD. 
It's just a point release, so there are no backwards-incompatible changes from a syntax perspective. 
However, if you maintain any stylesheets supporting it, you'll want to know about these changes because some of them may invalidate parts of your processing and require fixes. 
I'd like to get this release out as soon as possible, but if you have an important change request that you don't see here, let me know THIS WEEK and I'll try to get it in. 
(I can always do a V2.2 later.) Here's the list of changes: #- Added proto and arg elements. 
This supports not only the core XPath functions, but also the XPointer extensions. 
#- Added function, var, sub, sup, and phrase. 
The var element (variable text, like "for some node _x_" has been a request for years now. 
The sub and sup elements were added at the request of the MathML folks. 
The phrase element is to serve as an "attribute hanger" when no other inline element will do. 
#- Allowed status and abstract to appear in the opposite order. 
This was a longstanding bug; the DTD only allowed them in the status/abstract order, but in fact the W3C publication guidelines require them in the other order. 
I will remove the incorrect order in the next major version (V3.0). 
#- Updated XLink usage to latest WD, except for the href and source attributes. 
Because XLink now only has global attributes and not elements in its namespace, the "naked" href attribute and the wrongly named source attribute used by XMLspec are not in compliance. 
I will fix this in the next major version (V3.0), but this will cause maintainers of legacy documents some pain. 
(I'll endeavor to distribute an XSLT stylesheet that will update legacy documents as necessary.) #- Removed the xml:attributes attribute from graphic. 
This is no longer required/allowed by XLink. 
This was a "hidden" fixed attribute. 
#- Added common diff attribute. 
This attribute is to help you record changes directly in the XML source. 
(Let me know if you need more details offline, or you can wait for the official V2.1 documentation.) #- Added div5 element. 
This was a request from the MathML folks. 
#- Broadened content models of publoc, prevlocs, and latestloc. 
These used to be loc+, and were too restrictive for specs such as XML Schemas Part 1. 
I look forward to getting your feedback.

Isn't this a sytelsheet issue? 
;-) Eduardo Well, yes. 
:-) But it's been an assumption so far that the input order of the header is also the output order, so this is misleading at the very least.
