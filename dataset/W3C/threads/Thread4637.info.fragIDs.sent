<s> But Michael, this makes no sense.  </s>
<s> When would overloading by arity ever produce a result inconsistent with overloading by type?  </s>
<s> Overloading by type always starts with the premise that the two functions have the same name and same number of arguments -- and then looks to the types of the arguments to distinguish which function is invoked.  </s>
<s> Therefore, by definition, overloading by arity is forwards-compatible with overloading by type.  </s>
<s> Note also that you?ve already defined overloading by arity for functions in the built-in function namespace.  </s>
<s> Therefore, any future overloading rules must be compatible with overloading by arity, or else you just create an inconsistent mess for implementers in which the built-in functions use a different set of overloading rules than other functions.  </s>
<s> (Oh wait, you?re already there.) Based on technical merits alone, there?s simply no reason to exclude overloading user-defined functions by arity in this version of XQuery.  </s>
<s> There are, however, plenty of other kinds of reasons (time-to-market, inertia, personal preference, inability to achieve consensus, etc.).  </s>

<s> Given two functions declare function f($x as X, $y as Y) {...}; declare function f($x as X) { ... }; and two function calls f(1,2) f(1) I don't see how we could ever come up with any different resolution of these function calls than binding the first call to the first declaration and the second to the second.  </s>
