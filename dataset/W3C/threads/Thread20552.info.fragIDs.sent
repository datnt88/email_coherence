I opened README.cvs from the CVS repository. 
Amaya considers this a text file since it does not have htm or html as an extension. 
Amaya should use another method for determining file types. 
Another alternative, probably the preferred method, is to have an Open As... menu so I can say whether to open it as text or HTML.

No! The best is to have an OS which allocates types to files irrespective of what they might be named - and yes, there is one - I use it over 99% of my time - it's called RISCOS and runs on an ARM processor! 
Unashamed plug!

Hmmm. MacOS does this too. 
But I think it is still valuable for Amaya users (and users of any editor) to be able to override the default type of a document and force it to be opened as something else. 
(The lack of this feature is my biggest complaint about most editors I use) cheers Charles
