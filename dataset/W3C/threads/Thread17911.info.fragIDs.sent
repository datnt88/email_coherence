<s> The working group discussed the minimum requirements for Checkpoint 10.4 Allow the user to change the input configuration.  </s>
<s> [Priority 2].  </s>
<s> After reviewing the techniques document the minimum requirements seemed to be already covered in other checkpoints, notably 10.5, 10.7, 10.9 and 5.8.  </s>
<s> Is there anything that is not in these other checkpoints that could be used as the minimum requirement for conforming to 10.4?  </s>
<s> If not then I think we should delete the checkpoint.  </s>

<s> I object. 1) 10.5 talks about single-key access, not general configuration.  </s>
<s> 2) 10.7 talks about saving configurations persistently 3) 10.9 talks about graphical UI configuration 4) 5.8 talks about following conventions While 10.5 comes closest to ensuring configurability of the keyboard, it is specifically for single-key access.  </s>
<s> Therefore, while I haven't participated in the discussions on this topic since I'm on the road, I don't agree that the requirement of 10.4 is covered in other checkpoints.  </s>

<s> Ian, Can you give an example of any other input configuration that is useful for accessibility except changing single command access?  </s>
<s> 1.  </s>
<s> We already have a requirement that all functions be accessible through the keyboard (1.3) 2. We say to use system conventions (5.8) 3. Allow single key or command configuration (10.5) 4. Configuration of graphical controls (10.9) 5. Saving custom and restoring default configuration information (including keyboard bindings) are in checkpoint 10.7 What additional functionality does checkpoint 10.4 add that can be put in a minimal requirement for satisfying the checkpoint?  </s>
<s> We need just one requirement of a minimal specification to satisfy the checkpoint that is not covered somewhere else.  </s>
<s> NOTE: I would modify the minimum requirement of 10.5 to include either single key or modifier + single key for configuration of systems with keyboards.  </s>
<s> This would generalize 10.5, but still provide the single key functionality for those that want just a single key.  </s>
