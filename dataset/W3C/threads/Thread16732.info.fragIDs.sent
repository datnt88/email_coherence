<s> Great Kynn,  </s>
<s> You asked whether or not this is an "ideal usage" of the NOSCRIPT element.  </s>
<s> My question was whether there were real life "effective" uses.  </s>
<s> I really didn't expect any, and good for you for finding a "real life" use  </s>
<s> of NOSCRIPT.  </s>
<s> This one at http://www.section508.gov, of all places, is certainly real life and it is effective.  </s>
<s> What it does is provide text at the  </s>
<s> top of the page that in effect says "we use JavaScript for XYZ and since you  </s>
<s> don't support JavaScript you are out of lunch as regards XYZ."  </s>
<s> I really think that is kind of an ingenious idea.  </s>
<s> "We're using JavaScript  </s>
<s> and you don't get the benefit of it, so TOUGH!"  </s>
<s> I guess I would say the instance is certainly not ideal.  </s>
<s> The prescription  </s>
<s> for NOSCRIPT is that authors will provide alternate content when scripting  </s>
<s> is not available.  </s>
<s> This example does not do that because I read "alternate"  </s>
<s> do be in some sense equivalent.  </s>

<s> It's not absolutely inaccessible, but it is certainly, in my view, a hindrance to accessiblity and given that most of the home page seems to be given over to this lawyer's notice, and given its prominent position (certainly not natural linearised reading order) may well stop some people in their tracks, thinking it is yet another "please upgrade" web site; I certainly got that sort of reaction the first time I accessed the site in IE with Javascript off.  </s>

<s> There is not a requirement to provide information -in an acceptable context-, at least, not in the section 508 regs and not, I don't think, explicitly in WCAG 1.0 either.  </s>
<s> Is this acceptable?  </s>
<s> Well, it depends on how you are looking at the problem.  </s>
<s> If you look at it as "how can I use exit pop-ups and still meet Section 508 (or WCAG)", then I think it "passes".  </s>
<s> If you look at it in terms of providing equal access to information, it barely passes.  </s>
<s> If you look at it in terms of providing an optimal user interface for each user (the goal of edaptation), then this fails, because the user experience for a user without access to scripts is demonstrably "weaker" than that of a user with access to scripts.  </s>
<s> So, it meets the "letter of the law" but to my mind it fails to perform acceptably.  </s>
<s> This is why I have always explained to people that my company's goal is not simply _making information accessible_, which you can do relatively easily, but rather about _providing an ideal user experience_ which goes beyond mere access to information and incorporates usability and UI design.  </s>

<s> TAKE CONTROL.  </s>
<s> It's probably not that useful for people with a primary concern for accessibility, but it does allow accessibility features to be completely hidden from those people who do have scripting on, which may mean that they get past marketing department concerns that they spoil the look of the page.  </s>
<s> Unfortunately, they also hide them from other maintainers of the page, and if used in this way, may well be introduced by a member of the team who has a personal interest in accessibility, rather than as policy, so may decay rapidly once maintenance shifts to another person.  </s>
