<s> I believe that the approach outlined in this section is very dangerous and can easily lead to queries being accidentally or maliciously altered.  </s>
<s> It is unfortunate that XQuery misuses XML syntax for a non XML language (previous comments to this list on XML Query have suggested that it does not do that, but I assume now that the current syntax is fixed) However this means that great care needs to be taken when inserting XML Query fragments into XML documents.  </s>
<s> Even in this small section, three different embeddings are suggested, and no indication is given in the embedding syntax about which embedding has been used.  </s>
<s> Most problematic are situations where extracting the query using the wrong embedding produce a valid, but different, Xquery from the one intended.  </s>
<s> For example the second embedding shown Could (if the XML parser used, reports CDATA sections) be extracted using the embedding used for the first example.  </s>
<s> the result would be that instead of getting an Xquery FOR expression, you get an Xquery CDATA constructor, this is a perfectly valid Xquery expression.  </s>
<s> Of course one might to be expected to use common sense to distinguish the cases, but machines are not too good at common sense, and in harder cases it would be harder to guess.  </s>
<s> Similar things occur with  </s>
<s> If you put that "trivial" embedding through an XML parser which reports  </s>
<s> that the content of the XQuery element is ("abc","xyz") then I don't see how you could reliably decide whether the original expression was a sequence of one or two strings.  </s>
<s> Other problems exist with things such as Xquery Comment constructors if these are embedded using the first scheme (ie just literally included) then whether or not the extracted query contains a comment constructor will depend on whether the XML parser used reports comments.  </s>
<s> My preferred solution would be to modify the Xquery syntax so that the first suggested embedding is always legal and safe, this means essentially not using unescaped , modifying the rules for the timing of the expansion of character references, and using a different syntax for comment and pi constructors (as in xslt) however failing that: section 5 should be dropped or replaced by a much more fully spec'd proposal that would allow Xqueries to be unambiguously and safely embedded in XML documents.  </s>

<s> Although interesting, none of your comments are specific to XQuery.  </s>
<s> For example, consider embedding this text in an XML document: If you don't escape it first (and unescape it when parsing), then it would be interpreted as structure instead of text.  </s>
<s> If the parser interprets the processing instruction to mean something, then you've achieved XML injection.  </s>
<s> Now consider embedding the XPath " foo/ &amp;amp; ?foo? " into the text of an XML document as you show below.  </s>
<s> The XPath is just a literal string, but the  </s>
<s> XML parser would treat this as a quote character, followed by an element, an entity, a p-i, and a quote character.  </s>
<s> So these problems already exist for XPath, without even resorting to full-blown XQuery.  </s>
<s> Therefore, they can't be avoided, without removing XPath  </s>
<s> from XQuery.  </s>
<s> Also, embedding XQuery queries by wrapping them with CDATA sections clearly  </s>
<s> doesn't work when a query contains the sequence ]] (in a string, a comment,  </s>
<s> as the terminator of a CDATA section, etc.).  </s>
<s> Although the embedding could work around this by splitting into separate CDATA sections at each occurrence of ]] , I have yet to see an XML application that uses CDATA in this way account for this (and I can name several break when you embed ]] ).  </s>
<s> Just my $0.02, michael  </s>
<s> I believe that they are as there is a suggestion that the bits of Xquery that _look_ like XML can be inlined into the XML as XML (in particular an XML query heavy with literal element constructors might be inlined as an element tree).  </s>
<s> If you put a string which is xpath or tex or sgml or anything else into xml then yes you have to quote things according to xml rules but you just unquote them on the way back and you know where you are.  </s>
<s> It is the suggestion that sometimes you need to do that and sometimes you don't that makes this problematic.  </s>
<s> You can't put the sequence ]] in an XML file anyway it's not just that  </s>
<s> you can't wrap a CDATA section around it, that sequence isn't legal anywhere (except ending a cdata section.  </s>
<s> An embedding of xquery into XML that is safe and reversible is replace each of  &amp; and  by  &amp;amp;  place resulting string in XML element.  </s>
<s> Extract element content (not its linearisation) and parse as Xquery.  </s>
<s> That is essentially what you do for Xpath anyway.  </s>
<s> The danger is the suggestion that unless there are  being used as  (rather than element  </s>
<s> constructors) the Xquery can be directly placed in the XML.  </s>

<s> The people who find this similarity pernicious ("they're so close!") must be the same people who try in vain to reuse existing XPath 1.0 and XML 1.0 parsers to implement their XQuery compilers, even though the languages are different already at the lexical level, because XQuery superficially seems to contain XML and XPath as subsets (even though it doesn't, not really).  </s>

<s> It's the same as thinking the operator + behaves the same in every language that uses it, just because they all happen to use the same syntax for it.  </s>
<s> XQuery places different rules on its element constructors (including things like implicit validation) than XML does, and you'd lose those rules if you tried to treat the XQuery as literal XML verbatim.  </s>
