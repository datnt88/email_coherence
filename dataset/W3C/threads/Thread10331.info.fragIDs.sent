<s> Pat, How is the response to this coming along?  </s>

<s> Sorry this got lost.  </s>
<s> Draft response follows: Dear Qu In you made a comment which was subsequently clarified in and archived as a formal comment Qu-03: We have been treating this issue as similar to the one raised by Jeff Pan, archived as pan-01: since they both requested that RDF be described in terms of a layered sublanguage.  </s>
<s> After discussion, the WG has resolved that to attempt to define such a proper sub-language is beyond our charter and our timescale.  </s>
<s> However, we have resolved that this issue should be classified as postponed, meaning that it will be on the agenda of any WG which considers RDF in the future.  </s>
<s> This recognizes that the issue needs to be addressed eventually.  </s>
<s> Please let us know if this response is acceptable, CCing www-rdf-comments@w3.org.  </s>
<s> Thanks.  </s>
