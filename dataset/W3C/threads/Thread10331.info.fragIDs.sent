Pat, How is the response to this coming along? 
Brian 
Sorry this got lost. 
Draft response follows: Dear Qu In you made a comment which was subsequently clarified in and archived as a formal comment Qu-03: We have been treating this issue as similar to the one raised by Jeff Pan, archived as pan-01: since they both requested that RDF be described in terms of a layered sublanguage. 
After discussion, the WG has resolved that to attempt to define such a proper sub-language is beyond our charter and our timescale. 
However, we have resolved that this issue should be classified as postponed, meaning that it will be on the agenda of any WG which considers RDF in the future. 
This recognizes that the issue needs to be addressed eventually. 
Please let us know if this response is acceptable, CCing www-rdf-comments@w3.org. 
Thanks.
