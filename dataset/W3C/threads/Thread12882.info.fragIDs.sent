Hello all, On remark on the WAI overview slides located at: In slide 2, "Some Tips for Using these Slides", we could tell the user that shortcuts to the main links are available. 
For example: "? Use the right-arrow button ("On to..." link), or press alt+n to go to the next page." 
In the slide about EO work, is the order the deliverables are listed deliberate, or does it have a logical order? 
Regards Sylvie 
Good idea, I thought we did that, but it's not there. 
No, as we discussed in the EOWG meetings recently, unless someone can propose a good order, it gets left like this. 
I tried re-arranging them 
some &amp; it's not obvious what would be better. 
You're welcome to propose a way.

Judy and all, On slide 21 "Conducting Education and Outreach": Brewer a ?crit 
: 
listed deliberate, or does it have a logical order? 
SD: I would either propose : - first list ressources, then strategies. 
That could be : how people with disabilities use the Web, Quick tips, curriculum, FAQ, how to evaluate web sites, alternative browsers, policy reference links, implementation planning, developing organizational policies, selecting and using authoring tools, and other deliverables. 
- or we could sort them according to the document status: first those that are finished, then those that will be finished in the first quarter, second quarter... Then those which will be redrafted. 
What do you think?

Sylvie and list As far as I can see we only have to move How people with.... up before Implementation planning... to list resources before strategies, and I'm not sure if this makes it better. 
I noticed 2 incorrect links on the slide: How to evaluate... links to events and How people... links to Developing organizational policies.... Helle Kind regards Helle Bjarno Visual Impairment Knowledge Centre e-mail: hbj@visinfo.dk
