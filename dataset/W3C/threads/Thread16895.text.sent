A mere 28 days late, here is my reportage of Bill Gates' receipt of the Louis Braille Award for contributions to blind people. 
Really, the Microsoft Accessibility group should have accepted the award (Gary Moulton, come on down!), but that's not how these things work. 
*Who* would have thought that a 10-year-old could upstage the richest man in the world?

Accessibility articles, resources, and critiques: Hello everyone, I know this has been brought up before but I need some debate. 
There is an intranet site that I'm dealing with and .pdf 
files are used throughout. 
Paragraph (m) of section 508 asks that a link to that plug-in be used. 
Developers are complaining that the plug-in comes is installed on every machine in the organization and the company prohibits downloading from the internet. 
My question is whether the plug-in link is necessary on intranet sites when it should already be installed? 
Thanks J Hi Everyone, Sorry for the cross posting. 
I know that audio descriptions are required for multimedia and videos under standard (1194.24) 
(d) "All training and informational video and multimedia productions that support the agency's mission, regardless of format, that contain visual information necessary for the comprehension of the content, shall be audio described." 
Does this provision also hold true for video's that run in a web page or cd rom in software such as media player, quick time, etc.? Thanks in advance. 
Scott From our understanding (and authoring - we sat on the Access Board's EITAAC), we always expected that those uses are exactly what that provision was written for - so the answer to your question is yes.

I haven't been able to use any DVDs easily (but this isn't many) because you I have been presented with an on screen menu that I can read. 
An audible description would enable me to work out what's going on. 
Then all I need to do is work out how to select the appropriate option!!!! 
I have had discussion with others regarding DVD accessiblity and there does seem to be a lack of any standard approach. 
Some are good, some are bad and generally the players themselves are inadaquate. 
(I know this isn't strickly web related so apologies in advance for any stress this may cause anyone.) Cheers Ian 508@access-board.gov;

Ian, There aren't many, but a few DVDs do have what we refer to as "audio navigation". 
Abraham and Mary Lincoln: A House Divided, Marcus Garvey: Look for Me in the Whirlwind, and The Grinch are three that have this.

Hi Ian, The Toy Story dvd also has audio descriptions. 
Scott If produced by and/or for the federal government, its employees and/or the general public, DVDs would be covered as well. 
There are a few examples of DVDs with video description (as well as closed captions) on the marketplace and a few with talking menus: from PBS Video - "Abraham and Mary Lincoln: A House Divided," "Marcus Garvey: Look for Me in the Whirlwind," and from Universal, "How the Grinch Stole Christmas (Jim Carrey version). 
More are coming. 
The access features were produced by WGBH's National Center for Accessible Media.
