<s> Tantek, you may recall discussion of XFN and GRDDL... Re: XFN on the GRDDL [was: Profiles attribute...] Tantek ?elik  </s>
<s> (Saturday, 17 January) Since then I have been thinking about enhancing GRDDL so that XFN docs would work with GRDDL as-is, once the XFN profile has been modified to point to a grokXFN.xsl  </s>
<s> transformation.  </s>
<s> I got around to implementing the idea this week.  </s>
<s> If I run: $ python glean.py  </s>
<s> ,f.rdf http://www.w3.org/2003/g/td/friends (i.e. http://www.w3.org/2003/g/glean.py)  </s>
<s> I get some RDF that says I xfn:met you.  </s>
<s> That friends doc doesn't point to the real XFN profile, but rather to a GRDDL-enhanced work-alike: What do you think about changing the real XFN profile likewise, Tantek?  </s>
<s> EricM, you and I discussed the same sort of thing for the dublin core profile Do you think you could get that profile changed?  </s>
<s> I haven't yet updated the GRDDL spec and profile doc yet, but I intend to presently, especially if I get some positive feedback.  </s>

<s> Bravo! Very nice indeed.  </s>
<s> The only thing that concerns me, I assume it's come up before - how does one deal with multiple profiles, where the order in which the XSLT is applied makes a difference?  </s>
<s> (I suspect this could be generally avoided  </s>
<s> unless there was a naming clash, but I'm not sure).  </s>
<s> Cheers, Danny.  </s>

<s> /me takes a bow.  </s>
<s> The order can't make any difference.  </s>
<s> If the transformations linked from a document d are x1, x2, and x3, the result is just x1(doc) + x2(doc) + x3(doc) where + denotes RDF graph merging, which is associative and commutative.  </s>
<s> It's not x1(x2(x3(doc))) or anything like that.  </s>
<s> Dan Connolly, W3C http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/  </s>
<s> No problemo then.  </s>
<s> Great!  </s>
