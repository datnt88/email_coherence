<s> Dear All, Would it be a good idea to create a template for a Web Accessibility Evaluation Report which captures (in a generic format) the procedures used, and results collected, from the tests suggested in the 'Evaluating Websites for Accessibility' document (http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/impl/eval/Overview.html).  </s>
<s> Effectively, in a similar manner to the 'Common Industry Format for Usability Test Reports' (http://zing.ncsl.nist.gov/iusr/documents/cifv1.1b.htm) used for Usability testing (listed in the Evaluation &amp; Repair section under Related Resources)?  </s>
<s> As I see it two clear reasons exist for standardisation, firstly, it allows anyone undertaking 'repair' work to pick-up, and easily work with, any evaluation report coming from any Evaluation Centre, and secondly, it introduces an element of Quality Assurance.  </s>

<s> Hi, yes, it seems like a good idea.  </s>
<s> Such a good idea that groups in the WAI technical activity have been working on it grin/ .  </s>
<s> The Evaluation and Repair Tools group have been hosting the work on EARL (the Evaluation and Report Language) since early last year.  </s>
<s> The idea is that tools produce information in a format that can then be used to identify who made a given assessment, of what, when, and that the results can be used by other tools to facilitate repair.  </s>
<s> It is also possible to turn EARL into a human-readable format for people doing manual repair.  </s>
<s> Tools that produce or use EARL currently include Page Valet (an automatic testing tool, that produces it and can use it to provide a view of the page source annotated with the problems identified), MUTAT (a generic interview-type tool for testing, which produces it), the AccVerify / AccMonitor / AccRepair suite of tools (which produce it and use it to generate reports of various kinds, as well as identify problems for the repair tools that are part of the suite), a query tool from the University of Bristol that can merge various EARL reports, and SSB's inSight / inFocus tools (I don't know much about their implementation).  </s>
<s> There is an out-of-date home page for EARL - http://www.w3.org/2001/03/earl and some more up to date information and links from the ERT working group page http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/#earl cheers Chaals Dear All, Would it be a good idea to create a template for a Web Accessibility Evaluation Report which captures (in a generic format) the procedures used, and results collected, from the tests suggested in the 'Evaluating Websites for Accessibility' document (http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/impl/eval/Overview.html).  </s>

<s> Dear All, Thank you for your full response, I have read again with interest that it is possible to turn Earl into human-readable formats for people doing manual repair.  </s>
<s> Could I ask if any human-readable report templates have been created so far, and if they have if I could be sent the URLs?  </s>
<s> If they have not would it be a good idea to create a standard interrim (non-EARL) template for a human-readable Web Accessibility Evaluation Report?  </s>
<s> I only ask because in would make sense for evaluators to start producing evaluation reports based on future standardised formats.  </s>
<s> Thanks again... Alistair Garrison Managing Director Accessinmind Limited www.accessinmind.com  </s>
<s> Alistair - I'm glad you raised this issue again.  </s>
<s> For reference, please visit the thread from about a year ago: Regarding passing URLs to tools, maybe one of these days I'll get a chance to revisit the tools front-end I had developed a couple of years ago.  </s>
<s> It's kind of interesting to see how much has changed since then.  </s>
<s> It's still available at the following URL: I still get occasional e-mails about the W3 logos links I had as part of that site.  </s>
<s> This page provides links via several search engines to identify pages that are linking to the W3 logo pages.  </s>
<s> Either these pages are claiming compliance at the corresponding level, or they are raising awareness by pointing to the WAI logo pages -- Note: Google, AltaVista, and HotBot still actually work!):  </s>
