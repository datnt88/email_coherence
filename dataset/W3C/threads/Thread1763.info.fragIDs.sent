<s> Hi, suppose I have two workspaces A and B. Both of them are under baseline-control.  </s>

<s> Now I want to do an update of the consolidation refering to a newer baseline of A. How could this be done?  </s>
<s> First I would use the compare-baseline report to get a diff of the baseline A used for creation of B and the newer baseline of A. (Could I compare a baseline of workspace B with a baseline of A [well, of course comparing baselines of the version-controlled configurations of B and A]).  </s>
<s> But how do I get the changes "merged" into workspace B? Is this in scope of DeltaV?  </s>

<s> To merge a baseline into a workspace, you use the MERGE request, i.e. MERGE /ws/B Cheers, Geoff Hi, suppose I have two workspaces A and B. Both of them are under baseline-control.  </s>

<s> o.k. so far, but take a look at some details: common base: suppose I have two workspaces A and B. Both of them are under baseline-control (with auto-version).  </s>

<s> Now there is a MERGE.  </s>
<s> /repo/bl/1573 is the new baseline of A MERGE /ws/B so merge takes version V-A2 (merge source) and merges it to VCR b (merge target) because V-A2 is a descendant of checked-in version V1 of VCR b a auto-merge could be done setting checked-in version of VCR b to V-A2.  </s>

<s> Works as I expect it to do.) Yes.  </s>
<s> We don't use the term "auto-merge" here though, since we've been using auto-merge to mean "neither version is a descendent of the other, and the server has automatically done a merge into the checked out target, that is to be reviewed by the client" (i.e. your case 3 below, except that the server is being helpful).  </s>

<s> I'd rather the server would fail this here to let the user take the decision what version to keep for VCR b.) The semantics are the one need, although there is no failure.  </s>
<s> The merge target is a descendent of the merge source, which by the semantics of line of descent, means that result of the merge leaves the target unchanged.  </s>

<s> The request doesn't "fail", it succeeds, but VCR b is left checked-out, with a DAV:merge-set identifying version V-A2 (or if the server is auto-merging, in the DAV:auto-merge-set).  </s>
<s> The client must merge the content of V-A2 into VCR b (or confirm that the server has correctly auto-merged the contents of V-A2 into VCR b), and move the reference to V-A2 from the DAV:merge-set to the DAV:predecessor-set of VCR b, before it can check in VCR b. Cheers, Geoff  </s>
