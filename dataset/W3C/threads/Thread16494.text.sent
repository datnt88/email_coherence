If one has an image on a website, that for example is linked to a download of Adobe's Acrobat? 
Reader and image is the official Adobe Acrobat? 
Logo emblazoned with the words "Adobe - Get Acrobat Reader" then what is the best alt text? 
Should it describe the graphic and the link that it goes to? 
Or just the graphic? 
JAWS, when encoutering a linked graphic, will say: link, graphic, and then read the alt text. 
Typically the alt text on a web site describes the image itself and not the link. 
Most of the guidance I've read indicates that image alt text should describe only the image. 
Does doing so leave the blind user clueless about navigation? 
After all, the sighted user can mouse over the image and see the url of the link and choose whether to follow it or not based on that additional info. 
Any guidance here?

Hi, One technique that seems to be of interest to some is the use of what are called "bread crumbs" on sites to assist users in tracking where they have been and where they are going, more easily within the site. 
One site wants to implement this using the title tag but the info in the title tag is not spoken while tabbing. 
Are there any thoughts about: 1 "bread crumbs as a useful site navigation tool?" 2 how best to implement them for best access? 
3 Any alternatives if more useful to achieve the same or a similar purpose? 
I do not have an url but there are labels such as sub section, level 1, level 2, and so on with a nink name for each level. 
It does not seem to me that this is useful for persons with screen readers but might it help others and if it can be useful for us, how can it be made comprehensible? 
Thanks!

it should replace what is an alternative for with the same functionality in text in this case.

While David is correct I think this may be a special case as I recall Adobe asking for a certain alt tag in their license.

Joy, Most users prefer to know what the link is doing or where the link is going. 
Having a link that describes the image doesn't help them in terms of understanding what is going to happen when the link is activated. 
Window-Eyes users can read the status line to get the URL while the link/image is focused (assuming JavaScript isn't changing the status line), so that's a work-around. 
But the ALT tag should describe the action.

Technical Support &amp; Web Development I believe that the important information to convey is the function of the link. 
Whatever Adobe's logo happens to be in this case isn't nearly as important as what the link will accomplish for me if I follow it. 
I don't know that it is a hard and fast rule but more often than not I've found that emphasizing the function of the image as opposed to a full description for alt text is what works best. 
Jamie, I double-checked, and our license agreement doesn't contain any mention of alt tags. 
Authors should attach whatever Alt tag is most effective, and I certainly agree with the advice that has been given on this list.
