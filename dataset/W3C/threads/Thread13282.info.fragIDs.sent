<s> The 2 common methods are the 'D' link and the image-anchor method (the image is an anchor that links to the longdesc file).  </s>

<s> Thanks for your comments, Chris  </s>
<s> W3C specs have used d-links.  </s>
<s> I think the anchor is generally a capital D. So that's how I do it (as well as adding a longdesfc for that hoped-for day ;-) cheers Charles  </s>

<s> This is of course a wcag issue, but my personal opinion is to use the D link, since images are often links themselves already, so the convention wouldn't apply in those cases.  </s>
<s> Also, the user might click on the image thinking it was a link to something more substantial when they otherwise would have preferred to skip it.  </s>
<s> As for D vs. d vs. [D] I'd want to hear from speech users on that one.  </s>
<s> From a visual perspective, a plain D I think would get the fewest complaints about messing up the look of the page.  </s>
