As discussed in our last call, we're going to create some "case law", i.e. some examples where we can come to a consensus on acceptability. 
Per my action item, I've posted three examples at. 
We can discuss this in the context of WCAG 1.0 or 2.0. 
They represent the "return policy" of a hypothetical web site. 
All use special fonts or effects. 
In example 1, All loops are colored yellow. 
For example, the inside of the loop at the top of the letter P is colored yellow. 
This effect cannot be produced by CSS or other currently available technology. 
Is it therefore acceptable to present this text as an image? 
In example 2, the dots of the i's are two pixels wide instead of one pixel wide (the default for Times Roman). 
This effect cannot be produced by CSS or other currently available technology. 
Is it therefore acceptable to present this text as an image? 
In example 3, the area of text appears to bulge up, three dimensionally, from the center. 
Acceptable? 
These are extreme examples, but I'm not trying to be flippant: I'm trying 
to get examples that cut to any differences of opinion we may have. 
If this discussion belongs in the compliance discussion we can of course postpone it till then. 
Len p.s. To give a hint of my own opinion: the acceptability of example three depends on its purpose... as I've tried to argue in general... but so far to no avail... Leonard R. Kasday, Ph.D. Institute on Disabilities/UAP and Dept. of Electrical Engineering at Temple

If the effects cannot be produced using CSS, but are desired anyway, then clearly they -will- be used. 
The question then becomes "how can they be rendered accessible" not "should these be forbidden" (since that won't work anyway). 
As to how to make these accessible, that does depend on the use and also on whatever other options are available. 
For example, this problem is so trivially and painlessly solved using something akin to the Edapta architecture, providing scalable text to users with those needs, and non-scalable text to users who have not expressed a need for those.

As a hearing officer of a federal agency who must decide these matters, I would rule that none of them would qualify. 
If they were to have the entire text as alt text (which is probably not allowed due to length) someone might appeal my decision and who knows what the appeals process would yield. 
If the "defendant" of the third one said she needed to use that effect because it reminds her clients not to opt for balloon payments or whatever, I'd still rule against her. 
If I were a member of a Working Group discussing whether these items were acceptable as "image text" I would also rule against them. 
That doesn't mean that some other example might not get my approval. 
We live in a "real" world wherein the examples that might be raised are infinite in number. 
On the whole, text image gives a "bad image" to the underlying notion of accessibility and is also a knock on ingenuity. 
If the author of these had used the "last resort" of an alternative presentation then I guess these images would just be like pictures of anything else. 
If the material is available *readily* (whatever that means) then who am I to whine. 
In that case I would suppose the attribute for the image file would be alt="graphical presentation of the text found on our alternative site" Love. 
ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE 
Nice examples. 
Here is my 10c worth. 
I was looking at two things, 1- is the primary use of the text " graphical" and 2, Was it true semantic content. 
For the first three examples it has to be no and yes, in other words, there is no way that tat much text can have a primarily non graphical purpose, or no be true important content. 
With the fourth example, it depend on the rest of the page. 
If it is followed by normal, header text that said "return", then its primary function becomes graphical and it is not truly important in terms of content. 
then it would be OK. 
If however it is a heading by itself, without redundant text, then its main propose is semantic content and not graphical, and then it is no longer OK.
