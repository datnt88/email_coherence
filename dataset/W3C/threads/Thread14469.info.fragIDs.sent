I have spent a lot of time making our web accessible site using CSS. 
I found out late in the game that the pages do not print properly except in NS4.6 on a MAC. 
All other browsers/OS'es really jumble the pages when sent to the printer. 
Is there a fix for this? 
Has anyone else ever asked the same question?

Sean, Thank you for making your site accessible! 
The problem you cite is a browser issue (how they print) and a CSS support issue. 
The only information I know of provided by this Working Group about user agent support for style sheets is in the "User Agent Support for Accessibility" page [1]. 
In that page, there are some links to resources where you may find more information about support for style sheets.

There are several browsers around that support print CSS (using an @media rule to define a print style sheet). 
I am not sure of which they are, but I belive that IE5, Opera 4, and Amaya 2.5 are in the list.
