Planned 1Q2003 HB volunteered to continue his contributions to glossary. 
Planned 2Q2003 Draft date 3/15 means 3/15/2002 Regards/Harvey Sean, Aaron (and even little old me) explored (and even started) SWAG (Semantic Web Agreement Group) whose first project is still floating out there somewhere: the SWAG Dictionary. 
What brought this on was whether you can think of a way to make the glossary "distributed" rather than central (it's a Web, not a tree!) in keeping with SW notions? 
That way everybody with any notion of glossary illumination could "volunteer" contributions thereto. 
Love. 
It's Bad Luck to be Superstitious! 
Added. 
Done. - Judy Judy Brewer +1.617.258.9741 http://www.w3.org/WAI Director, Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI), World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) MIT/LCS Room NE43-355, 200 Technology Square, Cambridge, MA, 02139, USA
