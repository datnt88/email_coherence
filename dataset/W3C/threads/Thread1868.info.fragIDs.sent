Has any thought been given to the creation of an IRC or other realtime chat working group? 
As an ircd developer, client hacker, and frustrated user, the lack of standards is becoming a greater problem. 
The only standard to turn to is a very outdated RFC, which doesn't cover much of the ambiguity that's causing problems now. 
Any thoughts before I persue this further?

In a related note, I know of one group that wishes to register an irc URL scheme and standardize handling of channel handling; I'll forward your mail to one of the salient folk.

The only activity I've seen in this space recently is Christoph Kalt's attempt to document the existing protocol before going any further - see draft-kalt-irc-* for the details. 
Helping him get it out the door would be a Good Thing - last updates were in October, according to my timestamps. 
IRC seems to be among the areas with a large number of people who want to 
see something done, but a very low ability to get agreement on what that "something" is. 
I hope this will change..... Harald A Harald Tveit Alvestrand, EDB Maxware, Norway Harald.Alvestrand@edb.maxware.no

Yeah, I saw impp, however it really doesn't apply to IRC, and seems to have quite a different target that what I was looking for. 
The goals I was more considering were a new IRC RFC that takes into account most/all of the server/client communications(which I realize someone is working on now), as well as architecting enhancements to the IRC protocol in a standard way. 
Many IRC networks are all trying to add the same features, but doing them in drastically different ways. 
Right now, the acid test to see if a new feature will suceed is if you can convince Khaled Mardam-Bey to add support for it in mIRC. 
I have a great respect for Khaled, and have worked with him in the past. 
However, all client authors face the problem of deciding what to spend time on. 
Documenting and extending the IRC protocol is quite a task of its own, which I believes differs from impp. 
I'd also like to at lesat consider the notion of overlapping work between an irc and impp group, since they do share many common ideas.

While it may not apply to IRC specifically, it definitely does touch on the area of realtime chat. 
It would certainly be a nice thing to do. 
But frankly, I don't think the IETF has the bandwidth at present to undertake two such efforts.

On monday the 27th of december I asked to get the IRC documents on the IESG agenda. 
It missed the telechat last thursday (i.e. 30th) but I am pretty sure they will be discussed on the 13th of january.
