<s> Has any thought been given to the creation of an IRC or other realtime chat working group?  </s>
<s> As an ircd developer, client hacker, and frustrated user, the lack of standards is becoming a greater problem.  </s>
<s> The only standard to turn to is a very outdated RFC, which doesn't cover much of the ambiguity that's causing problems now.  </s>
<s> Any thoughts before I persue this further?  </s>

<s> The only activity I've seen in this space recently is Christoph Kalt's attempt to document the existing protocol before going any further - see draft-kalt-irc-* for the details.  </s>
<s> Helping him get it out the door would be a Good Thing - last updates were in October, according to my timestamps.  </s>

<s> Yeah, I saw impp, however it really doesn't apply to IRC, and seems to have quite a different target that what I was looking for.  </s>
<s> The goals I was more considering were a new IRC RFC that takes into account most/all of the server/client communications(which I realize someone is working on now), as well as architecting enhancements to the IRC protocol in a standard way.  </s>
<s> Many IRC networks are all trying to add the same features, but doing them in drastically different ways.  </s>
<s> Right now, the acid test to see if a new feature will suceed is if you can convince Khaled Mardam-Bey to add support for it in mIRC.  </s>
<s> I have a great respect for Khaled, and have worked with him in the past.  </s>
<s> However, all client authors face the problem of deciding what to spend time on.  </s>
<s> Documenting and extending the IRC protocol is quite a task of its own, which I believes differs from impp.  </s>
<s> I'd also like to at lesat consider the notion of overlapping work between an irc and impp group, since they do share many common ideas.  </s>
<s> Kevin  </s>
<s> While it may not apply to IRC specifically, it definitely does touch on the area of realtime chat.  </s>
<s> It would certainly be a nice thing to do.  </s>
<s> But frankly, I don't think the IETF has the bandwidth at present to undertake two such efforts.  </s>
