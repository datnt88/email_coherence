<s> From the UIML 2.0 specification at contains four subelements: structure, style, content, and action-list:" One problem we've (possibly) imposed on ourselves is the neglect of the fourth of those: "actions".  </s>
<s> We deal extensively with the first three and try to differentiate among them but because the last one is so central to Web function ("it's not just documents/pages/sites"), it has to be specifically attended to.  </s>
<s> Since we're into proposals: we should examine the advisability of structuring WCAG 2.0 around how those 4 elements are dealt with.  </s>
<s> Gregg said earlier that for true "generalization" we needed to distance ourselves not just from HTML (or any specific technology/language) but from even more fundamental notions.  </s>
<s> A few fundamental "actions" are: filling in a form; replying/commenting/suggesting/authoring within a Web environment; navigating/surfing/buying/selling/asking/telling; controlling content/presentation/structure(?); up-/down-loading; entering/leaving.  </s>
<s> In general all sorts of possible interactions.  </s>
<s> We can no longer think of this as a one-way medium.  </s>
<s> The "user" is too narrow a view if it is taken to be a passive receptacle for "Web content".  </s>
<s> Just by logging onto the network the "user" has become an active participant, worthy of being considered an "author".  </s>
<s> There is a very widespread attitude that the "client" and "server" are separate realities but this is becoming increasingly less true.  </s>
<s> There are services that enable you to donate CPU cycles, hard drive space, etc. to the network.  </s>
<s> Accessibility issues must address all this stuff, not just look at it as a top-down "broadcast medium" - even though that is what it's surface still appears to be.  </s>
<s> It will get more like email is now, only better linked.  </s>

<s> ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE  </s>
<s> This is an interesting suggestion.  </s>
<s> Are there aspects of it which haven't been adequately addressed in the guidelines, for example in guideline 4 (browsing and navigation), and guideline 5 (input device independence of  </s>
<s> user interfaces)?  </s>
<s> One could argue that if the web content provides its own user interface, the access requirements would be met, on the output side, by text equivalents (guideline 1), separation of content/structure from style/presentation (guideline 2), facilitating comprehension (guideline 3), and facilitating browsing and navigation (guideline 4); and on the input side there is the requirement for device independence (guideline 5).  </s>
<s> These requirements are, naturally, qualified by the over-arching need for compatibility with user agents and adaptive technologies.  </s>
<s> Furthermore, is there any need to distinguish, in terms of basic requirements, from documents and user interfaces?  </s>
<s> Is not a hypertext document a relatively simple user interface, with structure, navigational elements and input in the form of link activations?  </s>
<s> Moving beyond this basic scenario to consider forms and other user interface components included as part of the web content, it would seem that the access requirements remain fundamentally the same, irrespective of how the interface is implemented (as a form, as a client-side script, as a downloaded executable), and so forth.  </s>
<s> If we concentrate on the requirements, as William suggested, rather than on the technologies used to implement them, in formulating the basic access requirements, then is there any aspect which is not adequately covered by the existing scheme as outlined above (this being a summary of the 2.0 draft as it presently stands)?  </s>
<s> If a user interface is supplied by a user agent then it becomes the province of the user agent guidelines.  </s>
<s> All web content provides at least a minimal user interface.  </s>
<s> Web pages are user interfaces.  </s>

<s> William was looking for a guideline on "action" and what I have previously called control logic.  </s>
<s> I think I agree with Jason that in broad terms this is what guideline 5 is about (with a few relevant requirements from other guidelines often coming into play as well).  </s>
