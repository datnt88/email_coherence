<s> Guys, in case you plan to review the appendix in the LC version of the semantics document, I ought to tell you that I was mortified to found a huge bug in the proofs of the RDF and RDFS entailment lemmas just hours before the publication deadline, and had to do some very hasty repair work, so the proofs in the published version are extremely ugly and seriously incomplete.  </s>
<s> Frankly, the RDFS lemma proof is not worth the bother of trying to review - it is a placeholder - so please feel free to ignore them other than to say they are trash.  </s>
<s> I am writing up a better version which I will send you as soon as it is ready, early next week.  </s>
<s> That will, I hope, include a version of the RDFS consistency lemma which Peter has suggested.  </s>
<s> Pat PS.  </s>
<s> You may notice that I have restored a condition on IP in Herbrand interpretations which you suggested earlier that I remove.  </s>
<s> I had forgotten that this condition, although inelegant, is necessary in order to handle the case of the RDF lemma when the graph contains a triple aaa type Property .  </s>
<s> but aaa is not used as a property.  </s>
<s> In this case, with the 'standard' definition of IP in a Herbrand interpretation being just the set of property URIrefs, the construction used in the RDF lemma fails, since the RDF interpretation requires that IP be exactly the class  </s>
<s> extension of rdf:Property.  </s>
<s> Adding these URIs to IP makes no extra triples true, so does not affect the minimality of the Herbrand interpretation, and is harmless for the other (elementary) Herbrand  </s>
<s> results, so I have restored this condition.  </s>
<s> Just to let you know that I didn't do so carelessly or on a whim.  </s>
<s> The basic reason for this being necessary is that RDF allows properties to exist which have an empty extension, by the way.  </s>

<s> Consider the RDF graph ex:foo rdf:type rdf:Property .  </s>
<s> The Herbrand interpretation, H, for this is then IRH = { ex:foo, rdf:Property } u LVH IPH = { ex:foo, rdf:type } IEXTH(rdf:type) = { ex:foo,rdf:Property } IEXTH{x) = {} otherwise ISH = id ILH = id LVH = strings u pairs What I would consider to be the minimal interpretation, M, is IRM = { ex:foo, rdf:Property } u LVM IPM = { rdf:type } IEXTM(rdf:type) = { ex:foo,rdf:Property } IEXTM{x) = {} otherwise ISM = id ILM = id LVM = strings u pairs I do not believe that H   M. Ignoring strings and pairs (where the mapping is identity) the projection mapping is going to have to look like k(rdf:Property) = rdf:Propertybecause ex:foo is the only object k(rdf:type)= rdf:typebecause rdf:type is the only predicate k(ex:foo)= ex:foobecause ex:foo is the only subject but then ex:foo is in IPH and k(ex:foo) is not in IPM.  </s>
<s> By the way, the IL mapping of typed literals in Herbrand interpretations is broken.  </s>
<s> It is defined to be the identity mapping but LV only contains string, pairs of strings and language tags, and well-formed XML literals in G. What then is IL("foo"^ex:bar)?  </s>
<s> peter  </s>
<s> I do not believe that this is harmless for the Herbrand lemma, in particular the only if side: If I satisfies G then H(G)   I In order to prove this only if statement, some mapping A : blank(G) - IRI is chosen such that I+A satisfies G.  </s>
<s> Then, k : IRH u IPH - IRI u IPI is defined to be the restriction of I+A to IRH u IPH.  </s>
<s> For a URI v such that v type Property is in G but with v not being the property of a triple in G, the proof that k(v) is in IPI seems to need the first condition on RDF interpretations.  </s>
<s> However, I is an arbitrary simple interpretation.  </s>

<s> I have not received any response to this comment on the change to Herbrand interpretations.  </s>

<s> Sorry.  </s>
<s> The change has indeed been rescinded ; but more importantly, the subinterpretation relationship   is no longer used in the proof and is not defined anywhere, so this issue is no longer germane to any of the lemmas.  </s>
<s> The previous exposition has been simplified into a single proof using the Herbrand construction to prove the interpolation lemma directly.  </s>
<s> This contracts what was three lemmas (one of which was so trivial that you considered it to be circular) into a single argument and removes the need for the construction and the explicit notion of minimality.  </s>
<s> The longer proofs of the entailment lemmas are then modelled on this construction and argument, with suitable modifications and notational extensions (mostly needed to handle literals.) Pat  </s>
