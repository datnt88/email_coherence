To members of ietf-tls@w3.org: 
I have recently received numerous requests from non-W3C Member organizations to join the W3C Digital Signature Initiative. 
Please note the following: a. DSIG is _not_ open; it is closed to W3C Member organizations ONLY 
Could you explain the rationale behind this, please? 
Cheers, Ben.

I have recently received numerous requests from non-W3C Member organizations to join the W3C Digital Signature Initiative. 
Please note the following: 
a. DSIG is _not_ open; it is closed to W3C Member organizations ONLY 
b. There is, indeed, a mailing list and proposal out for votes to W3C Members, closing on 15 September 1996. 
c. 
For W3C Members [or if you've recently become a W3C Member], more information can be found at: Proposal: Voting Details -- accessible to W3C Members ONLY: If your organization is interested in becoming a Member of W3C, please review the information at http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Consortium/Prospectus/ 
If you need any additional information, feel free to contact me at khudairi@w3.org.

All, Well after reviewing the addresses listed below. 
I cannot justify the costing or the W3C DIgital Signature initiative. 
There seems to be a somewhat lopsided benifit to that org. 
Not to it's members. 
I am quite supprised it the boldness here!

W3C is a membership-based organization, and its members are interested in carrying out this work directly and quickly. 
These members include over 150 companies in the computer, network, telecommunications, service, publishing, banking, and other industries. 
Membership in W3C is open, at very reasonable rates, to any company or organization that is interested in work like the Digital Signature Initiative. 
I would like to emphasize that the call for participation in the Initiative makes it clear that the output of the project will be code and specifications ALL OF WHICH will be made available at no charge to the general public. 
The change control and maintenance of both will be decided by the participants at the end of the project, and turning either or both over to a formal Standards body is certainly a likely outcome. 
--Jim Miller (manager, Technology and Society area, W3C) 
I hardly think that $50,000 can be described as reasonable in the context of my interest in such things (that is, as one of the maintainers of Apache). 
That would be nice, I suppose. 
But turning it over to the only standards body worth turning it over to (the IETF, of course) will almost certainly mean that it will come out completely different. 
Which is why the original working group should be completely open. 
Cheers, Ben.

I think that this is rather ridiculous -- Consensus Development Corporation is one of the most active companies in the web security and digital signature field -- we wrote Sign-A-File for VeriSign, Inc., SSLRef 3.0 with Netscape Communications Corp., and CD-ROM signing for Apple's Pippin computer. 
We have the SSL Plus developer toolkit, write the SSL FAQ, and have a forthcoming certificate toolkit. 
Yet there is no way that we can justify $50K to join W3C! 
Even CI Labs (the OpenDoc Alliance), the SPA, and other associations have room for small companies like ours, and have often found companies like ours are the most valued contributors, and thus have fees commiserate to our size.

While the W3C Digital Signature Initiative is a good topic for discussion, I think that the TLS list is probably not the right place for it. 
Thanks.
