Hello Andrea, Many thanks for your work! 
I have added a link to http://www.w3.org/XML/#trans. 
I have one request and one question: It says: Questo documento: Copyright (c) IAT-CNR, tutti i diritti di questa traduzione sono riservati This is not appropriate. 
According to you Agree: 1.to the redistribution terms of the W3C document copyright notice. 
Consequently, your translation may be republished by the W3C or other entities if it is done in compliance with the notice's terms. 
You don't have to say that explicitly, but you definitely should not say something that is in conflict with the actual facts. 
Also, I wonder whether "La normativa, in lingua inglese,..." is okay, or whether it shouldn't say something like "La versione normativa"? 
Of course, you will know better that me :-). 
Regards, Martin.

Dear Martin I'm sorry for the late. 
Anyway, I have deleted the sentence "Questo documento: Copyright (c) IAT-CNR, tutti i diritti di questa traduzione sono riservati" and correct the sentence "La normativa, in lingua inglese,..." with "La versione in lingua inglese della normativa ..." Besides I would like to begin with the translation of RDF Model and Syntax within next week.
