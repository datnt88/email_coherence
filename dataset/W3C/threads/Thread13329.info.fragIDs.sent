<s> I'd like to propose a simple way to add a bottom line rating as follows.  </s>
<s> Basically, it just asks the user to apply manual checks, and then applies the A, AA, AAA definitions in the guidelines to the "web site".  </s>

<s> If people want to thing about this a lot more,  </s>
<s> we can issue it as a separate statement to avoid any delays in the ER Techniques Doc.  </s>
<s> Len The tool shall give the user the option to manually check off all items on the "web site" that require manual checking.  </s>
<s> Irrelevant items shall be omitted (e.g. if there is not audio or video, manual checking of the textual equivalents is irrelevant.  </s>
<s> This will require an affirmative action  </s>
<s> by the user, such as use of checkboxes.  </s>
<s> The tool shall use this information together with the automatic checkings to give the page an A, AA, or AAA rating, per the guideline definitions (viz.  </s>

<s> "Web Site", by default, shall mean a user-defined "home page", and all pages that can be reached by any series of browser actions that keep the user in the home page directory, subdirectory, sub-sub directory, etc.  </s>
<s> The user shall be able to add or remove pages from that "web site" definition.  </s>
<s> If the user does not use the manual checkoff procedure at all, the tool shall make a statement equivalent to one of the following: a. "This site is not accessible." b. "This site might be accessible.  </s>
<s> Manual checks are needed to properly gauge accessibility."  </s>
<s> The word "might" should be strong .  </s>
<s> If the user chooses to do just priority 1 or 1+2 checkpoints one of the following statements or equivalent shall be issued: c. "This site has at least an A accessibilty rating.  </s>
<s> Manual checks are needed to see if it passes the higher AA or AAA standards" d. "This site has at least an AA accessibilty rating.  </s>
<s> Manual checks are needed to see if it passes the higher AAA standard" Both c and d assume of course that the appropriate manual and automatic checks are passed.  </s>
