I think that the word "not" in the last 4 words is NOT needed. 
Because HTML uses the Unicode bidirectionality algorithm, conforming documents encoded using ISO 8859-8 must be labeled as "ISO-8859-8-i". 
Explicit directional control is also possible with HTML, but cannot be expressed with ISO 8859-8, so "ISO-8859-8-e" should not be used.

No, the word "not" IS needed. 
As noted in the previous paragraph of Section 8.2.4, "ISO-8859-8-i" denotes implicit bidirectionality, and "ISO-8859-8-e" denotes explicit directionality. 
"Unicode bidirectionality algorithm" means implicit bidirectionality algorithm, thus, "ISO-8859-8-e" should NOT be used.

Hello ISHIKAWA-sama. 
Thank you for your advice. 
Please allow me to ask you more detail. 
Because HTML uses the Unicode bidirectionality algorithm, conforming documents encoded using ISO 8859-8 must be labeled as "ISO-8859-8-i". 
Explicit directional control is also possible with HTML, but cannot b e expressed with ISO 8859-8, so "ISO-8859-8-e" should not be used. 
Yes. 
I read RFC1556 to understand the usage of "-i" and "-e". 
I still have two questions. 
(1) Are there many language that can be encoded by "-e" encoding or only Hebrew and Arabic have "-e" (and "-i") encoding ? 
(2) Now my understanding about section 8.2.4 with your help: Section 8.2.4 says "we can use NO '-e' encodings to express explicit directional control, because HTML uses the Unicode 'inolicit' bidirectionality algorithm only". 
Is it right? 
Thank you for your kindness. 
By the way, could I write to you in both English and Japanese (by ISO-2022-JP) ?

Hello Uchida-san, Ishikawa-san is quite right that the text of the HTML 4 specification is correct as it is. 
But his explanation is maybe not exactly right. 
The Unicode bidirectionality algorithm contains both an implicit and an explicit part. 
The implicit part is used when no BIDI control codes or higher-level protocol giving explicit information is used. 
Both BIDI control codes (strongly discouraged) and higher-level protocol (DIR attribute) can be used in HTML, but they have nothing to do with the 8859-8 encoding as such (they can as well be used together with ASCII encoded HTML text, which also is not labeled as US-ASCII-E), so this is the reason why iso-8859-8-e should NOT be used. 
By the way, this was cross-checked with Hebrew experts during the work on HTML 4.0, so I am quite confident it is correct. 
If you have any other question, please feel free to ask (also in Japanese if you want). 
Many thanks again for helping translating HTML 4.0. 
With kind regards, Martin. 
Because HTML uses the Unicode bidirectionality algorithm, conforming documents encoded using ISO 8859-8 must be labeled as "ISO-8859-8-i". 
Explicit directional control is also possible with HTML, but cannot b expressed with ISO 8859-8, so "ISO-8859-8-e" should not be used. 
There are many languages that use the Hebrew or Arabic script and therefore need Bidi support. 
There are also some more scripts (mostly historic) that are written right-to-left. 
In practice, only Hebrew email uses both visual and implicit ordering. 
RFC 1556 was written by somebody mostly familliar with Hebrew, but not so much with Arabic. 
While Hebrew and Arabic have more or less the same problems for Bidi, Arabic needs more work for character- glyph processing. 
In actual practice and early implementations, Hebrew therefore mostly was based on simple ASCII software, with some keyboard hacking and a different font. 
This resulted in using visual ordering in the data. 
On the other hand, for Arabic, a more sophisticated renderer was needed anyway, so in most cases, Bidi was also built in. 
Therefore, visual ordering is not much used for Arabic, while it was and still is in use for Hebrew. 
In contrary to what RFC 1556 says, the "-e" and "-i" was only used for Hebrew, but never took on for Arabic. 
This is mentionned in the HTML 4.0 spec. 
As for the distinction between "-i" and "-e", please see my previous mail. 
As far as I know, there are some standards that allow explicit reordering combined with 8859-8, but they never really came into much use, and are not relevant in connection with HTML 4.0. 
No, this is not right, as explained in my previous mail. 
No problem for me of Ishikawa-san. 
But maybe it is better not to send too many ISO-2022-JP mails to the translators list. 
Regards, Martin. 
Martin, thanks for your follow-up. 
And just FYI: in the list of registered charset values[1], "ISO_8859-6-E" and "ISO_8859-8-E" are only encodings which use explicit directionality ("EBCDIC-JP-E" is not for bi-directional data, I believe ;-). 
Yes, sorry for confusion. 
And for me, ISO-2022-JP-2 is also acceptable, if you need.
