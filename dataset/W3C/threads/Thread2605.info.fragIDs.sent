<s> Just after a clarification:  </s>
<s> In the calculation of the response-auth digest for the 'Authentication-Info' header, is the qop-value used the one which is sent by the client in the 'Authorization' header, or the one sent by the server in the Auth-Info header itself?  </s>
<s> Example: the client sends, e.g. a GET request, with no entity-body, so uses "qop=auth" in the 'Authorization' header.  </s>
<s> The server response then has an entity-body, and uses "qop=auth-int" in the 'Authentication-Info' header.  </s>
<s> The sentence The "response-digest" value is calculated as for the "request-digest" in the Authorization header, except that if "qop=auth" or is not specified in the Authorization header for the request, A2 is implies that the qop-value the client sent is used, but the paragraph message-qop Indicates the "quality of protection" options applied to the response by the server.  </s>
<s> The value "auth" indicates authentication; the value "auth-int" indicates authentication with integrity protection.  </s>
<s> The server SHOULD use the same value for the message- qop directive in the response as was sent by the client in the corresponding request.  </s>
<s> seems to implies that the qop-value the server sends is used.  </s>

<s> The intent was that they should be the same.  </s>
<s> The server presents alternatives it is willing to support in the WWW-Authenticate challenge, and the client chooses one in its Authorization.  </s>
<s> The server should then use that value in the response.  </s>
<s> If it is not willing to use 'auth', then it should not present that alternative in the challenge.  </s>
<s> If you did switch between request and response, you would want the server to use the value it is sending in calculating the digest - the point of including it in the digest is that it be protected from modification.  </s>
<s> As a practical matter, changing qop wouldn't work at all today, since the only commercial browser that does digest at all doesn't support 'auth-int' yet.  </s>

<s> Ah, can auth-int be used for messages with no body (zero-length), e.g. GET requests?  </s>
<s> I presumed it couldn't, maybe this is the source of my confusion.  </s>
<s> Okay, thanks.  </s>

<s> I'm not sure where you would have gotten that impression, but yes, a GET  </s>
<s> request can use auth-int.  </s>
<s> The hash of an empty message body is 'd41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e'.  </s>

<s> Only my imagination...  </s>
<s> I just kind of presumed that H(entity-body) would not be defined if there was 'no' entity-body...  </s>
<s> I see this is wrong now.  </s>
<s> but yes, a GET request can use auth-int.  </s>
<s> Great - "I geddit now".  </s>
<s> Thanks.  </s>
<s> Will do.  </s>
