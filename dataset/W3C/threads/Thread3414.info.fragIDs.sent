<s> In an effort to assist developers and designers in understanding detailed issues when working with web standards, WaSP and the W3C kick off a new project today.  </s>
<s> The project, "WaSP Asks the W3C" involves WaSP Steering Committee members culling questions from supporters and asking members of the W3C's Quality Assurance Group for insight and details.  </s>
<s> WaSP hopes you'll find the project worthwhile.  </s>
<s> The first article is on properly specifying character sets.  </s>
<s> Discussion can take place here.  </s>
<s> Looking forward to your thoughts, Molly Molly E. Holzschlag Education Director World Organization of Webmasters Author / Instructor / Web Designer web: http://www.molly.com/  </s>
<s> There are several ways of specifying the character set for a particular document.  </s>
<s> Which of the following methods (or combination thereof) does the W3C recommend, and why?  </s>
<s> * Have the server administrator set the proper encoding via the HTTP headers returned by the Web server * Have the author add the encoding with a meta element * XHTML authors can add the character encoding using the XML prolog The term "character set" should be avoided, see http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/html-spec/charset-harmful.html .  </s>
<s> The third item should be rephrased to match the prolog.  </s>
<s> It should be "XML declaration", not "XML prolog".  </s>
<s> These three ways of providing the character encoding of a document are not equivalent.  </s>
<s> When trying to figure out the character encoding of a resource, user agents will try, in this order: * The HTTP Content-Type header sent by the server * The XML declaration (only for XHTML documents) * The HTML/XHTML meta element * Other ways.  </s>
<s> There are algorithms to guess the character encoding, for example The XML declaration should be ignored for XHTML documents delievered as text/html (the HTML WG says, user agents should not use any heuristics to determine whether a document is HTML or XHTML and thus parse all XHTML documents delivered as text/html as beeing HTML and thus processing instructions (the XML declaration is a processing instruction from an HTML point-of-view) are to be ignored) (and this is what most user agents do), this information should be added to the document, it is otherwise confusing.  </s>
<s> However, in at least two cases, this is simply not possible: * The document author does not have any way to configure the server to send the proper HTTP Content-Type header * The document is not served via HTTP.  </s>
<s> It's a standalone document, or served via MIME MIME also has a Content-Type header, hence this is not a valid exception.  </s>
<s> In these cases, an HTML document should provide the character encoding via a meta element, and an XML document must provide it via the XML declaration.  </s>
<s> No, XML documents do not need to have an XML declaration in these cases if they are encoded using one of the default encodings (us-ascii for text/xml, utf-8 or utf-16 for most other cases).  </s>
<s> Example of an HTML 4.01 document written in French with a UTF-8 encoding: !DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd" qui, en moi, t'entretiennent ; br / tu n'es pas non plus mienne br / par la force d'un beau d?sir.  </s>
<s> /p The " br / "s have to be " br "s. regards.  </s>
<s> What's the current status of this project?  </s>
<s> Hi Bjoern,  </s>
<s> This is so interesting that you ask this today.  </s>
<s> I was coordinating this for WaSP, but things got busy and you know how that goes.  </s>
<s> Just yesterday I referred someone to the article we did back in December, and I realized that  </s>
<s> this was a very worthy project and I would like to resume working on it.  </s>
<s> That said, I do have a good follow-up article that I was working on with  </s>
<s> Olivier and Karl, so I will commit to finishing that and publishing it on the WaSP site.  </s>
<s> I'm really grateful you asked this question because combined with my thought  </s>
<s> only yesterday it confirms my sense that this is a very good opportunity and one that I don't want to see lost by the wayside.  </s>
<s> The help I could use here would be a list of great topic ideas, this way we can put together an editorial calendar of sorts and work on a topic a month.  </s>
<s> I look forward to everyone's thoughts!  </s>

<s> The WASP doesn't do anything.  </s>
<s> The last thing we have sent has not been published by the WASP.  </s>
<s> We are still waiting for something.  </s>
<s> We don't even have answers to emails.  </s>
<s> I guess it's an organization problem on the WASP side :/ Hope they will move.  </s>
