Perhaps someone on this list can assist with the following access question. 
I have been approached for information regarding use of frame "title"atttribute in relation to JAWS or Window-Eyes. 
While WAI recommends inclusion of "title" it doesn't seem to be picked up in the list of frames generated by either of these products. 
This has lead to a few questions: Is "title" intended to have this function? 
Is the "name" attribute the one that is generally the context identifier for screenreaders? 
Is it a question of verbosity settings in the screenreader? 
Thanks in advance for any input.

(416) 946-3778 Neither is supposed to have this function; the noframes section is supposed to have the function! 
The use of frame names is a work around for blank no frames and "you need to 'upgrade' your browser" no frames first used by Lynx, but then adopted by Amaya, at least. 
It is only marginally successful because the pages that need it tend to name frames left, top or centre, rather than indicating their function. 
The use of title is just the obvious generalisation of title to frame elements. 
I would reckon the chances of finding title on a page that doesn't already have a useful noframes element are negligible. 
Laurie, I find the discussion of frame titles really depressing. 
It is depressing because there is not a clear recommendation from WCAG, trying not to be too prescriptive, I guess. 
As a result neither web authors nor assistive technology developers know what to do. 
(1) Here's WCAG: 12.1 Title each frame to facilitate frame identification and navigation. 
[Priority 1] For example, in HTML use the "title" attribute on FRAME elements. 
(2) Section 508 used the WCAG wording without the example. 
Here is my analysis of how well assistive technology is listening to the these recommendations. 
(1) Lynx, which is not assistive technology, really, uses the name attributes on the frame elements for its list of frames. 
(2) HomePage Reader v2.5 used the title attribute on the frame element if it was present but reverted to the title element of the actual frame page if there was no title attribute. 
I know of no other AT that uses/used the title attribute. 
(3) Jaws uses the name attribute of the frame element for its list of frames, and announces both the name attribute and the title element as it reads the frame. 
(4) Window-Eyes only uses only the title element. 
I don't know if Window-Eyes provides a list of frames. 
(5) HPR v3.0 uses the title element of each frame page in its list of frames; it uses neither the name nor the title attribute. 
(This is a bug, in my opinion!) The only conclusion I can make is to recommend to web authors is provide both title and name attributes on the frame elements (make them the same) and quality titles on their frame pages. 
In other words do all three and your bases will be covered. 
Of course the name and title attributes describe the purpose of the frame, like "main content" or "local navigation." Jim jim@jimthatcher.com

(416) 946-3778 I essentially agree with Jim's recommendation, but it is useful to have a name attribute that is at least meaningful, and a title attribute that takes advantage of the fact that you can have several words in it. 
(The key word should of course be the same). 
In addition you should use the noframes element, as per the HTML specification, to provide navigation links into your content for browsers which do not render each frame. 
I will take an action item to propose an update to the techniques for WCAG. 
Further comments below Laurie, (1) Here's WCAG: 12.1 Title each frame to facilitate frame identification and navigation.

CMN Here's where WCAG points for techniques to do this: checkpoint in WCAG 1.0 has a link to techniques. 
In most cases there is further useful information both at the point and often just around it). 
Essentially the examle given here uses title on the frame element in the frameset. 
As Jim points out below, that probably isn't enough to work well everywhere.

Charles, When you say quote it is useful to have a name attribute that is at least meaningful, and a title attribute that takes advantage of the fact that you can have several words in it. 
end quote I think it is important to ask "useful to whom." 
It isn't useful to the web developer to have to add two attributes. 
It isn't useful to the assistive technology developer because they are faced with the decision of which to speak. 
Speaking both is redundant and "noisy." 
So add a user choice in the AT! There are far too many switches, and even with the switch, when is a user to decide to choose one over the other? 
It is so much better for all when there is one clear choice better for the web developer, AT developer and user.

The web developers are responsible for the problem. 
If they used noframes properly, the assistive technology might have relied on it. 
Instead, it has to work around the lack of noframes the best it can. 
My reasoning: It is useeful to the people who are now living with systems that speak the name (lynx for example), and there needs to be a name anyway. 
It is useful to have a better title - that's the thing that is intended to be read to a human (name is for targetting content into one frame or another). 
The AT should be speaking the title. 
The Web developer needs to add a name, and should add a title thatmay be the same (navigation) or may be more useful if they are planning on being helpful. 
The authoring tool should make this more or less painless anyway. 
The idea that the AT should let you choose is solely based on the fact that when authors and their tools are not up to scratch it is helpful to be able to find out whatever else is available. 
It's not the sort of choice u would ever make in a well-constructed web - a user should decide to use it when they get incomprehensible gibberish, or nothing at all, from the standard access paths.
