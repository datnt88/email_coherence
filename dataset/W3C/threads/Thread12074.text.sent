in response to the second ordered list item contained in Member A's review, quote 2. lack of clarity about the expected level of sophistication of the user of the tool unquote i would strongly advocate that a reformulation of the first introductory paragraph for ATAG Guideline 1 be included in the section entitled "1.2 Checkpoint Priorities" with the following modifications... BEGIN PROPOSED TEXT When a tool generates markup, an author usually remain unaware of the accessibility status of the content being produced, unless he or she: 1. uses an accessibility checklist as a guide when reviewing the document source created by the tool. 
2. explicitly invokes an external tool, utility, or online service to check the accessibility of the content that has been created, and/or 3. explicitly invokes an accessibility evaluation and repair feature which has been built into the tool, Obviously, such repair strategies are impractical if the author must then either make any appropriate corrections by hand or in response to prompts and alerts without guidance from the tool itself. 
Since most authors--regardless of their level of familiarity with a particular markup language or tool--are unfamiliar with accessibility issues as they relate to web content, the onus is on the authoring tool to (a) generate accessible markup; and (b) where appropriate, to guide the author in producing accessible content in a manner consistent with the "look and feel" of the tool. 
END PROPOSED TEXT why this particular formulation? 
just as we cannot possibly bar anyone from using the ATAG to promulgate an entity's purchasing requirements, we cannot address the "expected level of sophistication of the user", as that is something that each individual developer will have to address when deciding what features to add or emphasize in their tool... what we can do, however, is reiterate our oft-repeated mantra that there is no reasonable expectation that an author -- regardless of his or her familiarity (or lack thereof) with a particular markup language or user interface -- will be aware of the accessibility issues which need to be addressed when content is being created or when it is automatically transformed by an application (particularly those not explicitly thought of as an authoring tool, such as the Office suite or WordPerfect) for transmission via the web in what is traditionally referred to as a web-based markup language (i.e. HTML, XML, SMIL, etc.) i know that the proposed text above could be tersified and clarified -- but i think it is the right way to address this particular issue... gregory He that lives on Hope, dies farting -- Benjamin Franklin, Poor Richard's Almanack, 1763 Gregory J.

WebMaster and Minister of Propaganda, VICUG NYC KLB: You forgot one of the best ways to check this -- asking someone with a disability to try to use the site! 
All the automatic checks in the world won't tell you anything if a blind user can't navigate or a deaf user can't access content! 
GJR: KLB: Wording nitpicks -- we should avoid words like "obvious" (if it's obvious, we don't need to say it's obvious!) and impractical which imply value judgments and may not be true over the lifetime of the document. 
GJR: KLB: That looks okay to me. 
I would say "many authors" perhaps -- perhaps it's just optimistic thinking on my part, but I hope that in the future (over the lifetime of this document) things will really start to change for the better! 
GJR: KLB: Well, I think it's clear (from member comments) that we need to show we have addressed this issue in some way, at least. 
Otherwise it looks like an omission that discredits the document. 
Your suggestion may be one way to do this. 
GJR: No disagreement in principle.

You mean they suggest EM ! 
(Which you can of course style to "font-style: italic;") Otherwise the user with a disability who checks over your outgoing email might not "hear" the emphasis in a smart screenreader, Gregory.

unquote right on, kynn! 
don't know how i forgot THAT one -- guess i should ask someone with a disability to check my outgoing email from now on! 
as for the sentence which begins with the odious "Obviously", i repropose it, thus: Such repair strategies are unlikely to be initiated if the author must then make any appropriate corrections by hand or in response to prompts and alerts _without_ guidance from the tool itself. 
Note: the underscores surrounding the word "without" indicates suggested use of "font-style: italic;" gregory.

aloha, kynn! as you pointed out, since ATAG declares the HTML 4.0 loose.dtd, the emphasis i suggested should be enclosed in the EM element -- which, of course, would be defined as "font-style : italic;" for the benefit of those using CSS-enabled browsers... gregory PS: i make a very hard-to-miss target!

WebMaster and Minister of Propaganda, VICUG NYC I believe that the only reason ATAG declares the HTML 4.0 loose DTD is that Amaya keeps putting that declaration at the top of the file. 
I've put the strict DTD there with emacs, but when Charles edits with Amaya, it reverts to transitional. 
I consider this a bug.
