[Please note that this is COMPLETELY MY PERSONAL OPINION, and not any kind of official pronouncement from the WG] It has taken me several days of digesting the comments and suggestions on this list to recall WHY we on the DOM working group have done some of things we've done that are contrary to common practice and the commandments of the Design Patterns book. 
I've made mention of a nightmarish web of constraints that we are tangled up in, but since you've all been so helpful lately, maybe it's time to clarify some of those constraints so that you don't waste time coming up with perfectly reasonable but non-adoptable suggestions. 
First, the names should be simple, short, informative, work within various script languages' rather lame scoping rules, make correct use of SGML teminology, be consistent with common usage, but not conflict with actual Dynamic HTML implementations. 
Ha ha ha! Don't get me started .... So, if you wonder why something like tags() in IE4's API got turned into getElementsByTagName() in the DOM, think about these constraints for awhile. 
Needless to say, "short" often loses out ... 
Second, the API must be generally backward compatible with Netscape Navigator and MS Internet Explorer for obvious reasons. 
Strictly speaking, 
we've tried to be compatible with "DOM Level 0", which is defined as that which was common between Navigator 3.0 and IE 3.0. 
This leads to some counter-intuitive constraints; for example, several concrete element types in HTML already have array semantics in the browsers' APIs. 
This prevents us from allowing the square bracket syntax for getting at children in 
ECMAScript; e.g. mychild = mynode[i] will not work. 
Thus, as I understand it, we MUST have a "HAS A" relationship between an Element and the collection of its children, not an "IS A" relationship between Element and a CompositeNode base class. 
Third, (although I realize some of you apparently disagree) we believe it is critical that the DOM "language neutral", i.e., that outside of unavoidable "language binding" issues, it be available in principle from widely-used programming languages like Java, (but including C/C++), script languages like ECMAScript (but also VBScript, Perl, Tcl, etc.), CORBA (but also COM), and anything else someone wants to write a binding for (e.g. Eiffel, Python, Scheme, etc.). 
This means that we can't use certain features of supported by many languages (such as multiple inheritance, or various types of name overloading) that sophisticated designers are used to. 
Fourth, the API itself should be as small as possible, yet for various political and PR reasons, we need to accomodate a wide range of "paradigms" 
for how documents are navigated and manipulated. 
That is, we can't say "Here is the ONE TRUE DOM PATH, thou shalt do it our way!" because we want the DOM APIs to be used in real life rather than becoming "zealotware". 
We have to make it easy for script writers to use the DOM in the way they are used to, yet give Java programmers access to techniques they are used to; 
and since we all work for organization that intend to profit from their DOM support, we try hard not to inconvenience our own customers in their migration to the DOM. 
This is why the NodeIterator class is defined the way it is: some will want to navigate DOM documents as via collections with their array-like syntax and semantics (some will prefer using numerical indexs, and some will demand "associative array" name-based lookup); and others will want to 
use iteration semantics. 
We don't WANT to have separate methods that return indexed arrays, associative arrays, and iterators all over the place, so we tried to invent an abstraction that covered all of these. 
It 
may not be the most elegant piece of software design that you ever saw; it was quite literally invented by a committee; it certainly has flaws that we would like help correcting ... but I for one find the idea of a small API with a single highly-overloaded navigation class preferable to a an API that's bloated by multiple versions of many methods that simply return different types of navigation objects. 
One may disagree, but please consider our constraints in the context of any suggestion -- we can't simply say things like "DOM documents are trees! 
Tell your customers to learn to use tree navigation", or "50 gazillion VisualBasic and JavaScript developers can't be wrong! 
Use indexed collections for everything" even though either would make the DOM API more simple and elegant. 
I hope this helps explain some of the background for the way the DOM API is drafted today, and why some perfectly reasonable comments and suggestions from this mailing list have not been adopted. 
Thanks for listening, Mike Champion 
Mike, This is a good exposition of some of the constraints we face as a working group, and why we aren't always able to take what seems a logical path. 
I hope this explanation will help those who have been wondering; however, I also hope it won't be interpreted to mean that suggestions are unwelcome. 
Despite the occasional flame wars (which, fortunately, have been handled with reasonable professionalism) I think the large volume of comments, suggestions and debate is very healthy. 
The task we have undertaken is immense, and well-reasoned input is always worth listening to. 
Best regards, Jared

Good message, but of course I have some comments.... Overall, I understand the constraints. 
However, this is a public mailing list, this is the forum for commenting on the standard, and as far as I know, the only way in which the standard has been presented to anyone outside the organizations collaborating to create the standard. 
Step back and look at the DOM as a product. 
This mailing list is a market research tool. 
Customers are telling you that the product is broken and are strongly encouraging you to modify your product. 
I can't resist commenting on this. 
Of course I understand the rationale here. 
flame But backward compatibility with products implementing a standard that doesn't yet exist? 
Seems kinda backward to me. 
A standard is meant to simplify development efforts for those using the standard--not just the implementors--but first the standard has to exist! 
Most customers understand and grudgingly accept incompatibilities in favor of standard implementations. 
If the existing implementations are broken when they evolve to support a NEW standard, customers may grumble, but they won't revolt. 
Especially if it means that they won't have to maintain multiple versions of their code (or pages or scripts). 
There are many examples of incompatibilities between the IE &amp; Netscape--many of which could and should be addressed by DOM--How are those incompatibilities being addressed while maintaining backward compatibility? 
/flame Ok, I feel better now. 
Could you explain this further? 
Since CompositeNode "HAS A" collection of children, if Element "IS A" CompositeNode, then it too "HAS A" collection of children... What is the difference between Element inheriting its child list from CompositeNode rather than Node? 
The proposal for a CompositeNode was meant to more accurately describe the constraint that there are node types that can't have children. 
If the CompositeNode interface is not implemented, then there should be a NotSupportedException specified on insertBefore() so that *correct* implementations can complain when I try to add an element to a comment. 
Yet another exception to catch... 
As a client, I would rather know at compile time that I can't perform an operation than wait to be informed via an exception at runtime. 
The argument to keep insufficient or incorrect abstractions in an API to satisfy vendors who happen to implement something similar is pretty weak. 
This is a standard that will hopefully have a long lifetime. 
Should defects be knowingly built into the first release? 
NodeIterator handles indexed access and iterators. 
Where is the associative array access? 
And if names should be descriptive, it should be called something other than Iterator--that name describes only a portion of its behavior. 
Again, for the ECMAScript/VBScript programmers out there, the name won't matter--they'll be using indexed access in the same way they do now, right? 
Good argument. 
I'll agree that multiple access methods are necessary. 
I just disagree on the way in which the DOM authors have chosen to provide those methods. 
Don't get me wrong--I know that the DOM in its current form is the result of a significant cooperative effort between companies that may also be competitors. 
Having participated in standards efforts in the past, I also understand the difficulty that was undoubtedly involved in creating the spec. 
And I think the spec is very close to being finished. 
It just needs a little tweaking here and there.
