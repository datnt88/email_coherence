Hello, I've finished the Japanese translation of "Techniques for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0" (W3C Note 6 November 2000). 
Those are available at : [WCAG10-TECHS] [WCAG10-CORE-TECHNIQUES] [WCAG10-HTML-TECHNIQUES] [WCAG10-CSS-TECHNIQUES] Thank you. 
P.S. Could you change my email address and the URI of my translations of Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 on translation page? 
(http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WAI-WEBCONTENT-TRANSLATIONS) zspc@phoenix-c.or.jp to webmaster@zspc.com

Hello Miki, Many thanks for all your translations. 
I would like you to change one thing: Introduce e.g. a hr between the text about the translation at the very top and the labels such as [Content], [HTML Techniques], and so on. 
The former are your additions, the later are translated from the original, and they should be clearly distinguished. 
In addition to adding a hr , it is a good idea to also use a different background color for your additions. 
Many thanks again and kind regards, Martin. 
Dear Martin, I've added hr to all of my translations. 
Thank you very much.
