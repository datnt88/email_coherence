Hi, when I was browsing through directories Amaya for Win95 created on my system, I've found in the config directory some files with names en-*, fr-*, and de-*. 
I would like to create similar files cz-* with translation to the Czech language. 
Are there any guidelines how to do it?

Yes, there are - I recall seeing them somewhere. 
But I don't recall where. 
Sigh. 
I'll have a look this evening, since the Amaya team are probably asleep now...

It's very easy to create an interface for a new language provided that it could be displayed by an existing ISO-latin font. 
The section "Dialogue Language" in Configuring Amaya explains how to process. 
Normally you have just to copy the en-* into cz-* and translate words. 
Amaya interface will change a lot in the next release, so I suggest you to just experiment the process and do the real work on the next release. 
Regards Irene.
