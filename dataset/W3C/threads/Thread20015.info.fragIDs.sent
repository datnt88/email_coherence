<s> Hi, when I was browsing through directories Amaya for Win95 created on my system, I've found in the config directory some files with names en-*, fr-*, and de-*.  </s>
<s> I would like to create similar files cz-* with translation to the Czech language.  </s>
<s> Are there any guidelines how to do it?  </s>

<s> Yes, there are - I recall seeing them somewhere.  </s>
<s> But I don't recall where.  </s>
<s> Sigh.  </s>
<s> I'll have a look this evening, since the Amaya team are probably asleep now...  </s>

<s> It's very easy to create an interface for a new language provided that it could be displayed by an existing ISO-latin font.  </s>
<s> The section "Dialogue Language" in Configuring Amaya explains how to process.  </s>
<s> Normally you have just to copy the en-* into cz-* and translate words.  </s>
<s> Amaya interface will change a lot in the next release, so I suggest you to just experiment the process and do the real work on the next release.  </s>
