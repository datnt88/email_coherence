... but it probably ought to go somewhere more useful.

It could be very useful. 
How about sending it to the list as an html attachement and then we'll have it in the archive to refer to. 
Brian Stunningly good idea. 
Apologies for size, here they are. 
Schema to follow.

http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/ ( echo "ouroboros"; cat )  /dev/fd/0 # it's like talking to yourself sometimes I find great big attachments to be something of a burden... your mention of "apologies" suggests you do too... W3C has a mailing list set up *just* so you can mail stuff* there to get an archive pointer: www-archive@w3.org 
(archived at http://www.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/ ) so my preference would be: send big attachments to www-archive and then send notice (including a pointer) to w3c-rdfcore-wg. 
That's my preference, but I know of some folks that actually prefer to receive copies of documents rather than pointers, so I leave it to the chairs and/or staff contacts to decide which policy, if any, best serves the needs of the group. 
*stuff related to W3C work, that is. 
It only accepts mail from folks that are subscribed to some W3C mailing list. 
Dan Connolly, W3C http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/ Second Dan's preference. 
I frequently like to acquire local copies of documents (for when I'm offline), but the nice thing about getting the pointer in the mail rather than the copy is I get more of a choice about when/whether I download the copy (like, not today, being on a slow line).
