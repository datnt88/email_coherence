WAI folks, I recently received a tax publication via U.S. post from Bernard F. Crowly, Jr. Acting Commissioner Massachusetts Department of Revenue PO Box 7010 Boston, MA 02204 On the back it says Instructions for e-filing can be found in this booklet by visiting our website at: www.state.ma.us/dor 
I like to thow paper copies away in favor of online documents, so I went looking. 
The font size was smaller than I was used to; after checking my client configuration, I went into debug mode and did a "view source." 
I was disappointed to find: body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#336633" vlink="#333366" alink="#663333" topmargin="0" leftmargin="0" font size="2" face="helvetica,arial" The most commonly requested tax publications offered by the Department of Revenue can be found below. 
in the source of Tax Publications Last Modified: Friday, 12 February, 1999 13:41:00 GMT So in my "SGML cop" habit, and as a taxpaying citizen, I began to cite them in violation of the W3C Web Content Guidelines (and perhaps the relevant U.S. law... can't remember enough to cite it just now.) I found the feedback address mailto:dor@shore.net after reading: "Please note that this e-mail service is intended for comments about the DOR website only." 
Then I started with WAI Home Page [I suggest a more complete title for that page: W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) Home Page] expecting to find things like: Don't use font ; use stylesheets in stead. 
Don't use tables for layout Don't set the background color without setting the foreground color and vice versa. 
But I can't find them stated plainly. 
Help? 
The closest I found was "5. Use markup and style sheets properly. 
" but I didn't see anything about the font tag in particular. 
One other tidbit from "view source": I reviewed the online information about this product: FrontPage 98 - Overview but I could not find an mechanism for online product feedback. 
Clues? 
Dan W Connolly On the WAI homepage, under Resources, there is a poorly named link "WAI Quicktips" that leads you to the following: There appears to be no link on the WAI homepage to the web content checklist, but there probably should be; the URL for that is: QuickTips are a brief summary that can fit on a business-card or credit-card sized piece of paper; the checklist is a full list of exactly the kinds of things you were looking for.

One of the first link off the WAI Home page is (26 Feb) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines What else do we need ? 
The guidelines embedded inline in our home page ? 
no, but the link to the guidelines could well be supplimented with a link to the checklist. 
In the current organization, it's not clear whether the relationship of the guidelines to the checklist is "part of" or "see also"; each has it's own title page (incl. 
status of this document) which suggests "see also" but there's no entry for the checklist on http://www.w3.org/TR/ nor http://www.w3.org/WAI/ Also... the link from the "How the Guidelines are organized" section to the checklist doesn't go thru the references section; that again suggests "part of". 
In any case, it's now clear to me that the checklist is more what I was after; for example: "7.1 Avoid using tables for layout. 
" The admonitions against overuse of font size aren't as explicit, but there's some relevant stuff in there. 
Dan Connolly The WCAG isn't a direct link to the checklist; since many people will want "instant info", it would be good to have the checklist link at the same place the Quicktips are listed. 
(Also, the quicktips need better link text or a description.) 
Now you're being silly.

I agree with this suggestion. 
The list of accessibility checkpoints ought to have a separate and easily found link on the WAI homepage. 
It does have more information then the Quicktips, but is less intimidating than the full Authoring guidelines page. 
It already does have the links to the full page, so if someone wants more information on why they should "Avoid any blinking or updating of the screen that causes flicker." they can find more information.
