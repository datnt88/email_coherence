#[1]Start [2]Glossary [3]Copyright The Web Design Group SPAN - Generic Inline Container Syntax SPAN ... /SPAN Attribute Specifications * [4]common attributes Contents [5]Inline elements Contained in [6]Inline elements, [7]block-level elements The SPAN element is a generic inline container. 
SPAN carries no structural meaning itself, but it can be used to provide extra structure through its [8]LANG, [9]DIR, [10]CLASS, and [11]ID attributes. 
[12]Style sheets are often used to suggest a presentation for a given class or ID. SPAN should only be used where no other HTML [13]inline element provides a suitable meaning. 
If a presentation such as bold or italic text would be suitable on visual browsers, authors may prefer to use an appropriate [14]font style element. 
For example: 1. P SPAN LANG=fr La R?volution Tranquille /SPAN shook Quebec in the early 1960's. 
2. P I LANG=fr La R?volution Tranquille /I shook Quebec in the early 1960's. 
These examples are identical in meaning, but the second example uses the [15]I element to suggest italic text. 
[16]DIV is a block-level equivalent of SPAN for containing [17]block-level elements such as [18]P and [19]TABLE.

How does the I element support the separation of presentation and other content? 
I thought we wanted to get rid of the style related elements embedded in the other content? 
Marja 
The WCAG would prefer the SPAN solution above to the I solution. 
The point here is that Chris asked how we could put LANG information on words and phrases and SPAN is the answer. 
WDG is not so enthused with separation as WCAG is. 
But that is a separate (and a GL) issue. 
Al Al 
Yes, that is a serious concern. 
It's another way of phrasing the discussion titled "CSS Abuse" that started in Len Leonard R. Kasday, Ph.D. Institute on Disabilities/UAP, and Department of Electrical Engineering Temple University Ritter Hall Annex, Room 423, Philadelphia, PA 19122 kasday@acm.org
