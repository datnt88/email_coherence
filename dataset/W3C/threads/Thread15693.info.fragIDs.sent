Hi, 
I'm a bit of a web design novice, and I want to implement a counter on my lab's web page. 
I've been rudely surprised by all that is involved in creating counters in the first place--PERL nightmares on top of the HTML. 
Plus, I've been doing my best to follow the W3C accessibility guidelines to keep the page accessible, so I was wondering if anyone had any tips on creating "accessible counters," or is there is any such thing as an "accessible counter." 
Do they typically cause problems? 
Especially with the scripting involved? 
Any advice would be *greatly* appreciated! 
Thanks, Kristine 
I think mat right has one at: if you can't find a text one, see if you can put an alt in the img source that at least tells us what it is. 
he's got some other counters and they are already made for you and you just need to customize them.

Well, the model for most web counters is to provide an image or a series of images, e.g. one reading "03424" or several that read "0" "3" "4" "2" "4". 
For these types of counters, you just have to make sure that you are providing ALT text for each one. 
This means your script has to provide the correct numbers. 
Many "free" or third-party counters use graphics that aren't even hosted on your machine; this leads to problems because they are unable to change the HTML tags in your page, and can only provide a graphic. 
E.g.: people have seen this page. 
In this case, the source of the image would be a CGI script on my computer, and it would use the id of 654, which would be a code I would assign to your page. 
My CGI script would know how many times id 654 has been accessed, and it would create a graphic showing that number. 
However, my CGI script has no access to the ALT attribute (which was not included in your HTML above); even if we used a value, we couldn't provide the actual numbers. 
So we can use something like ALT="Many" -- but that still presents access problems, since non-graphical users can't get the same information made available to those with graphical browsers. 
Image-based counters are an annoying barrier to accessibility. 
If you can run the scripts locally on your machine, and call them via Server Side Includes or the like, you have a lot more control over what is returned. 
Instead of something like this: ...you can just have the script add ALT text appropriately. 
Two ways to this are: or The specifics on how to do this with your chosen CGI programming language are left as an exercise for the coder. 
Now, regardless of the issue of counters and accessibility, I have a few more words about counters in general: Don't use counters. 
Counters produce nothing useful for your web page, have no value whatsoever to the visitors, increase the system load, increase the download time, and as we've seen before, many have serious accessibility flaws. 
In addition, counters (like link exchange banners) are a sure sign of a new and in- experienced web designer, or at least, someone who hasn't thought out very carefully what they're doing. 
They're even less acceptable on "professionally"-done web sites. 
Now, if you want to get information on how many times your page is accessed, you should be able to get this from the server logs. 
If you don't have access to those, request it from your sysadmin or webmaster. 
Server logs, especially when run through a good analysis program (I like "analog"), can provide so much more useful information than a counter can, and it doesn't decrease the usability or esthetics of your web page.

Creating an accessible counter would not be difficult given the proper tools. 
Obviously, you would need to use a counter that doesn't rely on images to display its values. 
This is only a 'hack' method of creating a counter, anyway. 
Image-based counters are used because many people don't have access to some sort of embedded script language. 
And, others don't know how to use the scripting capabilities they have. 
But, first, let us take an objective look at the situation: What is the goal of the counters? 
Do they need to show users the visitor count? 
Do they need to show you the visitor count? 
Do they need to do both? 
Do the counts need to appear on every page? 
If yes, Why? 
Is there a good reason Can the counts be shown on one page? 
If no, Why not? 
Is there a good reason Do you have access to the server logs? 
If you aren't sure, find out. 
This is much more useful than simple counters. 
A program such as Analog (http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~sret1/analog/) would give you quite a few statistics to help you manage your documents and links. 
Analog will allow you to see links to erroneous URIs, such as 404(object not found), the referrer to the bad URI, who accessed the URI and when, etc. 
You can use this processed log information to generate statistics for each page. 
Or, you can have Analog generate the statistics for you. 
Analog's statistics generation isn't completely accessible, but, Stephen Turner is looking into alternative ways to display the output. 
However, Analog will output formats that can be used by other scripts to generate custom, accessible statistics. 
Do you have access to SSI, PERL, or PHP? 
If you have SSI and PERL, you could use a text-based counter and have it called from each page. 
This could print text into the page, or, simply increment the count in a data file. 
You could view the counter values from some central location. 
Also, if you have SSI you could use a text-based counter written in C or any other language. 
If you have PHP, you could embed a counter in each page. 
This could print text into the page, or, simply increment the count in a data file. 
Again, you could view the counter values from some central location. 
Overall, an accessible counter is feasible. 
Is it necessary to have a counter on each page? 
If you believe it is, then there are many ways to accomplish this. 
I think the information is useful in administering a site. 
But, I don't think that one must include it in every page. 
I prefer using Analog to give me detailed statistics. 
However, some folks don't have access to their server logs. 
In these cases, it may come down to using an embedded script. 
Or, worse, an image-based counter. 
I will say that some image-based counters, such as WWWCount (popularly, Count.cgi), can have the display turned off. 
You can create a separate page that displays the values of all counters. 
There is still a tiny image on the page, but, it is blank and serves no visible purpose. 
This is crude, but, it would work in a pinch.

I have not seen any accessible counters, although they can be coded. 
The difficulty is that all the mechanisms for including text generated on the fly (such as the number of times this page has been visited) mean that the page they are included in cannot be cached so they have to be fetched complete from the source each time, thus increasing the effective bandwidth requirement of the page and the load on the original server. 
Including counters (or other dynamic content) is more difficult than writing pages which simply provide static content updated from time to time. 
The easiest solutions around at the moment use databases to provide the content, and assemble pages on request. 
To use them accessibly requires a small amount of programming (you can read it out of the manual) and a knowledge of how to write accesible pages. 
It is a trivial exercise to create a counter using a system such as this, but it does require that you have control over the web-server. 
Most ISPs are not very keen on this. 
The alternative is to use, as kynn said, a PERL script or something similar, and Server-Side Includes to add the count as a piece of text. 
Most ISPs allow a cgi-bin, and the script required is fairly simple. 
But as a personal preference I would not put a counter on a page. 
If the pge owner wants to know how many people use it, then create a way for them to get the real stats. 
If someone reading the page wants to know how popular it is, then you can just use a picture of any number you like, and appropriate ALT text. 
No need for cgi's, PERL, or anything else. 
And it's almost as accurate as most other counters.

One of the counters in the site David mentioned is indeed a counter that according to the author presents in text, not image.
