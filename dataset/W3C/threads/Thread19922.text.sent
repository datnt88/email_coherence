Hi! Now there is the option to switch between editor and browse modes. 
The next logical step would be to allow a single click to enter a link in browse mode, just like the other browsers do. 
Or is there some reason not to do so? 
Juha Manninen Uh oh... ;-) We debated this a few weeks ago and it turned into a completely unnecessary religious debate about how we like our window manager's set up, etc etc. Basically, the two opposing views are: 1) The GUI should be uniform across the two modes, so if we have double-click in editor mode, it should be double-click in browser mode too. 
2) Single click would be nice, and it is worth breaking aforementioned uniformity to do so. 
Personally, I think it should be possible to place such a decision at the door of the end user, but no development, AFAIK, is being done in that direction at the moment. 
I don't think any more debate along these lines is necessary - the two opinions mentioned above are irreconcilable.

I agree that it is a bit of a religious argument. 
Personally I prefer having the User interfacce consistent within the tool. 
(But then, I don't use the 'read-only' feature, which is what the browse mode is.) Exposing the function to the user would be nice for those who want to split it. 
I am not sure if it is currently one of the functions which can be configured - check the help page.
