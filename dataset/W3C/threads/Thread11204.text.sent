The ERB schedule calls for voting on Feb. 26 on these items. 
3.2.a 
What should the generalized multiway link be called? 
Multilink, General Link, Independent link, anything else? 
Multilink will do, xml-mlink for short. 
ht Why not just "xlink"? 
The initial "x" suggests: * graphically the multiway connections of the link * "X"ML * its (potential) "x"ternal nature [Sam Hunting:] Because all reserved XML names start with "XML-". 
Jon ... not to mention "Extensible". 
Yes! 
The collective thought process gives birth to another winner. 
Sign me up for xlink. 
-T. 
XLINK gets my vote.

GL3 2PU, UK As Jon points out, it needs to begin with "XML-", being reserved. 
Sorry -- newbie mistake. 
However, for the pure sizzle, I'd think of changing the convention .... "xml-" anything doesn't exactly come trippingly off the tongue. 
Anyhow, if in newbie fashion I'm reopoening a can of worms,feel free to admonish me... Irrelevant; xlink still works. 
It's going to have to be XML-something; the spec currently uses XML-MLINK, and in the prose we say multilink. 
So it could be XML-XLINK and "extended link". 
I still like it. 
-T. [Tim Bray:] Sorry, I thought from the subject line for this thread that "xlink" was being proposed as an alternative to "xml-link". 
Now the proposal seems to be "xml-xlink" as an alternative to "xml-link", which is a different matter. 
I could go with xml-link for the XML version of a contextual link and xml-xlink for the XML version of an independent link. 
"Extended link" works for me, too, and I like the opposition of (plain old) link (like the kind you're already used to from HTML, only better) vs. xlink.
