There doesn't seem to be any obvious method in Amaya to inserting an &amp;nbsp; 
tag when 
this character is wanted (say in a telephone number). 
Similarly how do I get 
other characters like the Trademark one? 
Inserting the character in the source view seems to be the only method.

[DJW:] &amp;nbsp; is not a tag, it is an entity, which is a macro. 
[DJW:] In both these cases, you can enter them directly as they 
are in the default character encoding (at least for Amaya 
3.1 on NT). [DJW:] --------------------------- DISCLAIMER --------------------------------- Any views expressed in this message are those of the individual sender, except where the sender specifically states them to be the views of BTS. 
The entity &amp;nbsp; can be inserted in Amaya by Control+space. 
When saving a document Amaya generates the ISO-Latin 1 code of the character 
instead of the entity value. 
We could change the Amaya export if you think that the entity is better.

Please use numeric (e.g., &amp;#160;) rather than named entities to maintain closer compatibility with XML.

Maybe the user could choose how these are seen? 
I'd prefer these numerical identifiers to be given names when possible, even if it is 
better to have the numerical form in the text Amaya outputs to disk.

So you're saying that 1.) the webpage should show the character represented; 
2.) the view source should show the named entity, and 3.) the saved text should actually have the numeric entity value? 
Ugh. 
Now if there's an application for Occam's Razor, this is it.

better. 
Not quite. 
I'm saying 1 and 2 should be user selectable, but the choice settings should be obvious to someone looking at the tool. 
I'm applying the Razor to the case where I pick up your document with numeric entity values in, but I want them in named form. 
You won't be pleased if I push it through sed, do other edits, and send it back to you with named entities in! 
:-) Let the computer present the information in the form the user wants. 
The numeric forms are better suited to machines than people.

Which is the right thing to do. 
Please don't! 
It ain't broke, don't fix it. 
Entities (and NCRs) are useful for 1) inputting characters not accessible from the keyboard and 2) expressing characters not representable in the document encoding. 
Neither is the case here, so no change is necessary or advisable. 
The document's character encoding is meant to express the document's characters, please (continue to) use it. 
It would be nice, though, if Amaya could display a distinctive glyph for NBSP when in editing mode, like MS-Word does for instance. 
This is irrespective of what it exports to disk.
