<s> Some quick early observations on Mac OS X: Mozilla 1.3b: Eventual complain about staff.xml.html not being found ( I believe on L1 HTML).  </s>
<s> I suspect this is a general error where the load directive included an extension.  </s>

<s> Get complain that file:///file:/localhost... can't be loaded.  </s>
<s> Slightly better from http, but still times out reading test page.  </s>
<s> Safari will time out reading test page.  </s>
<s> I haven't gotten either Safari or Konqueror 3.1 to pass the jsUnit 1.3.3 self tests.  </s>

<s> I will submit a patch to Edward as soon as I look into some other issues.  </s>
<s> Opera 7.x is not supported.  </s>
<s> More work needs to be done to determine if it is possible to support Opera 7 in it's current implementation.  </s>
<s> I believe that recent security changes to Opera 7.01 may preclude it's support even if the other issues in Opera 7.00 are resolved.  </s>
<s> IE will fail all native implementation tests for text/xml and application/xhtml+xml content.  </s>
<s> This is due to IE's failure to natively support raw text/xml or application/xhtml+xml content types.  </s>
<s> IE will fail all MSXML implementation tests for application/xhtml+xml even though the content is valid XML due to it's lack of support for application/xhtml+xml.  </s>
<s> Although you can select text/html or application/xhtml+xml for the DOM Level 1 Core tests, there is not a corresponding html or xhtml document available for each XML data file.  </s>
<s> There are hc_staff.html,  </s>
<s> hc_staff.xhtml  </s>
<s> files however these do not appear to be properly a part of the DOM Level 1 Core.  </s>
<s> I would like to inquire as to whether the hc_staff tests belong in DOM Level 1 Core.  </s>
<s> Several HTML tests are subject to case sensitivity issues which cause failures when run as text/xml or application/xhtml+xml.  </s>
<s> The lack of full specification of the implementation attributes for each test makes it unclear to me what the default implementation attribute values are for the "undefined" cases.  </s>

<s> Running the DOM Test Suites Test results may depend upon cache settings.  </s>
<s> You may or may not wish to disable Java for the duration of the tests.  </s>
<s> Internet Explorer will need the MSXML 3 or MSXML 4 Active X controls (for XML) and Adobe SVG plug-in (for SVG) installed and have Active X enabled in the security zone where you have hosted the tests.  </s>

<s> 1. Open the index.html  </s>
<s> file in the build/ directory.  </s>
<s> 2. Click on the Test Suite you wish to run: i.e. DOM Core Level 1, DOM HTML Level 1, DOM Core Level 2, or DOM HTML Level 2. 3. Select an implementation to test.  </s>
<s> Mozilla/Netscape 7 support the Native implementation for all tests and content types.  </s>
<s> Internet Explorer supports Native, MSXML3, MSXML4 (if installed) and Adobe SVG plug-in (if installed).  </s>
<s> 4. Select the Test Implementation Attributes.  </s>
<s> Several tests contain implementation attributes which specify the qualities of parser which is required in order to properly parse the data document.  </s>
<s> You can select matching tests by choosing "Any" which will match any setting of the particular implementation attribute "undefined" which will only match tests which do not have the specific implementation attribute set "true" which will only match tests which have the specific implementation attribute set to true "false" which will only match tests which have the specific implementation attribute set to false.  </s>
<s> Currently, only Internet Explorer MSXML implementations support setting the parser to validating and ignoringElementContentWhitespace.  </s>
<s> Tests which do not meet the specified implementation attributes you select will be skipped and will be reported using JsUnit's tracing warn facility.  </s>
<s> 5. Select the Content Type to be used for selecting data files to be loaded.  </s>
<s> For DOM Core 1 and DOM Core 2 supported content types are text/xml and image/svg+xml.  </s>
<s> For DOM HTML 1 and DOM HTML 2 supported content types are text/xml, application/xhtml+xml and text/html.  </s>
<s> Tests which require files which do not exist in the requested content type will be skipped and will be reported using JsUnit's tracing warn facility.  </s>
<s> (except for xhtml in the DOM Level 1 Core).  </s>
<s> 6. Select either the full set of tests or a single individual test and click the Initialize JsUnit button.  </s>
<s> 7. In the window which opens with JsUnit, click Run.  </s>
<s> Implementation Details The basic changes required were to DOMTestCase.js, test-to-ecmascript.xsl and test-to-jsunit.xsl.  </s>
<s> Minor changes were also made to build.xml in order to copy the temporary versions of some of the files.  </s>
<s> The *alltests.xml are not used and are instead replaced with a JavaScript file which contains information on all tests, the files used and the specified implementation attributes.  </s>
<s> This script is used to generate the list of tests in each do-tests.html  </s>
<s> file and is used to populate the JsUnit suite for the new-alltests.html  </s>
<s> file.  </s>
<s> The different types (html, xml, svg) alltests files are no longer required since selection of content type is handled via the user.  </s>
<s> The current versions of the alltests.js  </s>
<s> files were constructed manually however would be best generated as a result of an XSL transform.  </s>
<s> Conclusion I believe this approach fulfills the promise of a browser agnostic test suite which all manufacturers have an equal chance of supporting.  </s>

<s> I haven't had a chance to run the protoype yet, but there is one outstanding issue:  </s>

<s> I won't have any time to fully digest this till the weekend, but here are a few quick comments/questions.  </s>
<s> Is the essential innovation the use of the query string used to launch JsUnit to configure the test framework?  </s>
<s> Are there any other novel aspects?  </s>
<s> Would there be any issues using a select box instead of radio buttons to select the suite or test to run?  </s>
<s> The recently generated tests have had an iframe element in the test html file for each document loaded by the test.  </s>
<s> As far as I can tell, your "native" loading uses the one iframe in main-loader.html  </s>
<s> and would not support tests that use multiple documents such as elementwrongdocumenterr.  </s>
<s> Is there an issue with distinct iframe 's in the test document?  </s>
<s> You mentioned the hc_* variant tests.  </s>
<s> These were added after first release of DOM L1 Core to provide some coverage of the Core for HTML processors since the original NIST tests required XML documents.  </s>
<s> The tests are a direct transliteration of the NIST types making tag and attribute name substitutions to make the test documents valid (but non-sensical) XHTML and HTML.  </s>
<s> XML processors show the same results with these translated tests as with the original tests.  </s>
<s> However, there has not been a thorough review by the team of test failures by XHTML or HTML processors.  </s>
<s> There are at least 4 hc_* tests that attempt to create elements that have not been changed to use HTML tag names which I'll try to change in the next few days.  </s>
<s> Ah, thanks.  </s>
<s> Sticky tag strikes again.  </s>
<s> :-) I have updated the version I am using to match the 1.17 version in DOMTestCase.js and will post a new version and report the results shortly.  </s>
<s> The query string is one of the basic ingredients which supports implementation choice, content type choice, implementation attribute choice and test choice but there are others as well.  </s>
<s> The use of a javascript file to generate the list of tests in the selection page and in the new-alltests.html  </s>
<s> suite.  </s>
<s> This eliminates the need for the *alltests.xml  </s>
<s> suite definitions and the *alltests.xml-  </s>
<s> *alltests.html  </s>
<s> transformation but requires a different transformation to create the javascript file.  </s>
<s> If this approach is approved I would like to work with you to determine the best approach for implementing it.  </s>
<s> This javascript file and it's recorded tests, their files and implementation attributes provides the ability to determine, test and filter tests by content type and implementation attribute.  </s>
<s> The use of warn to record when an implementation does not match the implementation attribute requirements of a test or the implementation attributes selected by the user.  </s>
<s> I think the trace facilities in JsUnit can be put more to use in reporting more information regarding the tests and their results.  </s>
<s> The addition of .xhtml  </s>
<s> versions of the XHTML data files and the use of application/xhtml+xml content type for http based test scenarios.  </s>
<s> None what so ever.  </s>
<s> This is just a prototype to show the basic functionality.  </s>
<s> I am open to whatever changes in the UI are desired.  </s>
<s> The list of tests is generated via a javascript document.write  </s>
<s> loop over the test data structures contained in the javascript file and is easily modified.  </s>
<s> In particular I think more work in implementation attribute definition, selection and matching will be required.  </s>
<s> The approach I used in the prototype was simply to illustrate it's potential.  </s>
<s> The iframe in main-loader.html is not used to load the data files in native mode.  </s>
<s> In native mode, the data files are loaded via iframes which are generated during the loading of the test via document.write.  </s>
<s> There is no limit to the number of loaded documents using this approach.  </s>
<s> Your use of the the variable name for each document allowed me to name each iframe separately from the actual file name and removed the limitation I originally had last year of having unique file names.  </s>
<s> The issue I have with the xslt automatically creating the iframes is that only the native loader requires iframes and they are not needed for MSXML[3|4] or Adobe SVG implementations.  </s>
<s> I believe this is better handled during load via document.write.  </s>
<s> It seemed to me that, in the current version in CVS the older "Builder" code is still in the file, but it appeared to have been orphaned and replaced by the IFRAME loader which was limited to loading HTML in the iframes.  </s>
<s> The issue I have with the hc_* tests is that they don't follow the normal scheme and would make the determination of supported content types for a file more complicated, but not impossible.  </s>
<s> They seemed to be a "bit of a wart", and if possible I was hoping to not have to special case the supported content type determination for files.  </s>
<s> The alltests could be generated from a directory using Ant.  </s>
<s> However, the original idea behind the test suite definitions was that tests would go through a review cycle and there could be tests in the directory that were submitted but not accepted.  </s>
<s> alltests was going to contain all tests regardless of status and there would be other suites of accepted, provisional and rejected tests, however that never evolved.  </s>
<s> The downside of moving a test to signify rejection was that any test results that used that URL would be broken.  </s>
<s> I think I would prefer a more declarative approach, maybe an array containing with elements like: tests[tests.length]  </s>
<s> = { "characterdatainsertdatanomodificationallowederr", // test name null, // content type { "XML" }, { null }, // features name and versions { "expandEntityReferences" }, { false } }; // impl attributes The function suite() method could iterate through the array and add only the applicable tests to the suite.  </s>
<s> The Java framework does not give any indication that non-applicable tests are omitted.  </s>
<s> If you want to avoid the situation of a processor passing, for example, the L3 Load Save suite because it passed 0 of 0 tests by return false to hasFeature("LS-Load", null), you can always have one unguarded test that checks the feature.  </s>
<s> I think that listing page after page of inappropriate tests could be distracting.  </s>
<s> I'll also application/xhtml+xml to the contentType enumeration in the schemas and DTDs.  </s>
<s> I avoided dynamically created the IFRAME's since I thought it was one less moving part and the cost of an unused IFRAME was negligable.  </s>
<s> When I migrated the previous code to JSUnit 1.3.3,  </s>
<s> I retrogressed in functionality and temporarily dropped support for the other loaders, but I expected to reimplement additional loaders as we added back functionality.  </s>
<s> I prefer the loader classes over extensive use of switch statements to achieve the same thing.  </s>
<s> For XML processors, they are essentially redundant with the non hc_ (for HTML compatible) tests.  </s>
<s> However, without them there is minimal coverage of L1 core behavior for HTML processors.  </s>
<s> Ok. I understand that alltests.xml should stay.  </s>
<s> The output should instead be the reusable javascript file containing the tests information rather than the current *alltests.html  </s>
<s> suites.  </s>
<s> Whether declarative or procedural it should be easy to read and to use.  </s>
<s> If declarative is desired then an initializer such as: tests[tests.length]  </s>
<s> = { name: 'characterdatainsertdatanomodificationallowederr', doc: 'staff', implementationAttributes: { expandEntityReferences: 'false' }, validating: 'false' is preferred due to it's readability and ease of use.  </s>
<s> I prefer a constructor and either procedural initialization or initialization by the constructor over an array based initializer list for several reasons: 1. it is more readable 2. it is more usable in the code, e.g. objectName.propertyName  </s>
<s> == value rather than nameArray[indexValue] == valueArray[indexValue] 3. it provides a definitely initialized object with which to work.  </s>
<s> I think that the test suite should allow the user to select the level of information that they desire if it can be supported.  </s>
<s> I believe use of warn or info or the other levels of trace in JsUnit can be appropriately used without providing "page after page" of warnings.  </s>
<s> The appropriate choice of what is or is not in the base/default set of tests and which do not rely upon optional parser features can reduce the warnings except in the case where the user wishes to investigate the use of the additional features.  </s>
<s> It also forced loads of unnecessary documents, caused 404's in web logs, and was restricted to choosing the mime type at build time if I recall correctly.  </s>
<s> In the version I proposed in May 2002, I retained the use of builder classes although for the most part they were skeletons compared to the original implementation dependent classes which were in use at the time.  </s>
<s> I didn't use build classes in this prototype since only a limited IFRAME builder was used in the CVS version and it was used in such a way that hard wired it's use into the tests.  </s>
<s> Currently, the only relevant switches are the two DOMTS_USER_IMPLEMENTATION switches controlled by the user.  </s>
<s> One of which is used to initiate the creation of the objects which will load the test documents and the other to control IE specific features only.  </s>
<s> This isn't Object Oriented but is easily maintainable and extendible.  </s>
<s> I have no objection to using builder classes however think we should make certain that: 1. user choice guides the selection of features used, not the builder 2. using builders should not make it difficult to add new implementations.  </s>
<s> 3. builders should only be used to make implementing the tests easier but not to hide results due to implementation differences in the browsers being tested.  </s>
<s> Ok.  </s>
