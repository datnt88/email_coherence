<s> Hi Steve, It was a pleasure to meet you at the TechPlenary.  </s>
<s> This is a ping just to start the conversation between the WS coordination group and the I18N WG, Web Services Task Force.  </s>
<s> We've been hard at work on Usage Scenarios and Requirements documents, which we hope to advance to Note status soon.  </s>
<s> Some of our work is likely to serve as the basis of future i18n work on Web services or infrastructure that impacts Web services.  </s>
<s> As we discussed, sometime in the near future I'd like to do a presentation of our work, findings, and plans to the coordination group.  </s>
<s> Let me know how you'd like to proceed.  </s>
<s> Best Regards, Addison Addison P. Phillips Director, Globalization Architecture webMethods | Delivering Global Business Visibility Chair, W3C Internationalization (I18N) Working Group Chair, W3C-I18N-WG, Web Services Task Force Internationalization is an architecture.  </s>
<s> It is not a feature.  </s>
<s> Addison, I have been swamped with work lately (since the Plenary).  </s>
<s> I'm on holiday now but I would like to schedule a time to talk about how to move on i18N with the Web Services Coordination call.  </s>
<s> Perhaps one way to do this is to invite you to address the chair on that call with a call to arms.  </s>
<s> Anyway let me know when you are free to talk.  </s>
<s> I'm back next week.  </s>

<s> Hi Steve, That's great.  </s>
<s> I know that we'd love to have the opportunity to address the WSCG.  </s>
<s> I'm not sure of the timing.  </s>
<s> Personally, I'll be travelling Monday/Tuesday of this coming week, but that isn't necessarily an impediment to our discussing timing and other details.  </s>
<s> Under separate cover I'm sending you my contact information (I don't really want my phone numbers archived....) I hope you are enjoying your holiday.  </s>
<s> We'll chat soon.  </s>
