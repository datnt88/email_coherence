<s> There is a new version of the guidelines at We are posting this to IG for your review.  </s>
<s> The working group GL has hammered it into this form over the past few weeks.  </s>
<s> We think it is much better than the current public version on TR and are thinking of posting this version to TR as soon as possible - so that when people hear about the guidelines at WWW7 they will find this version on the technical reports page TR instead of the old February version.  </s>
<s> So give it a look see and let us know if you see anything that is a problem.  </s>
<s> Or if you think we should post this one out there instead of the Feb version for the WWW7 attendees to view.  </s>

<s> Hi Richard, Good comments.  </s>
<s> Take a look at the new guidelines we just posted at latest bobby, it was based on the February draft guidelines.  </s>
<s> We have made a number of improvements since then which may address your concerns.  </s>
<s> Also, could you let us know which parts of the guidelines you have problems with?  </s>
<s> For example, what were the three errors that you got when you ran bobby?  </s>
<s> It is very helpful to know where the problems are.  </s>
<s> I'm glad to see you are designing the site so it won't need be needed.  </s>
<s> That is the intention of the guidelines.  </s>
<s> In fact the guidelines now state that a text page should only be used if you cannot figure out any other way to make a page accessible.  </s>
<s> Finally, you suggest that more work should be put on the browser manufacturers.  </s>
<s> Jon G's group is doing that right now.  </s>
<s> I think they will be posting a set of browser guidelines soon.  </s>
<s> The page author guidelines are also designed to move as much off the page writer and onto the browser and screen reader as possible....  </s>
<s> As soon as the browsers adopt the newly recommended features.  </s>
<s> Again, if you have any ideas in regard to things that browsers should do better, either post them here or directly to the ua group at w3c-wai-ua@w3.org Gregg Gregg C Vanderheiden Ph.D. Professor - Human Factors Dept of Ind.  </s>

<s> What is the URL for your web page that Bobby now frowns on?  </s>
<s> Al Gilman  </s>
<s> Yowsa.  </s>
<s> In what way?  </s>
<s> Are you objecting to Bobby's implemenation of the Guidelines (which are the older ones, not the new ones), or to something specific in the Guidelines you don't like, or just to the idea of author guidelines in the first place?  </s>
<s> Aren't there credits and an explanation of where the Guidelines come from on the Guidelines themselves?  </s>
<s> Why not?  </s>
<s> Give some reasons besides "they suck" and "I don't like it", and it's likely that your concerns may be addressed in a later version.  </s>
<s> You may feel that -- but you're completely wrong.  </s>
<s> The web author _has_ to supply enough information for the browser to display information, or else it simply _can't_ make a page accessible.  </s>
<s> For example, if I have a page that looks like this: ...there's simply no way that any browser, no matter how smart, can display this in a way that will be as accessible to a blind user as to a sighted one.  </s>
<s> No way, no how -- and it's the fault of the page designer, not the browser.  </s>
<s> If I said, instead: A HREF="lft.html" TITLE="Left Wing Rhetoric Page"  </s>
<s> IMG SRC="lft40ns.gif" ALT="The Far Left" /A  </s>
<s> A HREF="rit.html" TITLE="Right Wing Rhetoric Page"  </s>
<s> IMG SRC="rit40ns.gif" ALT="The Far Right" /A  </s>
<s> ...then anyone can understand it, even by reading the "raw HTML".  </s>
<s> (Note that in the hypothetical example above, the images would consist of fancy graphical versions of the text above, perhaps with big arrows pointing in different directions, or whatever.) So, you may be pissed that you don't get a high enough Bobby rating, and I understand that and welcome your feedback on the Guidelines, but you're way, way, WAY off base if you think that accessibility is primarily a _browser_ issue and not an authoring issue.  </s>

<s> I won't say that my sites are perfectly accessible.  </s>
<s> I have never checked them with Bobby.  </s>
<s> I have taken accessibility into heavy consideration while writing.  </s>
<s> I suspect that the guidelines have caused your pages to have errors for good reason, though.  </s>
<s> If the pages are not broken and there is a problem with the guidelines then it should be stated what the problem is.  </s>
<s> In my experience, a text version is never needed when you adhere to the recommendations.  </s>
<s> HTML is perfectly capable of rendering as text-only when you use it well.  </s>
<s> Lynx is a good test.  </s>
<s> It renders HTML as a good text-based UA should.  </s>
<s> You follow the specs and guidelines, the browser folks follow the specs and guidelines then it will work every time.  </s>
<s> Either one of you stray and it breaks in ways you rarely predict.  </s>
<s> It is everyone's responsibility to make sure the web is accessible.  </s>
<s> I will say that some of the browser folks are not doing the best job in fostering accessibility.  </s>
<s> The web writers are not innocent, though.  </s>
<s> Writing bad HTML documents is just as big of a problem as writing a bad HTML interpreter.  </s>
<s> There are millions of people writing bad HTML.  </s>
<s> There are only a few people writing bad browsers.  </s>
<s> Here is a simple browser accessibility problem with the big browsers.  </s>
<s> Why don't images render as the alt text when the images are disabled or unavailable?  </s>
<s> They render as an empty box with microscopic little text in one corner.  </s>
<s> An image inside of a heading, on Lynx, renders the alt text as if it were plain text within a heading.  </s>
<s> Is this not something that would be logical?  </s>
<s> At least as an accessibility option.  </s>
<s> And, why do so many people misuse or not use the alt text?  </s>
<s> How many people have you seen put "Hey stupid, turn on your images so you can see them" as the alt text?  </s>
<s> Tell me that isn't the author's responsibility.  </s>
