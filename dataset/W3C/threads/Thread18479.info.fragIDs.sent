I would like the working group to carefully consider raising checkpoint 3.6 and 3.7 to P1 based on last call issue 454 [1]. 
It seems that if the user agent is automatically changing content and the user cannot control the changes the user would not have access to content in some cases. 
These checkpoints were a P3 requirement in our previous last call and raised to P2 last spring. 
We now have a request and it seems reasonable to make this a P1 requirement. 
I would like working group input on this issue. 
Please send previous rationalizations for the P2 and P3 of the past or your support for making this a P1 requirement. 
Thanks,

Jon, It would certainly appear that if a user agent is changing the content is some unprompted fashion (presumably time dependent), then the information would be inaccessible to a person who requires extra time to absorb the information. 
Since this makes that content impossible to access, that would 
make these P1 issues.

AG:: On the other hand, does the user have the ability to go back after a pushed change in the content? 
It is also possible to argue for P2 on the grounds that extracting the information becomes quite hard, but not flat out impossible. 
Al PS: I am afraid this issue throws me back into a tailspin about the interpretation of the priority levels. 
This is a case where it is not clear that the distinctions used in the WCAG are the right sort of policy breakpoints for a User Agent guide. 
I really think that User Agents SHOULD _all_ provide the user with this kind of control. 
The only problem I see here is in using language to explain why that User Agent developers will take as objective and reasonable.

Al, I thought about the back button as a way around this, but if the change is time dependent, it will likely forward again before the user can access the information. 
The only time this wouldn't happen would be if you could orient and begin reading from where you left off before the change, and I'm not sure that the technology would necessarily allow that.
