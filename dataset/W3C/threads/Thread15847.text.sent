ALL INTERNET CUSTOMERS WILL RECEIVE A FREE TIRE ROTATION JUST FOR COMING IN. 
We look forward to hearing from you! 
I would appreciate it if you would not send advertisements through the W3C mailing list. 
Using the mailing list as a means of cheap advertising defeats the purpose of having a subject-based discussion group. 
Thanks--I hope that others share my feelings on this matter.
