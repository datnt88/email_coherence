<s> One of the things that has come out of our discussions with I18N has, I think, been that we better understand the relationship between sequences of characters and markup.  </s>
<s> Whilst I18N did not specifically point out this flaw in the current syntax spec, I think it should be attributed to their input.  </s>
<s> Consider the test case: If my reading of the syntax document [1] is correct, it states that this is equivalent to (with a little license in the syntax):  </s>

<s> I believe that should read _:a eg:prop " em br / /em ^^ rdf:XMLLiteral .  </s>
<s> or some variation on that theme, to preserve the distinction between markup and content.  </s>
<s> We need to decide exactly what characters get escaped.  </s>

<s> I'm not sure what is the problem, it's clear to me and I don't know where such a relationship needs further explaining.  </s>
<s> We defer on XML matters to where it belongs - XML specifications (XML, Namespaces in XML, Exclusive XML Canoncialization) and to some degree, Charmod (although not normatively since that's still a WD).  </s>
<s> No.  </s>
<s> That string is entirely defined by Exclusive XML Canonicalization text (with comments) which is linked directly from [1] and since that normatively uses Canonical XML, which says: "Special characters in attribute values and character content are replaced by character references" -- http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-xml-c14n-20010315#Terminology and in detail: [[Text Nodes- the string value, except all ampersands are replaced by &amp;amp;, all open angle brackets ( ) are replaced by , all closing angle brackets ( ) are replaced by , and all #xD characters are replaced by &amp;#xD;.]]  </s>

<s> This is then overridden by The string used as the lexical form of the XML Literal is the Exclusive XML Canonicalization [XML-XC14N]) with comments and with empty InclusiveNamespaces PrefixList of the literal text l, i.e. the entire element content of this property element.  </s>

<s> Hello Brian, I agree with your comment below, as amended by Dave Beckett.  </s>
<s> The current version of the test case is definitely wrong.  </s>
<s> It may be a good idea to make sure that the primer clearly explains the difference between text with markup and text that may look like markup.  </s>
<s> Given the mess that some of the usage communities have made out of this (e.g. RSS), I think this is extremely important.  </s>
