<s> The same substantive change can be made in a more manageable way by: - changing the defn of RDF URI Reference in Concepts to point to namespaces IRI - *not* do the s/URIref/IRI/ This makes it clear that we are trying to play the XML ball, with less textual change.  </s>

<s> I couldn't find any reference to such a change in the 3rd IRI internet draft linked from the i18n resources area http://www.w3.org/International/iri-edit/ in Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRIs), draft-duerst-iri-03 March 2, 2003 Dave  </s>
<s> Sorry unclear again .. :(  </s>
<s> No - the I18N lot decided that IRIs which are not in NFC are OK.  </s>
<s> So the namespaces 1.1 defn of IRI which does not mention NFC is closer to I18N's ideal than my text which does.  </s>

<s> I would be *very* wary about adopting the term IRI at this time.  </s>
<s> I was at the IETF URI BOF last week, and there was some discussion of the IRI spec.  </s>
<s> Minutes at: One issue in particular that is not currently clear regarding IRIs is the status of certain US-ASCII characters not allowed in URIs: ( ,  , ", SPACE, {, }, |, \, ^, `) are not allowed in URIs; in the current draft, they are allowed in IRIs.  </s>

<s> Available at I would say that this doesn't have a cat-in-hell's chance of being on the IETF standards track by the time (we hope) RDFcore goes to recommendation track.  </s>
<s> Hmmm... there's also http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-names11/#IRIs, but I don't think I'd know exactly how to include an IRI containing (say) ' ' in an RDF document based on that specification.  </s>
<s> My conclusion: this whole area is very messy at present, and I'm not sure how we can be confident of getting any alignment with IRI's completely right.  </s>
<s> I'm inclined use some text of our own (possibly copy xml-names11 and clarify the use of "additional" characters), with a note that this may be replaced with a reference to a future IRI spec, rather than indirect through some transient specification in yet another document.  </s>
<s> I note that adopting the IRI per xml-names11 would require a change to N-triples, which has: absoluteURI ::= ( character - ( ' ' | ' ' | space ) )+ -- http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/ntriples/#absoluteURI #g  </s>
