Matt May Introduction to WCAG 2.0 
WL Looked good last time I read it. 
JW Last year we noted that assumptions re: user agents, authors, users, and assistive technologies should be documented. 
KHS Know where to steal it from - stuff that Judy did. 
Also, nice piece in UAAG1.0 WC Point to or summarize? 
Don't want to duplicate. 
Action KHS: help finish introduction - link to info about assumptions and info from EO work and UAAG1.0. 
Plan to have something to the group by next week. 
Bidirectional languages WCAG 2.0 Issue #11 WC More than a bidirectional issue, I've heard it said about HTML tables for layout in general. 
JW Regardless, goes to HTML techniques group, does not go to the higher level. 
WC Process then is that subgroup takes action, sends proposal to WG once decided. 
JW Yes, subgroup gets assigned open issue, up to them to resolve. 
best to do it in context of techniques document. 
Resolved: process for sending open issues to techniques subgroups: subgroup gets assigned open issue, up to them to resolve. 
best to do it in context of techniques document. 
editor of the techniques doc takes the action item. 
Action MM: resolve issue of absolute units for table layout within the HTML techniques. 
Server-side issues WL It could be a glossary rathole. 
Equivalents, even at fundamental level, has spawned huge thread about alt-text and what does equivalent mean for that. 
JW We need to make sure it doesn't go on forever. 
WL Depends on what equivalent is equivalent to. 
CS Something along the lines of: you should be able to accomplish the same task in about the same amount of time. 
If the task is, "read content" then using a different version you should be able to get the content. 
If downloading a pen, or buying a pen...you should be able to do these things in any of the versions. 
PB I have developed a system where you take database content and put into different templates. 
You're talking about the content itself, which is different. 
e.g. you have a graphical version and one that replaces graphics with text. 
The content doesn't change. 
YOu are talking about changing the content. 
CS Talking about both. 
JW Continuim between changing structure, content, and just presentation. 
If you remove all audio files and does not show that were there, then disagreement. 
CS Len mentioned idea of "essential purpose." Can you accomplish what the site is intended to accomplish. 
A simplified version of text might do in some cases, not in others. 
WC Where is UAAG at on this? 
GR Idea of "conditional content." 
Incorporates switch, alt, title, longdesc. 
Wrestling with how do you alert user that there is conditional content and does it need to be synchronized. 
Want to step through conditional content. 
Can configure order to step through or to step through at all. 
UAAG does not address "what can you do with what is served to you." WC Assumes no processing on server-side and that all info passed to the client. 
GR Since UAAG 1.0 does not deal with server-side. 
Encourage you to raise it as an issue with UA WG. Probably end up on open issues for UAAG 2.0. 
JW Some people who would say that they have the right to know that the conditional content is there. 
others don't care. 
CS Others confused or harmed by it in some way. 
JW Certainly, a divide of opinion. 
CS Fair amount of work in limiting choices to make interface easier to use. 
JW We need to decide what are the criteria for determining if content is equivalent. 
e.g. provide text equivalents in every version or providing only in one. 
CS There will be cases where that has to happen. 
e.g., the wap or any thin client case where you optimize for a small device. 
you have to leave some things out. 
There is an argument to be made for optimized versions. 
My opinion - as long as you can switch and that the version w/alternatives is equivalent (a diff. 
conversation). 
PB Common that the main version should have WCAG 1.0 A conformance. 
CS Assuming that there is a main version. 
GR Just b/c serve something, assume 99% use all senses together, no reason not to include accessibility features that are built into the language. 
Can't assume that someone can access a proxy. 
If serving images have to serve conditional context. 
CS Unless the user says that they don't want alt-text. 
GR Should be done through something like CC/PP. 
CS Or some cookie-based mechanism or whatever. 
Could definitely be abused, but don't make it against the rules if it can be done well. 
WC We need to document those assumptions. 
Gets back to baseline discussion that is not resolved. 
JW To be resolved at the technology level. 
CS Many of these things will be covered in the server-side techniques. 
JW When do two versions count as equivalents? 
If there is a clear task to be performed with the content, then one can use that as the criteria, ala Cynthia's proposal. 
It can get complicated if you want you want to use it for is different from what the creator intended. 
Or if there is not a clear purpose. 
Then, perhaps a rewrite is necessary. 
Also raised in relation to cognitive discussions a few weeks ago. 
PB Where in the guidelines do we reference server-side? 
CS There will be server-side techniques. 
I believe there should be some normative aspects in this document. 
PB There are things that shouldn't apply to every page. 
JW Statement of conformance requirements. 
WC Also hooks to server-side techniques from various checkpoints. 
What about making some of the checkpoint solutions normative, as cynthia suggested? 
JW We'll figure that out when we get there. 
CS It does sound like a conformance issue. 
Only when testing things does it become a concern. 
Not a guideline. 
WC Could someone take an action to document so that we can refer to this discussion later when we get to the point when we are focusing on conformance. 
WL How do we currently define content? 
CS Include tags or not. 
JW Refer to meaning rather than structure or presentation. 
KHS No definition in WCAG 2.0, UAAG "3 ways. 
..." @@link. 
JW Clear for UAAG purposes. 
Even tho used for multiple purposes can make contextual distinctions. 
WL How far back to we reach to find what the content is that we'll have guidelines for. 
Do we reach to the server? 
Do we go into the mind of the author? 
MM Already separate content from presentaiton. 
Do we tell people to present same content regardless of presentation. 
I have issue with using different verbiage for different audiences. 
As long as you say, "if you can present the same words and ideas on 2 different types of presentations, then we can consider that accessible." CS Can present same idea with different words. 
MM Yes, but 2 audiences who are drawing different conclusions. 
When you separate the idea from the words and communicate in different ways, people will absorb in different ways. 
CS I agree but if one group draws zero inferences, then how do you handle it? 
WL No translation versus bad translation problem. 
CS Adjusting things to reading levels. 
Common in educational material. 
e.g., 6th grade math leaves a lot out. 
Have to do that to move on. 
MM Also say write clearly and simply for your audience. 
Go too far if you have a technique that says, "if you take this and boil it down to a certain level - change wording, structure, etc. you make it inaccessible." 
You will leave things out. 
CS I don't want to see 2 things happen: 1 all content written to reading level X, 2 prevent people from providing content at a lower reading level. 
MM The issue is, if you say that a company can rewrite something in a lower level. 
When someone reads the reduced content and is only able to use that content, then reduced for all content. 
WC How do you see that happening? 
MM If someone has a laundry list, will apply it all to an "accessible version." 
WC I hear you saying that we have to be very careful about how we define the laundry list, but I do not think that we should avoid helping people make easy to read versions of content in fear that that will be only accessible version of content. 
JW In guidelines we don't actually deal with translation, closest to cognitive case. 
Translation is not always equivalent to the original. 
Whatever we decide to do, we should not try to stretch the term equivalent to cover both of them. 
CS The statement that you made about expressing different things to different audiences can apply to images and alt-text. 
GR Functional equivalents and contextual equivalents. 
JW An alt attribute is equivalent to image for purpose of understanding content, they are not equivalent. 
Could get info from one that can't get from the other. 
For the purpose of understanding, they are equivalent. 
GR Functional equivalent of image is alt, contextual is longdesc. 
Image serves a function in context of the page. 
The description of the image is a contextual thing. 
JW If I thought I could convey function of image in alt-text, not describe it. 
GR If I have a the W3C "valid HTML" image, alt-text would be "valid HTML." the function is, this content has been checked. 
in longdesc dcribe image. 
JW Always differentiated between function and description. 
JW Back to issue, cognitive equivalents seems to be stickiest aspect. 
My feeling is to treat more as translation rather than equivalent. 
GR It is an alternative not equivalent. 
WL Not congruent. 
JW If use Cynthia's definition, in some cases count as equivalents sometimes not. 
GR Function of image is to show has been validated. 
That it is a hyperlink, belongs to link not image. 
WL Important to have "reasonable" and "where appropriate" is important. 
JW We seem to agree that functional equivalence is the ultimate criteria. 
Separately, have translations or rewrites for cognitive purposes where the same function might not be fulfilled but it may partially overlap. 
CS There are cases where the goal is to "buy a pencil" rather than "convey info" that you can simplify user interface and language so that person with CD/LD can use it. 
MM That falls under write simpley and clearly. 
CS May not sell as many pencils without the pretty words. 
Resolved (at least for today): criteria for determining equivalency is based on purpose and task. 
caveat: translations - purpose may be to gain full meaning of text. 
where that is the purpose, simplifying text is not equivalent. 
Action MM: think about this resolution and respond. 
JW suspect that with right qualifications we can make this definition work. 
PB Server-side ideas and conformance: if we are going to have a caveat that if served out on some page some where in an accessible form, then can call the site rather than the page accessible. 
CS Don't think we've quite reached agreement. 
I will draft server-side techniques in next couple weeks, that will help. 
Does that work for everyone? 
JW Yes, gets down to conformance and priority issues. 
We decided not to discuss until had substantially complete draft of the 3 levels of the document. 
KHS Please look at the PDF techniques. 
Not sure which techniques fit under which checkpoints. 
Action everyone: review PDF techniques. 
Resolved: PDF techniques on the agenda for next week. 
KHS says, "ignore the numbers and think about which checkpoints they fit under." 
Some feel like they can fit under more than one checkpoint.

Even though I didn't verbally say that I wanted to take on the action item of looking at the introduction during the conference call, I decided to do it anyway. 
While looking through it, my main overall impression was that what is written really isn't an introduction to the document, but it is an introduction to the 4 main principles of the guidelines. 
I feel that there needs to be an introduction to the document as a whole. 
With that in mind, I went ahead and drafted one. 
My draft ends at the point where I feel that Wendy's introduction should begin. 
So I haven't replaced what she has done, but I have added some preliminary information. 
Not all of the information in my draft is information that has been agreed upon. 
I threw in a few of my own ideas, but I made highlighted "Author's Notes" next to the areas that are sure to be more controversial. 
The elements of controversy are mainly in the compliance section, which we aren't dealing with yet, so I guess the controversial ideas can be ignored for now. 
Right now I just want to throw out my introduction as a possible method of introducing the WCAG 2.0 document as a whole. 
My introduction can be accessed at http://www.webaim.org/wcag/intro. 
Note: The links in my draft are not functional. 
They're just there as place-holders. 
In short, here is the outline that I have come up with, minus the paragraphs of text (note: this outline is an "alternative" and not an "equivalent" representation of what I did smile , so I encourage you to read the full document): 1. Introduction 1.1 The Purpose of These Guidelines 1.2 Who Benefits from These Guidelines? 
1.3 The Broad Nature of These Guidelines 1.4 Limitations of These Guidelines 1.5 Determining Compliance with These Guidelines 1.6 The Four Main Principles of These Guidelines 1.6.1 Presentation 1.6.2 Interaction 1.6.3 Comprehension 1.6.4 Technology considerations Paul Bohman Technology Coordinator WebAIM: Web Accessibility in Mind (www.webaim.org)

Paul's introduction is an excellent starting point for further work, and also draws appropriately on the introduction to WCAG 1.0. 
Some of the details will doubtless be clarified as issues confronting the working group are resolved. 
This is a summary of the conversation between Paul Bohman and Adam Victor Reed that was held off-line: PB: My introduction (to WCAG 2.0) can be accessed at AVR: You may want to fix the following. 
Please let me know if you disagree - 1.2: "cognitive impairments" is too narrow. 
I suggest "processing impairments", so that attention deficits are included. 
PB: I understand what you're saying, but I wonder if there isn't a more understandable way of saying it. 
"Mental processing impairment" maybe? 
"Cognitive processing impairments"? 
And, to my way of thinking, although I'm sure others would disagree, attention deficits can be included under the term "cognitive", even without the word "processing." 
The act of processing information is a cognitive act, isn't it? 
Even if the word "cognitive" seems slanted away from attention deficits, I think that the word "processing" slants too far towards it and away from other types. 
AVR: The use of the same word - in this case "cognitive" - for both a category and a sub-category within it - inevitably confuses the reader into conflating the category with the sub-category. 
I don't insist on "processing", but in practice, when content-makers are asked to address "cognitve impairments", they almost always do it in ways that actually make their content _less_ accessible to people with attention deficits. 
PB: I'm not opposed to coming up with a better title for this category. 
I'm just not sure what that would be. 
AVR: After the third sentence in the paragraph below the list, add: "Processing impairments include limitations in learning, cognition and attention". 
PB: I think a sentence such as this would be a good idea. 
In fact, it would be a good idea to add a few more examples under each category. 
AVR: Also, including only sensory deficits among examples of visual disabilities may be misleading - I would add limitations in visual perception and object agnosias. 
PB: I would tend to place visual perception and object agnosias in the cognitive/processing/mental category. 
Agnosias are usually the result of brain damage which doesn't necessarily affect sight capabilities. 
What is affected is the ability to process information that is precieved through sight. 
AVR: The effect, though, is that people with impairment of visual perception and visual agnosias can't use pictorial presentation of content. 
In addressing content accessibility it may make sense to group them with "visual impairments". 
PB: You may have a point there. 
Does anyone else have a comment on this one? 
AVR: 1.4: I would like to volunteer to add techniques documents for "attention deficits" and "impairments of visual perception". 
PB: I think that would be great. 
The list of disabilities/conditions is really almost infinite, but I think that documents for those disability types would be appropriate. 
AVR: 1.5: I would add the following after "Disability Type Specificity": Contextual Compliance Sites serving specific groups of individually identified users must meet detailed compliance criteria, as enumerated in the Optimization Techniques Documents, to assure accessibility for every identified user. 
For example, the web site of a university seminar must be accessible to all participants in the seminar. 
PB: I think this is a concept worth exploring too. 
My concern with any conditional statements, including my "Technology Type Specificity" and "Disability Type Specificity" are that they add another layer of complexity that has the potential of rendering the guidelines less usable. 
The more difficult it is to understand or comply with the guidelines, the more backlash we can expect, and the more difficult it is to convince anyone to use them. 
I do agree that these conditional statements make the guidelines more accurate. 
I always advocate for accuracy, but there is a point at which simplicity needs to take preference over specificity. 
At some point we'll have to draw that line.

Paul, This is a good intro. 
I've read it through once and would like to spend more time with it. 
great work! 
I like the "who benefits" and "techniques". 
Issues that you raise that the group ought to discuss: 1. Disability Type Specificity (in section 1.5) 2. The appropriate phrase to address cognitive disabilities. 
From what people have told me, it is to use cognitive and learning disabilities as two categories. 
Other terms: developmental disabilities, intellectual disabilities, writing disabilities, etc. 
However, I've just been using the CD/LD split to address all of these. 
3. Optimization Techniques Documents (section 1.4) 4. Seizure disabilities (re author's note in section 1.2) --wendy 
wendy a chisholm world wide web consortium web accessibility initiative seattle, wa usa 
Paul and Victor: I encourage this type of off-list work that is well documented. 
Particularly if you can highlight the main point of discussion and resolution. 
Thank you very much for documenting this so well and sending it to the list!

At some point we'll have to draw that line. 
CS: We've been talking, on and off, about creating a database of checkpoints and/or techniques so that an author could filter on the pieces s/he cares about. 
So, you'd be able to get a list of checkpoints and techniques that are relevant if you're building a site in HTML with JavaScript targeted at persons with ADD (for example). 
IMHO, if we do this, the guidelines will become more usable and easier to understand, because a person trying to comply with them will only have to look the relevant pieces.
