Hello, I am part of a team that is creating a new program in Wisconsin, USA. 
The boiler plate information is... DAWN is a new grassroots, statewide network of people who care about disability issues. 
The DAWN will focus on issues affecting people with any kind of disability and will include people with disabilities, family members, friends, organizations and others. 
This network will allow people throughout the state to stay informed about important public policy issues and will give members of the network information to advocate for these issues. 
Part of this program will require sending emails to members referring them to specific Web pages. 
I am familiar with the Guidelines for the Web page 
authorship, but what about the emails? 
I am unclear as to whether to send text based email or html based email. 
What we would like is to have the email contain hyperlinks to Web site. 
If we send plain text messages, will hyperlinks be shown as such and will they work as such? 
And like the recent thread, we need to address the cognitively disabled as well, so html based email has some real advantages. 
If we send email in html should the style sheet be in-line or linked? 
Thanks for any help.

At the moment your attempts to send plain text are failing in my copy of Eudora Pro 4. It may be a Eudora bug but doing a 'reply' to your message loses all paragraphing, not just 72-80 character line breaks. 
The MIME backward-compatibility guideline is to put the plaintext morph of your message ahead of the first MIME part, not in the first MIME part. 
You should review the capabilities of MIME multipart/alternative and MHTML as you plan your usage. 
Warning: The WAI has not paid much attention to MIME applications as compared to HTTP applications using the same media. 
You should regard the WAI-interested as a good pool from which to find informative peers. 
Search with Google for "email accessibility" for more sources of useful information.

Hypothetically, WCAG should cover this case, but I fear it doesn't. 
Email is one of the best areas to offer _two_ (or more) versions of content: One in HTML, and one in plaintext. 
Users should be given the choice over which email format to receive. 
In general, "modern" email programs will highlight URIs as clickable links, so you can send links in plaintext without requiring markup. 
Older email programs will not do this, but they likewise will rarely display HTML either. 
(So they simply don't have the functionality to make clickable links.) Hope this helps.

You will generally find that all public mailing lists that have expressed an opinion (generally recently created ones) ban HTML emails. 
Generally, if the email reading program is capable of handling HTML, it will recognize apparent URLs in plain text email and display them as hyperlinks. 
Some specialist URLs may not get recognized, but all http ones should, and Outlook treats "www." as a URL marker. 
The official standard is to enclose URLs in  , e.g. http://www.w3.org/WAI/ , but this is so rarely done that I suspect that no email program treats this form of punctuation specially. 
The only real problem you have is with email programs that wrap text without allowing you control, e.g. the Office 97 version of Outllook. 
These can split long URLs. 
If there is any possible way of getting the style sheet installed on the browser (technically possible, but would require the help of someone who could comprehend the technology), you should do that rather than send one. 
That will allow a helper to customise the appearance of the document for the particular recipient. 
It will also help to force you to design the style sheet cognitively, although it won't prevent you from simply coding b as "color: red" when you should have been using 
strong class="cognitive-significance-of-text" " (or span if no standard 
element approximates the sense - should be rare). 
Except possibly for positioning controls, you should use exactly the same style sheet and classes every time, and preferably agree standards with other people addressing the same audience. 
For the longer term, if you find that there is an important core set of classes, you should be trying to get an XHTML module defined for those classes, to turn them into proper elements. 
(Note that incomplete support for CSS2 means that you may feel forced to use some presentational markup in the HTML.) You should not use links to style sheets as many people read email offline; in many places this is the cheapest way to do it. 
(Automatically actioned links from email can also be used for denial of service attacks, so may be vulnerable to security precautions.) 
I find it difficult to think of a context where a style sheet link would be appropriate but it would not be appropriate to make the body of the email a link to the text on a web page - a truly MIME compliant email program would allow you to actually make the body of email be that web page, but I don't know what level of commercial support exists - it would probably work with a properly configured Unix text mode mail program, but I'd have doubts about commercial GUI ones (this has denial of service and spamming possibilities which may restrict it to attachments). 
You should note that the HTML emails generated by most HTML email client users are congnitively very weak, sometimes using p to mean a newline which has no deep meaning at all, rather than a paragraph. 
If you target HTML emails for people with comprehension disabilities, you will almost certainly need to construct them using HTML tools, and, either have the knowledge to edit at the source level (so that you know what the tool is really doing) or, probably best, use a source level editor. 
If you don't want very deep markup, you should find that most email clients that can cope with URLs can render the *bold* and _underline_ conventions used by traditional plain text email users, although you may have to enable an option - I think Outlook has such an option. 
Many will also turn ":-)" (colon, hyphen, close parenthesis) into the corresponding smiley face character (yours may have, so I've spelled the symbol out). 
If your concept of targetting the congnitively disabled means tight control of formatting, rather than clear semantic labelling, my advice would be to send the mail with a PDF alternative. 
If you intend to send material with graphics that are not critical to all recipients, you should have subscription options for the plain text, or minimal graphics, only version, to save on their bandwidth and mail folder space. 
Make sure that you design for reading on WebTV and similar.
