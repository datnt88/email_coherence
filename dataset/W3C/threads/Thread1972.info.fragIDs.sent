<s> I've seen a number of requests for a more formal specification for CGI than URL:http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/cgi/ .  </s>
<s> This leads to the following questions: 1) Is CGI appropriate for an RFC?  </s>
<s> If not, what standards group would it belong to?  </s>
<s> See URL:http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/http/hypermail/1995q3/0378.html (in which Roy says no to your first question, and gives some explanation).  </s>
<s> I've said the W3C should probably be the standards group in charge, if any.  </s>
<s> If you want to talk about it, www-talk is probably the best place.  </s>
<s> Obviously, it's been discussed before to no end, but maybe some of the recent discussion in c.i.www.a.cgi could be elided to a concrete proposal (something along the lines of BGI).  </s>

<s> Thanx, mike  </s>
<s> The W3C, probably, if they were interested.  </s>
<s> www-talk, I suppose.  </s>
<s> Yes. I have written a fairly formal specification of CGI.  </s>
<s> See URL:http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/~drtr/cgi.html  </s>
<s> David Robinson.  </s>
<s> From: drtr1@cus.cam.ac.uk (David Robinson)  </s>
<s> www-talk.  </s>
<s> Would those replying please drop the http-wg from the Cc: list?  </s>
<s> Nice work.  </s>
<s> I wish I'd had when I was implementing mine.  </s>
<s> It's good to see that W3C is pointing to that as the spec as well.  </s>
<s> However, I have a few quibbles.  </s>
<s> Naturally, I can't seem to reach hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc to check some things on it, either.  </s>
<s> Grumble.  </s>
<s> On to the quibbles.  </s>
<s> 1) The AUTH_TYPE section mentions HHTP.  </s>
<s> Presumably this is a typo.  </s>
<s> 2) I think it should be changed to allow multiple protocols in both GATEWAY_INTERFACE and SERVER_PROTOCOL.  </s>
<s> Follow the HTTP draft for the User-Agent: field.  </s>
<s> This is a real change from current behavior, but I believe such an implementation would meet the NCSA spec.  </s>
<s> As an example: GATEWAY_INTERFACE = CGI/1.1  </s>
<s> NCSA/1.4 indicates that this server supports the extra variables from NCSA 1.4, etc. SERVER_PROTOCOL already has an "extension-version" option, this just generalizes that.  </s>
<s> 3) The CGI command line description has some serious errors.  </s>
<s> You don't get an argument only for ISINDEX query; not even according to this spec.  </s>
<s> An imagemap query meets the criteria as stated, and the NCSA 1.3 implementation certainly provided an argument (and the supplied imagemap program expected one).  </s>
<s> I also don't see any reason to restrict the argument to a GET request, unless you want to actively discourage people from putting data in command line arguments.  </s>
<s> 4) I think the reference to the "array of strings" in the CGI command line section is misleading.  </s>
<s> Currently, only one is used, and it's passed to the script as if it were the first argument and the script had been invoked from the command line.  </s>
<s> Better wording might be: Some platforms support a method for providing one or more argument strings to a script.  </s>
<s> This first argument is used in the case of .... If there is no such argument, it should be the empty string, and further arguments are reserved for server-specific uses.  </s>
<s> Sorry, I don't feel up to trying to rephrase the "ISINDEX" quote to cover the missing cases when it's not clear what those are yet.  </s>
<s> 5) As to telling the difference between a missing body and a zero-length one, the presence (or absense) of Content-Type: can do the trick.  </s>
<s> If it's not there, there's no body.  </s>
<s> If it is there, the body has a length of zero.  </s>
<s> 6) Under requirements for servers, you say: Servers should reject with error 404 any requests that would result in an encoded "/" being decoded into PATH_INFO or SCRIPT_NAME.  </s>
<s> Note: this should be made a requirement.  </s>
<s> Why?  </s>
<s> Remember that the justification can't include the semantics of the underlying file system.  </s>
<s> 7) The "Data input", and "Data output" requirements should be appreciably tightened, to indicate that servers should tie the default input and output streams to the incoming object and output to the client.  </s>
<s> Since it may not be possible, we can't require it.  </s>
<s> But that's the desired behavior if it's possible.  </s>
<s> 8) You've made a quiet change to the behavior of parsed headers - requiring that the CGI headers appear before the HTTP headers.  </s>
<s> A good idea, but this should be noted.  </s>
<s> 9) It appears you've made another quiet change to the location: header.  </s>
<s> I recall that NCSA required URL's that resolved to the server to be handled on the server, whereas you've chaged it to be only URL's without a scheme.  </s>
<s> I heartily approve, but think this should be noted as well.  </s>
<s> 10) If the recommended changes to command line and I/O streams sections are made, then those parts of the system-specific information for unix are redundant, as it complies with the recommended behavior.  </s>
<s> 11) Amiga system-specific standards: Not a quibble, an addition to the system-specific information at the end: AmigaDOS Environment variables These are accessed by the dos.library routine GetVar.  </s>
<s> The flags argument should be 0. Case is ignored, but upper case is recommend for compatability with case-sensitive systems.  </s>
<s> The command line and I/O streams follow the "should" recommendations, and aren't required in this one.  </s>
<s> Thanx, mike  </s>
<s> According to Mike Meyer:  </s>
<s> My recollection from the time the spec at NCSA was written is that everyone did want to discourage people from putting data in command line arguments.  </s>
<s> Some people wanted to completely exclude it, but that was ruled out because of its existing use with ISINDEX.  </s>
<s> I think it was decided to allow it only in ISINDEX.  </s>
