Behaviour is not up to the user, it is up to the author. 
It is the author/server that has to control what happens when the link is selected by the user. 
Except in rare cases the user should not be able to change the action that selecting a link causes.This is why you must separate presentation from behaviour. 
Note that in Netscape, clicking on a link with the middle mouse button opens the target of tht link in a new window; shift-clicking saves the target to disk. 
These are behaviours chosen by the reader. 
I like this terminology (except for the termini - how the hell do I present Gard du Nord or Waterloo to users?) I am beginning to wonder if "terminus" has a non-railway meaning to North Americans??? 
It really _is_ awfully comical! 
B. Link traversal What happens when a link is traversed. 
This would be better called Link Action. 
Traversal is not something non-rocket scientists understand. 
I agree. 
What most users understand by clicking on a hotspot is that some action should take place. 
This is what the behavioural side of the equation covers. 
Hmm, no-one has suggested hotspot for the footprint of a link. 
Lee Americans go to airport terminals. 
Railways are not used nearly as much. 
One American's opinion: it looks pedantic. 
We tend to steer away from such terminology as "high fallutin' BS". 
OTH, the rate of change in American speech patterns since the invention of mass communications is very high. 
I can't think of any cases off hand when adopting words from dead languages has been much in vogue. 
XML - "we can invoke the behavior to link to the terminus" American - "click here and bag that thing" len [Liam Quin:] As far as I know, terminus has no association with railroads for most Americans. 
We call these things "train stations". 
The word "terminus" simply means an end point, if it means anything. 
The hilarity that "terminus" seems to engender in our Friends Across the Sea is probably a good reason to use some other term.
