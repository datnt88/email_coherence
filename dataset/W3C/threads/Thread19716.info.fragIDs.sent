Given the following HTML code, abcdef ghijkl with all browsers I've tried, except Amaya, the part of the H1 block before the HR tag is displayed just above the horizontal ruler, and the part of the H1 block after the HR tag is displayed just below the ruler. 
With Amaya, the first letter of the part of the H1 block after the HR tag is displayed in the right margin (one line below the ruler) and the rest of the block is displayed on the next line, correctly centered. 
I am using Thot 1.0b for Solaris 2, May 21, 1997 precompiled binary release. 
Is this a known bug? 
... Or is it a feature?

Hi Bertrand, 
It's not really a bug. 
The HTML 3.2 specification does not allow a HR to be within a H1. 
The piece 
of HTML code you give is not correct. 
Some browsers display it one way, some other another way. 
Amaya sticks to the W3C recommendations and tries to encourage the correct use of these recommendations. 
It makes some effort to recover from some HTML errors but not too much, so that you can detect and fix errors in your documents. 
Thanks for your comments, Vincent.

You're right. 
It escaped me that H1 elements could only have inline elements embedded in them, and that HR was a block level element. 
The surprising thing is that AOLpress, that I had originally used to edit the page containing that example, hadn't diagnosed the syntax error. 
Thanks, Bertrand Ibrahim.
