<s> Hi Bertrand,  </s>
<s> It's not really a bug.  </s>
<s> The HTML 3.2 specification does not allow a HR to be within a H1.  </s>
<s> The piece  </s>
<s> of HTML code you give is not correct.  </s>
<s> Some browsers display it one way, some other another way.  </s>
<s> Amaya sticks to the W3C recommendations and tries to encourage the correct use of these recommendations.  </s>
<s> It makes some effort to recover from some HTML errors but not too much, so that you can detect and fix errors in your documents.  </s>
<s> Thanks for your comments, Vincent.  </s>

<s> You're right.  </s>
<s> It escaped me that H1 elements could only have inline elements embedded in them, and that HR was a block level element.  </s>
<s> The surprising thing is that AOLpress, that I had originally used to edit the page containing that example, hadn't diagnosed the syntax error.  </s>
