Having been more or less involved in the review project from the start, and being a "professional" Web access reviewer, I am pleased to see the draft document "Process for Reviewing Websites" [ http://www.w3.org/2000/04/wareview ] I think Charles, Sylvie and Gregory have nicely summarized the criteria for providing an effective site evaluation. 
I am very pleased to note that the present level of detail allows for some leeway in setting up and managing evaluation teams. 
I am concerned that being too proscriptive (e.g. requiring a team to include six people with specific abilities using different assistive technologies, one WCAG domain expert, one W3C language domain expert, etc.) will prevent most volunteer review groups and many governmental or commercial concerns from getting involved, simply because of the resource and management implications. 
As both Jutta Treviranus (University of Toronto Adaptive Technology Resource Centre) and I described during the EO meeting at CSUN (both of our organizations do commercial accessibility reviews), individual evaluations can vary enormously in scope and detail... from simple demonstrations (as Starling Access Services is doing for the Government of Canada) to incredibly detailed, line-by-line code and usability evaluations costing the clients thousands of dollars (as both Jutta and I have also done). 
What we have to keep in mind with the EO Review project is that Web masters are not asking us to do this, and certainly not paying for the "service". 
If I understand the process, someone will nominate a site or sites to be reviewed and the team in the designated regional area will review and comment. 
(By the way, the site selection process is not mentioned in the draft document... it would be nice to see some thoughts on that in writing as well.) 
I think that we should continue to aim for the least complex methodology that produces the best possible results, without crossing the line into costly or time-consuming efforts. 
I grant that line may be difficult to define. 
I would like to emphasize (in the methodology section) that clear and detailed documentation of any review procedure is critical for both the client and any third party reading the review. 
It is especially important to note any assumptions made and any reasons for decisions to limit the breadth and depth of a particular review.

aloha, chuck! 
thank you for your valuable comments on the rough draft... one point you made which i wanted to address was quote I am concerned that being too proscriptive (e.g. requiring a team to include six people with specific abilities using different assistive technologies, one WCAG domain expert, one W3C language domain expert, etc.) will prevent most volunteer review groups and many governmental or commercial concerns from getting involved, simply because of the resource and management implications. 
unquote on the flip side, this is a very good way to get people with technological skills educated in accessibility, and to get individuals from volunteer groups and organizations versed in the technology... there's a vast training ground out there called the web, and if, as you so rightly point out, we develop a strict methodology and ironclad accountability mechanisms, it would be possible to train a lot of people not only how to analyze a site, but how to repair the process that led to the inaccessibility of the site in the first place... it is exactly what EO needs: a chance to raise the level of awareness of all concerned as to what it takes--a combination of awareness, skill, technical competence, inventiveness, and judgement--to make sites accessible in the quote real world unquote... and, in this effort, the past work of EO (such as the curriculum) will be indispensable, gregory ACCOUNTABILITY, n. 
The mother of caution.

I think it is important in this document to specify what skills are required, not how many people. 
Training people in particular areaas is outside the scope of the document. 
On the other hand, there will be different interpretations of "an expert in WAG guidelines", or "an expert user of screen reader technology" (which screen readers? 
How expert? 
etc).
