Hi -- is anyone aware of any efforts voice content to develop search capability? 
I'm aware that this is not a trivial problem and would require major advances in voice recognition technology. 
IMHO we are approaching a time of both need and availability of hardware power to make such efforts feasible.

Hello, This is very interesting technology. 
It is based on phonetic analysis. 
From what I understand, the digitized human speech is broken down to its phonetic components and an index is created. 
Then the text search is broken down into its phonetic parts and compared to the index. 
. 
I understand the technology works across languages, but that some tables need to be created. 
I am not sure what languages are supported so far. 
The applications that exist are in court report and in phone tapping. 
This is not cheap technology. 
I'm sure you can see the application for Digital Talking Books (DTB). 
By the way, if you have not visited the DAISY Web site recently, you may want to go to: http://www.daisy.org

Hi Bill, I know that Autonomy has the ability to search video and voice and can also transcribe both into text in real time (with about 85% accuracy). 
It is expensive, but it is also very good at natural language search. 
I'm sorry to add that the Autonomy site is not accessible, but if you can look at it, go to http://www.autonomy.com/ 
I hope that this helps. 
I have seen and used this technology and it does work, although, like anything, it ain't perfect.
