<s> Hello, This is very interesting technology.  </s>
<s> It is based on phonetic analysis.  </s>
<s> From what I understand, the digitized human speech is broken down to its phonetic components and an index is created.  </s>
<s> Then the text search is broken down into its phonetic parts and compared to the index.  </s>
<s> .  </s>
<s> I understand the technology works across languages, but that some tables need to be created.  </s>
<s> I am not sure what languages are supported so far.  </s>
<s> The applications that exist are in court report and in phone tapping.  </s>
<s> This is not cheap technology.  </s>
<s> I'm sure you can see the application for Digital Talking Books (DTB).  </s>

<s> Hi Bill, I know that Autonomy has the ability to search video and voice and can also transcribe both into text in real time (with about 85% accuracy).  </s>
<s> It is expensive, but it is also very good at natural language search.  </s>
<s> I'm sorry to add that the Autonomy site is not accessible, but if you can look at it, go to http://www.autonomy.com/  </s>
<s> I hope that this helps.  </s>
<s> I have seen and used this technology and it does work, although, like anything, it ain't perfect.  </s>
