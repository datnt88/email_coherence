<s> Yes, company personnel should be sensitized to accessibility issues, whether or not they are web page designers/creators.  </s>
<s> Education for them as knowledgeable and interested employees who want the best external presence (and for that matter intranet presence) seems a given, though currently many only report content errors, not accessibility ones.  </s>
<s> We can build on the desire for voice browsers as needed by phone browsers,  </s>

<s> Hi Judy, Harvey, all, I agree with Harvey that all staff in an organization should have at least some mechanism for giving feedback on the accessibility of the organization's web site.  </s>
<s> In order to do that effectively, all staff need sensitizing to the basics of web site accessibility or at least an overview (or three or four) on why this is a good idea.  </s>
<s> I would have had trouble at some points in bringing web accessibility to ALA if I hadn't had the insights and involvement of staff from Customer Service, HR, Publications and couple of other units.  </s>
<s> We were able to pool our knowledge of our customers and not play "Blind Men and the Elephant" quite so often.  </s>
