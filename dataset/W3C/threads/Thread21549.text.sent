I am not sure "arbitrary" is the right word as it might bring the reader to think of "random" and I am not sure this is what we are talking about. 
Would it be useful to expand the sentence in *...* to say: "The SOAP extensibility model does not limit the extend to which SOAP may be extended and does not prevent extensions from modifying the SOAP processing model as described in section 2.6." 
Does that work?

*The SOAP Processing Model may be changed in arbitrary ways.*" 
We might wish to add a safety warning. 
What do you think? 
Jean-Jacques. 
Thanks... Would description of examples of what one can do with features be primer stuff?

Does it make sense?

What's the issue with 280? 
Is it how we say that even though there are practical limits we don't restrict the ways SOAP may be extended? 
Henrik Ok, I've done mine, except #280 for which I'm awaiting further feedback. 
The problem I see with your wording is that people will think that 2.6 tells them how to modify SOAP processing model. 
How about: The SOAP extensibility model does not limit the extent to which SOAP can be extended. 
Nor does it prevent extensions from modifying the SOAP processing model from that described in Section 2.6 Gudge -----Original Message----- From: Jean-Jacques Moreau [mailto:moreau@crf.canon.fr]

I'll go incorporate the change, as per my action item.
