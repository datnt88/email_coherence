Dear Carlos- 
comments on new document: ** Executive Summary - "Accessible authoring tools are those that allow the creation of accessible web content within an accessible environment. 
" Awkward sentence, has the word 'accessible' in it 3 times. 
Change to something like: "An accessible authoring tool has two identifying characteristics; first, it creates end product web content that is accessible -second, the authoring tool itself has an accessible development environment." 
** Implementation status - use sub headings: Review Recommendations: - Existing - New Software Development Process: - Scenarios - Third party accessibility tools Localization: Competing Tools: Cheers, -grace

How about Accessible authoring tools allow anybody to create web content that can be used by anybody, regardless of whether the author or user might have a disability. 
(this avoid using accessible three times in a row...) cheers Chaals 
Hi Charles, 
I like your suggestion a lot, but now it looks like we repeat two times. 
I am substituting the second 'anybody' for 'everybody'. 
It can be discussed tomorrow in the call.
