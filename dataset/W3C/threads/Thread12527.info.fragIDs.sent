<s> Hi, I've been doing some work on techniques for ATAG guidelines 3 and 4 in advance of Monday's call.  </s>
<s> I've posted what I have so far at: Both are still drafts, but the techniques for GL4 is especially rough.  </s>
<s> I will be updating these periodically over the next couple of days.  </s>
<s> We really need to get these finished, so, if you can, please volunteer to add sections by sending a message to the list.  </s>

<s> Great work, Jan! You're putting the rest of us to shame.  </s>
<s> I apologize for my silence, but I am now working again on your latest docs.  </s>
<s> It's taking a bit of time to go through, but I'll be posting my comments here as soon as I can.  </s>

<s> Here are some additions or comments (ideas - not the wording as such) Guideline 3: 3.1.2(15)  </s>
<s> Metadata (new) (c) Check for DOCTYPE and refer to Help if user is unsure of which to choose (new) (d) Check that Metatags do not violate WCAG such as refreshing not controllable by user.  </s>
<s> 3.1.2(17)  </s>
<s> Tabular structure I would change what is currently in (d) to (my wording in CAPS): (d) The tool can provide the user with a linearized view of tables (as tablin does).  </s>
<s> For layout tables THAT CANNOT BE CHANGED TO VALID CSS DUE TO KNOWLEDGE OR TIME CONSTRAINTS, this version can be offered as alternatives.  </s>
<s> I don't like this really because I don't like suggesting the use of tables for layout in any shape or form!  </s>
<s> Even my change can be open to misuse.  </s>
<s> 3.1.2(18)  </s>
<s> looks like it might have the potential to rectify the problem with tables for layout, so maybe this sentence can be dropped?  </s>
<s> 3.1.2(20)  </s>
<s> non-text supplements to text Bit puzzled by the mere existence of this bit.  </s>
<s> Is it really an issue?  </s>
<s> 3.1.2(21)  </s>
<s> Other Information (new) (f) Warn about adjacent links Technique 3.1.3  </s>
<s> (add to list) * no frames view Technique 3.1.1??? (under Techniques for Success Criteria 2) (new) If author turns off any regularly scheduled checks in the configuration section, the tool must have a built-in method that cannot be turned off.  </s>
<s> I.e. the author might not want to have any help throughout the entire authoring process, but there should be one last check that cannot be turned off.  </s>
<s> Guideline 4: Still don't like technique 4.3.4 - can it be clarified somehow?  </s>
