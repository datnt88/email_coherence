<s> We have in Apps Area a number of groups which want to have working groups.  </s>
<s> The line is getting longer and longer, and that is NOT FUN.  </s>
<s> Reason for not "just" creating new wg's is that we have limited resources in various places, and resources are held up by old wg's which move forward very slowly -- if moving at all, and not always in the correct direction maybe?  </s>
<s> I will as Area Director start forcing wg's to decide to be closed, and documents moved to personal contributions.  </s>
<s> Note that this doesn't prohibit the documents to be published as an RFC in the future, but as individual contributions.  </s>
<s> If people have any problem with this, or other ideas on how to free resources, let me and Ned know.  </s>

<s> Patrik, Maybe there are cases where the topic is important and extra effort would appear if people (other than the chairs and current participants) knew the WG was under threat.  </s>
<s> I understand that you may hesitate to name-and-shame in public, but a list of the WGs you consider to be stuck would be interesting.  </s>

<s> I don't want to do this now, but first talk with Ned (which is happily unaware of me wanting to do this _NOW_), so we have a coherent picture of the state we belive the wg's are in.  </s>
<s> My mail might have been possible to read in a more negative way than what was intended.  </s>
<s> The main point was that people interested in a topic should NOT be afraid of having a wg closed, because the work can continue anyway -- especially if the number of people is small.  </s>
<s> The mailing list can continue to exist, the RFC's can still be produced etc.  </s>
<s> The point was that I feel that we should try to use the IETF resources for the discussions which do need the really wide review the IETF can provide in a wg, and not only through a last call.  </s>
<s> And, I do have the names of wg's which WANT to close but are not able to do that because I personally have their last documents on my plate.  </s>
<s> I am cleaning up that in parallell.  </s>
<s> Ned is working with a new apps-area web-page, and more status reports will be given, and my goal is that WE in the apps area should have a common view on: - What we are working on in general - What we need to concentrate on - What is out of scope I hope we together can communicate more in all directions on status etc, and that hopefully will give people the extra energy which is needed to push I-D's over the last doorstep to become RFC's (including myself, I am not blaming anyone!!) That said, I expect that Ned and I can start having a list of wg's and documents shortly -- but the expectation is NOT that the information there should be a surprise for anyone, and especially not the wg (chair).  </s>
<s> I have already had email exchange with one chair in one wg today, and just exchanging those two messages made me understand more what is actually going on.  </s>
<s> So easy, and I probably do not do it often enough.  </s>

<s> patrik - thanks for the thoughtful note.  </s>
<s> may i ask that you and ned send email to each of the WGs in question, comparing their progress to their charter, and giving them a short amount of  </s>
