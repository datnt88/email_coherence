Does anyone know where discuss@apps.ietf.org's 
archives are at? 
The ones linked from the Apps webpage stop at November 2000.

interesting question. 
I had to look around a bit to find them. 
they are currently being maintained on what used to be the www.apps.ietf.org 
web server (back when I was an apps AD). 
most of the content of the web server has since been moved elsewhere, but we never made arrangements for the list to be archived at a different location. 
the list is still being maintained on cs.utk.edu, and the list maintains archives by appending to a local (NFS mounted) file based on the name of the list and the date. 
obviously we need to fix this. 
but for the next few days at least, you can find the archives (since Feb 1999 - is this when it started?) at http://wilma.cs.utk.edu/mail-archive/ the filenames are of the form {listname}.{year)-{month} be aware that these archives include spam and probably viruses, most of which were filtered out before the mail was sent to the list. 
Keith W3C archives a copy of it here: (seems complete since Dec 1998) Gerald Oskoboiny http://www.w3.org/People/Gerald/ World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) http://www.w3.org/
