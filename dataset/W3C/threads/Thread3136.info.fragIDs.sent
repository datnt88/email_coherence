<s> A lot of the arguments against shared secret client authentication seem to be layering arguments.  </s>
<s> Specifically, the argument seems to be that shared secret style authentication properly belongs at the application layer.  </s>
<s> While I feel that this argument has some force  </s>
<s> in principle, it seems to me to be deeply problematic in this specific case, for a number of reasons: 1.  </s>
<s> The security services that TLS provides to the application layer are inadequate for this purpose.  </s>
<s> The obvious approach to layering protocols which require shared secret authentication over TLS is simply to pass the shared secret directly over the TLS channel, using TLS as TCP has always been used.  </s>
<s> However, in the common case, TLS application layer data is encrypted with a 40 bit keyspace, which means that that's all the protection provided for the shared secret.  </s>
<s> Consequently, we either have to accept this limitation or the application needs to provide it's own protection for the shared secret.  </s>
<s> 2. Forcing applications to provide their own security argues against the purpose of TLS.  </s>
<s> Much of the argument for TLS is that applications can then be largely security oblivious while still taking advantage of security services.  </s>
<s> While data confidentiality for the data on the channel is important, there is a lot of historical evidence that the primary security need for e.g. telnet is actually access control, not data confidentiality, and this is typically provided via a shared secret.  </s>
<s> If TLS can't serve this need in an adequate way, then securing them will require a lot more work than just layering them on top of TLS--at which point one might easily imagine providing an application specific protocol which would meet that application's precise security needs in a single package.  </s>
<s> 3. There are a large number of common internet protocols which require shared secret style authentication, including but not limited to telnet, the Berkeley r-protocols, NNTP under certain circumstances... So, we're going to be reinventing this wheel a lot of times.  </s>
<s> This still doesn't make it TLS's job, but it's hard to see who's job it is, then.  </s>
<s> 4. We've already violated this layering boundary.  </s>
<s> Public key style client authentication isn't really a necessary part of TLS service provision and could be easily handled at the application layer.  </s>
<s> This layering argument would be a lot more convincing if we hadn't already gone against it.  </s>
<s> -Ekr  </s>
<s> I may be the first person to have mentioned the specific issue of a layering violation, and I'll clarify a misunderstanding here.  </s>
<s> My issue had nothing to do with using shared secrets.  </s>
<s> (I can't speak for the particular issues anyone else may have intended.)  </s>
<s> My issue was related to the specific proposal made by Microsoft, which would force specific application level issues, related to the languages and character sets used by applications (and in fact whether the secret is directly known to a user or not, etc), into the transport layer security protocol.  </s>
<s> (Resolve that issue and there were still a bunch of other issues ... ) In no way did I say that "shared secrets" in general are bad to include in a transport level, or contrariwise that "public keys" are bad.  </s>
<s> One only needs to look at GSS-API for an example of some existing practice, already deemed reasonable by the IETF.  </s>
<s> It supports both schemes.  </s>
<s> If folk want shared secret authentication, I suggest looking at the  </s>
<s> work already done by the GSS-API working group; it's supported Kerberos for a long time, and evidently now supports some public key flavors.  </s>

<s> EKR, Please read below your comments.  </s>
<s> I think that the latter is going to win out in the long haul.  </s>
<s> The reason is that 40 bit keyspace is really not adaquate for modern day buisnesses and applications.  </s>
<s> Another approach would be to modify that keyspace to 128, which would quiet alot of commercial concerns.  </s>
<s> Otherwise providing for that level(128 bit) will be done in a non-standerd manner by those commercial buisnesses for providing their customers better "Adaquate" protection of their data.  </s>
<s> I would agree that forcing applications to provide their own security is contrary to the TLS perposal, it may very well become a common practice with respect to the weakness of 40 bit common keysize.  </s>
<s> I don't agree that TLS should only address access security per say.  </s>
<s> Buisnesses need to feel safe that they believe and can trust that their data is secure, which agrues in  </s>
<s> favor of layering, IE application layer.  </s>
<s> I think the idea of an application  </s>
<s> spicific protocol, is a intresting thought, except I think I would carry it out to a more generic or encompassing protocol, with a common interface.  </s>
<s> I agree that it is not TLS's job.  </s>
<s> But I would look at at least providing an exit for and interface for TLS, not to mention SSL, Berkeley r-protocols, and any other shared secret protocols.  </s>
<s> Well that is history now.  </s>
<s> The real question is how do we handlee it?  </s>
