<s> To the Group - At home I am a stead-fast "Windows" type but at work, I am generally on a Mac - a G3 Tower running OS-X with no Classic or other operating system on the same machine.  </s>
<s> Not sure whether we've discussed the issue but Mac's and probably more likely the browsers created for Mac's DO NOT render certain pages that were authored using CSS.  </s>
<s> I tested the links or one link from today's Techniques Audio Conference (http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20/WD-WCAG20-GATEWAY-20030723.html) and here's  </s>
<s> what I found with multiple browsers: Microsoft's Internet Explorer: Yielded the text very well.  </s>
<s> The floating buttons on the right that would link one back to the Table of Contents did not render (showed up as a missing graphic).  </s>
<s> Apple's Safari: The text was all over the place - basically, no usable rendering at all.  </s>
<s> OmniWeb: Yielded good text.  </s>
<s> Same flaw as Internet Explorer (floating button showed up as a missing graphic).  </s>
<s> Mozilla: Same as "big brother" - Netscape below.  </s>
<s> Mozilla and Netscape did,  </s>
<s> however, render the floating buttons for anchoring back to the Table of Contents.  </s>
<s> Netscape: Table of Contents flowed to the right and off of the screen - rest of the text (non-hyperlinked) was okay.  </s>
<s> Opera: Good text rendering but floating buttons did NOT render properly.  </s>
<s> My Concern - I am not going to recommend one browser over another as not a single one in this simple, non-scientific low budget experiment rendered the identified page correctly.  </s>
<s> This same page (http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20/WD-WCAG20-GATEWAY-20030723.html) did not have similar issues on a Windows machine with various web browsers.  </s>
<s> I recall some months back, we discussed the importance of assuring that web  </s>
<s> accessibility cross the operating system divide and we needed to look at how  </s>
<s> things render on Mac's.  </s>
<s> If we make recommendations to authors that they use  </s>
<s> CSS, we need to be assured that the user agents on varying platforms actually support pages equally well.  </s>
<s> Suggestion: More people testing stuff out on Mac's and making some of this "stuff" known to the rest of the group.  </s>
<s> Again, I cannot be sure but feel this is a user agent issue but it is still a concern that needs to be addressed.  </s>
<s> Question: Has anyone else encountered this same issue?  </s>
<s> Anyone know if the User Agent Working Group has discussed this?  </s>
<s> Your thoughts and possible solution are appreciated.  </s>
