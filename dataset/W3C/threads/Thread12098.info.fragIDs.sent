<s> proposed at minimum: At minimum ensure that each example used is an accessible example.  </s>
<s> Note that examples may be multi-part, so showing how to add an image in 5 steps, including as step 4 or 5 adding alternative content, would meet this checkpoint, but leaving the addition of alternative content to a different section would not.  </s>
<s> Issue: to what level should the content meet WCAG (since that is our definition of be accessible)?  </s>
<s> Suggest level double-A, and I think that should probably be in the checkpoint text.  </s>

<s> Hello all, To follow up on today's call, here's my take on checkpoints 6.1, 6.2, 6.3.  </s>
<s> 6.1 Document all features that promote the production of accessible content.  </s>
<s> [Priority 1] This checkpoint promotes the production of accessible content by helping authors learn how to use the accessibility related features of the tool.  </s>
<s> At minimum, the tool should include documentation explaining the purpose and use each of these features.  </s>
<s> More advanced implementations might provide context-senstive links to this content from within the authoring tool user interface.  </s>
<s> 6.2 Ensure that creating accessible content is a naturally integrated part of the documentation, including examples.  </s>
<s> [Priority 2] This checkpoint promotes the production of accessible content by  </s>
<s> implicitly demonstrating to the author that all content, regardless of purpose, should comply with the WCAG guidelines.  </s>
<s> At minimum, all documented examples of the authoring tool interface (i.e. dialog boxes, code views, etc.) should include any relevant accessible authoring practices.  </s>
<s> 6.3 In a dedicated section, document the process of producing accessible content.  </s>
<s> [Priority 3] This checkpoint promotes the production of accessible content by explicitly informing the author of the steps they need to take (using the the features of the tool documented for Checkpoint 6.1) to satisfy this goal.  </s>
<s> At minimum, provide an overview of the tags and attributes that are required to enhance accessibility.  </s>
<s> The documentation for each feature might explain which disability groups and user agents benefit from its use.  </s>

<s> Issue - note that this is pretty close to what is required as the minimum for 4.2 (except there is the priority difference)  </s>

<s> They are close, but not that close.  </s>
<s> The 6.1 minimum addresses documentation of the features of a tool that benefit accessibility, whereas the 4.2 minimum is about explaining the accessibility errors found by the checker and then explaining how to fix them (which may or may not involve using special accessibility features of the tool).  </s>
<s> Example: An image input dialog has an "alt" field.  </s>
<s> 6.1 documentation might say= The image dialog has an "alt" field for the required alt text.  </s>
<s> 4.2 documentation might say= Missing alt text: Open the image dialog and write a short description of the image in the "alt" field.  </s>
<s> If the image is serving as a bullet then use the word "bullet", .... etc. Cheers, Jan Jan Richards Adaptive Technology Resource Centre (ATRC) University of Toronto jan.richards@utoronto.ca  </s>
