<s> hi all, As outlined at the face to face meet, I've been working on methods of getting coordinate information about the locations of Semantic web researchers and groups.  </s>
<s> I wrote to the www-rdf-interest list asking for data: so we'll have to see how that pans out.  </s>
<s> Please do add yourselves if you've not already there (I just did a few as examples).  </s>
<s> There are some SVG demos, developed from ones by Jim Ley, displaying the information we have already, which I constructed as examples: So, now we have to decide on the map which we will use to overlay the dots on.  </s>
<s> We want something that will highlight Europe, especially since on a world map, Europe is too small to really show up on provide the level of detail we require.  </s>
<s> At ILRT, Caroline Meek, Dan and I have had discussions with a designer, and he has pointed us at some examples, and we've narrowed it down to two that we rather like: which has the advantage of showing Europe as part of the world (we could get rid of the arm of the globe that is showing, and alter the colours); and which would be technically simpler to do, but shows Europe in isolation (I do like the colour scheme though).  </s>
<s> Do people have a preference for one style over the other?  </s>
<s> Could you let us know today if possible?  </s>
<s> We need to specify the map as soon as possible in order to get postcards printed for www2003.  </s>
<s> thanks, Libby p.s. Here's a nice similar idea:  </s>

<s> Can't say I'm particularly grabbed by either of them, but if you have to pick one I'd go for the map, not the globe.  </s>
<s> Is there any reason it has to be geographically accurate?  </s>
<s> Perhaps a schematic, analogous to the London Underground map of London, would allow you to convey the sense of spatial distribution without getting hung up on the scale problem.  </s>
<s> Of course, you may not consider that a helpful suggestion given the short timescale :-)  </s>
<s> Cheers, Ian  </s>

<s> One advantage of being geographically accurate is it simplifies our lives when we try to plot SW researchers, groups, events etc on the map...  </s>
<s> I prefer the map to the globe, fwiw.  </s>
<s> Dan  </s>
<s> yeah, sorry it's such a rush.  </s>
<s> It took a long time to write the document explaining how to write the RDF.  </s>
<s> At this stage we really need examples to show the designer though - I'll pass your comments along to him, see if he has anything like that.  </s>
<s> What don't you like about them in particular?  </s>
<s> thanks for the feedback Libby  </s>
<s> Hi Libby,  </s>
<s> The globe is too visually busy for a background (imho), and if you decrease the opacity I think you'll lose too much of the important bits (like where the UK is :-).  </s>
<s> The map would be OK as a backdrop for the FOAF map if it was semi-opaque, but (a) it misses out the rest of the world, as you said yourself, and (b) there's a big blue empty space on the left :-).  </s>
<s> The atlantic is just too big** if you keep it to scale, hence my suggestion to use more of a schematic approach.  </s>
<s> I guess you need the cartographical equivalent of an ellipsis, whatever that might be!  </s>
<s> Cheers, Ian ** qv "[the judge] ruled that the guilty party was 'life itself' for failing to be either beautiful or true" [hhgtg]  </s>
<s> thanks Ian.  </s>
<s> I broadly agree with you.  </s>
<s> For (b) though, that might work in our favour, as we can put a logo and/or a slogan there.  </s>
<s> Libby  </s>
