To make the minimum requirements for checkpoint 4.13 simpler, I suggest the 
following change to limit the scope of the checkpoint to only changing colors: 
4.13 Allow the user to configure how the selection is highlighted (e.g., foreground and background color). 
[Priority 1] 4.13 Allow the user to configure the color used to highlight a selection. 
Make available the range of system colors.

Hi, I propose instead requiring the user agent to implement at least one mechanism 
other than changing colors (since color alone might cause problems for 
some users). 
We can suggest, for example, underlining, or a box, and point to CSS focus rectangles.

Ian, We do require exporting information on selection to AT. But I would be interested in other peoples opinons.
