the attached sample program kicks up TIDY errors for p within list items but they do provide the function of spacing where needed for visibility ...... so they are not a donothing operation ... is there a 'better' way to obtain the breaks so that i dont raise an error also img needing alt and table needing summary attributes so i put in null string attributes and no error msg was raised but it should say that meaningful text is required alt="" sushes detector but doesnt help viewer....... john john russell VE3LL@RAC.CA body text="BLACK" link="royalblue" vlink="navy" alink="red" bgcolor="WHITE" and Vittorio Favetti /I br hr li 1.1 Objectives li 1.2 References li 1.3 How to Use "The Lone Star Rules" Ruleset li 1.4 Scale and Miniature Basing li 2.1 Characters li 2.2 Character Classes li 2.3 Actions and Attitudes br ?

The correct way would be to add margin-top and margin-bottom styles to li, but Netscape doesn't support this! :-( But sometimes alt="" is the right thing to do, and Tidy isn't smart enough to know. 
Tidy can tell that a document is inaccessible, but it takes human judgement to tell if it is accessible ... Regards, -- Dave Raggett dsr@w3.org

there _are_ a lot of meanigless immages and tables around in the web. 
For those alt="" is corect to use. 
Why schould eg LYNX-Users read [decoration] or [tabel for design-trick] all the time?
