<s> WP7 * work on RDF query interoperability and testcases; rewriting big chunks of the Inkling code I should be able to get a release out this week.  </s>
<s> From an RDF query testcases irc meeting, I implemented this: ACTION libby convert squish and RDQL jena tests to ntriples and circulate by date of next meet - and I have a small test framework that can test using Ntriples versions of Andy Seaborne and Alberto Reggiori's RDQL tests as well as my Inkling tests.  </s>
<s> This is limited to conjunctive only queries, and not all get the same answer ... yet.  </s>
<s> But there's definitely some measure of interoperability.  </s>
<s> The tests are here: WP3 * postcard, supporting documentation, data see for pointers to various technical things about it is the final version (for now).  </s>
<s> * chairing 2 irc calendar meetings, two irc query testcase meetings and contributing to Dan's geo meetings calendar These meetings focused on calendar/geo overlap (describing a journey,  </s>
<s> opening hours of a thing that has a place), usecases for cal/geo data: and also EventDiscovery, sources of calendar data query These had two main aspects - implementing and testing very simple query formats (ntriples-based) using manifest and resultset formats; and better RDF query languages - optionals, provenance and transformation into RDF queries.  </s>
<s> We had a topic maps and RDf query languages BOF at XMLEurope and there is an upcoming BOF at WWW2003: geo meetings These has the following agenda items: opening hours of a thing that has a place describing a journey update on DAML spatial work DanC update on travel tool writeup Relationship to GML (chat w/ Simon Cox) heads up from zool re noderunner and nocat developments Bus and train route visualization  </s>
<s> There's a lot of interest in this area, and a new mailing list: I also went to XMLEurope - report to follow.  </s>
<s> cheers, Libby  </s>
<s> Hi Libby,  </s>
<s> How on earth did it get that particular name?! Ian (mildly surprised that visiting the mail archive was allowed by HP's keep-the-engineers-pure-and-innocent filters)  </s>
<s> heh. here's some discussion from the Geo meet about this topic: 15:38:14 _joshua How about Geowankers is a good place to discuss Geo stuff and how it relates to real world applications, not ivory-tower GIS stuff.  </s>
<s> Thus including interop with RDF, XML, perl, whatever etc mumble frotz 15:40:06 _joshua It's just my sense of humor.  </s>
<s> Don't take it so literally.  </s>
<s> 15:40:16 jben ..the name should keep the list relatively small Libby  </s>
<s> WP3 - Workshop report 3 I am taking responsibility for finishing this report, but it will be delayed at least until the end of next week (Resource crunch :( It will discuss the Geo-meetings held as a virtual, ongoing workshop:  </s>
<s> One result of this work is a new project at W3C to develop a graphical interface (SVG) for creating and working with Geographic information in RDF.  </s>
<s> This also has implications for WP9 Accessibility (beig able to work with the information), and potentially with Thesaurus work (different descriptions of places) and other areas such as Web Services integration.  </s>
<s> WP3 - Workshop report 4 There is little likelihood of a successful workshop in Denmark as we had hoped for.  </s>
<s> A possibility being investigated now is a workshop either on accessibility applications or on support for a multilingual Web (which includes issues such as treating sign languages used by Deaf people and symbolic languages used by people with intellectual disailities as an internationalisation problem, expanding the scope from plain text somewhat, and building on work already done in areas like image annotation and Dublin Core classification) WP9 Work on a note about ways to use the semantic Web to improve accessibility.  </s>
<s> Need for coordination has delayed this work package more than we hoped, but there is a rough initial draft in the reports area.  </s>
<s> Now working concurrently on finishing that, and moving forward with the second deliverable (getting WAI groups to comment on which bits are useful and which bits need development).  </s>
<s> To that end the AnnoteMez package and integration with Wainu are now availble in French, and will be translated shortly.  </s>
<s> Wainu is a standard accessibility evaluation-type tool, with an interface to ask the user for human judgement questions (does this text alternative really match this image?  </s>
<s> etc), available under LGPL.  </s>
<s> AnnoteaMez provides Java libraries to do things like provide EARL information to, and store it for, tools such as Wainu, using annotea for storage, Jena for dealing with querying (only some annotea servers include a query language) generate and interpret Xpointers, etc. AnnoteaMez (and its integration with Wainu) was developed as a project at ESSI (an engineering college in Sophia), which I co-supervised, and is available under W3C License (URIs to follow).  </s>
