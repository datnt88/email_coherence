Regrets, still teaching during our conference call time.

IRC: irc.w3.org:6665, channel #wai-wcag Agenda 1. 
To complete the work of the subgroup at the face to face meeting that sought to reorganize the guidelines according to the proposed categories. 
2. To discuss the proposed definitions of the three categories/levels: Other issues available for analysis: The implications of the proposed levels for the further development of the WCAG conformance scheme. 
Whether a reorganization of the guidelines according to the proposed categories would overcome substantial concerns affecting the development of WCAG 2.0. 
Whether the guidelines should be regarded as specifying what ought to be delivered to the user agent, perhaps via intermediary processing, rather than what the author must create. 
How to ensure that the guidelines remain precise, while taking account of changes in user agents and assistive technologies, wherever the latter may reside on the network. 
The upgrade path from WCAG 1.0 to WCAG 2.0: how it is to be explained, and whether relatively straightforward WCAG 2.0 conformance profiles can be constructed that correspond approximately to the three WCAG 1.0 conformance levels. 
The role to be played by the concept of a "user agent baseline" in the WCAG conformance scheme - if the guidelines specify what the user agent must receive, rather than what the author is required to produce, then it would appear that the concept of a "user agent baseline" should play an important part in defining how the guidelines apply, notwithstanding changes in technology. 
It is not expected that all, or even most of these issues will be considered at the meeting; the purpose of this list is to indicate some of the major questions that still remain open. 
Sorry i regrets for this week meetings.

This email is not an offer to do business, but is only a discussion. 
All agreements with IWA must be in writing and acknowledged by IWA International management. 
A slight amendment to the agenda: the WCAG working group Charter is up for renewal. 
A draft of the revised Charter is expected to be available before tomorrow's meeting, and will be open for review and discussion. 
I just dawned on me the obvious (with some help from Wendy). 
It is not very useful me telling everyone what RDF tools may or may not be coming. 
people need to know what tools are there now. 
So I have put up our in-house stuff on our testing server. 
The syntax is invalid, and the meta data is embarrassing - but it works. 
It works today and anyone can use it, and anyone can make any content accessible. 
If people tell me they want to use it -then it will stay on the web (embarrassing though it is). 
We made today crude examples case 1 original page: It is missing the old alt tag However it has in the header a reference to a RDF resource document If you go to UB Access test server you can see SWAP take the resource , take the RDF file and render an accessible page Feel free to make your own page, RDF file and go to "my document" is your inaccessible page with a link to an RDF document) note: please mimic my rdf as much as possible - flexible ways of writing RDF is not supported note: in this case the inaccessible page should be XML (like xhtml) That is the only case we managed to put up, but I want to put up two more over the weekend - I want to show you the cases a bit so you get an idea where it is going Case 2 (will try and put it up by Monday) This is an example where you can not add the header line into the inaccessible page (maybe because you do not have access to the inaccessible source pages) What you can do is make a separate file that links the resource and the resource document. 
see http://ubaccess.com/swaptestlinks.html 
SWAP will render the linked to resources accessible It needs a separate pipeline - will try and put it up over the week. 
note: in this case the inaccessible page can be in invalid markup (like badly written html) only the file with the links needs to be in XML I would like to get up another example Look at file http://ubaccess.com/swaptest3.html 
as you can see the RDF is not yet written but we will try and get this pipeline up by Monday, but if you ve got an idea of what is going to happen note, the same word or RDF statement will work to translate the same word more then once (Xpath/Xpointer) So if we had a few generic "simplification" RDF files can simplified multiple pages on multiple sites. 
You do not have to annotate repeated content more then once. 
Note again this is very crude. 
but anyone can use it - enjoy All the best, Lisa Seeman UnBounded Access Widen the World Web lisa@ubaccess.com mailto:lisa@ubaccess.com www.ubaccess.com

inks.html This is an example where you can not add the header line into the inaccessible page (maybe because you do not have access to the inaccessible source pages) What you can do is make a separate file that links the resource and the resource document. 
see http://ubaccess.com/swaptestlinks.html 
SWAP will render the linked to resources accessible note: in this case the inaccessible page can be in invalid markup (like badly written html) only the file with the links needs to be in XML you can make your own page where "my page" is the URL of the xml file that links and resource to any accessible annotations file. 
This allows anyone to make any page -even where they can not change the text or content at all, accessible.
