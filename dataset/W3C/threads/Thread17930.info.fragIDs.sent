<s> i propose that we adopt the average maximum speech rate of four of the most commonly used -listed software synthesizers as the minimal requirement for the minimal upper range for the synthesized speech rate Eloquence for JAWS (Eloquent Technologies) slowest: 100 words per minute (can increase by 1 wpm increments or by 70 wpm increments fastest: 800 words per minute ViaVoice Outloud (IBM) slowest: 70 words per minute fastest: 700 words per minute (increases in 10 wpm increments) Orpheus (Dolphin Access) slowest: 10 words per minute fastest: 700 words per minute Microsoft Speech Engine (Microsoft) slowest: 100 words per minute fastest: 510 words per minute the average works out to be 677.5 words per minute, which is akin to having 2.1 children, so i propose that we adopt 700 words per minutes as the minimal upper range for synthesized speech  </s>
<s> Note: control over pitch has a significant effect on the intelligibility of faster speech rates; pronunciation rule bases play a role, as well -- because British English has more clipped pronunciation than does American English (at least as synthesized by software speech engines) i am able to listen to content at a far faster rate using a British English rule base, than i am when i use an American English rule base when using a software synthesizer.  </s>
<s> ultra-fast American English is best accomplished (at least, to my ears) by hardware synthesizers... most people who regularly interact with computers in an exclusively aural manner tend to do so at accelerated rates, at least 425 to 575 words per minute in most situations, although many set discrete settings so that prompts, menus, and the keyboard echo is spoken at the maximum possible rate allowable... of course, the nature of the content being reviewed also plays into how fast one sets one's synthesizer -- when i listen to the newspaper, i tend to go as high as 650 (or 675, if i'm just taking a cursory listen to the sports page!) on the other hand, if i'm tired and listening to source code with punctuation turned on, i might dip down as low as 275, but listening to slower rates is really draining -- it's the aural equivalent of trying to read a marquee that is scrolling a syllable or a character at a time... a lot of speech users also set (or are able to set, due to the speech engine they are using) a discrete rate for the "edit" area, so that, for example, in a word processor, when you listened to your document, it would be read at a reasonable rate, perhaps somewhat slower than average, perhaps significantly so i'd be glad to factor into the equation the ranges of other commonly used software speech engines, particularly those available for linux, and adjust the minimal requirement accordingly... i'd also be interested in the range rate available to users of screen magnification programs that provide native support for supplemental speech, as well as the rates available for supplemental speech synthesis targeted at dyslexics who process information most efficaciously when it is presented aurally, which is something RFB&amp;D might be able to assist us with... gregory.  </s>

<s> we are promulgating Web Content ACCESSIBILITY guidelines, and if we are to set a maximal and minimal range for rate of synthesized speech, it is incumbent upon us to: a) ascertain the average highest speech rate allowable for software synthesizers in context, which is to say, how they are deployed in the real world, and offer the average as our minimal requirement (almost all of the software speech synthesizers are licensable) b) ascertain the average lowest speech rate allowable for software synthesizers that are available to classes of users who need supplemental speech in order to process information (i.e. low vision users using speech in conjunction with screen magnification and persons with certain types of dyslexia)... if we, as you suggest, simply throw out the numbers i collated, we will be doing a major disservice to those who interact with the web in an exclusively aural environment, and failure to take this into account would not only be a grave error, but the foundation for a minority opinion and a lot of criticism when we recycle through Last Call... i am not trying to cow you into using my means of ascertaining a minimal high rate, only pointing out that, for anyone who interacts with the web in an exclusively aural environment, the ability to control speech rate is the equivalent of being able to change the font size, font family, and the size of the window... it is a serious issue, and deserves the serious attention of the working group... note, as well, that i CCed the post to 3 people who have an enormous amount of experience with users who synthesized speech, both as their primary (or even, as in my case and the case of anyone with neuropathy, as well as the more than 30 percent of blind people who do not or cannot read braille) means of obtaining information, or as an indispensable supplement to what they are able to perceive visually... i am holding firm and fast to 700 wpm as the minimal requirement for this checkpoint, as i believe you would, ian, were the tables turned... as for the samples provided, those are the only 4 software speech engines to which i have recourse -- they just happen to be the 4 most widely deployed, although there is a sizable minority of DECTalk Access32, a copy of which i do not own) and the lowest maximum rates -- that of the MS Speech Engine... my proposal called for other WG members who have access to other software synthesizer provide information about their speech rates to the list as well, but a speech-enabled browser needs to have robust a speech engine as possible, otherwise, it is just a toy for the sighted and those whose eyeballs are otherwise preoccupied 1. single language support (the version of the MS Speech Engine i have is US English only) -- i'd be interested in hearing if dick or tim or someone else at MS could let us know if the rates available to the user change when the language to be synthesized is changed? it doesn't in Eloquence, ViaVoice, or Orpheus 2. intention -- the speech engines developed outside of the AT world tend to be utilized as "powertoys" -- using the MS Speech Engine, for example, without a screen reader, one can get Eudora 4.3x to speak a number of the header fields if the user so chooses what we are discussing here isn't simply "wow!  </s>
