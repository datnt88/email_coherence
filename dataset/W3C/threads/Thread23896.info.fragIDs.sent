<s> No one other than myself has yet uncovered the simple steps to do so and I will not reveal the steps here, because I don?t want people pirating fonts.  </s>
<s> Microsoft knows about the problem and has stated it will do nothing to correct it.  </s>

<s> For the porpose of embedding: TrueType and OpenType is the same thing.  </s>
<s> OpenType is a more like an extension of TrueType than TrueType a subset of OpenType.  </s>

<s> Correct.  </s>
<s> The signature table in OpenType has the potential to improve overall security, or at least make stray copies easily identifiable, but the security re.  </s>
<s> embedding is still based on the embedding bit information.  </s>
<s> Foundries need to be clear about the importance of the ebedding bit, and it helps no one to speak of 'stupid' foundries if the foundries have been misinformed.  </s>
<s> Nor is it helpful to speak of 'stupid foundries' if a new technology (WEFT) extends an old technology (font embedding) to a new medium.  </s>
<s> It is quite within reason that a foundry might have little opposition to font embedding in Word documents, but serious opposition to embedding in websites.  </s>
<s> The potential for piracy is drastically increased by web embedding.  </s>
<s> For a font to be embeddable in a Word document increases the value of that font for the user, and this increase in value may offset the risk of piracy.  </s>
<s> When the risk factor is increased, this will almost certainly no longer be the case.  </s>
<s> When Adobe first invited the major type companies to extend their EULAs to permit embedding in Acrobat, they were less than forthright about the security risks involved.  </s>
<s> I wonder to what degree MS stressed the importance of the embedding bit setting; after all, embeddable fonts increase the value of MS apps.  </s>
