<s> I am looking for a Web browser that pipelines multiple requests over a persistent connection.  </s>
<s> The browsers that I have checked (Netscape Navigator and Communicator, and W3C Amaya) do not pipeline requests even when using a persistent connection (at least that's what appears to be the case based on a tcpdump trace).  </s>
<s> I would appreciate any relevant information/pointers. Thanks.  </s>

<s> Jose Kahan is currently integrating the libwww pipelining code into Amaya but until then you can try out the libwww robot [1] which does the trick pretty well.  </s>
<s> This is the application that we have used for the HTTP/1.1 performance paper [2].  </s>

<s> Since MSIE 4.x does HTTP/1.1, that is one place to look at.  </s>

<s> HotJava in combination with HTTPClient will also pipeline.  </s>

<s> Has anyone verified if MSIE 4.x actually pipelines when talking to a 1.1 server?  </s>
<s> HTTP/1.1 clients don't have to.  </s>
<s> Yes, it does, and the performance difference is quite noticable even on a local connection.  </s>
<s> IE 4.x does not pipeline requests.  </s>
