<s> This is a flowcharting tool I evaluated some years ago that has a syntax for describing flowcharts.  </s>
<s> Semi-colons, commas, and other punctuation marks denoted different flowchart symbols.  </s>
<s> If this or some other scheme was adopted as a standard, then a visuall-impaired person could generate flowcharts, as well as interpret flowchart information!  </s>

<s> AT internet on 08/11/99 10:51 AM Subject: How to describe Flowcharts, Schematics, etc Most image on the web are decoration or icons with simple meanings like "next page".  </s>
<s> so ALT text and long descriptions are relatively straightforward.  </s>
<s> But some images convey information.  </s>
<s> For example, A simple linear sequence, like a flow chart with input going through a series of processing stages to result in an output.  </s>
<s> A tree diagram, like a company's organization chart.  </s>
<s> A more general diagram showing a bunch of interconnected objects, e.g. a schematic diagram or an electronic circuit.  </s>
<s> The most complex is a 3D machine, in motion if you want to make it even harder.  </s>
<s> Are there any guidelines on how to describe these diagrams?  </s>
<s> For example, you could use lists and nested lists for linear sequences and trees respectively.  </s>
<s> Or you could use prose.  </s>
<s> More general diagrams are, well, a more general problem.  </s>
<s> What techniques are best for what purposes and audiences?  </s>
<s> What's good wording, especially for prose decriptions?  </s>
<s> I'm mainly thinking of speech output here, since that's what most blind surfers will be using, rather than Braille or tactile graphics.  </s>
<s> This is no doubt hard to encapsulate... at some point you just have to get a skilled technical writer, especially for the prose versions... Len Leonard R.

<s> Hi, Regarding description of _A Clockwork Orange_ and audio description, reading from the original text (since the film is an adaptation of the original book - and one of the finest films) would be appropriate.  </s>
<s> The author, Anthony Burgess, was a linguist and included a glossary at the end of his book for the strange vocabulary he created for his characters - of neo-Elizabethan English slang mixed with Russian terms.  </s>
<s> Glossary could be made available at beginning or end of presentation and/or independently in Braille/print form.  </s>
