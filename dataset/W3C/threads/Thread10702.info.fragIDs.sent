Incidentally, should I be making editorial fixes to a particular copy of the document now?

The following entailment tests are not really defined (and dont work in my test harness), since they have no entailmentRules data: 
The intention is that in the absence of other entailmentRules, simple entailment is used. 
I note that that condition is missing from the test 
case document through editorial oversight; my proposed fix is to add the text, In the case that no test:entailmentRules elements are present, the rules of simple entailment as specified in [RDF-SEMANTICS] are used. 
Again, these tests demonstrate the distinction between language-tagged and non-language-tagged plain literals, and should be viewed as simple entailments. 
With the addition of the above editoral fix to the test case document, would your concerns here be addressed?

Unfortunately, I have a very good idea how fast my keys are moving.

Ouch. Closed-world assumption. 
That works against test harnesses that treat the manifest as an RDF graph to query. 
Please don't do that.

I'm aware of that; since multiple entailment rules and datatype support aren't expressed using cons-style lists, this is already the case, so I was inclined to consider the decision justified*. 
(Having a regular syntax for the manifests that doesn't require all the RDF parsing machinery to process is a requirement.) jan * I have a recollection of raising this ages ago in a telecon. 
It wasn't considered a problem at the time.
