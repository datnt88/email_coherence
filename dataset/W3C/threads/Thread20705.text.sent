i am trying to upgrade pages from transitional to strict.... keep getting errors for a src="foo" target="bar" foo de bar /a saying target isn't acceptable... it passed in transitional version. 
how do i do the equivalent operation mostly when bar = _page! 
cant see where target is not allowed in the TR! John Russell, VE3LL@RAC.CA Be sure to check your HTML markup code tags by using http://validator.w3.org or I guess you are using XHTML 1.0 strict. 
Here is the DTD fragment that defines element a and its attributes in XHTML 1.0 strict: !ATTLIST a %attrs; charset %Charset; #IMPLIED type %ContentType; #IMPLIED name NMTOKEN #IMPLIED href %URI; #IMPLIED hreflang %LanguageCode; #IMPLIED rel %LinkTypes; #IMPLIED rev %LinkTypes; #IMPLIED accesskey %Character; #IMPLIED shape %Shape; "rect" coords %Coords; #IMPLIED tabindex %Number; #IMPLIED onfocus %Script; #IMPLIED onblur %Script; #IMPLIED see: http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd 
As you can see, target is not a valid attribute for element a in this DTD. 
By the way, src is also an invalid attribute for element a in all DTDs.

[DJW:] No frames related features are allowed in strict HTML. 
I believe the position on pop ups is (as well as not getting a very good accessibility rating from WAI) that the users should control when new windows are created.
