The discussion is recorded in starting with [08:35:00] DanC LMM: yes, re / question, the text of 6.H isn't quite clear... thru [09:19:14] DanC this would require enhancing our test infrastructure to take another input. 
I think I presented it to the WG as a whole; I think Jeremy grokked... 
I think the result was some actions to change test cases and stuff in the syntax spec... yeah: [10:03:50] mdean_ ACTION: jeremy review error2 and error3 test cases In short, #15 was easy; yes, we're correct. 
#12 is more subtle, but I think we're agreed what to do and Jeremy is doing it.
