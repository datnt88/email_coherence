[Suzan Dolloff] I received a couple of emails after my reply to your initial request for review suggesting this probably isn't the most appropriate discussion for this list. 
Messages that are purely reviews of Joyce's site probably are inappropriate. 
However, a lot of good points about general accessibility design have been raised, and messages relating to those should be kept on the list, IMO. 
On a WAI list, yes, but not on this one: I suggest wai-w3c-gl, the Page Authoring guidelines list, where issues about Markup accessibility are the main topic. 
I'm ccing this message on both, so that GL people are aware of this past thread, but you should now only answer gl, not ig. Thanks. 
(This thread originated on the WAI-IG list and has been copied to this one.) CM: I find that a strange suggestion. 
If the page is readable in Lynx (as you note), why make yet another version? 
SD: Many blind web surfers use graphical browsers and have never even heard of Lynx. 
We're just as subject to the hype of "get Netscape Now" or "Best viewed with Internet Explorer" icons as anyone else, Chris. 
Provided the ordinary web surfer is as proficient with browser software as those of us who spend tens of hours each day using them, AND provided browser manufacturers have included programming which immediately renders the "Print" function results in a format that is as instantly accessible to a vision-impaired user as a sighted one (doesn't require having to crank up yet another adaptive device, in other words), then no, a text-only version isn't necessary. 
I have yet to run any web page through Bobby where the annotations did NOT include the suggestion of a text-only version. 
And just how much more work is copy/paste to create a .TXT 
file compared to creating, say, a frames/no-frames alternative? 
I'd also like to clarify something I believe was misunderstood. 
Text-only version links MUST include the actual URL to a link (http:///www.something.org) 
since they're obviously not hypertext. 
CM: Secondly, ACCESSIBILITY MUST BE EASY. 
SD: Yes. 
ESPECIALLY to the people who most benefit from it and are already being expected to integrate their use of the Internet with GUI interpretation. 
CM: Most people can see. 
While I want my site to be visible to as many as possible, every extra piece of work necessary moves the border of "possible". 
Making duplicate versions of every file quickly pushes the visually challenged into the "impossible" side, especially for large Web sites. 
SD: To be as succinct and as polite as possible, Chris: tough nuggies. 
It's a compassionate AND necessary accommodation in some cases, as is providing frames/no frames options, not to mention plain common sense for reaching the broadest audience. 
Anyone on the Web who wants my money for their product better be creating a site which makes it possible for me to know what the product is! 
I submit inclusion of a conversion tool (.html to .txt) in next-generation HTML authoring software programs would practically address this issue from either side of the fence. 
Until then, be glad it's no more complicated than copy/paste. 
I DO appreciate what you're saying in terms of the work required to generate/duplicate file content, and I, personally, would rather suck eggs than retrofit an existing site (since, as a designer, I'm usually so relieved to have it DONE the first time in order to move onto the next project). 
However, since the objective here is to provide accessibility to all, I stand behind my assertion we have to practice what we preach, WHATEVER it takes to make a web site accessible. 
CM: Right now, Lynx renders hr as a series of underscores. 
Does this bother you - does your screen reader read underscores? 
SD: I thought I'd already explained how using voice synthesis with different applications often *requires* hearing punctuation pronounced despite the fact the software's default configuration is usually set up so the listener does NOT hear it. 
For example, imagine trying to learn how to write HTML without hearing the exclamation mark or dashes in a comment, e.g., !--comment -- . 
So yes, Chris, I hear and am annoyed by repetitions of "underscore-underscore-underscore-underscore..." as a text alternative to a decorative horizontal rule simply because some designer was bound and determined to have me appreciate his page layout. 
However, as a web designer myself, it IS nice to know how someone has laid out a page, and that brings me to something I learned about just yesterday by following links on CAST's Bobby site. 
This well-designed and highly-accessible web site uses what's known as a D link, or "description." 
Clicking on a D link takes users to another web page which offers image or sound descriptions whose robust explanations aren't well served by ALT or TITLE or LONGDESC attributes. 
A sound description for a .wav 
file, for example, is an actual transcript of the lyrics which, obviously, cannot be heard by a deaf person. 
An image description can not only explain a specific graphic, it could also include an explanation of the page's layout. 
Now, I, personally, like this D-link idea very much, since it means I'm still using my graphical browser just like anyone else when I click on the link taking me to the description page, but I concede this is yet another file to create and could just as easily be contained in a text file as an HTML file. 
If you get a chance, Chris, please visit the above-listed URL. 
This is a sharp web site from both an "abled" and disabled perspective and, in my opinion, one of the best examples I have yet to encounter of seamless integration of aesthetics and accessibility. 
Respectfully, if still somewhat tweaked by facetious tones, Re? Dolloff Excuse me, I thought that LONGDESC was the properly engineered attribute that was intended to replace the D-link kludge. 
I mean no disrespect to the folks at wgbh, they did something that needed doing, and did it with the tools at hand. 
But a properly engineered solution is still surely better? 
best regards cpl:: Surely, LONGDESC will be better, but D links work now. 
LONGDESC is not supported by any browser yet. 
There is no harm in using an interim solution especially if one is going out of one's way to be sensitive to the wishes of the blind and visually impaired community for maximal page information.

img alt="purple line" . 
While designing for access, it's important to consider the sighted viewers too! 
I see three audiences for the alt text: graphic browser users with image loading turned off, text browser users, and visually impaired users. 
Those with image loading turned off want to know whether to load the image. 
For them, an indication of whether or not a line is interesting enough to load is worthwhile. 
But for text browser users, a snippet of text doesn't have the same effect as a rule does - it doesn't break up the page in the same way. 
Using ASCII-graphic alt text helps them. 
And I think that most screen readers skip most punctuation. 
I think a combination alt text would work well for all three audiences: maybe something like img alt="purple line________________________________" and img alt="zig-zag line /\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\" would work well. 
I would use ALT as replacement text, TITLE as an image title: If we treat these attributes this way, we get simplicity and consistency.
