<s> Maybe I missed something but I thought the following two paragraphs should be combined to one: "The combination of the SOAP extensibility model and the SOAP binding framework provides some flexibility in the way that particular featuresand MEPs can be expressed: They can be expressed entirely within the SOAP envelope (as blocks), outside the envelope (typically in a manner that is specific to the underlying protocol), or as a combination of such expressions.  </s>
<s> It is up to the communicating nodes to decide how best to express particular features and MEPs; often when a binding-level implementation for a particular feature is available, utilizing it when appropriate will provide for optimized processing."  </s>
<s> Futhermore, isn't the ednote addressed at this text and not at the bottom paragraph?  </s>
<s> Shouldn't the ednote be place after the text above?  </s>
<s> Henrik Frystyk Nielsen  </s>
<s> Not to be picky nor to put additional burden on Stuart but I am slightly uncomfortable with the ednote as it stands.  </s>
<s> I realize that the purpose is to give some flexibility in how we want to move forward.  </s>
<s> However, it seems to be such a central part of the model that I am wondering whether it would be good to qualify the differences a bit more explicitly so that people don't get the impression that we are completely opening up the floor to suggestions - this was at least not my impression from today's meeting.  </s>
<s> Could we for example promote Noah's suggestion by providing an alternative piece of text?  </s>
<s> Henrik Frystyk Nielsen  </s>
<s> Sorry to be dumping this all in your in-trays... hopefully a third and final version.  </s>
<s> The merging of the two paragraphs that Henrik noticed required a slight tweak to Noah's ednote to refer to a single paragraph above rather than two.  </s>
<s> Changes are: merged paragraphs and tweak to the ednote.  </s>
<s> Here is a proposal for an updated ednote that may improve understanding the issue.  </s>
<s> I find it slightly problematic that the current note talks about "binding specifications in particular, vs. other software" as specifications and software doesn't seem to compare.  </s>
<s> What about: "There is still some discussion about whether we should say more about how communicating SOAP nodes determine whether to express features as part of the underlying protocol binding or within the SOAP envelope proper."  </s>
<s> Does this capture it?  </s>
<s> Henrik  </s>
