I have a form inside a data table. 
The code in question is part of our shopping cart and is located at shipping costs based on different delivery dates and asked to choose one. 
The table is organized into 3 columns in the following order: date, price, select with all the proper data table markup. 
I've put a label tag around the price and the id for it in the input tag of the appropriate radio button. 
Some JAWS users report not being able to access the date in forms mode and others report not being able to tell which radio button goes with which price. 
They seem to think that the radio button is on a different line than the price when they are in the same row. 
How do I code this so that all the information that is needed to make a decision is "seen" by a screen reader? 
The information has to stay in this table data format. 
thanks, Michelle Podd Web Designer I think you have done it correctly. 
The LABEL element works for me with Window-Eyes and HPR giving the cost of each shipping option (I didn't try JFW). 
One can argue that this is not adequate information and you need both the timing and the cost. 
In that case, given the tabular structure, you could use the title attribute on the input elements to specify their "prompt," rather than the LABEL.

It's a good book!

thanks, Michelle Podd Web Designer id="" values must begin with a letter. 
Yours are all numbers, like to support, I would be very surprised if this minor legalistic transgression were the cause, but it is something. 
The page does not quite validate. 
These are not entirely conclusive suggestions, I admit. 
From everything I've read, Jaws is majorly imperfect in interpreting forms. 
It is possible that you are doing everything right and it is still screwing things up.

Jim, I'm not sure exactly what you mean. 
I can't seem to find form examples where title is used. 
I've copied the code from one of the table rows and added the title attribute the to input tag. 
Is this what you mean? 
title="delivery Monday May 13, 2002 AM"  /td Joe Clark pointed out that the label and id values have to start with a letter so I've added that change as well to the example above. 
Thanks to both of you for your feedback. 
both of than
