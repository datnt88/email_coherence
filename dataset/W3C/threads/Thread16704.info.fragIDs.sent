Hi Kynn, Quote The problem we face is that "Bobby Compliant" may become more important than "accessible." 
(Note that I think there is also a danger with "WCAG Compliant" in the same way, but at the moment that risk is smaller than the Bobby problem.) In other words, people get confused and they think that what they are trying to do is get a Bobby logo for their front page, when really what they -should- do is try to make their web pages more accessible. 
Pleasantly surprised to note we are singing from the same hymn sheet on this, ( did I really use that expression? 
sorry) Ten-20 recently lost out on a lucrative contract/web build because I stupidly mentioned in the tender that a Bobby compliant logo was not a vital requirement and did not always signify accessibility anyway. 
The contract went to poptel whose own website 
is totally inaccessible. 
Hypocrisy rules it appears. 
I am totally convinced that well meaning people in large charities and Government circles are too convinced of the infallibility of Bobby.

Sorry to hear this example. 
There is so much mis-information out there and maybe the EO would like to consider addressing this.

That's a definite shame. 
I would not say that Bobby itself is over-rated -- the program is amazing for what it does -- but rather that Bobby -compliance- is overrated by many who want to simplify the web accessibility problem too much and boil it down to one variable which can be easily tested. 
I.e., does it pass or not pass Bobby? 
Even the CAST people know and state that this isn't so simple, and yet people persist in caring more about a stupid cartoon logo than, for example, testing their sites by having people with disabilities try to use them.

TAKE CONTROL. 
Absolutely, The Bobby icon represents an achieveable standard and a tangible, cost effective reward for efforts made towards web accessibility by people working in government or similarly placed organisations. 
It may be difficult to displace the presumption in their minds that attaining the well renouned Bobby Approved Icon means sufficient accessibility has been achieved. 
In the absence of a complaint, CAST does not actively regulate the use of the Icon and there seems to be abuse in some instances. 
It strikes me that it could be difficult to create such an achieveable and accepted stamp of accessibility especially when many issues as to priority 2 (and 3) compliance are still to be universally ironed out.

Cynthia, do you know: 1. 
What concept of enforcement do they have? 
2. Do they have legislative backing? 
3. Are they adopting the WAI guidelines as policy?

Margita Lundman is the Program head of the IT program for the Swedish Handicap Insitute. 
She is also the current moderator of the eEurope mailing list, in line with the policy of having a moderator from the country holding the European Union (EU) presidency (I think that is the office - it is a rotating duty spread around EU members). 
So I think that she is probably a reliable source for the policies of the Swedish Handicap Insitute. 
Further information about them can be found at http://www.hi.se or if you prefer english and don't want to wade through a page of swedish to find the link to "English Materials" you could go direct to Charles McCN Cynthia, do you know: 1.
