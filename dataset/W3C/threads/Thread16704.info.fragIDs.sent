<s> That's a definite shame.  </s>
<s> I would not say that Bobby itself is over-rated -- the program is amazing for what it does -- but rather that Bobby -compliance- is overrated by many who want to simplify the web accessibility problem too much and boil it down to one variable which can be easily tested.  </s>
<s> I.e., does it pass or not pass Bobby?  </s>
<s> Even the CAST people know and state that this isn't so simple, and yet people persist in caring more about a stupid cartoon logo than, for example, testing their sites by having people with disabilities try to use them.  </s>

<s> Absolutely, The Bobby icon represents an achieveable standard and a tangible, cost effective reward for efforts made towards web accessibility by people working in government or similarly placed organisations.  </s>
<s> It may be difficult to displace the presumption in their minds that attaining the well renouned Bobby Approved Icon means sufficient accessibility has been achieved.  </s>
<s> In the absence of a complaint, CAST does not actively regulate the use of the Icon and there seems to be abuse in some instances.  </s>
<s> It strikes me that it could be difficult to create such an achieveable and accepted stamp of accessibility especially when many issues as to priority 2 (and 3) compliance are still to be universally ironed out.  </s>
