<s> Date: 11 December 1998, 16:20 hrs From: Eric Hansen Re: Why I Disfavor Using "Universal Design" in the Title I would like to respond to Dan Dardailler's question about why I disfavor the use of the phrase "Universal Design" in the title of the page authoring guidelines document.  </s>
<s> (See an excerpt of his question at the bottom of this memo.) I wish to state at the beginning that I believe that Web-based products and services should be designed to be accessible to people with disabilities and highly usable by all people.  </s>
<s> By that simple test, I am a believer in Universal Design.  </s>
<s> Generally, I think that the term Universal Design is a nice way of describing what we are trying to help people do.  </s>
<s> However, I have many reservations about the term when it comes to using the term in the title of the WAI page authoring guidelines.  </s>
<s> My reservations are only partly related to limitations of the document as it currently exists.  </s>
<s> For a review of my analysis of some of the limitations, see my previous postings: "Priorities, Impacts, Etc." "Suggestions" particularly items 15 and 16 "Refining the Scope to Address Gaps" "Gaps: (1) Language Readability, (2) Privacy" The working group has recently strengthened guidelines related to comprehensibility of language (see especially guideline B.3, beginning in the 17 Nov 1998 version) (http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WD-WAI-PAGEAUTH-19981117.html).  </s>
<s> This helps address issues that I had raised.  </s>
<s> Yet language is just one "gap."  </s>

<s> I recommend the full article for your review.  </s>
<s> Without at least an acknowledgement of other factors I don't think that the document should be considered a guide to Universal Design of Web pages or sites.  </s>
<s> Indeed, I believe that any decent guide to Universal Design will acknowledge that its scope is limited and that it is not able to focus on the full universe of considerations that should go into the overall design of any product or service (including a Web-based product or service).  </s>
<s> I recently proposed such an acknowledgement as part of my draft revision of the Abstract.  </s>
<s> "This document focuses primarily on issues that can be influenced through markup of the Web content."  </s>
<s> "This document does not constitute a complete guide to Web design.  </s>
<s> It does not necessarily address all valuable principle of visual design, although it is expected that these guidelines are generally compatible with and supportive of good visual design.  </s>
<s> Nor does the document specifically address several other issues, such as economic, legal, and cultural issues that can also influence the accessibility and usability of Web pages."  </s>
<s> (See item 15 of my "Suggestions" memo, With that kind of acknowledgement, perhaps the document is sufficiently complete to be considered a guide to Universal Design.  </s>
<s> (By the way, the wording on that paragraph still needs refinement.) But even if the design document does acknowledge its limitations, I have other concerns about the term "Universal Design."  </s>
<s> I think that the term "Universal Design" is an oxymoron (Greek for "pointedly foolish").  </s>
<s> The phrase "jumbo shrimp" is an oxymoron.  </s>
<s> One word contradicts another.  </s>
<s> The term "design" means, in my view, a process that is intended to result in a solution that satisfies several, but not an infinite number of constraints such as cost, quality of materials, usability, accessibility, etc. Good design results in practical products that provide at least a minimal level of satisfaction for a good chunk its target audience.  </s>
<s> The "universal" in this context says that the design process will work for everyone.  </s>
<s> Yet this is impossible, because no design can satisfy what is essentially an infinite number of constraints.  </s>
<s> For every practical set of "Universal Design" guidelines that a Web developer can follow, I can find people for whom her Web content is inaccessible.  </s>
<s> Thus, even if the guidelines fully treat issues like Web page mark up, alternative content, comprehensibility of language, and respect for old browsers, I can always point out some consideration that could make the Web page inaccessible or unusable by some group -- even more specifically, some disability group.  </s>
<s> Of course oxymorons grab attention and for that reason, they may be useful in advertising and promotion.  </s>
<s> "Universal design" is wonderful and commendable as one design objective among many, but if other important considerations are ignored, the product or service will fail.  </s>
<s> I don't want people to be misled into thinking that a small set of "universal design guidelines" will guarantee that a product or service will be accessible.  </s>
<s> Even if you acknowledge that within the document, a title of "Universal Design" could be misleading.  </s>
<s> One thing that I am not comfortable with is the possibility that the page authoring guidelines lose their disability focus and I am concerned that overuse of the term "universal access" might lead to that.  </s>
<s> I think that it is appropriate to point out how these guidelines will greatly benefit nondisabled users as well.  </s>
<s> But I would like to keep the primary focus on issues that differentially disadvantage people with disabilities.  </s>
<s> In conclusions, I suggest.  </s>
<s> 1. Develop the "impact" ratings (or better yet, "adjusted impact ratings"), particularly for the small number of disability groups, for each guideline as outlined in my 10 Dec 98 posting.  </s>
<s> These rating are intended to help keep the focus on issues that differentially disadvantage people with disabilities.  </s>
<s> 2. Acknowledge the limitations of the document.  </s>
<s> 3. Avoid using "Universal Design" in the document title.  </s>

<s> Some Thoughts on the Name of the WAIGL-PA Document I think that the current name is OK, though as noted elsewhere in this document the use of the term "page" seems a bit archaic.  </s>
<s> I am against using the term "universal design" in the title.  </s>
<s> "Universal design" -- i.e., usability by everyone everywhere -- is a great design objective, but it suggests a note of impracticality and also, in the minds of some, the phrase may carry other meanings that we might not want associated with the guidelines.  </s>
<s> Can you elaborate on the "impracticality" and the "other meaning"aspects ?  </s>
<s> Besides, the document does not deserve the title because no where does it acknowledge the wide range of considerations that should go into the design of accessible and cost-effective Web-based products and services.  </s>
<s> These guidelines promote the design of web content so that it can be accessed no matter what operating system, device, or modality of user interface one has, hence the universality.  </s>
<s> In which way are we not considering enough universality in the design (given our limited context of web content production) ?  </s>

<s> At the core of this issue lies the definitional problem of what, for the purposes of the guidelines, are the conditions under which a document to be considered accessible.  </s>
<s> The priority 1 guidelines merely require that it be possible for the document to be presented in any of a range of sensory modalities (auditory, tactile and visual).  </s>
<s> This stratum defines a minimal level of accessibility and does not entail that the information will be comprehensible, or even that inner structural relations will be apparent to the reader.  </s>
<s> Most of the technical considerations which determine whether this minimal degree of accessibility is attained, have the advantage of being readily identifiable by automated tools (absence of textual alternatives to multimedia content, failure to comply with W3C standards, etc.).  </s>
<s> At a second level one finds those issues which concern the structure of the document, which provides cues that indicate an appropriate reading order and facilitate browsing strategies.  </s>
<s> Yet another layer is added by questions of readability and comprehension, which, however, are implicitly at work throughout the guidelines (for example in determining what constitutes appropriate and sufficiently detailed alternative text, what should be included as a structural aid in a table summary, etc.).  </s>
<s> Cultural and linguistic aspects of comprehension also emerge at this stage.  </s>
<s> Thus, leaving aside the requirement for alternative descriptions/transcriptions, and table summaries, which involve supplementing the text with additional material to compensate for information that is lost when the document is displayed in different media, I think the range of problems addressed by the guidelines can be categorized according to three levels: (1) the perceptual; (2) the structural and navigational; and (3) the comprehension issues.  </s>
<s> The guidelines strive to be comprehensive in respect of levels (1) and (2) and to offer limited suggestions with regard to level (3).  </s>
<s> The latter relate mostly to those aspects of comprehension which are most affected by the rendering of the document in different media (ALT text etc.), and navigation (links which can be understood out of context), with supplementary references to readability.  </s>
<s> I think it is necessary to circumscribe the guidelines' treatment of comprehension-related problems, and to do so in a principled manner, either by describing (as a profile) the expected characteristics of the intended reader of an "accessible document", or by developing other criteria.  </s>
<s> Obviously, there can be no such entity as a document which is readable and comprehensible to everyone.  </s>
<s> Thus it is necessary to define the scope of the guidelines carefully and to justify the boundaries which necessarily have to be imposed.  </s>
<s> I think at the heart of the issue is the answer to the question: do we want to promote these guidelines as focused first on accessibility for people with disabilities or as focused first on accessibility no matter what medium is used.  </s>
<s> To the question: why do we do that ?  </s>
<s> do we want to answer: - it's for people with disabilities, e.g. blind or mobility impaired users, and it also benefits screenless or mouseless users, e.g. webphone or handheld device users - it's for anyone accessing the web thru a phone or a handheld device, with no screen or mouse, and it's also for people with disabilities, e.g. blind or mobility impaired users.  </s>
<s> May I ask you to elaborate on this part ?  </s>
<s> While I agree with you (you convinced me that is) that Universal Design is not the appropriate term for what we do (as Jason summarized, we're missing most of the comprehension/semantics pieces of design), I think naming one thing after another more powerful thing (the difference being esoteric for most people) is a marketing trick many people have used before us.  </s>
<s> Alternatively, we could used a name like "Universal Access Guidelines", to focus on the medium/structure part (how do we provide the information) and less on the semantics part (what is this information).  </s>
<s> I don't think anyone authorized us to work on guidelines for people who do not have disabilities.  </s>
<s> Also, if the guidelines are to be picked up and used by others to ensure access to the web by people with disabilities, they need to keep their disability focus.  </s>
<s> However, I think it is good, where we can do it with a few words, to point out the other beneficiaries of the proposed access guidelines and techniques as well.  </s>
