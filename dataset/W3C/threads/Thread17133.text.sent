Hi, Can anyone tell me where to find the option in Internet Explorer 6 for Windows XP to increase the size of the text beyond the largest (but still not very big) option provided on the view menu? 
Surely this extremely important control of text size has not been 'disabled'?

You can get a lot of control from Tools/Internet Options then click on Accessibility near the bottom of the form.

Hi all I just wanted to ask if anyone knew very much about making Flash Movies accessible. 
The people I work for want Flash movies on the main site, against my advice really. 
Does anyone have much experience in making accessible flash? 
can it actually be done? 
does MX do what it promises to do? 
Specifically - do you know if creating Access Keys, in Flash, overwrites those already used by users using screen readers? 
are there any opinions in general about Flash + Accessibility. 
Thanks Angela Angela K Hilton Web &amp; E-Learning Officer UMIST Some useful resources are available on Macromedia's web site. 
Probably a good place to start, as they make Flash MX seems to be more switched on to accessibility than previous versions.

Thanks Angela Angela K Hilton Web &amp; E-Learning Officer UMIST As far as I know, the only way to set font size to something else than the five alternatives in the View  Text Size menu on IE is to set up a user style sheet. 
This isn't as bad it as it sounds. 
You could simply write, using your favorite editor, a file with a one-liner content like body { font-size: 20pt; } and then (on an English version of IE): Tools  Internet Options General  Accessibility and check "Ignore font sizes specified on Web pages" and "Format documents using my style sheet" and use then the "Browse" button to specify the file you wrote. 
Jukka "Yucca" Korpela, http://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/ 
You could of course use style sheets to enforce a larger text. 
I have a User Style Sheets Wizards (in Alpha version), I have a Minium text size option on the build your own style sheet bit. 
(I believe that my Mozilla impliementation advice is out of date - I will fix this asap) pete Thanks Peter I've read through MM's site though - it doesnt seem to quite hit the mark though. 
There are too few resources out there for this. 
I've done all the basics that MX allows, naming objects etc.....but it doesnt feel like it's enough. 
I am sure I read somewhere that there are code changes that can be made.

: Hi Angela, We (Vision Australia Foundation) did some work last year for The Learning Federation that involved developing guidelines for Flash accessibility. 
The document applied Flash accessibility theory to WCAG 1.0 checkpoints as this was the specification requirement. 
The document is now available on their web site (http://www.thelearningfederation.edu.au/tlf/) to registered members - a free signup. 
I wrote the document based solely on Flash accessibility theory, my basic knowledge of Flash and comments from Bob Regan (Macromedia). 
I have since been working on improving this document further by developing my own skills and putting the theories to the test. 
My work so far has greatly improved the original document and we hope to have an advanced version soon. 
Also, I have only tested with Window-Eyes so far and need to repeat everything with JAWS at some stage. 
Macromedia and other parties have expressed interest in developing this document, particularly with techniques, to advance it further. 
To pre-empt some responses, please be aware that this document does not mean Flash can be made accessible. 
It can only improve the accessibility of Flash content when it is used. 
Thus, it is important to consider what the Flash movie is being used for. 
I still would not use it for anything other than applications that cannot be implemented in another accessible technology at this point in time. 
In general, this would include learning objects, training programs and the like, that can stand alone in a browser window. 
NCAM (http://ncam.wgbh.org) also have been doing quite a bit of work on accessible rich media, including Flash.

Thanks Angela Angela K Hilton Web &amp; E-Learning Officer UMIST You will, of course, have problems with sites, like Windows Update (NT version anyway) that pop-up critical forms in un-resizable windows (the licence accept window, in this case).
