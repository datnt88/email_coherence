Hi, While looking through section 22 of the deltav document it struck me as odd that DAV:version-controlled-configuration is a property of any deltav compliant resource. 
This is also how the property is defined in section 12.4.1. 
Initially I thought that only collections and version-controlled resources actually need this property since non-version-controlled resources cannot be captured in a baseline. 
Then I noticed that in section 12 it says: "A configuration is a set of resources that consists of a root collection and all members of that root collection except those resources that are members of another configuration" It also says: "A baseline is a version resource that captures the state of each version-controlled member of a configuration" The configuration DOES include members that are not version-controlled, but the baseline does NOT capture them. 
Right? 
So, my question is: Will non-version-controlled members of a configuration that is under baseline control return a value for the DAV:version-controlled-configuration property? 
I think so, but am not 100% sure.

Correct.

Correct.
