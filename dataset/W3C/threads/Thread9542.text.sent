I've been asked for an estimate of how many will attend our F2F meeting during the tech plenary. 
Please could you reply to this message indicating: o whether you expect to attend the RDFCore F2F meeting at this event o whether you expect to attend the plenary day at this event This is for estimating; its not a commitment. 
Brian I am expecting to attend, both things(?). 
Jeremy Hi Brian, YES YES Jos De Roo, AGFA http://www.agfa.com/w3c/jdroo/ 
Brian, unfortunately I won't be able to attend. 
I have to present a paper at the ICDE'02 conference in San Jose, CA which takes place 26th Feb - 1st Mar. 
Great timing... ;) Sergey
