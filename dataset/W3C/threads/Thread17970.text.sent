Will comment on 27 August Draft. 
17.IJ: Propose list of checkpoints that are "sensitive" (affect targetted UAs) and propose variable priorities/rewording for them. 
(Look at HPR's evaluation sent by Jim Thatcher: Done: 18.IJ: Make the dependency on micropayments more visible. 
Not done. 
19.IJ: Include GR's link checkpoint as P3 (configurability). 
Change priority of 9.6 to P2. Get techniques out of [1]. 
Not done. 
20.JG: Create a list of AT people to invite to F2F meeting Done. 
JG: I contacted a number of people. 
We may get a few extra participants, but there are resource issues. 
Agenda 1) Finish discussion on Configuration Checkpoints for Guideline 9 GR: Form control proposal. 
Ian objected last week to Priority 1. 
I argued that problem with forms is that serial navigation is not always sufficient - you may encounter a submit button before the form is really over. 
You want: a) Info about accesskey bindings b) Tabindex order c) View groups and metadata (LEGEND, LABEL, FIELDSET) GR: Trying to be somewhere between specific and general. 
KB: Would it remain a priority one? 
GR: Perhaps phrase the checkpoint similarly to that for tables. 
GR, IJ: P2 ok. Action IJ: Respond on the list to this proposal. 
I think we need something slightly more abstract. 
Agenda 2) Review Ian Jacobs proposal on changes in wording to some checkpoints and priorities for conformance if available before the call (15 minutes): Based on: Issue #79: How do specialized browsers like pwWebSpeak and IBM Homepage Reader conform to the guidelines Issue #77: Validate conformance categories IJ: Refer to [2] [2] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999JulSep/0365.html (IJ summarizes [2]). 
CL: In the case of table navigation, we don't have a problem. 
We do have problems in that we don't have a visual UI that complies. 
We can send output to Netscape, or have text-based output. 
IJ: Two issues: a) Communication with other software. 
b) Multiple output mechanisms. 
MN: Is it better to follow the "interoperable" route or just staying where we are; it feels slightly less strict. 
Action Working Group: Please review this proposal for next week. 
MK: I have some concerns about the very device-specific keyboard guideline. 
It's up front in the guidelines. 
IJ: Current disclaimer in 27 August draft: "Checkpoints in this section do not apply to user agents (e.g., kiosks) that do not natively support keyboard input." 
/* Charles and Mark leave the call */ Agenda 3) Review of impact matrix proposal developed by Kitch Barnicle (10 minutes) KB: What will this document be used for? 
IJ: a) Help people understand which groups of users benefit. 
b) Ensure that different groups' needs are addressed. 
c) Filter out useless checkpoints. 
KB: When I was ready to post this, I realized that I hadn't listed mouse as being affected by any checkpoints. 
Questions: 1. Include mice as input technologies? 
IJ: Yes. 2. Checkpoint: 9.1: Does highlighting imply visual only interfaces? 
IJ: No. 3. Review of specific checkpoints. 
Action JB: Ask Denis Anson to review this list. 
4.Issue #71: Titles for ABBR and ACRONYM elements (need a technique) HB: The technique should address first instances and reuse of the title. 
Action HB: Will propose technique to list. 
5.Issue #72: What should UAs do to support author-supplied metadata? 
1.Marja: Compose list of metadata sources for SMIL. 
2.IJ: Compose list of metadata sources for HTML. 
3.JA: Compose list of metadata sources for CSS. 
(e.g., generated text) 4.CMN: Propose something about schemas. 
JG: In WCAG teleconf last week we discussed this. 
It should suffice to consider metadata known to promote accessibility. 
Need techniques, therefore, for known metadata sources. 
Resolved: Include as techniques. 
No Action assigned. 
6.Issue #73: Text rendering of client-side image maps IJ: Has this been done by any existing tools? 
CL: HPR does this. 
We found that you can have alt on MAP. 
IJ: Not legal on MAP in HTML 4.0. 
Another idea: If you find a title attribute, reuse as "title" in the A element. 
CL: We look for alt, title, URL piece in that order. 
Action CL: Send how HPR does this to the list. 
7.Issue #76: How to get to frames when the user turns off the rendering of frames (need a technique) IJ: The issue was "What does it mean when you turn off frames? 
How do you get at the frames?" 
Why would you want to turn of frames? 
GR: For speech, e.g., easier to have linear access or NOFRAMES content. 
Often, browsers don't give access to NOFRAMES unless frames turned off. 
IJ: What does "turn frames off" mean? 
I suggest that this means that you don't get frame contents, only frame alternative content. 
This is different from non-linear access to to frames (? la Lynx). 
IJ: How do frames reduce accessibility? 
GR: Screen readers may not let you know that you're in a framed view. 
Also, frames that are related - one may change (and be spoken) but you're still in the navigation frame (which hasn't changed). 
JG: Also, some cognitive issues. 
May want a simpler looking page. 
CL: In HPR, we list links to each frame. 
We also list NOFRAMES content. 
IJ: Are we talking about two-dimension rendering only as an accessibility problem? 
GR: A lot of sites use content negotiation to send you to another site that tells you to get a frame-enabled browser. 
This may happen with Lynx, unless you fake your UA declaration. 
CL: Not many sites use NOFRAMES to promote accessibility. 
Resolved: For 4.12 add: a) Ensure that alt content available when turned off. 
b) Important for screen reader users and some users with some cognitive impairments. 
IJ: Ideas for next draft. 
a) For Guideline 4, add reminder to render alt content. 
b) Add rationale for frames. 
c) Add definition of "turn off a frame" to the document to distinguish from alternative renderings or navigation. 
Action IJ: Propose a change to 4.12 to the list. 
8.Issue #78: Ian Jacobs Review requirements for window spawning Action JG: Invite Al to meeting next week. 
see comments below @ MN: MN: Sorry I had to leave the teleconf. 
call early, and I may not understand exactly what was discussed with this issue, but I think if you want to take a look at another tool which performs a similar action as described in Issue #73, the enhanced Links PowerToy might be of value. 
This is a script which writes a script to produce a list of links per the web page in view, and attaches to the context menu in IE. 
The source code is included, since the PowerToy is just an HTML file. 
I also note, this PowerToy needs an update to handle some situations I have since learned about. 
hi jon if i'm understanding you correctly, that is what the Links Power Toy that we developed using M'soft model does, it will walk the AREA element and render ALT Text versus an URL, etc. 
This can easily be enhanced further, and is the basis for HelpDB and my current work on browser helper opjects, which by the way use COM to get at the browser and are very, very, very fast ;) If you want an example, try the Links Power Toy, it works in IE 4, 5, and is simple to install and test, and since it is an HTML file, the source is freely available. 
mark Mark, We are just looking for a technique that shows how to correctly render the MAP element with text links or with ALT text rendered. 
Cathy Laws stated that HPR does this and is going to send an example. 
Do you have another example of how it is being done? 
Would you be willing to submit it as a technique?
