<s> Here's a section from some documentation for my prototype browser.  </s>
<s> The section discusses frames and framesets.  </s>
<s> Frames If this browser reads a page with frames, it will display a menu with a description of each frame.  </s>
<s> The description can include word count, number of links, number of forms and a list of significant words.  </s>
<s> To choose the desired frame, just enter the number of the frame followed by the RETURN key.  </s>
<s> If you ever want to change to a different frame for that page, just type the 'fs' command followed by the RETURN key to re-display the frames menu.  </s>
<s> LRK:: One common frame idiom is for one frame to be a table of contents.  </s>
<s> When you pick a link or button in the table of contents it changes the contents of another frame.  </s>
<s> In the present version of your browser, what happens when the user picks such a link or botton?  </s>
<s> If someone can tell us what other browsers, or combinations of browsers and screenreaders, do, please join in.  </s>
<s> BTW, the author guidelines discuss frames at Also, what would be a good home for collecting this sort of information, i.e. the behavior of current browsers and browser/screenreader combinations?  </s>
<s> E.g. should it be considered as part of the charter of the new RC group http://www.w3.org/WAI/RC/ ?  </s>

<s> If the user is viewing an index frame in the second area and selects a link which changes the frame in the third area, my browser will switch to displaying the new frame in the frame third area.  </s>
<s> LRK:: Excellent!  </s>
<s> So we really shouldn't give up on frame access.  </s>
<s> This confirms that frames show logical relations which can be presented to a blind user in a non-visual way.  </s>
<s> to follow up on what Scott Luebking said:  </s>
<s> If the user is viewing an index frame in the second area and selects a link which changes the frame in the third area, my browser will switch to displaying the new frame in the frame third area.  </s>
<s> When the browser switches frames, is there any cue that this has happened?  </s>
<s> Al Gilman SL:: I'm not quite clear about the question.  </s>
<s> The frame changes in response to the user's action so the user is expecting a change.  </s>
<s> I think the browser does say something about a new frame so that the user doesn't think that link changed the web page rather than just the frame.  </s>
<s> Scott  </s>
<s> What happens depends on the screen reader and browser technology.  </s>
