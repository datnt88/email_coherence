<s> The story (as far as I understand it, and I have been following it for a couple of years now) goes like this: javascript effects do not reliably work in all browsers.  </s>
<s> So it is important not to rely on Javascript for function.  </s>
<s> There are two parts to this.  </s>
<s> One is to do as Len suggested, and provide a server-side equivalent (for example form validation can be done on both sides).  </s>
<s> The other (especially where there is no real functionality added to the page, for example in a mouseover highlight, is to add a focus event - most good browsers will allow the user to focus an element via the keyboard, and functionally a mouseover is equivalent as a user behaviour, although for historical reasons the language support for this is fairly poor (HTML provides fair to appalling support for this aspect of accessibility and browser implementations tend to fall a little short of that.  </s>
<s> Sigh.  </s>
<s> I am pleased to note that there are great improvements in the model being used by the Scalable Vector Graphics language, although I am waiting to see the implementations at work).  </s>

<s> As Charles indicates, this discussion keeps reappearing.  </s>
<s> I just want to try again to make a point which I guess I didn't get across in earlier discussions.  </s>
<s> The point is this: "focus" cannot logically be made the same as "mouseover" That's because "focus" is keyboard focus: the object with keyboard focus is the object that will get keyboard events.  </s>
<s> wherease "mouseover" is MOUSE BUTTON focus: the object with mouse button focus is the object that will get mouse click events.  </s>
<s> For example, if my text cursor is in a text field, that text field has keyboard focus, but I can move the mouse over a link.  </s>
<s> e.g. for purposes of clicking on that link.  </s>
<s> When I move the mouse over that link, I'm giving the link mouse focus without disturbing the keyboard focus.  </s>
<s> Thus, any solution which to make focus and mouseover the same will deny full functionality to people who are not using a mouse (or mouse equivalent).  </s>
<s> This is because if the user has just one focus, s/he will lose his/er keyboard focus when moving the single focus to where mouse focus is needed.  </s>
<s> And visa versa.  </s>
<s> Whats really needed is separate keyboard control of mouse focus, either in the user agent, or in the assistive technology attached to the user agent.  </s>

<s> I am not sure I agree with this position.  </s>
<s> THer are users who just use a mouse.  </s>
<s> There are users who just use a keyboard (or would like to, if software allowed it).  </s>
<s> And there are users who do both.  </s>
<s> While we are at it, we might as well also consider users who have a stylus or touch screen.  </s>
<s> Len is right that in the current model, focus refers to keyboard focus, and mouseover referes to mouse focus.  </s>
<s> My understanding of how this works in the real world is that users have a focus, and a method (or two) of shifting that focus from item to item.  </s>
<s> Unfortunately, programmers have taken the seperate methods of assigning focus and made them work in different and not necessarily compatible ways.  </s>
<s> This, to my mind, is an error, because it fails to account for people who cannot use one or the other method.  </s>
<s> Looking out to the graphical desktop interface that a lot of this stuff came from, we find a slightly different user interface, which leads to the same kinds of functionalities (and some much more powerful ones besides).  </s>
<s> At the same time, it does not make the artificial seperation between mouse users and keyboard users.  </s>
<s> Simply put, they did a better job.  </s>
<s> Not perfect (there are still things that only seem to work in one modality for most such systems), but better.  </s>
<s> So what we need is a new model - one which does not rely on the user having a particular set of input devices and feedback capabilities - and then languages which incorporate this model, and then software which implements it.  </s>
<s> And we do need it - at the moment we are working in systems that disable some users by poor design, rather than externally imposed constraints.  </s>
