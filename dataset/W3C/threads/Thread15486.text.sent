Here is an overview of the results of the accessibility review of HTML4 and CSS2. 
Please use the copy on the Web at to access details of proposals and rationale. 
Thanks, -- Al Gilman for the HC team and the WAI Report of the HTML4/CSS2 Accessibility Review Last revised October 22. 1997 This web page provides a guide to materials supporting the WAI review of HTML4 and CSS2 recommendations nominated by the HC Working Group and reviewed by the WAI Interest Group. 
Pointers to detailed proposals is included. 
The recommendations are summarized very tersely here, and decorated with a few links to influential source materials. 
This page will be maintained to try to keep it within 24 hours of current with respect to current discussion during the period from October 15th to Nov 10th. 
How to use this document Monitor this document at http://www.w3c.org/WAI/group/HC/guide.html. 
Where this document refers to messages in the email archives, please take advantage of the thread index to read related discussion before and after the cited message. 
If discussing these proposals in the HTML or CSS working groups, please cross-post to w3c-wai-hc@w3.org as well. 
Review of the issues The five thread-starters have symbolic names to help keep the discussions straight. 
Please use these naming conventions in your replies to facilitate dialog on the list-serve. 
The threads are: * OPTION -- Making SELECT structures with lots of OPTIONs comprehensible * TABLE -- Making TABLEs comprehensible * DESC -- Text associated with images * REF -- Associating HTML contents with external documents * MEDIA -- Classifying user display and control OPTION -- Making SELECT structures with lots of OPTIONs comprehensible. 
Suggested WAI recommendations from HC Working Group: * A choice of two proposals at the level of functionality comparable to the original proposal. 
* OPTION message sent to the IG mailing list on Oct 16th. 
* Clarify what is actually critical for accessibility in this area by discussion with the Interest Group. 
* Original proposal from Megazone. 
TABLE -- Making TABLEs comprehensible. 
Suggested WAI recommendations from HC Working Group: * TABLE message sent to the IG mailing list on Oct 16th. 
* The baseline operational concept in the HC mail archives should be regarded as having a rough consensus of support. 
The implication is that the HTML should contain enough information for browsers to perform these functions. 
* Seek table reformatting functions from browser providers; refer issue to WAI Browser Guidelines group for further work. 
* add SCOPE attribute. 
* Clarify summary attribute to say that where there is a caption, the summary should be written as if it will be said after the caption. 
* address classes of tables (read by columns, read by rows, etc.) in the markup guidelines using the existing CLASS attribute. 
Refer to WAI Markup Guidelines group for further development, in cooperation with the Browser Guidelines Working Group. 
* Implement LINK and META enhancements in HTML4 to support experimentation by the WAI activities. 
DESC -- Text associated with images Background -- for reference: variety of practices integrating image descriptions and image alternatives with images in hypertext literature. 
See the GL group area. 
Suggested WAI recommendations from HC Working Group: * DESC message sent to the IG mailing list on Oct 16th. 
* Work with LONGDESC on IMG; normally inlined in the absense of image display * ADD TITLE and LONGDESC to FRAME and IFRAME * OBJECT contents scanned for links with AREA on them which function like a MAP entry when the image DATA of the object is displayed. 
REF -- Associating HTML contents with external resources. 
Uses or requirements: * Data publishers may wish to link TABLE to a resource (URL) which clarifies data usage in the table. 
* It is not safe to assume that all tables in one HTML document are to be associated with the same such data dictionary (or rough equivalent). 
* Audio output [in general, not just for persons with disabilities] will want access to pronunciation dictionaries. 
* Acronyms and foreign languages are other applications for such links. 
* Stylesheets selectively applied to quotes etc. Suggested WAI recommendations from HC Working Group: * REF message sent to the IG mailing list on Oct 16th. 
* Seek review from RDF group * Implement at least enough LINK and META enhancements to ensure that dictionaries, including data dictionaries, can be TARGETed to an arbitrary HTML container element. 
MEDIA -- Classifying user display and control Introduction to the MEDIA types issue. 
Suggested WAI recommendations from HC Working Group: * MEDIA message sent to the IG mailing list on Oct 17th. 
* add another top-level media type named either CONSOLE or TTY for character-grid and line-mode displays * change wording around list of predefined MEDIA values to make the list extensible. 
A browser _may_ ignore media indications that do not match this list. 
* Refer further work on how browser should handle this to browser guidelines group. 
Lesser issues The following issues have been discussed in the HC group but appear to be straighforward or otherwise not meriting a lot of discussion in the brief time we have for Interest Group review. 
Preserving the logical reading order of text. 
Example of problems as documented in the TRACE guidelines. 
Suggested WAI recommendations from HC Working Group: * Browser functions to crack tables referred to Browser Guidelines WG for refinement. 
* Explicit order-of-reading markup of text fragments referred to Markup Guidelines working group for consideration. 
LINK and META enhancements to be implemented in in HTML4 to give the guidelines group enough capability to work with. 
For background, search The HC list archives for "order". 
Browse both quarters; the thread runs over. 
Image used as list bullet The issue has to do with text alternatives to list bullets defined by an image file. 
Suggested WAI recommendations from HC Working Group: * No change required to HTML. 
* Continue work with CSS group in Markup Guidelines activity of WAI. 
Controlling dynamic features Gregg Vanderheiden copied over a good summary by Kelly Ford. 
For more background search the webwatch-l digest archive for "dynamism". 
Suggested WAI recommendations from HC Working Group: Refer to Browser Guidelines and Markup Guidelines for further consideration. 
CSS2 review The CSS2 spec being still under development, we haven't reached the same level of reviewing in this area. 
The HC message Regarding CSS2 summarizes our position.

I was expecting a list of proposed changes, complete with suggested wording. 
The examples are good, and maybe those are enough. 
Editors: what do you think? 
Are these proposals clear enough that you can just merge them in, or do you see missing bits or open issues? 
Each of the issues (option, table, desc, ref, media) seems to have several proposals available. 
There are still questions to discuss, etc. 
We have just over a week to incorporate the WAI input on HTML4. 
I don't expect the HTML WG to debate the various proposals, but rather to review and refine the suggested changes. 
In particular, we need something that won't change, or won't change that much. 
But I see: This page will be maintained to try to keep it within 24 hours of current with respect to current discussion during the period from October 15th to Nov 10th. 
Am I off the mark? 
Dan Connolly, W3C HTML Working Group Chair Not to mince words... 
I started out thinking we could do full diff-equivalent proposals. 
Daniel wisely steered us toward a more design-level description. 
The invividual proposals vary in how definitive or how motivated they are in the written record. 
We have assessed these as to need/benefit. 
We expect y'all to apply two grains of salt yet on implementation impact. 
Please ask questions where anything is unclear. 
-- Al Al, I agree with Dan that we need to send unambiguous recommendations to the HTML WG. 
Is it possible to summarize the HC WG results &amp; IG review in a more definitive way? 
I realize after revisiting the status of the "Guide" that the first &amp; last paragraphs of my suggestions to Al &amp; Daniel regarding transmission of the report were contradictory (see first message below). 
Dan, given our awareness of the HTML WG AC deliverable deadline of Oct 31, I think our pointer to a timeline running through Nov 10 is in error. 
Dan, Dave, Daniel, &amp; Al, are you available by any chance at 10 a.m. 
Boston time tomorrow/Thursday, if I can get the MIT bridge, so we can resolve the coordination issues on this quickly? 
- Judy Al, Daniel, Dan and I did not specifically discuss transmission of the report. 
I think sending it as the updated Guide, packaged with the essentials from the relevant threads, seems fine. 
I've just put out a "last call" on the IG list, also with a plea for  more input on LINK and META. 
If we bring in some additional input in  one area after today, perhaps that is still workable.

I think I'm the last champion of the more complex OPTION proposal -the AXIS/AXES one. 
I had started with a container proposal which evolved into a non-container from feedback on the www-html list and others. 
But now it looks like the container proposal we're back to is a better choice. 
Less complex for authors and implementors, and provides most of the functionality. 
As editor on this proposal, unless someone raises an objection, I'm ready to reduce it to the one final proposal.
