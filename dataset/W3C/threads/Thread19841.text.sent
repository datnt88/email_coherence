mathml.h on my computer it is possible to have these files to can compile amaya? 
Regrads Hi Siwar, These files, except windialogapi.c are automatically generated when you compile under Unix. 
But this is not the case under Windows. 
I'm preparing a package including these files and allowing to build Amaya on Windows. 
I will announce that package as soon as it is ready.
