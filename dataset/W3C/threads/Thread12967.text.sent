Hello All, I give an OK to the document but I recommend this change: Under Organizations, the word Sectors is not modified by any word that would indicate what a sector is. 
I think it might not be understandable by itself. 
For example one might write: 'Economic Sectors'.

Okay, but recommend the following changes (please specify): - Under "Consequences" change "Web Developers" to "Web Development" for parallel construction. 
- Agree with William Loughborough that last two bullets under "current situation" are not parallel with the five preceding list items - needs to be finessed.
