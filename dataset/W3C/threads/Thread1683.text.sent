I've noted a couple of mail-related postings in the ACM risks forum. 
This issue is archived at URL:http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/20.79.html (1) In "Risks of bouncing messages from closed e-mail lists", a suggestion that closed mailing list bounces can be used to create a mail loop (I don't think this works, but I may be missing something). 
(2) In "More risks with MS Outlook", a possible issue with multipart/alternative -- something to note in a future "security considerations" section?

You're right, it is nonsense. 
The idea is to get two lists bouncing mail back to each other. 
But this only works if the lists put their address in the envelope from of the bounce message. 
Not only would this be a standards violation, it would be a terribly dumb thing to do. 
The risk of using bounces off lists to relay is also considerably overstated. 
Not only is return of content suppressed a lot more often than this would indicate, getting the "message" as the content of a nondelivery notification is in practice not going to be a very effective means of communicating. 
This is a known issue; the following text is currently in the multipart/alternative description in the MIME specification: Multipart/alternative provides no mechanism that assures that the parts it contains provide equivalent information. 
This gives rise to a security consideration: A message sender, knowing that one recipient will display one part of a multipart/alternative and another will display a different part, could put different information in the two parts, fooling the two recipients into thinking they received the same information when in fact they did not. 
Ned The internal mail system at Tele2 did this...which afterwards is a quite funny story: - The outgoing mail MTA had a limit of size of 5 MB for a message. 
- Incoming MTA had no limit at all. 
- I created a forwarding feature from this mail system on my account to my email address on the internet (yes, we do NOT talk about internet mail here) - Someone sent me a message which was 10 MB large I could say that the rest is left as an exercise to the reader...but here we go: The incoming MTA pass the mail over to my mail account. 
The forwarding mechanism forwarded the mail (added about 100k of junk) and sent the mail to my internet address. 
The outgoing MTA stopped the mail because of size and sent a bounce back to the sender, i.e. my forwarding mechanism, as they act as an agent for the user itself (added about 200k of junk telling what happened). 
The forwarding mechanism on my account got this message, and forwarded it to my internet account. 
Two days later they called me and asked why I don't delete email on this mail system. 
I told them nicely that I don't use it at all, but promised to have a look. 
Luckily the system is slooooow (runs on a specific operating system which probably should not handle this kind of things) so it had only filled one raid with about 12GByte of repeated messages. 
I did "select all - delete", which was an operation which took some 2 hours(!) after which the software on my client side crashed. 
Reboot, and select-all-delete again and 30 minutes later the mail was gone. 
I got a very specific email address after this which doesn't even try to send the message to my mail account from the incoming MTA... paf But at this point the message should have bounced again, but this time the MAIL FROM address should have been blank, so the MTA should have either sent the message to the local postmaster or deleted it entirely. 
Not having this happen means either you're the postmaster or there's a standards violation in there somewhere... Now, I'm not saying such violations don't occur. 
They do. 
For example, when forwarding mail back out Exchange will change a blank MAIL FROM to the address of the message forwarder. 
This is far and away the most common source of loops we see these days.
