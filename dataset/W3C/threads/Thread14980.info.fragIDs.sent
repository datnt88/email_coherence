<s> chaals [snip] However, I am wondering if this checkpoint is inherently fraught with difficulty.  </s>
<s> Are assumptions inherent in the success criteria that we must consider?  </s>
<s> CMN There are some assumptions underlying the proposed criteria, as with all criteria.  </s>
<s> In this case they are assumptions about what makes content easier to read and understand for people with literacy problems.  </s>
<s> Some of these are based on published research, some on simple testing... (Consider the success criteria for any other checkpoint, and try to determine as many of the assumptions as possible).  </s>
<s> Bob Are we presuming that each piece of content is instructional in nature?  </s>
<s> CMN No, not as far as I am aware.  </s>
<s> That would be a bad assumption.  </s>
<s> Bob For example, is it possible for a piece of fiction to comply?  </s>
<s> While the language in the checkpoint allows for context, the language of the success criteria is much more specific.  </s>
<s> How can the success criteria be communicated to publishers of fiction on the web?  </s>
<s> CMN It is possible for fiction to comply.  </s>
<s> It is possible that not all fiction will comply.  </s>
<s> It is unlikely, for example, that a piece of deliberately complex language, such as that used in Finnegan's Wake by James Joyce, would be re-edited to be accessible.  </s>
<s> (Hmmm, maybe that is a bad example, as it is not accessible to most people I know who have tried to read it).  </s>
<s> If we start by assuming that we are producing guidelines that will ensure that all kinds of content are accessible, we will produce guidelines that achieve their stated goal, but do not help people access content.  </s>
<s> If we produce guidelines for how content can be made accessible we need to recognise that not all content will be made accessible.  </s>
<s> Different people, and different societies, have different standards for deciding whether or not they will require a particular object, service, etc to be accessible and how much impact they believe is acceptable.  </s>
<s> It is a truism that having to have a ramp at the front of a building makes a big impact on a design that envisages a pure sweep of 100 small, regular steps across the entire front of the building.  </s>
<s> Does this mean that anyone who cannot climb 100 steps should be made tofind an alternative entrance to the hospital, in order to preserve the essential integrity of the design?  </s>
<s> (what if it was only 5 steps, or 2?) There isn't a universal answer to this kind of question.  </s>
<s> But we as a group can say "if you want all people to be able to get into the hospital, you need to have a smooth entrance from the street, at least".  </s>
<s> (We could probably do even better than that - "make the door wide enough for a large wheelchair, light enough or automatic to allow frail people to open it, etc...") Bob Similarly, I edit an online journal for educators in Portuguese speaking countries.  </s>
<s> The journal articles we published are from established scholars whose work frequently is not easily summarized or even understood.  </s>
<s> Is it possible for this journal to comply?  </s>
<s> CMN Yes.  </s>
<s> How well it will comply to this requirement (and for that matter to any requirement) depends to some extent on the skills of the scholars you are working with, and yourself.  </s>
<s> (Assuming that you are prepared to make this content accessible, or that the journal decides that is a requirement) Bob My more general concern with this checkpoint is that once it is dismissed as not feasible, it casts a shadow over the other checkpoints as well.  </s>
<s> This attempt at constructing success criteria, while very accurately capturing the goals inherent in the checkpoint also points to the broader difficulty with the checkpoint itself.  </s>
<s> CMN I agree, except if you are suggesting that the checkpoint is dismissed as unfeasible, rather than pointing out that if, in a hypothetical situation, it was dismissed as such then we would have a problem.  </s>
<s> Much more important in my opinion, I don't think it is an issue at all limited to this checkpoint - a quick look at the endless discussions about what text alternatives should be provided on the Interest Group List shows that for most checkpoints, we end up relying to some extent on the judgement and interpretation of an individual, and we can see that until there are lots of examples of "doing it right", or "doing it wrong" that include explanations of why they are good or bad, those interpretations and judgements are likely to lead to widely variant results.  </s>
<s> Consider something apparently clear, like "use code validly, according to specification".  </s>
<s> I would suggest that the HTML 4.01 specification for the element "samp" is not itself using the element according to specification..  </s>
<s> Although that document uses HTML better than most documents do.  </s>
<s> Valid syntax is trivially straightforward to test.  </s>
<s> (In most cases).  </s>
<s> But testing services can disagree, although most would agree that there is a lot of invalid code produced automatically for the web by systems designed by experts, in the absence of even a simple argument that this is to remain compatible with some bug in software that users haven't been able to have fixed for them.  </s>
<s> Bob I would encourage us to writing a much broader description that points to understanding a page's audience and highlights issues for folks with cognitive disabilities or else reconsidering the checkpoint altogether.  </s>
<s> CMN I think that having broader descriptions, and new attempts at success criteria, are certainly required before we have enough material (and examples) to be satisfied.  </s>
<s> Until that time (which I guess is when we are ready to publish a last call draft), this and all other checkpoints are under constant reconsideration unless explicitly declared off limits by the chair.  </s>
<s> cheers chaals  </s>
<s> For this checkpoint it is important to read our mandate.  </s>
<s> Otherwise we will never include it.  </s>
<s> If we do not like our mandate then it is that that we must change.  </s>
<s> Also we are producing guidelines to aid accessibility, but we are not policy makers.  </s>
<s> The policy makers must chouse what checkpoints are appropriate for their situation.  </s>
<s> I think a journal can and should comply to this checkpoint.  </s>
<s> It does not stipulate that the content has to be trivial, but that the stylistic chouses should be accessible.  </s>
<s> People capable of understanding the content should be given access to it and not bard by unnecessary use of unclear style.  </s>
<s> We could add that were the purpose of a page is informative and not stylistic.  </s>
<s> so that a uploaded version of Shakespeare still complies, but I think that that is included in the statement "appropriate for the content".  </s>
<s> That should be clear that a review of Shakespeare will contain quotes that are unclear.  </s>
<s> However the review and explanation should attempt to be clear.  </s>
