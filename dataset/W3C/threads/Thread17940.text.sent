Hello, Checkpoints 4.13 and 4.14 of "Determining Conformance to the User Agent Guidelines 1.0" are: Checkpoint 4.13 Allow the user to configure how the selection is highlighted (e.g., foreground and background color). 
Checkpoint 4.14 Allow the user to configure how the content focus is highlighted (e.g., foreground and background color). 
I propose for both of these the following requirements: 1) The UA must allow for at least one highlight mechanism that doesn't rely on color alone. 
2) The UA should follow applicable system conventions for selection and focus rendering. 
3) The UA may satisfy this checkpoint by implementing the CSS ':focus' pseudo-element.

An example of a mechanism that does not rely on colour is a border or underline. 
Otherwise, I agree.

I split them into "must", "should" and "may", where the minimal requirement is number 1: "must".

This doesn't rely on CSS markup in the page - it can be implemented by the UA, and a user style sheet provided with the UA. 
It can also be done by some equivalent mechanism. 
(Much like font control is done now in some browsers).
