As always, after substantive changes in Pubrules, editors will have a 30-day grace period (starting with the announcement of the change) before the change will be enforced by the Comm Team. 
During the 30-day period, editors may publish documents that conform to either the old [1] or new [2] pubrules. 
The grace period for these changes expires Friday 24 May 2002.
