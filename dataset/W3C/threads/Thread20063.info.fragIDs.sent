<s> I'm trying to use amaya to edit a very simple page...I created the page in amaya, linked it to a stylesheet and defines some styles (classes)...I can't seem to get amaya to show the classes in the apply class dialog box....  </s>
<s> It does work when I pull up http://www.w3c.org http://www.w3c.org  </s>
<s> I'm very confused and I've tried everything I can think of...I have a feeling it's something very stupid that I am overlooking  </s>
<s> Any help would be appreciated...  </s>
<s> BTW: Is there any interest of in having libwww and amaya ported to java?  </s>

<s> In the current version, Amaya build the list of classes that are already used in the document.  </s>
<s> In fact it should list classes used in the document and classes defined by a CSS rule.  </s>
<s> We plan to change that in the next release.  </s>
<s> It's a huge work and I don't think it worths doing that.  </s>

<s> [DJW:] I would have thought that W3C's Jigsaw project already had something like a Java libwww.  </s>

<s> Based on what I've read and the code I've looked at (Haven't looked at jigsaw code)...Jigsaw is all server stuff (libraries, etc...) and libwww provides mostly client side implimentation of various internet releated protocols...  </s>
<s> Some of these things may be available in various java packaes already...But I don't know of any single consoliated, open source .jar  </s>
<s> file that would provide all of the functionality of libwww (any maybe more).  </s>
<s> Also my real goal, when I started thinking about this, was to port amaya to java, so we (the user community) could have one code base across all platforms (well, mostly) and brush up on my programming skills (again) in java (again).  </s>
<s> When I downloaded the amaya source code I saw libwww in a directory and am making the BIG assumption that it (amaya) relies on libwww a lot.  </s>
<s> So I took a look at libwww and saw that there is a HUGE wealth of client side protocols supported there.... Anyway what does everyone think?  </s>

<s> [DJW:] The Jigsaw code, or at least some W3C Java code must implement some client side functions, as it is also used by the CSS validator, which is Java.  </s>

<s> In our previous episode, Muller, Edward said:  </s>
<s> Jigsaw also includes client-side HTTP features that are used when it acts as a proxy.  </s>
<s> In fact, a web publishing tool called Winnie uses those classes as an HTTP library.  </s>
<s> So, you don't need to reimplement libwww in Java as there's an existing solution.  </s>
