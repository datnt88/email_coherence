<s> Hi, this is only slightly related to the header registry... RFC2774 (HTTP extension framework) seems to define the concept of extension  </s>
<s> headers in custom namespaces (which is a good thing because it makes name  </s>
<s> management much easier).  </s>
<s> HTTP headers which are used without using the HTTP  </s>
<s> extension framework (those collected in the registry) all share the same default namespace (or are in no namespace at all).  </s>
<s> I think it would be a good thing if there would be a common definition of  </s>
<s> the namespace in which the registered HTTP headers reside, for instance "urn:ietf:http-headers".  </s>
<s> This would also simplify mapping of HTTP headers to  </s>
<s> WebDAV property names.  </s>
