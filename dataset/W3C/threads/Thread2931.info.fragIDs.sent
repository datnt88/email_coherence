NOTE: The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility. 
To use this feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE" command. 
To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or a MIME-compliant mail reader. 
Different MIME-compliant mail readers exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with "multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on how to manipulate these messages. 
Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the Internet-Draft. 
This draft will be submitted as the initial values for the HTTP header registries; please have a look over it for accuracy and completeness (accuracy is more important at this stage). 
Much of the data is machine-generated from the RFC2629 citation library [1]. 
Please contact me 
directly if you have any corrections or questions. 
The draft is long, so it may be easier to browse the HTML version [2], generated from the same page.

Hi, this is only slightly related to the header registry... RFC2774 (HTTP extension framework) seems to define the concept of extension 
headers in custom namespaces (which is a good thing because it makes name 
management much easier). 
HTTP headers which are used without using the HTTP 
extension framework (those collected in the registry) all share the same default namespace (or are in no namespace at all). 
I think it would be a good thing if there would be a common definition of 
the namespace in which the registered HTTP headers reside, for instance "urn:ietf:http-headers". 
This would also simplify mapping of HTTP headers to 
WebDAV property names.

Perhaps urn:ietf:http:headers so that other things like methods, status codes, message types, etc. could be identified as well (just a suggestion, I'm no URN expert).
