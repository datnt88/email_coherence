We are in the process of redesigning our web site. 
Are there consultants available who can sit down with our programmers and designers and make sure we are meeting all the guidelines? 
Our beta site was Bobby approved. 
However, now that we've entered our second round of development and have designers and programmers in house, it would be an easier solution for us to have someone on staff to work on the accessibility issues. 
Any direction would be appreciated.

Tom, I would recommend Pat McFarland. 
He hosts a discussion group that brings together webmasters and the disabled to talk about issues of accessibility head to head. 
He is quite knowledgable. 
You can e-mail him at blindworld@usa.net.
