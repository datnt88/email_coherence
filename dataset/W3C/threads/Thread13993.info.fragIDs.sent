Issue 1 Discussion: "Comments" section. 
I don't like the sentence that says: "We cannot guarantee a personal response but we will try when it is appropriate." 
Basically, this means: we can ignore your comment/request if we want, and that's not acceptable. 
We need to point people to an up-to-date "issue list" document where *all* the issues raised are stored 
together with their status (need more discussion, ok to be incorporated, no for this and this reason, etc) and their origination (author, date, pointer to message/thread). 
Action: The sentence was deleted. 
A document has been created in response to your request, from which this is excerpted. 
References: Issue 2 
Discussion: Comment1: Section 2 Recommendation 5. We should also add 
"descriptive link title", or "description anchor title" to disambiguate 
with the IMG title.(the 
example is clear, but it's dropped from the checklist for instance) Comment2: this might make the guideline confusing. 
The checklist is to remind them. 
The guidelines includes the example if there is confusion. 
Do you see it as a big problem? 
Action: no action taken at this time pending further discussion. 
References: Issue 3 Discussion: Section 12 Recommendation 12. Test the site with at least: a text only browser (such as Lynx) a self-voicing browser (such as PWWebspeak) I think requiring lynx is OK (given web ready lynx-it service) but self voicing is unrealistic. 
Action: Created a new bullet that says, "It may also be helpful to test your site with a self-voicing browser (such as PWWebspeak)." 
References: Issue 4 Discussion: We should probably advise people to use the OBJECT element and not APPLET. 
Action: Note added to recommendation concerning APPLET element that says it has been deprecated.

Good. Could you give the URL ? 
(or put a link to it in the GL home page) 
Why would this make the guideline or checklist confusing since it adds more context ? 
I think there is a real risk of misunderstanding and using the IMG title. 
We will be posting the actionlog and latest working draft this afternoon. 
They will both be linked to from the GL home page. 
confusion. 
changed to: All images used as links have descriptive link titles.
