<s> I was somewhat amused to see that the CSS2 spec at: is all but unreadable.  </s>
<s> The problem is that it's setting a background image, but not specifying link colours.  </s>
<s> So my browser's default pale green links are all but invisible against your pale blue background!  </s>
<s> Can you either remove the background image, or give some suitable styles to your anchors, so they contrast better with the background?  </s>

<s> Hello,  </s>
<s> Unfortunately, our policy prevents us from changing the already published document.  </s>
<s> Our specifications no longer use this  </s>
<s> background for good reason...  </s>
<s> You can download the first page of the specification and in the HTML change: to:  </s>
<s> I note that the chapters after the cover page do not use the background image.  </s>

<s> Hmmm.  </s>
<s> I can see why, yet this is purely a presentational change.  </s>
<s> Isn't the point of CSS to separate content from presentation, so that presentation can be changed without affecting the content?  </s>
<s> Adding anchor styles to "styles/default.css" would in no way change the spec, but *would* make it more readable in some cases.  </s>
<s> Surely in the CSS spec of all places, this should have been: in the first place :-) Tet  </s>
<s> The background image is in the .html  </s>
<s> (not specified with style sheets).  </s>
<s> W3C's policy is currently that we don't change published specifications, for archival reasons.  </s>
<s> ...except that most user agents didn't support this feature (I believe) on the day we published the Recommendation so it would not have worked... _ Ian Ian Jacobs (ij@w3.org)  </s>

<s> True, but there *is* still an external style sheet included, which could be changed to add anchor styles (i.e., leave the background image in place, but ensure that the links are readable against that background).  </s>
<s> Tet  </s>
<s> I don't think we will change our archived publication.  </s>
<s> However, you can include a user style sheet in your browser to override the default stylings.  </s>
<s> I apologize for this inconvenience.  </s>
