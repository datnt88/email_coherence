These 404s are very peculiar. 
I wish I had the faintest idea what could be going on. 
From my end it all seems to be working, and I can't begin to fix a problem I can't replicate. 
I wish I wasn't ill and I was in the office where I could start trying to sort this out right away. 
Could I ask people to have another go at it, and let me know if it *still* isn't working? 
It is possible that this is a server side issue which will have righted itself in the interim since your last visit. 
If not, please let me know as many details as possible and I'll try and initiate some process of working out why Betsie works for some people but not others. 
It should have nothing to do with the software being used on the client side, so frankly I'm mystified. 
I still want to get it fixed though. 
Thankyou for your help, Cheers etc., Wayne Please accept my apologies for the 404s. 
We had a server problem. 
It's been fixed now and Betsie should be working wherever you are. 
Cheers etc., Wayne I'm using IE 4.01 here in the US - not having any problems. 
Very cool stuff!
