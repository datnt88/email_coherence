Hi Phil, Nice to hear from you. 
I'd be happy to send information about our use of OWL, however I think they already have it since BioPAX (www.biopax.org) is already listed on the W3C site (http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/WebOnt/impls#Implementations). 
That being said and assuming I can't help the cause in that way, and not wanting to break the chain so to speak, I am forwarding your message to Peter Karp and Holger Knublauch. 
Peter Karp, (SRI, International) is working on the release of an open source version of the GKB Editor with OWL support. 
Holger, as you know is the author of the OWL plugin for the Protege editor. 
Perhaps they would add the request to their download site and more users of OWL would know to send in their information. 
Warmest regards, Joanne Joanne Luciano BioPAX Workgroup Member BioPathways Consortium co-organizer 45 Orchard Street Belmont, MA 02478-3008 jluciano@biopathways.org Matt, Joanne From your respective talks at bio ontologies this year, I know that both of your groups are using, or are starting to use OWL within your projects. 
I'm forwarding a request from Jim Hendler, via Ian Horrocks, who are both members of the web ontology W3C group. 
They are trying to keep up with who is using OWL, and for what. 
An important part of the W3C process is having solid examples of where people are using the technology. 
They would be very grateful if you could forward a short message explaining what you are doing with OWL to their mailing list described below. 
Cheers Phil Ian It would be helpful if you or anyone you know who is using OWL Ian would post a brief message to public-webont-comments@w3.org Ian with a pointer or short explanation of the application. 
Ian Thanks, Ian Ian Ian From: Jim Hendler hendler@cs.umd.edu

Ian Everyone - Ian this is REALLY important -- I've been running into more and Ian more Ian people who are actually using OWL and not telling anyone about Ian it -- I would like everyone in the WG to find someone you know Ian using OWL and tell them to send mail to Ian public-webont-comments@w3.org with a pointer to their Ian application. 
Then ask them to do the same... Ian Seriously, the W3C AC is currently being very tough on Ian Proposed Ian Recommendations, and I think our showing just how many people Ian are really using OWL at this point will help a tremendous Ian amount. 
Ian We must all spread the word that people shouldn't just be Ian using OWL, Ian but also letting us know that they are!

Great - thanks. 
Ian Matt, Joanne From your respective talks at bio ontologies this year, I know that I have added a note to the main page of the OWL Plugin, and to the ontology library site: "Note: The WebOnt W3C working group would like to hear about projects that are using OWL ontologies. 
Please share your experience and link your project with the Semantic Web community by sending an email to the public-webont-comments@w3.org mailing list." 
Hope that helps Holger FYI, The download page for BioPAX now also contains the following note The asterisk appears above this text where the OWL version of BioPAX and the Protege OWL plugin are mentioned.
