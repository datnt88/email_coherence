<s> I hope so.  </s>
<s> Since Bobby is often proposed as a "validator" to be used by authors, and by inference by their tools, it might be significant to know if the folks at CAST have, e.g., studied any relationship between the tools used to author web sites (which is often contained in the document) and the resulting accessibility, and if so what they've learned and if they have communicated this to the authoring tool makers?  </s>
