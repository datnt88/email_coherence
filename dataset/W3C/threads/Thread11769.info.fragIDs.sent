As the GL and AU documents have evolved they seem more utile. 
Their utility, however must be judged by their audience, which most of us are not. 
Are we getting more potential users of them into our fold? 
Has Chuck Opperman showed them to anybody on the FrontPage, etc. teams? 
Did Loren ask others at SoftQuad for comments? 
Did T.V. Raman bring them to 
the attention of Adobe (who just acquired a major toolworks)? 
Have the CAST people been brought to bear on the relationship between Bobby and the website generators? 
Etc., etc.? 
For me, specific comments would be completely vain but it is clear that the main points are included and there is a nice "intelligence" about the entire undertaking, but will the dogs eat it?

WL:: "Have the CAST people been brought to bear..." BK: "Can you clarify what you mean by this statement?" 
I hope so. 
Since Bobby is often proposed as a "validator" to be used by authors, and by inference by their tools, it might be significant to know if the folks at CAST have, e.g., studied any relationship between the tools used to author web sites (which is often contained in the document) and the resulting accessibility, and if so what they've learned and if they have communicated this to the authoring tool makers? 
Love.

Has Chuck Opperman showed them to anybody on the FrontPage, etc. teams? 
I am reviewing the material on behalf of all the HTML generators at Microsoft, including FrontPage. 
That product team is well aware of accessible design principles and I meet with them regularly about the accessibility of the product and the content it creates. 
The next version, FrontPage 2000, already available in beta, shows improvements in key areas of the HTML generated. 
Please let me know if you have any concerns about the accessibility of any Microsoft product.

MS Word 2000 produces some pretty overwhelming code. 
Is it actually accessible?

MS Word 2000 produces some pretty overwhelming code. 
Is it actually accessible? 
That's fairly vague question. 
We have tried to make the HTML as compatible with existing standards as possible. 
If you have any feedback regarding the generated HTML, we'd really like to hear about it.

"2.1 ...The first step towards accessibility is interoperability..." What does this mean? 
It means that if cannot understand the language, you cannot present it to the user. 
To take a concrete and relevant example. 
Supposed I define an XML DTD: DDML, with the following element What are you doing to do with it as a UA developer ? 
Nothing til you know it's a multimedia piece, with bits being the animation bits and alaplace being the textual equivalent. 
It is accessible markup in itself, since I provide a way to hook an accessible version of my multimedia piece, but since its semantics is not defined in any published spec, it's only accessible to those who use my reader for instance. 
Interoperability means it has a published specification that allows one to write a reader independently of the authoring process. 
Accessibility means this reader can serve any media.
