Our next topic for RDIG will be Visualization and we are planning for December 3 as the tentative event date. 
We should begin moving toward a completed call for position papers during the next few weeks. 
To refresh our memories, please review the first call for position papers [1]. 
We will discuss a draft call for the visualization topic on Monday, September 8, and continue on the list during the week. 
You may also want to review some of the messages on the list relating to visualization [2] [3].

I will try to get a position paper together for it anyway.

Could we please have a little more detail on the proposed Visualisation meeting? 
There may be some part of our work on the peepo project that would be suitable for this topic. 
It would be helpful if we could help define this early on. 
It is likely to be closely related to the work carried out at SWAD-E It would be helpful if scenarios included: Online virtual environments: games, chatrooms(habbohotel), web-directories(peepo), musical(1) assumptions about navigation relationships between images: redbus and bin-cat-owl (2) problem of illustrating generic topics such as 'humanities' transparently Is there a likely time for Dec 3rd? 
thanks Jonathan 1http://www.braunarts.com/3dmusic/navigation14of10.html there are many others 2 redbus: if your local bus is green, then it will be harder to generalise a redbus, similarly double/single decker bin-cat-owlgarbage can + cat is different to owl + cat, this can be helpful, however cartesian coordinates also.....
