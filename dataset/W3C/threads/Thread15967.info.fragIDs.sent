I copied the sample code for an accessible image map into Microsoft FrontPage 98. Instantly, it converted the code into a web bot component. 
This component strips out the MAP, AREA, and Alt text code. 
Has this happend to anyone else? 
Is there anyway to stop FrontPage from doing this? 
Here is what I copied: AREA shape="rect" coords="0,0,30,30" href="reference.html" 
alt="Reference" AREA shape="rect" coords="34,34,100,100" href="media.html" 
alt="Audio visual lab" Here is what FrontPage 98 did to it: p !--webbot bot="ImageMap" rectangle=" (0,0) (30,30) reference.html" 
rectangle=" (34,34) (100,100) media.html" 
src="welcome.gif" 
alt="Image map of areas in the library" -- /p This conversion makes the image map inaccessible! 
Does anyone have any thoughts on this? 
Solutions? 
Help! FrontPage is used extensively by the State of Iowa, and I need to tell other State web developers how to make their image maps accessible.

You HAVE to use the insert HTML part of FrontPage (Insert  FrontPage Component...  insert HTML). 
It causes FrontPage to ignore the included HTML coding. 
Not doing so causes FrontPage to "fix" the HTML code as it sees fit. 
An example implementation of this can be seen at This is a prime example of why the WAI AG group has such an important mission.

... 

Yes, it's happened to me and Yes, if you handcode the HTML. 
There was discussion on this last fall in the newgroup news://msnews.microsoft.com/microsoft.public.frontpage.client. 
Try searching DejaNews for messages from me in that newsgroup with keywords "imagemap" and "hotspot".
