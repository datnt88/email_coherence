<s> Hello, It's been debated often, I suspect; yet, if my experience means anything,  </s>
<s> much disagreement exists about the "true" accessibility of pdfs on the web.  </s>
<s> Certainly, Adobe has promoted the application and worked diligently to make  </s>
<s> them accessible, but others - such as Jakob Nielsen - suggest avoiding pdfs  </s>
<s> for on-screen delivery.  </s>
<s> I know there are definite usability issues, but how does this group stand  </s>
<s> on the accessibility of PDFs?  </s>

<s> I agree with Jakob Nielsen, though some people really like PDF's.  </s>
<s> I tend to  </s>
<s> get annoyed when I click on a link and a PDF suddenly starts slowly appearing  </s>
<s> without warning.  </s>
<s> I believe to meet WAI priority 1 checkpoints, an HTML version is required.  </s>
<s> The  </s>
<s> new more accessible PDF's that can be created with Adobe 5.0 and the Make  </s>
<s> Accessible Plugin are definitely an improvement over the old ones for screen  </s>
<s> readers, and if I understand this correctly, I believe that they alone will  </s>
<s> satisfy Section 508 without an alternative, though an HTML version is still  </s>
<s> recommended.  </s>
<s> As a web developer, I'm afraid that those of us who want to make our sites as  </s>
<s> accessible as possible are now in the position of not only having to create an  </s>
<s> HTML version, which can be easy or very time consuming (depending on what we  </s>
<s> have to start with), but also to make sure the PDF is itself accessible, which  </s>
<s> can also be easy or very time consuming, depending on how the PDF was created,  </s>
