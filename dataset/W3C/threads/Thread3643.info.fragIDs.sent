<s> Jungshik [1] I should have turned to BTW, the second method of setting the page encoding in JSP is not mentioned in the above tip.  </s>
<s> Hi Jungshik,  </s>
<s> I think you're forgetting what happens to a JSP page.  </s>
<s> You can't just have the JSP container omit to mention the charset in the HTTP header because the encoding is important in the lifecycle of a JSP page: JSP pages are compiled into servlets.  </s>
<s> That is, they are turned into a small Java program that  </s>
<s> generates the HTML.  </s>
<s> The HTML content in a JSP page just becomes a series of Java String objects inside the servlet.  </s>
<s> The Strings must be converted back to bytes using some encoding (since Strings are UTF-16 based Java objects).  </s>
<s> You set the encoding used for this conversion with the page contentType directive.  </s>
<s> So you see: if you don't tell JSP container's servlet generate what encoding you want, it has to make some assumption.  </s>
<s> There is another part to this process as well: you have to generate the  </s>
<s> servlet (i.e. those String objects) to begin with.  </s>
<s> Parsing the HTML to look for a META tag is not a really reliable solution.  </s>
<s> So unless the file is  </s>
<s> entirely ASCII to begin with, you have to tell the JSP container how to read the bytes in the file to generate the servlet.  </s>
<s> This is what the pageEncoding directive does.  </s>
<s> One could argue with the choice of Latin-1 as the JSP default, but any other  </s>
<s> encoding, including UTF-8, wouldn't really solve the problem: people want to use legacy encodings from time to time as well.  </s>
<s> Setting the page encoding and content type should just be automatically part of what a JSP developer does in every page.  </s>

<s> Behalf Of Jungshik Shin Sent: dimanche 30 novembre 2003 08:49 Subject: JSP containers and default charset (was: Re DefaultCharset considered harmful)  </s>
<s> Hi Addison,  </s>
<s> You're absolutely right.  </s>
<s> Therefore, the charset declaration in a JSP file serves dual purposes.  </s>
<s> It indicates the character encoding of the JSP file to the Java compiler (i.e. playing the same role as '-encoding' option when invoking 'javac') and it also indicates in what character encoding the generated html file should be served to the outside world.  </s>
<s> Someone might argue that there need to be two separate 'directives' for two roles, but I guess it's all right to overload pageEncoding directive.  </s>
<s> Yup, I can't agree with you more.  </s>
<s> I was labelling ASCII only files as UTF-8, which is why I didn't realize that when I wrote the message.  </s>
<s> Thanks, Jungshik  </s>
<s> Hi Jungshik,  </s>
<s> Not quite: there are two directives: pageEncoding and contentType and they can indicate *different* encodings.  </s>
<s> If you use pageEncoding on its own, it is assumed that the encoding of the source JSP file should be the encoding used to deliver the file.  </s>
<s> If you use contentType on its own, then the page is delivered in the encoding specified, but read as Latin-1.  </s>
<s> If you want to use one encoding (say KS-X-1001) for the JSP file and a different encoding for the delivery (say UTF-8) then you can use both directives together.  </s>
<s> For example, see Norbert Lindeberg's excellent article here:  </s>
<s> SP/ In addition, the pageEncoding is how the JSP container reads the .jsp  </s>
<s> file in, but the resulting servlet may not be written in the specified encoding (e.g. the javac invocation might not use an -encoding directive).  </s>
<s> One more note: if your JSP page reads data from a HttpServletRequest object, you may have to call the setCharacterEncoding() method on that object before retrieving parameters sent to your JSP page via GET or POST.  </s>
<s> Best Regards, Addison  </s>
<s> Hi Addison, Thanks for the clarification.  </s>
<s> The more I wrote about it, the clearer it became how ignorant I am about JSP (which I took up just a week ago).  </s>
<s> Here's one thing I know more than you do :-).  </s>
<s> KS X 1001 is not a character encoding scheme but just a coded character set without Latin letters, numbers and punctuations so that on its own it's virtually useless.  </s>
<s> It always has to be used along with US-ASCII (ISO 646:IRV)/ISO-646:KR in CES'(character encodings/MIME charset) like EUC-KR and ISO-2022-KR.  </s>
<s> That is, virtually NONE of Korean text can be written  </s>
<s> with characters drawn _only_ from KS X 1001.  </s>
<s> When it comes to JSP, it's even more so because all those ASCII charcters are NOT covered by KS X 1001 unless javac somehow can understand double/full width Latin letters, numbers and punctuations in KS X 1001, which I don't think is the case.  </s>
<s> ... snip (good tips/advices) ... Thanks again for the reference and tips.  </s>
<s> BTW, wouldn't it be nice if it's possible to specify the DTP with a a macro for my editor so that I can enter DTDs for xhtml 1.0 and html 4.x strict/loose rather easily when I edit html/xhtml/jsp files, but a simple JSP directive would make it a lot more pages (generated by JSP) compliant to the standard in that they have the DTD declared.  </s>
<s> By the same token, it'd be nice (although not necessary because the http header is emitted to that effect) if 'contentType' directive with __'text/html; if not present (the same is true of PHP.  </s>
<s> I don't know what ASP does here.) I realize that both are rather tricky to implement given the way JSP files are processed (as you explained in great details) before they're delivered.  </s>
<s> Maybe, we just have to live with having to add DTD declation manually.  </s>
<s> Jungshik  </s>
<s> You're right.  </s>
<s> I was trying to avoid the old "ksc5601 is obsolete" issue.  </s>
<s> I suppose I could have said "MS949" or "EUC-KR"... :-).  </s>

<s> Hello Addison, others, One very specific question about JSP: Is it possible (and if yes, how) to produce an XML file where the correct encoding is automatically put into the encoding pseudo-attribute of the XML declaration?  </s>
<s> Also, is it possible (and how) to use the mechanisms provided (rather than doing everything on your own) and produce a HTTP response without a 'charset' parameter on the Content-Type response header?  </s>
<s> Regards, Martin.  </s>
<s> I'm sorry to resurrect an old thread, but recently I stumbled upon this issue once more.  </s>
<s> Besides, for those who would come across this issue in the future, we may have to add it to the appropriate sections of our authoring tech document (where 'form' and 'character encoding specification' are dealt with) along with what's to be done with this in other popular server-side 'scripts'/cgi (asp, perl, etc)  </s>
<s> With recent versions of Apache tomcat 4.1.29 and 5.x, I found that request.setCharacterEncoding()  </s>
<s> doesn't have any effect for GET by default because it treats the URI as if it's in ISO-8859-1 whatever you do with setCharacterEncoding() (setCharacterEncoding() normally only applies to the request body NOT the URI.).  </s>
<s> For POST, it works just fine.  </s>
<s> By setting 'useBodyEncodingForURI' attribute to true in server.xml  </s>
<s> for the http/1.1  </s>
<s> connector, we can get setCharacterEncoding() applied to GET as well.  </s>
<s> The following bugzilla entries for apache mention two other methods.  </s>
