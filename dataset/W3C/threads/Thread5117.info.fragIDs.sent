<s> GetData shell script is called as GetData subject property inverse prefix suffix Actual Java program is shown in http://rhm.cdepot.net/bin/GetData.  </s>
<s> Note that I am using your SuperClass and SubClass search flags.  </s>
<s> In each case, the subject is "AthleteJordan,_Michael".  </s>
<s> For retrieving all the properties, property is "domain" and inverse is "yes".  </s>
<s> For retrieving the individual properties, the properties are "type", "title", "plays", "playsForTeam" and inverse is "no".  </s>
<s> GetData is called by http://rhm.cdepot.net/bin/mkrGetData, whose arguments are an MKR question minus the terminating semicolon.  </s>
<s> I will try some variations on these names.  </s>
<s> You want to use "arcs" to find properties that an object has, and "arcs, inverse=yes" for properties that point to an object.  </s>
<s> Domain only applies to classes, which may be counterintuitive.  </s>
<s> Can you try that and let me know how it goes?  </s>
