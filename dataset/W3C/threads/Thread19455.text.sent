Hi there, Since Version 1.3a amaya is unable to handle calls to cgi scripts with cmdline args correctly. 
When i try 'amaya http://jusa.telco-tech.de/cgi-bin/LINKS?Development' aamya crashes with '*** Thot: Irrecoverable error ***'. 
When i call this by clicking a URL I can see the correct call in the addressline but the script is called without the cmdlineargs. 
I have tried this with the precompiled version on a linux-2.0.34 (lib5) machine and with a handmade version (libc6/lesstif) on a linux-2.0.35 machine privat: g.tenchio(AT)snafu.de

When I click with the mouse in the adressfield and hit enter also the browser gives the correct output.

I have the impression that when you type the command string, your shell is intercepting the ? 
char. 
Try to execute it again enclosing the arguments to amaya inside quotes: amaya "http://your-url?parameters" 
Could you tell me if this works now? 
This doesn't explain the crash you reported. 
If you compiled under debug, could you mail me a stack trace after the crash? 
Thanks for your feedback, -Jose In our previous episode, gernot@telco-tech.de 
said: Hi, I have tried it with enclosing the arguments and the result is the same like before. 
The problem is it works with amaya 1.2/1.3. 
Only since version 1.3a this error occurs. 
I think it must be an internal error because i can see the complete URL (http://...?whatever) in amaya's adressline. 
When i can find the time to recompile amaya i will send more informations.
