<s> Perhaps it's time we looked at some of the more complex guidelines.  </s>
<s> Can we start off with Guideline 5 - "Create tables that transform gracefully"?  </s>
<s> Technique 5.1 - Check for row and column headers (Actually this table technique seems quite straightforward.) Chris  </s>
<s> The guideline specifies that there should be row and/or column headers for *data* tables only.  </s>
<s> Shouldn't there be headers for tables used for layout?  </s>
<s> How could we determine if the table was a data table or a layout table?  </s>
<s> Chris  </s>
<s> No, see Checkpoint 5.4.  </s>
<s> Heuristics.  </s>
<s> Most tables are layout today.  </s>
<s> Likely to have size specified (width, height), colspan, no border.  </s>
<s> Data table are likely to have tr and borders.  </s>
<s> Another heuristic: layout tables typically have  </s>
<s> border=0 padding=0 spacing=0 especially if cells contain images.  </s>
<s> These are needed to avoid spaces between images.  </s>

<s> yes, and cell with images is another good criteria for layout table.  </s>

<s> Sure, data tables will have HR ;)  </s>
