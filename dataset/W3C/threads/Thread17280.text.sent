Hi, Can anyone recommend or comment on the accessibility and usability of these three web mail applications. 
NeoMail SquirrelMail Horde They are used in so many places. 
I use Horde occassionally, which is used by my current ISP. 
I'm also interested in any type of feedback on these products, it would be greatly appreciated. 
Geoff Our organization uses SquirrelMail for web-based access, and Eudora or desktop access to email. 
The only accessibility that I've checked out is the ability to TAB between elements on the screen, which it does nicely. 
It is pretty straight-forward and user-friendly. 
Even our not-so-tech-savvy staff have had very little difficulty using it. 
Janet Yes, this is the one that a few people have told me off list they find the best, with Neo coming a close second. 
Thanks Geoff
