<s> Having XML literals as datatypes doesn't seem to help with anything and its starting to create new problems, because so many things are special to this case, not the least being that it alone is in RDF.  </s>

<s> Thus Brian's entailment:  </s>
<s> is a {datatype}-entailment, but not any other sort.  </s>
<s> Since the test cases are only dealing with XSD entailments then we don't have to worry about the general case.  </s>
<s> i.e. the prohibition on the lang tag meaning anything is not part of the logic really, just some arbitrary constraint that we have thrown in.  </s>
<s> If we make too much of it then Dave's comment:  </s>
<s> will win the day.  </s>
<s> General principle: you only unpick typed literals, when the type is one of those in the set of datatypes you are currently dealing with.  </s>
<s> If you stick to that then: - I suggest we do not even consider the boolean entailment  </s>
<s> - I suggest the conclusions should always use the canonical form of a datatype (Brian's bnode in conclusion pattern is also OK).  </s>
<s> These suggestions are intended as concessions to implementors.  </s>

<s> Is it legacy from M&amp;S or what?  </s>
<s> Since the "wrapper" element is not normative and not really present (and somewhat of a hack IMO) how is the actual meaning of the literal affected by the lang tag ny differently than other types of literals?  </s>
<s> Can't we just treat all literals the same?  </s>
<s> I prefer this model of entailment, because it clearly bases the entailment on the denotation of the typed literal rather than its representation, which is just a means to an end; that end being the value, and once you have the value, the lexical  </s>

<s> Not all datatypes define a canonical space, and "cononical forms" are unknown to RDF datatyping, thus we should not recommend or require anything that is outside the scope of the RDF machinery.  </s>
