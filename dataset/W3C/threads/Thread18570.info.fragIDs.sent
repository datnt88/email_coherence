<s> 5.7 is implemented in "hybrid UA's" such as browser+proximitron, or my own Snufkin.  </s>
<s> Whilst this is perhaps not sufficient it does show that it is pretty workable.  </s>
<s> Jim.  </s>
<s> This is a good opportunity to remind everyone that the approach taken by UAAG 1.0 is that combinations of software can conform.  </s>
<s> The conformance claim indicates what pieces work together to satisfy the various requirements.  </s>
<s> So the combinations you cite do help us in our effort to show implementability.  </s>
<s> We welcome additional reports of how products working together satisfy the checkpoints.  </s>

<s> Snufkin also implements 3.5, 5.3, 5.5 and I have "tried" 10.5 but never had something that "worked".  </s>
