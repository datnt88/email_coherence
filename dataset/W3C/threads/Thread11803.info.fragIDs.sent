Agreed. 
I have a real problem with that whole thing anyway. 
How about: 
Only include automatically generated alternative content when the meaning or function of the described object is known with certainty. 
or maybe: "...has been identified by the author." 
This allows for the author, for example, to select from a set of "bullet points" that include ALT="*" without having to endure a prompt for each one, as well as the author being able to check a box that says: [X] Always use this textual description for this particular image. 
2.3.5 
Do not generate description text or insert place-holder text except human-authored description text when the meaning or function of the described object is known with certainty. 
This could be taken wrongly, i.e. "do not generate...text...when the meaning...is known". 
I don't think that's what we mean.

Too complex and tongue twisting. 
How about: "Only include auto-generated alt content when the object's meaning or function is understood."

I like the proposed wording. 
The rest of it I would put in a technique, cross referenced to the alt text registry.
