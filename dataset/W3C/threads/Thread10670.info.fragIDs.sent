<s> Both options: PROPOSE reopen pfps-08 reagle-01 reagle-02 then ... (below) then propose close pfps-08 reagle-01 reagle-02 accepting all three comments.  </s>
<s> Option 1: PROPOSE XML Literals are as in the working drafts prior to November 2002, in which it was not a typed literal, but a special sort of literal, with the changes made as a result of the reagle-01 and reagle-02 issues.  </s>

<s> editors of Syntax, Concepts, Test and Semantics actioned to come back with text, based on current editors drafts, and last version before we switched to the rdf:XMLLiteral type, for the group approval.  </s>
<s> Option 3: PROPOSE Typed literals, including XML Literal, to exclude the language tag in the abstract syntax.  </s>
<s> XML Literals to be refactored by deleting the rdf-wrapper text from concepts and putting it into syntax (probably in para 7.2.17).  </s>
<s> Add the following implementation note (or similar) to syntax.  </s>
<s> Change NTriples in test cases to show explicit rdf-wrapper for all XMLLiterals.  </s>

<s> Suggested implementation note for Syntax doc: NOTE: Implementors are reminded that they are free to represent the RDF graph in whatever way is appropriate, and there is no obligation to use N-triples or any specific concrete representation of the abstract syntax.  </s>
<s> Specifically, RDF/XML implementations that wish to manipulate XML Literals as XML may find it more appropriate to represent this lexical form as two components: the XML element content and the language tag (if any) - these two components could be combined to give the abstract syntax representation if needed.  </s>

<s> A: Option 2 straw poll: "We prefer Option 2 to no change."  </s>
<s> If Yes then straw poll - we prefer option 1 to option 2 straw poll - we prefer option 3 to option 2 straw poll - we prefer option 4 to option 2 each with fors, against and strongly against (i.e. would vote against in formal vote).  </s>

<s> If no to A, then no question is put.  </s>
<s> Rationale: Option 2 is the smallest sensible change, if we prefer the status quo to option 2, then we should do nothing.  </s>
<s> Otherwise we should decide to go for option 2 or more sophisticated, and then see if we have support for a more sophisticated XMLLiteral solution (options 1, 3 or 4).  </s>

<s> Right.  </s>
<s> So long as Dave's arguments that this is not in direct conflict with M&amp;S, such that the charter doesn't get in the way, I think this will make the widest group of RDF users the happiest.  </s>
<s> To refresh my memory (and so I don't have to go searching through the archives) can you recap in a sentence or two what your concerns were with Option 4? Thanks, Patrick  </s>
