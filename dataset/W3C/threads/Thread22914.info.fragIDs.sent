Any ideas on when DOM Level 2 will move to proposed rec? 
It has been some time. 
I expected this to be a full recommendation by now. 
Thanks Kevin Berkheiser 
The DOM WG is working on the last few minor nitpicking details, so it shouldn't be long before we move to PR. Lauren 
To add to the question what is the current timeline that the working group is looking for DOM Level 2 to become a reccomendation?? - Rajiv :wq
