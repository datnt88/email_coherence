<s> On of the problems we still face in out guidelines work is how to handle the interim and future issues.  </s>
<s> It is just too confusing to say that people should use stylesheets for laying out pages when we all know they don't work that way with any browsers today.  </s>
<s> Putting future next to them is confusing and won't be accurate in 6 months anyway.  </s>
<s> So we thought about building trigger points into guidelines so that they make sense both today and after the trigger point has been reached.  </s>
<s> For example LAYOUT OF PAGES Once all of the major browsers support CSS-2 and the browsers are used by the majority of users, CSS should be used to control layout and presentation.  </s>
<s> Until then tables (to control layout) and bit mapped text (for special text effects) may be used with alternate accessible pages as necessary.  </s>
<s> NOTES: a) Support of CSS-2 refers to blah blah blah , positioning, blah blah.  </s>
<s> b) Major browsers means Netscape, MSIE, Lynx, Opera, Others?) c) The definition of "Majority of users" is actually up to the page author.  </s>
<s> That is, when are they comfortable using CSS to lay out a page knowing that the page will appear quite differently to browsers that do not handle style sheets.  </s>
<s> It should be remembered though that we want the pages to look good wihtough style sheets anyway.  </s>
<s> So what are your thoughts and suggestions on this approach?  </s>
<s> Better than the past?  </s>
<s> Good enough to address the major problem we had?  </s>
<s> Got a better idea yet?  </s>

<s> Actually, I thoroughly disagree.  </s>
<s> The use of tables to provide formatting is simply poor practice for accessibility, and it should be made clear that this is so.  </s>
<s> Instead we should point out that until browsers implement CSS there is no accessible way to provide pixel-level positioning.  </s>
<s> Probably about the same place that we point out why different sized display devices (not to mention braille displays etc) mean that providing absolute positioning is foolish.  </s>
<s> We might as well write guidelines for how to do it right.  </s>
<s> If people want to use the medium incorrectly for an effect they thinik they are getting, then we ought to point out to them why they shouldn't (x.y Use a proper DTD, and use the elements properly) and hope that some of them actually listen.  </s>
<s> If they are told that table-forced layout is inaccessible then they will realise that to meet the guidelines they hvae to find some other mechanism - an alternative format, or convince their graphic designer that varying spatial layout is now part of the brief.  </s>

<s> Maybe I seemed a little carried away on one issue in my last post (it's very early here, and I am a night-bird).  </s>
<s> The point I was trying to make is that we should encourage people to recognise things which limit accessibility (such as lack of stylesheets) as limits of the medium, in this case a restriction on the availability of formatting control.  </s>
<s> In other cases, such as the use of D-links or LONGDESC, then we should identify D-link as the Interim solution.  </s>
<s> We should recommend that LONGDESC be included as well as D-link, which is necessary until such time as HTML 4.0 compliant browsers are more or less universal.  </s>
<s> We should also point out that this is likely to be some considerable time away.  </s>
