The used a gentleman named Peter Wong who was listed as a Microsoft Engineer......interesting. 
It seemed like they were trying to vindicate themselves rather than inform the public, however. 
Thanks.

Member, Web Standards Project Steering Committee At least it is press and, unfortunately, its more than anyone else has done on a commercial. 
I feel the public needs the shock affect and to see people mainstreamed. 
Overall, it is positive press. 
Hopefully, other companies will see the potential customers and dollar signs in their pockets and do the same, for example, maybe IBM. 
There is some additional information on the WAI IG where the member from Microsoft mentioned they were doing five commercials that showed five people using computers to help them. 
It was interesting. 
If anyone still has this or can easily find it on the archive list, please post. 
It offers some good insight. 
rob Here is my attempt to compress the reference card down to a manageble size while incorporating as many of the ideas that were contributed. 
It includes an introduction, and a line about where to go for more information. 
I also drew inspiration from Harvey's posting on universal web design that arrived today. 
I have had to reorganize and reword more than I expected. 
My criterion for rejecting a previous rendition was if I had to read it more than twice to understand the point. 
This version is under 190 words, and it could be shorter. 
However, because I have made so many changes, I decided to stop here to get peoples' reactions. 
A point of departure in my version is the use of a title for each section. 
This is to draw the eye to important points while working in such a confined space. 
Thus you will note: "Hypertext links," "Backgrounds," etc. 
You can't cram much more on a business card. 
I originally marked it up as Times Roman 6 point, but I had trouble reading it with my 20:20 vision. 
So I cut and reformated until everything was in Times Roman 8 point. 
That's the smallest size that my over-40 eyes could handle. 
A sans-serif font will be very difficult to read on this scale. 
There are ten points. 
Maybe we could call them the "Ten HTML Commandments," or something to that effect. 
(That's what Dena Shumila called the set of guidelines we came up with in 1996.) The content follows. 
A life-size mockup, in Word 97 format, is attached. 
Send your comments and corrections directly to me, and I will try to incorporate them before Thursday's meeting. 
Alan World Wide Consortium's (W3C) Web Accessibility Initiative Hand-, eye-, and ear-free features to make your site accessible to people with disabilities and individuals who have portable devices and slow connections: Hypertext links Use descriptive hypertext links. 
Each link should make sense when read alone or out of context. 
Photographs, images &amp; animations Describe content or purpose within the Alt="text" attribute. 
Create text alternatives. 
Backgrounds Choose uncluttered backgrounds and contrasting text and background colours. 
Imagemaps Many people cannot use a mouse. 
Duplicate imagemap hot spots as a list of text anchors. 
Ensure that every link can be activated using keyboard commands. 
Tables Prepare a text-only page that describes its content. 
Graphs &amp; charts Summarize content. 
Make the raw data available. 
Frames Label each frame with TITLE , and include a simplified version of its content within the NOFRAMES attribute. 
Audio Prepare audio descriptions, or link to a page that contains transcripts or descriptions. 
Page organization Use headings, lists and summaries to make pages easy to scan. 
Evaluate accessibility Try different browsers; switch off graphics, sounds and animations; navigate via keyboard, without a mouse; use a monochrome monitor; use automated analysis tools. 
See www.w3.org/WAI for the complete WAI Page Author Guidelines A sans-serif font will be very difficult to read on this scale. 
Recent studies have shown that serif faces are just faster to read at normal size, but that sans-serif lead to better understanding and overall stronger subjective preference (i.e. people like them better). 
This should be replaced by the W3C + WAI logo (as seen on top of www.w3.org/WAI). 
I'd rather use an active sentence, i.e. 
These ... features will make your site... I'd remore the colon and make it an intro. 
Otherwise I like it (and "portable or slow devices", as Bill said, is shorter) I think we need to follow some priority order in this list. 
Link text is not a priority 1 on the PA document, it should come after ALT or FRAME. 
Please, no "Create text alternatives", it's ambiguous and we don't want people to think we ask them to double their number of pages. 
Really not important. 
I'd remove this one. 
Most if not all UAs support an "ignore author background/foreground" setting nowadays. 
Duplicate is a bad word :-) We want them to use ALT and client side image map, and if they can't, then a text version. 
Again, no asking for double page as a first order. 
"Avoid complex table or prepare a text-only..." is fine. 
Instead of "Make the raw data available.", 
I'd say "Provide a long description". 
In any case, I think this is too arcane for a business card and can be left out. 
Since TITLE or NAME can be used, I'd just say "Label each frame, and if too complex, provide a linear version in with NOFRAMES . 
Note that we can save on word/size by skipping attribute (this is an element in this case, not an attribute in fact) I'd move this one on structure right after ALT, as second top. 
Evaluate your accessibility is more personal. 
Can be shorten: I'd remove "without a mouse" which doesn't add much after mentioning the keyboard, and monochrome monitor. 
I'd add "use automated and text-only emulation tools". 
I like this short closing and the way it is presented on the card.
