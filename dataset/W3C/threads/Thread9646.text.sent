(Who are they?) (What is missing?) I think that the union treatment of rdfs:drange does this nicely. 
Consider the following example, including all *four* datatyping idioms (inline, value triple, doublet, and datatype triple): ppp rdfs:drange xsd:integer . 
aaa ppp "10" . 
bbb ppp _:1 . 
_:1 rdfs:dlex "10" . 
ccc ppp _:2 . 
_:2 rdfs:dlex "10" . 
_:2 rdfs:dtype xsd:integer . 
eee ppp _:3 . 
_:3 xsd:integer "10" . 
All of the above idioms define the pairing ("10",xsd:integer) which unambiguously denotes the integer value 'ten'. 
The property value of ppp is either a member of the lexical space (literal) or member of the value space (bNode) and the graph syntax makes it crystal clear which partition of the union the actual property value corresponds to; with no conflict nor confusion of the global range typing for any of the idioms. 
Eh? C.f. http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Feb/0469.html for more use cases... Patrick o Does the datatyping proposal meet your needs and the needs of your users? 
(Who are they?) (What is missing?) I fail to see how. 
But Dan C. doesn't want the second triple to say that. 
He wants it to say that the ppp value of aaa is the string '10', regardless of datatyping. 
We have established this point now many times. 
You keep trying to fix something that isn't broken. 
? 
unions aren't partitioned, that is precisely the problem. 
A union is just a big set that contains everything in all the other sets. 
Think of mixing two colors of sand. 
So if the datatype class is this union, then a range statement refers to the entire union, which hardly restricts the datatyping at all. 
Also, some datatypes (eg some date formatting) may have value spaces which overlap lexical spaces of others, which would produce even more confusion when unions were formed.

If that's the case, then I'll stop.
