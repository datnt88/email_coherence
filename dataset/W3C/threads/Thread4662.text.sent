There do not appear to be any rules saying that line endings in XQuery text are normalized. 
This means that the query: gotcha! 
will return a different infoset depending on how the text editor used to prepare the query represents line endings, and it will potentially produce a different infoset from the one produced by an XML parser when applied to the same input. 
I would recommend that line endings within XQuery input text should be normalized in the same way as XML line endings. 
And to avoid having to change the rules in the future, I would suggest that we use the XML 1.1 rules rather than the XML 1.0 rules. 
This rule should not apply to XPath; preprocessing of XPath input is the job of the host language. 
Michael Kay Software AG How do they differ between XML 1.0 and 1.1?

Michael Kay Software AG 1.1 adds NEL and LS (x85 and x2028) to the list of characters normalised to #A on input.
