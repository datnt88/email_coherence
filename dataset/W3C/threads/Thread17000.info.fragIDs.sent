<s> Hello Scott, Just a note on "HiSoftware Products and Client/Server Applications."  </s>
<s> That is a pretty broad question, but I will try to answer it for you For HTML/XHTML "Web" Documents: HiSoftware AccVerify, AccRepair, AccMonitor, and AccessibilityWATCH will work with all HTML/XHTML "Web" documents, whether or not they are static pages or dynamic pages for Intranets, Internets, Extranets, etc... Using our new AccVerify Test Center you can take automation to the next step, allowing for full automation of Forms, Security, user groups and product or catalog testing for your "Web" Based applications.  </s>
<s> Testing is for: Section 508 Standards IBM Accessibility Guidelines W3C WAI P1-P3 Guidelines or any custom guideline derived from p1-p3 Additionally The AccVerify product has a full API Allowing you to integrate your testing with Products like: Microsoft Visual Studio .Net  </s>
<s> Mercury Test Director Microsoft Application Test Center Content Management Systems: SharePoint CMS Content Management Server etc...  </s>
<s> For "Software" Applications Later this Spring HiSoftware will be releasing a new product that will test Software Applications and Plug-Ins to see if they have been developed to meet the following guidelines or standards: US Section 508 EITACC Desktop Software standards Microsoft Accessibility Guidelines This Product should be available in MAY 2002.  </s>
<s> It will integrate with the AccVerify Test Center allowing for automated testing of Plug-Ins and software applications.  </s>
<s> Overall, If you have further questions you can always contact our technical people, they would be more then happy to review the capabilities of our solutions with you or send you demonstration software.  </s>
<s> We run a beta group and if you are interested in the software testing versus the Web Document Testing please feel free to request membership to the beta program.  </s>
<s> The product "Code Name" is "TotalACC" interested in this product in your request.  </s>

<s> For reading client-server apps -- tools like Jaws or WindowsEyes will, as far as I know, read whatever Windows sees.  </s>
<s> That means that current technology, like Java Swing clients, can be used through them if the programmer for the tool set everything up right.  </s>
<s> Older technology, like Java AWT or SmallTalk, is often not accessible.  </s>
<s> For "thin-client" using browser-based code, there's no difference between that and anything else on the web -- it will be read if the interface is accessible.  </s>
<s> For fixing -- It depends on what you mean by client/server.  </s>
<s> If you mean fat-client applications, that use Java, VB, or SmallTalk, for example, I don't believe that any of the popular HTML fixing applications will fix that code.  </s>
<s> There are a number of niche products that I have seen to automatically fix certain common mistakes with Java or VB, but I haven't used any of them.  </s>
<s> If you mean thin-client, using HTML, JSP, ASP, etc., then some of those applications will fix the code.  </s>
<s> I know that my company's tool, iACT, can evaluate and fix ASP, JSP, Cold Fusion, etc., and I imagine that most of the other tools could as well.  </s>

<s> I'm not sure of the question but if it is envolving java, I hear a lot about jaws working with it but having tried it, I can only say that it is far from perfect.  </s>
<s> I'd love to see a demo of jaws working with a java app in the ui.  </s>
<s> What server client software are you looking at or approximately what software are you looking at.  </s>

<s> Scott- JAWS works with client / server applications on the client side.  </s>
<s> [This e-mail assumes that you are referring to classic client / server computing with the client being an installed application on the desktop of the user.]  </s>
<s> If the client application is written in native Windows code JAWS would read information about the application through the appropriate API (MSAAA).  </s>
<s> If the application is written in Java JAWS would read information about the application through the Java Accessibility API, with some caveats for native code access to the JVM.  </s>
<s> As David pointed out early the usability of Java applications in JAWS is still evolving.  </s>
<s> Our application is written in Java and we have had success in using it in JAWS.  </s>
<s> Candidly, however, the results have been inconsistent and both Sun and Freedom Scientific continue to work to improve the situation.  </s>
<s> Automated compliance tools such as InFocus (my personal favorite ;-), AccVerify, Lift, etc. do not currently support the diagnosis of applications as described above.  </s>
<s> This includes applications embedded in pages, stand alone applications, and pretty much anything else that produces custom GUI components.  </s>
<s> I know of some tools on the market that are available to diagnose applications; however, my "faith" in such tools is limited.  </s>
<s> For the time being the best route to ensure accessibility for native code applications or embedded applications in web pages is to test [the application] with assistive technology.  </s>
<s> If you are in need of testers I am sure this list, the commercial organizations posting to the list, or my organization would be more than happy to help you find appropriate resources.  </s>
