<s> I have observed a few quirks or bugs in Amaya 1.3a, and hope they may be addressed soon, possibly in 1.4.  </s>
<s> 1.  </s>
<s> It seems to update the screen very slowly when displaying a large (e.g. 140k) file.  </s>
<s> (CPU: 166MHz, 95% cycles free; RAM: 32 mb, largely free; no disk swapping observed.  </s>
<s> Suspect unintelligent or poorly optimized video or rendering code.)  </s>
<s> 2. Amaya does not appear to understand the font tag.  </s>
<s> (e.g., if I use a font tag to place a Greek letter in an html file, it shows up Greek in browsers but shows up in Times New Roman in Amaya.)  </s>
<s> 3. Image map area editing seems broken: an image map area can't be moved once placed, and can only be resized down and right, not up and left.  </s>
<s> Deleting and recreating the things to position them right rapidly becomes extremely tedious.  </s>
<s> Also, there seem to be problems with show/hide image map areas and selecting of image map areas.  </s>
<s> Also, does anyone know of any browser (besides Amaya itself) that supports HTML 4.0 and XML?  </s>
<s> I see 4.0-aware editors popping up like mushrooms in the woods after a rain, but the current and the beta versions of both Netscape and Internet Exploder conspicuously fail to render MathML correctly and exhibit other noncompliance.  </s>
<s> Is there any estimate of when the major PC browsers will fully support the new standard?  </s>
<s> (There is no information of any kind with respect to HTML 4.0 support on either Microsoft or Netscape's websites.  </s>
<s> Neither Netscape 4.5 PR2's nor IE beta 5's web pages have word one to say about 4.0 support; and Netscape 4.5 PR2 does not render MathML correctly.  </s>
<s> MSIE 5 I won't touch with a ten-foot-pole, of course, we all remember the experiences people had with the betas for IE4 with its desktop integration!) .*.

<s> We're currently working on that, but an editor needs to use an incremental formatting which makes of course the editor rendering slower than the simple browser display.  </s>
<s> This is not the right method to input greek characters in an HTML document.  </s>
<s> Our plan is to support Greek entities and Unicode.  </s>
<s> Perhaps the image map area editing has been broken in the 1.3a version, but I tested it in the 1.3b version and it works fine.  </s>

<s> I think there are at least 3 ways to use greek characters in a (HTML) document: - A plain Greek document (as in from Greece) To be covered by switching charactersets.  </s>

<s> There is no Greek in that HTML it is all in Roman letters but shown with rather strange shapes.  </s>

<s> IE4.0, NS4.5, and NS3.04 could not display any greek characters.  </s>

<s> to page showed what looked a lot like Greek to me.  </s>
<s> That's the problem, you are making the characters look like greek by misrepresenting them by using a font which displays them wrongly.  </s>
<s> HTML is a logical markup language and can be processed by tools other than MS Windows GUI browsers (including indexing tools and screen readers for the blind).  </s>
<s> Currently the cleanest solution to mixing greek in, if you have to support non-HTML 4 browser, is probably to GIF the individual characters and use the entity codes as the alt text.  </s>
<s> There are probably cases where abusing fonts is the pragmatic solution, but it should only be considered a solution to the extent that you must support inadequate browsers, and it is more important to get the right graphic effect, and you know that the target audience will be using a GUI browser with a font with the Microsoft Symbol encoding vector, rather than to communicate information in a machine processable form.  </s>
<s> If appearence isn't absolutely critical, all browsers that I have tried, that don't handle the entities properly, will display the uninterpreted entity code, so the reader can tell exactly what was intended.  </s>
