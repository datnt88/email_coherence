Hi, I would like to create an xml document by passing in a DTD. 
I would like to use the java version of the DOM parser. 
Are there any tools or API's that are present which take in a dtd and create an XML document. 
Thanks, -Vidya 
What you're looking for seems to be a "DTD-directed editor". 
IBM posted several approaches to this on their alphaWorks website (http://www.alphaWorks.ibm.com), including tree-based editing (Xeena), query-based document construction, and a tool that synthesized dummy documents for software testing purposes. 
I don't know which of these have been updated to work with the current version of the XML4J/Xerces parser, but that collection may be worth checking out. 
I've also used XMetaL for wordprocessing-style markup editing. 
Haven't 
tried it with data-style markup. 
Unfortunately there are no standardized APIs for this purpose yet, which is one reason we haven't seen more DTD-aware tools. 
DOM Level 3 is expected to address that.

XMetal 2.0 has a very nice feature that allows HTML forms to be used to display and edit "data style markup" in a way that can be integrated quite seamlessly with XMetaL's WYSIWYG capabilities on document-style markup. 
It takes a bit of script to configure (in this release anyway ...) but the result is very useful. 
What is your usage for XMetal. 
We use XMetal for doc editing, but in my previous job we were creating the B2B exchange for the Bike industry which was primarily data centric. 
I am still working with those guy's, but the point was that we were using XMetal also. 
Do you use a repository of any kind? 
I agree with Mike, the HTML Forms are nice in XMetal, but are also very script intensive for the outcome you get. 
If I understand correctly(don't take my word on it) but I heard rumor that the XSLT either plug-in or build for XMetal will support HTML forms and output via an XSLT processing engine. 
Also, we are currently writing a script in house and attaching it to an XSLT engine Macro in order to punch the button in XMetal and push it to a browser via XSLT. 
Should be done in the next couple of weeks, I can send code if it works well. 
It's not a perfect fix, but it's easily doable.
