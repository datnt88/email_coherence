<s> Hi, I would like to create an xml document by passing in a DTD.  </s>
<s> I would like to use the java version of the DOM parser.  </s>
<s> Are there any tools or API's that are present which take in a dtd and create an XML document.  </s>
<s> Thanks, -Vidya  </s>
<s> What you're looking for seems to be a "DTD-directed editor".  </s>
<s> IBM posted several approaches to this on their alphaWorks website (http://www.alphaWorks.ibm.com), including tree-based editing (Xeena), query-based document construction, and a tool that synthesized dummy documents for software testing purposes.  </s>
<s> I don't know which of these have been updated to work with the current version of the XML4J/Xerces parser, but that collection may be worth checking out.  </s>
<s> I've also used XMetaL for wordprocessing-style markup editing.  </s>
<s> Haven't  </s>
<s> tried it with data-style markup.  </s>
<s> Unfortunately there are no standardized APIs for this purpose yet, which is one reason we haven't seen more DTD-aware tools.  </s>
<s> DOM Level 3 is expected to address that.  </s>

<s> XMetal 2.0 has a very nice feature that allows HTML forms to be used to display and edit "data style markup" in a way that can be integrated quite seamlessly with XMetaL's WYSIWYG capabilities on document-style markup.  </s>
<s> It takes a bit of script to configure (in this release anyway ...) but the result is very useful.  </s>
<s> What is your usage for XMetal.  </s>
<s> We use XMetal for doc editing, but in my previous job we were creating the B2B exchange for the Bike industry which was primarily data centric.  </s>
<s> I am still working with those guy's, but the point was that we were using XMetal also.  </s>
<s> Do you use a repository of any kind?  </s>
<s> I agree with Mike, the HTML Forms are nice in XMetal, but are also very script intensive for the outcome you get.  </s>
<s> If I understand correctly(don't take my word on it) but I heard rumor that the XSLT either plug-in or build for XMetal will support HTML forms and output via an XSLT processing engine.  </s>
<s> Also, we are currently writing a script in house and attaching it to an XSLT engine Macro in order to punch the button in XMetal and push it to a browser via XSLT.  </s>
<s> Should be done in the next couple of weeks, I can send code if it works well.  </s>
<s> It's not a perfect fix, but it's easily doable.  </s>
