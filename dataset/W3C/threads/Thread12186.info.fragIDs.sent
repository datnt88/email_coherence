Glen I am working on with my reviews of WebCT and how to use it best for accessibility. 
I am wondering if: 1. you have done conformance testing of version 3.6 to see how it complies with ATAG and 2. if you have done conformance testing of Cobalt (is that the right name?) to see how it conforms? 
Perhaps someone else has done this work and could help me - it would be good if we could do it if it's not yet done as many Australian Universities need to know what to do with their content now and for the future.

Liddy, Jan has done an ATAG conformance test on WebCT, Blackboard and Prometheus that will be posted to the AU site soon (once the developers have had time to respond). 
Laurie Harrison has written a fairly extensive manual on how to author accessibly with WebCT.

Hi Libby, I have already compiled an ATAG review of WebCT 3.6.
