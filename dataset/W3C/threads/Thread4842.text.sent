I like using IRC as a supplement for telephone conferences. 
W3C has some special tools for attendance, speaker queue management, and so on. 
It's particularly nice if the scribe can take notes in IRC; that way the chair can see if s/he is behind, and other participants can sometimes read stuff that they didn't quite hear clearly. 
If it's convenient, I'd like WG members to join me in an IRC channel, irc://irc.w3.org:6665/dawg during the teleconference. 
In many IRC clients, you type: /server irc.w3.org 6665 /join #dawg Dan Connolly, W3C http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/ see you at the WWW2004 in NY 17-22 May? 
Oh... I almost forgot... If anybody would like more info about IRC, good clients on various platforms, etc. see... Dan Connolly, W3C http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/ see you at the WWW2004 in NY 17-22 May? 
I need to give my regrets due to midnight timing here in Finland. 
Works for me. 
I'm on holidays and probably in a plane next week but from then on I will be able to join in.

I'm particularly interested in your position on the proposal to meet in Amsterdam... |http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-rdf-dawg/2004JanMar/0037.html 
I have informal indications that this is convenient for lots of WG members, but I'd like on-the-record confirmation.

Kendall Clark Habitation creates space; space only exists because we do. 
Please send corrections in reply to this message, to the whole list; we'll approve the record, with any corrections/ammendments, at our next meeting. 
If you reply to this message about anything other than correctly recording the meeting, please *change the subject*. 
Attendees were DanC, AndyS, DanielK, KendalC, RobS, EricP, AlbertoR, DaveB, BryanT, DirkG, JosD, DirkC regrets: JanneS, KevinW Thanks, Andy, for taking notes during the call. 
For this first meeting, I'm sending an edited summary of the meeting, to set an example of the sort of balance I'd like to see between a record that's easy to produce and one that's useful for the group, including (a) people who weren't on the call and (b) people looking at this record many months from now. 
In the future, I'd like the scribe to send the proposed minutes for review. 
so RESOLVED. 
KendallC offered to scribe the next meeting, 25 March. 
postscript: ACTION DanC: reserve a teleconference bridge for 25 Mar, 1 Apr, 8 Apr, 15 Apr (ericp, bonus points if you beat me to it.) so RESOLVED, RobS abstaining. 
There was some discussion of logistics details. 
ACTION DirkG: collect logistics details in a web page and send us a pointer ACTION DanC: set up meeting registration (ericp, bonus points if you beat me to it) We tried to find, among the use cases that had been sent, those that were appealing to several of us and hence merited further development. 
In response to a request to discuss structure, DanC asked that we find one or two specific cases before looking for a general structure. 
DanC reiterated the qualities he suggested the group should be looking for in use cases: The ideal use cases will -- command consensus of this Working Group as a description of a problem we intend to solve (or: solve a part of) -- clarify one or more requitements -- still be relevant when we're at last call, deciding whether we think the spec is done -- engage potential users of our technology and convince some of them to closely review our spec -- be clear and engaging enough to get picked up by journalists and copied into trade press stories -- http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-rdf-dawg/2004JanMar/0009.html 
A few offers to elaborate on specific cases were accepted: ACTION KendallC: refine JS-1, esp the composer/creator version Note: this is on the boundary of the charter, which says.. "This may in practice be the virtual graph which would follow from some form of inference from a stored graph. 
This does not affect the data access protocol" ACTION AndyS: refine AFS-1: "Find the resource for the person called 'John S mith'" with some details ACTION EricP: send "tell me properties of X" case ACTION AlbertoS: elaborate on AFS-2 "Tell me about ..."
