Hmmmm. 
I'm still thinking about what should be allowed off of a LONGDESC. 
I am averse to using an element for something other than its intended purpose just because it could be. 
SO. 
That leaves me thinking.. -What is the purpose of LONGDESC? 
- What are the other uses that are being considered for it? 
- Could they be done other ways? 
Would that not be better? 
(e.g. if other descriptive information could be attached to a LONGDESC link... why not have that info on the home page. 
_- Of PRIMARY concern, is the ability to easily and automatically pull a text description from the LONGDESC link on the main page without having to go through multiple links or search another page to find it. 
I'm not seeing that in the descriptions I've heard.. Thanks Gregg Gregg C Vanderheiden Ph.D. Professor - Human Factors Dept of Ind.

Behalf Of Charles McCathieNevile There are a couple of things at work here. 
longdesc is a specific fix provided for IMG to allow it to handle (by reference) multiple types of content. 
For HTML until version 4.0 IMG is the only element available to include mutlimedia content. 
Although the specification talks exclusively about images, there are blurred lines. 
For example, animated gifs are pretty common on the web. 
Although most of them are a few frames, I have watched video clips of more than a hunndred frames rendered with an animated gif. 
There does not seem to be a clear line between an image and a video presentation. 
So I did a straw poll among a group of people who are not representative of anything really, and the consensus seemed to be that there is not a problem using IMG to include a video (although the person I asked who knows HTML best wanted to know why you didn't use object). 
Gregg expressed a concern in the meeting that a longdesc could be used to present something more than the IMG which it describes. 
I think that it is a mistake to rely on longdesc to include content which is not reproduced in general - that should be clear from the guidelines. 
But there is a judgement call on how much information the object referred to by the IMG represents. 
So I would be unhappy about the idea that longdesc should be text. 
I could live with it being hypertext, because that allows the inclusion of multiple media. 
And I think that the IMG element should be deprecated and we should look to better solutions for the problem such as SMIL and the object element. 
In the current specifications nothing is said about the resource type which is expected from a longdesc, and I think that is how it should be.

For my part, the issue is not a question of how the LONGDESC attribute should be used, but of where the constraints should be specified. 
The argument which Al and others have been running is to the effect that the WAI guidelines, (in particular the Techniques Document of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) offer the appropriate context in which to constrain the usage of LONGDESC. 
Accordingly, it has been argued that the internet media (MIME) type of the resource to which the LONGDESC URL refers, should not be formally restricted as part of 
the HTML and XHTML language specifications. 
For example, do we have a guarantee in advance that all document markup languages, based on XML for example, will be subtypes of "text" (E.G. "text/xml", "text/xhtml", etc.)? 
If not, then there are good grounds on which to conclude that the best means of regulating LONGDESC does not consist in specifying a constraint in terms of the internet MIME type of the destination resource. 
The central claim here, is that the hasty 
imposition of a limitation based on MIME types may yield adverse consequences in the future, as it depends on certain assumptions concerning (1) the range of acceptable uses of LONGDESC, and (2) the future of the MIME type system, which have not been fully explored. 
As an alternative, the language specifications could make it clear that text, and more specifically a marked up document providing a description of the image, should lie at the destination of the LONGDESC URL. 
Moreover, readers should be referred to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (or the Techniques Document, as this is where the issue will be discussed), for details pertaining to proper usage, etc. 
Since this language would be informative only, it would seem feasible to refer to a W3C note such as the Techniques Document, even though the latter is not a normative reference. 
I think we are all clear on the primary goal of londesc - to provide a means of associating further information, for the (broken) img element. 
Having textual information is a primary concern to a person who is blind. 
But for a person who is a non-reader, this does not necessarily apply. 
In the case of someone who is deaf, text is often the second-least useful thing, after audio. 
In the case of a person with a cognitive barrier to reading text may be the single least useful possibility. 
As it happens there is no very good mechanism currently for specifying what the users particular needs are. 
The most obvious one would be to use RDF information (or even PICS) to make assertions about the relationships of various types of content. 
The closest we get at the moment is the object element in html, content negotiation in HTTP, or the system-captions attribute in SMIL. 
Te first two rely on being able to prioritise content-type in a particular order, which doesn't refelct reality. 
The last one, while it can be used to initiate content type negotiation based on two or more variables (for example, system-captions="on" and system-language="Auslan" could be used to offer a signed video accompanying track, and further down the switch statement a single variable test of system-captions="on" could be used to provide a textual description), the scheme has been shown to be inadequate for providing descriptions of video. 
In the case where people are using longdesc (why? 
support for it is slightly less than support for the object element as far as I can tell) it is unlikely that they will link to anything which does not contain text. 
It would seem to me that best practice there would be to provide a hypertext description, which might include links to information in all kinds of media. 
In the SMIL context, in particular, where a longdesc element can be associated with any media type, including a text stream (I believe), it makes sense to allow any media type to be at the other end of the longdesc.

Two points that are in support of Jason's view: First, we already have a draft specificataion of an XML application that its MIME type is not text/* . 
It is Scalable Vector Graphics, and the proposed MIME type is image/svg. 
The concept of MIME type tells very little about the accessibility features of the resource, or even of its general features, for example text/* means that if the resource cannot be processed, then rendering it as plain text could make some sense to a human reader. 
This criterion has little to do with accessiblity. 
As we are actually assuming that longdesc refers to resources that are processed. 
Moreover in the definition of the text/* it is implicitly assumed that a human reader can scan through the code and find the human language bits in it (e.g., text/html), or understand the code itsself (text/javascript). 
Both "tests" have little to do with accesssiblity. 
In addition, an "application/pdf" file that contains mainly text streams that their order in the file is the same as their logical reading order, and utilizes compression can not be understood when rendered as plain text (because of the compression). 
But the text can be extracted and presented reasonably well (due to the logical reading order of the streams) in a speaking device.

Technically speaking, which browsers (voice, GUI, etc) support long description? 
Do we have a list?

As far as I know, IBM's Hope Page Reader v2.5 supports longdesc.

That's right. 
IBM's HPR does support longdesc on the IMG element only.

I agree with Charles that the OBJECT element is much more flexible than the LONGDESC attribute, and that its use should be encouraged. 
The nested structure of OBJECT permits various alternative representations of a multimedia resource to be provided easily, including a written description with block-level markup. 
It should be remembered that LONGDESC is essentially an attempt to mittigate the access consequences resulting from the inadequacies of the IMG element, which were rectified in HTML 4.0 with the introduction of OBJECT.
