<s> Hello there, For some time (i.e. several versions) now, Amaya has been crashing on most (if not  </s>
<s> all) of my web pages, including validated pages (valid XHTML1.0, valid CSS).  </s>
<s> Is there any way to know where it crashes (like using a debug option to trace what  </s>
<s> it succesfully does to infer what it could not do ?).  </s>
<s> A sample w3c-validated short page causing a crash is at  </s>
<s> On my PCs (Win98, NT4SP6a), it stays locked after displaying the loading of the osinetcode.css  </s>
<s> stylesheet.  </s>
<s> Thanks  </s>
<s> Hello Frederic from John in Niagara, Canada I was able to view your file in Amaya by downloading it and RENAMING IT TO TEST.HTM.  </s>
<s> I suspect that there may be an file extension name hangup in Amaya because viewing the on-line version hung up my computer as well (but did not crash it!). someone else may verify that .asp extension may cause problems ---  </s>
<s> A side note is that you may wish to look at the screen layout.  </s>
<s> Right now it forces a need for horizontal scrolling.  </s>
<s> If possible make the design ADAPT to various screen sizes by wrapping techniques.... or at least design for the current standard of 800x600 desktop which leaves about 750 pixels width to work with in a browser.  </s>

<s> I tried saving the page to disk, and it hangs all the same.  </s>
<s> It displays the title of  </s>
<s> the page, a white area for the first IFRAME, the load messages for the CSS files,  </s>
<s> and stops there, whatever the name under which the file is saved.  </s>
<s> Before anyone asks, here are the headers returned by a request to that page.  </s>
<s> They look normal, don't they ?  </s>
