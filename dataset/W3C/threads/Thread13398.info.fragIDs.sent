Al's observation suggests the following process: 1. 
We only include in our recommendations checks that are presently in the guidelines or techniques document. 
2. If we have a suggestion for additional rules or guidance, we bring them to the attention of the author guidelines (AG) group. 
3. When AG puts it in the document, we then add it to our techniques doc. 
4. Discussions about pros and cons of new guidelines/suggestions would take place in AG space. 
For starters All in favor email "Aye" All opposed email "Nay" If there are any "Nays" lets etalk about it.

To your Check Point 1.1A: Valid ALT text: Allowed - ALT attribute value of "" Only IF (NOT inside of A HREF) OR link is also referenced via text. 
This can be tested by algorithm, so it is either allowed or not allowed. 
(Human intervention/consideration is NOT needed.) 
I believe that human consideration is always advisable for ALT="". 
You can test for situations where it is definitely bad, but you can't test automatically for where it is good. 
Suggested for discussion: ALT="" is NOT allowed. 
(This rule is much simpler!) ALT=" " is permissible as an alternative. 
ALT=" " is treated as "suspicious" and generates a warning to the effect of: "Is this graphic purely decoration and devoid of content?" 
It seems to be the small differences that generate the most heat. 
This is one of those. 
After much digging I found what I believe to be the clearest statement of the conclusion that was reached on this topic in the GL group: http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wai-gl-techniques-19980918.html#spacer-images 
That is to say, ALT="" has not been disallowed because there are cases where it is the best practice. 
Admittedly some of the argument hangs on the fact that we can't rely on stylesheets to make layout tables obsolete until they are better supported in user agents. 
But all that reasoning still stands. 
The problem is, nowhere in the RECcommendation that Tim signed is this explicitly stated. 
It takes a) searching the working group archives and b) authentication by the chairs that this decision was made and then not reconsidered and overturned by a later deliberation of the group, to bring the consensus resolution to light. 
This is why I was emphasizing the need for a strong GL presence in the process of "life after REC" including this step of detailing the automatable tests related to the checkpoints and how they are related.

Rational: With the Lynx text browser, ALT="" hides the image (and any embeded link). 
The image is completely invisible unless one issues a "view source" command. 
Any associate link is likewise invisible, unless one issues a "view links" command. 
(Exception: iff ALL links on a page are hidden in this way, Lynx will generate a warning message.) ALT=" " will generate [ ] in Lynx. 
This might be viewed as unattractive and pointless, but at least the user knows that something is there. 
If the [ ] is part of a link, it will (with the default settings) be assigned a link number and is (in any case) be able to be selected and activated as is the case with any other hypertext link.

Subject: Guidelines Implementation Date: Tuesday, May 18, 1999 1:55 PM Hello all, As part of the evaluation and repair process, we need to create a set of specifications for implementing the WAI page author guidelines. 
The specs would be used by A-Prompt and Bobby in the design of our software. 
The specs should be written with the following goals: - precise enough for use by software programmers - simple enough for everyone to understand and comment upon - complete implementation of the WAI page author guidelines I've started a document that might fulfil these goals and would like your comments and suggestions. 
The doc is stored at: This document is not complete and is a rough first draft! 
I would like to see the document finished reasonably soon (end of June perhaps) so that we can code the software. 
Please take a look and let me know if you have any comments.

Actually, I am going to vote "nay." 
I think it is important that tools not limit their ambition to mere guideline conformance. 
Caveat: This idea is really centered in the Authoring Tools topic. 
Because I think that the subject areas of AU and ER do and should overlap, I'll continue the thread here and copy there. 
I don't think that the ER nominations or AU guidelines, checkpoints and techniques should say something that conflicts with what the WCAG says, when the WCAG has spoken. 
We can extend this to "clarifications and rulings" from the "life after REC" activities yet to be organized. 
[Note: I believe that in the IG plenary at Toronto, Judy said that WAI-CG should take up the relationship of GL,ER,AU as regards "guidance for tool implementation of the WCAG."] 
But on the other hand, in an interactive dialog one encounters the whole question of "warnings" and other ways of stimulating the author/user which are new territory that the WCAG has not dealt with. 
My favorite one of these at a high level is the idea that authoring tools should transform the document-in-process in ways which emphasize logical structure. 
This logical structure is the foundation for the "transform gracefully" techniques which are developed in the UA guidelines. 
A clear example of this is the "use hierarchy properly" concept. 
One can try do do this with formal rules about the existence and cardinality of various Hn elements. 
A much stronger strategy, however, is to offer the author an auto-extracted internal navbar which matches what the adaptive user agent techniques will assume in the way of hierarchy. 
If the author finds this outline view helpful in navigation, they will be likely to write in a well-structured way. 
Similarly with the internal logical structure of a table. 
If the authoring tool highlights the data:header relationships in the default schema for the table as the user is creating the table, then the author will fix gaps in the logical information. 
Otherwise layout will be the only semantics one can trust that the author comprehended. 
Do not expect what you do not inspect. 
Do not expect logical depth in a document unless the author has inspected the deep structure by accepting multiple presentations that change the surface details. 
We should try to be scrupulous to adhere to the WCAG provisions as the GL group determined them. 
But ER and AU tools should by no means be limited to implementing what is in that document. 
There are lots of things that can be done in a tool which advance the intent of the content guidelines without being strictly derived from those guidelines.

I went back to the group charter to clarify this particular issue. 
In both ER groups (ig &amp; wg), it states... "We will use the author guidelines as a basis for discussion." 
[see pasted excerpts below] ...which seems to support Bruce's statement (assuming that there has not been some later modification to this statement that I am not aware of). 
As there is a nay vote, I also believe a discussion is in order... 
I don't see a problem with breaking down a checkpoint (1.1 in particular) into several sub-categories that can each be better analyzed. 
I believe that this ended up the consensus at the face to face meeting in T.O. 
At that same meeting, I understood that this would in fact be done to Daniel's document "evalauto" which would serve as the basis of this and other discussions (Daniel?). 
Regarding the use of alt=" "... (I'm assuming this use where the author is using a transparent gif for spacing): Going back to the guideline 1 as a basis for this particular discussion: Guideline 1. Provide equivalent alternatives to auditory and visual content. 
The relevant word here to me is "content". 
It seems to me that if I wish to separate content from presentation, and I am using a transparent gif for presentation (which has already broken this concept I know, but assuming it is already being used &amp; our tool is trying to repair it), then there would be no need to provide alternative representation for it (eg. 
spacer). 
If anything, it seems that it would interrupt the flow of content read out in a screen reader. 
I realize that written in the checkpoint (1.1) it says: "Provide a text equivalent for every non-text element... 
This includes...images used as... spacers". 
This suggests that using alt=" " would be "illegal". 
Given the amount written on this particular issue this seems, as noted in a previous note, to be a 'hot' topic. 
As we are focussed on writing tools, I would suggest that we abstract and modularize this component and provide a (tool) user configurable setting. 
In other words, let the person who will be using the tool have the choice as to how they wish to eval/repair this particular instance (etc. 
if alt="" or alt=" ", then pass/fail). 
Of course then there is the issue about what would be the "default" which appears to bring the issue back into our faces. 
The benefit, though, is that it 'lightens' the issue and allows us to carry on with tool development. 
In fact, perhaps an additional column could be added to "evalauto" where we could place multiple choices for the user to decide?
