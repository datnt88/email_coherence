<s> Hi folks -- anyone got any pointers to references/material on how to test specific pieces of software to see if they are "accessible" (for common definitions of the word)?  </s>

<s> Jared Spool's company, UI Engineering here in Mass is a great resource.  </s>

<s> Lots of papers and reference material here.  </s>
<s> Keep in mind that both Lila Laux and Shawn Henry are members of this list.  </s>
<s> Both are proffessional usability engineers.  </s>
<s> I believe that Kitch Barnacle at Trace has a strong background in usability engineering.  </s>

<s> WebABLE, Inc. provides usability testing and inspections as part of it's core service offerings.  </s>

<s> Unfortunately, there are very  </s>

<s> It is my personal profession, as I believe it is for Lila and Shawn.  </s>

<s> Wow, what a great resource Mike's reply is!  </s>
<s> Just one little thing.  </s>
<s> I got lost just at the end.  </s>
<s> Can you expand just a bit on what you mean by 'accomodation' in this sentence?  </s>
<s> What is it that the mainstream of usability skills and practice doesn't quite prepare you for in doing disability access evaluations?  </s>

<s> Thanks for the kind thoughts Al. Regarding my experience with accommodations for user testing involving people with disabilities, I note the following: 1. Usability testing methods employ several different techniques -- but the key to all of them is direct interaction with the test participant.  </s>
<s> So, problem number one is: Most usability companies have limited or no access to users with disabilities.  </s>
<s> There is limited communication and/or experience in using people with disabilities as test subjects.  </s>
<s> 2. Many usability testing and design practices require user feedback, user interviews, user observation.  </s>
<s> Thus, usability testing labs are often set up to record test sessions via video and audio.  </s>
<s> These labs are rarely set up to be intrinsically accessible themselves.  </s>
<s> Labs don't accomodate wheelchairs; computer systems don't include screen readers, magnifiers, etc... 3. Usability engineers are great "people, people".  </s>
<s> They usually understand the natural difficulties and user needs of people without disabilities -- but their awareness of the disability cultures is weak at best, often awkward.  </s>
<s> This is problematic in that it leads to what I call the "natural selection process" -- they rarely, if ever, include people with disabilities in their standard testing practices.  </s>
<s> (For those lurking, this is *not* intended to be an absolute -- just a personal observation and opinion) 4. Awareness -- we in the disabilities communities (personal and professional) have done little to educate the usability community.  </s>
<s> This needs to be stepped up considerably.  </s>
<s> I believe Harvey Bingham's recent study in this area proves this very point.  </s>
<s> I hold myself responsible because I have been in this field for close to 10 years now.  </s>
<s> I should be doing much more.  </s>
<s> Unfortunately, the economy demands otherwise.  </s>
<s> But, as I noted, WebABLE, Inc., (as well as Optavia) has made it part of our general service offerings to our clients.  </s>
<s> And, I am making it a point to include in all my presentations, seminars, and workshops, as well as writings.  </s>
<s> We have other plans for the near future that I believe will help promote this very important need.  </s>

<s> Hi Kynn, Look at IBM's software accessibility information.  </s>
