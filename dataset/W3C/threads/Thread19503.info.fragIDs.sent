<s> The Amaya team is proud to announce the availability of the 1.4 release of the Amaya editor/browser.  </s>
<s> Only Unix releases are available today.  </s>
<s> Windows  </s>
<s> versions will be available soon (please take into account some possible delay  </s>
<s> due to holidays).  </s>
<s> This release includes new features like the browser mode and a new interface to create tables.  </s>
<s> It also includes bug fixes.  </s>
<s> Binaries are available at:  </s>
<s> Source is available at: A FAQ is available at http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/FAQ.html We wish you a merry editing and a happy new Amaya browsing!!! To know more about Amaya releases see http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/New.html Extensions 1.4: * OPTGROUP elements are accepted within SELECT elements.  </s>
<s> The corresponding cascade menus are built by Amaya and the right string is sent to the server when submitting a form that contains OPTGROUPs.  </s>
<s> An item in the Types/Form menu allows the user to create OPTGROUP elements or to wrap OPTION elements into an OPTGROUP element.  </s>
<s> * elements FIELDSET and LEGEND from HTML 4.0 are implemented.  </s>
<s> * Event attributes like onmousedown, onmousemove, etc. are listed in a sub-menu of the Attributes menu (Events sub-menu).  </s>
<s> * When creating a Table, Amaya asks the user about the number of rows and columns s/he wants.  </s>
<s> When a new cell is created, the corresponding column is generated at the same position.  </s>
<s> * When target icons were introduced, it was no longer possible to click the target element (an element with an ID attribute or an anchor with a NAME) to set a link.  </s>
<s> This possibility is available now.  </s>
<s> * When reloading a document, the fresh document is shown in the formatted window at the position the previous version was shown.  </s>
<s> * When saving a document in XML, Amaya follows the Voyager guidelines (http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-html-in-xml) * When printing a document, you can decide whether the document URL is printed at the top of each page or not.  </s>
<s> * A new field in the dialogue form used to insert images allows the user to enter an ALT attribute.  </s>
<s> This attribute is mandatory.  </s>
<s> * libwww has been upgraded to version 5.2.  </s>
<s> This version of libwww supports HTTP/1.1, rev.  </s>
<s> 05 * A first implementation of the message digest authentication protocol, as defined in draft-ietf-http-authentication-03 .  </s>
<s> The code is interoperable with the current (which is an old) implementation of this protocol inside Apache/1.3.  </s>
<s> * When Amaya detects errors in a loaded document, it generates a log file which can be displayed by the entry "Show log file" in the menu "Special".  </s>
<s> * Thot compilers (str, prs, tra and app) are available on Windows platforms, so it's now possible to develop Amaya on these platforms.  </s>
<s> * When an URI points at a single image, Amaya can display this image in a document window.  </s>
<s> * Each Amaya window can be switched from Read-Only (editor) to Read-Write (Browser) mode, and vice versa.  </s>
<s> Fixed bugs 1.4: * In the menu associated with a SELECT multiple element it's now possible to deselect selected OPTIONs * Table formatting: - Amaya wasn't able to find the correct cell width when the contents of this cell was centered or when a cell included complex structures.  </s>
<s> - When a table of a given width included constrained and unconstrained cells the result was sometimes incorrect.  </s>
<s> - When a table with vertical spans was resized, row heights were not updated.  </s>
<s> * Amaya constrained the structure and reordered some elements in the HEAD: Meta, Script, Link, Style.  </s>
<s> * Command Apply Class did not work always, especially when the current selection was crossing elements at different levels.  </s>
<s> * Relative URIs for background images were always interpreted according to the document URI, even when it was relative to a stylesheet.  </s>
<s> * A background image in no-repeat mode was sometimes repeated erroneously.  </s>
<s> * Amaya tended to raise windows too often.  </s>
<s> * Moving the cursor accross tables and BR elements didn't work correctly.  </s>
<s> * When a character '&amp;' appeared in an ALT attribute (and in some other attributes), it was saved as is in the HTML file.  </s>
<s> It's now saved as '&amp;amp;' * The use of autoconf has been improved to make the Amaya building easier.  </s>

<s> Hi, I'm about to release the new version of Amaya on Windows.  </s>
<s> So the old makefiles are not up-to-date and you can't use them to build Amaya 1.4.  </s>
<s> Please wait for the new announcement.  </s>
<s> Ramzi.  </s>
<s> Hello, This morning, I obtained, extracted and build Amaya 1.4 successfully on my HPUX 10.20 machine.  </s>
<s> No problem so far.  </s>
<s> Now the installation and first time running Amaya 1.4.  </s>
<s> I already have amaya 1.3a running so I know what to expect.  </s>
<s> Installing the software, I started putting amaya 1.4 over 1.3a: - `gmake install` complained: the softlink from the bin directory to the real executable cannot be created.  </s>
<s> True, it was already available.  </s>
<s> Please update the install with a check for existing of components and act on it.  </s>
<s> Since putting 1.4 over 1.3 was an accident, I moved the 1.3 install tree and installed amaya 1.4 in a fresh place: - `gmake install` complained: the directory given with `configure --prefix=...` is not available.  </s>
<s> Most installs create this directory but amaya does not.  </s>
<s> It would be nice if the install creates the directory.  </s>
<s> After creating the prefix directory: - `gmake install` complained: the prefix /bin directory is not available.  </s>
<s> Since other subdirs are created, the install must create this dir as well.  </s>
<s> So far so good: I succeeded in installing.  </s>
<s> Now the running part: In the source tree, there is a lot of documentation in the doc directory.  </s>
<s> These docs are not installed with `gmake install` and there is no target in the makefile to install this documentation on its own (at least, not documented).  </s>
<s> Please install the documentation with the executable.  </s>
<s> Ok, I copied the doc directory to the installation and I started amaya.  </s>
<s> With Amaya 1.3 I have not put a homepage in my .thotrc  </s>
<s> file, homepage is empty.  </s>
<s> This expects amaya to start with an empty page but it starts with: /appl/tools/amaya/share/thot/amaya/AmayaPage.html.  </s>
<s> I recal I've updated amaya 1.3 to take this page for a default homepage but I never put it in the settings for 1.4.  </s>
<s> I found the name AmayaPage.html in the file amaya/init.c but the file is not in the doc directory.  </s>
<s> Where is AmayaPage.html?  </s>
<s> How can I configure a default homepage (being empty)?  </s>
<s> Please update the defaults for Amaya to something that works after install: default the homepage to this AmayaPage.html on the local file system.  </s>
<s> By the way: The help- browsing (and other help- ...) button directs to something on the web (the proxy username &amp; password box comes up) but crashes amaya once it arives.  </s>
<s> In the distribution, there is a file doc/amaya/Browsing.html.  </s>
<s> Please default amaya to obtain the help info from the local file system, not from the web.This speeds-up the help on our side and does not slow down your server.  </s>
<s> By the way, I got amaya running and as far as I can see, 1.4 is better than 1.3.  </s>
<s> Thanks for Amaya.  </s>

<s> Done  </s>
<s> You have to do make uninstall to remove the previous installation.  </s>
<s> That should work in next release.  </s>
<s> Done  </s>
<s> The amaya home page is located in the directory Thot/amaya If you want to set your default home page you have to edit the variable HOME_PAGE=xxx in your file $HOME/.thotrc  </s>
<s> but xx should exist.  </s>
<s> Personally I open by default my HotList.html file.  </s>
<s> Amaya look for the help page on the Web because the install procedure doesn't copy the documentation.  </s>
<s> That should be fixed in next release.  </s>
<s> Nevertheless Amaya shouldn't crash.  </s>
<s> Thanks Irene.  </s>
<s> Can you document it with the next release?  </s>
<s> You are right telling me I sould not overwrite the previous release but I think if it is not good overwriting the previous release, it is easy checking the emptyness of the installation directory and act accordingly.  </s>
<s> This homepage remains in the source tree which is not accessable for other  </s>
<s> users.  </s>
<s> The installation directory is available to them.  </s>
<s> Please provide a  </s>
<s> route to install this documentation with the executable.  </s>
<s> How do I create/modify the default $HOME/.thotrc?  </s>
<s> I'd like to modify this default to set the homepage and proxy variables.  </s>
<s> As written, the HOME_PAGE= is set to nothing, I'd expect an emty page.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, now it's empty, it fetches /appl/tools/amaya/share/thot/amaya/AmayaPage.html, where /appl/tools/amaya comes from `../configure --prefix=/appl/tools/amaya`.  </s>
<s> The file is not available after installation.  </s>
<s> For most of the (our) users, the internet is not available.  </s>
<s> How can I change this?  </s>
<s> What I'd like to see is:  </s>
<s> - Option to `configure` for the documentation root if not given, default to current usage if filespec: put it there if URL: expect it being there.  </s>
<s> - Option to `configure` for the homepage (for fallback / for .thotrc  </s>
<s> default) if not given, default to current usage if filespec: put it there if not already there.  </s>
<s> if URL: expect it being there.  </s>
<s> - default .thotrc  </s>
<s> file for system wide defaults.  </s>
<s> (if already available, document it) For most of my whishes, i've found routes to fulfill them, except for the help being not available to users without internet access.  </s>
