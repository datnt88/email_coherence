rom the Memphis minutes: 
-- Koen Holtman will draft a clarification that a qvalue of 0.0 means "Don't send me this." 
The clarification (taken from the slide I showed in the Memphis evening session) is one new sentence in section 3.9 of the 1.1 spec. 
The new sentence is between ** **. 3.9 Quality Values HTTP content negotiation (section 12) uses short "floating point" numbers to indicate the relative importance ("weight") of various negotiable parameters. 
A weight is normalized to a real number in the range 0 through 1, where 0 is the minimum and 1 the maximum value. 
**If a parameter has a quality value of 0, then content with this parameter is `not acceptable' for the client.** 
HTTP/1.1 applications MUST NOT generate more than three digits after the decimal point. 
User configuration of these values SHOULD also be limited in this fashion. 
Koen. 
From the Memphis minutes: 
That change does not belong in that section -- it belongs in the sections on the Accept* header fields. 
Servers send qvalues too.

Roy T. Fielding: 
The interpretation of q=0 is a general thing, so it belongs in the general section as far as I am concerned. 
And servers do not send qvalues in HTTP/1.1. 
They do send them under TCN, but such a qs=0 will still mean that the content is not acceptable for the client. 
I'm willing to change my proposal from is `not acceptable' for the client to will be `not acceptable' for the client but I think it would be a mistake to move this to the Accept* sections. 
Koen.
