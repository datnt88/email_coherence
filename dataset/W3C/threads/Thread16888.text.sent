I assumed that title and status content was read by screen readers, this appears not to be the case. 
can anyone advise me if this is a configuration issue? 
thanks jonathan Hi, My understanding is JAWS will read forms with title tags in them as long as there isn't a label associated with it. 
I know for sure JAWS will read title tags in a tags, provided the user has their settings set properly. 
Window-Eyes will read titles for forms that don't have a label in them. 
However, Window=-Eyes will not read title tags in the a tag. 
When I asked GW Micro, the creators of Window-Eyes if they could add this feature, they said they didn't see the need. 
Hope that helps!

thanks jonathan This is particularly confusing given that there was a recent proposal on www-html to allow multiple title elements and include them in the body as an alternative ot the head (I don't think it was well received, but it was made). 
At first I thought you were talking about that proposal until I realised you really meant title attributes. 
I only have experience with JAWS, and I'm guessing you mean the title attribute. 
We happen to have tested this just today. 
It can - if you make it so it reads tooltips. 
That's under...uh... 
I only have that at work. 
You have to get into the configuration management, which I forget the right options for. 
Then, it's Set Options - Verbosity Options - your current level's Preferences - Tooltip. 
That's with JAWS 4.02, I believe it is. 
-Leanne Yes, that is what I meant. 
The title attribute, like: Sorry for the confusion.

-Leanne I understand that jaws version 4 and above allows you to set what type of alternative text attribute is read. 
Either alt, title, on-screen text, or the longest of those if more than one exists. 
I also understand that the new version of Jaws (4.5) allows you to set a kind of cascade for the alternative texts. 
so that for example, the longest of them is read first, otherwise alt is read first if it exists, or then title, then the on-screen text, then... src (for images etc. i assume) ... and so on. 
I am not sure if different cascades can be set like this for different html elements other than links or graphics. 
With forms, I think that Jaws will still try to read the label if it exists. 
Hope this info is useful. 
Mat.
