<s> The IESG has reviewed the Internet-Draft "Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.0" draft-ietf-http-v10-spec-05.txt, .ps and recommends that it be published by the RFC Editor as an Informational RFC, but with the following IESG Note: The IESG has concerns about this protocol, and expects this document to be replaced relatively soon by a standards track document.  </s>
<s> This document is the product of the HyperText Transfer Protocol Working Group.  </s>
<s> The IESG contact persons are Keith Moore and Harald Alvestrand.  </s>
<s> Maybe I'm being a bit picky here, but it should be made clear that there  </s>
<s> are no known plans in the HTTP WG to replace the HTTP/1.0 document, nor to  </s>
<s> replace the HTTP/1.0 protocol described in the document in question.  </s>
<s> There certainly are plans to come out soon with a *different document*, and that document will described a *different protocol*, namely HTTP/1.1.  </s>
<s> Of course, there are also plans to try to get as much of the world to adopt the new protocol as soon as we can.  </s>
<s> However, this is an implementation issue.  </s>
<s> First of all, it's important to view this statement in light of how the IETF standards process works.  </s>
<s> Protocols are normally defined and either declared to be informational or else proceed down the standards track: proposed standard, draft standard, and finally standard.  </s>
<s> A updated protocol can be defined at some point.  </s>
<s> When complete it normally obsoletes the older protocol, and if the old version was a standard it is usually moved to historical status.  </s>
<s> (The move to historical seems somewhat haphazard in its application -- for example, RFC1113-1115 (PEM) have been moved, but RFC1425-1427, which have also been obsoleted by newer documents of the same or higher grade, have not.  </s>
<s> I don't pretend to understand the nuances here.) In any case, there is never any attempt to replace or withdraw the document per se -- once issued, an RFC there forever.  </s>
<s> Protocol version numbers offer an interesting twist, however.  </s>
<s> The usual intent is for the new version of the protocol to obsolete the old protocol eventually.  </s>
<s> I believe this is the intent for, say, RIPv2, SNMPv2, and IPv6.  </s>
<s> But there seem to be no hard-and-fast rules for this.  </s>
<s> As far as I know it would be perfectly permissible to have two standard protocols, Pv1 and Pv2, with overlapping functionality and no intent to ever obsolete the earlier version.  </s>
<s> Another thing to keep in mind is that the history of protocol versioning in the IETF doesn't present a pretty picture.  </s>
<s> We have cases where things were clearly botched, like MIME-version.  </s>
<s> We have cases of near-botches, such as IMAP3.  </s>
<s> The inescapable conclusion is that the IETF really doesn't do versioning very well.  </s>
<s> Whether this is a problem intrinsic to the IETF or simply a protocol with protocol versions in general is a matter of opinion.  </s>
<s> In any case, I view the IESG statement as effectively saying that "this protocol will be marked as obsolete the minute there is something to obsolete it with".  </s>
<s> This is a strong statement and one quite different from the implicit default, which I would characterize as "this protocol, like any other, may be obsoleted by something else in the future".  </s>
<s> I do think the use of the term "replace" in this context was unforunate, since it is not the term that is normally used, nor does it accurately convey a sense of what actually happens.  </s>
<s> I recommend that the IESG change the wording to use the term "obsolete" explicitly.  </s>
<s> Wording aside, this is a strong statement for the IESG to make, and I would also characterize it as a measure of just how uncomfortable the IESG is with HTTP/1.0.  </s>
<s> (Please note that I'm simply making an observation here -- I am not offering an opinion of whether or not I think the IESG is correct in its assessment.)  </s>
<s> I'm a bit unclear as to the nature of your discomfort.  </s>
<s> If you were concerned that the document will simply disappear, that just doesn't happen.  </s>
<s> Obsoleting one RFC with another, however, is another matter -- this *is* the mechanism the IETF uses to indicate to the world that people should adopt a new protocol instead of the old one.  </s>
<s> If you're still uncomfortable with this document being obsoleted at some point, then I think we may have a problem that deserves further discussion.  </s>
