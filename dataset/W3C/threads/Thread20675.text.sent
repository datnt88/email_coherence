Dear Amaya programmers, I use Windows NT4.0 with SP 5.0. 
I have deinstalled Amaya (V. 4.2.1) because it repeatedly crashed. 
Unfortunately, there were no error messages, but the crashes seemed to be associated with opening and closing multiple windows, so I suspect a memory leak. 
Errors : In the documentation : the Editor icon is greyed out, not crossed out, when the editor mode is inactive. 
Even though text has been marked, choosing "print marked text" prints the whole text. 
Cancelling a print job results in an error window and the error message "Error - Source: GifCreate(2):pixmap ==" It may be that a long print job hangs. 
Suggested "improvements" It would be nice to be able to print specific pages of a long web page (e.g., the documentation after "make book") I would like for Amaya to make a backup copy (.bak, .wbk, 
...) automatically. 
A user-defined number of backup copies (.b01, .b02, 
...) would be really nice. 
One can not blame the project members for following Microsoft's example and requiring "normal" users to have write and delete access to program and administrator directories, but I would prefer to be able to separate program, data, and auxiliary files and to be able to assign rights to specific groups of users or groups of users. 
Therefore, I suggest that Amaya use a central .ini 
file for those parameters which the must be centrally set and for those parameters which the administrator wishes to centrally determine (i.e., override of locally set parameters). 
In addition, I suggest either a list paths to the user directories in the central .ini 
file (e.g., [JDoe] C:\JDoe\Auxiliary\Amara or having the administrator set up a variable in the users "autoexec.bat" 
(e.g., amarya_user_root) and installing the local option file(s), etc. in this directory. 
Based on a very recent experience, I would not like to see Amaya crash or go into an endless loop if the file is not there, but instead fail gracefully and issue a meaningful error message. 
Items which do not conform to the Windows standard (at least, until Microsoft adopts the method) are The use of CTRL-w instead of ALT-F4 to exit the programm. 
CTRL-p calls printer setup (I think it was printer setup) instead of printing. 
I like the appearance, and the functions seem to be OK, at least until a crash, so I'll keep checking amaya.com and try the next version when it comes out. 
Yours, R. G. McKenzie R. G. McKenzie Language_Consulting@web.de said: For the moment, an easy way to achieve this is to print to a file and use ghostview to print selected pages out of the file. 
Peace, Bertrand Ibrahim.

You should try V 4.3.2 as it's the most recent one :) Here's just a short answer on one of your points. 
We'll get to you for the other ones. 
I fixed this in the latest version. 
The abort button aborted the application and it wasn't possible to abort a printout once it had started.
