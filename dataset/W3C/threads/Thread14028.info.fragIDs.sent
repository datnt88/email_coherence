<s> I am referring to the kind of research in psychology, cognition, comprehension and education, the importance of which Chuck Hitchcock has been repeatedly emphasizing in these discussions.  </s>
<s> If improvements are to be made, as I believe they ought to be, then they must be based on well established research findings, ideally a consensus of opinion within the community of researchers and educators that is concerned with the needs of people with cognitive disabilities.  </s>
<s> In most of the other areas addressed by the guidelines, there has been widespread agreement among researchers and people with disabilities themselves as to what the problems and preferred solution strategies are.  </s>
<s> Cognitive issues, as they are related to questions of comprehension, are substantially more complex than the problems which arise in making documents accessible in a multiplicity of media, or user interfaces operable with a range of input devices.  </s>
<s> Since people with cognitive disabilities may be less well placed to represent their own needs and advocate their own preferred approaches within the context of guideline development, than are other relevant parties, the opinions of specialists are likely to assume greater significance in this area.  </s>
<s> As a consequence, it is especially important to ensure that whatever solutions are included in the guidelines, have broad support among those who have expertise in cognition, psychology, the education of individuals with cognitive disabilities, etc.  </s>
<s> As my knowledge of these issues is somewhat limited, as this aspect of the discussion moves forward I will be persuaded not only by the most compelling arguments but also by those which are best supported within the research community.  </s>
<s> JW:: "I will be persuaded not only by the most compelling arguments but also by those which are best supported within the research community."  </s>
<s> WL: As long as you don't become a "slave to fashion" this might be a sound approach.  </s>
<s> The history of "scientific" research, particularly in the fields under discussion, is replete with a long series of successful efforts to debunk earlier "best supported within the research community" positions.  </s>
<s> Just as there was little sympathy within the blind community for "rehab agency" approaches to counter-productive measures seeking inclusion, the current attempts to determine who "knows what's best" for people with cognitive/learning anomalies are characterized by attitudes typified by pejorative usages: "retard", "stupid", and even "illiterate".  </s>
<s> JW:: "Since people with cognitive disabilities may be less well placed to represent their own needs and advocate their own preferred approaches within the context of guideline development, than are other relevant parties, the opinions of specialists are likely to assume greater significance..." WL: Of course this signifies much of the previous attitudes as well as the present one.  </s>
<s> The deaf community has a little different perspective on Alexander Graham Bell than those of us with cell phones growing out of our ears and the widely held theory among the "research community" was that deafness was inextricably intertwined with reduced mental capacity, hence "deaf and dumb" - wherein dumb came to mean more than just "mute".  </s>
<s> Although this is a very difficult matter for those of us who are addicted to text, we must attend to the preferences of the affected population - and be very selective about "authority".  </s>
<s> It's not that we must proceed without attending to theoretical matters, just that we must keep our eye on the doughnut rather than the hole.  </s>
<s> Love.  </s>
<s> ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE  </s>
<s> William and I are in agreement here, I suspect; the problem is that the community in question is not well positioned to represent itself; therefore one must be cautious in ensuring that strategies which purport to meet such needs are well grounded in practice and observation.  </s>
<s> Naturally you are entitled to your viewpoint however, as someone working in the field, I can assure you this seems like a very poor excuse for inaction.  </s>
<s> As the www and W3C have been around a while I had hoped you might be refering to research already undertaken.  </s>
<s> Many media produce materials that are accesible to non-readers, and that is with very little and probably no theory.  </s>
<s> To what extent do you imagine that these detailed and compelling arguments will be accessible to non specialists, they will not be.  </s>
<s> A few examples will go a lot further, they will need to be tested, and there will need to be more than one approach, and they will be the tests.  </s>
<s> is a very interesting example of an expensive piece of EU funded research in email for non-readers, it is taking 3 years, probably longer than the www has had accessible pictures.  </s>

<s> I agree with the sentiments that Chris has expressed.  </s>
<s> Research findings should be able to indicate what types of cognitive limitations exist, the kinds of communication strategies which have proved most effective in minimising their impact, etc.  </s>
<s> At this stage we do not appear to have broad agreement even in connection with such basic points.  </s>
<s> The next question would be, which solutions are best applicable universally, across the web  </s>
<s> as a whole, and ought therefore to be included in the guidelines.  </s>
<s> We already have one such proposal, namely the priority 1 checkpoint which demands that language be kept as clear and straightforward as possible, and a priority 3 suggestion that graphical supplements are a suitable aid to comprehension where applicable and appropriate.  </s>
<s> There have also been suggestions that the requirement for clear and consistent navigation and orientation mechanisms are of significant cognitive value.  </s>
<s> The question which emerges is whether there are any further, or more specific requirements that should be introduced.  </s>
<s> Several strategies have been put forward in this discussion, but as I have already remarked, there is by no means agreement on which are the most effective; and this is the area in which I think research-based expertise can contribute.  </s>
<s> Indeed, Gregg has already shown this to be the case in his insightful contributions to this discussion during a number of teleconferences.  </s>
<s> Jason wrote on 8/2/99:  </s>
<s> I too agree with this view and want to offer a few additional comments.  </s>
<s> Gregg and I recently participated in a teleconference working group organized by the World Institute on Disability (WID) pertaining to cognitive issues and telecommunications.  </s>
<s> There were many opinions but we had some difficulty estimating populations for various groups and then agreeing on a theoretical model for cognition.  </s>
<s> WID had to complete this work for a contract with a well-known university and brought together many experts with a wide range of views and opinions.  </s>
<s> In the end, the model selected by the person charged with writing the report was used.  </s>
<s> Since time was short, we basically decided to do what was reasonably expedient.  </s>
<s> The question which emerges is whether there are any further, or more specific requirements that should be introduced.  </s>
<s> I suspect that we should attempt to include one or two additional categories here.  </s>
<s> One that immediately comes to mind has to do with the logical presentation of information.  </s>
<s> Many writers know how to develop an idea so that it will be inclusive of a wide range of readers but we also know that for some, it is important to gain a sense of the whole, to know where one is headed, before chewing into the details.  </s>
<s> This can be done with abstracts but we are looking at ways to compress content into main and sub-headings prior to presenting the whole.  </s>
<s> XML and CSS seem like a good direction but we are working mostly within the constraints of HTML for the moment.  </s>
<s> Methods for emphasizing the main points are also under consideration.  </s>
<s> Of course all of this can get very complicated depending on the author's purpose and style.  </s>
<s> Another pertains to the ordering of the information and how it is presented on the page.  </s>
<s> In informal applied research in high schools, we have been experimenting with how images and links are used within a talking browser that also provides synchronized highlighting of text as it is read.  </s>
<s> One other point has to do with the functionality that should be in the browser.  </s>
<s> It should be possible, for example, to help those who are easily distracted and perhaps a bit disorganized by providing a tool which highlights content for those who can see the page.  </s>
<s> This method can focus attention on selected areas of the text or media (this is tricky) and help some to stay focused.  </s>
<s> The browser should contain this capability although a small Power Tool might do the trick.  </s>
<s> An approach that we might consider is to put forward a brief list of similar ideas then do some searching to establish that there is support for the ideas and solutions.  </s>
<s> In some cases, we will be able to find specific research findings.  </s>
<s> In other cases, we may have to rely on tested usability guidelines when they are both available and commonly agreed to.  </s>
<s> It may be a good idea to indicate which items can be supported with applied and/or pure research.  </s>
<s> Chuck  </s>
<s> It seems clear that guideline 12 would provide a suitable rubric under which to introduce several of the considerations that Chuck Hitchcock has mentioned.  </s>
<s> Furthermore, "orientation and navigation" is a category of content which must appear, to a greater or lesser degree, in every web site, irrespective of its nature or subject matter.  </s>
<s> This is a complex subject.  </s>
<s> as an analogy imagine taking a photo, now it does represent a part of reality.  </s>
<s> However if we insisted on understanding the semantics of images before using it we would have problems.  </s>
<s> It is a fact that images are more accessible than words to non readers.  </s>
<s> To recommend their use is hardly controversial.  </s>
<s> However to construct a theory of narrative use of images and its success with LD is very difficult.  </s>
<s> This is tantamount to predicting if a (film) story will be successful, and this is notoriously difficult.  </s>
<s> It has to amuse motivate educate and generally fit the needs of carer and user, a tall order.  </s>
<s> did you look at William Loughborough's reworking of the WAI homepage.  </s>

<s> WL: I hate to keep quibbling about this but *WORDS* are not the same thing as their representation in text *OR* images.  </s>
<s> Further, textual versions of words are themselves images.  </s>
<s> The graphical images we keep trying to talk about are slippery as to what words they are supposed to signify, more so than the (simpler?) images called "text."  </s>
<s> The URL Jonathan gives is of course not the version of the WAI page that I devised and of which he speaks.  </s>
<s> The experimental draft version I made is on one of my hosted sites and if anyone is interested email me privately and I'll point you to it.  </s>
<s> It is definitely not to be confused with any official version and should not be made public.  </s>
<s> It is merely an attempt to begin examining some of the issues that Jonathan, Anne and others have raised: we must attend more closely to the large portion of potential Web users who have different comprehension needs than the other PWDs we are trying to serve.  </s>
<s> The continued exclusion of learning/cognitive disabled folks is simply not acceptable.  </s>
<s> We cannot blindly (pun intended) accept the fashions dictated by authorities in the "research establishment" in these matters but must seek input from the affected population.  </s>
<s> To blow my own horn, this matter is addressed in the talk I gave at Toronto: http://dicomp.pair.com/talk.htm  </s>
<s> - the pertinent quote is "the most significant thing that I learned in all that is that you must listen carefully to your friends/clients and even if it's your show, have the mind set that they are in charge."  </s>
<s> The Working Groups of WAI have input that is heeded from some PWDs but the people spoken of herein have as their *ONLY* input, some stuff from people who work as their "teachers", mostly Jonathan, Anne, and Chuck.  </s>
<s> This is something we must undertake because we have so much to learn from people who have not been burdened by reading all their lives - a problem from which all the rest of us suffer: "how do you know that?" - "I read it somewhere"!!! Love.  </s>
<s> ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE  </s>
<s> No, I'm suggesting more than just waiting for the research results to come in.  </s>
<s> I think that there are some positive things we can do now, such as raising the priority of illustrating pages, which clearly take us closer to where we want to be.  </s>
<s> I hope that further research can provide us with techniques which take us even closer.  </s>
<s> I realise that in requirements like "write as clearly as possible", "illustrate with appropriate non-text equivalents", and the like, it is much easier to understand the intent than to check whether it has been carried out.  </s>
<s> Actually I think the intent of the phrases can be understood by people with very severe cognitive difficulties, but testing whether something meets the requirements means being able to show how something can be improved, and evaluate the significance of the improvement - clearly a complex task indeed.  </s>
<s> I think it is clear that we want to improve accessibility for the cognitively disabled.  </s>
<s> I think that means helping them to engage with content on the web, and we can do that by rendering content in a way which can be understood by as wide a group as possible.  </s>
<s> I note that understanding is not a binary condition, but accesibility in general is not a binary condition.  </s>

<s> The one phrase in Charles' contribution to which I take exception is "non-text equivalents".  </s>
<s> As Gregg has persuasively argued on several occasions, it is not feasible to propose the inclusion of "non-text equivalents" of textual content, except in cases where the concepts being conveyed are sufficiently simple and every-day to permit a clear and widely recognisable visual representation.  </s>
<s> One needs to think, rather, in terms of visual supplements that clarify the meaning of textual material, for example in the manner that a chart or graph can be used to summarise a data table, or in which an image can identify the subject of a newspaper article, or in which layout can convey the structure of a document.  </s>
<s> The central misconception inherent in the expression "non-text equivalent" is the implication that it is possible to represent complex concepts non-linguistically--that is to say, without having ultimate recourse to language.  </s>
<s> It should also be remembered that there are fields of knowledge which are not amenable to visual (or more generally, non-linguistic) depiction.  </s>
<s> To take an extreme example, it has been argued that one of the principal reasons for introducing rigorous proofs into mathematical analysis during the nineteenth century was precisely the impossibility of constructing graphs that could represent the functions then under consideration.  </s>
<s> Hence, "geometric intuitions" could no longer serve as an adequate basis of mathematical reasoning in the calculus.  </s>
<s> Other fields, in linguistics, philosophy and the social sciences could readily be cited to show that there are contexts in which visual aids, even if not entirely infeasible, would fail completely to convey the meaning of the text and could not therefore be characterised as equivalent thereto.  </s>
<s> Of course, the same observation holds true in respect of certain auditory and visual presentations (for example, visual art and music, respectively); however it remains possible to explain the over-all effect, purpose or style of the artwork to a person who possesses the requisite vocabulary and concepts, through a description, which, however, can not do justice to the complexity and uniqueness of the artistic production itself.  </s>
<s> My argument is simply that attempting to convey complex thoughts non-linguistically is an even more problematic undertaking and generally assumes the prior acquisition, on the part of the recipient, of concepts which can only be developed in and through language.  </s>
<s> The more complex and specialised the discipline, the more obvious this problem becomes.  </s>
<s> I agree with Jason that in many cases it is impossible to create a non-textual version of a text and still communicate the same ideas.  </s>
<s> In many more cases it is prohibitively expensive (think of the difference in price between writing a book and producing a movie).  </s>
<s> However there are many cases where it is possible - a classic example is the use of graphs and charts or modern algebraic representation to illustrate mathematical concepts that are extraordinarily difficult to express in language (although I know that Jason and others have managed to perform mathematics through language - difficult and impossible are very different).  </s>
<s> The notion of equivalence which we use allows and requires us to understand that some equivalents are better replacements than others.  </s>
<s> This applies to both textual and non-text equivalents.  </s>
<s> Perhaps we need to make the point more clearly in our definitions.  </s>
<s> Charles McCN The one phrase in Charles' contribution to which I take exception is "non-text equivalents".  </s>
<s> As Gregg has persuasively argued on several occasions, it is not feasible to propose the inclusion of "non-text equivalents" of textual content, except in cases where the concepts being conveyed are sufficiently simple and every-day to permit a clear and widely recognisable visual representation.  </s>
<s> One needs to think, rather, in terms of visual supplements that clarify the meaning of textual material, for example in the manner that a chart or graph can be used to summarise a data table, or in which an image can identify the subject of a newspaper article, or in which layout can convey the structure of a document.  </s>
<s> and so forth...  </s>
<s> Is the graph of a function equivalent to its equation?  </s>
<s> I am not sure how to answer such a question, but I would tend to say that they both express the same relationship in different ways.  </s>
<s> However, and more importantly, the effect of a sound or image is usually to supplement text, and not to operate as a substitute for it.  </s>
<s> Charles and I are in agreement that there is an upper limit to the conceptual complexity that can be conveyed non-linguistically.  </s>
<s> This is why I am arguing that instead of thinking in terms of "non-textual equivalents to text", we should instead be asking the question: under what circumstances should non-linguistic (auditory/visual) representations be provided as an aid to comprehension, and what recommendations can be laid down in regard to their proper use?  </s>
<s> Charles and I are in agreement, it seems, that not every actual and potential document conveys information that can be represented, or clarified, non-linguistically; but there remains a significant class of cases in which this is not only possible but also of positive cognitive benefit.  </s>
<s> We need to find ways of characterising these cases and formulating a more precise requirement that can be practically applied.  </s>
<s> With regard to non-textual communication, I know of no better source for visual strategies than the following books (copied from an earlier message from me to the WAI-IG list).  </s>
<s> They are of limited value to non-sighted individuals but are rich with ideas on how meaning may be expressed with images.  </s>
<s> I want to recommend two books to you regarding the use of graphics and images.  </s>
<s> They are both authored by Edward R. Tufte who teaches (or did teach) statistics, graphic design, and political economy at Yale University and conducts seminars on the topic of the visual display of information.  </s>

<s> I believe that Amazon sells them at a significant discount.  </s>
<s> These two books contain the best information that I know of for using images to convey information.  </s>
<s> I have no personal connection with Tufte or his work but did attend his seminar on information design a few years back in Boston.  </s>
<s> It was terrific.  </s>
<s> Chuck  </s>
<s> I find it sad if significant that chuck chose two books by tufte.  </s>
<s> There can be no doubt that Tufte's works relate to the discussion between Charles and Jason.  </s>
<s> However it is a very rich field, and in my opinionTufte is far too pseudo-scientific, how about something emotive.  </s>
<s> You seem to be concerned with the compexity of scientific concepts, which by definition rely on controls.  </s>
