<s> Hello Education and Outreach Colleagues, I was talking to a friend today -- an amateur web developer and professional  </s>
<s> disability rights advocate -- who complained that the W3C guidelines are overly technical for her needs.  </s>
<s> She wants a plain language version of the guidelines.  </s>
<s> As she is fairly technologically savvy, she expressed frustration  </s>
<s> at having to work so hard to understand what must be done to make accessible  </s>
<s> web pages.  </s>
<s> To illustrate her point, she read me the Quick Tip card description  </s>
<s> of Image map.  </s>
<s> I agree with her, the tone is definitely geeky.  </s>
<s> But not everyone  </s>
<s> who develops web pages speaks the language of client-side servers and hotspots.  </s>
<s> I would guess that most people who develop web pages are amateurs  </s>
<s> (in the original sense of the word: from amore or amour: an activity done out  </s>
<s> of love.) Will these people freeze when they read "make line by line reading  </s>
<s> sensible?" or "Use CSS?" How about we create a "user-friendly" version of the Web Content guidelines?  </s>
<s> Maybe a primer.  </s>
<s> Alan  </s>
<s> you are not the first to ask about this...this si a part of obtaining buy-in from the user community so implementation will go easier.  </s>
<s> Remember my comments from toronto last year, "create a wcag for dummies" version.... hey, are there going to be EO, WAI and WCAG meetings at the www9?  </s>

<s> WL: Great idea.  </s>
<s> Would you take that as an action item?  </s>
<s> Love.  </s>
<s> ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE  </s>
<s> What about the WCAG Curriculum?  </s>
<s> Particularly the Example Set of the WCAG Curriculum?  </s>
<s> Curriculum: http://www.starlingweb.com/wai/wcag/  </s>
<s> Example set: http://www.starlingweb.com/wai/wcag/sam1-0.htm Please note that the curriculum will be moving to W3C space in the next week or so.  </s>
<s> Don't bookmark pages in the above site as they will soon be invalid.  </s>
<s> Once the curriculum is in the W3C space, WAI EO will likely start promoting it more heavily.  </s>
