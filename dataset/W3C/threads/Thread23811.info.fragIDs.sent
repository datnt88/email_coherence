<s> And there will be another major annc very soon now, from a Conspicuously Absent Player... Adobe, Netscape, Apple at work on HTML font standard By Dana Gardner InfoWorld Electric Posted at 6:49 PM PT, Feb 26, 1996 Adobe Systems Inc., Apple Computer Inc., and Netscape Communications Corp. are working to define an HTML font standard to deliver a wider variety of fonts for ready use by World Wide Web sites, the companies announced Monday.  </s>
<s> The three companies expect to provide a cross-platform solution for using Type 1 and TrueType fonts in HTML and PDF documents.  </s>
<s> The result: a richer visual appeal for Internet-based information.  </s>
<s> Specifically, the companies plan to present: * Anti-aliased type for higher screen quality for both large and small type sizes.  </s>
<s> * Embedded, compressed fonts for fast performance over 14.4Kbps modem connections and for font fidelity.  </s>
<s> * Progressively rendered fonts that enable the screen to display text immediately.  </s>
<s> * Font subsetting that improves performance because only the characters needed will be downloaded.  </s>
<s> The fonts exploit technology under development as part of Adobe's Acrobat "Amber" Plug-in for Netscape Navigator.  </s>
<s> The new font technology will be supported in the next version of "Amber" and later this year in Netscape Navigator client software.  </s>
<s> Apple bundles Adobe Acrobat and Netscape Navigator with the Apple Internet Connection Kit and the Apple Internet Server Solution.  </s>
