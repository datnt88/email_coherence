Recently there was a rough consensus on the list in favor of special-need descriptors being sent from client to server as part of format negotiation. 
I think that we should make "the taxonomy of abilities and special needs" that these message attributes employ a development item, and that we should try to rope the doctors mentioned below into this task. 
Paul has contributed on this point on the dev-access mailing list.

Thank you for considering me. 
Dennis Anson may also be interested (dennis@u.washington.edu). 
pcc Paul, In the Web Access Initiative the idea has come up for some special-need identifiers that would be useful in characterizing how web sites should serve this particular client. 
This is an issue where I think you have something to contribute based on your posts to dev-access. 
May I mention your name to the Intiative people as someone they should talk to to help them set up their working reference taxonomy of abilities and special needs?

Physiatry Forum : ----- End of forwarded message from P. Coelco ----- Hello all, I agree with Mr. Vanderheiden. 
While developing our national standard on hardware and software accessibility we realized tha the same problem/solution could: - affect more than one disability - affect non disabled people - not all the people with that disbility may be affected therefore it makes sense to choose by client's preference, rather than by disability. 
Concerning physical disabilities, as a quadriplegic with some movements in my arms and hands, I believe that most of our problems have to do with the navigation/mail/tools. 
If the tools are acceisble, so are the contents of the pages.

: Subject: RE: Ability taxonomy bh : Date: martes 27 de mayo de 1997 5:29 : Hi Al, : I would suggest we work from either a functional viewpoint or from a : preferences viewpoint and not from a disability etiology. 
: That is that the client say : "cannot view graphics" : or : "prefer that you send text only" : or : "prefer that you send : - text only : - or voice enabled applets : and not that the client send : "blind" or "low vision" : the former has much more application beyond disability - and will extend to : hand held and nomadic devices. 
: The latter doesn't really help much anyway since people who are blind can : have very different skills and different browser / reader capabilities. 
: I'll be short - but if what I'm saying isn't clear. 
Drop me a line. 
: Thanks I agree with Gregg, to the extend that if we ever get to extent HTTP to have the client send info to the server (we need to look at what HTTP already handle, e.g, instead of "cannot view graphics", the client just doesn't ask for them, or things like regular content-type negociation), we will have to work at the functional level. 
The latter also involves some privacy matters. 
but for our own education/requirement process, I agree with Al that it would be useful to have such a taxonomy document. 
So I'd like to see someone volunteer to drive that effort. 
First, let me agree wholeheartedly with Gregg that the classification we should use is functional. 
This doesn't mean we don't need to develop something for the purposes of this group. 
I probably threw people off with the term "taxonomy." 
By this I just mean a way to name functional ability clusters. 
For the project we need a common understanding of some such ability-description framework. 
Another name for what we need is "an index of functional user abilities, as simple as we can make it while retaining all differences that matter." 
While I alluded to an earlier suggestion of disability indicators to go forward in messages, I was alluding to that for motivation and I think that there is a more fundamental need for common knowledge across the working group. 
We need to know what user differences matter before we start writing an HTTP message data dictionary, or any of our other task outputs. 
Probably there are people on the team such as Gregg and Javier that already know more than enough about this. 
We need them to teach us, people like Paul to check it out, and get it into the project bookshelf where people that join the process later can read up without tying up meeting time. 
That is my idea of the need. 
I agree with Daniel's request that we move this thread to the w3c-wai-ig list. 
Do people understand why he said that? 
What do other think? 
If you want to stay together "in plenary session" until we all understand the division of responsibilities between the two lists better, please speak up. 
Warning: Historical divisions into "content guidelines vs. browser guidelines" will probably not suffice for the future. 
Some future visions allow for control widgets in the content that comes from the server. 
I think that we really need to back off to defining requirements on the browse dialog between user and content that can later be allocated to tool and protocol by the developers. 
But this process of "backing off" ususally takes time and work. 
If this is not clear to people, we need to talk about it. 
Al Gilman Hello Daniel, Thank you for your recent messages. 
I am sorry for my slowness to respond. 
In Greg's recent e-mail to both of us he makes a point that for the nonblind or nonhearing disabled population it is the browser and hardware which need modification rather than the source code (html, xml, css,etc). 
This strikes me as true. 
Most of the disabilities that I see are motor or cognitive imparements, sometimes involving partial or temporary loss of one of the senses, ie vision, touch, etc. 
Consequently, with respect to your questions about how the W3C can modify css, xml, html, etc to suit the disabled as a whole- rather than subpopulations of disable- the answer may be that you can not. 
I guess what I am most unclear about is what the scope of the WAI is. 
I've been to WAI site and read the data there, including the following from Tim Berners-Lee: "Worldwide, there are more than 750 million people with disabilities. 
As we move towards a highly connected world, it is critical that the Web be usable by anyone, regardless of individual capabilities and disabilities," said Tim Berners-Lee, Director of the W3C and inventor of the World Wide Web. 
"The W3C is committed to removing accessibility barriers for all people with disabilities - including the deaf, blind, physically challenged, and cognitive or visually impaired. 
We plan to work aggressively with government, industry, and community leaders to establish and attain Web accessibility goals." 
And this from the President of the United States: "I commend the World Wide Web Consortium, industry sponsors, and the Yuri Rubinski Foundation for launching this important project. 
I am pleased that the Department of Education will provide funding for the Web Accessibility Initiative, and that the National Science Foundation is considering expanding its support for research and development in this area. 
My administration is committed to working with these and other organizations to ensure that this innovative project is a success." 
This language suggests that the efforts made will benefit all of the disabled. 
But as I have mentioned, I do not see how this will be accomplished with the current focus on vision impairments. 
Most of the disabled people I see have either motor or cognitive obstacles to accessing the web. 
(It goes without saying that they all have financial obstacles.) 
It would be helpful to me if you could point me toward literature which better defines what the scope of the WAI will be. 
On the topic of the disabled mailing lists: As you know, a recent topic on dev-access was the "taxonomy of disablity". 
What seems to have prompted this dialog was the list subscribers efforts to define the term accessible. 
This is where I became interested,because- having followed the dialog and read the subscribers introductions - there is a clear bias in terms of advocacy for the blind user on this list. 
Thus, I felt that the definition of access coined by this group- the dev-access list subscribers- would reflect their bias and thus be inconsistent with one of the stated goals of the WAI "... removing accessability barriers for all people with disabilities..." Thank you for your concern. 
If the topics of taxonomy or accessablity arise I would be interested in participating in the dialog.
