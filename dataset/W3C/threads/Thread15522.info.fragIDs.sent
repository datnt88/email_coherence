<s> While I'm on this topic, I have another concern wrt XML access that I want to write down shortly.  </s>
<s> Supposedly, XML user-agents might not need access to the document DTD to process it: it's ok if the document is well formed and that a style sheet is available (using an inclusion clause of some kind).  </s>
<s> My issue is related to the use of client-side style sheet, which I think is crucial for accessibility.  </s>
<s> How does a user-agent bind an arbitrary XML document to an independant style sheet without knowledge of the DTD ?  </s>
<s> We must make sure that at least the DTD name (as a unique ID of some kind) appear in every XML documents, so that client-side binding to a local "more accessible" style is always possible.  </s>
<s> It's unclear to me reading the XML spec that this is the case in the definition of what "well formed" or "valid" means.  </s>
<s> See http://www.ucc.ie/xml/#FAQ-VALIDWF  </s>
<s> There is also a lot more there.  </s>
<s> e-mail dpawson@rnib.org.uk  </s>
<s> There is a convention using processing elements.  </s>
<s> Many xml files won't have DTD's, so you can't rely on this.  </s>

<s> That's not the _user-agent_ doing the binding in this case, it's the author of the document.  </s>
<s> That's too bad and probably something we should discuss further with the XML community, because no DTD pointer mean no way to adapt the presentation on the user-agent side (independently of the author).  </s>
<s> Right.  </s>
<s> In particular, an XML document instance might use tags from two or more different DTDs, using namespaces to keep the semantics separate.  </s>
<s> So, this is specifically a CSS issue?  </s>
<s> Other stylesheet languages do not support the notion of a client-side (reader) stylesheet (since they don't support cascading).  </s>
<s> Or more generaly, without knowledge of the tag names (given in the DTD or other schema) and their semantics (not given in the DTD).  </s>
<s> It is not the case.  </s>
<s> Many XML documents will neither have reference to a DTD nor will they conform to any one in particular.  </s>

<s> to follow up on what Daniel Dardailler said:  </s>
<s> The connection must be available to the client.  </s>
<s> It could be provided outside the individual XML file in site-wide metadata that says 'In the absense of an explicit indication, you may assume that pages [in this realm] conform at least to DTD="URI".'  </s>
<s> It is quite likely that semantic completeness such as we need will not be the law of the XML land unless we explain it to somebody.  </s>

<s> I've opened the issue in more details with the HTML-CG yesterday (with the intent to discuss it at yesterday evening HTML CG call but that didn't happen as Jon Bosak hadn't had a chance to read it).  </s>
