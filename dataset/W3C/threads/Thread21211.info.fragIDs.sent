When linking to a local stylesheet by 'Style'  'Link'  'Browse', the href is saved as absolute link (with drive letter). 
Even selecting 'File'  'Save as' and there 'tranform URLs' does not seem to change this. 
Refers to v8.0 on Win98SE Christoph 
Thanks for pointing this out. 
The creation of a local link in general is saved as an absolute link on Windows. 
We are working on it.

Hello Christoph, It is now fixed in the source base. 
In fact, this problem appeared when the only common path between the document and the style sheet was the drive letter. 
Thanks Laurent Carcone
