<s> Hey everybody!  </s>
<s> After the wg meetings I was reviewing the notes on pipelining in the connection mgt draft and rfc 2068.  </s>
<s> I have a few questions which relate to proxy server behavior..  </s>
<s> When a client is talking to a proxy server and is pipelining requests, should it use a single pipeline connection to issue requests to different origin servers ?  </s>
<s> ie should GET http://www.ups.com/  </s>
<s> HTTP/1.1 and GET http://www.fedex.com/  </s>
<s> HTTP/1.1 be sent over the same pipeline or should a new connection be established.  </s>
<s> A common occurence of this is when advertisement gifs come from a different server than the html file.  </s>
<s> I guess the question becomes : Can requests in the same pipeline be to different origin servers?  </s>
<s> With the advent of pipelined persistent connections ( and to a lesser extend 1.0 keep alives ), the distinction of 'who the client is talking to' is confusing to me.  </s>
<s> Since while the client may be pipelining to a proxy, and the proxy can go ahead and do an old style connection to an origin server, how does the client deal with old responses?  </s>
<s> Assuming the answer to the previous question, is yes... IE: client pipelines: GET http://www.foo.com/  </s>
<s> HTTP/1.1 GET http://www.bar.com/  </s>
<s> HTTP/1.1 what happens if foo.com is a 1.1 server ( the proxy can do a persistent conenction ) and bar.com is 1.0 (proxy cannot)?  </s>
<s> Also, when the responses come back to the client, the first is a 1.1 response, and the second is a 1.0 response ..  </s>
<s> How should the client or proxy behave ?  </s>

<s> Yes ... but there are some reasons why it may not be advisable from a implementation design perspective.  </s>
<s> Consider the case where request below to foo.com takes forever to discover the DNS name is invalid.  </s>
<s> The response from bar.com must wait and the requesting client has no clue why.  </s>
<s> Should not matter from a functional perspective.  </s>
<s> The 1.1 proxy simply returns the responses to the client in the order requested.  </s>
<s> Since the proxy- client response must conform to http/1.1,  </s>
<s> I would expect it to adjust the 1.0 response headers if needed ... can't imagine what the need would be.  </s>
<s> And of course the connection management headers are hop-hop and as such must be adjusted before the response is forwarded.  </s>
<s> The proxy can contact both servers (and may already have an open persistent connection to the 1.1 server idle after handling another client's request) and the only requirement is that the proxy return the responses in the same order as received.  </s>

<s> I agree that its a difficult implementation to handle, but the case you mention isnt the one I was thinking about.  </s>
<s> What do we do with sticky headers?  </s>
<s> Should each origin server get 1 copy of the sticky headers?  </s>
<s> Should the client have to specify sticky headers for the 1st request to a new origin server in a pipeline?  </s>
<s> Josh Cohen Netscape Communications Corp. Netscape Fire Department "Mighty Morphin' Proxy Ranger" Server Engineering josh@netscape.com http://home.netscape.com/people/josh/  </s>
<s> That would depend on the nature of the proxy.  </s>
<s> A "personal proxy" (which is essentially what a good user agent cache becomes) would probably use multiple request threads (the equivalent of connections).  </s>
<s> A small group proxy would probably maintain a continuous two connections to every client in its domain, and thus whether or not the two are pipelined would depend on the presence of other outstanding requests.  </s>
<s> Likewise, a national proxy would likely maintain feeder connections to reqional proxies.  </s>
<s> In other words, HTTP is capable of doing either, and the best choice will depend on the context in which the proxy is configured.  </s>
<s> A good implementation plan would be to make such decisions configurable by the proxy maintainer.  </s>
<s> The proxy is always sending HTTP/1.1 responses, even if the origin is an HTTP/1.0 server.  </s>
<s> The proxy is capable of "converting" any HTTP/1.0 response into a valid HTTP/1.1 response.  </s>
<s> The only question in such cases is how much conversion should be done.  </s>
<s> Adding "Connection: close" is the simplest, but it is generally more efficient (for the proxy) to do a full conversion (i.e., add chunked encoding if no content-length is present).  </s>
<s> Not if the proxy is 1.1 compliant.  </s>
<s> It would be a very, very bad idea for the proxy to change its HTTP-version based on the origin of the response.  </s>

<s> When a client is talking to a proxy server and is pipelining requests, should it use a single pipeline connection to issue requests to different origin servers ?  </s>
<s> ie should GET http://www.ups.com/  </s>
<s> HTTP/1.1 and GET http://www.fedex.com/  </s>
<s> HTTP/1.1 be sent over the same pipeline or should a new connection be established.  </s>
<s> A common occurence of this is when advertisement gifs come from a different server than the html file.  </s>
<s> I guess the question becomes : Can requests in the same pipeline be to different origin servers?  </s>
<s> In the case where you have an HTML file coming from one server, and an imbedded GIF from another, I think the "use two connections" rule applies.  </s>
<s> I.e., the client has two connections to the proxy, uses the first connection to fetch the HTML file, and the other for the imbedded images.  </s>
<s> Note that this is actually not a particularly hard example; you can't actually start fetching the image until you have at least some of the HTML file (since you don't have the IMG SRC until then).  </s>
<s> A harder question is "what if the HTML file has lots of IMG SRCs, which come from more than one origin server?"  </s>
<s> Then you could get into a situation where you request several different images over one connection, and some might be blocked waiting for earlier ones to complete.  </s>
<s> I think the best answer is that as long as the images are ultimately being used to construct the same layout, then you should stick to using as few connections as possible.  </s>
<s> Ultimately, you can't finish the layout until you have most or all of the images, and so while there might be some minor benefit in trying to get them in "fastest first" order, this probably isn't a big deal.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, if one browser program has two or more independent Web-browser windows open (I often do this, especially when following up on search-engine results), then it might be best to act as if these are separate instances of the application.  </s>
<s> I.e., each window gets its own pair of TCP connections, so that the two windows can be operated without interfering with each other.  </s>
<s> Although the use of lots of parallel connections has taken some criticism (including from me), the real problem is not having lots of TCP connections open per se.  </s>
<s> The two bad things to do are (1) open and close connections frequently, resulting in lots of overhead at the server, and (2) run lots packets simultaneously over parallel connections, which defeats the TCP congestion control algorthms.  </s>
<s> If you get into a situation where you have two proxy connections open, but both of them appear stalled, it might make sense to open another connection *if* you are going to use it to get responses from a different origin server.  </s>
<s> And if you have multiple origin servers to load from at once, it probably pays to distribute the URLs among your TCP connections so that all of the URLs from one server are fetched on one connection.  </s>
<s> I.e., if the servers are A and B, do this: connection 1: A A A A A A connection 2: B B B B B B instead of this connection 1: A B A B A B connection 2: A B A B A B since if server B is slow or dead, the latter approach will cause a lot more trouble.  </s>
<s> It might even cause more TCP opening/closing, if the user gets tired and hits "stop" ... since if a request is in progress when that happens, you pretty much have to close the TCP connection to recover.  </s>
<s> Bottom line: minimize the number of (1) simultaneously active TCP connections and (2) the number of TCP opens and closes.  </s>
<s> But don't make the user wait because you've done things in the wrong order.  </s>
<s> With the advent of pipelined persistent connections ( and to a lesser extend 1.0 keep alives ), the distinction of 'who the client is talking to' is confusing to me.  </s>
<s> Since while the client may be pipelining to a proxy, and the proxy can go ahead and do an old style connection to an origin server, how does the client deal with old responses?  </s>
<s> Assuming the answer to the previous question, is yes... IE: client pipelines: GET http://www.foo.com/  </s>
<s> HTTP/1.1 GET http://www.bar.com/  </s>
<s> HTTP/1.1 what happens if foo.com is a 1.1 server ( the proxy can do a persistent conenction ) and bar.com is 1.0 (proxy cannot)?  </s>
<s> It's important to understand that persistent connections are "hop-by-hop", NOT "end-to-end".  </s>
<s> I.e., what goes on between proxy and client (as far as TCP connections are concerned) is almost entirely unrelated to what goes on between proxy and origin server; at a higher level, the proxy is always just forwarding requests and responses.  </s>
<s> If it has to use a separate TCP connection for each request/response, because its peer speaks HTTP/1.0, so be it.  </s>
<s> The "almost entirely" in that paragraph is because if the user hits "stop", the only way for the user agent to stop a transfer in progress is to close the TCP connection.  </s>
<s> And since we want the proxy to pass this along (e.g., to stop wasting Internet bandwidth that's being used to load a large response from the origin server), then this causes the connection-close to propagate all the way through the chain of proxies.  </s>
<s> Which is sad, but we've always said that TCP connections are not immortal.  </s>

<s> What do we do with sticky headers?  </s>
<s> Should each origin server get 1 copy of the sticky headers?  </s>
<s> Should the client have to specify sticky headers for the 1st request to a new origin server in a pipeline?  </s>
<s> We don't have sticky headers in HTTP/1.1.  </s>
<s> (I think we should, but that's another discussion.) If we did have them, then the rules for multiplexing such requests over a proxy would have to be specified carefully.  </s>
<s> In fact, earlier versions of the hit-metering draft did do something like this, but people talked me out of using anything sticky in the hit-metering design.  </s>
<s> I believe that the solution is not extremely complex, but it wouldn't be a total no-brainer, either.  </s>
<s> Let's worry about this in HTTP/1.2. -Jeff  </s>
