<s> Syntax Proposal: It has been moved that we adopt the following conventions for SWBPD syntax usage.  </s>
<s> 1. In the main content sections of all formal published notes, Turtle/N3 will be used.  </s>
<s> This meets the requirements that the syntax be both human- and machine-readable.  </s>
<s> Exception: In some cases, the subject matter is best communicated using a different syntax (e.g. the RDF/XML Task Force).  </s>
<s> This is deemed acceptable on a case-by-case basis for the main content sections of formal published notes.  </s>
<s> As appropriate, additional syntaxes may be presented in appendices to the notes.  </s>
<s> OPEN QUESTION: ?should  </s>
<s> we make it a requirement that, say all notes at least have RDF/XML in an appendix?  </s>
<s> -or-  </s>
<s> ?should this be entirely up to the author's discression?  </s>
<s> 2.For regular email exchanges, use of Turtle/N3 syntax remains the recommended convention, but is not required to the extent that it causes undue inconvenience.  </s>
<s> For example: ?one's  </s>
<s> favorite tool may not export Turtle/N3.  </s>
<s> ?there are times when one may wish to dash off a quick example and just type it in some ad hoc informal notation.  </s>

<s> -or-  </s>
<s> I believe that a statement of general policy, with extensive discretion, is the best way forward.  </s>
<s> This allows any reviewer who cares to easily challenge author discretion when it goes against the main thrust of the policy.  </s>
<s> Otherwise we need to over-engineer the letter of the policy, rather than gradually come to a shared understanding of the spirit (e.g.  </s>
<s> I think having examples in Turtle and RDF/XML, in-line, like in the OWL Test Cases, fits the spirit, without fitting the letter of Mike's proposal - I don't think this is worth discussing except on a case-by-case basis) Jeremy  </s>
<s> I agree with everything Jeremy said (modulo my poorly worded suggestion).  </s>
<s> The open question was whether to require RDF/XML syntax SOMEWHERE in every formal note, not whether it needs to be in an appendix.  </s>
<s> An appendix is the obvious place to put examples in RDF/XML syntax, if they are not in the main content sections.  </s>
<s> It is a separate matter what conventions to adopt regarding appendices per se.  </s>
<s> For example, one reasonable convention would be to require all coded examples to be either/both in an appendix, online and downloadable.  </s>
<s> This relates to the idea of having a common template/format for notes -- which we have agreed to let various ideas be put forward rather than adopt a normative template/format at this time.  </s>

<s> I would prefer the 'abbreviated' version of Ntriples that was used in the RDF documentation (ie allowing qname forms for URIrefs).  </s>
<s> This is reasonably readable but has the merit that it shows exactly the triples in the graph, and requires one to be explicit about labelling bnodes.  </s>
<s> Notations (like RDF/XML and Turtle) which gather together triples with a common subject distort the logical form and lead to misunderstandings, and in fact seem to me to be less readable than 'flat' notations which exhibit the graph structure more explicitly.  </s>
