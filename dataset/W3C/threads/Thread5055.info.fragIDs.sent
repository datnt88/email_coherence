Syntax Proposal: It has been moved that we adopt the following conventions for SWBPD syntax usage. 
1. In the main content sections of all formal published notes, Turtle/N3 will be used. 
This meets the requirements that the syntax be both human- and machine-readable. 
Exception: In some cases, the subject matter is best communicated using a different syntax (e.g. the RDF/XML Task Force). 
This is deemed acceptable on a case-by-case basis for the main content sections of formal published notes. 
As appropriate, additional syntaxes may be presented in appendices to the notes. 
OPEN QUESTION: ?should 
we make it a requirement that, say all notes at least have RDF/XML in an appendix? 
-or- 
?should this be entirely up to the author's discression? 
2.For regular email exchanges, use of Turtle/N3 syntax remains the recommended convention, but is not required to the extent that it causes undue inconvenience. 
For example: ?one's 
favorite tool may not export Turtle/N3. 
?there are times when one may wish to dash off a quick example and just type it in some ad hoc informal notation. 
?the 
subject matter may be best explained using alternative syntaxes (as above).

I believe that a statement of general policy, with extensive discretion, is the best way forward. 
This allows any reviewer who cares to easily challenge author discretion when it goes against the main thrust of the policy. 
Otherwise we need to over-engineer the letter of the policy, rather than gradually come to a shared understanding of the spirit (e.g. 
I think having examples in Turtle and RDF/XML, in-line, like in the OWL Test Cases, fits the spirit, without fitting the letter of Mike's proposal - I don't think this is worth discussing except on a case-by-case basis) Jeremy 
I agree with everything Jeremy said (modulo my poorly worded suggestion). 
The open question was whether to require RDF/XML syntax SOMEWHERE in every formal note, not whether it needs to be in an appendix. 
An appendix is the obvious place to put examples in RDF/XML syntax, if they are not in the main content sections. 
It is a separate matter what conventions to adopt regarding appendices per se. 
For example, one reasonable convention would be to require all coded examples to be either/both in an appendix, online and downloadable. 
This relates to the idea of having a common template/format for notes -- which we have agreed to let various ideas be put forward rather than adopt a normative template/format at this time.

I would prefer the 'abbreviated' version of Ntriples that was used in the RDF documentation (ie allowing qname forms for URIrefs). 
This is reasonably readable but has the merit that it shows exactly the triples in the graph, and requires one to be explicit about labelling bnodes. 
Notations (like RDF/XML and Turtle) which gather together triples with a common subject distort the logical form and lead to misunderstandings, and in fact seem to me to be less readable than 'flat' notations which exhibit the graph structure more explicitly. 
I therefore vote against this motion.

Turtle is neither, seems to me.
