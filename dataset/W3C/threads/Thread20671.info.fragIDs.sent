If Amaya attempts to PUT to a server, it will send an HTTP/1.0 request with an "Expect: 100-continue" header. 
This is a 1.1 feature, and as the RFC states: As the RFC you referenced states: An origin server [...] MUST NOT send a 100 (Continue) response if such a request comes from an HTTP/1.0 (or earlier) client. 
It seems odd that Amaya is expecting a response that according to the RFC I 
am not allowed to send it. 
In addition, if I do not send the 100 Continue response (as my server does not implement it), Amaya (appropriately) sends the body of the message. 
However, it then crashes (on Win32). 
I would appreciate if these two bugs (sending an inappropriate expect header, and crashing) could be fixed. 
They are serious barriers to PUT compatibility with Amaya. 
If necessary, I can provide a server against which you can test this behavior. 
Please email me directly for the information.

Aaron, 
We need more info. 
Can you post the complete protocol exchange that took place? 
Second question, why are you not using HTTP/1.1? 
:) Have you tried using mod_put in apache or my own (now old) put.c program? 
For every 100-continue, there's a timeout. 
If we don't get the reply, we then send the body. 
This is done as such as we don't know beforehand what's the version of the protocol and it's they way that the HTTP spec precises to do it. 
As for the crash, I can't reproduce it without more information from you.

Amaya is not an origin server, but an HTTP 1/1 client.

This seems to be a perfectly legal exchange, compatible with the RFC, yet Amaya consistently crashes, on three different machines tested. 
I'm using HTTP/1.0 because that's what the server uses, and I don't feel like rewriting the server. 
I can't use mod_put or put.c because I'm trying to write a PUT handler. 
;-) 
I hope the above is clear enough. 
If you need more information I can point you to a server and URL that exhibits this behavior.

[DJW:] According to the evidence provided the question should be why is Amaya not using HTTP/1.1. 
[DJW:] The evidence presented is that it is a HTTP 1.0 client; the PUT in the trace purports to come from Amaya. 
I would say that any HTTP 1.0 client sending Expect: 100-Continue could reasonably expect to either have it ignored or receive a 417 status return. 
I would say that an HTTP 1.0 request with an Expect header was broken.
