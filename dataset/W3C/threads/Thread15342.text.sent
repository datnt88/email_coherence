The Techniques teleconference is scheduled for Wednesday, February 19 from 15:00 to 16:30 UTC (10:00am to 11:30am US Eastern/7:00am to 8:30am US Pacific). 
The conference information is: Passcode 92248 Agenda: 1. Discuss baseline technology to support with techniques 2. Pick up discussion of text equivalents and other techniques 3. Continue discussion of views 4. Discuss agenda for Technical Plenary Note that the teleconference for Wednesday, March 5 is cancelled because of the W3C Technical Plenary. 
We'll have a productive day on March 4 though! 
Michael Michael Cooper Accessibility Project Manager Watchfire 1 Hines Rd Kanata, ON K2K 3C7 Canada I've created a (very) rough draft of the techniques for guideline 3.1 (navigable) and posted it at: This is really just the techniques from the AERT that seem to fit the new 3.1 guideline. 
These techniques are referenced by title but in the final document they would be filled out as in the AERT. 
I've placed the techniques under the 3 categories of minimum, level 2 and level 3 as I thought they fit. 
Before going any further I thought I should see if I'm on the right track. 
What's right or wrong with this document? 
Chris My apologies, I'd like to join this call, but am unavailable between 15:00 and 16:00 GMT Jonathan Chetwynd Chris, Thanks. 
This raises some good questions and issues. 
1. 
We need to figure out how to combine AERT with the current HTML Techniques draft [1]. 
Or will we have two documents? 
Also, keep in mind the relation to ATAG and ATAG Techniques [2]. 
2. How will we handle overlap of techniques? 
For example, you have technique 3.5.1 
"Check document for header nesting" associated with checkpoint 3.1, but these might also be relevant to checkpoint 1.3 "Make all content and structure available independently of presentation." 3. 
I'm curious how you sorted the techniques into Levels. 
There are some WCAG 1.0 priority 1 techniques in Level 2, Minimum Level are primarily WCAG 1.0 priority 2. If this sorting is correct, then people who conform to WCAG 1.0 will be a bit confused when they move to WCAG 2.0. 
(the next two questions are from your document) 4. What is a major section and what is a long document? 
5. Can valid long documents be devoid of paragraphs? 
This might relate to the applicability axis we talked about at last Thursday's telecon.

The techniques document seems more precise than the WCAG2 so it would be easier to base our accessibility checking on it. 
But does the techniques document cover everything that could be related to accessibility? 
A quick look over shows that it covers accessibility issues quite well. 
Yes, there will definitely be overlap. 
If, however, we base our accessibility techniques on the WCAG techniques then we won't have to worry about overlap. 
It seems to me that the WCAG techniques are HTML element oriented like the AERT. 
WCAG The guideline for minimum level deals with titles and paragraphs so I placed all the techniques dealing with titles and paragraphs under it. 
Reviewing my initial sorting has shown up some errors. 
Yes, it could be confusing to people migrating from 1.0 to 2.0 if we're not consistent. 
Perhaps that should be a contributing factor to where we place the techniques. 
The WCAG2 Techniques document talks about "long documents" and "sections" without defining them. 
Hmmm, how precise do we need to be? 
Chris WCAG track. 
Inevitably, authors will have to make those determinations themselves. 
You can't shove a formula down people's throats: "If your document exceeds x kilobytes of text, it is considered a long document." 
Heavens, yes. 
Images, anyone? 
Flash? 
Ever watched a movie trailer? 
I listen to John Peel's BBC Radio 1 show for six hours a week. 
Those are pretty long documents, don't you think? 
And not a p /p element anywhere. 
I appeal to WAI to free itself from its ongoing bias that the only true Web documents are those jammed to the margins with words words words.
