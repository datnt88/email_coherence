<s> And sometimes it is the author and sometimes it is the reviewer/certifier.  </s>
<s> So far, all the active versions I could come up and those I saw from others were either in the wrong form (e.g. imperative instead of declarative) or they seem to be more complicated or ambiguous (or actually say something different than intended) than the passive forms we had.  </s>
<s> We have some people who will be taking a pass at this though - so we will see if we can come up with active sentences that are declarative and that don't change the meaning of the checkpoints.  </s>
<s> As I said, whenever I tried to do this, I always end up with a complicated sentence or a sentence without a subject I can define properly.  </s>
<s> So I wonder if passive, declarative will be the simplest to understand for these types of items.  </s>

<s> Just one more note to add about passive versus active from a localization perspective - it is often much harder to translated passive sentences into other languages than active ones, especially for translation memory machines, which can be "taught" to look for subject-verb-object coming from certain languages in order to do fuzzy-logic matching.  </s>

<s> If the sentences - aren't simple, - aren't declarative - aren't the same intent - don't all say 'the author/editor/web-owner/poster did xxxx" then making them be more complex or inaccurate in order to make them active would not be following our advice.  </s>

<s> Hi folks, Summmary: I think there is a good reason why we should use active instead of passive: Active voice is easier to understand, and in particular to process automatically.  </s>
<s> I think we should note that simple descriptive clauses (of the form subject, verb "to be", adjective or participle) are clear and comprehensible.  </s>
<s> I think more complex passive constructions (for example sentences which include an agent) are generally better as active voice.  </s>
<s> I also think we need to do a lot of work on this, and create per-language techniques for the plain language checkpoint since they are not all transferable across languages.  </s>
<s> details: I am interested in the problem of identifying parts of a sentence to assist with automatic simplification or rendering in an augmented form.  </s>
<s> I don't want to pretend that we can wait for an artificial intelligence algorithm to process language.  </s>
<s> As William Loughborough says it is probably six months away, just like it was when Marvin Minsky worked on the problem in the 1950's.  </s>
<s> But when the language is simple enough there are existing tools we can work with.  </s>
<s> For those who have Microsoft's "Word" there is a grammar checker that can do some useful things, and there are a number of online translation engines such as altavista's babelfish, or google's service for translating pages it found.  </s>
<s> Lisa Seeman has shown a demo that uses RDF to work at the level of vocabulary - we could extend this to understand (very simple) grammatical constructions.  </s>
<s> In particular, active voice "subject, verb, object" is a common pattern, as is "subject, verb to be, description".  </s>
<s> Passive voice is not so easy.  </s>
<s> I have seen several misunderstandings of what is passive voice, so I thought I would try to explain the two.  </s>
<s> (Richard Ishida already did, but his mailer put so much junk into the message I could not read it properly).  </s>
<s> Passive voice is a verb where the action is done to the subject of the clause, often by something.  </s>
<s> (The verb "done" there is the first verb in the passive voice in this email).  </s>
<s> The pattern is that there is a subject, a verb, perhaps an agent (the thing that "does" the verb to the subject, and possible other stuff too.  </s>
<s> Something that seems to confuse people is the pattern of the subject, the verb to be (is, are, will be, was, etc) and an adjective or participle - a description of the subject.  </s>
<s> For example, "I am confused" is technically in the passive voice.  </s>
<s> However it  </s>
<s> is a description of me like "I am tall" which is definitely not in the passive voice.  </s>
<s> The confusion comes about because english uses a similar pattern to make passive voice.  </s>
<s> I suggest that we do not discourage this simple form, whether it is a passive construction or a simple description.  </s>
<s> "I am confused by the passive voice" is the third time I have used the passive voice in this email.  </s>
<s> It has the pattern subject - "me", a verb - "confuse", and an agent - "the passive voice" - the thing which did the confusing.  </s>
<s> For most verbs in english (and many modern european languages) the passive voice is made by combining the past participle (often "something-ed") with the verb to be.  </s>
<s> (That was the fourth example: subject is the passive voice, verb is to make, agent is the whole description of how to make it).  </s>
<s> For example, The example I have used here is the verb "to confuse" - the passive of "to confuse" is "to be confused".  </s>
<s> Combining the present participle (the "-ing" form) with the verb to be is not a passive voice, even technically.  </s>
<s> For example "it is raining" is in the active voice.  </s>
<s> The subject is "it", and the verb is "is raining".  </s>
<s> This is equivalent in english to "it rains" - an active form.  </s>
<s> The subject here is an "impersonal" a proper grammar form for statements where you don't identify exactly who or what is the subject.  </s>
<s> There are more complex examples.  </s>
<s> Think of the statement "they should increase the chocolate ration" - it doesn't matter who "they" really are.  </s>
<s> In the passive voice this would be "the chocolate ration should be increased".  </s>
<s> This (example 5) is a simple example - a subject, a simple verb description, no agent.  </s>
<s> Indeed, it is a clear way to express the impersonal.  </s>
<s> It doesn't confuse people with difficulties like semantic pragmatic disorder because they don't wonder who the impersonal "they" (who should increase the chocolate ration) are.  </s>
<s> So what are my conclusions?  </s>
<s> As I said above, I think we should not be advising against simple "subject, verb to be, description" constructions.  </s>
<s> These are relatively easy to deal with automatically.  </s>
<s> I think that adding an agent complicates the sentence.  </s>
<s> I think there is clearly a lot of work to do here, and we need to enlist the help of people who are experts in the area.  </s>
<s> Working with people who are both skilled writers and and skilled in "plain language" (in the sense of language that is very easy to understand even for people with intellectual impairments) would give us some powerful examples, and improve the guidelines generally.  </s>
<s> I know that the rules for language change according to the language (for example latin doesn't have the confusion of english because it has an unambiguous form of the passive) so we should accept that we may be unable to create techniques that apply to all languages, and sek out people who speak languages or language groups that are not present in the current group.  </s>

<s> details: I am interested in the problem of identifying parts of a sentence to assist with automatic simplification or rendering in an augmented form.  </s>
<s> I don't want to pretend that we can wait for an artificial intelligence algorithm to process language.  </s>
<s> As William Loughborough says it is probably six months away, just like it was when Marvin Minsky worked on the problem in the 1950's.  </s>
<s> But when the language is simple enough there are existing tools we can work with.  </s>
<s> For those who have Microsoft's "Word" there is a grammar checker that can do some useful things, and there are a number of online translation engines such as altavista's babelfish, or google's service for translating pages it found.  </s>
<s> Lisa Seeman has shown a demo that uses RDF to work at the level of vocabulary - we could extend this to understand (very simple) grammatical constructions.  </s>
<s> In particular, active voice "subject, verb, object" is a common pattern, as is "subject, verb to be, description".  </s>
<s> Passive voice is not so easy.  </s>
<s> I have seen several misunderstandings of what is passive voice, so I thought I would try to explain the two.  </s>
<s> (Richard Ishida already did, but his mailer put so much junk into the message I could not read it properly).  </s>
<s> Passive voice is a verb where the action is done to the subject of the clause, often by something.  </s>
<s> (The verb "done" there is the first verb in the passive voice in this email).  </s>
<s> The pattern is that there is a subject, a verb, perhaps an agent (the thing that "does" the verb to the subject, and possible other stuff too.  </s>
<s> Something that seems to confuse people is the pattern of the subject, the verb to be (is, are, will be, was, etc) and an adjective or participle - a description of the subject.  </s>
<s> For example, "I am confused" is technically in the passive voice.  </s>
<s> However it  </s>
<s> is a description of me like "I am tall" which is definitely not in the passive voice.  </s>
<s> The confusion comes about because english uses a similar pattern to make passive voice.  </s>
<s> I suggest that we do not discourage this simple form, whether it is a passive construction or a simple description.  </s>
<s> "I am confused by the passive voice" is the third time I have used the passive voice in this email.  </s>
<s> It has the pattern subject - "me", a verb - "confuse", and an agent - "the passive voice" - the thing which did the confusing.  </s>
<s> For most verbs in english (and many modern european languages) the passive voice is made by combining the past participle (often "something-ed") with the verb to be.  </s>
<s> (That was the fourth example: subject is the passive voice, verb is to make, agent is the whole description of how to make it).  </s>
<s> For example, The example I have used here is the verb "to confuse" - the passive of "to confuse" is "to be confused".  </s>
<s> Combining the present participle (the "-ing" form) with the verb to be is not a passive voice, even technically.  </s>
<s> For example "it is raining" is in the active voice.  </s>
<s> The subject is "it", and the verb is "is raining".  </s>
<s> This is equivalent in english to "it rains" - an active form.  </s>
<s> The subject here is an "impersonal" a proper grammar form for statements where you don't identify exactly who or what is the subject.  </s>
<s> There are more complex examples.  </s>
<s> Think of the statement "they should increase the chocolate ration" - it doesn't matter who "they" really are.  </s>
<s> In the passive voice this would be "the chocolate ration should be increased".  </s>
<s> This (example 5) is a simple example - a subject, a simple verb description, no agent.  </s>
<s> Indeed, it is a clear way to express the impersonal.  </s>
<s> It doesn't confuse people with difficulties like semantic pragmatic disorder because they don't wonder who the impersonal "they" (who should increase the chocolate ration) are.  </s>
<s> So what are my conclusions?  </s>
<s> As I said above, I think we should not be advising against simple "subject, verb to be, description" constructions.  </s>
<s> These are relatively easy to deal with automatically.  </s>
<s> I think that adding an agent complicates the sentence.  </s>
<s> I think there is clearly a lot of work to do here, and we need to enlist the help of people who are experts in the area.  </s>
<s> Working with people who are both skilled writers and and skilled in "plain language" (in the sense of language that is very easy to understand even for people with intellectual impairments) would give us some powerful examples, and improve the guidelines generally.  </s>
<s> I know that the rules for language change according to the language (for example latin doesn't have the confusion of english because it has an unambiguous form of the passive) so we should accept that we may be unable to create techniques that apply to all languages, and sek out people who speak languages or language groups that are not present in the current group.  </s>
<s> Getting help from the i18n activity would be a start.  </s>

<s> Thanks for pointing out the "AND CONTEXTS" qualification to the Guideline 3.3 best practices suggestion to use "Active Voice".  </s>
<s> That gets WCAG off the hook for using passive voice in the guidelines.  </s>
<s> All guidelines are presently in the PASSIVE voice except for one: 2 E-1 User can avoid experiencing screen flicker.  </s>
<s> I think that we should try to make it grammatically consistent with the other guidelines if we can do it in a graceful way.  </s>
<s> For those who are wondering about active vs. passive voice there is a great article on it on the University of Wisconsin website.  </s>
<s> It also talks about the imperative voice.  </s>
<s> Here is an excerpt: How to Recognize Active and Passive Sentences 1. Identify the subject of the sentence.  </s>
<s> 2. Identify the action that the sentence identifies.  </s>
<s> 3. Examine the relationship between the subject and verb.  </s>
<s> 4. Does the subject perform the action of the verb?  </s>
<s> (If so, the sentence is active.) 5. Does the subject sit there while something else -- named or unnamed -- performs an action on it?  </s>
<s> (If so, the sentence is passive.) 6. Can't tell?  </s>
<s> If the main verb is a linking verb ("is," "was," "are," "seems," etc.), then the verb functions like an equals sign; there is no action (either active or passive) involved -- it merely describes a state of being.  </s>
<s> By the way, according to this definition the phrase "It is raining outside" is neither active nor passive.  </s>
<s> It is merely a state of being.  </s>

<s> Idle thoughts ahead ... It's a mantra in the clear-communications field: "keep sentences active."  </s>
<s> Heaven knows there are too many needlessly (or purposely) passive sentences out there.  </s>
<s> And this can be a problem especially for non-native speakers (my audience as an editor).  </s>
<s> OK, together now, BUT ... take a sentence like "it is raining outside."  </s>
<s> Do you really want to say "rain falls outside" just for the sake of consistency?  </s>
<s> For dramatic effect, maybe.  </s>
<s> I'm with those who believe that if most other sentences are active -- certainly the ones where clarity is key -- then say "it is raining."  </s>
<s> Readers are less likely to stop and say "huh?" Avi  </s>
<s> I don't know if I can help you.  </s>
<s> Confused is a past participle - a form of a verb that works like an adjective.  </s>
<s> So "I am confused" is a standard passive construction.  </s>
<s> The verb to be is intransitive (it doesn't happen to anything, the subject just does it).  </s>
<s> So when used with an adjective it is active.  </s>
<s> But it is also used as an auxiliary verb - in "I am confused" the verb part of the sentence is "am confused".  </s>
<s> (In latin you can say "audio, video, amo" - I hear, I see, I love - and "audior videor amor" - I am heard, I am seen, I am loved - but in at least half a dozen modern european languages you need two or more parts to make the statement, and one of them is often the verb to be).  </s>
<s> Because this construction works the same way as the verb to be with an adjective, I think it is OK to use this simple construction in general (compared to using complex passive sentences).  </s>
<s> I think the guidelines should be in the active voice, in the imperative mood, but I think that is the sort of thing a technial editor should suggest towards the end of the drafting process.  </s>
<s> If we want the drafts to conform to WCAG 1 to the highest degree possible, of course, we should aim to keep the language simple.  </s>
<s> Mostly I wanted to clear up some misunderstandings I had seen about what is passive or active.  </s>
