I am looking for advice as to which software to write html would be the best for a blind student using windows95 and a screen reader to use. 
I want to teach html to some blind students, not college just high school. 
Any suggestions? 
Or should I make them do it in a text editor? 
Norman Though you did limit yourself to win95, I'd like to point others on this list at Emacs-- there are some excellent tools for producing valid HTML --especially html-helper-mode Best Regards, --raman as representative of my employer, Adobe Systems Inc. well, depends. 
I think the rudiments of html are best understood by using a text editor. 
I think also that once the rudiments are learned, it is easier to learn how to use a tool like: frontpage or netscape composer which I personally like. 
hope this helps.

I have used Emacs on Windows 95. 
It didn't seem to be any different than the X11 version. 
I don't know how it would work with a screen reader, though. 
That may be a challenge. 
I don't believe there is a version of EmacSpeak for Windows. 
Also, Emacs is free. 
That would be a plus for highschool students.

Dear prof Coombs From my point of view: go for HoTMetaL Pro 4. from SoftQuad (http://www.softquad.com/products/pc-hmp4.htm) 
you can download a trial version for some 60 days I believe it is by far the best html editor I am aware of HoTMetal comes now with some interfaces to softbraille etc. so it became very accessible as a product HoTMetaL PRO 4.0 is a validating editor, that enables the generation of high quality HTML. 
Using the 'Check HTML' command one can verify that the markup in a document is correct and complete. 
Furthermore, HoTMetaL PRO has implemented a 'Check Accessibility' command which checks documents against a set of accessibility guidelines.

While I'm not the biggest fan of FrontPage, it really does make adjusting your code to meet accessibility standards a LOT easier than other editors do. 
I use Bobby to check my FrontPage sites without many problems at all. 
The only problems that I've had in that respect was applying what Bobby told me to do with some Java applets that I was using, but I expected to have problems with those pesky scripts anyway. 
Basically, I think that FrontPage 98 is the lesser of the evils, so to speak...but I'm sure that there are a ton of people who would argue with me... :-) Kristine Bradow Wayne State University Enabling Technologies Laboratory Detroit, MI 48202 Though there are of course quirks I recommend Front Page 98. 
It allows you to change the code to things (like HTML 4.0) that HoTMetaL Pro won't stand for. 
Yes but when it comes to Acessibility, how many times do you have to go through and edit a site done in Frontpage 98 before it follows accessibility guidelines or Web standards? 
Bobby for use with editors not containing such a rule checking set. 
How accurate is Bobby when it comes to checking for Web Accessibility?

NAW is the North American "chapter" of the World Organization of Webmasters Not trying to flame but I disagree with using HoTMetaL Pro 4. I think it is awful. 
It pretty much forces you to write to HTML 3.2 and the "WYSIWYG" editor is pretty far off from what actually shows up in any browser. 
Though there are of course quirks I recommend Front Page 98. 
It allows you to change the code to things (like HTML 4.0) that HoTMetaL Pro won't stand for. 
Additionally, one can use the insert HTML feature to insert anything that Front Page wouldn't normally allow. 
I've found this only necessary to insert alt attributes to links in client side image maps. 
Though HoTMetaL Pro has the accessibility checker built in there is always Bobby for use with editors not containing such a rule checking set.

NAW is the North American "chapter" of the World Organization of Webmasters All those lovely things you say about Hot Metal Pro 4 are relatively true, but my experience with it was that it was very difficult to use with a speech synthesizer, and I deleted it from my system before the trial period ended. 
I use a combination of HTMLPRO3 (I think they are up to about 5 now) and DreamWeaver finding the former the very simplest to use with speech access.
