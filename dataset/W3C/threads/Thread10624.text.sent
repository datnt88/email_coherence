I've updated the N-Triples section of the test cases editor's draft for changes after the last call version. 
The only significant thing was removing language from typed literals. 
I also did some editorial changes and hope that the mapping of N-Triples to RDF concepts is useful and the new way of explaining the N-Triples escapes is clearer. 
The details of the changes are as usual in the changes section: Dave There's still a test:NegativeEntailmentTest. 
which I think should now become a test:PositiveEntailmentTest.

The details of the changes are as usual in the changes section: Dave On Thu, 26 Jun 2003 23:25:23 +0200 I wasn't looking at test cases themselves - that's why the subject was just about the N-Triples part of the specification :) Dave Yes, that's correct, assuming our decisions on XMLLiteral stick. 
I can make the change now or postpone it. 
If the latter, it ought to be tracked as (post-)LC comment.
