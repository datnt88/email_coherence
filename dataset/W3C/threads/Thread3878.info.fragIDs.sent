Dear XSLT WG, First of all I really appreciate all the hard work put into the XSLT 2.0 and related specs. 
The new grouping facilities look wonderful, and the result tree fragment is a particularly good riddance. 
I apologize in advance for the whining to come... 
I have one, rather big, problem with the spec in its current form: I don't understand it. 
Suddenly, to understand XSLT, I have to understand the XML Schema spec (and I'm, regretfully, having a hard time already at modified PSVI as defined by the XQuery/XPath data model, the XQuery formal semantics, the multitude of language about types in the XPath specs themselves, and what have you. 
And I don't, quite frankly. 
That leaves me with little hope of understanding what an arbitrary XSLT 2.0 style sheet actually does - and this bothers me. 
It may be that I'm unusually slow, or that there will appear some article any day now that will make all the intricacies of the type system clear to slow people like me, but I'm still worried. 
To me, it seems that the step from XSLT 1 to XSLT 2 is way bigger than, say, from K&amp;R C to the latest C++ standard. 
And that's a rather big step. 
So: Most of all, I would like to see XSLT 2 minus the type system. 
Seeing that this may be unrealistic, I would very much like to see a named conformance level for XSLT/XPath 2 that doesn't involve the type system (in other words: something like XSLT 2 + XPath 1, essentially). 
I would also like a way to tell the XSLT processor to use ONLY that level, say by means of xsl:version="2.0-light" 
or somesuch. 
Barring that, an XSLT 1.1 consisting of XSLT 1.0 + grouping + multiple output documents - result tree fragments would be more than great for my concerns. 
Again, thank you for your good work, and for your time, /dan Dan Holmsand dan@eyebee.com 
Thanks for the comments. 
You're not alone in finding XML Schema Part 1 difficult to digest. 
Clearly in writing specs it's not our job to produce a tutorial, but we can certainly bear your comments in mind. 
In particular, I think we probably need to be clearer about how processing happens in the absence of a schema: at the moment we rather rely on people knowing that this is just a special case of the PSVI, and the specs concentrate on describing the general case which is of course much more complex. 
I think some features of the XPath 2.0 type system are things you are just going to have to live with. 
The introduction of sequences, I think, brings many benefits. 
The expansion from the three scalar types (boolean, double, and string) of XPath 1.0 to the 19 primitive types of XML Schema is a larger expansion than many of us would have liked, but many of the primitive types will hardly ever be used so you will be able to ignore them most of the time. 
Complex types arise only when using schemas, and again I hope we can ensure that when you don't use a schema, you don't really need to be aware of them. 
There will probably be a conformance level in XSLT 2.0 that doesn't require schema support; defining conformance levels is something we have not yet tackled.

Thanks for the prompt reply! 
I (of course) agree that the spec should not be a tutorial. 
On the other hand, it is quite handy to be able to tell people to consult the spec when they've made a mistake. 
You can do that with XSLT/XPath 1 (and, when the time comes, with the XSLT part of the new 
spec). 
But you can't very well tell people to go have a look at e.g. www.w3.org/TR/query-semantics before they ask any more stupid questions. 
Can you? 
This is where we don't agree. 
I have never really bought the "you don't have to pay for what you don't use" argument when it comes to C++ (another incredibly complex language): before you know it, you have to understand or maintain other people's code. 
If they use the complexities you've decided to do without, you have to pay anyway. 
I fear the same will apply to XPath 2. 
That's really good to hear! 
I just hope that the conformance level isn't just provided for the benefit of lazy implementors, but for lazy users as well (and by lazy I mean those who can't/don't want to learn everything about XML Schema and its data types). 
For example: A "disable-schema='true'", or "version='2.0-light'", 
instruction in XSLT would tell me that this is an XSLT stylesheet that I can understand, and it is a requirement that I can communicate to others.

I agree. 
This is why we are trying to write the main XPath 2.0 specification as a complete and free-standing description of the language, that relies on the formal semantics only for exceptionally complex situations, for example some of the type subsumption rules. 
The formal semantics document is written for implementors, not for users.
