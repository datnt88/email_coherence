<s> 14 Yergeau Expires August 18, 2003 [Page 2] Internet-Draft UTF-8 February 2003 1. Introduction ISO/IEC 10646 [ISO.10646] defines a large character set called the Universal Character Set (UCS), which encompasses most of the world's writing systems.  </s>
<s> The same set of characters is defined by the Unicode standard [UNICODE], which further defines additional character properties and other application details of great interest to  </s>
<s> implementers.  </s>
<s> Up to the present time, changes in Unicode and amendments and additions to ISO/IEC 10646 have tracked each other, so that the character repertoires and code point assignments have remained in sync.  </s>
<s> The relevant standardization committees have  </s>
<s> committed to maintain this very useful synchronism.  </s>
<s> ISO/IEC 10646 and Unicode define several encoding forms of their common repertoire: UTF-8, UCS-2, UTF-16, UCS-4 and UTF-32.  </s>
<s> In an encoding form, each character is represented as one or more encoding units.  </s>
<s> All standard UCS encoding forms except UTF-8 have an encoding unit larger than one octet, making them hard to use in many current applications and protocols that assume 8 or even 7 bit characters.  </s>
<s> UTF-8, the object of this memo, has a one-octet encoding unit.  </s>
<s> It uses all bits of an octet, but has the quality of preserving the full US-ASCII [US-ASCII] range: US-ASCII characters are encoded in one octet having the normal US-ASCII value, and any octet with such a value can only stand for a US-ASCII character, and nothing else.  </s>
<s> UTF-8 encodes UCS characters as a varying number of octets, where the number of octets, and the value of each, depend on the integer value  </s>
<s> assigned to the character in ISO/IEC 10646 (the character number,  </s>
<s> a.k.a. code point or Unicode scalar value).  </s>
<s> This encoding form has the following characteristics (all values are in hexadecimal): o Character numbers from U+0000 to U+007F (US-ASCII repertoire) correspond to octets 00 to 7F (7 bit US-ASCII values).  </s>
<s> A direct consequence is that a plain ASCII string is also a valid UTF-8 string.  </s>
<s> o US-ASCII octet values do not appear otherwise in a UTF-8 encoded character stream.  </s>
<s> This provides compatibility with file systems or other software (e.g. the printf() function in C libraries) that parse based on US-ASCII values but are transparent to other values.  </s>
<s> o Round-trip conversion is easy between UTF-8 and other encoding forms.  </s>
<s> o The first octet of a multi-octet sequence indicates the number of octets in the sequence.  </s>
<s> Yergeau Expires August 18, 2003 [Page 3] Internet-Draft UTF-8 February 2003  </s>
<s> o The octet values C0, C1, FE and FF never appear.  </s>
<s> If the range of character numbers is restricted to U+0000..U+10FFFF (the UTF-16 accessible range), then the octet values F5..FD also never appear.  </s>
<s> o Character boundaries are easily found from anywhere in an octet stream.  </s>
<s> o The lexicographic sorting order of UTF-8 strings is the same as if  </s>
<s> ordered by character numbers.  </s>
<s> Of course this is of limited  </s>
<s> interest since a sort order based on character numbers is not culturally valid.  </s>
<s> o The Boyer-Moore fast search algorithm can be used with UTF-8 data.  </s>
<s> o UTF-8 strings can be fairly reliably recognized as such by a simple algorithm, i.e. the probability that a string of characters in any other encoding appears as valid UTF-8 is low, diminishing with increasing string length.  </s>
<s> UTF-8 was originally a project of the X/Open Joint Internationalization Group XOJIG with the objective to specify a File System Safe UCS Transformation Format [FSS_UTF] that is compatible with UNIX systems, supporting multilingual text in a single encoding.  </s>
<s> The original authors were Gary Miller, Greger Leijonhufvud and John Entenmann.  </s>
<s> Later, Ken Thompson and Rob Pike did significant work for the formal definition of UTF-8.  </s>
<s> 2. Notational conventions The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].  </s>
<s> UCS characters are designated by the U+HHHH notation, where HHHH is a string of from 4 to 6 hexadecimal digits representing the character number in ISO/IEC 10646.  </s>
<s> 3. UTF-8 definition UTF-8 is defined by the Unicode Standard [UNICODE].  </s>
<s> Descriptions and  </s>
<s> formulae can also be found in Annex D of ISO/IEC 10646-1 [ISO.10646]  </s>
<s> In UTF-8, characters from the U+0000..U+10FFFF range (the UTF-16 accessible range) are encoded using sequences of 1 to 4 octets.  </s>
<s> The only octet of a "sequence" of one has the higher-order bit set to 0, the remaining 7 bits being used to encode the character number.  </s>
<s> In a sequence of n octets, n 1, the initial octet has the n higher-order bits set to 1, followed by a bit set to 0. The remaining bit(s) of Yergeau Expires August 18, 2003 [Page 4] Internet-Draft UTF-8 February 2003 that octet contain bits from the number of the character to be encoded.  </s>
<s> The following octet(s) all have the higher-order bit set to 1 and the following bit set to 0, leaving 6 bits in each to contain bits from the character to be encoded.  </s>
<s> The table below summarizes the format of these different octet types.  </s>
<s> The letter x indicates bits available for encoding bits of the character number.  </s>
<s> Char.  </s>
<s> number range | UTF-8 octet sequence (hexadecimal) | (binary) 0000 0000-0000 007F | 0xxxxxxx 0000 0080-0000 07FF | 110xxxxx 10xxxxxx 0000 0800-0000 FFFF | 1110xxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 0001 0000-0010 FFFF | 11110xxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx  </s>
<s> Encoding a character to UTF-8 proceeds as follows:  </s>
<s> 1. Determine the number of octets required from the character number and the first column of the table above.  </s>
<s> It is important to note that the rows of the table are mutually exclusive, i.e. there is only one valid way to encode a given character.  </s>
<s> 2. Prepare the high-order bits of the octets as per the second column of the table.  </s>
<s> 3. Fill in the bits marked x from the bits of the character number, expressed in binary.  </s>
<s> Start by putting the lowest-order bit of the character number in the lowest-order position of the last octet of the sequence, then put the next higher-order bit of the character number in the next higher-order position of that octet, etc.  </s>
<s> When the x bits of the last octet are filled in, move on to the next to last octet, then to the preceding one, etc. until all x bits are filled in.  </s>
<s> The definition of UTF-8 prohibits encoding character numbers between U+D800 and U+DFFF, which are reserved for use with the UTF-16  </s>
<s> encoding form (as surrogate pairs) and do not directly represent characters.  </s>
<s> When encoding in UTF-8 from UTF-16 data, it is necessary  </s>
<s> to first decode the UTF-16 data to obtain character numbers, which are then encoded in UTF-8 as described above.  </s>
<s> This contrasts with CESU-8 [CESU-8], which is a UTF-8-like encoding that is not meant for use on the Internet.  </s>
<s> CESU-8 operates similarly to UTF-8 but encodes the UTF-16 code values (16-bit quantities) instead of the character number (code point).  </s>
<s> This leads to different results for character numbers above 0xFFFF; the CESU-8 encoding of those characters is NOT valid UTF-8.  </s>
<s> Yergeau Expires August 18, 2003 [Page 5] Internet-Draft UTF-8 February 2003  </s>
<s> Decoding a UTF-8 character proceeds as follows:  </s>
<s> 1. Initialize a binary number with all bits set to 0. Up to 21 bits may be needed.  </s>
<s> 2. Determine which bits encode the character number from the number of octets in the sequence and the second column of the table above (the bits marked x). 3. Distribute the bits from the sequence to the binary number, first the lower-order bits from the last octet of the sequence and proceeding to the left until no x bits are left.  </s>
<s> The binary number is now equal to the character number.  </s>
<s> Implementations of the decoding algorithm above MUST protect against decoding invalid sequences.  </s>
<s> For instance, a naive implementation may decode the overlong UTF-8 sequence C0 80 into the character U+0000, or the surrogate pair ED A1 8C ED BE B4 into U+233B4.  </s>
<s> Decoding invalid sequences may have security consequences or cause other problems.  </s>
<s> See Security Considerations (Section 10) below.  </s>
<s> 4. Syntax of UTF-8 Byte Sequences A UTF-8 string is a sequence of octets representing a sequence of UCS characters.  </s>
<s> An octet sequence is valid UTF-8 only if it matches the following syntax, which is derived from the rules for encoding UTF-8 and is expressed in the ABNF of [RFC2234].  </s>
<s> UTF8-octets = *( UTF8-char ) UTF8-char = UTF8-1 / UTF8-2 / UTF8-3 / UTF8-4  </s>
<s> UTF8-1 = %x00-7F UTF8-2 = %xC2-DF UTF8-tail UTF8-3 = %xE0 %xA0-BF UTF8-tail / %xE1-EC 2( UTF8-tail ) / %xED %x80-9F UTF8-tail / %xEE-EF 2( UTF8-tail ) UTF8-4 = %xF0 %x90-BF 2( UTF8-tail ) / %xF1-F3 3( UTF8-tail ) / %xF4 %x80-8F 2( UTF8-tail ) UTF8-tail = %x80-BF 5. Versions of the standards ISO/IEC 10646 is updated from time to time by publication of amendments and additional parts; similarly, new versions of the  </s>
<s> Unicode standard are published over time.  </s>
<s> Each new version obsoletes and replaces the previous one, but implementations, and more significantly data, are not updated instantly.  </s>
<s> In general, the changes amount to adding new characters, which does not pose particular problems with old data.  </s>
<s> In 1996, Amendment 5 to Yergeau Expires August 18, 2003 [Page 6] Internet-Draft UTF-8 February 2003 the 1993 edition of ISO/IEC 10646 and Unicode 2.0 moved and expanded the Korean Hangul block, thereby making any previous data containing Hangul characters invalid under the new version.  </s>
<s> Unicode 2.0 has the same difference from Unicode 1.1.  </s>
<s> The justification for allowing such an incompatible change was that there were no major implementations and no significant amounts of data containing Hangul.  </s>
<s> The incident has been dubbed the "Korean mess", and the relevant committees have pledged to never, ever again make such an incompatible change (see Unicode Consortium Policies [1]).  </s>
<s> New versions, and in particular any incompatible changes, have consequences regarding MIME charset labels, to be discussed in MIME registration (Section 8). 6. Byte order mark (BOM) The UCS character U+FEFF "ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE" is also known informally as "BYTE ORDER MARK" (abbreviated "BOM").  </s>
<s> This character  </s>
<s> can be used as a genuine "ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE" within text, but  </s>
<s> the BOM name hints at a second possible usage of the character: to prepend a U+FEFF character to a stream of UCS characters as a "signature".  </s>
<s> A receiver of such a serialized stream may then use the  </s>
<s> initial character as a hint that the stream consists of UCS  </s>
<s> characters and also to recognize which UCS encoding is involved and, with encodings having a multi-octet encoding unit, as a way to recognize the serialization order of the octets.  </s>
<s> UTF-8 having a single-octet encoding unit, this last function is useless and the BOM will always appear as the octet sequence EF BB BF.  </s>
<s> It is important to understand that the character U+FEFF appearing at any position other than the beginning of a stream MUST be interpreted with the semantics for the zero-width non-breaking space, and MUST NOT be interpreted as a signature.  </s>
<s> When interpreted as a signature, the Unicode standard suggests than an initial U+FEFF character may be stripped before processing the text.  </s>
<s> Such stripping is necessary in some cases (e.g. when concatenating two strings, because otherwise the resulting string may contain an unintended "ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK  </s>
<s> SPACE" at the connection point), but might affect an external process at a different layer (such as a digital signature or a count of the characters) that is relying on the presence of all characters in the stream.  </s>
<s> It is therefore RECOMMENDED to avoid stripping an initial U+FEFF interpreted as a signature without a good reason, to ignore it instead of stripping it when appropriate (such as for display) and to strip it only when really necessary.  </s>
<s> U+FEFF in the first position of a stream MAY be interpreted as a zero-width non-breaking space, and is not always a signature.  </s>
<s> In an attempt at diminishing this uncertainty, Unicode 3.2 adds a new Yergeau Expires August 18, 2003 [Page 7] Internet-Draft UTF-8 February 2003 character, U+2060 "WORD JOINER", with exactly the same semantics and usage as U+FEFF except for the signature function, and strongly recommends its exclusive use for expressing word-joining semantics.  </s>
<s> Eventually, following this recommendation will make it all but  </s>
<s> certain that any initial U+FEFF is a signature, not an intended "ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE".  </s>
<s> In the meantime, the uncertainty unfortunately remains and may affect Internet protocols.  </s>
<s> Protocol specifications MAY restrict usage of U+FEFF as a signature in order to reduce or eliminate the potential ill effects of this uncertainty.  </s>
<s> In the interest of striking a balance between the advantages (reduction of uncertainty) and drawbacks (loss of the signature function) of such restrictions, it is useful to distinguish a few cases: o A protocol SHOULD forbid use of U+FEFF as a signature for those textual protocol elements that the protocol mandates to be always UTF-8, the signature function being totally useless in those cases.  </s>
<s> o A protocol SHOULD also forbid use of U+FEFF as a signature for those textual protocol elements for which the protocol provides character encoding identification mechanisms, when it is expected that implementations of the protocol will be in a position to always use the mechanisms properly.  </s>
<s> This will be the case when the protocol elements are maintained tightly under the control of the implementation from the time of their creation to the time of their (properly labeled) transmission.  </s>
<s> o A protocol SHOULD NOT forbid use of U+FEFF as a signature for those textual protocol elements for which the protocol does not provide character encoding identification mechanisms, when a ban would be unenforceable, or when it is expected that implementations of the protocol will not be in a position to always use the mechanisms properly.  </s>
<s> The latter two cases are likely to occur with larger protocol elements such as MIME entities, especially when implementations of the protocol will obtain such entities from file systems, from protocols that do not have encoding identification mechanisms for payloads (such as FTP) or from other protocols that do not guarantee proper identification of character encoding (such as HTTP).  </s>
<s> When a protocol forbids use of U+FEFF as a signature for a certain protocol element, then any initial U+FEFF in that protocol element MUST be interpreted as a "ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE".  </s>
<s> When a protocol does NOT forbid use of U+FEFF as a signature for a certain protocol element, then implementations SHOULD be prepared to handle a signature in that element and react appropriately: using the Yergeau Expires August 18, 2003 [Page 8] Internet-Draft UTF-8 February 2003 signature to identify the character encoding as necessary and stripping or ignoring the signature as appropriate.  </s>
<s> 7. Examples The character sequence U+0041 U+2262 U+0391 U+002E "A NOT IDENTICAL TO ALPHA ." is encoded in UTF-8 as follows: 41 E2 89 A2 CE 91 2E The character sequence U+D55C U+AD6D U+C5B4 (Korean "hangugeo", meaning "the Korean language") is encoded in UTF-8 as follows: ED 95 9C EA B5 AD EC 96 B4 The character sequence U+65E5 U+672C U+8A9E (Japanese "nihongo", meaning "the Japanese language") is encoded in UTF-8 as follows: E6 97 A5 E6 9C AC E8 AA 9E The character U+233B4 (a Chinese character meaning 'stump of tree'), prepended with a UTF-8 BOM, is encoded in UTF-8 as follows: EF BB BF F0 A3 8E B4 8. MIME registration This memo serves as the basis for registration of the MIME charset parameter for UTF-8, according to [RFC2978].  </s>
<s> The charset parameter value is "UTF-8".  </s>
<s> This string labels media types containing text consisting of characters from the repertoire of ISO/IEC 10646 including all amendments at least up to amendment 5 of the 1993 edition (Korean block), encoded to a sequence of octets using the encoding scheme outlined above.  </s>
<s> UTF-8 is suitable for use in MIME content types under the "text" top-level type.  </s>
<s> It is noteworthy that the label "UTF-8" does not contain a version identification, referring generically to ISO/IEC 10646.  </s>
<s> This is intentional, the rationale being as follows: Yergeau Expires August 18, 2003 [Page 9] Internet-Draft UTF-8 February 2003 A MIME charset label is designed to give just the information needed to interpret a sequence of bytes received on the wire into a sequence of characters, nothing more (see [RFC2045], section 2.2).  </s>
<s> As long as a character set standard does not change incompatibly, version numbers serve no purpose, because one gains nothing by learning from the tag that newly assigned characters may be received that one doesn't know about.  </s>
<s> The tag itself doesn't teach anything about the new characters, which are going to be received anyway.  </s>
<s> Hence, as long as the standards evolve compatibly, the apparent advantage of having labels that identify the versions is only that, apparent.  </s>
<s> But there is a disadvantage to such version-dependent labels: when an older application receives data accompanied by a newer, unknown label, it may fail to recognize the label and be completely unable to deal with the data, whereas a generic, known label would have triggered mostly correct processing of the data, which may well not contain any new characters.  </s>
<s> Now the "Korean mess" (ISO/IEC 10646 amendment 5) is an incompatible change, in principle contradicting the appropriateness of a version independent MIME charset label as described above.  </s>
<s> But the compatibility problem can only appear with data containing Korean Hangul characters encoded according to Unicode 1.1 (or equivalently ISO/IEC 10646 before amendment 5), and there is arguably no such data to worry about, this being the very reason the incompatible change was deemed acceptable.  </s>
<s> In practice, then, a version-independent label is warranted, provided the label is understood to refer to all versions after Amendment 5, and provided no incompatible change actually occurs.  </s>
<s> Should incompatible changes occur in a later version of ISO/IEC 10646, the MIME charset label defined here will stay aligned with the previous version until and unless the IETF specifically decides otherwise.  </s>
<s> 9. IANA Considerations The entry for UTF-8 in the IANA charset registry should be updated to point to this memo.  </s>
<s> 10.  </s>
<s> Security Considerations  </s>
<s> Implementers of UTF-8 need to consider the security aspects of how they handle illegal UTF-8 sequences.  </s>
<s> It is conceivable that in some  </s>
<s> circumstances an attacker would be able to exploit an incautious UTF-8 parser by sending it an octet sequence that is not permitted by the UTF-8 syntax.  </s>
<s> A particularly subtle form of this attack can be carried out against Yergeau Expires August 18, 2003 [Page 10] Internet-Draft UTF-8 February 2003  </s>
<s> a parser which performs security-critical validity checks against the UTF-8 encoded form of its input, but interprets certain illegal octet sequences as characters.  </s>
<s> For example, a parser might prohibit the  </s>
<s> NUL character when encoded as the single-octet sequence 00, but erroneously allow the illegal two-octet sequence C0 80 and interpret it as a NUL character.  </s>
<s> Another example might be a parser which prohibits the octet sequence 2F 2E 2E 2F ("/../"), yet permits the illegal octet sequence 2F C0 AE 2E 2F.  </s>
<s> This last exploit has actually been used in a widespread virus attacking Web servers in 2001; the security threat is thus very real.  </s>
<s> Another security issue occurs when encoding to UTF-8: the ISO/IEC 10646 description of UTF-8 allows encoding character numbers up to U+7FFFFFFF, yielding sequences of up to 6 bytes.  </s>
<s> There is therefore a risk of buffer overflow if the range of character numbers is not explicitly limited to U+10FFFF or if buffer sizing doesn't take into account the possibility of 5- and 6-byte sequences.  </s>

<s> If no-one have any issues with this, I hereby declare this done, and I will take over from here.  </s>
<s> Well, I have some comments on draft-yergeau-rfc2279bis-04.txt.  </s>
<s> Except for a few places, I'm not suggesting wording here.  </s>
<s> I leave that to the editor.  </s>
<s> Refer to (undated) ISO/IEC 10646 (not ISO/IEC 10646-1).  </s>
<s> Add after 10646: "and Unicode".  </s>
<s> Reason: A reference like ISO/IEC 10646 (usually) refers to the latest version, since it is undated, and (usually) refers to all parts (if in parts).  </s>
<s> (Note that the next edition of 10646 will be in just one part, not two parts as now, and that the UCS repertoire is defined by the union of the two current parts (and three amendments).)  </s>
<s> "sync" - "synchrony" (proper English).  </s>
<s> This is true only for the last few years, and applies only to 10646 editions, and Unicode major versions.  </s>
<s> The amendments and minor versions of Unicode have a more complex relationship.  </s>
<s> Suggested new text: "Unicode and ISO/IEC 10646 are kept synchronised, so that the character repertoires and code point assignments are the same for similarly timed versions/editions of these standards."  </s>
<s> Called "code position" in 10646.  </s>
<s> The term "character number" is wrong!  </s>
<s> Code positions (also when represented in UTF-8) need not represent  </s>
<s> characters (in some version of 10646/Unicode), but may be unassigned  </s>
<s> (in some version), or for non-characters.  </s>
<s> This does not mean that such code positions are excluded from being encoded in UTF-8.  </s>
<s> (So you need to reformulate a bit more than just correcting the term.)  </s>
<s> Since this restriction is in force also for UTF-8, simply say that C0, C1, F5-FF never occur in well-formed UTF-8 data.  </s>
<s> In addition (in a separate point, for clarity), for well-formed UTF-8, E0 will not be followed by a byte less than or equal to 9F, ED will not be followed by a byte greater than or equal to A0, F0 will not be followed by a byte less than or equal to 8F, and F4 will not be followed by a byte greater than or equal to 90 (hexadecimal).  </s>
<s> Say "binary order" (nothing about sorting, and not unqualified).  </s>
<s> It may be of use for internal data representation purposes (like search trees).  </s>
<s> ...in shortest form (though no less than 4 digits).  </s>
<s> This reference should be dated, since the annex numbers/letters may differ between editions of 10646 (or the annex reference number deleted).  </s>
<s> UTF-8 is algorithmic, and does not depend on whether a given code position is for a *character* or not.  </s>
<s> However the given code has to be a Unicode scalar value (not a surrogate code point, nor above 10FFFF).  </s>
<s> But it is an error to try to encode a value that is not a Unicode scalar value.  </s>
<s> The latter should be explicitly pointed out.  </s>
<s> Please maintain the distinction between code positions (scalar values) and characters.  </s>
<s> Not all scalar values represent characters.  </s>
<s> I agree that it is unfortunate that Unicode and 10646 do not use exactly the same terminology though.  </s>
<s> Please maintain distinctions between character, scalar value (code position), and code unit sequence.  </s>
<s> Decoding a UTF-8 code unit sequence can lead to a *sequence* of code positions, some may be for characters, some for non-characters, and some for unassigned code positions.  </s>
<s> This can be read as it is ok to silently drop ill-formed subsequences.  </s>
<s> But that is definitely not ok, since that can lead to security issues.  </s>
<s> As mentioned, this need not encode a character (so the "-char" is misleading).  </s>
<s> (I've added some newlines and spaces above to make the text somewhat easier to read.)  </s>
<s> Preferably, WORD JOINER should be used as a zero-width no-break space, not the character ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE, despite the name!  </s>
<s> This should be taken up early in this section.  </s>
<s> The initial 3 *octets*, *not* the initial character.  </s>
<s> It actually the octet sequence that acts as a signature, NOT the character so encoded per se (decoding it to a character happens later, and the BOM character cannot act as "signature", it's the same for all encoding forms).  </s>
<s> Hmmm, part of the intent of using this particular character as a basis for signatures, is that a zero-width no-break space would not be very disruptive even if kept; it has no visible width, it does not signify any additional break point (so it works like NO BREAK HERE...).  </s>
<s> And it is a slightly smaller security issue if NOT deleted, even if at the beginning of something (unclear what that something is; consider HTTP or even more to the point SMTP/MIME (after the headings, and inside some of the headings...)).  </s>
<s> Move this to earlier in this section.  </s>
<s> "illegal" - "ill-formed" (through-out); There is no point in having THREE terminologies for the same things.  </s>
<s> Can we please try to converge to ONE terminology for these Unicode/10646 matters.  </s>
<s> Similarly, "byte" - "octet" through-out.  </s>
<s> It is not just ill-formed UTF-8 sequences that may lead to security  </s>
<s> problems.  </s>
<s> Here's a list (no claim of completeness):  </s>
<s> ILL-FORMED UTF-8 SUBSEQUENCES (that aren't part of well-formed UTF-8 subsequences): These MUST NOT be silently deleted by a decoder.  </s>
<s> The error indication for ill-formed subsequences should not be easy to ignore.  </s>
<s> Note that there are ill-formed subsequences that never have been properly decodable to code points, e.g. too short sequences, and isolated continuation octets.  </s>
<s> Note that, e.g., ". ill-fmd ." - ".." may cause a security problem.  </s>
<s> (The editor is of course free to expand on this, I'm NOT suggesting wording here!) BOM: MUST NOT be deleted by a decoder.  </s>
<s> (See the next point.) NON-CHARACTERS, UNASSIGNED, DEFAULT_IGNORABLES incl.  </s>
<s> ZWNBSP: These MUST NOT be deleted by a decoder.  </s>
<s> Deleting any character may, like replacing ill-formed sequenced with the empty string of characters, lead to security problems.  </s>
<s> Non-characters are not intended to be exchanged across "systems" (with an undefined meaning of "system"), but that does not imply that a recipient may delete them immediately when received, esp.  </s>
<s> when in a security sensitive context.  </s>
<s> NLF (new line function), SPACES, OTHER SYNTACTIC ELEMENTS: Note that security scanning may assume a different syntax than a subsequent interpreter.  </s>
<s> E.g. if the "scanner" only recognises SPACE and TAB as "whitespace", the division into elements may be quite different if a subsequent interpreter recognises also all category Zs characters as spaces.  </s>
<s> This problem is not new to Unicode, since the problem with CR, LF, CR+LF, NEL, FF, and VT is present also for other character encodings, but Unicode adds PS (PARAGRAPH SEPARATOR) and LS (LINE SEPARATOR) to this set.  </s>
<s> NORMALISATION If a security scan does not handle normalisation in the same way as a subsequent interpreter, security problems may arise.  </s>
<s> E.g. if "Kovert" is an access restricted folder, if the source uses the KELVIN SIGN for the K, the security scan may miss that "Kovert" is accessed if the actual access uses any normalisation.  </s>
<s> CHECKSUMS and DIGITAL SIGNATURES Any change will corrupt the document signed (or just checksummed), so any kind of normalisation (e.g.) must be done before the signature (or checksum) is computed, otherwise the signature/checksum will be invalidated.  </s>
<s> Similarly for the insertion/deletion of BOM, non-characters, etc. FALLBACKS Fallbacks should not be used within the UCS (but that is sometimes done anyway), but is commonly used when converting to another character encoding.  </s>
<s> Note that in either case, fallbacks may give rise to security problems.  </s>
<s> E.g., if two-dot leader is "felled back" to "..", or if any unconvertable character is felled back to "?" (which in some circumstances is interpreted as matching any character).  </s>
<s> "characters" - "zero or more characters".  </s>
<s> A UTF-8 decoder MUST NOT silently remove ill-formed subsequences, but MAY nevertheless (still together with an error indication) replace each with a code that indicates that there may have been an encoding error (together with another error indication).  </s>
<s> Note that U+001A SUBSTITUTE is a control code which exist for that specific purpose (but for any encoding).  </s>
<s> I fail to see the point in this forking.  </s>
<s> Comma, period?  </s>
<s> Refer also to UAX 13, Newline recommendations, UAX 15, Normalisation, and the Unicode character database.  </s>
