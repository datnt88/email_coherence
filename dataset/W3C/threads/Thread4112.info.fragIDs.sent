*Data Model, Section 4.2.1* says /"Document nodes and XPath 1.0 root nodes are essentially identical."/ 
If these terms are identical, why invent another term ? 
If they are not identical, it would be good to have some indication of the differences here. 
And if we must have another term, why call it a "document node" ? 
This will naturally be confused with the "document element", which in XPath 1.0 is the child of the root node. 
Since the node represents the document information item and we call it document in the type system it is probably better to call it document node. 
"Root node" is often interpreted as the top-level element node in a document and thus not a good choice.
