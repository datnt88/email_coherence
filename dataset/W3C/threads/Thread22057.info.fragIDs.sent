I have suggested to the DOM test suite WG that it might be beneficial to use RDF to describe the tests to be formulated and their relations to the recommendations, approval status, etc. 
Unfortunately, my lack of knowledge with RDF has made it difficult for me to effectively advocate that approach. 
I was wondering if there was anyone here would might be able to participate the the www-dom-ts mailing list or at least be able to provide some guidance on using RDF to describe DOM tests. 
Here is a synopsis: The definitive definition of a DOM tests is in XML and the test is 
identified by a fragment URI. 
A test suite is a collection of tests and other suites and is identified by a URI. 
Tests will need to identify their source, creation date, versioning information, and relationship to particular passages in the corresponding recommendations. 
The "big" questions now are: Whether to use RDF or a custom metadata approach? 
What immediate benefits would using RDF have? 
For example, could some browser access the RDF file and guide you through the maze. 
Should the metadata be embedded in the test definitions or in a separate file or both? 
Is DCMES (http://dublincore.org/documents/2001/04/11/dcmes-xml/) the approach to start with? 
What, if any, custom properties need to be defined. 
For example, should the relationship between a test and a suite be expressed using a generic dc:relation/ tag or should we define more specialized properties like domts:childOf/ . 
I took my first baby steps with RDF with a trivial example of DCMES describing some example tests at 
I would appreciate any comments. 
Check out EARL. 
Love. ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE 
Where did you get that URI from? 
It was pretty out of date (I've now got it pointing at the latest development schema). 
The EARL homepage is actually at:- - EARL It may well be that this would be an excellent application for EARL, seeing as how Arnold's following comments are very close to the data model that we have:- The definitive definition of a DOM tests is in XML and the test is 
identified by a fragment URI. 
A test suite is a collection of tests and other suites and is identified by a URI. 
Tests will need to identify their source, creation date, versioning information, and relationship to particular passages in the corresponding recommendations. 
For example, EARL uses URIs to identify tests, has a generic mechanism for evaluating against a range of Test Cases, and Test Criteria, and contains numerous dating, versioning, and similar properties. 
Check out the schema that's (now) at the URI William posted, and the homepage prose for more details.

Using a distinct file for each test does seem to be a better approach that inlining tests into suites since there are distinct sources for the tests and you want independent revision histories, etc. Do you have a particular pattern that you would like to use for the definition of a suite? 
My current schema reflected the earlier efforts and only supported in-lining of tests in suites and references to externally defined suites. 
Could someone throw off a quick sample of what an RDF in XML using EARL (and Dublin Core or other appropriate Ontology) for my little sample DOM test suite [...] 
Done, and attached as  DOM-TS.rdf  . 
Also find attached the Notation3 version as  DOM-TS.n3  . 
What I did was take a snippet of Curt's Dublin Core version, and converted it as best I can into EARL. 
Note that the Dublin Core stuff was intended as a very general *vocabulary*, but not as a model for expressing evaluations, so although it is O.K. to use Dublin Core terms in EARL, you can't use them to express things such as "this is a test suite" or "somebody asserts X", or "this fails/passes this", which is what EARL allows you to do (i.e. EARL provides an evaluation mechanism, and a few terms, which can be supplemented by Dublin Core , RDFS, FOAF, or whatever). 
How would you represent that a test was accepted (or rejected) by a specific authority (such as the DOM WG)? 
In this case, I've put "Arnold Curt says that this test suite passes this ID in the DOM specification". 
You could change that to say that "the DOM WG says that (x)" or even "Arnold Curt says that (x), and the DOM WG say that (x)" or "the DOM WG say that (y), developed by Arnold Curt, (x)", or anything else along those lines.
