<s> I have a MathML test document at It parses ok and most of the character entities are ok but there are lots of  characters interspesed in the display Can anyone spot the problem.  </s>
<s> Is it in the code or is it in the Amaya browser ??? Inquiring minds are wondering !!!  </s>

<s> Hello John, In fact, there are two kinds of problems with this document.  </s>
<s> The first one ( characters interspesed in the display) is due to a communication problem between the HTML parser and the XML parser used in Amaya.  </s>
<s> For HTML documents with embedded XML sub-trees (as in the document you mentionned), Amaya starts with the HTML parser and for each math ... /math sequence, launches the XML parser.  </s>
<s> The second problem concerns many entities (as &amp;amp;langle; for instance) that are not correctly interpreted by Amaya.  </s>
<s> We will solve these problems in the next release Regards Laurent Carcone  </s>
<s> Actually entities like &amp;amp;langle; are correctly interpreted by Amaya.  </s>
<s> The &amp;amp; escapes the interpretation of the entity.  </s>
<s> Regards Irene.  </s>
