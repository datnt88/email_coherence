The descriptions of subtract-dateTimes-yielding-yearMonthDuration and 
-dayTimeDuration say: "If the normalized value of $srcval1 follows in time the normalized value of $srcval2, the returned value is a negative duration." 
This should say "precedes" rather than "follows", according to the example. 
They would then be consistent with subtract-dates and subtract-times as well. 
Thanks, Priscilla 
Priscilla: 
The subtract-* function subtract the second argument from the first. 
So, if the first precedes the second the result is a negative duration. 
The text seems to be correct for dateTimes but incorrect for subtract-dates and subtract-times. 
I'll fix that. 
The example from subtract-dateTimes-yielding-yearMonthDuration is below. 
This may have been fixed in the latest version. 
fn:subtract-dateTimes-yielding-yearMonthDuration(xs:dateTime("2000-10-30 T11:12:00"), xs:dateTime("1999-11-28T09:00:00")) returns a xdt:yearMonthDuration value corresponding to 11 months. 
All the best, Ashok 
Hi Ashok, I agree that it should be "precedes" and the result will be negative. 
In the example, $srcval1 follows $srcval2 and it is positive, as expected. 
But, it looks to me (in the March 21, 2003 internal draft) like the text _is_ correct in subtract-dates and subtract-times, but incorrect in subtract-dateTimes-*. Right? 
Thanks, Priscilla
