<s> The descriptions of subtract-dateTimes-yielding-yearMonthDuration and  </s>
<s> -dayTimeDuration say: "If the normalized value of $srcval1 follows in time the normalized value of $srcval2, the returned value is a negative duration."  </s>
<s> This should say "precedes" rather than "follows", according to the example.  </s>
<s> They would then be consistent with subtract-dates and subtract-times as well.  </s>
<s> Thanks, Priscilla  </s>
<s> Priscilla:  </s>
<s> The subtract-* function subtract the second argument from the first.  </s>
<s> So, if the first precedes the second the result is a negative duration.  </s>
<s> The text seems to be correct for dateTimes but incorrect for subtract-dates and subtract-times.  </s>
<s> I'll fix that.  </s>
<s> The example from subtract-dateTimes-yielding-yearMonthDuration is below.  </s>
<s> This may have been fixed in the latest version.  </s>
<s> fn:subtract-dateTimes-yielding-yearMonthDuration(xs:dateTime("2000-10-30 T11:12:00"), xs:dateTime("1999-11-28T09:00:00")) returns a xdt:yearMonthDuration value corresponding to 11 months.  </s>
<s> All the best, Ashok  </s>
<s> Hi Ashok, I agree that it should be "precedes" and the result will be negative.  </s>
<s> In the example, $srcval1 follows $srcval2 and it is positive, as expected.  </s>
<s> But, it looks to me (in the March 21, 2003 internal draft) like the text _is_ correct in subtract-dates and subtract-times, but incorrect in subtract-dateTimes-*. Right?  </s>
<s> Thanks, Priscilla  </s>
