Per our last meeting, we will be having conference calls this morning, and 
every monday morning thereafter at 10 AM Boston Time. 
Calls will be on the MIT bridge, at least in January.

Ach - I forgot to change the "recurrence" frequency of the meeting on my calendar program, and hadn't checked my ER mail folder yet so didn't get the reminder in time. 
I'm guessing that happened for many. 
Sorry, try again next week! 
Michael 
I was flying to boston and forgot to send regrets.
