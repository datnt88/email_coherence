<s> LS:: "Is this conference also going to address the development of guidelines that can optimize the benefits of the web for the educationally challenged and persons with learning disability."  </s>
<s> WL: Short answer: yes.  </s>
<s> Longer answer is that throughout W3C and especially WAI "everyone, everything connected" is more than a slogan.  </s>
<s> I know the "everyone" part seems slighted and it is possible that our central notions of full interoperability, universal design, and device independence are vain hopes - well-meaning but impractical - but at least one old geezer thinks not.  </s>
<s> Often used pejoratively is "one size fits all" but the implications of that might be too facile in a culture (humankind) in which "blind", "dumb", "illiterate", etc. are built into languages (at least this one) with an implied put-down attitude.  </s>
<s> The characteristics of "this conference" will be determined by its participants and if any of this means anything to you or your "contacts" the best course of action is to join in - we need all the help we can get.  </s>
<s> The guidelines are a dynamic, living document that will be changed or else be of no import.  </s>
<s> So: don't just ask - do!  </s>
<s> Since we seek full inclusion and since the populations you seem to represent are probably the largest groups of PWDs world-wide, it would really be helpful to have their needs properly addressed.  </s>
<s> If we lack the experience to address this intelligently, then shame on us, but shame on whoever knows about this possibility and doesn't assist us with guidance.  </s>
<s> Love.  </s>
<s> ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE  </s>
