<s> I find the introduction of "optional features" in XML most unfortunate  </s>
<s> Me too - I've been feeling bad ever since the vote.  </s>
<s> Maybe the WG can help us out here.  </s>
<s> Where we got to on the ERB was:  </s>
<s> 1. external text entities are a basic necessity for authoring (I want to  </s>
<s> validate my 700-page book without having to have it in a file) and they're not even that hard to do [once you've limited the system identifier repertoire, which we've done].  </s>
<s> Arguably, without them, XML is a delivery-only toy language 2. external text entities are big-time bad news for a browser - particularly since browsers are moving in the direction of exposing the document structure to client-side logic.  </s>
<s> And in fact the jam-it-in-the-parse-tree semantic of text entities is not really the kind of transclusion you want in a browser.  </s>
<s> So what we REALLY WANT is to say "Here is a feature that is intended for authoring and document management but look, boyo, don't you go asking client programs to do this!" I had proposed a side-step by saying you could only use osfile system identifiers for text entities, but this kind of smells like a kludge.  </s>
<s> Bob Streich had earlier spoken about server-mode vs. client-mode XML; is this anything more than an option by another name?  </s>
<s> I think I speak for the ERB when I say that we would welcome a way to throw out the optional bathwater without losing the text entity baby, and cheerfully reconsider the vote of the 23rd.  </s>

<s> I would like to point that at least one person on the ERB (me) passionately believes that this viewpoint is totally misguided... ... it is certainly possible to build a fine authoring environment without any use of external text entities.  </s>
<s> James is correct; it is certainly possible to do this.  </s>
<s> But SGML provides a built-in, standard, nonproprietary way to go about it.  </s>
<s> The way I sell SGML in the corporate world is: SGML gives you: 1. a way to model the structure of your documents, and 2. a way to control the authoring so they come out right, and 3. a way to modularize documents for re-use and management, and 4. ALL OF THIS IS STANDARDIZED AND NON-PROPRIETARY It seems to me that if XML loses text entities, then #4 no longer applies to #3.  </s>
<s> I think you can get 3 and 4 without external text entities by using transclusion via link semantics, which are going to be standardized in a later phase of XML. James  </s>

<s> Agreed.  </s>
<s> When explaining external text entities to new SGML users, they invariably leap to the conclusion these are hypertext links.  </s>
<s> They are usually disappointed when I explain these are not.  </s>
<s> They then ask, why the extra features.  </s>
<s> We dropped these from the IADS and IDE/AS designs for precisely this reason: we were getting this functionality from the hyperlinks.  </s>
<s> Wouldn't an independent link with a semantic of get do this job?  </s>
