<s> * Listing vs. grouping vs. sectioning vs. paragraphing vs. theming Inline lists have been raised in many fora.  </s>
<s> This is a step in the right direction; as Al said (something like): "elements are for what they do, not where they go".  </s>
<s> I'd like to add that they're also not for what they look like, or how they render in any modality.  </s>
<s> The bottom line, as TimBL put it, is to "say what you mean, rather than what you want done with it".  </s>
<s> Sighted readers infer semantics from visual presentation.  </s>
<s> a,b,c and d infer a choice class of information.  </s>
<s> Breaks in text (para class of presentation)infer some level of change in subject matter.  </s>
<s> That's historically true, but still relevant.  </s>
<s> * Annotations, linking sections together Following on from general "metadata", the GL group have often expressed needs for:- *** Associating images with text, and stating a precise relationship *** Providing annotations of content for semantic pragmatics, etc. *** Being able to provide labels for form mechanisms etc.  </s>
<s> This is generally termed as "annotation".  </s>
<s> RDF provides an excellent way to make annotations, but it means canonicalizing that link to the metadata.  </s>
<s> It means making it as standard as rel="stylesheet" is now; which is probably a good thing.  </s>
<s> Annotation can also help when adding metadata about the varieties of content of different modalities,  </s>
<s> That worries me. the link, rel="stylesheet" is reputedly something James Clark threw together to fill a gap.  </s>
<s> I still like the structural association inLineContent .... /  </s>
<s> * Content of different modalities cf. http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2001JulSep/1000 - The Alt/Object Problem MIME types are getting to be more and more redundant (in that they should be replaced with URIs) as time goes on, and genericity of documents is an important factor.  </s>
<s> Consider fragment identifiers on a document that is an audio run.  </s>
<s> The media type might be MP3, RAM, or even an HTML transcript.  </s>
<s> The reference to "one minute into the audio" should be the same across content types.  </s>
<s> Nice one.  </s>

<s> Are you looking for common syntax here Sean?  </s>
<s> * Classes, IDs, extensions.  </s>
<s> Extra semantics: action item, poem If someone wants (traditionally) to ascribe extra semantics to a set of elements, they have to use the "class" attribute.  </s>
<s> There is a problem with that in that there is no way to define what this new class means.  </s>
<s> It would be possible to come up with an RDF Schema that people could follow to define what the new classes mean.  </s>
<s> It would then be possible to retrieve this definition, using the afforementioned metadata linking mechanism.  </s>
<s> This smacks of changing the problem domain.  </s>
<s> If an application goes digging around a website, it might come up with one or many words to replace the contents of the class attribute with other words.  </s>
<s> The problem then is interpreting those words.  </s>
<s> surely the real problem is semantic interpretation of the contents of the class attribute.  </s>

<s> I wonder if the letters that correspond to each choice can be considered style or structure?  </s>
<s> I think that the CSS group considered them to be style, and styling bullet points is a matter for CSS, but note also the fact that user agents should copy out the points (whatever style they may be) into the clipboard.  </s>
<s> The thing to aim for w.r.t.  </s>
<s> XHTML 2.0 - and indeed all those languages that are under the XAG domain - is that they promote grouping and selection by elem/attr type, and have sufficient identity that one may apply a particular style to the elems/attrs later on.  </s>
<s> The kind of issue that I was raising was as to why we should have a seperate element for list items?  </s>
<s> Why can't paragraphs be list items?  </s>
<s> When you think about it, the different types of grouping/selection/division elements in XHTML are fairly arbitrary, and their choices seem to be based on those of information types in pre-Web printed media.  </s>
<s> I can't say that I'd do it *much* differently, but I wonder why we should step when we can take a leap.  </s>
<s> [Annotations] It means making it as standard as rel="stylesheet" is now; which is probably a good thing.  </s>
<s> Annotation can also help when adding metadata about the varieties of content of different modalities,  </s>
<s> Oops, I should have been more careful with my wording...  </s>
<s> I didn't mean that there should be a mechanism similar to rel="stylesheet" technology-wise (I'm neutral as to how the link type gets implemented), I just meant that there should be a very basic type in the language that everyone can recognize as the de_facto for making that association.  </s>
<s> In XHTML, at the moment, there isn't one, and that's bad news all around.  </s>
<s> The media type might be MP3, RAM, or even an HTML transcript.  </s>
<s> The reference to "one minute into the audio" should be the same across content types.  </s>
<s> I'm not actually sure.  </s>
<s> The general opinion on the semantics of fragment identifiers seems to change wildy depending upon who you're discussing it with.  </s>
<s> TimBL talks about documents as having layers of genericity:- And DanC has talked about FragIDs being the same across media types, but I'm not all that sure that an ID served out in HTML content can also be served out in RDF as a variant.  </s>
<s> Are they mutually exclusive?  </s>
<s> The RDF MIME type hasn't even been registered, so it's difficult to tell.  </s>
<s> So, what I really want is consensus on the matter.  </s>
<s> A common syntax *would* be a very nice thing to have, to avoid things like XPointer.  </s>
<s> XPointer was the thing that brought this issue up, for me.  </s>
<s> [I know you've already got the following, but I want to spell it out for reference purposes, and to clarify the position to myself.]  </s>
<s> Consider if you have an audio transcript being served up as a variant of some audio piece.  </s>
<s> In other words, when you visit:- Depending upon your "accept" headers, you will either get back an XML transcript of the audio, or the audio as some other form.  </s>
<s> Now, it is quite possible to use an XPointer to point to some part of the transcript, for example:- But that XPointer may (and probably will not) apply to the audio media type, so it's a dodgy URI-reference.  </s>
<s> Consistent fragment syntax?  </s>
<s> I'd settle for almost anything, it'd be better than what we have now.  </s>
<s> We already have the ID datatype for XML, so why not get that consistently deployed?  </s>
<s> Of couse, when you get to  </s>
<s> XML, the meaning of the FragID should probably be cast off to the schema for the root namespace.  </s>
<s> * Classes, IDs, extensions.  </s>
<s> Extra semantics: action item, poem  </s>
<s> Yep.  </s>
<s> More a case of me rambling off in an odd direction, rather than deliberately changing the problem domain.  </s>
<s> Identifying the lcasses is of course important, which is why they should map to URIs, or have some kind of well-set-out structure so that we can model them.  </s>
<s> At the moment, XHTML doesn't really have anything suitable enough, unless you take the profile attribute to create a kind of namespace for the class attribute values as well as the rel/rev attribute values.  </s>
<s> That's a gross hack, so something needs to be resolved for XHTML 2.0; although any leaning towards QNames/URIs would make it more difficult to style with CSS.  </s>
<s> I've done a fair amount of practical experimentation on this issue.  </s>

<s> Could this be an author responsibility?  </s>
<s> Thinking of DAISY, which uses smil, the master source is taken as something outside the XML. this master file links out to a)the text using a url+fragid, b)the audio, using a time offset.  </s>
<s> I guess a video could be the same?  </s>
<s> With xlink principles, the link database would be the place to hold links, from some master out into all media, from a common place.  </s>
<s> That would provide the 'synchronisation' that DAISY has.  </s>
<s> It does rely on the provision of a master file (DAISY name for the link database) from which all xrefs are found.  </s>
<s> Also on the realisation that this document will be delivered in n media.  </s>
