<s> Hello, Wendy and I have made some changes to the WAI GL home page [1] to clean it up and make it Triple-A conformant to the WCAG 1.0.  </s>

<s> Why do I get purple borders around icons now?  </s>
<s> Is that a new style?  </s>

<s> I removed the "border" attribute from the IMG element to make the page HTML 4.0 strict.  </s>
<s> The result is that borders appear in whatever color the user has preferred.  </s>

<s> It says: /* this exposes a bug in NS4p3..5 - links become block elements!  </s>
<s> A { border:none; That's the reason.  </s>
<s> Well, I'm aware of this problem, and as far as I know, "border-style: none" doesn't expose such a buggy effect, and works fine with other CSS-aware user agents, though, it doesn't erase borders in Netscape Navigator :- I'm using some "hack" to erase borders at http://www.w3.org/Mobile/ , which is also Triple-A conformant to the WCAG 1.0.  </s>
