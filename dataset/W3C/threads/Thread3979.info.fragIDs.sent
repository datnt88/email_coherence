I read through the latest working draft minor errors that need to be fixed: 
1.1.1 
The list of enhancements is incomplete. 
It also needs to include: - An optional element for declaring the jurisdiction of data recipients - Definitions of identified, identifiable, linked, and linkable data - An optional element for declaring domain relationships - A compact version of the STATEMENT element for use in compact policies It would also be good to list the relevant sections for all of these items 
1.3 change reference to my book to a reference in the non-normative references appendix 
1.3.1 last sentence, there is a quoted phrase at the end of the sentence - remove quotes and italicize instead. 
2.3.2.7 In first sentence of paragraph hyperlink "linked" to 1.3.4 
2.3.2.9 The section about Domain Relationships -- This section modifications would allow -- modifications allow change hyperlink to issues to a reference in the non-normative references appendix 
2.3.2.9.1 extension element to -- extension to 
the extension needs an xmlns (in BNF and examples) 
2.3.2.9.3 when only using -- when using 
2.5 This doesn't appear to reflect the changes I proposed in my April 9 email 
3.2.3 required. 
or mixed. 
-- required or mixed. 
3.3.2 
one implementers authoring -- one implementer's authoring 
3.3.6.1 need xmlns attribute and long and short description in BNF and examples 
4 strike first paragraph (repeated in second paragraph) 
4.7 Add: See Section 6.4 for guidelines designed to reduce the chance that a P3P user agent will accept an invalid compact policy. 
6.2 are available at ??? -- will be posted on the W3C web site when they become available. 
remove the . 
at the end of the money definition 
add the CATEGORIES label to the first column of demographic 
CATEGORIES optional -- the wording here is stated as "the data element" but I think "this data" would make more sense... 
I wasn't involved in this discussion 
Appendix 9 - add P3P 1.1 working group contributors in a new paragraph at the beginning 
Changelog - spell check, I see a bunch of typos Also we need to add the following (basically a summary of our backwards compatibility guidelines documenting that we followed them): 1.1.7 Backwards Compatibility P3P 1.1 has been designed so that P3P 1.0 user agents can process P3P 1.1 policies and policy reference files. 
This implies both that the P3P 1.1 policies and policy reference files are fully compliant with the P3P 1.0 XML schema, and that the semantics of these files will not be misinterpreted by a user agent that interprets them according to the P3P 1.0 specification. 
All new syntax introduced in P3P 1.1 has been introduced as optional extensions using the P3P 1.0 extension mechanism. 
Changes to requirements or definitions introduced in P3P 1.1 add clarity where the P3P 1.0 specification is ambiguous, but do not cause a particular P3P vocabulary element to have different meanings in P3P 1.0 and P3P 1.1. 
In addition, some new requirements or features have been introduced in the P3P 1.1 specification that do not impact the ability of P3P 1.0 user agents to process P3P 1.1 policies and policy reference files. 
I agree with Lorrie's recommended changes to section 2.3.2.9, with the following additions: 
2.3.2.9 rewrite intro paragraph as follows (with link moved to references section as Lorrie suggested): This section describes a method to allow user agents to recognize when hosts 
in different domains are owned by the same entity or entities acting as agents for one another. 
User agents may use this information when applying privacy preferences, particularly to avoid implementation issues encountered when more stringent privacy preferences are applied to domains that are deemed to be owned by third-parties. 
2.3.2.9.1 examples need to change "instance.example.com" 
to "example2.com" 
(6 occurrences). 
The example is not powerful unless it demonstrates different domains (it used to be forinstance.com) 
need to change "*.myagent.example" 
in second example to "*.myagent.com" 
2.3.2.9.3 "to the OUR-HOSTS declarations" -- "to the OUR-HOST declarations" replace "instance.example.com" 
with "example2.com"

Hi hi, got your first version of Draft. 
Should be fixed now 
Pattern not found: required. 
or mixed 
But I think we deprecated the use of Group-Info as it is already included in the grouping mechanism..

We decided to remove 4.7, no? 
At least this is what the Spec says at the moment. 
I think it is already said in 6.4, no?

A good question to the list..

This is right before the sentence "Statement groups serve two main purpose:" (which should say "purposes" rather than "purpose") 
ok Lorrie
