<s> Hey, we're on the same page!! Nearly.  </s>
<s> I certainly agree that equivalence is a bad way to characterise the relationship between a brief set of notes on the "flight of the bumblebee" and the actual piece of music.  </s>
<s> (And I have never considered trying to explain what I like about Marianne Faithfull to a deaf person, although I believe it could be approximated).  </s>
<s> There isn't a strict verbal equivalent to Picasso's 'Guernika'.  </s>
<s> For that matter, nor is there a strict visual equivalent to Tolkein's "Lord of the Rings".  </s>
<s> Fortunately there is a difference between "expressing something completely" and "expressing something adequately".  </s>
<s> Describing the colour scheme used for a page is generally doing more than is needed, in that it doesn't add to the user's experience of the page, and may not even be meaningful to them.  </s>
<s> Ditto for the pretty ribbon chosen instead of a normal horizontal line.  </s>
<s> Describing Picasso's 'Guernika' as "black and white picture of people and animals" is probably doing less than is needed.  </s>
<s> But in many cases we communicate in roundabout ways, through rhetorical figures (Joe).  </s>
<s> While we might not convey the full beauty and superior nature of our communication, we can often convey the essence in words.  </s>
<s> For people whose experience of the Web is based solely on communicating through words, this is generally adequate.  </s>
<s> There are of course exceptions.  </s>
<s> When we are producing pure art it is difficult to directly express it, although there may be value in giving some idea what it is about or the sensation it produces in a viewer.  </s>
<s> And when we are talking just for the sake of it, without saying anything valuable, or just to stir up argument, it is an open question whether it is more useful to summarise the statements made, or to note that "somebody made their usual pointless contribution".  </s>
<s> The goal is to make our communication good enough.  </s>
<s> (I happen to dislike the phrase "able to be expressed in words" rather intensely, but until I have something better to propose I figure that it is good enough to convey the idea.I could of course be wrong).  </s>
<s> And describe ways that can be done.  </s>
<s> An alternative is expected to be good enough, and in that sense it has a relation of equivalence (which is a broad concept).  </s>
