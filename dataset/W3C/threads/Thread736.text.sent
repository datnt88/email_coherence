Hi Dave... 
I'm working on coding my first web site and a friend told me about Notetab and Tidy. 
I will say this that both are a very nice program for those who want a little more control over coding HTML. 
But I think I've found a problem with Tidy. 
I've coded a page in Notetab and then ran the same page through Dreamwaver. 
Which I then brought the second page into Notetab and ran tidy on both. 
Please find attached both files. 
"Intro.html" 
&amp; "Intro2.html" 
along with the error reports for both of these files. 
Now I am no expert in coding web pages or the like but as far as I can tell what the error log is saying is wrong isn't. 
But that is why I'm sending you these files in the hopes that maybe you can clear this up for me. 
As well as if there might be a little bit of a bug with tidy then maybe you can find it. 
I like this little program very much and find it a valuable tool.

I just looked at your pages. 
Sure enough, in intro.htm 
all I had to do was put in an alt="whatever" in the img tag of the offending line to get Tidy to agree that there were no errors or warnings. 
Then I looked at your error log for intro2.htm and Tidy saw an empty p in line 70 of intro2.htm. 
But when I ran Tidy myself, I didn't get that message. 
When I fixed the other warnings, Tidy said it was html 4.01 with no warnings or errors. 
Here are the changes I made manually to get Tidy to say "no warnings or errors." 
I used tidy4aug00 compiled from source under RedHat Linux 6.2. 
Change script language-"JavaScript" to Then, line 37, add an "alt" to your img tag, as in Line 78, change &amp; to &amp;amp; All the changes above are required by html 4.01, so near as I can tell, Tidy's doing the job. 
John Carroll Running the current version of Tidy (4-Aug-00) against "intro.htm" 
yields: line 21 column 334 - Warning: img lacks "alt" attribute ...and indeed there is no "alt" attribute on the "img" element at that location. 
The "alt" attribute is required on "img" elements in HTML 4.01 Transitional, so this warning from Tidy is correct. 
Note that if I validate your "intro.htm" file at: ...I get: Line 9, column 29: Error: value of attribute "HTTP-EQUIV" must be a single token Line 21, column 422: ... b/viewbook.gif" 
border="0" width="100" height="35" /A /P Error: required attribute "ALT" not specified Sorry, this document does not validate as HTML 4.01 Transitional. 
Validation is your friend! ;-) Running Tidy against "intro2.htm" gives: line 5 column 1 - Warning: script lacks "type" attribute line 37 column 6 - Warning: img lacks "alt" attribute line 78 column 856 - Warning: unescaped &amp; which should be written as &amp;amp; I do not get the "line 70 column 4 - Warning: trimming empty p " message. 
You don't have a DOCTYPE on this file, but assuming HTML 4.01 Transitional again: * The "alt" error is as above and is correct. 
* The "type" error is correct; 4.01 Transitional requires "type" on the "script" element. 
* The recommendation to use "&amp;amp;" for "&amp;" comes straight from the HTML 4.01 Specification: Authors should also use "&amp;amp;" in attribute values since character references are allowed within CDATA [p.50] attribute values. 
See: Hope this helps.
