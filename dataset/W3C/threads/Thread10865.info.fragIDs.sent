<s> On September 11th, the ERB spent considerable time revisiting the RS/RE question.  </s>
<s> We're just a fun-loving bunch, and it became apparent that the WG is going to have to put some more thought into this.  </s>
<s> At the moment, we have the -XML-SPACE mechanism, which toggles two behaviors: collapsing of leading and multiple spaces (essentially the HTML semantic), and passing through all the bytes to the application.  </s>
<s> Some feel the mechanism is unaesthetic and prone to misinterpretation as it stands, and should simply be discarded, with all non-markup bytes being passed to the application to do with as it will.  </s>
<s> This can be made 8879-compliant in the short term via a mechanism proposed by Charles Goldfarb, and in the medium/long term with a TC via WG8.  </s>
<s> There are some problems with both the current and revised approaches: o -XML-SPACE, although this is not documented, really only deals with mixed content; many feel it's important to ignore white space in element content; list item .. /item item .. /item /list e.g. the above but XML, when there's no DTD, doesn't know where element content is and *cannot* be made to do this.  </s>
<s> o SGML's world-view tripartions the set of characters: those that are text, those that are markup, and those that are insignificant white space.  </s>
<s> Can XML really afford to discard this distinction?  </s>
<s> o Many real-world editors, largely to deal with the fact that text (whether or not we like it) is stored in files in what amounts to a series of records, freely insert line breaks and other white space because they know SGML processors will ignore it.  </s>
<s> Can we afford to make that white space significant?  </s>
<s> o Some applications, e.g. full-text indexers, really need to know where everything is by byte offset, whether or not the bytes are significant; thus the -XML-SPACE="COLLAPSE" behavior means they can't read the text with an XML processor (unless they can turn off -XML-SPACE processing through the API) So there are a few things we could do, which are not entirely mutually exclusive.  </s>
<s> 1. Go to the RE Delenda Est model.  </s>
<s> This has the advantage that it's trivially easy to explain, document, and implement.  </s>
<s> It has some of the disadvantages listed above; there is some very strong sentiment on the ERB against this - look from a follow-up from other ERB-folk.  </s>
<s> 2. Expand the -XML-SPACE attribute from two values to three.  </s>
<s> The third would be named REMOVE or DISCARD or something, and would be designed to signal element content, i.e. all this white space can be safely ignored.  </s>
<s> 3. Add language to the spec allowing the application to force the processor to pass through all the bytes regardless of the -XML-SPACE setting.  </s>
<s> Your input is requested.  </s>

<s>  </s>
<s> | 3) A dichotomy between "DTD-ful" and DTD-less parsing will make any | sibling-based relationship difficult at best; this will affect some | TEI or HyQ based hyperlinks, as well as sibling-based stylistic | decisions.  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> Sorry to be so slow here, but what's the connection with sibling relationships?  </s>
<s> My idea of a well-formed XML document is one for which there is just one possible tree structure; what's different about sibling relationships if a DTD is provided?  </s>
<s> To which a kind correspondent replied:  </s>
<s> A DTD-less parser will interpret element-content whitespace as a #PCDATA node.  </s>
<s> A DTD-full parser will just strip it out.  </s>
<s> The number of nodes in your document will change.  </s>
<s> LIST UITEM ... /UITEM UITEM ... /UITEM /LIST Each newline will be a node in one, and not the other.  </s>
<s> Allow me to wallow in ignorance a bit further.  </s>
<s> I'm finding it hard to visualize a situation in which I would want to address something based on pseudo-element relationships rather than "genuine" tree relationships.  </s>
<s> It's easy to imagine cases where I would want to refer to the TITLE descendant of my ancestor CHAPTER, for example, but I have never wanted to refer to the third linefeed in an element.  </s>
<s> I'm not saying that such situations are inconceivable, I'm just saying that I've never encountered one.  </s>
<s> Is this one of those cases where 90 percent of the complexity we're worrying about is being caused by a feature that in practice is used .001  </s>
<s> percent of the time?  </s>
<s> Jon  </s>
<s> Such hyperlinking could be useful in solving a difficult problem: alignment in multilingual texts.  </s>
<s> That said, I still feel that 1) We are the "Masters of the XML Grove Plans (tm)", 2) There are no DSSSL or HyTime systems based on XML that have a lagre user base yet, 3) No matter what we do, many *existing* SGML systems will not be able to parse XML instances without (relatively minor) changes to said systems, and that 4) we really do desire parse results to be the same, independent of whether we have a DTD or not, that having all whitespace be significant still seems a reasonable way to go.  </s>
<s> I can live with -XML-???? attributes as a standardised application hinting mechanism, but feel it's not really necessary, and that authors should never *assume* that it will always have the desired effect.  </s>
