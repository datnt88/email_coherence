Graham, Pat, Patrick, Readiong the minutes of the 2nd May I see that I was meant to discuss with you the text in msg I believe the major concern was with the first sentence, and that Pat was going to suggest a rewording to broaden it. 
I have currently put the text as is in the editors draft at: Patrick suggested: "The datatype abstraction used in RDF is compatible with XML Schema Part 2: Datatypes..." as the first sentence, which is certainly an improvement. 
Jeremy On reflection I have included Patrick's suggested change: "is compatible with" and also changed "A lexical space" to "The lexical space of a datatype". 
Jeremy Seems reasonable on a quick survey.
