<s> First of all I would like to thank you for your work about this project.  </s>
<s> I think HTML-Tidy should be part of every webmaster's toolbox.  </s>
<s> However, I noticed that tidy sometimes removes the link tag when I use it in some of my web pages, where I put a link to my stylesheet.  </s>
<s> Tidy give me a warning titled "Warning trimming link" or something...  </s>
<s> Everything else is just perfect !  </s>
<s> Thank you !  </s>
<s> Hello Alexandre,  </s>
<s> thanks :-)  </s>
<s> Hmmmm, it should not do that, can you possibly provide a sample file where this happened, only some elements with neither content nor attributes should get trimmed, for example pre /pre but never a link.  </s>
