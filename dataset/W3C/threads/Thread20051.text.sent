I created a style sheet that validates just fine and results in the sort of page display I would expect using IE. 
But when I display pages with this style sheet in Amaya (on Win 98) it is substitutes a gigantic font for the 10pt font that is supposed to be there. 
See and Is the problem my style sheet (if so where's the problem)? 
Or is the problem Amaya? 
Lorrie When I have a look at your pages, they look well. 
perhaps you have a local style sheet (amaya.css) that changes the general look? 
Irene. 
After I rebooted my computer and restarted Amaya, the problem went away. 
I have looked for a local style sheet but have not found any. 
And the problem has not reoccured. 
Random flakeyness? 
Lorrie I don't like this kind of random bug.
