<s> By the way, my boss (Dr Saarela), would like me to pose a couple of questions to the group for consideration...  </s>
<s> What's the judgement on type IDs (range values etc in RDF) now that the XML Schema spec is a Recommendation?  </s>
<s> Arity -- never sure if that's a legitimate word -- can the minOccurs, maxOccurs attributes be copied over to RDF definition?  </s>
<s> And another issue worth working on (but I think it's already active): digital signing of resources (I guess this brings up questions of  </s>
<s> canonicality of documents and hence works against my `resource is as resource does' liberal approach).  </s>
<s> Is rights management in general part of our concern now that we are drifting over to the question of legality  </s>
<s> of RDF assertion?  </s>

<s> Martyn, Lets remind ourselves what the WG charter says: ... fixes, clarifications and improvements to the specification of RDF's abstract model and XML syntax.  </s>
<s> and ... to complete the work on RDF vocabulary description present in the RDF Schema Candidate Recommendation.  </s>
<s> We are doing what TBL in Hong Kong characterized as a "clean up" of the rdf specs.  </s>
<s> To that end we are using an issue led process.  </s>
<s> There are issues with the current specifications and we are going to try to resolve those issues.  </s>
<s> The chairs have the job of scheduling the order that we tackle the issues to optimise our progress.  </s>
<s> It might be useful to review the charter and issues list with your boss.  </s>
<s> I'm not clear exactly what you mean here.  </s>
<s> What issue does this relate to?  </s>
<s> Has it been scheduled for discussion?  </s>
<s> Do you wish to propose that it be scheduled for early discussion?  </s>
<s> Why?  </s>
<s> How does it relate to XML Schema's progression to recommendation?  </s>
<s> I don't believe this is on the current issues list.  </s>
<s> If you wish to propose it as an issue, please can you write it up and submit it as a new issue for consideration.  </s>
<s> Your write up should clearly indicate why it is desirable to support arity constraints at the RDF schema level rather than in the ontology layer.  </s>
<s> I should say, that my first reaction is that this would be an extension to the current specification, not a fix to a current problem and that I'm not sympathetic to extensions being in scope.  </s>
<s> In general, in scheduling issues I'm trying to balance a desire to knock off some easy wins, resolve issues which are causing developers and others immediate concern quickly with a preference for starting with the the basic RDF model and working upwards.  </s>
<s> There is no such issue on the issues list.  </s>
<s> Again, feel free to propose one, but I'd suggest you review the charter before submitting it.  </s>
<s> No. Brian  </s>
<s> I believe the issue referred to is: and I think it should be considered that the DAML program has already developed a solution to this issue in their most recent DAML release.  </s>
<s> Perhaps the DAML work could be linked to from the issues list?  </s>
