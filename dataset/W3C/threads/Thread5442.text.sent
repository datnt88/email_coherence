Eolas suit may spark HTML changes By Paul Festa Staff Writer, CNET News.com 
As anxiety builds throughout the Web over the patent threatening Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser, the Web's leading standards group is considering modifying the medium's lingua franca itself, HTML, to address the same threat. 
The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is on the verge of forming a patent advisory group, or PAG, in response to the Eolas patent suit, according to sources close to the consortium. 
That group would conduct a public investigation into the legal ramifications of the patent on Hypertext Markup Language, the signature W3C standard that governs how most of the Web is written, and other specifications related to it. 
The W3C declined to comment on the PAG, but a representative acknowledged that the group had yet to conduct any formal investigation into the legal issues surrounding the patent and HTML. 
Eolas' $521 million patent victory over Microsoft and its Internet Explorer browser has sent shockwaves through the Web and the software industry as a whole. 
While Microsoft has pledged to appeal the ruling, it has already prepared for a worst-case scenario, as have companies such as Macromedia and Sun Microsystems whose technologies rely heavily on IE's ability to play plug-ins--the capability found to infringe on the Eolas patent. 
Now the W3C is said to be contemplating changes to HTML, considered one of the consortium's more mature and settled specifications. 
The potential problem for HTML is that it describes a way of summoning content located on a server other than the one serving the page in question. 
The "object" and "embed" tags in HTML, consortium members worry, may fall under the wording of the Eolas patent. 
Options the PAG could recommend include a technical workaround or new wording in HTML and related specifications warning that authors who implement the tags in question should contact the patent holders and take out a license, if necessary. 
The HTML PAG could also, as have previous PAGs in other working groups, launch a drive to discover "prior art," or technologies older than the Eolas patent that could potentially invalidate it in court. 
The W3C established the PAG system after its P3P privacy preferences recommendation was threatened by patents. 
The groups have since been formed to respond to patent disputes among VoiceXML working group members. 
The PAG policy was codified with the rest of the W3C's patent-averse policy, which was ratified in March after a rancorous debate. 
Eolas founder and sole employee Mike Doyle said the W3C was right to take a closer look at HTML with respect to his patent. 
"If you read the trial testimony, you'll see references several times to experts who testified that browsers that support the 'embed' and 'object' tags are covered by the patent," Doyle said in an interview. 
"You have to look at the details on a case-by-case basis, but the testimony at the trial was pretty complete."

In response to newly revealed details of Microsoft's potential plans to redesign its browser, Eolas founder Mike Doyle urged the software giant to leave Internet Explorer alone and pay his company a license fee instead. 
Doyle, whose company's patent suit led to a federal district court's $521 million judgment against Microsoft, made his remarks to counter growing perception in the software industry that he is an ideologically driven crusader unwilling to settle with Microsoft at any cost. 
"Microsoft has been representing to the world that they have no choice but to remove technology from the browser and disrupt the Internet," Doyle said in an interview Friday. 
"And I want to make it very clear that that is not the case. 
Microsoft has had in its power the ability to settle this case, and to the extent that they're refusing to settle, it's their decision." 
Since Eolas' victory at trial last month, the Web software industry has been consumed with speculation and planning on how to live with the patent, should it survive Microsoft's promised appeal. 
At a meeting at the San Francisco headquarters of Macromedia--maker of the ubiquitous Flash animation software that relies on IE's plug-in capabilities to survive--Microsoft outlined several possible technical work-arounds it was considering for the browser. 
People fear those options would, as Doyle suggested, disrupt the Internet by forcing many thousands of Web sites to be rewritten, or to abandon plug-ins altogether. 
Doyle himself may bear some responsibility for the perception that Eolas is not amenable to a settlement. 
In remarks to the press, he has raised the possibility that Eolas could simply refuse to license Microsoft the patented ability to run plug-in applications, while granting those licenses to other browsers or producing a browser of its own. 
On Friday, Doyle distanced himself from those remarks, calling them hypothetical. 
"I was talking more from the point of view of if someone acquired Eolas," Doyle said. 
"That company would have all the powers available to them under the patent laws. 
I also described it as a hypothetical situation among many possible scenarios. 
I think they may have grasped upon that particular argument and cast it in that light because they may see it to their advantage to build FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt) within the industry." 
Jan Conlin, an attorney who represented Eolas at trial, reiterated Doyle's position that Eolas was open to a settlement. 
"Microsoft and the Web community and consumers would be better off by Microsoft accepting the fact that this patent exists and paying for their fair use of it," said Conlin in an interview. 
"Microsoft does have the opportunity to settle this for a paid-up license. 
Microsoft has the opportunity to put this thing to bed now." 
Microsoft responded that, while it always looked at "reasonable" ways to settle ongoing litigation, the Eolas patent and demands did not fall under that definition. 
"We've often taken a license when it makes sense and that technology brings value to our products," said Jim Desler, a Microsoft representative. 
"But in this particular case we believe the patent is invalid, there was no infringement, we like our prospects on appeal, and we will certainly not pay for technology on the terms they're seeking."
