Hello every one, I hope not to disturb you too much. 
What is wrong with this example, which simply write my name: view The problem is after passing tidy -c, which give this span.c2 {font-size: 150%} i.c1 {font-size: 150%} i class="c1" Najib T /i span class="c2" O /span i class= "c1" UNSI /i view, which is not what I expect. 
Note: The problem does not appear with tidy -asxml Yours very sincerly Najib TOUNSI W3C Office Morocco Najib TOUNSI: There is one HTML error (a lack of a title element), but nothing that would give any actual problems in practical use. 
What is the actual problem? 
When I view both pieces of code in MSIE 5.5 they display the same, which is to be expected. 
The code Tidy gives you expresses the same thing in more complete and better HTML. 
The result in my browser is your name, in italics, except for the "O" that is not italic - in a large font - and that is exactly what both ways of coding expresses. 
Bertilo Wennergren Tidy has moved the font information into a style on the i element and replaced the middle font element with a span element. 
This is as expected. 
If there was an enclosing p , then in principle, tidy might have been able to move the font info to that since you specified the same font size throughout. 
However, that would involve more complexity than Tidy can deal with today.

http://www.w3.org/People/Raggett World Wide Web Consortium (on assignment from HP Labs) Tidy cleans HTML using a variety of rules of thumb that seek to replace font elements etc. by the use of style sheets. 
W3C encourages authors to separate content from presentation through the use of style sheets, and newer browsers are improving the fidelity in their support for CSS.

The problem is with the Netscape browser. 
With Amaya and Explorer, things are all right.
