Gender: male, female, other ? 
I'd think that would confuse people more than anything else (or make for some interesting results if nothing else)

"Is it necessary to make a radio button in a fieldset checked? 
I know that it is a requirement for WCAG 10.4 but how useful is it? 
I'm a bit worried by setting one as checked for say, indicating a user's gender in a form, and then that user hitting return accidentally and sending information that they haven't actually entered. 
I guess the same applies to checkboxes. 
For text inputs the problem is less because the form will just submit something like "enter your name" instead of a name but with buttons the data sent could be valid but incorrect" 
why not have a "Starting" point radio button, something like "other" or "N/A"

There are also a few folks who are in some intermediate trans-gender state, and a few who are considered to have both genders. 
This is why "other" may be an appropriate choice to make available.

Of course you're right, and in a form where that question was deemed appropriate this soluton might work but in the majority of real world applications there are usually set responses that must be made. 
I don't think there is a HR dept in the world that would dream of putting out an application form where it was possible to enter one's gender as "other". 
If I thought for more than five minutes I could probably come up with a few other examples. 
This is digressing a bit from the topic now though... 
A solution along the same lines might be to have a default radio button labelled 'not answered' and validate the form submission for the ocurrence of these and prompt the respondee to fill them in. 
Does anyone see any problems with that?

From a usability stand point, I do, since one is checked no matter which one it is so it is assumed that it has been chosen when the form is submitted. 
In forms where none of them are checked, when I get ot the point where I am given the option to review before submission, that one is skipped since no 
data is there if I don't want it to be. 
A good example is the age range 
validation radio buttons I have seen in some places. 
If it is not a required field and none are checked, no age range field even shows up on the presubmission output.

That's implementation dependent behaviour which conflicts with earlier HTML specifications and is now explicitly marked as implementation dependent. 
but it is certainly possible to have a "Blank" radio button I have seen this done, and there are questions that have manditory fields that in some 
cases are not accurate such that no button would correctly answer the question. 
and as an aside I know someone who always answers the sex question with the answer "Nun" Bob "They that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve Neither liberty nor safety", Benjamin Franklin ASCII Ribbon Campaign accessBob NO HTML/PDF/RTF in e-mail accessys@smartnospam.net NO MSWord docs in e-mail Access Systems, engineers NO attachments in e-mail, *LINUX powered* access is a civil right THIS message and any attachments are CONFIDENTIAL and may be privileged.

Only on browsers that implement it that way. 
Authors cannot rely on this behaviour. 
As I understand it, this was incorrect behaviour, but some browsers did it and the standards were changed from saying it was incorrect to saying that it was undefined. 
Form validation would check for the instance of the 'not answered' button and prompt the user to fill in that question. 
The form could not be submitted unless the user had chosen something other than the initial state. 
If the user has taken the selection away from the initial state (i.e. made a choice) then the form can be submitted. 
It's just a hack to get round the potential problem of UA behaviour not being predictable when no button is initially selected and I don't see any major usability problems *if* the question is a mandatory one. 
Even if the response is optional I think the solution works since the response ('not answered') is still valid. 
The form validation need only be made on mandatory fields.
