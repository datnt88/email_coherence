I am cross posting because this is a WCAG 2.0 definition that needs some 
work....... Currently in the latest WCAG 2.0 Draft "time-dependent presentation" is 
defined as below...... Definitions (informative) time-dependent presentation (1)A time-dependent presentation is a presentation which is composed of synchronized audio and visual tracks (e.g., a movie), OR (2)a presentation which requires the user to respond interactively at specific times in the presentation. 
.......I think that the (2) is a definition of "response time dependent 
presentation", rather than "time-dependent presentation". 
The response 
time issue is very important, but different. 
Also, I think it would be a good idea to provide language that includes 
other sense modalities (tracks). 
I realize that it is a bit premature to include "synchronized smell" and "synchronized vibration" tracks, but, I think we should have language that covers this eventuality.

Yep, I think Katie has captured an important distinction.

dependent 
response 
GV: Response time is not what is being discussed here. 
Response time IS a different issue. 
But this is talking about the case where a person must respond at a certain place in a presentation. 
When this occurs, a transcript is not sufficient. 
A transcript that says " and for xxxx hit your enter 
key now" doesn't work if the enter key has to be hit at a certain place in the audio program. 
(an alternate HTML doc with a link located at that point might be IF it gets you the same result.) 
So the issue IS essentially the same I think. 
Basically, it means that any audio transcript has to be synchronized with the normal audio track in order to be effective. 
Or were you trying to get at something different?

Yes, the distinction is very important. 
(Thanks Katie!) Also, the definition is incorrect. 
The first meaning is not still guessed right and the text that presents the examples demonstrates it. 
The definition that there is now includes the term " audio " and in the examples it is included "a silent animation." 
Indeed, so that the presentation is time based, not necessarily has to go accompanied by sounds. 
I propose the following definition: A time-dependent presentation is that whose necessary elements to transmit the information are presented in orderly succession in a certain period of time.

George Kercher calls it 'temporal' content. 
Yes, 'presentation' is too display-smelling if you want to include the case of time-dependent action opportunities. 
Time-dependent content is content where the sense [or more generally operational effectiveness] of the content depends in some way on time differences as they are realized in the actual, concrete user interaction with the content. 
Time-dependent content is sensitive to the time-flow fidelity of its realization in the delivery context. 
Audio and video streams, and time-limited promotional pricing are examples of time-dependent content. 
A synchronized bundle of time-dependent components such as a SMIL presentation may be regarded as one time-dependent content object, if the user perceives all the concurrent phenomena as part of an integrated experience relating to a common time interval such that time-coincidence is significant. 
Playback time and nominal playback time need not be exactly one to one, but distortion of the inter-component synchronization or playback rate beyond some limit may degrade or destroy the comprehensibility or operability of the content when it is time-dependent. 
See the "slow playback rate" provisions in the standard talking book specification for an example of such bounded-distortion playback.
