<s> GV: Response time is not what is being discussed here.  </s>
<s> Response time IS a different issue.  </s>
<s> But this is talking about the case where a person must respond at a certain place in a presentation.  </s>
<s> When this occurs, a transcript is not sufficient.  </s>
<s> A transcript that says " and for xxxx hit your enter  </s>
<s> key now" doesn't work if the enter key has to be hit at a certain place in the audio program.  </s>
<s> (an alternate HTML doc with a link located at that point might be IF it gets you the same result.)  </s>
<s> So the issue IS essentially the same I think.  </s>
<s> Basically, it means that any audio transcript has to be synchronized with the normal audio track in order to be effective.  </s>
<s> Or were you trying to get at something different?  </s>

<s> Yes, the distinction is very important.  </s>
<s> (Thanks Katie!) Also, the definition is incorrect.  </s>
<s> The first meaning is not still guessed right and the text that presents the examples demonstrates it.  </s>
<s> The definition that there is now includes the term " audio " and in the examples it is included "a silent animation."  </s>
<s> Indeed, so that the presentation is time based, not necessarily has to go accompanied by sounds.  </s>
<s> I propose the following definition: A time-dependent presentation is that whose necessary elements to transmit the information are presented in orderly succession in a certain period of time.  </s>

<s> George Kercher calls it 'temporal' content.  </s>
<s> Yes, 'presentation' is too display-smelling if you want to include the case of time-dependent action opportunities.  </s>
<s> Time-dependent content is content where the sense [or more generally operational effectiveness] of the content depends in some way on time differences as they are realized in the actual, concrete user interaction with the content.  </s>
<s> Time-dependent content is sensitive to the time-flow fidelity of its realization in the delivery context.  </s>
<s> Audio and video streams, and time-limited promotional pricing are examples of time-dependent content.  </s>
<s> A synchronized bundle of time-dependent components such as a SMIL presentation may be regarded as one time-dependent content object, if the user perceives all the concurrent phenomena as part of an integrated experience relating to a common time interval such that time-coincidence is significant.  </s>
<s> Playback time and nominal playback time need not be exactly one to one, but distortion of the inter-component synchronization or playback rate beyond some limit may degrade or destroy the comprehensibility or operability of the content when it is time-dependent.  </s>
<s> See the "slow playback rate" provisions in the standard talking book specification for an example of such bounded-distortion playback.  </s>
