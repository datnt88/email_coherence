Hi I have just set up a new linux box (running SuSE 8.1). 
Apache (including cgi-bin) and mySQL seem fine. 
(Of course they were pre-installed using the SuSE RPM's.) I then tried to install annotea from cvs using the instructions in I inserted the apache script into the working httpd.conf 
file. 
(I understood that access control and algae are not strictly necessary, so for testing purposes I omitted them -- I will return to these steps later.) 
When I point a browser at I get the unhelpful single line died with Undefined subroutine &amp;W3C::Util::W3CDebugCGI::LogEntry::__NR_gettimeofday called at /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.0/i586-linux-thread-multi/bits/syscall.ph line 550. 
in the browser window. 
There is no error log entry. 
The only thing I can deduce from this is that perl is trying to tell me something (an error message or debugging info) but because of a missing subroutine or module or something, it can't. 
Please could someone help? 
Many thanks Richard Kaye 
Looks like the syscall.ph 
does not have an interface for gettimeofday. 
I have three syscall.ph 
files: na:/home/eric$ locate syscall.ph 
/usr/lib/perl/5.8.0/bits/syscall.ph 
/usr/lib/perl/5.8.0/sys/syscall.ph 
/usr/lib/perl/5.8.0/syscall.ph 
Only the first has an interface definition for gettimeofday: grep __NR_gettimeofday /usr/lib/perl/5.8.0/bits/syscall.ph 
sub SYS_gettimeofday () { &amp;__NR_gettimeofday;} You can test for gettimeofday easily from the perl debugger: na:/home/eric$ perl -de 0 Loading DB routines from perl5db.pl version 1.19 Editor support available. 
Enter h or `h h' for help, or `man perldebug' for more help. 
main::(-e:1): 0 DB 1 use Time::HiRes qw/gettimeofday/; DB 2 p join (' | ', gettimeofday()) 1037743462 | 276463 or from a single command line: perl -e 'use Time::HiRes qw/gettimeofday/; print join (" | ", gettimeofday())."\n";' 
I'm curious, what operating system are you using? 
I've never seen a path like i586-linux-thread-multi on a redhat or debian linux box. 
I expect the XS modules, /usr/lib/perl/5.8.0/auto/Time/HiRes/HiRes.so on my machine, is referencing syscall.ph, 
though I don't actually know how. 
This appears to be deep perl voodoo. 
The above problem kept the W3CDebugCGI module from generating a session-id and logging the session.

Eric, Many thanks. 
I'm very grateful for your help! 
As I mentioned, I'm using SuSE 8.1. 
One day soon I will email SuSE to explain this problem with syscall. 
I did however manage to sort out perl. 
I ran "h2ph -h" on some of the .h 
files in /usr/include. 
It seemed that without the -h switch the .ph 
files (which SuSE had perviously generated and I had installed from the RPM) didn't work. 
I don't understand all this, but am reasonably happy I found a work-around. 
But my annotea server's not working yet :-( I am getting a new error message when I try to POST an annotation from amaya. 
The following appears in the httpd error_log file: Can't locate auto/W3C/Rdf/RdfDB/disconnect.al in @INC (@INC contains: .. ../../.. ../../.. /usr/lib/perl5/5.8.0/i586-linux-thread-multi /usr/lib/perl5/5.8.0 /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.0/i586-linux-thread-multi /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.0 /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl .) at /usr/local/perl/modules/W3C/Annotations/CGI/annotate line 213 [Wed Nov 20 10:27:22 2002] [error] [client 147.188.56.174] Premature end of script headers: /usr/local/perl/modules/W3C/Annotations/CGI/annotate I'll keep looking to see what is or isn't happening, but if you have any ideas or suggestions, I'd be very grateful! 
Thanks Richard PS. I have had some reports of emails sent to me a couple of days ago going mysteriously astray. 
This is a repeat post. 
If anyone did respond to the original, please repeat! 
Thanks
