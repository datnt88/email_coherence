Regarding EARL, there's been an activity at the National Institute of 
Standards and Technology (NIST) on developing an Industry USability 
Reporting (IUSR). 
There could be some interesting synergy between these 
activities. 
Currently, IUSR has an open comment period until Sept. 10 on 
a standards proposal through National Committee for Information Technology 
Standards (NCITS): Karl Hebenstreit, Jr. US General Services Administration Office of Governmentwide Policy Office of the Chief Information Officer 1800 F Street NW, Room G-12 Washington, DC 20405 E-mail: karl.hebenstreit@gsa.gov

Thanks for your message Al. Excellent points as always! 
I'm involved in some related work - statistics for measuring use of 
e-journals, in which you the publishers wish to agree on standards for 
filtering hits from robots, double clicks in a short period, etc. 
I've been looking for bodies involved in standardisation in this area. 
I've found two main bodies - the Advertising Community and the Auditing Community. 
Links to resources in this area are available at: The following seem to be the main standards bodies. 
However it can be 
difficult to tell just be looking at Web sites how authorative and 
international they are. 
ABCE's definitions IAB UK's definitions Definitions of advertising impressions and insertions JICWEBS (The Joint Industry Committee for Web Standards in the UK and Ireland) home page JICWEBS page on standards Website Audit Work of the International Federation Audit Bureaux of Circulations (IFABC)

Thanks Charles.? I was aware of the EARL work, and it has some relevance. 
However although it will allow you to make 
statements such 
as "The entry point is 50K which is within the x guidelines" in a machinereadable way, the meaning of the size of a page does not yet appear to be defined anywhere - i.e. does it mean the orgin of a redirect page, the destination, or the sum; what does it mean if user-agent content negotiation occurs; etc. 
AG:: Brian, This is an excellent issue. 
Just please put an arm's length between "the size of the entry transaction" and the phrase "the size of a page." 
What we need to define is "that to which the data volume standard applies." 
This is the size of the "enter the site transaction." 
Not any single management unit of retained data. 
The page notion is handy in the user appreciation of what they do and get, but generates confusion when we think we can bind it one-to-one onto something the service retains or does. 
Talking about "the size of a page" puts you unfortunately in static "format" view whereas for measuring network load you want to be in protocol or "transaction" view. 
The unit you want in the rule you mention is The total data communication which is automatically engendered when the user activates a hyperlink referencing "the home page" of "a site." 
That's almost right. 
First variation is to exclude time-delayed auto-refreshes. 
Second variation is to include back in time-delayed auto-refreshes of under [say, ten seconds] delay so that automatically passing through a splash page is counted as an automatic part of what you have to go through on entering the site. 
But these details should be handed as definitions first and standards second (later). 
What constitutes "a site" is up to the service offeror. 
We presume that there is a default starting URI for a given site and that is "the home page" for that site. 
The best commercial practice here is that this is something with an http: URL that is all DNS and no filepath. 
But our assessment vocuabulary should allow for the units of service, and home URI spelling, of the offeror's choice. 
Your rule will constrain the volume of network data transport service that the user has bought by one "explicit user action" event, in the idea-set of the UAAG. 
All the variations in the actual network utilization episode that you mention show that the actual data volume is a distribution of different values under various contingencies. 
But if there is an automatic redirect, the traffic for both GETs is clearly included. 
For negotiated alternatives, you have to pick your policy. 
There is no policy-free technical definition. 
In terms of surveys, standards-setting, and quality of service measurement, it is reasonable to use averages across the experienced distribution of hit-subcases as "what is constrained by the norm." 
Perhaps max limits as well. 
What you set norms for is there a policy matter, not a matter of common definitions that can serve a variety of policy decisions. 
The technical terms are the primitives that you use in defining what the norm applies to, not the bottom line you decide to constrain. 
I'm not sure who should be involved in this work.? 
Is it 
within scope 
of the WAI group?? 
If not, is there any work going on in, 
say, the Web 
auditing communities - I know there is some standarisation 
work going 
on in that community. 
Any standardisation work in Web auditing would be of interest to at least EO and ER. 
If you can provide pointers where we can follow up that would be super. 
This topic intersects with the scopes of at least ER, GL, and EO. GL is endeavoring to test the testability of their pronouncements before publishing them as guidance. 
"Don't make your home page too big" is a web content guideline, IMHO.

cheers Charles ?? Has anyone provided standard definitions for what constitutes a page, ?? and what action user-agent should take when such strange things happen? 
?? Are any auditing tools providing customisation over the actions 
they 
?? will take? 
?? Finally are any of the Web sites which provide such Web analysis ?? features looking at going down the "Web service" route, and providing ?? output in a machine understandable format - so that the results can be ?? more easily post-processed? 
FYI. We, at NIST, have been following the development of EARL and are going to 
try a couple of examples of the output of our WebSAT tool ( that does some 
usability checking) represented in EARL The Common Industry Format for 
Reporting on User Tests (from the IUSR project, another project in my group) is 
a format for report on testing that a usability engineer does with users, not 
for automated checking, so the format contains information such as the user 
demographics, the tasks, the metrics (such as time on task, and number of 
errors), the data collected about these metrics,etc. 
So, the CIF reports more 
on the process and data analysis from testing with users. 
You can read more 
about it at http://www.nist.gov/iusr and please feel free to email us for more 
info. on the CIF. 
I'm not sure what the synergy would be except that something 
analogous could be build to report on testing for accessibility, but to report 
on the output of automated tools testing, say 508, would be very different that 
anything in the CIF.

Great! 
EARL is not meant to be limited to expressing the results of automatic 
evaluations. 
Its ambitions extend to integrating the kind of information 
expressed in IUSR CIF as well. 
This doesn't mean that users sold on using 
IUSR 
would necessarily have to go back and learn EARL. 
But we might be after you for an 'authorized binding.' 
IUSR reads like something that usability engineers can relate to. 
But it would be more effective if that information can be freely joined with information from other sources. 
Check out Bob Grossman's droll assertion of "W's Law: the interest in data grows as the square of the number of columns you correlate." 
Alliance All-Hands PowerPoint Presentations http://fantasia.ncsa.uiuc.edu/media/2001Meeting 
http://fantasia.ncsa.uiuc. 
edu/media/2001Meeting/ IUSR implies a schema and this schema could be used to recast the information in an RDF binding of the EARL model. 
Depending on how formal you have been in defining the IUSR information space, it may be a relatively mechanical operation to get them interoperating. 
Or there may be structural primitives in 
the IUSR scenario that we forgot to cover in EARL. 
Which is what we need to 
know early in the process. 
One could use RDF Working Paper SIDL-WP-1999-0126 http://www-diglib.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/get/SIDL-WP-1999-0126 
http://www-d iglib.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/get/SIDL-WP-1999-0126 
or another logic-capable language Model-Based Mediation with Domain Maps http://www.sdsc.edu/~ludaesch/Paper/icde01.html http://www.sdsc.edu/~luda 
esch/Paper/icde01.html to create a cross-schema-mapping beteween the EARL core vocabulary and the IUSR 
information model; and just process IUSR reports interoperably with any other EARL-interfaced tool reports (both automated tools and tools used to capture 
reports from the results of interactive evaluations, as with the GMD standards work). 
There's a lot there for us to continue talking about. 
IUSR annexes in EARL, other cross-fertilizations. Al 
Al, Thanks. 
I will think about this some more. 
I am on vacation this coming week. 
I have forwarded this to my colleagues Emile Morse and Jean Scholtz who oare the other NIST staff involved in the CIF.
