<s> statements such  </s>
<s> as "The entry point is 50K which is within the x guidelines" in a machinereadable way, the meaning of the size of a page does not yet appear to be defined anywhere - i.e. does it mean the orgin of a redirect page, the destination, or the sum; what does it mean if user-agent content negotiation occurs; etc.  </s>
<s> AG:: Brian, This is an excellent issue.  </s>
<s> Just please put an arm's length between "the size of the entry transaction" and the phrase "the size of a page."  </s>
<s> What we need to define is "that to which the data volume standard applies."  </s>
<s> This is the size of the "enter the site transaction."  </s>
<s> Not any single management unit of retained data.  </s>
<s> The page notion is handy in the user appreciation of what they do and get, but generates confusion when we think we can bind it one-to-one onto something the service retains or does.  </s>
<s> Talking about "the size of a page" puts you unfortunately in static "format" view whereas for measuring network load you want to be in protocol or "transaction" view.  </s>
<s> The unit you want in the rule you mention is The total data communication which is automatically engendered when the user activates a hyperlink referencing "the home page" of "a site."  </s>
<s> That's almost right.  </s>
<s> First variation is to exclude time-delayed auto-refreshes.  </s>
<s> Second variation is to include back in time-delayed auto-refreshes of under [say, ten seconds] delay so that automatically passing through a splash page is counted as an automatic part of what you have to go through on entering the site.  </s>
<s> But these details should be handed as definitions first and standards second (later).  </s>
<s> What constitutes "a site" is up to the service offeror.  </s>
<s> We presume that there is a default starting URI for a given site and that is "the home page" for that site.  </s>
<s> The best commercial practice here is that this is something with an http: URL that is all DNS and no filepath.  </s>
<s> But our assessment vocuabulary should allow for the units of service, and home URI spelling, of the offeror's choice.  </s>
<s> Your rule will constrain the volume of network data transport service that the user has bought by one "explicit user action" event, in the idea-set of the UAAG.  </s>
<s> All the variations in the actual network utilization episode that you mention show that the actual data volume is a distribution of different values under various contingencies.  </s>
<s> But if there is an automatic redirect, the traffic for both GETs is clearly included.  </s>
<s> For negotiated alternatives, you have to pick your policy.  </s>
<s> There is no policy-free technical definition.  </s>
<s> In terms of surveys, standards-setting, and quality of service measurement, it is reasonable to use averages across the experienced distribution of hit-subcases as "what is constrained by the norm."  </s>
<s> Perhaps max limits as well.  </s>
<s> What you set norms for is there a policy matter, not a matter of common definitions that can serve a variety of policy decisions.  </s>
<s> The technical terms are the primitives that you use in defining what the norm applies to, not the bottom line you decide to constrain.  </s>
<s> I'm not sure who should be involved in this work.?  </s>
<s> Is it  </s>
<s> within scope  </s>
<s> of the WAI group??  </s>
<s> If not, is there any work going on in,  </s>

<s> If you can provide pointers where we can follow up that would be super.  </s>
<s> This topic intersects with the scopes of at least ER, GL, and EO. GL is endeavoring to test the testability of their pronouncements before publishing them as guidance.  </s>
<s> "Don't make your home page too big" is a web content guideline, IMHO.  </s>
