Any idea? 
OK, this seems due to the fact that your locale is set to es_ES, and a matching message file can not be found. 
As a quick fix, you can try copying src/org/w3c/tidy/TidyMessages.properties to TidyMessages_es_ES.properties somewhere in your CLASSPATH. 
I need to work out how to make it easy to handle locale-specific message files with JTidy. 
Any ideas, anyone?

I'll test this out as soon as I can but normally, the resource loader would look for TidyMessages_es_ES, then TidyMessages_es, then TidyMessages. 
So, we shouldn't need to change anything in JTidy. 
Juan, what release of the JDK are you running? 
Also, do you have Tidy.jar in your CLASSPATH?

This is handled with the java ResourceBundle mechanism which works just fine for me. 
Juan - I think I found the problem!! 
You specify in your -cp argument the r2 release of JTidy. 
This release inadvertently omitted the TidyMessages.properties file from Tidy.jar. 
This is why you couldn't find it. 
If you use the r3 release, this should be fixed.

Hi, 
name org/w3c/tidy/TidyMessages, locale es_ES at org.w3c.tidy.Report.

Actually, I did something else: I put TidyMessages.properties into the .jar. 
It didn't seem to be there in r2, and, once again, I couldn't download r3 properly. 
That way, I didn't have to figure out where to put it, and, right, I can't modify it, but I can always do a jar cvfu and update it with a fresh copy. 
Now, it runs perfectly.
