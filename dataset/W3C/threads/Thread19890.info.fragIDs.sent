<s> Dear sirs, I made a download of your excellent Amaya tool.  </s>
<s> I have a little problem: I can't correctly read the addresses in the Address text box since the textbox is not enough wide to contain the text.  </s>
<s> Same problem for the Title text box.  </s>
<s> Can I change the dimension of the characters or the Address/Title space?  </s>

<s> Hi,  </s>
<s> Windows usually uses a resource editor to build dialogs, one edit a dialog box in which one put textedit windows, static text area, etc.  </s>
<s> All of this is built according to a given font which is by default "small font".  </s>
<s> If you change the font this make a trouble in the dialog boxes of course.  </s>
<s> You can try to build dialogs in the source code without the resource editor, however, the problem remains.  </s>
<s> When you define a window, you have to give its heigth and width.  </s>
<s> unless you give a too big sizes, you will have the same problem.  </s>
<s> Conclusion, it is very diffuclt (probabely be impossible) to deal with such a problem on Windows.  </s>
<s> This is why, most of strings are hard coded in dialogs on Windows :-(.  </s>
<s> Would it be possible to have horizontal scrollbars on text fields long enough to need them?  </s>
<s> Given the statement: W3C's position is clear: All the protocols and languages we issue as Recommendations should meet or exceed established accessibility goals.  </s>
<s> In addition, we will actively encourage the development of Web software and content that is accessible to people with most disabilities.  </s>
<s> in the document: I think you should allow people to use large fonts if they need it.  </s>
<s> I don't program under Windows, but I know there has been a fair amount of activity by Microsoft in the accessibility area, so they may have resources you can tie into that would assist in this.  </s>
<s> One place to look would probably be: which seems to be the jumping off point for their info.  </s>
