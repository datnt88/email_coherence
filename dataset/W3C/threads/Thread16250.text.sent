The witness statements are now available at: I can't really express, in a public forum, as a representative of the HTML Writers Guild, what I think of Mr. Walter Olson's post which is full of "Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt" mixed in with broad generalities and blatant falsehoods in the service of scare tactics.

Replacing my cap...as serious professionals and business people, how do we best respond to these types of comments?

The worst thing you can do is give them credibility by responding. 
They will not listen and just further twist your words.

I saw her. 
I was not impressed. 
she made three arguments that I know of one of which there should be a digital ada? 
was quite strange. 
the rest are just plain not accurate. 
I liked her point about the lack of site useability but you should know that in an answer judy pointed out that the wcag provides info on how to make sites more useable as well as accessable.
