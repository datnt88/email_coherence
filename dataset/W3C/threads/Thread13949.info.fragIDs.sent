Comments on http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/WD-WAI-PAGEAUTH-0414 
In the suggestions for revision which follow, I have first quoted the existing text and then indicated the proposed change, preceded, for clarity, with "JW:". 
Abstract: "Tools that generate documents in HTML (authoring tools, file conversion packages or other products) should produce documents that follow these guidelines. 
JW: "Software that generates documents in HTML, including authoring tools, file conversion packages, data base applications etc., should produce markup that complies with these guidelines." 
Rating and Classification: "This strategy takes advantage of features being incorporated into tomorrow's browsers and assistive technologies (that incorporate Web Access Initiative [sic] recommendations." 
JW: ""This strategy takes advantage of features being incorporated into tomorrow's browsers and assistive technologies (that take advantage of emerging standards and Web Accessibility Initiative recommendations." 
Style and Structure: "Use style sheets rather than converting text to images." 
JW: Shouldn't this guideline be categorised as "required"? 
If text is represented as an image, it can not be read by assistive technologies. 
"Documents that use style sheets for presentation allow users to adjust the look of the document (e.g., larger print, color contrast, etc.) through personal style sheets or browser settings." 
JW: "Documents that use style sheets for presentation allow users to adjust the appearance of the text (e.g., larger print, color contrast, etc.) through personal style rules or browser settings." 
"Structural elements enforce consistency in documents and supply information to other tools (e.g., indexing tools, search engines, [...]" JW: Automatic translation software should be mentioned here. 
"To test if the text and background contrast is sufficient enough [sic] to be read [...]" JW: This is a tautology. 
It should say: "sufficient to be read". 
Section 2: "Each image should have alternative text that represents [...]" JW: "Each image should have a textual alternative that represents [...]" "Provide a longer description for graphics that present important information (especially charts, tables, and diagrams)." 
JW: Is it right to mention tables here? 
After all, a table is supposed to be represented by proper HTML markup, not as an in-line graphic. 
Undoubtedly, it is appropriate to include a summary of the table (for instance by means of the SUMMARY attribute), but this is not relevant to the present discussion of images. 
"The D-link links to a page or a phrase at the bottom of the page with a longer description of the graphic." 
JW: "The D-link links to a separate page or a phrase? 
[should this be "paragraph?"] at the bottom of the current document which gives a longer description of the image." 
"One final possibility is to create an alternative page that is accessible." 
JW: Since we are discouraging the use of alternative pages, this should not be mentioned here. 
It belongs in the "if all else fails" section only. 
Perhaps the discussion of "images used as links" and ASCII art should precede the detailed treatment of image maps. 
Those who are reading the document quickly may assume that the remainder of the section is concerned with image maps only, and could therefore miss the important guidelines at the end. 
Section 3: "More information is available through the Java Accessibility page at the Trace Center." 
JW: "More information is available from the references cited at the end of this section." 
Under "For more information", include a reference to the Trace Java accessibility page. 
"Note. 
More exploration is needed in this area. 
Please stay tuned." 
JW: Is this proviso still necessary? 
Section 4: "A text transcript of the video descriptions [sic] provides the same information as in recommendation 4.2, but in a text format." 
JW: This should read: "transcript of the video description". 
The phrase "but in a text format" does not convey much information and is implied by the term "text transcript". 
Perhaps a better explanation could be provided. 
Section 5: "This will be particularly useful for future speaking technologies that will read row and column labels for each cell." 
JW: "[...] that can read row and column labels [...]" "[...] are especially useful for non-visual users." 
JW: This should say: "non-visual readers". 
Section 6: Should the discussion of images used as links be moved into this section of the document? 
At least, it should be referred to explicitly, along with the existing reference to the guidelines concerning image maps. 
"For example, when associated with a link, it takes the user to the associated document." 
JW: "[...] it takes the user to the destination document." 
(this sentence needs further attention). 
Section 7: "Please refer to the example in the Central Reference Document." 
JW: Since the page authoring guidelines are intended to be relatively self- contained, this illustration should be given in the appendix, along with the examples of tables, ALT text, etc. Section 8: find and exploit synonyms for the word "associate". 
"Associate labels with their form controls. 
Labels can be associated explicitly using the "for" attribute of the LABEL element." 
JW: The second sentence should read: "This can be achieved using the "for" attribute of the LABEL element, as shown in the following example.". "The "for" attribute of the LABEL element allows explicit association." JW: This sentence is redundant and should be deleted. 
"Include default, place-holding characters in edit boxes and text areas." 
JW: The classification of this guideline, namely "interim" should precede this sentence instead of following it. 
The same suggestion holds in respect of the next guideline as well. 
Appendix: "The following example shows how to associate header information with the "headers" attribute." 
JW: "The following example shows how to associate data cells with their corresponding headers by means of the "headers" attribute defined in HTML 4.0." 
Edit the following sentence, as required, to avoid redundancy. 
"A speech synthesizer might render by speaking the following:" JW: "A speech synthesizer might render this table as follows:" "The following example associates the same header and data information as the previous example, but uses the "scope" attribute rather than "headers." 
JW: "The next example associates the same header and data cells as before, but this time uses the "scope" attribute rather than "headers"." 
"This example might be rendered by a speech synthesizer as the previous example." 
JW: "It should be noted that the spoken rendering of this table would be identical to that of the previous example; a choice between the HEADERS and SCOPE attributes is dependent on the complexity of the table and considerations of convenience for the author, but does not affect the output so long as the relationships between header and data cells are made clear in the markup." 
"Appendix B" JW: Either make this into a sub-heading of a single appendix, or rename the preceding section "Appendix A". 
At present, the latter is simply entitled "Appendix". 
If two or more appendices are to be created, then the references to "the appendix" in the body of the document need to be updated. 
"In general, authors should specify alternative text that describes the function of the graphic or image and not its visual appearance." 
JW: The purpose of the ALT text is not to "describe" the function of the graphic but to be a substitute which achieves the same function as the image. 
"[...] what would you say upon encountering this image or graphic to make the page comprehensible to the listener?" 
JW: The phrase "or graphic" in this sentence is redundant. 
"Note. 
Providing alternative text for images embedded with the OBJECT element is a different beast and will be covered in the future." 
JW: To the contrary, this topic should be briefly discussed now. 
The essential principles are the same as for long descriptions, except that the textual alternative will be displayed as an integral component of the document rather than as a link to a separate page. 
If the textual alternative is particularly long or inessential to the reader's comprehension of the document as a whole, the author may wish to emulate the LONGDESC attribute by including in the OBJECT element a link to a separate page containing a description of the image (an example could be provided here if necessary). 
Unordered lists: since CSS 2 allows audible cues to precede bulleted list items, the recommendation that ALT text such as "item" be included, should be marked as interim, and a note should be added mentioning audio style properties. 
Ordered lists: Since user agents are supposed to generate the item numbering automatically,, the inclusion of this information in ALT text is surely redundant and potentially confusing. 
A null ALT attribute should be used instead. 
The April 14th guidelines: Style and Structure: "Use style sheets rather than converting text to images." 
Jason White: Shouldn't this guideline be categorised as "required"? 
If text is represented as an image, it can not be read by assistive technologies. 
Nir Dagan: I think that it is not always required. 
For example if one uses a fancy image as a heading it may me markuped as: The above is accessible, but it would be better to forget about the image and use a stylesheet to create drop caps or whatever the author wants. 
Appendix B issues: Unordered lists: since CSS 2 allows audible cues to precede bulleted list items, the recommendation that ALT text such as "item" be included, should be marked as interim, and a note should be added mentioning audio style properties. 
Ordered lists: Since user agents are supposed to generate the item numbering automatically,, the inclusion of this information in ALT text is surely redundant and potentially confusing. 
A null ALT attribute should be used instead. 
Nir Dagan: I don't quite understand Jason's recommendations. 
There are three different combinations of markup/stylesheets. 
1. (the best way, an excellent implementation of the separate content from presentation HTML - CSS idea; discouraged by error in the guidelines) 1.1 markup unordered lists with UL and LI; graphical bullets inserted with stylesheet. 
1.2 Markup ordered lists with OL and LI; graphical numbers inserted with stylesheet. 
In this option _no special thing_ should be done for accessibility. 
The author _may_ use stylesheets for non visual media, but this has nothing to do whether he uses graphical bullets in the stylesheet for visual media. 
2. (the way everybody is doing now, this method altogether is interim / obsolete / discouraged) Create "fake" unordered / ordered list (e.g., by using a definition list with DL and DD). 
Insert graphical bullets/numbers with IMG. 
In this case alt text of unorederd lists bullets should be "Item:" or something of that nature. 
In the fake ordered lists it may be "item 1" , "Item 2" or just "1" "2" . 
3. (the absolutely wrong way; encouraged by error in the guidelines; modified by Jason White) Use UL/OL and LI and insert graphical bullets/numbers with IMG. 
This generats double bullets/numbers in visual media. 
(The page should be rendered correctly without stylesheets) Nobody is doing or should do that. 
This method should not be mentioned in the guidelines. 
There is no situation that should be in the guidelines in which the author inserts graphics of numbers with IMG and the appropriate alt is null. 
Regards, Nir Dagan. 
I appreciate Nir's well informed comments, and his qualifications to my suggestions for improving the guidelines. 
I was unaware that there was a tendency among certain authors to misuse definition lists, coupled with images, to create ordered lists.
