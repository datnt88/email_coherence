Hi Massimo, 
What we are trying to do at CMU (and in general with OWL-S) is to propose a way to add explicit semantic knowledge which can improve the languages and the tools that already exist. 
This is basically the reason why we got into the trouble of basing the DAML-S matchmaker on top of UDDI and why OWL-S is based on WSDL. 
As you mention above, and as it is explained in details in the research papers you mentioned before, you guys are taking the approach of building a front-end to UDDI, and do all the information mapping based on existing UDDI data structu res. 
In particular, you don't seem to introduce any explicit RDF or OWL informa tion in the repository. 
Did you find this front-end approach sufficient? 
Or do you think that additions to the existing UDDI data structures intended to directly support RDF/OWL info rmation would bring substantial benefits? 
Thank you, 
Ugo 
Re: UDDI and semantics: CMU OWL-S/UDDI MappingThat's exactly what I'm trying to find out! 
It is not a big deal to add RDF/OWL/XTM or any other semantic data to UDDI enti ties. 
The issue here is the search. 
It is unlikely that UDDI will provide any r easoning in the nearest future given the early stage of development of the sema ntic technologies. 
Cheers, Max

Ugo, 
Unfortunately, I do not have a good answer, and I will have to think about your question some more. 
We took UDDI as a done deal, and we tried to fit DAML-S into it, instead of redoing UDDI. 
Two places where some semantic annotation may help are the tModels and the category bag, which seem to be the main ways to retrieve information from the repository. 
For other objects it all depends on what questions UDDI users may want to ask. 
For example consider the binding, if the goal is just to save binding information and retrieve it then using OWL may not add anything, but if the goal is to be able to ask which web services use a binding compatible with HTTP constrained by some security parameters, then WLthere may be a case for O 
Max and Ugo, 
if I understand your question, you are asking for automated matching mechanisms so that for example, if a (program) requester asks UDDI for sellers of paper backs, then Amazon and Barnes and Noble and Borders and . 
others will be automatically matched and returned. 
And the answer is Yes, the CMU matchmaker does provide automated mechanisms for searching/matching.

It is not a big deal to add RDF/OWL/XTM or any other semantic data to UDDI entities.

It is unlikely that UDDI will provide any reasoning in the nearest future given the early stage of development of the semantic technologies.

Ooops, I sent the message to early, Anyway all I want to say is that depending on what the UDDI folks what to achieve OWL may help by adding a richer representation and the logic inference that comes with it. 
In general, I think that the search facilities and the functions that allow users to retrieve Web services would benefit from OWL.

Yes, but how would that work? 
Given that UDDI is not going to do reasoning, and given that it is already possible to register taxonomies (including OWL ontologies) to associate services with categories (including with the entities and the properties in an OWL ontology), and to find the services for a category or the categories for a service, what more is there? 
Or rather, what other benefit could there possibly be?
