<s> Hello, I started using AMAYA and find it very versatile.  </s>
<s> When I choose structure view in my document, I find that some lines appear in red.  </s>
<s> Does it mean that AMAYA considers these codes unacceptable?  </s>
<s> Those lines of code were entered by using notepad editor.  </s>
<s> One example is "bgsound".  </s>
<s> Can I continue to enter such codes?  </s>

<s> Hi, yes, it means that code is not valid.  </s>
<s> In the case of bgsound it is becuase there is no such element in HTML 4 - it is a private extension that is only recognised by some browsers.  </s>
<s> You can, of course, continue to enter such codes if you like, using a source editor, but your pages will not be valid HTML.  </s>

<s> Amaya is not a validator but when it finds out an invalid mark-up that it cannot interpret correctly it outputs a warning in the log file (see special/log file) and paints the corresponding markup in red in the structure view.  </s>
<s> For example bgsound is not a valid tag in HTML.  </s>
<s> So if you plan to distribute your documents outside your compagny, I suggest you to avoid this kind of tags.  </s>
<s> There is a validator at W3C that will list all HTML errors in your documents.  </s>
