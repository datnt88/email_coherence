<s> Well, sound track constraints are (like what is sufficiently artistic to merit ignoring accessibility considerations) subjective.  </s>
<s> The success criteria should be that the resulting soundtrack carries sufficient information to understand the content presented without visual cues.  </s>
<s> Techniques should be noted for squeezing enough into a very small space.  </s>
<s> But in some cases it simply won't be possible to make the content accessible by sound alone.  </s>
<s> This doesn't mean that content should pass the checkpoint by default, it means the content should fail the checkpoint by default (although we should look for all possible techniques to make the content accessible so it meets the fundamental success criterion: people can use it regardless of disability).  </s>
