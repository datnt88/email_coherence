<s> The WAI Evaluation and Repair Tools group is looking at developing a metadata language that describes the accessibility status of web pages, including information about pages as a whole (for example is it valid) and information about particular elements (for example does the alt text for an image make  </s>
<s> sense, does it need a long description, ...).  </s>
<s> This is likely to be in XML, and probably in RDF.  </s>
<s> Is there any interest in using a language like this in Amaya - either in generating the information, or in using it (for example to identify images that are missing an alternative and asking the author to supply one)?  </s>
<s> One possiblity is that it could be an interesting extension to the annotations work being done.  </s>

<s> So having identified that a particular one does, it is helpful if an editor can open the document, find the images where an alt attribute has been identified as being useful, and ask the author to confirm the rest... (this is one example of a large number of use cases.) cheers  </s>

<s> To me, such a language description would only be useful when created by a third party.  </s>

<s> [in response to David's "I can't see commercial sites spending any effort at all on creating descriptions of their site, especially as it goes against the principle that all marketing material must be in positive terms"] Although the above exchange took place on an Amaya list I thought I'd interject this into the mix of why the tools we craft (authoring/evaluation/indexing/+) are important and indirectly why our guidelines/protocols/languages/+ must highly prioritize the facility for enabling assertions about accessibility conformance, and the concommitant proliferation (that's ivory tower for "spread") of assertions about those assertions - meta-metadata.  </s>
<s> The most striking examples I've noticed of our incipient "Web of Trust" are eBay and Amazon.com.  </s>
<s> The mutual ratings amongst people posting to the former and the individuals' reviews of books with rather elaborately personalized bona fides on the latter are close to what can happen in the area under discussion The "show me the negatives" button that will inevitably call up another view of things will be extremely effective.  </s>
<s> In the DRM (Disability Rights Movement) there are manifold examples of the potential for this as proven by numerous recent incidents: 1) the "flagpole mom"; 2) the Oz Olympics Site access incident; 3) the Nike ad blunder; 4) the FDR-in-a-wheelchair statue incident; 5) Kyle Glozier's speech at the Democratic National Convention (expanding what each of those refers to is left as an exercise for the reader).  </s>
<s> When ("if" not a problem any more) digital signatures are routinely available without 1984-ish paranoia about their free public use, this list will grow exponentially.  </s>
<s> The ability to "index" (in the sense used by the Legion of Decency) has now become available to billions and their assertions are unhidable.  </s>
<s> Something as simple as my 15-year sig line even permeates unexpectedly to headlines and even legislation.  </s>
