In today's conference call it occured to me that both the A-Prompt and ALTifier project should be (jointly?) a part of the Authoring Tools Working Group since both modules should (if they become mature) prove of interest to the targets of that group. 
Perhaps somebody could bring this up to the Co-ordinating Group. 
Love. 
ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE I would be interested, but think we can wait for a while. 
Keep in mind that my ALTifier is a STUDY PROJECT, and that apart from the paper/report there has no coding been done so far. 
Let me first code the simple command-line tool suggested, put it on my site for download, and we will see.

We should share information and ideas but I don't think the two projects should be joined. 
I'm in constant contact with Jutta (chair of the Authoring Tools Guidelines Working Group) and have been letting her know about Michael's project. 
I agree with Michael that we should wait until he's farther along then have another look.
