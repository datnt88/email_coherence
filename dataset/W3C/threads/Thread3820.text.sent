There are a couple of issues with the libwww-perl 5.64 installed on v.w.o: ...and a new one, which is according to my tests fixed in 5.68 and later (see below and Perhaps we could consider upgrading to 5.70 or later, on :8001 first for a test period?

I note that wasabi, where my test instance resides, has been running 5.76-2 for a while without trouble. 
Do you think it is dangerous to just install the deb testing package and that we should carefully test on :8001 first? 
olivier I guess the upgrade should be pretty safe, and can be rolled back quickly if problems are found. 
I haven't tested the validator at all with 5.76, but checklink seems to be fine.
