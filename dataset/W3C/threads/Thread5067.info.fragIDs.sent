As decided during Cannes meeting, below is a draft message proposal to be 
sent by SWBPD WG to the standard body in charge of Topic Maps standard, 
namely ISO/IEC JTC1/SC34/WG3. 
See http://www.isotopicmaps.org for more information about this WG. 
The message is specific, but my view is that it could be used as a 'template' for dealing with other groups, organizations or communities, 
when we think their work is relevant to the SW, and would like to trigger a 
process of collaboration.

Gentlemen 
The new W3C Working Group 'Semantic Web Best Practices and Deployment' [1] 
has put Topic Maps on the list of (many) legacy and technologies that it 
would like to be made interoperable with the Semantic Web infrastructure and languages. 
For those technologies, the SWBPD WG purpose is to identify and promote best practices for interoperability. 
The intended process needs to involve participation of qualified experts, 
assuming organizations and communities of users have expressed interest in 
the Semantic Web initiative. 
Relevant preliminary work has been made in recent years in the TM 
community, including various proposals for TM-RDF mapping. 
But this work 
has never been endorsed by any of relevant standard organizations (W3C and 
ISO). 
This message is intended to trigger a process in this direction, provided 
you agree on : 
- A common declaration of interest in collaboration at the organizational 
level, respectively W3C SWBPD and ISO/IEC JTC1/SC34/WG3. 
( Consider this 
declaration is made from our side through the present message. 
) - Definition of a task force, including people proposed by ISO/IEC JTC1/SC34/WG3 as invited experts. 
This task force would have as first objective to deliver a Technical Note 
on best practices for TM-SW interoperability, endorsed by both W3C and ISO. 
We are looking forward for a positive feedback.

[1] http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/BestPractices/ Remarks: - A TM-RDF workshop mentioned by DanBri during Cannes meeting could it be used as a place to kick-off this process ? 
- The most relevant expert in RDF-TM interoperability is AFAIK Lars Marius

stylistically this is more formal than I would have made it, but that's no big deal ... 
I am not entirely comfortable with the word 'endorsed' used twice - I am not at all sure that any of our WG Notes constitute endorsement by the W3C. 
My understanding is that the Rec track process is for that. 
Suggest the following changes: 1) delete sentence 
But this work has never been endorsed by any of relevant standard 
organizations (W3C and ISO). 
(Or alternatively replace 'endorsed' by 'followed through') 
2) modify 
endorsed by both W3C and ISO. to 
potentially jointly published by both W3C and ISO.

Well, I'm also usually far less formal than that, but I thought that was the place for being formal, since it was a organization-to-organization communication. 
OK. Forgive the vocabulary flaws of the author : neither native english-speaker, nor background in legal vocabulary (just checked dictionary to figure that "endorse" had a stronger meaning than I thought) 
Agreed, but I would stick to the latter. 
Agreed again Bernard
