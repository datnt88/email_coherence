Hello! Amaya 7.2a states that http://gg57.s7.domainkunden.de/ which has a MIME type of "application/xhtml+xml" is not well-formed. 
The reason for this behaviour is that there's no document type declaration ("DOCTYPE") present in that document. 
I consider this a bug in Amaya. 
The error message is plain wrong, the document *is* well-formed. 
Furthermore, a document type declaration is only mandatory for "strictly conforming" XHTML documents. 
If a document doesn't contain entity references, it can easily be rendered without one. 
Mozilla e.g. renders that page properly.

We'll fix the problem as soon as possible.

Ir?ne Vatton INRIA Rh?ne-Alpes INRIA ZIRST e-mail: Irene.Vatton@inria.fr 655 avenue de l'Europe Hello Christoph, You are right, there is actually a bug with this document. 
This bug occurs for documents with no doctype declaration AND with a BOM character. 
It is now fixed in the CVS base and will be available in the next release (mid-April). 
Thanks for the report Laurent Carcone
