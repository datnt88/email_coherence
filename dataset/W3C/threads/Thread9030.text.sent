I've taken a first stab at a exc-c14n interop matrix [1]. 
If you can report interoperability with either of Merlin's examples, or better yet if someone creates a larger and more comprehensive test set, please send them to the list!

Ok, I've listed you on [1]. 
Both the input sets are a little on the anemic side right now. 
I'm hoping at some point we come with a clever test of the "#default" token that tests that properly, I'd also be interested in some performance estimations.
