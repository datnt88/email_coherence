<s> To be precise, the spec currently says REPORT is for obtaining "information" about a resource.  </s>
<s> I personally find the idea of a "parameterized property" a bit of a stretch, but might be willing to make that stretch except for the DTD problem I pointed out in an earlier message.  </s>
<s> So I'm currently in the "have a REPORT method" camp.  </s>

<s> What do others think?  </s>
<s> Actually, I think the requests are to add *no* new methods, not to reduce the number of methods.  </s>
<s> I don't think anyone has said that it helps them to add a smaller number of methods (i.e. if you're adding one, you can add an arbitrary number).  </s>
<s> Cheers, Geoff  </s>
<s> A good chance, I suppose, to clarify what I think: - PROPFIND should be used to ask for a list of properties on a resource, or a set of resources, including version-controlled resources or version resources.  </s>
<s> My last mail had a suggested syntax that does not break RFC2518.  </s>
<s> This involved adding only one XML element, very simple extension to PROPFIND.  </s>
<s> Additionally, the response will be entirely compatible with 2518, no different than an existing PROPFIND response.  </s>
<s> - If that means that CORE versioning servers do not have to support REPORT, so much the better.  </s>
<s> It will make it easy for simple servers to implement CORE.  </s>
<s> To this end, I suggest that CORE should not require REPORT support but instead require support of a simple version specification element in the PROPFIND request body.  </s>
<s> - REPORT is preferable, when EITHER the request information is not easily marshalled via PROPFIND, OR the response format cannot be a straight-forward listing of href and property sets (propfind response).  </s>
