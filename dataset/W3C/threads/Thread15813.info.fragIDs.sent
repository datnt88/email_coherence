<s> One year ago Kent State University repositioned its web-presence from academic computing to University Relations and Marketing and Communications (Media).  </s>
<s> When this was done they chose our office to build the "official" site (the portion of the site that provides a "front door" to the the WWW).  </s>
<s> One of the requirements for this was accessibility options.  </s>
<s> The foundation of Kent State University's site is textual information: News stories, biographical paraghraphs, bulletins, etc...  </s>
<s> With this in mind we designed the site with the textual content at the center.  </s>
<s> The second consideration was the layout of the site, our clients (University Communications and Marketing) stressed the importance of consistancy from page to page.  </s>
<s> It was also brought to our attention that a portion of the audience is "print impaired".  </s>
<s> I had never heard this term before.  </s>
<s> It was explained to me that "print impaired" refers to those readers who due to cerebal palsy or near-blindness cannot navigate textual information.  </s>
<s> While many print-impaired individuals can see the text on a page, it takes them much longer to read the layout of a page, and thus to change their mode of navigation- where the navigation tools are.  </s>
<s> Layout was extremely important.  </s>
<s> We designed the layout of the page so that links would always be in the same place, navigation toolbars the same and also consistant.  </s>
<s> This broke up the textual content mentioned earlier into two groups: link text and body text.  </s>
<s> The layout of the page was built using tables with server-side includes in cells, creating "templates" that can be easily swapped when a better or different layout was found to be appropriate.  </s>
<s> The third issue, which in fact had been in the plans from the beginning, was providing a seamless alternate site for those readers who wanted to browse the site without tables and images.  </s>
<s> It has been suggested that providing such alternate pages is in good form with accessibility guidelines gathered from validators like Bobby.  </s>
<s> However, many of these alternate pages require either that readers constantly switch back to a text only page after selecting alink on a text-only page that refers to a image/table page or that maintainters of a site reproduce all content in a text-only form with links changed to the text-only pages.  </s>
<s> With our "template" strategy, we found that it was easier to enable different "views" of the same information.  </s>
<s> The menubar (a cgi which changes its form depending on howit is called in the path information) allowed a mechanisim for transport between these views.  </s>
<s> We installed two servers, one on port 80 and one on port 81.  </s>
<s> The port 80 server (the default) is configured to pull up as its default homepages a file called index.shtml.  </s>
<s> The server on port 81 is configured to pull as default a file called tindex.shtml.  </s>
<s> index.shtml is the tables/image ssi template, the tindex.shtml is an ssi template with no images or tables.  </s>
<s> All urls in the link text are relative (the homepage is referred to as "/").  </s>
<s> The result is that content need only be edited in one place at one time, and a reader once shifting over to port 81 (the text site) remains on port 81 until they switch back over to port 80 (the tables/graphics site).  </s>
<s> So far we have had no problems, the site is accessible to text readers, provides a consistant layout for the visually-abled print impaired and is easy as pie to maintain.  </s>

<s> I really dislike the hard-coded carriage returns in the ALT attributes.  </s>
<s> You can never predict what will wrap and won't in a browser.  </s>
<s> Internet Explorer 4.01 has an option to make sure the entire ALT text is displayed, under the View Menu, Internet Options, Advanced, "Always Expand ALT text".  </s>
<s> Internet Explorer 3.x and 4.0 also supported this feature, but was programmatically turned on by the presence of a screen reader.  </s>
