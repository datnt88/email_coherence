<s> Roy, latest draft looks great, except for the following issues (all minor):  </s>
<s> Under no reasonable definition of the phrase "in common use" could the gopher URI fit.  </s>
<s> It should be removed.  </s>
<s> In Appendix D, please consider putting the names of rules in brackets , as recommended in RFC 2234, Section 2.1.  </s>
<s> There's not enough information to dereference [Siedzik].  </s>
<s> The symbolic  </s>
<s> name [UTF-8} should be changed to [RFC2279] for consistency.  </s>
<s> Also, please change ?rfc  </s>
<s> sortrefs="no"?  </s>
<s> to yes to make it easier to review the references.  </s>

<s> Thanks.  </s>
<s> It is pretty common in historical documents.  </s>
<s> ;-) Seriously, though, gopher is still in common use in Universities.  </s>
<s> I'd prefer to find a replacement example, such as imap or urn -- suggestions are welcome.  </s>
<s> I actually tried that while working on 03 and the result was butt-ugly and much harder to read.  </s>
<s> Unless there is a strong objection, I'd prefer to keep it clean.  </s>
<s> Hmm, I guess we should be consistent.  </s>
<s> Personally, I prefer symbolic names like UTF-8 except when we are referring to a specific RFC number.  </s>
<s> Unfortunately, the xml2rfc doesn't know much about non-RFC references.  </s>

<s> Makes sense to me.  </s>
<s> Try putting the URI into the target attribute of the reference element.  </s>
<s> That worked for me.  </s>
<s> Regards, Martin.  </s>
