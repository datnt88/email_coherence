<s> My comments interspersed:  </s>
<s> * Concerning color blindness, a technique that is missing is: Do not use images as text since users cannot override the colors (or size) of images.  </s>
<s> Use stylesheets to color your text.  </s>
<s> Color blind users may override all author's defined style-sheet genereted colors.  </s>
<s> (and low vision users will use the appropriete font size) * In B the technique: "...and bit-maptext with alt-text (for special text effects) may be used,.." contradicts what I said above.  </s>
<s> Images as text are a big pain.  </s>
<s> Look it up in WebTV's guide:  </s>
<s> CMcCN:: This seems a question of general principle - the tables for layout debate is the pointy end.  </s>
<s> The specific concern of the WebTV is that TV provides poor resolution.  </s>
<s> It should (as a UA) give access to the ALT stuff.  </s>
<s> In my view the use of bitmapped text with proper ALT is a hack, but I do not know if it produces any accessibility problems.  </s>
<s> (If WebTV doesn't give access to ALT text, then there is a problem.  </s>
<s> Mostly with WebTV, but we shoudl examine it) ND::  </s>
<s> * concerning the technique: "Avoid  </s>
<s> deprecated elements  and attributes... (TT ..."  </s>
<s> TT is not deprecated.  </s>
<s> CMcCN:: I noticed this last night.  </s>
<s> We should just remove the reference to it.  </s>
<s> ND::  </s>
<s> * the guideline "Enable keyboard operation of all page elements."  </s>
<s> This is quite confusing for me as an author.  </s>
<s> I do not know whether the user has a key board or not or how he navigates or operates anything, and I realy shouldn't care.  </s>
<s> It would be better to say "do not assume the user uses a GUI with a mouse.  </s>
<s> It is also more consistent with the details.  </s>
<s> (also WebTV's guide is anti-mouse and hates image maps, although TV is a graphical medium)  </s>
<s> CMcCN:: Somebody else thought this was not good enough.  </s>
<s> The basic principle is that any assistive technology can mimic keyboard events, so a page which is keyboard accessible is as good as it can get (from the point of view of guideline C - control device independence).  </s>
<s> I think it is better expressed in teh main Guideline.  </s>
<s> A large part of it is covered in section E, dealing with User Interfaces which are included in pages, and making applets (etc) accessible.  </s>
<s> It could still be cleaned up ND::  </s>
<s> * How do I use D-link with FRAME?  </s>
<s> CMcCN:: BODY A HREF="dframe1.htm" TITLE="description of this frame and its place in the universe" D /A ND::  </s>
<s> * the rationale for using meaningful link phrases applies to all users.  </s>
<s> Many users scan the page for links and have to slow down if the descriptions are "click here", "click there".  </s>
<s> This is not a particular problem of blind users.  </s>
<s> (actually 95% of the guidelines increae usability for all users) On the technique page: In the ASCII art bit. the STYLE element should not be inside a comment.  </s>
<s> Its content may.  </s>
<s> Concerning: "Ensure that pages are readable and usable without style sheets for browsers that do not support them or users who deactivate them.  </s>
<s> Since style sheets are a new phenomenon, older browsers will not support them and it will take a while for new browsers to support them in a standard way."  </s>
<s> The fact that stylesheets are a new phenomenon has nothing to do with why HTML documents shouldn't depent on them.  </s>
<s> Authors are not expected to write stylesheets for all media (also new media can emerge after a page is written), and users can override the author's stylesheet.  </s>
<s> Therefore pages should always work with the user's default.  </s>
<s> Concerning examples: There should be one form, not a table version and text version.  </s>
<s> I use the text version since I have to scroll horizontally to read the table one.  </s>
<s> The guidlines encourage to attempt to write one accessible version.  </s>
<s> CMcCN:: I pretty much agree with all that.  </s>
<s> An important guideline we should be including is do not write !important stylesheets, since any CSS1-compliant browser may not allow the user to override them ND::  </s>

<s> I still don't get the bit about using D-link with frames.  </s>
<s> One can't put anchors in the FRAMESET, and the FRAME element is empty.  </s>
<s> The idea is to describe the frames in the NOFRAMES section?  </s>
<s> If so, I don't like it.  </s>
<s> The NOFRAMES section hould "behave" like a normal page, as if the site has no frames.  </s>
