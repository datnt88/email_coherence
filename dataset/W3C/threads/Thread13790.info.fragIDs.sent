My comments interspersed: 
* Concerning color blindness, a technique that is missing is: Do not use images as text since users cannot override the colors (or size) of images. 
Use stylesheets to color your text. 
Color blind users may override all author's defined style-sheet genereted colors. 
(and low vision users will use the appropriete font size) * In B the technique: "...and bit-maptext with alt-text (for special text effects) may be used,.." contradicts what I said above. 
Images as text are a big pain. 
Look it up in WebTV's guide: 
CMcCN:: This seems a question of general principle - the tables for layout debate is the pointy end. 
The specific concern of the WebTV is that TV provides poor resolution. 
It should (as a UA) give access to the ALT stuff. 
In my view the use of bitmapped text with proper ALT is a hack, but I do not know if it produces any accessibility problems. 
(If WebTV doesn't give access to ALT text, then there is a problem. 
Mostly with WebTV, but we shoudl examine it) ND:: 
* concerning the technique: "Avoid 
deprecated elements  and attributes... (TT ..." 
TT is not deprecated. 
CMcCN:: I noticed this last night. 
We should just remove the reference to it. 
ND:: 
* the guideline "Enable keyboard operation of all page elements." 
This is quite confusing for me as an author. 
I do not know whether the user has a key board or not or how he navigates or operates anything, and I realy shouldn't care. 
It would be better to say "do not assume the user uses a GUI with a mouse. 
It is also more consistent with the details. 
(also WebTV's guide is anti-mouse and hates image maps, although TV is a graphical medium) 
CMcCN:: Somebody else thought this was not good enough. 
The basic principle is that any assistive technology can mimic keyboard events, so a page which is keyboard accessible is as good as it can get (from the point of view of guideline C - control device independence). 
I think it is better expressed in teh main Guideline. 
A large part of it is covered in section E, dealing with User Interfaces which are included in pages, and making applets (etc) accessible. 
It could still be cleaned up ND:: 
* How do I use D-link with FRAME? 
CMcCN:: BODY A HREF="dframe1.htm" TITLE="description of this frame and its place in the universe" D /A ND:: 
* the rationale for using meaningful link phrases applies to all users. 
Many users scan the page for links and have to slow down if the descriptions are "click here", "click there". 
This is not a particular problem of blind users. 
(actually 95% of the guidelines increae usability for all users) On the technique page: In the ASCII art bit. the STYLE element should not be inside a comment. 
Its content may. 
Concerning: "Ensure that pages are readable and usable without style sheets for browsers that do not support them or users who deactivate them. 
Since style sheets are a new phenomenon, older browsers will not support them and it will take a while for new browsers to support them in a standard way." 
The fact that stylesheets are a new phenomenon has nothing to do with why HTML documents shouldn't depent on them. 
Authors are not expected to write stylesheets for all media (also new media can emerge after a page is written), and users can override the author's stylesheet. 
Therefore pages should always work with the user's default. 
Concerning examples: There should be one form, not a table version and text version. 
I use the text version since I have to scroll horizontally to read the table one. 
The guidlines encourage to attempt to write one accessible version. 
CMcCN:: I pretty much agree with all that. 
An important guideline we should be including is do not write !important stylesheets, since any CSS1-compliant browser may not allow the user to override them ND::

I still don't get the bit about using D-link with frames. 
One can't put anchors in the FRAMESET, and the FRAME element is empty. 
The idea is to describe the frames in the NOFRAMES section? 
If so, I don't like it. 
The NOFRAMES section hould "behave" like a normal page, as if the site has no frames.
