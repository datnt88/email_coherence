A lot of the authoring tools automatically generate, for example, I and B in place of em and strong (MS FrontPage 98 generated the latter, but FP2000 has reverted to the former -- with no option to change or set it). 
It would be handy if there were a "replace-elements" option to obviate the need for Perl, XSL, or a text editor's search-and-replace function. 
Something like: replace-elements: i, em; b, strong PS. 
I suppose it would have to be attribute-aware, though. 
Given an XML input fragment of and a config file containing new-empty-tags: foo replace-elements: foo, zot the result fragment should come out as Would this be difficult to implement? 
/Jelks An interesting idea, although I guess I would prefer a slightly different syntax, e.g. replace-tags: i/em, b/strong using "tags" rather than elements for consistency with other property names and , for list item separators also for consistency with other properties. 
No. The only question would be how it interacts with the clean operations. 
My preference would be to do this separately before the clean operations are applied.

Yes, after "tidying" ("replace-tags" on ill-formed markup might be problematical :) and before "cleaning". 
The big question is ... would it be difficult to transform the attributes as well?
