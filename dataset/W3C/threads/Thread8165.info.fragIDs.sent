<s> Hello, The depth XML element is used throughout the examples in RFC2518 with a capital "i" (e.g. Infinity, page 36; 8.10.8.), but in the xml definition it is spelled with a small "i".  </s>
<s> What would be the preferred way for a server to deliver the infinite value within the XML document back?  </s>
<s> Best regards Juergen Pill  </s>
<s> I'd say the examples are wrong and need to be fixed (after checking current implementations).  </s>
<s> BTW: this is already on the open issues list as [1]: INFINITY_USE_IN_XML [1] http://www.webdav.org/wg/rfcdev/issues.htm  </s>
<s> Hi. Currently, RFC2518 says in 12.12.1 [1]: So individual properties are identified by "href" (which doesn't make sense in the general case).  </s>
<s> So (assuming that propertybehaviour/keepalive isn't dropped anyway), this will need to be changed to: where DAV:prop contains property elements.  </s>
