hi I've found out something strange: p, h1, h2{display:block;} changes the behavior of Amaya 6.0. 
without that line all elements are shown after each other. 
Shouldn't this line be part of the default-CSS? 
Next bug: body  p{} applies to body div p this p /p ... And the third problem is, that Amaya 6.0 fails the get the required width for the border of an h3{display:inline;}, if there are spaces in the h3 . 
Also it has the problem to apply a[href^="http"]{} (CSS3 Selector as it's already implemented in Mozilla and konqueror 3) to all a elements.

Yes, by default Amaya displays p, h1, h2 as blocks. 
Amaya 6.0 and the future Amaya 6.1 make some progresses in the implementation of CSS but they don't provide a full support of CSS2. 
This selector is still not interpreted by Amaya. 
This is due to a lack of manpower, so if you want to contribute that can help us. 
See current status of CSS implementation in Amaya at This is due to conflicts between default Amaya rules and the display:inline. 
We'll check how to improve the current implementation. 
Today Amaya does a strict comparison with attribute values.
