Hello, I use Annotea Via JavaScript and I cannot retrieve annotations previously created. 
This problem only occur when the URI is like ....servlet/page?_pageid=124&amp;_dad=portal30&amp;_schema=PORTAL30&amp;_mode=3&amp;_languag e=fr I have made many tests and it's alway the same result : When I use Annotea with well formed URI as www.domaine.top/dir/.../file.html 
it's Ok, and when a part of the URI contains any ? 
or ..jsp it's not. 
Is it quite normal ? 
Best regards. 
Denis Lemarchand. 
Hello Denis, I think that your problem is that you need to escape the URI you want to store in the server. 
Otherwise, the annotea server itself will interpret the special characters, such as ?, &amp; and so on. 
Have you tried using entities (&amp;amp;) or hex escaped characters (%xx) in the URL name? 
-jose escape() in javascript will do this.
