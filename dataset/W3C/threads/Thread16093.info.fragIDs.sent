<s> Yes, technically, the sound that is attached to the flag icon could be the sonification of the image.  </s>
<s> But this would be a triumph of technology over communication.  </s>
<s> In popular culture this image already has an associated sound.  </s>
<s> The sound for the image of a waving stars and stripes is that of Arthur Fiedler conducting the Boston Pops in Sousa's "Stars and Stripes Forever" on the Esplanade on the Fourth of July.  </s>
<s> For inclusion of the reading-impaired, it is important to honor the associations of sight, sound and text that already exist as cliches in the lexicon of popular culture.  </s>

<s> Of course you are right.  </s>
<s> The expanding possibilities are more important that one arguable example.  </s>
<s> I was impressed with the ability of first-time users to grasp simple shapes from their vOICe sonification when we played with this at CSUN.  </s>
<s> I wonder if there aren't also exciting, world-expanding possibilities to be explored for communication between people with different disabilities if a lexicographer were to catalog the multimedia cliches that are widely recognized today and hence already work as code because the cross-medium associations are present and consistent for many people.  </s>
<s> Thank you, Al.  </s>
<s> I agree that using existing associations is a good and attractive idea.  </s>
<s> I suppose that perhaps most US citizens would  </s>
<s> indeed have the association of the US flag with the particular piece of music that you mentioned, but in the rest of the world this may already be different.  </s>
<s> Still, maybe my example was not a very good one to make a point about generality.  </s>
<s> I sincerely sympathize with using intuitive associations wherever possible, but I think it will be very hard to always find associations that are culturally neutral and unambiguous.  </s>
<s> Associations are known to work quite well with limited image sets, such as the relatively small number of windows controls and event types in a computer GUI, but for arbitrary images I expect the scheme to break down for lack of suitable "multimedia cliches" in the envisioned lexicographer's catalog.  </s>
<s> This is why the attempt arose to define a completely general and unambiguous image sonification, being semantically neutral and amenable to automatic processing.  </s>
<s> Still, I admit it has its own share of disadvantages, particularly the interpretation burden on the user.  </s>
<s> Learning a new language is never easy, so it had better be a really powerful language to justify all the effort involved.  </s>
<s> Lots of open issues in this area.  </s>
<s> Partly just for fun, but the US flag image turned 90 degrees to the right sounds like (download the 88K .wav or the 16K MP3) The stripes that now run vertically sound as noise bursts, and the stars are now in the upper right (high-pitched on the right).  </s>
<s> With another 90 degree rotation to the right, the stars would end up in the lower right (low-pitched on the right), and the stripes would sound like tone bands again, because they run horizontally again.  </s>
<s> I wonder what the lexicographer would find, or what Sousa's "Stars and Stripes Forever" would sound like when turned 90 degrees to the right?  </s>
<s> And when turned another 90 degrees?  </s>

<s> For my vision, I see people sending visible links(icons) [via drag and drop, to images of their friends] to each other.  </s>
<s> The semantic understanding is not necessary, as there is an understanding that a friend's message has a context that is known and valuable.  </s>

<s> Actually the case of a national flag is relatively easy.  </s>
<s> The national anthem of each country is not only an associated sound within popular culture, it is a government-approved audio sign, a sonic icon equivalent of the flag.  </s>
<s> So an abbreviated version (a few notes maximum) should serve this purpose as well as anything.  </s>
<s> Even here, though, it wouldn't be easy to master the associations for 200 or so countries.  </s>
<s> Still, this wouldn't be that much different from learning the flags visually, I wouldn't think.  </s>
<s> Text giving the name of the country still necessary to solidify the association.  </s>
<s> These sonified images are certainly a strange experience for me (no vision since 1.5 years of age).  </s>
<s> Conceptually I would say it is like learning to read, learning that lines (or dots) on paper really can be associated with verbal sound.  </s>
<s> Another disadvantage of using natural sound, however, is that short sound clips (&amp; they would have to be short to be used efficiently) can be easily confused.  </s>
<s> To take a stupid example: a few crackles could be rain falling or bacon frying.  </s>
