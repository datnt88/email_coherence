This draft contains: xsl:copy-of select = expression copy-namespaces = "yes" | "no" validation = "strict" | "lax" | "preserve" | "strip" type = qname / In the previous draft the separator attribute was present. 
In generating a pipe separated list in XSLT with text method output, I found that attribute very useful. 
What alternative replaces it please? 
If none, what was the justification for its removal? 
Regards DaveP.

Hi Dave, Since you're using the text output method, and thus only interested in generating text nodes, the xsl:value-of element should give you what you want: In all other cases, you can use exactly the same code as you can in XSLT 1.0, namely: We removed the separator attribute from xsl:copy-of mainly because it doesn't play well with the fact that xsl:copy-of can now generate sequences of atomic values. 
Cheers, Jeni Jeni Tennison If you are producing text output, I would imagine that you could always use xsl:value-of, since you presumably don't want elements and attributes in the output. 
The xsl:value-of instructions retains its separator attribute. 
We removed the separator attribute from xsl:copy-of because with the new sequence construction semantics in XSLT, it became very complex to specify how many nodes were generated in the presence of the separator attribute. 
For example, produces a single text node, so people might also expect to produce a single text node. 
But then what would: produce? 
We also felt that users would be frustrated that they couldn't do things like: The use cases for introducing a text separator when copying nodes, as distinct from atomic values, seemed slim, so we took the facility out, purely to keep the spec simpler. 
Michael Kay Thanks Michael, Jeni.
