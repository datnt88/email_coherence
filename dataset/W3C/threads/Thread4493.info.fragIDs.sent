<s> Dear Priscilla, Thanks for your comments on the XPath 2.0 specification.  </s>
<s> The Query and XSLT working groups considered your comment and agreed that changes are required to the rules for function argument conversion in XPath 1.0 compatibility mode.  </s>
<s> We believe that the changes outlined below address the following two comments that you posted on this subject: The revised rules for function argument conversion in XPath 1.0 compatibility mode are as follows: If XPath 1.0 compatibility mode is true and the argument is not of the expected type, then the following conversions are applied sequentially to the argument value V: 1.  </s>
<s> If the expected type calls for a single item or optional single item (examples: xs:string, xs:string?, xdt:untypedAtomic, xdt:untypedAtomic?, node(), node()?, item(), item()?), then the value V is effectively replaced by V[1]. 2. If the expected type is xs:string or xs:string?, then the value V is effectively replaced by fn:string(V).  </s>
<s> 3. If the expected type is a (possibly optional) numeric type, then the value V is effectively replaced by fn:number(V).  </s>
<s> Please let us know whether you agree that these changes have resolved the issues you raised regarding XPath 1.0 compatibility mode.  </s>

<s> If you pass number() a sequence of multiple values, in XPath 1.0 Compatibility Mode, you would want only the first value to be used.  </s>
<s> Perhaps another bullet point should added to the list, saying: If the expected type is xdt:anyAtomicType or xdt:anyAtomicType?, then the given value V is effectively replaced by V[1].  </s>

<s> It's also worth pointing out section 2.5.3 which contains the statement: Similarly, in evaluating an expression, an implementation is not required to search for data whose only possible effect on the result would be to raise an error My reading of this statement is that when 1.0 compatibility mode is off, supplying a sequence of more than one item to a function that expects a singleton is an error that the implementation is not required to detect.  </s>
<s> For example, if you write string(//TITLE), the implementation is allowed to give you the string value of the first TITLE in the document, without searching the rest of the document to see if there are any more, as the only effect of this search on the result would be to raise an error.  </s>
<s> So the XPath 1.0 first-item rule is still there, albeit in a deprecated kind of way.  </s>
<s> I mention this because a number of people have expressed concerns about the performance implications of dropping the first-item rule.  </s>

<s> Hi Don, Thanks!  </s>
<s> Yes, that does address both of those comments.  </s>
