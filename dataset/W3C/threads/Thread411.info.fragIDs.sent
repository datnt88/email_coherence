<s> Problem: tidy inserts a blank character after the first character under some conditions.  </s>
<s> Minimal test document: text-one text-two The second paragraph is rendered as Note the blank after the first "t" of "text-two" Klaus Johannes Rusch KlausRusch@atmedia.net  </s>
<s> The same bug is present in JTidy: If any JTidy gurus (Gary?  </s>

<s> It's good to know that Andy left us with a faithful port of tidy!  </s>
<s> I have real reservations about "fixing" the JTidy code base and getting out of sync with Tidy.  </s>
<s> I think we should strive to keep the implementations as identical as possible in this core functionality.  </s>
<s> When Tidy is fixed, we will obviously reflect that change in JTidy.  </s>
<s> But I don't think it's a good idea to have local fixes all over the place.  </s>
<s> I felt badly about the last fix but it was causing a java exception and I annotated it clearly.  </s>
<s> We'll have to remove it or revisit it when Tidy is corrected.  </s>
<s> How do others feel?  </s>

<s> Hello,  </s>
<s> Yep! Now I know what the Wine team has to go through, trying to duplicate all the bugs ;) Seriously, I appreciate Andy's and Dave's work tremendously, and do think that the Java port should keep as faithful as possible to the original.  </s>
<s> I agree.  </s>
<s> I do think, however, that in cases where a trivial fix would be possible, we could try to offer it to Mr. Raggett just to make his job easier.  </s>
<s> If necessary, I can administer a separate CVS code fork (a branch, mergeable to the trunk) for JTidy versions that beat the original to bugfixes etc. Forks are not very productive though :(  </s>

<s> Does anyone know when this bug is likely to be fixed.  </s>
<s> I am currently working with JTidy...what a fantastic set of classes.  </s>
<s> I run into a similar problem with text within TD tags, for example can get rendered as Keep up the fantastic work Regards  </s>
<s> Ian Gratton.  </s>
<s> I seem to recall that a fix for this was checked in to the JTidy CVS recently.  </s>
<s> I'd be happy to test this if you'd supply the HTML that you're seeking to tidy together with the options that you used.  </s>
<s> Gary  </s>
<s> Greetings,  </s>
<s> With a lot of CVS activity lately, I think it might be a good idea to roll a new public release of JTidy.  </s>
<s> Or what do you think?  </s>
<s> I could try to make a release tonight, provided that my temp dialup connection is fast enough to allow working with a remote CVS server.  </s>

<s> Sami -- If you'd like, I could try to make the release as well, following your excellent instructions.  </s>
<s> If you want to have a try at it, please let me know and I'll hold off until I hear from you.  </s>
<s> Gary  </s>
<s> Cheers for that...thanks for you quick reply.  </s>
<s> I'll watch out for the new release....but until then I'll attempt to rebuild.  </s>
<s> Umm....glad it works for you...are you saying you ran the HTML file thru the last 04aug2000r5 release or against the new fixed code.  </s>
<s> Maybe is a combination of something else in our code...maybe something to do with our DOM navigation.  </s>
<s> Ian -- I ran my sample HTML through the current CVS build which contains post-r5 fixes.  </s>
<s> Unfortunately, I just tried running my same sample through 04aug2000r5 and I didn't get the problem there either.  </s>
<s> Can you send me the HTML you're using so that I can run it through both versions on my system and verify that this really is the fix that I was thinking of.  </s>

<s> Hi, This is regarding JTidy.  </s>
<s> Does Jtidy support Japanese Html documents.. that is when i give some doc which contains japanese characters, will Jtidy convert it as required.??  </s>
<s> If it doesn't what do I have to do to make it understand Japanese characters??  </s>
<s> I'm really not familiar with this portion of JTidy but it should mirror the support in Tidy itself.  </s>
<s> Perusing the documentation page, the "char-encoding: iso2022" configuration option looks like it may address this issue.  </s>
<s> You might try that and let us know the results.  </s>
<s> Perhaps someone more familiar with this than I am will jump in here.  </s>
