<s> Here is some proposed text regarding applicability of AU vs WCAG as discussed in yesterday's meeting.  </s>

<s> When a checkpoint within this document refers to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, only the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines that refer to content supported by the authoring tool must be applied by the authoring tool."  </s>
<s> Full stop here.  </s>

<s> i concur with ian's editorial enhancements to your statement, with the possible exception of his request that you change quote must be applied by unquote to quote apply to unquote... yet, since i can't quite articulate my opposition to his last suggestion, if the WG adopts his suggestion, so will i -- unless, of course, i can marshal my scattered thoughts on the subject into something coherent and convincing... gregory.  </s>

<s> The problem with this is that guidelines aren't the critical bit, checkpoints are, but in some cases they are not applicable.  </s>
<s> For example, a tool which has no editing view of a document, such as a one-pass converter, doesn't need to have a search feature in the editing view.  </s>
<s> I am thinking about it for a bit.  </s>
<s> The wording here seems cleaner than the big piece thatis currently in the definition, so if I can see how it works with applicability then I'll put it in for the draft which I plan to publish later tonight my time which means in the US morning (I missed a flight home last night and my day has been rather skewered by the opportunities that raised).  </s>
<s> Actually I think Ian's amendments are all good - I think the reservation might be about taking out must, but I thought about that and decided it was redundant, myself.  </s>
<s> So if I don't get to play on the swing, we can always ahve a go on the roundabout.  </s>
