Hi, Thought I'd bring the following two relevant articles to your attention: There's this one from the Independent last Monday... and the following from a new magazine called New Media Creative, which isn't online yet, but which I have been given permission to reproduce (most of) the text of in this forum (there were some pull out boxes giving examples that have been omitted...): I'd have posted the whole thing to the list only it seemed a bit long. 
I'd also have mentioned them both before but they both mention me and Betsie and I've got all English and embarrassed over it, hoping someone else would point them out. 
Only they haven't. 
There you go. 
Cheers etc., Wayne begin 600 winmail.dat

Well I did read it and it was a good plug for accessibility and you. 
As I wrote to Tamsin, it failed to mention LD, and the byline "The internet finally seems to be fulfilling its promise for the disabled" is optimistic to say the least. 
More like head in the sand.

I am oddly reminded of an old story as follows: An old woman was walking by the sea with her grandson. 
Suddenly, without warning, a huge wave engulfed the child and swept him out to sea. 
The woman was in some shock, as you can imagine, but she kept calm and immediately began praying. 
'Lord, Lord,' she prayed, 'I beg you, save the life of my grandson. 
Bring him back to me, Lord.' And she knelt there praying for some time. 
After a while, another huge wave came and deposited the boy, coughing and spluttering, but otherwise unharmed, back on the beach before her. 
'Lord, Lord,' prayed the woman. 
'He had a hat...' Wayne 
Wayne, I think you story would have been more illustrative of the problem if the last line said "Lord, lord," prayed the woman, "He had two legs".... Anne Anne L. Pemberton apembert@crosslink.net

thanks really its a case of the greater need against the ease of the task. 
I think it was the hat that came back.
