<s> Can someone please help me with the correct set of option settings to cause HTML-Tidy to retain certain entity encodings from input to output?  </s>
<s> Specifically, I can't find the settings to retain "&amp;mdash;" as "&amp;mdash;" and "&amp;ndash;" as "&amp;ndash;".  </s>
<s> So far, no matter my choices it converts "&amp;mdash;"  </s>
<s> and "ndash;" from the input to a hyphen or dash on the output.  </s>
<s> I've tried  </s>
<s> "ascii-chars" set to "no" along with various other combinations to no avail.  </s>
<s> Thanks  </s>

<s> char-encoding: ascii ascii-chars: no has always worked for me.  </s>

<s> Thanks for the feedback.  </s>
<s> Curious.  </s>
<s> I've tried those settings on two different Windows based PCs and using both the command line version and TidyUI.  </s>
<s> In all cases my "&amp;mdash;" on the input is replaced by a hyphen (or dash) on the output.  </s>
<s> Thanks, MJ  </s>
<s> If the page is online, please post the URL.  </s>
<s> Or you can email it to me otherwise.  </s>
<s> Hard to diagnose without the page itself.  </s>
<s> :) /Jelks  </s>
<s> Thanks Jelk,  </s>
<s> A page as simple as doesn't pass through without being changed to a hyphen.  </s>
<s> Maybe my config file will reveal something causing the problem.  </s>
<s> Here it is.  </s>
<s> char-encoding: ascii ascii-chars: no bare: yes break-before-br: yes clean: yes  </s>
<s> drop-empty-paras: no drop-proprietary-attributes: yes enclose-block-text: yes enclose-text: yes hide-endtags: no logical-emphasis: yes lower-literals: yes quote-marks: yes replace-color: yes show-body-only: no uppercase-attributes: yes uppercase-tags: yes word-2000: yes indent: auto indent-attributes: yes indent-spaces: 3 literal-attributes: no tab-size: 3 tidy-mark: yes wrap: 68 wrap-script-literals: yes Thanks, MJ  </s>
<s> Ah, there's your problem: you're setting "bare" to "yes".  </s>
<s> Change it to "no", or just remove the option since "no" is the default.  </s>
<s> I just remembered I got bitten by this a long time ago too.  </s>
<s> The quickref documentation should probably be updated to be more explicit.  </s>
<s> This is what it says now ... This option specifies if Tidy should strip Microsoft specific HTML from Word 2000 documents, and output spaces rather than non-breaking spaces where they exist in the input.  </s>
<s> ... which hardly indicates the possible "side effects".  </s>
<s> :) Anyway, I kept your entire config file as is -- except for commenting out the "bare: yes" -- and got the desired &amp;mdash; when I re-ran Tidy on it.  </s>
<s> /Jelks  </s>
<s> Jelks, That did it.  </s>
<s> Thank you very much.  </s>
