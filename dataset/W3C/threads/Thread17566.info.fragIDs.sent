Hello, In light of this email, I propose a guideline along the lines of: "Allow the user to supress rendering of blinking and flashing images and applets." 
This may be a subset of "control presentation", but it may deserve to be its own guideline.

Dear Mr. Jacobs, I have just read the WAI Accessibility Guidelines: Page Authoring page and I am very impressed. 
I think you and the rest of your team have done an excellent job. 
However, you failed to address the issue of people with seizure disorders. 
Many people with seizure disorders are adversely affected by rapidly flickering images. 
Often I have come upon animations, or even just blinking text, that immediately caused me to have auras. 
My seizure disorder is not severe so I have not had an actual seizure because of these, but people who are more sensitive could very easily have an episode. 
Some of the culprits are: fast changing GIF and JavaScript animations, blinking text which covers a large area, unstable marquees which "jump" slightly instead of moving smoothly across the screen. 
It seems to me that at the very least a warning should be given and an option whether to download the offending image/script. 
I highly encourage you to look into the issue of strobe effect and epilepsy. 
Sincerely, Mimi Cummins 
The UA cannot control what the applet or object does. 
I can write ActiveX controls and Java applets that do nearly whatever I want without the UA's knowledge or ability to control it. 
What about BLINK and MARQUEE ? 
Those are not W3C supported tags. 
I agree there be a recommendation that UA's should only display the first frame of an animated GIF if a option is set. 
This would also disable the blinking of BLINK and the scrolling of MARQUEE text. 
Although in the case of MARQUEE, there could be information loss. 
A better suggestion would be to ignore the MARQUEE tag and display the contents in-line.

I guess we have two groups of users: 1) those that do not tolerate any blinking/animation and 2) those that need to be able to control them, for instance so that the animation is shown only once (n times) if not explicitly activated by the user. 
The last group is basically everybody, because all too often the pages are difficult to read because the eyes continuously wander to the animation and lost the reading place on the text line. 
We can count on the designers/programmers to educate themselves and avoid these problems. 
However, it has at least two problems: there are always designers who don't know about these problems and the user interface for turning things off will be confusing as everybody is doing it in their own way. 
So, I think the user agent should provide a common interface for turning things totally off with alternative info for first group and showing animations only once (n times) for the second group and providing a animation control panel. 
In addition, the designers/programmers need to have at least an easy library routine to communicate the info with the user agent and provide some the control panel for starting and stopping the page animations. 
In IE, it seems that I can turn videos, sounds and animations off in multimedia options. 
So what is the difference in this case? 
Are these referring only to certain technology? 
Furthermore, if we would have guidelines that ask designers to provide info (in RDF?) of their Java Appletts, gif-animations etc. so that we know if they are animations or blinking text etc., shouldn't we in that case be able to turn the harmful ones off?

would it be possible to have a control in the UA that could be looked for by an applet? 
Yes, but then that user interface and communication with the external applet/object would have to be standardized across browsers. 
Better yet would be to make it platform specific, like Windows currently does with the Screen Reader and High Contrast flags. 
A "No Animation" flag would be very useful and might possibly be related to an exiting flag for the common controls called MinAnimate. 
Every object can query these flags and adjust themselves according. 
Here is a list of the accessibility flags that are currently in Windows: HighContrast - used to indicate that the user needs legible, contrasting text ScreenReader - used to indicate that a screen reader is currently in operation KeyboardPref - used to indicate that the user is keyboard-centric ShowSounds - used to indicate that visual cues be used for sounds and caption accompany media The problem of graphics and other eye-candy flashing on the screen is not limited to HTML, it's a problem that all applications. 
The solution should not be browser specific.
