Someone pointed out that the page had errors but after running thru tidy it was readable.... And of course error-tolerence is not a current priority for the Amaya project..... 
However, since tidy does a reasonable job of making many pages at least useable, could not a mechanism be placed in Amaya where an icon would run a function to pass the current file thru tidy to get a display ..... 
It would appear to user to be similar to REFRESH, but instead of a refetch it puts the page thru the fixer.... 
This would allow testers to immediately identify whether problem is Amaya or page designer's Admittedly one can download page and test with tidy or run over to validator.w3.org and submit url for check but a nice push icon and good display means its yet another authoring error ... and not Amaya This type of function would also appeal to surfer type who just wants to get to data without technical hassle... 
I think integration of tidy.exe would be win-win situation John Russell, VE3LL@RAC.CA Mystery readers may want to click on DOROTHYL Or perhaps just a utility that will run the current page through the W3C validator (pass the url of the current page to the validator and open the validator results page in a separate window, let's say)?

WL: I'll just leap in here and invite you to write and post the code for this to the "open software" section. 
Remember there are only a very few working on this rather huge project and: * EVERYTHING IS SIMPLE - NOTHING IS EASY! * Love. 
ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE [DJW:] Please no. 
One of the reasons for bad HTML is that browsers render it as users expect. 
tidy is designed to be used server side to take drafts, e.g. from broken authoring tools, and convert them into valid HTML. 
If everyone has tools that make bad HTML viewable, there is no incentive to serve good HTML in the first place, and every incentive to exploit every new, undocumented, browser feature. 
If you use Amaya as an editor, and its fixup of the page is unacceptable, it would seem reasonable to run something like tidy separately. 
However, why are you not authoring in Amaya in the first place? 
This is a sound argument against having tidy.exe embedded into the viewer. 
But I still contend that a separate button may be useful so that people may learn in practice what mess can be made with HTML :-) ciao, .mau.
