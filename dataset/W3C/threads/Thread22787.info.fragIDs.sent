<s> Some clarification please.  </s>
<s> In the DOM2 spec of December 10, 1999, section 1.2 describing the Attr interface [p.57] contains the following paragraph: "In XML, where the value of an attribute can contain entity references, the child nodes of the Attr node provide a representation in which entity references are not expanded.  </s>
<s> These child nodes may be either Text [p.66] or EntityReference [p.71] nodes.  </s>
<s> Because the attribute type may be unknown, there are no tokenized attribute values."  </s>
<s> I don't understand the meaning of the last sentence.  </s>
<s> Does it mean that attribute values MUST be atomic?  </s>
<s> Can anyone provide a clearer explanation and possibly illustrate the meaning with an example?  </s>
<s> Thanks in advance.  </s>
<s> S.  </s>
<s> We decided to add (and link for the paragraph) the following definition in the glossary: tokenized The description given to various information items (for example, attribute values of various types, but not including the StringType CDATA) after having been processed by the XML processor.  </s>
<s> The process includes stripping leading and trailing white space, and replacing multiple space characters by one.  </s>
<s> See the definition of tokenized type.  </s>
<s> Philippe  </s>
<s> I believe we've also rewritten the sentence to make it a bit clearer: Because the Core DOM is not aware of attribute types, it treats all attribute values as simple text strings, even if the DTD or Schema declares them as having a tokenized type.  </s>
