<s> hi, I solved the problem spacing using charencoding utf8 - somehow that worked.  </s>
<s> Now a lot of sites can be solved like that with tidy.  </s>
<s> But I recently discovered that pages that uses javascript and are uncommented can cause a problem since these can contain  - chars or similar interuptive characters that causes xhtml documents to not become well-formed.  </s>
<s> As a solution you would put a CDATA around it...and that would be enough to solve it...I saw some email commenting on this but I can't find it.  </s>

<s> Cheers for the notes on xml-spacing problem... I've got it under control using encoding...it seems to have done the trick.  </s>
<s> The problem with un-commented javascript seems to give another problem.  </s>
<s> I can insert a CDATA to get rid of it... So javascripts that are not commented out... !-- -- seems to give an error when I transform with xsl.  </s>
<s> This is due to scripts contain expression for comapring like ( , etc)...thus this causes xsl to misunderstand the xhtml since it does not become well formed .... ideally...this should be commented using CDATA.  </s>
<s> Any comments...cheers!!!!  </s>

<s> CDATA escaping is done in current code base for XHTML output.  </s>
<s> But Tidy has to know it is XHTML.  </s>
<s> Be sure either to use --output-xhtml yes or declare the XHTML namespace as the default in the html tag.  </s>
