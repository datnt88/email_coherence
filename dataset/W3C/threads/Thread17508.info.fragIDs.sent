<s> Concerning C1: User agents should offer the option of showing an image's *replacement text* as an alternative to showing an image's *description*.  </s>
<s> The former option is directed towards those who want a page's content while the latter is directed towards those who want a visual Web page described to them.  </s>
<s> The ALT attribute provides replacement text (not a description) while the TITLE attribute gives a title of the image--usually a brief description, but not necessarily a tool tip.  </s>
<s> I don't see why the NAME attribute (of A?) is mentioned since it really has nothing to do with the image.  </s>
<s> Is there any reason why we shouldn't just use the algorithm given in the HTML 4.0 Recommendation at http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/appendix/notes.html#h-B.9  </s>
<s> ?  </s>
<s> Concerning C2: If images are turned off, sound (or Java, etc.) may still be desired, so we shouldn't require UAs to use the innermost text of the OBJECT element.  </s>
<s> UAs should use the first supported alternative that is not an image.  </s>
<s> The alternative content of the OBJECT is not necessarily a description of the image.  </s>
<s> The alternative content is by definition a replacement for the image, which in many cases does not involve describing the image.  </s>
<s> For example, the content for an OBJECT that embeds a navigational image map is typically a list of links rather than a description of the image map.  </s>
<s> If there is no alternative content for the OBJECT element, then we have to assume that the author intends for the object to be purely decorative, so that the non-graphical user need not be aware of it.  </s>
<s> For those users who want visual Web pages described to them, UAs can substitute the TITLE of the OBJECT.  </s>
<s> With empty OBJECTs, the object's filename should not be displayed to the user who just wants the content--no OBJECT content means that there is no content.  </s>
<s> Concerning C3: The D-link should not be made available if the user only wants the content.  </s>
<s> We need to distinguish between users who want content and users who want a visual Web page described to them.  </s>
<s> There should be separate user options for each.  </s>
<s> Concerning E1: The draft suggests using the ALT attribute as alternative content for the APPLET element.  </s>
<s> Since APPLET allows a richer alternative as the content of the element, UAs should use the content of the APPLET element instead.  </s>
<s> If the content is empty, UAs should use the ALT attribute (which is redundant and shouldn't be used by authors).  </s>
