I have been asked some questions about the current accessibility efert being undertaken by America Online concerning its software. 
We have discussed this in detail and I am going to look up the record on this from both our and aol's perspective. 
Do we have anyone on our team or are we intouch with anyone who is testing the new software who can provide a tester's perspective for the benefit of implementation experience? 
Can someone comment on the state of conformance with our guidelines of the current software? 
As I am not an aol subscriber and cannot be for various reasons, I am seeking answers in the best place to seek them. 
Thanks.

David, We have had some contact with the AOL people. 
But to my knowledge we don't have active participation in the working group from AOL right now. 
I am also not aware of anyone in the working group who has been testing their new interface.

aloha, david - i have not only been contacted by AOL to beta test 7.0, but to recruit members of VICUG NYC to participate (although given the events of this week, i doubt that anyone has had the time, energy, or inclination to respond to the solicitation) - so far, i have not received any of the beta software, but that may be due to the suspension of air-traffic.
