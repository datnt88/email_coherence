<s> I have been asked some questions about the current accessibility efert being undertaken by America Online concerning its software.  </s>
<s> We have discussed this in detail and I am going to look up the record on this from both our and aol's perspective.  </s>
<s> Do we have anyone on our team or are we intouch with anyone who is testing the new software who can provide a tester's perspective for the benefit of implementation experience?  </s>
<s> Can someone comment on the state of conformance with our guidelines of the current software?  </s>
<s> As I am not an aol subscriber and cannot be for various reasons, I am seeking answers in the best place to seek them.  </s>
<s> Thanks.  </s>

<s> David, We have had some contact with the AOL people.  </s>
<s> But to my knowledge we don't have active participation in the working group from AOL right now.  </s>

<s> aloha, david - i have not only been contacted by AOL to beta test 7.0, but to recruit members of VICUG NYC to participate (although given the events of this week, i doubt that anyone has had the time, energy, or inclination to respond to the solicitation) - so far, i have not received any of the beta software, but that may be due to the suspension of air-traffic.  </s>
