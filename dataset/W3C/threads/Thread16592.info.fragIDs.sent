This will not work for many Lynx users, as they believe that they are already discriminated against by sites that customise contents, and therefore fake the User-Agent header to look like a big 2 GUI browser. 
(Even IE's User-Agent claims that it is Netscape and corrects it in a comment because it suffered discrimination in the early days!) Some of this is misunderstanding of badly worded noframes content, but I think there is a real problem as well. 
What tends to happen is that one gets: - a response based on out of date browsercap information that underestimates Lynx's capabilities - Lynx can handle cookies, but many browsercap files say otherwise; - deletion of problem features from the site, rather than real alternatives (Lynx users would rather have a table badly formatted than no table at all); - outright refusal with please upgrade type messages; - keyword stuffing pages for search engines! 
And the ASP code he wrote once and then copy and pasted it for the other pages changes the content variable to point to the proper file. 
It worked quite well as far as I could see (on lynx, NS, and IE). 
I'd give you the 
I'm not clear what is being said here, but one needs to ensure that static pages remain static. 
In theory one could generate a Vary header for User-Agent, to tell caches that a page could be cached, but only served to a particular user agent, but current caches don't handle Vary - my guess is that only the non-commercial caches will implement it initially, because the concept is probably too difficult for most commercial content authors, and commercial caches only need to work with real life sites. 
The most fundamental problem, though, is that one cannot convince commercial sites to create sensible alt text, which requires even less work.

Just as there are times when the 
I don't think that anyone is objecting to their use where appropriate, and as far as I can see they are almost never used appropriately on commercial web sites (the object of most advertising is actually not to convey information - real information often puts buyers off or reduces the differentiation from other products - there are exceptions, but they are rare). 
This thread started on the question of the use of word art, and text as graphics to control layout and font, and that's a very long way from the use of graphics for explanation. 
content of a page will be textual, there are times when the content is graphical or multi-media .. and most frequently the content is best presented for the widest disabled audience when both text and graphics/multi-media are used to aid comprehension and usefulness. 
I don't think the guidelines say anything against this, and I'd say it was also true of a general audience. 
For example, I was curious about the hand signals used to guide a helicopter in to land, and found a web site that gives them. 
It uses both text and graphics. 
I don't think that either would be completely adequate without the other, although a blind person (but you need sight to guide one in!) could probably have succeeded with the text more than a non-reader could have coped with just the graphics. 
A movie with voice over would have worked better, but would have made load time impossibly long (the page takes a long time as it is) and it probably wouldn't have heen done at all because the production cost for animation would be much more than rough drawings and text. 
The objections are to the use of word art when plain text would carry the same information, and to the use of large quantities of multimedia for atmosphere, when that multimedia, more often than not, fails because of bandwidth constraints. 
It's getting close to commercial Christmas, and 
some people are actually intensely irritated by "Have yourself a merry merry Christmas" playing in every store; the graphics in commercial web sites normally serve the same purpose as this sort of Muzak. 
Incidently, the different presentations of an icon, for example, the printer icon to indicate something can be sent to a printer, is VERY easy for young children to negotiate as I learned last year working with K-2nd graders (age 5 to 8) when we had an old slow printer for the lab that would 
Young children, at least of normal intelligence, are programmed to learn language at that sort of age, and basically they are learning something rather similar to written** Chinese, but with a rather limited vocabulary and simple grammar (real Chinese actually tends to pair simple words to 
identify concepts)++. 
Interestingly, the normal response of adults from non-CJK language environments is to assume that icons rather than alphabetic characters are impossibly difficult to learn. 
I don't think I'm average, but, in my late thirties, I toured Japan and learnt quite a few characters from the contexts in which they were used (e.g. entry and exit) rather than through formal learning of the language. 
These characters are highly abstracted from their original icons, but, whilst they vary in style, there are actually fundamental features about the arrangements of the strokes that make all the forms similar at a deep level, to the extent that what I copied down from the displays in the front of restaurants were recognizable, even though I had no training in drawing the characters. 
However, none of this helps someone whose not prepared/able to learn how to make a call on a mobile phone. 
jam up everytime a graphic was sent to it. 
Children with computers at home recognized the printer icon and used it ... it caused such a problem 
A printer icon is one of the icons that is fairly well standardised, floppy disk for save and a folder for open are probably the other two. 
(Acrobat uses the normal audio equipment icons, which are probably also well known.) 
The problems come when you go outside the basic range, or when the product is aimed at a mass (which in this case normally means youth) market. 
In the former case, designers basically play word games to try and make an association between an icon that is drawable and the function, and those word games are often based on some theme for the whole product user interface, that may not apply to other products. 
In the latter case, the tendency is to stylise everything to the extreme, to try and make it look as little like a computer as possible. 
People like Microsoft and Apple do try to create user interface guidelines to ensure consistency, but designers have a mental conflict between consistency and looking different from the competition (which may even be a previous release of the same product (e.g. Windows 3.1 relative to Windows 95). 
getting the kids' work out, that the county techie brought us a new, faster printer that can handle the graphics output --- why? 
Because it's an essential part of learning at this age, and for some disabled folks, an essential part of comprehension at any age. 
Used appropriately yes; the objection is not to that but to use where it is of no benefit to the user. 
The latter seems to be a much more attractive 
use for commercial designers than the former. 
All that the accessibility 
guidelines ask for in the case of appropriate use is a parallel text version. 
** an interesting question is what is the basis on which humans find it so easy to learn to read when mass literacy is actually only very recent in our history. 
++ I think that technology has moved on from the origins of these common icons to the extent that they are recognized by their abstract shape, rather than because of their resemblance to the real thing, so they are like the abstracted characters in Chinese in that respect. 
Anne! 
in your message, you state in part: "a person can always leave a site if they don't like it". 
This could be turned around as well. 
one of the problems we have with heavy graphics as you proppose is that they are load heavy and the books on good web building practices all notably frown on this. 
Perhaps one or two don't but I can't read them because they are loaded with pictures. 
It does not matter that you put alt tages in word iconics, if people are sharing the pc and a person who needs text does not have it because the alternate in this case is the graphic, than there is no access. 
Further, it was stated that the problem with most sites that are using them is that they don't standardize. 
it is true as has been stated here before that software uses standard iconics. 
This is good and was said to be so. 
I fail to see though how a person will cope who approaches things from a purely graphical or iconic point of view when the pc crashes and the only route to recover is through textual means is is often the case.

According to a friend in marketing, the purpose of advertising is to convey information. 
According to him, there is enough return from web adversiting to keep it a strong option for those trying to build business on the web. 
For a site whose purpose is to convey this information neither download time nor production cost are important. 
Presenting the information is. 
Fails? fails what? 
Such sites are very popular, and more come online every day! 
It's getting close to commercial Christmas, and 
Some people are irritated by muzak in the stores, others prefer it to the more irritating noises of a store without a sound system. 
The fact that some people don't like music shouldn't lead to the conclusion that music is bad is mis-used. 
Same with graphics. 
Curmudgeonry shouldn't be an issue in deciding what is "accessible" and what isn't. 
I fail to see any reason not to use word art if the words it contains are put in an alt tag. 
That seems an odd statement when you consider that commercial software typically includes icons for fast use of the commands, and that many people use these icons regularly. 
If adults found icons "impossibly difficult to learn", they wouldn't have evolved from the word commands that were used before GUI came about. 
In the training software we are using for Office software with teachers, the training starts with use of the icons before going into the features available only with the menus. 
I'm not sure why it is supposed to. 
I cannot see any merit in using a cell phone for education. 
On the other hand, the graphics and multi-media that a cell phone can't handle are the very features that make a site educationally useful. 
I'm sure that your judgement of what is "no benefit to the users" and mine would point to different features. 
Does that mean we should make the choices for others? 
The purpose of the guidelines isn't to decide what people can and cannot have on the web, but the allow them to choose how to receive the information (etc.) that is provided. 
It really doesn't matter if one person gets the text as a recognizable trademark and another the alt tag, if everyone gets what they need/want/prefer. 
All that the accessibility 
Then why the problem over word art. 
If the alt tag is there, it seems there is no issue. 
Whether or not it is "appropriate use" is decided by the user. 
The user can always leave a page if it isn't to their liking!

Anne: 
I've been reading with interest your posts over the past few months. 
On more than one occasion, I've been tempted to reply, but have been loath to add to the fray. 
The above comment, however, begs for a rebuttal. 
The list to which you've been posting is a list concerning accessibility on the Web. 
Yet, to my mind, you seem more interested in promoting graphics and multimedia, accessibility be damned. 
How else can you explain your disdain 
for slow Internet connections? 
This is a form of economic discrimination. 
I can sit at home with my 1Mb SDSL connection and download multimedia all day, but my less fortunate neighbor with his 28k modem and dial-up connection has to go to the library and wait an hour in line so he can get 15 minutes on-line? 
Why? 
So web sites can screech and roar while graphics swirl? 
I build web sites for a living. 
My experience is that fancy, high-tech graphics have a lot more to do with the designer's ego (or with marketing's desire to manipulate) than with usability. 
And all of the research I've seen seems to back that experience up. 
While I agree that careful use of graphics and multimedia can enhance the ability of a site to convey information, let's be honest: that is by far the exception. 
The rule is that such "enhancements" most often detract from the usability of the site. 
When cable TV first arrived in the mid-1970's, we were promised "one hundred channels of commercial-free content." 
Have you watched TV lately? 
I don't have one, but I've seen my sister's satellite TV: 100+ channels of crap. 
Many of those channels are nothing more than 24-hour "infomercials." 
But boy, the special effects are great! 
Over the past 50 years, the state-of-the-art in audio-video has advanced in orders of magnitude. 
Have all these great special effects resulted in better TV? Better radio? 
Better movies? 
Hell, better magazines? 
For just one example, compare today's "infotainment" news shows to the kind of news Walter Cronkite reported during the Vietnam war. 
This is advancement? 
I remember black-and-white documentaries from the 60's that provided more information in the first ten minutes than most current efforts manage in two hours of color special effects! 
As I see it, the Web is rapidly becoming nothing more than interactive-TV, and as with TV, the medium is being deliberately dumbed-down for the sake of marketing. 
In ten years--mark my words--the Web will be the same vapid wasteland that TV is today. 
Probably sooner. 
So when you say "Fails? 
Fails, what?" 
I say "Read what he said." 
Multimedia "more often than not" fails because FAILS: because it doesn't download, because it can't be viewed or heard, because it plain doesn't work. 
What on earth does the popularity of heavy graphics sites have to do with it? 
With whom, exactly, are these sites popular? 
Certainly not with those limited to 28k modems and dial-up connections, which includes a great many people in rural areas both in the U.S. and elsewhere. 
And are these sites popular because of the multimedia content or in spite of it? 
Given two sites equal in all respects except that one uses "word art when plain text would carry the same information" and "large quantities of multimedia for atmosphere," can you provide any evidence to show that the slower-to-download, multi-media heavy site would be more popular? 
Have you any examples at all? 
I think that your arguments have more to do with ideology than with accessibility. 
And I think that your ideology is a market ideology: To wit, the only people who count are those with buying-power. 
After all, who has the high-bandwidth connections? 
Certainly not the poor. 
So, hey, let's build lots of multimedia-heavy sites, and when told that the poor are starving for bandwidth we'll reply, "Let them watch TV!" I think somewhat differently. 
I think that special effects, graphic design, and multimedia are most often used as a crutch, or perhaps more accurately, as smoke and mirrors. 
They are used to distract us, to prevent us from realizing that the site/show/movie we are viewing really has nothing of value to say. 
That's a great benefit when your goal is to sell people more junk they don't really want or need, but it is terribly harmful when your goal is to educate or to build community: It is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing. 
Fool that I am, I want to use the Web to undo some of the damage wrought by television, not to exacerbate it. 
Forgive me if I've misread your intentions, but after rereading your posts, I'm pretty sure I haven't. 
Here's my view: Multimedia should be: 1. 
The last resort, not the first; 2. Used only if it enhances communication; 3. Used only if the information conveyed is available to all. 
If that means duplicating the information, so be it. 
And if it's too expensive to do it accessibly, then it's to expensive to do it at all. 
Furthermore, when multimedia is used, it should be optimized to the greatest extent possible to provide the most bang for the byte. 
On a games site where nothing of importance is conveyed, bandwidth-intensive multimedia might be fine, but on a news site or any other site containing important information, it should be used only when it meets the above criteria. 
I'm all for high-bandwidth. 
I think that the governments of the world should subsidize high-bandwidth connections for the poor of every nation. 
But then I also think that we should feed them, clothe them, and provide them with medical care, shelter, and education, so perhaps I'm unrealistic. 
I'm also for a constitutional amendment (and the equivalent in other nations) guaranteeing equal access to all, both on and off line. 
Maybe I'm just plain crazy. 
Crazy or not, I'm smart enough to know that none of the above are likely to happen anytime soon. 
Until they do, I favor lean, clean, aesthetically-pleasing, content- and information-packed, user-friendly, non-commercial, accessible-to-all sites free of gratuitous special effects and graphic-design-for-the-designer's-sake. 
Just my two cents. 
Pardon my interruption. 
Please continue with your conversation. 
Sincerely, Charles F. Munat, Seattle, Washington

Charles, if you have been reading my posts for a while, you should have noticed that my interest in accessibility is for the web to be accessible to all people with disabilities including those who depend on graphics and multi-media to make the web usable. 
Mostly, I participate in the w3c-gl list, but since I started on the w3c-ig list with my quest, I return here from time to time to help one or another person here understand that accessibility must include and direct graphics and multimedia because they are essential to folks with learning, reading, and cognitive disabilities. 
I am working with a broader definition of what accessibility means, and who it can help. 
For many years I was a teacher to learning disabled and cognitively disabled teenagers. 
The internet was useful in providing e-mail which enabled some students to build their skills so they could join their classmates in regular classes. 
But as a source of informtion, the Internet was useless then, and still often is, when graphics and multi-media are avoided. 
Currently, I am a teacher at a school for k-2nd graders and my mission is to find uses of the internet for instruction to these children. 
To be useful at all, a web site must, as a minimum, have some graphics to convey the information, and multi-media presentations are even better. 
Most text on pages is useless with these children, since it must be read to them, and often, regurgitated for their understanding. 
I am not "against" accessibility, but am interested in expanding accessibility to include those who are flummoxed by pages without graphics, who depend on the multi-media constantly under development, to make the web happen for them. 
Worrying about bandwidth and download time aren't accessibility issues, and when they are mentioned as such, they are divisive in the overall goal of accessibility. 
As to the web pages that you say reflect the "ego" of the designer, I'd suggest you look further and find out who the designer is designing for. 
You may be throwing out the baby with the bath water. 
Anne PS: To constantly belittle those who design in multi-media and graphics is never going to get this group anywhere close to acceptance by those very people you are supposed to be addressing.

And that's exactly how commercial sites discriminate against classes of user, they simply make it unrealistically difficult for those users to access the site. 
If such users have little commercial muscle, they will find all sites blocked the same way. 
I'm not going to go over the other points as I don't think anything I say on this round will significantly change anyone's position. 
no anne, in terms of equipment and useability, it is the commercial sites that should be conveying info in order to help purchasers make good buying decisions that lack friendliness here. 
for instance: will show you how with pictures to build the furnature but they do not anywhere describe it so that a person who cannot take advantage of the glitsy graphics can know what they are getting.

The problem for many disabled users isn't the commercial sites, but the information sites that are too often all text with no illustrating graphics of any kind and the reading level of the text is too high for the averagely educated individual. 
Government sites, and sites to exchange information on 
disability "rights" are the worst! 
Is it OK for a cognitively disabled users to be turned aside by the IRS site (as an example), but not alright for a blind user to have to use alt-text? 
Seems to me it's time for users whose basic needs are met to step aside and let unserved users fill their plate.

"I return here from time to time to help one or another person here understand that accessibility must include and direct graphics and multimedia because they are essential to folks with learning, reading, and cognitive disabilities. 
I am working with a broader definition of what accessibility means, and who it can help." 
Perhaps I'm missing something here, but I do not see how restricting access for those with low-bandwidth connections or older technology constitutes "a broader definition of what accessibility means." 
And while I commend you for trying to help the rest of us on this list to understand the importance of graphics, I'm not sure to whom you are referring. 
Is there anyone on this list who thinks that a text-only site is better than a site with graphics? 
I think not. 
What many here have argued is that the graphics should not be gratuitous, and more specifically, that text should be text and not text-in-graphics. 
How exactly does making a picture of text enhance its accessibility? 
Most of the sites I've seen that use Flash or Shockwave or Java to "enhance" the user's experience use it for marketing purposes. 
What does this have to do with learning, reading, or cognitive disabilities? 
And while I'm sure that pictures can help, I have grave doubts about how helpful multimedia is. 
When I was a child, multimedia was called "filmstrips." 
For the most part we listened to the teacher, read, looked at pictures, and discussed. 
And we did homework. 
Today's kids have far more technology at their fingertips. 
But are they any smarter? 
Have you read the studies? 
Television is a prime example of "multimedia." 
Certainly, television has the capability to help us to better understand our world. 
But after a half century of TV, we've become less knowledgeable, not more so. 
This thread began as "How to convince businesses to be accessible . 
. . 
" All this talk about multimedia benefiting those with cognitive disabilities is really a red herring. 
This isn't about helping people with disabilities to learn more. 
Is anyone on this list suggesting that we shouldn't build sites to help those with cognitive disabilities? 
Of course not. 
But the Internet is not a substitute for good teachers or for cultural values. 
Helping children to learn is important, but far more important is ensuring that all adults have an equal opportunity to participate in society. 
The "digital divide" is no joke, and bandwidth and download time are most emphatically accessibility issues. 
No, this is about giving corporations the go ahead (not that they're waiting for it) to load up their Web sites with hype and marketing flash. 
Business wants to sell us, and they know that you do not sell with reason, but by persuading people to suspend reason. 
That's hard to do with text alone. 
But add thumps and roars and moving, colorful graphics and suddenly people are mesmerized. 
And, hey, it's especially wonderful for selling sugary cereals, soda pop, violent video games, and even cigarettes to kids. 
Business cares about one thing: profit. 
There are no altruistic businesses. 
And the only way businesses are going to make their Web sites accessible is when not doing so affects the bottom line. 
You can try to sell them on the "buying power" of the disabled community. 
Good luck. 
In my opinion, the only way they'll be convinced to build accessible Web sites is the same way they were convinced to build accessible facilities: with regulation and public pressure. 
And for those who will shriek that regulation will stymie the growth of the Internet, I say: Oh, please! 
Business recognizes a gold mine when it sees one. 
The Web has become a juggernaut, and nothing, NOTHING, is going to stop it now. 
As participation in the public debate in our society becomes more and more dependent on Internet access, and as sites become more bandwidth-intensive, those without Internet connections or with limited bandwidth will become further disenfranchised. 
And isn't that the real goal of accessibility - to allow every adult full citizenship in our society? 
Sincerely, Charles F. Munat, Seattle, Washington 
This is not a problem associated with the web. 
The same problem happens with paper documents. 
I don't know the situation in the USA, but in the UK, there have been attempts for quite a long time to use clear language in official documents, and they are definitely better than they used to be. 
I can't give a reference for the before case, but you could try looking at the PDFs of the explanations of the tax forms on Making such documents completely clear can be difficult as it can lead to people breaking the law because they generalise and don't realise they are out of their depth (or alternatively make people operate with too large safety margins). 
Writing legislation that is not open to arbitrary interpretation by those determined to misinterpret seems impossible even with precise technical language. 
That aspect is attacked because it is one of the cheapest things to do, but is still not done on most web sites. 
The lack of alt text is a pretty good indicator that the site was designed with absolutely no thought to accessiblity. 
Alt text also pre-supposes the use of graphics! 
Things like alt text actually tend to be singled out by government agencies because they can be tested objectively, which means that they can be used for contract compliance and the organisation can be sure that it is legally safe. 
What I've noticed on sites that ought to fall into your category is that they copy the practices of commercial web sites, rather than using graphics to actually help the user. 
Graphics are relatively expensive to do; flashy graphics are particularly so, at least when they are not standard clips or word art from standard packages. 
These sites are wasting limited resources on non-productive graphics which could have gone on clearer wording or graphics that truly supported the text - actually scans of hand drawn sketches might actually be as effective and considerably cheaper than flashy graphics - a line drawing encoded as two colour GIF or PNG is actually quite small, even when hand drawn. 
The reason that public service sites emulate commercial sites, in my view, is not because they actually think about the design aims, but because a lot of web design is done by plagiarism. 
People copy other peoples effects without either understanding how they work or thinking about their appropriatness. 
The other issue is that many of the designers may be hoping for better paid jobs in commerce. 
You may think that someone with a message must spend all that is needed to get the message across, but that is not how the world works; if the standards are set too high, the message doesn't get sent at all. 
If the cost of reading the message is too high, it doesn't get received. 
If you showed that you understood that nearly all commercial sites use graphics in a way that doesn't help understanding, you might get more sympathy, but you seem to want no rules at all. 
Quite to the contrary, when I use commercial sites I find the graphics useful as well as interesting. 
If they are not there, I feel the merchant isn't serious about selling on the web, and I move on. 
A graphic cannot take the place of descriptive text on a selling site, but it's absence leaves a serious void in informative content ... As to rules, I want as few as necessary to meet needs.

Had a look at this last night. 
The first page looked promising after a recovered HTTP protocol error but the rest went to blank frameset pages 
and JavaScript links, so I switched to Netscape, to discover that all the images were broken (status 404 - not found), which meant I was still 
viewing it text only, but with the added benefit of white on pale yellow text on the home page! 
If the assembly diagrams were the same as gets packed with the furniture in the UK, that would be a good feature about the site; it means that they are in the top (my guess) 15 percentile of commercial sites as far as solid information is concerned (one of the things I look for, but rarely find is instruction manuals - service manuals are even better - as they invariably give a much clearer picture of what the product does than the normal list of selling points, although still often fail to give significant technical information). 
However, I think you will find that the reason these diagrams are all images is that Ikea's home is a minority language country in a market with many languages, not accessiblity for those that cannot read. 
I actually find the lack of narrative in these diagrams can be quite frustrating as it is not always that easy to match up the flat, line, drawings with the bits and pieces you actually have in front of you. 
I can remember having to guess on some occassions. 
Again, if they are just the standard assembly diagrams that they have on the site, their inclusion is very cheap (but so would be the inclusion of instruction manuals for other products). 
(I also looked at the main site, but got hit by a request to download Flash, with no explanation as to how it would benefit me (other than revealing the contents of a blanked out pane) and one of the pages formatted with text overstruck on text in Netscape 4.51 for Linux.)

Many thanks to Anne for keeping this debate live. 
I have to apologise for not entering and maintaining the fray, I have been in Edinburgh for a while and offline. 
The primary issue (as I see it,) is how do we enable non readers with poor comprehension to browse the web and access the content that they seek. 
To see an example of how and why graphic may be essential, and yet fast to load please visit: of text to: "Examples of visual systems a variety of children follow:" and a series of graphics follows. 
You will find it very hard to imagine how this information is to be made understood to the intended audience without use of graphics, that is why they are there. 
These graphics are iconic, and there can be no reason why the bulk of them might not be stored offline. 
An example of this is http://www.signbrowser.org.uk/2k/testing/jet.html 
members interested in graphical representations might like to visit: These two products are extensively used within the cognitive disabilities community. 
They allow users to communicate and share resources via the web, unfortunately they also require the use of proprietary software. 
These all offer students with limited comprehension the ability to interact with computers, and HTML is by far the best way, and possibly the only way to browse the web. 
multimedia sites which use microsoft mediaplayer 7, real media or others, offers near real time access to music and near full screen video, Sites such as http://www.atom.com which has numerous links to swf files and flash pages, Currently however they do not aid browsing via the media they advocate. 
They also generally require reading and writinskills as a minimum to access their resources.

I finally got the images in the office, and it wasn't just the paper instruction sheet, however it was only one product, and was either there to test the market for flash instructions or to provide a sample to give the general impression. 
I'll take one point out of sequence, in case it gets lost... 
Not strictly an accessibility issue, in the sense that it affects everyone, but I believe it arose for the same sort of reasons that accessibility problems arise, is that the site is abysmally slow. 
This is not a case where paying for a fast client and a T1 line will help; the problem seems to be server side. 
What they seem to have done is taken a site that is basically static HTML and static graphics, and forced all the HTML to be loaded from the same underpowered server, on every request, including repeat requests in the same session. 
They have done three things that frustrate caching, the last of which is normally only done to frustrate caching which is so aggressive that it violates the protocol. 
All the pages are dynamic, ASP, pages, which means they don't get the information that enables a cache to test for changes, so caches have to re-fetch every time. 
They have ? 
marks in the URL; this wasn't meant to prevent caching, but abuse of it for non-repeatable content means the current advice is to inhibit caching. 
Finally, they have Cache-Control: private, which essentially tells ISP and company level caches not to cache the page under any circumstances - only the browser can, but the current browsers don't cache that aggressively. 
(Cache-Control: private is intended to prevent mixing of different users' personal data.) 
The only reasons I can think of for doing this is that they consider 100% complete market research data (click trails) much much more important than adequate responsiveness. 
At a guess, they have been told this is what they need for the click trails, but not told the down side. 
I actually have the CD rack version of the product. 
Unfortunately I think I left the instructions under the base, so I can't look at them, but my impression is that the animation left the same questions unanswered (which way round to put certain pieces, and exactly where to put the tacks, I think) as the paper version. 
The only real benefit was that one didn't have to match up a code letter with the that on the manifest of pieces. 
The great disadvantage was that you couldn't lay it on the ground near where you were working. 
On paper, you can see all the detail balloons at once. 
There were quite a few omissions in the animation, e.g. only one set of dowels got hammered, how you got the side onto the dowels and how you got the first side on. 
Other accessibility problems are that even the Java animation page produces a blank screen (some JS gibberish on the first line with Netscape) with scripting off. 
You also get a blank screen in both modes with the WebTV emulator, even though, when you hit Download Shockwave, you get told, with a working demonstration, that Flash actually works for WebTV! 
(I'm not sure whether the UK products that provide set top box, or TV based web access support Flash.) My estimation would be that there would be quite a strong overlap with the WebTV type market in the UK.
