<s> A possibly forgotten technique in testing WCAG 2.0-- one we discussed a lot back in September-- is personas or personae, or composite hypothetical users.  </s>
<s> I found an accessibility-related paper that deals with personas, in this case concerning cellphones: (Google the URL for HTML version) The research isn't done yet, but at least it's there.  </s>

<s> Expect criticism if you top-post  </s>
<s> Personae are great.  </s>
<s> But you need a lot of them to cover the great variety of disability type, degree, onset etc that represent the variety of abilities and skills of these different users.  </s>
<s> No. By definition we're not trying for maximum inclusion; personae are models.  </s>
<s> We merely need a reasonable cross-section of WCAG 2.0 target groups.  </s>
<s> Personae are an adjunct to other methods of usability testing and are not the sole such method.  </s>
<s> If you leave a certain category out of personae, you can test for usability for that category elsewhere.  </s>
<s> Merely as an example, it would probably be overkill to produce six persone for colour deficiency (protan, anomalous protan, deutan, anomalous deutan, tritan, and the one everybody fixates on that's almost impossible to find, achromat).  </s>
<s> One would probably suffice in order to model issues of colour deficiency.  </s>

<s> Agreed You don't want a comprehensive set of personae.  </s>
<s> Too many.  </s>
<s> But if you only have 3 for low vision, you could leave color perception problems completely off the list.  </s>
<s> People not knowing better could think that they understood the range and not even know about the dimension.  </s>
<s> That is all I was trying to warn against.  </s>
<s> I have seen people with as few as 6 personae representing the range of disability... without mentioning that this was just a small sample of the types, degrees etc. Gregg Gregg C Vanderheiden Ph.D. Professor - Ind. Engr.  </s>
