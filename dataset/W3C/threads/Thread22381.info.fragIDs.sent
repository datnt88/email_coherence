<s> In Attribute: Description for when null is returned for getValue() is slightly hard to understand.  </s>

<s> In my understanding CSS value would be check after explicit value, but before default value.  </s>
<s> Some mention of it should be done, even if it is not quite in scope yet.  </s>

<s> I don't really know what you mean by error nodes, but in general it may not be possible to define a DOM on erroneous input.  </s>
<s> Certainly, the input must be good enough to model before we can define a document object model for it.  </s>
<s> I don't understand what stylesheets have to do with this.  </s>
<s> What getValue() gets has nothing to do with stylesheets.  </s>
<s> I don't claim to know how CSS works, but with the "specified()" method, it should be possible to tell if an attribute has been given an explicit value or not.  </s>
<s> If an application really wanted to get only an attribute's explicit value but not a default value, it would have to do logic such as: if the attribute has an explicit value specified() return getValue() else return null Note that in the case of an XML application (and, I would have thought, almost any presentation sort of application for either HTML or XML), one usually wants getValue() to get the default if there is no specified value, so that should be the definition of getValue()  </s>

<s> The initial (raw) structure model should be before any space collapsing.  </s>

<s> The DOM must allow access into all models--and most especially the initial (raw) structure model.  </s>

<s> What about the case when it is possible.  </s>
<s> For example, if you look at html source code with errors in Netscape, you would notice, it recovers from errors by ignoring part of the input (it is shown in different color).  </s>
<s> This way, you can see where was the error.  </s>
<s> In the same way an Error node would just contains text representation of skipped part and can be ignored by the application processor if not needed.  </s>
<s> Most probably it could happen on any level.  </s>

<s> I will have to let others answer for HTML--preferably someone from Netscape or Microsoft.  </s>
<s> XML does not allow a document to have well-formedness errors.  </s>
<s> An object that is not well-formed is not an XML document and is therefore not addressed by the DOM per the current official position as I understand it.  </s>
<s> Therefore, there will be no such thing as an Error node in the DOM for XML.  </s>
<s> The DOM is built from the output of and XML or HTML parser.  </s>
<s> Only "well formed" XML or HTML may be meaningfully represented in the DOM.  </s>
<s> The major browsers, for good business reasons, I suppose, attempt to "make sense" out of HTML that is not well formed, but don't count on the DOM doing anything along these lines.  </s>

<s> Ok, just to be cristal clear.  </s>
<s> If I am writing a browser and it uses DOM to represent the parsed document and my parser can "make sense" of partially wrong input, the erorrs should be discarded as "non-significant" and would not show up in DOM.  </s>
<s> This way, if internal structure was written out from the DOM structure, any errors that were in original document would not appear in the output?  </s>
<s> Alternatively, should we assume that by the time browsers will implement DOM, all documents out there will be well-formed and browser can just reject non well-formed documents?  </s>

<s> Ps. Lenin has once wrote that by the time communism will arive, no thiefs, robbers and other bad elements would be left in society, just by the fact that it is better to be a good guy then a bad guy.  </s>
<s> He also expected communism to arrive within something like 20 years.  </s>
<s> There's no way to be "crystal clear" here because it's not safe to assume ANYTHING about what a browser that "fixes up" invalid HTML will do to represent it in the DOM.  </s>
<s> The representation of a non-well-formed document in the DOM is "undefined" at present, so different vendors may do different things.  </s>
<s> If we get lots of feedback indicating that this is unworkable, we might address it in a later draft of the DOM spec.  </s>
<s> But the solution is likely to be more "Stalinist" than "Leninist", e.g., throwing an exception determining that it is a "non-document" and sending it to the DOM equivalent of Siberia.  </s>
<s> We're not assuming that all documents on the Web will be well-formed by the time the DOM is released (of course), but we are saying that anyone who wants to use the DOM to manipulate their Web document had better make sure that it is well-formed first.  </s>
<s> I think this kind of annotation could be very useful.  </s>
<s> Much in the same way the "Java Console" in Netscape provides us with a record of what classes didn't make it etc.....it could be a very useful log for what code was "passed over" ....which code was "available" compared to what was actually "parsed" ;-)  </s>
