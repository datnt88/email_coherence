Hi, Has anyone checked out WeMedia's talking browser? 
Any comments? 
Thanks, Scott Hi, I liked it. 
Control is easy, it's graphical you can easily change the background and foreground colors. 
It seems friendly enough for kids. 
Chantal Hope to take a look at it later tonight, but of course, comments from people in the "target audience" (of which I'm not) are most appreciated. 
In other words, if this is a browser for people with specific disabilities (limited vision or learning disabilities) I'd like to hear if it is meeting their needs -- whether or not _I_ like it is less useful to all of us.

TAKE CONTROL. 
WeMedia's Talking Browser (v 1.2) seems to be a good start (and the price is certainly right). 
The basic "read the whole page" function can be useful, although it doesn't allow the user to navigate/control reading like a full screen reader or Home Page Reader (which are addmittely much more expensive...) Sighted users can also use it to read specific text that they have selected/highlighted with the mouse. 
It's "text only" view, which offers a few text color/size options, is handy. 
I am a little surprized that it seems to ignore images all together, even those with ALT text. 
Also, while reading a page, it doesn't indicate when it is reading a link vs regular text. 
There is a "page map" feature that is a links list, but it also misses ALT text on image links (providing the full HREF URL instead) and TITLE attributes set on text links. 
The speech overall is probably too verbose. 
For example, in the page map/links list it announces each link as "Link number x, link displayed is link text ". 
For a non-visual user it means listening through a lot of extra, repetitive speech to find a desired link. 
Simply saying the link text would probably be adequate. 
For now, it looks like it's biggest potential would be for users who are partially sighted or have reading disabilities. 
I have only looked at it quickly, and I'd be happy to hear if anyone else has better luck.

Thanks, Scott I doubt that the WeMedia talking browser would be very useful for individuals with reading disabilities. 
There is way too much chatter and it lacks the supports that are critical to individuals with reading disabilities. 
Of significance, it is important for sighted users of talking browsers to read along with the spoken text. 
This is made possible by means of synchronized highlighting while the text is spoken. 
The WeMedia talking browser provides no support in this critical area. 
Being able to set the various reading and highlight combinations depending on individual need is also important. 
Also, if speech is interrupted, it seems that it cannot begin speaking where you left off. 
It always begins at the top of the document and reads everything. 
Lack of reading controls is a fatal flaw for a tool like this. 
You can even Tab through all of the links on a Web page, a function of the underlying MS Internet Explorer component, but this is completely disconnected from the behavior of the speech engine. 
Switching from Text View to the Normal View does provide those with reading disabilities with the graphics and other information that can enhance comprehension. 
This is useful. 
I suspect that WeMedia must have developed the talking browser for individuals who are blind although I am not aware of many individuals who would prefer it to a screen reader for any purpose. 
Perhaps libraries that are not able to offer screen readers could offer bare-bones TTS support with a tool like this - after someone lauches the application. 
Given the list of Channels that are provided, I suspect this may be intended as a shopping tool.
