<s> to index the resource space, unless they were upgraded to re-crawl the URL space with the "Translate" header, and then store in their cache that the "Translate" header needs to be included in the request.  </s>
<s> Analogously, it becomes impossible to just embed a URL in a mail message that refers someone to the source ... you'd have to somehow include an annotation that says "and use the Translate header when you request this URL".  </s>
<s> These kinds of reasons make me strongly object to either the GETSRC method or a Translate header.  </s>
<s> Cheers, Geoff (or other mechanism to that effect)) The only reason for GETSRC or "Translate: F" is to overload one URI for both the source and output resources, but it seems to me that breaks a lot of features.  </s>
<s> We suddenly need to duplicate most properties ({DAV:}getsrcetag, {DAV:}getsrccontenttype...) to deal well with caching and editing.  </s>
<s> You're likely to go through content negotiation and wind up editing just one variant without even realizing it (or worse, store one variant at the vanilla URI's corresponding filename and inhibit negotiation!).  </s>
<s> And Web development being the way it is, it's almost certain that when GETSRC seems to usually work on simplistic servers, hardly any clients will know how to use {DAV:}source in the cases where it won't.  </s>
<s> But if the output resource does have a separate URI, a PUT or LOCK or PROPPATCH on it probably doesn't make sense, so it's not likely that many modules will bother being compliant enough to answer a PROPFIND request for {DAV:}source (in my case, GET clients and DAV clients are talking to different servers entirely).  </s>
<s> An HTTP header containing the source URIs for an output resource (only for authenticated requests?) should be much easier to implement; would that be more likely to be widely adopted and used?  </s>
<s> Thanks, Geoff.  </s>
<s> Sorry if I keep repeating myself, but: are the source and the output resource a) different resources, or b) variants of the same resource [1].  </s>
<s> I say "a)", and thus they need to have different URIs.  </s>
<s> Julian [1] RFC2616, section 1.3  </s>
<s> Not speaking of the problem how the heck google is to display search results for such source documents... But by then we probably have extended HTML to handle a href="http://xyz/doc.asp" translate="F" link to interesting source /a in all browsers.  </s>
<s> Piece of cake really.  </s>

<s> Oh, I don't mean a Translate-like request header that asks for the source resource at an overloaded URI, just that sending the source URI in a response header could be a smaller burden than having every output resource generator implement PROPFIND just for the sake of answering a request for {DAV:}source for output resources that have no other noteworthy DAV properties.  </s>
