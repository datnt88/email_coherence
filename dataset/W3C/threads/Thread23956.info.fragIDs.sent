Hello, Steven Pemberton who chairs the W3C HTML and XForms Working Groups has posted the slides for last week's WWW2004 talk about XForms in New York online. 
In the "XForms 1.0: en route to success slide" On the day of release there were more implementations than any other W3C specification on the day of release, ever. 
Around 30 implementations announced so far, including plugins, native implementations, proxies, 'zero install' implementations, a voice-browser, an editor, a validator... Major companies and industries are already using XForms (e.g. Bristol-Myers-Squibb, Frauenhofer, Daiwa - a Japanese Bank, the British Life Insurance industry... and more I can't tell you about yet: watch this space!) So much about the hype. 
As far as I know not a single browser vendor (e.g. Microsoft, Apple, Opera, Mozilla, Konqueror, etc.) has endorsed W3C XForms. 
Ironically, the W3C is supposed to be a vendor consortium. 
Anyway, for a reality check I invite you to check out the Richmond Post poll asking "What is your XForms Player of choice?" 
online @ 
So far only about a hundred people have bothered to vote although the poll is now up for more than a week and I've promoted it *twice* on half a dozen mailinglists including xml-dev, www-forms, and more. 
Is XForms the next big thing? 
According to Steven: It looks like it is going to be the year of XForms. 
XForms has hit a nerve, and is supplying a need: industry reponse has been incredible.

Hi Gerald, And your point is? 
I was looking out for your 'reality check', but I missed it. 
Anyway, to your two points: (a) that the suitability of new technologies is measured by online voting, and (b) the suitability of a new technology is measured by whether those with a vested interest in not adopting that technology, choose to endorse it. 
ON POLLS Surely someone of your experience isn't saying that the traction of a technology is based on how many people respond to a poll? 
XForms will either solve a problem that users have, or it won't. 
Of course you and I can argue into the night over the syntax and whether there are features missing, but the proof of the pudding, as they say .... So, Steven's point was not to say, look everyone, XForms is taking off, and it's proved by companies A and B - in his presentation he was saying that we have a list of real companies with real problems that XForms is solving today. 
In parentheses, it's no small thing that the UK insurance industry has voted to adopt XForms in place of their own form language, ISML. 
Their 'trade association' Origo represents a lot of very large organisations, many of them household names. 
And I'm sorry if they were a bit too busy to vote on your poll. 
ON BROWSER ENDORSEMENT I don't get this one either. 
You say that none of the browser builders endorse XForms, but so what? 
Browser-building is a dangerous business, and I wouldn't bet your house on any of the current monolithic browsers being the leaders in 5 years time (especially when one of them has said they won't be developing their browser any further). 
The reality is that there are now many browsers being built for many 
platforms. 
Oracle and Novell, for example, have built their own XForms-aware 
browsers to work with their server products. 
That's probably far more significant for the future of XForms than Opera's lack of support. 
In fact, if you put aside the fact that Opera have found it difficult to implement XForms, but easier to bad mouth it, then you are only really talking about Microsoft and Mozilla. 
As far as Microsoft are concerned the browser war is over - they beat off Netscape, and so they don't need to do any more, and we won't see anything from them now, until Longhorn. 
Even then it will use their own language, XAML. 
And as for Mozilla - well IBM have already announced that they are going to build in native XForms support! 
Add to all this that Sun are putting XForms support into OpenOffice, and then remind yourself that XForms only became a full standard in October last year, and I think Steven may well be right! 
One final point; you say that the W3C is not vendor-led, and your *proof* is that neither Opera or Microsoft have adopted XForms. 
Well, it's not my job to defend the W3C, but when you ignore the fact that XForms *is* supported by Oracle, IBM, Sun, PureEdge, Novell, Xerox and others, you leave yourself open to accusations that you might not be making very logical arguments.

Hi Gerald 
However, it looks like the W3C is increasingly irrelevant. 
If the W3C can't unite the browser vendors, who can? 
Why doesn't the W3C lobby harder? 
Microsoft being large and complex is the problem as to the browser, to "blame" the W3C is not "fair". 
The W3C is evolving and providing many new opportunities and directions, I am thankful to them. 
Creativity is at times a mess ;) cheers michael bolger 
Hi Gerald, I think your response below shows you have substituted "the W3C leading the web to its full potential" with "the W3C leading web browsers to their full potential." 
Given the number of W3C member companies that are NOT browser vendors, this seems curious. 
Why should the W3C only support the advancement of the software produced by only those few members? 
To me, this seems the opposite of the goal of leading the web to its full potential. 
The goal is to maximize software interoperability, maintainability and ease of design. 
In the case of XForms, these goals are accomplished by having the same XML syntax for the core processing model and data schema of XFDL forms, XHTML forms, VoiceXML forms, mobile forms, etc. 
Also, on the notion of polling, this is an activity that is usually done in a scientific manner, i.e. the target population is rigorously identified, determined to be sufficiently informed on the subject, and most importantly, randomly sampled (or completely sampled). 
The things you are running which you are calling polls do not have these properties. 
Therefore, it is a stretch to claim that they are a *good* way of finding out anything. 
Finally, regarding the relevance of XForms, there is not a feature of XForms that is not in PureEdge's XFDL, which we invented in the 90's because HTML forms simply weren't good enough to solve 'real' problems. 
Making XFDL a skin for XForms has been a simple matter of switching vocabularies to achieve the same effects (while continuing to allow the value-adds of XFDL shine through). 
Therefore, I think it would be fair to say that XForms draws some relevance from that of XFDL, which has an install base in the millions at enterprise-level sites, some of which are listed at http://www.pureedge.com/customers/ 
John Boyer, Ph.D. Senior Product Architect and Research Scientist PureEdge Solutions Inc. Hello Mark, 
Well, my point was that the W3C is supposed to bring together browser vendors/project and lead the web to its full potential. 
However, it looks like the W3C is increasingly irrelevant. 
If the W3C can't unite the browser vendors, who can? 
Why doesn't the W3C lobby harder? 
Why doesn't the W3C publish, for example, the roadmaps/positions of browser vendors such as Microsoft, Apple, Opera, Mozilla, etc? 
As everybody can see the secret backroom dealing is getting us nowhere and the rich internet for everyone will be lost. 
Are web based polls the next big thing? 
Maybe we should run a poll to find out. 
They surely help to find out how popular something is. 
And I'm sorry if you can't deal with the results that tell you that XForms is irrelevant. 
Why not put up your own poll and see if you come to a different conclusion.
