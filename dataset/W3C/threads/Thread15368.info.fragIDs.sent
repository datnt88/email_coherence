Not to be trite, but it appears to me that if an author wants to invoke personal preference that they simply not conform to WCAG. 
To be even more trite, the author may state "This site does not conform to WCAG because the author feels artistic freedom is more important than accessibility."

My argument is that we should, as much as possible, provide a way for authors to override our guidelines while still keeping their pages accessible. 
Not quite right. 
I should have expressed this as: 
My argument is that we should, as much as possible, provide a way for authors to override our guidelines as long as they notify the audience. 
Example 1: 
Guidelines say there must be good text/background contrast. 
Author uses yellow text on white background and states "I want this text to be difficult to read because of some artistic reason ". Example 2: 
Guidelines say there should be clear navigation. 
Author has porously confusing navigation and states "Navigation is confusing because I want you to wander around." 
Example 3: Guidelines say content should be understandable. 
Author creates easily misunderstood content and states "I am an anarchist - deal with it." 
Regarding the TH rule: If you really want to have THs in your layout table then you can. 
Just explicitly state that this is a layout table.

I don't understand this at all. 
If an author can contravene the guidelines and still produce accessible content surely the guidelines should be 
changed, 
no? Chaals 
That sounds that blanket -- when creating Web sites, I observe several things to be arranged. 
On the one hand, I want to create valid markup, on the other hand, I want to create accessible and usable pages, and I want to create pages usable in almost all browsers. 
The third point (availability to all browsers) is something I sometimes 
prefer in contradiction to accessibility, so I rather pass on 200,000 people with 
a special kind of disability than passing on e.g. 700,000 Netscape 4.x users -- anyhow I'm creating accessible pages, too. 
And in comparison, I feel right. 
I didn't show specific examples (because I didn't want to write this post yet), but I hope you see the point. 
Sometimes there might be reasons to develop not the entire way the WCAG suggests, but this is not inevitably wrong (or inaccessible). 
So there is no need to judge all people by ridiculing 'artistic freedom'.

The question is whether or not the guidelines provide a normative conformance scheme (as WCAG 1.0 does) or if they provide specific sample conformance schemes (which can be structured to parallel WCAG 1.0 A/AA/AAA if desired) as examples of using WCAG 2.0 as a toolkit for building accessibility policies. 
I have long advocated the latter approach. 
The process of developing an accessibility policy is very different from the process of creating an accessible Web site. 
WCAG 2.0 should be a toolkit for doing so, in a way that is interoperable and standardized, to prevent situations like the case of Section 508. 
(In other words, you should be able to "build" a policy approximating 508 by selecting portions of WCAG 2.0. 
This will likely be much different from the "default" conformance schemes.) --Kynn Kynn Bartlett kynn@idyllmtn.com http://kynn.com
