Agenda request for tomorrows telecon. 
The current AS&amp;S WD of WebOnt permits the following in OWL Lite: but prohibits from OWL Lite: (Both examples may include rdfs:comments indicating that the informal semantics intended is that of an rdf:Bag - an informal semantics that is not formally supported either in OWL Lite or RDF). 
Both examples are in OWL Full and have identical semantics in OWL Full (except that the URIs of the classes and properties differ). 
This appears to be an unmotivated failure of interoperability between OWL Lite and RDF. 
I suggest that this WG may like to either: - make a comment asking for a rationale on public-webont-comments or - ask Brian to raise this at the coordination group. 
Jeremy [My attempts to have this discussed in WebOnt have failed]. 
Is see the webont chairs haven't decided yet: I have asked via the cg if they would like our input. 
I'm inclined to postpone a little bit till we hear from them. 
Brian OK
