<s> I think this proposal is the best solution to the problem.  </s>
<s> I would much rather the specification was consistent than there be a special treatment of Content-Encoding for the benefit of perl hackers.  </s>
<s> I don't see any logic in treating Content-Encoding differently from the other tags and we would almost certainly want to correct the anomaly in HTTP/1.2.  </s>
<s> We might as well make the change now.  </s>

<s> In this % case, if "identity" is one of the available content-codings, then % the server SHOULD use the "identity" content-coding, unless % it has additional information that a different content-coding % is meaningful to the client.  </s>
<s> While the SHOULD make sense to me, I don't understand the reason for the first MAY.  </s>
<s> What else could a server do?  </s>
<s> Reject the request altogether?  </s>
<s> One alternative interpretation would be that the server could only send the "identity" coding (i.e., no Content-Encoding response header) if the client sends no Accept-Encoding field.  </s>
<s> After some discussion a few months ago, we rejected this because it would break some existing applications (for example, "robot" clients that are used to retrieve the contents of an entire site).  </s>
<s> Hence, the specification explicitly allows the server to send something when it doesn't have an "identity" content-coding available.  </s>
<s> We added the advice that if you have a choice of encodings, and one of those choices is "identity", and the client hasn't indicated an ability to decode anything else, then you should normally send "identity".  </s>
<s> This should eliminate the possibility that a client receives something which it doesn't understand, unless nothing else is available.  </s>
