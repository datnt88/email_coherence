In the Scope part of the EO Charter, in the first bullet it says one of our functions is "to advise on user-friendly presentation of other groups' work." 
As a human factors and HCI professional, my feeling is that the term "user-friendly" is hackneyed and often misunderstood. 
I suggest changing this to "to advise on presentation of other groups' to assure that their web sites are both accessible to and usable by people with disabilities". 
Accessible comes first (a necessary prerequisite), but doesn't insure usability by any means. 
Usability is important to all groups and is independant of accessibility - but, there may be different requirements to make an interface usable by people using any assistive technology.

I missed this in my charter update earlier this week, so you will not see it in the linked version from the agenda, but I will make it before it finishes W3M review early next week.
