<s> Definitely, the test suite is the most malleable component.  </s>
<s> The only errata that appears to effect the markup language (as opposed to errata that would effect only the tests) is the addition of throws clause for Attr.value and the only place that this comes into play is when DTD or Schema validating tests, roughly equivalent to using Lint on a program to check for warnings.  </s>
<s> Since there is only one test that it affects, my suggestion was just to turn lint off for this test.  </s>
<s> I'll investigate building DTD's and Schema's from the DOM 1 SE tonight and report to the list.  </s>
<s> Sorry; I misread.  </s>
<s> You're right, the second edition does still show as a Working Draft.  </s>
<s> Minor errata are still trickling in, which is probably why it hasn't been officially promoted... but it might indeed be time to nail it down and then bring out a third edition if/when anything needs further work.  </s>
<s> Or maybe just advance it to CR, as a promise that we won't change it unless we must.  </s>
<s> Meanwhile... You're probably right; the conservative solution is to tell folks not to validate that one test until this goes golden.  </s>
