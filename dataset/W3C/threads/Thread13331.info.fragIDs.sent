<s> I doubt this has anything to do with the URL suffix, at least, not on Bobby's end.  </s>
<s> For example, Bobby can do just fine on the following URLs:  </s>
<s> shtml is not necessarily a privacy suffix; it is commonly used to indicate parsed HTML containing Server Side Includes.  </s>
<s> (Incidentally.  </s>
<s> *.shm is a nice looking 3-letter form of this than *.sht ...) I don't have an answer as to why it's getting 'permission denied' when Bobby tries to access that file -- perhaps it's some sort of server configuration that dislikes Bobby's non-standard user agent type?  </s>
<s> It could be server-side scripting gone horribly wrong.  </s>
<s> --Kynn  </s>
<s> Harvey.  </s>
<s> We see this problem every once a while.  </s>
<s> It is probably not because of the .sht*  </s>
<s> extension.  </s>
<s> We have found that often the problem has to do with some sort of server-side redirection.  </s>
<s> You can usually get through using the ;Bobby Application.a  </s>
<s> Hope this helps.  </s>
