Hello all! 
I've completed the first of several accessibility articles. 
The initial one was included on our Unisys internal product information (PI) site. 
My intent was to make some of my co-workers -company wide - aware of the issues. 
The response was as expected. 
Most didn't have a clue that blind accessibility was a problem. 
The good news is that they were all interested and willing to learn about it. 
I suspect that will be the familiar response to the other articles I've planned. 
The one that I've linked to below was just printed in the December newsletter of the Orange County chapter of the Society for Technical Communication. 
The parent STC is one of the world's largest groups of technical writers/communicators. 
A larger variation of this article is slated for their monthly magazine - to be published sometime this Spring. 
(I will try to include some more tips, some quotes, and some info on screen-readers in that article.) I would appreciate your comments on this article and anything you think I should add to get the message across. 
I hope to continue with these types of articles for web designers and the managers who direct their web staff. 
Any suggestions will be cheerfully accepted. 
I don't want the article to become the "total reference" for the subject -- just a serious overview to get people thinking. 
(There are too many good websites providing additional detailed info for the more complicated items.) 
By the way, if you think this article worthy of reprinting or posting, I'd be happy to accomodate. 
Please ask first. 
(And use my email address of mrcalc@usa.net for contact info.) Thanks!

Dear Mr. Ball: Unless I'm missing something, the link below leads to a page with links to PDF documents. 
Can you provide the newsletter in a more accessible format please? 
Thank you, Kathleen Anderson URL OSC: http://www.osc.state.ct.us/ URL ACCESS: http://www.cmac.state.ct.us/access/ 
I didn't want to send a Word file to everybody on the list without their permission. 
I will send one to Kathleen and will send one to whomever requests it. 
Just drop me a line here. 
(I'll be out of the office until the end of the day but will respond promptly) Thanks for the interest!

Guy: Your were right about not sending the Word version to the list; thank you for that. 
I guess my question was too subtle. 
Can you provide the newsletter ON YOUR SITE in a more accessible format? 
HTML and/or text would be fine. 
You'd get a much wider audience that way. 
Thanks,

Kathleen: Unfortunately I don't control that site. 
I will forward your message to their webmaster. 
This is a great example of people who need to understand what my article was all about - accessibility of a website to all. 
So many people (technical writers, companies) are moving their documents and printed materials to pdf formats - which may or may not be accessible (depending on whom you talk to). 
We need to push the message out that ease of publishing (which is what pdf offers) does not mean total accessibility to an important audience.
