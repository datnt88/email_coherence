The thread schema was not supposed to affect old clients, I did test with old Amaya. 
But obviously that was not enough. 
We should have asked someone else to test too. 
I have two names now on my list that we can ask next time. 
Marja - you should/could test schema or protocol changes with the Annotea JavaScript interfaces: [1] http://www.w3.org/2001/Annotea/Bookmarklet/Annotea-JavaScript.html 
Meanwhile we try see what is wrong and correct it as soon as possible. 
Hmmm. 
The Annotea Servlet? 
Jim - does your Annotea implementation use an Annotea Servlet like [1] does or does it go directly to an Annotea Server? 
Matthew - at one point EricP was talking about modifying the Annotea server (protocol?) so that Annozilla could bypass the Annotea Servlet and go directly to the server. 
I don't know the status of that work. 
I believe the issue was that Mozilla was expecting a different MIME media type for the RDF/XML returned from the server. 
Even if this current problem is not related to the Annotea Servlet perhaps you and EricP can determine a way to eliminate the servlet from the pipeline.

It goes direct, no servlet involved. 
I've not yet had time to look properly why it's failing - it's in http://jibbering.com/snufkin/ 
Jim. 
You are right I should have tested Annotea Servlet too. 
After EricP's quick fix it seems to work now - thanks Eric!

Thanks to everyone for their help in clearing this up. 
Is there any documentation on the new schema yet?
