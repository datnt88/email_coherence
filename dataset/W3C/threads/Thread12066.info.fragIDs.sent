<s> --Bridie  </s>
<s> Bridie, It may be easiest to accomplish the requirements through source editing, but it is not necessary.  </s>
<s> In a SMIL presentation, the structure essentially consists of a timed sequence, in which cerrtain elements may have several paralell components.  </s>
<s> Being able to move from one point in the sequence to another, and among paralell items (or switch elements, as the case may be) would constitute navigation of the structure.  </s>
<s> That may be achieved by stepping the focus along a representation of the sequence in what is essentially tree-style navigation, without ever exposing the source (although it is necessary to expose textual labels for the elements - titles, alt, etc).  </s>
<s> Being able to find a particular timepoint, or a particular object by name, would be examples of search functions.  </s>
<s> Being able to cut, copy and paste a par element is an example of editing the structure.  </s>
<s> With regard to conversions, when multiple tracks are merged into a single file it is expected that the information contained in each of those tracks is included in the final file produced (for example captions, audio, audio description and video tracks would all be available).  </s>

<s> that you should offer the same functionality to all users? the ATAG doesn't describe how to build a tool for a niche market (read: users with disabilities), but, rather, how to build a tool that can be used by all persons, regardless of perceived disability, to create content that can be used by all persons, regardless of perceived disability... gregory He that lives on Hope, dies farting -- Benjamin Franklin, Poor Richard's Almanack, 1763 Gregory J.
