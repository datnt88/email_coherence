<s> Here is his advice: Convert each color to Lab, then calculate the length of the difference vector in Lab (also known as deltaE).  </s>
<s> The distance is a fairly consistent measure of color difference.  </s>
<s> Contrasting colors may need a deltaE of 40 or more.  </s>

<s> The problem is contrast, not color difference.  </s>

<s> As I recall there were three types of color sensors, the red yellow and Blue.  </s>
<s> Any or all off these can be low impaired or missing entirely.  </s>
<s> For people who are completely color blind (no color vision at all) it is only the gray scale that counts, so a red on black is completely invisible I actually wrote to them a year ago or so, and got some conformation on this) If someone has no blue vision, then having a high contrast just biased on the blue scale is not sufficient.  </s>
<s> Of course the same is true for the other cones.  </s>
<s> So you need sufficient contrast in each of the fundamental colors, to guarantee contrast for all color disabilities (not just the common ones).  </s>
