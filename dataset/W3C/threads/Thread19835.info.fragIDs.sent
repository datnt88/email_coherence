<s> I successfully changed the following things in Amaya so that it behaves more as a common browser:  </s>
<s> Changing double-click to simple-click: Go to HTML.A and change: ElemActivate.Pre - DoubleClick to ElemSelectPre - DoubleClick.  </s>
<s> Pages in Read-Only mode: In html2thot.c  </s>
<s> near line 7580, there's the following commented line: /* TtaSetDocumentAccessMode(theDocument, 0); */ Uncommenting this line is sufficient to make all the pages Read-Only Menus: In EDITOR.A, Delete or Add all you want, and edit the file config/en-amayadialogue to update the menus names.  </s>
<s> the format is the following: First the main menus names from left to right, then the submenus names from top to bottom.  </s>
<s> Buttons: In init.c, in InitViewDoc: Just remove the buttons you don't want, the Math button is some lines after the main buttons, in an #ifdef condition.  </s>
<s> All the HTML debug output: In html2thot.c,  </s>
<s> just disable all the "*printf()" lines WARNING: sometimes you need to change a bit the code, because the "*printf()" line is the only line in a IF condition.  </s>
<s> There's output too from Thot/thotlib/base/thotmsg.c, in the first function.  </s>
<s> Same thing to do, disable the "*printf()".  </s>
<s> NOTE: I didn't tried to change this file yet but it prints the same message I see in the output so it's surely this one :)  </s>
<s> NOTE 2: I haven't yet tried to remove the editor code, although I plan to do it in the next few weeks, but I'm a little bit afraid of cross references between the browser part and the editor part of Amaya, so any information on the imbrications of these two parts would be nice.  </s>
<s> NOTE 3: I plan too to make a modified version of Amaya (with all the #ifdef needed to have a proper source) but this will need more time.  </s>
<s> NOTE 4: We have added too for internal use, a little modification to the GetObjectWWW function in query.c  </s>
<s> so that access is restricted only to servers specified in a file.  </s>
<s> So if someone is interested in it, just mail me and I'll send you the code(almost 30 lines), I didn't include it here, since it's unuseful for the majority.  </s>
<s> NOTE 5: I still have some problems to resolve: 1) It is still possible to write in the TITLE field.  </s>
<s> 2) The search function in the menus can still modify the text, even with TtaSetDocumentAccessMode(Doc,0).  </s>
<s> 3)When in Read-Only, the default text color is Green and I didn't find where to change it.  </s>
<s> 4)Any info on cross references between the editor part and the browser part of Amaya would be nice.  </s>
<s> 5)(optional) Showing in the bottom of the window the target of the link under the mouse pointer would be nice but I really don't have a clue how to do it...  </s>

<s> I am doing similar stuff for client and have some questions or pointers if you can provide.  </s>
<s> 1.How do I change Background color of Amaya.  </s>
<s> You should look at the HTMLP.P file in the amaya directory, many attributes are defined here.  </s>
<s> I didn't try to change this file so this is perhaps not the good one, but it seems to be the one  </s>
<s> you're looking for.  </s>
<s> 2.How does Amaya take care of Links in HTML documents.I  </s>
<s> looked at html2thot.c and cannot figure out how "HREF" is handled and how can I get the co-ordinates of HREF i.e x,y,width,height of the link.  </s>
<s> That's one of my problems too, I don't know.  </s>
<s> Please let me know if you have any clues.  </s>
<s> Thanks in Advance Suhas  </s>

<s> In-reply-to: Your message of Tue, 27 Jan 1998 12:25:07 +0100."  </s>
<s> Great !  </s>
<s> This file prints toolkit error messages.  </s>
<s> you can change it if you want.  </s>
<s> From time to time we move functions from one module to another to avoid these imbrications.  </s>
<s> Normally all modules "edit" (like EDITimage.c or HTMLedit.c) must containt only edit functions and should be removed for a browser.  </s>
<s> I don't know how to avoid that with Motif and Windows.  </s>
<s> But Amaya refuses to change the document title when it receives the callback from Motif (on Return key).  </s>
<s> It's a bug.  </s>
<s> In files $HOME/.thotrc  </s>
<s> ReadOnlyColor=Black  </s>
<s> See NOTE 2  </s>
<s> We need to add a Thot event to do that.  </s>
<s> It'll be available in a future version; not the next one because it's too late (we plan to do the public release next week).  </s>
<s> Regards Irene.  </s>
