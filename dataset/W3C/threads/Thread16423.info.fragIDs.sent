We are in the process of developing a set of accessibility guidelines to be used by the Santa Rosa Junior College district in California. 
We are using the W3c and Bobby recommendations along with the Department of Justice guidelines. 
Still this isn't assuring that pages with forms are accessible by the blind. 
What are your recommendations for designing for JAWS. 
Thanks: Terry Hammon 
Terry, if you could forward the prblems that are still occurring to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines list at w3c-wai-gl@w3.org that group may be able to answer your questions, or can take your input on board for subsequent work.

I recommend not designing to aim at a particular screen reader but designing for access. 
I too would like to know not only the problems you are having with forms but which version of jfw you are using? 
Thanks!
