Just for the record (they should have been sent here) Two isses: - Need to rework the checklist linkage to the main document: is it part of the guidelines or a separate note ? 
- Do we need a specific checkpoint on font tagging. 
Part of the guidelines. 
This is stated in the last call [1]: 3) An appendix document [3] lists all the checkpoints in the Guidelines, organized by subject and priority level. 
Perhaps this is not clear enough, but as an appendix, it's meant to be part of the guidelines. 
The editors should clarify this within the Guidelines document.

This will be cleared up. 
This is discussed in the techniques document. 
Rather than add a checkpoint, we will indicate that authors should avoid FONT as an example of checkpoint 5.4 - Ian Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org)
