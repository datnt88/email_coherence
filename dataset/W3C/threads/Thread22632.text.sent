Can someone confirm the value that Document.ownerDocument should return? 
I'm guessing (and hoping) that it references the document itself, but this isn't clear from the DOM 2 spec. 
The sentence, "When this node is a Document or a DocumentType which is not used with any Document yet, this is null," is particularly confusing -- when is a Document not used with any Document? 
Garret Now that I've reread the specification, maybe the sentence is: if((node is document) || (node is documentType not used with document) ownerDocument is null Maybe I was parsing the sentence incorrectly... Garret I'm isn't a Yes, that's correct. 
Any suggestion for improvement is welcome!
