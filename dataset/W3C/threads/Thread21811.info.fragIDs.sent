SemWeb Arch presenters, please help us complete the meeting record. 
EricM, I went over the IRC logs and made links from agenda items to the relevant parts of the logs, resulting in...

Pat H, did you send those to www-archive or something? 
I can't find them.

Hmm... EricM, didn't Liddy Neville project something at the meeting? 
Hmm... I added a bunch of link target anchors, but you have to view source to see many of them... we might want to fix that by moving the bulk of the materials from the Agenda section to the Records section, leaving a smaller set of pointers under Agenda. 
But that's a lot of work and I'm not likely to find the energy for it. 
I might tweak the contents navbar at the top a bit.
