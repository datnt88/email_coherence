You are welcome to peruse the first draft of a page on the AWARE Center site, entitled "Designing Pages Accessible to Limited Textual Comprehension User". 
This is still a rough document, but I've tried to incorporate some of the suggestions made on this list, in the form of advice to web authors. 
I likely am missing several important strategies for increasing the understandability of a web page, and if you'd be kind enough to share them with me (via this list or private email to kynn@hwg.org or aware@hwg.org), 
I can include them in a later draft of this document. 
Constructive criticism and comments are welcome. 
Thanks.

Kynn, Seems like a good start. 
It is late and I am tired so I'll hold off the comments until I am awake again. 
Cheers Charles 
Kynn you have done a great job of summarizing much of the important basics required by the issue. 
I'd like to add some suggestions you can include to aid a web author in making the content more accessible. 
1) definitions and/or examples for an unfamiliar terms can be included via a link on the term/s in question, to a small page that defines the term or shows an example. 
If there will be several of these, the web author may want to make a "definitions" page with bookmarks, so that the links can go to the exact term desired. 
This can be used instead of defining the term in a phrase or sentence in the text. 
In html 1.0 it was possible to put a "glossary" at the bottom of a page, with links to the glossary terms as needed in the text. 
I assume this can still be done, instead of a separate page for "definitions", if the number of terms is limited. 
2) Animated graphics should not be avoided, but should be used carefully so that too many animations aren't all going at the same time on the screen. 
Arranging the animated graphics so that only one is showing per screenful of page, would be helpful and limit the competition between elements all begging to be noticed. 
Like still graphics, animated graphics convey meaning when chosen properly. 
3) Large and many graphics can be put on a page without slowing download time by using two forms of each graphic. 
The original size, and a resampled version, perhaps resampled to 25% of the original. 
Link the 25% sample to the page, and insert a link on the small graphic to access the full-sized graphic. 
This is very import for detailed drawings, maps and other graphics that are of little use in the small size because of the need to see details. 
One shopping site I use regularly, http://www.eddiebauer.com, 
uses the small and large graphics to display their merchandise, so you can see overall style in the small graphic, and garment/fabric details on the large graphic. 
Good work, Kynn, Anne Anne L. Pemberton apembert@crosslink.net

Kynn, I think your paper provides a good jumping off point for these issues. 
You might be interested in reading the section of the CAST Website dealing with Universal Design for Learning. 
It begins at: Note that CAST has a slant towards learning and education so our view of Universal Design is directly connected to K-12 and college level learning strategies and curriculum materials. 
Also note that the first of our three "Universal Design for Learning Principles" ties in with your comments about multiple representations of information. 
If you are interested in reviewing basic background information pertaining to the neurosciences and education oriented strategies regarding these topics, that can be found on our website as well. 
CAST also provides a basic introduction to alternative representations for images (alt tags and long descriptions) at: A similar page is available at for sound at: Both are first phase implementations and will be enhanced shortly by Michael Cooper who is also our lead Bobby design and technical person. 
It's really difficult to know how far to go with this sort of advice until further progress on basic usability and accessibility is made with educational, government and corporate websites. 
We have been developing a text-to-speech supported reader that uses the IE5 component and SAPI4 speech to provide speech with synchronized highlighting in both the browser and Rich Text document (or notes windows). 
This is not intended to replace screen readers. 
It's to support those who cannot read or read well for one reason or another - including those that you mention. 
It is not considered a replacement for learning to read and we are wrestling with the difficult questions pertaining to providing the right balance of support and challenge for those who still need to work on developing basic reading skills. 
On the other hand, we want learners to have access to information and not be denied participation in educational activities due to reading and learning disabilities. 
TTS can provide basic access to text based information but it doesn't really help much with poorly organized and poorly written information. 
I am looking for basic principles of usability that might be shared with kids and am growing weary of having to translate the adult stuff for kids. 
Does anyone know of a great (or even partly great) usability and accessibility site written at a level and organized in a way appropriate to kids. 
I am pleased that you have gotten this topic off the ground. 
As I recall, Al Gilman and others have expressed interest in this area as well.

CH:: "CAST also provides a basic introduction to alternative representations for images (alt tags and long descriptions) at: WL: This is good for pix-to-text but much of our recent (seemingly endless) discussions have been an effort to make text-to-pix somehow become a part of the guidelines. 
A site like the above called text_barrier.html is IMHO very unlikely to be as clear-cut a success. 
I cannot yet imagine any way to do this because my brain just doesn't work that way and I've seen no evidence of anything showing how this can be done *WITHOUT A MAJOR CHANGE IN THE ENTIRE LANGUAGE EDUCATION PROCESS* and certainly nothing from a set of vague guidelines: "use illustrations where helpful" sort of urgings. 
What illustrations? 
A picture of a rose means "rose", "spring semester schedule", "Rose", and if there aren't a few more, I would be very surprised. 
But when the picture is used on a Web page the author should know what she was up to and ALT="text" becomes a proper subject for a guideline. 
My guess is that it will be decades (if ever) before this can change and when it does the learning process will be just as difficult for folks with learning disabilities as it is now for them to learn to read text. 
There is no "intuitively obvious" reason why a circle with a diagonal should mean "not" or a stick figure with certain garment styling should signify a particular gender's rest room. 
These conventions had to be learned laboriously and are far from universal. 
We have spent megabytes of bandwidth discussing this stuff and the proposals are still so vague as to present authors with no clues as to which set of clip art will become the heiroglyphs of the future. 
A football picture can be anything from meaningless to a depiction of a watermelon seed and associating it with the financial statement of the Green Bay Packers has zero informative value for the document in question. 
Love. 
ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE 
Lately, especially when I see the nine meg of unread mail from this group, I've thought about sending my unsubscribe note. 
But the following, copied from an e-mail I received back in '94 is more appropriate: "Rabbit's clever," said Pooh thoughtfully. 
"Yes," said Piglet. "Rabbit's clever." 
"And he has Brain." "Yes," said Piglet. "Rabbit has Brain." 
There was a long silence. 
"I suppose," said Pooh, "that's why he never understands anything."

I have to apologize for having read this out of context, i.e. not the rest of the site. 
I really do think it is a great start. 2 points 1 please provide a non textual entry point as and when possible. 2 I hope you will advise people to provide icons to be used to link to their site. 
Histories are difficult to navigate, mine off-line is a complex db with numerous hints to help me remember the 'type of garbage' there. 
Most of it by far is for clients use. 
Online it is as advertised nearly all graphical. 
The type of irritating banner animation is obviously to be avoided, as Anne suggests. 
Thanks I could not have collated that, it is just beyond me. 
Don't let it get left behind.
