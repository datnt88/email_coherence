<s> MK XQuery wanted to have a simpler function.  </s>
<s> A lot of the complexity of the document() function is concerned with resolving a relative URI against a base URI, and that functionality is (rightly) now available in separate functions, resolve-uri() and base-uri().  </s>

<s> This seems right, as durations typically have multiple years, hours,  </s>

<s> We use the singular forms for extracting year, month and day from  </s>

<s> We use the plural forms when we extract hours, minutes and seconds from  </s>

<s> fn:document() has been moved to the XSLT 2.0  </s>
