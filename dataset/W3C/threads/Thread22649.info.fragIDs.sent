<s> It has been a while since we didn't publish a new version of the Core draft.  </s>
<s> This new version contains almost our current state of thoughts regarding the Core module: New bits: - Merged DOM Level 2 Core and DOM Level 3 Core.  </s>
<s> - prefix/namespaceURI resolution algorithm - normalizeNS algorithm - Merged Embedded DOM and Core (section 1.1.10):  </s>
<s> * Improved Java bootstrapping for Embedded DOM * Embedded DOM function on Node interface (getAs) We are still working on a full conformance with the Infoset, especially for Namespace nodes.  </s>
<s> Next version should contain the complete mapping.  </s>
<s> Some issues from this mailing list are still on our agenda: default attributes, attribute value normalization, setNodeName, lots of clarifications... Feel free to send a reminder if your issue is not addressed yet.  </s>

<s> I guess the question really was: "are you ever going to combine all the DOM specifications into one document?"  </s>
<s> The appropriate response is: no, we have no plan to combine them.  </s>
<s> The document would be too big.  </s>
<s> If you're really looking for it, I suggest to take the XML sources, change one of the main documents as appropriate and regenerate a document using the DOM generator.  </s>
