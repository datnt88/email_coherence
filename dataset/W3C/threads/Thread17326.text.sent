Greetings All I would be interested to hear if list members consider a site map necessary for a site that has only five pages (making it 20% bigger). 
Cheers M Matthew Smith Kadina Business Consultancy South Australia If every page on your site is directly accessed via your primary navigation block, then that would in effect be your site map. 
IMHO it's not so much how many pages but rather how easy is it to navigate through your site. 
In your particular case, I would think that a site map would be redundantly redundant.

Web Accessibility Specialist / Co-founder of WATS.ca Web Accessibility Testing and Services To clarify, it seems that a block of links to each of the other 4 pages means you actually have a site map in every page.... Creating, in addition, an actual page that did this would make each page bigger, as well as the overall site. 
Anyone know what happens if you add "every conceivable piece of markup" and use the link element to point to the bar in the page?

Probably not. 
However, it would be for a site that had an ornate home page as one of the typical characteristics of site maps is simple styling which makes it very easy to recognize the links. 
Apart from the terminology I don't see any difference between a site map and a toc. 
The presentation for each is not fixed in stone so all we're talking about really is a way for a user top see where everything is in a site and, ideally, reach everything from a single page.

Most users understand the concept of table of contents much better. 
If a small web site should have a table of contents is only a question of such a table being useful or not. 
If all pages are covered by the main menu, a table of contents could still be useful if it is more detailed, etc. 
Since one of the most important virtues in web design is to keep it simple, a very small web site could easily do without a table of contents in many cases.

This might be true but many sites still use a site map, and search engines find them easy to spider. 
Also if I recall I believe the guidelines still refer to a site map. 
No matter if you call it a site map or a table of contents it's all the same in the end. 
However for a five page site I wouldn't use a site map especially if all the content is linked together in an easy to follow format. 
Best, Reagan D. Lynch I'd appreciate hearing the origin of this statistic. 
I would think that many users with cognitive impairments would appreciate a "map"- a map being a visual layout of the layout of a site. 
It's very different from a table of contents; it manages to show relationships without text explanation. 
Kind of like a map. 
A consideration for whether or not to use a site map could be who your audience is and what the content is. 
A science exploration site for grade schoolers may have it's ethos somewhat boosted by a graphic site map. 
A township's site showing office hours and contact information probably would not.

Download Penn State's visual identity marks: David R. Stong quoted me: and asked: I'd appreciate hearing the origin of this statistic. 
10 years ago it was the notion that a site map could be a visual representation of how a web site was organized. 
Such a site map was thought to help us find our way making it easier to navigate. 
But the idea never materialized except for rare probably only theoretical artistic cases, giving us millions of utterly useless "site maps", poor substitutes for good old-fashioned tables of contents. 
I don't remember ever having seen a useful implementation of the concept of a site map as a visual, even a 3D, representation of a web site. 
The idea turned out to be just another case of The Emperor's New Clothes. 
Cheers, Jesper Tverskov www.SmackTheMouse.com 
I haven't seen one to the extent that when I see the term site map I think of a cleanly formatted list of (nearly) all the pages on the site. 
This differs from my concept of a table of contents in its level of completeness and its like design obfuscation. 
What I understand by site map is desirable. 
It is not needed for small sites designed by people who respect accessibility, but I think it might be undesirable to remove the requirement, as it is often the only way of navigating typical commercial sites, and establishing a precedent for its removal in some cases may well cause it to be dropped in cases where it is valuable (even now it is typically a small print link at the bottom of the page and is probably there because they want search engines to be able to navigate the site, even if humans can't). 
I'm going to have to side with the view that the site map is inevitably dated. 
Jesper touched a good point where the site map seemed like the best solution to explain to users the semantic structure of a website but to add another tag to to the mix does not seem to make any sense. 
I use Semantic maps to show the layout in full to clients but thats it, normal users do not visualise their position in the layout of a website rather they just feel like they are making their own natural progression through a text. 
When a table of contents is the standard in all other literary texts why make another one for the web? 
After all the purpose of web accessibility is to create universal standards. 
Kevin McDonagh Apple Tv Design info@appletv.co.uk Kevin, in your note you say that you use a site map when you need to "show the layout in full to clients". 
That's an important time to make sure it's clear, and I can understand using a site map. 
I think there are many circumstances that are just as important and require the same sort of global clarity. 
I'm a designer; I think in pictures. 
Many people do. 
When I'm involved in my work, if someone interrupts and asks a question, it takes me a moment to respond because words aren't there. 
I like site maps when they're done well. 
I find the maps used by the National Gallery site when they have a special online show, for instance, to be invaluable for navigation as well as understanding how the site is inter-connected. 
So far there were several opinions about site maps saying they're dated or otherwise un-useful. 
Please realize that not everyone uses the Web the way you do, and certainly not everyone thinks of it as a book with linear layout. 
A site map can be a good thing, and if coded adequately can read as a table of contents to a screen reader or to those who turn images off.

Download Penn State's visual identity marks: I'd make the claim that this concept not only exist today, but should exist, and be used. 
However, it might be that we are thinking of different things. 
A "site map", to me, is a representation - one way or another - of where to find what on a website. 
I like to compare it to the catalogue of a library. 
A "table of contents", on the other hand, is a document-specific representation listing what exists, and where, in this specific document. 
Both are -highly- useful, and well known to most people from other works of life. 
I see, daily, sitemaps implemented as nested lists describing hierarchial websites which I find very, VERY useful. 
The concept of a non-hiearchial website might need a different implementation, but I've not seen any of those.

[+46] 0708 557 905 I've been following this thread off and on for a while, and figured I should add my two cents. 
Firstly, from a cognitive perspective a sitemap is quite useful. 
For those who like to see the content of a site from a single location, it helps them find information quickly by browsing a list of topics, and allows them to relate information by seeing how topics are positioned within a collection of ideas (talking from an instructional perspective). 
Personally, if a search feature on a site doesn't turn up the information I'm looking for, the sitemap is where I turn. 
I didn't catch the reasoning for deprecating sitemaps, though I can't think why this would be suggested. 
I would imagine that those who agree with deprecating sitemaps, are probably not global type learners, and probably have little utility for site maps. 
That's fine. 
If you have no use for a sitemap, you don't have to use it. 
There are still many of us who do find sitemaps very VERY useful (to quote Tina and a few others). 
In our work with accessibility, and there has been much of it, we take the position that transformation and adaptability are the key to accessible Web sites. 
If something is inaccessible to one person, it does not mean that that feature has to be removed to comply with access standards, it means in many cases that alternatives are required. 
By same token, if a sitemap is not useful to one user, removing it would reduce the accessibility (or rather usability) of a site for those who benefit from such a tool. 
"Sitemap" is now a fixture in the English lexicon (and other languages I'm sure), and it is quite unlikely it will go away any time soon. 
Better than trying to get rid of the concept, a formal description, or perhaps an operational definition of Sitemap would better serve the accessibility community, and Internet users in general. 
Whether you call it a sitemap or a table of contents, whether its presented as a list, a hierarchical presentation of topics, or a visual layout of a site, the purpose is to provide a "Big Picture" of the content, and make a site more easily browsable. 
:: transformable -- adaptable -- accessible :: greg Table of contents versus Site map What I find useful in a table of contents in a book is that there I have a listing of everything: Credits, Foreword, Preface, Acknowledgements, parts, chapters, appendixes, indexes, even CD-ROM Installation Instructions (!), etc. 
What is not in the table of contents is not in the book. 
This is a very generic and useful concept also for many web sites. 
In many books we also have something called "Summary of Contents", "Contents at a Glance", you name it, some filtered view of the table of contents. 
This is also a very generic and useful concept. 
On web sites we often have several such "Summary of Contents". 
The home page is often such a summary, having "channels" and linking to a lot of more about this and that, etc., and the main navigation on most pages is often also such a summary or even a full table of contents. 
We also have different types of contextual menus, submenus, bread-crumbs, quick menus, sitemaps, etc., not to mention search engines. 
The discussion is not that simple. 
What we need for most major web sites is an all inclusive table of contents organized not on the basis of a simple hierarchy and page numbers in order like in a book, and not on the basis of how pages happen to link to each other in a purely technical manner, but on how the contents are important and useful for real users. 
This is the only valid point of departure for a generic table of contents for web sites. 
It should be tested and refined over and over again in a usability test lab with real users and based on facts and real value. 
Such a table of contents, based on what is actually useful, could have many different views based on sorting and filtering when additional views are found useful. 
Such a table of contents could also have some additional or alternative views for special purposes based on other principles like automatic generated tree structures mostly associated with site maps, or even like boxes and rooms in a doll's house. 
But they should only be maintained if found useful in the long run. 
In many situations the detailed view in a table of contents should not be the default view, but we would prefer some "Summary of Contents" to be the default view and on some sites even the more fanciful visual boxes and "rooms". 
Site maps only play a minor part in the above analysis if any. 
The concept could have become the right generic term (map) for table of contents on web sites very different from books. 
But it has turned out to be too confusing and has been too misused to be worth building on. 
The concept of a table of contents is much more generic based on our experiences from a lot of areas. 
We are used to many more lists and tables than of maps most people only use occasionally. 
It is my guess that sitemap will go out of use just like surfers and other lovely but strange terms from the first decade of World Wide Web. 
Cheers, Jesper Tverskov www.smackthemouse.com 
Your detailed table of contents is what is generally called a sitemap, and certainly what I understood the guidelines to mean. 
Likewise.

[+46] 0708 557 905 Originally Sent On: Monday, February 09, 2004 4:15 AM (snip) I would disagree. 
I think a site map is useful for those who like to visualize where they are and where they can go within a Web site. 
A table of contents can create the same effect. 
I don't think there is much difference between a map and a table of contents - the information is virtually the same, no? 
Just the visual presentation is different. 
Visitor's to a large informational site I created (not in my portfolio), and which doesn't have a *search* feature, often use the sitemap but it looks more like a table of contents than a flowchart but it's neither. 
Now, one could say I haven't designed the navigation and/or structure well enough because visitor's are using the site map, this could very well be the case, but that's another post on another day. 
And there are always "power users", like myself, who will go straight to a search field or site map to scan what the site has to offer before I greedily devour its contents. 
Whether one sets up a sitemap as a table of contents or a flow chart diagram/semantic map, I think the objective is the same. 
Now, my question is, would it be OK to still call it: "sitemap" or "site map" if its just a set of links and not a visual representation. 
:) One definition I found(1) says this: "Sitemap A directory of one website with links to all of the pages on it." 
I personally like the word length of "sitemap" compared to "table of contents". 
Also someone pointed out that the search engines like site maps, this is my understanding as well. 
Certain keywords repeated throughout a site and on different pages can assist in a higher your page rank - then again, placing keywords strategically is supposed to be relevant and in context. 
I'm not suggesting unethical SEO practice. 
In the case of the person who questioned whether a sitemap was necessary for 5 pages, I would say they already had one if all there was was "top level pages" because navigational textual links on each page would do just fine. 
In addition, depending on the information on the site, they might want to include a table of contents and use link anchors where appropriate. 
"When a table of contents is the standard in all other literary texts why make another one for the web?" 
Because this is the web and we do things differently here. 
:=) I'm fairly sure that everything I wrote above is my opinion with a dose of fact thrown in here and there and I could be completely talking out of my ear so please be gentle.
