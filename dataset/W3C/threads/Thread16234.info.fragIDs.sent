<s> I have been given a second notebook to enable our CDstudents to trial linux.  </s>
<s> I am getting used to using jaws and ie5 and being able to tab around web pages, use shortcuts to open menus and jaws to hear what is going on.  </s>
<s> I've been trying jaws with netscape in windows, (until I have a linux speech synthesiser working.) altF opens the file menu and the down arrow navigates, but jaws does not give sound output.  </s>
<s> jaws does not read the page content.  </s>
<s> Also i cannot seem to navigate webpages using the tab button.  </s>
<s> Is it me?  </s>
<s> jaws seems to work with nearly all my windows applications except mozilla6/16.  </s>
<s> Bizarrely jaws even works with Clicker4 which has its own speech synthesiser, jaws speaking the menus whilst clicker speaks the content.  </s>
<s> What UA setup using linux would best replace jaws and ie5?  </s>
<s> Could someone please point me to some great linux accessibility links?  </s>
<s> ps you're not the only bunch i am pestering.  </s>

<s> Here is another article with correlations to the WAI.  </s>
<s> It's posted on cnet.com - I've clipped the end of it where non-PC web access techonology is discussed.  </s>
<s> Today's demonstrations represent an important technology shift as Armonk, N.Y.-based IBM looks beyond the PC.  </s>
<s> While Hortensius said he expects the PC's dominance to continue, its role will change.  </s>
<s> "The number of non-PC devices will proliferate rapidly," he said.  </s>
<s> "The non-PC style of access will become the dominant means of accessing the Internet."  </s>
<s> IBM is working on a number of hardware and software projects to enable Internet service providers and application service providers to deliver content suitable for any screen, from PCs to cell phones.  </s>
<s> In the case of the airline check-in handheld, IBM used its WebSphere software to take information from a mainframe, convert it to XML, and then bring it to the device.  </s>
<s> Michael Wirth, manager of IBM's Software User Systems Ergonomics Research (USER) division, called the XML translation process "the duct tape for the Internet."  </s>
<s> IBM isn't the only company looking closely at XML (Extensible Markup Language), a Web standard for exchanging data, which was the centerpiece of Microsoft's Next Generation Windows Services (NGWS) announcement last week.  </s>
<s> "We feel the NGWS announcement is a strong validation of where we have been going," Hortensius said.  </s>
<s> "But the devil is in the details," he added, referring to Microsoft's timetable and uncertainty about whether the software maker will support open standards or tie everything back to Windows.  </s>
<s> For its part, like the revamped voice-recognition technology launched last week, IBM is providing software tools it hopes developers will adopt for writing applications for both big and small devices.  </s>
<s> "Using our tools, it took just 5,000 lines of code to write the airline application," Wirth said.  </s>
