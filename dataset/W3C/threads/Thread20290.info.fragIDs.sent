<s> The fuzzy problem is Amaya tends to render content very oddly, munging two pages together, or rendering the html as if it is missing chunks, but this might be a problem with the ssh or jigsaw proxy I'm using ... The more substantive  </s>
<s> problem is that Amaya for Windows has some built in paths (for the .ini  </s>

<s> The best way to check that is to see the source view.  </s>
<s> If some content is within the source view but is not displayed in the formatted view, it could be either a Amaya bug or an error in the document structure.  </s>
<s> I met this kind of trouble when I dowloaded document with invalid height constraints.  </s>
<s> Could you check also that there no height attribute or a CSS constraint on the element.  </s>

<s> I probably need to check that on a Win2K machine and adapt the code.  </s>
