Hello, In the 9 March 2001 UAAG 1.0 [1], we refer to "single key" bindings in checkpoint 11.3 (we also refer to "modifier keys"). 
I think we need to clarify that this refers to actual physical keys on a keyboard, not signals sent by the hardware. 
The accessibility requirement involves limited physical movement. 
I would also note that I do not believe that there are any internationalization issues here. 
On systems where a user must use several keystrokes to compose a single (abstract) character, we still want single-physical-key access for users. 
Therefore I propose clarifying in checkpoint 11.3 that when we talk about "keys" we are referring to physical keys.

This would (could) lead a person to directly address the physical keyboard, which is a design that would bypass the AT that might be installed. 
If the UA is receiving input from the OS in the recommended way, it can't tell if the keystroke came from the physical keyboard, or from a Morse Code input system that is connected via a PCM/CIA or Serial port. 
Single key means single discrete action, as opposed to a long series of actions to activate the binding.

The device independence requirement is that key events not be hard-bound to physical keys on any specific keyboard device.? 
This can be satisfied at the same time that the User Agent provides the configurability. 
There are internationalization issues shot through the topic of key bindinds, but there is no necessary _conflict_ between device-adaptability for internationalization and the device-plus-user adaptation to make frequently used actions identified by the user readily available by binding them to single keypresses on whatever [international or assistive] key device the user has. 
I believe that what you meant is compatible with the device independence concerns and what Denis said. 
Let't go for actual draft replacement language and see if that passes muster. 
This was a little impressionistic. 
Al PS: On the other hand, the requirement of "at least a majority" of the default key bindings would seem to be infeasible in many situations.? The group should reconsider this language.? If the default key binding defines a full set of single-key plus two full layers of modified-key bindings, then there is _no way_ to reduce a majority of the actions defined [in the default key binding] to single-key bindings.? Never mind if there is a one-hand, large-key, or twelve-key device in use.? 
You just can't get there from here. 
What were we thinking?

For reference, here is the checkpoint: 11.3 Allow the user to override any binding that is part of the user agent default input configuration. 
Allow the user to override any binding in the default keyboard configuration with a binding of a single key and (possibly zero) modifier keys. 
Allow the user to assign a single key binding (with zero modifier keys) to at least a majority of the functionalities available in the default keyboard configuration. 
The user agent is not required to allow the user to override standard bindings for the operating environment (e.g., for access to help). 
The goal was to have a lot of single key activations. 
We were seeking something better than "a lot of". 
Suggestions welcome, _ Ian Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org) http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs Cell: +1 917 450-8783 I think there are two parts here: 1. 
Is that we mean single key activation for a certain set of functionalities in Checkpoint 11.3 (9 March draft). 
2. We require using the standard input APIs, so ATs could emulate the keypress and the User Agent would not know it came from an AT (Checkpoint 6.7, 9 March draft). 
I think Ian just wants to make 1 clearer, especially in the case of foreign languages which may have quite complex keyboards.
