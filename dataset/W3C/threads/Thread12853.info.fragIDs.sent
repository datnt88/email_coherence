<s> As some of you will know, it has always been my belief that web accessibility will be working well when individuals rather than organisations are creating accessible web pages.  </s>
<s> To that end, I'd like to mention one of the best websites that peepo currently links to http://www.magpol.org/s8/0.html  </s>
<s> (this is a personal view, it's a tough call) The website manager has made changes to the site that don't effect the appearance, but attempt to make it accessible within our current understanding.  </s>
<s> Jonathan In a way I suppose this is a request for more resources designed for the non-profit sector.  </s>
<s> We plainly are not meeting this need currently, and this is a significant sector of the whole market.  </s>
<s> Hello All, Jonathan asked me to post to the W3C guidelines.  </s>
<s> Jonathan makes a point (below) that the guidelines are unclear in some ways about how to make a site accessible.  </s>
<s> There are areas which leave things up in the air of course.  </s>
<s> In particular defining what it means for someone with a cognitive impairment is not well defined.  </s>
<s> I wonder though about not putting alt text in for images.  </s>
<s> That seems to me to be where the guidelines are most clear.  </s>
<s> Perhaps Jonathan could comment on clarity in more depth.  </s>
<s> Doyle Doyle Saylor Business Systems Consultant Intranet Hosting Services Wells Fargo Services Corporation Doyle, Perhaps you could post your comments to the list.  </s>
<s> This person genuinely believes they are following W3C guidelines, and over an exchange of a dozen e-mails has tried to develop the site to meet our understanding.  </s>
<s> You can tell there is a way to go, and much of this is because of a failure of clarity on the part of WAI. with regard to scripts, did you read: Client-side Scripting Techniques for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 Jonathan  </s>
<s> Doyle, (this is eo not gl) in brief the perceived WAI audience is seen to be government, commerce and web specialists, so WAI documents are designed as far as possible to suit this perception.  </s>
<s> There is a somewhat valid argument that as a 'standards' organisation this is appropriate.  </s>
<s> There is at least as valid a case that we need to address the needs of individuals* and to ensure that our advice is clear and unambiguous.  </s>
<s> Good examples are invaluable, the lack of them continues to make differentiation of the purpose of title and alt ambiguous.  </s>
<s> I have invited, Alan Firminger to join IG, though EO might potentially be a friendlier environment, he expresses interest in WAI and believes he has read and understood the guidelines.  </s>
<s> It is only by inviting contributions from members of the public, that we will fully understand the usability issues that are slowing our progress with this group.  </s>
<s> Are stats available that show the bulk relationship between professional and amateur authored pages?  </s>
<s> My feeling is that the latter is a far greater proportion ~10:1 perhaps or even 100:1, and one can only expect this ratio to increase as time passes.  </s>

<s> To give a particular example from http://www.peepo.com.  </s>
<s> We understand that the semantic web offers the opportunity to provide plain English executive summaries.  </s>
<s> None-the-less due to a paucity of online resources, for some topics we only have links to sites which use 'child friendly' illustrations, which some staff and students deem inappropriate for our adult users.  </s>
<s> You can imagine the necessary work; for instance in numeracy ludo is a useful game, the only online version i have found is in chinese, and has child friendly illustrations.  </s>

<s> It is not clear how alt/title text will work with SVG.  </s>
<s> In a similar way to drop down menus, tooltips are invaluable, yet SVG seems not to have standardised their usage, and there are undoubtedly reasons for this.  </s>

<s> Hi Jonathan, Thanks Jonathan for the much longer commentary.  </s>
<s> Also thanks for clarifying for the public that we are writing for EO (Education and Outreach) not GL (Guidelines).  </s>
<s> My interest is not exactly the same as yours, i.e.  </s>
<s> I am highly interested in the issue of cognitive disabilities (which I mean to cover more than the narrow focus some people have of the technical term) and accessibility.  </s>
<s> You wrote, There is at least as valid a case that we need to address the needs of individuals* and to ensure that our advice is clear and unambiguous.  </s>
<s> Good examples are invaluable, the lack of them continues to make differentiation of the purpose of title and alt ambiguous.  </s>
<s> Doyle, I don't see this as exactly an issue of individuals outside of organizations but how does one understand the networked social structure of IT.  </s>
<s> In other words I don't see in my mind that there is public mind outside what we are doing, but rather how does our structure work to admit any other mind into our work barrier free.  </s>
<s> That Web Accessibility means inclusion of everyone.  </s>
<s> That doesn't say what you write disagrees with that, but I focus on what you say here, You wrote, It is only by inviting contributions from members of the public, that we will fully understand the usability issues that are slowing our progress with this group.  </s>
<s> Doyle, I think it is good for the public to be a part of any of these discussions.  </s>
<s> Let's take Slash Dot as an example where a highly technical subject matter is open to the public for discussion.  </s>
<s> They have about 2 million subscribers in the last count, and a system for free expression.  </s>
<s> But what is missing from that public is the sense of how cognitive impairment shapes barriers in discourse.  </s>
<s> So I don't think of Slash Dot as a place for someone with Cognitive Impairment to go to get the latest about technology in a barrier free way.  </s>
<s> And therefore inviting individuals for participation has virtues but not a solution to the problem that we face with cognitive barriers.  </s>
<s> You wrote, My feeling is that the latter is a far greater proportion ~10:1 perhaps or even 100:1, and one can only expect this ratio to increase as time passes.  </s>
<s> We have perhaps fallen into the trap of believing that all sites are documents similar to those we create, and write our guidance for, whereas many sites in fact serve very different purposes.  </s>
<s> Doyle, In this case you refer to how the public creates their own pages.  </s>
<s> You make for example a crucial point in this comment, You wrote, Given that the site in discussion has 80 images and no text or sound, it would need a great story teller to maintain interest for a blind visitor, the challenge is well worth the effort.  </s>
<s> Do we even speak of story telling at WAI? Doyle, I don't think story telling is the way to approach the idea of Cognitive impairment.  </s>
<s> I prefer in theory Joint Attention theory in Cognitive Psychology as a means of addressing the technical issues of cognitive impairment.  </s>
<s> Any web page anyone makes is meant to share attention space/time with someone else.  </s>
<s> Some cognitive disabilities such as Autism are disabilities around the issue of sharing attention.  </s>
<s> What we don't adequately address in the technology is focus of attention and sharing attention in web pages.  </s>
<s> So if we invited a member of the public with Aspergers Syndrome (high functioning Autistic like symptoms to medicalize for a moment) would we have a means for them to participate in the EO or any other group in a barrier free way?  </s>
<s> Let me be more concrete about this issue.  </s>
<s> In Joint Attention theory, an infant gazes at a parental figure and realizes that the parent looks at them, and looks at other things.  </s>
<s> The child gazes at something the parent looks at and 'shares' attention.  </s>
<s> Essentially in each figures mind shares a sense that when each looks at something similar in mental activities happen, or share 'attention' structure in each persons brain.  </s>
<s> If mom looks at the toy, I am doing the same thing in my head.  </s>
<s> How could the technology possibly address these issues?  </s>
<s> And I would want this theorizing to include blind people who aren't going to share vision with someone.  </s>
<s> Technologically shared attention means that if you look at something I can cognate attention also at something we are sharing in the moment.  </s>
<s> So we are asking ourselves what is the shape and structure of shared attention (not a subset of shared attention like story telling).  </s>
<s> The technology of that is geographic realism (GPS and talking signs).  </s>
<s> We don't have consumer products that can address 'augmented' reality computing, but we have engineering research that points at this area N. Walking through a landscape and sticking information to the landscape is augmented reality (the U.S. military has some programs in this area) address that issue http://www.media.mit.edu/wearables/ cognitive disabilities meets Web Accessibility.  </s>
<s> So that for an Autistic person as they walk through a landscape a web page is presented to them as they gaze at the landscape in a usable barrier free way.  </s>
<s> For example, if I had a stroke and my frontal lobe was damaged, My attention structure would be greatly altered.  </s>
<s> My remaining living brain structures having spent a life time performing together with what is missing could still perform attention and probably want to share with others my attention.  </s>
<s> Do we have any sense of what that sharing might be like?  </s>
<s> If an average autistic person joins EO do we have a sense of sharing attention with them?  </s>
<s> That is where I think the most profound work lies ahead for Web Accessibility.  </s>
<s> This area lies at the heart of language (where Joint Attention theory is posited as the foundation for language) like use of the web http://citeseer.nj.nec.com/vertegaal99gaze.html.  </s>
<s> For anyone who can't read or write, or does not speak a common language shared attention is the barrier by which we strive to succeed.  </s>
