I haven't examined every accessibility verification tool out there, but it seems rather strange to me the ones I've looked at want me to manually examine each GIF file for flicker. 
Even *I* know that it's possible for a programmer to examine the contents of a GIF file and tell if it's animated. 
Are there any accessibility tools out there that check the GIFs for you and eliminate the ones that obviously aren't animated?

Non-animated GIFs flicker as well. 
If you have alternating dark and light pixel rows (which is more common than you might think) and you view the image on an interlaced display (my monitor is over 10 years old - it still works, so there is no point in sending it to ground fill) you get a half scan rate flicker. 
This is very distracting, although it may be too fast to be an epilepsy trigger. 
As far as I know there aren't any tools that do this. 
You're right, it was old news in 1999 that this is possible, so I imagine there are tools that do it.

Am I correct in thinking that it's not only the rate of change that matters, but the visual presence of the image in the page? 
I mean it's size, the proportion of the canvas that changes, maybe also the color contrast. 
It would be useful to be able to spider a site and know whether there are any animated GIFs or not.

Using M2, Opera's revolutionary e-mail client: http://www.opera.com/m2/ 
take a deep breath... and head for the frontline: $ find . 
-type f -iname "*.gif" -print0 | xargs --null --max-lines=1 identify | perl -nWe 'print "$1\n" if /(.*?)\[/;' | sort | uniq whew! that should produce a list of animated gif files. 
you'll need a standard unix compliment (find, xargs, perl, sort, uniq) and imagemagick (identify). 
there's probably an easier way... - p 
Hello All, Since Vincent's post we have had many people write us directly to ask the same question regarding the Cynthia Says Portal and Its capabilities for supporting this test. 
With this in mind we have modified the Web Based "Cynthia Says" solution to have a selection for you to test for animated gifs. 
Basically the testing of a .GIF 
file for more then one frame. 
This test was developed as an optional test to the tester. 
You must select the Checkbox: [ ] Test for animated Gifs - Could add time to processing The Test is optional because the Cynthia Says Tester tests only one page at a time and you can also see animated gifs when reviewing the manual accessibility checks on your page. 
This option prevents Cynthia from having to download every gif from your site associated with that page if you prefer to check for animated gifs manually. 
This feature is also coming out in our Cynthia Says Desktop Edition and Across all HiSoftware products. 
You can update your Cynthia Says Desktop edition by running the automatic update feature. 
These updates to the desktop software should be ready by 5pm today. 
The New Source for those who include this freely distributable form on their site will be available by the time this post gets distributed by the list serve. 
We appreciate all feedback on how we can develop solutions that make the task of validating electronic content, services, and applications easier for all to use. 
Thanks, Rob Yonaitis HiSoftware - http://www.hisoftware.com/co/yonaitis.htm

This is slightly different, but closely related: Deque http://www.deque.com/ 
creates a product called RAMP that detects unacceptable flicker rates and fixes them. 
From http://www.deque.com/products/rampsection508.htm : 
"Section 508 Paragraph (j) Pages shall be designed to avoid causing the screen to flicker with a frequency greater than 2 Hz and lower than 55 Hz. 
"Automatically detects flickering rates with unacceptable frequency Auto Remediation of animated gifs, marquee elements, and other blinking elements." 
I just happened to go to a product demonstration recently, but haven't had a chance to test it out for myself; they did use the product to change a gif during the demonstration and it seemed to work well.

in my tests of flicker rates, it is dependant on the system you use. 
It is quite possible that a flicker rate that is fast enough to over come the boundary on one machine will be slow enough not to on a slower machine. 
The idea of possibly looking at whether or not something will flicker is good but to "fix it" may not be. 
Also, this is fixable in some user agents depending on how it is implemented. 
I had not gotten into this discussion before now till it dawned on me that I don't notice flickering in pages even if they are supposed to flicker because my rendering engine prevents it. 
I use accessible testing tools to check for this anyway.

RAMP's pretty kludgy for such an expensive piece of software, but it does do a decent job remediating flicker rate. 
I think there's a lot of programming necessary to catch all the potential things that could cause a page to flicker. 
It's better as a user check; I think most people could tell whether or not their page could cause someone to have an epileptic seizure.

Yes, it is very true that there are numerous possible features (java, flash, javascript, movies, SVG, etc) that can be used to create flicker. 
And as Alan pointed out earlier, just picking up on gif images that change isn't enough. 
On the other hand for a site with several thousand pages where all kinds of content has been added to a template (think of a university) it is helpful to be able to check for things that are suspicious and will require manual investigation. 
A couple of examples: In the mid 90s I was briefly Webmaster for an Australian University. 
We knew we had thousands of pages on tens or hundreds of servers, but we didn't even know how many. 
Because University policy was to let people publish, and not get in their way too much (we could just afford to teach people who wanted to publish - we didn't have a review staff for every course page let alone every piece of information on a distributed multi-campus University) we had no way of finding out which pages might cause problems such as accessibility, or lynx capability (which was what students were using a lot). 
To be able to search a large Website automatically and flag the issues for further investigation is important. 
This is the same reasoning as picking suspicious-looking alt text and getting a person to review it - a large task becomes more easily manageable, and distributable. 
And finally it doesn't have to be a large organisation. 
With 20 authors most sites are essentially managed on trust rather than knowledge (unless the publishing systems are extremely inflexible), so QA tools that can check over the whole site for things that are more or less likely to be problems are very valuable. 
cheers Chaals (PS My apologies to deque: I had read that RAMP did some kind of checking for flicker).

Alternate scan lines dark and light falls right in the middle of this range, on an interlaced display. 
(Some sites actually use this pattern as their background image.)
