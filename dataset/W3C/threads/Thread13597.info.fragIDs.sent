<s> Hello, In regards to issue 681 [0], at the 25/26 June 2002 ERT WG F2F meeting, we all accepted* an action item to work on a test collection of EARL data.  </s>

<s> What needs to be done: - identify tools (to generate EARL) - find a place to store the data  </s>
<s> - determine what to test against Identify tools (to generate EARL) - Page Valet - ACCVerify - Mutat Also, we could convert existing test suite data to EARL, ala Ian Hickson's conversion of CSS Test Suite data.  </s>
<s> [2] Many evaluation tools generate XML and we could convert those to EARL, e.g. from LIFT, InFocus, etc. Hopefully those developers would be willing to help.  </s>
<s> (I've begun the process for LIFT data but have more to do...) Find a place to store the data We discussed an RDF store on the W3C site.  </s>
<s> Danbri and I talked about a possible joint trip to MIT to talk with Eric about this.  </s>
<s> As of yet, nothing is decided.  </s>
<s> Perhaps Danbri, EricP and I could get on the phone to discuss?  </s>
