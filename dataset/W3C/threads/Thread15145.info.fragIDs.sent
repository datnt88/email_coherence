<s> I agree with Emmanuelle, Charles and John that the list of ideas I compiled does not deal enough with the diversity of "plain language."  </s>
<s> Maybe a better approach is to get away from specifics and instead propose a list of guiding principles.  </s>
<s> These might be along the lines of: * "Use a form of sentence structure that is generally considered easy to understand in a particular language."  </s>
<s> * "Organize content in a way that is generally considered easy to understand in a particular language and for a particular use (such as instructions or correspondence or informational materials.) * "Use a form of address that is considered easy to understand in a particular language and for a particular use, yet is also culturally appropriate."  </s>
<s> And so on -- the point being to get people to think about what would constitute "plain" within the linguistic and cultural constraints of their own language.  </s>
<s> To follow from the article Emmanuelle listed, here is an e-mail from a Japanese woman who teaches English in Japan and is interested in plain language.  </s>
<s> I recently asked her what would be plain Japanese: Not being an expert on the Japanse language, I don't think we have such a plain Japanese campaign as you have a PE crusade in English speaking countries.  </s>
<s> I admit, though, that there are books on the market on "how to write" in Japanese.  </s>
<s> The books are, to all intents and purposes, meant to convery the same message as PE.  </s>
<s> And I may say safely that partly as a result of PE or Western culture, "Plain Japanese" has been gaining ground - especially, in business writing...Say yes or no at the beginning instead of at the end.  </s>
<s> The Japanese language writing is structured in the order of introduction, development, turn, and conclusion.  </s>
<s> Which means we don't know the conclusion until we come to the end of a message vis-a-vis at the beginning in PE.  </s>
<s> Thus, the traditional Japanese way of writing is neither efficient nor effective for business purposes; PE is catching attention as an example.  </s>
<s> In my opinion the Japanese language is, as a whole, more comlex and difficult to understand than the English language.  </s>
<s> This may have something to do with the differences in syntax and in culture.  </s>
<s> We have Japanese grammar.  </s>
<s> But I think English grammar is more systematic.  </s>
<s> In English you have a subject-verb-object construction.  </s>
<s> We have more "freedom."  </s>
<s> Sometimes the subject is omitted - and is so recommended, especially, "I." And the verb comes at the end.  </s>
<s> Which means we know only at the end if the answer is yes or no.  </s>
<s> In between there are a posse of vague and ornate phrases and words.  </s>
<s> Impatient listeners tend to demand, "So, what's your conclusion?"  </s>
<s> Neither do we have a sense for "paragraphing."  </s>
<s> One paragraph /one sentence is the day of order.  </s>
<s> Or one paragraph contains lots of ideas: past, present, and future.  </s>
<s> And it's understood in Japanese but not in translated English.  </s>
<s> On the cultural front, in Japan we're given to read between the lines of the other: guts feeling (haragei or stomach reading).  </s>
<s> We've been taught not to say no directly.  </s>
<s> but indirectly.  </s>
<s> Instead we expect the other to read into us even if we don't explain in so many words.  </s>
<s> But this is changing, especially in business writing.  </s>
<s> Plain Japanese is gaining ground.  </s>
<s> It's in the diaper stage, though.  </s>
<s> I like Avi's suggestion that we consider offering a list of principles, on the order of those he lists.  </s>
<s> But the specifics are valuable, too; perhaps we can move them into something like a techniques document for writing; there might even be different "writing techniques" for different languages.  </s>

<s> But the "can be tested" and "serve the needs of people with disabilities" values can pull us in different directions, here.  </s>
<s> And there are different ways to be specific.  </s>
<s> Lisa has once again raised the idea of a weighted-factors scoring scheme, on the premise that the success levels on the various testable scales are somewhat fungible.  </s>
<s> For some of our sub-factors this could be true.  </s>
<s> Think of weighted factors as late binding to quantization for those factors which are continuous variables as measured, not intrinsically pass/fail.  </s>
<s> It just give us the tools to fit the rating function better to the available prognostic knowledge.  </s>
<s> Finely-divided pass-fail tests with boolean rollup give the guideline writer better *control* over what the author does.  </s>
<s> But flexible scoring which weights and accumulates the quantitative results on different axes may give the content producers using the guideline better prognostic *information* as to the usability they can expect.  </s>
<s> We should balance our pursuit of these two ends.  </s>
