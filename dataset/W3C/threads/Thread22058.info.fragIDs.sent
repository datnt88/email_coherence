<s> I believe there's a naming conflict between the load element of the test suite and the load method of DocumentLS in DOM L3 Load &amp; Save.  </s>
<s> This is what my generated dtd says about load: !ATTLIST load var CDATA #REQUIRED href CDATA #IMPLIED uri CDATA #IMPLIED obj CDATA #IMPLIED interface (DocumentLS) #IMPLIED willBeModified (true | false) #REQUIRED And here's a part of my test: load var="result" obj="documentls" uri="TEST1" willBeModified="false" interface="DocumentLS"/ Which has an attribute willBeModified which is added because it is required in the dtd.  </s>
<s> It should be eliminated.  </s>
<s> Here's the java code generated by the stylesheet: documentls = (DocumentLS) document; result = load(""); I assume the stylesheet is looking at the href since it assumes this a load by the framework instead of DOM L3-LS.  </s>
<s> Any idea ?  </s>

<s> I committed two small changes to test-to-java.xsl and dom-to-dtd.xsl.  </s>
<s> In test-to-java, I changed the test on the template that produces the framework load from: to xsl:template match="*[local-name() = 'load' and not(@interface)]" mode="body" That should let an DocumentLS load fall through to the DOM method generation code.  </s>
<s> In dom-to-dtd.xsl,  </s>
<s> I made willBeModified optional to be consistent with the schema.  </s>
<s> Please let me know if these adequately address the issue.  </s>
<s> Both the dtd and the generated java test are ok now.  </s>
<s> Thanks !  </s>
