Charset aliases: NONE Suitability for use in MIME text: NO Published specification(s): The IETF registration imposes one additional constraint: if there is no initial BOM then the byte-orientation must be big-endian. 
That is, in any stream that does not begin with the (hex) byte sequence 00 00 FE FF all of the bytes are interpreted as big-endian. 
Note: This is parallel to the IETF registration of UTF-16. 
As defined by the Unicode Standard Version 3.1, without a BOM the byte orientation of UTF-32 and UTF-16 could be either little-endian or big-endian. 
The choice of byte orientation would be determined by a higher-level protocol. 
The IETF registration is such a protocol, and constrains the byte orientation to be big-endian for determinant interpretation.

Intended usage: LIMITED USE I approve of the registration of the 3 UTF-32 charsets. 
Harald, charset reviewer Dear IANA, This mail is more than half a year old. 
Harald has approved the registration of UTF-32, UTF-32BE, and UTF-32LE. 
However, I have not found them in your list at Can you please update that list at your earliest convenience? 
Many thanks in advance! 
Regards, Martin.

note: in this paragraph, 00 00 FE FF needs to be replaced by FF FE 00 00 - the example is big-endian. 
Apart from that - PLEASE get it done; this has been waiting far too long. 
Harald Martin and Mark, Big apologies for the delay.
