<s> I propose that by convention all OWL fragments are given using the reader-friendly abstract syntax, rather than the parser-friendly XML syntax.  </s>
<s> Personaly, I cannot read OWL fragments well enough to be motivated to ever understand the details, so I tend to skip over them.  </s>
<s> Even when I can get motivated, it takes way too much time.  </s>
<s> I would argue very strongly that any public documents published by this WG do use the more readable syntax.  </s>
<s> Why not get used to it when we communicate with each other?  </s>
<s> It will also make it easier to grab things from discussions in the archive and plunk them into documents, instead of having to translate into the abstract syntax suitable for the public.  </s>
<s> Of course, if the discussion is about parsing, or about the syntax of the language, then it is better to use the parser-friendly syntax, both for internal discussions and for publised documents.  </s>
<s> What do people think about this suggestion?  </s>
<s> If the overwhelming majority of this WG actually PREFER to read the parser-friendly syntax, then perhaps I'd best get used to it, but it there are many like me, it makes sense to use a more reader-friendly syntax.  </s>

<s> Are there other concrete experience on that, not only theoretical considerations?  </s>
<s> Seems like there are not so many people exploring the terminology-ontology interoperability.  </s>
<s> Or are they?  </s>
<s> I am not sure if Bernard's concern is only about subject hierarchies or about mixing ontologies and terminologies in general.  </s>
<s> If it is the former, than the message below is not very relevant.  </s>
<s> For the latter, here are a few words from the experience in a number of medical-informatics projects in our lab.  </s>
<s> In our experience, the issue of linking ontologies and terminologies comes up often.  </s>
<s> There is no lack of (often reasonably well-structured) controlled terminologies in medical informatics, using them makes sense both from reusability and interoperability perspectives.  </s>
<s> However, in our projects and their ontologies, it inevitably led to mixing classes and instances, and we really didn't find any practical workarounds (although admittedly we were not wedded to DLs, so didn't look too hard).  </s>
<s> Consider for example clinical guidelines (again, this is a practical example from a couple of kb-based systems here).  </s>
<s> A specific clinical guideline (an instance of a class Clinical Guideline) represents the tests, decisions, etc. in diagnosing and treating a particular ailment.  </s>
<s> One of the reference terminologies used here is that of drugs.  </s>
<s> (cf Chris's message later: a drug hierarchy is not a partonomy, it is indeed a subclass hieararchy.  </s>
<s> You have beta-clockers, and specific types of beta-blockers as subclasses, etc.).  </s>
<s> So, a specific instance of a clinical guideline must refer to classes of drugs to be prescribed.  </s>
<s> Again, at a particular step in a guideline you want to prescribe a specific beta-blocker.  </s>
<s> But you want this guideline to be retrieved when looking for all guidelines using beta-blockers.  </s>
<s> Note, the guideline really refers to a class of drugs and not a specific bottle with pills.  </s>
<s> We have had exactly the same experience in using thesauri for annotating art collections.  </s>
<s> For example, the value for the "style" property of a painting is taken by us from the AAT (Art and Architecture Thesaurus) hierarchy of styles and periods.  </s>
<s> Even for seemingly simple attributes like "color" we have found this feature: we cannot treat the color value as a simple instance from a flat value space, as color subtleties can be key issues in art objects (e.g. porcelain) and the thesauri, like AAT, thus contain elaborate color hierarchies (e.g. vivid-pink subClassOf pink).  </s>
<s> [Note: some parts of the style/period hierarchy are in fact based on parts (periods).  </s>
<s> An important practical point however is: these thesauri are out there and they represent community consensus.  </s>
<s> Are we going to discard them because they model the world in the "wrong" way?]  </s>
<s> Interestingly enough, we have also encountered some problems with putting classes as values for Dublin Core elements.  </s>
<s> The maim problem is: how do you define the value type for the Dublin Core slot.  </s>
<s> Our tool uses this to present the annotator with the right subtrees in the thesauri to choose a value for this slot.  </s>
<s> One way to do this is to define for every slot a metaclass that has the top nodes of the subtrees as its instances.  </s>
<s> But that does not lead to the intended semantic interpretation which is: all classes in the subtrees are valid slot fillers.  </s>
<s> In other words, there seems to be no way to express in OWL the Protege notion of "AllowedClasses", in which you define the value type of a slot through a set of classes, with the intended interpretation that all subclasses of these classes are legal slot values.  </s>
<s> The approach we have recently been using actually avoids the use classes-as-instances. Take this example: This is a piece of our OWL ontology for VRA [1].  </s>
<s> [NOTE: VRA is a specialization of Dublin Core for visual resources [2].  </s>
<s> The VRA spec defines the VRA elements as specialization's of DC elements.  </s>
<s> This is reflected in the OWL ontology through subproperties, thus allowing for DC's dumb-down principle.  </s>
<s> Note that if the DC elements have been defined as OWL annotation properties, this piece of OWL is actually not OWL DL but OWL Full.]  </s>
<s> The value type of "style/period" (see the union) is specified here through the two top nodes of the relevant subtrees in the AAT hierarchy (&amp;aat;50111078 and &amp;aat;50111079).  </s>
<s> Assume we have a painting for which we want to define the style/period value of "Cubism".  </s>
<s> Cubism is a class in one of the subtrees, so it would not be a legal value.  </s>
<s> Instead, we store an anonymous instance of "cubism".  </s>
<s> In fact, there is something to be said for this solution: the style of a painting is not cubism but some expression of cubism.  </s>
<s> Likewise, a painting is not "blue" but some expression of blue.  </s>
<s> Sorry if this is confusing.  </s>
<s> We have had many long internal discussions about this, and it is difficult to summarize.  </s>
<s> Some of these considerations you can also find in our KCAP'01 paper "From thesaurus to ontology" [3].  </s>

<s> My $0.02:  </s>
<s> - I find it very surprising that anybody believes that any single syntax will do for all purposes, and all audiences.  </s>
<s> So at least, in the WG documents, you should think who the intended audience of the document is, and what is most suited for them.  </s>

<s> Yes. (It's very tempting to stop there ...) Ideally if a1 and a2 are abstract syntax trees and g1 and g2 are RDF graphs and a1 maps to g1 and g2, and also a2 maps to g1 then at a first approximation they all have the same OWL DL semantics (a1 and a2 with the direct semantics, g1 and g2 with the RDFS compat semantics).  </s>
<s> So that "should not interfere" is correct.  </s>
<s> However, if what you want to do is to use some OWL Full feature, it is not clear at all whether or not the (weak and unproven) semantic guarantees involved in the mapping are appropriate.  </s>
<s> e.g. foaf uses Inverse Functional Property on DatatypeProperties.  </s>
<s> Basically if what you want to talk about is soemthing to do with OWL Lite or OWL DL, then the abstract syntax is appropriate, but using it to talk about dc:creator say does not work because it forces you into making decisions that are not appropriate for dc:creator.  </s>
<s> Jeremy  </s>
<s> I don't think so - I tend to agree with Frank that there isn't a single answer.  </s>
<s> It may be helpful to have a tutorial on the abtsract syntax, but that won't make the universal answer.  </s>
<s> One of the aspects of the syntax shock is that it is so XML unfriendly, making a more friendly XML syntax for RDF I suspect would make it even less palatable to naive users.  </s>
<s> There is not one 'syntax shock' but many: RDF/XML is a compromise between pressures in different directions.  </s>
