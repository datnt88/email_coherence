<s> developers no insight into what is most helpful.  </s>
<s> It would be an unfortunate omission not to give clear examples to guide developers to avoid awkward implementation.  </s>
<s> Examples: NCSA Mosaic 2 &amp; up use Keypad Left &amp; Right Arrows to move the Link Anchor while B &amp; F change pages which is a huge distance to move over the keyboard to give commands using one digit.  </s>
<s> Using those Arrow keys leaves no way to move over wide pages left &amp; right within a UA window, such shortcomings can be minimized through suggestions in this document.  </s>
<s> Since the Web is nearly all made up of pages it is vital that browsing commands be placed close to the page movement keys in the keyboard Keypad area.  </s>
<s> Reinforcing that placement is the use of ENTER as "get link/start action" key.  </s>
<s> Now to specify recommendations.  </s>
<s> Only 2 items need to be added to the UA document to clarify how keyboard commands will much increase Web Accessibility.  </s>
<s> Section 2 Point 4 says: "Provide tools to navigate the document: from link to link, form control to form control, frame to frame, etc. Allow navigation through keyboard at all times."  </s>
<s> Add to 2nd sentence: "using the shortest possible keyboard commands so that the keyboard experience approximates the one click ease of using a mouse."  </s>
<s> This explains why very short keyboard commands are necessary &amp; specifies mouse like easy of use via keyboards as an idealized goal.  </s>
<s> Section 6 of the UA document deals with Navigation issues so keyboard strategy should be dealt with in it.  </s>
<s> Perhaps as a 2nd paragraph in the Introduction or as its own 6.x Subsection.  </s>
<s> Ideas in it will guide developers when adding Accessibility features.  </s>
<s> "People with various physical disabilities travel the Web via keyboard with only one finger, a headwand, or otherwise have very limited dexterity.  </s>
<s> Easy keyboard browsing commands on the main keyboard make browsing enjoyable.  </s>
<s> The page movement keys (Up, Down, &amp; so on) in the Keypad area are often used to move Web pages so placing keyboard browsing commands nearby eliminates jumping over the whole keyboard to give commands.  </s>
<s> That the Keypad area, &amp; NumberPad also, exists shows good reason to cluster keys with related functions.  </s>
<s> With ENTER as the "get link/start action" key two sets of one keystroke browsing commands would be in ease reach.  </s>
<s> Yet having browsing commands in one large block is troublesome for people lacking fine motor control as they are apt to slid on to nearby keys.  </s>
<s> To lessen chances of hitting another key command keys are best isolated by keys with no commands (just as Keypad keys have some empty space around them).  </s>
<s> Because the rows of keys across keyboards are offset from those above &amp; below there is less chance of sliding up or down to hit incorrect keys.  </s>
<s> Placing browsing commands in columns should let people watch the Web, not the keyboard.  </s>
<s> The most used commands would be best put in a column nearest ENTER.  </s>
<s> For example, with Page Next &amp; Back on "=" &amp; "[" above Link Anchor Up &amp; Down on ";" &amp; "." (perhaps CONTROL could Modify the Link keys to move the Anchor 6 Links) choosing links requires little movement around the keyboard.  </s>
<s> Using one keystroke commands also reduces typing which helps unsteady people as they hit the wrong key more often than most."  </s>
<s> A few details could be added, yet it seems timely to sent the Group a draft now.  </s>
<s> About placing one keystroke browsing commands on the main part of the keyboard it is notable that Microsoft has long seen given people with physical disabilities extended keyboard controls.  </s>
<s> Software turns the Number Pad into a keyboard mouse where individual keys &amp; keystrokes together emulate a mouse; the Gray + key does a double-click that likely is the easiest double-click around!  </s>
<s> Keypad keys are one keystroke commands, as are the Function keys so one keystroke commands are common to Windows.  </s>
<s> Seen combined with the separate keys that create the software mouse seems that using single keys on the main keyboard for browsing isn't such a new feature for Windows.  </s>
<s> Instead it is a terrific extension of a long Microsoft policy of giving people with physical disabilities necessary tools to cope with a GUI.  </s>
<s> Accessibility features Default to Off so very few people would notice the browsing commands.  </s>
<s> Accepting one keystroke browsing commands would continue Microsoft's policy of giving buyers what we need.  </s>

<s> I am concerned that we don't have specific navigation strategy.  </s>
<s> Saying that the shortest number of keystrokes should be used may end up with very different and incompatible navigation strategies that will only serve to confuse.  </s>
<s> I don't have a recommendation to toss in here but we should look at this issue in detail.  </s>

<s> I fully agree.  </s>
<s> But the builder's of current OS platforms resisted more specific ideas because they interfere with the overall scheme of the platform.  </s>
<s> It seems to leave Accessibility as a secondary issue.  </s>
<s> It would be terrific if vendors took action to show a commitment to keyboard navigation; deeds speak.  </s>

<s> Being one of the people who "resisted more specific ideas" I'm curious how my comments got interpreted to mean that accessibility was secondary.  </s>
<s> Good usability is the first priority of any user interface designer.  </s>
<s> If the keystrokes are different between each application - how does that help accessibility?  </s>
<s> I only mean to say that any recommendations are obviously going to have to fit into platform that the browser is running on.  </s>
<s> Are you going to force people to not use the Command Key on a Macintosh or to use CTRL+Z on a PC because they are close together (but conflict with the existing Undo action of CTRL+Z?) I'm interjecting common sense, not placing accessibility second.  </s>

<s> Following on what Charles (Chuck) Oppermann said, It sounds like Microsoft may be willing to reserve specific key combinations to support a specific navigation strategy in their standards.  </s>
<s> Am I interpreting your message correctly, Chuck?  </s>
<s> If so, it's a great opportunity.  </s>
<s> If the Mac standard ends up being slightly different from the Windows standard, we'll still be ahead of where we are now.  </s>
<s> Has anyone compiled a matrix of reserved key combinations and their functions on various platforms, like Ctrl-Z on Windows?  </s>
<s> And perhaps more important, unreserved key combinations?  </s>

<s> I don't want the discussion on this list to focus on issues of developer intent and/or their commitment to disability access.  </s>
<s> We are here to discus issues surrounding User Agent access features.  </s>
<s> If anybody has a compliment, complaint or comment surrounding a particular developers commitment to disability access, there are plenty of other forums to express your concerns.  </s>
<s> This type of discussion on the UA list only leads to alienation of working group members and hardening of views on issues related to the guidelines.  </s>

<s> Am I interpreting your message correctly, Chuck?  </s>
<s> I know my reply to this is late, but it's a important reply.  </s>
<s> To be perfectly clear - my opinion is that the goal of the guidelines should be to inform browser manufactures of the needs of people with disabilities and *recommend* what the browser should do in certain user/author scenarios.  </s>
<s> Given that, I don't believe it's necessary, nor practical to recommend specific keyboard sequences.  </s>
<s> It should be noted in the guidelines that whatever keyboard model is used should be consistent with the keyboard model in place in the users platform.  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> Has anyone compiled a matrix of reserved key combinations and their functions on various platforms, like Ctrl-Z on Windows?  </s>
<s> And perhaps more important, unreserved key combinations?  </s>
<s> Does Microsoft maintain such a list for its standards, Chuck?  </s>
<s> We do have the Windows Keyboard Guide on http://microsoft.com/enable/, but it does not have a matrix like you wish.  </s>
<s> It's a project that I want to work on in a few months.  </s>
