This is a review of the UA draft as of 13 July 1998 relating to people with physical disabilities as requested by Jon Gunderson. 
To effectively use the Web this group has few extra requirements, at least in the way of Tags, so it isn't surprising physical disabilities aren't mentioned on the WD. Calling for keyboard navigation is good &amp; meets most needs, except it gives 
developers no insight into what is most helpful. 
It would be an unfortunate omission not to give clear examples to guide developers to avoid awkward implementation. 
Examples: NCSA Mosaic 2 &amp; up use Keypad Left &amp; Right Arrows to move the Link Anchor while B &amp; F change pages which is a huge distance to move over the keyboard to give commands using one digit. 
Using those Arrow keys leaves no way to move over wide pages left &amp; right within a UA window, such shortcomings can be minimized through suggestions in this document. 
Since the Web is nearly all made up of pages it is vital that browsing commands be placed close to the page movement keys in the keyboard Keypad area. 
Reinforcing that placement is the use of ENTER as "get link/start action" key. 
Now to specify recommendations. 
Only 2 items need to be added to the UA document to clarify how keyboard commands will much increase Web Accessibility. 
Section 2 Point 4 says: "Provide tools to navigate the document: from link to link, form control to form control, frame to frame, etc. Allow navigation through keyboard at all times." 
Add to 2nd sentence: "using the shortest possible keyboard commands so that the keyboard experience approximates the one click ease of using a mouse." 
This explains why very short keyboard commands are necessary &amp; specifies mouse like easy of use via keyboards as an idealized goal. 
Section 6 of the UA document deals with Navigation issues so keyboard strategy should be dealt with in it. 
Perhaps as a 2nd paragraph in the Introduction or as its own 6.x Subsection. 
Ideas in it will guide developers when adding Accessibility features. 
"People with various physical disabilities travel the Web via keyboard with only one finger, a headwand, or otherwise have very limited dexterity. 
Easy keyboard browsing commands on the main keyboard make browsing enjoyable. 
The page movement keys (Up, Down, &amp; so on) in the Keypad area are often used to move Web pages so placing keyboard browsing commands nearby eliminates jumping over the whole keyboard to give commands. 
That the Keypad area, &amp; NumberPad also, exists shows good reason to cluster keys with related functions. 
With ENTER as the "get link/start action" key two sets of one keystroke browsing commands would be in ease reach. 
Yet having browsing commands in one large block is troublesome for people lacking fine motor control as they are apt to slid on to nearby keys. 
To lessen chances of hitting another key command keys are best isolated by keys with no commands (just as Keypad keys have some empty space around them). 
Because the rows of keys across keyboards are offset from those above &amp; below there is less chance of sliding up or down to hit incorrect keys. 
Placing browsing commands in columns should let people watch the Web, not the keyboard. 
The most used commands would be best put in a column nearest ENTER. 
For example, with Page Next &amp; Back on "=" &amp; "[" above Link Anchor Up &amp; Down on ";" &amp; "." (perhaps CONTROL could Modify the Link keys to move the Anchor 6 Links) choosing links requires little movement around the keyboard. 
Using one keystroke commands also reduces typing which helps unsteady people as they hit the wrong key more often than most." 
A few details could be added, yet it seems timely to sent the Group a draft now. 
About placing one keystroke browsing commands on the main part of the keyboard it is notable that Microsoft has long seen given people with physical disabilities extended keyboard controls. 
Software turns the Number Pad into a keyboard mouse where individual keys &amp; keystrokes together emulate a mouse; the Gray + key does a double-click that likely is the easiest double-click around! 
Keypad keys are one keystroke commands, as are the Function keys so one keystroke commands are common to Windows. 
Seen combined with the separate keys that create the software mouse seems that using single keys on the main keyboard for browsing isn't such a new feature for Windows. 
Instead it is a terrific extension of a long Microsoft policy of giving people with physical disabilities necessary tools to cope with a GUI. 
Accessibility features Default to Off so very few people would notice the browsing commands. 
Accepting one keystroke browsing commands would continue Microsoft's policy of giving buyers what we need. 
Thanks for readings.

I am concerned that we don't have specific navigation strategy. 
Saying that the shortest number of keystrokes should be used may end up with very different and incompatible navigation strategies that will only serve to confuse. 
I don't have a recommendation to toss in here but we should look at this issue in detail.

I fully agree. 
But the builder's of current OS platforms resisted more specific ideas because they interfere with the overall scheme of the platform. 
It seems to leave Accessibility as a secondary issue. 
It would be terrific if vendors took action to show a commitment to keyboard navigation; deeds speak.

Being one of the people who "resisted more specific ideas" I'm curious how my comments got interpreted to mean that accessibility was secondary. 
Good usability is the first priority of any user interface designer. 
If the keystrokes are different between each application - how does that help accessibility? 
I only mean to say that any recommendations are obviously going to have to fit into platform that the browser is running on. 
Are you going to force people to not use the Command Key on a Macintosh or to use CTRL+Z on a PC because they are close together (but conflict with the existing Undo action of CTRL+Z?) I'm interjecting common sense, not placing accessibility second.

Following on what Charles (Chuck) Oppermann said, It sounds like Microsoft may be willing to reserve specific key combinations to support a specific navigation strategy in their standards. 
Am I interpreting your message correctly, Chuck? 
If so, it's a great opportunity. 
If the Mac standard ends up being slightly different from the Windows standard, we'll still be ahead of where we are now. 
Has anyone compiled a matrix of reserved key combinations and their functions on various platforms, like Ctrl-Z on Windows? 
And perhaps more important, unreserved key combinations? 
Does Microsoft maintain such a list for its standards, Chuck?

I don't want the discussion on this list to focus on issues of developer intent and/or their commitment to disability access. 
We are here to discus issues surrounding User Agent access features. 
If anybody has a compliment, complaint or comment surrounding a particular developers commitment to disability access, there are plenty of other forums to express your concerns. 
This type of discussion on the UA list only leads to alienation of working group members and hardening of views on issues related to the guidelines. 
Please let's put our energies into focus on the issues.

We are working on the keyboard navigation section. 
We should have a new set of guidelines by next week.

Am I interpreting your message correctly, Chuck? 
I know my reply to this is late, but it's a important reply. 
To be perfectly clear - my opinion is that the goal of the guidelines should be to inform browser manufactures of the needs of people with disabilities and *recommend* what the browser should do in certain user/author scenarios. 
Given that, I don't believe it's necessary, nor practical to recommend specific keyboard sequences. 
It should be noted in the guidelines that whatever keyboard model is used should be consistent with the keyboard model in place in the users platform. 

Has anyone compiled a matrix of reserved key combinations and their functions on various platforms, like Ctrl-Z on Windows? 
And perhaps more important, unreserved key combinations? 
Does Microsoft maintain such a list for its standards, Chuck? 
We do have the Windows Keyboard Guide on http://microsoft.com/enable/, but it does not have a matrix like you wish. 
It's a project that I want to work on in a few months.
