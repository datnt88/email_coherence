I contacted a number of you earlier to discuss the possibility of cancelling the AU face to face meeting on February 25th in France because of a conflict with the IMS Accessibility meeting occurring in Sydney on the same day. 
A number of AU members belong to the IMS working group. 
The IMS meeting has now been cancelled. 
Consequently we will be holding the AU meeting on the 25th and 26th. 
It will be a working meeting with very specific tasks related to the techniques. 
I will not be able to attend but Jan will be chairing on my behalf. 
It is likely that some of the IMS members who are not now going to the IMS meetings will attend to discuss harmonization of specifications. 
Please contact me if you have questions or concerns. 
Jutta Jutta I think we can do useful work and this is a good arrangement. 
I am wondering if, as the W3C meetings could include IMS people, we should aim for having the AU meetings AND the IMS meeting - so 25/26 for W3C, 27 for W3C plenary and 28/1 for IMS? 
I think that if we can get some of the IMS folk working with us on techniques, that would be great! 
It should be really helpful to them too. 
I have written this in response to questions from Cathleen.

The correct URL is http://www.w3.org/2001/07/allgroupoverview.html, previous references in e-mail &amp; minutes pointed to the meeting back in 2001, same time, different year and different place. 
I'm still planning to attend but don't have approval yet.
