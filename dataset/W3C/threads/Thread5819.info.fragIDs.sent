<s> Some brief comments on the latest version of the OWL Abstract Syntax document (prompted by trying to use the abstract syntax in a tutorial style document).  </s>
<s> o The mixed use of "feature=X" and "feature(X)" forms is ugly and potentially confusing -- e.g. cardinalities use "()" and someValuesFrom uses "=".  </s>
<s> Why not stick to one or the other?  </s>
<s> o There are places where parsing could be unnecessarily tricky, i.e., something like "union ( person restriction (...))" where restriction could actually be a class called restriction or the start of some restriction syntax.  </s>
<s> Tidying up the syntax a little and adopting some consistent conventions (e.g. keywords always followed by parentheses) should alleviate both these problems I think.  </s>
<s> Cheers, Sean Sean Bechhofer seanb@cs.man.ac.uk  </s>
<s> Sean raises a number of points here that are somethat more than editorial changes, but are not big changes.  </s>
<s> I have made changes to the abstract syntax document to address his concerns.  </s>
<s> The changes amount to: 1/ Using keyword(...) uniformly throughout the document.  </s>
<s> 2/ A few other minor changes.  </s>
<s> Parsing the revised OWL Abstract Syntax does require a bit of lookahead,  </s>
<s> but it does fit within yacc, except for restrictions where it is difficult  </s>
<s> to distinguish between restrictions on datatype and individual properties.  </s>

<s> Isn't that a contradiction in terms?  </s>
<s> I thought with an abstract syntax, you just got handed parse trees.  </s>
<s> There is no parsing.  </s>
<s> Now you're talking about implementing the abstract syntax, and you're treating comments on it as "more than editorial".  </s>
<s> This is taking on the character of a presentation syntax, not an abstract syntax.  </s>
<s> I'm concerned that this distracts readers from understanding the actual syntax of OWL, which is RDF/XML syntax.  </s>
<s> "RESOLUTION: The meaning of an OWL document is conveyed in the RDF graph" "RESOLUTION: The exchange language for OWL is RDF/XML " -- minutes Apr 2002 ftf I note that the WG hasn't taken any decisions about the role of the abstract syntax in our design (except to publish a WD to get feedback).  </s>
<s> From the feedback we're getting, I'm opposed to the continued use of the abstract syntax in our design work.  </s>
