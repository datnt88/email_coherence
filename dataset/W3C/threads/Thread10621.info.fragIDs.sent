<s> With reference to: (19 June 2003 editors' draft) As I said in an earlier message, I think this is looking pretty close to ready.  </s>
<s> My most serious comments are to section 5.1.  </s>
<s> I repeat my suggestion that any working group discussion in the telecon be based on the editors' draft reviewed here, rather than attempt to push out a new release.  </s>
<s> BTW, the date in the editors' draft URI is misleading.  </s>
<s> Section 1, final para, editorial: Suggest: "applications in the primer" -- "applications mentioned in the primer"  </s>
<s> Section 1.1, 2nd para, editorial.  </s>
<s> "RDF's abstract syntax is a graph..." I think the first two sentences of this paragraph are out of place, and suggest they be moved up to a new final paragraph in section 1.  </s>
<s> No wording change needed.  </s>
<s> Section 2.1, final bullet, editorial.  </s>
<s> The term "lingua franca" should not be italicized (at least, according to my Oxford dictionary)  </s>
<s> Section 3.4, second para, significant.  </s>
<s> s/arc/predicate/  </s>
<s> Section 3.4, 4th para (just after bulleted list), editorial.  </s>
<s> Strictly speaking "which" is incorrect here.  </s>
<s> Use "that".  </s>
<s> Section 3.5, 1st para, editorial suggestion.  </s>
<s> The word "object" is used in two different senses in the first two sentences.  </s>
<s> Suggest replace "two objects" with "two things" (twice in first two sentences).  </s>
<s> Section 5, definition of "lexical space", maybe significant.  </s>
<s> The definition isn't clear about what is meant by a "string".  </s>
<s> I suggest adding: ", which are sequences of Unicode characters".  </s>
<s> Section 5, para 5, editorial suggestion.  </s>
<s> "A datatype is identified by one or more URI references."  </s>
<s> While strictly correct, I'm not sure that "one or more" adds any important information, reads awkwardly and possibly confusingly.  </s>
<s> I would be inclined to delete it.  </s>
<s> Section 5, final bullet, significant.  </s>
<s> "however these facets cannot be accessed by any standard method within RDF."  </s>
<s> This is possibly not necessarily true or maybe just confusing.  </s>
<s> (e.g. suppose the XML schema group define RDF vocabulary for datatype facets: wouldn't that be a "standard mechanism within RDF"?) Suggest: "however, RDF does not define a standard mechanism to access  </s>
<s> these facets."  </s>
<s> Section 5.1, "The lexical space", final bullet, maybe serious.  </s>
<s> The phrase "start and end element" seems wrong to me.  </s>
<s> I think this should  </s>
<s> be just "element" or "start and end element tags".  </s>
<s> Section 5.1, lexical-to-value mapping, muddled?  </s>
<s> I don't understand this, and it seems over-complicated.  </s>
<s> My understanding is that we decided that XML literals are self denoting  </s>
<s> like plain literals, hence the lexical mapping maps the lexical value to  </s>
<s> itself.  </s>
<s> The surrounding description of the lexical space and the value space, which are both canonical XML, supports this view.  </s>
<s> Section 6.4, 3rd para (just after numbered list), editorial.  </s>
<s> I think this description of disallowed octets could be confusing.  </s>
<s> For example, the current work-in-progress draft of RFC2396bis [1] uses '['...']' in IPv6 literals in the 'authority' component of a URI, and requires them to be escaped everywhere else.  </s>
<s> I think the problem stems from the dual purpose of escaping in URIs (to  </s>
<s> protect special characters from interpretation, and to include otherwise  </s>
<s> disallowed characters in a URI.  </s>
<s> I'm not sure how to fix this, other than  </s>
<s> to suggest maybe "less is more"; e.g. "The disallowed octets that must be %-escaped include all those that do not correspond to US-ASCII characters, and any others that would otherwise be interpreted inappropriately according to the URI specification and URI  </s>
<s> scheme specification concerned."  </s>
<s> [1] http://www.apache.org/~fielding/uri/rev-2002/rfc2396bis.html  </s>
<s> Section 6.5, para 1, editorial.  </s>
<s> I'm not sure what "named" means here.  </s>
<s> Suggest drop this word.  </s>
<s> Section 6.5, para 4, 2nd Note, editorial.  </s>
<s> (a) s/tag only relates to/tag relates only to/ (b) I initially misread "typed data" here to mean something "user keyed data".  </s>
<s> Suggest s/typed data/data of some type/, or something like that.  </s>
<s> (or "data values"?)  </s>
<s> Section 6.5, para 4, 3rd Note, editorial suggestion.  </s>
<s> I found this was unnecessarily diffident about what it was saying.  </s>
<s> Suggest: s/implicitly/consequently/ s/is not intended to/does not/  </s>
<s> Section 6.6, para 1, editorial.  </s>
<s> While I (think) I understand the intent, I realized I don't really know  </s>
<s> what "pairwise disjoint" means: can you add a less mathematical  </s>
<s> explanation of this?  </s>
<s> Section 6.6, para 2, editorial.  </s>
<s> The previous para has just referred to three different sets, so I suggest: "Otherwise, this set of blank nodes is arbitrary."  </s>
<s> Section 6.6, implementation note, editorial.  </s>
<s> This note seems to be misplaced.  </s>
<s> It appears at the end of a section about blank nodes, but actually talks about rdf:XMLLiteral representations.  </s>
<s> I think it really belongs (possibly with some massaging of the example) just before section 6.1.  </s>
<s> That's all.  </s>

<s> One small nit.  </s>
<s> Section 3.5 of Concepts cites an example (Figure 5) from the Primer.  </s>
<s> In response to comments that the Primer examples should be more "international", "zip" has been changed to "postalCode" in the current Primer editor's draft (it's still Figure 5).  </s>

<s> I am unlikely to respond in detail before the telecon, just picking up on 5.1 comments:  </s>
<s> discuss at telecon ...  </s>
<s> This is in response to an editorial comment from XML Schema WG; I will double check (their comment was about the term "root element tag")  </s>
<s> discuss at telecon "maps a string to the corresponding exclusive Canonical XML " click though on exclusive canonical XML to "XML that is in exclusive canonical form" look up to see that "The exclusive canonical form of a document subset is a physical representation of the XPath node-set, as an octet sequence, produced by the method described in this specification" i.e. the value space of XMLLiteral is a set of octet sequences whereas the lexical space is a set of strings (character) sequences.  </s>
<s> I pass on whether { 173 } is both a character sequence and an octet sequence.  </s>
<s> ditto for {} (which is exclusive canonical XML if it is an octet sequence)  </s>
<s> Hmmm ... I think that's trying to jump ahead of rfc2396bis - and basically given the state of the TAG issue IRI Everywhere, we should really only be treading water.  </s>
<s> I don't feel strongly.  </s>
<s> As far as I'm concerned, just make a decision.  </s>
<s> Hmmm... My point was one of terminology rather than substance of the change.  </s>
<s> Er, I hadn't appreciated that distinction.  </s>
<s> Now I see why the wording seems so convoluted.  </s>
<s> In case I'm not uniquely ignorant in these matters, it might be worth adding a note pointing out that C14N defines a mapping from a string (using XML syntax) to an octet sequence encoding of that string.  </s>
<s> (Though I now like XML literals even less.  </s>
<s> I fear they could be a serious drag on getting widespread full implementation of RDF/XML.  </s>
<s> I'm not sure if that I'll ever bother.)  </s>
<s> I'm not trying to suggest we be tracking RFC2396bis ... I just used that as an example that sprang to mind about the difficulty of deciding what should be escaped.  </s>
<s> Another example: the mid: scheme has a syntax like mid: message-id / content-id the '/' character can appear within the message-id or content-id, and according to the mid: spec it must be escaped to prevent confusion with the '/' that separated the two parts.  </s>
<s> Hence my comment about the dual role of escaping in URIs.  </s>
<s> Thinking some more, how about this:  </s>
<s> "The disallowed octets that must be %-escaped include all those that do not correspond to US-ASCII characters."  </s>
<s> My rationale is that any other disallowed character should already be escaped in the Unicode form of the URI.  </s>
<s> I'm almost tempted to say nevermind... if we're just copying the  </s>
<s> recommended XML 1.1/I18N text, we can blame any inconsistencies on them ;-) #g Graham Klyne PGP: 0FAA 69FF C083 000B A2E9 A131 01B9 1C7A DBCA CB5E  </s>

<s> I think this  </s>

<s> I hate to suggest it but, how about: ** TODO Note: the lexical space and value spaces differ in that the lexical space is a set of Unicode strings, whereas the value space is a set of UTF-8 octet sequences.  </s>

<s> No changes made - this area is a mess I look forward to being able to defer to IRI spec as an erratum - we got through last call with the current text - I agree it is fragile.  </s>
<s> I prefer to leave it, since it emphasises that a typed literal is different from a plain literal with a language tag not only because RFC 3066 is a different set of strings from URIs, but because the second component has a different name.  </s>
