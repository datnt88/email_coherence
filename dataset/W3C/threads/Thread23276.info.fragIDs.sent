<s> Can someone clarify the getElementsByName method for me.  </s>
<s> It appears in DOM1  </s>
<s> but not in DOM2 or DOM3 WD.  </s>
<s> I see that it exists both in IE6 and in NS6 -  </s>
<s> although it doesn't seem to work on the SVG documents that I have tested it in.  </s>
<s> Has it been removed from the spec?  </s>
<s> If not should it be available on documentElements other than the html element.  </s>
<s> For example should it be available on the svg element?  </s>
<s> Thanks in advance, Jonathan.  </s>
<s> It's in DOM2 HTML (not DOM Core).  </s>
<s> And therefore it is not guaranteed to be present for things like SVG.  </s>
<s> Boris 617-864-9910 If you put garbage in a computer nothing comes out but garbage.  </s>
<s> But this garbage, having passed through a very expensive machine, is somehow ennobled and none dare criticize it.  </s>
<s> I see.  </s>
<s> Thanks Boris.  </s>
<s> Can I suggest that getElementsByName would be just as useful in other things (as well as HTML).  </s>
<s> In fact often even more so.  </s>
<s> In HTML many  </s>
<s> collections already exist, but not so for something like SVG. Hence if I create some radio buttons in an SVG document and give them all the same name I don't have the advantage of a collection ready made as I would in HTML.  </s>
<s> It would be very useful if getElementsByName was moved back to DOM-Core.  </s>
<s> Is there any reason that it was thought to be specific to HTML?  </s>
<s> Can I have your thoughts please?  </s>
<s> Jonathan.  </s>
<s> "Name" is not a defined concept that crosses all markup languages expected to be processed through the DOM.  </s>
<s> It's quite HTML-specific.  </s>
<s> We already have getElementsByNodeName.  </s>
<s> DOM Level 3 will presumably introduce the ability to retrieve elements by ID attribute, as part of the DTD/Schema support.  </s>
<s> A schema-specific set of APIs could support Keys as well.  </s>
<s> And of course you can always write a NodeFilter and plug it into a TreeWalker or NodeIterator -- which may not be as highly optimized as the above, but allows you the flexibility to define your own behaviors.  </s>
<s> Or -- assuming it survives into the REC and your DOM implements it -- try the XPath API.  </s>
<s> So there are lots of possible ways to address this use case in a more general and portable manner.  </s>
<s> I don't see a need to add getElementsByName, specifically, to the core DOM.  </s>
<s> Now, if the SVG DOM APIs wanted to add this method to _their_ APIs, because it was meaningful to them -- more power to them.  </s>
