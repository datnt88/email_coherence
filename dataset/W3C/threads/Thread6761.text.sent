I don't think it's a good idea to have both as a subset of This duplication will lead to confusion. 
I think we should only carry forward the second one, the Manual of Style, using a checkpoint layout with priorities 1, 2, 3 (much like the WAI guidelines), and assign P1 to pubrules checkpoints, with a policy enforcing level A. We also need to understand how the QA Spec guidelines (no PD yet, but talking about conformance assertion, testability of specs, etc) is going to integrate and interface with these/this documents. 
That looks a very reasonnable proposal. 
We'll have to think about the process part of such a merge, since pubrules are a quite sensible subject (changes must be approved by the team, announced to the chairs). 
Dom Dominique Haza?l-Massieux - http://www.w3.org/People/Dom/ W3C's Webmaster Having a unique document, albeit longer, doesn't preclude us from generate P1 views, or easy-to-check checklist, out of it. 
The advantage would be to - only carries one set of requirements, no duplicate - more easily evolve requirements from MAY to SHOULD to MUST (by just changing the priority level) - the use of a more familiar framework of guidelines/checkpoint that will foster the adoption of the less important points (because you can claim AA) I'm not sure I agree. 
Pubrules are hard and fast rules; if you don't follow them, publication is rejected. 
It should be kept as short as possible. 
The style guide is on a different level. 
It tries to help editors, and contains many things that may be obvious to people who are used to technical writing, and many things that one could also do another way, and where it is good to have some help, but if somebody has good reasons, they should be able to do things somewhat differently. 
The style guide is already long, and can get longer.
