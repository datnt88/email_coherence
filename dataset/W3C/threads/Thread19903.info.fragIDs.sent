<s> The DeleteElement now takes a second argument, pDoc, but Amaya code isn't passing that argument.  </s>
<s> Should I not be trying to use these versions together, or is this just a brief incompatibility that I happened to unluckily stumble upon.  </s>
<s> Is this obvious patch the right one?  </s>
<s> Thanks, Greg  </s>
<s> This isn't directly related to the previous post but it reminded me of a problem related to Thot.  </s>
<s> I don't remember where I first found a link to the Thot site but it doesn't seem to be from the Amaya pages.  </s>
<s> I see Thot mentioned in several places, but none of them are links.  </s>
<s> At a minimum, there should be a link to the Thot site from the Source pages and/or a local copy that the Amaya team has used to build the current version of Amaya.  </s>

<s> The Amaya distribution is complete as it is, so the Thot toolkit is distributed with Amaya.  </s>
<s> The pointer to Thot was removed just because people were confusing.  </s>
<s> However we are happy to let know that Amaya is the result of our previous research activity at INRIA.  </s>
<s> I will add in http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User page a link to Thot (http://www.inrialpes.fr/opera/Thot.en.html) Regards Irene.  </s>
