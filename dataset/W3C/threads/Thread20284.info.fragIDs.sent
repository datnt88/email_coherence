I have run into this install problem again: libwww is installed gmake[2]: Leaving directory `/home/hgs/Amaya/Amaya/Sun-Sparc-Solaris-2.5.1' gmake[2]: Entering directory `/home/hgs/Amaya/Amaya/Sun-Sparc-Solaris-2.5.1/thotlib' gmake[2]: Leaving directory `/home/hgs/Amaya/Amaya/Sun-Sparc-Solaris-2.5.1/thotlib' gmake[2]: Entering directory `/home/hgs/Amaya/Amaya/Sun-Sparc-Solaris-2.5.1/tablelib'

I don't know if there is a good fix for this or not, but I do know there is now: shtool, which is intended to replace install.sh 
See or I have not explored this package at all, myself, so cannot comment further on it.

The problem here is not with install-sh itself, but rather, it's due to the fact that `../install-sh' is an incorrect path to this script at the time it's being invoked. 
Therefore, if `install-sh' was replaced with `shtool' and if nothing else was changed in the build process, an identical error would occur if the build were trying to invoke `../shtool install'. 
In the above case, was the configure script run as `../configure' from within the `Sun-Sparc-Solaris-2.5.1' directory? 
And then, was `gmake' 
run from within that same directory? 
I used to get similar errors until I did this.

Agreed. 
Also agreed. 
The information about shtool was for information. 
However, I imagine from the description of shtool that changing to shtool would necessitate re-examining this, and it hints that there may be improvemnts in portability, too, from my reading of the page. 
Yes, and yes.

A solution for you is to give an absolute path for install-sh by this way: rm Options config.cache 
# get rid of old stuff INSTALL=~hgs/Amaya/Amaya/install-sh ../configure options... 
A solution for amaya developers may be to set an absolute path in configure.in: 
AC_PROG_INSTALL prog="${INSTALL##*/}" # prog=$(basename $INSTALL) dir="${INSTALL%/*}" # dir=$(dirname $INSTALL) cd "$dir" INSTALL="$( pwd )""/$prog" cd - AC_MSG_RESULT([install is now $INSTALL]) maybe this should be mentioned to autoconf people. 
That is an elegant one for me. 
Thank you. 
thanks for helping them out, too.
