<s> I note that in the DOM level 2 Events spec, the load event is specified only for a document, frameset and object, not for img.  </s>

<s> Hi Andrew,  </s>
<s> You can preload images via JavaScript.  </s>
<s> This is how some designers change  </s>
<s> images on mouse over by changing the image from their preloaded image array.  </s>
<s> According to HTML 4.0, script is allowed in head, and my recollection is that head is guaranteed to be loaded first.  </s>
<s> I'm not sure on the loading thing though.  </s>
<s> Hope this helps, Eric :-)  </s>
<s> That's out-of-scope for the DOM, of course.  </s>
<s> We just provide hooks; implementing script/ and so on is left to higher-level code.  </s>
<s> I believe the reason we mention Load events only in conjuction with specific nodes is to avoid breaking existing scripts.  </s>
<s> HTML says explicitly which nodes will receive this event; if others start getting it, page behavior might change.  </s>
<s> (Folks mayt not be checking the target node, so a new Load might cause a listener to fire at the wrong time.) Note that if the higher-level code fires any event event against a node, the DOM doesn't care which node it was -- it just propigates the event through its normal capture-and-bubble sequence.  </s>
<s> So if your code sent a Load event to an img/ , the right thing would happen.  </s>
<s> But it seems that the HTML 4.01 spec says that won't happen automatically in a normal HTML DOM.  </s>
<s> It sounds like what you really want is an HTML extension, not just a a DOM extension.  </s>
