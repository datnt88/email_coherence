With ARP I found three more tests that fit into our current framework useful. 
These are attached. 
Two empty-property-element ones have a property element with just a processing instruction and just a comment in. 
An id-and-about one showing to give an rdf:about complementing the rdf:ID in rdfms-difference-between-ID-and-about/test2.rdf (assuming rdfms-difference-between-ID-and-about/test2.nt is updated to be correct). 
I could add them to our test repository for consideration if people want. 
Jeremy Please go ahead. 
I'm in the process (slow) of tidying up the TC document; will have another run through TCs later today.

Unfortunately, I have a very good idea how fast my keys are moving. 
Aaron: please read this message. 
Jan: I have added: test016.rdf 
test016.nt 
test017.rdf 
test017.nt in I have added: test3.rdf 
test3.nt in about/ I have modifed the Manifest.rdf 
file in both of these directories (was that the right thing to do). 
They include the new tests. 
I also added a test:issue and a test:description to the PENDING test2.rdf in rdfms-difference-between-ID-and-about. 
I also modified test2.rdf and test2.nt in rdfms-difference-between-ID-and-about to conform with the WG decisions on non-Ascii characters in URIs. 
I have modified the file Overview.html in rdfms-difference-between-ID-and-about since I have just noticed that it does not give access to the new tests when navigating by directory. 
I also deleted the heading "Resolution" in this file, since it is misleading; the actual resolution appears to be: "The new syntax WD resolves this issue."
