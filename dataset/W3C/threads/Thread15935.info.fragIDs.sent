<s> I've just downloaded pwWebSpeak evaluation copy and am just learning about web accessibility issues.  </s>
<s> I am about to seek work as a web designer who wants to make the web what it should be, available for ALL.  </s>
<s> My question is, does the evaluation copy come with voice synthesizer, i.e.: SoftVoice or do I need to get that separately?  </s>
<s> I'm hoping to play around with it this weekend and assume any tech support they may have is Mon.-Fri.  </s>
<s> Thanks, and good list serve -- I've already learned allot since joining!  </s>
<s> No, pwWebSpeak doesn't come with a voice synthesiser - you have to get that seperately.  </s>
<s> cheers Charles McCathieNevile  </s>
<s> to follow up on what Charles McCathie Nevile said:  </s>
<s> The demo that I got last month included the software synthesizer.  </s>
<s> Worked in a reasonably vanilla Win95 environment with a sound card.  </s>
<s> Al Guy, Did you get your install key?  </s>
<s> You have to do that by email and yes, it involves a person at the other end.  </s>
<s> ProdWorks is a small business.  </s>
<s> I believe that the entire online help is on the Web in public, so the first [and second?] round of questions for support can possibly be avoided if you RTFM.  </s>
<s> Al  </s>
<s> Oh. Cool.  </s>
<s> The version I got didn't.  </s>
<s> It was an evaluation version only - maybe that was the reason?  </s>
<s> (If I knew, I have forgotten) Charles  </s>
<s> The documentation comes with it.  </s>
<s> If using Win 95, got to programs and look in the pwWebSpeak folder.  </s>
<s> Its in there.  </s>
