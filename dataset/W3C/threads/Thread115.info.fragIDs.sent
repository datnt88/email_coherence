<s> Several have commented that the "clown" that should be in the top left hand corner is some times all over the place depending upon which version of browser, particularly Netscape, they are using.  </s>
<s> That is to be expected.  </s>
<s> Your "clown" image is being positioned with the in- line style "position: absolute; left: 14; top: 26".  </s>
<s> This is CSS2, and support for CSS2 is inconsistent among browsers.  </s>
<s> I have also used W3C HTML and CSS validation service which indicate a truck load of errors, all rather meaningless to this novice.  </s>
<s> Two of your validation errors are related to your "clown" image.  </s>
<s> You're specifying the position for the "left" and "top" and as "14" and "26" -- but 14 and 26 what?  </s>
<s> Pixels?  </s>
<s> Inches?  </s>
<s> You must specify a unit, so that the browsers will know how much space to leave.  </s>
<s> Browsers are supposed to ignore improper CSS, but some do and some don't (and are instead making assumptions about what you meant, which may or may not be what you intended).  </s>
<s> I am not a programer and never intent to be;  </s>
<s> You don't need to be a programmer to use HTML and CSS, but unless you restrict it (via "Tools | Page Options | Compatibility"), FrontPage is going to use advanced features that have limited availability, and you do need to understand what those features do and how well supported they are on the browsers your audience will use.  </s>

<s> So is Tidy for me?  </s>
<s> Tidy is a good tool for turning invalid HTML into valid HTML.  </s>
<s> However, to do so, often Tidy has to guess at what you meant to do.  </s>
<s> It does a very good job but cannot guess correctly every time, so a better approach would be to attempt to write valid HTML initially and let Tidy correct the occasional mistake.  </s>
<s> Will it fix my Frontpage2000 problems?  </s>
<s> Even if you correct your positioning syntax, that won't mean that a given browser will support a feature that it didn't support before.  </s>
<s> It will mean that you will have the highest likelihood of success in getting browsers to render what they do support properly.  </s>
<s> Can I incorporate it into Frontpage2000?  </s>
<s> I don't know what you mean by "incorporate."  </s>
<s> You can run Tidy on pages produced by FrontPage as a separate step.  </s>
<s> Which Tidy program would suit me: Tidy.exe or TidyGUI (I run Win 98se)  </s>
<s> Use Tidy if you prefer to work from the command line, or use TidyGUI if you prefer to work with windowed dialogs.  </s>

<s> You might want to check out HTML-Kit.  </s>
<s> It's an HTML editor which integrates with tidy and does a whole host of useful stuff (too much to mention here).  </s>
