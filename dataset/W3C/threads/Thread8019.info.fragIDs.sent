<s> URI/binding protection works with this model also.  </s>
<s> J.  </s>
<s> I totally agree.  </s>
<s> The only way to make sense of the 2518 locking semantics is to associate the lock with the URI.  </s>
<s> Then the *effect* of that URI lock is to restrict updates to the resource currently mapped to that URI, or in the case of a depth-N lock, any resource mapped to a URI that has the locked URI as a prefix, and has no more than N segments following that prefix.  </s>
<s> We then overload the DELETE and MOVE methods to not only unmap the resource at the specified URI, but also delete the lock associated with that URI (and all locks associated to an extension of that URI).  </s>
<s> We can use the shorthand "write-locked resource" to mean "a resource whose write access is limited by a lock", but the lock itself is on a URI, not a resource (which is why the lock does not move with the resource).  </s>
<s> A "lock-null resource" is a mechanism (hack :-) for exposing a lock when there is no resource currently mapped to a locked URI.  </s>

<s> Bits snipped, all IMHO.  </s>
<s> As usual, corrections please.  </s>
<s> I think the lock applies to the URIs and any descendant of it.  </s>
<s> Imperfect example is a file system implementation.  </s>
<s> Infinite depth lock is applied to a directory and all its descendants (sub directories and files).  </s>
<s> Oh and of course, as HTTP/WebDAV are "root directory" based, a request with infinite depth lock on root (if permitted) would lock the entire server.  </s>
<s> Yes this does have uses, e.g. an administrator wants to perform a backup but nobody can make changes in the meantime.  </s>
<s> RFC2518 sec 8.10.3 states that "locks apply to resources, not URIs" and "LOCK request on a resource MUST NOT succeed if can not be honored by all the URIs through which the resource is addressable."  </s>
<s> If you think about it, the first statement makes sense when you consider the second statement.  </s>
<s> However, I think the server applies locks to resources, but our visualisation is that locks apply to URIs.  </s>
<s> See above.  </s>
<s> Depends on what you mean.  </s>
<s> A resource can have one or more URIs mapped to it (RFC 2518 sec 5.1).  </s>
<s> The resource would be locked and thus all the URIs that map to it.  </s>
<s> So no matter what URI (that was mapped to the resource) that was used by the client, the resource would appear to be locked as far as the client is concerned.  </s>
<s> However, none of the descendants would be locked.  </s>
<s> Correct, although you might want to word it a little different - "descendants" is probably better.  </s>
<s> As stated above, a resource MUST NOT be locked if the lock cannot be honored by all the URIs which address it.  </s>
<s> You shouldn't have an occurrence where a resource is locked, but using a URI that maps to it indicates the resource isn't lock.  </s>
<s> So in *theory*, you shouldn't have to check all the URIs because any of the URIs (that map to the locked resource) can be used to discover that the resource is indeed locked.  </s>
<s> Of course, its all a lot simpler if your server only supports one URI per resource.  </s>
<s> It makes the understanding of locking a lot easier :-) Regards Shaun Hall Xerox Europe  </s>

<s> Note: I will be arguing vigourously that we delete the "locks apply to resource, not URIs" phrase from the next draft of 2518.  </s>
<s> I believe this statement has proven to be very confusing and misleading.  </s>
<s> We should replace this with "a lock is on a URI, and a resource is locked if it is mapped to a locked URI".  </s>

<s> Yes, you'd probably want to supplement this statement to make sure it is not misunderstood.  </s>
<s> Something like: "but the lock controls access to that resource, even when that resource is accessed through another URI".  </s>
<s> As stated above, a resource MUST NOT be locked if the lock cannot be honored by all the URIs which address it.  </s>

<s> So in *theory*, you shouldn't have to check all the URIs because any of the URIs (that map to the locked resource) can be used to discover that the resource is indeed locked.  </s>
<s> Yes, the protocol does require that all the locks that affect a resource (from any URI) appear in the DAV:lockdiscovery property of that resource, so you just need to look at that property.  </s>
<s> Now an implementation may implement that property by a scan against all locks that exist on a URL that is mapped to that resource, but that's an implementation choice.  </s>
<s> Of course, its all a lot simpler if your server only supports one URI per resource.  </s>
<s> It makes the understanding of locking a lot easier :-) Yes, 2518 largely ignores the use case where one resource is mapped to multiple URI's (thus there was no BIND method, and DAV:lockdiscovery did not expose the URI that was locked).  </s>
<s> But we'll fix all that in the upcoming new draft of 2518 (:-).  </s>
