Hello, 
You may remember hearing about the LogValidator [1] project being developed by the QA activity at W3C. 
This website log analysis (and validation) tool is entering today a beta test phase, with a tentative stable release date around the end of March 2003.

As a companion to this tool, I have written, with the help of the QA team and contributor Kim Nylander an article covering the simple ideas behind this tools, also acting as a tutorial. 
[2] [2] http://www.w3.org/QA/2002/09/Step-by-step 
The ideas presented in this document are quite simple and could be summarized as follows: - if you have many things to do and little time to do it, you start with what's most important - for a webserver, what's more important is what gets more traffic - analysing your webserver logs can tell you what resources need love and caring - we have developed a flexible tool for that purpose I believe the Log Validator (with the help of this article) is potentially a very helpful Web Quality tool. 
The public-qa-dev community can help make it possible by: - Reviewing the tutorial - Participating in the Public Beta Test for the Log Validator - Talking about it within the Web Community, inviting people to use and review both the tool and its tutorial. 
Thank you. 
olivier.

The idea looks good, also... at the home page of LogValidator[1] The link anchor to the beta download section has two hash marks and needs to be fixed. 
Found at page text - NEWS! *Public beta Test* of the Log Validator, February 28th, 2003 - March 28th, 2003.
