Requesting permission to translate : "XML in 10 points" in Greek language. 
Regards, Fotis Kouretas Martin, I have requested permission, with the following mail. 
to translate "XML in 10 points" in Greek a week ago, but I haven't got an answer yet. 
Following the conversation with Petr Riha to the list for the translation in Czech of the same document I believe that I should wait for an answer, since this is not a specification. 
(Petr got a "herewith granted permission") - For other documents, you need permission, because we have the copyright in these documents and because copyright law does not allow translation (which is a 'derivative work') without the permission of the copyright holder. 
I was very well defined for which documents you need permission for translation. 
But it is not clear how you will get the permission to do the job. 
Regards, Fotis This request is hereby granted. 
Regards, Martin.
