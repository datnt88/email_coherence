<s> I understand that as: is it actually allowed (in copy/move/delete) to use multistatus to report problems on destination resources?  </s>

<s> I would expect a server to report this 403 on the destination inside a 207 multistatus.  </s>
<s> I don't like this for the simple reason that clients need hardcoded information about each DAV:error _and_ they need to know how to handle HTTP status codes.  </s>
<s> So I would prefer to use existing HTTP status codes over new DAV:errors.  </s>
<s> Otherwise you need to define also DAV:destination-is-not-accesible, DAV:destination-parent-is-locked, etc.  </s>

<s> Indeed.  </s>
<s> So I'll have to take this back.  </s>
<s> But how well will this interoperate?  </s>
<s> If the href in multistatus only lists the destination URI, it will be non-trivial to find out which source could not be copied/moved, right?  </s>
<s> So to make this fly, I'd expect the response element *also* to tell me which source resource was affected by the problem on the destination.  </s>
<s> RFC3253 already goes this way, simply for the reason that it's hard to define new HTTP status codes, but it's simple to define new error elements (because this solves the issue of namespacing the new codes automatically).  </s>
<s> "Simple" clients will just see 403 (won't work no matter how hard you try) or 409 (it failed, but there's something you can do about it).  </s>

<s> Hi, we just noticed the following bug in Microsoft's web folder implementation: when displaying the contents of a collection, it will use (when present) the DAV:displayname property as internal member name.  </s>
<s> Furthermore, the URI displayed in the "tabular view" will use the collection's URI + the displayname to build the member's URI.  </s>
<s> This is obviously wrong, because there's no guarantee that the individual DAV.displayname values in a property are distinct.  </s>
<s> IMHO, the RFC2518 revision should say: "User agents MUST not use the DAV:displayname to identify the individual collection members (because the value may not be unique across the members of a collection).  </s>
<s> However, they MAY use it to display additional information about a collection member".  </s>

<s> After changing the explorer options, Word indeed launches when selecting a link to a .doc  </s>
<s> file, however a trace shows that Word a) GETs the resource (ok) and displays it as "read only" (wrong), then b) does an OPTION on the root collection (wrong, it may not be DAV enabled), then c) does an OPTION on the resource itself, which responds with a 401 (Auth required).  </s>
<s> However, the authentication dialog does not pop up until Word's document window is closed.  </s>

<s> And yes, d) the file can be successfully opened and edited when opened from Microsoft's webfolder client.  </s>
