<s> The relevant text from xml-c14n is: Lexicographic order is imposed on the namespace declarations and attributes of each element Lexicographic comparison, which orders strings from least to greatest alphabetically, is based on the UCS codepoint values, which is equivalent to lexicographic ordering based on UTF-8.  </s>

<s> (I will be satisfied with a "YES" with no supporting justification) thanks Jeremy PS: Is there such an implementation?  </s>

<s> If you specify the codepoint collation in the collation attribute of xsl:sort then you get the lexicographic sorting described.  </s>

<s> Hi Mukul,  </s>
<s> Personally, I don't think so.  </s>
<s> As you say, the "any()" function, as you've defined it, doesn't do anything new, just provides a shorthand for accessing all the sibling nodes of the context node.  </s>
<s> Probably the easiest way to do this now is with: ../node() except .  </s>
<s> (Get the child nodes of the parent of the context node, and remove the context node from that sequence.)  </s>
<s> Your example would become something like: If you feel the need for an "any()" function, you can always define it yourself as a stylesheet function: Since it has an uncomplicated equivalent, and you can create it yourself without problems, I don't think "any()" needs to be a built-in function.  </s>
