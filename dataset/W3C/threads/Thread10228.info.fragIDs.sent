<s> Typos, trivial stuff, one issue (which is raised here because you've carefully not said much about seeAlso &amp;co., so not necessarily a schema problem) 1. Introduction "As such, RDF data can resemble an entity-relationship diagram."  </s>
<s> An instance diagram, maybe, but I think this sentence is empty and can  </s>
<s> be struck.  </s>
<s> The traditional distinction between class and instance is blurred by RDF.  </s>
<s> 2. Classes "Note that if a class were the same thing as the set of its instances then common (Zermelo-Fraenkel) set theory would prevent it being an instance of itself."  </s>
<s> This comes across more clearly in the MT; strike this sentence on the grounds of being woolly.  </s>
<s> "A class C is a subclass of a class C' if and only if all the instances of C are also instances of C'." Again, this is what the MT says, but I still find it incongruous that classes have an intensional semantics yet the primary relationship between them is extensional.  </s>
<s> I'd prefer a purely intensional definition: "If a class C is a subclass of a class C', then all instances of C are also instances of C'." See below.  </s>
<s> 2.1 rdfs:Resource Formatting error.  </s>
<s> (no heading style?)  </s>
<s> 3.1 rdfs:range "The triple P rdfs:range C states that P is an instance of the class rdf:Property, that C is an instance of the class rdfs:Class and that the objects of triples whose predicate is P are instances of the class C."  </s>
<s> All those things are true as a consequence of the semantics document (since rdfs:range rdfs:domain rdfs:Property is an RDFS axiomatic triple) but does this triple _state_ all those conclusions or does it _entail_ them?  </s>
<s> because it only RDFS-entails these conclusions, not rdf-entails them.  </s>
<s> Same comments (I think) apply to 3.2 and 3.3 (consider this preemptive nitpicking)  </s>
<s> 3.2, 3.3 Heading formatting error.  </s>
<s> 3.4 rdf:subClassOf "...is used to state that one class is a specialization of another."  </s>
<s> No it isn't; it's used to state a subset relationship between their class extensions.  </s>
<s> You've carefully pointed out the difference between two intensionally distinct classes with the same extension in section 2. Don't ignore it here.  </s>
<s> Using your example, consider the class of everyone living in the UK as collected bythe tax office.  </s>
<s> Can you honestly say that the post office's class of people at a particular "zip code" is a speciali[sz]ation of that?  </s>
<s> 5.2 RDF Collections SEMANTICS doesn't require that the collections structures are well-formed.  </s>

<s> 5.4.1 rdfs:seeAlso You carefully don't say much here, which is good.  </s>
<s> However, I think this  </s>

<s> as part of LC: If a resource is named by something that looks like a URI,  </s>
<s> then what expectations can we have about that?  </s>
<s> If we (through  </s>
<s> some process) dereference that URI, what can we expect to see?  </s>
<s> Ie, is there any expectation (and if so, when) that the use of a web address to name something means that we  </s>
<s> can get a description of the named thing by dereferencing that  </s>
<s> address?  </s>
<s> Or does the web address name the description itself?  </s>
<s> Consider this a last-call comment (to speed things along, ie get to LC) but I think we're doing the semantic web a disservice by not addressing  </s>
<s> this question - even if "addressing" the question involves punting to TAG.  </s>
<s> One explicit approach would be to introduce an explicit set of properties along these lines: eg:something rdfx:URI "eg:something-else"^^ xsd:uri .  </s>
<s> Same comments apply to 5.4.2; although the wording is careful here too.  </s>

<s> That is not what we have decided.  </s>
<s> Fixed  </s>
<s> There is a use/mention error there.  </s>
<s> That should be "the objects of statements ..." since the object of a triple is a URI.  </s>
<s> I propose fix before last call.  </s>
<s> OK, I'll ignore it.  </s>
<s> fixed  </s>
<s> Right.  </s>
<s> That should be fixed.  </s>
<s> Not by RDFS, but I don't want to draw attention to it.  </s>
<s> We are going nowhere near that.  </s>
<s> Way outside our charter.  </s>
<s> Look at the second sentence of the primer abstract.  </s>
<s> "[RDF] is particularly intended for representing metadata about Web resources, such as the title, author, and modification date of a Web page, copyright and licensing information about a Web document, or the availability schedule for some shared resource."  </s>
<s> BUT throughout all our LCC documents, we repeatedly say that, as far as RDF is concerned, there is nothing apart from an accidental relationship between a URIref used to denote a resource in RDF and what the web considers to be named (or addressed) by that URIref.  </s>
<s> That is, that RDF is agnostic about any such relationship.  </s>
<s> Yet many of our examples and text gives the lie to this.  </s>
<s> It's clear also that WG members seem to think that there's more going on.  </s>
<s> Paraphrasing DanC from a recent telecon: "that [URIref used to name a test case] 404's, that's no good, that must be fixed."  </s>
<s> Yet _nothing_ in the RDF documents we've produced supports DanC's position on this.  </s>
<s> In fact, Appendix A of the primer explicitly shoots it down.  </s>
<s> OK, you might rule this outside our charter.  </s>
<s> But if RDF forms the bottom layer of the semantic _web_, where does the responsibility for answering this lie?  </s>
<s> At some higher level?  </s>
<s> It seems that in RDF in the wild, sometimes a URIref-labelled resource is used to denote a thing that you can get a description about using  </s>
<s> that name as a web address.  </s>
<s> Sometimes it denotes the description itself.  </s>
<s> And sometimes it denotes something else entirely.  </s>
<s> But there's no mechanism or machinery to support this, and the issue is rarely even mentioned.  </s>
<s> If it's not RDFCore's job, then it's certainly a TAG job, and I would hope that this issue can be raised as a matter of priority.  </s>
<s> There's a tech plenary coming up soon - maybe there?  </s>
<s> Please consider this a last call comment (in advance).  </s>
<s> We currently don't stay silent on this, we instead say "it's not our job".  </s>
<s> That answer doesn't suffice - it needs to identify _whose_ job it is to provide an answer on this.  </s>

<s> I don't think we need to say anything more than we have said, especially since this involves an open debate and nothing more can be said reliably.  </s>
<s> I consider it the TAG's job to resolve/clarify this issue.  </s>
<s> Patrick  </s>
<s> Technically, it's not what "the web" considers to be named by the URIref, it's what the "owner" of the URIref considers to be named by it.  </s>
<s> Also, there isn't really a problem when the "owner's" interpretation of a URIref as far as RDF is concerned ("it identifies my home page") is the same as the (HTTP)web's interpretation of that URIref when you plug it into a browser ("it identifies a web page"), right?  </s>
<s> It's just the case when the URIref is "overloaded" that creates the issue.  </s>
<s> I don't know that the Primer is all that explicit about shooting it down.  </s>
<s> The Primer (in Section 2.3) points out that when a URIref is overloaded like this, it creates some ambiguity, and (in Appendix A) points out that although this is a convention that is sometimes used, RDF (per se) doesn't *assume* this convention.  </s>
<s> Certainly I agree that the link between RDF (and OWL, and ...) and the original Web (the one consisting of resources that can be retrieved if they have http URIrefs) is really important, and needs to be thoroughly worked out.  </s>
<s> However, I think we've done our job if we point out the issue (Concepts has some text on this too).  </s>
<s> I don't see this as an abdication of responsibility: we haven't been given the responsibility to deal with this, and there may be ways of doing so that we haven't thought of yet, so I don't think we ought to be seen to be biasing the  </s>
<s> future direction.  </s>
<s> I seem to recall Tim Bray, among others, not being overly disturbed about this situation.  </s>
<s> Again calling on my memory, I believe he thinks additional descriptive information *about* the URIref as being a way to handle this, and I think he has a point.  </s>
<s> This could  </s>
<s> be considered an issue of the "role" the URIref was playing, and roles could be described in RDF.  </s>
<s> I agree that "it's not our job" doesn't suffice as an *answer* (and as I've said above, I agree with you about the importance of this), but it is in fact the truth.  </s>
<s> It's also not our job to designate whose responsibility it is, and in a sense it would be misleading for us to do  </s>
<s> so. What you might consider doing as a thought-experiment is thinking about what text you would like to see in RDF documents that fully resolves this issue to your satisfaction, and then thinking about whether the rest of the W3C would think it an appropriate action of the RDF Core WG to appear to commit the W3C to those things in its specifications.  </s>
<s> Alternatively, if you can come up with text that at least identifies the issue more clearly than what we currently say, we could certainly consider inserting it in appropriate documents during Last Call.  </s>
