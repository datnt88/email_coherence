I'd like to find out if there is consensus on removing the "property registry" task from the WebDAV WG charter. 
We've attempted to discuss this at various WG meetings, and we've never made any clear progress in defining the task -- so we don't even know whether this would be an Internet-Draft that could become an RFC, possibly defining an IANA process, or whether this would be a site or non-IANA process of some kind. 
We also have never had a volunteer so we've never had anybody working on this item. 
Perhaps nobody's ever found it to be really necessary. 
Note that even if it's removed from the charter, progress can still be made if somebody finds the motivation. 
For example, a property registry site could be developed with feedback from the Working Group, even if it's not a WG deliverable. 
If we don't remove it from the charter, then we need volunteers ASAP to work on that item, and clear ideas what the WG deliverable really is. 
Please weigh in. 
Lisa Sorry, I meant to put a time limit on feedback -- we'll try to come to a conclusion in 2 weeks so please hold discussion in that time. 
thanks! 
Lisa I vote for removing it. 
Clearly there's no energy for working on a universal registry, nor do we seem to need it. 
Related: I've been working on scripts that compile information about method names, header names, property names, pre/postcondition names (and so on) from a set of RFC2629-XML-formatted documents. 
Basically I'm using a set of well-defined entries of index entries, and just combine them into a common document. 
This will give us the property index at least for all working-group documents (it's not quite ready yet, but if people are interested, I can produce an example in the next few days).

If you want to talk about related issues, create a new thread. 
Please.
