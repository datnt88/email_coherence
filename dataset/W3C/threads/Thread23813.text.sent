Hi, I'm new to this list and I wonder if someone could catch me up on what the Adobe-Apple-Netscape HTML font extensions announcment means. 
Apparently the technology will incorporate Type 1 / Truetype and also fit in with W3 style sheet designs. 
-jme I have linked this press release, along with the one from Microsoft, from [1]. 
It seems that the two announcements complement each other, and this is a good chance to work together to find a common font solution for the web. 
[1] http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Fonts/ Regards, -h&amp;kon Hakon W Lie, W3C/INRIA, Sophia-Antipolis, France We have done a review of both approaches that compete directly with Bitstream TrueDoc technology. 
In general Microsoft's proposal is TrueType centric and Adobe's is somewhat Postscript centric. 
TrueDoc is absolutely neutral in that it handles both formats, is platform independent and is available now. 
Hakon, I would like to have a BOF meeting at the Paris conference in May regarding transport of fonts, how they are referenced, imaged, and printed. 
I willing to set up the meeting an work on this. 
Could you indicate how to proceed? 
There is also information on each font proposal at http://fonts.verso.com/ 
Glen_Rippel@Bitstream.com Sorry for the late reply. 
I'm in charge of Developer's day and have planned a session on Graphics/Fonts. 
Chris Lilley will be organizing it. 
With the recent interest in Web Fonts, perhaps we should dedicate a session to fonts alone? 
What do you think, Chris? 
Developer's day is on May 10th, so a BOF a day or two before could also be interesting. 
www5-info@inria.fr will take suggestions for BOFs. 
Regards, -h&amp;kon Hakon W Lie, W3C/INRIA, Sophia-Antipolis, France Hakon, I think a Developer's day session and/or a BOF on Web fonts would be useful addition(s) to the May W3C conference program, and Adobe would definitely like to participate. 
Fonts in HTML is certainly the immediate concern, but from our perspective fonts on the Web is also a broader issue, touching on Java, formats for dynamic media, etc. 
In line with earlier comments on this list, we (Adobe) believe that the Microsoft proposal and the Adobe/Netscape/Apple proposal will be complementary (actually, our proposal is a functional superset of Microsoft's). 
No one wants another "font war". 
More details on this to follow soon, I hope. 
But, given that things might not be totally settled by May, I might suggest that the session organizer if possible be a neutral party, perhaps someone with a background in Web publishing, rather than one of us folks who are promoting a specific solution.

I agree that there seems enough interest and material for two separate sessions. 
For fonts, there could be presentations from Microsoft, from Adobe/Apple/Netscape and from Bitstream. 
A demonstration of a CSS-enabled browser performing font fetching by talking to some sort of prototype font resolution service would also be good, if it could be arranged in time. 
The general issue of font resolvers needs exploring and needs to be decoupled from stylesheets because other media, including Java applets, may require font resolution services also. 
A brief update on micropayments in the font session could also be useful, I feel. 
Particularly if someone could propose a cheap micropayment negotiation method to integrate into the font retrieval process. 
The whole issue of antialiasing would seem to merit part of the session. 
There are issues of hinting for antialiasing (in vector formats) alpha planes (for bitmapped formats) and layout/compositing issues, particularly when taken togewther with inline graphic formats that have transparency, and background images that may or may not be scrolling with the text. 
Someone to talk on layout issues at a developer level woulsd be excellent. 
I see font provision as having two orthogonal axes. 
One is depth or number of different faces, styles etc. 
The other is breadth - providing at least one glyph (in any face and style) for each character in the repertoire of ISO 10646/Unicode. 
So, something on the breadth axis would be good. 
For graphics, I see that just today the preliminary MIME registration for SVF was submitted along with autocad DXF and DWG. 
So perhaps something on vector formats in general would be good. 
The issue of image metadata is becoming prominent, and I would like to have someone talk about this. 
I have just finished reading a survey and report on academic networked access to imagebanks which hilights the need for good image metadata handling. 
Another possibility for the graphics area is a discussion on commercial image fidelity requirements for advertising and online sales , especially catalogues. 
I just read an article discussing this and essentially dismissing online delivery because the quality was so por and the number of catalog returns would be so high. 
This however can be and is changing - an update or debate would be interesting. 
It would be good to organise a page for that BOF, pointing to the various font resources and suggesting that attendees be familiar with the material before the BOF. 
An opportunity for face to face discussion is too valuable to spend it getting slightly interested folks up to speed. 
Preparing a BOF agenda ahead of time would also help.
