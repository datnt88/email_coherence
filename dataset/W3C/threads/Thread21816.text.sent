Hi Any chance of an RSS 1.0 RDF/XML newsfeed for your site? 
cheers, Dan Yes and no. 
Right now we're working with RSS 0.91. 
The feed is at http://www.semanticworld.org/backend/semanticworld.xml. 
I've put a link at the bottom of the sites pages, to make it easier to find. 
Eli You should add that in your header it will make it easier to find for autodiscovery systems.
