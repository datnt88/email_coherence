<s> Since more and more people are starting to ask, we should probably have some definitive answer that we all agree on (for any value of all).  </s>
<s> So, here's my first attempt at an elevator hook, arranged as "what", "why", and "how":- What:- EARL - the Evaluation And Report Language - is an RDF based system/model/framework/+ for making scoped evaluations about resources/things/RDF resources/+, being developed by the W3C WAI Evaluation and Repair Tools group.  </s>
<s> EARL is non constraining in the range of things that can be evaluated, or the range of conformance criteria that these things can be evaluated against, but it does provide a vocabulary to facilitate scoped reports.  </s>
<s> Why:- EARL can be used for a number of applications, for example, Quality Assurance, simple Web site ratings (er... too much like PICS in some senses), authoring tool and user agent ratings and bug reports, device independence testing and rating, and so on.  </s>
<s> Being based on RDF, EARL is also Semantic Web compatable, and tools produced by the W3C's Semantic Web activity may be able to be used on EARL.  </s>
<s> How:- In general, an EARL evaluation consists of a context, and then an assertion which consists of the thing being evaluated, the conformance criteria, and the validity status.  </s>
<s> For example, contextual information may include information such as creator details, platform, and so on.  </s>
<s> The thing beiong evaluated could be a Web page, or a tool.  </s>
<s> The conformance criteria could be something like a WCAG checkpoint or a syntax rule in a schema, and the validity status could be something as simple as "pass or fail" or something more granular with, for example, a certain level of confidence.  </s>

<s> Here's another run at that triple.  </s>
<s> What is EARL?  </s>
<s> A notation for recording and sharing evaluations.  </s>
<s> Evaluation ::= tuple ( what was evaluated -- any referenceable scope of resource against what criteria -- published or re-usable assesment instrument as applicable with what conclusion -- outcome, consistent with the conventions of instrument under what other conditions -- computing environment, human exercising judgement, ad lib.  </s>
<s> Why EARL?  </s>
<s> The people who can tell you what works and what doesn't work are often different people, operating on different computers, from the people who can discern why it did or didn't work in those cases, and how to repair defects and extend positive results into wider applicability.  </s>
<s> Product developers need to accumulate evaluations from many independent evaluators.  </s>
<s> Policy monitors need to collect comparable evaluations for many evaluands.  </s>
<s> Free and machine-comprehensible exchange of this information will allow information collections to reach critical mass and clearly point the way for action.  </s>
<s> Who: EARL is an experiment of the W3C/WAI Evaluation and Repair Tools Working Group  http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/ http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/ .  </s>
<s> Why WAI-ER?  </s>
<s> The need for something that can do what EARL does is especially important if one wishes to improve information access by people with disabilities.  </s>
<s> Existing practices of user testing become prohibitively difficult for this user group.  </s>
<s> It takes Internet-based methods to reduce user evaluation to an affordable cost in this community.  </s>
<s> People with disabilities commonly experience mobility problems which makes it harder to get them to a controlled, dedicated evaluation laboratory.  </s>
<s> Likewise, there is a vast diversity of equipment configurations that people use to accomodate their needs.  </s>
<s> This makes it difficult to build a large enough sample of respondents.  </s>
<s> The laboratory would have to be perpetually reconfigured to provide a realistic emulation of their environment of use.  </s>
<s> All of this argues in favor of tooling up for in_vivo testing -- going straight to the field, or at least into laboratories where the primary activity is fitting and training assitive technology.  </s>
<s> Here the evaluations are performed in the user's operational environement where the assitive features have been installed and configured and work.  </s>
<s> Some means is needed, for these reasons, to a) isolate the information that is usefully comparable across user experiences, and b) automate its exchange so that small (down to one user at home) laboratories can effectively contribute usable information into collections.  </s>
<s> How does EARL work?  </s>
<s> This notation is being built as an RDF application, composed of a small starter vocabulary of RDF terms which, by RDF semantics, create pattern definitions.  </s>
<s> These patterns provide just enough structure so you can put together records of evaluations suitable for machine exchange and processing, but can say whatever it is that you have to say.  </s>
<s> Employing the RDF framework as an implementation medium means that the groundwork has already been laid so one can freely extend the vocabulary while preserving the processability of the shared core concepts.  </s>
<s> It also brings access to a growing base of tools that process RDF, including products from the W3C Semantic Web Initiative.  </s>
<s> [end draft] Notes: When I stated the "why WAI-ER" story -- that we need to try harder on how to gather user experience among the PWD user population -- at the "Accessibility Forum" meeting in the U.S., industry people stopped arguing and started taking notes.  </s>
<s> I think that there may be more latent support for EARL out there than we realize.  </s>
<s> I am talking through my hat in the extensibility claims in the last paragraph.  </s>
<s> This could be toned down, or an explanation of why this is true developed and/or cited.  </s>
<s> But I would strongly urge that the "what" not say RDF, but what information is  </s>
<s> to be captured and exchanged.  </s>
<s> RDF is a 'how,' please.  </s>
<s> Al  </s>
<s> This is really good.  </s>
<s> William also sent an effort off-list, and it would be nice to collate these, and get them published ASAP.  </s>
<s> Together with Wendy's previous attempt at an EARL-for-dummies thing, and my model primer literature, we have an already powerful collection of materials for explaining EARL to many audiences.  </s>
<s> Agreed. Over-enthusiasm for RDF on my behalf showing through again.  </s>
<s> Then again, this sort of nonsense should be expected from someone who uses RDF in his email signature... :-) Kindest Regards, Sean B. Palmer @prefix : http://webns.net/roughterms/ .  </s>
