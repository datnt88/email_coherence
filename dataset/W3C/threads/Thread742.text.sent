can anyone highlight on how to comile tidy.c 
I keep getting linking errors. 
Anyinstallation instructions would help. 
Iam using NT version of tidy. 
Using what compiler on NT? -- Dave on MSVS: I've been working on a few improvements using MS Visual C++. 
Basically create a new empty project, and add all the files to the project under the appropriate categories (mainly two: header files, source files). 
And compile away.
