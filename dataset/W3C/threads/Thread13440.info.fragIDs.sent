I have an action item from the ER group: 
Action DB take issue to UA - should they be considering ERT techniques in 
their guidelines? 
have they already? 
include in techniques document? 
I don't have strong feelings that User Agents should employ ERT techniques, but when the issue came up we agreed UA folks might be interested in hearing about it. 
Gregory has some thoughts below. 
Dick Brown Program Manager, Web Accessibility Microsoft Corp. aloha, y'all! 
in the minutes from this morning's telecon, it was stated: quote: DB you can consider UA's testing tools. 
in the future they may be doing more. 
LK the ideal: techniques part of authoring tools and browsers. 
WL can we suggest something to UA for UA's to perform validity checks for the user? 
LK i don't think that has been part of the UA philosophy.

unquote the User Agent Working group has consistently taken the stance that User Agents are _not_ expected to fix invalid or inaccessible HTML-that burden has been placed squarely upon the author's shoulders, and the Web Content, Authoring Tool, and ERT documents are all intended to ensure that the content that is exposed to the user via a user agent is (a) valid and (b) accessible that being said, a simple warning, such as that which Lynx issues when it encounters invalid HTML quote Warning! 
Bad HTML! Use -trace to diagnose unquote would be a beneficial feature for a User Agent, but as far as expecting a user agent to perform repairs or even an analysis of the page, isn't something that the User Agent Guidelines currently address, nor is it something that the WG expects as part of the functionality of a user agent qua user agent... a user agent that also functions as an editing tool, such as Amaya, however, would be required to perform evaluation and repair, but only in editing mode... finally, Lynx can-by using the -trace command line switch-be used as a diagnostic tool-for more info, consult: tml gregory.

not wishing to confuse the issue, it might be possible for a user agent to provide er through assistive technologies. 
I only say this because it would be sad if two things happen: 1 the only way to get valid code out of something you need is to go to some other web site after finding that you can't use the site in question in order to have that site turned around, and 2 even though the code might not be valid, it becomes an access issue because of data needed for accessability not being passed. 
Having said this, I do not feel that it is necessarily an access issue but have long sought an user agent that would automatically alert the page author that there are problems with a site code wise and explain the difficulties that might arise for users and even to suggest repair strategies and to copy that message to someone who could follow up and also to the individual who accessed the site for reference. 
In some cases, assistives already do some repair work. 
This is in some ways what msaa does. 
It might also be something to take up in our rechartering as we move towards blurring the lines of distinction between html and other functional specs.

AG:: The header guessing algorithm from HTML 4 tables is a repair technique that I believe the UA group has endorsed. 
I wonder what the group's position would be on what a User Agent should do on processing a stylesheet that contains !important clauses and clearly identifies itself as CSS1. 
Should the User Agent 'repair' this to let the user's !important rule? 
As we move forward to more general flavors of XML, I believe that we will want to move User Agent functionality to being triggered more by structure patterns and less by individual marks. 
So the idea that User Agents may properly be engaging in 'repair' is not to be summarily dismissed, I hope. 
On the other hand, the User Agent Guidelines are in a very stable phase. 
Unless someone is aware of a repair that the guidelines have missed, that ERT has designed, and that is a serious flaw not to include, the action to take right now would seem to be to say that repair techniques may be cited in the User Agent Techniques in future and move on. 
As David Poehlman points out, most of the 'repair' agenda was left behind with the decision to focus on the minimum requirements for the base platform and defer consideration of AT techniques.
