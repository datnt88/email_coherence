I've just made a pass through the Primer PR and have discovered a few 
editorial nits that should be corrected: 
* in the TOC, sections 5.1 and 5.2 need to have "Defining" replaced by "Describing" to be consistent with the actual section titles. 
* in Section 2.2, there are two instances of "example.com" that need to 
be changed to "example.org" to be consistent with the overall example 
* in Section 3.3, there's an "is" in the last sentence that should be 
"are". 
* in Section 5.1, Figure 18 is upside down (class MotorVehicle should be at the top, not the bottom). 
This was fixed early last year in response to a comment from PPS, but somehow an earlier version of the figure got loaded into TR space and I missed it. 
This is just a matter of re-uploading the corrected figure. 
* in Section 6.1, just above Example 32, there's a reference to Example 30 that should be a reference to Example 31. 
* in the References, the [LBASE] reference has the right URL but the wrong date (it should cite the 10 October 2003 version). 
How should these changes be handled? 
--Frank [NB: Now that I'm re-reading the Primer with a relatively "fresh" eye, I've found lots of places that could have been written better, but I'm steadfastly refraining from suggesting any further changes. 
Enough already! 
Nevertheless, I really think the above fixes should be made.] 
I've just looked through Frank's proposed changes w.r.t. [1] and agree that 
they are (a) editorial, and (b) desirable. 
(With a clarification about fig 
18.) [1] http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-rdf-primer-20031010/ 
Agree. 
I only saw one, but I agree that .org would be more consistent. 
It's not clear to me which way this should be, but I agree it's minor editorial. 
Then the arrows should point upwards? 
Then I agree this is just editorial. 
Agree. 
Agree. #g Graham Klyne 
Hi Frank, I hope its not too late to wish you a Happy New Year. 
It would only be too late if it were this coming December 31. 
As it is, I have your good wishes (thanks!) for the rest of the year (too late for the part of January that's gone by already though; I've got tendonitis from shoveling snow!). 
BTW: Happy New Year all! 
These all look like straightforward typo fixes to me. 
I suggest: - prepare a corrected version of the document - we run a diff to check whats changed - As these are just typos, I'll review them - we can take a formal decision to approve the changes at this weeks telecon - and offer them to the director for publication as a rec 
OK. I should have the corrections uploaded sometime Tuesday (there'll be a new file for the corrected figure as well). 
DanC - that work for you?

Graham-- Thanks for the review. 
Some comments below.

There are really two, but they're hard to find (which is why I'm having to correct them now!) 
Now that you mention it, I think I'm going to leave this the way it is (the *real* problem is my convoluted sentence structure, but I'm going to leave *that* alone!) 
Yes, the arrows should point upwards. 
The subClass hierarchy is exactly the same; PPS's comment was that people are used to class diagrams having the more general classes at the top. 
The corrected version of the Primer PR is now available off the "editor's draft" link on the WG home page. 
All I've done is make the set of changes I noted in my earlier message (less the change in Section 3.3 I decided was unnecessary after reading Graham's comments); I didn't add bullets for these changes to the Changes Appendix, change the title to an Editor's Draft, etc. 
Also please note that there are two files involved: the main .html 
file, and a new file vehicleClassesJan12.png representing the updated figure (the old file was fig17dec16.png).

Brian ps: +1 on steadfastness B 
For convenience I have created an html diff between the PR version and the ed's draft which can be found at: Brian 
This diff accurately captures the intended changes.
