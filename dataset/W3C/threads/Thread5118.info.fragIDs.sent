<s> I'm beginning to make some progress by using GetResource to find the right URI.  </s>

<s> 2. Do you have a Qname capability, e.g. rdfs:subClassOf, in your new system?  </s>
<s> I'm 100% in favor of Qnames for a user interface instead of long URIs.  </s>
<s> Even better, when possible (which is most of the time), would be unqualified names, with the URI being looked up in a local dictionary.  </s>

<s> Yes, if you ask for rdfs:subClassOf or tap:AthleteJordan,_Michael, then a system called the Abbreviator expands "rdfs:" to the actual namespace.  </s>
<s> The abbreviator also takes care of remembering which are rdfs: and which are rdf:, and other such hassles by managing a set of "standard tags".  </s>
<s> You'd gotten away earlier by putting the TAP namespace on everything, and frankly I did that for a long time too, but we have to be more compliant now.  </s>
<s> The way to tell if a tag doesn't need a namespace is to call the Abbreivator's  </s>

<s> { tag = "http://tap.stanford.edu/data/"  </s>
<s> + tag;  </s>
<s> Off the cuff, the tags I use the most that require no namespace are rdfs:Class, rdfs:subClassOf, rdfs:label, rdf:type, and rdf:Resource.  </s>
<s> For these tags, if you just say the tag, such as "Class", the system will automaticall put the "rdfs:" on for you.  </s>
<s> I like it!!!  </s>
