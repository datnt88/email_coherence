1. It looks like a URI problem. 
I'm beginning to make some progress by using GetResource to find the right URI. 
It's a pain trying to keep straight whether it's rdf or rdfs or dc, for example. 
2. Do you have a Qname capability, e.g. rdfs:subClassOf, in your new system? 
I'm 100% in favor of Qnames for a user interface instead of long URIs. 
Even better, when possible (which is most of the time), would be unqualified names, with the URI being looked up in a local dictionary. 
Dick McCullough knowledge := man do identify od existent done; knowledge haspart proposition list; So far, GetResource (your GetResourcesNamed) works, but GetData does not. 
Does "panic" work with my current TAP 0.75? 
Do I need to use rdf:,rdfs:,owl:, etc.? Do I need to use URIs instead of short names?

Yes, if you ask for rdfs:subClassOf or tap:AthleteJordan,_Michael, then a system called the Abbreviator expands "rdfs:" to the actual namespace. 
The abbreviator also takes care of remembering which are rdfs: and which are rdf:, and other such hassles by managing a set of "standard tags". 
You'd gotten away earlier by putting the TAP namespace on everything, and frankly I did that for a long time too, but we have to be more compliant now. 
The way to tell if a tag doesn't need a namespace is to call the Abbreivator's 
IsStandardTag static method. 
So in GetData.java, you'd do something like this: 
if(!Abbrev.IsStandardTag(tag)) 
{ tag = "http://tap.stanford.edu/data/" 
+ tag; 
Off the cuff, the tags I use the most that require no namespace are rdfs:Class, rdfs:subClassOf, rdfs:label, rdf:type, and rdf:Resource. 
For these tags, if you just say the tag, such as "Class", the system will automaticall put the "rdfs:" on for you. 
I like it!!! 
I just added that code to GetData &amp; PutData java programs.
