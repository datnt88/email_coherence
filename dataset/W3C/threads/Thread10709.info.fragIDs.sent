Fellow Editors: The latest version of Semantics 
has some changes to the subsection organization. 
I mention this in case other documents refer to any sections by name. 
The changes are: Section numbers 3.n 4.n and 5.n are all changed n/n+1, so for example 3.2.3 is now 3.3.3, 
etc. . 
All the old anchors still go to the same section as before, even though the section number has changed. 
Sections 5 main title is changed to 5. Interpreting Datatypes The sections 3.1 RDF Interpretations (anchor #RDFINTERP) 4.1 RDFS Interpretations (#RDFSINTERP) 5.1 Datatyped Interpretations (#DTYPEINTERP) are all new: they each contain the material which was formerly the 'first part' of sections 3, 4 and 5 respectively. 
This is the bulk of the precise normative material after section 1. 
This was done in order to make the normative RFC 2119 stuff about semantic extensions in section 0.1 more precise. 
It now reads: "Semantic extensions of RDF MUST conform to the semantic conditions for simple interpretations described in sections 1.3 and 1.4 and 1.5 and those for RDF interpretations described in section 3.1 of this document. 
" With the earlier (lack of) organization, it was impossible to exactly pin down the material need in this reference.

Pat, can you please advise when you feel the revised version is stable enough for (another) review? 
Thanks.

Copied to shadow TR as version 1.52

I'm trying to audit changes since last call... 
Hmm... that's the same address you gave during the telcon, Pat. 
I was silly enough to take the md5sum without making a copy. 
So I don't have a copy of the document relevant to the WG decision. 
I suppose that doesn't matter all that much, since not many members of the WG read the version that Pat cited in the meeting. 
CVS doesn't show any differences between 1.52 and revision 1.51 date: 2003/10/31 13:43:39; author: bmcbride; The mac linefeeds result in useless diffs ala... revision 1.49 date: 2003/10/14 14:28:45; author: bmcbride; state: Exp; lines: +1 -1 updates with post 2nd last call proof fixes and entailment rule changes So I created a branch from 1.46, a version just before LC2 where EricM converted it to unix linefeeds: revision 1.46.2.5 date: 2003/11/12 16:22:17; author: connolly; state: Exp; lines: +159 -154 unix linebreak version of v 1.51 2003/10/31 13:43:39 bmcbride; oddly v1.50 seemed to have no changes revision 1.46.2.4 date: 2003/11/12 16:17:25; author: connolly; state: Exp; lines: +733 -573 unix linebreak version of v 1.49 2003/10/14 14:28:45 bmcbride revision 1.46.2.3 date: 2003/11/12 16:15:46; author: connolly; state: Exp; lines: +115 -58 unix linebreak version of v 1.5 2003/10/10 15:08:31 em; this is the LC2 publication revision 1.46.2.2 date: 2003/11/12 16:12:10; author: connolly; state: Exp; lines: +119 -120 unix linebreak version of v 1.48 2003/10/09 18:00:01 em revision 1.46.2.1 date: 2003/11/12 16:10:24; author: connolly; state: Exp; lines: +4 -1 unix linebreak version of v 1.47 2003/10/08 19:52:00 em That's hundreds of lines of changes that I need to audit to against tests, www-rdf-comments, and WG decisions. 
And I gather I haven't seen the last of the changes. 
Whee!
