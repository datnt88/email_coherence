<s> During the 4 May teleconference, I took an action item to work on some new examples for Guideline 3.1.  </s>
<s> They're listed below.  </s>
<s> The proposed examples for Level 3 were originally presented as part of the "plain langauge" version of what used to be guideline 3.3.  </s>
<s> ==proposed examples== Examples for Guideline 3.1 Level 1 SC 1  </s>
<s> Example 1.  </s>
<s> A document that exists in English, French, and German versions.  </s>
<s> A corporate Web server identifies the country where a user's IP address is located.  </s>
<s> It displays the site in the appropriate language.  </s>
<s> A user's screen reader automatically uses the appropriate pronunciation rules, based on the presence of a language-identifier in the document.  </s>
<s> * Example 2: an acronym.  </s>
<s> The characters "W3C" are marked as an acronym the first time they appear on a Web page.  </s>
<s> A person using a screen reader would hear, "World Wide  </s>
<s> Web Consortium.";  </s>
<s> Later in the document, the user hears the characters  </s>
<s> "W 3 C" spoken one at a time, because they are not marked as an acronym.  </s>
<s> * Example 3. Abbreviated names for days of the week.  </s>
<s> The meeting time for a university course is shown in the schedule as "TTh 11." The letters "TTh" are tagged as an abbreviation.  </s>
<s> A student using a screen reader hears "Tuesday and Thursday 11 AM." Examples for Guideline 3.1, Level 2  </s>
<s> * Example 1.  </s>
<s> A page title includes a phrase that appears in link  </s>
<s> text in the navigation bar.  </s>
<s> The phrase "Compliance checking" appears as a link in a navigation bar.  </s>
<s> The same phrase is included in the title element of the linked page, so users can be certain that the link has worked correctly.  </s>
<s> Example 2: A screen reader correctly pronounces a phrase in a language the screen reader does not support.  </s>
<s> An English-language document includes short passages in Arabic, Hebrew, and Chinese.  </s>
<s> The phrases are marked up so that screen readers which do not contain pronunciation rules for these languages correctly identify the languages and pronounce the phrases.  </s>
<s> (The lang attribute would identify the natural language of each phrase; the SSML phoneme and/or lexicon elements could be used to tell the screen reader how to pronounce them.) * Example 3. Defining an unusual technical term.  </s>
<s> A user encounters an unfamiliar technical term and requests a definition.  </s>
<s> The user agent locates the term in a technical dictionary that has been identified in metadata and presents the definition to the user.  </s>
<s> Example 4: Idiomatic expressions in an audio clip.  </s>
<s> An oral history archive includes recorded interviews with people who use phrases spoken only in a particular region.  </s>
<s> The text transcript is linked to a dictionary of regional idioms.  </s>
<s> Examples for Guideline 3.1, Level 3 * Example 1: a description of a process.  </s>
<s> A page describes how to learn to make a corner kick in soccer.  </s>
<s> Each step in learning the fundamentals of the corner kick is illustrated with a photograph of a player doing what is described in the text.  </s>
<s> * Example 2: A committee report with an executive summary A government task force publishes its final report on the Web.  </s>
<s> The report is very long and includes many tables, charts, and illustrations as well as detailed recommendations.  </s>
<s> The home page for the task force contains a 100-word summary of the report written in plain language.  </s>
<s> Following the summary is a link to a Table of Contents where readers can choose individual sections of the report.  </s>
<s> There is also a link to the full report.  </s>
<s> * Example 3: a description of a complex natural event A Web page discusses Mt. Pinatubo in the Phillipines.  </s>
<s> The page includes a description of the 1991 eruption as well as photos of the eruption and its aftermath.  </s>
<s> The page also includes a brief explanation of why volcanoes erupt.  </s>
<s> To clarify this explanation, , the page links to site that contains video and another site that contains a 3D simulation of what happened underneath the crust and within the volcano during the eruption.  </s>
<s> [js note: I propose deleting the examples about the kid's school report and the stock market graph.  </s>
<s> The one about the school report isn't substantively different in kind from Example 2-it just shows that doing this kind of work can be child's play grin .  </s>
<s> The stock market data example is almost identical to the bar graph example we use in 1.1 but not nearly as fully developed.]  </s>
<s> * Example 4: history of music.  </s>
<s> A musicologist creates a Web site that includes examples of many different types of music and musical instruments.  </s>
<s> Descriptions of the instruments are accompanied by photographs, drawings, or details from paintings in which the instruments appear.  </s>
<s> When describing specific types of music, the musicologist links to short audio clips that show the music's characteristic sound.  </s>
<s> * Example 5: An explanation of a molecular process A Web page for a university Chemistry course explains a molecular process.  </s>
<s> The explanation uses symbols familiar to chemists.  </s>
<s> The explanation is accompanied by an animation that shows a model of how the process works.  </s>
<s> The page also includes a written narrative that describes the process shown in the animation.  </s>
<s> There is also a link to a compressed audio file containing a recording of the narrative read by a speech synthesizer.  </s>
<s> As they appear in the 11 March 2004 Working draft [1] Examples of Guideline 3.1 (Informative) List of 7 items * Example 1: an acronym in a page title.  </s>
<s> In the following heading, "People of the W3C." the acronym "W3C" is marked as an acronym.  </s>
<s> Because it has been marked appropriately, the user agent would be able to speak the letters of the acronym one at a time rather than attempting to pronounce it as though it were a word.  </s>
<s> * Example 2: a French phrase in an English sentence.  </s>
<s> In the following sentence, "And with a certain je ne sais quoi, she entered both the room, and his life, forever." the French phrase "je ne sais quoi" is marked as French.  </s>
<s> Depending on the markup language, English may either be marked as the language for the entire document except where specified, or marked at the paragraph level.  </s>
<s> * Example 3: a description of a process.  </s>
<s> A page describes how to learn to play soccer.  </s>
<s> Each step in learning the fundamentals of the game is illustrated with a photograph of a player doing what is described in the text.  </s>
<s> * Example 4: a concrete concept.  </s>
<s> The primary concept on a page is concrete.  </s>
<s> It is discussing Mt. Pinatubo.  </s>
<s> It includes both a description of the 1991 eruption as well as photos of the eruption and the aftermath.  </s>
<s> It links to another site that contains video and another site that contains a 3D simulation of what happened underneath the crust and within the volcano during the eruption.  </s>
<s> * Example 5: child's report of school trip.  </s>
<s> A child went with her school on a trip to a bicycle manufacturing plant.  </s>
<s> She wrote a report for her family and friends to post to the Web.  </s>
<s> In the report, she includes the company logo as well as a picture of a bicycle on the assembly line.  </s>
<s> She links to the company Web site for more information.  </s>
<s> She includes photos she took of the plant.  </s>
<s> * Example 6: stock trading data.  </s>
<s> A news site is comparing the performance of the economy from 3rd quarter of this year with 3rd quarter from the last 3 years.  </s>
<s> They compare prices of the most popular stocks.  </s>
<s> They present the data in a bar graph with a link to the raw data they used to create the bar graph.  </s>
<s> * Example 7: history of music.  </s>
<s> A grandfather's hobby is listening to and playing music.  </s>
<s> He creates a Web site that includes examples of many different types of music and musical instruments.  </s>
<s> When describing specific types of music, he links to a short sound clip.  </s>

<s> IP address.  </s>
<s> And I'm not even talking about countries like Canada or Belgium, that have more than 1 official language.  </s>
<s> As far as I know, the preferred way to automatically serve the correct language version is by letting your user agent know what languages you understand.  </s>
<s> The user agent should then negotiate with the server about the  </s>
