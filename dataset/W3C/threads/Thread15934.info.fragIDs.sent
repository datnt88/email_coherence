<s> If all blind people were the same and all totally blind this would be a somewhat-understandable statement.  </s>
<s> Since we are not.  </s>
<s> Since many of us have low vision which can be augmented by magnification and enhancing contrast, we have a strong appreciation for visual images as do normally sighted people.  </s>
<s> I have 6 works of graphic art in my home each done by a different artist and each a treasure to me.  </s>
<s> I was just saying to a professor in my department at Utah State University that I appreciate his leaving the thumbnail images of his paintings on his web site even in the text area he has developed for the visually impaired and those who would want to print out from the site because I love the opportunity to click on these as I view with a magnifying glass and be shown a full screen version of th paintings.  </s>
<s> While the entire internet is not worth my viewing nose-on-screen through 48 diopters of glass, some things are and I like having the option.  </s>

<s> My work is purely graphical and means nothing to someone is blind; they are not the target audience for my gallery of visual artwork, and so I don't need to be concerned with them.  </s>

<s> It depends.  </s>
<s> If I am searching for information, I won't be interested.  </s>
<s> But if this is a photo of a house I might want to buy, and no one sighted is around, I might want to save the image to disk for someone to examine later, or I might want to run it through an image processing routine and make a simplified braille printout of it.  </s>
<s> (Such tools exist, although they have a long way to go.) If I'm teaching a class, it would be useful if I could independently find the picture and display it for the class.  </s>
<s> If this is a clip-art gallery and I am free to use a clip in a newsletter or greeting card, it helps to be able to find the image I want.  </s>
<s> None of these need a really long Longdesc, although many of them will need more than can be contained in a typical filename that I might get from Lynx with verbose images turned on.  </s>
<s> Technically inclined artists might want to look at the work of the MPEG-7 standards process, the multimedia content description format.  </s>
<s> It is their intent to establish standards by which people can locate sounds and images by a query-by-example method, in addition to the keyword searching that is currently the only practical method for locating non-textual material.  </s>
<s> Until MPEG-7 is deployed (and I think a descriptive language underlies much of it), search engines are blind to art, no matter how wonderful it is.  </s>

<s> First off, I believe the gallery would be responsible formaking it accessible (or enforcing it's accessibility on the designer) But I don't think its the designer's call.  </s>
<s> It is certainly not the artist whose work is being translated to the web's responsibility Rarely is the WWW a medium in itself.  </s>
<s> An Escher print might not be accessible as it is, but have a narrator describe the work and now it is.  </s>
<s> Or is it?  </s>
<s> Visual artists might produce an image and it may be served over the WWW.  </s>
<s> But is it their responsibility to add test descriptions?  </s>
<s> Let's say an artist created a work that is heavily textured so the blind can interpret elements of it.  </s>
<s> Let's say the painting is photographed and it's image places on the web.  </s>
<s> Even if the image is described, the texture is lost.  </s>
<s> Is this accessible?  </s>
<s> I hate to say it, but if you think about the web like television, where it becomes the publisher's, not the artists, responsability to alt-tag the work the issue may be easier to see (not that television does a good job at accessibility) but the idea that the medium of the WWW is not a medium like acrylic paint is a medium (in this example), but media like broadcast that serves groups of people with all sorts of needs and wants.  </s>
<s> Now, lets talk about the other case, where the medium IS the web.  </s>
<s> I am a self-learning student of what might be called 'net-art', art disseminated over the internet, which uses the WWW as a medium.  </s>
<s> A medium like acrylic paint is a medium.  </s>
<s> My paint is hypertext, images, HTML code, javascript, audio files, and a multitude of other non-accessible media/conventions.  </s>
<s> I will admit that nine times out of ten my net-art is not accesssible, and this is a problem.  </s>
<s> A symphony can be felt by the deaf, a painting or sculpture can be felt by the blind.  </s>
<s> If I write a hypertext poem that uses background colors and images, not to make the page visually appealing, but to communicate voice and tone to the reader (red might be angry, blue might be calm) there is no way a blind user can touch the screen and get those impressions.  </s>
<s> If I include a bit of text on an alternate version, the rythym is changed and the poem becomes something else.  </s>
<s> Is multimedia art inaccessible?  </s>
<s> What about kinetic light-based art?  </s>
<s> Like art that is made up of lasers?  </s>
<s> Is this accessible?  </s>
<s> Here's an opposing question intended to open the problem up.  </s>
<s> Let's say I have developed a work for speech-reader, a work that uses the tonal qualities of such a device to create art.  </s>
<s> The work is delivered over the WWW.  </s>
<s> Is this work accessible?  </s>
<s> Sure, for those with the specific speech reader I worked with- or any reader if that's what I intended.  </s>
<s> But to a user without, no. the work would appear to be not accessible.  </s>
<s> The graphic designer who builds commercial web pages and claims "I'm an artist, and I don't care about the blind" is missing the point about the purpose of the Web- to deliver content.  </s>

<s> There will be some people for whom no retort could change their position on feeling this way.  </s>
<s> Unfortunate as it is for them.  </s>
<s> However, consider the most recognised method used by artists for their work.  </s>
<s> Galleries and museums.  </s>
<s> Most any show you attend today intended for showcasing works of art offer methods of making the shows available for the appreciation of persons with physical limitations, including blindness.  </s>
<s> These include guide tours and pre-recorded audio presentations of the exhibits.  </s>
<s> Utilizing proper HTML authoring techniques including the use of alternative text allows us to offer a similiar recourse for the visitors to our sites.  </s>
<s> Once again as has been pointed out by many other contributors to this list, this does not require multiple versions of the site.  </s>
<s> Using templates is the best way I've found to do this for browser independence.  </s>

<s> I suppose what could be said varies according to the particulars, but one response I have is that there's a way it's easy to leave out the social context of peoples' lives when we start talking about "disabled users," almost as though they live in some alien land without friends, families and colleagues whose abilities may differ from theirs.  </s>
<s> For example, take the case of someone who's blind who has a friend (with no vision disabilities) who's very interested in the culture of pre-Hellenic Greece.  </s>
<s> If that blind person found a graphically-rich site devoted to the subject and were given enough information about the graphics to have a sense of what was there, the site could be shared with the friend and their interaction might provide a broadened context in which both persons could appreciate the graphics more than either could individually.  </s>

<s> Well, it sounds like the medium of such artistes is what Australians call Bull (in polite company).  </s>
<s> I recently ran across just such a situation in preparing a catalog of a visual arts and sculpture exhibition for the web.  </s>
<s> As it happens, most of what uis there is not visual - it is information - metadata about the ork, such as its price, when it was created, the media used, the artist, etc.  </s>
<s> One of the pieces of such metadata is a short description of the work.  </s>
<s> After all, a 72dpi screen-based reproduction of an oil painting or high-quality photograph, let alone a wood and metal sculpture, simply doesn't provide the same experience to any user.  </s>
<s> (Those with very poor vision and a magnified screen may be exceptions here).  </s>
<s> Not recognising this is plain stupidity.  </s>
<s> Which leaves us with the case where the a multi-media presentation requires the use of a particular set of software/hardware.  </s>
<s> Which is to the web as line-drawn cartoons are to visual arts - a very small subset, using a tiny fraction of the expresiveness and power of the medium itself (If we consider all hand-produced visual arts as the medium, for example).  </s>
<s> This is not to say that these pieces are not high-quality, just just that they are denied any possibility of being really great by artificially failing to use techniues which are avilable in the medium.  </s>
<s> The web is not a graphic medium, but an information medium, which allows content to be presented in a multitude of ways, including graphically.  </s>
<s> Anybody who cannot see that distinction, and the downplaying that it implies for graphic design as the guiding design principle for web-based content, is a goose.  </s>
<s> Anybody who sees it, but claims that as ebsite designers they are only interested in graphic design, is not fit to build public information websites.  </s>
<s> They may of course produce marvellous art, but most companies and govenment bodies are not in the business of producing art, and most of their websites are designed to make their information available.  </s>
<s> Fond as I am of sculpture, I don't care how many sculptures the Registry of marriages has until I can get my marriage certificate.  </s>
<s> That is their primary responsiblity, not giving jobs to graphic designers.  </s>
<s> So my response is "Fine.  </s>
<s> But stick to what you know - make artworks, rather than claiming expertise in web design."  </s>
<s> (Which is what some of my friends do for a living, and they create art for the web which I really like, and which I inevitably miss about half of becuase it requires all sorts of wierd and wonderful plugins and features.  </s>
<s> But then I can look at Jackson Pollock for hours and not really find anything worthwhile, just a bit of paint splattered on a canvas.  </s>
<s> That's the nature of art.) Cheers Charles McCathieNevile  </s>
<s> My first thought was ok know your buyers.  </s>
<s> But that is chancy, because people with disabilities tell others about great sites so customers can be won or lost through referrals!  </s>
<s> Just because I'm not going to buy a motorcycle doesn't mean I'll never suggest a site to someone else, if it is Accessible.  </s>
<s> &amp; other things being equal that open mindedness could make the sale.  </s>

<s> In our haste to show each other our various ablitlites and abilities it seems we have all forgotten the admonition: "A house divided against itself cannot stand."  </s>
<s> Everyone with or without disabilities should think hard about this.  </s>
<s> We are all members of the human race.  </s>
<s> We need to work together, all of us, all of the time.  </s>
<s> Otherwise there will only be wrangling and unsatisfactory solutions at best.  </s>
<s> If the solutions be drastic then so be it.  </s>
<s> But we need to understand that we are all in this together, until we do, there will be much grief for all concerned.  </s>
<s> Sincerely, Mike Burks  </s>
<s> Following the discussion about the access to art, I wish to present my point of view on this subject.  </s>
<s> I think that, in the discussion about accessibility, we have to establish a list of priorities and distinguish between barriers which prevent us from accessing pieces of information convertible into an alternative presentation, and other components which are not important for the navigation and that, in addition, require the subjective interpretation of a sighted person.  </s>
<s> The problem is more general than that of the accessibility of a hypertext.  </s>
<s> I am totally blind and I have this problem every days, when I walk in the street of my town (Florence).  </s>
<s> I'd like to have a description on demand of the environment: the landscape of the town, the sunset, buildings, churches, hills, the river and (why not?) the pretty girls walking in the streets.  </s>
<s> In the same time, I need information about the state of traffic lights, the location of crossing for pedestrians or of bus stops; I need to know the number of the bus arriving to the stop or the names of the stops, when I am inside a bus.  </s>
<s> Well, I can request the intervention of the local administration to provide crossing and buses with adequate electronic systems, or other solutions, to give me information enough to be able to move alone in the town but I thing that nobody can ensure to me a total accessibility to everything a sighted person can appreciate by looking about.  </s>
<s> Such a generalized request would not result reasonable.  </s>
<s> In the same way, the accessibility of graphical information represents a real problem for us when this component is crucial for the access to other part of a document or for the comprehension of the subject, but a "purely visual expression" of an artist can be neglected with no real loss of information.  </s>
<s> An artistic work is addressed to a specific sensorial modality and any alternative description results inadequate to produce the same effect on a person who cannot have direct access to it.  </s>
<s> Even a sophisticated description represents the interpretation of the narrator.  </s>
<s> It can be useful but it cannot replace the feeling produced by a direct perception.  </s>
<s> This difference can be dramatic in the case of abstract art.  </s>
<s> An artist cannot be charged of the problem of universal design.  </s>
<s> We cannot expect that the whole world is transformed according to our needs.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, other classes of disabled have requirements which often are not compatible with those of blind people.  </s>
<s> For example, a congenitally deaf person has difficulties, not only to access speech and sounds, but often also written information, in the case of too abstract subjects or complex document architecture, because of lack of language knowledge.  </s>
<s> And what about cognitive disabled and mentally retarded people?  </s>
<s> If authors or artists had have to take into account of all these problems, they probably would not be able to produce any piece of work.  </s>
<s> In conclusion, we have to accept some limitations to the general accessibility, by adopting a pragmatic approach.  </s>
<s> I agree with the statement "accessibility is a right and not a privilege" but we must carefully interpret such a principle.  </s>
