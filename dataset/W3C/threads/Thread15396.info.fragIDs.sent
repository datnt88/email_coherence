<s> As the newcomer to the WG I think I have some level of objectivity to whatever issues exist between Joe and the list.  </s>
<s> My take on what Joe is saying is this: If we try and force people to provide an alternative, which is "expressed in words", to complex non-text content we run the risk of alienating content providers from other more attainable goals which are perhaps more immediately useful.  </s>
<s> Being a fan of Tufte myself, and having some background in Information Architecture, I sympathise with the problems associated with displaying complex information (and often raw data) in a meaningful, or at least digestible, form.  </s>
<s> I would suggest that in their enthusiasm to provide the best possible accessibility standards the working group may be setting goals which are uneconomic or simply too difficult for content providers.  </s>
<s> As a web developer who advocates (as we all do) standards compliance it is plain that getting people to follow such standards as XHTML is difficult enough.  </s>
<s> If we then compare XHTML to WCAG; content providers are upset (not through any fault of ours) because accessibility, being a subset of usability, is not something one can just automate, it requires thought and human appraisals.  </s>
<s> As such it seems critical to the success of the WCAG, and hence the WAI, that the recommendations we purpose are achievable goals.  </s>
<s> Perhaps more importantly they should be perceived by content providers as achievable goals.  </s>
<s> I do openly admit that there are two levels of compliance in the current WCAG 2.0 draft, and I am keen for us to explore all options before we discount them.  </s>
<s> However if most content providers feel threatened by a recommendation that appears restrictive and is not open and shut (as XHTML is), overly zealous rules will only serve to further the view that standards of accessibility are unachievable.  </s>
<s> I know this does not answer the question Kynn effectively posed of "What other alternatives can you give?" but maybe it posses a more poignant one, "What alternatives at all can we persuade content providers to give?"  </s>

<s> It is true here, as Joe says, that we don't just need a better definition, we need a better idea.  </s>
<s> "Just do what is possible to express verbally" is an unending assignment.  </s>
<s> There has to be some other principle we can bring to bear.  </s>
<s> And there is.  </s>
<s> The right goal for our effort, as Tom has suggested, is "what tip of the  </s>
<s> information iceberg is most important to get articulated verbally, and  </s>
<s> how can we get authors over the hump to articulate that?"  </s>
<s> If we can communicate the right questions to the authors, they will be able to articulate the answers.  </s>
<s> Framing the questions is the key.  </s>
<s> And then follow-through.  </s>
<s> Because gaps in the access infrastructure that the author intended won't be obvious without aided inspection of the page.  </s>
<s> The good news is that the theory for what to do is nearly there in the rest of what we are already saying.  </s>
<s> Summarize, decompose, orient, navigate.  </s>
<s> Moreover, some practices to promote are already out there on the web in what  </s>
<s> content providers are already doing.  </s>
<s> We just need to refine our story to get more content posted using more of the good practices.  </s>
<s> The piece of this job that looks doable in the near term is to coach the author through a bit of scene modeling and get them to articulate what is in their scene, some principal properties of each such thing, and principal relationships among these things.  </s>
<s> Then we will be getting somewhere.  </s>
<s> This will create a guide to their scene in an entity/relationship/attribute graph with navigable relationships and speakable attributes.  </s>
<s> It's up to the format to create the marriage by which this gloss infiltrates or decorates the scene the author has constructed by which to tell their story.  </s>
<s> Once we understand how to combine more- and less- critical information in the computer representation, the whole plan is scalable to provide more or less drill-down depth as the topic and the content developer's skills allow.  </s>
<s> [The URCC primitives: "What's there?" "What can I do?" are still the core of what we have to lure out of authors.  </s>
<s> Imagine yourself answering these questions over the phone...] Furthermore, there is a body of practice to pick up and extend, already out there on the web, that will take away the worst of the problem and if systematically applied across the web, leave a more universally usable state of practice than what we have now.  </s>
<s> This is how GIS information is served on quote map sites unquote.  </s>
<s> A GIS-like information base is usable enough in diverse enough modes of access as to be considered a 'universal design' level of information architecture.  </s>
<s> I claim that "universally accessible GIS is readily achievable," and "GIS-like" is a good working notion for a class of information structures that the authors should be led to create (at least for now).  </s>
<s> Accessing these information structures takes the right sorts of access methods, but these are systematically implementable in libraries and  </s>
<s> pragmas and don't have to be re-invented graphic by graphic.  </s>
<s> Web content developers can be led to an 'aha' experience saying "this is more doable than it first looked" by reviewing how the information that is conventionally considered "map information" is also served [on the competitive map sites] through verbal dialogs as well.  </s>
<s> As Tom reminds us, this is critical to our success; perfect guidelines that fail in the EO process are not doing any PWDs any good.  </s>
<s> Talking about creating a GIS-like infiltration of the scene presented on the web screen helps the content designer/developer think in graph terms and not be forced to take the harder conceptual leap to a linear narrative.  </s>
<s> Anything we do to lower the potential barrier to getting over the belief that it's too hard is golden, is critical to our success.  </s>
<s> Presented with a tree-view presentation of the objects they have identified in their scene, an author can readily from this view create a sensible tour, a linear reading order.  </s>
<s> Separating the questions of contents from order will make the job more doable by real people in the content development activity.  </s>
<s> Appropriate use of hierarchy in the scene description eases the dependency on linear order.  </s>
<s> This is especially important in the Tufte domain where the information graphs are not gracefully projectable into a sequence.  </s>
<s> Users can, after all, follow non-linear graphs of navigable relations so long as they are marked well enough with labels that evoke axes of relationship that stick in the user's head.  </s>
<s> The easiest way to do this of course is to evoke patterns of relationship that are common in the users' life experience.  </s>
<s> But there are lots of multidimensional tuples of axes that are common enough experience so we don't have to wrestle every data space into an essay outline.  </s>
