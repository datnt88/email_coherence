<s> There's AS_DOC and AS-EDIT for abstract scheams but I don't see one for Load and Save.  </s>

<s> Subject: feature string for Load-Save  </s>
<s> Fixed. "LS-Load" for the DOMBuilder and "LS-Save" for the DOMWriter.  </s>
<s> Synchronous mode is always required.  </s>
<s> Asynchronous mode is required if you support "LS-Load-Async".  </s>
<s> Not sure what to do with the DocumentLS interface yet.  </s>
<s> more to come on that in the future.  </s>

<s> Is there a feature string for testing the various DOM3 DocumentAS interface?  </s>
<s> The spec says " One feature string for the AS-editing interfaces listed in this section is "AS-EDIT" and another feature string for document-editing interfaces is "AS-DOC"."  </s>
<s> However, neither of these obviously applies to the DocumentAS interface which falls under the heading "Validation and Other Interfaces."  </s>

<s> Since the functionality under "Validation and Other Interfaces" is common to both AS-editing and document-editing, a retrieval of either "AS-EDIT" or "AS-DOC" could be interpreted as having support of these features.  </s>
<s> However, if document-editing is to be completely independent of AS-editing, then perhaps another feature string should be made for functionality under this section.  </s>
<s> We will discuss in our AS ET telcon.  </s>
