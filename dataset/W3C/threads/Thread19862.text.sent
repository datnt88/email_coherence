I have compiled and installed Amaya 1.2 on Solaris 2.5.1 using gcc 2.7.2.3.f.1 and am seeing a number of odd behaviors. 
I'll stick to just one for this post, to be sure this is the right place for this. 
I am having great difficulty editing the Title of an HTML page (created from scratch by Amaya). 
Once I get past the Motif annoyance of having to have the cursor over the field I am trying to type in, I can type in the Title field of the Formatted_view window, but the changes do not show up in the Structure_view window, nor do they get saved. 
Currently, making the changes in the Structure_view window works. 
(I thought there was a period of time a few days ago where I could only type one or two characters at a time, and then had to click on the spot again before typing another character or two.) If this is a motif configuration issue - please just point me to the right docs, or at least where to look for them :-( Also - for the next release, could I suggest/request that some of the associated docs (e.g., configuration) which are currently available as web pages at w3c.org, be included in the distribution? 
This might save some frantic hunting.

Yes, you have reached the right forum for this kind of question. 
When you have made some changes in the Title field of the Formatted_view, just hit the return key to validate the changes. 
This field works exactly in the same way as the Address field, which is above: when the return key is hit, Amaya takes into accound the edits you have made. 
This is explained in the on-line documentation, in the last section of Vincent.

Yes it is. 
I know, it's annoying. 
But at the moment, you need to enter the text within the Motif form and finish by a Return. 
Without the Return Amaya doesn't receive the new Title contents. 
It's why the new Title is not displayed in the Structure view and not saved. 
Yes, it is. 
The right doc is the "Motif Programmer's Reference". 
If you solve the problem before us, please send us the patch. 
A large part of it is available through the help menu. 
What page do you suggest to add ? 
Irene.
