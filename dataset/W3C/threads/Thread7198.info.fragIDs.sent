<s> The requirements MUST NOT tell the implementation authors how to do their job.  </s>
<s> This requirement spec oversteps its bounds when it moves away from stating goals to dictating implementation, as it does in section 4.9.2.*.  </s>
<s> If the authors of the requirements spec do not like the current implementation they are free to comment on the mailing list.  </s>
<s> They should not, however, use the requirements document as a backdoor to put in their preferred implementations.  </s>
<s> Yaron  </s>
<s> Defining the boundaries between requirement and solutions is not always easy and univocal, and surely depends on the abstraction that is needed in each case.  </s>
<s> We probably need a more abstract set of requirements, that do not hint not only to the preferred solution, but even to the protocol that needs to be addressed for the solution.  </s>
<s> I propose thus that we remove any mention of URLs and HTTP, and just refer to a more anodine and agreable "relevant standards", letting implementers decide on what to change.  </s>
<s> At the end of this mail I propose a different draft for section 4.9.2, where implementation hints are further removed from the text.  </s>
<s> Fabio P.S. You hint that the current implementation was ignored when drafting the requirements.  </s>
<s> On the contrary, these requirements are a more or less literal merge of two previous documents, that were written and circulated BEFORE the current implementation.  </s>
<s> That the requirements and the implementation did not match we were able to notice: an agenda item was proposed to reconcile them.  </s>
<s> But I wouldn't attribute automatically the implementation any birthright, or the requirements' drafters any sneaky attitude.  </s>
<s> 4.9.  </s>
<s> Versioning In the following discussion, "versioned resource" means a resource that has the structure of a directed acyclic graph, each node of which is a version.  </s>
<s> "Version" means a node in this structure, which is itself a resource.  </s>
<s> Each version typically stands in a "derived from" relationship to its predecessor(s).  </s>
<s> 4.9.1.  </s>
<s> General Principles 4.9.1.1.  </s>
<s> Stableness of versions.  </s>
<s> Most versioning systems are intended to provide an accurate record of the history of evolution of a document.  </s>
<s> This accuracy is ensured by the fact that a version eventually becomes "frozen" and immutable.  </s>
<s> Once a version is frozen, further changes will create new versions rather than modifying the original.  </s>
<s> In order for caching and persistent references to be properly maintained, a client must be able to determine that a version has been frozen.  </s>
<s> Any successful attempt to retrieve a frozen version of a resource will always retrieve exactly the same content, or return an error if that version (or the resource itself) are no longer available.  </s>
<s> [Removed mentions of URLs and HTTP Entity tags.  </s>
<s> Removed freezing behaviour for locked and unlocked resources]  </s>
<s> 4.9.1.2.  </s>
<s> Policy-free Versioning.  </s>
<s> Haake and Hicks [5] have identified the notion of versioning styles (referred to here as versioning policies, to reflect the nature of client/server interaction) as one way to think about the different policies that versioning systems implement.  </s>
<s> Versioning policies include decisions on the shape of version histories (linear or branched), the granularity of change tracking, locking requirements made by a server, etc.  </s>
<s> The protocol should clearly identify the policies that it dictates and the policies that are left variable for the implementations, and work towards inter-operability across servers and clients with regards to the latter ones.  </s>
<s> [The policy-free requirements were mitigated]  </s>
<s> 4.9.1.3.  </s>
<s> Separation of resource retrieval and concurrency control.  </s>
<s> The protocol must separate the reservation and release of versioned resources from their access methods.  </s>
<s> Provided that consistency constraints are met before, during and after the modification of a versioned resource, no single policy for accessing a resource should be enforced by the protocol.  </s>
<s> For instance, a user may declare an intention to write before or after retrieving a resource via GET, may PUT a resource without releasing the lock, and might even request a lock via HTTP, but then retrieve the document using another communication channel such as FTP.  </s>
<s> [Not changed.  </s>
<s> It looks reasonable, not implementation-oriented, and fully justifiable to me.]  </s>
<s> 4.9.1.4 Parsimony in client-server interactions.  </s>
<s> Versioning a resource implies that a potentially large quantity of important information about a resource that is known to the server providing it is unknown to the client receiving it.  </s>
<s> The protocol must make sure that the amount of interactions between the client and the server in order for the client to obtain this information is kept to a logical minimum, preventing unneeded or avoidable further requests.  </s>
<s> [New]  </s>
<s> 4.9.2.  </s>
<s> Functional Requirements 4.9.2.1.  </s>
<s> Referring to a versioned resource.  </s>
<s> There should be a way to refer to a versioned resource as a whole.  </s>
<s> Some queries about the versioning status of a resource do not apply only to one version of that resource, but to the resource as a whole.  </s>
<s> Furthermore some operations may affect all versions of a resource, rather than any specific version.  </s>
<s> In these cases a way to refer to the whole version is required.  </s>
<s> 4.9.2.2.  </s>
<s> Referring to specific versions.  </s>
<s> There should be a way to refer to each individual versions of a versioned resource.  </s>
<s> This means that a version is itself a resource.  </s>
<s> This is required for version-specific linking, and for non-versioning client support.  </s>
<s> [4.9.2.1 and 4.9.2.2 were inverted.  </s>
<s> Mentions of URLs removed.]  </s>
<s> 4.9.2.3.  </s>
<s> A way for the client to determine whether a resource is versioned, or whether a resource is itself a version of another resource.  </s>
<s> The protocol should provide a way for the client to be able to determine important versioning facts about a resource.  </s>
<s> [Was 4.9.2.6.  </s>
<s> Mentions of URLs removed.  </s>
<s> Added further restriction on the identification of a versioned resource] 4.9.2.4.  </s>
<s> Referring to a server-defined "default", "current" or "tip" version of a resource.  </s>
<s> The protocol must guarantee that a significant result, in the form of a default version of the resource, is returned for requests from non-versioning clients and requests where no special version information is provided.  </s>
<s> This does not rule out the possibility of a server returning an error when no sensible default exists.  </s>
<s> [Was 4.9.2.3.  </s>
<s> Removed implementation hints and justifications] 4.9.2.5.  </s>
<s> It should be possible for the clients to determine the following interesting facts about a resource *without having the resource itself*: whether it is a versioned resource, how to get the default version, how to get the whole resource if it is a version of a versioned resource.  </s>
<s> Being able to determine these facts of a versioned resource makes it possible to implement browsing the version tree and deducing facts about it without necessarily getting the relevant resources.  </s>
<s> This also supports some comparison operations: It makes it possible to determine whether two references designate versions of the same versioned resource.  </s>
<s> [Was 4.9.2.7.  </s>
<s> Trasformed so as to specify the functionality required, rather than the way to get it.] 4.9.2.6.  </s>
<s> It should be possible for the clients to determine and access the following related resources of a version of a resource: o root version(s) of this version o predecessor version(s) of this version o successor version(s) of this version o default version of this version [also in 4.9.2.4.  </s>
<s> Redundant?]  </s>
<s> It must be possible in some way for a versioning client to access versions related to a resource currently being exhamined.  </s>
<s> It is not strictly necessary that these operations are avaiable without having the resource first.  </s>
<s> [Was 4.9.2.4.  </s>
<s> Removed mentions to URLs] 4.9.2.7.  </s>
<s> A way to retrieve the complete version topology for a resource.  </s>
<s> There should be a way to retrieve information about all versions of a resource.  </s>
<s> The format for this information must be standardized so that the basic information can be used by all clients.  </s>
<s> Other specialized formats should be accomodated, for servers and clients that require information that cannot be included in the standard topology.  </s>
<s> [Was 4.9.2.5.  </s>
<s> Untouched] [4.9.2.8. (Lock).  </s>
<s> Removed as handled in section 4.3 "Locking" already.]  </s>
<s> [4.9.2.9. (Unlock).  </s>
<s> Removed as handled in section 4.3 "Locking" already.]  </s>
<s> [4.9.2.10.  </s>
<s> (Reserve).  </s>
<s> Removed as handled in section 4.4 "Notification of Intent to Edit".  </s>
<s> I prefer the word "Reserve", though] [4.9.2.11.  </s>
<s> (Release).  </s>
<s> Removed since I feel overlaps with proposed "Uncheckout", to be put somewhere else (for instance, section 4.4 "Notification of Intent to Edit").  </s>
<s> I prefer the word "Release", though.]  </s>
<s> 4.9.2.12.  </s>
<s> A way to submit a new version of a resource (PUT).  </s>
<s> The server should be able to attach it to the correct part of the version tree, based on the version number associated with the resource before its modification.  </s>
<s> [Unchanged.  </s>
<s> Possibly this is not the best place to put it.  </s>
<s> How about generalizing section 4.6 "Partial Write", and have it become "Write" (including partial and total)?]  </s>
<s> 4.9.2.13.  </s>
<s> A way for a client to request a version identifier for a checked out version.  </s>
<s> Such an identifier will not be used by any other client in the meantime.  </s>
<s> The server may refuse the request.  </s>
<s> [Unchanged] 4.9.2.14.  </s>
<s> A way for a client to propose a version identifier upon submitting a version of a resource.  </s>
<s> The server may refuse to to use the client's suggested version identifier.  </s>
<s> [Unchanged] [4.9.2.15.  </s>
<s> (Metadata).  </s>
<s> Removed as handled in section 4.1 "Attributes" already.]  </s>
<s> [4.9.2.16.  </s>
<s> (A way for a server to provide a version identifier to be used for a resource in further operations).  </s>
<s> Removed since it is strictly an implementation decision.  </s>
<s> The fuctionality it was needed for is contained in the following 4.9.2.17] 4.9.2.17.  </s>
<s> A way for a client to query the server for information about a version tree, including which versions are locked, which are reserved for editing, and by whom (Session Tracking).  </s>
<s> [Changed to reflect implementation-independence.] 4.9.3.  </s>
<s> Rationale [Unchanged] Versioning in the context of the world-wide web offers a variety of benefits: It provides infrastructure for efficient and controlled management of large evolving web sites.  </s>
<s> Modern configuration management systems are built on some form of repository that can track the revision history of individual resources, and provide the higher-level tools to manage those saved versions.  </s>
<s> Basic versioning capabilities are required to support such systems.  </s>
<s> It allows parallel development and update of single resources.  </s>
<s> Since versioning systems register change by creating new objects, they enable simultaneous write access by allowing the creation of variant versions.  </s>
<s> Many also provide merge support to ease the reverse operation.  </s>
<s> It provides a framework for access control over resources.  </s>
<s> While specifics vary, most systems provide some method of controlling or tracking access to enable collaborative resource development.  </s>
<s> It allows browsing through past and alternative versions of a resource.  </s>
<s> Frequently the modification and authorship history of a resource is critical information in itself.  </s>
<s> It provides stable names that can support externally stored links for annotation and link-server support.  </s>
<s> Both annotation and link servers frequently need to store stable references to portions of resources that are not under their direct control.  </s>
<s> By providing stable states of resources, version control systems allow not only stable pointers into those resources, but also well-defined methods to determine the relationships of those states of a resource.  </s>
<s> It allows explicit semantic representation of single resources with multiple states.  </s>
<s> A versioning system directly represents the fact that a resource has an explicit history, and a persistent identity across the various states it has had during the course of that history.  </s>
<s> This seems reasonable, although I know that some DMSs (intentionally) do not enforce it.  </s>
<s> It looks to me as though the WebDAV spec also does not enforce it.  </s>
<s> There is nothing to stop a client from requesting the same version id for checkin as the version id it checked out, and there is nothing that says the server should not comply with such a request.  </s>
<s> What's not clear is how far we are willing to go in "working towards interoperability across servers and clients with regards to the latter ones."  </s>
<s> I don't see consensus on this in the group.  </s>
<s> Well, I can't figure out whether the current spec satisfies 4.9.1.3 or not, which tells me that I don't really understand what the requirement is.  </s>
<s> It's true that there are separate operations for GET, LOCK, and CHECKOUT.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, CHECKOUT may implicitly do a lock and a get.  </s>
<s> Furthermore, I think the assumption is that the server (not the user) decides what order things have to happen and what sequence of operations is treated as atomic.  </s>
<s> Does this satisfy your requirement or not?  </s>
<s> I think if the group likes 4.9.1.4, we should make it more generic and move it to the general principles at the top of the paper.  </s>
<s> I think you've pointed out a general problem that we haven't really thought about, and that is that versioning, collections, and attributes all have implications for existing HTTP methods.  </s>
<s> Once we introduce these new kinds of objects, we have to think about how GET, PUT, DELETE, and our new COPY and MOVE operations work for them.  </s>
<s> Well, yes and no.  </s>
<s> We've said that there is a requirement to be able to set attribute values.  </s>
<s> But if there is a requirement for specific version-related attributes, that needs to be stated here.  </s>
<s> And if there is a requirement that it be possible to set these attributes as part of the checkin operation, that needs to be stated here, too.  </s>
