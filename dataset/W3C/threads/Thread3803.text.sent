-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- Hash: SHA1 Modified Files: Tag: validator-0_6_0-branch footer.html 
Log Message: Good question: how does one know which version of the validator they are using? 
Important info, e.g for bug reports in bugzilla. 
In the dev version, the top banner gives that info, otherwise it's harder. 
Thus, adding a version number to the footer. 
In the beta version, the version number is already given in the header. 
You've added it to the footer of the beta version. 
IOW, the version in the footer is redundant. 
I'd also say that adding it to current production is pointless provided we make our release target of next Thursday; since current beta -- which has the version number -- then becomes current prod.

Either way is fine with me, though. 
olivier -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- Hash: SHA1 I prefer nuking it from the footer and keeping it in the header. 
The footer looks like crap with it and having it in the header stands a chance of getting noticed. 
We could deemphasise is somehow if you find it distracting there.
