<s> Hi folks, we have an FAQ (Frequently asked Questions) page that was published to answer questions about ATAG 1.0 Should we think about updating the page?  </s>
<s> In thinking about the Wombat draft I came up with the following thoughts in question and answer form, and in looking over the existing page I noted that we could probably improve it in a few areas.  </s>
<s> This might make it more useful to us, and particularly to new members or prospective new members.  </s>
<s> anyway, the existing page (linked from the Publications section of our home page) is at http://www.w3.org/2000/02/ATAG-FAQ and the stuff I came up with  </s>
<s> about Wombat is as follows Why a new version?  </s>
<s> Following more implementation experience of ATAG 1.0 (which went to Recommendation before the phase of Candidate Recommendation was part of the Process, and did a fairly rudimentary assessment of existing evaluation) it is clear that there are a few issues that need to be clarified, but which are best resolved by more than errata-level changes.  </s>
<s> Further reasons for proceeding with a draft now are outlined under Why "Wombat"?  </s>
<s> below.  </s>
<s> Why "Wombat"?  </s>
<s> One of the most common implementation experiences was realising that there were a number of redundancies in the way that WCAG 1.0 requirements were expressed.  </s>
<s> This was part of the input that the WCAG group took into account in deciding to develop WCAG 2.0.  </s>
<s> ATAG 1.0 refers normatively to WCAG 1.0 for its requirements on content.  </s>
<s> Naturally, when WCAG 2.0 is available as a Recommendation the group would like to release, as soon afterwards as possible, a new version of the ATAG Recommendation that normatively refers to WCAG 2.0.  </s>
<s> In order to do so, particularly to complete a Candidate Recommendation Process it is therefore important to have the draft and supporting materials (updates for the "Techniques for Authoring Tool Accessibility" Note are particularly helpful) prepared as far in advance as possible.  </s>
<s> This opens up the possiblity that a new version of ATAG will be prepared, but there will not be a new Recommendation for WCAG ready.  </s>
<s> In this event, the group wanted to keep open the possibility of publishing a 1.X update, as it felt that it would be a lot clearer if the major version number was paralell to that of the version of WCAG on which it depends.  </s>
<s> What is new?  </s>
<s> * There are some requirements that have been clarified - for example in this draft it becomes explicit that conformance can be achieved by tools which do not interrupt the workflow of the user, which answer a common question of developers implementing the specification.  </s>
<s> * There are some small changes in priority - one requirement and some sub parts of requirements are reduced in priority.  </s>
<s> * This document draws its glossary from the "combined WAI glossary" - as a starting point towards having a single glossary from which multiple specifications draw definitions.  </s>
<s> * Some requirements have been made more explicit through changes to checkpoint text.  </s>
<s> * All checkpoints now have a statement of the required functionality for conformance to the checkpoint, and an associated informative description of good implementation beyond the basic requirements More detailed analysis is available in the changes history What is not new?  </s>
<s> * At this stage the draft still refers to WCAG 1.0, as the WCAG 2.0 document is not yet sufficiently stable to draft a normative dependency.  </s>
<s> * This document keeps the same Guidelines, Checkpoints and linked informative Techniques, and the same priority and conformance scheme that is used in the other WAI Guidelines documents * There is not yet a draft of the "Techniques for Authoring Tool Accessibility" that synchronises it to this draft.  </s>
<s> Publishing an update to the existing Note is the current work item for the group, and producing such a synchronised draft is the next one.  </s>
<s> * The requirements on implementors are mostly unchanged, and in some cases reduced in priority.  </s>
<s> this looks good except for the spelling of parallel  </s>
<s> My take on the wording: Why a new version?  </s>
<s> Because ATAG 1.0 went to Recommendation before the phase of Candidate Recommendation was part of the W3C Process, only a fairly rudimentary assessment of existing implementations was done at that time.  </s>
<s> As more implementation experience with ATAG 1.0 is accumulated, it has become clear that there are several issues in need of clarification.  </s>
<s> Since some of these issues, require changes that go beyond the level of errata, the group decided that a new version of ATAG was desirable.  </s>
<s> Further impetus for a new version is the ongoing development of a new version of WCAG, on which ATAG normatively depends.  </s>
<s> Why "Wombat"?  </s>
<s> ATAG 1.0 refers normatively to WCAG 1.0 for its requirements on content.  </s>
<s> Ideally, in keeping with this model, the group would like to release, the new version of the ATAG Recommendation as ATAG 2.0 as soon as possible after the release of WCAG 2.0.  </s>
<s> However, in order to complete the Candidate Recommendation Process, it is important to have the draft and supporting materials ("Techniques" Note, etc.) prepared as far in advance as possible.  </s>
<s> This opens up the possibility that a new version of ATAG will be ready before WCAG 2.0 has been released.  </s>
<s> In this event, the group wanted to keep open the possibility of publishing the new version as a 1.X update, in order to keep the major ATAG version number parallel with the WCAG version number on which it depends.  </s>

<s> I would like to suggest another question to put at the end after the suggested additional questions: Who should use "Wombat"?  </s>
<s> Authoring tool developers should use "Wombat" now that a public draft is available.  </s>
<s> This is in anticipation of needing implementation experience before achieving candidate recommendation.  </s>
<s> Please note that the draft may change etc.etc.etc.  </s>
<s> If this is not the case, then why point them to ATAG 1.0 if we know all the changes?  </s>

<s> Hi all, I suggest the following changes: 1.- In: "Why are these guidelines necessary?  </s>
<s> Many of today's authoring tools are difficult to use and/or they create content that is difficult to access for people with disabilities.  </s>
<s> ..." 2.- In: "Do authors have to use conformant tools to create accessible Web pages?  </s>
<s> It is possible to create accessible Web pages with non-conformant tools, by using either a text editor, WYSIWYG, or other editor, and directly applying the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 while creating the page.  </s>
<s> This may involve more steps than if using a conformant tool, for instance going into the source code to ensure that the tool is generating valid code, or performing steps manually to check the accessibility of a page.  </s>
<s> For authors who are less familiar with insert the markup languages and/or /insert the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0, authoring tools that conform to ATAG 1.0 may significantly facilitate production of accessible Web sites."  </s>
<s> 3.- In: ...be easy or difficult to use?  </s>
<s> I believe that the fact that a tool supports ATAG affects its ease of use.  </s>
<s> For example, the alternative texts of the buttons can help many people to use the tool.  </s>
<s> But I don't have a suggestion for the writing of this point because, as is clear, I am not a master of English.  </s>

<s> comments inline - CMN I suggest the following changes: 1.- In: "Why are these guidelines necessary?  </s>
<s> Many of today's authoring tools are difficult to use and/or they create content that is difficult to access for people with disabilities.  </s>
<s> ..." CMN I agree 2.- In: "Do authors have to use conformant tools to create accessible Web pages?  </s>

<s> CMN I disagree on this point.  </s>
<s> There are some tools that will help a user who is not familiar with markup langauges, such as WYSIWYG tools.  </s>
<s> But tools that conform to ATAG need not help a user who is not familiar with HTML to learn HTML.  </s>
<s> For example, a code-editing tool does not need to provide an HTML tutorial to conform, although it does need to explain what to do to make the result accessible.  </s>
<s> I don't think that's enough help to justify the claim.  </s>
<s> 3.- In: ...be easy or difficult to use?  </s>
<s> I believe that the fact that a tool supports ATAG affects its ease of use.  </s>
<s> For example, the alternative texts of the buttons can help many people to use the tool.  </s>
<s> CMN I do agree with this.  </s>
<s> The existing text: Authoring tools are easy or difficult to use according to the level of user experience they presume.  </s>
<s> The fact that a tool supports ATAG 1.0 should not directly affect its ease of use, with the exception that when authoring accessible pages, an ATAG-conformant tool would be easier to use than a similar tool that was not ATAG-conformant since the first tool would automate some steps involved in making a Web page accessible.  </s>
<s> My proposal: Authoring tools are easy or difficult to use for different users based on differences in their interfaces.  </s>
<s> ATAG requires that tools make producing accessible content one of the easiest things to do with the tool, and requires that the tool has certain features to ensure that it can be used by people with disabilities.  </s>
<s> This will have some effect on the overall ease-of-use for some tools.  </s>
<s> But ATAG does not require fundamental changes to the user interface of tools, so there will still be differences in tools, to suit different types of user.  </s>

<s> I have now linked the FAQ from the WAI page, and have asked the EO group for comments since that is one of the things they do.  </s>
<s> I incorporated Jan's changes, since they didn't seem to me to alter the substance at all, but have not incorporated any of the changes proposed by Emmanuelle yet, since they seem significant.  </s>
<s> I think that the best way to deal with this document in the future is to propose modifications to the list, and when they are accepted by the working group they can be incorporated into the FAQ.  </s>
<s> Hopefully it will have enough changes made soon to be a useful introduction/overview of the group - at the moment I think it is still heavily oriented towards ATAG 1, and the style seems a bit odd to me, but I assume that will change as people use it and comment.  </s>
