<s> Hi, I have had this bug across a couple of different versions, and it is intermittent but repeats reasonably often in the same circumstances.  </s>
<s> The result is that my X server quits.  </s>
<s> The cause is harder to find.  </s>
<s> It happens when I try to open might only happen when I have had my Amaya session running for a day or more.  </s>
<s> It has happened repeatedly with Amaya 5.3 and 6.1 - in both cases using the fink package for Macintosh OS X  </s>
<s> (I hope that helps to track it down.  </s>
<s> It is hard to find because it is intermittent but I will try to provide anything new I learn).  </s>

<s> It could be due to a lack of resources?  </s>
<s> I guess it's a Motif version?  </s>
<s> Yes please, try to remember the ten last commands.  </s>
<s> I don't think so - anything else I do on the system works fine, and usually a lack of resources means everything just slows down for a while - it is rare to have a complete crash of my X server.  </s>
<s> Sorry, yes it is.  </s>

<s> Some more information: It happens when I follow the link from http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/ which is marked 'Member Page', and have to authenticate.  </s>
<s> It is reproducible under those circumstances... Start X server amaya http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF Follow the link 'Member Page' and the X server crashes.  </s>
