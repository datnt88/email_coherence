Hi, Len I believe that dynamically generated pages could better handle pages where a left column contains links and reference information and a column to the right of that contains text. 
The screen readers which can read a column at a time will read all that stuff in the left column first. 
Then it reads the column with the text and then the right column which probably has more links. 
This reading order is not most optimal for blind users. 
Decorative images can be left out since they can be distracting to blind users with little useful information. 
Informational images might be better handled by having alert boxes which have a long description which can be accessed on demand. 
Or, having a section towards the end with the various image descriptions. 
If the page is from a catalog where description is important, the dynamically generated web page could have a detailed description of the coat instead of an image on pages for sighted people. 
The description should be integrated into the text flow for easier reading. 
Sighted users tend to not like text compressed together. 
More whitespace is preferred. 
Blind often like more compressed text on the screen since they have to interact with their screen reader less (depending on the screen reader). 
I've had requests to use smaller fonts since that puts more text in the window. 
My impression is that the fewer of these "speed bumps" which cause distraction in reading, the easier it is for blind users. 
It might be helpful to try some experiments. 
Scott Hi Scott, You talk at the end of your note about the potential benefit of dynamically generating different versions of pages. 
Of the examples you gave the one where the benefit is most obvious is the radio button vs. drop down list. 
Radio buttons are more convenient in many situations for sighted people (especially when there are a lot of ratings arranged table fashion) but in a previous discussion on this list blind users pointed out the advantages of dropdown lists while screenreading. 
And this isn't just a hypothetical situation: I'm facing this exact situation right now while advising some folks how to make an online survey. 
In the other examples though, you described solutions that didn't require dynamic generation. 
Could you give additional examples in which the advantages of different forms is more obvious? 
For example, a case where text is laid out in a table, and is understandable when linearized, but could be read more conveniently if not linearized? 
By the way, reading order is one situation where style sheet layout could do the same thing as dynamic generation. 
To bad we can't count on that in visual browsers at the moment. 
Len Hi, Len Basically, I would agree that a user having a choice would be desirable. 
The issue of best use of resources is a consideration. 
While some aspects of accessibility could be easily incorporated into the default web pages, some aren't. 
I believe one of the most challenging has to do with visual layout. 
Given that CSS is not standardized, it will be easier to use tables for layout. 
Second, layouts using tables probably won't transform very easily into a more linearized form. 
In this area, I think it makes sense in a situation where pages are generated dynamically, not to put the effort in trying to balance off visual appearance with accessibility. 
The visual experience is so compelling that it will cause designers to often ignore the accessibility aspects. 
I believe providing for customized web pages for blind users provides for accessibility without going against the strong visual design current of the default page. 
With regards to the issue of text-only, I believe that is more a matter of increasing awareness in the population. 
It is probably not that dissimilar from getting the population to understand that providing braille to accomodate is not the anwser since only 10% of blind people read braille. 
Scott PS An interesting question, though probably philosophical, to consider is whether blind and sighted people actually do see the same page. 
Blind people users use screen readers which affect their experience of web pages in some significant ways. 
I'm not clear that it is very useful to push for the same presentation for sighted and blind users. 
The issue is whether efficiency is more important or communication. 
Well like I say I'm pushing for both so user has choice of the optimally formatted page like the ones your talking about, or the default page with access features, so that people with disabilities are seeing the same page. 
I believe that your point is: given finite resources by page authors do we want to ask them to put in the effort to make the default page accessible or focus their attention on the dynamically generated page. 
I've tried to echo what I've heard, albeit in a slightly different context, from users who are blind. 
At this point I'm going to defer to opinions from those users whom I'm sure we'll be hearing from directly. 
You also asked me to clarify the following: quote "3. 
Even if dynamically generated pages are really equivalent, they can "send the message" that so called "text-only" pages are needed... and promote their use where they are hand written and subject to error." 
Hi All, There has been a great deal of discussion about the use of tables and the problems they cause for people who are blind when used for design purposes. 
I'm speaking strictly here of tables used for design, not to contain tabular data. 
I'm wondering how much of a problem such pages pose for folks who are blind? 
The browsing combinations I use all decolumnize these types of pages in some fashion. 
These include Lynx, Home Page Reader, Internet Explorer with either JFW 3.31 or Window-Eyes 3.1. 
Kelly Hi, I think that there might be a business reason why various pages use tables in web pages. 
If a company is using web page to present advertising as a revenue stream, the more space they can use for advertising, they greater their income. 
Using tables with different background colors in cells is a way to compress more information into an area.
