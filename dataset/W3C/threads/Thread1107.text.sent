Hi, When tidying html and outputting as xml, there is a symbol that is appearing at the start of my XML files, ascii value is 0x98. 
How do I stop it appearing? 
I assume this is the 'unicode Byte Order Mark character' that is mentioned in the Tidy configuration options reference. 
However if I set 'output-bom' to false the symbol still appears. 
I've tried using various char encodings setting all these char-encoding, input-encoding, output-encoding to: ascii, latin1, raw, and utf16 --the character is always there regardless of what encoding I use. 
The char is stopping tidy output as xml from being read correctly by .net's 
C# XPathDocument class. 
When I manually remove the char all works fine. 
I am using Charles Reitzel's COM/ATL dll. 
Many thanks and regards, ..matthew Hi Matt, Can you send a sample file w/ config? 
0x98 is either an illegal character or a Windows 1251 "small tilde" (should be translated to U+02DC). 
Can you reproduce the problem with the command line tool? 
If so, then we can treat it as a Tidy issue. 
Otherwise, my bad. 
There is still a spurious extra newline (0xD) problem with some encodings. 
May be related. 
take it easy, Charlie Hi Charlie, I can not reproduce the problem from the command line tool, the char 0x98 never gets inserted regardless of whether using ascii, latin1, raw, or utf. 
The sample files will follow in a seperate email so the lists don't get them. 
--Anyone on the lists who wants them please say so. 
Thanks and regards, ..matthew No, the byte order mark would be 00 00 FE FF, FF FE 00 00, 00 00 FF FE, FE FF 00 00, FE FF, FF FE or EF BB BF depending on the encoding, 0x98 never indicates a byte order mark. 
If you are unable to reproduce this using the command line tool or the pure C interface, please ask Charles privately (or wherever he may provide support to this) and please don't crosspost between html-tidy@w3.org and tidy-develop@lists.sourceforge.net . 
Actually, this list has long been used for support of JTidy and various Tidy Add-Ons. 
E.g. the DocBook conversion tool, HTML-Kit, TidyCOM/TidyGUI and, of late, my stuff. 
A great many Tidy bugs have been found and fixed through such reports. 
Regardless of the interface used, it is a good idea to reproduce the problem, if possible, with the command line tool. 
It also helps to isolate the specific configuration options and markup that reproduce the problem. 
Agreed, better to pick one or the other. 
But the orginal message is really a support issue and, therefore html-tidy@w3.org is preferred over the DEV list. 
See http://tidy.sourceforge.net/docs/faq.html#support take it easy, Charlie
