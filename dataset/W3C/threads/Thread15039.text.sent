In the 29 May 2003 teleconference participants on the call agreed to the following resolutions regarding placeholder text for form controls: 1. 
It is no longer necessary to provide default text for form controls, since user agents now support form controls regardless of their placeholder text. 
WCAG 2.0 will not have a requirement for this. 2. Since this guideline is no longer relevant and fulfilling it is sometimes problematic for Web pages that otherwise conform to WCAG 1.0, it is desirable to remove it from WCAG 1.0. 
We will therefore issue an erratum to WCAG 1.0. 
I will provide proposed text for the erratum in a separate message so we can argue about that without confusing that discussion with ratification of the principle reflected in these decisions. 
If you object to this resolution, please indicate the objection on the list before Wednesday, 4 June 2003. 
If no objections are raised we will consider this accepted by the list and close the issue (pending acceptance of the erratum text). 
Michael From: Michael Cooper Sent: Tuesday, May 27, 2003 4:02 PM Subject: [B259] Proposal: remove default form text requirements Following Roberto's subject line formatting suggestion for now... 
The Techniques subgroup reviewed the requirement under WCAG 1.0 Checkpoint 10.4 [1] to provide default placeholder text for form controls. 
This is an "until user agents" one and the belief of the group is that it has expired - user agents for which this guideline was developed are no longer in common use. 
Conformance to this guideline also introduces design and technical problems. 
Therefore we propose that there be no technique (and therefore no Guideline) under WCAG 2.0 that requires default form text. 
This issue is sufficiently problematic for Web sites seeking WCAG 1.0 conformance that we also suggest that the group add an entry to the Errata for WCAG 1.0 [2] indicating that Checkpoint 10.4 is no longer relevant. 
Please indicate your vote on this.

(My way of indicating that I'm just an informed spectator, not a WG member.) "Erratum" seems a bad choice for an update which was planned from the start -- the phrasing "Until user agents handle empty controls correctly ..." indicates that this is not a mistake per se, but a simple update. 
Accordingly, I think that this -- and any other "until user agent" clauses which are being phased out -- should be issued not as errata but as updates, perhaps as "WCAG 1.0 (Second Edition)" just as XHTML 1.0 was released in 2000 and a Section Edition in 2002. 
This, I think, would make more sense to Web developers who have been working with WCAG 1.0 for years and would be startled to learn that there was an _error_ in the original. 
Truth is, there wasn't -- so this should be presented as a natural update, not a bugfix. 
The circumstances of the checkpoint changed, but the checkpoint's validity (given broken assistive technology/UIs) did not. 
Also, as a bonus, this could easily lead to more attention to WCAG 1.0 (and ultimately to WCAG 2.0) through the issuance of the Second Edition than a mere erratum issue would provide. 
The actual work would be minimal -- simply folding in the additional updates and errata which have already been identified by the working group.
