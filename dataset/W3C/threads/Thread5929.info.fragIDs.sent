<s> Dear WS-CHOR team, Im follow the very insightful discussions in this team as interesting in / teaching the subject of business collaborations.  </s>
<s> However Im also a Swedish delegate of UN/CEFACT UMM/BPSS team and I feel that I must point out that the presentation about BPSS given by Jean-Jacques Dubray must be considered as his own view and not the view of the UMM team or members such as me.  </s>
<s> best regards /anders  </s>
<s> Absolutely and thanks for pointing this out!  </s>
<s> I invited Jean Jaques to give his personal view.  </s>
<s> Martin.  </s>
<s> mm1: What is your view Anders, in the context of your area of expertise and/or as a member of this team?  </s>
<s> Thank you.  </s>
<s> View of what Monica?  </s>
<s> You know my view of next maintenance release of BPSS which I posted in appropriate BPSS team forum.  </s>
<s> I dont want to burden this with out of scope issues.  </s>
<s> I can share one view with you that may interest this groups and that is how I prefer to create meta models.  </s>
<s> Its the same principle Ive used for  </s>
<s> BPSS and CoreComponents.  </s>
<s> I have a strong preference to create meta models based on MOF which is  </s>
<s> the same meta meta model used to define UML.  </s>
<s> By using MOF I can create  </s>
<s> java API's, XML Schema, reading writing source code automatically using standardized specifications.  </s>
<s> Kind of nifty since all I have to do is create one single file and the rest us generated automatically.  </s>
<s> The  </s>
<s> manipilation java binary code is actually generated on te fly when  </s>
<s> loading the metamodel.  </s>
<s> The best is that all is open source !  </s>
<s> Im working with ArgoUML team to evolve the ArgoUML open source platform into UML 2.0, MDA and MOF domain.  </s>
<s> Hope there was something of value in there.  </s>
<s> BTW has this group had a look at UML 2 as a foundation for the specification ?  </s>
<s> /anders  </s>
<s> mm1: Your answer below is what I was looking for: (1) Rationale for consideration of MOF, (2) Your work and the ongoing work of UML 2.0  </s>
<s> mm1: If you raise concerns, explanations such as these will be helpful for the group to evaluate what formalisms they deem appropriate for their area of interest.  </s>
<s> Thanks.  </s>
<s> Another big advantage of using MOF is that you can readily store the corresponding definitions (e.g. choreography definitions) in a MOF compliant repository which are standard components.  </s>
<s> There is also very little constraints (as I understand it) to take a metamodel and make it MOF compliant.  </s>

<s> Its simpler than one thinks, Personally I used Poseidon UML tool (free) to create a UML 15 model for BPSS and CoreComponents.  </s>
<s> Then I ran a tool UML2MOF to generate/translate the MOF metamodel.  </s>
<s> A well though out metamodel is usually easy to translate, once one handles relations/associations properly.  </s>
<s> In the ArgoUML team were working towards MOF and UML2 compliance.  </s>
