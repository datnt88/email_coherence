<s> This is something I've been meaning to ask for a while, but have only just got around to... Can anyone indicate a gentle introduction to AI planning techniques, sufficient to understanding roughly what is involved in applying them to Semantic Web services?  </s>

<s> Most AI textbooks have discussions.  </s>
<s> The one in Russell and Norvig seems ok enough.  </s>
<s> They also discuss the sitcalc.  </s>
<s> Plug for UMDer: Dana Nau has a planning textbook forthcoming (in march).  </s>
<s> See: http://www.cs.umd.edu/~nau/  </s>
<s> Some of his lectures might be useful: Cheers, Bijan Parsia.  </s>
<s> In addition to the papers/books Bijan has recommended, I recommend the following overview paper on AI planning.  </s>
<s> It doesn't relate them to web service composition, but it is a reasonable overview of the field.  </s>
<s> Recent Advances in AI Planning Dan Weld AI Magazine, 1999 Sheila McIlraith  </s>
<s> Thanks, to both of you, this was most helpful.  </s>
<s> Sensitized to what I'm looking for, there seems to be some useful background material in Luger and Subblefield, and I found the planning chapter of Russell and Norvig is on the web: linked from: The Weld paper also appears to be very useful.  </s>
<s> I think there's plenty to chew on here!  </s>
