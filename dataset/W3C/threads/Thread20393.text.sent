Amaya 6.1 Bugs The bugs have been found in Amaya 6.1 on April 29, 2002 on Windows XP. Display is 1024x768, 85dpi. 
* The shortcuts for most items in the style menu do not work since ALT + T + ALT + W for example just activates the menu bar, then the types menu, followed by deactivating the menu bar and then typing a "w". 
* Despite showing as application/xhtml+xml when saving, Amaya sets the content-type to text/html. 
* The DOCTYPE is still visible and editable in Structure View for XHTML 1.1 documents. 
* When I change the DOCTYPE of an XHTML 1.0 Strict document to XHTML 1.1, I get a confirmation message that is in a dialog box that is too small. 
The message is "Creating or Changing the doctype causes teh document to be reparsed. 
Pending modificatio" (message is cut off after the "o" in "modification") Hello Brant, In your bug report, you say: Do you have this problem when changing the MIME type during a Save As operation? 
Thanks, -jose Hello Brant, There is no reason for the DOCTYPE to not be visible in structure view. 
But it must not be editable through that view and I can't edit it in my version of Amaya. 
It's very odd. 
I have fixed that bug in the CVS version. 
Thanks.
