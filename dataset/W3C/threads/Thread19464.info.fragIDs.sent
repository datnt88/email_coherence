<s> Hi. Using amaya 1.3a on a Debian 1.3.1 box and having a problem saving the page to the server.  </s>
<s> The message I get is:  </s>
<s> "Failed to save to URL http://www.etc.etc.  </s>
<s> Access to http://www.etc.etc is forbidden by rule Save to disk."  </s>
<s> I don't understand what this 'rule Save to disk' is.  </s>
<s> Are there any suggestions?  </s>
<s> thanks, tony mollica tmollica@thegrid.net  </s>
<s> Hello Tony, by rule == one of your httpd server's access control rules.  </s>
<s> Should be cleared if we change it to say "by your server".  </s>
<s> I don't know if you're authorized to write to the server, though.  </s>
<s> If it's so, there's a bug in the current release when editing a remote file.  </s>
<s> Amaya reports that the save failed, even though it succeded.  </s>
<s> To go around it, add to your thot.rc (or .thotrc  </s>
<s> file) the following line: NO_REREAD_CHECK=yes We already fixed this bug and it'll be out in a forthcoming minor release.  </s>
<s> Note that the syntax of the above rule will change to: DISABLE_PUT_CHECK (or some other nicer sounding name).  </s>
<s> Hope this helps, Thanks for your feedback.  </s>

<s> Thanks for the quick reply.  </s>
<s> I do have write permission to the server, that is I can ftp in to my directory and 'put' the files in and I can publish with the Netscape web page editor with no problems.  </s>
<s> I've tried every combination of http and ftp paths I can think of, but the file doesn't show up in my home page directory.  </s>
<s> I'll add the switch to .thotrc to see if that helps.  </s>
<s> Also, I noticed that I get Thot tool kit errors 54 and 55 in the xterm that Amaya was run from.  </s>
<s> Any clue where I can find more info on this?  </s>

<s> Amaya can publish only thru HTTP.  </s>
<s> FTP publication is not supported and results in an error message in the status bar.  </s>
<s> Did you try to do an HTTP PUT (publish) using Netscape?  </s>
<s> If this doesn't work, your HTTP server may be misconfigured.  </s>
<s> There's a Help item (top right button) describing how the Publishing process works.  </s>
<s> It also gives some hints on how to configure the httpd server.  </s>
<s> I've tested Amaya 1.3a against both Apache and Jigsaw and have had no problems to publish from different platforms.  </s>
<s> This was a bug that's now fixed.  </s>
<s> Instead of getting a "Authentication failed.  </s>
<s> Retry?" dialogue, you are getting those errors.  </s>
<s> Probably Amaya prompted you for a password and you gave a wrong one.  </s>
<s> Also, there were some authentication bugs in libwww which complicated the reuse of authentication information.  </s>
<s> Thus, sometimes you could see many requests for passwords while accessing a protected site.  </s>
<s> I talk in the past as all of these bugs have been fixed since then.  </s>
<s> Tell me if your server was misconfigured.  </s>
<s> Looking at the server logs may give some other clues.  </s>
<s> We'll soon have a minor release ready with the bug fixes.  </s>
<s> Note that I was able to publish even when those bugs existed.  </s>
<s> Thanks for keeping us update.  </s>

<s> I always use ftp publishing.  </s>
<s> Is Amaya going to ftp sometime soon?  </s>
<s> Jim FitzSimons  </s>
<s> If you change the rule, please only use positive rules: Make it something like REREADCHECK or PUT_CHECK and not disable_.... or no_....!!!  </s>
<s> This avoids problems for peoples who don't read english verry well.  </s>
<s> Specially the no_... version is often misunderstood as the NumberOf_...... I would have the NO_REREAD_CHECK given a number value: 0 for none and 2 for twice!.  </s>
<s> So for this (new) rule: PUT_CHECK=true  </s>
<s> Corne Try not to let implementation details sneak into design documents.  </s>

<s> Hello Jim, In our previous episode, Jim FitzSimons said:  </s>
<s> Well, as Amaya is a testbed for W3C specifications, it's natural we give a priority to HTTP publishing :) Anyway, there's a new implementation of ftp inside libwww.  </s>
<s> If I have the time and it doesn't cost much, I'll see if we can integrate it.  </s>
<s> Cheers, -Jose  </s>
<s> Corne, Thanks for your remarks.  </s>
<s> I changed the names of the obtuse configuration rules to something more friendly.  </s>
<s> When the minor release is out, take a look at the Configurating file from the on-line menu to see the new names.  </s>
<s> I'll also send a dedicated mail to the list after the release.  </s>
