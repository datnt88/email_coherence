<s> I'm not a Windows user, and I had a suspicion there is a Mac tool that can do this.  </s>
<s> I did a quick search for "HTML to HLP", and found the following link which might be of interest to you : Regards, Terry  </s>
<s> There certainly are commercial products such as RoboHELP (from EHelp.com) and ForeHELP that will take in web pages and hierarchies and turn them into compiled HTML Help (.chm).  </s>
<s> They are not for the light of wallet, but they do work.  </s>
<s> Microsoft offers their "free" HTML Help Workshop ( http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/tools/htmlhelp/chm/hh1start.htm ), but it requires a lot of extra work to use that productively.  </s>

<s> Any standard Help authoring tool will do that.  </s>
<s> There are even freeware utilities that do to a certain extent, both to .hlp and .chm.  </s>

<s> Dear all, Terry wrote talking about cross-platform end-of-line problems.  </s>
<s> I use BBEdit on the Macintosh which deals transparently with either standard.  </s>
<s> The very basic text editor that comes with the Mac - "Simpletext", equivalent I guess to Win95's "Notepad" - displays small boxes at the start of line if a DOS format file is loaded, and makes a mess of Unix files, as it doesn't recognise their eol $0A's.  </s>
<s> However, Simpletext is so limited that I would be surprised if anyone used it for editing HTML files, especially given that there is a cut-down version of BBEdit available free!  </s>
<s> Another contributor to the list recently pointed out that the HTML spec actually specifies the DOS standard CR/LF format for best compatibility.  </s>
<s> Even though there is a small file-size overhead in this old "teletype" standard, it is none-the-less the standard, and said overhead is really quite small.  </s>
<s> For my two cents' worth, I would recommend detecting any of the end-of-line formats incoming, storing them internally by whatever means, and writing out the CR/LF on output.  </s>
<s> We seem to be going down the road of having a multitude of configurable options on Tidy, so if the rest of the group wanted to be able to output either the Mac or Unix standard instead, then I wouldn't be too unhappy to have an option to allow them to do that.  </s>
<s> However, Tidy was created to make legal files, so shouldn't it really stick to the spec?  </s>

<s> Well no, it doesn't.  </s>
<s> Here's what it says: On the Internet, some platforms use carriage return line feed pairs for line breaks, some use just line feeds, and others just carriage returns.  </s>
<s> As a result, HTML user agents should consider both isolated line feed and carriage return chracters as line breaks, with carriage return line feed pairs treated as single line breaks.  </s>
<s> That is, new line = CR LF | CR {not followed by LF} | LF. Concerning line break after img src="... , the specification goes on to say in the very next paragraph A line break occurring immediately following a start tag should be discarded, as should a line break occurring immediately before an end tag.  </s>

<s> is ***wrong***, "without exception" a line break "should be discarded" "immediately following a start tag" such as img... .  </s>
<s> Tidy is within its rights putting a line break there.  </s>
<s> Since there are broken browsers out there, it may be unwise for Tidy to insist on its rights, but let's be clear about where the fault lies.  </s>
