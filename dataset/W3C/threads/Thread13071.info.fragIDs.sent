<s> Hmm. Charmane located the problem and Chuck found out why it happened.  </s>
<s> So I think I don't really deserve a massive amount of credit here... It would seem that Charmane is using one of the broken browsers that don't work if they can't find a stylesheet (there are a few versions of netscape with this problem - are there others?).  </s>
<s> So I would recommend a slightly more robust browser if possible.  </s>
<s> There are many newer versions of Netscape taht don't have that bug (it was fixed in 4.something and they are now producing 7.0 as a public beta...)  </s>

<s> My apologies...  </s>
<s> I meant: Thanks for debugging that, Charmane and Charles.  </s>
<s> The difference between what Charles said and what Charmane said was one of degree.:  </s>
<s> Where Charmane said spaces in the URL were "not a good idea", Charles said "illegal".  </s>
<s> I guess the thought of going to Web-prison motivated me to actually fix it.  </s>
