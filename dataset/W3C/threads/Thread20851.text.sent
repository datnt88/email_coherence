Amaya is giving a parse error for the valid language attribute of a script element in HTML 4.01 transitional. 
Sample page is bugzilla.mozilla.org. 
Brant Langer Gurganus I think Amaya is right. 
Attribute language is not allowed on element script in HTML 4.01, according to the DTD: The HTML 4.01 specification clearly states that this attribute has been deprecated in favor of type: Vincent. 
The document in question claims to be HTML 4.01 Transitional, not Strict. 
The Transitional DTD allows the deprecated language attribute.
