<s> Hi. I've been lurking for a while and what I've read here has been really helpful.  </s>
<s> I'm having a problem though, and could use some help.  </s>
<s> I'm a contractor redesigning the STAWRS web site In general, I'm supposed to simplify navigation, add to the content a bit, and make the site accessible.  </s>
<s> I'm using BOBBY software on my hard drive to test each page, and then following that up with the on-line W3C HTML validator.  </s>
<s> Everything works great except one page.  </s>
<s> On one of my pages, I've followed the BOBBY recommendations of using table headers, but I'm getting the following failures on the validator for the table cells: td headers="t1" reference to non-existent ID "t1"  </s>
<s> What am I doing wrong?  </s>
<s> URL of error .htm#6  </s>
<s> URL of the redesigned site URL of where this will live.  </s>
<s> PS. I've a bit more work on the D links based upon input from a reader here, and only the upper directory is near completion, but I would also welcome comments on the redesign from anyone who has the time.  </s>
<s> Thanks Kent  </s>
<s> Do you have something on your page with ID of "tl"?  </s>
<s> Oh _I_ see your problem.  </s>
<s> You have ID="tl" and HEADERS="t1".  </s>
<s> That's t-ELL, and t-ONE.  </s>

<s> The image mape needs to be made with alt tags for each link and you should provide alterante text tags at the bottom.  </s>
<s> Same goes for the graphics for DOL, IRS, SSA and SBA.  </s>
<s> Before you put the Bobby logo, you should have approval from the government, because they are now endorsing a product.  </s>
<s> I would set up a separate link for accessibility.  </s>
