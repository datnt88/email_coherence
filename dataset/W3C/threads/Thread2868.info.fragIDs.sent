<s> I'm implementing Transfer-Encoding: chunked, and I'm trying to figure out what to do if I get a chunk-ext I don't understand (which is to say, any chunk-ext, since RFC-2068 doesn't define any).  </s>
<s> Currently I ignore it and log a warning, on the theory that any future extension should be backwards compatible--but 2068 is silent on whether I can expect compatibility, and I'm not sure what kind of compatible extensions might make sense anyway.  </s>
<s> Any advice?  </s>

<s> Yes, in general you can expect compatibility.  </s>
<s> You must ignore the extension and continue.  </s>
<s> At this date, you should be implementing to the draft standard; pick up the last internet draft (the RFC editor has not yet issued the RFC, though the IESG has approved it).  </s>

<s> Thanks; I wasn't aware that there was anything more recent.  </s>
