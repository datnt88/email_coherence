Forwarding to the list... Hi, these utilities work with Amaya or Snufkin only. 
If they work with Amaya, can I use they in Windows 2000? 
Can I downloading the list of annotation (of a html page) wothout loading the page?

Subject: Some ruby code for dealing with annotea servers Date: Sun, 29 Sep 2002 10:37:45 -0400 (EDT) Hi folks, I am building some utilities for talking to annotea servers. 
I have a couple of little tools that are useful enough for creating an annotation and finding what annotations are available, and hope by the end of today to have something that allows me to select one of the available annotations and download it. 
There's lots to do, but the source code for what I have is at Comments, criticism, bugfixes welcome... cheers Chaals 134 136 SWAD-E http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe ------------ WAI 78 22 W3C, 2004 Route des Lucioles, 06902 Sophia Antipolis Cedex, France MSN Search: la risposta alle tue ricerche online http://search.msn.it/ "The programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed from pure thought-stuff. 
He builds his castles in the air, from air, creating by exertion of the imagination. 
Few media of creation are so flexible, so easy to polish and rework, so readily capable of realizing grand conceptual structures." 
-- Frederick Brooks, Jr., The Mythical Man Month The tool annoget.rb 
allows you to get RDF information about annotations available without having to download the page itself. 
(But I don't have a tool that turns them into a list of links yet - that's on the workplan...) You can use these scripts in Windows if you install Ruby. 
It is a programming language that is freely available, but I have never installed it on Windows so don't know how easy or hard itis and whether the documentation is good. 
(You can also use these tools with the Zope-based anotea server package) cheers Charles From: Charles McCathieNevile charles@w3.org

If you want to work in windows, xmlhttp is probably easier, you can run that in IE, and do whatever you want: RDF" to do the actual parsing, look into snufkin.
