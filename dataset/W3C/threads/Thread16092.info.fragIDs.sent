<s> Yes, technically, the sound that is attached to the flag icon could be the sonification of the image.  </s>
<s> But this would be a triumph of technology over communication.  </s>
<s> In popular culture this image already has an associated sound.  </s>
<s> The sound for the image of a waving stars and stripes is that of Arthur Fiedler conducting the Boston Pops in Sousa's "Stars and Stripes Forever" on the Esplanade on the Fourth of July.  </s>

<s> al, You are quite correct, but there is a new lexicon emerging and that is a lexicon of direct image to sound conversion.  </s>
