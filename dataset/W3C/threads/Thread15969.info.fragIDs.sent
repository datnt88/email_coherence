<s> Hello Judy, Tomorrow, February 17, PASIG (Portuguese Accessibility Special Interest Group) will submit to the Portuguese Parliament the Petition for the Accessibility of the Portuguese Internet.  </s>
<s> The web accessibility discussion will be now at the Portuguese Parliament.  </s>
<s> During 60 days (from 1998/12/03 to 1999/01/31) we collected 8,721 individual  </s>
<s> signatures (we needed 4,000 to submit the Petition) and the support of 149 organizations.  </s>
<s> During this period more than 800 web sites have been linked to our homepage.  </s>
