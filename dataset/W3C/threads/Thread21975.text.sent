I have just read the document 'http://www.w3.org/TR/cpc-req/' @ w3.org hopping to discover if there are any formal standards protocols for device manufactures and web server developers to adhere to regarding the names/attributes for devise capabilities. 
If a phone requested a screen size of 800 x 600 what would you place in the http request? 
How is this done on the phone? 
And how would a server no how to interpret this in order to facilitate the devices request? 
"Screen-size" and "size-of-screen" are completely different to a computer! 
(we need a standard or protocol I guess! 
Thank you for your time Struggling Student Developer Guy. 
Regarding a client/server protocol for device capabilities, see: User Agent Profile v2.0 Candidate I have just read the document 'http://www.w3.org/TR/cpc-req/' @ w3.org hopping to discover if there are any formal standards protocols for device manufactures and web server developers to adhere to regarding the names/attributes for devise capabilities.

The W3C Device Independence Working Group has just started work on a proposed standard for Core Presentation Characteristics that will satisfy the requirements for unambiguous attributes we identified in the document you cited. 
For existing examples of device vocabularies, have a look at the OMA's UAProf (User Agent Profile), the IETF's Media Feature Sets, W3C's CSS Media Queries or W3C's SMIL System Test Attributes. 
The first two of these also have associated protocols for conveying device profiles as part of an HTTP request, but neither are widely supported on servers to date. 
All are referenced in our CPC Requirements document http://www.w3.org/TR/cpc-req/ or in our earlier Delivery Context Overview document You have correctly spotted an area that is ripe for further development.
