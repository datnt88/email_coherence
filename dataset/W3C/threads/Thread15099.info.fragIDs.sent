<s> For many Deaf communities, they often consider that sign language is a different language.  </s>
<s> Structurally, it is a different language, which people learn because of a disability.  </s>
<s> For people who grow up learning sign language, learning to read and write is in fact very difficult.  </s>
<s> Apparently this applies most especially to Deaf children in hearing families, whose deafness is often not diagnosed for a couple of years, and whose very early exposure to language is to spoken language.  </s>
<s> The reason is that learning a written language means understanding a complex system of abstract notation, which is based on the sound of a language.  </s>
<s> Since the sound generally has no meaning for this group of people, the degree of difficulty approaches the idea of learning to read arabic (as a monolingual english-speaking child) without learning to read the alphabet - just by learning whole words.  </s>
<s> The fact that in addition the words don't have direct translations - the syntax and structure is quite different is something that I try to capture by using arabic as an example - where direct translation of words is more or less unintelligible in many cases.  </s>
<s> Just as a side note, Australian Sign Language (Auslan) is very different from the American Sign Language (ASL) - about as different as English and Russian.  </s>
<s> (Yep, even the alphabets are not at all comprehensible between the two...) So one might say that many Deaf people have a learning disability with respect to written language, but often have quite a complex language that they do use - like many disabilities, generalisations are often inaccurate.  </s>
<s> And finally, of course, this only applies to people in certain situations - people who lose some or all of their hearing after learning to speak, or after learning to read and write 7 or 8 languages, are in a totally different situation.  </s>
<s> Many older people who lose their hearing progressively cannot sign well, but learn some lip reading skills, guess a lot from context, and can often read and write.  </s>
<s> Some people cannot hear or see, and use completely different methods to learn and use language.  </s>

<s> Well, like all people with language difficulties they look for stuff that helps.  </s>
<s> Multimedia (in this case graphic information), simple language, interactivity, ... like people with learning difficulties it is not true to say that they cannot make any use of written language, just that it can provide a limited amount of commmunication which needs to be augmented in large part.  </s>

<s> Hi again, The sign language subject has been most interesting.  </s>
<s> I'd like to echo Charles comments really, particularly about different sign languages.  </s>
<s> I have a very close friend who trained as a speech therapist in the US but now practices in Australia.  </s>
<s> She has specialised in stroke victims after having worked in the US with intellectually disabled people primarily because the sign language used here is so different to the sign language she learnt in the US.  </s>
<s> I know of at least 5 sign languages in Australia, most of which omit some common linguistic features.  </s>
<s> (I am unsure of the extent of their usage however.)  </s>
<s> For example, my son first learnt Makaton.  </s>
<s> Makaton has a sign for "meat" - it doesn't differentiate the kind of meat.  </s>
<s> My son now uses Auslan which does differentiate kinds of meat (beef, chicken and so on).  </s>
<s> However, Auslan differentiates tense by using other words like "yesterday" - not by modifying a verb.  </s>
<s> I have no experience with signed English but believe from talking to some users of it that it can differentiate tense by adding signed endings to signed words.  </s>
<s> My belief is (please correct me Charles if I'm in error) that the sign language used depends on the disability.  </s>
<s> Most of my deaf friends use either Auslan or signed English.  </s>
<s> My son originally learnt Makaton because of his intellectual disability not because of his hearing loss which wasn't picked up until a year later.  </s>
<s> He uses Auslan now for a similar reason - concepts like tense are foreign to him but temporal events obviously aren't.  </s>
<s> Consequently, your understanding of language can be influenced by the kind of sign language you use.  </s>
<s> I know that grammar for example needs to be learnt early - it is not a concept that you can pick up later in life so people who gain hearing as an adult often have trouble with the nuances of grammar (consider the rules regarding the ordering of adjectives).  </s>
<s> I'm sure if needed Charles could elaborate with much more authority than I can.  </s>
<s> And I iterate all of Charles' comments about learning to read and write.  </s>
<s> Well said!  </s>
<s> Thanks for the opportunity to contribute again.  </s>

<s> I was pleased to see Charles emphasize the problems with reading and writing.  </s>
<s> Just put this in the context of school, many multimedia and video developers assume that captions will solve the problem of access for students who cannot hear an audio track.  </s>
<s> Since it is not unusual for a 7th grade learner who is deaf or hard of hearing to be reading at the 3rd grade level, keeping up with captions that have no pause controls can be a serious challenge.  </s>
<s> This is why digital video and SMIL is so important for this group and we still encourage developers to create captions.  </s>

<s> As always being a little bl**** minded and difficult: In my experience users prefer communication that use mainly symbols (place markers) that they already know.  </s>
<s> Hence one might have a sentence of perhaps 10 words with only one image (baby) and the reader can tell from the context what baby is referred to.  </s>
<s> as opposed to offering very many symbols which may confuse.  </s>
<s> Generally, early signers will also show this preference.  </s>
<s> This for the present makes it slightly more difficult to ensure that a translation suits all audiences.  </s>
