<s> Hello, There seems to be an issue with textarea tags.  </s>
<s> Given the example: tidy would change it to: sdfsdf This causes the text to have a space at the begining when the browser renders it.  </s>
<s> Can you please advise how to get notified when a bug  </s>
<s> is corrected?  </s>
<s> Thank you!  </s>

<s> Not when I try it (it gets left alone).  </s>
<s> Which version of Tidy, what options?  </s>
<s> If you are logged into Source Forge when you log a bug, it will email you when a bug is updated.  </s>
<s> But, what Fred said, what is your indent setting?  </s>
<s> Also, what browsers?  </s>
<s> Not that it wouldn't still be a bug.  </s>
<s> Tidy is supposed to be aware of significant whitespace.  </s>
<s> --indent yes is deprecated as it is known to cause rendering changes like this one.  </s>
<s> Try --indent auto instead.  </s>
<s> hth, Charlie  </s>
<s> This is a known issue, see  </s>
