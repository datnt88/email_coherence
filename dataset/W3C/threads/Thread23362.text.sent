Clement, Wouldn't a more comprehensive solution would be to parse for an END command? 
-Steve Dear, this is a solution that should be implemented by www4mail site Administrators I have implemented it on the www4mail@wm.ictp.trieste.it 
server Add the following line to the conf/www4mail.cfg 
file AliasUserCommandJUNO Get completely free e-mail from Juno at This will alias the entire line to a word JUNO. 
This will disable the processing of the URL placed in the signature from JUNO.COM Thanks Clement Onime Hi, How can I stop www4mail from parsing the juno.com 
URL that this service automatically tacks on? 
I am only getting 50% of my quota with it always sending the URL? 
BTW, I am very thankful for your service.... TIA baifutsow@juno.com

or call Juno at (800) 654-JUNO [654-5866] Yes, That means another patch :-) We let's wait until we have a bit more problems to cure. 
That way a patch is more relevant. 
Welcome back, how was Kenya?

The most important end token to search for is the standard rfc signature delimiter, which is two dashes: on a line all by itself. 
See my signature on the bottom, for example. 
I also look for the word "end", as well as a bunch of other silly things like "" and other strange things I saw over the course of several months running a server. 
You might want to copy the same set of strings from getweb.
