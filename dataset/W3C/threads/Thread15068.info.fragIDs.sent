<s> Here's our proposal: Current wording for Checkpoint 4.2, success criterion #1 1. a list of technologies and features, support for which is required in order for the content to be operable, has been determined and the content is still usable when features not on the required list (for example, scripting and stylesheets) are turned off or not supported.  </s>

<s> 1. The Web resource includes a list of the technologies users must have in order for its content to work as intended.  </s>
<s> Users who do not have some of these technologies can still access and use the resource, though the experience may be degraded.  </s>
<s> Discussion This proposal addresses the original intention of the checkpoint, as Cynthia (who wrote it in the first place) explained it last week.  </s>
<s> Gregg offered a quite different interpretation of the original wording, which is not addressed here.  </s>

<s> With thanks to John and Cynthia for completing this action item so expeditiously, my comments appear below.  </s>
<s> I agree with Gregg: this is better than the original wording, putting aside the question of whether checkpoint 4.2 should be included in the guidelines at all, which I acknowledge remains an open issue.  </s>
<s> I assume you intend "some" in the above proposal to mean "at least one".  </s>
<s> Is this potentially ambiguous?  </s>
<s> Should it be clarified, for example by saying "at least one of these technologies" or "one or more of these technologies"?  </s>
<s> Whoever interprets "some" as meaning "more than one" will argue that content for which there is only one such technology, i.e., a technology the non-availability of which does not cause the content to become inoperable, doesn't meet the success criterion.  </s>
<s> Thanks, Jason (and Gregg)!  </s>
<s> I'll accept either "at least one of these technologies" or "one or more of these technologies" as a friendly amendment.  </s>
<s> "One or more" is probably better.  </s>
<s> But then another question arises: is there some upper limit?  </s>
<s> If a given user has *none* of the technologies on the list, do we still require that he or she be able to access and use the resource?  </s>
<s> That, I think, would make a mockery of this criterion (which may be an argument in favor of eliminating it altogether).  </s>
