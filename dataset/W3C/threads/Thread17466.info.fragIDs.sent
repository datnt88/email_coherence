<s> Hi Paul, I am curious about the site stats you look at - although I don't necessarily mean to dispute your facts.  </s>
<s> I have noticed that many browsers identify themselves as IE (Opera does this by default, and many others make it easy to do so).  </s>
<s> Simple playing around suggests that this is to get around browser-sniffers that exclude other browsers for no terribly good reason.  </s>
<s> Likewise, there are many techniques for stats gathering that do not work neatly.  </s>
<s> Proxying means that straight log checking is fraught, and the use of such proxy-aware techniques as images drawn from a CGI gateway and not cached by proxies assumes that users who do not get images are statistically insignificant.  </s>
<s> There was a W3C activity trying to characterise the web and its usage, and people like Len Kasday were involved because of the importance of any such data to accessibility questions (and the importance of questions like the above in the way data are gathered).  </s>
<s> They gave up, in part I believe because it turned out to be an apparently intractable problem.  </s>

<s> Just wanted to make the point that although Opera does this by default, even in its state it identifies itself as Opera if the detection routine is thourough enough.  </s>
<s> This rules out most JS and simple software, but some more advanced tools finds out about this double identity easily and reflect their results thus.  </s>
<s> For example, my Opera 7.23 identified as Explorer; UAG = Mozilla/4.0  </s>
<s> (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.0) Opera 7.23 [en] There is enough info there to find out what is really browsing your page, but most scripts/functions that tries to work this out does it left to right looking for the first instance of certain patters, missing the important right-most info.  </s>
<s> Anyways, just some added inflation.  </s>
