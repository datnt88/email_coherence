Hello, At the 2 May teleconference we discussed a new requirement for synchronized views. 
In trying to add a checkpoint to the document, I have come across the following questions: 1) What does it mean to synchronize a view? 
Is it any more than saying that the current focus in one viewport should follow the current focus in the other (as well as possible)? 
Are there other aspects to synchronization? 
I suspect not, for if the views must be exact duplicates always, I don't see the point of having them. 
Summary: Synchronized views means synchronized content focuses. 
2) Which views should be synchronized? 
I believe that the user agent should strong not /strong synchronize all views that happen to refer to the same content. 
(In fact, it's even difficult to say what we mean by "the same content". 
What if two different URIs designate copies of the same document? 
The user agent should not be required to know that they are copies and that two views are rendering the same content from different resources). 
Even when I open two views for the same URI, I do not want the focuses to follow each other automatically. 
In fact, usually I don't want them to follow each other since I opened two different views to navigate the same content in two different ways. 
Furthermore, synchronized focus changes may be disorienting if the user is unaware that associated focuses are meant to change together. 
Summary: Two views should automatically be synchronized simply because they display the same resource. 
3) When does synchronization stop? 
Suppose I navigate to a form control and submit a form and the focus is following my actions in another view that also contains the form. 
Should the form be submitted in the second view? 
I don't think in the general case it should. 
What about following a link in one view - should the link be followed in the other view? 
What if the link isn't even visible (i.e., it's hidden since the renderings are different)? 
When should the focuses cease to follow each other? 
4) When do we want to require synchronization? 
We have heard some good examples of using synchronized views, such as synchronizing a link view with a primary view. 
In this case, the user should be able to navigate the links and would like the focus to follow in the primary view. 
That seems useful to me, but that happens to be a useful feature provided by the user agent. 
How many synchronized views are we requiring? 
One? 
More than one? 
Which ones? 
As pointed out in point 2, I don't believe the answer should be "synchronize all views". 
If we only require one synchronized view, what should it contain? 
The links view mentioned above may be implemented through style sheets, and synchronized views in which users can adjust rendering is indeed a powerful tool. 
However, user agents aren't required to implement a links view with style sheets. 
Are we going to require any other views than the outline view? 
Summary: Other than the outline view, we don't require the user agent to offer any other views. 
Therefore, I don't see how we can require synchronization between views (other than the primary and outline views) when we don't know what the semantics of those views will be. 
We have decided to require an outline view but have not required that view to be navigable (though we have suggested a navigable outline view would be a good thing). 
Do we wish to now require that the outline view be navigable and that the focuses should be synchronized? 
In short, I think that we need to reconsider the resolution to add a checkpoint requiring the user agent to synchronize views. 
While synchronized views are certain powerful techniques for navigation, I don't believe we have considered the problem fully enough to add a checkpoint this late in the process. 
I propose instead that we explain view synchronization in the techniques document and provide the links view example.

I've no problem with your approach here. 
I get a sense though that what we are attempting to capture is the ability to provide simple mechanisms for orientation. 
The jfw links list for instance is dismissed when you act on your intention leaving you with the single view that you started with but pointing where you requested that you be taken. 
conversely, when you ask for the links view in the midst of a document, you can traverse that view from that point. 
I do agree though that not only are all views not synchronistic but that it is not even necessary to synchronize all views.

Responses in JRG: 
JRG: The main context of the issue of synchronization came up in was in source or dom views. 
The need was to have a way to orient the user to the source or dom view of what had generated the selected content in their primary view. 
JRG: Probably the minimum requirement would be synchronizing a source or dom view with the primary view. 
I 
JRG: I am not sure that two primary views of the same resources should be synchronized. 
I think if we want to do this the synchronized view needs to be some type of view-only view or something the user doesn't interact with directly. 
The main purpose of the synchronized view was to allow access to "machine" content in a way that was easy for the user. 
In our discussions these were view only views. 
The user did not interact with them. 
JRG: I think the outline view right now would be a good place to require the synchronization. 
JRG: I think it would be wise for the group to drop the synchronization checkpoint and consider synchronization as part of the minimum requirement for 7.6 and/or 8.5.
