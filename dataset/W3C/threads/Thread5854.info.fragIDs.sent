<s> I have a question: I want to state a fact like this: A person is learning a subject.  </s>
<s> The subject have some homeworks to be done.  </s>
<s> So the person have these homeworks to do.  </s>
<s> (I think the reasoner will give this statement.)  </s>
<s> When the subject assert some new homeworks, the reasoner will know that the person also have these new homework.  </s>
<s> How do I implement this using OWL and reasoner?  </s>
<s> Or it can not do this?  </s>
<s> I think it's very easy to implement this using Rule language, but when we use OWL and when we use other Rule language?  </s>
<s> I know some differences between the closed and open world, but is there something that OWL can not state and only Rule language can state?  </s>
<s> Thanks in advance!  </s>
<s> Best regards, Zhu Bin  </s>
<s> Seems to me that there is something wrong, or at least misleading with the  </s>
<s> example of "TexasThings"  </s>
<s> First it would certainly be better to have the singular "TexasThing" rather  </s>
<s> than plural "TexasThings" :) "TexasThings are exactly those things located in the Texas region ..." This is obviously wrong.  </s>
<s> There is an allValuesFrom, but not a someValuesFrom here.  </s>
<s> As defined, it means : If TexasThings are located somewhere, they are located in Texas region.  </s>
<s> An further on  </s>
<s> ... The difference between using owl:equivalentClass here and using  </s>
<s> rdfs:subClassOf is the difference between a necessary condition and a necessary and sufficient condition.  </s>
<s> With subClassOf, things that are located in Texas are not necessarily TexasThings.  </s>
<s> But, using  </s>
<s> owl:equivalentClass, if something is located in Texas, then it must be in  </s>
<s> the class of TexasThings." ... but not the other way round, unfortunately.  </s>
<s> In fact under this definition any thing located nowhere is a Texas Thing.  </s>
<s> Thinking about it, maybe it makes sense after all.  </s>

<s> Mike, Ian Thanks for picking up the issue.  </s>
<s> Better late that never :)) BTW my suggestion would be to give up the Texas Thingies altogether, and maybe take the same examples than in the Reference document (Mozart's operas).  </s>
<s> The point for it is a very simple and generic pedagogic principle: any introductory example should offer as small as possible space for interpretation and discussion.  </s>
<s> Which means that the reader should instantly be provided with a clear notion of what is an instance and what is not.  </s>
<s> In that regard, Texas Thing, even with a someValuesFrom restriction, is still confusing.  </s>
<s> Take the following examples.  </s>
<s> There is no indication of cardinality for "locatedIn".  </s>
<s> Is a company with several offices, some located in Texas and some not, a Texas Thing?  </s>
<s> There is now indication of time extension.  </s>
<s> The Texan boots I bought 23 years ago in San Angelo (authentic) have been located in France ever since.  </s>
<s> They've been Texas Things at a time at least, but are they still now?  </s>
<s> And so on.  </s>
<s> Trying to figure out the extension of the class, the reader is led astray to such irrelevant paths by too open definition, and misses the point of "equivalentClass".  </s>
<s> See my "BlueThing" example in rdf-logic ... OTOH, providing a non-ambiguous definition of Texas Thing would be very arbitrary and controversial, and would need more restrictions, which would make the example confusing by its complexity.  </s>
<s> It figures.  </s>
<s> Finding good examples is difficult but important.  </s>
<s> 99% of users will build their understanding from examples, not from abstract syntax.  </s>
