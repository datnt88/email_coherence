<s> Certainly in the field of accessibility, it is clear that the author  </s>
<s> may not be the best person to assert that the resource is accessible  </s>
<s> - usually on government and other sites a third party is requested to  </s>
<s> do this.  </s>
<s> And the metadata that will convey the information about the accessibility will probably not be stored as part of the actual resource.  </s>
<s> Further, with new technologies emerging that will test ,  </s>
<s> and re-test, sites for accessibility, it will be computer agents to a  </s>
<s> large extent that will create the metadata - and it may be developed as a service to people who have special access needs.  </s>
<s> What do others think?  </s>
<s> Liddy  </s>
<s> I hear the words of causion expressed by others and these cannot simply be  </s>
<s> dismissed.  </s>
<s> Indeed, how would you "categorise" a portal site which allows the  </s>
<s> user to customize their "view" from a number of sources?  </s>
<s> Each source could  </s>
<s> be "categorised" differently, some very accessible, some not so accessible?  </s>
<s> You also could simply have a static page which is perfectly usable but contains inaccessible but superfluous flash content.  </s>
<s> I think we all tend to  </s>
<s> have a go to try to sue a site and even if we can't use it properly it is  </s>
<s> still possible to get something out of it.  </s>
<s> I there is an argument on this  </s>
<s> basis for just having 2 different value for the metadata, completely inaccessible and "suck it and see".  </s>
<s> I don't feel these problems are insummountable however, and feel more positive towards this approach.  </s>
<s> What information should be contained in your profile?  </s>
<s> This should contain  </s>
<s> any access technology installed, browser configuration (eg colours/font sizes, user stylesheet in use), OS display/screen configuration, and user  </s>
<s> preferences.  </s>
<s> This could be created by any or all of the browser, access  </s>
<s> technology, manually by the user or even the OS.  </s>
<s> A simple text file (XML)  </s>
<s> could easily be maintained for this purpose.  </s>
<s> Since there is no personal information I can't see any problems with storage or abuse of civil liberties.  </s>
<s> This actually tells you nothing about the user themself, simply  </s>
<s> how the system is configured.  </s>
<s> Could be anyone using it.  </s>
<s> So it could be  </s>
<s> stored anywhere, smart card (but issues if you move to a different machine?), on the web (as per smart card but perhaps more easily maintained), but probably on the machine itself.  </s>
<s> As the use of XML/XHTML becomes more wide-spread I can see large organisations farming out work to provide accessible stylesheets which could be used by "intelligent" web servers to transform content based on this profile and metadata provided again by third parties (as was suggested ealrier) appropriately.  </s>
<s> The burden on large organisations to make accesible content (which I would argue isn't actually that much anyway under the right conditions) could actually be reduced and left to experts in this field.  </s>
<s> The use of meta tags for this purpose could be included in the guidelines  </s>
<s> and even used to possibly promete the above desing model as best practice?  </s>
<s> As government policy throughout the world adopt similar approaches to the  </s>
<s> US, rather than "gettosing" accessible sites I this "categorisation" could  </s>
<s> actually do the opposite.  </s>
<s> It could almost become a kind of kyte mark and a  </s>
<s> sign of quality.  </s>
<s> All users prefer to use clear and clean sites and would use  </s>
<s> them in preferrence to cluttered and unclear content.  </s>
<s> As technology improves web design tools could actually add the metatags themselves?  </s>
<s> OK, so I've stopped dreaming now and woken up.  </s>
<s> Life isn't quite that simple but I like the idea and feel that it does have potential.  </s>
<s> Cheers Ian Perhaps it is worth a few examples.  </s>
<s> In Australia, we have a large education program that is developing resources for distribution on line.  </s>
<s> All of these must be certified to meet certain standards of accessibility.  </s>
<s> This metadata will be used to monitor the accessibility of all resources and changes to the resources will be checked to ensure the resource does not become inaccessible through changes.  </s>
<s> The IMS Global Project has produced guidelines for accessibility and descriptions of users needs that will be encoded in metadata.  </s>
<s> Those implementing the IMS system will be matching users with resources, and expect to rely on the metadata, right down to the level of items in online testing activities.  </s>
<s> In Canada, bank users are issued with smart cards that contain their needs as users.  </s>
<s> These can be used to transform the ATM's output so  </s>
<s> that it is accessible for the user.  </s>
<s> Technology on does so much however.  </s>
<s> It is still the case that some of the evaluation has to be done by humans, and this is why it is so important that the metadata proposed for accessibility contains the identity of the person (or agent) asserting the level of accessibility or accessibility standards compliance of the resource.  </s>
<s> Note: the latter is much easier than the former but that is why we are anxious to get to work on this.  </s>

<s> So here is where I think it gets interesting...  </s>
<s> The idea of using proxy servers for accessibility repair is pretty common.  </s>
<s> Nick Kew has been running one until recently but there are others.  </s>
<s> The idea of using metadata to tell your proxy what you want is pretty common.  </s>
<s> CC/PP - a format for describing capabilities of a system, assumes that this might happen at several places along the delivery chain between the server and the end user.  </s>
<s> One place might in fact be in the end users' own space, where they keep their private information about what they prefer (perhaps two or three lots  </s>
<s> according to different things they are doing at the time), and a proxy that  </s>
<s> strips out what they can't use, or does transformations to make something more useful to them.  </s>
<s> And then you have a system where you go to your own site, and tell it that today you want to use profile "public library".  </s>
<s> A profile that adds links to your private bookmarks etc to pages as you get them.  </s>
<s> Not like profile "new laptop" which installs stuff all over your laptop to manage bookmarks and so on.  </s>
<s> (remembering that some off the most useful bookmarks I have are in fact javascript bookarklets that do useful things to make pages more accessible).  </s>
<s> Of course, some people prefer to use sytems that don't run javascript.  </s>
<s> But imagine a system that processed things in the proxy which had been marked as useful and trustworthy by someone you trust, to make the effect seem like server side.  </s>
<s> For example form validation goes from you, using lynx in the library, to your proxy, which checks it and tells you if there were fields you left blank because you didn't notice they appeared after the submit button... cheers Chaals  </s>
<s> It is "our" responsiblity to ensure that it is as easy as can possibly be to  </s>
<s> set up a profile.  </s>
<s> Agreed this is not straight forward as can be seen from the use and set up of CSS but is possible.  </s>
<s> For what it's worth, I don't believe we should always be working to the lowest common denominator.  </s>
<s> Yes we absolutely MUST take everything into consideration and do everything feasibly possible to cater for all but we have to draw the line somewhere at some point.  </s>
<s> We can't halt progress.  </s>
<s> We  </s>
<s> absolutely must keep an eye on the future to ensure that new and emerging technologies support accessiblity from the outset.  </s>
<s> The fact that we have  </s>
<s> even been asked to comment on this proposal is indeed testament to how far things have come which I welcome.  </s>
<s> It ain't going to happen over night but  </s>
<s> rather this than the far to common "it's not accessible so how do we fix it" model.  </s>
<s> If individuals don't want to use this feature for whatever reason then that's fine, but let us at least give them the option.  </s>
<s> Yes there will always be situations which mean a particular approach will not be suitable but in  </s>
<s> this case I haven't heard any yet which couldn't be over come.  </s>
<s> I personally feel the benefits outweigh any disadvantages.  </s>

<s> I agree with that, I was playing devils' advocate for a bit there  </s>
<s> it is where to draw that line that we seem to have a problem with, I just  </s>
<s> try to make sure we remember that the level of technology that "we" have in the industrialized part of the world is not necessarily the same level  </s>
<s> as the rest of the world, and if you are a disabled person in Nicaragua  </s>
<s> for example your computer is probably second hand, you pay for access to the internet by the minute and your modem may be 2400 baud.  </s>
<s> but this persons need for what the internet has to offer may be more important than what we need, especially since that may be the ONLY access to the knowledge they need.  </s>
<s> no argument there, the future technologies of today are the antiques of next year the more access built in the less adaptation that has to be done by the IT folks on the front line.  </s>
<s> of course one of the pet peeves of most people using adaptive gear is that every advance seems to push one more group of disabled users off the net.  </s>
<s> that is indeed a step in the right direction  </s>
<s> heck just getting a "how do we fix it" is more than most do.  </s>
<s> I agree, but I think there should be some basic level that should always be a fall back position, and since there are few if any pieces of  </s>
<s> equipment that can not use ASCII text I think that should be the fall back  </s>
<s> position for every improvement (IMO) and that if anything has to be dropped maybe it should be some of the intervening steps, always leaving the basic ASCII text mode as the "bottom line" even an old TR-80 can read that!  </s>
<s> And yes I know folks that are still using them.  </s>

<s> allow the server access to my computer, I have the highest firewall I could establish (which I am sure has holes in it, just haven't found em all yet) and I won't even visit a site that requires cookies'.  </s>
<s> I use the net to "find" what I want, then I call or mail em my order, I am far from unique here.  </s>
