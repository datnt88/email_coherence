EOWG: Here are more WAI home page redrafts, for discussion at our Sept 1 meeting: Three different versions of WAI home page: And the following sub-pages, some new, some revised, which you should encounter while following links from the home page: I have incorporated most, but not every, comment received; and the pages still need more editing. 
Comments welcome, to w3c-wai-eo@w3.org and in our EOWG meeting shortly.

Due to server problems I've only glanced at the 3 new drafts and I prefer no. 8: www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/WAI-home8 
Curious, why? 
Regarding news I came to think about when is news news. 
If I visit a site every day the news items from yesterday are old news if I only visit a site every 6 month news from May might be interesting. 
Has W3C a policy for how long their news items are presented as news on their home pages? 
No W3C-wide policy, no. 
Generally, WAI home page would rotate off a news item when the next one comes on.

508 comments turns out to still be of current interest, however; we are getting two or more press inquiries about it per week. 
That would change once the final rule is available from the US Access Board.

Regards Helle 
I like the simplicity in the structure and the shortness of the page. 
I can quickly get the information from the page and then go on to the parts I'm interested in. 
I don't have to read through a long information heavy page and then decide where to go for the part I want to know about.
