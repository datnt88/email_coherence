<s> The steps that we take NOW, the fights we fight and the battles we win at the EARLY stages of the game, will mean EVERYTHING to future accessibility for everyone.  </s>
<s> That is why it's so vitally important to get the word out NOW, and make our presence heard, because otherwise those "without" (without the latest tech, without a big budget for hardware, without the ability to see, without a fast connection) will be left behind, possibly forever.  </s>

<s> Cell phones are truly portable communication devices, but must they be equipped to accommodate a person who is deaf?  </s>
<s> To access the Internet from a laptop or desktop computer requires an investment that many people can't afford.  </s>
<s> A public phone is widely available as compared to a public computer center equipped with an Internet connection.  </s>
<s> When available, the cost is much greater to achieve the Internet connection compared to using a public or cell phone.  </s>
<s> I don't see that Internet accessibility is universally available or affordable, but public and private phone connections are universally available, at least in the USA.  </s>
<s> I would venture to say that most people inquiring about train or plane schedules either use the phone to contain the train and/or airline.  </s>
<s> They may also phone their travel agent to place their reservation.  </s>
<s> The Internet is still a "buzz" word to most Americans that will not be a practical reality for another decade, especially in rural communities when phone modems at 28,000 baud exists.  </s>
<s> I believe that T-1 and cable modems represent a very small number of the total connections in the USA.  </s>
<s> E-mail is an option that many companies are using rather than just depending on an Internet site.  </s>
<s> An e-mail message can request information and information like train or plain schedules can be e-mailed to respond to the inquiry.  </s>
<s> This saves the individual from having to make written notations.  </s>
<s> Obviously a person with impaired vision would have the software so the text could be converted to speech.  </s>
<s> There must be REASONABLE accommodations for individuals who lack or have impaired physical abilities.  </s>
<s> The key is striking a reasonable balance when public and private resources are limited.  </s>
<s> It is not possible to make a disabled person live exactly like someone who is not so affected.  </s>
<s> Actually it is the same people that many people face as they grow older and are unable to accept that their physical abilities no longer allow them to abuse their bodies and bounce back as when they were 20 years old.  </s>
