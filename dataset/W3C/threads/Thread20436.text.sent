I'm trying to build amaya on a Linux ppc and am experiencing difficulties. 
First I tried: mkdir -p /swl/amaya-4.3.2/Linux-2.2-ppc 
./configure 
--prefix=/swl/amaya-4.3.2 --exec-prefix=/swl/amaya-4.3.2/Linux-2.2-ppc 
make all FAILED in make[1]: Entering directory `/swl/tmp/Amaya/annotlib' System wide unix-thot.rc 
not found at /swl/tmp/config/unix-thot.rc External structure HTML System wide unix-thot.rc 
not found at /swl/tmp/config/unix-thot.rc WARNING: cannot open file en-libdialogue I assumed this meant I needed to install thot. 
The thot (2.1e) INSTALL file indicates that amaya and the thoteditor should be extracted into the thot (library) source tree. 
Did that and tried building thot (which the INSTALL says will build amaya and thoteditor). 
This failed in lots of places but that's I guess I need to talk to the thot people about that. 
At this point I'm considering giving up on getting a new Amaya working on Linux-ppc and using it on a different architecture. 
(Where it is very impressive, I might add!) -sp- As explained in http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/Autoconf.html due to configuration files (like unix-thot.rc) 
needed by Amaya compilers you have to build the application in a subdirectory of the Amaya hierarchy mkdir Linux-2.2-ppc cd Linux-2.2-ppc ../configure Yes, I did read that section. 
However, we install packages in an area that is cross mounted to lots of different architectures. 
One implication is that we put the source in one place and install the results of the build somewhere else (using the --prefix and --exec-prefix options on configure). 
But, just to make sure, I tried going to the source tree and doing what the web page says: cd /swl/tmp/Thot/Amaya mkdir Linux-2.2-ppc cd Linux-2.2-ppc ../configure I get what sounds like an error from config: "Nor Amaya nor Thot package found, get the corresponding archive" As expected, when I run make with the above config I get: make[1]: *** [libThotEditor.a] 
Error 1 The prerequisite listed on the web page don't say anything about needing to install thot first. 
And, they don't say anything about how to point to thot if it is installed.
