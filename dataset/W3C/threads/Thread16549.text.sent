What do folks think about place-names of foreign origin? 
Will marking them up following the example provided for checkpoint 4.1 make text more accessible? 
4.2 Language information Checkpoints in this section: 4.1, and 4.3. 
If you use a number of different languages on a page, make sure that any changes in language are clearly identified by using the "lang" attribute: Example. 
P And with a certain SPAN lang="fr" je ne sais quoi /SPAN , she entered both the room, and his life, forever. 
Q My name is Natasha, /Q she said. 
Q lang="it" Piacere, /Q he replied in impeccable Italian, locking the door. 
End example. 
zm Hi, Once the speech output components can make use of this information, this will be very helpful. 
Language changes in the inline level elements, like in the example below, may not seem too important. 
But for block level elements, such as P , BLOCKQUOTE , etc., this information will be essential. 
I don't know if any browser is using this information currently. 
However, I believe IBM Home Page Reader (English version) looks at the lang attribute on the HTML element, and changes the speech mode to that language. 
This demonstrates the usefullness and the possibility of implementations that use the language information. 
And I'm hoping that the same thing will be done at least for the block-level elements. 
Personally, I can't understand why 4.1 is priority 1 while 4.3 is priority 3. I can't remember if there was any discussion on this in the process of developing the WCAG. 
But I think both 4.1 and 4.3 are very important and helpful. 
Cheers, Max I think place names and Proper nouns" (such as people's names) are a complex example case. 
In English, I use the word London to describe what in french is descreibed as Londres, and in Jpanese (using romaji characters) as Rondon. 
Knowing the language in this case is very helpful. 
But I also use the term Nagasaki. 
This is of foreign origin (relative to english - the language I am using) but is nevertheless a word in the language. 
Another example is Paris. 
In french it is pronounced roughly like "paree" and in english is pronounced roughly as "pariss". 
Often, the wrong pronunciation will make the term incomprehensible Australians have terrible trouble trying to buy Adidas footwear in the US, or explain what a "lefftenant" does. 
We mostly recognise the american pronunciations now through chronic exposure to american culture in TV and radio, but not always - "nesslay" may be one of the largest companies on the supermarket shelves, but in our language it is a pronunciation that is answered by "never heard of 'em - what do they make?". 
I cannot make a computer understand my voice unless I put on an american accent, and that is something I am still trying to learn how to do. 
People with hearing impairments or cognitive disabilities can have exactly the same kinds of problems in comprehension, and without the markup to provide solutions for them we are not going to be able to solve those problems (on the other hand, with the markup, we can develop tools that will solve the problem. 
We could also ignore it, and the people whose problem it is, but that seems foolish to me.) So to answer the original question: In general, I think that place names of foreign origin are recognised as words in a local language, but there are exceptions, normally for well-known or important places. 
There are times when there are two words, originally from differnt languages but both recognised (in Australian english we use either "Uluru" or "Ayer's Rock" to describe the big famous rock in the middle of the country. 
Only one of those terms came from english) in a particular language can be used. 
But in the case of a genuinely foreign name (using "Londres" to decsribe the capital of england in english, for example) marking them up is extremely important. 
One of the simple things that can be done with properly marked-up place names is to run a script over them that simply translates them. 
This is basic dictionary look-up, and if it hasn't been implemented yet it could be done by any decent programmer on a long lunch break in a working, if rough, manner.

zm W3C Web Accessibility Initiative http://www.w3.org/WAI Location: I-cubed, 110 Victoria Street, Carlton VIC 3053 Postal: GPO Box 2476V, Melbourne 3001, Australia Ooops, I overlooked the words ``place-name'' when I wrote my privious message. 
I think the handling of the proper noun is different depending on the primary language of the document. 
Charles' comments seem to well-summarize the situation in English while I think it doesn't necessarily apply to proper nouns in Japanese document. 
But the important point is that enough informaiton is provided in the document so that user/user-agent can determine if that piece of informaiton should be used. 
The problem seems that there currently isn't no easy way to determine if the word is proper noun. 
(of course, using class attribute could be one solution.) Cheers, Max
