Hi, According to the DOM Level3 Events module, the 'createEvent' method on the 'DocumentEvent' interface does not take a namespaceURI. 
I am curious to know whether or not the DOM WG has not found any issue with that. 
I mean that users can initialize an event with a namespaceURI and an eventType, but an implementation does not need to know the namespaceURI to create the object? 
BTW: In the 'createEvent' method of the 'DocumentEvent' interface, the wording used to describe the interfaceType parameter should mention 'initUIEventNS' rather than 'initUIEvent'.

See Issue naming-1. 
The fact that it's still listed as an open issue suggests that no decision has yet been made, or at least had been made as of February when that draft was released. 
Personal reaction: I don't see anything inherently wrong with the concept of using namespaces to help identify events... but I'm also not sure that needs to be explicitly supported in the DOM right now. 
Making the namespaceURI part of the event name string does achieve most of the same goals, with possibly less storage overhead but possibly more computational overhead. 
One thing that approach doesn't do is let you listen for all events in a given namespace, but we don't have listen-for-all-events for non-namespaced events and there's been no demand for it... I suspect that what's needed here is a genuine use case or three, both to justify adding the feature and to guide what it should look like. 
Joe Kesselman / IBM Research AS far as I read the draft, the parameter represents the type of Event interface ("UIEvent") to be created, not the type event itself. 
However, more reading leads to think that the parameter is in fact the feature name of the Event interface ("UIEvents"). 
There is clearly something to fix here. 
background: XML Events introduced namespaces for event types, ie the type of an event is {"http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events", "DOMActivate"} instead of "DOMActivate". 
There is currently a proposal to include this mechanism in DOM Level 3 Events however it is not clear if it is going to remain in XML Events, this explains why the draft is currently on hold. 
The user creates an object of type UIEvent: DocumentEvent.createEvent("UIEvents") and then initialize with the appropriate parameters ("http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events", "DOMActivate", ...) initUIEvent is given as an example but I agree that the example should better recommend the use of initUIEventNS than initUIEvent. 
Philippe That does not address my point. 
My issue is that I think an implementation might need the namespace URI in order to *instanciate* the event and not only at the initialization time. 
Thierry. 
For which purpose the implementation might need to have the namespace URI at creation? 
You don't even have the event type name ("DOMActivate") anyway... Philippe
