<s> DSR -- you are infected with the Yama virus.  </s>

<s> Hi Dave, Thanks for replying -- I had no idea that dsr@w3.org was such an illustrious source as yourself, what next a trojan horse from Tim Berners-Lee ?? Unfortunately the virus emails are still coming; at about a rate of 10 a day my antivirus software rings an alarm bell (it no longer makes me jump).  </s>
<s> The latest has a subject of 'Fw: Enjoy friendship :-)' and the virus is in an attached file called 'checkfriends.scr'.  </s>
