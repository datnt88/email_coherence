Is it good to have 207 as the multi-status response? 
If an HTTP/1.1 client did a DELETE on a WebDAV server which failed, it could get a 207 response which would (should) be interpreted as success by the 1.1 client, being 2xx class.

A multistatus would only be returned if the depth header was used. 
A 1.1 only client wouldn't send a depth header. 
Sorry, where is that specified?

The closest you will get is section 8.6.2 Delete for Collections which says "If an error occurs with a resource other than the resource identified in the Request-URI then the response MUST be a 207(Multi-Status)." 
Of course this doesn't ban returning 207 on a depthless request, common sense does that. 
But common sense is a lousy substitute for standards text. 
I already added this issue to the draft status list from your first post so you can be sure it will be addressed when we move from proposed to draft.
