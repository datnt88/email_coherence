<s> Hi folks, in the RDF Schema definition of OWL (www.w3.org/2002/07/owl) you use rdf:List (this does not exist in the RDF namespace).  </s>
<s> I propose to change it to rdf:Seq.  </s>
<s> Ciao, Karsten Tolle  </s>
<s> Hi,  </s>
<s> OK, I found the following in the Text.  </s>
<s> Several components employ lists constructed using the rdf:List, rdf:first, rdf:rest, rdf:nil, and rdf:parseType="Collection" vocabulary [Ed: identify link] recently added to RDF.  </s>
<s> But could tell me someone where to find more information on the new added components!?  </s>
<s> ... and what about 'rdf:parseType="owl:collection"' compared to rdf:parseType="Collection"?  </s>
<s> Thanks, Karsten  </s>

<s> you should find them really soon in RDFCore  </s>
<s> it must be rdf:parseType="Collection" Jos De Roo, AGFA http://www.agfa.com/w3c/jdroo/  </s>
<s> As Jos de Roo implied, a recent decision of the RDF Core WG has added rdf:List, rdf:first, rdf:rest, and rdf:nil and rdf:ParseType="Collection" to RDF.  </s>
<s> This decision is so new that it had not even made it into any of the editor's draft documents for the RDF Core WG when the WebOnt documents were created.  </s>
<s> There is still only a note in the editor's draft of the new RDF syntax document at the beginning of As far as the WebOnt documents go, I just noticed that the abstract syntax document uses the owl: versions of these tokens, which is wrong, and will be changed.  </s>
<s> As far as I can tell the other documents do not have any errors in this area.  </s>
<s> Peter F. Patel-Schneider  </s>
<s> Hi Peter and Jos I am wondering whether the addition of rdf:List and rdf:ParseType="Collection" in the RDFMS makes redundant previous constructs like rdf:Seq and rdf:Alt.  </s>
<s> From formal viewpoint using lists we can represent both Seqs and Alts.  </s>
<s> I have two questions: a) What is the status of rdf:List as far rdfs is concerned?  </s>
<s> Is-it a class (instances have a URI) or a structured value (instances without a URI) ?  </s>
<s> b) Why not go one step further in the RDFMS refinement and define also types for list elements: e.g., list of integers, strings, URIs?  </s>
<s> Note that this is of paramount importance for interpreting the results of an rdf query returned as collections.  </s>
