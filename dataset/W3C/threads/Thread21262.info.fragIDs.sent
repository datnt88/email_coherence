<s> (Just a quick note to capture an idea that cropped up over lunch with Marja)  </s>
<s> Our XML/RDF annotation vocabularies should capture the language primarily used in any textual content within the annotation.  </s>
<s> For eg., as a dc:language property of the annotation.  </s>
<s> This would allow consumer  </s>
<s> applications to filter out a particular natural languages view of some annotation resource.  </s>
<s> For example use case, Spanish or chinese or .... annotations of http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/ could be pulled out via an RDF query.  </s>
<s> For users browsing through content in a language that isn't their first, this could be a really useful service: one might view a page overlaid with all the annotations of it that have been made in some selected natural language.  </s>
<s> (I'd expect this to be one of a vast number of ways we'll select annotations of interest using RDF queries).  </s>
<s> Related idea: annotation servers implemented over HTTP might be able to pick up language of the annotator from HTTP headers, rather than needing special case support.  </s>
<s> Dan (semantic web geek)  </s>
<s> Would current clients break if we started posting annotations with dc:language properties straightaway?  </s>
<s> Or should we wait until such a usage  </s>
<s> is officially sanctioned?  </s>
<s> Matthew Wilson  </s>
<s> The clients should not break if they were written properly.  </s>
<s> If adding such a property to the RDF that encodes an annotation breaks a client then the client doesn't understand a key feature of RDF - its extensibility.  </s>
<s> Adding a new property to an annotation should not cause problems for Amaya or the Annotea bookmarklets.  </s>
<s> Of course, these Annotea clients may not do anything with the new property but they certainly should not break.  </s>
<s> Art  </s>
<s> That's what I thought.  </s>
<s> I may experiment with this in Annozilla... Matthew  </s>
<s> Sensible RDF applications should always "expect the unexpected", ie. not be suprised to find a variety of additional pieces of data ("annotations", in a broad sense of the term) decorating RDF graphs.  </s>
<s> From what I know of the 3 Annotea clients, they should all be OK with additional properties attached to an annotation, since they use an RDF parser rather than match against hard-coded XML encodings of the data structure.  </s>
