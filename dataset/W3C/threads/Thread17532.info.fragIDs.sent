<s> Hi, Here's some documentation on the prototype browser I worked on last year.  </s>
<s> The ideas might be useful for blind accessibility for browsers.  </s>
<s> Scott Introductory help Screen layout The screen layout has three main areas.  </s>
<s> The top 22 lines of the screen are used to display text.  </s>
<s> The twenty-third line is for messages while the bottom line is used for inputting commands or other data like web page addresses.  </s>
<s> The begining of the input area usually has a string like 'Command:' to tell what to enter.  </s>
<s> Scrolling You can use the following keys to move the text being viewed: ctrl-d scroll down ctrl-u scroll up ctrl-t scroll to top ctrl-b scroll to bottom ctrl-a lists these scrolling keys Quitting the browser To quit the browser, type 'bye' or 'quit'.  </s>
<s> Comoarison with the lynx browser This browser has some similarities to the lynx browser and certain significant differences.  </s>
<s> The lynx browser uses the 'g' command to enter a URL.  </s>
<s> To enter a URL for this browser, you press the ESC key and start entering the URL.  </s>
<s> When you are finished entering the URL, press the RETURN key.  </s>
<s> (If you change your mind about entering a URL, just type the ctrl-C key to cancel.) This browser annotates a web page with additional information.  </s>
<s> An analysis of the page is available by typing the analysis command or its abbreviation "a".  </s>
<s> A brief version of the analysis will appear in the message area if you type the ctrl-S key.  </s>
<s> The lynx browser uses the up and down arrows to move from link to link.  </s>
<s> This browser gives a little more context by moving to a line with one or more links.  </s>
<s> Each link is numbered rather than highlighted.  </s>
<s> The lynx browser responds to the TAB key just like the down arrow key.  </s>
<s> Also, the lynx browser jumps to both links and form fields.  </s>
<s> This browser uses the up and down arrows to just move to lines with links.  </s>
<s> The TAB key jumps to fields in a form or the beginning or end of a form.  </s>
<s> The vt100 does not support the ALT TAB key so the ctrl-R key is used as the reverse of the TAB key.  </s>
<s> To select a link or a form field, you can use the right arrow or the RETURN key like in lynx.  </s>
<s> In addition you can just type in the number of the link or the field id which is the number of the form followed by a period followed by the number of the field, e.g. 2.3 is the third field in the second form.  </s>
<s> Be sure to press RETURN after the link number or field id.  </s>
<s> If you wish to move the highlight to the line containing a specific link but not select the link, just type 'l' followed by a blank, the link number and the RETURN key.  </s>
<s> Similarly, you can move the highlight to the line containing a specific form field by typing 'f' followed by a blank, the field id and the RETURN key.  </s>
<s> If you want to move to the beginning of a form, type 'f' followed by a blank, the form number and the RETURN KEY.  </s>
<s> If the field you choose expects text input, the word 'Input: ' will be displayed in the 24th line instead of the word 'Command:'.  </s>
<s> Just type in the text input followed by the RETURN key.  </s>
<s> If you wish to cancel out of the input field, type the ctrl-C key.  </s>
<s> Three types of erasing are provided: backspaceerase one character ctrl-werase one word ctrl-xerase entire line of text The left arrow works in this browser like it does in lynx to return to the preious page.  </s>
<s> This browser uses the forward slash for searching for text on a page like the lynx browser.  </s>
<s> The basic difference is that this browser highlights the line containing the text instead of a nearby field or link.  </s>
<s> This browser provides a number of commands for scanning or navigating through a web page.  </s>
<s> A very useful key is the second function key which will scan forward to the next paragraph.  </s>
<s> Unfortunately the vt100 only supports four function keys.  </s>
<s> In order to keep function keys for the most useful commands, control keys and string commands are also used.  </s>
<s> The reverse of the second function key is ctrl-P.  </s>
<s> In the lynx browser, a highlighted area usually means something to select.  </s>
<s> In this browser, a highlighted line can have a couple of different uses.  </s>
<s> The first is the same as in lynx, i.e. idicating something to select.  </s>
<s> The second use of a highlighted line is to indicate where to start reading.  </s>
<s> For example, if you used the second function, which was just described, to go to the next paragraph, the first line of the paragraph is highlighted.  </s>
<s> This does not necessarily mean that there is anything to select, but that this is the line to start reading from.  </s>
<s> Tips for using this browser with screen readers There are several function you will need to have your screen reader perform in order to work well with this browser.  </s>
<s> They are: 1. notify you when the message on the twenty-third line changes 2. review the twenty-third line when you want 3. echo back characters as you type in commands, URL's or text input 4. read the twenty-fourth line containing input when you want 5. notify you of any text changes in the first 22 lines 6. locate a highlighted line 7. read a highlighted line 8. read starting at a highlighted line through the twenty-second line Some screen reader users have the punctuation pronounciation turned off.  </s>
<s> It is important to remember that there is a period in field id's between the form number and the field number.  </s>
<s> Also, nested table ids can have a combination of periods and hyphens, e.g. 2 hyphen 3 period 4 period 1 .  </s>
<s> Web page annotation This browser annotates each web page with additional information.  </s>
<s> The annontation can be controlled by the annontation menu which is displayed when you press the first function key.  </s>
<s> This menu lets you control such annotation as aspects like: paragrah numbering heading numbering list item numbering showing ends of links including the URL's for linkss including row or column labels in each table cell including ALT or source information for images showing image information only for images in links showing beginning and ends of fonts, subscripts or superscripts You can select items on the panel being displayed by typing the menu item number followed by the RETURN key.  </s>
<s> When you are finished making your choices, type 'save' or 'cancel'.  </s>
<s> A new version of the page will then replace the old version.  </s>
<s> Frames If this browser reads a page with frames, it will display a menu with a description of each frame.  </s>
<s> The description can include word count, number of links, number of forms and a list of significant words.  </s>
<s> To choose the desired frame, just enter the number of the frame followed by the RETURN key.  </s>
<s> If you ever want to change to a different frame for that page, just type the 'fs' command followed by the RETURN key to re-display the frames menu.  </s>
<s> Forms This browser marks the beginning and end of each form.  </s>
<s> The number of fields in the form are noted at the beginning of the form.  </s>
<s> As mention in another section, this browser lets you select a field either by moving the highlight to the line containing the field or by typing in the field id followed by the RETURN key.  </s>
<s> These methods can be used for all form fields including menu, submit, reset and image.  </s>
<s> If the field is a check box or radio button, 'YES' or 'NO' will indicate the status of the field.  </s>
<s> If the field is related to a menu of choices, a menu will be displayed with the list of choices.  </s>
<s> To make a selection, type the number of the selection followed by the RETURN key.  </s>
<s> You can also move the highlight to the line containing the choice and press the right arrow key or the RETURN key.  </s>
<s> When you are finished making your selection, type 'save' or 'cancel' followed by RETURN key.  </s>
<s> As discussed previously, if the field is for text input, the twenty-fourth line will display the input you're typing.  </s>
<s> A fast way for text input is just to type the field id followed by a space, the text you wish to input and the RETURN key.  </s>
<s> (The ctrl-x key will clear the line if you change your mind.) The TAB key and the ctrl-R key will let you move from line to line which include fields or the beginning or end of forms.  </s>
<s> Lists This browser indicates the beginning each list and notes the number of the items in the list.  </s>
<s> If the list contains sub-lists, the depth of the sub-list nesting is also noted.  </s>
<s> If the list has more than one item, the end of the list is indicated.  </s>
<s> This browser provides a way to move from list item to list.  </s>
<s> Just type 'i' followed by the RETURN key.  </s>
<s> If you are in a list, this command will move you either to the next item of the list, the beginning of the next sub-list or the end of the list, which ever comes first.  </s>
<s> If you are outside a list, this will move you to the beginning of the nearest list.  </s>
<s> The 'i-' command is the reverse of the 'i' command.  </s>
<s> The annotation menu for web pages has an option for full labeling of list items.  </s>
<s> (The default is for this option to be turned off.) If this option is active, the label for each item of a sub-list will include the numbers of the various parent items.  </s>
<s> For eaxmple, if you are looking at item 'b' in a sublist in item 3 of the main list, the item will only have label 'b' when the option is turned off.  </s>
<s> If the option is active, the item will be labelled 3.b instead of just 'b'.  </s>
<s> This option is probably more useful when there are lists inside lists inside lists.  </s>
<s> Tables This browser indicates the beginning and end of each table.  </s>
<s> At the beginning of the table, the browser includes additional information about the table such as number of rows, columns, number of spanning cells, number of missing cells (in an irregular table), nesting depth for sub-tables, any caption specified, etc.  </s>
<s> This information can be useful in guessing the purpose of the table.  </s>
<s> For example, a table with a small number of rows and columns is probably being used for formatting the display.  </s>
<s> Each cell in the table has an id of the row number followed by the column number, e.g. cell 3 4 would be the cell in row 3, column 4. The annotation menu for the web page has an option for including row labels and/or column labels in each cell.  </s>
<s> The borwser will also note which cells are the spanned from another cells.  </s>
<s> The cells in each table are written on the screen in a straight line down the screen where each cell follows the next, column by column, row by row.  </s>
<s> This layout means that if you started at the beginning of the table you would first encounter the cell for row 1 column 1, then row 1 column 2, etc until the last cell of row one is encountered.  </s>
<s> The first cell of row two would immedicately follow the last cell of row 1.  </s>
<s> If you are reading through the cells in a table and you are not sure which cell you are, the location command which you execute by typing ctrl-L will tell you what line you are on and which cell of which table.  </s>
<s> A useful command for navigating the table is the 'r' command followed by the RETURN key.  </s>
<s> If you are in a cell, this command will move you to the cell in the next row, but same column.  </s>
<s> The reverse of this command is 'r-' followed by the RETURN key.  </s>
<s> If you want to get to a specific row in the same column, you can type 'r' followed by a blank followed by the row number followed by the RETURN key.  </s>
<s> To get to the last row in a column, type 'r' followed by a blank, a dollar sign and the RETURN key.  </s>
<s> The 'c' command is just like the 'r' command except the row stays the same.  </s>
<s> If you are using 'r', 'r-', 'c', 'c-' without any numbers or dollar signs, you can use the period command without the RETURN key to repeat the command.  </s>
<s> If you want to get to a specific cell in the table, just type the row number followed by a comma followed by the column number and the RETURN key.  </s>
<s> You can use a dollar sign instead of a number to indicate the last one.  </s>
<s> Be sure to include the comma or the browser will interpret it as a field id.  </s>
<s> The 'ta' command followed by the RETURN key will move you to the beginning of the next table.  </s>
<s> The 'ta-' command followed by the RETURN key will move you to the beginning of the previous table.  </s>
<s> The 'ta' command, followeb by a blank, a table id and the RETURN key will move you to the beginning of the table specified.  </s>
<s> If you want to move to the end of the table you are in, type the 'end' command followed by the RETURN key.  </s>
<s> The 't' command and the 't-' command followed by the RETURN key act just like the 'i' and 'i-' commands for lists and list items.  </s>
<s> The 't' and 't-' commands move from cell to cell in the oreder on the display.  </s>
<s> Additional help Typing the help command followed by the RETURN key will display a help page specific to the page you are looking at.  </s>
<s> A list of help subjects will be displayed by typing 'help subjects' followed by the RETURN key.  </s>
<s> A list of commands can be displayed by typing 'help commands' followed by the RETURN key.  </s>
<s> This information can also be accessed by the command 'help commands'.  </s>
<s> Before reading this help page, please be sure that you have read the introductory help page.  </s>
<s> You can view that help page by typing the command help intro.  </s>
<s> Index Commands, function keys, control keys and arrow keys Input editting Quitting the browser Display commands Basic scroll commands Navigation commands Text searching Page stack commands Types of pages Welcome page Menus Specifying a URL Using an HTML FILE Web page annotation Web page navigation Web page table navigation Web page links and source command Web page form field commands Web page frames Adding a web page to favorite links list or link notes page Favorite links page Link notes page Link history page Download commands Commands, function keys, control keys and arrow keys The browser is controlled by a combination of commands, function keys, arrow keys and control keys.  </s>
<s> In general, the more frequent actions can be requested by function, control or arrow keys.  </s>
<s> Less frequent actions or actions requiring more complicated syntax are requested by commands.  </s>
<s> Commands are typed in the input area of the display which is the twenty-fourth line and must be followed by the RETURN key.  </s>
<s> Input editting Commands, URL's and text input are entered in the input area of the display.  </s>
<s> Certain control characters can be used to edit the input.  </s>
<s> These control characters are: backspace or ctrl-H erase one character ctrl-W erase a word ctrl-X clear input line If you are entering text or a URL, you can cancel the input by typing ctrl-C .  </s>
<s> If you are entering a command, the ctrl-C is ignored.  </s>
<s> However, you can clear a command by typing ctrl-X .  </s>
<s> Quitting the browser The browser recognizes three different commands for exiting.  </s>
<s> They are 'bye', 'quit' or just the letter 'q'.  </s>
<s> Which ever command is used for exiting the browser, it must be followed by the RETURN key.  </s>
<s> Display commands Two commands are provide for the display.  </s>
<s> The first command is 'refresh' or simply 're' for refreshing the display in case extraneous or noisy characters show up on the screen.  </s>
<s> The other command is 'clear' or just 'cl' in case you want to clear the screen temporarily.  </s>
<s> If you want the information redisplayed, just type the 'refresh' command or its abbreviation.  </s>
<s> A third command keycheck will let you check that the keys you are using are being understood by the browser.  </s>
<s> When this command is active, each key you type is echoed in the message area.  </s>
<s> This command is especially useful for checking the function keys and arrow keys along with the ESC key.  </s>
<s> When you are finished, just press the RETURN key.  </s>
<s> Basic scroll commands Six basic scrolling commands are provided.  </s>
<s> They are: ctrl-T scroll to the top ctrl-B scroll to the bottom ctrl-U scroll up a screen ctrl-V scroll up half a screen ctrl-D scroll down a screen ctrl-E scroll down half a screen If the command line contains a positive number, that number is used as a factor for the scroll commands.  </s>
<s> For example, if you type 3 into the command area and press the scroll down key ctrl-D , the browser will scroll down 3 screens instead of just one.  </s>
<s> The command area will then be cleared.  </s>
<s> The ctrl-A key will display a brief help line listing these scroll commands.  </s>
<s> Navigation commands The browser provides some additional commands for navigating around pages.  </s>
<s> The location key ctrl-L will display the current line number, e.g.: Line 56 of 95.  </s>
<s> If you want to go to a particular line, type the line number in the command area and then the go key ctrl-G .  </s>
<s> (This is one of the few cases when you don't need to type the RETURN key after a command.)  </s>
<s> You can move up or down so many lines by typing plur or minus followed by the number of lines, e.g. +30, followed by the RETURN key.  </s>
<s> (If you type 50 instead of plus followed by 50, the browser could interpret it as a link number.) The browser has special zap key ctrl-Z .  </s>
<s> If you move to another line on the page and then decide to return to where you were, just type the ctrl-Z key .  </s>
<s> The browser also lets you mark a line with the ctrl-N key.  </s>
<s> After you mark a line, you can always return to it by typing the go key ctrl-G with no line number in the command area.  </s>
<s> Text searching The browser has a text search command.  </s>
<s> To search for text, type the forward slash followed by the text to search for and then the RETURN key.  </s>
<s> The browser will look for a line containing the text specified.  </s>
<s> The search will be case insensitive.  </s>
<s> If you want to do the same search again, just type the forward slash followed immediately by the RETURN key.  </s>
<s> You can reverse the direction of the search by using the question mark instead of the forward slash.  </s>
<s> Be careful if you specify more than one word.  </s>
<s> The browser will only look for a line containing all the words specified instead of lines with the words specified split across them.  </s>
<s> Page stack commands The pages are kept in a stack like in Lynx, the Netscape browser or the Microsoft explorer.  </s>
<s> The left and right arrows work the same as in Lynx.  </s>
<s> This browser also has a forward command whose abbreviation is fo.  </s>
<s> This command works more like the forward action in the Netscape or Explorer browsers.  </s>
<s> The forward command is different than the right arrow key.  </s>
<s> The forward command goes to a page already in the stack.  </s>
<s> The right arrow usually pops off the top pages of the stack and adds a new page.  </s>
<s> Types of pages The browser works with a variety of pages, e.g. web pages, help pages, menus, links history, favorites list, frammeset.  </s>
<s> The commands discussed so far can be used with all the types of pages the browser knows.  </s>
<s> Some the pages have additional commands which are specific to the type of page.  </s>
<s> Welcome page You can always view the welcom page by typing the welcome command or its abbreviation we .  </s>
<s> Menus Menus are used for various purposes but have the same general structure.  </s>
<s> Each menu item has a number.  </s>
<s> To choose a particular item in a menu, just type the number followed by the RETURN key.  </s>
<s> The other method is to move the highlight bar to the desired menu item and then press the RETURN key or the right arrow key.  </s>
<s> When you are finished making your choice, type save which can be abbreviated to sa or cancel which has an abbreviation ca .  </s>
<s> Specifying a URL If you would like to specify a URL, first press the ESC key.  </s>
<s> The browser will display http:// which is the beginning of the URL.  </s>
<s> Just type in the rest of the URL and press the RETURN key.  </s>
<s> If you want to cancel out of specifying a URL, press the ctrl-C key.  </s>
<s> You can only specify a URL if you are viewing a web page or if you are at the Welcome page at the beginning of the page stack.  </s>
<s> If another type of page is being displayed, the browser won't allow you to enter a URL.  </s>
<s> Using an HTML FILE If you have an HTML file you want to view with the browser, you can send it to the browser.  </s>
<s> First, copy the HTML into the operating system's text/paste buffer or clipboard.  </s>
<s> Then make sure that the browser is expecting a command.  </s>
<s> Next paste the HTML file into the window which has the telnet session.  </s>
<s> Finally, press the ctrl-A key.  </s>
<s> If you change your mind, press the ctrl-C key to cancel.  </s>
<s> Some HTML files specify links relative to the URL of the file.  </s>
<s> If you pass a file which uses relative URL's to the browser, the browser might have problems with the relative links.  </s>
<s> If the HTML file uses the BASE tag, there will be no relative URL link problem.  </s>
<s> Web page annotation The browser has the ability to annotate the web page in a number of different ways.  </s>
<s> The beginning of each web page is preceeded by an analysis of the page including a list of the most frequent words and the counts of forms, images, tables, etc.  </s>
<s> At various points in the page additional descriptive or informational text is included.  </s>
<s> The types and amounts of annotation is controlled by the annotation menu.  </s>
<s> If you are viewing a web page, you can active this menu by either pressing the first function key or the ctrl-Y key.  </s>
<s> The menu covers a couple of screens.  </s>
<s> Some of the options are: Numbering the paragraphs Numbering the headings Using full label on list items, e.g. 3.a.  </s>
<s> instead of just a. Labeling ends of links Showing URL's for links Showing cell labels in large tables only Showing row or column label in each table cell Listing various pieces of image information Showing information about images only in links Including different levels of font information or subscript/superscript information Web page navigation A variety of commands and keys are provided to quickly navigate to various interesting "landmarks" on a web page.  </s>
<s> Usually you can move forward or backward to next type of "landmark".  </s>
<s> For some types of landmarks, e.g. links, you can also go directly to a specific landmark.  </s>
<s> The commands are: landmark type next previous specific paragraph p p- p followed by paragraph number heading h h- h followed by heading number link l l- l followed by link number form field f f- f followed by field id list item i i- none table ta ta- ta followed by table number table item t t- none All of these commands need to be followed by the RETURN key.  </s>
<s> Some of the more frequently used commands can be executed by function keys, arrow keys or ctrl keys.  </s>
<s> key command landmark type down arrow l link up arrow l- link TAB f form field ctrl-R f- form field function key 2 p paragraph ctrl-O p paragraph (same as function key 2) ctrl-P p- paragraph The paragraph command is an excellent way to skim through a page.  </s>
<s> It will stop at the beginning of each paragraph or heading.  </s>
<s> The list item command will move from list item to list item.  </s>
<s> It will also stop at the beginning and end of each list.  </s>
<s> The table item command similarly stops at the beginning and end of each table.  </s>
<s> The form field command will also stop at the beginning and end of each form.  </s>
<s> Web page table navigation The browser provides a number of commands for navigating within a table.  </s>
<s> type next previous specific row r r- r followed by row number or $ column c c- c followed by column number or $ If you are repeating the same relative action, i.e. r, r-, c, or c-, you can use the cell repeat key which is the period.  </s>
<s> You don't need to press the RETURN key after the period.  </s>
<s> If you are in a table and want to know which cell you are in, the location key ctrl-L will tell you not only what line you are in, but also which cell in which table.  </s>
<s> If you would like to move to a specific cell in the table, just type the row number followed by a comma and then the column number.  </s>
<s> If you want to move to the end of the table, just type the end command followed by the RETURN key.  </s>
<s> If you want to reach the end of another table, type the end key followed by the table number.  </s>
<s> Some cells are spanned or carried over from an original cell.  </s>
<s> If you are in a spanned cell and want to go to the original cell, just type the span command folowed by the RETURN key.  </s>
<s> If you wish to reach the original cell of some other spanned cell, type the span command followed by the cell row , a comma, the cell column and the RETURN key.  </s>
<s> Web page links and source command There are two methods for linking to another page.  </s>
<s> One is to just type the number of the link followed by the RETURN key.  </s>
<s> The other method is to move the highlight bar to the line with the desired link and either press the RETURN key or the right arrow key.  </s>
<s> If you are looking at at web page and would to see the source, just type the source command followed by the RETURN key.  </s>
<s> If you want to see the source for a link, type the source command followed by the link number and the RETURN key.  </s>
<s> Web page form field commands If you are using a form and want to set a field, there are two methods.  </s>
<s> One is to just type the field id followed by the RETURN key.  </s>
<s> The other method is to move the highlight bar to the line with the desired field and either press the RETURN key or the right arrow key.  </s>
<s> The response to your choosing a field depends on the type of field chosen.  </s>
<s> CHECKBOX - the browser will toggle the checkbox setting RADIO BUTTON - the browser will turn on that field and turn off all other fields in the same radio button group TEXT or PASSWORD - the browser will prompt you for text SELECT MENU - the browser will display a menu with various choices SUBMIT - the browser will send field information to server IMAGE - the browser will act like a submit field is chosen RESET - the browser will reset field values in form back to original values If the field being chosen is a text field, you can type the text you want to enter immediately after a blank following the field id.  </s>
<s> If you type the field id by itself, the current contents will be displayed to be editted.  </s>
<s> Web page frames If the web page you've chosen has frames, a list of the frames will be displayed.  </s>
<s> Each frame listed will have additional information like number of links or significant words.  </s>
<s> To choose a frame, type the number followed by the RETURN key.  </s>
