The outreach and education effort about WAI is at a critical point now. 
Cynthia D. Waddell Cynthia D. Waddell ADA Coordinator City Manager Department City of San Jose, CA USA 801 North First Street, Room 460 San Jose, CA 95110-1704 (408)277-4034 (408)971-0134 TTY Working for government force will just add another reason to the pile encouraging companies and people to take their sites offshore (encryption restriction, taxes, etc.), and besides which it pisses people off to tell them what to do (instead of showing them how it can help them). 
The conservative and libertarian sites that are railing against section 508 (if I've got the number right) would be taking exactly the opposite approach if instead the WAI were presented as an industry consortium voluntarily embracing a diverse Internet community without government involvement. 
That really sounds great but has had essentially zero effect. 
The publicity surrounding Section 508 has had much effect including engendering "backlash" from the usual suspects. 
Got to have standards. 
Got to enforce the standards. 
In matters similar to this in all civil/human rights movements there is this frequent cry "you can't legislate morality, what's needed is education." 
One of the best educations is a 2x4 upside yo' head. 
I don't know if Chris is advocating we take no further steps to promulgate regulations concerning standards compliance by government Web sites or the proscription against our taxes being used to buy inaccessible software, but if he is... Love. 
ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE 
Mr. Maden: If I may, I would like to point out an interesting fact that US civil rights law, especially the ADA and the upcoming Section 508, does have a geographical impact on the web even though it is cyberspace. 
CM:But I feel that there is a fundamental difference between the physical world and the Internet which radically changes the legal game in ways that make the bathroom metaphor break down. 
For example, the ADA appropriately speaks of "effective communication" rather than the physical, bathroom metaphor you mention, as the means for providing access to the web. 
CM: For starters, there's the matter of jurisdiction. 
A building in San Francisco is unquestionably in the jurisdiction of the City and County of San Francisco, the State of California, and the USA. 
If the building's management finds the ADA onerous, they may complain, they may drag their heels, but they'll have to comply eventually because they can't just move the building management concern out of the affected jurisdiction. 
But what jurisdiction is, say, canada.com 
in? 
The domain is adminstered by Network Solutions, Inc., a US entity, but the contact address for the domain is in Ontario, with network service through AT&amp;T of Canada. 
If their Web site isn't compliant when a US user tries to use it, who enforces the guidelines? 
For that matter, whose guidelines are used? 
Now consider the case of a large company, say Microsoft, who has the facilities to simply move their Web services offshore (say, to HavenCo). 
Whose jurisdiction are they in then? 
The ADA is also very clear about jurisdiction. 
"Effective communication" requirements, such as accessible web design, must be carried out by entities subject to the ADA and the enforcement is not local. 
Enforcement of the ADA is national and carried out by the designated federal enforcement agencies. 
Your thoughts on jurisdiction for the building in San Francisco is not quite correct. 
The building in San Francisco is subject to both local, State and Federal accessibility laws. 
US civil rights mandates that the most restrictive, or in other words, the most accessible building code elements must be implemented. 
US companies operating overseas must also adhere to the ADA and the "effective communication" requirement for accessible web design. 
Although US law does not require non-American businesses overseas to adhere to the ADA, American businesses operating in the US and abroad must adhere to the ADA. 
From a legal point of view, caselaw is emerging in this area and it will certainly be interesting to watch the development. 
My view is that while technology changes, civil rights do not. 
Cyberspace is not exempt from human rights issues. 
After all, if cyberspace is to continue as a domain for human interaction, why would we not want to encourage full participation for everyone? 
The W3C WAI effort should be embraced by the global community.

I have been following this discussion with some amusement and some consternation. 
I am wondering if the person who says the force of law will produce gruding compliance, has ever had find a restroom that could accomdate their wheelchair? 
No, I haven't. 
I assume your point is that it's now fairly easy, at least in public buildings, thanks to the ADA. 
If not, then I'm not sure I understand. 
But I feel that there is a fundamental difference between the physical world and the Internet which radically changes the legal game in ways that make the bathroom metaphor break down.

Now consider the case of a large company, say Microsoft, who has the facilities to simply move their Web services offshore (say, to HavenCo). 
Whose jurisdiction are they in then? 
Then there's the matter of violation detection. 
In meatspace, there are building codes and regular inspections; the buildings in a city can be enumerated and visited sequentially. 
Even assuming that the WACG are adopted globally, it's trivial to create a page that passes any computer-driven test of the page without actually being accessible. 
No government has the resources to monitor the entire Internet manually. 
So it'll be left to individuals with standing to pursue enforcement, whether by litigation or by pushing for prosecution. 
In these cases, I can't see how the resources exist to pursue multiple instances of what would likely be lengthy trials if the defendants were stubborn in the slightest. 
Add to that the fact that many Web sites undergo complete redesigns, starting from scratch, and enforcement becomes next to impossible. 
Only an organization with a real commitment to accessible content can sustain accessibility through these redesigns. 
Which brings me to my final point: human nature. 
People really do not like being told what to do. 
With a gun pointed at their head (which is what any law not completely irrelevant comes down to), they will do as they are told. 
But if detection, jurisdiction, and enforcement are that difficult, who holds the gun and where does it point? 
Making threats which will, in most cases, amount to a bluff, will only irritate content creators. 
Education will produce content creators that understand the tangible benefits of accessibility; as JM Straczynski wrote, "The universe is composed of matter, energy, and enlightened self-interest." 
I appreciate the work that's going into accessibility education, by the W3C and others. 
I think that the work on legislation is counterproductive, though, and that adding those energies to the education effort instead would have a greatly increased benefit. 
One thing that's become clearer and clearer to me is that the curb cut metaphor cuts quite deep; navigational tools for people with limited vision or mobility limitations make for more effective computer use by everyone, and information design theory for people with cognitive challenges creates information more effectively consumed by everyone. 
This is the message that really needs to get out.

Well put Michael Burks, If you are lucky enough to find a restroom large enough for disabled people, the odds are it is being used as extra storage space. 
I make this point, as it seems to me having followed this group for more than 6 months now, there are a few people that make valid points but too many times they get lost in the techno babble. 
To coin a well worn phrase "when up to your butt in alligators, it is difficult to remember the original objective was to clear the swamp" I would respectfully ask when did the list members last read the mission statement? 
Perhaps a better way is not to treat the symptoms, but attempt to cure the disease. 
To force an issue in law is to antagonize, however to educate is to enlighten. 
The people that should be targeted for building accessible sites are the young and next generation of web builders. 
Not the ' I love rotating gifs, Java and big images built in frames' brigade. 
Has anyone asked the question what is the average life span of a web page? 
To force a company to change a site by law is expensive for everyone and will be resisted. 
The extra costs will be added to the products or services. 
But to educate and have new or updated pages accessible as they go up, I believe is the way forward. 
err........is that me off the list now?

Well put, Paul Davis. 
Bathroom stories are always interesting, in that they remind us of the human factor issue. 
I remember starting work as an ADA compliance officer for a university and finding that the Human Resource office had used the only accessible bathroom to store their water bottles for the water cooler. 
There was a perception that no one really needed to use the restroom. 
Yet, it was the only accessible restroom in the building for both employees and members of the public. 
Employment applications were completed by applicants in this building and testing was provided for placement in the job application pool. 
By not having an accessible bathroom, people with disabilities were effectively barred from applying to work on the campus as well as from working as employees in this building. 
Accessible web design is a necessity and removes barriers that I am sure many do not intend. 
Like the bathroom example, everyone wanted water for the water cooler but failed to understand the impact of their action. 
Let's not make the same mistake.
