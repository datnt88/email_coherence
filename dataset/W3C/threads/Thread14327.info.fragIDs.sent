<s> Just some scattered thoughts on what the "principles" are.  </s>
<s> The level of granularity and resolution can vary a -lot- even if we want to keep this entirely technology-agnostic.  </s>
<s> On the simplest level, I define the guiding principle of web accessibility as: "Don't assume that everyone uses the web the same way."  </s>
<s> I can't think of a single (technology-agnostic or otherwise) principle, guideline, or checkpoint that doesn't flow from that.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, it's not very useful.  </s>
<s> Are we trying to define a philosophy, a religion, a mindset as a W3C specification?  </s>
<s> Will the Advisory Committee (who approve the guidelines) and TimBL (who also does) sign off on such a document?  </s>
<s> Has anyone asked either of them what they would like to see us deliver?  </s>
<s> It's possible that they'd _prefer_ to approve a technology-specific set of guidelines over a generic set of philosophies.  </s>
<s> At one time I wrote something called "six principles of web accessibility."  </s>
<s> It's on the HWG web site at: (Also accessible from http://kynn.com/+6principles)  </s>
<s> I defined six core ideas: I. Create pages that conform to accepted standards.  </s>
<s> II.  </s>
<s> Know the difference between structural and presentational elements; use stylesheets when appropriate.  </s>
<s> III.  </s>
<s> Use HTML 4.0 features to provide information about the purpose and function of elements.  </s>
<s> IV. Make sure your pages can be navigated by keyboard.  </s>
<s> V. Provide alternative methods to access non-textual content, including images, scripts, multimedia, tables, forms and frames, for user agents that do not display them.  </s>
<s> VI. Be wary of common pitfalls that can reduce the accessibility of your site.  </s>
<s> "I" is properly T-A (technology-agnostic) and basically says use the standards, don't use non-standard stuff.  </s>
<s> That's a good one.  </s>
<s> "II" is good although the reference to stylesheets sounds more like a strategy than pure principle.  </s>
<s> A better way to write this is "separate content from presentation." "III" is quite clearly technology-biased (T-B) because it refers to HTML 4.0 by name.  </s>
<s> And it's much more of a HTDTRT guideline than a guiding principle.  </s>
<s> It doesn't really belong, does it?  </s>
<s> "IV" is nice and vague in a way, but it's also a special case -- keyboard access refers to a specific input device.  </s>
<s> Better to say "make sure your site can be navigated by any input device."  </s>
<s> That's real easy to say, though, isn't it?  </s>
<s> "V" sounds like it's straight from the WCAG.  </s>
<s> It probably is.  </s>
<s> A better principle is "always have the ability to fall back upon structured plain text to express content".  </s>
<s> "VI" is a nasty hack.  </s>
<s> In the original document it was a catch-all to contain things that didn't fit.  </s>
<s> I would rather say "be aware of deficiencies in common browsers and access methods, and compensate appropriately whenever possible."  </s>
<s> It may not be possible to be properly T-A and still provide any sort of useful information.  </s>

<s> KB:: "It may not be possible to be properly T-A and still provide any sort of useful information."  </s>
<s> WL: Perhaps the "properly T-A (techno-agnostic)" is more for guidance than strict "information".  </s>
<s> Maybe this is about more than designing Web sites?  </s>
<s> What are Web Content Accessibility Guidelines a part of; what are they for?  </s>
<s> What Guides the Guidelines?  </s>
<s> This ain't yet another markup language and we are constantly stressing something like "we can't really objectively define accessibility, but we know it when we encounter it."  </s>
<s> Hence "general/abstract".  </s>
<s> KB:: "Will the Advisory Committee (who approve the guidelines) and TimBL (who also does) sign off on such a document?  </s>

<s> WL: I guess we'll find out.  </s>
<s> Love. ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE  </s>
<s> Can we ask, discretely?  </s>
<s> I actually don't know enough about internal W3C politics to find out if this would be a good move or a really bad one.  </s>
<s> Maybe I'll just defer to Judy's understanding of the situation?  </s>
