I'm going nuts trying to find the java package org.xml.dom.*. 
Where can I find it? 
Steve Mato I'm really not sure what you mean, nor what you are exactly looking for. 
The XML java package for DOM is called org.w3c.dom.xml. 
But there is currently no java package available which implements the DOM as far as I know. 
For sure W3C hasn't provide any. 
The only material currently available is the draft specification of the DOM. 
This can be find at Arnaud Le Hors - W3C, User Interface Domain - www.w3.org/People/Arnaud Thanx for the reply. 
I was trying to rebuild the SAX &amp; SAXDOM java classes. 
The later is the file which refered to it. 
I found it in a most recent SAXDOM distribution. 
Thanx again, Steve Mato There was one distributed with SAXDOM.
