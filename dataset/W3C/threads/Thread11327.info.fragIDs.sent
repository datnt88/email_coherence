<s> [Pardon coming into the middle of this -- I've been out of circuit for the last two weeks and haven't yet begun to catch up.  </s>
<s> But finding a (surprising) discussion of LINK that isn't part of the LINK(ing) discussion, I thought I'd interject.  </s>
<s> Pardon the length -- I want to address most of David's points.]  </s>
<s> You're forcing me to read the LINK specifications again, to cite the support for my assertions.  </s>
<s> This is fine, but the pain will not improve my humor, I'm afraid.  </s>
<s> Agreed.  </s>
<s> And coming into the SGML community without any preconceived notion that link is bad and evil and icky (which seems almost religious to many for reasons I still don't understand), I find LINK to be a fine solution for the problems it seems designed to solve.  </s>
<s> Certainly it has limitations, but they don't warrant throwing the baby out with the bathwater.  </s>
<s> I've yet to see proof that there is a baby.  </s>
<s> The particular usage of LINK that led me earlier to propose its inclusion in XML is the same one as for HTML: attaching SDA attributes to a document instance for transformation to the ICADD DTD.  </s>
<s> The added features of LINK over the proposed alternative ATTLIST solution (context-sensitive processing for one) make me question why ATTLIST is even considered -- they are not a direct match functionally.  </s>
<s> The disadvantage is that the attributes are not "real" attributes, but are attributes in some "result document".  </s>
<s> This creates confusion when you have two attributes with the same name and different values.  </s>
<s> We need not even open that can of worms if we stay away from link...  </s>
<s> It allows me to attach a separate attribute space to elements based on one of a number of predeclared (in the document) schemes.  </s>
<s> It allows me to dispatch to an external process with indefined semantics to establish those values.  </s>
<s> I'm not clear on what you mean by 'in the document', as LINK doesn't require anything different than ATTLIST as regards 'in the document': both can simply show up as a single declaration in the declaration subset.  </s>
<s> Nothing in the document instance needs modification.  </s>
<s> If the DS insertion is what's bothering you, nsgmls allows LPDs to be declared externally on the command line, so LINK has that advantage over DS-based ATTLISTs.  </s>
<s> Well, this was an attempt to address the usefulness of what link claims to be useful for -- some form of processing.  </s>
<s> I understand it all right, but I think processing information should _never_ be in the document instance.  </s>
<s> I agree completely (except when the document is part of a transform process).  </s>
<s> No, just never.  </s>
<s> The transform process is a separate thing, and should be  </s>
<s> stored separately.  </s>
<s> I still don't understand why there isn't more screaming about some of the extensive proposed XML uses of PIs.  </s>
<s> I find PIs as abhorrent as some do LPDs.  </s>
<s> I agree, but I decided that since I lost the battle against PIs, that I could rationalize XML PIs (only) as not too evil, since they have a defined semantics, and take advantage of the only syntactic extension hook we have.  </s>
<s> This latter is only a need because we opted for syntactic compatibility with DTDs rather than instance syntax.  </s>
<s> The thought that users (and Netscape and MS) can make their own PIs still makes me very nervous...  </s>
<s> Use of LINK doesn't require processing information be embedded in the document instance, which is precisely one of its benefits.  </s>
<s> The alternative proposed ICADD solution of using multiple ATTLISTs *does* require adding the ATTLIST declaration to the declaration subset, which I find less desireable for precisely the reason you state above.  </s>
<s> I don't know from ICADD.  </s>
<s> The lack of multiple attlist delcarations is a continual thorn in the side of DTD authoring, well worthy on its own merits -- Once we have it, though, we no longer need another way to allow people to attach atributes to elements in documents.  </s>
<s> It's not the acme of elegance, but it uses no new syntax, no new semantics of output processing and LINK attributes, and has all the power that we need (as does IMPLICIT LINK).  </s>
<s> [...] And I think that the separate attribute space makes it much less useful, because there is no LINK-free meaning to LINK attributes.  </s>
<s> If the purpose of LINK is either element-specific, context-sensitive, or document-global GI mapping of attributes onto a document instance, then essentially this argument is also true of stylesheets, yet I've never heard this argument applied there.  </s>
<s> I and others did make precisely this argument to the HTML-wg over adding STYLE attributes in the document instance, and look where that went.  </s>
<s> I think both Terry Allen and I were hoarse at the end.  </s>
<s> But this isn't about presentation, this is about assisting transformation between DTDs, which would seem to have wider application than simply ICADD.  </s>
<s> No, it's about attaching architecture attributes to elements.  </s>
<s> Context sensitive processing in style sheets is in the style sheets, not in the document, so I don't see the relevance of the above.  </s>
<s> Given that transformation of existing HTML documents to ICADD via either ATTLIST or LINK requires more processing than is done by most browsers (which typically don't process a DTD), the actual source of the contextual mapping should contain the necessary information needed to perform the task without a DTD.  </s>
<s> This also makes sense with DTD-less XML documents.  </s>
<s> Provided with either an LPD or HTML-to-ICADD ATTLIST declaration, the LPD contains more of the necessary data for context-sensitive transformation, where the ATTLIST doesn't unless also accompanied by the DTD it is designed to modify.  </s>
<s> I don't see the relevance of compiling to ICADD.  </s>
<s> Sounds like an application for a DSSSL transformation, not a parser.  </s>
<s> We are trying to choose a mechanism to attach default attributes to instances without DTDs.  </s>
<s> So in fact, I still don't really see the use.  </s>
<s> I read the "nutshell" description several times, but I still have not seen any use for the mechanism that an external stylesheet sould not satisfy better.  </s>
<s> If it attached _real_ attributes to elements it might be useful for situations like this, but separate attlist declarations are a much more transparent and clean way to get that benefit, so again, I fail to see the value.  </s>
<s> I don't understand your differentiation of 'real' attributes vs. 'fake' ones.  </s>
<s> An LPD could be written to exactly mirror an ATTLIST declaration, but not vice-versa, as ATTLISTs don't contain #USELINK parameters (to my knowledge), so there is no mechanism for context-sensitivity.  </s>
<s> The SGML standard differentiates LINK attibutes from regular atributes.  </s>
<s> They exist in two namespaces, and may have different values (since the idea is that the link attributes apply to some "output document type").  </s>
<s> Now if this seems confusing that's because it it.  </s>
<s> LINK attributes are not the same as regular attributes, and you can even have link attributes with the same names as regular attributes and different values.  </s>
<s> SGML does not define a way for an element instance, to override a default LINK attribute declared in a LINK declaration.  </s>
<s> We would have to define rules of precedence for LINK attributes and regular attributes.  </s>
<s> The rhetoric is dogmatic, hence my use of 'religious.' I agree that almost all criticism I've heard in the past year (and I've heard a fair bit) amounts to either 'it doesn't do everything I want' or 'it's not implemented in enough products'.  </s>
<s> The former argument stresses that it's too simple, the latter that it's too complicated.  </s>
<s> It can't be both.  </s>
<s> Sorry, but it can.  </s>
<s> LINK reminds me of assembly language.  </s>
<s> Not much there, but still hard to use.  </s>
<s> Of course LINK is not (even close to) turing-complete, so it's only an analogy.  </s>
<s> I think the method of doing context0-sensitivity in LINK is arcane, and hard to manage, and I still see no need for it once we have DSSSL (and lots of other transformation engines).  </s>
<s> So: hard to understand, and not very powerful.  </s>
<s> IMO, it's a chicken and egg thing: nobody saw an immediate use for or paid enough attention to LINK to bother implementing it, therefore not enough people understand it well enough to know how it might be used.  </s>
<s> I don't see anything that link can do that DSSSL can't do better, and it doesn't even solve the attribute assignment problem without adding further definitions of priority between "link attributes" and "attributes".  </s>
<s> (See 8879 4.165-4.171,  </s>
<s> 4.10.  </s>
<s> You can also look in Charles' book in chapters 5, 12).  </s>
<s> And we have a construct that for many committed SGML users is a red-flag.  </s>
<s> Seems technically and politically inferior to me...  </s>
<s> Politically, yes.  </s>
<s> Technically I don't see it as any different than any other aspect of 8879.  </s>
<s> Well, it's less-clearly documented than any other part of 8879, DSSSL provides equivalent but more powerful features.  </s>
<s> And it is underspecified, at least according to Goldfarb (p. 172): "In particular, although the nominal result of processing is a document instance that conforms to the result DTD, this is merely a conceptual device to permit specification of the processing terms of the result document instead of, or in addition to, the source document, if that should be desirable.  </s>
<s> The actual result could be anything at all."  </s>
<s> At any rate, the result is not required to be _anything in particular_ -- certainly not the annotation of the ESIS (or whatever the application sees) with new attribute values not declared in the document.  </s>
<s> In other words conforming LINK implementations according to 8879 are _not_ required to look at, or even have access to, link attributes.  </s>
<s> This could create a compatibility problem even between the 3 applications that have implemented LINK.  </s>
<s> Since the semantics of LINK are undefined, they are a blank slate on which presumable usefulness can be projected -- but to me it just looks blank.  </s>
<s> ie., you haven't had a need for it.  </s>
<s> Fair enough.  </s>
<s> No, I don't see a guarantee in 8879 that an SGML application will _do_ anything predictable with a LINK specification -- just a specification of what LINK attribute lists will be visible to whatever it is that application decides to do.  </s>
<s> That's not enough to be more than a blank.  </s>
<s> It's a processing spec.  </s>
<s> that I can't even count on to process for me, because I can't tell what it's going to do with the link attributes.  </s>
<s> I don't want to put processing information in my document instances -- so one use for LINK is anathema to me.  </s>
<s> Read the back issues of this list for many arguments on why processing should _not_ be part of documents.  </s>
<s> I believe I addressed this above, although I'm open to being countered.  </s>
<s> I missed it, if so...  </s>
<s> I don't believe that LINK solve the attribute attachment problem because it explicitly allows LINK attribute names to be the same as document attribute names -- so it just doesn't address the problem unless you mis-implement it.  </s>
<s> For the purposes of ICADD transformation, I don't see this as a problem at all.  </s>
<s> And with #USELINK this is reduced to a non-issue, non?  </s>
<s> What does ICADD transformation have to do with the price of long green beens in Bulgaria?  </s>
<s> I could find more than two reasons to discard a substantial portion of HTML 3.2, but that doesn't mean that others don't find a valuable usage.  </s>
<s> LINK for HTML and XML has a usage regardless of whether people like it or not: ICADD transformation.  </s>
<s> As we get into more complex element/attribute mapping (specifically, document structure and complex tables) I don't see ATTLISTs as an adequate solution.  </s>
<s> And at the point we're at, I'd hate to cut XML out of what may be the best solution.  </s>
<s> DSSSL transformation engines are the probable preferred mechanism for XML...  </s>
<s> Elegant and powerful are not the words that come to my mind.  </s>
<s> Adjectives again.  </s>
<s> I plead guilty to having used them without further explanation.  </s>
<s> If anyone wants to know *why* [I think] LINK is powerful, just ask.  </s>
<s> I will be happy to attempt a clear, concise and (hopefully) convincing explanation -- with XML-related examples.  </s>
<s> I find writing without adjectives rather boring.  </s>
<s> I believe Steve was referring to usage of adjectives in the advertising sense.  </s>
<s> I believe that his response came after a list of reasons I think LINK inadequate.  </s>
<s> I would also challenge anyone who claims that LINK can do _anything_ to show me how the language in the standard itself supports that claim.  </s>
<s> I can understand Charles' book, but nothing has ever made the normative text make sense to me.  </s>
<s> We could add 'whitens your teeth' too, but without proof it has no meaning.  </s>
<s> I certainly find an LPD more elegant than an ATTLIST declaration.  </s>
<s> I've been able to describe an LPD to completely SGML-illiterate people, so it can't be that obtuse.  </s>
<s> For specifying an attribute value (all we have called on LINK to do here), it is much less obvious why we need a new construct, when we can get the same effect (specifying a default attribute value, not transforming documents), by removing a limitation of ATTLIST declarations that many already find burdensome.  </s>
<s> I also don't want to recpitulate the entire argument -- it never seems to resolve -- but that last fact of non-resolution is a good reason to avoid LINK in my opinion.  </s>
<s> Filibustering?  </s>
<s> Don't laugh, but my fingers _are_ getting sore.....  </s>
<s> If so few people know about or use LINK, how could it be so 'widely detested'?  </s>
<s> I wouldn't make it a requirement of XML systems, I would simply *allow* it in the SGML declaration so that those who would like to use it may.  </s>
<s> It's certainly no more of a hack than multiple ATTLISTs.  </s>
<s> Lots of people try to read the standard or Charles' book, or Erik's book... None of these seems to have made LINK attractive.  </s>
<s> certainly it was 10 years or more from the issuance of the standard when I heard anyne do anything other than groan when LINK came up.  </s>
<s> It's only widely detested among people who know about it, true, but that might tell you something.  </s>
<s> I'm not quite sure what David's objection is here.  </s>
<s> As I already pointed  </s>
<s> out,  </s>
<s> SP (and nsgmls) already support LINK, so it will not be a major task for  </s>
<s> any systems based on this parser to add the required capability.  </s>
<s> LINK is also supported by another important parser, Mark-It, upon which many other products are built (including at least one pre-eminent SGML editor, as far as I know).  </s>
<s> And by no other parsers to my knowledge.  </s>
<s> A less than overwhelming showing.  </s>
<s> And can you use LINK specs that work with one to get a repeatable effect with the other?  </s>
<s> I don't thing so.  </s>
<s> Chicken and egg, as I said above.  </s>
<s> Underspecified, as I said above.  </s>
<s> The argument that adding LINK to XML adds complexity to the specification is certainly valid  </s>
<s> Yep. , but only insofar as the specification, not a specific  </s>
<s> implementation.  </s>
<s> What, they don't have to implement what we specify?  </s>
<s> Seems that it complicates both.  </s>
<s> If LINKTYPE processing is allowed as an option (described in an addendum) rather than proscribed in the spec  </s>
<s> Wasn't _no optional features_ a design goal?  </s>
<s> even insofar as describing a subset such as simple and implicit links (with no explicit), we would avoid muddying the document instance and allow for context-sensitive transformations without putting the burden on stylesheet processing (which is certainly light years more complex than simply adding LINK to XML).  </s>
<s> But we are going to have stylesheet processing anyway, and we are specifying a language, not a transformation engine -- there's no need to confuse the two, just because 8879 did...  </s>
<s> Or we could simply allow the 8879 definition of LINK as an option and point to that specification.  </s>
<s> Not acceptable because the XML specification must stand on its own.  </s>
<s> How many months of bitter argument do you think it would take to restate the LINK rules and reach agreement that they are compatible with the mangled prose of the standard?  </s>
<s> And yes, I do feel like I'm trying to revive a beaten, dead horse.  </s>
<s> I just don't understand why it was killed in the first place.  </s>
<s> Anyway, Jon said that LINK will only be considered if multiple ATTLISTs fail.  </s>
<s> so let's just give this a rest, or take it off the list.  </s>

<s> The particular usage of LINK that led me earlier to propose its inclusion in XML is the same one as for HTML: attaching SDA attributes to a document instance for transformation to the ICADD DTD.  </s>
<s> The added features of LINK  </s>
<s> Sometimes I feel like I'm just sitting on a different planet, not necessarily Earth.  </s>
<s> The whole point of any transformation process, whether it be DTD to DTD or adding presentational information from a stylesheet, is to begin with one document and end with another.  </s>
<s> There is a source document and a result document.  </s>
<s> Yes, they may contain like-named elements and attributes.  </s>
<s> Why in the world this would be confusing is beyond me.  </s>
<s> I was not clear.  </s>
<s> There is a source document.  </s>
<s> There are [possibly] intermediate documents.  </s>
<s> And there is a result document.  </s>
<s> Some of these intermediate documents are stored permanently, some not.  </s>
<s> By design.  </s>
<s> A transformation process by definition.  </s>
<s> I still don't understand why there isn't more screaming about some of the extensive proposed XML uses of PIs.  </s>
<s> I find PIs as abhorrent as some do LPDs.  </s>
<s> This is the reason I don't want to see XML define link semantics that show up in the instance, specifically as PIs or as an agreed-upon set of attribute values.  </s>
<s> This was IMO one failure of the HTML REL/REV proposal: defining some portion of an attribute namespace.  </s>
<s> If we take either the PI or attribute value approach, once we see a completely i18n'd SGML and accompanying tools, Chinese authors can write XML instances using Chinese, *except* for the links that show up as something akin to I do believe we should agree on a minimal set of link behaviours, and define names for those behaviors in English.  </s>
<s> It is, after all, the language of the specification.  </s>
<s> But we need an indirection mechanism to abstract the link names so that Chinese documents won't need to include 'toc', 'previous', 'next', etc. which may have no meaning to them.  </s>
<s> This (from what I can gather) would be necessary if we used the PI or attribute namespace solution.  </s>
<s> Use of LINK doesn't require processing information be embedded in the document instance, which is precisely one of its benefits.  </s>
<s> The alternative proposed ICADD solution of using multiple ATTLISTs *does* require adding the ATTLIST declaration to the declaration subset, which I find less desireable for precisely the reason you state above.  </s>
<s> If you don't want the same processing for elements in differing contexts, ATTLISTs won't do it for you.  </s>
<s> As I mentioned before, ATTLISTs don't provide context-sensitive mapping, so it's only a partial solution.  </s>
<s> [time passes.]  </s>
<s> OK. I've just received a copy of the discussion leading up to this, so some of the questions and confusion falls away.  </s>
<s> From what I can see, we are trying to provide an indirection mechanism for XML-LINK so that specific XML applications can tie their particular link elements to XML link elements.  </s>
<s> I believe this message comes from before Steve Pepper's LINKTYPE proposal was added as #5:  </s>
<s> We almost all agree that the best long-term solution is to allow multiple ATTLIST decls, so a document can start !DOCTYPE tei.2 public "-//TEI//DTD P3//EN" [ !ATTLIST xref xml-link CDATA #fixed "xml-tlink" ] This documents that the tei element xref is a tlink in XML terms.  </s>
<s> We think we can have multiple attlists when the TC passes.  </s>
<s> It's not clear what to do in the meantime.  </s>
<s> Choices include: 1 Play it Safe... 2 Count on Utopian ATTLISTs... 3 Stopgap PI... 4 GI escape hatch...  </s>
<s> so we add 5 LINKTYPE which is 100% SGML compatible and available now.  </s>
<s> You said:  </s>
<s> I'm not sure where this declaration comes from, but I don't understand it out of context.  </s>
<s> I believe the purpose of discussion is to locate the best solution, and apart from political arguments that I don't agree with, discussion of LINK as a possible solution seems within bounds.  </s>
<s> So where are we? 1. Play it safe...  </s>
<s> I don't know what Steve is meaning here, but I'm assuming nothing.  </s>
<s> If I did assume he meant a fixed attribute like XML-LINK, fine.  </s>
<s> I have no problem with that solution at all.  </s>
<s> I don't think that as an option is bad at all, but I want something better, something with indirection so that the GI can be mapped in the prologue rather than the instance.  </s>
<s> 2. Utopian ATTLISTs I imagine that multiple ATTLISTs will pass in the TC, but I find the fervent pointing to that as a solution just as fanatical as myself believing LINK is viable.  </s>
<s> They are not the same solution, and there are advantages of LINK over multiple ATTLISTs: for one, context sensitivity.  </s>
<s> I believe "design elegance" also applies here.  </s>
<s> From a purely human-readable context, if I want to point to a generalized mechanism for 1) transforming HTML to ICADD or 2) providing linkage between an XML application and XML-LINK, I can point to an LPD that is somewhat self-contained, and from appearance is a pretty good mapping between the set of GIs and attributes and what will happen to them in the transformation process.  </s>
<s> By contrast, the ATTLIST document is simply an addendum to an existing DTD, so one must have the DTD, and sit down and figure out (given all sorts of parameter entity indirection that shows up in many DTDs) where the ATTLISTs will be applied and in what context.  </s>
<s> By contrast, the context is set in the LPD so it's easier to see.  </s>
<s> For simple ATTLISTs, this is obviously not a problem.  </s>
<s> 3. Stopgap PI... Ugly at best, and requires authors to do precisely what many of us detest: add processing-specific material to our documents.  </s>
<s> 4. GI escape hatch...  </s>
<s> This is not much of a solution for XML versions of existing DTDs, nor for those who don't want their markup in strict XML GIs. and finally, 5. Steve Pepper's idea [Date: Fri, 21 Feb 1997 12:43:16 +0100] of specifying a restricted subset of SGML implicit links is fine by me -- this is probably obvious to those I've discussed this with before.  </s>
<s> His restrictions reduce the implementation burden substantially, especially when considering that the alternatives are either multiple ATTLISTs (not yet allowed, not guaranteed to be allowed, more difficult to human-read without a DTD for context, and no context-sensitivity) or a DSSSL transformation engine.  </s>
<s> Just in terms of complexity and footprint, I can't imagine requiring a DSSSL engine merely to use XML-LINK.  </s>
<s> My only change would be:  </s>
<s> 1. Only one link type declaration is allowed.  </s>
<s> It must be called "xml-link" and it is by definition an "active" link type for an XML application.  </s>
<s> For purposes of ICADD transformation, this restriction would disallow transformation via LPD of any XML instance that already was using an LPD for link indirection.  </s>
<s> The restriction could be 'only one link type declaration of the same link type', so two LINKTYPEs would still be disallowed.  </s>
<s> Removing all the 'unnecessary' stuff from SGML is what XML is all about.  </s>
<s> Removing the unnecessary stuff from LINK might warrant its inclusion in XML, and I believe provide a much simpler method than a DSSSL engine for certain processes.  </s>
