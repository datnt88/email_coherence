<s> Work statement [1]: focused mainly on membership requirements for our task force.  </s>
<s> People need to be members in good standing of the larger WCAG group but can focus their time commitment to techniques, or split their time.  </s>
<s> The membership requirements seem to have been unilaterally upgraded overnight to read as follows: Participation Task Force participants must be participants in good standing of the WCAG WG, should have experience with a Web technology (such as HTML, CSS, or SVG), and must actively contribute to the work of the Task Force, including: * minimum 2 hours per week of Task Force work * remain current on the mailing list and respond in a timely manner to postings on mailing list * participate in Task Force telephone meetings, or send regrets to the list * assist in preparing Task Force deliverables for discussion Essentially, even to work on HTML techniques now requires one to be PiGS (participant in good standing).  </s>

<s> That was not the case before.  </s>
<s> 2. Is that really and truly what the World Wide Web Consortium wishes to insist on now?  </s>
<s> Answer question 2 very carefully indeed.  </s>
<s> The Web Accessibility Initiative stands to permanently alienate contributors if it actually puts the proposal into practice.  </s>
<s> Perhaps I should add a third question: 3. Is that the result WAI actually intends?  </s>
<s> Public responses, to the list, *only*, please.  </s>

<s> Joe, Please note that this [1] is a draft, it is not final and we are still discussing it.  </s>
<s> I have clarified this by adding the following disclaimer to the beginning of the document: "This is a draft.  </s>
<s> This has not been approved by the WCAG WG and is not operative.  </s>
<s> It is for discussion purposes only.  </s>
<s> Please send comments to w3c-wai-gl@w3.org."  </s>
<s> At Wednesday's meeting we discussed that if someone had to attend both the techniques task force telecon *and* the WCAG WG telecon *and* keep up on the mailing list, the minimum 4 hours of time expected to contribute (per our charter) would be eaten up without doing any real work.  </s>
<s> Therefore, it seems to make sense that a person could participate in either the task force telecons or the WCAG WG telecons to be considered a participant in good standing.  </s>
<s> However, we want to make sure that we are not running two separate groups.  </s>
<s> The task force is not publishing its own documents, it is working on documents for the WCAG WG. Keeping the two groups in synch is key and overlapping participation helps.  </s>
<s> Our policies will not change overnight or without warning.  </s>
<s> This is a draft that was produced for discussion.  </s>
<s> This is part of the transition to adopting our new charter and the new process document and, in the near future, adopting the new patent policy.  </s>
<s> As part of this transition, other aspects of our work will be discussed, better documented and revised.  </s>

<s> The Web Accessibility Initiative remains unable to see that: 1. the PiGS designation (participant in good standing) is inherently elitist and filters out anyone who cannot afford the time or money for up to 150 hours a year of long-distance telephone consultations and face-to-face meetings.  </s>

<s> 2. an effort to impose PiGS requirements now is a convenient yet suspicious method to limit participation in WCAG WG or Techniques WG or any other working group.  </s>
<s> It is inherently contrary to the aims of the Initiative, since it ensures that nobody but sinecurists with day jobs-- who are the existing WAI politburo anyway-- will ever be allowed to contribute.  </s>

<s> I am telling you up front, as I have explained already, that such a requirement *is the problen*.  </s>
<s> 4. WAI is acting as though there is something resembling agreement to impose this requirement.  </s>

<s> The existing WAI politburo, who are all WAI staff or PiGS anyway, obviously will like the idea, because it doesn't affect them except inasmuch as it solidifies the class structure of the Initiative.  </s>
<s> A requirement for PiGS status keeps the riffraff out.  </s>
<s> And if you think I'm worried only about myself, wait till I count up all the participants on the GL list who would be excluded by this requirement.  </s>

<s> Hey Joe, I don't think so.  </s>
<s> W3C is a consortium with a set of rules ("The Process Document") designed to ensure that the massive variety of stakeholders get some kind of accountability, whether or not they are actual members of the Consortium.  </s>
<s> (This could be contrasted to many similar organisations with similar impact that are not prepared to make themselves so open).  </s>
<s> You can check these - they are published at  </s>
<s> The participants in good standing stuff has been in the rules since WAI began, and in every charter.  </s>
<s> If you join the group you are required to state that you read the charter - it's about a page and a half.  </s>
<s> Some minimal attention to what you are involved in might have been helpful to ensure this didn't come as such a surprise.  </s>
<s> In other words, to join the group you did explicitly agree to this already.  </s>
<s> WAI seems to be very aware of the difficulty of participation and remaining in good standing.  </s>
<s> The rules require attending teleconferences or sending regrets, and being up to date on the mailing list.  </s>
<s> When I have been in good standing it has generally been through following the mailing list, and sending timely regrets.  </s>
<s> It isn't that hard to participate, and even if you aren't a member of the group you can send comments, knowing that the working group is required by "the Process" to address them.  </s>
<s> And whatever the rules, WAI seems often to work hard to ensure that people can contribute valuable information.  </s>
<s> They are certainly not perfect at it, but they strike me as being as good as the available alternatives...  </s>
<s> I share your concern about the narrow range of people who are in a position to contribute regularly.  </s>
<s> Representing an organisation where the primary language is spanish (the other 4 are Portuguese, Gallego, Catalan and Euskera/Basque) and where many people are not in a position to follow the work because of a language barrier, I understand the problems that the world faces in giving its input to WAI.  </s>
<s> But I think in this case you're "going off half-cocked", and that a single positive suggestion based on the facts would be more useful to those of us trying to deal with WAI from the outside who don't have a sinecured North American position... "Throw out the plan" isn't a suggestion.  </s>
<s> There isn't "a plan", the status quo that you seem so happy about makes certain requirements of participants, and the thing that got you so excited is a reminder of those.  </s>
<s> It seems to suggest ways to reduce the commitment to the bare minimum for effective participation.  </s>
<s> So if the system works now, you seem to be making much ado about nothing.  </s>

<s> etc, etc. Hi Charles, I have no problem with this process and support it as probably the only way to get things done, but there does seem to need to be some other way or avenue for people to be involved.  </s>
<s> But also, what you say about reading the mailing list and sending timely regrets as remaining in good standing is only born out when you render that interpretation of the charter.  </s>
<s> From what I see, it is only those who do this and participate in regular teleconferences that remain in good standing, and I don't really have a problem with that.  </s>
<s> Even you, with all your past participation and involvement have been taken off the PIGS list.  </s>
<s> I am also in this situation with ATAG.  </s>
<s> I am passionate about the issues there, because like Joe, I believe a better document / recommendation will be more readily understood, accepted and adopted by the web community as a whole.  </s>
<s> But I have just had to agree to it's charter to be a part of that working group.  </s>
<s> I have two voices in my head (yes, I am mad), one saying; "For Sanity's sake Geoff, you are committing yourself beyond all your resources", the other saying; "You have to do this to save mankind:-)"... well not quite.. as a sit at my computer with cape and mask.  </s>
<s> I hope you get the drift, it's not easy for some of us to balance these commitments, it seems to me that a lot of the people in this area have part of their paying job description / time allocation to W3C activities, let alone the international phone calls and international face to faces.  </s>
<s> I'm not asking the charter to be changed or amended as such, just to look at something to be done for those who sincerely and passionately want to contribute and be involved in the discussion and forging of the recommendations.  </s>
<s> I don't know how, just that I don't want to see the charter restrict valuable contributions.  </s>
<s> If it can be determined that the person is at least genuinely trying to contribute to the degree they can most facilitate, maybe that is acceptable.  </s>
<s> I do notice however that WAI is one of the few W3C groups that is so open to individual participation (at least I think so).  </s>
<s> ... I'll be away for a bit over a week... Internet free zone.  </s>
<s> Geoff  </s>
<s> I want to attempt to clarify what exactly the consensus process is, why it exists, and why it's a good thing.  </s>
<s> As you read this, note that I am a W3C/WAI employee, but have no special status in the working group, and am merely trying to get us back to the tasks at hand.  </s>
<s> Nobody is held back from participating in this working group, full stop.  </s>
<s> Not participants who don't happen to be in good standing, not people who aren't on the list, nobody.  </s>
<s> The WCAG WG is probably the most open working group in the consortium, and I say this having been an invited expert myself long before joining W3C.  </s>
<s> The discussion here on good standing seems to be taking the angle that good standing is some way to keep people out of the process.  </s>
<s> In actuality, it is a way of drawing interested parties in.  </s>
<s> After clearing the invited-expert hurdle, anyone, irrespective of organizational affiliation, can become a participant in good standing.  </s>
<s> The concept of "good standing" in the consensus process helps prevent less-interested parties from scuttling the work of the group.  </s>
<s> A scenario: individuals A through W get together to solve a problem, and are about to arrive at an agreement.  </s>
<s> Each individual in this group under the consensus process has the right to stop the group and require their issues to be addressed.  </s>
<s> Individual X has just joined the group.  </s>
<s> Not knowing how a certain decision was arrived at, or having contributed to the process to date, X does not have the right to block consensus.  </s>
<s> However, if X provides value to the group and becomes knowledgeable about the topic, the consensus process then establishes X's right to cause issues to be resolved.  </s>
<s> Individual Y once joined the group, has rarely appeared or interacted with the group, but appears for the call for consensus.  </s>
<s> Y's issues may already have been resolved.  </s>
<s> Y may not be aware of the current state of work.  </s>
<s> Or worse, Y may be trying intentionally to destroy the work created to date.  </s>
<s> For these reasons, Y is considered by process not to be able to block consensus.  </s>
<s> "Good standing" in the consensus process is designed to keep people actively involved in work that benefits the group, and giving each participant the power to effect change where it most matters to her or him.  </s>
<s> That power has to come with some kind of check, and for the W3C that is in the form of regular attendance and participation.  </s>
<s> (There are other means of breaking a move to block something, but they are designed for situations where a compromise cannot be reached, and the Director ensures that there is otherwise a genuine consensus among the group.)  </s>
<s> So, who are you if you bear the unfortunate moniker of "bad standing"?  </s>
<s> You're the same as anyone else, at least in the WCAG WG.  </s>
<s> You can join the conference calls, attend the face-to-face meetings, read and post to the mailing list.  </s>
<s> The only thing you don't get to do, under the consensus process on which W3C is based, is stop the train.  </s>
<s> We seek consensus from not only the working group, but the approval of the other working groups in the WAI domain, then proof that the document is viable in the wild (Candidate Recommendation), then the consensus of the W3C membership (Proposed Recommendation), and _then_ the approval of the Director of W3C before the document becomes an official Recommendation.  </s>
<s> We do not blithely ignore the world around us in this process.  </s>
<s> Wendy regularly receives reviews and new issues from outside the working group, brings those issues to the working group, and proposes changes to the document based on outside comments.  </s>
<s> And people in the working group who are not "in good standing" have their issues addressed with no discrimination as to their standing.  </s>
<s> So, then.  </s>
<s> That's consensus in a nutshell.  </s>
<s> I'm hoping people are now asking, what can I do to get my issues addressed?  </s>
<s> (Please tell me you're asking this.  </s>
<s> Seriously.  </s>
<s> I'm not even supposed to be here today.  </s>
<s> I'm on jury duty, and I'm writing this at night while my wife is watching the 14-hour Two Towers edition.) First, go to the meetings, if you can.  </s>
<s> W3C puts a high priority on active participation, and regular teleconferences are to date the most effective means for pushing things forward.  </s>
<s> That's why it's (almost) a requirement for participation in good standing.  </s>
<s> It is very important to the process, in that we can ask whether a given item has consensus and have a near-immediate answer.  </s>
<s> For the techniques task force, it's  </s>
<s> important to keep coordinated on what everyone is doing.  </s>
<s> It is also helpful to attend because whether or not the group thought something was a good idea or not often doesn't come through well in meeting minutes.  </s>
<s> Even if you cannot go to the meetings, read the drafts and comment on them regularly.  </s>
<s> Send emails to the w3c-wai-gl and/or public-comments-wcag20@w3.org lists, pointing out the draft you're commenting on, the problem you have with it, and if at all possible, potential solutions.  </s>
<s> If you have expertise in a given area, take an  </s>
<s> action item to solve the issues you know how to deal with.  </s>
<s> If you take an action item, produce a deliverable, or tell the chairs or staff contact that you can't.  </s>
<s> Read what consensus means to the W3C, and how issues are addressed[1].  </s>
<s> Note that the WCAG 2.0 draft points to an issue-tracking list[2] which contains hundreds of open issues with the document.  </s>
<s> Make sure you are suggesting something new, and if not, add your comments to any existing bugs against the document.  </s>
<s> Raise issues clearly.  </s>
<s> Start a new thread.  </s>
<s> State the problem you see with the document, citing examples if possible, and what you think would resolve things.  </s>
<s> Raising a concern in one sentence halfway down a message on an unrelated thread is not likely to result in the group's immediate consideration.  </s>
