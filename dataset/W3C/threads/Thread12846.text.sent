EOWG: For discussion at our 2 May 2003 meeting, updated draft of Building the Case for Web Accessibility: Legal and Policy Factors Relevant changelog sections: Regards, - Judy Judy Brewer +1.617.258.9741 http://www.w3.org/WAI Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI), World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) EOWG Home: http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO Somehow this email was dated 1 May about a 2 May meeting and I got it on 3 May! 
Really felt weird! 
The "questions" section really sticks out now and I hope that's what was intended because it's what I've been dreaming of for us/it. 
I think this bulleting/highlighting (I hope that in the previous meeting the talk on "over-bulletizing" wasn't intended to avoid this sort of emphasis) would be of benefit within a great many of our documents, which often appear a bit too much like doctoral dissertations rather than WEB documents. 
I guess I hold rather strongly with Jakob Nielsen's urgings as expressed in "how do people read on the Web?" with "They don't". 
Love. 
It's Bad Luck to be Superstitious! 
There was a temporary delay on server processing of mail for this mailing list. 
It seemed to affect different messages unevenly. 
You may notice additional delayed delivery of a few messages, but hopefully the queue is caught up by now.
