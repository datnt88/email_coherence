<s> I use Amaya 5.2 from Linux.  </s>
<s> I like this browser/editor very much.  </s>
<s> It helps in writing good html (compared e.g. with Netscape Composer, ...) I have there full control about the generated source.  </s>
<s> But there is a -little - problem.  </s>
<s> If I look at an html-file with view-source, I see all the markups ... But german ?, ?, ?  </s>
<s> are shown as such and not as &amp;auml; ... If I look at this file with emacs all is ok. Kind regards Dr. V. Risak veith.risak@chello.at risak@ocg.at  </s>

<s> But the strange thing is: - I wrote the special characters ?, ?, ?, ... in the window source view as &amp;auml; &amp;ouml; ... than stored them.  </s>
<s> (Check with emacs gave: codes ok) Than exited Amaya Reopened Amaya and reloaded document.  </s>
<s> ???  </s>
<s> But then the codes were gone and only ?, ?, ?  </s>
<s> appeared.  </s>
<s> Ok, now this is clear.  </s>
<s> My personal opinion is that Amaya automagically translates entities in ISO-Latin-1 characters.  </s>
<s> From its point of view, it makes sense: as you know, the standard says that HTML has ISO-8859-1 as its default coding, and XML is even more liberal.  </s>
<s> If Amaya adds the charset at the beginning of the file, there is no problem for interoperability, and using ?, ?, ?  </s>
<s> improves readability of the text.  </s>
<s> guess! tschuess, .mau.  </s>
<s> Good guess, Mauricio.  </s>
<s> That's exactly what happens, and that's exactly the rationale.  </s>

<s> Yes. If the document was exported with the charset us-ascii these characters would be exported as entities.  </s>
