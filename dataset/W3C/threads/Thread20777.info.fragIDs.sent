[Hi it doesn't look like spam. 
And it certainly looks like I'm unable to give the guy any proper reply.] 
I use Amaya 5.2 from Linux. 
I like this browser/editor very much. 
It helps in writing good html (compared e.g. with Netscape Composer, ...) I have there full control about the generated source. 
But there is a -little - problem. 
If I look at an html-file with view-source, I see all the markups ... But german ?, ?, ? 
are shown as such and not as &amp;auml; ... If I look at this file with emacs all is ok. Kind regards Dr. V. Risak veith.risak@chello.at risak@ocg.at

But the strange thing is: - I wrote the special characters ?, ?, ?, ... in the window source view as &amp;auml; &amp;ouml; ... than stored them. 
(Check with emacs gave: codes ok) Than exited Amaya Reopened Amaya and reloaded document. 
??? 
But then the codes were gone and only ?, ?, ? 
appeared. 
Ok, now this is clear. 
My personal opinion is that Amaya automagically translates entities in ISO-Latin-1 characters. 
From its point of view, it makes sense: as you know, the standard says that HTML has ISO-8859-1 as its default coding, and XML is even more liberal. 
If Amaya adds the charset at the beginning of the file, there is no problem for interoperability, and using ?, ?, ? 
improves readability of the text. 
guess! tschuess, .mau. 
Good guess, Mauricio. 
That's exactly what happens, and that's exactly the rationale.

Yes. If the document was exported with the charset us-ascii these characters would be exported as entities.
