Hi, I'm just finishing up a project where we checked web page accessibility for blind users by phone. 
Basically, each blind subject was on a conference call with the testers. 
There were a couple of benefits to this approach. 
It reduced the amount of set up time because the blind subject was able to work with his/her standard accessibility configuration. 
Another benefit was that it significantly reduced testing costs like travel while increasing the number of testers. 
I've been asked to take our notes and produce a document describing the approach taken so it can be used in some other projects. 
I was thinking it might be good to include any testing approaches that other people may have taken. 
So far the only significant description of testing web pages by blind subjects seems to be the one written by the Norman-Nielsen group. 
If you know of any other or have your own approach, I would very much appreciate hearing about them. 
Thanks, Scott Hi, Well, other blind people think that time can be an issue for accessibility. 
(I also suspect they probably think they are right just like other blind people believe they are right.) Scott accessibility means that it is available and can be used. 
time is not a deciding factor in this. 
Other factors as has been indicated on this thread address the time issue. 
I agree with Scott - how much longer something takes because of a disability-related scenario is an accessibility issue. 
This is where accessibility and usability can be seen to be on the same continuum.
