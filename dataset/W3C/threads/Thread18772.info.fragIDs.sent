Hi Al, I would suggest we work from either a functional viewpoint or from a preferences viewpoint and not from a disability etiology. 
That is that the client say "cannot view graphics" or "prefer that you send text only" or "prefer that you send - text only - or voice enabled applets and not that the client send "blind" or "low vision" the former has much more application beyond disability - and will extend to hand held and nomadic devices. 
The latter doesn't really help much anyway since people who are blind can have very different skills and different browser / reader capabilities. 
I'll be short - but if what I'm saying isn't clear. 
Drop me a line.

For a list of our listserves send "lists" to listproc@trace.wisc.edu 
Recently there was a rough consensus on the list in favor of special-need descriptors being sent from client to server as part of format negotiation. 
I think that we should make "the taxonomy of abilities and special needs" that these message attributes employ a development item, and that we should try to rope the doctors mentioned below into this task. 
Paul has contributed on this point on the dev-access mailing list. 
Al Gilman ----- Forwarded message from P. Coelco ----- Al, Sure. 
Thank you for considering me. 
Dennis Anson may also be interested (dennis@u.washington.edu).

Paul, In the Web Access Initiative the idea has come up for some special-need identifiers that would be useful in characterizing how web sites should serve this particular client. 
This is an issue where I think you have something to contribute based on your posts to dev-access. 
May I mention your name to the Intiative people as someone they should talk to to help them set up their working reference taxonomy of abilities and special needs?

Hi Paul, Maybe the problem is differentiating between what needs to be done on the source side - and what needs to be done on the viewer/player/browser side. 
And then realizing that although w3c has most influence in the source and pipeline areas, the WAI has also discussed working on browser and viewer guidelines. 
So all disabilities would be in the scope of the work. 
And - with applets - we have a situation where the viewer / player software is often downloaded from the source - thus making things even more interesting - and increasing the need to look at all disabilities even on the source side.

Hello Daniel, Thank you for your recent messages. 
I am sorry for my slowness to respond. 
In Greg's recent e-mail to both of us he makes a point that for the nonblind or nonhearing disabled population it is the browser and hardware which need modification rather than the source code (html, xml, css,etc). 
This strikes me as true. 
Most of the disabilities that I see are motor or cognitive imparements, sometimes involving partial or temporary loss of one of the senses, ie vision, touch, etc. 
Consequently, with respect to your questions about how the W3C can modify css, xml, html, etc to suit the disabled as a whole- rather than subpopulations of disable- the answer may be that you can not. 
I guess what I am most unclear about is what the scope of the WAI is. 
I've been to WAI site and read the data there, including the following from Tim Berners-Lee: "Worldwide, there are more than 750 million people with disabilities. 
As we move towards a highly connected world, it is critical that the Web be usable by anyone, regardless of individual capabilities and disabilities," said Tim Berners-Lee, Director of the W3C and inventor of the World Wide Web. 
"The W3C is committed to removing accessibility barriers for all people with disabilities - including the deaf, blind, physically challenged, and cognitive or visually impaired. 
We plan to work aggressively with government, industry, and community leaders to establish and attain Web accessibility goals." 
And this from the President of the United States: "I commend the World Wide Web Consortium, industry sponsors, and the Yuri Rubinski Foundation for launching this important project. 
I am pleased that the Department of Education will provide funding for the Web Accessibility Initiative, and that the National Science Foundation is considering expanding its support for research and development in this area. 
My administration is committed to working with these and other organizations to ensure that this innovative project is a success." 
This language suggests that the efforts made will benefit all of the disabled. 
But as I have mentioned, I do not see how this will be accomplished with the current focus on vision impairments. 
Most of the disabled people I see have either motor or cognitive obstacles to accessing the web. 
(It goes without saying that they all have financial obstacles.) 
It would be helpful to me if you could point me toward literature which better defines what the scope of the WAI will be. 
On the topic of the disabled mailing lists: As you know, a recent topic on dev-access was the "taxonomy of disablity". 
What seems to have prompted this dialog was the list subscribers efforts to define the term accessible. 
This is where I became interested,because- having followed the dialog and read the subscribers introductions - there is a clear bias in terms of advocacy for the blind user on this list. 
Thus, I felt that the definition of access coined by this group- the dev-access list subscribers- would reflect their bias and thus be inconsistent with one of the stated goals of the WAI "... removing accessability barriers for all people with disabilities..." Thank you for your concern. 
If the topics of taxonomy or accessablity arise I would be interested in participating in the dialog.

Greg, That sounds like a good approach. 
Efforts on the client side- browser/desktop/viewer/player- might be more fruitful in terms of extending web access into the realm of the motor disabled (my patients). 
On an interesting aside: I happen to be at an institution which has adopted thin-clients (NCD's). 
It seems to me that this type of hardware, while apparently cheap to own and operate, is going to be very difficult to make accessable.
