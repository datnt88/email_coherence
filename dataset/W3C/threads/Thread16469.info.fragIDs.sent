<s> Subject: RE: images / alt and image maps Hi Rebecca, You asked for opinons - OK! Redundant text links should be available for server-side image maps; no reason for redundant links for client-side maps - You must use alt text for each of the areas.  </s>
<s> 7.4.2 is preceeded with "until user agents ...." and user agents are recognizing alt text on areas.  </s>
<s> I think it is wrong to also have text links when you have alt text on the areas ... Opinion.  </s>
<s> An example I used in the "web course" (http://jimthatcher.com/webcourse2.htm) for me raises a very interesting issue about image maps.  </s>
<s> The King County Washington site (http://www.metrokc.gov/)  </s>
<s> uses a sever-side map for its primary navigation and has equivalent text links at the bottom of the page.  </s>
<s> Section 508 would not allow this because the regions (lik all regions) can be specified in a client-side map.  </s>
<s> But using this server-side map with equivalent links at the bottom of the page provides a skip navigation method.  </s>
<s> A dilemma! Jim  </s>
<s> According to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, the things you have described are server side image maps.  </s>
<s> (The definition of image maps at functional, not code based.) In actual fact for most maps it is not terribly hard to have a client-side map in principle, using vector-based technology.  </s>
<s> Roadmaps are in essence vector diagrams.  </s>
<s> But there are certainly some kinds of image maps where the most appropriate non-visual interface is different - perhaps form-based, or text links.  </s>
<s> And as Jim points out, reducing the navigation overload is helpful.  </s>
