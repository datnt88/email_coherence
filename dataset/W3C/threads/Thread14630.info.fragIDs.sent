<s> Kynn (et al.), I am quite relieved that I am not in out-and-out disagreement with you here!  </s>
<s> Your list (a) - (e) is very good, but I do want to qualify a few things for anyone following this thread.  </s>
<s> (b) Good ALT text is quite sufficient (i.e., better than "generally  </s>
<s> considered") to remove the barrier to access for people who are blind (and using a screen reader with synthesized speech or dynamic Braille display).  </s>
<s> (c) Good ALT text lessens the barrier to access for many people with low vision, but they will still find it difficult to access information in the document.  </s>
<s> Somewhere between (c) and (d) is the user interface.  </s>
<s> People with low vision have the day-today experience and extremely reasonable expectation and that textual elements are scaleable.  </s>
<s> They are use to one or more of the following techniques: (1) getting a bigger monitor, (2) having the OS default to a high contrast / large font size scheme, (3) setting an acceptable default font (and colors) within their browser, (4) choosing the "larger" setting from within their browser, and (5) using a customized style sheet to format.  </s>
<s> Graphical text, of course, defeats ALL of these common accommodation strategies.  </s>
<s> (d) There are other work-around (for the bad pages that include graphical text) in addition to disabling images.  </s>
<s> Mouse-over pop-ups is sufficient for some folks with low vision for example.  </s>
<s> (Others will not benefit from this technique.) Screen magnification (even of graphical text) is adequate for  </s>
<s> _some_ for most of the pages they encounter.  </s>
<s> Alternative browsers are used by some as an accommodation.  </s>
<s> I am not aware of any studies, but I would guess that the technique of disabling images is, for most people with low vision, a "cure" that is not worth the cost.  </s>
<s> (Just as the "cure" of using screen magnification is often declined.) Somewhere between (d) and (e) the point needs to be made that the existence of these work-arounds and alternatives do NOT totally eliminate the barrier caused by textual graphics.  </s>
<s> That's why this is a P2 issue and not P1 or P3.  </s>
<s> The use of the terms "satisfactory" or "sufficient" can be quite subjective.  </s>
<s> (e) I don't agree that your final point is the "clear solution", although it might be a fair long term approach.  </s>
<s> I would suggest that a more reasonable conclusion is that content providers should use CSS when they want to put text on a graphic!  </s>
<s> SVG is likely to be well supported (and therefore a good choice) long before we have some other (and completely new) way to differentiate text-heavy images from other graphics.  </s>
<s> I agree that _right now_ SVG is not much of a solution, but that will change (hopefully, rather quickly).  </s>
<s> [I was quite disappointed to find that an SVG viewer was NOT incorporated into Navigator 6.] With regard to your other message on this immediate sub-thread, I agree that permutations of: are pretty terrible because of the redundant rendering of "next".  </s>
<s> Len's example endorses your CSS / ALT technique suggestion: img class="buttonimg" src="twirl.gif"  </s>
<s> alt="" width="75" height="50" border="0" /a I would guess that Q border="0" /Q is there to accommodate the non-conformant behavior of browsers.  </s>
<s> (This could be another argument for transitional doctype on Double-A pages.) Anne (and perhaps others) won't like it, but I still think that: a href="page02.html"  </s>
<s> title="Page two of three."  </s>
<s> img src="rarrow.gif"  </s>
<s> alt="Next!" /a is the way to go (unless one is specially setting up a web page to simulate an aug.  </s>
<s> com.  </s>
<s> board).  </s>
<s> If an icon image is so weak (or subject to interpretation) that it requires text to illustrate its function -- then either drop the image (and just use the text) or improve the graphic!  </s>
<s> Unless, of course (and as the case with Anne) the purpose of the page is to teach literacy skills.  </s>

<s> (b) Alt text is generally considered sufficient to remove the barrier to access for people who can't see an image.  </s>
<s> (c) Using the alt text for those images -would- be sufficient to allow access, BUT: (d) To access the alt text, the user needs to disable ALL images on a page, which is less than optimal for web users who need to magnify text but who can otherwise see graphics.  </s>
<s> (e) The clear solution is that there needs to be a way to designate certain images as being those that should be -replaced- if resized, while others as not being replaced.  </s>
<s> There does not seem to be a way to do this in HTML or CSS at present.  </s>
<s> This whole argument is basically caused by a huge gaping hole in the markup languages used to create web pages.  </s>
<s> So, if we were going to reinvent HTML, how would we solve the problem?  </s>
<s> Perhaps an attribute related to resizing, which would then be recognized by browsers?  </s>
<s> Maybe a CSS property?  </s>
<s> Something else?  </s>
<s> I'm not sure what the solution is, but I think there may be a way to overcome this problem.  </s>
<s> (Using SVG is not, right now, a solution...)  </s>
<s> Bruce, You may have a point ...  </s>
<s> I'm not sure where the idea of an arrow in the right and left corners to indicate next one and back one originated, but it may be a computer "thing" ... it allows the user control of the timing, but the arrows are not intuitive symbols, nor is "a" graphic in the corners.  </s>
<s> Non-readers see the text "next" as a rectangular blob ... But as William points out, whatever graphic or word we use, the use of it to mean "the page that follows this in the series" will have to be learned ... We've got a start on the bottom left and right corner, and arrows are the most commonly used graphic... but until they are learned, the text needs to be there to make the graphic "accessible" to the maximum number of people ... Consider, if the word isn't on the graphic, low vision people who need the text with the graphic (cuss the fact that they need a crutch, but give it to 'em), wouldn't have the text there, and they'll be in the same boat as those who use the web without magnification and need the text ... doen't magnification users get the mouseover pop-up?  </s>
<s> By banning the text on the graphic, you are handicapping more people than you are "accommodating" ... and the "accommodation" doesn't give anything more to those who can't see the text on the graphic at their magnification level, they are still in the dark as much as everyone else ...

<s> The use of "style sheets" at all is more of a leap for many authors than is the move to a particular implementation thereof.  </s>
<s> Just the concept of having a "presentation descriptor" is something many blindless people have trouble with because of such prejudices as "seeing is believing" or "it's right there in front of your eyes".  </s>
<s> Many of us just don't understand that there is an underlying "what" that's somehow being re-presented.  </s>
<s> We have for so long mistaken the medium for the message that it's a hard severance to expect compliance with, as is evident from the long-raging exchanges herein.  </s>
<s> CSS is sort of the "last best hope" for getting this done and my "bullishness" on it is based mainly on the business case arguments for its use.  </s>
<s> It is so clearly more efficient (once the initial bigotry towards it is overcome) that it will be as "second-nature" of a thing for Web designers (as it sort of already has been in print, where the word "style" is frequently understood in the sense it is used in CSS) as it was for the designers of SGML.  </s>

<s> How long has PNG been a solid standard?  </s>
<s> It's obviously superior to both GIF and JPEG for most applications.  </s>
<s> But due to the inertia of browser makers and the market at large, even while most graphics tools support most of PNG, it's a dormant technology.  </s>
<s> CSS has been here for several years now, and there still isn't sufficient talent out there using it as anything more than a cool layout widget to be able to point it out as a serious accessibility tool.  </s>
<s> It's seen by designers as a way to change this color or remove the underline from links, not as the ultimate vision of the W3C.  </s>
<s> While I'm sure it's not the job of this working group to second-guess the larger organization's published opinions, I still think it's premature to say CSS Is The Way (or worse, CSS Is The Only Way) to do certain things.  </s>
<s> I think the gap between specification and widespread adoption is a lot longer than a year.  </s>
<s> In the case of CSS, I think it's at least another 18 months, taking into account IE4's level of support has been around since September of 1997; with SVG, closer to 36 months to 90% user agent penetration and full tool compliance (and no less than 5 years to the utopia in which they're used the way W3C expects) is my bet.  </s>
<s> There are tools available for CSS, but many of them are probably not robust enough to support accurate, cross-platform, cross-browser representations.  </s>
<s> And to derive the ultimate benefit, that requirement excludes a number of still serviceable user agents.  </s>
<s> SVG doesn't even have that: no installed base, no widespread commercial tools, and none of the real-world experience WCAG has used to base its own guidelines/techniques/checkpoints upon.  </s>
<s> It's that experience that is the bread and butter of the checkpoints.  </s>
<s> Until that base of knowledge is there, I think a strategy of pushing it before it's supported really helps anyone.  </s>

<s> I presume your "Until that base of knowledge is there, I think a strategy of pushing it before it's supported really helps anyone." was a "grammar typo" and that you meant it "doesn't help anyone".  </s>

<s> Per one of my action items from last meeting... There's some examples of three images images in a row, with real text labels underneath each, at It may look visually like text is part of the image but actually it uses separate, real text.  </s>
<s> These examples: 1. Show that images can be placed in a row, with real textlabels underneath, validate to HTML 4.01, and still have a good reading order (at least when the browser linearizes tables) (It will also work on old browsers that simple ignore links with null alt text).  </s>
<s> 2. Underline that the issue is not the merit of having a textual description next or visually part of an image.  </s>
<s> I think we all agree such labels are valuable.  </s>
<s> The issue is only whether this visual appearance can be implemented acceptably without actually making the text part of the image.  </s>
