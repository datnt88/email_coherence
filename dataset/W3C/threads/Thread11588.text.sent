Hi Ian, We have now completed the Danish translation of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0. 
The translated copy is located at translation reviewed, and may make slight changes to the document over the next week or so. 
Kind regards, Lars Lars Ballieu Christensen, Consultant Sensus ApS, Godth?bsvej 18, DK-3400 Hiller?d, Denmark Thank you Lars! I'll add the link to the list of translations and look forward to hearing news of the review. 
Thank you for your efforts. 
I'll have some Danish friends take a look! - Ian Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org) http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs Cell: +1 917 450-8783 Hi, I'd like to translate the XHTML1.0 Prop. 
Recommendation into Spanish, but since its review period has finished I don't know if it would be better to wait until the status of the document changes. 
?Any suggestions?

I would recommend waiting until XHTML 1.0 becomes a Recommendation, perhaps in two or three months time. 
Regards, -- Dave Raggett dsr@w3.org 
http://www.w3.org/People/Raggett World Wide Web Consortium (on assignment from HP Labs) Thanks Dave, I'll translate the Prop. 
Rec. 
just for internal use, to get familiar with the document and the terminology in Spanish (Jorge Lozano from Instituto Cervantes has offered his help and will give a look to the translation) and to make the document accesible to my workgroup colleagues at Grupo CP webteam. 
When XHTML 1.0 becomes a Recommendation it will be easier to make a good translation.
