<s> (Ted)  </s>
<s> The mandatory draft presumes that the mandatory header will be processed before any of the two digit headers it names; that should be made *really* clear in the draft, as it is a big change.  </s>
<s> (Henrik) Why is this?  </s>
<s> The recipient can still parse the headers without knowing their semantics.  </s>
<s> This is exactly the same as for any other unknown header fields.  </s>
<s> Whether the mandatory (or optional) header fields are passed before  </s>
<s> or afterwards doesn't change this.  </s>
<s> If you feel that this should be an issue on the issues list then please let me know.  </s>
<s> (Ted,again) I feel this should be an issue on the issues list.  </s>
<s> Imagine that a current end-user system gets a header like: 98-BetaStatus: Release Azure With the current theory of unordered headers, the end-user system knows right away whether it needs to process the message differently in the presence of this header.  </s>
<s> Under mandatory, header prefixes are generated on the fly, so it wont know if 98- corresponds to some extension which it supports until it processes the Mandatory header.  </s>
<s> This means that Mandatory headers must be processed before any of the two digit headers.  </s>
<s> This implies that processing of Mandatory headers isn't unordered, which seems like a big enough change to me that it should be made very explicit in the draft.  </s>
<s> End-to-End's current use needs to be re-thought.  </s>
<s> I think it would be much cleaner to have communications meant for non-next hop proxies to have a different header, as hop-by-hop does.  </s>
<s> Consumed in the middle does not mean end-to-end and planning for either with the same header doesn't make sense to me.  </s>
<s> (Henrik) I have two points here: First, I disagree that HTTP defines end-to-end to mean from the user agent to the origin server.  </s>
<s> For example, the text in 13.5.1 says * End-to-end headers, which must be transmitted to the  </s>
<s> ultimate recipient of a request or response.  </s>
<s> End-to-end  </s>
<s> headers in responses must be stored as part of a cache entry and transmitted in any response formed from a cache entry.  </s>
<s> Think of caching, for example.  </s>
<s> The client sends a set of header fields in the request that it considers to be end-to-end, however, they may never reach the origin server because a cache happens to be the "ultimate recipient".  </s>
<s> A difference in Mandatory is that the "ultimate recipient" of a declaration doesn't have to be the same as for the rest of the message.  </s>
<s> But this is already the case with PICS labels and authentication that also can be handled by other parties than the origin server and the user agent.  </s>
<s> The whole point is that it should be transparent - it is for the feature to define who the appropriate recipient is for non-hop-by-hop extensions.  </s>
<s> However, that being said - I don't want to upheld the draft on essentially a question of terminology and if we can come up with another term than end-to-end then let's do that.  </s>
<s> Other names are welcome - or if you can provide wording that makes the distinction clear.  </s>
<s> I have added this as an item on the issues list.  </s>
<s> (Ted, again) I still believe there is a different behavior being defined in Mandatory than the caching example provides.  </s>
<s> The proxy cache behavior is defined by the proxy's need to act for the end host; in the presence of an end to end header in a request for which it has a valid entry, the proxy can still reply, on behalf of the ultimate recipient.  </s>
<s> It can't itself be the recipient of an end-to-end header (as an example, on a request for a resource which it has never before seen, the proxy *must* transmit all end to end headers to the ultimate recipient).  </s>
<s> I believe it is not a good idea to mix the terminology for headers intended to be consumed by some extension-defined participant with that for headers which are meant for the ultimate recipient, (defined either as the origin server or a proxy which can act for that server by virtue of having seen the request and response before).  </s>
<s> I think there should be a distinct name for those headers which get passed past the first hop but may be "consumed" prior to the end, as there are some issues specific to those headers (what happens if no one in the chain removes it, for example).  </s>
<s> (Ted)  </s>
<s> The layered approach in 5.0 seems to imply that the last step is to apply the semantics of the method without M-; since that is not what is meant, the language needs to be tightened to indicate that the semantics may be derived from the base method, but they should not be assumed.  </s>
<s> (Henrik) Good point.  </s>
<s> I would be inclined to remove the point entirely as it is really only the extension that can determine whether this is the right behavior.  </s>
<s> Do you agree - or do you have a proposed wording?  </s>
<s> I have added this as an issue.  </s>
<s> (Ted, again) I think getting rid of it will work, and I agree only the extension can determine the right behavior.  </s>
<s> Some language to warn people not to use M-PUT for DELETE is probably appropriate, but this probably isn't the right placement for it.  </s>
<s> (Henrik) It is important that people can use registered names without being forced to use full URIs.  </s>
<s> The current scheme allows us to transition from a unregistered name to a registered one.  </s>
<s> It doesn't matter whether IANA has multiple roots.  </s>
<s> Relative URIs are really just names within the IANA URI space.  </s>
<s> A clarifying paragraph could be useful in section 8. I have added this as an issue.  </s>
<s> (Ted, again) Maybe instead of saying "relative URIs", you can use the term "IANA-registered tokens".  </s>
<s> You may want to think about what set of IANA registries you want though.  </s>
<s> I assume you would want MIME, registered media features (when they exist), and possibly registered schemas.  </s>
<s> I believe that set would give you unique names without having to mention which registry something came from, but I'm not sure that would be true across all IANA registries.  </s>
<s> (Ted)  </s>
<s> In Section 6.0, the spec says that a host can send a resource with a manadatory extension without knowing if the requesting user can deal with the extension.  </s>
<s> That strikes me as pretty bad design, as it wastes a *lot* of bits on the wire.  </s>
<s> Given the number of "You must have X to read this site" sites, I'm afraid that it might be a fairly common case that people would pre-emptively require extensions.  </s>
<s> An "extension required" response followed by a new request strikes me as a better bet.  </s>
<s> (Henrik) They already do - servers ask you to download plug-ins, scripts etc.  </s>
<s> It really depends on the ubiquity of the extension in question.  </s>
<s> If it is a well-known extension saving a round trip is significant.  </s>
<s> If not then the extra bytes on the wire may be wasted.  </s>
<s> An extension framework has to support both.  </s>
<s> (Ted, again) Yes, servers already do ask users to download plug-ins etc, and some implementations start sending large resources before checking the user knows if it really can handle the MIME type.  </s>
<s> I think this is an artifact of the Accept: */* debacle, and I believe it is broken.  </s>
<s> Mandatory gives a chance to fix it (especially in combination with Options), and I think we should take it.  </s>
<s> Thanks for your patience with this long message, regards, Ted Hardie NASA NIC  </s>
<s> Perhaps this reading might hold legally, but the understanding I've had from following the HTTP mail list is that end-end means client to origin server.  </s>
<s> I too had/have a problem with use of end-end in the mandatory draft.  </s>
<s> It was confusing at best.  </s>
<s> 'Multi-hop' or 'multi-point' would convey the fact that what is meant is anything which isn't hop-hop and since it isn't a term with prior use in the HTTP context, the reader would read the text before believing s/he understood the meaning.  </s>
<s> Dave Morris  </s>
<s> (Henrik) I have two points here: First, I disagree that HTTP defines end-to-end to mean from the user agent to the origin server.  </s>
<s> For example, the text in 13.5.1 says * End-to-end headers, which must be transmitted to the ultimate recipient of a request or response.  </s>
<s> End-to-end headers in responses must be stored as part of a cache entry and transmitted in any response formed from a cache entry.  </s>
<s> Think of caching, for example.  </s>
<s> The client sends a set of header fields in the request that it considers to be end-to-end, however, they may never reach the origin server because a cache happens to be the "ultimate recipient".  </s>
<s> (Ted, again) I still believe there is a different behavior being defined in Mandatory than the caching example provides.  </s>
<s> The proxy cache behavior is defined by the proxy's need to act for the end host; in the presence of an end to end header in a request for which it has a valid entry, the proxy can still reply, on behalf of the ultimate recipient.  </s>
<s> It can't itself be the recipient of an end-to-end header (as an example, on a request for a resource which it has never before seen, the proxy *must* transmit all end to end headers to the ultimate recipient).  </s>
<s> Ted is right.  </s>
<s> I wrote the paragraph that Henrik cited, and Henrik's interpretation is exactly opposite to actual meaning.  </s>
<s> If there is any confusion, try reading that paragraph in its complete context: For the purpose of defining the behavior of caches and non-caching proxies, we divide HTTP headers into two categories: o End-to-end headers, which must be transmitted to the ultimate recipient of a request or response.  </s>
<s> End-to-end headers in responses must be stored as part of a cache entry and transmitted in any response formed from a cache entry.  </s>
<s> o Hop-by-hop headers, which are meaningful only for a single transport-level connection, and are not stored by caches or forwarded by proxies.  </s>
<s> In context, it should be clear that an "end-to-end" header is one that MUST be delivered to the server that is the target of a request (unless the request isn't forwarded to that server at all).  </s>
<s> You cannot separate an end-to-end header from the request of the request (or response).  </s>
<s> -Jeff  </s>
<s> I am not sure whether you mean this only goes for end-to-end header fields in requests or also for header-fields in responses.  </s>
<s> In any case, we can't say that - it simply doesn't work with existing HTTP applications as well as what we write elsewhere in the HTTP/1.1 specification. 1) A proxy can change the encoding as well as transform the contents in several other ways.  </s>
<s> These characteristics are all described using end-to-end header fields inserted, changed, or deleted by the proxy.  </s>
<s> Note that his may happen on a PUT as well as on a GET - it goes both ways.  </s>
<s> The no-transform cache control directive which can be used to avoid this is both a request and a response directive (there is a problem with the warning header that I have described in a separate mail).  </s>
<s> 2) Applications like a PICS (or some other content filtering mechanism) enabled proxy can filter contents on behalf of the people it serves.  </s>
<s> Typical examples of this is schools using proxies for accessing the Web.  </s>
<s> The proxy looks for PICS headers and filters the content according to a set of rules agreed upon by the school authority.  </s>
<s> 3) An annonymizing proxy that takes out user agent generated header fields and inserts its own instead is also a commonly used application.  </s>
<s> Ted is right, btw.  </s>
<s> that caching is different - it was a bad example I used in my previous mail, sorry!  </s>
<s> The above examples are all cases of "smart" proxies performing an operation on behalf on somebody else, either because it has an out-of-band agreement or because it is explicitly allowed to do this within HTTP.  </s>
<s> The operation can involve one or more header fields but does not have to included the whole message.  </s>
<s> Looking at deployed applications and how people are using HTTP, we can't change the policy now and not allow this behavior - it has been there all along.  </s>
<s> The current wording in the Mandatory draft reflects this use of the term end-to-end.  </s>
<s> I fail to see why you want to impose this restriction (in HTTP as well as in Mandatory)?  </s>
<s> I very much agree with Paul that this form for flexibility is crucial to HTTP.  </s>
<s> The only thing that it truly end-to-end in the sense that it must be performed by the origin server is generating the initial response to a request.  </s>
<s> This response may then under certain circumstances be cached and reused but the first must come from the origin server.  </s>
<s> And even then, this is only true for responses with status codes which are not explicitly defined otherwise.  </s>
<s> This is for example the case with 504 (Gateway Timeout).  </s>
