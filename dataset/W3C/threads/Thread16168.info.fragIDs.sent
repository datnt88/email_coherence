The second thing that I don't like about this list is another common piece of propaganda. 
This is the "accessibility is about more than just accessibility for people with disabilities" thread. 
Hold it! 
Hold it! 
Don't reach for that reply button yet, hear me out. 
I agree that accessibility in the larger picture includes 
making the web accessible to people by telephone, in their cars, at information kiosks, through brain-implants, whatever. 
I'm all for a variety of methods of access and I support CSS, XSL, and whatever methods might come along to make pages work for a variety of media. 
BUT... The issue of making sure a site is accessible to a person using the telephone is a business issue. 
The question is, Does it make sense for my company to spend X amount of dollars extra to make sure this site is accessible to the X percent of our visitors who might be using the phone to access the site. 
And the answer is pure math. 
If you are getting 0.05% of your hits from people using Lynx, it would be a very foolish decision to spend extra money (or to change the design of the site to one you might not like as much) just to make sure it is accessible to those visitors. 
Now I can already hear the screaming: "It doesn't take any extra money or effort!" or "You don't have to give up your current design!" See previous post (The first thing...). 
No businessperson who wants to remain in business can afford to ignore the simple logic of this type of decision. 
If I go to my client and say it's going to cost you 5% more to make your site accessible to 0.5% more people, he or she is going to question my sanity. 
And rightly so, from a business point of view. 
Play with the numbers if you like. 
Make it a 0.5% extra cost to make the site accessible to 5% more people. 
Fine. 
Now it makes sense, but the point is that it is a *business* decision. 
Making a site accessible to people with disabilities is also a business decision (and given the numbers involved, a wise one, in my opinion). 
But it is MUCH MORE THAN THAT. 
Making a site accessible to people who cannot access it any other way is an ethical decision. 
When you decide that you can't afford to support phone accessibility (setting aside the possibility that this might affect people with disabilities), you are deciding not to provide a *convenience* to your clientele. 
Not much different than deciding whether to have a site at all, or, for that matter, roughly equivalent to a burger joint deciding whether to add a drive-through window (accessible to people in their cars--how American). 
But a site that is inaccessible to people with disabilities is equivalent to segregating and ostracizing a portion of the population who cannot chose to no longer be persons with disabilities. 
Such a site is an *unethical* site in my opinion, and this list fails to capitalize on the moral power of that fact when it plays the "accessible for everyone" game. 
Again, I think making sites work in various mediums and on various browsers is an important part of consumer choice and good business sense. 
But I am offended by the implied equivalency between providing a convenience and acknowledging the *right* of everyone to equal access to that information. 
There are plenty of related issues here that I won't get into, such as the "artistic sites" thread (undecided on that one), the official sites vs. corporate or personal sites thread (I tend to think that personal sites might be exempt, but corporate sites should serve all the public), etc. OK, go for the reply button. 
I'm braced. 
One more to go.

Read the whole thing. 
I still don't agree with you on this. 
:) Part of the problem here is that when you make it "an ethical thing" to support accessibility, you lose the fight. 
Because businesspeople _will_ make it a business decision, and frankly, the majority of people out there DON'T want to make things accessible to the disabled. 
It's the natural state of people to be cruel and heartless to the disabled, because people (in general) suck. 
Accessibility _is_ about more than letting a blind person look at your web page. 
If you try to sell it on the strength of "be good to the blind", you won't get very far. 
However, you _can_ make a stronger case for accessibility concerns by pointing out that it's not just "those stupid cripples who want, of all things, the right to 'see' something on a computer screen! 
(why, next thing you know, deaf people will be demanding the right to use radios!)" Accessibility is about making the web usable by everyone, be that someone in a car, on a phone, on a crappy computer from the 1980s, in a foreign country, on the moon, or even someone who's unable to see. 
Sell the benefits of access to _everyone_ and it's a much better sale than saying "hey, I'll tell you what, I'll break the HTML, thus guaranteeing fewer people can use your site, but hey, it'll save you money!" 
Any business person who buys that will go out of business soon! 
In short, I think you're a bit idealistic to think you can sell accessibility on the premise that people will "do the right thing" because they're ethical. 
Especially since it's not the only benefit of accessibility.

Well, he wrote a bunch of stuff. 
Rather than try to pick out quotes, I've reproduced it below. 
I half agree with the line of reasoning espoused below. 
Yes, business-people will make decisions based on what's good for the business. 
However, what's good for the business may depend on ethical issues. 
In the civil rights movement, the high moral ground was clearly held by those in support of equal rights for negroes. 
The moral underpinning of this fight helped to pull in a lot of people who might have otherwise sat it out. 
True, when the buses were boycotted the message to the businesspeople was sent on the bottom line, as it must be given our current business attitudes. 
But this message was made a thousand times more powerful by the moral indignation that roused so many other people to the cause. 
So do not underestimate the power of ethical or moral arguments. 
Nations have toppled over them. 
Overall your argument seems cynical to me. 
Worse, you make "idealist" sound like a four-letter word. 
Idealism is what makes us most human. 
It is our greatest gift, that we can see beyond our immediate needs. 
To dismiss this as naive and to play--quite consciously--to selfishness seems to me to perhaps win the battle but lose the war. 
It is a price I, for one, am not willing to pay. 
And I do not share your cynicism about humanity. 
Most of the people that I know are kind, thoughtful people. 
They only act cruelly when they are isolated from the effects of their actions. 
When they see the harm that they are causing, the *vast* majority are appalled and cease to harm. 
Now it may be that all business owners are evil (I doubt it), but even if they were, their business is a social venture depending on the support of society for it's existence. 
They will listen if enough of their customers demand it. 
Sure, let's sing the praises of accessibility for all, disabled or not, but let us not forsake the high moral ground.

I disagree. 
Nobody cares about the disabled except perhaps as objects of pity. 
This is why we have laws requiring access to public buildings, for example -- because nobody, out of the goodness of their hearts, will just do it because it's "right". 
People only care when they're forced to care. 
[Insert analogy here regarding forced integration in the South, BTW -- except that I don't really want to go down that tangent, since I think it's a poor chosen analogy.] 
(Of course the above is over-stated; however, as a generalization it's true for the majority of society. 
If your view on ethics and morality were right, then there would be _no_ barriers left for the disabled to overcome, because the able-bodied would be eagerly going out of their way to eliminate all obstacles. 
This isn't the case, because people aren't "ethical" and "moral.") 
I think you misinterpreted what I said. 
(Plus, in your third on what you don't like, you referred to "human nature" anyway.) 
Why is accessibility for the blind on "higher moral ground" than accessibility for the poor, accessibility for the users of non- standard web browsers, or accessibility for international users? 
I think you need to very carefully back up and reconsider why you hold disabled users up on a pedestal they haven't necessarily asked to be placed on, and are promoting their concerns as the only "moral" ones we face. 
_My_ moral high ground is "accessibility for everyone" not "accessibility for anyone who isn't as physically functional as the typical person." 
The latter high ground sounds awful condescending -- but then, it should be noted that I'm not a disabled person.

list +AD4APg-So do not underestimate the power of ethical or moral +AD4APg-arguments.

+AD4-I disagree.

+AD4-People only care when they're forced to care. 
Ouch+ACE- This is really cynical. 
Again, I disagree. 
Corporations have to be forced (not always, but often), whether by law or by public opinion, because corporations are inhuman. 
And the people who work in them are conditioned to think bottom line, not ethics. 
They often feel powerless against the might of the company. 
But people are not corporations, and even the CEO who just created a new toxic waste dump may go out of his or her way to do a kind thing for a stranger. 
Most, if not all, people want to feel good about themselves. 
It's hard to feel good about yourself when you are hurting other people. 
So, the best way to stop people from hurting others is to make them aware of that harm, and to make them aware that others are also aware. 
The law should always be a last resort, not the first resort. 
And as for caring, you can force people to act, but you cannot force them to care. 
They either do or they don't. 
And my experience is that people usually do. 
People are a lot more complex than is implied by the argument above. 
+AD4-(Of course the above is over-stated+ADs- however, as a generalization +AD4-it's true for the majority of society. 
If your view on ethics +AD4-and morality were right, then there would be +AF8-no+AF8- barriers left +AD4-for the disabled to overcome, because the able-bodied would be +AD4-eagerly going out of their way to eliminate all obstacles. 
This +AD4-isn't the case, because people aren't +ACI-ethical+ACI- and +ACI-moral.+ACI-) 
This is simply untrue. 
First, if you look at the polls you'll see that the majority of people, at least in the U.S., want to see greater accessibility for people with disabilities. 
I suspect the numbers may be even greater in other countries. 
Do not confuse corporate and government policy with the desires of the people. 
In the U.S., as in most countries, the government and big business serve the interests of the elite, and they will only bend when those interests are threatened. 
The ADA passed, not because we have enlightened leaders in Congress, but becuase a lot of ordinary Americans, many of them not considering themselves disabled, made it too costly for the powers-that-be to avoid. 
And those same people continue to pressure the goverment to enforce it. 
Where do they fit into the above equation? 
The fallacy of your argument, Kynn, is obvious. 
You have stated that you are not disabled. 
Yet you obviously are a passionate advocate for accessibility. 
Is this really only a selfish pursuit for business gain, or are you in fact an ethical, moral person? 
My guess is the later. 
Is it not also 
possible that I, too, am an ethical person? 
And if so, what about the others on this list, or were you making exceptions for them, too? 
And do you really believe that of all the people all over the world devoting time to volunteer work, giving money to charities, etc., only we care about the rights of people with disabilities? 
I hope not. 
+AD4APg-Overall your argument seems cynical to me. 
Worse, you make +AD4APgAi-idealist+ACI- sound like a four-letter word. 
Idealism is what +AD4APg-makes us most human.

+AD4-I think you misinterpreted what I said. 
(Plus, in your third on +AD4-what you don't like, you referred to +ACI-human nature+ACI- anyway.) Perhaps I did misinterpret you. 
I hope so. 
But I think that you may not have pursued your line of reasoning to its obvious conclusion. 
See the discussion above about who is ethical and who isn't. 
+AD4-Why is accessibility for the blind on +ACI-higher moral ground+ACI- than +AD4-accessibility for the poor, accessibility for the users of non- +AD4-standard web browsers, or accessibility for international users? 
+AD4-I think you need to very carefully back up and reconsider why +AD4-you hold disabled users up on a pedestal they haven't necessarily +AD4-asked to be placed on, and are promoting their concerns as the +AD4-only +ACI-moral+ACI- ones we face. 
+AF8-My+AF8- moral high ground is +ACI-accessibility +AD4-for everyone+ACI- not +ACI-accessibility for anyone who isn't as physically +AD4-functional as the typical person.+ACI- 
+AD4-The latter high ground sounds awful condescending -- but then, it +AD4-should be noted that I'm not a disabled person. 
First, I do not consider accessibility for people with disabilities to be higher moral ground than accessibility for the poor, and I did not say so. 
The issue centers around the idea of choice. 
The person with a disability has no choice but to live with that disability. 
The person who is poor probably doesn't have much choice either. 
I consider access for the poor to be equally important with access for people with disabilites. 
But let's talk about users of non-standard browsers. 
Let's say that you like to use, oh, say, Opera, with image loading and frames turned off. 
Well, that's your choice. 
Certainly makes things faster. 
Actually, you had to pay for that browser and had to go out of your way to turn images and frames off. 
Now, to make my site accessible to you, given your choice, might be a good business decision for me. 
Depends. 
Are you the only one? 
Well, then turn the damn images and frames back on. 
Are there a lot of you. 
Hmm, better reconsider. 
But is your refusal to turn the images and frames on a moral one, or one of choice and convenience? 
You can just as easily turn them on as off. 
How does this compare to the person who MUST use a screen reader to access that information. 
Should we really consider both of these to be moral issues? 
Do these warrant equal consideration? 
Perhaps you think so. 
I think not. 
And making them equal is the truly condescending choice. 
I am putting no-one on a pedestal. 
I do not speak for people with disabilities. 
I only ask, What do I need to do to permit you to access my site? 
Tell me, and I will do it if at all possible. 
And if I can contribute to a fund to distribute computers to those who can't afford them (or at least get access for them in some way), I will do so (proportionately with other issues that I must confront... can't do everything). 
Describing this as +ACIAWw-putting them+AF0- up on a pedestal+ACI- smacks to me of the +ACI-No Special Rights+ACI- argument used against the gay community. 
Does the ADA put people with disabilities on a pedestal? 
Certainly it's about +ACI-rights+ACI- and rights are always moral and ethical issues. 
I don't see that wanting people who did not choose their condition to be able to overcome its limitations is putting them on a pedestal. 
I think it's simply being just. 
And as for international users, well that depends on the intended audience. 
If your information is pertinent to only people in your region, I don't see that you need to make it accessible to the curious from other regions. 
Should every site be translated into every language just in case? 
Again, not a moral issue but one of business sense and logistics. 
It makes sense to translate your site or insure international access only when your clientele is international (I should know... 
I live and work in Mexico and build sites in English for an American and Canadian audience, sometimes with translation into Spanish and other languages). 
I'm ready to hear from some others on this issue. 
Anyone else?

I actually don't do this _just_ because of the disabled. 
For the most part, I'm interested in accessibility because when I do something, I believe in doing it _right_. 
Making an accessible page is making an HTML page _right_. 
Sure, it benefits the disabled -- but it also benefits the search engines, the web tv users, etc etc etc. Y'know, the list you don't want to hear about anymore. 
:) I'm a web author first and foremost. 
I'm the president of the HTML Writers Guild. 
In my everyday life, I have little to no contact with handicapped people, and I have never been involved with any charity or organization that is dedicated to improving things for the disabled -- outside of my activities regarding web accessibility. 
So, I think I'd say that I'm NOT doing it because it's morally and ethically right to be nice to blind folks; I think the best you can come up with is that I believe it's ethically right to do the best job you can when making a web page. 
[BTW, to those of you who _are_ "activists for disabled people" or disabled yourself or whatever, this does not mean that I have no interest in those issues; however, I am identifying my primary motivations here and trying to explain that not everyone in this fight automatically is here for the same reasons. 
I'm not _against_ organizations that help the disabled; I simply have never devoted my time to that.] Kynn Bartlett kynn@idyllmtn.com http://www.kynn.com/
