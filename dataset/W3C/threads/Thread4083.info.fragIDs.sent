What *should* be the result of applying xsl:xpath-default-namespace="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform" as in xsl:template match="template" default-xpath-namespace="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform" I'd expect it to provide the result of the select attribute of a template. 
It appears not to be explictly forbidden by the WD. 
Equally, it could be useful for self documented stylesheets?

Correct, if applied to a stylesheet this should return the value of the select attribute of an xsl:value-of element that is a child of an xsl:template element. 
What part of this construct would we want to forbid? 
I'm not sure whether you have a problem here or whether you are just observing that the spec allows you to do something that you find useful.
