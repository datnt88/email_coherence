I came across this the other day: (WARNING: may cause seizures) I believe this link would be a problem for people with epilepsy (it certainly induced a headache in me). 
The big question - would it fail the relevant guideline?

I will run a test on it. 
but it doesn't fail the current guideline (flashing) - and I don't think it will fail the new ones either. 
The pattern might fail at Level 3 if they had more stripes in the header - but I don't thing there are near enough to cause a failure.
