Hi, This seems like a good moment to put out a call for suggestions for exactly what types of note (e.g. editor-note, hierarchy note) should be supported by SKOS-Core, and what each note should contain. 
Can I ask you to be as precise as possible in outlining what each type of note should be used for. 
Many thanks, Alistair. 
Here is a survey of the note types in the vocabularies that I'm currently dealing with: LCC, DDC, LCSH, MeSH, FAST, GSAFD. 
They basically fall into three classes, MARC21-A, MARC21-C, and Dewey. 
MARC21-A Authorities Format * 667 - NONPUBLIC GENERAL NOTE (R) General information about a 1XX heading for which a specialized note field has not been defined. 
* 670 - SOURCE DATA FOUND (R) A citation for a consulted source in which information is found about the 1XX heading in an established heading record, an established heading and subdivision record, a subdivision record or a reference record. 
The information found in the source may also be present. 
* 675 - SOURCE DATA NOT FOUND (NR) A citation for a consulted source in which no information is found about the 1XX heading in an established heading record, an established heading and subdivision record, or a subdivision record. 
* 678 - BIOGRAPHICAL OR HISTORICAL DATA (R) A summary of the essential biographical, historical, or other information about the 1XX heading in an established heading record, an established heading and subdivision record, or a subdivision record. 
* 680 - PUBLIC GENERAL NOTE (R) General information about a 1XX heading for which a specialized note field has not been defined. 
The note is written in a form adequate for public display. 
* 681 - SUBJECT EXAMPLE TRACING NOTE (R) Documents the use of the 1XX subject or authorized subdivision heading as an example or reference in fields 260, 360, and/or 680 in another authority record. 
* 682 - DELETED HEADING INFORMATION (NR) An explanation for the deletion of an established heading or subdivision record from an authority file (Leader/05, value d). 
The replacement heading(s) may be contained in subfield(s) $a. * 688 - APPLICATION HISTORY NOTE (R) Information that documents changes in the application of a 1XX heading. 
MARC21-C Classification Format * 680 - SCOPE NOTE (R) Information about the classification number or number span in field 153 (Classification Number) that describes its scope in the scheme identified in field 084 (Classification Schedule and Edition). 
* 681 - CLASSIFICATION EXAMPLE TRACING NOTE (R) Information that documents the use of the 153 classification number or number span in one record as an example or reference in fields 253, 353 and/or 6XX note fields in another record. 
This field is primarily intended to serve as a tracing of the use of classification numbers in examples and notes to assist classifiers in updating records. 
* 683 - APPLICATION INSTRUCTION NOTE (R) Instructions for applying tables, subarrangements, or additions to classification numbers. 
* 684 - AUXILIARY INSTRUCTION NOTE (R) Information from, or reference to, a section of a classifier's manual or other documentation. 
An auxiliary instruction note provides advice for classifying in difficult areas, and describes policies and practices that may accompany a classification schedule. 
* 685 - HISTORY NOTE (R) Information about the history of the use and meaning of a classification number that is contained either in a 153 classification number field or in a 453/553 tracing field with subfield $w/3, Control subfield, code a. * 686 - RELATIONSHIP TO SOURCE NOTE (R) Information about the relationship of a number to the source edition when the number is different from the standard number for the same topic in the primary source edition. 
This field is used for numbers based on a source other than the primary source, expansions, implemented options, and adaptations. 
The information in this field is intended primarily for computer processing or to guide classifiers and is often not written in a form adequate for public user display. 
Dewey * ADD NOTE - GENERIC INSTRUCTION * ADD NOTE - IDENTIFIED BY SYMBOL * ADD NOTE - SCHEDULE NUMBER, PART OF * ADD NOTE - SCHEDULE NUMBER, FULL * ADD NOTE - TABLE NUMBER, PART OF * ADD NOTE - TABLE NUMBER, ADD OF * ADD NOTE - REFERRAL TO TABLE * ADD NOTE - SEE REFERENCE * ADD NOTE - SEE REFERENCE, SCATTERED * ADD NOTE - STANDARD SUBDIVISIONS, ARE ADDED * ADD NOTE - STANDARD SUBDIVISIONS, DO NOT ADD * ADD NOTE - SUBDIVISIONS * ADD TABLE NOTE - GENERIC INSTRUCTION * ADD TABLE NOTE - IDENTIFIED BY SYMBOL * ADD TABLE NOTE - SCHEDULE NUMBER, PART OF * ADD TABLE NOTE - TABLE NUMBER, ALL * ADD TABLE NOTE - TABLE NUMBER, PART OF * ARRANGE ALPHABETICALLY NOTE * ARRANGE BY AUTHOR NOTE * ARRANGE CHRONOLOGICALLY NOTE * ARRANGE NUMERICALLY NOTE * ARRANGE BY TITLE NOTE * BUILD NOTE * BUILT NUMBER NOTE * CLASS HERE NOTE * CLASS ELSEWHERE NOTE * CLASS ELSEWHERE NOTE - SCATTERED * DEFINITION NOTE * DISCONTINUED NOTE - VACATED NUMBER * DISCONTINUED NOTE - PARTIALLY CHANGED NUMBER * EDITOR NOTE * EDITOR NOTE - FLAG * FOOTNOTE - ADD * FOOTNOTE - GENERIC * FOOTNOTE - OPTION * FOOTNOTE - STANDARD SUBDIVISIONS * FOOTNOTE - STANDARD SUBDIVISIONS, DO NOT ADD * FOOTNOTE - STANDARD SUBDIVISIONS, EXTRA ZEROS * FOOTNOTE - STANDARD SUBDIVISIONS, MODIFIED * FOOTNOTE - TABLE 2 * FORMER HEADING NOTE * INCLUDING NOTE * MANUAL NOTE * MANUAL NOTE, LIKE * MOST RECENTLY USED NOTE * NEW SCHEDULE NOTE * NOTATION NOTE - DO NOT USE * OPTION NOTE * OPTIONAL NUMBER NOTE * PREFERENCE NOTE * REFERENCE NOTE - SEE ALSO * REFERENCE NOTE - SEE * REFERENCE NOTE - SEE MANUAL * REFERENCE NOTE - SEE SCATTERED * RELOCATION NOTE * RELOCATION NOTE - ADD * RELOCATION NOTE - VACATED NUMBER * RELOCATION NOTE - PARTIALLY CHANGED NUMBER * REVISION NOTE - COMPLETELY * REVISION NOTE - EXTENSIVELY * SCOPE NOTE * SEGMENTATION NOTE * SEMIHIERARCHICAL NOTE * STANDARD SUBDIVISIONS NOTE - MODIFIED * STANDARD SUBDIVISIONS NOTE - REOCCURRING IRREGULARITIES * TABLE NOTE - BUILD * TABLE NOTE - GENERIC * TABLE NOTE - OPTION * TABLE NOTE - PREFERENCE * VARIANT NAME NOTE I think I got most of the important Dewey notes... 
I decided to skip the definitions for Dewey since many of them are specific to Dewey itself. 
But I did rename the notes from what the Dewey editors use so they could be classified into groups so they could be compared with other vocabulary note types and to discover cross vocabulary similarities. 
From the list you can see the diversity of notes in Dewey compared with MARC21-A and MARC21-C. 
There are patterns to the Dewey note types. 
First, let me *emphatically* say: I don't feel that SKOS *should support* all these note types. 
That wouldn't be useful since few vocabularies need to or go into such detail. 
However, I do see a group of base note types that could be useful for thesauri, subject headings, classification, etc. and a mechanism to extend the base note types for specific purposes. 
Looking at the original SKOS proposal it had the following note types defined in the RDF schema: skos:scopeNote, skos:generalNote, skos:hierarchyNote, skos:editorNote, and skos:historyNote. 
Lets just take these and see how MARC21-A, MARC21-C and Dewey fit in. 
Note, I didn't find an SKOS definition of what each of these note types means, so what follows is based upon my *interpretation*. 
I think Miles eluded to the fact that definitions *need* to go along with the SKOS elements, or scope notes for note types. 
SKOS MARC21-A MARC21-C Dewey scopeNote 680 680 SCOPE NOTE 683 CLASS HERE NOTE 684 CLASS ELSEWHERE NOTE CLASS ELSEWHERE NOTE - SCATTERED DEFINITION NOTE [5] INCLUDING NOTE OPTION NOTE PREFERENCE NOTE generalNote [1] 667 [2] 686 [6] Probably most everything else goes here, with a few exceptions [6] hierarchyNote [4] SEMIHIERARCHICAL NOTE editorNote 667 EDITOR NOTE EDITOR NOTE - FLAG historyNote 678 685 DISCONTINUED NOTE - VACATED NUMBER 682 DISCONTINUED NOTE - PARTIALLY CHANGED NUMBER 688 FORMER HEADING NOTE MOST RECENTLY USED NOTE NEW SCHEDULE NOTE RELOCATION NOTE RELOCATION NOTE - ADD RELOCATION NOTE - VACATED NUMBER RELOCATION NOTE - PARTIALLY CHANGED NUMBER REVISION NOTE - COMPLETELY REVISION NOTE - EXTENSIVELY example 670 [3] 681 675 [3] 681 [1] Public or non-public? 
[2] Assumption is non-public. 
[3] A citation could roughly be considered an example, but this doesn't fit well. 
[4] What's the scope for this? 
[5] A definition could roughly be considered a scope note, but this doesn't fit well. 
[6] Assumption is public. 
There are some places where the Dewey notes don't fit well. 
One area of concern is the VARIANT NAME NOTES. 
In Dewey the preferred term is the class number. 
There are many alternate labels, such as the captions associated with the class number from the various translations. 
Variant names really aren't alternate labels for the concept, per say, but the also aren't strictly notes either. 
Kind of mixture of the two... 
We still aren't sure how to resolve this issue. 
I also lumped a lot of stuff in skos:generalNote that probably shouldn't belong their. 
From these vocabularies I can start to see some patterns. 
There are distinctions between public vs. private notes which roughly could fit skos:scopeNote vs. skos:editorNote. 
However, public notes do not necessarily have to have a scope relationship to the concept. 
So the definition of skos:scopeNote needs a better definition. 
For me a scopeNote defines what is or is not in code for the concept. 
This would include things like when to use the concept, when not to use the concept, what is included with the concept, what is not included with the concept, and optional or restricted information for using the concept. 
A public note is just that, a note for public consumption that doesn't relate to the scope of the concept. 
Probably not the best definition. 
There are distinctions between editor vs. private notes but in my mind its difficult to say where the line is, e.g. when does a private note become a editorial note? 
The skos:editorNote could cover both and if the vocabulary maintainer needs to make that distinction it could. 
Or better yet you could have skos:editorNote subclass skos:privateNote which subclasses skos:Note. 
If someone needs to make a different distinction between an skos:editorNote and another form of private note they can just subclass skos:privateNote. 
So maybe a class hierarchy might look like: skos:Note skos:publicNote skos:scopeNote skos:historyNote skos:privateNote skos:editorNote I noted an issue with skos:generalNote, is it public or private? 
I think that skos:historyNote is a good generic note type to build different types of history notes upon. 
Breaking down the MARC21 note formats, we can see the following: * public notes * non-public notes * scope notes * history notes * citation notes * application notes * general notes * examples Breaking down the Dewey note formats, we can see the following: * public notes * non-public notes * scope notes * history notes * citation notes * application notes * general notes * examples * hierarchy notes (not sure whether definition matches SKOS) * reference notes * arrangement notes If I were to suggest a class hierachy for these three vocabularies, it might look something like: skos:definition - a definition of the concept, useful for encoding dictionaries, jargon, acronym, abbreviations; this is really another form of specialized note, should it be a subclass of skos:Note or skos:publicNote? 
skos:example - examples of the usage for the existing concept; this is really another form of specialized note, should it be a subclass of skos:Note or skos:publicNote? 
skos:Note - generic class for notes that allows subclassing for specialized note types skos:publicNote - generic class for public notes that allows subclassing for specialized note types skos:applicationNote - defines instructions for applying tables, subarrangements, or additions to construct new concepts based upon the existing concept skos:arrangementNote - defines how to arrange items under the concept skos:citationNote - defines a citation of a consulted source for defining the existing concept skos:generalNote - defines general information for which a specialized note type has not been defined skos:hierarchyNote - [needs a definition] skos:historyNote - defines information about the history or past use and meaning of the concept skos:referenceNote - defines other places that the person might wish to consider when evaluating the concept for use; these places are outside the scope of the BT/NT/RT semantic relationships skos:scopeNote - defines what is or is not in code for the concept and would include things like when to use the concept, when not to use the concept, what is included with the concept, what is not included with the concept, and optional or restricted information for using the concept. 
skos:privateNote - generic class for non-public, e.g. private, notes that allows subclassing for specialized note types skos:editorNote - a note for an editor, translator or maintainer of the vocabulary Given the above response, I realize that this was a very long message to read through, perhaps people who deal with other vocabularies could share the note types they find in them and some broad note type categories that could be generalized for SKOS use. 
I have provided a start and the dart board. 
Feel free to plunder these ideas and see how other vocabularies fit within the definitions.

To add to Andy's catalogue of notes, here is what we have so far in the draft Parts 1 and 2 of BS8723: Only three types of note field are mentioned: Scope note, History note and Editorial note, defined as follows. 
Scope note: "note which defines or clarifies the meaning of a concept as it is used in the structured vocabulary" History note: "A history note may record the date of introduction, or it may give more complex advice on how to search for the concept in earlier or later times." 
There is no explicit definition of an editorial note, but it is recommended as a housekeeping field rather than a field for display to users, and there is this advice: 'An editorial note is useful for entries such as "Review this term after the company merger complete" or "This term is mentioned in the scope note of term X" ' NB notes of the latter type may also be made in reciprocal scope notes, if appropriate, and this is set out in the draft. 
The standard does not exclude other types of note, only it does not make any requirement for them, nor does it expect them to be used in a standardised way. 
BS8723 Parts 1 and 2 will in time supersede BS5723, which deals with monolingual thesauri. 
Drafts for Public Comment will be published shortly. 
It is hoped the comments and later the fully-fledged standard will lead on to revision of the international standard ISO 2788. 
Comments are welcomed at any stage, and we hope the SKOS work will feed in to the eventual Part 5.

Andy. 
Andrew Houghton, OCLC Online Computer Library Center, Inc. Alistair, I'm not sure that it's really necessary to try to specify a wide range of different possible kinds of notes. 
This seems to me to be a case where your idea of subclassing and inheritance is going to be really useful (the other is the different types of hierarchical relationship such as partitive, generic, etc.). 
I think it's important, as Andy suggests, to distinguish between public and private notes, since these may be handled in different ways, but for the rest, I'm not sure it matters a lot. 
A scope note, a history note, and some kind of internal note are the ones that I have seen most often, but others have a lot more experience with this. 
I'm still a little concerned about delivering all of these notes every time we access a Concept. 
I would say normally in a _thesaurus_ application at least there's a continuum of how often information gets used, something like this: Most often used Concept identification and label information Relationship information (BTs, NTs, RTs) V Least often used Notes information The Concept object combines the most often used information with the least often used information. 
Sometimes these notes can be very long (Andy is perhaps in a good position to confirm or deny my fears here). 
So the API may be delivering a lot of textual information with Concepts that will only be used a very small percentage of the time. 
Maybe in practice this overhead won't matter, but it's an issue perhaps to evaluate. 
Ron Ron Davies Information and documentation systems consultant Av. Baden-Powell 1 Bte 2, 1200 Brussels, Belgium GSM: +32 (0)484 502 393 Hi! I would suggest that instruction/application note (683/684/681) need to be clearly encoded and distinct from scopeNotes. 
It does not matter whether it is put as a sub-type of scopeNote or as separate providing it is made machine readable. 
scopeNote 680 680 SCOPE NOTE 683 CLASS HERE NOTE 684 CLASS ELSEWHERE NOTE CLASS ELSEWHERE NOTE - SCATTERED DEFINITION NOTE [5] INCLUDING NOTE OPTION NOTE PREFERENCE NOTE scopeNote is usually a simple text. 
Application note holds the rules to support indexing tool creation which ought to be automated (Librarians like to think of hyperlinks and 'window-popping' offering terms to be combined :-) ) Instruction/application notes can be further subdivided and are likely to be different for every system as is well demonstrated in Andrew's example. 
(For those not familiar with knowledge classification systems these notes exist as every system deploys some kind of economy in reusing already listed concepts suggesting the combinations and concept building to avoid repeating and enumeration. 
E.g. hierarchy of places, languages, colours, plants, chemical elements etc. will be used in many knowledge areas. 
Analytico-synthetic classification are structured relationally and general rules work for the whole system so they have less of 'situational notes'. 
Enumerative systems (Dewey, LCC) have to record such a possibility for each number or span of numbers - hence the complexity of Dewey's notes in Andrew's example) But even assuming all these differences all general and special classifications of knowledge have the following kind of Instruction/application notes in common: i) limiting/linking the use of term for certain area of vocabulary: do(not) use with -- .., (not)valid for -- ... if ...prefer this -- ii) further divide/denote with/as -- ... (links the auxiliary tables, floating divisions etc.); divide as -- 'parallel division' (links the part of the schedule that contains hierarchy that needs to be copied) iii) examples of combination (in supporting above rules e.g. parallel division, combination with auxilairy number or number from other table) This does not mean that SKOS should go into these fine distinctions. 
This is more to stress that there may be the reason for keeping this kind of note separate.

I decided to skip the definitions for Dewey since many of them are specific to Dewey itself. 
But I did rename the notes from what the Dewey editors use so they could be classified into groups so they could be compared with other vocabulary note types and to discover cross vocabulary similarities. 
From the list you can see the diversity of notes in Dewey compared with MARC21-A and MARC21-C. 
There are patterns to the Dewey note types. 
First, let me *emphatically* say: I don't feel that SKOS *should support* all these note types. 
That wouldn't be useful since few vocabularies need to or go into such detail. 
However, I do see a group of base note types that could be useful for thesauri, subject headings, classification, etc. and a mechanism to extend the base note types for specific purposes. 
Looking at the original SKOS proposal it had the following note types defined in the RDF schema: skos:scopeNote, skos:generalNote, skos:hierarchyNote, skos:editorNote, and skos:historyNote. 
Lets just take these and see how MARC21-A, MARC21-C and Dewey fit in. 
Note, I didn't find an SKOS definition of what each of these note types means, so what follows is based upon my *interpretation*. 
I think Miles eluded to the fact that definitions *need* to go along with the SKOS elements, or scope notes for note types. 
SKOS MARC21-A MARC21-C Dewey scopeNote 680 680 SCOPE NOTE 683 CLASS HERE NOTE 684 CLASS ELSEWHERE NOTE CLASS ELSEWHERE NOTE - SCATTERED DEFINITION NOTE [5] INCLUDING NOTE OPTION NOTE PREFERENCE NOTE generalNote [1] 667 [2] 686 [6] Probably most everything else goes here, with a few exceptions [6] hierarchyNote [4] SEMIHIERARCHICAL NOTE editorNote 667 EDITOR NOTE EDITOR NOTE - FLAG historyNote 678 685 DISCONTINUED NOTE - VACATED NUMBER 682 DISCONTINUED NOTE - PARTIALLY CHANGED NUMBER 688 FORMER HEADING NOTE MOST RECENTLY USED NOTE NEW SCHEDULE NOTE RELOCATION NOTE RELOCATION NOTE - ADD RELOCATION NOTE - VACATED NUMBER RELOCATION NOTE - PARTIALLY CHANGED NUMBER REVISION NOTE - COMPLETELY REVISION NOTE - EXTENSIVELY example 670 [3] 681 675 [3] 681 [1] Public or non-public? 
[2] Assumption is non-public. 
[3] A citation could roughly be considered an example, but this doesn't fit well. 
[4] What's the scope for this? 
[5] A definition could roughly be considered a scope note, but this doesn't fit well. 
[6] Assumption is public. 
There are some places where the Dewey notes don't fit well. 
One area of concern is the VARIANT NAME NOTES. 
In Dewey the preferred term is the class number. 
There are many alternate labels, such as the captions associated with the class number from the various translations. 
Variant names really aren't alternate labels for the concept, per say, but the also aren't strictly notes either. 
Kind of mixture of the two... 
We still aren't sure how to resolve this issue. 
I also lumped a lot of stuff in skos:generalNote that probably shouldn't belong their. 
distinctions between public vs. private notes which roughly could fit skos:scopeNote vs. skos:editorNote. 
However, public notes do not necessarily have to have a scope relationship to the concept. 
So the definition of skos:scopeNote needs a better definition. 
For me a scopeNote defines what is or is not in code for the concept. 
This would include things like when to use the concept, when not to use the concept, what is included with the concept, what is not included with the concept, and optional or restricted information for using the concept. 
A public note is just that, a note for public consumption that doesn't relate to the scope of the concept. 
Probably not the best definition. 
There are distinctions between editor vs. private notes but in my mind its difficult to say where the line is, e.g. when does a private note become a editorial note? 
The skos:editorNote could cover both and if the vocabulary maintainer needs to make that distinction it could. 
Or better yet you could have skos:editorNote subclass skos:privateNote which subclasses skos:Note. 
If someone needs to make a different distinction between an skos:editorNote and another form of private note they can just subclass skos:privateNote. 
So maybe a class hierarchy might look like: skos:Note skos:publicNote skos:scopeNote skos:historyNote skos:privateNote skos:editorNote I noted an issue with skos:generalNote, is it public or private? 
I think that skos:historyNote is a good generic note type to build different types of history notes upon. 
Breaking down the MARC21 note formats, we can see the following: * public notes * non-public notes * scope notes * history notes * citation notes * application notes * general notes * examples Breaking down the Dewey note formats, we can see the following: * public notes * non-public notes * scope notes * history notes * citation notes * application notes * general notes * examples * hierarchy notes (not sure whether definition matches SKOS) * reference notes * arrangement notes If I were to suggest a class hierachy for these three vocabularies, it might look something like: skos:definition - a definition of the concept, useful for encoding dictionaries, jargon, acronym, abbreviations; this is really another form of specialized note, should it be a subclass of skos:Note or skos:publicNote? 
skos:example - examples of the usage for the existing concept; this is really another form of specialized note, should it be a subclass of skos:Note or skos:publicNote? 
skos:Note - generic class for notes that allows subclassing for specialized note types skos:publicNote - generic class for public notes that allows subclassing for specialized note types skos:applicationNote - defines instructions for applying tables, subarrangements, or additions to construct new concepts based upon the existing concept skos:arrangementNote - defines how to arrange items under the concept skos:citationNote - defines a citation of a consulted source for defining the existing concept skos:generalNote - defines general information for which a specialized note type has not been defined skos:hierarchyNote - [needs a definition] skos:historyNote - defines information about the history or past use and meaning of the concept skos:referenceNote - defines other places that the person might wish to consider when evaluating the concept for use; these places are outside the scope of the BT/NT/RT semantic relationships skos:scopeNote - defines what is or is not in code for the concept and would include things like when to use the concept, when not to use the concept, what is included with the concept, what is not included with the concept, and optional or restricted information for using the concept. 
skos:privateNote - generic class for non-public, e.g. private, notes that allows subclassing for specialized note types skos:editorNote - a note for an editor, translator or maintainer of the vocabulary Given the above response, I realize that this was a very long message to read through, perhaps people who deal with other vocabularies could share the note types they find in them and some broad note type categories that could be generalized for SKOS use. 
I have provided a start and the dart board. 
Feel free to plunder these ideas and see how other vocabularies fit within the definitions.

Andrew Houghton, OCLC Online Computer Library Center, Inc. your idea the different types of hierarchical relationship such as partitive, generic, etc.). 
I think it's important, as Andy suggests, to distinguish between public and private notes, since these may be handled in different ways, but for the rest, I'm not sure it matters a lot. 
A scope note, a history note, and some kind of internal time we least this: One reason for defining a little more than scope, history, internal notes is that it allow you extract the notes that are relevant to your audience. 
For example, someone browsing the vocabulary is probably not interested in application, citation, reference, or editorial notes. 
They may only need scope and public notes. 
However, a librarian who is trying to apply the vocabulary is probably interested in application, scope, and history notes. 
As I pointed out, Dewey may be far to one side with all its note types. 
BTW after I sent my prior message I discovered that the Excel spreadsheet I was filtering that contained the tags and descriptions was filtered incorrectly and there were another twenty more note types! 
Ouch, however they didn't add anything new to the discussion than what I presented. 
In my prior message I showed that it was possible to boil down all those notes types to a very small set of distinct buckets that one could use to build more detailed note types. 
The buckets I suggested *probably* have broader use across various, thesauri, subject headings, classification systems, etc. 
Many vocabularies may only use a few note types as you suggested, but it would be nice to have the additional ones I suggested so you can do finer grained things for presentation or programmatic manipulation. 
often in a good position to confirm or deny my fears here). 
So the API may be delivering a lot of textual information with Concepts that will only be used a very small percentage of the time. 
Maybe in practice this overhead won't matter, but it's an The length of notes vary from vocabulary to vocabulary. 
I deal with a number of vocabularies, DDC, LCC, LCSH, MeSH, FAST, GSAFD, Eric, GEM-S, Gates, Sears, etc. 
Most notes are short in these vocabularies. 
The editorial guidelines for the vocabulary can play into the length of notes. 
In Dewey, notes are generally concise. 
Probably due to the fact that there are so many of them. 
The note types are for specifically defined purposes. 
However, when an editor needs to discuss a topic in more detail, Dewey has a section called the "Manual". 
The "Manual" is where in-depth discussions about a class number or a class number in relation to other class numbers goes. 
It's a separate section, distinct from the actual classification notes. 
The discussions in the "Manual" are along the lines of why would you use this concept over these other concepts and the fine lines that the editors draw between concepts. 
The "Manual" notes wouldn't be converted to SKOS because many times they deal with relationships between concepts. 
So if there are multiple concepts discussed, then which one do you associate the note with? 
I guess, if a "Manual" note discussed three classes you could put the same note in all three classes, but I'm not sure that would be useful. 
It borders on the same principal why vocabularies put things into tables, like geographics. 
They can be used in multiple places and it's far easier to maintain in one place. 
The "Manual" also seems outside the scope of what we are trying to do with SKOS and vocabularies, however if we needed to incorporate it with SKOS we would define our own RDF Resource and use dc:relation in the skos:Concept record to relate the concept to the place where it was discussed. 
Part of having finer grained notes allows the API to deliver only what you need and no more. 
So if your audience only needs scope and public notes, you should be able to specify what your need is to the API. 
If you just had just scope, history, and editorial note types, then you could get back a lot of stuff that isn't very useful to your audience. 
That's because the vocabulary maintainer was forced into putting everything into scope notes or a subclass of scope notes.
