Joe, the IBM alphaWork XML4J 3.0.1tells 
me --- snip --- [Fatal Error] _.dtd:_:_: The markup in the document preceding the root element must be well-formed.

Look at the first line of the message. 
It says: "The markup in the document preceding the root element must be well-formed.". 
So, a XML DTD is not even well-formed. 
How can it be a XML instance? 
I know, citing a computer program is a rather weak argumentation. 
But I also studied the "Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0" W3C recommendation (Feb 10, 1998). 
So, I know the XML DTD can be inlined in the prolog of the associated XML instance. 
But as far as I know (sorry, I am not a W3C member) itself is not a XML instance. 
BTW, IBM alphaWork did a very good job implementing their XML parser library. 
The only bugs I've found so far were: - NDATA entity handling in versions prior to 3.0.1 - notation handling in versions prior to 3.0.1

I didn't say that a DTD by itself was an XML Instance. 
It isn't, and attempting to parse it as one will yield errors. 
However, an XML instance can certainly include an internal subset, or can reference an external DTD, and a validating XML parser will handle these. 
If you "just want to parse the DTD", you have to express that request in a format that your parser can handle -- which may mean providing a dummy instance document, or may mean calling the parser differently, depending on your parser's APIs. 
The DOM currently doesn't address how parsers are invoked; DOM Level 3 is looking at that issue as part of the "Load/Save" activity. 
Meanwhile, look at the documentation for the parser you want to use. 
The DOM currently has no standardized mechanism for representing them. 
DOM Level 3 is looking at that issue under the "Content Model" activity. 
Meanwhile, some parsers -- including XML4J -- have custom data structures for that purpose.

And if you use SAX2, most parsers have _standard_ callbacks with DTD information ... - Dave
