<s> In IRC today, Jim Ley suggested decoupling the annotating UI from the RDF repository.  </s>
<s> JibberJim Greg, I think the most important things to agree are the  </s>
<s> vocabulary for the annotations themselves.  </s>
<s> JibberJim and the way of telling the central resource about metadata, either posting raw RDF, or posting a link to some remote rdf, or posting a link to a jpeg containing RDF.  </s>
<s> Does that make sense to people? it would mean that any tool could post to the server (once we have decided on an RDF vocab), although Greg's could remain the 'default' UI tool.  </s>
<s> I offered to temporarily host a put server which would simply take RDF and put it on a webserver for others to harvest.  </s>
<s> Another possibility is to put images on such a server with embedded RDF in them (I'm a bit more reluctant to do that).  </s>
<s> One possibility is to use Annotea.  </s>
<s> I'm happy for someone else to take this on if they would rather.  </s>
<s> If I did it it would have to be temporary.  </s>

<s> One thought is Dan's suggestion that we register the domain w3photo.org.  </s>
<s> Then we can point it toward a server temporarily (preferablly unix/linux) and put photos there, then RDF stuff either there, or on Libby's box.  </s>
<s> I can also temporarily put things on my server.  </s>
<s> With that domain registered, we could more easily move things between machines in the future.  </s>

<s> I very much support this idea -- in fact, what would be really cool in the long run is to be able to see a picture and have it linked to different sets of markup done by different tools - this wouldn't be that hard to do (although I'm not volunteering to support it at the moment) -- the decoupling above, however, would make it possible to migrate in this direction -JH Professor James Hendler http://www.cs.umd.edu/users/hendler  </s>

<s> Greg and all-  </s>
<s> just thought I'd point out that the default "reply" address for this list is to go to everyone, rather than just to the sender -- might I suggest we all be careful about who the responses go to?  </s>
<s> Greg, you might consider changing this so the default is to return to the sender unless one uses a "reply-all" -- from my experience in WGs, it is often the case that one sends a hasty reply intended just for the sender and only later realizes it is going to everyone - the set up where reply goes to sender and "reply all" goes to sender plus list is a nice way to get around this and avoids a lot of embarassing mistakes -JH Professor James Hendler http://www.cs.umd.edu/users/hendler  </s>

<s> I may be in the minority, but...  </s>
<s> All this naming subdirectories and registering domain names that have the word photo in bothers me.  </s>
<s> (w3photo, etc) Since none of the sub-directories proposed were without it, I didn't offer an opinion then, but here goes.  </s>
<s> I suggest that the word photo should be avoided, if possible.  </s>
<s> Because: a) Although the photo bit of the activity is perhaps the most obvious (and where the whole thing started), it is not everything.  </s>
<s> Actually we are trying to create something like a semantic web site for the conference.  </s>
<s> It will certainly be, I hope, an interesting resource to go to for things other than photos.  </s>
<s> b) Who knows where it will be in a few years time.  </s>
<s> It might well have evolved to a beautiful example of how to present a knowledge-enabled web site of a conference series.  </s>
<s> It might even become *the* site for a whole bunch of conferences.  </s>
<s> The word photo would then become irrelevant, misleading (as now, I think) and even embarrassing.  </s>
<s> Surely all knowledge-enabled thingies will be multimedia.  </s>
<s> I'm still not sure what would be a good name, however - sorry.  </s>

<s> Good thinking.  </s>
