Hello translators! 
Hello Martin! 
As You wrote, I checked the mailing archive, und sent a mail to the sender of the messages, but got no answer yet. 
So I decided to finish the translation, as long as my time permits. 
The translation of "Namespaces in XML" into German is available at: 19990114-de.html 
Happy working, Stefan Please check the following mails: translators/2000OctDec/0031.html translators/2000OctDec/0030.html 
If you find out something, please tell us; every existing translations should be listed. 
Regards, Martin.

Hello Stefan, Many thanks for your work. 
Can you please make sure 
that the introduction to your translation says that the English version is the only normative one? 
(you use the term 'Originalversion' (original version), but that does not say anything about normative vs. non-normative). 
Regards, Martin. 
Hello Martin! 
It's fixed. 
The text is now: Die Originalversion in englischer Sprache ist die einzige normative Version: I changed the header of XInclusions, too, and added a sentence, that the use as a normative Recommendation is not allowed, like it is written in the status-section. 
Hope, it?s ok. 
A nice day and happy working!
