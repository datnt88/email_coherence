[Is this a good forum for this kind of question?] 
Question: I was wondering whether there is any statistics available on the use of the WCAG Conformance Logos ? 
I.e. to what extent are these logos used [making claims about WCAG conformance] Presumably this could be detected by pure syntactical scans of web sites/pages Non-Question:: A different question, of more importance though, concerns statistics on *actual* conformance to WCAG? 
I.e. are sites/pages conformant, *regardless* of whether there is a claim or not. 
This cannot be done syntactically [se note in: But we leave this for the moment. 
So is there any data on the Question above? 
Perhaps broken down into types of sites (perhaps gov, edu, com, mil, ...) and into geographical/cultural regions?

Actually, some of these sites are refering to the W3C Conformance Logos, rather than necessarily claiming to be compliant at a particular level. 
I'm hoping next month to be able to revisit my old site and start updating or re-creating some of the content, maybe as part of a blog. 
Karl Hello Olle, I have done some research on this, over time. 
You can use a reverse-link option in a search engine to look at the current status, breaking the search down by different types of domains and different regions. 
In general, currently it is common to see people over-claiming their conformance by one or more levels, which is one reason we encourage people to do more comprehensive self-testing, as described in: - Judy Judy Brewer +1.617.258.9741 http://www.w3.org/WAI Director, Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI), World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) MIT/CSAIL Room NE43-355, 200 Technology Square, Cambridge, MA, 02139, USA Karl, thanks for the URI to your page. 
Your remark is of course valid. 
I.e., when I naively suggested that a simple syntactic check of pages would be enough, is actually not enough, as it fails to distinguish between (1) "claiming conformance via the logo" and (2) "making a reference to the logo" I.e. in (1), the logo is making a statement about the page, while in (2), the page is making a statement about the logo. 
So a little more subtle approach should be taken. 
Perhaps a manual inspection of a random selection of the pages that have these logos, to determine the proportions of the two categories above. 
And thanks Judy for also hinting at how available search engines can provide (albeit approximate) answers to many of our questions about "demographics" of the web.
