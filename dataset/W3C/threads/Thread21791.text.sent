The nearest cyc term is (from previous discussions) cyc:ConceptualWork. 
This something abstract, not concrete. 
The word "documents" has been used on this thread because it is shorter. 
Tim BL You're probably right, but is it also the case that all corporeal things are generally recognized as disjoint from "documents"? 
Books, for example? 
Or these legal papers on my desk? 
I'd say not.

[2003-07-25 20:51-0400] From previous discussion, am I right in saying you'd count "The Bible", "Hamlet" etc as conceptual works; but foaf:Document (the RDF class) or cyc:ConceptualWork (another RDF class) as not being conceptual works. 
If so, what is it about the former that makes them more 'conceptual'? 
Are you claiming that RDF classes are purely mathematic constructs, discovered rather than created? 
I ask because I have several RDF implementations which depend on classes being allowed in httpRange... Dan 1. 
I point you to a whole ontology - check the cyc classifications. 
2. Nothing. 
They are all conceptual. 
Only things which convey information are works, in the sense of opus, oeuvre, something which decreases entropy and hence takes energy to create. 
I make no untestable statements about whether they are discovered or created. 
But I do distinguish them from for example an RDF schema, which has content and can be represented in RDF/XML or N3, can be copyright, etc etc. Could you manage a transition to one in which you use a hash, please? 
It is going to be easier to fix it now than later.

[2003-07-28 11:28-0400] There's the basis of a distinction there, although the connection with the HTTP URI scheme naming policies is pretty weak. 
For FOAF, we could probably pull the switcheroo now with a fair amount of annoyance for implementors. 
But FOAF files also use Dublin Core, RSS1, MusicBrainz, XMP etc namespaces, all of which are named with a '/'. 
Also they use my wordnet namespace... 
The wordnet case is trickier. 
We have a namespace with 50,000 terms (classes) in it, named like http://xmlns.com/wordnet/1.6/Tree 
and dereference-able. 
There is no obvious parallel design with a # that allows both (a) reasonably intuitive end-user markup in the instance data and (b) terms to be individually derferenceable to something useful and smaller than the entire multi-megabyte dictionary. 
Do you really think it's worth pulling the rug out from under the feet of 80%+ of RDF early adopter vocabularies? 
Just as things are starting to take off... Seems risky to me, for a somewhat academic point... If we do it we'll need a damn good explanation for the disruption. 
Dan So if I can try to summarize the positions... 
Both sides agree that using URIs to identify different things should be avoided. 
The pro-hash side suggests that this ambiguity is best addressed by constraining URIs to identifying cyc:ConceptualWorks. 
This has the advantage of simplicity, but the disadvantage that the fragment part of a URI is only seen by the client, not by HTTP intermediaries and servers. 
The pro-slash side suggests that it is best addressed by using a different URI to identify different things, or by being able to make assertions about the results of a GET. 
Intermediaries and servers can see the whole URI. 
From a "Do no harm" POV, the former appears more damaging in that many resources on the Web today aren't cyc:ConceptualWorks. 
Plus it reduces visibility such that intermediaries aren't nearly as useful (they can't tell which resource is being referenced, only which ConceptualWork). Mark.
