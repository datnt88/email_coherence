<s> I have a question about "value" attribute of the Attr interface in the DOM spec.  </s>
<s> If I modified the children of Attr node, is it same or not that "value" attribute content before and after this modification ?  </s>
<s> Must the getValue() always generate "value" from Attr node's children ?  </s>

<s> If you modify the child nodes of Attr node, Attr.value attribute should reflect the changes.  </s>

<s> As I read it, the string "value" of an Attr should always be the concatenation of the string values of its children.  </s>
<s> Changing the children changes its value, and calling Attr.setValue() replaces the children with the new text.  </s>
