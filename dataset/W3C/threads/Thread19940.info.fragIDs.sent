<s> Hi all, Can't find reports of this anywhere.  </s>
<s> Paste function doesn't seem to work across files.  </s>
<s> I copy or cut from one document, then go to the another, and Paste doesn't do anything.  </s>

<s> That's surprising.  </s>
<s> Normally it works but I try to understand what occured when you met the problem.  </s>
<s> I suspect the document where you wanted to paste was not in Read-Only mode?  </s>
<s> Possible eroros: - the Cut buffer was reset when you went to the other document.  </s>
<s> - the Edit- Paste command was disabled by error in the target document.  </s>
<s> If you are able to reproduce the bug, could you check these two points.  </s>
<s> Irene.  </s>
<s> I can reproduce the bug anytime!  </s>
<s> The paste command isn't disabled and I'm in edit mode of course.  </s>
<s> I cut (or copy) from document A, then go into document B, paste, and nothing happends.  </s>
<s> I have just checked, and it only happends if I try and copy more than one element.  </s>
<s> If I copy just a few words, it works OK. Thanks Yan  </s>

<s> I suspect the document you have copied from has been closed or replaced by another one when you try to paste.  </s>
<s> This bug has already been reported.  </s>
<s> It's on the to do list, I guess.  </s>
