<s> As a result of the discussions at the Memphis IETF meeting and WWW6, a new version of the PEP draft has been submitted as an ID.  </s>
<s> I have attached the draft to this mail.  </s>
<s> You can also find the draft as an W3C working draft at Please read and comment!  </s>

<s> I was just sitting down to read through the 23 or so pages of the PEP draft when I asked myself "Why?"  </s>
<s> My original interest in PEP was caused by my work in DAV where I needed to extend HTTP in all sorts of interesting ways without breaking anything.  </s>
<s> In the end however, I discovered the whole effort was largely for not because PEP only works if everyone supports it and currently, no one supports it.  </s>
<s> This would be the famous chicken and egg problem.  </s>
<s> However I did spend some time thinking about what the world would look like if PEP did exist and the answer is "expensive".  </s>
<s> Having to send along a bag with all those options, not to mention writing all the supporting code, just seems like maximum overkill.  </s>
<s> The solution we are using in DAV is to have clients look up a particular attribute to see if a set of features are supported.  </s>
<s> Once you have attributes, PEP becomes largely irrelevant.  </s>
<s> I realize that PEP is a lot more powerful than a simple "check the switch" solution but in all the real world scenarios I am looking at, such as deploying DAV, I don't seem to need anything more than the attribute.  </s>
<s> Has someone else had a different experience?  </s>
<s> Thanks, Yaron  </s>
<s> While I agree with the particular points I don't agree with the conclusion.  </s>
<s> I believe that the problems with PEP could be solved by abandoning the idea of sending meta-protocol information along with the connection data.  </s>
<s> Instead of doing this I would like to see a single tag to define the semantics of any x-tended headers and how proxies should deal with them.  </s>
<s> The tag would be of the form :- PEP-Extension: version url Where version is the version of the PEP specification format and uri is the location (yes it is a location in this case) where the specification can be downloaded from.  </s>
<s> I understand that there are occasions in which this will not work such as intranets not connected to the Internet and intergalactic spacecraft.  </s>
<s> I think that attempting to address these corner cases by sending a couple of hundred bytes of verbiage along with every message is a bit broken and unlikely to fly in any case.  </s>
<s> PEP only specifies the grammar of the protocol, not the semantics.  </s>
<s> It can only solve the problem of proxies and other intermediaries that need to know something about the tags being passed.  </s>
<s> I think the problem of extending the protocols has mainly been that until recently there have not been clients that are extendable.  </s>
<s> NCSA Mosaic has been a long time withering on the vine.  </s>
<s> I think that the new generation of clients may solve many of the percieved problems.  </s>

<s> "Corner Cases"?  </s>
<s> Some of my best friends work with intergalactic spacecraft.  </s>
<s> Not to mention intranets.... regards, Ted Hardie NASA NIC  </s>
