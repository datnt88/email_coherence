Aaron, I note that the RDF/XML MIME registration draft has expired [1] (they do, after 6 months, per IETF rules and practice). 
Could you please resubmit what you have to keep it alive? 
The last known version was -03. 
It would be great if this included the changes agreed since your call-for-review, but anything you have is better than nothing. 
Thanks!

I thought I had submitted it, but it looks like I forgot to change the publication (and therefore expiration) date. 
I've fixed it and submitted it again.
