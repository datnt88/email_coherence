With respect to: 2002-08-23#6 bwm Ensure that WG home page points to current editor working draft documents for WG review From my perspective, I don't want to have to keep updating this page, so I'd like a stable URI for the ed's working draft of each document. 
The current status is: Primer: The ed's working draft for the primer pointed to This however, is a directory with many files in it. 
Frank/Eric: do you want to leave it like this or would you prefer to have a link the latest actual doc, and if so, can you provide a URL for it (or set the directory contents up so that it default to the current version). 
Concepts and Abstract Data Model: Please can the editors of the Concepts and Abstact Data Model provide a stable uri for the ed's wd. 
Syntax: The eds wd points to http://ilrt.org/discovery/2001/07/rdf-syntax-grammar/ 
Model Theory Pat, please could you provide a stable URI for the ed's wd. 
Test Cases: Ed's wd points to http://www.w3.org/2001/08/rdf-test/ Datatypes: At present, no links. 
If folks can let me have the url's I'll fill in the links.

Pointing to the directory is fine with me, unless Eric has some objections. 
Is there some reason Schema isn't in our list?

Oops. Danbri, do you have a stable uri for the schema ed's wd. 
Brian 
I have none. 
We've been date-stamping the files as a means for indicating the most recent so pointing to the directory seems a useful enough means for getting people close enough to the most recent thinkings of the Primer.

Is the editor's current working draft supposed to be: (a) the very latest editors' version that can be updated at any time, or (b) the most recent version stabilized for wider review? 
I tend to find (a) can be confusing for authors and reviewers, though it is sometimes improtant that it be available (e.g. for author collaboration). 
If (b) is meant, I'll need to tweak the web site where it's published, but I can do that easily enough.
