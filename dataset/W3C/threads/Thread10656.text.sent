Williams-02 is the suggestion that we should: - defer to Namespaces 1.1 for the definition of IRI - and globally substitute "[RDF] URI Reference" by "IRI" There is a small substantive differences which is Unicode Normal Form C. On the advice of I18N WG in Cannes we required RDF URI References to be in Unicode NFC; Martin D?rst informs me that they have changed their minds on this one. 
Draft proposal: Change concepts to defer to Namespaces 1.1 defn of IRI rather than have a definition of RDF URI reference. 
Globally substitute "[RDF] URI Reference", "uriref" etc. by "IRI". 
This needs discussion! 
Also, we should e-mail i18n-ig and ask for an official comment from the wg retracting their advice in Cannes. 
Jeremy Jeremy, Remembering DanC's advice from a short time ago, the point of last call is identify issues that folks can't live with. 
If you are going to propose even discussion of a *huge* change, perhaps you might care to suggest why a huge change is necessary. 
Brian Brian: The same substantive change can be made in a more manageable way by: - changing the defn of RDF URI Reference in Concepts to point to namespaces IRI - *not* do the s/URIref/IRI/ This makes it clear that we are trying to play the XML ball, with less textual change. 
Stuart's point that RDF should do be different for the sake of being different, combined with changed advice from Martin about NFC, does suggest the *substantive* correction should be made. 
However, that does not necessitate the *substantial* change. 
If we made the *huge* change I guess we would be the first rec to follow namespaces in so doing, and there's not much harm in not being so. 
I'll think some more. 
Jeremy Jeremy Carroll said: ? 
NFC changed? 
What exactly changed? 
I couldn't find any reference to such a change in the 3rd IRI internet draft linked from the i18n resources area http://www.w3.org/International/iri-edit/ in Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRIs), draft-duerst-iri-03 March 2, 2003 Dave Sorry unclear again .. :( No - the I18N lot decided that IRIs which are not in NFC are OK. 
So the namespaces 1.1 defn of IRI which does not mention NFC is closer to I18N's ideal than my text which does. 
Jeremy I would be *very* wary about adopting the term IRI at this time. 
I was at the IETF URI BOF last week, and there was some discussion of the IRI spec. 
Minutes at: One issue in particular that is not currently clear regarding IRIs is the status of certain US-ASCII characters not allowed in URIs: ( ,  , ", SPACE, {, }, |, \, ^, `) are not allowed in URIs; in the current draft, they are allowed in IRIs. 
XML namespaces 1.1: http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-names11/ 
I also note that this spec does not *define* IRIs, but refers to an Internet draft: IRI draft Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRIs). 
Available at I would say that this doesn't have a cat-in-hell's chance of being on the IETF standards track by the time (we hope) RDFcore goes to recommendation track. 
Hmmm... there's also http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-names11/#IRIs, but I don't think I'd know exactly how to include an IRI containing (say) ' ' in an RDF document based on that specification. 
My conclusion: this whole area is very messy at present, and I'm not sure how we can be confident of getting any alignment with IRI's completely right. 
I'm inclined use some text of our own (possibly copy xml-names11 and clarify the use of "additional" characters), with a note that this may be replaced with a reference to a future IRI spec, rather than indirect through some transient specification in yet another document. 
I note that adopting the IRI per xml-names11 would require a change to N-triples, which has: absoluteURI ::= ( character - ( ' ' | ' ' | space ) )+ -- http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/ntriples/#absoluteURI #g Graham Klyne PGP: 0FAA 69FF C083 000B A2E9 A131 01B9 1C7A DBCA CB5E Yes it does, Definition: Ahh, I made a mistake, they use the term IRI reference not IRI ... Hence the proposed resolution should be to globally substitute URI reference by IRI reference and uriref by iriref etc. Jeremy Oops, I spotted the section you cite later, discussed it, and forgot to change the text I wrote earlier. 
My concerns stand.
