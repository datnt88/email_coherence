Great work! 
Thanks! 
~ Shawn Andrew &amp; Henk, Well, I _did_ work on the business case most of the flight home (didn't even watch a movie, although did sleep a little on the first of 3 flights :-); however, I just finished the first page today (Saturday). 
Thanks much for the copy edits. 
They were clearly indicated, making them easy to fix. 
After my signature is a list that indicates how edits were addressed. 
I spent quite a lot of time integrating the specific checkpoints into the "Web Accessibility Benefits More Than People with Disabilities" section. 
First, I had to go into to WCAG to help match each checkpoint number with the relevant wording (I don't quite have them all memorized :-). 
Then I found that some relevant checkpoints were missing, and so for each group I went through all of WCAG to see if there were additional checkpoints that we should be covering. 
As a result, I have two requests of you: 1. Could you go over this latest version of the "Web Accessibility Benefits More Than People with Disabilities" section of the Social Factors page (http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/bcase/soc.html) and see what you think about the revisions? 
See questions. 
(fyi, version you worked on last week is at: 2. Could you go over the Technical and Financial pages in the next couple of days to: - check if there are other WCAG checkpoints we should be listing - make specific recommendations on how each WCAG checkpoint is integrated into the documents I'm trying to get all the pages of the Business Case done early the week of 15 March - hope to work on airplane again on Tue 16 March (but "don't hold your breath" :-\ Thanks again for your input! 
Please let me know if &amp; when you can do 1 &amp; 2 above.

I am OK with either way, as long as we point to the source that we use for the final decision.

(fyi, version you worked on last week is at: HS  Much better overview because of the lists you made. 
"In addition, assessible sites can be read and navigated by screen readers (for people who are blind) and people who ....." I have two problems with this sentence: you should be able to read and understand a sentence skipping parts withing parenthesis, and the word screen reader is appearing first time in a document that can easely be the first document people read when searching for the sense of accessible websites. 
Proposed sentence in stead: In addition, accessible sites can be read and navigated using a screen reader program like blind people do to listen to sites. 
People who cannot read can also benefit from using those program's by listening to sites.
