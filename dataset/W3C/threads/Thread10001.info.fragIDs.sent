<s> 1. There is a problem I mentioned earlier with literals like "badnumber"^^xsd:integer .  </s>
<s> They have to denote something, but they shouldn't denote a literal value (because they, er, don't, right?)  </s>
<s> The trouble is that until we go ask the datatype, RDF can't tell the difference between one of these and "12345"^^xsd:integer.  </s>
<s> So in the basic RDF MT, we need to say that typed literals denote something but we don't yet know even if its a literal value, so it has to be in IR, not in LV (as at present).  </s>
<s> So what do we do when we find out that it is bad?  </s>
<s> The current draft invents an ad-hoc thingie (a triplet) to be the value in this case, but that is not a good solution.  </s>
<s> Better would be to say that it denotes some unknown but arbitrary thing which, whatever it is, is not a literal value.  </s>
<s> This adds a slightly odd technical extension to the definition of datatyped interpretation, which will now include a new mapping IBL from datatyped literals to things in IR that are *not* in LV, which are the 'things' that the literal will denote *if* it is badly typed.  </s>
<s> So, just a warning, I am going to make this  </s>
<s> change.  </s>
<s> It actually makes the semantic rules easier to state and the Lbase translation more transparent.  </s>
<s> 2. Now that subClassOf and subPropertyOf have 'iff' semantics, that raises a slight complication: it means that anything with an empty class extension, which right now includes anything that isn't a class, is a subclass of anything, and similarly for properties.  </s>
<s> That  </s>
<s> has a lot of unintuitive consequences, and I propose to remove them by *defining* classes to be things that are in rdfs:Class, similarly properties and rdf:Property, and then restricting the 'iff' definition of subClassOf to hold only between classes, and again similarly for properties.  </s>
<s> Summary of fix: IP is defined to be {x: x, I(rdf:Property) in IEXT(I(rdf:type)) } IC defined to be {x: x, I(rdfs:Class) in IEXT(I(rdf:type)) } aaa rdfs:subClassOf bbb is true iff ///I(aaa), I(bbb) are both in IC and /// x in ICEXT(I(aaa)) implies x in ICEXT(I(bbb)) and similarly for subproperty The ///-/// marks the fix.  </s>
<s> This should not change any of the current rdfs closure rules (though if it wasn't done they would need changing.)  </s>
<s> It should have been done this way from the start, so this is a technical fix of a bug, in effect, and I apologize for not incorporating it into this draft in time.  </s>
<s> 3. Recent changes, including the above, require several changes to some of the lemma proofs; these will be fixed.  </s>
<s> Herman ter Horst has kindly checked through the proofs in detail and made several good suggestions.  </s>
<s> 4. Does everyone agree that rdfs:member rdf:type rdfs:ContainerMembershipProperty .  </s>
<s> ?  </s>
<s> I can go either way, but this will require a small tweak.  </s>

<s> I actually happen to not particularly like depending on the fact that EXT is undefined on non-properties to make non-properties not be subPropertyOf every property, so I support the change for properties too.  </s>

<s> I think that I would prefer the interpretation of bad literals to be elements of LV that are not in L2V for any datatype.  </s>
<s> I think that this is just a stylistic preference, but there may be consequences in more-expressive languages (such as OWL, but I can't think of any).  </s>
<s> Perhaps the easiest way to go would be to require bad literals just not to denote anything in any datatype value space, and leave whether they are in LV open.  </s>

<s> There is no  </s>

<s> Right now, it does not; this works only for good literals.  </s>
<s> If we say it does, then is there any way to distinguish good from bad literals?  </s>
