All elements and attributes in RDF must be namespace qualified What is the reasoning for "all elements" being part of this requirement? 
Many current RDF documents use default namespaces properly to default elements. 
Is there a reason for disqualifying this practice?

Art All elements and attributes in RDF must be namespace qualified Hmmm... sounds like a fudge to me. 
If there is a problem with unqualified attributes, then I think we'd do better to disallow them; (maybe use language like "... MUST generate namespace qualifiers, but MAY/SHOULD recognize unqualified attributes"?) #g Sorry for responding so late, your mail got lost in my inbox somehow... Anyway, the result from the telecon[1] felt even fudgier to me: RESOLVED: We'll strongly recommend the use of namespace qualified attributes, and allow but deprecate unqualified attributes. 
Afterwards, DanC asked[2]: stronly deprecate"???? 
I wonder what that means. 
Does the test pass or not? 
I think that if we decide to come up with some system of conformance to the new spec, unqualified attributes should not conform, but I think the practice should be noted and processors should be allowed to support it for backwards-compatibility. 
Hmm, this tightrope-walking bit is tricky.
