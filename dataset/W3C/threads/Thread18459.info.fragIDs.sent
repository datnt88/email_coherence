<s> aloha, ian! one of the problems with the new "distributed" UAAG 1.0 is that it is impossible to ascertain the date of the document one is reading from within a sub-section, unless that sub-section happens to be cover.html this is a really annoying aspect of the chopping up of technical recommendations into bite-sized morsels... why isn't there a W3C Process guarding against this? if date-stamps are important enough to embed in URIs, surely they should be repeated somewhere in a document which "may be updated, replaced or obsoleted by other documents at any time"  </s>

<s> thanks, it's handy I guess but perhaps next chapter or something a bit more descriptive for those of us who are dense migh be better?  </s>

<s> I can repeat the status and date information at the top of each chapter.  </s>
<s> I would note that the more metadata we duplicate the more burdensome it will become to read the document.  </s>
<s> However, date and status label (e.g., Working Draft) seems reasonable.  </s>
