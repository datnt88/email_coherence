Hmmm... Well if literals are resources and all forms of literals have unambiguous and consistent global interpretation then the only thing blocking them from being subjects is the inability to express them as such in the RDF/XML. 
So it would seem to me that insofar as the abstract syntax and MT are concerned, literals would be valid subjects.

entailment. 
That just means a bnode matches a resource or a literal. 
Bnodes say that something exists. 
The above says the literal value exists. 
Things that exist (in RDF) are resources.

* noted that it is aware of no reason why literals should not be subjects and a future WG with a less restrictive charter may extend the syntaxes to allow literals as the subjects of statements. 
Brian Right, but that has ALWAYS been the case. 
The reason for the restriction is because literal subjects would break striped RDF/XML; its a purely syntactic XML issue. 
Just one more way that XML helps to make all our lives just that little bit worse than they could be.
