<s> a proxy is limited kh: this information could be exposed to user agent dd: this an ideal case if other groups cooperated. the current project is a proxy.  </s>
<s> jg: We maybe able to using a script in IE to test some of these principles dd: I would like to know how this would be better than the proxy approach jg: It may be able to support navigation da: the cell relationsip information is important and should be preserved in some types of tables dd: proxy is can do the same as script for serialization da: could proxy add cell navigation through anchors dd: it could be done, but it may clutter visual display proxy can not provide navigation hb: each cell has its own domain, units could indicate the number of row and colum cells dd: proxy server approach will be reviewed by wai groups user agent guideline implication need to be identified kh: i need information on what the user needs jg: repeated specs in current wd dd: we have info from lynx and pwWebSpeak da: there may be times that row by row is better than column by column jb: what about having a do another way button or command dd: support table semantics, second level, organization Opera may implement turning off table display, simple serialization Asking developers to make even simple changes requires testing jg: move current selection dd: Opera uses this technique already supported by screen readers What does screen reader do and what does screen reader do da: dragon dictate does read tables  </s>

<s> hb: look at higher level topics and search jg: overview of direct navigation mk: it is needed da: pages are just weigh stations to somewhere else dd: this can be done with dom, i have seen this kb: not just a question of taking out links mh: customization capability to move to specifuc html tag information, skip over advertising kb: is it still sequential mh: go to next markup target jg: we could use pwWebSpeak mh: we ship with different style sheets mk: different pages want different kb: looked at discussion list on voice input and people complain about tab interface mh: phone interfaces can use audio style sheets da: is this a problem for poorly designed WWW pages mh: semantic information is already help  </s>
<s> dd: UA WD doesn't have information about poor web design like "click here" UA can do alot of potential things da: what about image maps?  </s>

<s> Will the browsers be pre-fetching everything all the time, or only on user mode select and heuristic determination of junk text?  </s>
<s> Least net bandwidth is that user exercises explicit "try harder" function when encountering an under-explained link, and at this point the browser creates a document citation by fetching the HTTP HEAD, that plus the first 1K bytes, or whatever the commercial indexing sites do.  </s>
<s> We can even prototype by vectoring query to search cite tied to this specific URL [ER WG play item].  </s>
<s> Middle ground is that browser has heuristics to recognize simple failure modes such as link text is "click here" and pre-fetch whenever one of these is in current page, or within 10 link look-ahead of currently focused link or some such rule and User has mode control to turn this pre-fetching on and off.  </s>
<s> High end: all links are pre-fetched enough to paint the first screen of text, but at a 'nice' reduced priority.  </s>

<s> Just like waiting for the images to finish painting.  </s>
<s> We could even work on optimizing the servers so that a HEAD+ request was handled intelligently and more efficiently than a general GET.  </s>

<s> I'm confused.  </s>
<s> Pre fetch for a "click here" seems like a lot of effort for something that is already right in front of you.  </s>
<s> When it says click here it always says what to click for in the text immediately before or after.  </s>
<s> Why do a pre-fetch?  </s>

<s> Pre-fetch of TITLE is also important for missing ALT of IMG used in A.  </s>
<s> In both case, IMG with no ALT and "Click Here" A, it's got to be a user decision.  </s>
<s> For IMG, I think it's simple switch more: "enable lookup of missing ALT", for A, it could be more detailed with heuristic pre-fetch or simple on demand fetching of the target title.  </s>
<s> yes, I think Henrik's minibot (http://www.w3.org/Robot/) could be used to determine the optimal number of bytes to pre-fetch from the target HTML page to get to the TITLE string.  </s>
<s> A little explanation here: HTTP HEAD does *not* return the HTML HEAD section, but the server resource "HEAD", which is really meta information about the resource, be it a gif file or an html file, or anything else.  </s>
<s> In order to fetch the HTML TITLE (which contains meaningfull information about the page id most of the time), one has to use what's called byte-range HTTP request, where a specific number of bytes of the remote document is retrieved, and just that.  </s>
<s> The problem is that there is no rule that guarantees that the TITLE is always in the first 250bytes, or later.  </s>
<s> So some experiment needs to occur to identify this "Average Position of TITLE in HTML" function.  </s>
