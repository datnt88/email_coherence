<s> I see this as an "understanding" issue, which you say isn't to be accommodated.  </s>
<s> You seem to be putting words in my mouth.  </s>
<s> I have never said that "understanding" is _not_ to be accommodated.  </s>
<s> I have disagreed entirely with your complete equation of "understanding" with "accessiblity."  </s>
<s> That's not to say that making pages "understandable" isn't a good thing.  </s>
<s> In fact, it's great, if appropriate for the site.  </s>
<s> Making a page more "understandable" may be necessary to make the site usable by the intended target audience.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, as in the case of the W3C site, it may not be an important issue _based on the content_.  </s>
<s> However, "accessibility" doesn't function this way.  </s>
<s> I _cannot_ decide "oh, people without a certain level of visual ability won't be able to access this page;" that is simply an option.  </s>
<s> Sites _must_ be accessible.  </s>
<s> They _should_ be "understandable" to the core audience, and _may_ be "understandable" to an extended audience, but this is not a strict case of "accessibility."  </s>
<s> Perhaps these issues are at the core of our misunderstanding between accommodation to which groups of disabled people.  </s>
<s> Perhaps you're right; you tend to think in terms of "accommodating specific groups of disabled people", and I tend to think in terms of "creating web sites that can be used by everyone."  </s>
<s> (Note the word "can" in there -- I don't _guarantee_ that everyone _will_ be able to _understand_ my website, just that they will be given the _opportunity_ to do so.  </s>
<s> If a blind woman can't access the information, then she can't even begin to understand it, regardless of what level it's written to.)  </s>
<s> If the guidelines are to be labeled as "for disabled people" and to be offered to be included as required accommodations under the ADA,  </s>
<s> This is immaterial; the ADA is one law in one country applying to one set of people, and the WCAG were _not_ written as legal documents but rather as documents _for web designers_ on how to _make better web pages_.  </s>
<s> then there really shouldn't be a choice made to which disabled people (who are already using the web) should be accommodated.  </s>
<s> Everyone should have _access_.  </s>
<s> That's why it's called _accessibility_.  </s>
<s> If this were the Web Understandability Initiative, with the goal of having the entire World Wide Web written at the level a third grader could understand, then things would be different, I'd think.  </s>
<s> If it's an accessibility issue to choose to turn off the graphics, then turning on the graphics is also an accessibility issue.  </s>
<s> But you can't turn on what isn't there, and the guidelines as David listed them, would insure that the graphics are indeed there for those who need and want them.  </s>
<s> Without them, the information is _denied them because of their disability_.  </s>
<s> The information is _available to them_.  </s>
<s> Look, I teach web accessibility classes online.  </s>
<s> I talk to hundreds of web authors and instruct them creating web sites.  </s>
<s> What would you have me tell them?  </s>
<s> "Dumb down your writing because there are people who can't understand it; all content must be written so that cognitively disabled people can understand it?  </s>
<s> Include plenty of graphics in all content, because there are people who can't read who want access to your site?"  </s>
<s> Should all web authors now be _required_ to become experts in communicating with cognitively disabled?  </s>
<s> I think that is far too much to ask, and you are still confusing "accessibility" with "understanding."  </s>

<s> No, it isn't.  </s>
<s> It is _denied them because of their disability_ as surely as information in graphics that aren't alt tagged is _denied_ to those who can't see graphics.  </s>
<s> Then you are an important person for me to convince.  </s>
<s> I would have you tell them to write clearly and simply so that it can be understood by the widest audience, and absolutely include "meaningful graphics" that assist the reader in understanding what is said.  </s>
<s> I would have you tell them to spend as much or more time choosing the graphics for a site as in writing the content so that they help convey the message of the content.  </s>
<s> Tell them that when they use words not readily understood, that they can include links to pictures or definitions to aid the reader.  </s>
<s> Not only a low=level reader would be assistend, by anyone else accessing the information new.  </s>
<s> Tell them that when they are considering their audience, to broaden it to include all people who would be interested in the information, and aim their writing so that it can be understood by the widest, including those who are blind, learning disabled, and retarded.  </s>
<s> As I recently pointed out, "readily understandable" is part of the definition of accessibility in the first dictionary I checked out.  </s>
<s> Check your own dictionary and see if understandability isn't part of accessibility in your book!  </s>
<s> Your course already asks them to become "experts" in communicating with the blind, why not include more people?  </s>
<s> I see your distinction between "accessibility" and "understanding" to be a strawman that is having the effect of dividing folks with disability into groups - those who are invited to the web, and those who are to be ghettoized from the web even though they have gained access and are alreay here and waiting to use it.  </s>
<s> It's a cruel distinction, and you continued use of terms such as "dumbing down" suggests discrimination is at the root of the problem.  </s>
<s> Perhaps it's just too easy to discriminate against people if the person doesn't know some folks in the category and have a personal reason to include them.  </s>

<s> I'm not reply any more on the "accessibility vs. understanding" threads, even though, yes, that does allow free reign for people to misstate entirely what I've said -- but that's okay, I've said enough times already what I mean, and if someone wants to twist my words, hey, have at them.  </s>
<s> --Kynn  </s>
<s> I'm rather inclined to call a spade a spade.  </s>
<s> Prejudice doesn't go away by pretending it isn't noticed, it gets worse.  </s>
<s> While you insist that accessibility as you need it for yourself, is a good thing and call it "good web design", you dismiss the needs of others as "dumbing down" and say it doesn't deserve consideration as part of "good web design".  </s>
<s> Your concept of "good web design" is flawed, and your attitude towards those who need graphics is insulting at the very least.  </s>
<s> You are clearly choosing which groups of disabled are to be accommodated and have excluded some people solely based on your perception of their disability as less deserving than yours.  </s>
<s> If you have another reason for your disccrimination, you haven't made it clear to me.  </s>
<s> Your strawman of the "definition of accessibility" was examined and found flawed since accessibility clearly includes understanding.  </s>

<s> we could argue semantics till dooms day and get nowhere.  </s>
<s> In point of fact as I have written to jonathan and others in private, though I may not share kim's approach entirely, I do understand his point that there is a line between good web design making content available to all and what is proposed which intrincicly locks out some in fact to streight forward access.  </s>
<s> I am not speaking here about a cognative barrier which can be dealt with at least to some degree by making the graphics meaningful and adding multimedia content where appropriate but rather the assumption which states that what is there even though there is no problem in getting at it needs to be re written in such a way as to make it consumable by bridging almost a barrier that is in many senses developmental.  </s>
<s> I say again, follow good design practices, and use any method you want within that to convey information which you feel or know will achieve your goal.  </s>
<s> In doing this however, be quite aware that the road you build will never be traversable by many for whom the original road was intended.  </s>

<s> So why don't people do it?  </s>
<s> Ignorance, mostly.  </s>
<s> Unfortunately too many web designers are either ignorant or lazy, and won't do it right by themselves -- and so some people are suffering.  </s>
<s> Gosh, some people simply delight in being dicks.  </s>

<s> In short, people suck, and most don't care about being "inclusive", so if we put all our eggs in a basket with that label, we'll be screwed.  </s>
<s> The best answer is "because you're not a fool and a moron".  </s>
<s> It's the natural state of people to be cruel and heartless to the disabled, because people (in general) suck.  </s>
<s> This isn't the case, because people aren't "ethical" and "moral."  </s>
<s> Sounds like a really dopey idea.  </s>
<s> The guidelines embedded inline in our home page ?  </s>
<s> Now you're being silly.  </s>
<s> The short-term answer is we aren't doing anything now.  </s>
<s> The long-term answer is it's definitely something we'd want to consider."  </s>
<s> Yeah, and we're also considering giving $100 to the orphanage down the street, too.  </s>
<s> Jeez.  </s>
<s> Another example of sloppy reporting on this issue, especially when they quote ignorant web developers -- who obviously haven't been to http://aware.hwg.org/ -- who say that making a site accessible will "double" the time necessary to make a web site.  </s>
<s> Utter bull$#!+.  </s>
<s> Why, o why, when they interview "web designers", do they always choose the ones who know NOTHING about what they're talking about?  </s>
<s> I mean, would it REALLY be that hard for them to ask someone who actually understands the issues?  </s>

<s> I got the same request through different channels -- as someone who believes that most "anti-web-accessibility" sentiment is due to either ignorance or someone simply being a jerk, it was hard for me to recommend someone who would argue persuasively that web accessibility is a bad thing.  </s>

<s> The cause of inaccessibility is _IGNORANCE_, not a moral fault in someone.  </s>
<s> Web designers WILL create accessible pages if you approach them from the standpoint of "you are ignorant (unaware) of the issue, but here's how you can learn more."  </s>
<s> They will NOT respond if you walk up to them and call them morally corrupt discriminatory bigots, and besides which, that's not even TRUE (they're not).  </s>
