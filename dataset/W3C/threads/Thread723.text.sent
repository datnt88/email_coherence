I am having trouble using this program do you have any siple to understand instructions. 
Gary Hill X1699 Fechheimer Brothers Hi Gary, I'm having trouble seizing the purpose of your mail, do you have any simple to understand questions ? 
:-)) More seriously, I don't believe you'll get a satisfactory answer, if you aren't more explicit about what your problems are. 
What is your OS, *which* tidy are you talking about (there are quite a number, as e.g. JavaTidy, TidyGUI...) What expectations do you have using tidy... 
Or do you find the manual too difficult to read ? 
Tidy's not a web browser, nor a word processor, you know... :-)) CU Norbert __o This was The Megabyte Text Magician - http://tmtm.free.fr

- TUX powered ;-) Hi, I am using JTidy with an XML source file (I use setXmlTags(true)) and I have the following messages : line 2 column 1 - Error: is not recognized! 
line 4 column 5 - Error: is not recognized! 
line 5 column 9 - Error: is not recognized! 
line 8 column 9 - Error: is not recognized! 
line 11 column 9 - Error: is not recognized! 
line 14 column 9 - Error: is not recognized! 
This document has errors that must be fixed before using HTML Tidy to generate a tidied up version. 
... with the following file : chapitre1 chapitre2 chapitre3 chapitre4 Is there anything else to do in order to parse XML file without errors ? 
Thanks, Denis Queffeulou I have found the problem : The class TagTable is a singleton but not the class Configuration and TagTable has a reference on an instance of Configuration. 
This reference changes at each instanciation of a Tidy, so the TagTable references the LAST instance of Configuration created. 
This causes a problem in method TagTable.findTag because the instance of Configuration is not the same as the one used by Tidy, so the XmlTags flag has not the value expected. 
I have transformed Configuration into a singleton to resolve the problem. 
I think it's a bug. 
Regards, Denis Queffeulou
