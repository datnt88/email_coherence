<s> OK? tex The locale in which the service provider is executing can affect the evaluation of the parameters sent are evaluated and lead to faults that the requester does not expect or does not understand.  </s>
<s> Service A is defined on Provider A, running in a Finnish locale.  </s>
<s> Requester A is running in a French locale.  </s>
<s> The Requester is doing a monthly audit to verify it's customers are still in good standing.  </s>
<s> To request the credit information from the Finnish provider in manageable chunks, the requester makes multiple requests with queries of the form: SELECT * WHERE (LASTNAME  = low) AND (LASTNAME  high) and variables "low" and "high" iterate through the alphabet.  </s>
<s> The first iteration is sent as: SELECT * WHERE (LASTNAME  = "A") AND (LASTNAME  "B") Requester A compares the results with its list of customers in that range.  </s>
<s> The audit fails on this first iteration, since the Finnish provider doesn't consider names beginning with either "?" or "?" to be less than "B" but the French requester expects this.  </s>
