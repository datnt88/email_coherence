<s> This latest version represents a marked improvement over earlier drafts.  </s>
<s> Nevertheless, as usual, I have a number of detailed suggestions to make: Checkpoint 2.3.  </s>
<s> The examples are well chosen and innovative, but they could be clarified a little more by explaining what could appear in the markup in each case, and how this differs from the presentation.  </s>
<s> Examples 2 and 3 discuss both the logical structure and the presentation (example 1 focuses on structure except for the mention of italics).  </s>
<s> The point is, however, that the structures (sections, paragraphs, lists; acts, scenes; and objects depicted in the graphic, respectively) can be indicated abstractly in the markup, whereas the presentation is a separate matter: it can be generated by a style sheet according to users' requirements, stored in a separate "presentational" view of the content, for example a graphic or page description language (SVG or PDF for instance), etc.  </s>
<s> The purpose of checkpoint 2.3 is to ensure that the structures are marked up and made available for further processing (navigation, presentation by a variety of devices, transformations of various kinds, etc.).  </s>
<s> Clarifying the examples under checkpoint 2.3 would facilitate comprehension of the distinction between structure and semantics on the one hand, and presentation on the other.  </s>
<s> Unfortunately, these important ideas are often unknown to, or misunderstood by those who do not approach the web with a  </s>
<s> background in SGML, and hence we need to explain the concepts as clearly  </s>
<s> as possible.  </s>
<s> Checkpoint 6.1: this text accurately captures the proposal which emerged from last week's meeting.  </s>
<s> One item in the list of options below the checkpoint concerns me: "a mechanism to enable the content to be processed by the user".  </s>
<s> Shouldn't this read "by the user agent?"  </s>
<s> Now, if we only had a device that would enable all content to be processed by the user (and I will leave it to science fiction writers to imagine how this might work) we probably wouldn't need accessibility guidelines in the first place.  </s>
<s> In the text of checkpoint 6.1 the phrase "by the user" could be omitted without changing the meaning appreciably.  </s>
<s> Checkpoint 6.2 accords with my proposal, but it doesn't take account of Charles' follow-up, in which he specifically suggested adding a note to state that the W3C has incorporated considerations of accessibility into the processes by which its specifications are developed and reviewed; and hence they are expected to meet the requirements of the checkpoint.  </s>
<s> Other organisations may also take steps to ensure that their technologies meet the requirements.  </s>
<s> I am not insisting that this point be added, but merely indicating that it has been raised in discussion and has not been included in the current draft of the checkpoint.  </s>
<s> As a more general comment, the guidelines use a variety of terms to designate what we usually refer to as "the content": ("content", "document", "page", etc.).  </s>
<s> If possible, we should use a single term (E.G. "content") in all cases, unless we intend to restrict the application of the requirement, definition or explanation to only a particular kind of content (a user interface, a structured document, a web page, etc.).  </s>
<s> The Web Characterisation Activity once proposed definitions of such terms as "web site", "web page" etc., and we need to decide whether we want to use these terms (and/or the suggested definitions) in WCAG deliverables.  </s>
<s> See document is apparently only a working draft).  </s>
<s> We could explain as clearly as has ever been done in the history of communication and, by itself this would not have much effect.  </s>
<s> Only a miniscule percentage of people preparing Web sites even understand the  </s>
<s> notion of "structure" in the sense we use it.  </s>
<s> In many cases they don't even acknowledge its importance.  </s>
<s> We must pay a lot of attention to how the guidelines/checkpoints impact authoring tools and how conformance can be objectively determined.  </s>
<s> Love.  </s>
<s> ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE  </s>
<s> It's possible that our notion of "structure" may be limited and may not actually be as "important" as we think.  </s>
<s> It is possible (although likely not dogmatically attractive) that we could have a faulty vision at the same time that we are claiming the rest of the world is imperfect, too.  </s>
<s> (I'm sorry if we are supposed to maintain that anything that comes from the W3C or from TimBL is sacrosanct, I'll try to be better in the future.) --Kynn Kynn Bartlett kynn@idyllmtn.com  </s>
