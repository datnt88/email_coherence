<s> This is a contentious issue, Bill, like all the others.  </s>
<s> The prupose of alt="" is for the author to say, don't render this image, or link, because I have put it in other places.  </s>
<s> So the author who has a row of images to click on, for those people who like icons, can have text links adjacent to those pictures.  </s>
<s> That thoughtful author puts alt="" so the person listening to the page doesn't hear the stuff twice.  </s>
<s> This is good.  </s>
<s> It is the right kind of tool to give the sensitive author.  </s>
<s> Home Page Reader ignores image links with alt="".  </s>
<s> The next version will have a setting (not the default) to override that and announce the image links with alt="".  </s>
<s> We added that setting because authors (like in the test page) were not using alt="" as recommended.  </s>
