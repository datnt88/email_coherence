Hi! I have a question regarding ActiveX Controls. 
Is it possible to embed them in a HTML-dokument an show it in Amaya. 
I?ve read somewhere that Amaya has support for the Object tag, but it doesn?t seem to work. 
I?ve also read that Amaya?s Plug-In support has been deactivated. 
Is this right and if so, where can I get hold of the code for this? 
Is it somewhere in the source code for Amaya which can be downloaded? 
/Patrik Aronsson [DJW:] Netscape doesn't support ActiveX; I think it rather unlikely that Amaya would.

The plugin code is desactivated but is still there in the source tar file. 
See the directory Amaya\pluginlib Irene.
