<s> John asked   Are there any current-generation user agents that don't support text equivalents for client-side image maps?  </s>
<s> That's not a challenge-- it's a question.  </s>
<s> All current user agents support text equivalents.  </s>
<s> On the AT side of things we have JAWS, WindowEyes, and HPR.  </s>
<s> In the browser world we have of course IE, NetScape, Opera, and Mozilla.  </s>
<s> All of these agents render text equivalents.  </s>
<s> However, the little snag is in the combinations.  </s>
<s> WindowEyes and Jaws don't render text equivalents on Image maps unless they are in IE, which makes sense to me given that they were designed to work with IE.  </s>
<s> Roberto said   There are problems Image Maps and XHTML 1.1 browser rendering.  </s>
<s> All the example was done by HTML 4.01 but in XHTML 1.1" My action item was find a test application in the UAAG test suite or build a  </s>
<s> test page according to their example and precedent.  </s>
<s> They did not have relevant test page so I built one.  </s>
<s> They use HTML 4.01 Transitional, I upped  </s>
<s> it to strict.  </s>
<s> The test in question is to find out whether we could remove  </s>
<s> the "until user agents cause" in the (1999) WCAG 1.0.  </s>
<s> Guidelines 1.5.  </s>
<s> (I  </s>
<s> think we should remove it.)  </s>
<s> If the group would like, I would be glad to rerun the test after converting  </s>

<s> I think that would be addressing a different  </s>
<s> issue.  </s>
<s> But I would be glad to do it.  </s>
