At the last meeting last year it was decided there would be a meeting today. 
I am getting up at 5am anyway, but Liddy probably doesn't want to if there is no meeting. 
Also, will there be a properly working IRC channel? 
CHaals Location: 21 Mitchell street FOOTSCRAY Vic 3011, Australia (or W3C INRIA, Route des Lucioles, BP 93, 06902 Sophia Antipolis Cedex, France) We have worked out the IRC chat problems. 
Jan was working from an incorrect IRC address sent to the list. 
We will be minuting to the IRC channel and I will monitor the IRC channel for messages from Liddy. 
Jutta Guess it was good to look at the options: some have phone and fast Internet connection some have phone OR Internet connection some have cell phone and Internet connection some type fast and easily some don't some can't some pay nothing some pay All in all, looking at the group, this suggests that we go with the phone and someone writing minutes? 
I'm happy with that. 
Liddy
