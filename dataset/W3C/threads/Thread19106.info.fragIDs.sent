This : causes Amaya 4.2.1 to crash when the page is unloaded. 
It seems that its freeing boxes which don't exist, but I've not been able to work out a fix for it. 
Is there an easy patch for it ?? John 
I tested this table on each available platforms solaris, linux, win95/98/nt and all worked fine.

Hmm. I just recompiled it on my Linux system, and the problem is definately there. 
Then I tried it on solaris 2.6, and the fault is not apparent. 
So it looks like it's something particular to my version of linux: Linux dugite 2.2.10 #1 SMP Tue Aug 10 19:01:45 MDT 1999 i686 unknown gcc 2.95.2 GNU Make version 3.79.1
