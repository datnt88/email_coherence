Have a meeting thursday with people who are looking at setting up a commercial accessibility testing service in Australia - there is a fair bit of demand for the service. 
Contacting various people about Authoring tools - journalists and developers, although I am also interested in people who are looking to buy accessible authoring tools. 
Received a query from one developer - is there information published by the US governement relating to what things meet requirements like 508? 
Also received a request for information about studies that show that the WCAG works to improve accessibility.

Subject: EOWG meeting this Friday, June 16 2000 EOWG: Please note that at our EOWG meeting last Friday, we agreed to meet again It has been pointed out (thanks, Carlos) that for trainers to have as complete a set of resources to use in their training it must be pointed out to them that, e.g. pointers to the WAI techniques documents must include caveats along the lines of the unfortunate "until user agents..." clause. 
I.e., browser incompatabilities that conflict with the urge to use CSS, etc. should be noted and updated as the conflicts ease. 
However this should not stop us from providing would-be trainers of Web authors and managers with as full a set of resources contributing to accessibility as is possible. 
So when, as I'm sure you will, you contribute submissions for inclusion in the "resources for training" please include any notices of possible problems with their use. 
If we can find *normative* documents from other than W3C sources that might fill the instructor's tool box in this area, we should discuss whether to incorporate their intent and content or merely link to them. 
Several commercial institutions have policies and guidelines in these matters that may differ from as well as amplify our intent. 
So this thread should be used to deal with: suggestions for further inclusions in the training resources list; caveats for the already-included items; discussions about inclusion of "outside" resources in connection with their probable worth and reliability of persistence; should in-line hyperlinks be to externals? 
Love. 
ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE Hi William, The main barriers found to the actual implementation of alternative design techniques using CSS come, unfortunately, from Netscape 4.x. 
Among the biggest problems I found: * All browsers: None or poor implementation of object * All browsers: inconsistent implementation of margin, padding * Netscape: lousy implementation of inheritance; it gives a lot of problems when you try to modify characteristics of an element nested in a DIV, SPAN or TABLE element, among others. 
* Netscape: DIV positioned elements get all messed up when user resizes the window. 
Solvable by reloading the page with JavaScript, which depends on whether the user has JavaScript active. 
* All browsers: implementing LONGDESC looks like SCI-FI * All browsers: different implementation of default font-sizes * And the list goes on and on ... A hope: Opera and Mozilla. 
I will try to make the previous remarks as structured as possible. 
Last week I posted an excellent reference about actual implementation of CSS2.
