thought y'all might be interested in this, given the conversation that's been going about regarding the positive economics of businesses adopting css. 
this is one of the best that i've seen, particularly for large or highly-trafficed websites.

The best I can find for stats is: strategies.net/search-engine-statistic 
s/google-statistics.html -- with 150 million searches per day, saving even a fraction of a K in download time saves a whole lot of bandwidth. 
But I suspect if that were really the reason for using short variable names, they would optimize in many other ways that they are not on their pages. 
The short variable names make for a shorter URL, which is probably more useful. 
i should've specified that the article that i was referring to had talked about the javascript variable names, ie: !-- function sf(){document.f.q.focus();} function c(p){var f=document.f;if 
(f.action) {f.action = 'http://'+p;f.submit();return 
false;}return true;} // -- where i was headed with this was that by using css instead of font 
tags on the economist website, they'd wind up saving significant amounts of bandwidth. 
kevin smith and i were chatting about this yesterday and come up with the following: assuming that they had 12 million visitors per month (david w. said that if 1% of his users were on NN4x, that'd be 
120,000 page views per month.) and replacing all of the current font tags with an external style sheet with a size of appr 2k, then their monthly cost savings in bandwidth is 120 gigs/month. 
that's without tightening up the js, using more css throughout the site, etc. this also ignores caching of the external style sheet for repeat visitors. 
the css replacement would work for nn 4 that had js enabled. 
those that didn't could be redirected to a page that did make use of the font tag. 
based on 10% of the economists visitors using nn 4 and appr 13% of the general surfer not having js enabled, that would come out to 156k visitors/month who were redirected to the font laden page which would be 3 gigs that would still have to be transferred and lowering the savings to 117 gigs/month. 
i don't know how much they're paying for bandwidth, or how much time it would take to maintain two versions of the same page (i'm assuming that the cms that's used there would make this easier to implement and maintain), but figuring those out would give an idea of how much cost savings can be achieved using this (limited) use of css. 
and it's interesting that something as simple as this can still result in a 6% decrease in the amount of bandwidth that you're using to xfer one page.

Hey one thing that crossed my mind was this... Last year I was developing solutions for Rich Media advertising. 
I was looking into TopLayer and other things. 
The thing I ran into time and time again is that these solutions don't work on Macintosh, and with limited results in anything OTHER than IE on Windows. 
When I querried companies about this they all came back with the same thing Why should we spend money developing a solution that works on all systems that costs XXXXX when we can get one that works on 95% (IE users) of web users for half the price. 
Is this the same attitude designers have to web Standards? 
Why spend extra time making sure we've all the tweaks, tricks etc built into our sites when we can build it and know it works in 95% of our visitors. 
Pesonally thats 5% I don't want to loose ... but companies I've talked to .. don't seem to care

Yes but - see below. 
I'm using the 'alternative browser' argument - the Web TV, the mobile device, the generic term "Internet Device" to alert people that there's more to life than just computers (Really???) And that these devices are going to become more popular and will not be just for the geeks and the gadgeters. 
Otherwise why would companies be investing in developing them? 
There's also the language of the Web TV that seems to be standards based - article at Regards John
