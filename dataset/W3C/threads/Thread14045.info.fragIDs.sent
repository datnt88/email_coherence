<s> Hello, Checkpoint 1.5 of the WCAG 1.0 [1] reads: 1.5 Until user agents render text equivalents for client-side image map links, provide redundant text links for each active region of a client-side image map.  </s>
<s> [Priority 3] In the User Agent WG teleconf this week [2], we discussed how the User Agent Guidelines should respond to this requirement (refer to issue 73 [3]).  </s>
<s> The WG felt that requiring "text equivalents" was overly restrictive as a solution.  </s>
<s> The goal, in fact, is for users to be able to activate links in a device-independent manner.  </s>
<s> Rendering image maps links as text is one way to allow desktop graphical browsers in conjunction with dependent user agents to provide access to links.  </s>
<s> But there may be other ways, and the UA WG is exploring techniques on this subject.  </s>
<s> I therefore propose the following rewording of checkpoint 1.5: Until user agents allow users to activate client-side image map links in an input device-independent manner, provide redundant text links for each client-side image map link.  </s>

<s> It seems reasonable to require user agents to support this capability.  </s>
<s> Likewise, it is difficult to envisage how, in a braille or speech context, the active regions of a client-side image map could be rendered other than via text (there may be other indicators, such as audible cues, but surely in almost all cases, a textual label would be necessary).  </s>
<s> I think we need further discussion of the alternatives before accepting Ian's proposal.  </s>
<s> I think that for the moment, the most common way to satisfy the requirement will be by using text in an alt attribute.  </s>
<s> I think that Ian's proposal does not obscure the requirement that links in image maps are accessible.  </s>
<s> I think it misses the requirement that the links are identifiable in a device independent manner.  </s>
<s> With this small change made I think we should accept the proposal.  </s>
