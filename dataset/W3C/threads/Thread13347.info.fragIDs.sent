<s> That's an interesting use for populating the status line using onMouseOver.  </s>
<s> Maybe there are other uses also for this trick.  </s>
<s> For example, you could process a table so that the row and column headings appear on the status line when the mouse is on a cell.  </s>
<s> Folks with low vision could position the mouse there already: folks using screenreaders could use the send-mouse-to-screenreader-cursor command.  </s>
<s> This would also be handy for sighted folks when the column or row headings are scrolled off the screen.  </s>
<s> (see implementation hints in P.S.) Len P.S. This use of mouseover requires wrapping each cell in an A link.  </s>
<s> If anyone tries this there's a glitch you've got to watch which I ran into on my home page http://astro.temple.edu/~kasday  </s>
<s> If the cell isn't a link already, Netscape 4.06 requires the following A href="" onclick="return false" ... You need the href for Netscape to respond to the onMouseOver (something I consider a bug) and you need the onclick="return false" to prevent netscape from trying to go to that href when the user clicks there.  </s>

<s> On www.att.com yes, but not on the Temple site I'm afraid.  </s>
<s> www.att.com has the URLs in separate parameters, whereas Temple embeds them in the same parameters as the text.  </s>
<s> BTW, the A... 's contain onMouseOver="window.status='etc... What are they for?  </s>
<s> Normally when a sighted user moves the mouse over a link, the status window displays the URL that the link points to.  </s>
<s> If that link has been redirected through the gateway, the URL will be awfully long (including all the options etc) and would not fit in the status window.  </s>
<s> The onMouseOver stuff makes it look like it's not redirected, except I put the word "Access" in just to make sure there's no confusion.  </s>
<s> It turns out that most of the people using the gateway around here are fully sighted Japanese (and a few Chinese) who want to look at those pages without needing the fonts (the gateway can substitute a load of gif files and handle the encoding detection automatically).  </s>
<s> And then there are one or two sighties who use it just because they like their paragraphs indented rather than a line left between them.  </s>
<s> Also, I must admit, I've used the status window before.  </s>
<s> I do have partial sight and I don't always want to work quite like totally blind people do; this is the advantage of having something that is configurable.  </s>

<s> Well the first thing to realise is that not everyone has the latest browser-aware screenreader.  </s>
<s> I know several in the UK who rely on seriously outdated technology and we can't all keep up-to-date.  </s>
<s> We'd better not make the thing *dependent* on the use of the status window.  </s>
<s> The problem with the table row/column thing is it requires you to make every cell into what looks like a link.  </s>
<s> This would be horribly confusing and unfortunately I see no other way of doing it, at least not with the status window.  </s>
<s> But I'll have a little play when I get a moment (you never know, Netscape might let you say onMouseOver in the TD tag).  </s>
<s> Somehow I doubt it though.  </s>
<s> It would be easier to actually add them into the text itself, but this could get a bit much in some cases.  </s>
<s> The other problem is, what exactly are the row and column headings?  </s>
<s> Different table authors do different things and it would be naive to assume that they are the topmost row and the leftmost column.  </s>
<s> Some tables have column headings but not row headings, or vice versa.  </s>
