<s> I thought that I knew, but when I listed them all out, my answer was non-intuitive and I realized that there does not exist a complete taxonomy in the current drafts against which I can check my work.  </s>
<s> The XQuery Language draft says "The built-in types of XQuery include the built-in atomic types of [XML Schema] (such as xs:integer and xs:string), and the following special derived types: fn:dayTimeDuration and fn:yearMonthDuration (described in  </s>
<s> [XQuery 1.0 and XPath 2.0 Functions and Operators])." (15 Nov draft, Section 2.4, paragraph 1) However, the data model clarifies that  </s>
<s> "An atomic type is a primitive simple type or a type derived by restriction from a primitive simple type.  </s>
<s> Types derived by list or union are not atomic."  </s>
<s> (15 Nov draft, section 5, paragraph 1)  </s>
<s> [and then attempts to confuse the reader with a digression into the nineteen primitive built-in types of schema] So it seems from the above definitions that XQuery has all of the built-in atomic types from XML Schema except those that are derived by list, plus the extra types that XQuery adds.  </s>
<s> By my count, this means XQuery has 44 built-in atomic types: The 44 types of XML Schema 1.0, minus the three list types NMTOKENS, IDREFS, ENTITIES, plus the two duration types dayTimeDuration and yearMonthDuration, plus the ur-type anySimpleType.  </s>

<s> Is this correct?  </s>

<s> More generally, probably all derived types will be provided through type annotations in the data model -- so xs:NMTOKENS is supported (and built-in to XML Schema) just like any other derived type, but it seems that it is not really a "built-in" type in XQuery, by the terminology in the drafts.  </s>
<s> I am skeptical that I can query "of type xs:NMTOKENS" (or any other list type), since it seems that I am not allowed to use that type as a constructor: xs:NMTOKENS("A1 B2").  </s>
<s> But then again maybe one or both of these are allowed?  </s>
<s> Also, what if I were to query if (@att instance of attribute of type xs:NMTOKEN*) ...  </s>
<s> or if (data(@att) instance of xs:NMTOKEN*) ... Do these queries succeed or fail with att is annotated with type xs:NMTOKENS?  </s>

<s> My understanding is that the three built-in list types of XML Schema are available for use in XQuery as type annotations on element and attribute nodes.  </s>
<s> You can ask: if (@att instance of attribute of type xs:NMTOKENS) ... What you cannot do is to associate the type xs:NMTOKENS with an atomic value or a sequence of atomic values.  </s>
<s> Like the names of user-defined complex types, it exists only as a name that can be used to annotate nodes.  </s>
<s> When you atomize the node, the value that you get back is of type xs:NMTOKEN*.  </s>
<s> I hope I've got it right... Michael Kay  </s>
<s> xs:NMTOKENS can be used in a construct of the form "attribute of type xs:NMTOKENS", because it performs the same role as a user-defined type that can be used as a type annotation for element and attribute nodes.  </s>
<s> You can only use constructors for atomic values, so the constructor is always the name of an atomic type.  </s>
<s> xs:NMTOKENS is a simple type, but it is not an atomic type.  </s>
<s> attribute of type xs:NMTOKEN* means (attribute of type xs:NMTOKEN)* that is a sequence of attributes, each of which is of type NMTOKEN.  </s>
