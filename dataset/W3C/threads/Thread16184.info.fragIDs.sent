<s> Hi, I've noticed people on this list, and within the disability field in general like to use terms such as "This site is very accessible" or "low accessibility" etc etc... Im interested in how we define and measure accessibility and would be interested to hear the comments of people on this group.  </s>
<s> When is a web site defined accessible?  </s>
<s> When it conforms to all the WAI guidelines?  </s>
<s> Or is it when it conforms to 80% of the guidelines, or even if it just passes the biggest problem points?  </s>
<s> Is a site accessible if the most commonly used screen reader can handle it, or when dyslexic people have no problem in changing the font size, style and colour?  </s>
<s> How about if it passes Bobby, or RNIB (or similar) accreditation?  </s>
<s> Or if it is capable of being "rescued" by some of the tools that are being developed, does that make it accessible?  </s>
<s> I'd be interested to hear opinions &amp; comments.  </s>
<s> Apologies if this has been discussed previously, I have had a look through the archives and couldn't find anything.  </s>
<s> Many thanks - Paul Paul Booth, Project Officer, DISinHE Centre  </s>
<s> The Evaluation and Repair Interest Group mailing list with archives at http://lists.w3.org/w3c-wai-er-ig/ has discussed this issue sporadically.  </s>
<s> That is the group whose charter relates directly to this issue.  </s>
<s> An earlier Rating And Certification group mostly noted the perils of going too  </s>
<s> far down the road toward a pass/fail designation without an adequate backup  </s>
<s> for the criterion.  </s>

<s> Accessibility is a spectrum, from "very accessible" to "not accessible".  </s>
<s> (Note that it's possible to be "not accessible", but that there's no such thing as "absolute accessibility.")  </s>
<s> Truth to tell, "accessible" means "_I_ can use it", where "I" is the person talking.  </s>
<s> The goal of accessibility is to make the group of people who fall under "_I_ can use it" as great as possible, and definitely not exclude anyone using a valid user agent, or with a non-standard computer setup, or with a disability of some sort.  </s>
<s> The WAI page author guidelines are a measuring tool to see how close we come to that goal of everyone being included in "I".  </s>

<s> Al, I browsed URL: looking for archives on a discussion of the merits of a pass/fail accessibility designation.  </s>
<s> If it's there, I could not find it.  </s>
<s> Please point me to a few key threads.  </s>
<s> The best I could was URL: Which is short and does not support the consensus you suggest.  </s>
<s> I don't think the stuff on the ER group is old enough.  </s>
<s> This list only goes back to August.  </s>
<s> This is AFTER Bobby dropped its star designations.  </s>
<s> It has not seen much traffic (as compared to the general WAI IG).  </s>
<s> It is my belief that public online discussion on the merits of discrete rankings has NOT occurred.  </s>
<s> I have asked (the WAI list) before to be directed to archives of such a debate.  </s>
<s> (I have also tried, to no avail, to start a new threads about this.) The impression that I am left with is that the "powers that be" (I am not sure who this illuminate group is) reject out of hand a rating system -- despite that this would be greatly favored by majority of us in the trenches!  </s>
<s> sporadically.  </s>
<s> too  </s>
<s> backup  </s>
<s> I did not mean to imply that the group ever reached a consensus.  </s>
<s> Len is the scorekeeper on consensus in that group.  </s>
<s> I am not aware of conclusions having been reached.  </s>
<s> For a more recent data point please look at which reports on a telecon where we did talk about this point some.  </s>

<s> This is a personal answer to a question which, in my mind, involves some very difficult questions.  </s>
<s> It attempts to provide an answer which can be used in most practical situations, and explain something about what the answer means, and why it may not be perfect.  </s>
<s> (Full disclaimer on request...) First, the question is insuffficiently defined.  </s>
<s> I am going to interpret 'accessible' as meaning the information is accessible to adults and/or reasonably developed children, without much reference to the capacity of those people to internalise and understand the information presented.  </s>
<s> (If you think my definition is nitpicking, you are right.  </s>
<s> If you think it is wrong in its assumptions, please explain why in a follow-up.  </s>
<s> If you think my answer is wrong, please do likewise.  </s>
<s> I would like to know...) My basic answer: A website which does the things that are specified in the Page Author Guidelines is very likely to be accessible.  </s>
<s> A website which does something that is counter to a priority 1 checkpoint of those guidelines is extremely likely not to be accessible.  </s>
<s> But there's a catch (or two): The explanation bit: By "very likely" I mean that it is possible to create a website that meets the guidelines but is not accessible.  </s>
<s> Somebody who thinks in terms of laws (a philosopher, lawyer, physicist, hacker) has a basic technical background, and wants to create an inaccessible website which met all the requirements of the Page Author Guidelines could probably do so.  </s>
<s> But a person who was trying to do the 'right thing' and followed the guidelines with a modicum of care is unlikely to accidentally get it very wrong.  </s>
<s> It is true that in order to fit some of the wish-lists of people commissioning (or promising) websites, it may take a very thoughtful and skilled designer.  </s>
<s> But it takes a thoughtful and skilled person to make a skyscraper too.  </s>
<s> We just take it for granted, because we don't let anyone do it if we don't think they are good enough.  </s>
<s> By "extremely likely" I mean that I cannot think of a way it can be done - the guidelines are based on avoiding a number of blocks to accessibility, and if you create such a block then it is hard to do it in an accessible way.  </s>
<s> I suspect that it is still possible, but I leave it as an intellectual exercise.  </s>
<s> The big catch: The guidelines also need to be interpreted, some to a greater degree than others.  </s>
<s> One could say truthfully 'In order to create an accessible site, all that is required is that all the information and functionality of the site can be accessed in a completely device independent way, with a structure that is intuitively clear and comprehensible.' Unfortunately there are not a lot of people out there who can make use of such a statement.  </s>
<s> There are a (dwindling it seems) number of people to whom it is news.  </s>
<s> The guidelines elaborate on the statement itself, and add rationales and some specific checkpoints which are important in practise.  </s>
<s> They even attempt to define how important some of these things are.  </s>
<s> The techniques document outlines many ways of doing these things in the real world.  </s>
<s> This means that the guidelines are a compromise between perfect (but almost unusable) truth, and between complete (and therefore too big to be useable) specification of every detail, in a structure which provides several levels of detail (from the very coarse-grained approach summed up in the three section titles, to the very fine-grained approach of implementing each technique (or a functional equivalent if applicable) relevant to every part of a document).  </s>
<s> Fortunately I think that they are a pretty good compromise.  </s>

<s> I just left a commercial website with the following statement on the bottom of the home page: "This site has passed the Bobby test and is ADA compliant" The site relies heavily on tables, Java Scripts, graphical links (without alternative text links), etc.  </s>

<s> Wow! New Bobby capabilities and we haven't even designed nor programed them yet.  </s>
<s> "This site has passed the Bobby test and is ADA compliant" is something I have not seen before and we would surely discourage page authors from using such language.  </s>
<s> Thanks for catching this.  </s>
<s> Perhaps the site developer is using a future version of Bobby that has benefit of polished page author guidelines, stagnant web technologies (or perhaps a short freeze), and new ADA web page compliance guidelines for all educational, government, corporate and not-for-profit websites.  </s>
<s> I hope that we can catch up soon.  </s>
<s> In the meantime, I was pleased to learn that the page author has been informed of more appropriate language for that home page.  </s>
<s> In case you have not scrolled down on the Bobby home page in a while, we include the following advisory: "True accessibility is ultimately a human endeavor.  </s>
<s> Bobby is only one step in the process of making a site accessible to as many people as possible.  </s>
<s> CAST recommends that web developers use Bobby as the first step to ensure accessible web page design.  </s>
<s> In addition, we suggest the following: -Review the Bobby FAQ page, there are some aspects of accessible web page design that can not be tested automatically by Bobby yet are still important.  </s>
<s> -Read the most current working draft from the W3C's WAI Page Authoring working group.  </s>
<s> -Request feedback from visitors to your web site.  </s>
<s> -Retest web pages frequently with updated versions of Bobby.  </s>
<s> Then on the Bobby page where we provide guidelines on how the Bobby icon should be used, we include the following language: "If all of the pages on your web site receive a Bobby Approved rating you are entitled to use one of the Bobby Approved icons.  </s>
<s> Just make sure that the icon contains the alternative text description: "Bobby Approved" and that it is a link to the URL: http://www.cast.org/bobby.  </s>
<s> We ask that you download the Bobby Approved image you wish to use from this web page and place it on your own server."  </s>
<s> I suspect that we will need to expand our description of what it means to be Bobby approved for our next release.  </s>
<s> I am also beginning to favor a recommendation made by Gregg Vanderheiden that we also require a manual review of the small number of priority one items that Bobby is not capable of testing.  </s>
<s> The number may be small but each priority one item is considered critical.  </s>
<s> Today, Bobby approval relates directly to what Bobby can test.  </s>
<s> It would be better if it really meant that all priority one items had been achieved.  </s>
<s> We hope that the WAI-ER group will be able to help us with this issue.  </s>
<s> Your thoughts and suggestions are always welcome.  </s>

<s> Please correct me if I am wrong."  </s>
<s> WL:: Actually IMO this forum and the associated Working Groups are multi-faceted.  </s>
<s> The Guidelines Group defines what needs doing, and to some extent how to do it; the Authoring Tools Group tries to get those who design such tools how to help their products produce accessible sites; the Evaluation &amp; Repair Group tries to design tools that will be useful both in defining when a site is accessible and perhaps even furnish aids in achieving that goal; the Education &amp; Outreach Group tries to get all this information widely disseminated; the Interest Group tries to get a feeling from those with an interest for how to go about all these tasks.  </s>
<s> In addition we have a User Agent Group who try to influence such things as browsers, etc. and a Coordination Group that tries to keep all these efforts synchronized.  </s>
<s> If we cannot adequately define what we mean by accessible, we will be ignored and ridiculed - as we should!  </s>
<s> Love.  </s>
<s> ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE  </s>
<s> Rob, Good point.  </s>
<s> We generally suggest using the HTML 4.0 setting for the on-line version of Bobby and we have been thinking that it may be necessary to expand upon why the settings are important when using either the on-line version or the downloadable application.  </s>
<s> We would welcome suggestions from anyone on the list with regard to settings and language.  </s>
<s> Of course no combination of settings will provide ADA compliance since no authentic standard has been established.  </s>
<s> I was surprised to see that "policy types" were telling people to use Bobby.  </s>
