I hope we can all perform an exercise similar to the one I'm posting herein - propose versions of the "Principles". 
On balance I think these are becoming general enough to apply to many forms of communication - not just the Web (and certainly not just HTML!). Convey semantics using content, structure, and markup (or data models) - not presentation. 
Permit user modifications of (recommended) default presentations. 
Design user interfaces for device independence. 
Assure content availability across sensory modalities. 
Love. ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE 
I prefer your "provide for" to my original "permit". 
"Sensory modalities" will be clarified in guidelines immediately beneath this. 
Love. 
ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE 
How about making this one a bit stronger with Provide for user modifications ..... Permit is passive and for the most part providing for this requires some action. 
I am still having trouble with this - "across sensory modalities" seems like one needs to provide something for all the senses (not a bad idea but ...) Marti
