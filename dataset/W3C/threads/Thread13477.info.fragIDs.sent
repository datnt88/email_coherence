Hello, Len Kasday raised the following issue regarding technique 3.5.1 in the 21 December draft [http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/IG/ert/ert-19991221.html blockquote | 1. 
The first header element in the document must be H1 | 2. There must be only one H1 element in the document 
Since a document may be part of a higher-level document, the requirement to have any, or even only one H1 element in a document, is too constraining. 
My preference is that a document should complete a level, in other words, if it starts with Hn , it should end with /Hn and not contain any Hm ... /Hm where m, n in 1, 2, ... 6; and m  n. 
That would allow a reasonable way to make the set of pages with textual content nest consistently. 
In the set, the "top-level" document could have just one H1 ... /H1 . 
The concept of a document manifest, containing a correctly nested set of page references, is part of the open e-book work. 
In it, presumable the document's pages are ordered, and their contents may have nested levels of detail, referenced at appropriate places, either in the manifest or in pages. 
In most pages today, many references are to pages that are not strictly part of the logic of the current document. 
For these, the expectation that they have H1 ... /H1 is certainly acceptable. 
Technique 3.5.1 
[priority 2] Check document for header nesting Discussion Status: awaiting discussion Evaluation: Header elements (H1-H6) should be checked to ensure they are nested according to the following rules Header levels must not increase by more than 1 level. 
Example: H2 following H1 is good. 
H3 following H1 is bad. 
Would have to check any internal references to other docs to see if they contribute correctly nested material. 
Many referenced pages are "out of the hierarchy", so somehow they would need to be exempted.

This doesn't work for HTML. 
H1 etc are not container elements, so a document will not end with the same level header as it started with (except in exceptional circumstances) I agree with the general idea I think - that a page which has H1 H2 H3 H3 H2 H3 H3 would be ok, as would a page that had H3 H4 H5 H6 H5 H5 H6 H4 H5 H4 H4 but not a page that went H2 H1 H3 H4 H3 H4 (unless specified by the author. 
There are legitimate use cases for having H2 H1 H2 I suspect, although they may be presentational.) Charles McCN

Also, from a practical viewpoint, it will depend on how existing browsers handle headers. 
By "browser" I mean a standalone speech enabled browser or a combination of standard browser and screenreader. 
For example, if a browser has a function "Jump to the next highest level heading" which will jump through the H3's if those are the highest, then having top level H3's is OK. 
However, if the browser only has a function "Jump to the next H1" or "Jump to the next H2" Jump to the next H3, etc. then the user has to figure out what the top level heading is, say H3, and use that particular command. 
In that case, having top level headings of H3 is not good. 
Does anyone know offhand what the navigation situation is?
