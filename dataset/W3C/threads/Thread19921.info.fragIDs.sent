Is there a linux binary distribution suitable for use with Mandrake and the KDE? 
Also, is it stable -- preferably stabler than the DOS one?

You can download the amaya RPM from here: then install it (as root) with 'rpm -ivh amaya-2.4-1.i386.rpm'. 
You will need to create a KDE launcher manually, though. 
Your KDE help files will show you how to do this, I believe.

Okay, thanks. 
And how stable is it? 
The Windows version, last I checked, crashes quite often... is that because of Amaya's notorious tangles of void pointers and blind pointer dereferencing, or because of buggy Windows APIs and system libraries, or a combination of both?
