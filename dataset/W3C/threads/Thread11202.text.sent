The ERB schedule calls for voting on Feb. 26 on these items. 
It seems to me that these can sanely only be discussed collectively. 
It is multi-part and multi-dimensional, but none of the parts seem really orthogonal to any of the others. 
If people wish to take up sub-questions in detail, this is welcome. 
I encourage creativity and discipline in the use of subject lines to enhance the usefulness of the discussion. 
Dimension 1: Which pieces of information should be specified for possible inclusion in linking elements? 
b. Type c. Role d. locator e. caption f. behavior g. locator scheme (e.g. URL, FPI, TEI locator) h. 
others [nominations encouraged] For each of the pieces of information to be included in linking elements, the following questions apply: (i) should it be optional or required? 
(ii) should it be associated with links or allowed to vary per locator? 
(iii)should it be carried in the GI, in an attribute name, or in an attribute name-value pair? 
(iv) should we predefine a set of values? 
(v) if so, should we provide a mechanism for "subclassing"? 
(vi) should we allow the use of values other than those predefined or subclasses thereof? 
All of those, i.e. NOT 'behaviour', and no others. 
All optional except locator. 
Type is per link element, locator and scheme per explicit resource (i.e. one in (simple) links, one per locator element in mlinks); caption and role per resource (i.e. two in links (see previous message about name collision) and one per locator element in mlinks). 
All in av-pairs. 
Type: no, just a syntax, as before: a(.a)* Role: ditto. 
Locator scheme: a minimum set, not closed. 
Locator: no, just a syntax per scheme, by reference to relevant standard Caption: CDATA Implicit in answers above.

ht (Whatever happened to a in this list?) (i) Required - must be a member of a set of XML-defined types (ii) One per link (iii) attribute name/value pair, e.g. linktype=xlink (iv) Yes (v) Yes (vi) No (i) Optional (ii) One per locator (iii) attribute name/value pair, e.g. role=source (iv) No - but we could define a useful starter set (as per REV/REL in HTML) (v) N.A (vi) Yes (i) Required (ii) One per locator (iii) attribute name/value pai, e.g. locator=.... (iv) N.A (v) N.A (vi) N.A (i) Optional (ii) One per locator (iii) attribute name/value pai, e.g. purpose=.... (iv) N.A (v) N.A (vi) N.A (i) Optional (ii) One per link (iii) attribute name/value pai, e.g. behaviour=.... (iv) No - but we could define a (small) useful starter set (v) Yes (vi) Yes (i) Optional (ii) One per locator (iii) attribute name/value pai, e.g. scheme=.... (iv) No - but we should define a starter set as being TEI + whatever Internet offers (v) Yes (for MIME-types!) (vi) Not for 1.0, but we will need to later when DSSSL/SDQL becomes popular) Up to implementations to add as required: should not be added to 1.0 definition Martin Bryan, The SGML Centre, Churchdown, Glos.

URL. 
Inclusions of other types should be considered for XML 2.0 contingent on the results of work in the URL working groups. 
Locator schemes outside the IETF definitions are not Internet locator schemes. 
Where a resource is identified by a scheme for which there is not a URL-based scheme (eg., FPI) it should not be considered a locator. 
It should be considered an identifier. 
The notion that an Identifer=Locator is not sound. 
Not now. 
Let the implementors work with the above. 
Then determine what else is viable.
