Another question. 
For the frames, if the NAME attribute is explicit, is the title attribute mandatory ? 
thanks again for your help.

WCAG says that the names have to be clear enough to make it obvious what is happening. 
"nav" is not obvious, but "site navigation" or is more so. 
The name attribute can not include spaces, so in many cases you will want to use a title attribute (you are writing for people to read, where french may not be their first language - avoid being 
cryptic - which is a P1 checkpoint). 
But I can't see anything in WCAG that makes it compulsory to use the title attribute. 
need a title to expand further. 
(Make sure the ads are accessible though - everyone wants to be able to ignore them, but also when they try to find out what is being advertised they like to be able to. 
It is also helpful to provide noframes content that makes the site workable anyway. 
There are examples of this "in the wild" (i.e. on Websites that don't make any particular claim to be accessible) but they are rarer than they should be.

The wording is 'title', but I interpret it to mean using the name attribute as well. 
Surely we should do both. 
I know JAWS uses the name, but the name of an element is not really intended for human consumption, but for the browser. 
I think this is analogous to the way that when an image has no ALT text, JAWS reads out the filename. 
It was the best it could do in the early days, before titles and alt text. 
12.1 Title each frame to facilitate frame identification and navigation. 
[Priority 1] For example, in HTML use the "title" attribute on FRAME elements.
