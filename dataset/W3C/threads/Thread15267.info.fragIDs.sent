We're a go to meet by teleconference tomorrow, January 8, from 15:00 to 16:30 UTC (10:00am to 11:30am US Eastern/7:00am to 8:30am US Pacific). 
The conference information is: Passcode 9224 
This meeting will be to discuss the Techniques requirements draft that was sent around on January 2. Mainly I expect we will raise issues, some of which has already been done on the list. 
We may be able to resolve some issues as well, but more importantly I'd like us to arrive at changes to the 
document we'd like to see (including logging issues as open) before posting 
it as a public draft. 
There may be issues of process for us to discuss, some 
of which we can discuss in this call and some of which may need to defer to 
a whole-group call.
