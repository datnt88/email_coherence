<s> The simple thing is what Yoran wants -- a new _registered_ header name which must be understood by the server or rejected.  </s>
<s> I would suggest something like this: Man: Registered-Header1, Reg-Hedr2, 23-, 35-  </s>
<s> Extension: URL1; ns=23, URL2; ns=35  </s>
<s> For registered header, no "Extension:" is needed.  </s>
<s> The only complication in Man over what is required for simple mandatory registered headers is that "23-" is a prefix, not an exact match whole header.  </s>
<s> The concession to decentralized extensibility is that "Extension" does not have to be listed in the Man header.  </s>

<s> This is an unavoidable problem when multiple extensions share a single, global header field space and no central registry can hinder this.  </s>
<s> The alternative is to pass all extension information as parameters: M-GET / HTTP/1.1 Host: foobar Man: "http://screwball.org/skidoo.html";  </s>
<s> Skidoo=abc, "http://nutcase.org/skidoo.html";  </s>
<s> Skidoo=def which avoids the problem altogether.  </s>
<s> I highly prefer this alternative of passing all extension info as parameters in the Man header.  </s>
<s> Dynamically allocating collision-free headers is so difficult that is is not worth the trouble (see my comments on an earlier PEP draft for a discussion).  </s>
<s> Why add a complicated indirection layer if you do not need one?  </s>
<s> If people really want headers, the draft can tell them to register them in the upcoming IANA header registry.  </s>

<s> The difficulty with: Man: Register-Header is that it doesn't convey what _version_ of the definition of Registered-Header you are using.  </s>
<s> If, for example, I wish to send: Scooby: dooby; doo  </s>
<s> Where 'Scooby: dooby' was defined by RFC4000 and the 'doo' extention was defined by RFC4100.  </s>
<s> What I want to express is that you should reject the request unless you understand RFC4100, not that you understand some older version of the Scooby header.  </s>
<s> So I would add: Man: http://ietf.org/rfcs/rfc4100.txt  </s>
<s> As for headers, it might be usefull for me to add: Vary: Scooby so that intervening proxies would understand that the response to this request also depends on the Scooby header - that way the proxy can do the right thing even if it does not implement 4100.  </s>

<s> Somewhat verbose, alas, but a little more compact than a URL, and perhaps more robust.  </s>
<s> Note that this is still not quite enough, unless we make a rule that this means "unconditional compliance" to the referenced RFC.  </s>
<s> Which is not such a big deal; if RFC4100 has some SHOULDs as well as MUSTs, then one can write RFC4101, describing a particular profile of requirements from RFC4100, and then use urn:ietf:RFC:4101 instead.  </s>

<s> Vary is undefined in a request.  </s>
<s> Maybe we need a more symmetrical mechanism?  </s>
<s> Or maybe we need a different mechanism.  </s>
<s> For example, either the response or response could say: Cache-Control: no-cache, except-if-man-ok where "except-if-man-ok" means "ignore no-cache if the caching agent implements the extensions listed in the Man header".  </s>
<s> This kind of overriding is explicitly allowed in HTTP/1.1, if I recall correctly.  </s>
<s> -Jeff  </s>
<s> This would only be necessary if the Scooby header had been registered in IANA multiple times as different versions with different semantics.  </s>
<s> I guess this could happen - the redifinition of the Accept-Encoding header field could count as different versions, for example.  </s>
<s> Otherwise, Man: Scoopy would indeed point to the header field registered by IANA and nothing else.  </s>
<s> URIs should always be made as persistent as the objects they point to, which is independent of the syntax.  </s>
<s> Yes indeed - I would imagine that RDF (Resource description Framework) [1] will be used to describe exactly which features are supported by a particular name.  </s>
