Dear translators, could tell me if I need to translate into my language the following things: 1. W3C recommendation picture (W3C-Rec.GIF) 
2. Comments in *.DTD, *.DCL, *.SOC, *.ENT files? 
Thank you. 
Croll. 
Some of us must be sacrificed if all are to be saved.

Nobody has translated these up to now. 
I recommend that you don't translate them. 
Yes, these may (and probably should) be translated. 
You should add a note saying that the comments have been translated. 
I don't know exactly what kinds of files these are, sorry. 
Regards, Martin. 
Yes, as these pertain to our trademark, they should not be altered.
