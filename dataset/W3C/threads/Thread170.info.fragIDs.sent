How do I turn the table summary warning off? 
I promise, my internal web pages will not be read by aural browser.

1. Use an HTML version earlier than 4.0 2. Use table summary="" 
3. Hack tidy to not issue this error message (your documents will not be compliant with the DTD still) 4. tidy file.html | grep -v The.table.summary.attribute.should.be.used (your documents will not be compliant with the DTD still) 
You never know :-) Klaus Johannes Rusch KlausRusch@atmedia.net 
Actually, the summary attribute is not required by the HTML4/xHTML1 DTDs, so your documents will still be compliant when you omit it.
