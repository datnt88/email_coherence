<s> Character entities are recognised by starting with an ampersand.  </s>
<s> Any ampersand that doesn't introduce an entity (such as those in URLs) needs to be encoded as '&amp;amp;'.  </s>

<s> About the same problem, JTidy transform this code : a href="search.asp?quicksearch=&amp;titre=tintin&amp;auteur=&amp;genre=&amp;editeur=&amp;collectio n=&amp;tri=ALPHA&amp;source=NEUF&amp;rang=25" IMG src="../../img/fleches.gif" width="9" height="13" border="0" alt="suivant" /A into : a href="search.asp?quicksearch=&amp;amp;titre=tintin&amp;amp;auteur=&amp;amp;genre=&amp;amp;ed iteur=&amp;amp;collection=&amp;amp;tri=ALPHA&amp;amp;source=NEUF&amp;rang;=25" img src="../../img/fleches.gif" width="9" height="13" border="0" alt="suivant" /a The problem is the end of the HREF : ...NEUF&amp;rang;=25 That should be : ...NEUF&amp;rang=25  </s>
<s> This cause a URL that does not work because NEUF&amp;rang;=25 is converted into NEUF?=25  </s>
<s> I suppose the reason why Tidy do this is because &amp;rang is an entity ????  </s>
