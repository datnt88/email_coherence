work? 
Hello - Please write to w3c-translators@w3.org for your question. 
Regards, Martin. 
Could you please let me know whether there is a translation of XML 1.0 recommendation being worked on presently? 
I checked your site and it doesn't seem that there is one completed? 
I am helping on the documentation of a XML editor program and it would be extremely helpful and important for my translator to use the accepted terms for XML specs. 
I appreciate your help on this! Thank you in advance!

Hello Matthew, 
Please note that terms showing up in translations may or may not be 'accepted terms'. 
In some cases, there are already accepted terms, and translators are familliar with them. 
In other cases, there are just no accepted terms as of yet, and translators have to come up with some, which is quite a difficult task. 
Some of these terms may end up to become well accepted; some others may not. 
Finding good new terms is hard work, with quite a bit of trial-and-error involved. 
If anybody on the list has some experience from his/her translation work with creating/selecting terms, please share! 
Regards, Martin.

XML 1.0 recommendation in the work?) 
I've translated the WCAG and I'm now localizing the Mozilla browser into Norwegian. 
One resource I've found of great help in this work, is the Microsoft's translation glossaries at URL: ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/developr/msdn/newup/glossary/  . 
These contain translations for every word and phrase in all Microsoft products (Windows, Word, Internet Explorer &amp;c.) (which have been translated into your target language). 
I'm not sure it contains much info on XML terms, but at least the IE glossary should contain some web related terms. 
Novell URL: ftp://ftp.ege.edu.tr/pub/Novell/updates/tresorce/gloss/ has also released their glossaries. 
There are much smaller then the MS ones, but still useful. 
And at URL: ftp://dev.apple.com/devworld/Tool_Chest/Localization_Tools/Apple_Intl_Gl 
ossaries  , you'll find the official MacOS glossaries, available in 34 languages and several different formats.
