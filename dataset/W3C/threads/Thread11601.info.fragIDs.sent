<s> Could you please let me know whether there is a translation of XML 1.0 recommendation being worked on presently?  </s>

<s> Hello Matthew,  </s>
<s> Please note that terms showing up in translations may or may not be 'accepted terms'.  </s>
<s> In some cases, there are already accepted terms, and translators are familliar with them.  </s>
<s> In other cases, there are just no accepted terms as of yet, and translators have to come up with some, which is quite a difficult task.  </s>
<s> Some of these terms may end up to become well accepted; some others may not.  </s>
<s> Finding good new terms is hard work, with quite a bit of trial-and-error involved.  </s>
<s> If anybody on the list has some experience from his/her translation work with creating/selecting terms, please share!  </s>

<s> XML 1.0 recommendation in the work?)  </s>
<s> I've translated the WCAG and I'm now localizing the Mozilla browser into Norwegian.  </s>
<s> One resource I've found of great help in this work, is the Microsoft's translation glossaries at URL: ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/developr/msdn/newup/glossary/  .  </s>
<s> These contain translations for every word and phrase in all Microsoft products (Windows, Word, Internet Explorer &amp;c.) (which have been translated into your target language).  </s>
<s> I'm not sure it contains much info on XML terms, but at least the IE glossary should contain some web related terms.  </s>
<s> Novell URL: ftp://ftp.ege.edu.tr/pub/Novell/updates/tresorce/gloss/ has also released their glossaries.  </s>
<s> There are much smaller then the MS ones, but still useful.  </s>
<s> And at URL: ftp://dev.apple.com/devworld/Tool_Chest/Localization_Tools/Apple_Intl_Gl  </s>
<s> ossaries  , you'll find the official MacOS glossaries, available in 34 languages and several different formats.  </s>
