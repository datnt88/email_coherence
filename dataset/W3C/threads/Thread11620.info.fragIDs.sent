Dear translators and staffs. 
We are a Japanese translation team and have started translation of HTML 4.01 spacification at http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~sd5a-ucd/rec-html401j/ . 
If you want to help us, you are welcome. 
And offers of joint work, espaccially from JIS technical reports editors, are very welcome.

Dear translators and staffs. 
We just have finished.

Many thanks for all your work! 
The actual spec is at Can you please change it so that the necessary disclaimers as required by W3C appear on cover.html, and please also on all the chapter pages? 
Also, can you confirm that the cases where you, as you say in your header page, corrected errors from the original specification in the translation without waiting for this to be accepted as an erratum are very clearly marked as such? 
Regards, Martin. 
We are sorry that our document was inadequate for IPR. 
We have changed all pages.
