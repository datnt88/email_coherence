Hi Folks, I'm working on a form and the TAB key seems to work - but only up to a point. 
The cursor gets stuck in a form field. 
Can't quite figure out what the problem might be. 
Any thoughts?

Anthony, Please provide more background info and perhaps a sample of the source code? 
Regards Matthew Ogston Protect your PC - get McAfee.com VirusScan Online The most likely cause is some script trying to change the focus, look for things like onblur="this.focus()". 
You could also try disabling script and trying to tab again, to see it definitely is that. 
Cheers Tom Gilder Hi Tom, Yes - it's a problem with the event handler. 
Mind you, the real problem is in the design of the page, which doesn't actually require a text field to communicate the information on the page. 
Either way, it's an easy one to fix - thanks for your help.
