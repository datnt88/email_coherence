Comments (part 3) on: The page I experimented with is at (It still needs work)(I haven't touched the footer navbar) I don't see the value of the bullets in the navbar. 
(I won't repeat suggestion made in earlier messages) There's no reason to include the message headers in the pre . 
Only the body of the message needs to be pre . 
Message pages are very noisy. 
Your primary aim is to read the message, the other things are secondary; yet you have to do a lot to get to the message body. 
I have experimented with quietening them down. 
The information is still there (in the titles), but not so in your face. 
See other changes on the example page mentioned above. 
General comments on navigation. 
I note that the hierarchy of the lists are as follows: 1: Archives (many lists) 2: List (one particular list) 3: Sorted view (by author, by date, etc) 4: Message. 
Looking at the navigation you can always get from level n to level n+1. 
You can get from 4 to 3 You can get from 4 to 1 You can get from 3 to 1 But you can't get from 4 to 2, from 3 to 2, or from 2 to 1: level 2 seems to be level-non-grata. 
You can only get to it by going to 1, and then down again, and from that level you can only get to its parent by going down one level, and up two (which I often end up doing). 
I suggest that level 2 be treated as a first class citizen, so that you can get to it from all its descendents, and you can get from it to its parent.

: See my reply to your previous mail. 
Hmmm... 
I'm not sure I agree. 
I like the idea of having most of the email preserved as is in the pre tag. 
Could you give more input on this? 
Your version is interesting, but some things won't work in production mode: for instance, a message can have several "Next" and "Next in thread" messages: how would you incorporate them in one list? 
yes, you can. 
The link "this list, more time" is supposed to link to 2 in 3 and 4. I don't think that there is a so strong relationship between 2 and 1. See my reply to David's mail: Dom From: "Dominique Haza?l-Massieux" dom@w3.org 
body Oh, I'm very sure of this one. 
The only reason that mail messages need to be in monospace is that some people do layout with whitespace. 
Monospace is a relatively difficult-to-read font; proportional spaced fonts are always easier to read. 
However, there is nothing in the headers that require you to display them in monospace. 
Therefore, to make a more readable page, you should minimise the amount in monospace by displaying the headers in proportional. 
See my example at http://www.cwi.nl/~steven/w3c/lists/ml-message.html (I also reduced the size of the Message-id line, because it contains no readable information, but you might want to refer to it on rare occasions.) 
(In an ideal world I would like to choose per email if it is in a pre or not. 
Look at weep). 
I don't think I ever saw more than one [next]; I have seen more [reply]s though. 
What's hard about [next] [previous] [in reply to] [next in thread] [reply] [reply] [reply] Are you sure? 
Because of the word 'more', I assumed it meant a different version of level 3. (I couldn't try it because the link didn't work). 
But I thought David's suggestions were really good. 
I think there is a strong relationship between all the levels, and I use them all (and would use the missing ones if I could, and often get annoyed that I can't navigate easily to level 2).

13:14, Steven Pemberton a ?crit 
: OK, good point. 
I'll implement that too. 
A suggestion then: we could add an alternate stylesheet removing the pre-formating of the pre element. 
What do you think? 
Right, I realized that I was wrong and that only "reply" could have several instances. 
In my new proposal (http://www.w3.org/2002/03/archives-improvements/ml-message), 
I have added a link [ replies ] to the list of replies at the bottom of the page. 
Yes, I'm sure. 
The link has been changed to say "more about this list". 
I think that's clearer. 
Are you really using http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/ ? 
I find it unusable. 
I have added more background to my comments if you're interested: Dom Dominique Haza?l-Massieux - http://www.w3.org/People/Dom/ W3C's Webmaster or Cool! Sure. 
What's the alternative?

: Hmm... Implemented it in result is not as cool as I would have hoped since we lose all the formating by moving from white-space:pre to white-space:normal, and especially we lose the separation in paragraph. 
So, unless there is a way that some br/ be added where there is line returns on the original mail [well, I guess there is a way, but an easily implementable way], I'm not sure it would really be useful. 
Steven, any other idea? 
Well, I usually go to mailing lists through my bookmarks, and, the first time, through a link in the relevant page [working group, announcement]. 
For public mailing list, I usually prefer http://www.w3.org/Mail/Lists even though it's not complete. 
But http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/ is really the worse for me. 
But I understand that you and others find it useful. 
I hope we can find a good way too integrate it in an hypothetical navigation bar. 
Dom Dominique Haza?l-Massieux - http://www.w3.org/People/Dom/ W3C's Webmaster I use it and its peer in Member space all the time. 
How are you trying to use it? 
It's the way I find out how they spelled the name of some list I am looking for, including when I don't know if it is Member or Public. 
I can usually guess enough of a substring of the list name to find the list quickly in this listing. 
I can quickly scan all lists with 'dom' in their name and pick the one I want. 
I also operationally use the URL path hierarchy in getting there. 
I go in my history list to either a Member or Public message page I visited, and truncate the URL to go to the index. 
Since I am doing this with character deletes in a command line, I get to before I reach and so I never get to the latter (where I get a 403 error anyway). 
since the former gets me what I want.
