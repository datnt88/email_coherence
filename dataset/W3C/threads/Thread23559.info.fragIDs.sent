Rigo: "On the "stealable", I think, there is a fundamental difference. 
Stealing normal materialized goods takes away the possession and fruits of the thing to someone else. 
Copying digital content just produces another instance. 
It doesn't take away a piece from another human. 
The only thing it does is to not obey to some legal barrier of copying, invented to create a market. 
So copying outside the legal framework is just diminuishing the chances for the estimated benefit and NOT "stealing" at all. 
Being lawyers in a legal matter, we should be clear after all and we also should avoid the war-language of some marketing campaign." 
That brings to mind 3-D printing, where a material object (such as a cell-phone cover, even an artificial limb) is created with a printer, based on "3-D printing" a digital asset. 
It is interesting to see that another instance of a digital object corresponds to a physical object of a completely new kind, and, with technology improvements, could correspond to almost any material object - not just what we think of as `multimedia'/media asset. 
It also brings up the issue of the material worth of intellectual property vs. the material worth of its realization.

This is really interesting. 
It show's that the right does not follow the materialization. 
In fact, copyright just works normally here, as there is a monopoly to produce instances. 
Once produced, the tangible instances are sold and property of the new owner, that has the right to re-sell the instance, destroy it or whatever... 
Best, Rigo 
JSE: Pretty interesting new application of DRM technology, if you think about it --- applying it to the controlled rendering of a 3D model. 
For example, only those who are authorized (for example, have paid) to physically render the model can do so. 
Once rendered, of course, the usual rules over physical things apply. 
Note, however, that this does not necessarily mean that the "owner" of the property won't or can't claim rights, even ownership in the rendered property. 
I could imagine that the rendering could be done under contractual terms that claim a restriction on the renderee's right to sale, for example. 
Used within an organization, I would see claims of trade secret over the rendered property --- the authorized holder of the rendered property, being under obligation to their corporation, would be legally restricted in what they could do with the property. 
So 3D rendering would not necessarily be the free-for-all that you might imagine. 
John PS: I've just finished reading Lawrence Lessig's latest, "The Future of Ideas: The Fate of the Commons in a Connected World." 
So I'm not suggesting that the rules I desribe above are desireable, simply possible and likely; market leaders will always apply pressure to protect their monopolistic positions, and this includes lobbying for new forms of intellectual property and other market protections...

This is IMO not different from buying a building plan for a house or ship from an architect or designer, and building the object yourself. 
You buy the design and the right to implement it (most likely for one instance) - no-one would argue your home would belong to the architect. 
This analogy with the 3D printing as John scetched below goes as far as that an architect might impose contractual limitations to the changes you may make to his design.
