Gregg, Would you like to see the EZAccess techniques referenced in the USer Agent Guidelines? 
Basically it would be a URL reference in the User Agents techniques document to the Trace Web Site related to the EZAccess techniques. 
The US techniques document would have about one line about what type of user agent developers may want to visit the EZAccess site. 
No details of EZAccess implmentation would be included in the UA techniques document. 
I proposed this to the User Agent working group and most people are not familar with the EZAccess techniques. 
I have seen them demonstrated, but an not completely familar with the details of the technologies Trace and others are developing. 
The current Trace web pages related to EZAccess seem to be under construction, so I wanted to get your opinion on whether you felt it should be included.

Hi Jon, How many technique or protocol proposals will be in this section? 
Also, how would this category be referenced in the main document? 
Finally, how do new strategies get into the doc after it goes out? 
My general concerns in asking these questions are that - by mentioning only a couple approaches it could be construed as the document's recommended approach no matter what the disclaimer - if it doesn't get updated in internet time, enquiring designers will miss out on a whole slew possibilities to consider that are or will be emerging from the telecomm, auto, etc. interaction environments. 
- if EZAccess or AIIP don't work for the designer they'll think access isn't readily acheivable.

Earl, The techniques document is designed to be a resource to help developers implement the requirements of the checkpoints in the guidelines document. 
1. 
The techniques document is "informative" in the sense that it does not require a developer to do something in a particular way. 
The techniques mentioned are just suggested ways to implement a checkpoint and it does emphesize the use of open standards in trying to satisfy checkpoints. 
2. The techniques document is not comprehensive, the working group is not aware of all techniques that might satitisfy a checkpoint. 
We will try to include as many as are proposed to the group. 
3. The techniqes document is not designed to be static, it should grow and change as new technologies emerge and people participate to change it. 
4. References to other more detialed design information is important to make the document easier to use. 
The document may show examples, but typcially developers will need more detailed information for some of the techniques.
