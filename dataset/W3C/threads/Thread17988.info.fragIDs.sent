<s> Gregg, Would you like to see the EZAccess techniques referenced in the USer Agent Guidelines?  </s>
<s> Basically it would be a URL reference in the User Agents techniques document to the Trace Web Site related to the EZAccess techniques.  </s>
<s> The US techniques document would have about one line about what type of user agent developers may want to visit the EZAccess site.  </s>
<s> No details of EZAccess implmentation would be included in the UA techniques document.  </s>
<s> I proposed this to the User Agent working group and most people are not familar with the EZAccess techniques.  </s>
<s> I have seen them demonstrated, but an not completely familar with the details of the technologies Trace and others are developing.  </s>
<s> The current Trace web pages related to EZAccess seem to be under construction, so I wanted to get your opinion on whether you felt it should be included.  </s>

<s> Hi Jon, How many technique or protocol proposals will be in this section?  </s>
<s> Also, how would this category be referenced in the main document?  </s>
<s> Finally, how do new strategies get into the doc after it goes out?  </s>
<s> My general concerns in asking these questions are that - by mentioning only a couple approaches it could be construed as the document's recommended approach no matter what the disclaimer - if it doesn't get updated in internet time, enquiring designers will miss out on a whole slew possibilities to consider that are or will be emerging from the telecomm, auto, etc. interaction environments.  </s>
<s> - if EZAccess or AIIP don't work for the designer they'll think access isn't readily acheivable.  </s>

<s> Earl, The techniques document is designed to be a resource to help developers implement the requirements of the checkpoints in the guidelines document.  </s>
<s> 1.  </s>
<s> The techniques document is "informative" in the sense that it does not require a developer to do something in a particular way.  </s>
<s> The techniques mentioned are just suggested ways to implement a checkpoint and it does emphesize the use of open standards in trying to satisfy checkpoints.  </s>
<s> 2. The techniques document is not comprehensive, the working group is not aware of all techniques that might satitisfy a checkpoint.  </s>
<s> We will try to include as many as are proposed to the group.  </s>
<s> 3. The techniqes document is not designed to be static, it should grow and change as new technologies emerge and people participate to change it.  </s>
<s> 4. References to other more detialed design information is important to make the document easier to use.  </s>
<s> The document may show examples, but typcially developers will need more detailed information for some of the techniques.  </s>
