General Comments * We are inconsistent in the use of the term "SOAP message infoset". 
Variants include - SOAP message infoset - SOAP Message Infoset - SOAP envelope infosets - SOAP XML Infoset - Envelope XML infosets I would recommend: "SOAP message infoset" * We are inconsistent in the use of the term "infoset" in places not covered by the above. 
Variants include - Infoset - infoset - XML Infoset - XML infoset I would recommend: "XML infoset" * I assume the new namespace will be Specific Comments * S5.2.1, bullet 4: Add bullet for "relay" attribute information item * S5.2.4, 3 (just after bullet list): xs:boolean should be marked (italic) * S5.3 bullet list: Is it intentional that Body can't contain any character II children even if header blocks and fault detail can? 
* S5.3.1, bullet 1: Why do we have a namespace note on the body child elements descendents but not on header block descendents? 
Also, the former says "MAY" namespace qualify whereas the latter says "SHOULD". 
Shouldn't we be consistent? 
* S5.4, P2 (just after bullet list): Change "only child of the SOAP Body" with "only child of the SOAP Body element information item" * 5.4.7.2, P1: Change "TheSupportedEnvelope" to "The SupportedEnvelope" Henrik Frystyk Nielsen Marc and I went through the remaining of Henrik's issues for Part 1, section 4-App A and here's what we think we (spec editors) need to do: Just do it Just do it Update after we move the spec into new location Same as Gudge's point.
