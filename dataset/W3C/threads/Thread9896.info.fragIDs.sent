<s> OK, here are the reasons why I cannot live with S, in no particular order: 1. Local and global idioms are not compatable in the same knowledge base without having to resort to a duality of ontolgies, one for local idiom and one for global idiom.  </s>
<s> Cohabitatino of local and global idioms is IMO not just a desiderada, but a requirement.  </s>
<s> 2. Allows definition of alternate notations in lexical forms (e.g. octal) which are not supported by the actual datatype.  </s>
<s> I consider this to violate the precision of the datatype definition and a bug.  </s>
<s> It also means that there are two means to subclass a lexical datatype, either by reference to a new, subordinate datatype or by localized definition of (unsupported) lexical notations.  </s>
<s> TDL has only one single means of doing so, which respects the boundaries of definition of the datatype creator.  </s>
<s> With S, applications (and users) must know not only datatypes but ontologies of notational variant properties (octal, decimal, inKg, inOz, etc.) rather than, as with TDL, just datatypes.  </s>
<s> 3. Requires four (4) URIs for each datatype rather than just one.  </s>
<s> How can we ask every authority that has already defined datatypes and given them URI identity to now go back and mint three more URIs so that RDF can use them?! TDL has already shown that one URI is sufficient.  </s>
<s> 4. Requires users to understand the MT to understand which URI variant to use in which idiom (*.lex, *.map, *.val, or *) rather than addressing such distinctions in the MT alone, as TDL does.  </s>
<s> TDL allows you to talk about those different components, but it does not require you to do so simply to denote the type of a literal so that some application knows which value it corresponds to.  </s>
<s> 5. Requires additional clarification regarding semantics and use of rdfs:subPropertyOf relation between properties which convey datatyping.  </s>
<s> 6. Use of rdfs:subPropertyOf relation between datatyping property and non-datatyping property is valid in the absence of domain constraints but not valid if domain constraints defined.  </s>
<s> E.g. #Bob ex:age "30" .  </s>
<s> foo:integer rdfs:range xsd:integer.lex .  </s>
<s> ex:age rdfs:subPropertyOf foo:integer .  </s>
<s> implies that "30" is a member of the lexical space of xsd:integer, and this is correct and (even arguably) intuitive and efficient, avoiding the need for an anonymous node idiom.  </s>
<s> But with the additional constraint foo:integer rdfs:domain xsd:integer.val .  </s>
<s> which is valid for idioms using anonymous nodes, e.g. #Sue ex:age _:1 .  </s>
<s> _:1 foo:integer "30" .  </s>
<s> where _:1 is then inferred to denote a member of the value space of xsd:integer, it also means that, when these two graphs are merged, #Bob, from the example above is *also* inferred to be a member of the value space of xsd:integer, and thus a perfectly valid use becomes an invalid use.  </s>
<s> 7. Provides no additional expressive power over TDL yet requires significantly more machinery and deeper  </s>
<s> understanding of the model by users, and is not as  </s>
<s> compatable with current idioms as is TDL.  </s>
<s> Per Occam's razor, TDL is the simpler and better choice.  </s>
<s> 8. The S model, particularly literal labeled nodes participating in graph tidying, precludes any later adoption of a P+ treatment, which is a more ideal local idiom than D given the consistency of representation of local and global typing in the graph; I.e. with P+ the literal object node is not shifted to an anonymous node as with D, it just stays where it is and the local type is specified for the literal node directly  </s>
<s> via rdf:type -- elegant, efficient, and worth keeping  </s>
<s> as a desirable future option.  </s>
<s> S would prevent this option forever.  </s>
<s> In short, S is too complex, too different from present usage, able to result in conflicting knowledge on merge that is valid separately, and too burdensome from the practical point of URI management to be acceptable.  </s>
<s> If S were the only option, I'd still not choose to use it.  </s>
<s> I'd look for some other KR solution that dealt with datatyping in a more economical and user friendly manner.  </s>
<s> But since there is another option, TDL, which has none of the above faults yet meets all of the specified desiderada, the choice for TDL is obvious.  </s>
<s> Gasp, horror!  </s>
<s> maybe compromise is possible :)  </s>
<s> S-A and S-P can live with a single URI.  </s>
<s> In [1], different URIs were introduced for clarity, so that a precise distinction can be made whether lexical spaces, value spaces, or mappings are used for typing in a given idiom.  </s>

<s> I would like to better understand this.  </s>
<s> The intent in the TDL model theory was that an interpretation with no supported types was the same as the current model theory.  </s>
<s> I suspect this boils down to the tidy versus untidy literal nodes issue.  </s>
<s> Tidiness had already vanished from the latest editors draft of the model theory, which is the one I was working from.  </s>
<s> Is that right?  </s>
<s> Jeremy  </s>
<s> Proposal S [1] suggests three idioms to choose from.  </s>
<s> In S-A and S-P, global and local typing can merrily coexist, so I don't see why the above counts as an cannot-live-with argument.  </s>
<s> S does not mandate that all three idioms are required to be accepted for use simultaneously by the same application.  </s>
<s> Of course, each limitation can be twisted so that is looks like a  </s>

<s> I believe, it is much easier to arrive at a stable definition  </s>
<s> of say integers (which has remained the same for centuries) than to find an appropriate lexical representation (roman/arabic, decimal/octal etc.).  </s>
<s> I see great value in being able to migrate to new encodings gracefully, without breaking the existing applications.  </s>
<s> In TDL, you'd have to use different formats for old and new systems.  </s>
<s> This is the same as saving your text document with MS Word 2000 and not being able to read it with MS Word 95.  </s>
<s> That's a horror scenario.  </s>
<s> S-A and S-P can live with a single URI.  </s>
<s> In [1], different URIs were introduced for clarity, so that a precise distinction can be made whether lexical spaces, value spaces, or mappings are used for typing in a given idiom.  </s>
<s> Same as reply for (3).  </s>
<s> This is untrue.  </s>
<s> Semantics of rdfs:subPropertyOf remains exactly as defined in the model theory draft.  </s>
<s> What a discovery!  </s>
<s> If you happen to believe that cats are dogs you can hardly expect consistency.  </s>
<s> The use that you suggested above is simply incorrect...  </s>
<s> That sounds more like a plug rather than an argument.  </s>
<s> I think it has been made sufficiently clear over the past several month, which of the proposals requires "significantly more machinery and deeper understanding of the model by users" ;)  </s>
<s> Talking about esthetics, what about this: in TDL, if you write _1 rdf:value "bla" then _1 and "bla" denote exactly the same thing.  </s>
<s> Do you consider this elegant?  </s>
<s> Another plug... What about this: "In short, TDL is too complex, breaks most existing applications, APIs, querying, storage, ..."? ;)  </s>
<s> As a developer, I don't have an option.  </s>

<s> The comment "graph is tidy on uriref nodes" should in fact say "... tidy on uriref and literal nodes", since label() is used both for uri nodes and literal nodes - unless Pat had something else in mind?  </s>

<s> Near the beginning it says "Notice that disjoint graphs do not have any blank nodes in common, by definition, and that each separate occurrence of a literal is considered a separate node (in contrast to urirefs); we will therefore distinguish between literals and literal nodes."  </s>
<s> I think there are some editorial issues that have left confusion.  </s>
<s> Sergey, wanting tidiness, read tidiness.  </s>

<s> Jeremy PS You should see my cube, it might explain some things about untidiness.  </s>
<s> Sergey,  </s>
<s> If TDL supports tidy literals (which it does, though the MT will need adjustment) does this address your concerns about compatability with your present applications?  </s>
<s> A TDL with tidy literals allows (I belive) for Dan's "redhead"  </s>
<s> example where the datatyping for a given property is implicit in  </s>
<s> the RDF and kept consistent as a characteristic of the application environment (i.e. everybody agrees that 'hairColor' is a value from some enumeration "red", "blue", "green", etc. and the reliability of the axiom inferring redheadedness relies on  </s>
<s> conformance to that implicit datatyping).  </s>
<s> Eh? Patrick  </s>
<s> But this precludes arbitrary and unrestricted syndication of knowledge from disparate sources which may use different idioms.  </s>
<s> From the perspective of a single, tightly controlled application environment, it appears a reasonable restriction.  </s>
<s> From the perspective of a global semantic web of knowlege, it is not acceptable.  </s>
<s> I don't quite follow your argument.  </s>
<s> Can you give an example of "old" and "new" formats?  </s>
<s> If the lexical space for xsd:integer is defined to be based on decimal notation, then I hardly see how it is reasonable to expect applications to support octal notation.  </s>
<s> An application supports standards, as and insofar as those standards are defined, and the definition of xsd:integer says nothing about octal or any other non-decimal notation.  </s>
<s> The S approach would allow knowledge to be expressed in a non-standard manner.  </s>
<s> If you need/want a way to express integer values in octal, then define a new datatype, and if you want values of that new datatype to also be treated as members of the value space of xsd:integer, then define a relationship between your new datatype and xsd:integer which reflects such a relationship.  </s>
<s> But if an application supports xsd:integer, it should not be getting values in octal notation and be expected to achieve a correct interpretation of them.  </s>
<s> Fair enough, though the definition of S does not suggest that.  </s>
<s> But if S can be revised so that only one URI per datatype is required, then certainly this specific objection is no longer valid.  </s>
<s> Same as reply to reply for (3) ;-)  </s>
<s> I've detailed my concerns on this point numerous times.  </s>
<s> It has nothing to do with the semantics of rdfs:subPropertyOf being different, but rather having to clarify for users the implications for relating properties which may involve datatyping semantics.  </s>
<s> It is not incorrect, though perhaps you have misunderstood it.  </s>
<s> Right, S does, so then we agree ;-)  </s>
<s> They do not denote the same thing.  </s>
<s> Precisely where do you get that?  </s>
<s> It may be that you do not actually understand TDL?  </s>
<s> In the above example, _1 denotes (if anything) a member of the value space of a datatype, and "bla" (in the context of a given datatype) denotes a lexical form, a member of the lexical space of that datatype.  </s>
<s> Are you saying that a member of the lexical space and a member of the value space are the same thing?  </s>
<s> Though, per my recent discussion of TDL with tidy literals, I would say that it is reasonable to presume that isofar as the graph is concerned, _1 is simply an object node and "bla" is simply a literal, and depending on other characteristics of the graph, may participation in an interpretation which will treat "bla" as a lexical form for some datatype.  </s>
<s> TDL (the model, not necessarily the MT) is very simple and elegant, and does not break any existing applications.  </s>
<s> Furthermore, the argument that TDL with non-tidy literals breaks existing applications seems to presume that those applications are testing for literal node equality rather than string equality of literal node labels -- a claim which I find *very* hard to believe.  </s>
<s> Can you clarify: do these applications make their equality tests by actual node identity or by checking if two property values have the same string equality?  </s>
<s> If the latter, then I would assert that TDL, even with non-tidy literals, does not break any such application.  </s>
<s> I really don't believe that this would be the case.  </s>
<s> I think that there has been a misunderstanding about what TDL is actually requiring, or what perhaps such applications are expecting in the RDF graph.  </s>
<s> Still, even if your applications are doing tests for tidy literal node equality rather than string equality, TDL works fine with tidy literals (though the MT needs adjustment, perhaps, to support that).  </s>
<s> So, I still don't see any clear evidence that TDL breaks your existing implementations.  </s>
<s> No problem.  </s>
<s> TDL works fine with tidy literals.  </s>
<s> Whether or not literals are tidy or untidy is irrelevant insofar as the TDL model is concerned (though, again, the present MT may need to be tweaked).  </s>
<s> Have a close look at my recent posting and please reconsider if TDL really breaks your applications.  </s>
<s> Patrick  </s>
<s> And the TDL model, being based on labels and not nodes, supports either case.  </s>
<s> So, perhaps all that is needed in order to address Sergey's and  </s>
<s> Dan's (and others) concerns about tidiness, is to revise the TDL MT to reflect the label-based axiomatic qualities of interpretation defined by TDL.  </s>
<s> Eh? Patrick  </s>
<s> Sorry this reply is late.  </s>
<s> The latest version of the MT has this paragraph, which I hope will be unambiguous: To describe RDF graphs it is first necessary to define the things that can act as nodes and arcs of the graph.  </s>
<s> There are three kinds of node in any RDF graph: urirefs, literal nodes, and blank nodes.  </s>
<s> A i uriref /i is defined to be a URI reference in the sense of a href="#bib_uri" [RFC 2396] /a .  </s>
<s> span class="newer" We do not distinguish between urirefs and uriref nodes because urirefs are considered to be nodes in themselves /span .  </s>
<s> A literal node is a particular of a literal; and blank (or unlabeled) nodes are considered to be drawn from some set of 'anonymous' entities which have no 'label' and are unique to the graph.  </s>
<s> Finally, every arc in an RDF graph is labelled with a uriref.  </s>
<s> The same uriref may label several arcs and also be a node in the graph.  </s>
<s> An RDF graph can then be defined as a set of triples of the form S, P, O, where P is a uriref, S is either a uriref or a blank node, and O is either a uriref, a blank node, or a literal.  </s>
<s> Note that a given uriref may occur in more than one graph, but blank nodes and literal nodes are unique to each graph.  </s>
<s> This reflects the fact that urirefs are considered to have a 'global' meaning span class="newer" but blank nodes and literals do not: blank nodes because they are local to the graph, and literals because each occurrence of a literal is considered to be unique.  </s>
<s> (This may be a href="#litdisclaim" altered in future /a ; at present it is the most conservative assumption for the model theory to make, since some datatyping schemes may assign different interpretations to several occurrences of the same literal.) /span Pat IHMC(850)434 8903 home 40 South Alcaniz St.(850)202 4416 office phayes@ai.uwf.edu  </s>
