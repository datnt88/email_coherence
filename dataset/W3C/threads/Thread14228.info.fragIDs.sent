<s> Hi, This is the first of 8 messages reporting the results of the first stage of our evaluation of the Guidelines with page authors who adapted web pages according to the Guidelines.  </s>
<s> The second stage is about to begin in which blind people will be asked to evaluate the pages created in the first stage.  </s>
<s> Below is some background information on the participants and the task they performed.  </s>
<s> We will start new threads to report our findings regarding the following aspects: navigation, examples, priorities, audience, and other general comments.  </s>
<s> Background information:  </s>
<s> From both observations of participants and participants' opinions, this  </s>
<s> study has identified several aspects of the Guidelines in which improvements could be made.  </s>
<s> This first part of the study involved 12 participants who all had experience of creating web pages.  </s>
<s> They were all university students, except one who was a school pupil.  </s>
<s> The students were from a range of disciplines: 6 from Computer Science; 3 from Psychology; 1 from Humanities; and 1 from Engineering.  </s>
<s> The average age was 23 (range of 14 - 35).  </s>
<s> The participants' experience of creating web pages ranged from a few personal pages to large personal sites, or having been employed to create larger sites for organisations.  </s>
<s> The number of pages they had previously created ranged from 4 to over 100, with an average of 37.  </s>
<s> The tasks were distributed as follows: 6 worked with tables-plus-images, 2 with forms, 2 with frames, and 2 with imagemaps.  </s>
<s> The average time spent on the whole task, including reading the Guidelines in advance, was just over 3 hours.  </s>
<s> The average time spent reading was just over 1 hour, and the average time spent performing the adaptation task was just under 2 hours.  </s>
<s> We look forward to hearing your comments on the issues that will be posted in new threads.  </s>

<s> Hello Chetz, Thanks for all of your work!  </s>
<s> These results are *very* helpful.  </s>
<s> Which version of the Guidelines did they use?  </s>
<s> I think that *some* of the issues that were raised in your results have been resolved in the version that was released on 22 February.  </s>
<s> I have a few other questions and comments that I will be making in the threads of your other messages.  </s>
<s> thanks again, --wendy  </s>
<s> While the results have produced many valuable observations, I am inclined to temper my acceptance of the comments about the organisation and layout of the document with the knowledge that only about one hour was spent reading it.  </s>
<s> In my view this is too brief a reading for most people.  </s>
<s> If an author has developed their skills with the assumption that creating an accessible page is simply on of the technical requirements, then a quick look over the checklist will make much of what is contained seem redundant, although I would expect that some of the interim solutions in particular (such as the problems screeen readers have with tables, or the problem that mainstream browsers don't have a sensible model for non-graphic rendering of imagemaps) would be news.  </s>
<s> If on the other hand they have learned a number of presentational tricks, and managedto use those to create pages which look about right on SomeBrowser 3.4.5 then I suspect they will need to unlearn a fair bit of what they know and relearn it.  </s>
<s> This is too complex a problem for many people to solve in 3 hours, particularly people without a good understanding of abstract structures.  </s>
<s> The fact that there are not readily available authoring tools which support accessibility (HotMetal 5, from softquad is currently the best by a significant margin, to my very incomplete knowledge) does not help the situation.  </s>

<s> The participants were given as much time as they wanted to read the Guidelines and were paid accordingly: there was no limit set, except by the participants' own schedules, which of course occurs in 'real life'.  </s>
<s> They spent 2 hours performing the task, some of which was also spent re-reading.  </s>
<s> It could be that they spent so little time reading because they found the documents difficult to navigate.  </s>
<s> I think this raises the issue of the intended, or expected, audience of the Guidelines.  </s>
<s> There are authors who are able to commit a reasonable amount of time to learning about accessibility, and therefore will read the entire Guidelines document.  </s>
<s> But I think this is typical of only one group who are likely to want to use the guidelines.  </s>
<s> Others will not be able to spend as much time, and they are not currently supported in using the document without reading it all.  </s>
<s> Perhaps this type of author is the intended audience of the E&amp;O group's 'quicktips' card, rather than the Guidelines?  </s>
