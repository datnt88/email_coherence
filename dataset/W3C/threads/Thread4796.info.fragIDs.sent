I'm wondering who all is at WWW2004 and if people would be interested in getting together (or if someone has already planned something and I missed it). 
Hmm... sounds like a use case for RDF data access! 
see http://esw.w3.org/topic/PathCross and nearby http://esw.w3.org/topic/WWW2004 and, for fun, http://esw.w3.org/topic/InstantGig 
I'm going, as my homepage and .sig 
attest, as well as hmm... I've been trying to keep my travel itineraries connected via an rdfs:seeAlso path from my foaf homepage but I haven't managed to keep the paths up to date.
