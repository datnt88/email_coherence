<s> I think what happened to w3 fonts is that Netscape gave up waiting and licenced Bitstream TrueDoc and that's the end of OpenType.  </s>
<s> Microsoft will clearly have to use TrueDoc if they are not to fall  </s>
<s> behind again, and why would they then use two technologies?  </s>
<s> On the other hand, Netscape has also licensed the TT and T1 rendererd from Bitstream, so if OpenType happens, they'll presumably be able to support it.  </s>
<s> I hope we don't get OpenType, since it seems to be a recipe for unlimited font piracy hiding behind Microsoft's meaningless platitudes about the OS/2 embedding bits and signatures, which will be ignored by all existing software and hence irrelevant -- except as a reason for not moving to  </s>

<s> I don't think that's anywhere near the end of OpenType, I think MS would be  </s>

<s> Perhaps their lawyers need a little workout,  </s>
<s> European copyright law should prove to be a formidable foe.  </s>
<s> Does it matter that they are ignored by existing software, not if the format is such that existing software cannot read it.  </s>
<s> MS have already commited themselves to supporting the digital signatures at a system level, one would imagine that Apple would concur.  </s>
<s> The fundamental difference between the two formats is that one, OpenType, is trying to define protection for a new era in intellectual property law, it may fall short of what is required by many, but it is a first step.  </s>
<s> On the other hand TrueDoc is doing its best not to enforce law, but to circumvent it, we've all heard the big tales of the impossible to decode format, but it only took 30 minutes for me to figure it out, and I wasn't trying that hard.  </s>
<s> The real thing that I hate about TrueDoc, is not that it is insecure (while claiming the opposite), not that it munges my lovingly crafted ouitlines, but, that it doesn't give me a choice in the matter, I cannot program a font so that TrueDoc spits it out.  </s>

<s> well, TrueDoc can do Unicode, and I don't think the copyright issues are any better or worse (both systems send the font design over the web).  </s>
<s> Well I acknowledge that, the difference is in the methodology, one uses the politics of cooperation, the other of coercion.  </s>
<s> As I said, OpenType recognises the problems and is at least trying to do something about them, rather than ignoring the problem and storing it up for another day.  </s>

<s> yes -- but existing TT software can read OpenType fonts and use them, but doesn't understand the copy protection, and ignores that.  </s>
<s> I don't see how that can be, if existing TT software can read all the features of OpenType then OT would only be a set of security protocols.  </s>
<s> In fact it is  </s>
<s> much more than that.  </s>
<s> Though perhaps this is the case, I would have thought though that since there is a new format involved there would be at least some applications that do not understand the format (beside that fact that OT isn't just a TT format, it also encompasses T1/CFF).  </s>
<s> Gradual movement towards a goal of intellectual property control is surely better than trying to ignore the issue altogether.  </s>
<s> If it doesn't work now, well let's have another bite at it, maybe in ten years we will have made some progress.  </s>

<s> yes -- but existing TT software can read OpenType fonts and use them, but doesn't understand the copy protection, and ignores that.  </s>
<s> Not quite what the original poster said.  </s>
<s> TT software can read OT fonts - that seems reasonable, because these are a set of tables and the cmap, hhea, head, name and post tables will still be there and can be read.  </s>
<s> Of course there will be tables in there that are not understood, such as dsig, gpos, gsub and there might be cff (compressed Type1 glyphs) in addition to or even instead of glyf (in which latter case the older program would indeed fail).  </s>
<s> I note that DSIG is on the list of required tables, [1] and gather the intent is that newer software refuses to read the font if this table is not all hunky-dory.  </s>
<s> Of course, third parties can write software that ignores this table.  </s>
<s> Existing TT fonts do not have this table - but then, only the copyright owner can make such fonts available on the Web.  </s>
<s> DSIG appears to allow licencees to put the fonts on the Web, and my understanding is that the DSIGtavble will contain a signed and verifiable machine readabble assertion about the terms of that license.  </s>
<s> For example, it might be that Joe Webster licensed this font from Glypf Factory for use on http://joe.org/foo only.  </s>
<s> Other sites pointing to those fonts would not work.  </s>
<s> Well that is the theory as I understand it.  </s>
<s> Having never laid my hands on an actual OT font, I am unable to conduct the obvious experiments (give it to Win3.1, give it to MacOS, drop it into Fontographer and re-save) to see if the font works.  </s>

<s> You're right, of course.  </s>
<s> I was only trying to address the security/embedding concerns brought up in the original post.  </s>
<s> I think something like OpenType is essential, but somebody needs to get behind it and push.  </s>
<s> QuickDraw GX is probably a better technology (and it already exists!), but nobody pushed it.  </s>
<s> And now, with Apple going to NeXT's Display Postscript, who knows what will really happen to it?  </s>
<s> The plan is to keep most of the typographical features, so someone out there realizes we need the enhanced capabilities for many reasons.  </s>

<s> [someone] (actually me, lee@sq.com)  </s>
<s> yes -- but existing TT software can read OpenType fonts and use them, but doesn't understand the copy protection, and ignores that.  </s>
<s> Yes... if you use only Type 1 fonts and not TrueType ones to start with, you'll get some small measure of defacto copy protection, at least until ATM and fontographer can understand OpenType fonts.  </s>
<s> The scenario I imagine is this: I am sitting inside FrontPage (say).  </s>
<s> I choose a font for my headings -- Trixie, say.  </s>
<s> This is installed on my system as a TrueType font.  </s>
<s> I press "publish", and FrontPage makes an OpenType subsetted font that's a TrueType font based on Trixie, and saves it for me, including a relative URL in the style sheet.  </s>
<s> Now, if FrontPage is creating the signature, we have a problem that you now have software that is a Digital Thief, staling fonts for you.  </s>
<s> If it can't, where does the signature come from?  </s>
<s> The point of including a giant superset of TT and T1 was supposed to be that you could use your existing fonts on the web.  </s>
<s> This would be true if (1) you had purchased an OpenType font (can't yet) (2) you had bought the font for use only on a specific domain or URL,e.g. so that you could publish your web site using your corporate font, but could not do internal marketing literature with it (oops) (so the idea is that you buy all your fonts twice?) (3) either 3a] the font was Type 1, and the receiving software predated OpenType, or 3b] the receiving software is newer than OpenType and is smart enough to understand that it shouldn't let you use it, and honest enough to implement that, and has no override.  </s>
<s> Of course, if your own domain changes, you have to buy new fonts.  </s>
<s> oops.  </s>
<s> This seems so badly designed that either (1) I'm totally misunderstanding it, or (2) Netscape's use of TrueDoc will make it all history.  </s>
<s> Since Microsoft doesn't (yet) have the graphic design market, and won't until colour management is fixed in Windows xx, I expect that the people who care most about the appearance of fonts will decide whether TrueDoc looks OK in netscape, and, if so, use it -- and for the rest of the market, the extra quality of the lossless fonts will be irrelevant if you have to go through lots of hassle.  </s>
<s> One obvious trick would be to "encrypt" the font with its URL on publishing it, so that the font would not work in _any_ existing software directly, and combining that with other techniques.  </s>
<s> Another would be to use a wholly new font format -- e.g. based on GX.  </s>
<s> As it is, I don't believe the people working on OpenType have taken this issue seriously enough.  </s>
<s> Perhaps it's all a hoax and OpenType is a joke??  </s>
<s> While we're about it, let's write an Appllication Server Protocol that lets me put up all of Microsoft's software for ftp.  </s>
<s> I'll add a new field, "execute permission", and if that is set to zero, you canonly download and not execute the programs.  </s>
<s> Of course, operating systems will have to be modified, but that shouldn't be a problem, and all users will upgrade instantly so that they can no longer use the free programs.  </s>
