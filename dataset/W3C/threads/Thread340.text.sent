The following gives line 29 column 67 - Warning: unescaped &amp; or unknown entity "&amp;_c" Bjarne D Mathiesen mailto:mac.bjarnedm@get2net.dk 
K?benhavn N ; Danmark ; Europa That error is correct. 
The markup should read as either: which the browers will translate back to &amp; before submission to the server, or use which will require a corresponding adjustment to the script (client- or server-side) on that HTML page that handles those fields to allow ; to be a synonym for &amp;. 
I'm using the URL as described here: to pass information between my own pages for handling in my own javascripts I've never before seen information to indicate that the '&amp;' in parameter lists has to be escaped.
