Hi there Minutes available at http://wai/ua/2001/10/minutes-20011022 -t Tim Lacy Accessibility Program Manager Accessible Technologies Group Corrected URL for meeting minutes: - Ian Ian Jacobs (ij@w3.org) 
http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs Minor change (as to make that statement make sense): q For development: When we don't implement a checkpoint, we either think "Good idea" or "What do we need that for?". 
For the case of an HTML browser, we have mostly thought "Good idea". 
/q That should be q When there is a checkpoint we haven't implemented, we either think of it "Good idea" or "What do we need that for?". 
In our case making an HTML browser, we have mostly thought "Good idea". 
/q We have not yet gotten to the state that we don't implement something *because* it is a good idea... Jonny Axelsson Documentation, Opera software Hi, Thanks for the opportunity to join the conformance/testing discussion yesterday. 
I had a look at the minutes, and there is one minor nit whose correction may help prevent confusion. 
It is written: "LH: For both XSLT WG and ..." We're not talking about the W3C WG here. 
It is actually the OASIS XSLT/Xpath Conformance TC, Regards, -Lofton. 
Thanks for the clarification. 
From a functional stand point is there any problem borrowing some of their work for our purposes? 
Thanks, jon Thank you Lofton, for attending. 
I have corrected the minutes and included the link to the Oasis TC work.

I don't think so. 
We (I'm a member of the TC) are about to make a public release of all of the materials (**including much better documentation**), for the purpose of starting to build the XSLT test suite from available contributions. 
It has also been a goal, since fairly early in the designs, to "genericize" the XSLT procedures enough so that they would be widely useful (beyond XSLT). 
Finally, I think there is the intention to submit it work to W3C (QA) when it is in proper shape. 
Already, Kirill Gavrylyuk (TC member from Microsoft) is presenting the "Infoset-ize" parts at the first QAWG/IG f2f in Brussels. 
Regards, -Lofton. 
p.s. As a courtesy, I intend to email the TC and inform them of my ad-hoc speaking on the TC work. 
I'll invite any comments about others borrowing the work.

Lofton Henderson 1919 Fourteenth St., #604 Boulder, CO 80302 Thanks, I just want every thing understood up front.
