<s> I fail to understand the rationale behind what to me is the most complex  </s>
<s> section in the whole document.  </s>
<s> Why are we requiring UAs to combine  </s>
<s> the two headers?  </s>
<s> I think there is no siginificant loss of functionality if this whole section is dropped along with the forward reference in the previous section.  </s>
<s> Simply require the server to send both with appropriate attributes.  </s>
<s> If the UA understands both forms, it MUST send the new form and it must replace an existing matching form 1 with the new form.  </s>
<s> Otherwise the UA doesn't understand both and sends the old form.  </s>

<s> This issue has been discussed (but perhaps privately?)  </s>
<s> The complaint from some parties was that the NAME=VALUE part of cookies, in  </s>
<s> particular, can be (and already is) quite large.  </s>
<s> So sending it twice, once  </s>
<s> in Set-Cookie and once in Set-Cookie2 would incur a lot of network traffic.  </s>
<s> I agree that sending a completely separate Set-Cookie2 header with its own  </s>
<s> set of values would be much simpler.  </s>
<s> But the network traffic that results  </s>
<s> was deemed excessive.  </s>
<s> Dave Kristol  </s>
<s> I think there are two alternative solutions to mitigate network traffic  </s>
<s> for that subset of cookie using application which need to update large pieces of data: a. Use out of band informantion such as the User Agent value to decide which cookie to send b. Minimize the number of times a cookie is set.  </s>
<s> Perhaps multiple cookies with only one needing upate.  </s>
<s> c. Restructure the application to maintain more state information in the server.  </s>
<s> d.  </s>
<s> Once the first cookie is received by the server, it is only necessary to send one of the two formats.  </s>
<s> I would speculate that some percentage of large cookie values are related to shopping basket usage and only get large in the course of multiple interactions.  </s>
<s> The combinatorial rules are difficult and must be implemented to some degree by both the server and the client.  </s>
<s> In addition, they are in support of a transition interval.  </s>
<s> I think they should be dropped in the interest of simplicity.  </s>
<s> Dave Morris  </s>
<s> All of these ideas have been considered and rejected because of the load they place on the server.  </s>
<s> Turning a V1 cookie into a V0/V1 cookie, on the server side, requires nothing more than inserting "CRLF Set-Cookie2:" in the right place in the set-cookie header.  </s>
<s> The beauty of the solution is that the server doesn't have to sniff UA headers, which is expensive, or worry at all about who they are talking to.  </s>
<s> By just inserting the string they guarantee that everyone will work properly without the need for any conditional code.  </s>

<s> Note also that though the section on combinatorial rules is the most complex in the draft, it does not apppear sufficient to ensure equivalent implementations across UAs and reliable exchanges between UAs and servers: The examples have alternating Set-Cookie and Set-Cookie2 headers when the Set-Cookie2 header is adding Version 1 attributes to an otherwise Version 0 cookie name=value and attributes, which would help simplify their combination, but no such ordering is stated as a requirement in the draft, and such alternation would not be necessary if no Version 1 attributes other than Version are being use, i.e., if a Set-Cookie2 header is simply indicating that the server is Version 1 capable such that the UA should include the $Version, $Path and $Domain attributes in its Cookie headers.  </s>
<s> If multiple cookies are included in Set-Cookie headers, and additional Version 1 attributes are provided via Set-Cookie2 headers but for some reason the numbers of cookies associated with the "old" and "new" headers do not appear equal, how much should be discarded (everything?)?  </s>
<s> If the Set-Cookie2 header is simply indicating  </s>
<s> Verson 1 capability, should it then use a comma-separated list of Version="1" attributes to ensure matching for number of cookies, or  </s>
<s> use them as comma-serarated "fillers" if not all of the cookies in such a Set-Cookie header have other Version 1 attributes?  </s>
<s> Note also  </s>
<s> that in the Examples, the Set-Cookie headers have commas as separators for name/attribute sets, which is invalid for the "old" headers, and could be confusing to readers of the draft.  </s>
<s> Particularly since large headers are likely to be the result of cookie accumulations, and the UA is likely to have sent a Cookie header so that the server need not send both "old" and "new" headers in such cases, the concern for saving bandwidth during the transition period via a combinational strategy may indeed be penny wise but pound foolish with respect to reliability and consistency of implementations.  </s>
<s> Another possibility if for Version 1 capable UAs to indicate this in a request header, perhaps only when not sending a Cookie header with Version 1 attributes, which itself indicates this capability.  </s>

<s> I didn't think the combination rules ("combinatorial" conjures a much worse situation) were that bad, but that's a judgement call.  </s>
<s> Either way, I think the burden for interpreting them is wholly in the client.  </s>
<s> Yaron Goland (in a separate message) stated that the burden on the server, to emit Set-Cookie2, is minor.  </s>
<s> And there's no new burden on the server to interpret Cookie, which remains unchanged.  </s>
<s> Dave Kristol  </s>
<s> Alternation is not "necessary".  </s>
<s> I wrote the examples that way to emphasize two points: 1) An existing application could easily upgrade to V1 cookies by outputting a second header after the first.  </s>
<s> 2) Like headers might not appear consecutively.  </s>
<s> Assuming a client aggregates like headers first, I think the hardest part of the combining rules might be walking the combined Set-Cookie and Set-Cookie2 headers in parallel and creating new Set-Cookie2 headers.  </s>
<s> That's a fair question.  </s>
<s> I think the only *safe* thing to do is to discard all, since there's no way to discern where an omission occurred.  </s>
<s> It could, or it could use separate Set-Cookie2 headers, each with a Version=1.  </s>
<s> I guess the answer is yes (which makes the Set-Cookie2 effectively null).  </s>
<s> But why would an application want to send some V0 cookies and some V1?  </s>
<s> Please cite specific section/page/text.  </s>
<s> My eyes may deceive me, but I only see ';' as attribute/value separators.  </s>
<s> The down-sides of that approach are: 1) A UA would always send extra header information to indicate cookie capabilities, even to servers that don't use cookies.  </s>
<s> 2) An application would have to look for such a header *or* for V1 cookies to decide what kind of cookies to send.  </s>
<s> Dave Kristol  </s>
<s> I don't see why it couldn't be: Cookie: $version=1 So there would only be 1 header to examine.  </s>
<s> But I don't think this is necessary.  </s>
<s> As I said before, I think this is needless complexity for a transition plan to save an arguably large/small amount of network traffic.  </s>
<s> The server (read application author) burden in terms of the potential for some client not correctly merging the two headers is quite high.  </s>
