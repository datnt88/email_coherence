First, I love this program, use it every day, and hope to continue doing so for the foreseeable future. 
It simple meets my web page content development needs better than any other piece of software I've tried (and I've tried most of them). 
Yet, there are, of course, some problems that I keep noticing. 
Many are small matters. 
But...here are some of them: 
1. I can move the text insertion point rapidly to the Left, skipping form the beginning of a word to the beginning of the word immediately previous, by using the [Ctrl] + [LeftArrow] keyboard shortcut. 
But if I try to go to the Right, using [Ctrl] + [RightArrow], the insertion point locks up and won't move. 
I can get it moving by using [Ctrl] + [Shift] + [RightArrow]--but that invokes a selection functionality, not mere cursor movement. 
This annoys me every time I use the program. 
The sort of insertion point behavior I'm expecting is simply a convention for text processing software. 
My text editor (jEdit) does this, as has all text editors I've ever used. 
All my email composition software does this. 
Dreamweaver does this. 
MS Word does this. 
Amaya does not. 
Why not? 
This is a BASIC functionality, and it doesn't seem to work well enough at this point. 
2. If I want to call up program Help information, on most programs, I need only press the [F1] key. 
This, too, is a widely respected convention. 
But not in Amaya, which simply makes me work harder, as a user, and that's never a good thing. 
This is especially so when what I have to do is abandon keyboard control of the program and reach for the mouse - virtually never a quick solution to anything. 
Why is not this convention respected in Amaya? 
3. There are many informational dialog windows, such as the program "Help  About" dialog, which accept no user input, but have a "Confirm" button in them which must be pressed to make the dialog vanish. 
Confirm WHAT? 
If there's no input, there's nothing to confirm. 
It seems to me that the button would be correctly labeled if it said "Close". 
And this is not the only place this anomaly appears in the program. 
4. In the above mentioned "Help  About" dialog window, when the program version is identified, IT IS IDENTIFIED INCORRECTLY. 
Ouch! 
I couldn't believe it. 
I happen to know that I'm running "Amaya 8.3 pre-release" version. 
The About window really ought to confirm that, don't you think? 
OK, now I'm really out of time. 
I do want to reaffirm that I do much like the improvements I see in this version. 
If just one of my complaints is attended to, I would wish it to be #1 above. 
That problem just makes NO sense.

Hi, First of all, congratulations for this new release. 
I noticed that it still has a problem I already mentioned before about 8.2+. 
Irene answered it had been fixed in CVS but I did not check. 
It is easy to reproduce: - start a new empty document (e.g. XHTML 1.1, I did not try with other doctypes); - create a table with the default number of lines and columns; - set it's width to 100%; - set a style for the table "margin-right:20pt;margin-left:20pt". 
You will see that the bottom line of the border extends beyond the right limit of the table. 
It happens in display and when you print the document. 
This defect only shows on the right side, the left side is correctly displayed and printed. 
I use the amaya-GTK-8.3-.tgz binary version on a RedHat 8.0 box. 
Best regards, Serge Torres

You're right. 
A similar bug was fixed but not this one. 
Now it's fixed. 
Thanks a lot for your complete description of the bug.
