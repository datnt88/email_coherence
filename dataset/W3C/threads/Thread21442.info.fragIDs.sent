<s> Regarding the yahoo mailing list: - the purpose of the WOLWebServices mailing list is to simplify our internal communication Public discussion should not go the the WOLWebServices mailing list.  </s>
<s> The mailing list is not endorsed by W3C and should not be seen as a part of the WebOnt working group as such, since it just covers our private communication.  </s>

<s> - Eric Miller has suggest to use the W3C Web-Services Mailing list as the public forum for discussion ( www-ws@w3.org ) The archives of the web-services mailing list can be found at I suggest that we also subscribe to this mailing list (send mail to www-ws-request@w3.org with Subject: subscribe ) All the best, Stefan  </s>
<s> As observed with other working groups that I have been involved, they have a public mailing list where the WG's discussion takes place.  </s>
<s> Administrative and member-confidential topics are discussed using another mailing list address.  </s>
<s> Both are within the w3c.org domain.  </s>
<s> For example, the XML Protocol working group has the xml-dist-app@w3.org  </s>
<s> mailing list (Archived)for their public WG discussion, and another for WG members only.  </s>
<s> Hence, there was no need to set-up a yahoo mailing list.  </s>

<s> +cc:em,hugo Stefan, If this is in any way part of the WebOnt WG work, please don't use a YahooGroups list.  </s>
<s> If it isn't, please don't call it 'the WebOnt requirements working group for XXX'.  </s>
<s> The WG mailing list, www-ws and/or www-archive should be used; if there's need for a separate forum, let's talk about that.  </s>
<s> Using www-ws seems like an excellent idea, particularly given the importance of connecting Semantic Web and Web Service perspectives (and communities).  </s>
<s> It's important that we keep all these discussions visible... Dan (www-archive lurker ;-)  </s>
