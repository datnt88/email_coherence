Perhaps it's time we looked at some of the more complex guidelines. 
Can we start off with Guideline 5 - "Create tables that transform gracefully"? 
Technique 5.1 - Check for row and column headers (Actually this table technique seems quite straightforward.) Chris The guideline specifies that there should be row and/or column headers for *data* tables only. 
Shouldn't there be headers for tables used for layout? 
How could we determine if the table was a data table or a layout table? 
Chris No, see Checkpoint 5.4. 
Heuristics. 
Most tables are layout today. 
Likely to have size specified (width, height), colspan, no border. 
Data table are likely to have tr and borders. 
Another heuristic: layout tables typically have border=0 padding=0 spacing=0 especially if cells contain images. 
These are needed to avoid spaces between images.

(215) 204-2247 (voice) (800) 750-7428 (TTY) yes, and cell with images is another good criteria for layout table. 
But images may be data too e.g. our SVG note has 4 images in a table, the rows show a small or enlarged image and the columns PNG or SVG format. 
Marja It may not be possible to distinguish data tables from layout tables with certainty. 
Can anyone think of a perfect method to tell if a table is one or the other? 
It may boil down to asking the author. 
Chris Sure, data tables will have HR ;)
