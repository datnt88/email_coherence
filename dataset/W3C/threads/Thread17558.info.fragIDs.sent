<s> Proposal for UA guidelines: A browser must show rulers and borders.  </s>
<s> A ruler or border can be described in text if "showing" it is not convenient.  </s>
<s> This is specifically a feature that should be added to Text based browsers like LYNX.  </s>

<s> Why? Rulers and borders are visual objects that by themselves have no meaning.  </s>
<s> An aural user does not gain anything from knowing that a table has borders (for example).  </s>

<s> When you look at a ruler as such it is _only a visual objet", but a (good) designer adds a ruler for some reason  </s>
<s> Yes, and so the browser should give the reason for the rule rather than saying "There's a rule".  </s>
<s> In structural HTML, there are no rules, but there are reasons for rules.  </s>
<s> When you look at a today's HTML page you see several types of tables: - Tables to force some layout.  </s>
<s> They normally do not have a border since that would disturb the layout.  </s>
<s> - numerical or textual tables.  </s>
<s> In these case the borders are used to identify the diferent cells and/or rows/comuns.  </s>
<s> The cells are identified by the TD or TH elements.  </s>
<s> The borders are a visual presentation that is unimportant to the non-visual user since they do not express any meaning.  </s>
