<s> Well, I'm far from an expert in these matters however one technology that I recall which may predate these claims is NeWS (Network Extensible Window Manager) from Sun.  </s>
<s> If I recall correctly this was essentially a postscript client that communicated with a server and into which postscript applications were delivered and in which they were executed.  </s>
<s> Here's something I found at http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?copy=NeWs: "NeWS was a window system for Unix, especially Sun workstations, designed primarily by JamesGosling.  </s>
<s> It was like X in that it was a network window system, with programs running on other machines able to open windows for display on your machine.  </s>
<s> It was unlike X in that the graphics model was DPS, and it allowed downloading PostScript code into the window system to run locally.  </s>
<s> This helped to avoid some of the nasty race conditions you have in X, where (for example) even the window manager runs out-of-process; in NeWS, you could write the window manager in PostScript and run it directly in the window system process."  </s>

<s> Sounds promising.  </s>
<s> Did NeWS also allow external programs to take over a part of a NeWS window and display content in it?  </s>
<s> A simple example might a clock program that runs on the client side.  </s>
<s> BTW, from the press coverage of the Eolas/Microsoft trial, it appears that Microsoft only looked for prior art in the context of Web browsers.  </s>
<s> Not sure why they didn't also look at BBS software, X11, and NeWS.  </s>

<s> If I can recall back that far (around 1988 :) X11 was actually a thread running in the NeWS server (xnews) so that applications could poke through their own content.  </s>
<s> The basic idea of NeWS was that the user interface part of an application (i.e., drawing a selection box) would run on the local machine and simply send the higher-level results (i.e. the two corners of the selection) to an application running on a server.  </s>
<s> The side-effect of this was lower network bandwidth requirements than X11 (only two co-ordinates are sent at the end of an operation rather than each mouse movement).  </s>
