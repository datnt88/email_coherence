Well, I'm far from an expert in these matters however one technology that I recall which may predate these claims is NeWS (Network Extensible Window Manager) from Sun. 
If I recall correctly this was essentially a postscript client that communicated with a server and into which postscript applications were delivered and in which they were executed. 
Here's something I found at http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?copy=NeWs: "NeWS was a window system for Unix, especially Sun workstations, designed primarily by JamesGosling. 
It was like X in that it was a network window system, with programs running on other machines able to open windows for display on your machine. 
It was unlike X in that the graphics model was DPS, and it allowed downloading PostScript code into the window system to run locally. 
This helped to avoid some of the nasty race conditions you have in X, where (for example) even the window manager runs out-of-process; in NeWS, you could write the window manager in PostScript and run it directly in the window system process." 
The key might be it's ability to download and execute postscript code into a running application ... Cheers, Gil 
Sounds promising. 
Did NeWS also allow external programs to take over a part of a NeWS window and display content in it? 
A simple example might a clock program that runs on the client side. 
BTW, from the press coverage of the Eolas/Microsoft trial, it appears that Microsoft only looked for prior art in the context of Web browsers. 
Not sure why they didn't also look at BBS software, X11, and NeWS.

If I can recall back that far (around 1988 :) X11 was actually a thread running in the NeWS server (xnews) so that applications could poke through their own content. 
The basic idea of NeWS was that the user interface part of an application (i.e., drawing a selection box) would run on the local machine and simply send the higher-level results (i.e. the two corners of the selection) to an application running on a server. 
The side-effect of this was lower network bandwidth requirements than X11 (only two co-ordinates are sent at the end of an operation rather than each mouse movement).
