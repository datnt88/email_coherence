We're trying to organize a joint f2f ER/PF around XML 2000 in Washington DC (Dec 3-8). 
We're thinking of 2 days. 
Are people more interested in something before (Friday 1/Saturday 2) something during the week, or something at the end of the XML 2000 week ? 
There is a lot of ER interest in DC. 
This sounds like a good feature of this plan. 
For PF purposes I could possibly round up some metadata expertise. 
I believe I could handle any of these.

Dec 4-7 there will be one or two days in which I'll have to be in PA to give a talk... don't know the date yet. 
Other days OK so far.

1 December would not be ideal for me, but no problems in general.
