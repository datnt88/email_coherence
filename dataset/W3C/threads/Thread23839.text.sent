I did not receive the FAQ or whatever on this list, but instead began receiving random messages. 
I don't really mind being on the list as interesting discussions do take place here, but is always nice to know how one came to be on a particular list... Vivek My guess is that you are subscribed to www-font@netscape.com which is a mail exploder inside netscape. 
You are not on www-font@w3.org's 
distribution list. 
Please contact your system adminstrator to be removed from you internal list. 
I'm getting slightly annoyed by people complaining in public about this list. 
Please consider [1] before sending a message not relevant to fonts.
