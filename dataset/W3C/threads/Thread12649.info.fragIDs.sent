<s> Hi everyone What is your opinion of the Widgit software?  </s>
<s> I've been approached by a UK Government Department who are considering using Widgit on an alternative version of their site.  </s>
<s> An example of Widgit in practice can be viewed at The Widgit homepage is at http://www.widgit.com/  </s>
<s> Kind regards Julie Howell Campaigns Officer (Internet) Royal National Institute for the Blind 224 Great Portland Street, London W1W 5AA, UK Jhowell@rnib.org.uk 1.7 million people in the UK experience a serious sight problem or blindness.  </s>

<s> The Meldreth Manor website is worth a very good look.  </s>
<s> The author is very well known, and produces excellent resources.  </s>
<s> Photographs are an essential part of the experience, as is sound, (mine's not working at the minute.)*  </s>
<s> Staff often complain (to me) that images and text are very hard to edit, or format, after publication in widgit.  </s>
<s> eg on this page: you will find that all the text and symbols are one large gif.  </s>
<s> Perhaps Julie could expand on the benefits of widgit.  </s>
<s> I would be excited to see draft pages, (for the proposed site) produced by skilled operators, with widgit.  </s>

<s> To celebrate, there will be a slightly slow site (~80-160kb/page, or more), 'THINGS WE DO' with sound, photographs, symbols and text, and hopefully fully accessible.  </s>
<s> just at the moment I'm suffering from hd failure, screech, screech, clunk.  </s>
<s> How about: "UK's Hague seeks policy tersification"?  </s>
<s> Love.  </s>
<s> ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE  </s>
