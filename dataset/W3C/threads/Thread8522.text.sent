Hello all, I tried from both home and work, and the telecon system keeps claiming that the passcode is invalid. 
Did anyone else have this problem? 
Thanks, John Boyer Software Development Manager UWI.Com -- The Internet Forms Company Yes - but it worked after several tries Hello all, I tried from both home and work, and the telecon system keeps claiming that the passcode is invalid.

Thanks, John Boyer Software Development Manager UWI.Com -- The Internet Forms Company Hi Don, It works now for me too. 
Perhaps it was too busy at the time. 
I phoned their customer support to look into it. 
In the end though, if this happens to anyone again, it appears that an operator will eventually pick up and transfer a person directly if necessary. 
John Boyer Software Development Manager UWI.Com -- The Internet Forms Company I just punched in 79949 and it worked fine for me. 
If you get an operator, I'm listed as the contact for the call. 
They should be able to find it under my name or under the call in number and time even if you have the wrong passcode... Sorry, Donald Donald E. Eastlake, 3rd 17 Skyline Drive, Hawthorne, NY 10532 USA home: 65 Shindegan Hill Road, RR#1, Carmel, NY 10512 USA "Joseph M. Reagle Jr." reagle@w3.org
