<s> Can anyone comment on the improvements (if any)?  </s>
<s> Flash MX makes it possible for Web developers to deliver Flash content to the visually impaired.  </s>
<s> I can say that involving developers early on in accessibility is key.  </s>
<s> For example, two years ago the United States Mint, we were a heavy Flash user.  </s>
<s> We also submitted a technique to make it accessible with instructions on how to do so.  </s>
<s> Now my application manager there, has gone on to work for Allaire now Macromedia as a senior manager.  </s>
<s> His introduction to accessibility has helped to keep Flash and accessibility on the radar site for us.  </s>
<s> By the way he is co-author on their books.  </s>
<s> This paragraph is in no way to give him 'carte blanc' credit as there are many others helping and especially the accessibility group at Macromedia deserves credit.  </s>
<s> Just another reason to introduce everyone to accessibility as early as possible because you never know where they will land and be in a position to help you back.  </s>
<s> This is a wonderful first step and it's a long time coming....but the onus is really on the webdesigners to use the accessibility features in Flash and other programs.  </s>
<s> You can add all the features you want -- but if nobody uses them.....? I think it's so important to educate the design community about the accessibility issues faced by so many internet users -- software can be modified, but some designers' attitudes can't.  </s>
<s> There are a couple interesting discussions about the usability of Flash on the alt.design.graphics  </s>
<s> newsgroup -- some of you who are interested in accessible design might want to take a peek or jump right in.  </s>
<s> I need a couple more pro-accessibility people to jump in on my side!  </s>
<s> And then what about the issue of bandwidth accessibility?  </s>
<s> Colour blindness?  </s>
<s> Again, these issues are resolved at the design level -- no amount of software features will help unless shortsighted designers are willing to implement an accessibility plan that takes more people into consideration.  </s>
