Hi all, Sorry to start on a somber note, but as fond as I am of Amaya, it has a bug which is a very real problem for me. 
It does not function on remote displays, which also prevents it's use with ltsp systems. 
I have recently been asked by the managers of thinkquest africa (the largest web-design competition in Africa) to provide suggestions on how to make webpages multi-browser compatible. 
My first suggestion was to ensure conformity to w3 standards. 
I also develope a thin-client solution, used in hundreds of African schools. 
My seccond suggestion would be to use Amaya as web-editor, which pre-empts a lot of the common problems people have with standards compliance. 
However, this would remove the possibility from anybody using my solution - unless this is fixed. 
The problem lies with Amaya's usage of GDK, which on any remote display throws an error: integer out of range. 
I have confirmed that this affects both the source and binary distributions of Amaya. 
The OpenGL version is not really an option. 
I am only now working on trying to get software glx support on the clients (it is very difficult) 
and I have no guarantee it would work. 
Even if it did, it will be painfully slow, most of these thin-client machines are 100mhz CPU's with 24mb's of ram, I am only interested in it as an interim compatibility measure for educational software that requires it, e.g. modeling programs. 
I appreciate any help.

It works here Amaya 8.0 using X11 forwarding and ssh (on a Xfree 4.3 from a Xfree 4.1, both using gtk 1.2.10) 
Perhaps it's a special homepage page with some special fonts ? 
Does other gtk apps works fine with remote display ? 
We need more information... 
which version ? 
Using Mesa ? 
Just download it from mesa3d.org. 
I just do a ./configure 
&amp;&amp; make install If it's too slow, you could try http://fabrice.bellard.free.fr/TinyGL/ 
But did the GL version worked ?

The full error messages is: Gdk-ERROR **: 86 serial 190 error_code 86 request_code 51 minor_code 0 That is on thin clients, If I try to do X port forwarding on SSH it complains about an integer out of range as well. 
Unfortunatly those error doesn't help us much... as they are internals to gtk We need some information about your configuration... Could you give use the results from #xdpyinfo do you see a line with "MIT-SHM" in the extensions list? 
#echo $DISPLAY could you try a homepage without any image (perhaps it's related to MIT-SHM ?) if you can compile Amaya from the source, try adding this line : gdk_set_use_xshm (FALSE); just before gdk_imlib_init (); in Amaya/thotlib/dialogue/dialogapi.c:1966: -Paul 
I finally managed to get OpenGL working, tuxracer is running on the clients now (painfully slow as it is pure software). 
I then downloaded and tried Amaya 8 opengl, and I am sorry to report that I got the exact same error.

Well, I've been busy looking every single documentation about this, and cannot find anything related to this. 
From the programmer point of view, we shouldn't do anything special to make our app working with remote X, It is transparent, that's the point of X programmation. 
As it works fine here, I cannot reproduce the bug and thus help you... 
All I can do is to give you this pointer : Make sure you're not using a buggy version of GTK nor Xfree... (Xfree  4 and gtk  = 1.2.10) -Paul
