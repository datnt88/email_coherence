I'm fairly sure Kelly Pierce is using Lynx 2.8. 
I also thought it supported SSL connections, but when my ISP (Smartnet) upgraded to this version, I discovered SSL support is lacking. 
Perhaps there is some configuration setting to turn it on -- if so, I'd like to know about it.

PwWebSpeak is working on a SSL compliant version. 
NCant answer for JFW or WinVision, can anyone else? 
NSSL is more secure than an open line and it offers better security Nthan when I give my card to the waiter who disappears into another Nroom. 
SSL provides browser to server security. 
If someone breaks Nthis, then they are more than a novice hacker. 
NI'd be more concerned as to how the CTA is maintaining the data and Nservers. 
But that is getting off the subject. 
NSSL is good and the browser manufactures need to hurry and be Ncomplaint. 
I can't believe that their business development teams Nmissed this product discriminator.

Al, When you have time, I think it would be great if the we knew how to use SSL with Lynx. 
Could you coordinate a written response and post somewhere on how this is done? 
Also, Al, we thank you for volunteering smile . 
I can see the payback coming!

Has anyone asked Kelly Pierce if he/she has tried other browsers to use? 
Does Kelly own other browsers? 
I know they are costly as compared to the free Lynx. 
Seems here is an opportunity for companies like pwWebSpeak, WinVision and JFW that do or will work with SSL to aggressively market the Big Cities. 
The purpose would be to offer either per seat or enterprise license that the City can purchase and provide to PWDs for free! 
This is great timing for them! 
And a possible solution for the City and PWDs? 
Note this is a question mark and I am already ducking to avoid the kindly flame Are there other avenues, such as the Social Security Administration where PWDs can possibly obtain these browsers. 
I apologize for my lack of "how to", but once, if I heard right, David Poehlman mentioned the Social Security Administration has helped some people in some way. 
I just cant remember. 
Has anyone tried this? 
In the past, I know pwWebSpeak and JFW have been on the WAI IG, can someone please forward this message to them and please include Winvision. 
Many thanks, rob Of Jamal Mazrui

Lynx *can* use SSL, but doesn't in the default distribution. 
Because SSL can not be exported under the US's bizarre encryption laws, SSL- enabled Lynx couldn't be placed on a public FTP server. 
There are places where you can request SSL patches for Lynx (start at yourself. 
I had some trouble doing this with Lynx 2.8.

I am confused why the US encryption laws would be a barrier. 
Couldn't lynx just use 64 bit encryption like the normal version of Netscape and Internet Explorer do? 
It is only the strongly encrypted (128 bit) that you have to promise not to give to foreign drug dealers.

Netscape distributes a compiled binary. 
(I don't believe Mozilla includes SSL.) Lynx is distributed as source; the difference between 64- and 128-bit encryption is, I believe, only a change in a constant; exporting the algorithm itself (in machine-readable form) is illegal.

Subject: Re: information access at chicago transit authority Using an unsecure means of sending credit card data might be an option if you have no other means of using a particular service. 
Some might be hysterical about the thought; however, these individuals are often less concerned when credit card data is shared on cellular or cordless telephones. 
The security of cellular telephones was highlighted last year when a Florida couple audio taped a politically sensitive conference call with leaders of the republican party. 
There is little evidence to show that using an unsecure means of providing a credit card number significantly increases fraud. 
Further, no one is advocating using e-mail or other unsecure methods to information to the agency or leave it on a dedicated voice mail line. 
We cannot stay stuck in either/or binary thinking. 
the CTA will not communicate with us on this issue, so our recourse was to go legal and discuss their obligations with federal officials that regulate them and their attorneys. 
We discovered that many Internet service providers nationally and in the Chicago area have not upgraded to Lynx 2.8. 
When they have, some have not implemented the security feature. 
yes, people can switch to Explorer. 
Many don't realize that is an unrealistic choice for blind persons living day to day on Social Security and a fixed income, where the entrance fee to use Windows is $800--the cost of a brand new Pentium computer. 
Most of our members in Chicago use Lynx more than any other browser. 
True browsers don't have legal rights, but the people with disabilities that use them do. 
the law is quite clear. 
The responsibility for access as effective as that for non-disabled persons is the responsibility of the transit agency. 
blind persons have no legal right to force internet service providers to implement secure web browsing. 
However, we do have the right to litigate the access of our local transit agency as it concerns Section 35.160 of title II. 
We must acknowledge that accessibility to secure web browsing is not as simple or as easy for blind persons as it is for non-disabled persons. 
We expect CTA to deal with that fact and provide options for us and for our federal officials to encourage the development of these options. 
Perhaps there could be more discussion on solutions. 
How could blind persons who are Lynx users purchase monthly passes and fare cards online without incurring significant expenses?

Is it correct that there is SSL software available for Unix systems which acts as a proxy server, thus allowing a user agent that does not support SSL directly to complete a secure transaction? 
Also, I have heard it said that in order to use SSL, it is necessary to generate a certificate, and apparently this is difficult even if Lynx has been compiled with the SSL software included. 
Unfortunately I can't remember the source of this information and it might therefore be inaccurate. 
Needless to say, SSL is not a W3C standard. 
I suppose this ought not to preclude our discussing it, at least to the extent that it has special implications for people who use text-based user agents such as Lynx or Emacs/W3.
