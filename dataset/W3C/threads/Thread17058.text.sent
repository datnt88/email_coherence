I've a poll in the past if it wuld be handy to put up a website with a list of accessible sites and a list of inaccessible sites. 
Both with a top 10 list. 
Periodicly this top 10 could be send out to the webmasters of these sites. 
I'm still willing to put up, maintain, and host such a website Christian Not sure if this is the same thing (accessible/CSS designs), but here's a 'collection of nearly 800 table-free CSS designs': Was posted on the Web Standards Project website recently: This used to be webnoveau which seemed to vanish a couple of months back. 
Luckily the person behind meryl.net 
resurected it. 
Regards Francis Hi, Yes I have/still intend to compile a list of accessible and good looking websites - however I have held-off from starting this until the re-design of the MCU is finished so that I could launch both at the same time. 
However the redesign is taking longer than I expected so I have set up a page to list sites at Please feel add your site to the page using the form provided. 
When I have some time I intend to create a more sophisticated listing/rating system.

Scottish Disability Information Mailing list: Thanks to Lynn Alford for pointing out to me that there was a problem with the form on the page I previously mentioned, i.e. the page to add your accessible and good looking site to. 
Please use the page at http://www.mcu.org.uk/campaigns/accessible.html 
This just uses a simple comment form at the bottom of the page - but it works fine for now - and I will change it to something more sophisticated as soon as I can. 
Please add your great looking and accessible site to the list; make it easy for other to find a list of well designed and accessible sites.
