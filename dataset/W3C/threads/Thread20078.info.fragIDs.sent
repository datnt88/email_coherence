Hi, I downloaded Amaya version V3.2.1 from your web site and tried to use it to view a simple XML file listed below This is a body test with external cascade style sheet. 
AND the style sheet file style.css is located under the same directory of the XML file, style.css 
contents: body {display:block} However, Amaya will display the original contents of the XML file. 
Could you tell me what I am missing here in order to view XML files. 
Thank you, Oliver Yuan Rasterex, Inc. 
What's missing? 
Full support of generic XML in Amaya. 
The current version only supports some XML languages, namely XHTML, MathML, XLink, and, in the next release, a subset of SVG. 
There are plans for supporting generic XML, i.e. documents using namespaces that Amaya is not aware of. 
But this won't be in the next release. 
Vincent.

If by "the tool for the new standards" you are referring to the new IE5.5 
XML parser, the beta of the MS XML parser version 3.0 (which they are claiming is 100% compliant with XSLT/Xpath, though I've had problems with Xpath predicates) is available at You also have to download the xmlinst.exe 
utility and readme file (linked there), and read the installation instructions in that readme very carefully and thoroughly (basically, after you install MSXML3 and xmlinst, you have to run from the command line 'xmlinst msxml3' - but don't quote me on that; if you don't run xmlinst, you're stuck with "side by side" support of XSLT and of the earlier Microsoft variant thereof) or you'll end up having to reinstall IE5.5 and having an all-around bad day. 
Mozilla/Netscape 6 will have a third-party plugin (MITRE), Transformiix, to do XSLT transforms; since Mozilla hasn't promised XSLT for this version (Moz 1/NS 6), don't count on much - see the readme at ml . 
Mozilla is also working on MathML.
