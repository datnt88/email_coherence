All. According to WCAG 1.0, labels for form controls should appear immediatly before the control (or above it if there is only one control on the line). 
This usually means the label should appear just to the left of the control. 
This is fine for text entry fields and boxes and pull-down menus. 
However, for checkboxes and radio buttons, you often want to place the label to the right of the checkbox or radio button. 
Does doing this violate the guideline? 
What are the current views of people on this issue.

I would say this does violate the guideline, as from my perspective I would expect that the reasoning behind this checkpoint is for people using screen-readers: they need to know what the option is before they select it. 
So for example, having the radio button to the left of the text would mean the screen-reader would read "Radio button unchecked. 1 pack. 
Radio button unchecked. 
2 packs" etc. All.

I do wish we could find a way to phrase this that separates the appearance on the page from the way the information is presented to or by the screen reader. 
For instance, in PDF, I can place the label before the radio button in the structure tree, even though the checkbox is to the left of the label. 
I realize that mark-up languages may not have this flexibility. 
Loretta I believe screen readers expect to find and look for the prompts for radio buttons and checkboxes to the right of the controls. 
The assistive technology when speaking in "forms mode" decides how it is going to speak the gathered information. 
With a check box and the "prompt" to the right of the checkbox: HPR: prompt checked JFW: prompt Check Box Checked Window-Eyes: Check Box Checked prompt. 
Window-Eyes is not speaking it that way because the prompt is on the right; they treat all controls the same way, Window-Eyes: Edit Box prompt When the "prompt" is to the left of the INPUT of type text. 
This is also the way these three AT's speak form elements when the LABEL element is used with the for attribute.

Loretta Well, PDF is a markup language. 
Some others have the same flexibility, some do not. 
We have a technique for doing this in HTML, using the label element. 
It relies on the manufacturers implementing the specifications - otherwise we have to guess what they will implement and try to code that instead, which leads to a mess. 
If the group could decide that user agents now associate labels with form controls, the checkpoint would no longer be applicable anyway. 
Do we have some data and a way of determining how to make the decision?

Otherwise yes, the checkpoint says 'label before control', so not doing that violates it.

Location: 21 Mitchell street FOOTSCRAY Vic 3011, Australia (or W3C INRIA, Route des Lucioles, BP 93, 06902 Sophia Antipolis Cedex, France) Hmmm I think we need to separate this into two questions. 
1) what does WCAG 1.0 actually say. 
2) what should it (or WCAG 2.0) say. 
I think that 2.0 should NOT require radio buttons be to the right. 
This is not according to convention -- and often won?t work well visually. 
1.0 should not require it -- but the wording may imply that. 
If so we should post a note that the position rule is not to apply to radio buttons or checkboxes as a requirement for compliance.

For a list of our listserves send ?lists? to listproc@trace.wisc.edu 1 immediatly I think the wording in version 1 does require the labels to follow the controls. 
I don't know what is best, but if we can establish that the label element works well enough we can simply publish that information and point out that therefore the checkpoint is no longer applicable in 1.0 I would note that the requirement to position the name t the right breaks i18n requirements anyway... cheers Charles Hmmm I think we need to separate this into two questions.
