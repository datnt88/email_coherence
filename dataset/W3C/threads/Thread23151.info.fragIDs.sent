The MutationEvents module says this about the DOMSubtreeModified event: 
This is a general event for notification of all changes to the document. 
It can be used instead of the more specific events listed below. 
It may be fired after a single modification to the document or, at the implementation's discretion, after multiple changes have occurred. 
The latter use should generally be used to accomodate multiple changes which occur either simultaneously or in rapid 
succession. 
I read this to say that an implementation can support the MutationEvents module even if it never fires anything more specific than DOMSubtreeModified events. 
Furthermore, although it is not recommended, 
an implementation may legally choose to fire an event of this type only after every 100 modifications to the document, or every 30 seconds if any changes have happened during that interval. 
Am I reading this correctly? 
Is the intent that when a call to a single DOM method such as Range.extractContents() causes many mutation events this event is the one that is fired last, as kind of a summary of all changes that have occurred?

No. DOMSubtreeModified is fired in addition to more specific mutation events. 
The intent was to indicate that some applications may find that listening only for DOMSubtreeModified suffices for their needs. 
As I read/remember it: Yes and no. 
The only promise made is that DOMSubtreeModified will eventually be fired after the DOM has been altered. 
It may be more often, or less often, than once per DOM method call, " at the implementation's discretion." 
I expect that most implementations will tend to favor the once-per-method interpretation, but that may not be convenient for the logic of some, and may be overkill for others which know these method calls are part of a higher-level operation.

Thanks for the clarification, Joe. 
Then let me suggest that the phrase "It can be used" is misleading and ought to be clarified. 
The rest of this section of the spec is addressed to DOM implementors and tells them when their implementation must fire events. 
This one sentence isn't an instruction to implementors, but instead a suggestion to DOM programmers. 
This context switch really tripped me up. 
I suggest that the sentence be changed to read: Clients of the DOM may prefer to listen for events of this type instead of the more specific event types listed below.
