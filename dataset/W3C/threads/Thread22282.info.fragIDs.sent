<s> Please somebody explain to me, why Attribute shoulld be a Node.  </s>
<s> Is it possible Attibute have some child Nodes?  </s>
<s> What will be happen if insertBefore() is called like below?  </s>
<s> myNode.insertNode(myAttribute,  </s>
<s> prevNode);  </s>
<s> If the answers are 'No' and 'Error', again, why Attribute shoulld be a Node?  </s>
<s> After asking whether Attr can have children (which it can), your example tries to use an Attr as a child node, which it can not be.  </s>
<s> This is not unique to Attr.  </s>
<s> Also Document and DocumentFragment are never child nodes.  </s>
<s> But each of these three can be the root of a hierarchy of values.  </s>
<s> Section 1.1.1 in the recommendation gives a list of which nodes are parents and children of which other nodes.  </s>
<s> Attr has to be a node so that it can have entity references in addition to text as children.  </s>
<s> But it is never a child node, which would make as little sense as making a Document or DocumentFragment a child node.  </s>
<s> There are getAttribute and setAttribute functions on Element so that users who do not need to manipulate entity references inside attributes can ignore attributes as nodes.  </s>
<s> Some implementations may never actually construct nodes for the attribute values if the nodes are never explicitly requested.  </s>

<s> To answer the other question:  </s>
<s> As I read it, that should cause the DOM to throw a HIERARCHY_REQUEST_ERR since Attribute is not an acceptable child of any node.  </s>
<s> See the documentation for Node, which includes a table indicating what parent/child relationships are legal.  </s>
<s> Joe Kesselman / IBM Research Unless stated otherwise, all opinions are solely those of the author.  </s>
<s> Whups.  </s>
<s> That parent/child table is in section 1.1.1, and the previous answer did mention it.  </s>
<s> Sorry about that.  </s>
<s> Good question, though.  </s>
<s> I'll propose that it be added to the FAQ.  </s>
<s> Joe Kesselman / IBM Research Unless stated otherwise, all opinions are solely those of the author.  </s>
<s> Thanks a lot for your reply.  </s>
<s> Let me ask a little more.  </s>
<s> 1.  </s>
<s> Is it possible a Attribute have 'value', 'Text', 'Entity Reference' simultaneously ?  </s>
<s> And How it is represented by XML as a text?  </s>
<s> 2. Is it possible a Attribute have several 'Text' Nodes or 'Entity Reference' Nodes?  </s>
<s> And How these multi-values can be represented by XML as a text?  </s>
<s> After asking whether Attr can have children (which it can), your example tries to use an Attr as a child node, which it can not be.  </s>
<s> This is not unique to Attr.  </s>
