From: Peter Lenahan (pjl@ibi.com) 
May I ask for a feature in the next version HTTP 1.1 I have read the HTTP 1.1 spec and searched for this and couldn't find a solution. 
The closest thing that I found was Content-Location: URI This is what I would like: Content-Name: URI The Content-Name would formally name the data, this would give the browser a name to save a file under when the user is prompted in the browser's save dialog box. 
Reason for the request: I have a CGI generating a Microsoft Excel Spread sheet dynamically from a database. 
The user get's back a Content-type: application/x-xls that it may or may not understand. 
The user is asked to open or save the data. 
Currently there doesn't appear to be an HTTP way of setting the name of the data to save to the local machine. 
I thought that the browser companies may have added extension-header's as the spec suggests, but I was not that lucky. 
Thanks, Peter Lenahan pjl@ibi.com

Hi Peter, The upcoming update of the HTTP 1.1 specification RFC includes a description of the feature you want. 
This is not officially part of the standard but it is widely adopted in current browsers. 
I have included the draft text (from draft-ietf-http-v11-spec-rev-03.txt) below.

--snip-- 19.5.1 Content-Disposition The Content-Disposition response-header field has been proposed as a means for the origin server to suggest a default filename if the user requests that the content is saved to a file. 
This usage is derived from the definition of Content-Disposition in RFC 1806 [35]. 
content-disposition = "Content-Disposition" ":" disposition-type *( ";" disposition-parm ) disposition-type = "attachment" | disp-extension-token disposition-parm = filename-parm | disp-extension-parm filename-parm = "filename" "=" quoted-string disp-extension-token = token disp-extension-parm = token "=" ( token | quoted-string ) An example is The receiving user agent should not respect any directory path information that may seem to be present in the filename-parm parameter, which is the only parameter believed to apply to HTTP implementations at this time. 
The filename should be treated as a terminal component only. 
[If this header is used in a response with the application/octet-stream content-type,(*)] the implied suggestion is that the user agent should not display the response, but directly enter a `save response as...' dialog. 
See section 15.5 for Content-Disposition security issues. 
(*) This half-sentence seems to have been dropped from the 03 revision, it was still in the 01 revision. 
Editing error? 
I'll raise this as an issue. 
I just noticed that half of a sentence disappeared in section 19.5.1 (Content-Disposition) of draft-ietf-http-v11-spec-rev-0[23].txt. 
My original draft (http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/http/hypermail/1997q2/0151.html) and revision 01 had: If this header is used in a response with the application/octet-stream content-type, the implied suggestion is that the user agent should not display the response, but directly enter a `save response as..' dialog. 
Revisions 02 and 03 have: The implied suggestion is that the user agent should not display the response, but directly enter a `save response as...' dialog. 
I guess there has been some type of editorial error. 
The original text is correct, the new text is incorrect as a description of existing practice. 
User agents (at least the ones I tested) will *not* directly enter a 'save as' dialog if Content-Disposition is present on, say, a normal text/html response. 
The text/html will be displayed as a normal response and the filename in Content-Disposition is only used if the user does 'save as' manually.
