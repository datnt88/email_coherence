Just to clarify a couple of points if I managed to muddle them in that article (which, for what it's worth, was written to start dialogs like this and talk about what works and what doesn't rather than accept anyone else's opinion that something stinks because it didn't work in their particular implementation): I don't think I wrote anywhere in there that we should simply dismiss and/or ignore accessibility/useability issues. 
On the contrary, use of CSS2 will augment alternate client accessibility by pointing to printable/viewable pages, etc. And any current technology doesn't preclude disabled users from accessing anything - the designer/developer does that by not using available methods of providing that access. 
What I hope to stop is not progress toward a standardized, open Web but rather the continual process of propping up pages to work in outmoded/outdated browsers using workarounds that take up too much time which may create an atmosphere of fear of new capabilities (including those designed to open up Web access) because we're so busy covering up past mistakes. 
I am certainly not opposed to an open Web and no one wants to necessarily exclude an audience -- but I also do not wish to settle for what we have now. 
Lance P.S. I can't replicate any errors viewing glassdog in Netscape 4.5 (and, for the record, no, it was designed to work in all current browser releases) - What error does it report? 
Very interesting article! 
referencing (http://www.alistapart.com/stories/lance1.html) To Lance, I think the only place you are right is that we should keep trying to be inovative and keep pushing the design envelope. 
BUT, what about people you use the web who are disabled, in someway, that makes it difficult to browse the web? 
BTW since you believe that we should be designing to the highest level. 
Check your Javascript, it even gives an error in Netscape 4.5 or did you design for MSIE??? 
This proves the contradiction to your article. 
Sorry.

You know, I don't particularly disagree with Lance on this one myself. 
We have to keep in mind several points: * Many old and current browsers are SERIOUSLY BROKEN when it comes to correct handling of HTML. 
* HTML 4.0 is designed so that it degrades gracefully in non-broken browsers that correctly implemented HTML 2.0 or 3.2. 
* There is nothing wrong with using new technologies, including whiz- bang multimedia stuff, as long as you do it right, and that includes providing alternative content. 
* HTML 4.0 is a new technology itself, and it incorporates many new features that are _necessary_ because older versions of HTML did _not_ have the full range of features needed for accessible web pages. 
Even if you coded exactly to the HTML 2.0 or 3.2 standard, you might not have been producing an accessible page. 
HTML 4.0 -- a new technology -- is vital to accessibility! 
So, while I didn't bother to read all of Lance's article, I think his points stated in email to this list shouldn't be dismissed.

No doubt about this. 
The majority of web sites and pages that I see today are based on HTML 3.2. 
Even those sites seem to implement some 4.0 constructs, but not all (which of course is a indicator that many web sites are not validating).
