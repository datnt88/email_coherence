HI, I have been using amaya for some time. 
Great tool ! 
However, I am missing something which looks like an important item : The Table of Contents. 
I know there is a view to it. 
But I could not find anywhere a way to insert it in the final HTML page. 
This is a little annoying as I have to use different tools for that sole purpose (like asWedit). 
Am I missing somthing ? 
If not, why can't we insert the table of contents that Amaya produces anyway ? 
Thank you Philippe Hi, the Table of contents is simply a particular view of the document - nothing new is generated (as far as I know). 
It would require some coding to add the TOC at the beginning - interested??

Thank you Philippe Hi, It makes sense to have a function that generates a table of contents and links. 
If we have enough time, we'll provide it in the next release. 
Today that ToC is only display into a separated window and can be printed, but it's not added to the document's contents. 
Irene.
