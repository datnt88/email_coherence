WHAT I HAVE SO FAR. 
Applicable AU checkpoints: Evaluation Process: (1) Does the tool allow users to insert image elements into a markup document (Web authoring tool, word processessor)? 
YES: The tool is a "Markup Editor". 
(2) Does the tool allow users to create or edit images (paint or drawing program)? 
YES: The tool is an "Image Editor". 
If the tool is a "Markup Editor" then complete section A. If the tool is an "Image Editor" then complete section B. If the tool a "Markup Editor" and an "Image Editor" then complete both sections. 
A. Markup Editor A1. Are ALT and LONGDESC for IMG supported (HTML4) - ATAG 1.1? 
A2. Are the values of ALT and LONGDESC preserved during re-saving, reformatting, etc. - ATAG 1.2? 
A3. 
Is a meaningful ALT (or LONGDESC where necessary) present when images are part of auto-generated markup (wizard, etc.) - ATAG 3.1? 
B. Image Editor 1.3 Ensure that when the tool automatically generates markup it conforms to the W3C's Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 [WCAG10]. 
[Relative Priority] 1.4 Ensure that templates provided by the tool conform to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 [WCAG10]. 
[Relative Priority] 2.1 Use the latest versions of W3C Recommendations when they are available and appropriate for a task. 
[Priority 2] 2.2 Ensure that the tool automatically generates valid markup. 
[Priority 1] 2.3 If markup produced by the tool does not conform to W3C specifications, inform the author. 
[Priority 3] 3.1 Prompt the author to provide equivalent alternative information (e.g., captions, auditory descriptions, and collated text transcripts for video). 
[Relative Priority] 3.3 Ensure that prepackaged content conforms to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 [WCAG10]. 
[Relative Priority] 3.4 Do not automatically generate equivalent alternatives. 
Do not reuse previously authored alternatives without author confirmation, except when the function is known with certainty. 
[Priority 1] 3.5 Provide functionality for managing, editing, and reusing alternative equivalents for multimedia objects. 
[Priority 3] 4.1 Check for and inform the author of accessibility problems. 
[Relative Priority] 4.2 Assist authors in correcting accessibility problems. 
[Relative Priority] 4.3 Allow the author to preserve markup not recognized by the tool. 
[Priority 2] 5.1 Ensure that functionality related to accessible authoring practices is naturally integrated into the overall look and feel of the tool. 
[Priority 2] 5.2 Ensure that accessible authoring practices supporting Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 [WCAG10] Priority 1 checkpoints are among the most obvious and easily initiated by the author. 
[Priority 2] 6.2 Ensure that creating accessible content is a naturally integrated part of the documentation, including examples. 
[Priority 2] Jan Richards Access Software Designer Adaptive Technology Resource Centre University of Toronto Here is my part of evaluation process worked out a little better. 
It has been re-formatted as a kind of checklist. 
Cheers, Jan Jan Richards Access Software Designer Adaptive Technology Resource Centre University of Toronto Hello, Here is the updated version of the image part. 
I have added a number of things: 1. Image map equivalent alternatives to the list of things the evaluator needs to look for. 
2. A section to explain what equivalent alternatives are. 
3. Priority levels to the EAs and P1, P2 and P3 versions of the same questions so that the relative checkpoints will work. 
Have a good weekend, Jan Jan Richards Access Software Designer Adaptive Technology Resource Centre University of Toronto
