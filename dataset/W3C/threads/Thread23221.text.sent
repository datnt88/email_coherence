Apologies for the nitpicks, but since the DOM Level 3 will likely become a Recommendation, may as well be precise. 
In http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Core/introduction.html is the following Note: "Note: OMG IDL is used only as a language-independent and implementation- neutral way to specify interfaces. 
Various other IDLs could have been used ([COM], [Java IDL], [MIDL], ...). 
In general, IDLs are designed for specific computing environments. 
The Document Object Model can be implemented in any computing environment, and does not require the object binding runtimes generally associated with such IDLs." 
The same language is in the DOM Level 2 Core (http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM- Level-2-Core/introduction.html). 
Proposal #1: Replace the second sentence of the Note ("Various other IDLs could have been used ([COM], [Java IDL], [MIDL], ...).") with: "Other IDLs such as [MIDL] could have been used." 
Delete the Java IDL entry from I.2 ("Informative References"). 
Delete the COM entry from I.2 ("Informative References"). 
Rationale #1: Java IDL is not a different IDL than OMG IDL. 
JavaIDL is Sun's *implementation* of a CORBA-compliant ORB that is compatible with some level of OMG IDL. 
COM is arguably not itself an IDL. 
MIDL is the IDL used in COM, and MIDL is mentioned elsewhere in the note. 
Proposal #2: In I.2 ("Informative References"), the URL given for MIDL no longer works. 
I propose replacing it with one that does. 
Here's one that worked for me, today: http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en- us/midl/mi-laref_1r1h.asp 
Comment: If there's a need to list more than one alternative IDL, there are others. 
ONC RPC and DCE RPC come to mind, though these are not completely object- oriented.

... except that while MSFT's IDL (used with COM) was designed for a particular computing environment (C/C++ oriented, look at it in detail), that was explicitly a non-goal of OMG-IDL. 
In fact one of its design goals (one that was achieved!) was getting past some of those kinds of problems with DCE-IDL (from which MSFT borrowed heavily, ISTR :). It'd be worth saying that of the object-oriented IDLs in wide use at the time that DOM Level 1 was specified , OMG-IDL was the least bound to a specific computing environment. 
- Dave Better solution: "Many other IDLs exist which could have been used." 
To avoid implied endorsement, we should either cite multiple options or none.
