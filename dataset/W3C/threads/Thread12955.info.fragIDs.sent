<s> A few comments: 1.  </s>
<s> In addition to language differences (translations) we also need to account for 'cultural' differences.  </s>
<s> E.g. in Australia we tend to refer to "described video" (or video description) rather than Audio Description.  </s>
<s> 2. Why aren't we including all the WCAG/ATAG/UAAG glossary terms - these are the terms folk will come across as they read the Recs.  </s>
<s> As glossaries to Recs, these are already official W3C glossaries.  </s>
<s> If there are different definitions in different glossaries, then we should acknowledge this and provide the current and definitive one.  </s>
<s> In this way, WCAG 2.0 (and other new Recs) can just point to the "official" WAI glossary which can grow as required.  </s>
<s> 3. If the purpose is, as Henk said "to explain words used in WAI documents  </s>
<s> that might be difficult to understand by readers of several countries and backgrounds", then this isn't a WAI Glossary per-se, but rather an "Introduction" to (common) WAI terms/words.  </s>

<s> I don't understand what Henk is proposing.  </s>
<s> The draft WAI-Glossary [http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/Glossary/printable.html] already contains [all] the terms included in the list he provided.  </s>
<s> Is the suggestion to extract that subset of terms into a separate reference document?  </s>
<s> I admit I have not been a party to any of the discussions about the Glossary so perhaps I am missing some context.  </s>
<s> Regards, Chuck Letourneau Starling Access Services  </s>
<s> OK... now I understand what Henk is proposing (I read some background material that is scattered around the site).  </s>
<s> At this point, I would have to second the concerns Andrew mentioned in his e-mail of this morning (last evening?).  </s>
