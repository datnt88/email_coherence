Dear all, WAI-EO is planning to have a 'WAI-Glossary' to explain words used in WAI documents that might be difficult to understand by readers of several countries and backgrounds. 
The list below is a first proposal of the entries from the W3C-glossay that WAI-EO could take in consideration for such a 'WAI-glossary', done by Braillenet and Accessibility. 
Comments are welcome.

A few comments: 1. 
In addition to language differences (translations) we also need to account for 'cultural' differences. 
E.g. in Australia we tend to refer to "described video" (or video description) rather than Audio Description. 
2. Why aren't we including all the WCAG/ATAG/UAAG glossary terms - these are the terms folk will come across as they read the Recs. 
As glossaries to Recs, these are already official W3C glossaries. 
If there are different definitions in different glossaries, then we should acknowledge this and provide the current and definitive one. 
In this way, WCAG 2.0 (and other new Recs) can just point to the "official" WAI glossary which can grow as required. 
3. If the purpose is, as Henk said "to explain words used in WAI documents 
that might be difficult to understand by readers of several countries and backgrounds", then this isn't a WAI Glossary per-se, but rather an "Introduction" to (common) WAI terms/words.

I don't understand what Henk is proposing. 
The draft WAI-Glossary [http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/Glossary/printable.html] already contains [all] the terms included in the list he provided. 
Is the suggestion to extract that subset of terms into a separate reference document? 
I admit I have not been a party to any of the discussions about the Glossary so perhaps I am missing some context.

OK... now I understand what Henk is proposing (I read some background material that is scattered around the site). 
At this point, I would have to second the concerns Andrew mentioned in his e-mail of this morning (last evening?).
