Done some research on this and the only mention of Neomessenger that I can find on the Net is to do with a keychain where you can record a voice for up to 15 seconds. 
I don't think this is what you are talking about here Ken, could you possibly let us know where you got this information from? 
Kind regards Simon Has anyone used this service?

I received information about Neo Messenger through email. 
The product description from the website I have copied to this reply below. 
I have no problem accessing the website at http://www.neomessenger.com . 
More information is available there. 
I was just wondering if anyone on the list has used this product.
