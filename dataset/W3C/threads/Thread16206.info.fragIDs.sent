Hi anyone trying to access one of the sites mentioned in this article will get a 404 not found due to a tiny error. 
the uri is listed as: www.access-board.gov/RULES/ 508nprm.htm and it should be Because of a space between the front slash and 508, it renders a 404, not found. 
I thought you might like to know this if you are using the uri from this article. 
*Smile* I tried and that's how I found out.

One of the people quoted in this article, from the general services administration branch of the US government, is quoted as saying that all disabled people want to know is what is going on. 
Actually, I suspect that in a lot of cases they would like to be able to influence what is going on, at least to the same degree as everyone else. 
This is not just about access to information, it is about access to the opportunities which are available to the authors of that information. 
(But in general, I thought the article was pretty good). 
just my personal thoughts Charles McCN
