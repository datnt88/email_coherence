OK, apologies in advance for this one but an interesting problem has come up on another list and I was hoping that someone hear might know a bit more. 
The problem is with regard to the use of terminal emulation type software such as Citrix where a client uses applications running on remote servers via a purely graphical interface. 
Screen readers can't make any sense of these images so does anyone know of any research or bodies involved with looking into this accessibility problem? 
Obviously, in some cases it is straight forward to use a telnet session to perform or use such utilities but what about when this is not possible? 
Once again apologies for the abuse of this list but I hope people will forgive me this disgression on the grounds that it is a ligitimate concern.

In the case of VNC, it remotes the bit map, so is fundamentally incapable of accessing deeper semantics. 
I believe Citrix/Windows Terminal Server access at a slightly deeper level, but maybe not deep enough. 
I think Microsoft's implementation of Windows Terminal Server/Services follows The International Telecommunications Union (ITU) T.120 standard for data conferencing. 
See http://www.imtc.org/ for T.120 specs.
