<s> Caveat--- Even using correct styles/structure within Word will not guarantee proper html.  </s>
<s> There are 2 sets of styles within word that are exclusive of each other.  </s>
<s> Document styles, such as "Heading1, Heading2, etc." and HTML styles, such as "H1, H2..." the default new document in word is for document styles.  </s>
<s> the HTML styles do not appear in the style pull down on the tool bar.  </s>
<s> You must use the document styles.  </s>
<s> Then when you "save as html" you will get font tags without structure.  </s>
<s> It is possible to search and replace various combinations of font tags and replace with Hx tags, but it's not fun.  </s>
<s> In order to "save as html" properly, you must choose the blank web page from the available new document templates.  </s>
<s> then when writing and applying a style you must be sure to pick the HTML styles (H1, H2...)which appear after the document styles - Heading1, etc. on the tool bar pull down.  </s>
