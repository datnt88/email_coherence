<s> The opening in a new window debate keeps happening because people haven't made up their minds about the issue (this happens where I work at least).  </s>
<s> The concern is not just about accessibility but also about usability.  </s>
<s> The problem, I think, is that some people think that setting up outside links to  </s>
<s> open in a new window makes their site more usable.  </s>
<s> In my opinion, opening links onto new windows poses usability problems with the non-techie crowd.  </s>
<s> The folks who don't notice that a new window opened  </s>
<s> and that they can't hit the back button.  </s>
<s> If this confuses non-techie people  </s>
<s> who are sighted, I assume it would confuse non-techie individuals who are not sighted.  </s>
<s> So even though the answer to the open-in-new-window debate is simple for some of us, others are tempted to always add that target attribute to their links.  </s>

<s> Sent: Tuesday, November 18, 2003 8:21 AM Subject: re: "Special message to website creators" Why do we keep having these debates about opening new windows?  </s>
<s> We don't seem to be having debates about dialog boxes, or error message dialogs, or the various other GUI windows that have been used for over a decade by screen reader users.  </s>
<s> What problem are we trying to solve, the browser problem, an authoring problem, or what?  </s>
<s> For example, if the author codes the link to open in a new window, and the browser+AT doesn't inform the user (if she wants to be informed) then its a browser+AT problem.  </s>
<s> The default behavior of opening windows in Windows XP (and a lot of other GUIs) is good example of user configurability.  </s>
<s> It's not the authors/developers job to code around responsibilities of the browser+AT.  </s>

<s> A point to consider from a usability perspective: What about opening a help window?  </s>
<s> It is certainly much easier, assistive tech user or not, to have a help window open alongside a Web site tool, for instance, that describes how to use that tool, than it is to navigate between tool and help in the same window.  </s>
<s> New windows in some cases are a good thing, for accessibility and usability.  </s>

<s> Opening any new window can be distructive.  </s>
<s> It seems to me that it is much simpler and cleaner to keep us in the same window.  </s>
<s> If a new window is  </s>
<s> opened, I have to remember that it is there and I have to go back and forth between two windows if I want to read them.  </s>
<s> It's much eaiser and cleaner to  </s>
<s> use the back and forward buttons of the browser to achieve the same result among other ui features.  </s>
<s> I have real problems with anything that breaks ua  </s>
<s> functionality such as opening a new window and in the process, disabling the back button.  </s>

<s> Opening external URLs in a new window is a different story, but again a developer wants to keep you on his site.  </s>

<s> OK. You're missing my point.  </s>
<s> That being "You can't please all the people all the time".  </s>
<s> You are but one person (who incidentally is not pleased).  </s>
<s> If I give an option to turn off popups, would you be happy?  </s>

<s> When I had to re-engineer a Web-based application for the purposes of accessibility, the help was in JavaScript popups.  </s>
<s> (We actually had a controlled audience at the time - this is something that would have worked for all users.)  </s>
<s> The approach I took could be applied equally to a site/application that spawns new browser windows - re-draw the current page with the help text displayed in context.  </s>
<s> No to-ing and fro-ing with back/forward buttons or having to ALT/TAB between windows (or whatever system you use for this).  </s>
<s> Granted, this is easiest to achieve when you are generating pages dynamically but for static sites, a version with help and version without help could be produced.  </s>
<s> My personal view on spawning new windows is that it is only acceptable if the user agent can manage them in one window, such as with Mozilla's tabbed browsing.  </s>
<s> Even then, it should only be done with the user's consent.  </s>
