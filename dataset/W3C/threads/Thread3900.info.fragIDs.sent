<s> Thanks for your message, Joseph.  </s>
<s> Here are my comments.  </s>
<s> "I'll note this as more evidence that p3p:PURPOSE is likely to be a part of the vocabularly most likely to change.  </s>
<s> However, I'm thinking it will be useful to distinguish the meta "purpose" of "current" and "other" from the other terms.  </s>
<s> I expect you'd want to user both of those terms independent of the others...?" Yes, I do.  </s>
<s> In such a loosely coupled Web services execution environment, I am thinking whether we should have a general dictationary for p3p:PURPOSE (e.g., "current" and "other") and also some application-specific dictationaries (e.g., financial applications) for p3p:PURPOSE in different scenarios?  </s>
<s> "I haven't made an attempt at it yet -- has anyone else? -- but I hope to soon.  </s>
<s> However, even without doing so, I ask myself if: 1.  </s>
<s> Does the privacy statement belong at the SOAP level, or HTTP?  </s>
<s> In the majority of cases SOAP will be transported over HTTP, what happens if both of a HTTP statement?"  </s>
<s> I would expect that we may have to have P3P statements at both the HTTP (if applicable) and SOAP level.  </s>
<s> At the HTTP level, the P3P statements should work and behave the same as described in the original P3P Specification for the Web sites.  </s>
<s> At the SOAP level, the P3P statements should be on both general and application-oriented semantics (it may be hard).  </s>
<s> What do you think?  </s>
<s> "This is an interesting point, if the web service client isn't a web browser, it might not support cookies anyway.  </s>
<s> However, I don't think we can presume this just yet.  </s>
<s> Might be worth a few setences on the point."  </s>
<s> For your information, you can even send a SOAP message by a plain text e-mail message as long as the Web service can interpret e-mail message like those mailing list server (e.g., subscribe).  </s>
<s> "  2. Does the privacy statement belong at the WSDL level?  </s>
<s> Not every  </s>
<s> service must have a service description.  </s>
<s> And if they did for the purposes of privacy then *have* to fetch the WSDL before proceeding with the interaction?  </s>
<s> My sense here is that SOAP would trump the OPTIONAL WSDL definition.  </s>
<s> Referring to the first question, do we need separate P3P (privacy) policies for each operation (web method) in a Web service?  </s>
<s> Then, for the second question, it may be closely related to the matchmaking process between Web service requestors and providers.  </s>
<s> Oh, good point.  </s>
<s> I'll add this as an issue to the outline I'm working on."  </s>
<s> As WS-Policy is mainly for specifying the security requirements, I guess that there may have a flag to identify the privacy requirement in WS-Policy such as "require" or "not require."  </s>
<s> Then if the "require" flag is set to true, Web services must retrieve their WS-Privacy document (like P3P Policy) for validation by using APPEL?  </s>
<s> OR something like that.  </s>
<s> Do we have a meeting call on April 30?  </s>
<s> BTW: without the " " I have a hard time distinguishing your comments from your context..  </s>
<s> My inclination is that an application will specify which bindings its SOAP is supported with.  </s>
<s> *If* this is the case, then I would RECOMMEND that it define the SOAP statement as being inclusive of the SOAP interaction and the binding.  </s>
<s> Yep, though I expect HTTP will be very common.  </s>
<s> (In fact, it was recently reported that of Amazon's SOAP and REST (HTTP) interfaces, 85% of their usage is of the REST interface.)  </s>

<s> Let's talk about an application and a Web service.  </s>
<s> An application is trying to call an operation (e.g., Webmethod in .Net  </s>
<s> Web Sevices) in a Web service.  </s>
<s> Thus, the Web service have toy the SOAP bindings for its oerations.  </s>

<s> Let's call them as WS-Policies.  </s>
<s> I still try to guess what is WS-Policy :-).  </s>
<s> What should be the scenario in this situation?  </s>
<s> When do they exchange/match their WS-Policies before an interaction is taken?  </s>
<s> Yes, I agree with you.  </s>
