If you're doing this from a console, you'll need to use the DOS for ... in command. 
From a prompt, type "for /?" to get more information. 
You might want to dump to a file for ease of reading, printing, etc. "for /? c:\for.txt" 
You may also want to investigate the use of Windows Script Host to automate Tidy. 
More information available from the following URL: WSH allows the use of VBScript or JScript (as well as other Active Scripting languages) to write OS-level processing scripts. 
cheers, ~stuart I hope this is the right place to ask this question. 
I am trying to run html-tidy on an NT machine (actually, I'd love to run it on a solaris box, but haven't succeeded in downloading that version). 
What I =want= to do, is to process the files such that they are written to a new directory, something like html-tidy in/*.txt  out/*.txt 
This is not working. 
I can redirect single files html-tidy in/foo.txt  
out/foo.txt but not wildcards. 
Beyond that, as may be evinced from the non-html file ending, what I'm =really= trying to do with this group of files is to process some text files that contain html, but which are not, in and of themselves html. 
In an ideal world, this would mean that I'd have a way to suppress the html header and footer, but I can find no way to do so. 
Is there anything to be done?

The MSDOS console doesn't expand wildcards before calling programs. 
In principle Tidy could include the code for doing this for DOS, but I haven't gotten around to that. 
A workaround is to run tidy from within a script. 
You might place your text in comments, but HTML Tidy is designed for tidying HTML and not text files with odd bits of markup.
