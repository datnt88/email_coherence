<s> Hi, This is the first of several messages reporting my initial findings of my evaluation of the Guidelines.  </s>
<s> I will post separate messages on separate topics.  </s>
<s> These reports are later than I'd hoped, but I hope there is still time to address the issues.  </s>
<s> Some participants have been confused when they have used particular tags suggested by the Guidelines and then not been able to see or test the result with their browser (usually Netscape or IE).  </s>
<s> This occurred particularly with tags that were perceived to be 'special' for accessibility.  </s>
<s> For example: LONGDESC, TABLE summary, ID / headers (for table cells) I suggest that the Guidelines (techniques) include notes that point out that particular techniques will not be 'visible' to them, but will be available to future browsers and/or assistive technology.  </s>
<s> Chetz PS the tags mentioned above are the ones that were highlighted - there may be others.  </s>

<s> The guidelines should mention that HTML is an information rich language that implementation is typically media dependent.  </s>
<s> For example, that TABLE's summary and longdesc is markup that is typically implemented better in aural browsers than in graphical ones.  </s>
<s> That META is better implemened by robots compared to Netscape, but still authors write it since *some* user agents make use of it, and it doesn't harm the others.  </s>
<s> This applies to most of HTML4.0 new features.  </s>
<s> I disagree that there are "accessibility only" features in HTML.  </s>
<s> And I think that the accessibilty guidelines over-emphasize accessibility.  </s>
<s> Longdesc is a link to a document that enables search engines to index your important images.  </s>
<s> TABLE's summary or the association of headers with cells is part of the information of the page.  </s>
<s> If a cell is associated with a header cell it is true for all users, although some users may infer the association from a two dimentional layout if they happen to use a medium that provides such layout.  </s>
<s> The guidelines cannot say that something will not be visible to the page-author, as the guidelines cannot assume that authors use graphical browsers.  </s>
<s> How about "Note that the SRC attribute in IMG is required.  </s>
<s> Although the ALT attribute is presented by default in most media, and probably so in your browser, some browsers for people with special needs (e.g., a need for a better browser) render a broken image icon instead of the ALT text when a SRC attribute is not present".  </s>
<s> It should be noted that some browsers do support longdesc, so it is not "will be available".  </s>

<s> The future is now!  </s>
<s> smile Via Dynamic HTML and Microsoft Active Accessibility, even non-visible tags and attributes get exposed.  </s>
<s> Existing screen readers use this information to adjust their rendering of the information to the user.  </s>
