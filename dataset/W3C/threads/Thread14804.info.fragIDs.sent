<s> 'A guide for people with learning difficulties' is one of them.  </s>
<s> This is shorter, and in a larger font.  </s>
<s> Each leaflet covers a slightly different selection of topics.  </s>
<s> please take the time to have a good look, this could help inform development of suitable text based resources, of this type.  </s>
<s> ( xenophon's expedition of cyrus,  john masters' bhowani junction,  and this a professional tool.)  </s>
