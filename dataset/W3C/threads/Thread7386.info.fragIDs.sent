<s> We are still wrestling with the terminology for this distinction.  </s>
<s> I've had objections in private correspondence to Client-Side / Server-Side, because they seem to imply something about the location of the requester that irrelevant to the distinction we are trying to make.  </s>
<s> I disagree on this point, actually; in the HTTP conversation, the entity issuing the request is the client by definition, regardless of where that entity is running.  </s>
<s> Or stick with Indirect Reference / Direct Reference  </s>
<s> I still prefer these two, myself; I'd go along with Client-Side/Server-Side, but the others seem too contrived.  </s>

<s> The HTTP client issues a request to the server (by definition: the client is the one that issues a request), and then either (a) the server applies that request to the reference's target, or (b) the server tells the client what the target is, and the client reissues the request for the new URI.  </s>
<s> Case (a), the reference is dereferenced on the server side; case (b), it's dereferenced on the client side.  </s>

<s> I think we're agreeing here, its just a problem of perspective.  </s>
<s> In you description below, both the client and server might effectively "read through" the reference depending on the request.  </s>
<s> I'm only trying to suggest that the important issue is if the reference is read through or not, not what role a piece of code is playing in a client/server architecture.  </s>
<s> This is because some implementations of WebDAV may not be client/server.  </s>
