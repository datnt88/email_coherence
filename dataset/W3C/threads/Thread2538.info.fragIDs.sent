Here are the topics for Munich, in the order in which I'd like to visit them. 
Before we allocate times to each topic, I'd like to make sure I didn't leave anything out. 
- Review of draft summary of issues closed &amp; included comments from community conformance summary - open issues (e.g., PUT-RANGE, REAUTHENTICATION-REQUESTED, REDIRECTS, SAFE, CONTENT-ENCODING, RE-VERSION) - content negotiation - PEP - State management - new issues - Network management - NG status report - WG schedule 
Unfortunately, I won't be able to make Munich; I will attempt to summarize my views (where I have any) on the open issues over the next few days, but I'm interested in what you mean to cover under the topic 'Network Management'.

It's the responsibility of groups in the applications area to ensure that systems deployed using the protocols they've 
promoted are managable. 
So I'd like a status report on HTTP server network management, and I put it on the agenda. 
Maybe there's nothing there to say. 
Is there?

If you haven't already done that, it might be good to solicit a status update from the SNMP working group working on HTTP MIBs. 
Sorry for the lack of precision in my group naming. 
And hopefully such a report will be nicely sumarized in the minutes so those of us not there can learn as well.

Like David Morris said, I thought that work was going on elsewhere. 
(though our server does provide SNMP GET on the MIB) ** Reply to note from Larry Masinter masinter@parc.xerox.com
