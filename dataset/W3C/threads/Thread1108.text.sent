Hello. 
I'm using tidy executable, version 1st March 2002 in Debian Woody. 
I'm trying to parse some html text that inputs a user in a TEXTAREA (well, I'm using a WYSIWYG editor, htmlarea). 
I want to filter out those Word tags. 
But the tidy command thinks it has a complete HTML page and adds the header information. 
Lets see an example: Supose that the user writes this in the TEXTAREA: table tr td Firs cell /td td Second cell /tr /table " Then I call tidy from a script with this text (throught the standar input). 
The output is something like this: "HTML Tidy for Linux/x86 (vers 1st March 2002), see www.w3.org" 
And I want only this part: Is that posible? 
Thanks in advance. 
I think show-body-only should do what you want. 
I use it for exactly the same purpose. 
If you put the contents of the textarea inside body /body it should not add the header information (and not return the actual body tags either) show-body-only Type: Boolean Default: no Example: y/n, yes/no, t/f, true/false, 1/0 This option specifies if Tidy should print only the contents of the body tag as an HTML fragment. 
Useful for incorporating existing whole pages as a portion of another page.
