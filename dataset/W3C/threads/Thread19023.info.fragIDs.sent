<s> Hi all, Last year (between March and June), we discussed how the W3C Mailing List archives could be improved, both in terms of accessibility and usability.  </s>
<s> We came up with a proposal described and defined at: Thanks to the great work done by Jose Kahan, the proposed changes have been implemented in Hypermail, the program that formats the email in HTML and have been proposed for integration in the next releases of this program (meaning that the progresses made for us will also be available to a broader users base).  </s>
<s> As promised, we have now a short time frame to make real user testing with the output produced by the new code: what the new hypermail produces, with most of the links working as they would in a production environment (the test was produced on the mails received in January on www-tag).  </s>
<s> Al, Wendy, would it be possible for you to ask people with specific handicaps/navigation requirements to look at these proposals and see how well they work for them?  </s>
<s> Some small (temporary) issues: - the index page has not been generated for this example - the program that produces them is not hypermail, and also can be tweaked much more easily than hypermail, so this might wait for another round - there are some inconsistencies in the navigation bar (ml name, broken links) that would not appear in a real case - the "N.B." note would not appear in a real case either Note that in any case, and since we have had much time and many occasions to discuss the proposals, the corrections that could be brought to the current output cannot be very large, so we should only try to spot out the main remaining issues.  </s>
<s> The comments period is open until June 6 a priori, but let me know if this is too short for you to give your feedback on this.  </s>
<s> [FWIW, I intend to open this review slot to the chairs and the team members after the AC Meeting] Thanks, Dom  </s>

<s> Sort by alternatives change according to which one is selected.  </s>
<s> Better way is to keep all of them visible and in the same order but grey or mark in some other way the one currently selected.  </s>

<s> Hi Dom and Jose, While I have not done a thorough review, I'm very excited about these changes (for everyone!) after just a quick review of the results.  </s>
<s> Well done!  </s>

<s> I'm very excited about these changes  </s>
<s> Just a very small nit with the original post: some of us put attachments in the spam file automatically so if you would post these things to the Web it would be "safer".  </s>
<s> Love.  </s>
<s> It's Bad Luck to be Superstitious!  </s>
<s> Great! Does this include the fix that will allow attached images to show up properly?  </s>
<s> That problem was described at and the fix is mentioned at  </s>

<s> Great improvements!  </s>
<s> The attached page illustrates some suggested tweaks for think will significantly improve the user experience.  </s>
<s> They are: 1.  </s>
<s> The format of the starting and ending dates is hard to visually parse.  </s>
<s> I suggest making the words "Starting" and "Ending" bold (or in dfn tags).  </s>
<s> 2. I find the date format "Apr 01 2003" harder to visually parse than "01-Apr-2003", so instead of 31 messages: Starting Tue, Apr 01 2003, Ending Tue, Apr 01 2003 I suggest 31 messages: Starting: Tue, 01-Apr-2003 Ending: Tue, 01-Apr-2003 However, this may be entirely subjective, and it is very minor, so feel free to ignore this suggestion if you think differently.  </s>
<s> 3. Keep the list of "Sort by" options consistent in all views, and disable the current one.  </s>
<s> For example, when the list is sorted by date, the "[ date ]" option should still appear, but disabled (i.e., no longer a link).  </s>
<s> 4. Provide a quick link to search within the current list.  </s>
<s> I.e., pre-populate the current list name into the search form.  </s>
<s> (The attached example shows an easy way to do this with a link.) I suggest changing the Help line from Help: [ How to use the archives ] [ Search in the archives ] to Help: [ How to use the archives ] Search: [ All ] [ Public lists ] [ This list ] where "Public" would be either "Public", "Member" or "Team", as appropriate.  </s>
<s> Thanks!  </s>

<s> Great stuff.  </s>
<s> I like the idea of offering alternate stylesheets, though the 'short view' one didn't seem to have any effect for me.  </s>
<s> I would especially like to see an alternate stylesheet in messages to make this sort of message readable: (paragraphs are single lines of the incoming mail, and so you have to scroll horizontally to read them).  </s>
<s> I think a smaller font for the h1 would be good, so that it fits on one line.  </s>
<s> Best wishes, Steven  </s>
<s> One more suggestion.  </s>
<s> (I think someone else may have mentioned this problem also, but I'm not sure.) Some messages show up in the archives with very long lines, which are hard to read.  </s>
<s> Example: For message display, it would be helpful to have an easy way to display the message with long lines wrapped.  </s>
<s> This can be done crudely with fed into html2txt, it produces: I would suggest an option, perhaps in the upper right of the message page: Long lines: [ Wrap ] [ Don't wrap ] Furthermore, it would be easiest if "Wrap" were the default, since that is probably the more common need.  </s>
<s> However, if you don't want to wrap by default, then it would be nice to at least provide a "Wrap long lines" link on the message page to easily display a wrapped version.  </s>
<s> Thanks!  </s>
