<s> Hello! Amaya 7.2a states that http://gg57.s7.domainkunden.de/ which has a MIME type of "application/xhtml+xml" is not well-formed.  </s>
<s> The reason for this behaviour is that there's no document type declaration ("DOCTYPE") present in that document.  </s>
<s> I consider this a bug in Amaya.  </s>
<s> The error message is plain wrong, the document *is* well-formed.  </s>
<s> Furthermore, a document type declaration is only mandatory for "strictly conforming" XHTML documents.  </s>
<s> If a document doesn't contain entity references, it can easily be rendered without one.  </s>
<s> Mozilla e.g. renders that page properly.  </s>

<s> Hello Christoph, You are right, there is actually a bug with this document.  </s>
<s> This bug occurs for documents with no doctype declaration AND with a BOM character.  </s>
<s> It is now fixed in the CVS base and will be available in the next release (mid-April).  </s>
<s> Thanks for the report Laurent Carcone  </s>
