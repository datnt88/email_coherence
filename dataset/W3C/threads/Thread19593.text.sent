Both source and i386 binaries at: ftp://rpmfind.net/pub/amaya 
I will hopefully provide a RH-5.2 version today or tomorrow Daniel [Yes, I have moved back to France !] Daniel.Veillard@w3.org | W3C, INRIA Rhone-Alpes | Today's Bookmarks : Tel : +33 476 615 257 | 655, avenue de l'Europe | Linux, WWW, rpmfind, I grabed the rpm for rh60 last night and find that it gets an "unrecoverable thot error" when trying to load a page containing a PNG image. 
Switching the image to a GIF version allows the page to be loaded. 
I am running rh60 with all of the current updates installed. 
Has anyone else found this problem? 
I have had problems with PNG using XV also if that is any help. 
The PNG files are built with gnuplot and GIMP. 
Netscape 4.6 and 4.6.1 have no problems displaying the PNG images. 
I also tried building the program from the sources but have had numerous missing symbol messages when I tried to link the various programs. 
I am fluent in C and will try to track these problems down. 
A first pass look a the problem seems to indicate that macros are preventing the necessary pieces of the source files from being compiled. 
Haven't had the time yet to trace it back to the cause yet. 
Dave Thiede Hum, yes, :-( Same here, except XV ... The difference in the RPM build is that it tries to use the system shared libs instead of the version installed in Amaya source tree. 
The temporary solution seems to be to link with the PNG code coming from the Amaya source tree until the problem is debugged. 
Might be the lack of Motif. 
You need Motif development libraries to build Amaya.

It seems to work well with PNG from various sites, including those from Daniel [Yes, I have moved back to France !] Daniel.Veillard@w3.org | W3C, INRIA Rhone-Alpes | Today's Bookmarks : Tel : +33 476 615 257 | 655, avenue de l'Europe | Linux, WWW, rpmfind,
