"Accessibility Strategy" 
"A user agent that conforms to these guidelines will be tend to be (a) directly accessible through _built-in accessibility features_ and (b) indirectly accessible through _compatibility with other software_ (especially assistive technologies) that can provide other important accessibility features that are beyond the scope of this document." 
Jon Gunderson thinks the following would be clearer: "Accessibility Strategy" "A user agent that conforms to these guidelines will be tend to be directly 
accessible through the input and output devices supported by the user agent and indirectly more accessible through compatibility with other software (especially assistive technologies) that can provide support for other input and output devices that are not directly supported by the user agent.

I prefer a slightly more general formulation since there are other differences than input/output device. 
For example, we talk about table navigation techniques being in the realm of the AT. 
That's just one example.

Ian, The differences in table navigation techniques is the result of the input and output technologies supported. 
That is the primary reason we require support of assistive technologies, is to offer the user other ways to use the user agent. 
I think that we need to be explicit to developers that they are required to make the input and output devices they support accessible to people who can use those input and output devices. 
I think that it is important to state this to comsumers so that they have reasonable expectations on what a conforming user agent can provide them. 
I think it is too ambiguous to say some things will be built-in and some things will be available through AT, with out a clarification of what is built-in and what is not.
