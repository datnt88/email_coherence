Hi, 
I have found a probleme when parsing an HTML page with JTidy that contains the following tags : div align="center" font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" a onMouseOver="canceltime();act('r3');" onMouseOut="inactall();" a href="https://www.bdlinvest.com/prod/login.nsf/log?openform&amp;login=1" 
target="body"  Market Watch /a /font /div the error is : line 149 column 80 - Error: a missing ' ' for end of tag This document has errors that must be fixed before using HTML Tidy to generate a tidied up version. 
The problem is caused by the A tag with no href. 
I have no way to change the HTML. 
Is there any solution by configuration or is it a bug ? 
THanks for help.

Bonjour Denis, looking at your HTML code, dropping all the Attributes, I see the following: That Tidy cannot provide a satisfying solution for this kind of Error is kind of evident - how shall it reasonably guess whether the first or the second " A" is supposed to be the "right" one? 
Despite your claim that you can't change the HTML, this is exactly what you'll have to do. 
Either you remove the second " A" or you add a " " to the first " A". 
Then you can let Tidy do the rest. 
I hope this helped pointing out the problem... Je pourrais essayer d'expliquer le probleme en francais, si necessaire.

I'm actually familiar with this problem. 
When I worked with Digital H2O, I found at times I had to find a way to get NetObjects Fusion to allow me to put handlers inside A tags, but the version the company had didn't allow that. 
I could put them before the tag, inside the image inside the tag, or after the closing tag, but not inside the anchor. 
The only solution I had found was to tell it to create a construct like the above, starting but not finishing the opening tag so that the tag would eat the " a" of the tool-generated tag. 
In his saying he has no way to change the HTML I believe he means that this is being produced by an authoring tool such as NetObjects Fusion through a process like I described: a lack of fine control over where user-generated markup is inserted. 
While that may be only one example, he may have several instances of this hack throughout his pages. 
How about a test to sees if the tag missing the " " is the same tag as mentioned after the " " that triggered the error and, if the match, combine the tags. 
The browser in the example is going to ignore the " a" and treat them as concatenated with an ignored unknown attribute anyway. 
As to NetObjects Fusion, I do not recall if a newer version is more flexible in the location of inserted markup, but I do know one revision comes with the additional baggage of unwanted ID attributes on everything that change each time you rebuild the site.

Worst thing I've ever seen; kid had no face." 
I have to give some lights about the context of my work. 
The parser is used in the goal of extracting data from HTML pages in order to redisplay it in another form (with the permission of the web site author of course). 
So I'd like the parser to be as universal as possible. 
I don't want to tell the webmaster to modified here and here its site. 
So the probleme is to finish a start tag when a  comes: becomes: A a kugkg /a /A or A /A a kugkg /a or a att1 att2 kugkg /a (ignoring first A, but not its attributes) I have also the problem with: In this case the IMG must be closed, the error disappear when I use setMakeClean(false). 
Is there a place in the source code I can take a look ? 
about: 
I not sure : the browser is Netscape for example ?
