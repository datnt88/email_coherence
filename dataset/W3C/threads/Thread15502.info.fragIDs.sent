<s> As I read the document, I am generating a lot of comments that are not accessibility-related.  </s>
<s> Some of these are editorial and expository.  </s>
<s> Those I feel comfortable just sending to the editors.  </s>
<s> But I'm not sure I know what to do with the substantive ones.  </s>
<s> What guidelines should we follow concerning comments to send to just w3c-css-wg mailing list just w3c-wai-hc mailing list both places at once  </s>

<s> The new CSS2 draft is now avalilable, here:  </s>
<s> with links to a multi-file HTML version and a PDF version.  </s>
<s> The PDF is missing a couple of diagrams compared to the HTML (tool problem).  </s>
<s> Most comments have been addressed in this version.  </s>
<s> It still doesn't have the 139 color names added, though.  </s>
<s> And tty media type is not added in this version.  </s>

<s> OK, Thanks Chris.  </s>
<s> I think one possible course of actions is as follow: - we review this document for one week, in particular in light of our previous comments in - we try to summarize our conclusion by the end of next week and send that to IG, for information really (can't ask for review for the meeting, too short) - we have an HC meeting Monday Nov 10 in Austin (afternoon) to discuss our comments for the CSS2 meeting on the 13. - we can also present that to the general WAI assembly the 11 afternoon (but can't count as IG approval) - an HC delegation goes to the CSS2 meeting on Thursday 13 to discuss our comments.  </s>
<s> I'm trying to avoid the word "review" or "report" for our input to the CSS2 meeting since whatever we do in that timeframe will not have the IG stamp of approval on it.  </s>
<s> I think we will have time after the Austin meeting to - finalize our HC report of CSS2 - run it thru IG - submit it to CSS2 officially (before they go Proposed Recommendation by December).  </s>
<s> If Chris agrees I think the comments that are not accessibility related should go only to css wg.  </s>
<s> The others should go to both.  </s>
<s> That seems fine with me.  </s>

<s> OK Thanks Chris.  </s>
<s> I realized after writing that reply that CSS is so important for the success of Web accessibily that any comment that is trying to improve the CSS spec may be labelled as accessibility related :-)  </s>
<s> But let's stick to that model.  </s>
<s> People on the WAI HC that wants to access the w3c-css-wg archives can do so at lists.w3.org.  </s>
<s> to follow up on what Daniel Dardailler said:  </s>
<s> I think that the basis of this importance is a point worth developing in more detail.  </s>
<s> I could use some help understanding your vision of the universal-technology web and how CSS delivers  </s>
<s> it (understanding better).  </s>
<s> I suspect that we want to pursue two strategies in parallel.  </s>
<s> One is to provide coverage for basic operability needs without relying on stylsheets.  </s>
<s> That should be covered in the markup guidelines and browser guidelines.  </s>
<s> The second is to provide alternate-media content that is styled as artfully as the dominant screen medium.  </s>
<s> To do this we can exploit CSS to the fullest, and want to make sure the fullest supports the alternate media this well.  </s>
<s> That's the piece we are dealing with here.  </s>
<s> I will try to be liberal in finding accessibility connections as an excuse to cross-post, or post 'announce' mentions of issues that went straight to CSS WG. -- Al  </s>
<s> My personal view is that making HTML4 and CSS2 successfull for the delivery of flashy or otherwise graphical content is paramount, and much more important than making CSS successfull in conveying audio or braille output.  </s>
<s> This is really about giving back to HTML its simplest form of just a content+structure vehicle (and putting all the presentation glitter in SS).  </s>
<s> Things like ACSS and BrailleCSS are good, but I see them more being used a pure client-side features, and therefore, being implementable by any client at any time (using whatever means they like, maybe not SS at all, like pwWebSpeak of today for instance).  </s>
<s> to follow up on what Daniel Dardailler said:  </s>
<s> I don't want to try to stop you or the WAI from helping CSS succeed.  </s>
<s> I am concerned that the WAI not feel it _must_ ensure the success of the segregation approach represented by CSS.  </s>
<s> This may be a major objective of the W3C but I see a limited coupling with the accessibility interest and project.  </s>
<s> - The WAI expertise is not the strongest resource to make CSS a winning glitter vehicle - Getting the glitter out and getting the content in are largely separable concerns, and what concerns the WAI is getting the content in.  </s>
<s> My illustrative example for the second idea is italics and Braille.  </s>
<s> In order to do italics right in Braille, you need to know the reason for the italics.  </s>
<s> If all we have in the HTML is EM, Braille loses, just the same as if all we have is I. If the reasons for the italics are given by using informative markup such as DFN, Braille wins.  </s>
<s> The critical difference is "Does the authoring process get the basis for the italics from the author?"  </s>
<s> The encoding difference beween using - The element is DFN and the style applies italics - the element is I CLASS="DFN" and no style is used is not a grave matter of concern to the Braille formatter than can win either way.  </s>
<s> I agree.  </s>
