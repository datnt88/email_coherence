WAI EOWG: This message cancels our Friday May 21 meeting. 
We did not have one scheduled for the following Friday, 28. 
Our next meeting will therefore be on Friday June 4. 
The additional time between now and our following meeting will allow some time to review EOWG planning; publishing materials which have been essentially completed but are not sufficiently prominent on the site; minutes; requests to join; etc. 
In the meantime, there may be some materials circulated on the list for comment, so please comment on those if they come around. 
Thank you, Judy Judy Brewer jbrewer@w3.org +1.617.258.9741 http://www.w3.org/WAI Director, Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) International Program Office World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) MIT/LCS Room NE43-355, 545 Technology Square, Cambridge, MA, 02139, USA 
Good day! 
Here is a copy of the DRAFT paper I presented at WWW8 on Friday. 
I have some edit work to do and will also add two more issues. 
Appreciate any comments you can provide soonest. 
Judy and Cynthia: Could you pls pay close attention to the Issues and recommendations. 
Many thanks, rob 
uh-oh, this document is in severe need of a scissors and tape for editing, which i have just started. 
So my questions is are, the issues covered well - inspite of the need for an edit. 
Are there more issues?
