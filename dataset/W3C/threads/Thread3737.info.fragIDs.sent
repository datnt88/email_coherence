Here is a first draft (basically, the announcement is a re-write of the beta announcement, and the relnotes come from the "what's new" page on :8001 ) Comments much welcome, but rapidly, we're going to move forward real soon (I'm talking hours here...). 
---- CUT HERE ---- - New generation of the "Markup Validator" released - After a little more than a year of development, and a month of beta test, we're proud to announce today the release of the new version of the Markup Validator, along with an update of the eponymous online service at : This new version include, among many changes, improved and more accessible interfaces, support for more document types, better internationalization support, and much more...

Be sure to read the documentation on "How to provide feedback": ** R E L E A S E N O T E S ** Changes for this version include: - Improved design of layout, including for Validation results. 
Output has also been reworked to be easier to understand. 
- New feature : Tip-of-the-Day. 
- Many accessibility fixes, both to the web site and the Result page. 
- Major internal restructuring. 
The code has undergone significant refactoring with many benefits. 
It is more readable and easier to understand, much more robust, much improved security, more modular, and performance should be significantly better. 
There is tentative support for running under mod_perl (leading to even greater performance enhancements) and memory consumption should be much improved. 
- Many new document types are supported and support for some existing document types has been improved. 
Notable changes and additions include: * Support for MathML is back in good shape. 
* Support for application/xhtml+xml. 
* Support for XHTML+MathML and XHTML+MathML+SVG. 
* Support for SVG and image/svg+xml. 
* Support for XHTML 1.0 Second Edition and XHTML 1.1.

Don't even /think/ about it Olivier!

Oops. 
If you believe that will stop spammers, you're sadly misled. 
Rusty hooks, rectally administered fuel oil enemas, and the gutting of their machines, *that* stops spammers!

Perhaps that should be strong class="distinguished" Terje Bless /strong 
I wonder if we shouldn't just add Bjoern and Peter to that list? 
Bjoern at least has ISTM contributed quite a lot? 
Nick Kew 
Uhm, yeah, the idea was rather to single those two out among the "non-core" contributors as having made extraordinary contributions. 
But you're right; it's confusing. 
Let's just lump everyone together in the one list. 
I'm [less] than thrilled by the [VM situation]; all sides of it. 
I [think] we need a [fork] in that area so that you guys would stop stepping on each others' toes. 
I'm taking no part in your merry 5-way clusterfuck -- sort that mess out between yourselves.
