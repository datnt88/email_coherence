Hi there! 
I'm not sure who to send this to, so if your are not the right person, could you forward this along. 
Thanks. 
I was checking-out W3's web page. 
I decided to give Amaya a try. 
BUG IN WINDOWS 95 1.4A VERSION OF AMAYA - INSTALLER The Windows 95 distribution of Amaya: 1.4a binary release amay-Windows95-1.4a.exe 
In the install, the default install directory is: C:\Program Files It should be this instead: C:\Program Files\Amaya WEB PAGE FOR AMAYA - INCLUDE BUG REPORT INFO How does one send it bug reports? 
Is there an e-mail address available. 
It would make sense to me to put this info on: If you could forward these along to the relevant parties, it would be much appreciated. 
Thanks.

Hi, Not true. 
Amaya installer shows you the directory in which the directory root of the Amaya tree will be installed and you are free to modify it. 
The root directory in Amaya in Thot. 
if, for instance, you shose C:\Programs Files, Amaya will be intalled in C:\Program Files\Thot. 
This is not typical to Amaya, but always the case for any program. 
Here you are in right place. 
Please send your bug reports to www-amaya@w3.org 
655 Avenue de l'Europe | e-mail: Ramzi.Guetari@w3.org 
38330 Montbonnot Saint Martin - France | http://www.w3.org No, this C:\Program Files is ok. 
You will find it creates one subdirectory and everything goes to that subdir. 
On the other hand, it is remarkable that the dir is named 'thod' with amaya being a subdirectory thereof. 
This is due to the fact that Amaya is based on Thod. 
If this Thod is expected to be used for other applications as well, the Amaya installation should install the Amaya specific stuff in an own directory (C:\Program Files\Amaya by default) and store Thod in it's own directory (C:\Program Files\Thod by default). 
In this case, Amaya distributions should come without thot distributions too. 
There is no need to update to the same Thod version if there is a new Amaya version. 
If this Thod is to be used by Amaya only, the install tree should be reversed: Amaya containting a Thod subdirectory.

Hi, You're right. 
The next 2.0 release will change that. 
The root Amaya sub-tree will be named Amaya.
