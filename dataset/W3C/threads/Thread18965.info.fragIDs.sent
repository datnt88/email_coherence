<s> can you write and attach RDF with a CSS file?  </s>
<s> You could, but it would be extremely complex.  </s>
<s> Although the BNF productions for CSS are grouped pretty much according to the semantics of each of the parts, you'd have to invent a CSSPath for that to be useful.  </s>
<s> Chaals's ideas of adding a new property ("background-longdesc"?  </s>
<s> I don't think you want people to be using chunks of HTML in CSS) to CSS and deploying decent image formats (PNG, SVG, etc.) seems to me to be on the mark.  </s>
<s> Oops.  </s>
<s> I suspect that Sean may be interpreting Lisa more literally than Lisa intended, in terms of "attach RDF with a CSS file."  </s>
<s> I believe that the leading-candidate method of applying the RDF which associates a description of the background is not by reference via CSS path into the CSS at all but by the URI of the first-class web object that the CSS processor binds as background to some base-language element.  </s>
<s> The association of a base-language element instance with the background image-resource is implied by the style algorithms and the sheaf of pertinent style sheets.  </s>
<s> The action of the style processor may be reduced to rule form as a binding of - the property-value pair (background, someImage) to - a match-pattern generated by selectors in style rules and the action of the cascade to isolate a surviving style rule per base language element instance  </s>
<s> As for "associate td.header with a standard h2", I'm not 100% sure what you mean, but I think you're in the realm of CSS pre-processing.  </s>
<s> Pre-processing, but not necessarily CSS pre-processing.  </s>
<s> Perhaps XSLT pre-processing.  </s>
<s> One application is to generate a new  </s>
<s> base-language syntax tree for an NN4-compatible view of the page.  </s>
<s> I don't believe that CSS will do that for you.  </s>
<s> This leaves the matter of how to frame some RDF that makes assertions about what rhetorical role this element is playing that makes the binding to this background image appropriate.  </s>
<s> I am unclear how far up the generic/specific or is_a ancestry of the element instance one can climb with RDF assertions.  </s>
<s> It would be nice to be able to bind sense-clarifications to match-patterns and not only to instances.  </s>
<s> But that may be a 'nice' that fails to make the grade in terms of lowest level language, c.f. our experience where only 'headers' is implemented among the cell/header association tools in HTML 4. Accessible TABLEs from W3C/WAI (FedStats pitch) Al  </s>

<s> Yep; I was thinking about applying the RDF solution more broadly, i.e. by extending it to annotate other bits of style (why I chose this background color: what it means, where I derived the style from, what date I updated this particular rule, why this bit doesn't work in a particular browser, etc.).  </s>
<s> In doing so, and because I'm a metahead and forgot to KIS (S!), I forgot about just talking about a particular image being used as a background.  </s>
<s> I guess that the "background-longdesc" property could easily point off to some XML/RDF as much as it could point to some further HTML.  </s>
<s> You'd have to run the majority of pages through Tidy before you could do anything with XSLT, of course.  </s>

<s> I will try to rexplain what I was thinking.  </s>
<s> My problem was that presention , for the most part, has content.  </s>
<s> The content may be "this is emphasised" or "you can trust this", or who knows what, but it is content.  </s>
<s> That content is lost with overriding user style sheets.  </s>
<s> A strong example of this is background grafics which may even have text in.  </s>
<s> Now, one way to deal with this would be to add discripitve atributes to all CSS elements, and emphasis levels and similar fun stuff.  </s>
<s> In other words a way to extract the content from the presentation.  </s>
<s> If we could do it in RDF that would be cooler.  </s>
<s> We leave CSS alone and say: this class, from this CSS file, has an emphasis level of "extremely irrelevant".  </s>
<s> This class, from this CSS file, has an association of "trustworthy" This class, from this CSS file, has an association of "urgent/dangerous" Now visually "urgent" may be rendered in red.  </s>
<s> but in a black and white rendering it may have a box around it, in aural it may be louder.  </s>
<s> - up to the user.  </s>
<s> Alternatively, when linking a document to a CSS file we could also link it to the RDF that explains or gives meaning to the CSS classes as used and quoted by the document.  </s>
<s> ok hear is the one that was confusing : This class (td.header for example), from this CSS file, is similar in our data model to a "H1 from XHTML" In other words, give Peaple an elegant way out of their misuse of XHTML and phudo classes I am not an "RDF person" (although you probably could describe me in lots of conflicting RDF definitions) But I am guessing that may be an elegant solution to a voice but none the less real problem.  </s>
