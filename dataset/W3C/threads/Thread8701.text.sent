Hello, I have some questions/comments for the current draft. 
(1) For KeyInfo Element A combination of Issuer Name and Certificate Serial Number is used as the identifier for the actual public key to verify the signature in PKCS#7. 
Additionally, a combination of issuer name, subject name and subject key identifier is also used (this is described in draft-ietf-pkix-technr-00.txt.) How does validation application identify "the" key information which has been used for signature, although KeyInfo can include many key (certificate) information? 
(2-1) For X509Data I think the X509IssuerName in the example of X509Data should be described actual value such that distinguished name, for example X509IssuerName CN =XXX Cert, C= US, O = XXX Trust Inc. /X509IssuerName . 
# Is there any general guideline which describes about text representation # of distinguished name? 
I found draft-ietf-pkix-generalname-00.txt # which specifies text representations for distinguished names # but this document has already expired. 
(2-2) The structure of X509Data element I think that the combination of X509IssuerSerial,X509SKI and/or X509SubjectName should be used as the identifier for the certificate if it has been already stored in the verifier's local storage. 
Additionally, X509CRL may be separated or may be included with certificate (or certificate identifiers) in X509Data if multiple certificates is allowed by using multiple X509Data because X509CRL is independent. 
Therefore I suggest the following structure of X509Data: element ref='ds:X509IssuerSerial' minOccurs='0' maxOccurs='1'/ element name='X509SKI' type='CryptoBinary'/ minOccurs='0' maxOccurs='1'/ element name='X509SubjectName' type='string'/ minOccurs='0' maxOccurs='1'/ element name='X509Certificate' type='ds:CryptoBinary' minOccurs='1' maxOccurs='1'/ element name='X509CRL' type='ds:CryptoBinary' minOccurs='1' maxOccurs='1'/ Thanks, Yoshiaki Kawatsura : E-mail kawatura@bisd.hitachi.co.jp Business Solution Systems Development Division, Hitachi,Ltd. 
Hi Yoshiaki! 
A previous version of the XML-Signature draft mentioned RFC 2253 as the way to represent a Name as a text string, I think this is still intended by the authors (Joseph, Brian: Am I right here?) Regards, Gregor Gregor Karlinger Phone +43 316 873 5541 Institute for Applied Information Processing and Communications Austria The generalname draft is for displaying the variants of GeneralName, which are usually found in the alternate name certificate extensions. 
It assumes that a DN (and issuer names are DN's) are displayed essentially in LDAP (RFC 1485/1779/2253) format, with a fixed prefix of "directory:". 
It also specifies formats for several other GeneralName variants.
