<s> An associate of mine reviewed the evaluation that Charles sent and in general agree with the comments and assessment.  </s>
<s> Many of the items were known (can't specify table headers, no accessibility checking, some database templates shipped with Domino are not accessible) and some she had not paid attention to ("optional" label on the alternate text for applets, generating standard markup).  </s>
<s> There were some items that she didn't think applied to Designer (providing text equivalents for sounds, stand-alone audio files, audio tracks of video).  </s>
<s> It also mentioned the Domino Import Service which she has not seen or used.  </s>
