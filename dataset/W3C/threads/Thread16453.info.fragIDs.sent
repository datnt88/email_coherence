<s> I think the issue of bandwidth needs to be mitigated by the amount of data being downloaded.  </s>
<s> When I used a Palm and its 14.4 modem, my MSN home page loaded faster on the 14.4 modem than on my 56k (40k really) modem at home.  </s>
<s> The reason?  </s>
<s> I skipped all the images.  </s>
<s> The same holds true for Internet WCAG 1.0 spec faster on my cell than on my 56k at home, again because the images are gone.  </s>
<s> Maybe it's reasonable to assume there is no issue with 'text only' sites, since you can't scale that back much further than just straight text embellished with CSS.  </s>
<s> Getting any granular with sites that use only text would get into discussions of how big, in kilobytes, a page should be.  </s>
<s> Still ...  </s>
<s> I'm less than 1/2 a block away from my phone company's switching station and sites are so slow on my dial up I'm getting DSL at home (next week!).  </s>
<s> So with most sites I frequent, bandwidth isn't so much the issue as is all the images that go with the content.  </s>
<s> Interesting implications for the discussion on images and text thread the last few days ... Joel The average user still connects with a modem from home - either a 33.6 or 56k, and 56k modems really give you about 40k.  </s>
<s> That's still slow.  </s>
<s> Cable and DSL are rolling out very, very slowly.  </s>
<s> From work, the average user generally has a faster connection.  </s>
<s> However, a T1 line shared among dozens, perhaps hundreds of co-workers, can also become rather sluggish.  </s>
<s> Some offices provide truly fast connections, but for many it's not much better, and sometimes even worse, than a modem connection.  </s>
<s> Or for students using their school's T3, there are frequent complaints of pitiful performance due in large part to trading mp3s (although this may improve with Napster going down the tubes).  </s>
<s> And, of course, massively increased web use has led to many bottlenecks.  </s>
<s> Even if there are fast connections at both ends, traffic often bogs down somewhere in the middle.  </s>
<s> As a very satisfied user of a home DSL connection, I still frequently run into sites that are much slower than they should be, for that reason.  </s>
<s> So yes, bandwidth is still an issue.  </s>
<s> Not quite as much of an issue as when 14.4 and 19.2 modems were the norm - maximum file size can, perhaps, be bumped up a bit - but it's still a significant concern.  </s>
