<s> Hello Choi, Many thanks for your translation!  </s>
<s> It took some work, but I found the spec at: Please do not use URIs that have characters encoded according to local conventions.  </s>
<s> This will not work across the Web, nor with XML or XLink.  </s>
<s> To identify the character encoding of the document, please do not use "ks_c_5601-1987".  </s>
<s> According to this refers to Nr. 149 in the ISO registry, i.e. only the two-byte part of "iso-2022-kr" or "euc-kr", but not the one-byte characters contained in your document.  </s>
<s> Therefore, the document also doesn't validate: %25ba%25c6%25e51%7E7%25c0%25e5.htm  </s>
<s> Please use either "iso-2022-kr" or "euc-kr", as appropriate.  </s>
<s> Also, if you can work a bit on the style of the document (ideally, keep the original style), I guess it would be easier to read.  </s>
<s> Thierry - Can you add the translation to the SMIL translation page?  </s>
<s> Regards, Martin.  </s>
<s> There was some mistake.  </s>
<s> Please check the address above.  </s>
<s> Becuase the name of htm file was written in korean, you cannot read it on your computer.  </s>
<s> Please copy and paste that file name on your web browser and check it.  </s>
<s> Thank you.  </s>
<s> your regards  </s>
<s> Martin, Should I link tothis URI that have characters encoded ?  </s>
<s> This translation is based on the SMIL 2.0 spec dated ww.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-smil20-20000921/ Which is not the current WD now available at  </s>
<s> I think we should translate only REC documents as WD are not stable.  </s>
<s> On the SMIL translation page available at We already link to a Korean translation of (SMIL) 1.0 Recommendation  </s>

<s> Martin is it possible to add in the encourage people to translate only specifications at the REC level.  </s>
<s> A spec is subject to change, and there is strong opportunity to have information that is not right in the nature.  </s>
<s> Karl Dubost / W3C - Conformance Manager --- Be Strict To Be Cool! ---  </s>
<s> Hello Karl, Thierry, We can certainly encourage people to update their translations to REC, and to make it clear that something is not a REC (which they will do automatically if they correctly translate the 'Status of this Document'.  </s>
<s> Forbidding to translate WDs,... was discussed earlier, but rejected.  </s>
<s> Translating something at an early stage allows people to get more familiar with what we do early, to comment,...  </s>
<s> As for publishing something that is not right, we do that all the time.  </s>
<s> While we can ask translators to upgrade in place, to remove old versions, to add additional warnings,... if there is a new version, and so on, WE OURSELVES never add any warning for an old WD, nor do we remove it.  </s>
<s> Regards, Martin.  </s>
<s> I understand your point Martin.  </s>
<s> I agree but we serve always the latest version by default.  </s>
<s> Maybe we can add a comment in the example In the CASE of a WD, We can have a RED comment, large size font... "This is a working DRAFT subject to change" Karl Dubost / W3C - Conformance Manager --- Be Strict To Be Cool! ---  </s>
