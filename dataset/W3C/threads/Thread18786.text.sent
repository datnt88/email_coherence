A little data I just learned: In Netscape, setting "autoload images" off does not guarantee the delivery of the ALT text to the screen. 
It merely suppresses net-gets of the image file. 
If the image file is already in local cache, the image is displayed and the ALT text is nowhere on the screen. 
[Flushing the cache is more bother than a user should have to put up with, and on a workgroup server the individual user does not have a dedicated cache to flush once and forget.] 
This leads Netscape+Screen_Reader users to ask for links in the body of the text which are redundant to buttons where the link content is an image. 
Whereas Lynx users want link count minimized and meaningful ALT text making the image-link usable as read via the ALT text. 
No wonder WebMasters have trouble understanding what people are screaming at them. 
This problem could be fixed by guideline, i.e. if Netscape followed a "user control of styling" policy like what I included in my ACSS action item response, the image link with link-descriptive ALT text would serve all blind users alike. 
Still, reflecting on our earlier conversation, I would say that the use of ALT text in GUI browsers for sighted users favors putting a description of the image in the ALT text, whereas the user of ALT text in Lynx and pwWebSpeak favors putting a description of the link target in the ALT text. 
This means that the present definition and use of ALT fails to isolate one semantic item consistently across browse modes. 
Note that both semantic senses are worth supporting. 
We should strive to refine the format and usage so that each gets a distinguished representation within the HTML. 
[One of these could indeed possibly be TITLE.] ALT represents an example of an opportunity to clean up the accessibility of the Web by improving on the definition of the Web media. 
We may think that the problem is that the authors are populating the standards wrong, but it is the standards that we have the greatest leverage over. 
We should not neglect a chance to make the situation better by what we can change; relying on what others have to do for us should be used sparingly. 
Al Gilman I was reviewing the new Netscape Communicator 4.0 and found that is has trouble with alt text on many pages. 
It seems that the ALT TEXT appears sometimes and not others depending on whether the WIDTH tag is used and how large it is. 
Here is as much information as I have. 
This is preliminary right now. 
I just downloaded the new browser before I left town so I don't have full testing yet. 
FIRST - All of the behavior reported is for the Win95 version of the program. 
I have not checked any other versions. 
ALT TEXT APPEARING OR NOT IN A DOCUMENT 1) Alt text DOES appear if you either a) don't have any Height and Width set for an image or b) the Height and Width are large enough to include the ENTIRE alt text. 
2) If you DO set the Height and Width and the Width you set is not big enough to hold the ENTIRE alt text, then NONE of the alt text is displayed. 
3) The alt text DOES NOT WRAP so that you must have enough room for the ENTIRE length of the alt text to appear in the WIDTH setting. 
(You must also have the HEIGHT setting large enough for the height of the text... but not usually a problem except for graphic lines) 4) There are also circumstances where all the alt text disappears from the Edit View but if I close the view and reopen it the alt text returns so that doesn't seem to be a real problem.. just a bug. 
Note: In all these circumstances, the alt text still appears as a tooltip which pops up when you point to a graphic. 
Example #2 is the most important issue though 2, 3, and 4 are all problems MOVING OF THE ALT TEXT TO A LOWER LEVEL IN THE IMAGE PROPERTIES The place that calls for ALT TEXT for a graphic used to be at the highest level of the image properties dialog box, right next to the path. 
It has now been moved to a button at the bottom of the properties dialog box that is labeled "Alt Text / Low Res..." It therefore takes more time to use and is less obvious that it should be filled out. 
(At first I couldn't find it because I was looking for it in the dialog itself and then I went looking for it under the tabs at the top.) It would be MUCH better if it was on the top level so that it was convenient and looked like an important part of the image specification rather than an optional specification. 
It would be EVEN BETTER if it prompted for the alt text... though it should not require it I don't think (there may be places where it is not appropriate and situations where someone else will do the alt text). 
There are already prompts for other things like image files that aren't found at the specified location and they are easy to dismiss. 
For convenience I have attached a page I tossed together quickly to explore the problem briefly. 
I have pasted this memo into the bottom to make it easier to read and look at. 
Different conditions are shown for information While on the topic of ALT TEXT here are two other notes regarding alt text. 
1) UNDERLINE ALT TEXT IF IT IS A LINK If the alt text is on an image that is a link the alt text SHOULD BE UNDERLINED If the alt text is on an image that is NOT a link - is should appear as it does now. 
(not underlined) 2) WHEN YOU TURN OFF IMAGES THEY SHOULD NOT APPEAR EVEN IF THEY ARE IN THE CACHE. 
The Alt text should appear instead. 
This makes it much easier for webmasters and others to check their web pages to see if and how well the ALT TEXT appears. 
I have passed these notes on to Netscape. 
I am posting this to the group for several reasons. 
1) They are loopholes or potholes that we should document in any browser guidelines so they don't get repeated. 
2) They show how dependent web page designers are on the idiosyncrasies of web browsers. 
(You can design what you think is an accessible page with alt text and then have it not appear in some browsers). 
3) It highlights the difficulty we will have in writing guidelines that will make web pages accessible today (versus having pages designed to a spec that browsers will meet in the near (hopefully very near) future.) For example the guideline looks like it would read Use ALT TEXT with all graphics and do NOT use either the height or width command unless you are certain that the the width of the text (in whatever font size the user has as his default) in the ALT TEXT message is less than the width you have set for you image and the text height is less than the height set for the image." 
"Do not make ALT TEXT (in the user set font size) longer than the width from the left edge of the graphic to the right edge of the page (on a 640 x480 screen) (or the right edge of the graphic if it has a WIDTH command) CONCLUSION We need to define some common browser behaviors if we are to have a simple and comprehensible set of guidelines for web designers to use. 
Both of the above recommendations would reduce to "Use alt text with all graphics" if 1) the graphic would expand to fit the ALT TEXT 2) the ALT TEXT would word wrap if needed 3) there was a setting (a user setting) that would prevent a graphic from appearing alongside a paragraph (so that the alt text for the image did not appear in the midst of the paragraph text when read by a screen reader) (particularly a problem if the ALT TEXT is word wrapped. 
) This last one needs some thinking but you get the drift of the idea. 
This last one may also not be necessary if we have intelligent talking browsers or screen readers that can detect side by side text and not inter-read them. 
The first one though is necessary though for the ALT TEXT to appear at all for a screen reader (though a talking or text browser would have the alt text avail in any case.) Just some thoughts. 
Got to run.

Well said, and thanks for the report. 
I've always thought ALT was under-specified in the HTML spec, which only says something like: "For user agents that cannot display images, this attribute specifies alternate text." 
The "cannot" in the above sentence can be loaded with semantics.. 
I'm not sure I agree that playing with the cache is too much asking for a Screen-Reader user encountering this Netscape problem but I agree that the Browser guidelines should make clear what we want (to palliate the HTML specs vagueness). 
I expect the LongDesc action item to cover part or all of that topic (semantics of ALT/TITLE/DLINK). 
I'll take a look at the Unix version but I don't expect miracle here. 
I remembered discussing ALT relationg to WIDTH/HEIGHT a while ago, so it must not be new, is it ? 
You're talking about some authoring image tool here ? 
(or is it a new dialog in 4.0 ?) On a related topic, the Amaya team (W3C own HTML authoring tool) has recently asked me if defaulting the IMG ALT to the image name (filename or image name if available in the format) was a good idea. 
Somehow your page is full of encoded character replaced by "3D". 
Could you point at it directly on the web at Trace ? 
Yes, Al's message is about that. 
Use ALT TEXT with all graphics and do NOT use either the height or width Gosh, I really wish we can avoid that level of hackery. 
Linking the size of the graphics to the size of the alt text is such a bad design principle... Thousand of generations of web-surfer will hate us for that decision :-) The core question is to know how important Netscape rendering compliance is to users of ALT text, and we need to weight in users of ALT text using pwWebspeak of Lynx or whatever that smarter than Navigator, that shouldn't pay the price of short-to-useless ALT text that fit into a graphics. 
From this study steams the recommendation for authors to constrain - or not - their design of ALT text to Netscape peculiarities.

Issue is not new. 
But usually at least part of the alt text would show. 
In IE it word wraps to fit in the image box. 
You're talking about some authoring image tool here ? 
(or is it a new dialog in 4.0 ?) Netscape Nav Gold and the new Communicator both had authoring (WISIWYG) tools built in. 
in Gold the alt text entry field was at the top level of the dialog right along side the "path to the image file" field. 
In the new communicator you need to call up a separate sub-dialog box in order to enter the alt text. 
There at On a related topic, the Amaya team (W3C own HTML authoring tool) has recently asked me if defaulting the IMG ALT to the image name (filename or image name if available in the format) was a good idea. 
Not generally usable. 
I would not do that in an authoring tool. 
In a browser it might not be a bad idea if you showed the filename and one root level higher in the path (which is often where the name of the picture is as in gore/large.gif ) if the web page does not have any alt text. 
But I would NOT have an author tool do this.

????? interesting. 
I'll post it on site at width whatever than the Gosh, I really wish we can avoid that level of hackery. 
Precisely my point. 
[this was an example of what the guideline would have to look like -- showing that it is non-sensical] What I was trying to say is that unless we get some fixes into the browsers - the advice we must give to web designers is so convoluted as to be unusable. 
If you look at the example carefully you will see that it requires the page designer to know in advance what the font setting of the users browser is. 
This is clearly impossible. 
Hackery. 
I find the MSIE use of a pop-up containing ALT text available to replace a graphic hole a reasonable solution for a single anchor buried in the graphic. 
For the sighted, a different one for each buried one in a graphic has some appeal. 
For a pure-text user choice or user agent, all such should appear, of whatever size needed (or if there isn't room, then arbitrarily use wrapping/truncating rules). 
Venting the graphic space for buttons should be a user option, if that space could more effectively be used for the ALT text. 
If link target naming were terse and suggestive, that would be ok. 
Often it is neither. 
I would like to have ALT be #REQUIRED. 
I prefer that its content be descriptive. 
I would also support the second semantic sense of link target. 
Since the HREF="..." material is needed, why cannot the Lynx/pwWebSpeak use that value? 
I believe for any user agent, both have value. 
The sighted user agent may have access to the URL. 
I'd encourage the other browsers to make both available, and distinguished. 
Regards/Harvey Bingham I am struggling to bring the quality of the Cougar spec upto the expected level, and would welcome any suggestions for what we should include in the description of IMG, OBJECT and APPLET.. For IMG we have the ALT attribute, but could propose a further attribute for a link to further information about the image, e.g. ALTSRC. 
This has the effect of avoiding problems with down level browsers. 
We can readily extend Lynx and the emacs based browsers to support this new feature. 
For OBJECT, we can advise authors how to use the content of the OBJECT element to provide textual descriptions of images. 
Note that OBJECT supports use of the A element to define image maps. 
The anchor is extended with the SHAPE and COORDS attributes so that the textual description along with hypertext links also serves to define the hotzones on the image. 
For APPLET the course is less clear to me. 
The content of the APPLET allows you to include a textual description. 
There are also the guidelines for authoring Java in a way that minimizes accessibility problems. 
Any help would be much appreciated. 
We plan to publish the 1st draft of the Cougar spec in a few days time, so any input now could be folded into that draft. 
Otherwise, there will be time for further input before the spec reaches the proposed recommendation status. 
Regards, -- Dave Raggett dsr@w3.org 
http://www.w3.org/People/Raggett World Wide Web Consortium (on assignment from HP Labs) I'd like to hear from the authoring tool community on the likehood that it'll be accepted by their users. 
I'm a little bit confused by your answer here. 
HREF is a URL, and although useful, it's not really meant to be presented to the user. 
TITLE is more appropriate to describe the link target in natural language. 
Adding an URL attribute to IMG is a way to handle the long description issue. 
We're still waiting for the requirement report on that item to see what's needed. 
One of the requirement brought up at the meeting in Sophia was the implementation-ness of the solution (can whatever we recommend be used in today's browser). 
Extending HTML is of course not ideal, but having rethought about other solutions, I'm not sure there is anything that will comply with this requirement anyway (in particular, I realized that the CSS 'display: none' feature is not in CSS1 core and therefore is not available yet in all CSS-ready browser). 
Regarding this issue and others, we need to clearly differentiate what belongs to the HTML specs (semantics of ALT vs. TITLE vs. ALTSRC vs. content of A, etc) and what belongs in a browser UI guidelines (e.g. how does the user activates the ALTSRC link of an IMG used as an A). Hi Dave-- One simple extension/documentation of the alt tag would be to specify how "decorative" images should be handled in non-image environments. 
A large number of WWW pages use images for realizing visual effects that have no semantic value (most users who can see would probably be equally happy to nuke them) --a prime example is "blank.gif" for a background color or "line.gif" for a stylized line. 
Best Regards, --raman as representative of my employer, Adobe Systems Inc. 
One proposal quite a few years old is for authors to provide a null value for alt as distinct from omiting alt, e.g. User agents would be recommended to default alt based upon the url's name, e.g. img src=logo.gif would yield "logo" as the default. 
Does this sound reasonable? 
Regards, -- Dave Raggett dsr@w3.org 
http://www.w3.org/People/Raggett World Wide Web Consortium (on assignment from HP Labs) to follow up on what Dave Raggett said: This is not just a proposal. 
Lynx responds reasonably well to this usage and there are authors using it. 
There are better defaulting rules, but they take more work. 
Have you read and the attached note about "metadata percolation"? 
The proposal there reflects my reaction to several go-arounds on this issue on the lynx-dev list [not a Lynx consensus, may I make clear]. 
[More in reponse to Daniel...] WARNING: I don't think that we have time enough to reach a consensus on this issue here before you release this draft, even if it's not tomorrow. 
Al Gilman The null alt tag as well as an on the fly alt computed from the foo.gif name are both reasonable compromise solutions --I heavily use the second at present. 
However, I'm not completely happy with the null alt value -- Best Regards, --raman as representative of my employer, Adobe Systems Inc. to follow up on what Daniel Dardailler said: I have been holding off some input to let the action item stuckees frame the discussion. 
There is a solution that does not involve any change to standards. 
This is to reference the long description from within the metadata capabilities of the Internet Media Types (formerly MIME types) framework. 
This could be supplied as a text value for an header field or indirectly by an URI value withing a header field. 
I don't know what fielded GUI browsers include in their realization of an "information page" or if you can get such a page for images referenced as the content of an IMG tag. 
If the long description is realized as the text value of an HTTP header for the image, Lynx, for example, already gives the user an access path for that information with its image_links mode and head-request command. 
There is a reasonable question as to whether this is too indirect to satisfy the requirement. 
I would prefer to address that with all deliberate speed in the context of the requirement-development action item that the WAI WG has started. 
Al Gilman This alt="" reliably informs the client that nothing of consequence is in that gif. 
If the alt="..." were #REQUIRED, I would not have it default to "" in any authoring tool, but rather to some serious reminder to the author that useful description is required of information otherwise conveyed. 
Also the consequence of alt="" should be noted; it may get rid of some of that information-free noise. 
That could give a "first-look" default while awaiting the response to the head title content request Al proposes. 
One of Al Gilman's proposals, as I understand it, is upon encountering a non-local URL with no alt="...", to get the head of that URL, and extract the TITLE from it to provide the default value. 
That seems useful, at least for those documents that actually include the required TITLE element! 
Agreed. 
Regards/Harvey Bingham It is also necessary to distinguish how the alt attribute should be defined in the HTML specification from the usage suggestions that would be included in style guidelines. 
However, the treatment of alt by user agents could at least be partially explained within the HTML specification itself rather than in UI guidelines. 
HTML 2.0 and 3.2 already offer suggestions as to how certain features of HTML should be presented to the user. 
Thus, a recommendation that the value of alt should be defaulted to the name of the image file, would be reasonable to include within the HTML specification, provided that the WAI Working Group were to reach a consensus in favour of that approach. 
My personal opinion is that authors should be strongly encouraged to devise their own labels for images, and that in the case of purely decorative graphics such descriptive contents should be kept as brief as possible. 
However, this suggestion belongs within the province of style guidelines. 
Another possible point of confusion for authors is that HTML offers the potential for both an alt attribute and an advisory title whenever an image appears as the content of an anchor element. 
In most instances that I have encountered of proper use of the alt attribute, the link target is described within the alt text. 
Assuming that readers would not benefit significantly from both an advisory title and a brief description of the image, the value of one of the two attributes would become redundant in such cases. 
Again, this is probably an issue that should be addressed in style guidelines. 
I am also in favour of making provision for long descriptions of images, which could be used whenever the meaning conveyed by a graphic can not be stated in a brief description, as is required by the alt attribute. 
I would rather wait to read the action item before making further comments on this matter. 
Jason White. 
Harvey's proposal raises the important question of which attributes should be optional, and which should be required by the HTML specification. 
It would be interesting to know why it was originally decided, when HTML 2.0 was drafted, that the alt attribute would be merely an option, and whether the issue could and should be decided differently today. 
The same questions can be asked with respect to other aspects of HTML Cougar that are of importance to people with disabilities, such as labels in tables and the proposals relating to forms. 
At least one positive outcome of making an attribute mandatory is that software which verifies the validity of HTML documents would report non-compliance as an error, thereby creating a strong incentive for authors to include the attribute in question. 
Such issues can only be decided by considering arguments on both sides. 
I would assume that the status of attributes has been thoroughly debated as part of the HTML development process. 
Now that the WAI has been established, would it be possible or desirable for such decisions to be reconsidered? 
Jason White.
