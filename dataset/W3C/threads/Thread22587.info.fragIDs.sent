Thanks, Philippe. 
Now, if you try to set the prefix with a null namespaceURI, you'll get a DOMException.NAMESPACE_ERR: 
Right; I'm assuming (although I didn't state it) that one sets the namespace URI first. 
There is no way to set the prefix on a DOM Level 1 node. 
There is not, but I'm talking about setting the prefix on a DOM Level 2 node that has been created with the DOM Level 1 method Document.createElement(). 
I can't find in the spec anywhere where it says one cannot set a prefix on 
such an element. 
It does say that, "For nodes of any type other than ELEMENT_NODE and ATTRIBUTE_NODE and nodes created with a DOM Level 1 method, such as createElement from the Document interface, this is always null." 
But if this implies that the prefix cannot be set, is there an exception thrown, or is the new prefix simply ignored? 
Node.nodeName is read only. 
You can't set it. 
You're completely right. 
I was overthinking that... Garret 
The namespaceURI attribute is read-only in DOM Level 2. 
I would expect to get either and NAMESPACE_ERR or a NO_MODIFICATION_ALLOWED_ERR here. 
Perhaps *which* I should expect 
should be clarified in the recommendation, but the "always" leads me to think it can't be changed. 
Since I can't set the namespaceURI attribute, that seems reasonable.

As I said, you'll get a NAMESPACE_ERR DOMException if you try to set the prefix with a null namespaceURI. 
The recommendation is clear on that point. 
prefix will always be null for a DOM Level 1 node and there is no way to change that. 
And Fred is right, there is no way to change the namespaceURI of a Node after his creation: the Node.namespaceURI attribute is read-only.
