Hello, May I know on Word documents of what size and styles HTML Tidy was tested?

Hi Y'All, Does anyone know why tidy generates an error with... line 20 column 3 - warning: frameset attribute "rows" has invalid value "3*,5*" But, does not generate an error with... Regards, Brian "The lights of stars that were extinguished ages ago still reaches us.

Mobile: +351 96 318 6759 Timezone: GMT/BST --- SYBASE dba --- Reiki Master --- Irish Mythologist --- The Servants of the Light WebMaster I'm not personally a Word-2000 user, but we do include various Word documents in our regression tests for Tidy. 
The files probably range in size from 20 K to 100 K. I couldn't tell you how complex the documents are, but they are usually from real-world cases. 
The Word-2000 support in Tidy is improving all the time. 
Do you have a specific task in mind or concern? 
i.e. have you tried current versions of Tidy, and if you are unhappy with the results, please report any bugs and provide the Word-2000 files etc. 
I'm sure users that Tidy Word-2000 documents regularly, will speak up.

which is a Word-HTML to XML converter (which suggests well formedness and also "tidyness").

Hello Terry, TT I'm not personally a Word-2000 user, but we do include various Word TT documents in our regression tests for Tidy. 
The files probably range in TT size from 20 K to 100 K. I couldn't tell you how complex the documents are, TT but they are usually from real-world cases. 
Not more than 100 K? TT The Word-2000 support in Tidy is improving all the time. 
TT Do you have a specific task in mind or concern? 
i.e. have you tried current TT versions of Tidy, and if you are unhappy with the results, please report TT any bugs and provide the Word-2000 files etc. 
I have a real task to convert .doc to .html. 
I want to know something beforehand, because although I have one more way to convert .doc to .html, but results till now are not as desired. 
TT I'm sure users that Tidy Word-2000 documents regularly, will speak up. 
I hope so. 
And ask users who use Tidy for cleaning Word2000 documents to answer.

I am converting Word to HTML through a few steps. 
Save word as HTML Make some manual changes to the document to support fields Run Microsofts "filter.exe" on the document Run Tidy on the document to output xhtml, but not using the option designed for word html. 
Make some more manual changes Do a transform using xslt I have some specific needs and thus found I had to use all these steps. 
I am doing this on some "large" word docs about 200Kb Tidy is working very consistently so I am happy. 
The only weirdness I have found is that non-ascii text inside comments is getting mangled, I cut the comments out, run tidy, then paste the comments back in, no longer commented out. 
My xslt transform handles them then. 
I think this has been fixed - perhaps you aren't running a recent version of Tidy.

MS has published an improved filter, which I believe Fred uses. 
For information on how to get and use the MS filter, see: Maintaining files in Word is convenient if you need both PDF and HTML output. 
We found a bit of prep work on the Word side helped a great deal. 
In particular, getting folks to use Word styles like Heading 1, 2, 3 and apply styles for bullet and numbered lists. 
These come through to HTML as class attributes for applying fonts, colors, etc. 
The only post-processing we needed to do was to insert a link to our real CSS stylesheet. 
A very simple sed script did the trick. 
About size, Tidy is an in-memory program. 
But with most computers having tens of MB of RAM available, it would take a huge document to blow it out. 
To guesstimate the RAM needed, take the HTML file size and double or triple it. 
hope this helps, Charlie
