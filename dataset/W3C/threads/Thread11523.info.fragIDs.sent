<s> Hello Igor, everyone,  </s>
<s> IIRC you're free to modify the stylesheets and make local copies of them.  </s>
<s> However it's forbidden to modify the W3C logo, and your published version has to link to the W3C site, not your local copy of logo.  </s>
<s> Anyways, let's see what will the W3C folks say.  </s>
