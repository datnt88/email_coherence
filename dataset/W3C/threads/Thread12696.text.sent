Anyway, here's my response. 
It should be noted that I have access to a lot of general lists for Web developers. 
I've also been compiling a list of government/military and educational Webmasters.

Good point. 
I have an writer starting for me in the February issue. 
He's going to write about authoring Web sites for PR companies. 
Plus, as a result of doing product reviews for the newsletter, I am in touch with 74 of the major technology PR firms. 
Each firm has sent me contact information for 1-5 reps. 
I got so much e-mail....I sorted them into seperate mailboxes in Eudora... :) Needless to say, I never delete anything.
