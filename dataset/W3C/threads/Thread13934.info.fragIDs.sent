<s> So we need to come up with a new guideline to attach both a short and long description to PRE representing graphical information.  </s>
<s> For the short description, I think we should require a caption in the markup, following and preceeding the PRE used as graphics.  </s>
<s> The SMIL spec seems to cover that well (e.g. Figure 6.1)  </s>
<s> For the longdesc, I would fallback to a D link anchor at the end of the caption.  </s>
<s> So to illustrate what I mean on the example above: audio video P Figure 6.1: Effect of a delay on playout schedule for different settings of the sync attribute.  </s>

<s> The other problem for the person using a screen reader is that there is no indication where the ascii art begins.  </s>
<s> Therefore if this method is used, someone would hear all of the dashes and words and then the description.  </s>
<s> If this were an image it would be clear (image, caption, d-link).  </s>
<s> Perhaps if the caption was first, then the ascii art followed by some sort of "end figure" text, perhaps the "d" link, it might make it less confusing.  </s>

<s> DD:: OK, so let's have two recommendations: for inline graphics done using plain text (using PRE for example), - [Interim] make sure you announce the beginning and the end of graphic portion using a text "marker" understandable by the user reading the page, so that she or he can skip this portion.  </s>
<s> - [New] use PRE and class=graphics In both cases, include a long description link for the graphic.  </s>
<s> One way to do the interim job while keeping the original look is to use CSS display=none on some marked SPAN: audio video P Figure 6.1: Effect of a delay on playout schedule for different settings of the sync attribute.  </s>
