I wanted to offer some comments on the draft which is at [1]. 
Dan Brickley, myself and others had an extended discussion this week about this issue. 
I would like to offer the following suggestion as a recommendation re the use of dc:subject. 
I believe the best way to express the fact that a particular image depicts a thing which is a member of the class of Lions would be to say: LionImage aAnimalImage; foaf:depicts[aLion]. 
Lion aowl:Class; subClassOfMammal; Mammalaowl:Class; AnimalImageaowl:Class; The alternative way of expressing similar information is to use the dc:subject property along with the SKOS model [2] for describing concepts that are intended to act as 'subjects' or 'topics' for information resources. 
LionImage aAnimalImage; dc:subjectLionConcept; LionConcept askos:Concept; skos:prefLabel'Lions'; skos:broaderMammalConcept; MammalConcept askos:Concept; skos:prefLabel'Mammals'; skos:narrowerLionConcept; The SKOS vocab already defines a class 'Concept' and a set of properties for organising concepts into a hierarchy, without demanding that the hierarchy implies a subclass relationship. 
I refer the WG to the document [2] which outlines the SKOS-Core schema, although you should currently ignore the final section on 'using SKOS-Core with DC and FOAF' as this will change shortly to be in line with the model of usage that I have briefly described here. 
Yours, Alistair.

Sorry, resending this correcting some N3 syntax mistakes ... I believe the best way to express the fact that a particular image depicts a thing which is a member of the class of Lions would be to say (this is the FOAF model): LionImage aAnimalImage; foaf:depicts[aLion]. 
Lion aowl:Class; subClassOfMammal. 
Mammalaowl:Class. 
AnimalImageaowl:Class. 
The alternative way of expressing similar information is to use the dc:subject property along with the SKOS model [2] for describing concepts that are intended to act as 'subjects' or 'topics' for information resources. 
LionImage aAnimalImage; dc:subjectLionConcept. 
LionConcept askos:Concept; skos:prefLabel'Lions'; skos:broaderMammalConcept. MammalConcept askos:Concept; skos:prefLabel'Mammals'; skos:narrowerLionConcept. 
The SKOS vocab already defines a class 'Concept' and a set of properties for organising concepts into a hierarchy, without demanding that the hierarchy implies a subclass relationship.

There will likely be various other RDF vocabs that adopt a similar approach. 
The basic idea with foaf:topic is to be able to say that some Document is 'about' (has as a subject/topic/etc) some particular thing. 
We recently extended this by creating foaf:primaryTopic, for cases where a Document has a very obvious dominant topic. 
Yes. 
I think the work we do here in the THES/PORT tf will need to do two things. 
We should articulate a vocabulary in the broader/narrower/etc tradition that is sufficient to represent thesauri *as thesauri* (SKOS is an excellent candidate there imho), but we should also go deeper into an explanation into these two fundamentally different (and complimentary) approaches to topic description. 
The thread I started on public-esw-thes yesterday picks up this line of enquiry too, using a geographical example. 
This reminds me, I was going to propose to the WG that the thesaurus/porting tf adopt that mailing list as it's main home, with periodic reports back here. 
Al, everyone, what do you think? 
Dan ps. http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/talks/200404-synthesis/ is my brief talk from tuesday's SWAD-Europe meeting. 
Has a few more notes on these issues. 
pps. 
does someone have a pointer to the latest work here on wordnet-in-rdf? 
I'd like to address a couple of points here. 
First, how much should the notes on patterns promote specific vocabulary, such as SKOS? 
For instance, your second solution is almost identical to approach 3 in the note and the only difference (it seems to me) is using a specific SKOS vocabulary (and making all concepts/subjects to be instances of skos:Concept) rather than local concepts that I made up. 
Should the pattern be using that vocabulary, thus encouraging others to use it? 
With SKOS in particular, I am pledging ignorance and have to ask: how accepted is it and would it be premature to refer to it in the note? 
On the one hand, using concepts from other ontologies in the patterns that we produce is a great show-case for the whole SW idea. 
On the other, we don't want to have patterns rely on more transient ontologies (I am not trying to imply that SKOS is transient, just wondering about the general policy). 
Any policy on that that we should have? 
For example, should I change the approach 3 in the pattern to use skos vocabulary as Alistair suggests below? 
For the specific use case, as I've pointed out earlier, what I was trying to use the pattern for is to talk about images/books, etc that are not about specific lions (and book is a better example here), but rather about a class of lions. 
That said, the solution like your first one, comes up often enough (even though it's a different "ontological pattern", to use Aldo's terminology), that it should be included in the note. 
Look for it in version 3. Natasha
