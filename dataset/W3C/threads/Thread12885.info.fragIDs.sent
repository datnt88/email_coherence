<s> Hello! I took a stab at reworking our definition of Web accessibility.  </s>
<s> Mainly I took Judy's language and moved it around some.  </s>
<s> Feel free to add, edit, shred!  </s>
<s> Best, Sarah What is Web Accessibility?  </s>
<s> An accessible Web can be used by people with disabilities.  </s>
<s> To this end, Web accessibility is an effort to integrate accessible components into the Web.  </s>
<s> These components include:  </s>
<s> - content that is presented in a way that can be perceived, operated, navigated, and understood by people with disabilities; -software used to access the Web that can be used by people with disabilities, and that works with technologies that some people with disabilities use; and -software used to build Web sites that can be used by people with disabilities, and that supports the creation of accessible Web sites.  </s>
<s> Web accessibility also: - benefits other users of the Web; and  </s>
<s> - is a requirement for some Web sites and Web applications in certain countries.  </s>
<s> Another possibility to mull over (condensing of Judy's and Sarah's versions): What is Web Accessibility?  </s>
<s> An accessible Web can be used by people with disabilities.  </s>
<s> Web accessibility includes: -- Creating content that can be perceived, operated, navigated, and understood by people with disabilities.  </s>
<s> -- Making browsers, multimedia players, and other software used to access Web sites more usable by people with disabilities.  </s>
<s> -- Developing software for producing Web sites that can be used by people with disabilities and that support the creation of accessible Web sites.  </s>
<s> Web accessibility also: -- Benefits other users of the Web.  </s>
<s> -- Is a requirement for some Web sites and Web applications in certain countries.  </s>
<s> Also: 1.  </s>
<s> The title of the presentation - Overview of the Web Accessibility Initiative - is misleading for me.  </s>
<s> It leads me to believe that the presentation will be solely about WAI, not about Web accessibility and what WAI does to achieve it.  </s>
<s> Possible alternative: Web Accessibility and the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative  </s>
<s> This title is longish but covers the slide content (first section of slides on Web Accessibility, two slides on W3C, and last section on WAI. 2. I think Slide 1 could more accurately reflect the slide show content.  </s>
<s> 3. Three of the six style choices for the slide show are not entirely accessible - i.e, I cannot read some of the text!  </s>
<s> Is it possible to create new styles for the show?  </s>
<s> Revise some?  </s>
<s> I am familiar with CSS and can work on this.  </s>
<s> 4. I've sent other editorial/grammatical suggestions to Judy.  </s>
<s> Regards, Blossom Blossom Michaeloff Web Research &amp; Design Wells Fargo 415.222.3045 michaeka@wellsfargo.com  </s>
<s> After all these years, I really think that this should be at the top (rather than as an "oh, by the way" item) - in the form "Web accessibility benefits all users of the Web" (incidentally, even including PWD).  </s>
<s> The real/main/important/primary/inclusive/overarching feature of "Universal Design" is that it is in fact UNIVERSAL.  </s>
<s> That in some enlightened places it is also the law matters some.  </s>
<s> That it's nice not to exclude people who have traditionally been overlooked (except for their exclusion) is secondary to what WAI has pointed the way to: a Web that is usable by everyone and has its semantics stored therein.  </s>
<s> As we undertook to formulate guidelines for the purpose of making the Web accessible for PWD we discovered that what we proposed should be done routinely so that everyone could use the Web.  </s>
<s> The absurd "resistances" we encountered along the way merely reflected ancient prejudices within most (all?) cultures that demean/overlook/exclude PWD.  </s>
<s> There has never been any logical reason that the semantics of Web content not be available and when we did XAG we even found an abstract way to  </s>
<s> express this - in very general, but concrete terms.  </s>
<s> Love.  </s>
<s> It's Bad Luck to be Superstitious!  </s>
<s> [removed cross-posting to PFWG mailing list; forwarding my reply to that list.  </s>
<s> please do not cross-post, especially to lists in different access spaces -- thanks.]  </s>
<s> I disagree that we should introduce PWD as being incidental to what Web accessibility is about.  </s>
<s> I think that _after_ a listing of the basics is where the "benefits all users" belongs.  </s>
<s> I think it's fine to cover this elsewhere in the presentation, which we do,  </s>
<s> but to lead with it takes away from the point of Web accessibility being to increase access for people with disabilities.  </s>

<s> I like the direction on this -- great re-organization of what we were  </s>
<s> trying to say, but still seems wordy &amp; jargony in a few areas (e.g., repetition of "components").  </s>
<s> Also like the sub-bullets leading with "content" "software" etc - Judy  </s>

<s> I like the condensed lead-in.  </s>
<s> But I think Sarah's "content that..." "software used to..." is easier to follow than "creating" "making" etc.  </s>
<s> It's not the process but the result that is our end goal.  </s>
<s> Other comments below.  </s>
<s> i think this part reads better if we leave out the "also"  </s>
<s> i don't understand the contradiction; it _is_ about wai, but necessarily talking wai involves talking about web accessibility.  </s>
<s> pretty long; still don't understand why clarification is necessary.  </s>
<s> are other people getting a jolt of surprise when they read the content of the presentation, compared to the name?  </s>
<s> any shorter ways that we could clarify this, if so?  </s>
<s> needs to be updated and condensed.  </s>
<s> suggestions would be helpful.  </s>
<s> we have already noted the need to send revision requests to the slidemaker tool editor (different w3c people have been working on recently) requesting repairs to the style sheet problems, and more caution with future revisions to the tool.  </s>
<s> when i revised the source file for these slides, the slides re-generated from a somewhat experimental version of the tool.  </s>
<s> this is a known problem that we are following up on.  </s>
<s> we have already received recommended style sheet fixes.  </s>
<s> thanks Judy  </s>
