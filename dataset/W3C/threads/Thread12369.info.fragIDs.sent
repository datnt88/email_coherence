<s> Liddy has been admirably getting up at 2am on a regular basis to join our call.  </s>
<s> I don't think we should continue to ask her to do that.  </s>
<s> I  </s>

<s> This needs to take into account European time, Australian time and both east and west coast North American time.  </s>
<s> How is everyone with 4:00pm EDT on Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday?  </s>
<s> This would make it 6:00am in Australia and 9:00 pm in Europe.  </s>
<s> Or does anyone have an alternative suggestion?  </s>

<s> According to the International Meeting Planner, Jutta's suggestion of 4pm EST is pretty good - although it is actually 10pm in Europe.  </s>
<s> 3pm EST would be 5am in Australia and 9pm in Europe.  </s>

<s> Thank you - I do appreciate this gesture.  </s>
<s> I believe 4.00pm on Tuesday would clash with the IMS meetings, if they continue at that time... Liddy  </s>
<s> Hi Jutta,  </s>
<s> The same issue arose a few weeks ago in the PF group.  </s>
<s> It is very difficult to find a common time that works for every time zone.  </s>
<s> 10pm Central European Time means I can make some of the calls, but not all of them, but I understand the change.  </s>

<s> I hesitate to speak for Heather, but in her absence, the time is do-able here in Pacific time; however, at glancing at her schedule she may have conflicts with this time, at least on Mondays/Wednesdays--Tuesdays look like a 30 minute conflict (at the last 1/2 hour).  </s>
<s> I don't know if these are times that she can adjust or not.  </s>
<s> She'll be back and able to speak for her own schedule next week.  </s>
<s> When did you need to make a firm decision?  </s>
<s> Thanks!  </s>
