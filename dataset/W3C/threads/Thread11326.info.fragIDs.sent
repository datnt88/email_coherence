<s> This note was originally posted to the SGML WG list server on 25 June; thanks to Jon Bosak for pointing out that it never went out to the list as a whole.  </s>
<s> -CMSMcQ In its meeting today (25 June 1997), the ERB discussed the problem of namespaces, and in particular the proposal to include ':' as a name character in XML.  </s>
<s> The group decided unanimously that: - colon (&amp;#x003A;) will be added to XML as a name-start character (N.B. *not* just as a name-character--as a name-*start* character.) - the use of colon in XML names will be reserved for experimentation with name spaces and schema scoping; since it will be standardized in its semantics at some future point, anyone using it is running the risk that their work will be invalidated by the standardization and will require updating when the standardization (which is not guaranteed to use the colon separator at all) is completed.  </s>
<s> - As a result: authors should not use colon in their DTDs (except as part of a name-space/schema-scoping experiment), but parsers *should* accept colon as a name-start character.  </s>
<s> Other decisions will be reported separately.  </s>

<s> This decision strongly implies that a particular namespace resolution strategy is "on the way."  </s>
<s> You could achieve the same effect (without the side-effect) by merely saying that ":" is a legal name character but is reserved for future use (without saying what that use might be).  </s>

<s> The inference you are drawing is unwarranted: there is no guarantee that the name-space solution eventually adopted for XML will use colons in names.  </s>
<s> The problem (at least the problem I have) with  </s>
<s> not explaining why colon is reserved is that it divides the world into the in-group (who know why it's reserved and get to experiment) and the out-group (who don't know why and who are effectively told not to experiment).  </s>
<s> It's reserved for a simple reason and there seems no need to keep that reason secret.  </s>
<s> Is there?  </s>

<s> I'm not inferring it.  </s>
<s> I'm inferring that others will infer it.  </s>
<s> :) My concern is that all future namespace research will start from: "What's a good way to use that colon?"  </s>
<s> It's like if my wife sets aside a room in the house and says its the children's room -- if we ever have children.  </s>
<s> The room will become a vacuum waiting to be filled!  </s>
<s> I can see your problem of the in- and out-crowd .  </s>
<s> I suppose I would prefer if the : were merely reserved for "experimentation" (into whatever).  </s>
<s> I might use it to represent OOP inheritance hierarchies.  </s>
<s> We could also bite the bullet and reserve "::" and let 'namechar:namechar' be used (for experimentation or whatever).  </s>
<s> That would have the benefit of not breaking the experiments when the final solution is rolled out.  </s>
<s> Paul Prescod  </s>
<s> Er, that seems to be presupposing that a final solution will use :: rather than just : by itself.... If we know that already, there is  </s>
<s> no need to experiment with the syntax!  </s>
<s> Clearly this isn't decided.  </s>
<s> I think that the draft wording Michael posted is just fine.  </s>
<s> Perhaps there's scope for a Rationale of XML book ("The Spirit of XML"??), in which this could be further elaborated upon...  </s>
<s> Lee  </s>
<s> No, it is presupposing that we may need to use :: for something special in the future.  </s>
<s> It needent say what and it needent ever be used.  </s>
<s> If we know that already, there is no need to experiment with the syntax!  </s>
<s> That doesn't follow.  </s>
<s> The current spec reserves the colon character to allow people to experiment with the semantics, not the syntax.  </s>
<s> Mine does the same, but allows people to use the single colon to experiment with *anything* not just namespaces, and also allows us to use the double colon for anything in the future, not just namespaces.  </s>
<s> It also stops our final standard from breaking experiments (in whatever) that occur in the meantime..  </s>
<s> This seems like the appropriate place for that kind of rationale about the future of the standard.  </s>
