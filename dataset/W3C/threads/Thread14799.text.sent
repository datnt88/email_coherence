One more issue: I don't know of any group, organization, government, legislative body or anything else that has a solid set of standards for web captioning with regard to * font size * words per minute * lines of text per viewing frame * capital characters versus lower case Or anything else along these lines. 
There are standards for television, but are there any for the Web? 
If there is a set of standards, should we refer to them? 
If there isn't a set of standards, should we create one?

Hi, Paul: Actually, there aren't any standards for these things in the broadcast world. 
Font size is determined by the available technology; the rest are determined by individual captioning agencies in conjunction with viewers. 
Including some common-sense pointers in the guidelines is a good idea--for starters see http://main.wgbh.org/wgbh/pages/captioncenter/ccstyles.html-- but I don't think the WAI is the proper body to write a full recommendation about captioning. 
Some caption agencies, including The Caption Center, have already put in years of research regarding caption timing, display, quality, comprehension, etc. Geoff Freed WGBH/NCAM Hi, Paul: Actually, there aren't any standards for these things in the broadcast world.
