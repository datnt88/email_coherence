Hi folks, 
We have recently set up an IRC channel as a parallel to #rdfig which is in 
Italian. 
I am not sure how many people reading this list speak Italian, but 
the idea is that there are people who do, and who were struggling with RDFIG 
in english. 
If this experiment (and it is still very much that) works, we may 
try to repeat it for other languages. 
Some links: The thing was "chumped" in RDFIG on 5 September: 
There are two days of logs (quiet, and the logs are hand-edited so badly 
formated): http://www.w3.org/People/Charles/rdfit/20020905a and 
regularl logging bot on this channel and keep the logs in a predictable 
and stable place.) Cheers Chaals

Cool. Reminds me that http://www.w3.org/RDF/translations.html 
includes an Italian translation of the old Model and Syntax spec. 
I wonder if as part of outreach efforts we could look into finding folk to update (or create) translations of key RDF/SW specs (and other docs?). 
I could bring this up in the Semantic Web Coordination Group, since it'd 
need to fit with RDFCore and WebOnt WG's schedules. 
I'm not sure what 
point in the spec lifecycle is best for encouraging tranlations... need to look into precedents, policy etc first. 
Anyway http://www.xml.it:23456/RDF/REC-rdf-syntax-19990222-it.html is the 
Italian version of M+S... Dan ps. re stable url for logs, I hope to have esw.w3.org soon for a public Wiki, we could use that namespace for IRC logs too. 
I prefer not to have publically writeable stuff at http://www.w3.org/* URIs, to avoid confusion... 
nice one charles! 
I think this is exactly the sort of thing we ought to be doing in the project.

Translations of key specs is something that the W3C Offices (apart from UK and Australia at least!) do a lot of. 
I could ask around to see whether offices have tried this - and they could be a source of translators.

By "tried this" I meant of course carried out translations for key RDF/SW recs. 
Case of not carrying the context from brain to finger (how swebby :-) B 
Hi Brain, that would be great. 
They might also be willing to host logs / chumplogs. 
I think we want to have them "in perpetuity" whatever that really means. 
I also have some thoughts about logging and chumping: Auto-translation of an IRC channel currently doesn't work usefully. 
But there are a few things "chumped" each day on RDFIG - documents, resources, etc that people on the channel thougt were interesting. 
I think it would be useful (picking up on Danny Ayers' idea) to collect those from channels in different languages and at least post them into a single multi-lingual channel. 
There are a lot of multilingual people working on the semantic Web, so one could hope for a number of those to have the annotations translated. 
At which point it is useful to post a ponter back to language-specific groups. 
(With more powerful chumping we could do more - pick up on something chumped in english, and add italian annotations. 
Then use something like RSS to collect the chumped resources which have an italian annotation. 
Or which don't, to see if any should get translated. 
I would also like to unify chumping and logging, so a chumpbot can add a pointer to the context in a logfile.) cheers Chaals
