Dear Dev, I unzipped and attempted to build Amaya 8.2 for Windows using VC++ 6.0 SP 5 on Windows 2000 Pro. 
I followed the instructions for compiling for windows. 
The Compilers project succeeded in building. 
The amaya project failed with these errors: Build : warning : failed to (or don't know how to) build 'D:\Projects\Amaya82\Amaya\libraptor\raptor_uri.c' 
Compiling... ntriples_parse.c 
fatal error C1083: Cannot open source file: 'D:\Projects\Amaya82\Amaya\libraptor\ntriples_parse.c': 
No such file or directory raptor_parse.c 
fatal error C1083: Cannot open source file: 'D:\Projects\Amaya82\Amaya\libraptor\raptor_parse.c': 
No such file or directory 
raptor_uri.c fatal error C1083: Cannot open source file: 'D:\Projects\Amaya82\Amaya\libraptor\raptor_uri.c': 
No such file or directory Error executing cl.exe. 
I could not find the three files in the tgz archive for Amaya 8.2 for Windows. 
Best regards, -Doug

I don't understand why it didn't compile. 
I checked that these files are included into the tar file. 
Could you try to go into the subproject libraptor and launch the compiling of this library by hand.

The amaya.dsw file was generated by the version 6. Probably it's the reason of the trouble. 
Could you try to start form .dsp files.
