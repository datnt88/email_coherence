Hi, could someone please elucidate this sentence from the minutes for me? 
As an implementation plan, the group will tighten the wording on HOST to make it clear that it is a MUST, and plan to make the shift after widespread deployment of HTTP 1.1 I can read this two ways: - The group wants to stick with HOST, but make it (more) mandatory - The group wants to change to full URL, but wants to do that in HTTP 1.2 instead of HTTP 1.1 The first reading seems to me to be less than sound, architecturally. 
The second reading seems to me to be based on the premise that it will be easier to change the 200.000 HTTP 1.1 servers 1 year from now than the current crop of 50.000 HTTP 1.0 servers. 
Somehow that doesn't strike me as completely obvious either. 
Is there a third reading that I missed? 
Harald T. Alvestrand While I agree with John I believe that we need to give something more than a few weeks notice of a major change. 
There are some people who are very keen to have a 1.1 spec out in time for the May 1st parade (oops wrong country). 
Phill, I'm one of the people who is very keen to have a 1.1 spec out before May. 
I'm even more keen, from my MCI perspective, to start telling vendors about things we insist that they do in order for us to buy their products... a list that prominently features "things that make service-bureau-like Web sites manageable and keep the net from melting down". 
I have an extremely strong preference for stating those requirements in terms of reference to the words in a standards-track document. 
Why? (i) Because it is The Right Thing To Do and (ii) I really believe that a WG rough consensus position is more likely to be correct --by virtue of reflecting analysis from more different perspectives-- than anything I (or my organization come up with by myself (ourselves) rom my MCI-ish point of view (people associated with vendors read that as "this is a customer speaking"), I've got no particular incentive to invest in deploying 1.1 products in the absence of a solution to the "domain name not delivered to server" problem. 
That doesn't mean we wouldn't deploy such a thing, but we are not actively on the market for one. 
Conversely, I do have a lot of incentive to invest in and deploy a 1.1 (or 2.0) that does contain a fix for this problem. 
rom my internet experience point of view, the current "use 'host' if the domain name isn't otherwise supplied" language isn't a fix -- it is an attempted patch that won't work well enough. 
I actually feel a little better about "host required always", but I don't think it is good enough and that the rate of growth issues argue extremely strongly for "fix it now, and fix it right". 
And, while the schedule is tight, nothing has convinced me that we can make better decisions in an area like this if we spend the next six months thinking about it than if we, well, decide. 
The marketplace won't wait while we engage in extended self-contemplation. 
john There is clear concenus that #2 is unacceptable. 
I also would have prefered #2 but it can't be. 
#4 can be defined to interoperate and solve the problem as defined. 
This discussion has been useful because it saved me from having to argue in the coming weeks that for Host: to be meaningful it had to be required. 
That's decided. 
Lets move on to our remaing issues as well as making sure the description of host: is correct. 
One of the earlier posts which mentioned host: indicated that the host port should be included with the host name. 
I fully support that approach: 1. 
It simplifies the definition of the content of host: ... just take the whole host address portion of the URL 2. It retains potentially useful information which is otherwise lost. 
For example, a firewall or other gateway might desire to map two external listening ports to a single internal server. 
In essence, the current protocol has the problem because information is thrown away. 
WHy take the risk. 
3. It happens to correspond to NETSCAPE's implementation.
