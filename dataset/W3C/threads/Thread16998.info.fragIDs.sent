<s> As far as I can tell - but note that this is not an authoritative answer - is that the above describes using standard HTTP 3** status codes to, in effect, instruct the browser that a resource has moved either permanently or temporarily to another location.  </s>
<s> - Tina Holmboe  </s>
<s> There are many issues to do with hacks used for redirecting without server side configuration: 1) without content on the page, they can produce the more and more frequent syndrome of web sites that consist of exactly one page which is completely empty (scripting unavailable or disabled for policy reasons, or Refresh on an older browser - although the latter tends to produce sites consisting of one GIF image, or Flash fanfare); 2) with content, they can result in the content flashing up for long enough to be noticed but not long enough for someone who takes a long time to read a page to be sure that the content was not relevant; 3) when implemented using Refresh (NB this is strongly discouraged in the HTML specification itself, but very common), it results in broken back buttons - as soon as you hit back you are forced forwards again; 4) when implemented in the most obvious way with scripting, it also breaks the back button - more recent browsers have an alternative method that doesn't break it, but I don't think this existed in the original browser object models; 5) Status 30x redirects work with essentially any browser and, in theory, if not in practice, have allowed automatic repair of bookmarks (Favorites in Microsoft speak) for a very long time.  </s>
<s> Status 301 redirects definitely allow for more effective repair of broken links, when used in combination with link checker programs - unfortunately, execept for the automatic redirect to repair URLs with missing final /s, they are very rare.  </s>
<s> If you generate "Location: xxxx", and possibly "Status: 30x", at the head of your CGI output (or set the corresponding server object properties in ASP), I would say that you were compliant.  </s>
<s> The guideline is not intended to be used legalistically.  </s>
<s> It is simply covering the most common case of failing to use the server side functions, which often arises because people either like a one tool approach (everything in the HTML document) or are using such cheap web space that they are not allowed to configure that part of the server meta-data.  </s>
<s> Note that you should not use just Location or use a status of 302 (or 301) if you are redirecting to confirmation page from a POSTed form.  </s>
<s> A conforming browser (early GUI ones are not conforming) will try and re-post the form to that URL, and a security conscious browser will first ask for confirmation.  </s>
<s> There is a specific status code for this purpose.  </s>
<s> (As well as 302 responses to POSTs, the other common server side redirect errors are sending the client a redirect to a custom "not found" page - it's OK on NCSA, and I think Apache, to use an internal page, as the redirection is performed locally and the client sees just the 404 response - and relative URLs that actually get sent to the client.  </s>
<s> The former frustrates link checking programs and the latter is, in practice, harmless, although a protocol violation.)  </s>
<s> I'd say that it was well within the spirit; the CGI script is something that is configuring the server.  </s>
<s> They are basically saying use Status 30x/Location, not "Refresh: 0:xxxxx" or location.href  </s>

<s> Rebecca, if you want to redirect your visitors permanently (ie you have changed your file structure, deleted files ...) and are using an Apache server (majority of cases), just include the following line for each file in your .htaccess file on the server (root directory): RedirectPermanent /somePath/spmeFileName.htm  </s>
<s> This will cause a server-side redirect without client interaction, thus avoiding meta or JavaScript redirects, which are dependent on the client software?s  </s>
<s> capability of understanding the code.  </s>
<s> The .htaccess file should be default be calleds by the server before anything is delivered to the client.  </s>
<s> .htaccess  </s>
<s> allows you to configure a number of server-side functions, including password protected access and server-side redirects.  </s>
<s> I?m sure that other server systems have similar functions.  </s>
<s> If you are doing redirects dependent on the client software or user?s behaviour, you will have to use server-side coding, ie PHP, ASP ... Prost Jan Web: www.barrierefreies-webdesign.de -----Urspr?ngliche  </s>
