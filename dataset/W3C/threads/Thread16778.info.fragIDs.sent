<s> Hello All: Can screen readesrs read inputted text that users insert into online forms?  </s>
<s> Specifically, once someone has entered information (personal, etc) into the form, hit "Submit" and had the form returned with a "You haven't filled out all of the required fields."  </s>
<s> Would the screen reader read both the field names and the text within the fields as the person scrolled through the form to determine what is missing?  </s>
<s> Anyone had experience with this?  </s>
<s> Thanks.  </s>

<s> This *usually* works the way you describe.  </s>
<s> I.e., screen readers can read text in the input fields, status of radio buttons, etc.  </s>
<s> The best way to handle form errors is a different topic.  </s>
<s> The coolest thing would be to get a page with only the error fields listed.  </s>
<s> In other words: "We're sorry, no data was entered in field(s) which is/are required for this form: Zip Code: _____ " This would be Much much more efficient for a screen reader user than having to hunt thru the entire form to try to figure out what went wrong.  </s>
<s> On the other hand I can think of situations where one might want to read the full form in context.  </s>
<s> For that situation, maybe the fields with errors could be marked with a unique (text) character or string.  </s>

<s> I think it is best to provide both the accelerated navigation through the problem spots and the chance to review the whole deal before committing to it.  </s>
<s> Things to look at in this regard would include TABINDEX and CLASS marks indicating the severity of exceptions thrown by the type checking.  </s>
<s> But it is also possible to do it in legacy friendly code with a tour built using explicit internal hyperlinks.  </s>
<s> The problem is that the kneejerk reaction would be to do this with color and icons.  </s>
<s> Even if this is done 'semantically' with severity classes, that doesn't make the hotspots navigable as a tour unless the classes are standardized (which they aren't).  </s>
<s> So until TABINDEX works better or we have some standard CLASSes for this, the simplest thing is to give a boiled-down form with just the problems, and be sure to offer [or always give] a confirmation copy with all the data reiterated as is after all checks passed.  </s>
<s> Either you have a liberal cancellation policy or you do the confirmation step before committing the transaction.  </s>
<s> There has to be a Conventional Wisdom on this in the eRetail industry, even if it isn't talked about.  </s>
<s> Yet another approach is that the form returned for the repairs has the fields that passed checking as document contents but not as form controls.  </s>
<s> This means that tabbing through the form controls will do the tour of the problem items and only those items.  </s>
<s> Of course, this means that you have to offer the user a DoIt submit button and a different MoreChanges submit button in the end.  </s>
<s> That's clunky for the visual user.  </s>
<s> Go figure.  </s>
<s> The problem Patrick posed is a good one.  </s>
<s> I don't presume to have the answer.  </s>
<s> But the above ideas give you a rough of the vicinity in which to look for a solution.  </s>
<s> Al  </s>
<s> Just a couple comments: What I'd like to experience is a list of the problem fields at the top of the returned page with each field name being an internal link to the problem field.  </s>
<s> Then I'd still like the full page to review.  </s>
<s> What I've found happens sometimnes is that I'm not careful and maybe enter all of my phone number in one edit box when the page actually wants it in three.  </s>
<s> And of course I didn't double check my entry before submitting.  </s>
<s> To me this is also an example where data input checking before submission can be of value.  </s>
<s> Alert the user before he or she has answered 10 questions only to find out that eight were done incorrectly.  </s>
