<s> I have done some benchmarking with Java HTML Tidy and Sun's Hotspot VM, and I thought I would share the results here.  </s>
<s> I used the program below to parse a number of documents by cycling through a list.  </s>
<s> In order to minimize the effect of runtime library code (ie.  </s>
<s> mostly file and standard output) I simply parsed each document without pretty-printing it.  </s>
<s> Also, I set the Errout stream to a CharArrayWriter and just threw away the results each time.  </s>
<s> I compared the Sun Hotspot 1.0.1 VM running with default settings with the Sun Classic VM with no JIT.  </s>
<s> The tests were conducted on a clunky Pentium Windows 95 machine.  </s>
<s> The results are very impressive, see the table below: No. of Classic Hotspot Percent Documents no JIT msec msec Improvement 10 2030 4880 -- 50 12250 14390 -- 100 22250 20100 10 500 110290 48330 56 1000 217010 70030 68  </s>
