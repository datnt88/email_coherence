<s> I think we should expect XML browsers quickly, but should not depend on XML editors....  </s>
<s> We might, however, get SGML editor vendors (most of whom are represented here, so correct me if I'm wrong) to add a "Save as XML" feature -- most of them are doing something close to that already, since they don't generally minimize on output (if you're writing out SGML from a grove-like internal  </s>
<s> representation, it's easier and maybe faster to write out all the tags than to calculate whether any particular one is omissable).  </s>
<s> Likewise, adding a "convert SGML to XML" filter to any existing SGML parser looks pretty easy to me (it involves stuff like escaping more delimiters, adding omitted markup, expanding shortrefs, etc -- a lot like the SGML normalizer grail).  </s>

<s> Speaking for one SGML editor vendor and guessing what XML might be given the state of our discussion, it looks to me like the difference between  </s>
<s> "save as XML" and what Adept (and many other SGML-aware editors) do right  </s>
<s> now are the things we won't allow in XML like declared content, maybe marked sections, etc.  </s>
<s> Put another way, if a user has a DTD with no declared content (and no mixed content, if we disallow that in XML) and uses it in Adept to create an SGML instance that doesn't have any marked sections, entities, whatever else isn't in XML, then what they'll get for output today sounds a lot like what we are saying XML will be.  </s>
<s> And if they do use marked sections and entities and stuff that's not in XML, then there is no way to "save as XML" without losing information.  </s>
<s> So, perhaps better than "save as XML" is an edit or validation mode "restrict to XML".  </s>
<s> Given a valid XML DTD, all this means is not allowing users to "declare marked sections" and "declare entities" so this wouldn't be difficult.  </s>

<s> It depends what you mean by "information".  </s>
<s> Certainly the information that something was in a marked section would be lost, but why can't you just output the contents of the included MS and refrain from outputing the whole ignored MS?  </s>
<s> I certainly expect XML editors to come about.  </s>
<s> I just don't think that we should design something that depends on them, because a) SGML editors are expensive (will XML editors be cheaper?) b) SGML editors are not nearly as widely deployed as text editors c) After two years (or so) of marketing HTML editors are probably still used by a minority of authors.  </s>
<s> d) Some people don't like SGML editors.  </s>

<s> Don't get me wrong.  </s>
<s> I use an SGML editor.  </s>
<s> I hardly ever edit SGML by hand.  </s>
<s> But I think that expecting most webmasters to change their tools overnight is overambitious.  </s>
<s> Once XML is popular as a hand-coded format, the hand-coders will have opportunity to learn the benefits of dedicated tools.  </s>
