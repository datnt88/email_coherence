<s> Hi Marja,  </s>
<s> Normally "Save As" lets you change charset and mime type.  </s>
<s> You have two buttons for that.  </s>
<s> Does it answer your question?  </s>

<s> For instance, if I originally save a document as UTF-8, then try save-as (or even save) again it does not give the default as UTF-8 but as ISO-8859-1.  </s>
<s> Same thing with the mime type, it does not get the defaults from the document.  </s>
<s> I have to guess what I might have chosen before because it is not possible to save it again with other values than the original ones to the same URI (I get an error).  </s>
