<s> Not for discussion this telecon, but here's my proposal on rdfs:ConstraintResource and rdfs:ConstraintProperty: we drop them from the specification.  </s>
<s> Context (last week's meeting): There is still some uncertainty about the constraint resources/properties issues, though many folks seem happy to lose these.  </s>
<s> ACTION: 2001-10-19#9, DanBri.  </s>
<s> Propose resolution of constraint resources for next week ACTION: 2001-10-19#10, DanBri.  </s>
<s> ditto for constraint properties Context (Issue list): My proposed closure: The intent behind the rdfs:ConstraintResource mechanism was to allow some future proofing of RDF Schema to anticipate extensions to the Schema spec that addressed some of the facilities the original WG dropped from 1.0.  </s>
<s> The DAML+OIL specification is an example of such an extension to RDFS.  </s>
<s> As such, it shows up a flaw in the rdfs:ConstraintResource concept.  </s>
<s> The notion of a 'constraint resource' confuses two ideas: the idea that some parts of an RDF Schema may be used by automated data validation tools, and the idea that the meaning of certain RDF properties and classes impose constraints on their usage.  </s>
<s> This confusion makes it unclear as to which new properties-of-properties should be considered "Constraint Resources", for example a class "rdfsx:TransitiveProperty".  </s>
<s> Various meaningful annotations on RDF properties _could_ be considered to describe constraints on their uses?  </s>
<s> Does that make them constraint resources?  </s>
<s> The answer is unclear, because the notion of constraintresource is itself confused.  </s>
<s> Proposal: the current mechanism, rdfs:ConstraintResource and rdfs:ConstraintProperty, fails to serve its original purpose and should be removed from the RDF Schema 1.0 specification.  </s>
<s> The accompanying text be amended accordingly.  </s>
<s> I wholeheartedly agree.  </s>

<s> excellent.  </s>
<s> Does anybody disagree?  </s>
<s> If so please let the WG mailing list know before our next teleconf.  </s>
<s> As one of the guilty parties behind the RDFS 1.0 spec, and this bit in particular, I have to say: we got rdfs:ConstraintResource *wrong*.  </s>
<s> (Sorry!) It was a nice idea, to try to give some categories for likely RDFS extensions so that 1.0 processors weren't _entirely_ suprised by future revisions of the spec.  </s>
<s> But the notion that schema language constructs were either 'constraining' or 'unconstraining' was incoherent.  </s>
<s> The idea of this all being used for data validation was, I think, taking up much more of our attention than it does now.  </s>
<s> Anyway, as I say: we goofed.  </s>
<s> Let's drop the feature and move on.  </s>
<s> Dan  </s>
<s> I agree Jos De Roo  </s>
