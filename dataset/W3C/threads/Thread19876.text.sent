How do I configure Alt or Meta key bindings to work? 
On my system, they work with Emacs and Netscape. 
According to the documentation in `/usr/local/Thot/doc/amaya/Configure.html' 
I should be able to specify `Ctrl', `Alt', or `Meta' as a Modifier in `/usr/local/Thot/config/amaya.keyboard'. 
I have done this, but the keys do not work. 
Here are my additions to amaya.keyboard: ## Alt key bindings Alt Key v:TtcPageUp() Alt Key r:Reload() Alt Key w:TtcCloseDocument() Alt Key x:AmayaClose() The Alt key bindings failed, but these bindings work: Ctrl Key x , Ctrl Key v: TtcPageUp() Ctrl Key x , Ctrl Key r:Reload() Ctrl Key x , Ctrl Key w:TtcCloseDocument() Ctrl Key x , Ctrl Key c:AmayaClose() And, also, how does one get Amaya to reread the amaya.keyboard 
without restarting a new Amaya? 
Thanks!

Emacs and Netscape don't take the system key binding into account, but Amaya yes. 
Perhaps on your machine the Alt key send a Meta keycode. 
The Meta key doesn't exist on PC keyboards and it's often mapped on the Alt key. 
See /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/XF86Config file and other key bindings defined by your current Window manager. 
The Amaya keyboard binding is executed after all these other key bindings and there is no guaranty that the defined bindings can be applied.

No success. 
Neither Alt nor Meta work. 
I uncommented the line in `/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/XF86Config' that says LeftAlt Meta without any effect. 
That was the only line among all the Xresources, xinit, etc files that seemed related. 
Do you have any other suggestions -- in particular, do you have a detailed suggestion of what I might put in a .Xresources 
file or in some other file? 
Thanks!

Hi bob, You're right. 
There are confusions between Alt, Meta and Compose keys. 
There is a piece of code in Amaya which considers that Alt is equivalent to Compose and try to provide stressed characters (characters not available on standard keyboards). 
So your Alt+r, Alt+v and Alt+w are dropped. 
I'm going to work on this piece of code to clarify the situation: - Meta and Alt_left should be equivalent - Compose and Alt_right should be equivalent Thanks for advice and best regards Irene In-reply-to: Your message of Mon, 30 Mar 1998 11:46:10 -0500."
