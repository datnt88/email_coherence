If you got a message coming from Irene with the following message: 
Don't open it. 
It's a virus. 
Must be some kind of worm because I've received it in other mailing lists too. 
In all cases, this message didn't come from Irene, but from someone in Korea. 
-jose 
actually I noticed such worms from a batch of addresses, with domains like vim.org and the like. 
It seems that the creator of the virus chose to use email addresses from well-known people... The worm itself should be a variation of the one shown ten days ago, which sent mail from "support@microsoft.com". 
ciao, .mau.
