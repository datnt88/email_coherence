<s> Aha, of course!  </s>

<s> #g Graham Klyne  </s>
<s> I think that even though they may be different lists (containing different graph nodes), if IR is closed under list construction and the given semantics for rdf:first, rdf:rest then each must entail the other -- by virtue always being true.  </s>
<s> Tricker, I think, is how one gets the expected entailments when a list is related to some other entity -- I guess the OWL folks will have to sort that one.  </s>
<s> #g Graham Klyne  </s>
<s> Ah, yes.  </s>
<s> The existence of one such list suffices for both graphs, if you always use bnodes.  </s>
<s> But you know, you don't HAVE to use bnodes.  </s>
<s> Maybe ex:Pat rdf:first :a .  </s>
<s> for all I know.  </s>
<s> Damn right.  </s>

<s> By being different.  </s>
<s> I don't know quite how else to say it.  </s>
<s> That is, the sequences (of 'firsts') will be the same, but the lists could still be different.  </s>
<s> And that makes sense, because for example they might have other properties, such as who made them; or suppose they are lists of people in a building at some time.  </s>
<s> Could have same members but still be distinct.  </s>

<s> Well, yes.  </s>
<s> That's a structure I find myself using quite a lot (effectively, indicating a list by identifying its head node).  </s>
<s> Isn't that just a particular case of relating a list to another entity?  </s>
