Here's the ID that I just submitted to the IETF under the name draft-frystyk-http-mandatory I have also made it available as "http://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/ietf-http-ext/draft-frystyk-http-mandatory -00.txt" so that we at least can point to it. 
Henrik Henrik Frystyk Nielsen, World Wide Web Consortium Sorry - WRONG LIST :( I should have sent it to ietf-http-ext@w3.org - sorry for the trouble. 
PLEASE DO NOT SEND ANY COMMENTS ABOUT THIS DRAFT TO THIS LIST! Henrik Henrik Frystyk Nielsen, World Wide Web Consortium Why does this spec insist on being more than one paragraph long? 
All we need is a "Mandatory" header followed by the names of header fields that MUST be understood. 
That is it. 
No fancy namespaces, no extensions, NOTHING. 
Now if you want to add those fancy features, fine, define a "fancy-features" header and PUT ITS NAME IN MANDATORY. 
While we are at it, what happened to the section on changing method names to "PEP-*"? 
We need this if we are ever going to deploy. 
All this having been said I want to congratulate Henrik et all on really paring down the spec. 
It is much better than before. 
With just a little more cutting we will finally have something we can deploy.
