<s> This (favicon.ico) is way off topic for both the www-dom or www-html mailing lists, it's not against any standards, how browsers deal with icons has nothing to do with any standard, especiall not any W3C standards.  </s>
<s> Again, off topic.  </s>
<s> jst  </s>
<s> ok, but as discussion thread is continuing already for the 3rd day, we should "fix" the list where this thread should go.  </s>
<s> Let me give you my opinion on this [favicon].  </s>
<s> I think this question is somewhat related to "scrollbars" discussion which happened on www-style list some time ago.  </s>
<s> It was touching more fundamental question: *How User Interface should be defined (scripted, controlled) on user's computer/OS*?  </s>
<s> CSS3 has User Interface module, which is in my opinion is quite interesting (and promising) but needs enhancement.  </s>
<s> If we, say, agreed, that User Interface semantics should be defined in _XML_, and styled later in _CSS_ - than answer is clear, further discussion of "favicon" should go to www-style list.  </s>
<s> BTW it's pretty much inline with the way Bookmarks are defined in Konqueror and Mozilla (using XML - XBEL , IIRC).  </s>
<s> Each bookmark has "favicon" stored in browser's cache - on "per page" basis.  </s>
<s> This favicon is displayed (in KDE/Konqueror): 1) in Window Title bar - as Winodw's Menu opener button 2) in Konqueror's Location bar -- so typing in some URL you automatically get Favicon of that site and can see wether you launched right site or not.  </s>
<s> 3) in Kicker (Panel) on bottom/top of the screen - next to window's/application name as you see, one icon is displayd in 3 different places.  </s>
<s> So it seems to me as really "presentational" issue, so it should (and can) be defined via CSS.  </s>
<s> I guess we need either to extend User Interface module further (to support Scrollbars, Titlebars, window's menues, etc.) or add new module to CSS3, let's call it Desktop module.  </s>
<s> Than you can create some element on Desktop via DOM method (createElement), and apply some style to it using scripting and/or CSS.  </s>
<s> like: JS code // get list of open browser's windows brs = desktop.getElementsByAppName("browser");  </s>
<s> w = brs[0].window;  </s>
<s> // window element of first open Browser window // get TitleBar of that window tb = w.getElementById("titleBar"); mbut = tb.getElementById("menuButton"); if (mbut.style.visibility="visible")  </s>
<s> // if menuButton is visible (enabled) on titleBar // add Favicon to it mbut.style.background="url('myfavicon.png')"  </s>
<s> So you can easily add Aureal icons/notifications in such cases as well.  </s>
<s> What's also interesting - there is no need to transfer images (GIF, PNG) as FavIcon - you can define some piece of XML with CSS formatting, or put SVG picture inside.  </s>
<s> Sound like very cool technology :-)  </s>

<s> Any information that should be secured (passwords, etc) shouldn't be put in the URI of a document.  </s>
<s> As for passwords to servers, such as ftp://user:pass@blah, the user agent can strip the user:pass part of the URI.  </s>
<s> I could see many uses for this ability.  </s>
<s> For instance...  </s>
<s> An embedding application could show information like stocks, etc while you are browsing.  </s>
<s> A web page could do the same thing in a frame while you are browsing in another frame.  </s>
<s> It could then show in a textarea where you are and you could even enter new URIs in the textarea and press Go, etc.  </s>
<s> If you think it's too much of a security risk to be able to do this, then what about being able to use the src attribute of the frame indirectly, such as copying it to a textarea, etc - but not being able to record it?  </s>
<s> When you write to the textarea, the textarea could be marked as no longer readable by the page until its cleared.  </s>
