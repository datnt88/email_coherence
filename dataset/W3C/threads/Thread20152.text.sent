The online help doesn't provide enough help for this: What is the precise format for specifying a remote (dial-up/ppp to ISP) file name to open, edit, and then save to? 
I can specify "http://www.sihope.com/~emaddox" to load my web page. 
I then edit it and save it to a _local_ file using "Save as...". 
But, I cannot figure out how to specify a remote file name to edit and/or save to directly. 
So far all I get is *** Thot: Irrecoverable error ***.

I have been reading some of the manual. 
Not much help. 
But, the error messages now are: "404 Not Found The requested URL /usr/home/[...].html was not found on this server." - Is the server refered to the Local machine (where I am running Amaya) or the Remote ISP machine? 
- Why does the error message omit the "http://www.sihope.com" 
portion of the path even though I did include it?

You need to have a server that supports the PUT method. 
In that case the "Save" or "SaveAs" commands should work with an URL Irene. 
The remote web server machine, which may be owned by the content provider or even on the content provider's premises. 
Because it is not transmitted in the HTTP request (at least for HTTP/1.0), as the destination server already knows its own name (actually some sorts of virtual server require this information, but it is sent separately from the URL, e.g.: GET /xxxxxx HTTP/1.1 Host: www.sihope.com but only relatively recent clients and servers use and understand Host headers.

Amaya is able to load local files and remote files (http://....) Amaya doesn't add a default server name if you omit to put it into the URI. 
Irene. 
^^^^^^^^^^^ is not "precise". 
^^^^ wrong. 
URI. 
You need to have a server that supports the PUT method. 
In that case the "Save" or "SaveAs" commands should work with an URL ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ a little more "precise", but still vague. 
And, first, Open doesn't yet work with exact path. 
It returns "404 Not Found", remember? 
Do some servers not support the GET method either? 
New development: I telnetted to my ISP. 
Started Lynx. 
Pressed "g". 
Entered: http://localhost/usr/home/....html. 
Got: 404 Not Found. 
Changed "http" to "file": file is displayed correctly. 
So even from my ISP's machine, with a different browser, I get the same error. 
I called my ISP. 
The tech is looking into what the precise format is that the http GET requires for specifying the precise path. 
Does the Amaya team know what precise format http GET expects so it _will_ find the file? 
Is it documented in an RFC or such? 
Or is there a different problem here? 
Or what?
