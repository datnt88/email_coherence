Hello Paul [note that I've taken this thread off the Working group mailing list onto the Interest group mailing list, since it's not merely technical at that point - this message is being sent to both lists, to bridge in the discussion, but I'd prefer people to only send their replies to the IG one - Thanks] I'm really interested in this thread. 
Will all of our research dollars be funneled into screen readers? 
No. Captioning of web audio and video for instance doesn't fall in that category. 
Is the WAI working group aware of the breadth of the problem facing the disabled as a whole when 'they' collective try to logon? 
The WAI working group is just starting, so the answer is probably no. 
We're in the early phase of requirements collection, and even for the visual area, where we have the most experience, we start realizing it isn't a trivial exercice. 
I do not know. 
However, I do know that the dev-access list, the basr list, and Trace in general all seem to focus their attention on vision impaired users. 
I can't speak for Trace or others, but regarding WAI, I've been looking for months for requirements on the technical work from disability groups other than visual and hearing impaired. 
I talked with research teams doing state of art eye-movement technology for Internet access (INSERM), to end-user like Gianni Pellis, who was at our first meeting last week and can only use his voice or head movement to communicate, and to other disability organizations not focused on visual or hearing impairements. 
Regarding mobility issues, I haven't gotten any requirement or feedback on the Web formats and protocols. 
Of course, there are clearly requirements on the platform itself (say Win95, or Mac) in terms of input devices (keys, mice and other mikes) or other accessibility features but this is not what we're working on right now. 
So here's my request again: in terms of what W3C is doing: HTML, XML, CSS (style sheets), HTTP, and other pieces that are part of the Web interoperability framework (things that get exchanged between providers and consumers of information), what needs to be changed to provide better accessibility to, and I quote you, "'other' disabled people- spinal cord injured, cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis, ALS, stroke, traumatic brain injured, etc-". 
Hello Paul, Daniel, You both raise the question as to why it is harder to find information on physical and cognitive disability. 
Most of what you find is on Vision and Hearing. 
Some of the lists cited are specifically for Screen readers (e.g. BASR-L = Browsers and Screen Readers) so they will be focused on screen reading issues. 
Others are more general but do have a lot of traffic on visual disabilities. 
Below are some of the reasons why recent web focus has been on visual and hearing issues... ... followed by some resources you might check on for cross disability access issues and recommendations. 
REASONS YOU MOSTLY SEE VISION AND HEARING. 
- most of the discussion has been on how to design web pages. 
Web page design is a SOURCE MATERIAL issue. 
The major issues around SOURCE MATERIALS are whether they can be presented or display or perceived by the recipients. 
Hence, the focus on hearing and vision. 
- since most of the pages to date have been silent - the most focus has been on VISION and access by those who have low vision or blindness. 
- as sound is added to pages, the issues of captioning and access by people who are hard of hearing and or deaf has arisen - and is getting more attention. 
- people with physical disabilities have not had much problem with access to SOURCE MATERIALS in the past. 
The problems they have had has been with BROWSERS (or VIEWER/CONTROLLERS). 
Thus they have not shown up much in the HTML guidelines. 
They do show up in browser guidelines. 
- when you create browsers that are keyboard accessible so that they are easy to use by people who are blind - you also make them more accessible by people with physical disabilities who cannot use the mouse well, or are using an assistive device or alternative keyboard (both of which appear to the computer as the standard keyboard). 
Thus by the time you have solved the issues around blindness - you have also solve many (not all) of the issues around physical disability, including the most important (keyboard access). 
- many of the other physical disability issues are addressed through adaptations that have been added to MacOS, OS/2 and Windows 95/NT. 
- cognitive is always an interesting area. 
Most everything you do for people with cognitive disabilities ends up benefiting most users. 
As a result, many of the cog issue recommendations are the same as for good design of web pages in general. 
- an issue with cognitive recommendations that go further is that it is often difficult to suggest to web designers that they should change the content of their sites (beyond that which does not remove information - just present it more simply). 
- more is clearly needed on good web design though to decrease the cognitive load necessary to understand web sites (For Everyone). 
- As we get into applets and other SOURCE DEFINED USER INTERFACES we are also creating new barriers for people with physical disabilities. 
It is good to see a balanced interest across disabilities. 
It is only through coordinated cross disability access that we will create useable accessible public systems. 
SOME SOURCES OF INFORMATION ON ACCESS BY PEOPLE OTHER THAN VISION AND HEARING. 
THE PRINCIPLES OF UNIVERSAL DESIGN Guidelines for the design of consumer products to increase their accessibility to persons with disabilities or who are aging Considerations in the Design of Computers to Increase Their Accessibility by Persons with Disabilities Application Software Design Guidelines For CROSS DISABILITY access see also the work being done on kiosks which are accessible to people who have low vision, blindness, who are hard of hearing or deaf, who have reading problems or cannot read, have physical disabilities, are completely paralyzed or are deaf-blind. 
(the systems are now commercially deployed and function exactly like all other touch screen kiosks if you do not have a disability).

Thanks Gregg for the clear analysis of the situation. 
Agreed. 
When we get to work user-agent guidelines, this will show up. 
I was only referring to our work on format/protocol for now. 
I haven't yet thought about how to, or if we want to, separate the user-agent/browser guidelines from the more generic GUI access guidelines. 
Browsers are fastly becoming THE interface of choice on the desktop (see Win98) and an issue of scope will need to be raised when we get to work on that. 
Daniel Both you and Al raise the question as to whether we should have separate guidelines or not. 
In the other list I just mentioned (as you did) that the two will converge and that (with applets and all) you will download you viewer from your source as often as not in the future. 
I think we should work on some general comprehensive guidelines that start functional and then show how the requirements need to be implemented at all levels. 
We should also show how the requirements are not specific to disability and relate to low bandwidth connections, audio access (e.g. driving car etc), and agent access. 
A lot of work but we an borrow it wherever possible.

From Paul's recent message: In Greg's recent e-mail to both of us he makes a point that for the nonblind or nonhearing disabled population it is the browser and hardware which need modification rather than the source code (html, xml, css,etc). 
This strikes me as true. 
Most of the disabilities that I see are motor or cognitive imparements, sometimes involving partial or temporary loss of one of the senses, ie vision, touch, etc. 
Consequently, with respect to your questions about how the W3C can modify css, xml, html, etc to suit the disabled as a whole- rather than subpopulations of disable- the answer may be that you can not. 
I don't think you should assume that people interested in vision impairments are only interested in the source problems. 
Our group at Arkenstone is actually more concerned about providing usable browsers to our typical reading machine user (blind, low vision, dyslexic) who wants access to the information on the Web because optical character recognition is tough on newspapers. 
They can't begin to use the existing solutions, which are aimed at sophisticated blind computer users (and still manage to frustrate them, albeit often on source problems). 
We expect to work on simplified user interfaces and supporting these users, and looking to the Web community to deliver greater accessibility in the source material. 
The WAI process is definitely focused more on the source issues than on serving and supporting individuals with disabilities directly. 
The Web fosters a "if we build it, they will come" attitude, which is true of only a fraction of the people with disabilities who need these capabilities even more than their nondisabled colleagues who have other options to get access to much of the information on the Web. 
Still, there's absolutely no doubt in my mind that the work being contemplated in the WAI process so far is a prerequisite to any effort in this field. 
We can address the issues of getting this technology into the hands of more of the people who need it, when the technology has more of the hooks that it needs to support them, and source developers have an easy way of supporting those hooks.

President Arkenstone, Inc. 555 Oakmead Parkway 1-800-444-4443 Sunnyvale, CA 94086 USA 1-408-245-5900 Jim, Thank you for your mail. 
I appreciate your interest in web access for the vision impaired user. 
The reason I have not responded to your mail in the past was that your signature file made it unclear to me what your association with the WAI was. 
When I see a company website referenced in a signature file I become concerned about commercial interests being involved and potential conflicts of interest. 
However, you are clearly on the WAI mailing list because the mail you quote below was not intentionally sent to you. 
(However, I have no issue with your receiving it.) With respect to getting the technology into the hands of the users who need it: there are many, many reasons for the motor impaired to access the web now. 
As more and more commerce goes on line- Seattle Sidewalk, Peapod, Amazon, etc- life will become much easier for people with severe motor disabilities. 
The current work being done by the WAI is not a pre- requisite to access for this population. 
This isn't to say that the work for the vision and hearing impaired isn't worth while. 
My point is that different groups of disabled people have different web access needs. 
To suggest that work for the vision impaired is a prerequisite to, or directly portable to, work for other groups of disabled is inaccurate. 
Thank you for your input. 
In Greg's recent e-mail to both of us he makes a point that for the nonblind or nonhearing disabled population it is the browser and hardware which need modification rather than the source code (html, xml, css,etc).

Physiatry Forum : I don't think you should assume that people interested in vision impairments are only interested in the source problems. 
[GV } absolutely. 
People with all disabilities have access issues at the browser / viewer end. 
Couple of additional thoughts. 
- Source documents used to only be a problem for people with sensory and cognitive disabilities. 
- Now that we are including user interface issues in source materials (e.g. Java applets et al) we are making source materials a problem for people with all disabilities. 
- Moreover, solutions in the browser (e.g. if we have an accessible browser) are not enough if the source materials (including the applets) are not accessible as well. 
- This is just more evidence for not treating them as separate entities in discussion accessibility. 
Gregg Gregg C Vanderheiden Your mail has been forwarded to Phill Jenkins/Austin/IBM @ IBMUS. 
Please make a note of this new address for future correspondence. 
If sending from VM, direct your mail to PJENKINS at IBMUSM26. 
For many of the problems associated with WWW access many of the problems can be solved and probably can only solved on the browser side. 
I guess we're boiling down to saying that Source and User-agent side are equally important. 
We plan to adress both in the WAI. 
My personal take on that is that Source is the *enabling* part while the user-agent work is the *delivering* part. 
Whatever that means :-) It's on our agenda for the Boston meeting (Tuesday August 5th) which is going to be focused on guidelines (all kind). 
For information on some of the features of a browser based on UD principles see the page at: Thanks for the pointer, I'll attach them to the agenda. 
(I already knew your work Jon, and I hope you are going to be able to participate in the WAI). 
Does the W3C have influence with major browser developers like Netscape or Microsoft over user interface design issues? 
We hope to think so! 
They are both members. 
I believe I am only on w3c-wai-ig (as an invited expert) so I guess I missed the details of the upcoming Boston meeting. 
If I want to come, then should I be added to the wg list? 
Could you send me the details? 
I do not see them on the web site (proably behind the W3C memebr wall). 
For Keith and others, I haven't sent out the official announcement with agenda for the next WAI tech meeting. 
I just talked about the date so that people can mark the date on their calendar. 
Sometimes in June. 
Did I miss the minutes from the 22 May conclave? 
I am treading water a bit until I have a better sense of that meeting. 
For my needs, a simple list of action items and of attendees is most of what I want. 
More extensive reporting of the discussion is interesting, but not necessarily worth delaying the basics. 
Al Gilman No, we're working on putting all that together. 
Maybe tomorrow. 
For many of the problems associated with WWW access many of the problems can be solved and probably can only solved on the browser side. 
I think a key area for the W3C is to develop browser guidelines and demonstrate/verify what types of browser based solutions work for people with disabilities. 
I think the guidelines need to be based on universal design (UD) principles, which extend the capabilities of current browser technologies. 
Additional controls and views need to be a part of current browsers. 
For information on some of the features of a browser based on UD principles see the page at: Here at UIUC we are working on developing a prototype accessible browser and a demo version should be available in July to handle HTML 3.2: Does the W3C have influence with major browser developers like Netscape or Microsoft over user interface design issues?
