<s> I have just built Amaya 2.0a from sources on Solaris 2.5.1, with GCC, and gmake.  </s>
<s> Installation: The build went fine The install failed in the directory obj/amaya because it could not find ../install.sh.  </s>
<s> gmake[2]: Entering directory `/home/hgs/AMAYA/Amaya/obj/tablelib' gmake[2]: Nothing to be done for `libThotTable'.  </s>
<s> gmake[2]: Leaving directory `/home/hgs/AMAYA/Amaya/obj/tablelib' ../install-sh -c -m 755 ../bin/amaya /usr/local/Amaya/applis/bin  </s>
<s> gmake[1]: ../install-sh: Command not found gmake[1]: *** [install] Error 127 gmake[1]: Leaving directory `/home/hgs/AMAYA/Amaya/obj/amaya' I copied Amaya/install.sh to Amaya/obj/install.sh and all went well.  </s>
<s> Usage: The first thing I did was set the colours and fonts.  </s>
<s> I noticed that the max font size is 20 points for the menu fonts.  </s>
<s> I was hoping to use 24 points.  </s>
<s> I set the foreground colour to White, and the background to Black.  </s>
<s> This worked fine for the page about configuring Amaya.  </s>
<s> Starting a New Amaya gave me the doc: /usr/local/Amaya/amaya/AmayaPage.html which then came up with white text on a white background.  </s>
<s> I can, as yet, see no way to force an override on this, as per:  </s>
<s> The alternative text popups for the buttons has come up as a creamy colour (my default X foreground colour I think) on yellow.  </s>
<s> Also the font is small.  </s>
<s> These are therefore illegible to me.  </s>
<s> I cannot see where to set these colour parameters.  </s>
<s> The Configuring Amaya page, off the help menu, makes no refereces to editing particular values in files.  </s>
<s> This would work around things not being on the preferences menus.  </s>
<s> Also, there are variables in thot.rc  </s>
<s> which are could benefit from explanation.  </s>
<s> For example, what sort of value should "ReduceColor=" take (a string, a number, ...)?  </s>
<s> Apart from that, this is a big improvement over the last version I had.  </s>
<s> Two (more) suggestions: When you navigate to a link within a document (i.e a fragment denoted by #name) I think the main browser display should reflect this named reference somewhere.  </s>
<s> Netscape does it in the URL, but I can see reasons for not doing this in that particular box.  </s>
<s> In the Geometry preferences, would it be possible to adjust the scrollbar thicknes, and the size of the end "arrows" for up and down movement?  </s>
<s> This would make them easier to target with a mouse if they were bigger for example.  </s>
<s> Thank you, Hugh hgs@dmu.ac.uk  </s>
<s> I had the same problem, strangely it did happen on Solaris but it did not happen on HPUX: on HPUX it finds an install in /opt/imake/bin/.  </s>
<s> I think this is because ../configure finds install in ../install.  </s>
<s> I edited Options.orig after ../configure and changed every relative (../) directory to the absolute directory, this helps too.  </s>
<s> CB The nice thing about standards is that there are so many of them to choose from.  </s>

<s> I guess the problem comes from the configure.  </s>
<s> Could you check your file Options?  </s>
<s> Mine defines: INSTALL = /usr/local/gnu/bin/install -c  </s>
<s> You're right.  </s>
<s> There is a bug in the page AmayaPage.html  </s>
<s> These colors are controlled by the "Menu foreground color" and "Menu background color".  </s>
<s> "Yes or No", but that is only useful for limited screen less than 256 colors.  </s>
<s> Amaya reflects the URL where the document is located instead of the current target position.  </s>
<s> I apologize but I don't think we'll do that in near future.  </s>
<s> Irene.  </s>
<s> As an accessibility issue, it would be good if the scrollbar can be accessed from the keyboard.  </s>
<s> One approach would be to allow ctrl-tab or something to move between the button bar, the scrollbars, the address and title sections, an the main document.  </s>
<s> At the moment this is only possible with a mouse.  </s>
<s> Charles  </s>
<s> I apologize but I don't think we'll do that in near future.  </s>
<s> Good point.  </s>
<s> That would work around the difficulty of mouse placement for me, too.  </s>
<s> Hugh hgs@dmu.ac.uk  </s>
<s> Mine has: INSTALL = ./install-sh  </s>
<s> -c  </s>
<s> That would fix it for that page, but there are many similarly buggy pages on the net.  </s>
<s> Could we have an option to override the (fore|back)ground colours on a page, please?  </s>
<s> Those are set to White and Black respectively.  </s>
<s> the colour of the menu at the top is correct, and the menu popups, but not the popups on the buttons (for "stop", "back", "forward"...).  </s>
<s> Thanks, but that was just an illustrative case :-)  </s>
<s> which is what I meant about not doing this in that particular box, so somewhere else nearby, perhaps?  </s>
<s> No rush, but if it could be done it would help.  </s>
<s> Thank you.  </s>
<s> Thank you, Hugh  </s>
