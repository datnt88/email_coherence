The Amaya team is proud to announce the availability of the 2.0a release of the Amaya editor/browser for both Unix and Windows platforms. 
Binaries are available at: Source is available at: A FAQ is available at http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/FAQ.html The Amaya release 2.0 is a major release and includes many new features. 
Some of these features may have fragilized the code. 
Some users reported annoying bugs that we didn't detected before due to the large variety of user platforms. 
The release 2.0a fixes the most important reported bugs. 
We plan to do a new release in June, so if you detect other bugs, please report them to our mailing list www-amaya@w3.org.

I have just built Amaya 2.0a from sources on Solaris 2.5.1, with GCC, and gmake. 
Installation: The build went fine The install failed in the directory obj/amaya because it could not find ../install.sh. 
gmake[2]: Entering directory `/home/hgs/AMAYA/Amaya/obj/tablelib' gmake[2]: Nothing to be done for `libThotTable'. 
gmake[2]: Leaving directory `/home/hgs/AMAYA/Amaya/obj/tablelib' ../install-sh -c -m 755 ../bin/amaya /usr/local/Amaya/applis/bin 
gmake[1]: ../install-sh: Command not found gmake[1]: *** [install] Error 127 gmake[1]: Leaving directory `/home/hgs/AMAYA/Amaya/obj/amaya' I copied Amaya/install.sh to Amaya/obj/install.sh and all went well. 
Usage: The first thing I did was set the colours and fonts. 
I noticed that the max font size is 20 points for the menu fonts. 
I was hoping to use 24 points. 
I set the foreground colour to White, and the background to Black. 
This worked fine for the page about configuring Amaya. 
Starting a New Amaya gave me the doc: /usr/local/Amaya/amaya/AmayaPage.html which then came up with white text on a white background. 
I can, as yet, see no way to force an override on this, as per: 
The alternative text popups for the buttons has come up as a creamy colour (my default X foreground colour I think) on yellow. 
Also the font is small. 
These are therefore illegible to me. 
I cannot see where to set these colour parameters. 
The Configuring Amaya page, off the help menu, makes no refereces to editing particular values in files. 
This would work around things not being on the preferences menus. 
Also, there are variables in thot.rc 
which are could benefit from explanation. 
For example, what sort of value should "ReduceColor=" take (a string, a number, ...)? 
Apart from that, this is a big improvement over the last version I had. 
Two (more) suggestions: When you navigate to a link within a document (i.e a fragment denoted by #name) I think the main browser display should reflect this named reference somewhere. 
Netscape does it in the URL, but I can see reasons for not doing this in that particular box. 
In the Geometry preferences, would it be possible to adjust the scrollbar thicknes, and the size of the end "arrows" for up and down movement? 
This would make them easier to target with a mouse if they were bigger for example. 
Thank you, Hugh hgs@dmu.ac.uk 
I had the same problem, strangely it did happen on Solaris but it did not happen on HPUX: on HPUX it finds an install in /opt/imake/bin/. 
I think this is because ../configure finds install in ../install. 
I edited Options.orig after ../configure and changed every relative (../) directory to the absolute directory, this helps too. 
CB The nice thing about standards is that there are so many of them to choose from.

I guess the problem comes from the configure. 
Could you check your file Options? 
Mine defines: INSTALL = /usr/local/gnu/bin/install -c 
You're right. 
There is a bug in the page AmayaPage.html 
These colors are controlled by the "Menu foreground color" and "Menu background color". 
"Yes or No", but that is only useful for limited screen less than 256 colors. 
Amaya reflects the URL where the document is located instead of the current target position. 
I apologize but I don't think we'll do that in near future. 
Irene. 
As an accessibility issue, it would be good if the scrollbar can be accessed from the keyboard. 
One approach would be to allow ctrl-tab or something to move between the button bar, the scrollbars, the address and title sections, an the main document. 
At the moment this is only possible with a mouse.

I apologize but I don't think we'll do that in near future. 
Good point. 
That would work around the difficulty of mouse placement for me, too. 
Hugh hgs@dmu.ac.uk 
Mine has: INSTALL = ./install-sh 
-c 
That would fix it for that page, but there are many similarly buggy pages on the net. 
Could we have an option to override the (fore|back)ground colours on a page, please? 
Those are set to White and Black respectively. 
the colour of the menu at the top is correct, and the menu popups, but not the popups on the buttons (for "stop", "back", "forward"...). 
Thanks, but that was just an illustrative case :-) 
which is what I meant about not doing this in that particular box, so somewhere else nearby, perhaps? 
No rush, but if it could be done it would help. 
Thank you. 
Thank you, Hugh
