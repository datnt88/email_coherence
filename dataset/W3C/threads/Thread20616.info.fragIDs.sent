<s> Hello, I had a look at amaya 4.2.1, looks very nice, but here are some points: 1) No support for frames.  </s>
<s> This doesn't bode well these days.  </s>
<s> Yes I can't stand them either, but do need to look at them.  </s>
<s> 2) The loading if images can't be turned off.  </s>
<s> Very bad.  </s>
<s> I am not willing to pay for all the graphics crap many sites put on their stuff.  </s>
<s> 3) It's impossible to access links derived from coordinates over an image.  </s>
<s> This is also common these days; amaya fails dismally.  </s>
<s> These links don't show up in the link view either.  </s>
<s> See www.canterbury.ac.nz for an example.  </s>
<s> 4) Why do numerous libraries (jpeg, z, ...) have to be statically linked?  </s>
<s> GNU autoconf is a marvellous tool!  </s>
<s> (At 110M compiling it broke -  </s>
<s> disk full.  </s>
<s> Had to shift somewhere else.  </s>
<s> All that for a 2M binary - this has to be the highest ratio I've seen yet...)  </s>
<s> 5) When entering a URL, I still have to type the "http://".  </s>
<s> This is majorly dumb as well as antiquated.  </s>
<s> I don't like software forcing me to waste my time.  </s>
<s> I don't care whether it's in any www standard or not.  </s>
<s> Political correctness only makes annoying software.  </s>
<s> 6) The editing in both the browser view and the html view is absolutely outstanding!!!!!!  </s>
<s> 7) If you made the little Help- About Amaya dialog window selectable, I could paste your email address.  </s>

<s> This is on our TODO list.  </s>
<s> I guess the introduction of SVG generated the problem.  </s>
<s> We'll check.  </s>
<s> It's for platforms that have no pre-installed libraries or in the case where available libraries are incompatible.  </s>
<s> You can configure and build with your own libraries.  </s>
<s> To avoid to enter file:// when you are loading a local file it needs to check the local file system first then access the network.  </s>
<s> We didn't spend time on this feature but if any external contributor can contribute there.  </s>
<s> Any volunteer?  </s>
<s> This is a limitation of the used widget.  </s>
<s> Probably the best would be to send a message when clicking on the mail address.  </s>
<s> Who knows how to do that?  </s>
<s> Irene.  </s>
<s> With Perl you can chose what gets linked dynamically when built.  </s>
<s> Perl does not use autoconf to create configure.  </s>
<s> I think it uses metaconf.  </s>
<s> Ruby uses autoconf, and it gives you the choice of static and dynamic linking also.  </s>
<s> FYI but OT admittedly: for those who want to know about Ruby.  </s>

<s> This would make a big difference to how useful Amaya is to me - There are a number of times when I have decided not to use it directly, but use Lynx to get a text-only copy of a document, becuase I don't have the time to wait for downloads (over a cellphone they are VERY expensive).  </s>
<s> I guess the introduction of SVG generated the problem.  </s>
<s> We'll check.  </s>
<s> In fact the areaas are still available, as you can see if you select View - Map Areas from the menus.  </s>
<s> But there is a bug so that the geometry doesn't put them in the right place.  </s>
<s> This means they are pretty hard to use...  </s>

<s> This is eventually just a user preferences question.  </s>
<s> It would of course be  </s>
<s> handy if you could choose where it looked by default - I find it very handy that it works in my filesystem, but that is becuase I use it a lot to edit in my file system.  </s>
<s> I think a smarter thing to do would be to run jigsaw, and get it to look in http://localhost/ by default, but that still means I need to be able to set preferences.  </s>
<s> And I don't have much time to volunteer right now (sigh) Charles McCN  </s>
<s> Thanks to all those who cc'd me a copy - if this goes to a mailing list I'm not on it.  </s>
<s> Also, as I pointed out, the high profile sites that have been around a long time have almost unanimously eliminated  </s>

<s> You are not in touch with reality :-) There are few sites not using frames.  </s>
<s> I don't frequent e-business sites.  </s>
<s> Ok, let's settle on 50-50?  </s>
<s> That makes amaya useless for half of the web.  </s>
<s> Not good.  </s>
<s> (PS I don't care about politics.  </s>
<s> If *nix wants to cut it on the desktop, ...)  </s>
<s> Is there any browser besides amaya which doesn't deal in frames?  </s>
<s> Frames cause lots of problems for the web model, e.g. standard  </s>
<s> I never denied they're a PITA.  </s>
<s> However, they are reality.  </s>
<s> Checking the local file system is considerably faster than checking the web.  </s>
<s> Also, with all this security stuff coming up, it's much safer too.  </s>
<s> Chances that there is a file called ./www.myfancysite.bull/somedir/somefile  </s>
<s> on my disk are practically zero.  </s>
<s> I dislike software accessing the net by default.  </s>
<s> Personally I'd say that's a waste of time.  </s>
<s> Chances of conlficts here are so small that I'd be quite prepared to type the http:// in those cases, but this is a minor issue.  </s>

<s> [DJW:] Firstly, Amaya is an editor for creating valid CSS formatted HTML, not primarily a browser.  </s>
<s> Secondly Lynx (and, I suspect, a couple of other text only browsers) don't support frames.  </s>
<s> html2ps (a printer medium browser, used to create the PDF version of the HTML specification) doesn't.  </s>
<s> WebTV converts frames into tables (I suspect in the gateway - i.e. the actual browser doesn't support them).  </s>
<s> You are not in touch with reality :-) There are few sites not using frames.  </s>

<s> Ok, let's settle on 50-50?  </s>
<s> That makes amaya useless for half of the web.  </s>
<s> Not good.  </s>
<s> [DJW:] Half may well be true, but for it to fail on frames sites, the sites have also got to violate basic accessibility rules and not provide a sensible fallback mechanism (please "upgrade" is not a sensisble fallback).  </s>
<s> As well as the original mechanism, noframes , you can use sensible frame names (not left and right) and use titles on the frames.  </s>
<s> The problem is that few frames sites do things properly - however Amaya's job is to help people do things properly, not really to let them cope with bad design.  </s>
<s> If you want a stable browser capable of handling most current HTML abuses, you should use IE5.  </s>
<s> If you want open source, and can tolerate some instability, you should use the Mozilla series.  </s>
<s> You may get slightly more commercial web support with Netscape's build of these, but people report that it is better to track the latest open source version.  </s>
