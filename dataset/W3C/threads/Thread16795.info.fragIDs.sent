<s> ROFLOL. OK, that's just pathetic.:-)  </s>
<s> Then again, it's probably designed for sighted pwoplw who otherwise don't have a clue about accessibility (EG, FedGov webmasters).  </s>
<s> Y'know what was disturbing, though?  </s>
<s> Whilst fiddling with a demo copy of JAWS, I headed over to the Army Digital Training and Doctrine Library (ADTDL) at www.adtdl.army.mil.  </s>
<s> It's designed for current soldiers.  </s>
<s> Training and such....In other words, not for the general public, and definitely not the blind.  </s>
<s> It was close to the most accessible sight I've seen yet.  </s>
<s> That scares me.  </s>
<s> For the record, Army National Guard recruiting has THE most accessible site among the military/DOD that I've found yet; They speak some pages by default; Others, nothing.  </s>
<s> Which brings up the question: WHY?  </s>
<s> These sites are not designed in any way to have use to those besides those already either in service or qualified for it.  </s>
<s> Kinda curious, considering HHS (lead agency for the disabled) had largely inaccessible sites from what I saw.  </s>
