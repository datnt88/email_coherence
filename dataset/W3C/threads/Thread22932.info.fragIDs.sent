<s> is attrChange going to be added to the parameters of initMutationEvent?  </s>
<s> Thanks -John  </s>
<s> I don't see any mention of that name in the Events chapter, so presumably it isn't a DOM Level 2 feature.  </s>
<s> Do you mean the DOMAttrModified event?  </s>
<s> Joe Kesselman / IBM Research  </s>
<s> Ooops. Mea culpa; I forgot that the attrchange field was added as part of the most recent tweak.  </s>
<s> (More precisely, I forgot what name we had given it, and I was looking at an outdated copy of the spec.) It's a read-only field, so if users are ever going to generate instances of this event it should indeed be settable in the init.  </s>
<s> One can argue that users shouldn't be generating mutation events directly, but if we're going to support initMutationEvent() it probably should support this.  </s>
<s> Good Catch, I think... Joe Kesselman / IBM Research  </s>
