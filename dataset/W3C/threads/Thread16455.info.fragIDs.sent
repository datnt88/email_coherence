<s> Use Alt+Down arrow to open the select menu when it has focus; then arrow up and down.  </s>

<s> Hi Scott, My guess is that you are working with JAWS in what it calls the Virtual PC mode.  </s>
<s> If you are moving through the web page a line at a time with an arrow key it is a good bet this is the mode you are in.  </s>
<s> To read the full dropdown you need to do two things: 1.  </s>
<s> With JAWS focus on the dropdown, press Enter.  </s>
<s> JAWS should say Forms mode.  </s>
<s> 2. Press alt-down arrow to open the drop down, and then use the arrow keys to read the choices.  </s>
<s> You can tell for certain what mode JAWS is in by pressing alt-delete.  </s>
<s> This will give you a message telling you which cursor is active.  </s>
<s> When you are finished with a dropdown or any input control, you should press the numeric keypad plus to return to Virtual PC navigation.  </s>
<s> This navigation scheme for input controls is not unique to JAWS.  </s>
<s> The name is different but Window-Eyes for example behaves an almost the identical fashion.  </s>
