unquote aloha, anne! 
there is absolutely no question that graphics are often necessary, and i don't think that anyone in this WG (or any other WAI WG) would dispute that fact... it isn't a question of whether graphics are necessary, but how best to use them to benefit those who interact most efficaciously with images, whilst making their content and contextual meaning clear to users whose interaction with the web is not visually oriented -- and, since that audience not only includes those with no usable vision, but those accessing the web via mobile devices or the telephone, ensuring the accessibility of graphical information is not only an accessibility issue, but a broader usability issue... moreover, the use of telephonic devices to access web-based content isn't limited to the realm of the rich and frivolous... i know of several blindness related organizations in the united states who have been attempting to make the information contained on their web sites available over the telephone for 2 very simple reasons: 1) an overwhelming majority of the population of the united states is extremely familiar with the telephone's simple interface; and 2) the leading cause of blindness in the united states are diseases and disorders associated with aging... while a great many quote senior citizens unquote have become as addicted to computers, email, and the web as have members of the quote junior set unquote, a great many more (including a large number of individuals with multiple disabilities) have, when polled by blindness-related organizations, expressed a preference for phone-based information retrieval over computer-based retrieval of web based content... likewise, economic disadvantages may preclude a child, teenager, or adult from regularly using -- much less owning -- a computer, but most american households have at least one phone, and even in areas where private phones are scarce, most people still use a phone, even if they have to stand out in the cold and rain to do so via a public telephone... it is precisely because the telephone remains one of the most ubiquitous accoutrements of modern life that many blindness related organizations (as well as many other disability-related and non-disability related organizations and entities) are eager to add a telephonic interface to their web presence... the advantages of using a phone to retrieve information are manifest -- an extremely simple and familiar interface -- as are the disadvantages -- the inability to save a local copy of the information being retrieved, save via a recording device, problems associated with devising effective mechanisms for filling out forms (will voice-recognition technology alone ever truly be sufficient? 
how does one use the telephone keypad to enter one's name, and where are the backspace and delete buttons?) -- not to mention bandwidth considerations and the fact that most phones are either utterly unable to display text and images, or have a very limited capacity for doing so, although some mobile phones are beginning to support rudimentary graphical content in the form of images... which brings me back to the topic of images and graphics... based upon your recent posts to the GL list, i understand your position to be that WCAG abjectly fails in addressing the needs of non-readers -- that is, those who cannot cognitively process text -- because it does not mandate graphical equivalents for textual content... since this is what i understand you to be asking the working group to consider as a P1 requirement for WCAG, a few questions need to be considered: 1. who is to decide what semiotic schema to use in order to provide a non-reader (as defined above) with a purely graphical slash symbolic version of the textual contents of a page? 
2. who knows best the needs and cognitive capacity of an individual user? 
my answer to this question is the individual user -- and, perhaps, those who interact with that individual, as an individual, and who respect his or her opinions and listen to his or her statement of needs, rather than those who simply quote know what is best unquote for the user, based upon a physical or psychological classification... 3. are there widely used symbolic systems that we should be aware of that are used to communicate ideas and words through symbols? 
if so, please provide us with references... 4. if there are such symbolic conventions, do they differ from country to country, as well as language to language, as is the case with braille? 5. is there a gradient of graphical content that you could suggest -- could you (or jonathan, or the 2 of you) compile a list of the elements and functionalities that you deem as indispensable for non-textual interaction with a web page? 
6. have you investigated XSLT, the eXtensible Stylesheet Language Transformations recommendation, which is located at: http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt ? 
while it isn't an immediate solution, it may prove capable of performing at least some of the radical transformations you seem to be requesting this working group add to WCAG as checkpoints (as well as addressing some of the visually-oriented formatting concerns which have been raised by scott) finally, it isn't a question of pitting my needs as a visionless individual against those of someone for whom iconic cues are indispensable... the needs of the 2 groups -- access to information, the efficient exchange of information, and increased autonomy -- are not mutually exclusive, nor should the needs of any group be championed to the detriment of the needs of another... what is needed are solutions that address the problems that have been identified by, or brought to the attention of, this working group in order that we might devise solutions that work equally well for as many groups as possible... the only reason i pointed out the shortcomings of the site you referenced is that it is part of the WAI's ever-evolving mission not only to actively search for, but encourage the development of, sites which meet the needs of as wide an array of both actual and potential users as possible... what i wished to convey was that -- with a modicum of effort (and/or an authoring tool that outputs more accessible HTML than that used to generate the site) -- the author of the page could have ensured that the document was as accessible and useable for visitor who could not see either the graphics or the visually-oriented layout, as you and jonathan stated it is for a symbolic surfer... the re-examination of the Techniques and Guidelines documents produced by the GL working group isn't about championing the needs of one group over another's, but of working together to strengthen a document that not only reflects the state-of-the-art in web-based and adaptive technology at the time it was created, but the information that was available to the working group at the time that WCAG was created... the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, like accessibility, the web, and life itself, is an ever-evolving work in progress, and if there are issues we missed or which you or anyone else feels need to be addressed, please let us know in as specific a manner as possible... having said that, i would be remiss if i failed to point out that scott's recent posts to the GL list serve as very good examples of the sort of information (problem statements and proposed solutions) which the working group is attempting to gather posted after letting the emessage sit for twelve hours and after at least 5 re-readings, gregory ABSURDITY, n.

While I would certainly never argue that graphics are not an important part of the web experience, after following this discussion for several days I still don't understand why those who have difficulty with reading can't use the same tools to have text read to them that the visually impaired use. 
While this does not address the needs of all, it would seem that at least those that cannot read (dyslexic?, illiterate?) would benifit from having the text read aloud, including the alt attribute for graphics especially where those graphics are pictures of words. 
As for the use of some 'symbolic' communication I wonder if the appropriate way to address this isn't with user software. 
The visually impaired employ a screen reader, Braille display, or whatever of their choice to translate screen text into a useable format for them. 
Perhaps user end software could be developed to translate that same text into a useable format for other disabilities? 
Marti We all without exception like what we know. 
academic types (not being personal) like lots of text. 
That one is fairly clear, though I expect some members object. 
Text readers as far as I know present a voice unknown, this can be unpleasant and thus hard to comprehend. 
The flow of the text may not suit the listeners ability. 
I have on many occassions recommended the use of a meta tag to indicate difficulty ogf comprehension. 
Many members commented on how awful sentence parsers are. 
The fact is they are better than nothing. 
Years ago I built a small spider in Visual Basic, it checked for things like the number of pictures per page, I soon realised that the first thing it needed to do was reject sites that had more than 30 words per page. 
Thousands of pages later I tried something else. 
Unfortunately even this tack is wrong because good stories when read well are long and understandable. 
It aint a simple problem, and insisting on universal solutions is not helping authors meet this huge need.

Illustrations (etc) as links, followed by the text link. 
An illustration on the opening screen of a page. 
This helps folks determine if they want to tackle the text on the page or move on. 
most Hate to share the road with someone using a cell phone ... but, you are right, and many cognitively disabled folks would probably also choose telephone over computer, but TV also delivers the web, and TV is also present in most homes (tho I've never seen anyone stand in the rain to see a TV! grin ) (will If you will indulge me a "slice of life": An LD 10 yo I tutor after school got a copy of Dragon, and began to set it up to accept her distinct southern accent. 
It's not yet something that can be used "on the fly". 
There seem to be no agreement on a universal symbolic "language" other than international road signs. 
Perhaps this can't be accomplished until we have the capicity to interpret languages "on the fly". 
But it is possible to ask authors to illustrate opening screens and links separate from graphics used for style and design. 
My suggestions have come from observing how a (small) number of cognitively disabled adults and children are using the web, and observing how a larger number of mixed disabled and not young students are learning to use the computer and the web. 
Not based on classification, but on observations of folks I know, not the least of which is my darling husband. 
Hope I have been more specific.

Enabling Support Foundation Marti, I like your suggestion for development of specialized browsers to let a user dial in how they view/hear/feel/smell the web. 
Perhaps starting with a speech browser, add features to allow the user to pinpoint a unit as small as a word, to pronounce, the allow the user to turn off or on how the content is presented. 
If, as an example, the browser permits "turn off text", the only responsibility of the page author is to provide an alternative to text. 
Graphics use less bandwidth than audio/video. 
Ideally, such a browser could include a translator to convert text to various popular symbolic languages including sign languages for the deaf. 
I suspect that an efficient written language translater will exist before a translater for symbolic languages can happen.
