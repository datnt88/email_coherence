4.c The spec will describe some addressing types that we support. 
Should we be open-ended and include a way to support other user-defined locator languages? 
No. The fact that we are defining generalized markup means that users can 
define their own locator languages if they want to -- and have the same 
level of interoperability with the rest of the world (none, without prior arrangement). 
If they want a way to generalize things, they can use HyTime. 
For XML linking, no effective purpose is server by knowing that something is a locator, if there's no guarantee that it can be resolved. 
We should keep XML linking as a specific architecture, not a toolkit. 
XML is a toolkit, and allows for flexibile private arrangements, so lets keep links simple and only include features that we are wiling to require of xml linking implementors.

I agree with David particularly with regards to an XML 1.0 version. 
An easy to use but more powerful than current applications version is needed. 
I think it important to emphasize if not in the spec language, at least in the presentations that XML Linking is more like TEI and less like HyTime in this: XML Linking is an application. 
It is not a user-extensible meta-language standard in the way that XML syntax is. 
That is why some of us asked for separate 
documents and refer to XML as a suite. 
The user certainly can use XML syntax and create another similar or dissimilar link and location application. 
Nothing can prevent that nor should anything. 
XML Linking is a set of application conventions that a user community agrees to and agrees to implement. 
Its success will depend on who adopts it and uses it. 
Now can someone add their own extensions to the XML Linking applications: certainly. 
Who will use those extensions? 
That is up to the market. 
Will they pass a conformance suite test set? 
No. Could they be offered as improvements to XML 1.n? 
Certainly. 
That is the way it should work. 
Will this guarantee future interoperability? 
No, but nothing short of a big stick does that and even then, it doesn't work when someone can bear the pain.

Listen to his words. 
It's got to mean something when Len and I are both in enthusiastic agreement!
