Please can people let me (everyone) know if they are going to this and what the agenda will be. 
I am very worried that I have already spent a lot of money on half the ticket and don't want to spend even more on the other half if it is not going to be well attended, esp. 
as Jutta and I are supposed to be in Sydney with a very good collection of authoring tools folk at that time for IMS Accessibility. 
The Sydney IMS meeting should achieve a lot so it might be better to contribute to that (and far less expensive from here!) Liddy 
Hi folks, I am not certain of attending that meeting yet - although I plan to be there, my new priorities mean that it is possible I will be trying to work with other groups at that time. 
(This is not clear yet). 
cheers Charles

I will be there.........however...........am involved with a few other working groups, so this ATAG meeting is not vital to me..........and, I have planned this trip as a vacation for some much needed quality-time with my daughters...........so the more free-time I have, the better..... :-) Katie Haritos-Shea #571-220-7777 Behalf Of Liddy Nevile

Hi Liddy, I will be attending the meeting in France.

I've been thinking about these meetings. 
As members of the IMS Accessibility WG, we work with other members who are major authoring tools developers. 
These tools are those that will be used in education but, of course, this is not the only place they will be used. 
On the other hand, companies like Microsoft, IBM, etc are not members of IMS, even though those products will be used extensively in education. 
The IMS member companies are active; we have close relationships and the developers are working hard, and effectively, I might say, on their products. 
The W3C Authoring Tools (AU) WG has companies working hard too, particularly focused on making sure the 'standards' will work. 
So there are two separate groups involved in similar efforts with very little interaction. 
As a member of the IMS Accessibility WG Sub-Committee for harmonisation, within IMS and beyond, and as a member of the WAI AU WG, I am working on this problem. 
I find it a bit hard to understand why we are not all working together. 
Surely IBM and Microsoft have the same or similar difficulties as WebCT and BlackBoard? 
The communities that benefit from the work get involved in education and the rest of life. 
The AU Guidelines (standards) set check points for authoring tools. 
Rather than working from the Content Guidelines towards better products, the IMS companies might want to use the AU checkpoints? 
(In fact, I believe they do have their products tested against the check-points but privately, not by working with the W3C AU WG.) Without having the IMS companies participating in the testing of the AU Check-points, the AU WG may be missing out on good info about the utility of the check-points, as the companies in question are knowledgeable and have a lot to offer. 
As the IMS group, we are not trying to do the W3C WAI work, in as much as we don't try to set standards but rather point to the well-defined existing standards. 
In reality, we have worked toward providing our community, the education world, with 'guidelines' full of explanations, techniques and reference points for making the web content more accessible. 
There is no compulsion in here - the draft White Paper, available on the web at http://www.imsproject.org/ is designed to be a helpful document oriented towards the educational world. 
In fact there is very little that will not be of general interest. 
(Behind the scenes, the IMS WG members who contribute to this work are working hard to ensure that their products follow the guidelines.) 
The approach being taken by the IMS WG is designed to fill the gaps between the standards and the users, to make the standards more effective. 
It seems that this is exactly what recent efforts by the AU WG have been doing too - Wombat does this much better than the first set. 
It is too late to have a combined meeting in February but surely it would be good to work hard, together, towards a shared F2F meeting very soon?

Not a bad idea.............what about WWW 2002 in Hawaii, once again?

Yes - I have a day long workshop scheduled (on the workshop/tutorial day) and am hoping that the morning will be tools etc and the afternoon metadata .... so ideas are welcome and let's make it a special event!
