A RSS feed is 100% accessible viewed in the right viewer. 
Then at least we have an accessible interface for all people to the core value of many web sites. 
The documents served are the same, but at least we have a good beginning, or what? 
The insertion of encoded HTML into RSS feeds (allowed in 0.92 and 2.0, also done with 1.0 even though 1.0 doesn't allow it [1.0 does has mechanisms to allow tranmission of HTML more safely]) brings with it a large number of potential problems. 
One of these problems is that it allows every Bad Thing that can be done with HTML to be done with RSS, bringing all manner of accessibility issues. 
Even without this I don't thing RSS will solve many accessibility problems, it is ill-suited for the delivery of much of the content on the web. 
As great as RSS is I think it's more a case of yet another thing we have to make sure we get right than any sort of panacea.

Where is the accessibility community?when it comes to RSS? 
A RSS feed is?100% accessible viewed in the right viewer. 
As you assuming a valid RSS feed? 
Which is the 11 standards were you referring to? 
How does RSS handle cognitive disabilities / handicaps? 
What about RSS with content encoded XHTML (or HTML)? 
Is this just as accessible? 
What about RSS that includes HTML that includes an image? 
While the various RSS formats do provide standard means to identify different articles, I would not for a moment consider them 100% accessible.

Could RSS revolutionize accessibility?

Well, the accessibility community has a number of people working on RDF in general. 
An RSS feed is also very limited in what kind of content it really handles - like HTML it doesn't address problems like how to deal with multimedia directly. 
Thre is a very rough draft of RDF-based techniques for Accessibility at middle of checking through the schema and writing up comments. 
There is some work that Jonathan Chetwynd has begun at yet. 
There is a grab-bag of ideas that might be interesting at there is a Dublin Core Accessibility special interest group looking at similar issues. 
There is work in the IMS consortium on using RDF (their own work, plus the W3C specifications CC/PP and EARL) to support accessibility in Education. 
And a whole lot more besides. 
So I think that RDF in general can revolutionise accessibility (if the work is done right - there are still no magic work-free solutions, but there are lots of ways to reduce the workload), and RSS has a role to play in that... cheers Chaals Charles McCathieNevile Fundaci?n Sidar charles@sidar.org http://www.sidar.org 
RSS is not made for "human consumption". 
It's what you make of it that counts. 
You can transform it via XSLT or similar into whatever format your user finds most appropriate...but then again, properly coded, semantic, structural XHTML can be manipulated in exactly the same way. 
And yes, RSS - being purely text based (?) - does not cater for cognitive disabilities, for instance...it's like the old myth that "text only" versions of a site are all that's needed to be perfectly accessible... My 0.02 GBP anyway, Patrick Patrick H. Lauke Webmaster / University of Salford As I see it, content syndication with RSS could be the most important thing for accessibility happening at the moment. 
If we have a million web sites of the nice kind being accessible, let us say WAI-A, we would still have a million very different web sites with very different information architecture, with very different navigation. 
Even accessible web sites are a big challenge for many people with disabilities. 
The major stumbling block is often the homepage of web sites, homepages are often very complex, and most often different from site to site. 
If the same web sites also use RSS Feeds, we have the potential of having one interface not to one web site but to a million web sites for all major items of news, articles, debates, product information, etc. 
Each group of people with disabilities could have their own RSS FEED Reader optimized for that particular group. 
The aggregated RSS Feeds would be a gigantic leap forward to a more accessible web, at least a much greater leap than some skip navigation for a single web site we use to talk about. 
We still have many problems with RSS syndication. 
At the moment some of the standards are made by half-crazy individuals probably knowing nothing about accessibility. 
Even W3C is not involved in some of the standards. 
RSS syndication is the closest we have been to the semantic web so far. 
A major battle is taking place. 
Are we going to get something really helpful to people with disabilities or just missed opportunities? 
We should all join this battle. 
The accessibility community should not take a power nap waking up in a year or two just in time to criticize all that went wrong. 
Best regards, Jesper Tverskov www.smackthemouse.com 
Very powerful post, Jesper. 
I am not an accessibility professional-- just a person who been on this list for nearly two years and has a great interest in these topics. 
I have learned a lot, but I am often amazed at how much brainpower can be so whiny and close-minded. 
RSS, ATOM, and other emerging standards are changing things for the better, right now-- get a mitt and get in the game.

Doesn't link perform that function just as well as RSS? 
David Dorward http://dorward.me.uk/ MM: It's best not to conflate the inaccessibility of the message with the inaccessibility of the medium. 
If someone writes a message that is text-only, it doesn't matter one bit what format it's sent in.
