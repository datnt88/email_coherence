<s> Hi, there!  </s>
<s> I just got started with XML::DOM.  </s>
<s> It is very good.  </s>
<s> But I don't see many examples on the internet site.  </s>
<s> That gets me in trouble.  </s>
<s> So, I am asking you for help!!!!  </s>
<s> What I am trying to do is to merge two different XML documents.  </s>
<s> If I do the following thing, I get DOM Exception errors.  </s>
<s> It says that I am trying to do this from two different document sources.  </s>
<s> Looks okay to me, but it seems that I have to do something else to merge two different XML documents, but nowhere can I find an example for this.  </s>
<s> Will anybody know how to do this?  </s>
<s> my $parser = new XML::DOM::Parser; my $doc = $parser- parsefile ("foo.xml");  </s>
<s> my $ctl_doc = $parser- parse(" Sample This is a test /Sample "); $jobrun_info_node = $doc- getElementsByTagName("JobRunInformation")- item(0); $jobrun_info_node- appendChild($ctl_doc); $doc- printToFile ("out.xml");  </s>
