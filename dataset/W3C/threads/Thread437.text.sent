Hi, almost same thing, error shows meta missing ' ' for end of tag". 
But, "meta" is already in TagTable.java. 
Can we do something (to make tidy) to solve this problem, then to give nice output other than zero-content file? 
thanks.

Subject: error when clean html with tidy Hi, Michael Thanks for your help on "config.txt". 
It's good solution. 
When i run tidy to clean some html, i got one error indicating that a missing ' ' for end of tag ". 
But " a " is already included in TagTable.java. 
Because of this error, the output as clean result is a zero-length file. 
But i want the output file not to be a zero-content file. 
Is there any solution to avoid this? 
Tidy is supposed to overcome this case, is it? 
chunbo Can you send a snippet of your HTML w/ the meta and a tags that Tidy is complaining about? 
You may unbalanced quotes or some other problem that has confused it.

chunbo This sounds like you are specifying XML input to Tidy. 
Please be sure that you haven't setXMLTags to true. 
Gary thanks for reply. 
Attached files are some html page on some university. 
I didn't make the page. 
I just use Tidy to parse it. 
The file "48-washington.edu" 
gave the error "Error: meta missing ' ' for end of tag". 
The file "42-upenn.edu" 
gave me the error "Error: a missing ' ' for end of tag". 
At the beginning of each file, you can see the url link address for this url file. 
I already took out these extra lines before I use Tidy to clean this url file. 
I cannot see any clue to figure out why the error happans. 
thanks for help. 
chunbo Please show how you're invoking Tidy and what the exact error messages are.

42-upenn.edu 
Type: Plain Text (TEXT/PLAIN) Encoding: BASE64 I have seen some horrible HTML generated in my time, but those 2 documents are terrible, and I'm not surprized Tidy has a problem. 
Hopefully the HTML below won't get mangled by the mail. 
1) "48-washington.edu" 
: (a) There are 3 body ... /body which are nested. 
(b) The META tag Tidy is complaining about is in the following (line #45) : line 45 column 16 - Error: meta missing ' ' for end of tag Note the missing  . 
If you fix this error, Tidy will produce output. 
(c) I won't comment on the rest of the horrible HTML code. 
2) "42-upenn.edu" 
: (a) The A tag Tidy is complaining about is in the following (line #192) : line 192 column 5 - Error: a missing ' ' for end of tag line 192 column 59 - Error: discarding unexpected /a LI A href="http://www.arstechnica.com/" 
/A Ars Technica /A FONT Size=-2 Ars Technica /FONT br Note the missing  . 
And the extra /A . 
If you fix this error, Tidy will produce output. 
I used the current (23 Aug 01) C version of Tidy, so you might see different behaviour from an older version. 
But as I see it, Tidy tells you exactly what and where the error is - all you need to do is look at the rest of the line that Tidy is complaining about, to see the problem,. 
Regards, Terry Hi, Gary The java file I used to invoke tidy is almost the same one as the example file offered by Tidy package. 
It is attached. 
I am not too sure now whether i need to set XMLtags to be false explicitly. 
Because I think the default for it is already false, is it? the error message is shown in err output file from tidy. 
The result is that the cleaned file as output will be zero length, which i don't like. 
thanks for help.

I've only checked one of these files, the 42-upenn.edu 
one. 
HTML Tidy says the error is on line 195. 
So look at line 195, which I have split inside the second /A to fit in a reasonable width. 
v LI A href="http://www.arstechnica.com/" 
/A Ars Technica /A Blow me down. 
HTML Tidy told you there is a missing ' ' because there *IS* a missing ' '. 
How about that? 
The letter "v" points to the place where the ' ' should have been. 
Not only that, the A is ended twice. 
It looks as though the first ' /A ' on line 195 should have been ' '. 
Note for the discerning: the appearance of ' FONT SIZE=-2 is an extremely reliable indicator of a page written by the HTML-clueless, and so it proves. 
This is a page that badly needs the attentions of Tidy.
