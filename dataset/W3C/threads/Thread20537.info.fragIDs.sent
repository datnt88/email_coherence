I installed Amaya 6.2 (Windows-Version) and tried to look at a XML document (local xml-file with external dtd and css). 
The display was not correct; especially namespaces following ( einfuehrung-xml xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40" ...) were not interpreted. 
This xml-file is displayed correct with opera 5/6, NS 6.2, galeon, ... I do not understand, that Amaya interprets xhtml-files correct, but not xml ... Both use normal xml-syntax. 
Can you give me some hint please Kind regards V. Risak

Hello, Thanks for your report. 
The support of XML documents by Amaya is still in progress, especially the display of such documents. 
Could you send a copy of your local xml-file so that I can test and fix the bug you mentionned.

I guess Amaya is confused with this namespace. 
You use the URI of the document that describes HTML 4.01. 
This is not a registered URI for any XML language. 
If you want to use HTML 4.01, don't use namespaces, as HTML 4.01 is an SGML application and namespaces are not part of SGML. 
Only XML knows about namespaces. 
So, I guess you would like to use XHTML, which is an XML language. 
Then you should use the appropropriate namespace for XHTML, which is: Refer to the XHTML specification: I hope it helps. 
Vincent.
