<s> I installed Amaya 6.2 (Windows-Version) and tried to look at a XML document (local xml-file with external dtd and css).  </s>
<s> The display was not correct; especially namespaces following ( einfuehrung-xml xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40" ...) were not interpreted.  </s>
<s> This xml-file is displayed correct with opera 5/6, NS 6.2, galeon, ... I do not understand, that Amaya interprets xhtml-files correct, but not xml ... Both use normal xml-syntax.  </s>
<s> Can you give me some hint please Kind regards V. Risak  </s>

<s> Hello, Thanks for your report.  </s>
<s> The support of XML documents by Amaya is still in progress, especially the display of such documents.  </s>
<s> Could you send a copy of your local xml-file so that I can test and fix the bug you mentionned.  </s>
<s> Regards Laurent Carcone Amaya team  </s>
<s> I guess Amaya is confused with this namespace.  </s>
<s> You use the URI of the document that describes HTML 4.01.  </s>
<s> This is not a registered URI for any XML language.  </s>
<s> If you want to use HTML 4.01, don't use namespaces, as HTML 4.01 is an SGML application and namespaces are not part of SGML.  </s>
<s> Only XML knows about namespaces.  </s>
<s> So, I guess you would like to use XHTML, which is an XML language.  </s>
<s> Then you should use the appropropriate namespace for XHTML, which is: Refer to the XHTML specification: I hope it helps.  </s>
<s> Vincent.  </s>
