I am not sure whether it is me or something else. 
Every time I run html-tidy with the html-kit, the applet tag disappears on the tidied version. 
Am I doing something wrong? 
This happens at work and at home. 
I see no other comments about this so I presume its me. 
David Halliday Some sample code for us? 
Y:\logs tidy Tidy (vers 30th November 1999) Parsing console input (stdin) line 1 column 1 - Warning: inserting missing 'title' element ^Z "stdin" appears to be HTML 3.2 1 warnings/errors were found! 
For me it's still there :-) regards, Bj?rn H?hrmann - mailto:bjoern@hoehrmann.de - http://www.bjoernsworld.de 
Does it recognize your code as HTML 4.0 otherwise? 
APPLET is deprecated in favor of OBJECT.

David Halliday I never really understood why, when the object tag was defined, a language type wasn't also specified. 
Since there are applets in java, tcl, perl, and a few other languages out there on the net, it seems like it would have made sense to lay the ground work for support by adding a language= attribute .

- - I suggest you send an email recording the problem along with a simple test file to the HTML-Kit feedback mailing list. 
I don't maintain HTML-Kit, although it is built on top of Tidy. 
Using tidy.exe, applet was preserved fine, so I am mystified.
