<s> Rejection is not just because of CGI scripts.  </s>
<s> Apparently, denial of service is a reason that a conforming HTTP/1.1 server might reject chunked encoding POST.  </s>
<s> Doesn't such rejection jeopardize interoperability with IPP clients that send chunked POST requests?  </s>
<s> First, I'd like to understand more about such denial of service, since I would think that a server would just timeout if the client didn't send the next chunk in a reasonable amount of time.  </s>
<s> Also if the client sent too much data with multiple chunks, the server could reject the next chunk with the 413 error code.  </s>
<s> So I don't understand the denial of service reason to allow a conforming HTTP/1.1 server to reject a chunked request and am seeking enlightenment.  </s>
<s> Thanks, Tom  </s>

<s> so why does the fact that a general-purpose HTTP server reject some non-length-given POST requests matter to IPP?  </s>
<s> In other words, if you are already assuming that the destination server can handle an IPP message, why can't you assume that it can also handle chunked input?  </s>
<s> The fact that it isn't required by HTTP in general doesn't mean you can't require it for particular resources.  </s>
<s> Or even for any IPP gateway.  </s>
<s> Apache, for instance, includes the ability to parse and forward chunked input within the core server -- it is only the mod_cgi module that won't accept it.  </s>
<s> The denial of service case exists for any service.  </s>
<s> Basically, the service needs some mechanism of rejecting a request and giving a reason for that rejection, preferably providing a means for the client to workaround the limitation if it is legitimate.  </s>

<s> This discussion is getting off track.  </s>
<s> There is a problem here and it may well impinge on IPP.  </s>
<s> But the problem is not with the HTTP spec.  </s>
<s> The problem is that there is no way to use CGI with chunked message-bodies.  </s>
<s> This is can be viewed as a limitation of CGI (CGI's problem) or a limitation of the most popular implementations of HTTP (HTTP implementor's problem).  </s>
<s> But it is not a problem with the HTT Protocol.  </s>
<s> HTTP does not prevent using chunking with CGI and it is not hard to find servers which support this, even though the most popular ones do not.  </s>
<s> You might also blame the CGI protocol for not permitting the use of chunked input.  </s>
<s> This could only be changed in a new version of CGI.  </s>
<s> It is not very helpful to tell people what they want to do is braindead.  </s>
<s> Obviously, some uses of CGI are useful and appropriate and some are not.  </s>
<s> Also this really has nothing to do with denial of service which can be done in lots of ways more easily than using chunking.  </s>
<s> I am not sure what recourse people have at this point.  </s>
<s> You could try to persuade Apache developers to implement this feature.  </s>
<s> I am not sure if it would be possible to write an Apache module to do this.  </s>
<s> You could also try to support a new version of the CGI spec which would permit CGI to take chunked input.  </s>
<s> Neither of these would deal with the existing base of installed servers, though.  </s>
<s> But the one thing which does seem clear is that no change or clarification in the HTTP spec can can help.  </s>
<s> In that regard, I would suggest that a server which rejects chunked message-body but returns a 200 status is not in compliance with the spec as it stands now.  </s>
<s> John Franks john@math.nwu.edu  </s>
<s> That is not CGI, nor is an embedded web server general-purpose.  </s>
<s> Any server where you have control over the nature of the resources back-end is not general-purpose.  </s>
<s> The reason it doesn't make any sense to implement IPP via a CGI script is because the server is being installed specifically to listen to IPP requests on the IPP port, and thus doesn't need to deal with the multifaceted heterogenerity of resources on a general-purpose HTTP server.  </s>
<s> It therefore doesn't make sense to have an IPP implementation that is generic among many servers (the ONLY reason to ever use CGI).  </s>
<s> Your own implementation uses a server-specific API on a specific set of pre-allocated printer resources within an embedded system.  </s>
<s> That is exactly what I would expect of an IPP implementation, and there is no reason why you can't support chunked requests.  </s>
<s> My point was that it is silly to limit IPP capabilities to the lowest common denominator of existing HTTP origin servers, since IPP isn't an existing HTTP service.  </s>
<s> ....Roy  </s>
<s> That depends on the servlet API.  </s>
<s> No application should use HTTP as a transport.  </s>
<s> If it used HTTP as HTTP,  </s>
<s> there wouldn't be any need for a separate implementation, but it would still be desirable to base the service on the best capabilities of HTTP and not on the characteristics that might be true of some other resources that are accessible via HTTP.  </s>
<s> ....Roy  </s>
<s> Agreed.  </s>
<s> One of many is still one.  </s>
<s> It is the reason that this is hard to implement correctly on a general-purpose server.  </s>
<s> If it wasn't for that reason I would have implemented it last year for 1.2.  </s>
<s> A configurably limited input buffer that redirects the request body before calling the script could either be implemented in the core (where dechunking is already being done) or within a mod_cgi replacement (duplicates effort, but certainly do-able).  </s>
<s> OTOH, it is easier to just implement IPP as a module.  </s>
<s> Just replace mod_cgi with something that passes chunked to the script -- it is only a one word change, but requires scripts that can parse chunked.  </s>
<s> Yep, since the status shouldn't be OK if the action wasn't successfully performed, and you can't perform a POST successfully without understanding the request body.  </s>
