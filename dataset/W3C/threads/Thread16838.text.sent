All apologies if this arrives twice but the first post didn't seem to appear after a couple of hours waiting. 
I am working on the assumption that using an image to submit a form will cause accessibility problems either because of the need for javascript or because it would mean using invalid html to create a text alternative for the image. 
I am in a situation where I am being asked to use images for form submission and would like to hear the views of list members.

Accessibility issues aside, it's simply not worth the time and effort (and therefore the money) spent to design graphical buttons. 
Inevitably, those buttons will need to change for some reason. 
Whether it's a new color scheme that is implemented, or the actual text on the buttons. 
It is simply more cost-effective to leave the buttons as input elements and use CSS to style them. 
Randal Images for submit buttons are part of HTML, and are accessible to screen readers. 
You will run into all of the same problems related to nonscalable text as for any text that is presented in a graphic, but the form will work fine. 
don't forget the alt attribute in the input element!
