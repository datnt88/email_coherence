Hi, I just started using your tidy tool to clean up some of the horrible HTML code that my WISYWIG editor spits out, and it really is a godsend. 
I have noticed something though - and I am not 100% sure if this is a bug, because I don't know how intelligent the parser is, but I have noticed that tidy does not remove redundant font specifications. 
The attached HTML file will illustrate what I mean. 
There are a bunch of fonts set one after the other (meaning that only the innermost one will actually have any effect) but the outer/redundant ones are not removed. 
Regards, Alfonso.

When I brought this issue up earlier, the general consensus was that Dave didn't have any solid algorithms for removing redundant font tags. 
So, after thinking this over, I volunteer to help perhaps write some pseudo code algorithms to deal with redundant font tags. 
Anyone want to join me?

tidy cleans up the document structure only, multiple redundant font tags are not a structural issue as such, and merging attributes is be somewhat tricky. 
If you use the -clean option, all font tags will be replaced by CSS, though you will still see multiple span tags then. 
Klaus Johannes Rusch KlausRusch@atmedia.net Yes, Tidy isn't as smart as it could be on this. 
I will look at your examples and see if there is anything I could do to improve Tidy's capabilities in this regards.
