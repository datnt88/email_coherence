<s> I'm working on a forthcoming issue (on how well browsers deal with standards) of an e-mail newsletter I write for the computer-aided design industry, and though the article isn't quite done yet, I have created a new layout and related pages as reference material to demonstrate their use and how well browsers support them.  </s>
<s> The newsletter won't hit for about a month, but since I'm doing a few things that are pretty radical, I'd like to make sure I'm not doing things that just shouldn't work, I'd like to solicit feedback on what I've created, lest I have to issue an embarassing correction to our 30,000 readers because I've created something inappropriate.  </s>
<s> I decided to try nearly every bit of HTML and CSS I'd always wanted to use, but couldn't because it didn't work right--especially fixed positioning, so it provides quite a workout, even for Mozilla and Opera.  </s>
<s> So try it in your favorite browser, and let me know what you think of the challenge I've set out for the browsers.  </s>
<s> Have I gone too far?  </s>
<s> Not far enough?  </s>
<s> Are there significant things I've failed to include?  </s>
<s> Because I'm trying to set an example, and use these pages as a sort-of browser test, I don't really care how well it degrades in older browsers (in fact, it only really works right in Netscape 6.2+, and at least one thing won't work until Mozilla 1.2 progresses a little further), but I'm interested in any and all comments on the design, how it works, or my assumptions.  </s>
<s> If you are going to provide instructions, as you do in regard to the points/inches box example, they should be comprehensive enough to work properly, on all platforms if possible or, alternatively, to alert readers to the unavailability of the feature.  </s>
<s> For example, on my W2K system with my combination of graphics card and monitor installed, I find neither the option tabs you mention nor a "virtual ruler" with which to make adjustments or comparisons.  </s>
<s> Finally, you might want to enhance the message by including some scripting that provides sniffing/feedback to the reader about the type and version of browser they are using, lists more egregious limitations/bugs, and provides links to upgrades.  </s>
<s> Otherwise, it's a good message even if I were to have aesthetic quibbles with a very busy page design.  </s>
<s> Just because something *can* be done doesn't always mean is *should* be done.  </s>
<s> Congrats and good luck.  </s>
<s> ...edN  </s>
<s> On my Mac IE 5.1 I see nothing but a blank white page, lots of downwards scrolling and a little sideways scrolling.  </s>
<s> Can't really comment on other aspects when I cant see them.  </s>
