Brians F2F agenda proposal General agreement we need to define what we want to accomplish in advance, not when we get there. 
Some concern that there is a lot to tackle. 
Concern was expressed about the timing w.r.t the SWWS [1]. 
Do we miss a half day of the Symposium or a half day of the WG meeting? 
ACTION: 2001-06-22#1: sergey: Talk to organizers about scheduling of talks. 
A number of people pointed out we need to tackle the core stuff (foundation, big picture, meaty technical issues, etc.) Proposal that three key areas need to be addressed before the meeting: 1. Which issues are in scope? 
2. What are the partitions? 
3. What are the dependencies between the issues? 
ACTION: 2001-06-22#2: Brian: Draft up these three points and post to list. 
Eric suggests we all prioritize the issues to focus the group better. 
Dan pointed out there are already partitions laid out in ACTION: 2001-06-22#3: All: Post priorities with reasons ACTION: 2001-06-22#4: Sergey: Summarize priorities that are posted More discussion on partitioning (see chat log).

Hi Stephen, A minor correction, but it probably makes sense to list as "chair" only the person chairing the meeting; this will typing be one of the co-chairs of the WG (ie. 
Brian or myself); more often than not, it'll be Brian. 
In this case it was indeed he. 
I mostly just lurked this week... cheers, Dan Thanks Steve for getting these out so promptly. 
One action I think got missed - Graham agreed to update last weeks minutes. 
Brian
