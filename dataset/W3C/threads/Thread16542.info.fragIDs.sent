<s> Chris Lilley is chair of the SVG Working Group so I asked his comment re David Wooley's concerns about accessibility problems posed by SVG.  </s>
<s> Love.  </s>
<s> ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE  </s>
<s> On the IG list David Wooley says: That means that you normally get individually placed characters, rather than whole words with a horzontal stretch factor, as allowed by the PDF primitives.  </s>
<s> This can confuse tools that try to extract words from the text (I predict that the same problem will happen with SVG if, as I suspect, people use it for whole pages, not just graphics)."  </s>
<s> It is certainly *possible* to use singly placed characters in SVG, but there is no need to and significant disadvanteges to doing so.  </s>
<s> I have rarely seen examples which do this, and the couple that I have have been machine translations from PDF.... SVG allows the stylesheet to select a condensed or expanded font.  </s>
<s> It allows the length of overall run of text to be specified, and the run then adjusted at layout time to be that length.  </s>
<s> Hmm thats not clear, let me give an example: Suppose for example I lav out some graphics, which include text, in Helvetica.  </s>
<s> Now thats a widely used font but there are lots of variations from different font foundries and oin different platforms, plus Windows thinks that Helvetica is spelled 'Arial'.  </s>
<s> So I specify in the SVG file the assumed length of this text string, then if your Helvetica and my Helvetica differ an adjustment is made so the line is the correct length.  </s>
<s> This prevents, for example, the text being 5% too long and overwriting something else, making it anywhere from untidy to illegible.  </s>
<s> Other things - SVG requires UAs that support a clipboard to allow text to be selected (yes, even if its all spaced out, vertical, on a curve, whatever).  </s>
<s> Placing each letter as a separate text string messes this up, so people don't do it.  </s>
<s> Its a;lwats helpful if an accessibility advantage is tied to a non-accessibility advantage.  </s>
<s> In this case, screwing around withthe text stops it being indexed correctly and thus means that less people find your stuff with search engines.  </s>
<s> The other occasion that I have sen unusual breaks in text is again with automatically generated conversions from PostScript, PDF, Quark, etc where the UA has done kerning and this is output as different text strings.  </s>
<s> Now it doesn't have to be this way - SVG fonts include kern tables, so it is better to keep entire strings together and use the kerning facility rather than faking it with sliced up, positioned strings.  </s>
<s> It all depends on what you are converting from and, as ever, how much information that source format retained.  </s>
<s> I converted a nice map example from PDF to SVG, and severalof the strongs had kerning like this. because SVG is a textual format I was able to load the file into a plain text editor and fix this up, joining the strings back together.  </s>
<s> I don't see a particular connection between the use of SVG for entire pages as opposed to single graphics, and the likelihood or not of text strings being undesirably split.  </s>
<s> Could you please allay fears of this, lay this ghost, whatever.  </s>
<s> I hope that I have done so.  </s>
<s> If the rumor spreads that SVG is going to be the new PDF-style nemesis for accessibility, it can't help.  </s>
<s> Right.  </s>
<s> While we are o the subject of accessibility, I would like to raise a new perspective.  </s>
<s> As some people are aware, i have a rather broad view of accessibility, which includes for example the fact that many people do not speak or read English (when asked what single thing would most improve accessibility for most people, I replied a voice browser that spoke Cantonese and Urdu).  </s>
<s> So, it seems that many people agree that accessibility for the non-literate is an issue.  </s>
<s> Lots of people speak English but cannot read it, for example.  </s>
<s> And lots of people don't read English but can understand diagrams.  </s>
<s> Thus, pictorial material can be am accessibility aid.  </s>
<s> If the thousand words of explanation don't help because you can't read them, or because they are not in a language you understand, then the picture may indeed be worth a thousand words.  </s>
<s> I would also point out that SVG has the ability to switch on the users preferred language and conditionally display text (and graphics).  </s>
<s> So for example it is easy to make a multilingual graphic that covers English, Frennch, German, Spanish.  </s>
<s> This is likely to be only fractionally larger than a monolingual one, but more accessible (according to my definition).  </s>
<s> The Jackaroo viewer, from the Koala team at INRIA, implements this switching.  </s>
<s> It also implements user CSS stylesheets by the way, and has a nice DOM viewer, so I encourage people to have a look at it.  </s>
<s> Chris Chris  </s>
<s> Every single character in the test file for the Adobe SVG Viewer is individually placed (to produce the arc, rather than because of microspacing) PDF, from the very begining, has had parameters to tweak  </s>
<s> the word and letter spacing, so that individual placement is not needed, and the PDF coding guidelines say that spaces should not be simulated by cursor positioning (the spaces need to be identifiable for cut and paste and searching to work), so PDF basically has the same accessibility features in these areas.  </s>
<s> I don't believe the real market for SVG and PDF are as different as Chris believes, and therefore faults that show in PDF creation tools to show in those for SVG.  </s>
<s> My concern is not so much the current beta state of SVG but what happens when it comes standard with browsers and every self proclaimed web design expert starts replacing their hybrid HTML (table mosaic)/Flash pages with pure SVG ones, and the popular book writers start producing hints and tip books with folklore on how to do this sort of thing with no mention at all of accessibility.  </s>
<s> (Doing arched headings is likely to be one of the first candidates for cook book examples in such books.)  </s>
<s> --------------------------- DISCLAIMER --------------------------------- Any views expressed in this message are those of the individual sender, except where the sender specifically states them to be the views of BTS.  </s>
<s> Yes. I am tempted to produce a revised version of that file that says "its time for adobe" "to implement text on a path".  </s>
<s> Since they do not implement text on a path, they can't do this properly.  </s>
<s> Actually they could, using tref instead of text eleents, but they didn't do tha either.  </s>
<s> Maybe WAI shouuld start a "DON" "TBR" "EAKMYYWO" RDS" campaign?  </s>
<s> I agree that SVG can serve the PDF market.  </s>
<s> I don't believe (indeed, i have evidence to the contrary) that SVG is solely restricted to the PDF market.  </s>
<s> Well, doing arched examples in SVG is easy.  </s>
<s> But the current Adobe implementastion doesn't do them.  </s>
<s> Other implementations do.  </s>
<s> Spliting the text up into individualy place d letters makes the designers job harder, and makes it tricky to maintain and difficult to localise for different languages.  </s>
<s> These practical considerations are likely to help.  </s>
<s> Web pages from third parties that examine different ways of achieving the same effect, and give the impression that peiople who do it a particular way are cliueless, are also likely to help establish the right memes ragarding SVG authoring.  </s>
