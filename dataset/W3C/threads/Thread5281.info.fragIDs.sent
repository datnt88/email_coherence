On Behalf Of Aldo Gangemi Sent: Thursday, May 13, 2004 2:29 PM Subject: [WNET] Plan for the next telecon WNET discussion As decided in the last telecon, I propose the following issue to be discussed with Christiane Fellbaum in the May 27th telecon (30 minutes): 
As a matter of form, it is helpful to readers if writers would include appropriate links and quotes when reference to previous decisions/discussion are made. 
Referring to I see ACTION: Aldo to discuss a plan for the May 27th discussion at the next Telecon 
(a) description of the actions for short/medium term to be followed by WNET-TF (a1) port of Princeton WordNet as an RDF data structure with an explicit OWL datamodel (a2) set of recommendations and/or patterns w/alternatives to reengineer wordnets as OWL ontologies 
Hmm, I'd rather separate these out, i.e. Issue: Encoding WordNet 1.6 in RDF/Owl - Can we have some help from Christiane. 
Active involvement would be good. 
Willingness to review important. 
- namespace to use 
- Technical issues to discuss e.g. are synsets classes and if so what are their instances. 
- Structuring the data - view files or knowledge server (not sure I understand that one - are we thinking they might ship knowledge server code as part of the distribution?) 
- Subject to Christiane being satisfied with the results, would he be willing ot include in the standard Wnet distribution. 
Other than mentioning as possible future work, I suggest we don't plan to spend any time discussing re-engineering Wordnet or wordnets as ontologies. 
I think it would be great to have a strawman distributed before to discuss at the telecon. 
This might be based on Guus' proposal. 
I'll be interested to see whether Owl is required for this. 
As usual I'm inclined to prefer to have a non-Owl version available. 
(b) availability of Princeton to include an OWL-RDF (datamodel+data) version (as at (a1)) in the official distribution (c) availability of Princeton (and/or other initiatives in which Christiane is involved) to include (possibly by participating in the development of) our recommendations and patterns at (a2)) in some official set of guidelines or joint programme If I receive no further suggestion, 
Sorry, but you've got another suggestion. 
I feat the task force leader's enthusiams and mine lie in different places. 
I'll consider these issues as a 
reference to produce a report on WNET activity some days before the telecon, so that we will not need much time to clarify the respective backgrounds. 
Showing willing by having a first cut would seem like a good thing. 
Naively Brian

OK thanks, doing exact references for everything is always a good practice :) 
Yes 
Yes 
As an anticipation of the report, and to answer some of the issue you have raised sometimes ago, look at: you'll find in the first paragraph: WordNet? is an online lexical reference system whose design is inspired by current psycholinguistic theories of human lexical memory. 
English nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs are organized into synonym sets, each representing one underlying lexical concept. 
Different relations link the synonym sets. 
You are served: synsets are *sets* of *synonym lexical entries*. 
Synsets *represent* *one* underlying lexical *concept*. 
Hence: 1) from the terminological viewpoint, a synset can be represented as an owl:Class whose instances are lexical entries (words, terms) 2) from the conceptual viewpoint, a synset can be represented as an owl:Class whose instances are concept's instances (where the concepts are only those accepted in the lexicon at hand). 
3) A concept instance is *usually* interpreted as an entity in the domain of reference of an ontology, which is identified by the properties of the concept. 
Of course, there are even alternative semantic interpretations for concept instances, but the one mostly accepted in ontology engineering is the one I have mentioned. 
4) Although not considered by WordNet, we can also conceive of representing synsets as owl:Individual, treating WordNet as a legacy database. 
Besides my Lab's site, you can look at a lot of other work on these issues, for example: 
No, Philippe was suggesting that owl-encoded wordnets should work on the Semantic Web through dedicated knowledge servers rather than as scattered views of monolithic files. 
Perfect. BTW ... she be willing ... 
Your suggestion clashes against the willing of many actors in the scene, besides the intended scope of Princeton WordNet. 
In this committee there are obviously persons not interested in that kind of work, but I understand they are not the totality, for example: Moreover, I do not see why a meaningful area of investigation, supported by many individuals and groups in the Semantic Web and elsewhere, should not be addressed by this task force. 
As a good matter of form, look at the discussions in the [OEP] task force: none has ever tried to mute or to suggest to ignore a position just because she is not available to discuss it. 
It is part of the report due before the telecon. 
OWL should be used for the datamodel in the Stoffel/Guus proposal. 
Probably the expressivity required can be available in RDFS as well. 
Of course, this is a natural outcome of group working ;). 
I won't force you to discuss *all* the issues, you won't force me to shut up. 
No fear, no problem.
