<s> Copied below you will find some advice I gave, in an unguarded moment, to someone about a form on their website.  </s>
<s> One of the things I said was "put the explanation of a text-line entry field before the entry field on the same line."  </s>
<s> I couldn't find a basis for this recommendation in the current PA guidelines draft.  </s>
<s> Is this suggestion unnecessary?  </s>
<s> Should it be in the PA guidelines?  </s>
<s> Al -- quote For your forms (minimum short-range plan): 1. Ensure that entry filed description and entry field appear on the same line.  </s>
<s> 2. Initialize all text-entry fields with some placeholder content.  </s>
<s> Don't leave them empty, initially.  </s>
<s> 3. [Work with XXXXXXXXX to] arrange for some hands-on evaluation by people using varied adaptive technology suites.  </s>
<s> Use this after you have a next-iteration version implementing at least the above two points for fine tuning and final approval.  </s>
<s> This is a good interim solution that is needed because of quirks with screen readers.  </s>
<s> However, it is only needed when there is more than one form control per line and often associating a label explicitly with a control will take care of the problem (depending on the software used to interact with the page).  </s>

<s> to follow up on what Wendy A Chisholm said:  </s>
<s> Thanks for the quick response and the reference.  </s>
<s> The testing referred to in the analysis only mentions checkboxes.  </s>
<s> The specific control I was dealing with was an INPUT TYPE=text entry item, used for entering name, address, etc.  </s>
<s> I probably didn't make that clear.  </s>
<s> I suspect that the bottom line is the same, however: there are enough users out there today whose screen readers won't be told about the label-for relationship so that it is good practice to make read-line succeed in explaining what is going on.  </s>
<s> Is that true?  </s>
