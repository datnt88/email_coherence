I need, W3C Rec-DOM-Level-1-19981001 in french ! 
Can you help me please ?

I do not know of a translation into French, perhaps someone else does. 
If you know both languages, perhaps you could translate it?

Unfortunately we do not currently have any french translation of the DOM Level 1 Specification. 
I'd like to use this as an opportunity to remind people that volunteers to translate the spec in various languages are always welcome. 
Several people have sent a message stating they were going to work on such a translation. 
If you have got anything available, even if it's not completed, please let me know. 
I will add a link from the translations page. 
I just got a japanese translation. 
Thanks.
