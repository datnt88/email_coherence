Hello, Based on consensus reached during the 20 January teleconference [1], I propose the following statement of conformance to the User Agent Guidelines. 
Note that all the hard work lays ahead: establishing two subsets of checkpoints.

Conformance The terms "must", "should", and "may" (and related terms) are 
used in this document in accordance with RFC 2119 ([RFC2119]). 
This document defines two categories of conformance in order to promote a standard of accessibility within, and interoperability between, two important classes of user agents - graphical desktop browsers and dependent assistive technologies. 
Desktop graphical user agents To conform to this document, a desktop graphical user agent must: 1.Satisfy all the Priority 1 checkpoints explicitly marked as applying to that class of user agent, and 
2.Satisfy those checkpoints natively (i.e., no additional software is required) unless the checkpoint explicitly indicates that it may be satisfied through communication with other software. 
Even for those checkpoints that must be satisfied natively, desktop graphical user agents should make information available to other software through standard interfaces. 
Dependent user agents To conform to this document, a dependent user agent must: 1.Satisfy all the Priority 1 checkpoints explicitly marked as applying to that class of user agent. 
2.Satisfy those checkpoints natively (i.e., no additional software is required) unless the checkpoint explicitly indicates that it may be satisfied through communication with other software. 
Verification that a checkpoint has been satisfied lies outside of the scope of this document and the activities of the WAI User Agent Working Group. 
The checkpoints are expressed in language intended to facilitate verification by other parties. 
Please note that lack of conformance does not imply lack of 
accessibility. 
However, the WAI User Agent Working Group believes that a user agent that conforms to this document is more likely to be accessible than one that does not. 
The conformance mechanisms defined here reflect the weight that the WAI User Agent Working Group assigns to the Priority 1 checkpoints. 
However, the Working Group also recommends that user agent developers satisfy as many checkpoints as possible, including Priority 2 and 3 checkpoints. 
Ian, This language says that compliance can only come through native implementation, which would leave out third party AT as a means of compliance. 
I don't think that this is necessarily a good idea. 
One of the themes that has gone through the document in techniques is to fully implement and expose the DOM as a means of conformance. 
But that implies that a third party device would use the information provided by the DOM to provide access to the web. 
The requirement of native implementation would make exposure of the DOM a non-issue, since the browser must provide direct access to all priority 1 items. 
By allowing third party AT, we also give the option of such technology also implementing priority 2 or 3 items, even though the mainstream browser does not.

Denis, I'm not sure which language you're referring to. 
The proposal reads: 
This means (and perhaps it needs editorial work if not clear enough) that the WG will have to choose which checkpoints must be implemented natively and which may be implemented through an interface. 
Thus, conformance depends on some hybrid, which the WG must establish. 
Furthermore, conformance for ATs is defined, in exactly the same way: some combination of natively implemented checkpoints and communication through an interface. 
This conformance proposal implies two (challenging) tasks for the WG: 1) Establish two subsets of checkpoints 2) Decide which ones must be implemented natively. 
I hope this addresses your questions. 
As mentioned above, conformance is not defined as native implementation of all checkpoints. 
Thus, discussing communication through an interface - The DOM - remains a vital subject for consideration. 
The following provision of the conformance proposal can be tightened up to allow this if the WG desires: 
Currently, it reads "should". 
Making it a "must" would ensure that other software could implement the other checkpoints that are not required for conformance. 
The WG must decide if it wants to strengthen this requirement.
