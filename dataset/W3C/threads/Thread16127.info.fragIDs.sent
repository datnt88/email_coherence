There's been a lot of stuff about website accessibility for people with learning disabilities. 
The sites I've just visited don't seem to have the characteristics we've been discussing but they are apparently *BY* the people in question. 
"People First" seems to be a key organization *OF* LD folks. 
Two URLs (with lots of links) will give a better feel for what this is all about: http://www.peoplefirst.org.uk/ and The main theme that comes through is that we should be listening to the people who experience these disabilities and not be diverted by counselers, etc. - just like with any other group. 
Sort through these links and get into their lists, email exchanges, etc. 
Then we can get them involved in our process to the mutual benefit of us all. 
Love. 
ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE 
William, as usual you are right on the money. 
Nothing like asking the folks involved.

These are both good sites. 
They are evidently written by people with excellent literacy skills, who would still have problems browsing. 
I certainly hope members will take the time to contact a group or individual with learning difficulties and there are many.

Our site www.peepo.com is a drive thru. 
When you see a link of interest, click on it. 
Move the mouse to slow down. 
It is a graphical aid to browsing the www. 
We value your comments. 
The average web designer won't have access to people with learning disabilities any more than they would have access to a person with visual disabilities; for this reason, it's good to have a set of guidelines and principles that can be followed. 
Can you provide such, perhaps by showing specifically what could be done to improve the understandability of the W3C site or some other web site?
