The Editor's TODO list is now complete. 
I've added entries for all the Editorial issues. 
Some of them I've split into multiple entries ( check the CVS log for details ). 
Some of them have comments from me, I'd like feedback from the other editors regarding these comments/proposed courses of action. 
I'll be working on issue resolutions this afternoon, Gudge From: Jean-Jacques Moreau [mailto:moreau@crf.canon.fr]

221: I think the resolution is problematic. 
Agree. 
OK, how should we proceed. 
This issue is closed as far as the WG is concerned. 
286: Add '(which may or may not also be SOAP intermediaries)' to first note? 
Sounds reasonnable. 
Done. 
289: What does an intermediary do when it receives a fault? 
Is the fault guaranteed to be passed on to the original sender ( or previous intermediary)? 
Since we don't indicate what happens when faults are generated in the first place, I think the most we can say is that intermediaries MAY forward fault messages. 
However, I am wondering whether this is not raising a deeper issue, which is how intermediaries forward response messages. 
I think sections 2.7.* are written from the POV of request messages; do they cover adequately response messages? 
Good question. 
What do the other editors think? 
334a: Mention SOAP Response MEP???? 
I don't think we need to. 
I also don't think we should. 
Done, issue closed in edtodo 334b: Seems to me that MEPs are one of the extensibility points in SOAP... So what do we need to say??? 
I'm confused by the issue as well. 
Ignore? 
That's my gut feeling. 
Issue closed in edtodo 335: I don't think we need to change it, it is only an example... Agree. 
Done. 
Entry closed in edtodo. 
352a: When refering to the QNames of types use QName production ( prefix:localname ) rather than 'localname' I think this would improve readability (although, strictly speaking, prefix should be replaced by the corresponding URI ;-)). 
Well, given we state in the intro what the prefixes map to that isn't necessary. 
I'll do a pass through the spec and make this change. 
352b: Use textual identifiers for references rather than numerics I believe I have done this already about two months ago, after this were pointed out for WSDL... BTW, this is not a stylesheet issue, we only need to change the key in the bibtex entry (or whatever the XML production name is). 
You are correct, this has already been done. 
Thanks. 
352d: Ensure all occurences of Infoset properties appear in square brackets; e.g. '[specified]' rather than 'specified'. 
The better long term solution would be to create and use a new XML element. 
We should then s/[/ prop /. OK, I'll put in the appropriate markup and update the stylesheet. 
353a: Provide examples of 'struct' and 'array' from some programming language I agree with Marc, we should not do this. 
I also think this is out of scope for the primer. 
OK. Closed in the edtodo 353b: Provide at least one example for each section Possibly. 
353c: I propose we change the section title from 'Rules for encoding Graphs in XML' to 'Mapping between XML and the SOAP Data Model' or some such. 
20020820 MJG Works for me. 
Done. 
357: Change DataEncodingUnknown to SOAPEncodingUnknown Sounds good. 
373: suspect this issue really needs to be kicked 'upstairs' to the WG. Agree. 
OK. Mail sent to xml-dist-app.[1]

Note also that a previous draft[1] had more to say on this. 
Not sure why or when this was removed.
