There is a typo in dom-to-dtd.xsl: 
In the sink interfaces: DOMFilterWriter should be: DOMWriterFilter However, if you fix that you get an incorrect dtd. 
DOMWriterFilter extends dom level 2 NodeFilter. 
The acceptNode method from the super interface is not added to the dtd. 
(member+|(var*,(handleError|handleEvent|resolveEntity|(startElement,acceptNode,whatToShow)|whatToShow)))? 
should have been: 
(member+|(var*,(handleError|handleEvent|resolveEntity|(startElement,acceptNode,whatToShow)|(acceptNode,whatToShow))))? 
any idea ?

I'll have to investigate this one. 
I suspect that "traversal:" namespace qualifier on the base interface would also cause problems. 
If you've got some sample tests that I could use to test the production, it would be appreciated. 
Won't be able to work on this for at least 20 hours or so. 
(member+|(var*,(handleError|handleEvent|resolveEntity|(startElement,acceptNo de,whatToShow)|whatToShow)))? 
(member+|(var*,(handleError|handleEvent|resolveEntity|(startElement,acceptNo de,whatToShow)|(acceptNode,whatToShow))))? 
Hopefully fixed now. 
dom3-combine now adds DOM L2 Traversal/Range to dom3-interfaces and strips namespace prefixes (for example, traversal::) from inherits attributes. 
build.xml 
updated so that dom3-combine will have DOM L2 specs available. 
dom-to-xsd and dom2-to-dtd updated to produce sink attributes and methods for base classes.
