<s> There is a typo in dom-to-dtd.xsl:  </s>
<s> In the sink interfaces: DOMFilterWriter should be: DOMWriterFilter However, if you fix that you get an incorrect dtd.  </s>
<s> DOMWriterFilter extends dom level 2 NodeFilter.  </s>
<s> The acceptNode method from the super interface is not added to the dtd.  </s>
<s> (member+|(var*,(handleError|handleEvent|resolveEntity|(startElement,acceptNode,whatToShow)|whatToShow)))?  </s>
<s> should have been:  </s>
<s> (member+|(var*,(handleError|handleEvent|resolveEntity|(startElement,acceptNode,whatToShow)|(acceptNode,whatToShow))))?  </s>
<s> any idea ?  </s>
<s> Thanks, Jeroen X-Hive Corporation Jeroen van Rotterdam, CEO e-mail: jeroen@x-hive.com  </s>
<s> I'll have to investigate this one.  </s>
<s> I suspect that "traversal:" namespace qualifier on the base interface would also cause problems.  </s>
<s> If you've got some sample tests that I could use to test the production, it would be appreciated.  </s>
<s> Won't be able to work on this for at least 20 hours or so.  </s>
<s> (member+|(var*,(handleError|handleEvent|resolveEntity|(startElement,acceptNo de,whatToShow)|whatToShow)))?  </s>
<s> (member+|(var*,(handleError|handleEvent|resolveEntity|(startElement,acceptNo de,whatToShow)|(acceptNode,whatToShow))))?  </s>
<s> Hopefully fixed now.  </s>
<s> dom3-combine now adds DOM L2 Traversal/Range to dom3-interfaces and strips namespace prefixes (for example, traversal::) from inherits attributes.  </s>
<s> build.xml  </s>
<s> updated so that dom3-combine will have DOM L2 specs available.  </s>
<s> dom-to-xsd and dom2-to-dtd updated to produce sink attributes and methods for base classes.  </s>
