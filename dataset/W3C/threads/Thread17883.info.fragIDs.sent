aloha, jon! 
i have an addition to your review of IE5 and the UAGL, based upon my recent experiences upgrading from IE 4.01SP2 to IE5. 
I hope that the following addresses Checkpoint 1.3, which reads: Ensure that the user can install the user agent software in a device independent manner. 
[Priority 1] Please note that, although I am not responsible for evaluating JFW and MSIE, I 
am forwarding this info to the WG as it was necessary for me to upgrade my version of MSIE in order to test HAL95 and Window-Eyes against the AUGL, and, since I am most comfortable and adept using JFW, I decided to use it to install 
IE5, so as to prevent any sort of installation SNAFU. 
Moreover, it is my impression that Dave Poehlman already has IE5 installed on his machine, so I decided to document the installation process, in order that this checkpoint be 
reviewed.

A) MATERIALS USED IN EVALUATION 1. Assistive Technology: JFW (build 3.30.26/desktop 
keyboard layout) 2. Speech Synthesizer: Eloquence for JAWS (running on a NeoMagic MagicWave 3DX 
Sound System (driver: NMA255.VXD version 4.03.2420 3. OS: Windows95 (version 4.01.0.971.B) 4. Computer: Gateway Solo 2500 (laptop; using Micron Windows95 keyboard) with 96MB RAM and a Pentium II processor running at 366MHz 5. Source of Installation files: Office2000 Update CD-ROM (disk 1) B) COMMENTS &amp; OBSERVATIONS 1. Application (dialog) boxes did not fully voice, although checkboxes and edit 
areas did self-voice when TABed-to; Needed to use screen review (JAWS cursor) to hear complete content of application (dialog) boxes. the "Read Box in TAB order" screen review command (INSERT+B) spoke only the window title, the topmost text, and the row of buttons (Back, Next, Cancel, Help), and NOT the box's complete contents. 
In order to listen to explanatory text, it was necessary to use the JAWS (screen review) cursor to move around within application (dialog) boxes. 
2. Chose "Install Minimal, or customize your browser" option. 
2A. 
When scrolling through the options contained in the type of installation list (a field which was not titled), the "Description" of the installation type, which is supposed to change as the selected option changes, did not self-voice. 
2B. Media specific/visual only cues utilized: "Components appearing in bold 
text do not need updating". 
Ramifications: Without having explored every 
portion of this dialog box with the JAWS (screen review) cursor, I would not have been aware that (a) items that did not need updating were in bold face, and (b) that in order to discern which items did not need to be updated, I would need to use JAWS' "say font" hotkey (INSERT+F), which (at least on my system) does not always accurately report the font weight when used within a list box; bottom line: no independent indication that a component did not need 
updating 
3.The installation progress window (title: "Windows Update: Internet Explorer and Internet Tools") did not completely self-voice, and did not provide any useful information. 
Only the top 2 (unchanging) lines of text in the window were auto-announced. 
They were also repeated 9 times before JFW announced "Cancel Button". 
Thus, in order to monitor the installation progress, I needed 
to use the JAWS (screen review) cursor, and -- due to the time-sensitive nature 
of the information displayed, I am not sure that I heard all of the information 
that was painted .to the screen. 
4. Restart computer dialog box voiced very well, but despite shutting down any 
open applications and issuing the shut-down sound, the computer did not reboot. 
Eventually, any attempt at keyboard input yielded only a system error 
bell, so I was forced to shut down manually and reboot. 
On reboot, ScanDisk ran, but did not find any problems or errors. 
5. AFTER REBOOT 5A. JFW (which I have set to "Run JAWS First") loaded without incident. 
5B. 
Windows Update and Personalized Settings windows did not voice completely. 
Window title and introductory text spoken, but enumeration of items only available by using JAWS (screen review) cursor.

Before I get to the comments though I must say that I am running windows.98 on a del optiplex gx1 with a 450 mhz p II with 64mb ram and an ati rage pro 3d atir3 video card and jfw 3.3.26

These problems are not ie specific but it is good that they are noted here.

This is more of an interface issue than an app specific issue although the whole thing could be dealt with by making it self voicing.

*dp* The impression is given here that this is precarious at best but although bothersom, it is doable. 
jon May have different experiences to share on this still.

I have a question about the wording of check point 10.1, Provide information about document and view changes (to the user and through programming interfaces). 
Should the word "and" be in the parenthetical comment, (to the user AND through progrommatic interfaces)? 
If yes, how does IE satisfy this checkpoint in terms of providing info directly to the user. 
Should the word AND be removed or changed to OR? Kitch 
10.1 Provide information about document and view changes (to the user and through programming interfaces). 
[Priority 1] yes, active accessibility and DOM API
