<s> Hi, I've been doing more thinking about the documentation issue.  </s>
<s> I'd just like to clarify what we mean when we talk about documentation.  </s>
<s> Since many user agents don't come with manuals, I had been assuming that documentation includes an application's built-in help system as well as any print materials that may accompany a product.  </s>
<s> Is that a safe assumption?  </s>
<s> Does the term documentation only apply to manuals?  </s>
<s> What about context sensitive help?  </s>
<s> Should the help system and any "manuals" be treated separately in regards to checkpoints for accessibility?  </s>
<s> Thanks, Kitch  </s>
<s> Documentation is "things written about something".  </s>
<s> The warranty, the help files, the book that comes with it, the instructions scribble onto the box by the salesman or your mum are documentation.  </s>
<s> Although some of these are outside the control of the UA developer.  </s>

<s> Manuals imply print versions to me.  </s>
<s> Print-only manuals seem by definition to be inaccessible for those who are blind.  </s>
<s> (or do we assume that such potential users have access to scanners/OCR/text-to-speech systems?) Online help is the only resource that is useful to me other than initial setup instructions.  </s>
<s> Main reason is online search capabilities to find things.  </s>
<s> When I must depend on an index, I am at the mercy of the indexer knowing my vocabulary as well as the authors.  </s>
<s> I must trust them not to selectively ignore key topics such as accessibility issues in NSNavigator.  </s>
<s> Anecdote: Kitch's suggestion about limits of NSNavigator Index obscuring how to turn images off.  </s>
<s> After about 5 minutes trying to use their index (trying images, graphics, loading, download, automatic loading, etc.) I gave up, and searched from the main menu to find preferences.  </s>
<s> I examined each of the choices, finally at the bottom was Advanced.  </s>
<s> Eurika! the first checkbox: Edit= Preferences= Advanced= Automatically Load Images Once I found it, I unchecked it.  </s>
<s> Didn't seem to have any effect, since the images on the refreshed page were still in the cache.  </s>
<s> Bummer.  </s>
<s> Weak cause and effect test.  </s>
<s> Did work with different page.  </s>
<s> Finally.  </s>
<s> I went back to the index and found "preferences, Navigator" In the middle of 15 choices was "Automatic Loading".  </s>
<s> Again under personalizing Navigator, paging down linearly for 35 screens (without a subindex) I found Automatic Loading described.  </s>
<s> There was no useful content search available.  </s>
<s> Moral: A review of any documentation should include probes for help with common accessibility needs.  </s>
<s> I'd prefer they were integrated.  </s>
