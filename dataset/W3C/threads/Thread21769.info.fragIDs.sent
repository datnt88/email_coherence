Let's call this odd hybrid approach #89. 
What's odd about it? 
It's clearly the way the Web works, and consistent with all the specs (RDF, HTTP, HTML, not sure about XLink/XPointer) as written, no?

Let's call this odd hybrid approach #89. 
It's how the works in an informal, human way, but it doesn't seem amenable to machine processing. 
To rephrase, approach #89 says that the denotation of an http URI or URI-Reference is EITHER a living-document-like-thing (a maintainable collection of information) or a domain-of-discourse thing which is the subject (apparent and/or intended -- that's another issue) of the document-like-thing. 
Consider the RDF graph _:sandro n1:likes http://www.w3.org/Consortium/ and assume you know that _:sandro is me. 
You don't know if it's saying I have the "n1:likes" relationship with the web page or with the consortium. 
But then the schema for n1:likes tells you its range is web pages, so now you know. 
But then you come across _:eric n2:likes http://www.w3.org/Consortium/ and the range of n2:likes is organizations. 
Organizatons and web pages are disjoint in my ontology, so we have a contradiction. 
To generalize, any RDF graph which tries to use the URI as both a subject identifier and a page identifier (with non-trivial ontologies for each) will be inconsistent. 
This is likely to occur in lots of real systems, especially as graphs are merged unpredictably. 
Do you see a way out of this? -- sandro 
Let's call this odd hybrid approach #89. 
To avoid repeating my previous mistake [1], let me quote some more of my earlier message: My personal suggestion [6] to the RDF community (which I encourage the TAG to reiterate) uses a hybrid which largely mirrors current practice. 
The idea is to say that ... means 33 ... (the web page) if there is no "#" in the URI and 102 ... when there is a "#". 
(As above, I don't like the "intent" part of 102; I prefer an external formulation like primarySubject, but it can be used like 102.) Beyond this, people can use primarySubject and webAddress explicitely for the less common other cases. 
Let's call this odd hybrid approach #89. 
As in my just-posted message to Roy and the TAG [2], saying a mental model is consistent with previous observations does not mean it is correct or will be consistent with future observations. 
That said, I don't think it is consistent with past observations. 
To rephrase #89: a URI is directly linked to either the container or the subject, depending on whether the URI contains a "#" character. 
If it contains a "#" it's directly linked to subject, and you can't talk about the container or the content. 
I don't think that matches XLink/XPointer or general HTML user experience with fragment identifiers. 
In both these situations, the "container" view still holds quite nicely (although in HTML the end of the container is not clearly specified). 
People certainly talk about the "text at foo#bar", which is a sure sign they are not always jumping straight to the subject. 
That said, as long as we provide a way in RDF to quote a URI string and a predicate to link that string to the container, it's okay to make jumping straight-to-the-subject be the default.

Sandro, 
Do you have a worked out test case for this, using content negotiation of an image document, rather than a 'real world vs online stuff' scenario? 
I believe many of the same issues arise (w.r.t. '#' etc), but the situation is different in that there could be 3 or more different renderings of the image. 
W3C's logo URI is a good example, since you can get at least two flavours of it from the same URI. 
Happy new year btw 
Dan 
I don't quite understand, sorry.... 
You too.
