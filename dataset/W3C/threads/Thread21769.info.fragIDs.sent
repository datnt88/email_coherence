<s> What's odd about it?  </s>
<s> It's clearly the way the Web works, and consistent with all the specs (RDF, HTTP, HTML, not sure about XLink/XPointer) as written, no?  </s>

<s> Let's call this odd hybrid approach #89.  </s>
<s> It's how the works in an informal, human way, but it doesn't seem amenable to machine processing.  </s>
<s> To rephrase, approach #89 says that the denotation of an http URI or URI-Reference is EITHER a living-document-like-thing (a maintainable collection of information) or a domain-of-discourse thing which is the subject (apparent and/or intended -- that's another issue) of the document-like-thing.  </s>
<s> Consider the RDF graph _:sandro n1:likes http://www.w3.org/Consortium/ and assume you know that _:sandro is me.  </s>
<s> You don't know if it's saying I have the "n1:likes" relationship with the web page or with the consortium.  </s>
<s> But then the schema for n1:likes tells you its range is web pages, so now you know.  </s>
<s> But then you come across _:eric n2:likes http://www.w3.org/Consortium/ and the range of n2:likes is organizations.  </s>
<s> Organizatons and web pages are disjoint in my ontology, so we have a contradiction.  </s>
<s> To generalize, any RDF graph which tries to use the URI as both a subject identifier and a page identifier (with non-trivial ontologies for each) will be inconsistent.  </s>
<s> This is likely to occur in lots of real systems, especially as graphs are merged unpredictably.  </s>
<s> Do you see a way out of this? -- sandro  </s>
<s> Let's call this odd hybrid approach #89.  </s>
<s> To avoid repeating my previous mistake [1], let me quote some more of my earlier message: My personal suggestion [6] to the RDF community (which I encourage the TAG to reiterate) uses a hybrid which largely mirrors current practice.  </s>
<s> The idea is to say that ... means 33 ... (the web page) if there is no "#" in the URI and 102 ... when there is a "#".  </s>
<s> (As above, I don't like the "intent" part of 102; I prefer an external formulation like primarySubject, but it can be used like 102.) Beyond this, people can use primarySubject and webAddress explicitely for the less common other cases.  </s>
<s> Let's call this odd hybrid approach #89.  </s>
<s> As in my just-posted message to Roy and the TAG [2], saying a mental model is consistent with previous observations does not mean it is correct or will be consistent with future observations.  </s>
<s> That said, I don't think it is consistent with past observations.  </s>
<s> To rephrase #89: a URI is directly linked to either the container or the subject, depending on whether the URI contains a "#" character.  </s>
<s> If it contains a "#" it's directly linked to subject, and you can't talk about the container or the content.  </s>
<s> I don't think that matches XLink/XPointer or general HTML user experience with fragment identifiers.  </s>
<s> In both these situations, the "container" view still holds quite nicely (although in HTML the end of the container is not clearly specified).  </s>
<s> People certainly talk about the "text at foo#bar", which is a sure sign they are not always jumping straight to the subject.  </s>
<s> That said, as long as we provide a way in RDF to quote a URI string and a predicate to link that string to the container, it's okay to make jumping straight-to-the-subject be the default.  </s>

<s> Sandro,  </s>
<s> Do you have a worked out test case for this, using content negotiation of an image document, rather than a 'real world vs online stuff' scenario?  </s>
<s> I believe many of the same issues arise (w.r.t. '#' etc), but the situation is different in that there could be 3 or more different renderings of the image.  </s>
<s> W3C's logo URI is a good example, since you can get at least two flavours of it from the same URI.  </s>
