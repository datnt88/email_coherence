<s> Personal response: I think you would stand a better chance of getting this proposal through the working group if (a) you stated a justification as to why you think this change is beneficial (don't assume that the benefits are obvious) (b) you made a proposal as to how the language should deal with the resulting "dangling else" ambiguity.  </s>
<s> (For my own part, I would have much prefered a syntax in which expressions were self-closing, e.g. if (Expr) then Expr [else Expr] fi But I lost that battle.  </s>
<s> I don't think it would be a good idea to make "else" optional unless we introduce a mandatory closer to remove the ambiguity.)  </s>

<s> This has been an issue in the past, and the WG decided against it, partly because it causes a choice conflict in the grammar (though this is a common thing with languages, and we can define some rules and live with it), and partly because the if statement has to return something, and so we would have to define the else to return an empty sequence.  </s>

<s> The FLWOR construct is a new syntax which unlike IfExpr is a borrowed grammar.  </s>
<s> FLWOR does not contend with a mindset precedence and I don't think making the else clause optional necessitate a change on FLWOR.  </s>
<s> Making the else clause optional does not in any way make IfExpr any less as an expression.  </s>
<s> Making it mandatory does not enhance its functional value either (even perceptively) but its redundancy becomes a syntactic nuisance.  </s>
