Dan, during the Semweb CG call today [1] you expressed an interest in the RDF+XHTML document type specifying (1) how the RDF is extracted from the XHTML and (2) that the validation service yield triples. 
This exceeds the present "dominant" requirement that "The RDF metadata MUST be well-formed XML but need not be valid XML (RDF validation is left to the discretion of the RDF application.)" 
Did I understand you correctly, and if so can you speak to the motivation for your requirement or provide any pointers to how such a validator could be layered on top of [3] -- if you are familiar with it?

I don't see this as a design requirement, but more of a deployment motivation. 
If there's a service that rewards folks for composing documents the right way, then folks will (more likely) compose their documents the right way. 
If there's a service that shows that RDF consumers should learn from these documents, then RDF consuming software will (more likely) be enhanced to support this syntax. 
Also, if the design is too complex to deploy in our RDF validator, then that says something. Hmm... in a way, it does provide a design constraint: it answers all the questions about whether RDF inside blockquote is to be taken literally or not; i.e. it makes sure the solution addresses the TAG issue Dan Connolly, W3C http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/ 
Not necessarily. 
I haven't seen any evidence that the issue is a compelling requirement in the context of immediate issues we are hoping to address. 
CC, FOAF, Trackbacks, DC all seem most easily addressable by having semantically context free RDF chunks with a properly specified rdf:about attribute. 
Er... hang on; you asked me what my requirement is. 
I told you. 
You can decline to accept my requirement, but you can't deny that I require it. 
I don't expect the TAG to close its issue until there's a design that makes it clear whether RDF inside blockquote is to be taken at face value or not. 
If they do, it'll be over my objection. 
Dan Connolly, W3C http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/ Very well, everybody would appreciate if the TAG clarifies the semantics for embedding RDF in XHTML (and other vocabularies), once and for all. 
May I ask the issue owner to propose a solution?
