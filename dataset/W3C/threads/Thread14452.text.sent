There has been a request for clarification from the Evaluation and Repair tools working group regarding table linearization. 
The group referred to the definition in the glossary of WCAG 1.0, while I thought the interpretation in the Techniques for WCAG 1.0 was preferred. 
Regardless, the two definitions are out of synch and we need to fix that. 
thoughts? 
compare the techniques document Authors should use style sheets for layout and positioning. 
However, when it is necessary to use a table for layout, the table must linearize in a readable order. 
When a table is linearized, the contents of the cells become a series of paragraphs (e.g., down the page) one after another. 
Cells should make sense when read in order (row-wise or column-wise) and should include structural elements (that create paragraphs, headers, lists, etc.) so the page makes sense after linearization.

--wendy wendy a chisholm world wide web consortium web accessibility initiative madison, wi usa The question here is "which definition of linearization is most correct". 
I would think that the one in the WCAG is the better definition. 
First, it lets you know what order (row or column) the cells will actually appear. 
(They will appear in the order they are defined [in the HTML]. ) (Perhaps in the future the phrase "in the HTML" should be added to the text) Second the WCAG says that they must make sense in the order that will result or the order they will appear. 
The techniques doc says that they should make sense in row OR column order. 
Actually, if you define them in row order in HTML, then they would have to make sense in Row order. 
You would no longer have a row or column choice. 
I think this is clearer in the WCAG definition.

--wendy wendy a chisholm world wide web consortium web accessibility initiative madison, wi usa I agree with Gregg. 
The transformation implied by the definition in the WCAG is one in which the table-related elements are eliminated and the content of each TD element (TH elements being excluded by the stipulation that TD cells alone can appear in a table which is used for layout purposes) is placed in a separate paragraph. 
XSL experts in the ER group could no doubt write a transformation that would achieve this effect, without difficulty. 
I agree with Gregg and Jason, too. 
The mention of "column order" in the WCAT is not to be interpreted as describing _web content requirements_. 
User agents may, above and beyond the minimum, provide columwise reading. 
However, the fact that a table makes sense when read by columns does not meet the WCAG test that it has to make sense when linearized by the most elementary, bare-bones transform. 
In this reference algorithm for the content requirement, the paragraphs appear in the same order as in the source hypertext. 
[if we mention HTML it should be by way of example. 
The same principle applies to all XML and SGML applications.] 
On the other hand, I would take exception to the parenthetical remark that there are no header elements in the table to be transformed. 
The algorithm in question should be defined as a transformation on all tables, not a limited kind of special tables. 
Linearization has limited success in keeping the sense of the content clear. 
But that success is not strictly limited to layout tables. 
Some quote data tables unquote will survive linearization just fine. 
But a larger proportion of layout tables will survive this transformation as clear presentations than will data tables. 
Is that the general understanding of the performance we expect?
