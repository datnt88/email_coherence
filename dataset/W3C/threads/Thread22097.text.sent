- Test cases for attributes Text.isElementContentWhitespace and Attr.isId, when transformed to java, appear to get inappropriately prefixed with a "get". 
Is there a fix for this? - Does the test framework support testing methods that either return UserDataObject's or accept UserDataObject parameters. 
For example to test getParameter(...) is something like following valid? 
again possible validation errors -- - Is there any way of specifying more than one acceptable expected exception on a method? 
Thanks, Neil Delima / IBM. 
No, but I knew that this would need to be added since this was a change to the production rules. 
The plan was to add a test and then fix the production. 
Boolean.TRUE is way too much of a Java-ism. 
Write it as expected="true" and I'll make sure the transform and infrastructure do the right thing. 
There is no construct currently to do this. 
If really necessary, we can add one. 
Maybe something like: Do you have any plans to commit these tests? 
Actually, write it as: Attr.isId, Attached is a sample test for isElementContentWhitespace. 
Hope it helps. 
Attached is a sample test case for getParameter. 
A variable of type DOMUserData is being used to store and verify the returned value of this method. 
Would be nice to have a construct like this. 
Attached is a test that can result in different DOMExceptions. 
Yes I plan to commit these, hopefully in the next few weeks. 
Thanks for your help, Neil.

I entered and resolved three bugs (bug 378-380) that should allow the tests in Neil's message of 11/13 to compile. 
DOMUserData did not appear in the enumeration of known datatypes in the DTD and schema, test-to-java did not reflect the new production for attributes starting with 'is' and assertTrue could not accept variable of type Object. 
I have not added a construct for exceptions where the code to be returned is ambiguous.
