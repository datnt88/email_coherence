Folks, Due to the large amount of spam hitting the http-wg mailing list, I propose to make it closed to postings from non-subscribers unless I hear objections to the contrary. 
What this will mean will be that if a posting arrives from an e-mail address that isn't on a list of acceptable addresses, it will be sent to the list administrator (me) instead of being sent to the list. 
I will then either drop it in the bit-bucket (for spam) or send a message to the poster telling them how to post to a closed list (but see below). 
The initial list of acceptable addresses are the addresses that you folks originally subscribed to the http-wg list with. 
If you want to know your subscription address, just ask me. 
What I can do to make this process a little less painful is to keep an additional list of alternative posting addresses for people whose posting addresses are always different from their subscription address. 
For a _small_ while (like about a week or so), I'll attempt to augment this additional list based on the messages that I see bouncing, and then re-submit the bounced message to the list. 
After that time, you can either unsubscribe and re-subscribe to the list from your new posting address, or you can send me personal e-mail and ask for an alternative posting address to be added for you. 
Questions, comments, objections... feel free to e-mail me. 
(The above functionality assumes that I can get Procmail/SmartList to work as advertised. 
If it fails, all bets are off and we can all suffer spam.) (http-wg list maintainer)-- ange -- I prefer STRONGLY that you keep the function of being added to the additional list as a permanent service. 
You may even consider automating it :-) There are all sorts of reasons why people post from addresses other than their listed address, including: - Subaddressing (the + convention) - Travelling - Multiple accounts - Broken mailers that include hostname of workstation And so on. 
Apart from that, I have no objections, just a sad feeling :-( Harald T. Alvestrand Apps AD Maybe i wasn't too clear. 
You can send me an e-mail at any time to have additional posting addresses added. 
The service I was offering for a week or so was noticing failed postings and auto-adding the posters e-mail address to the additional posting address list. 
I don't have the time nor the energy to do this for a longer period. 
;-) Thanks for your input.
