<s> Robert, I am not the expert on CSS, but anyway... Do you have a background color specified for the body?  </s>
<s> If so then it should be inherited, which means the problem is not major, merely one of absolute completeness.  </s>
<s> I will ask the experts tomorrow.  </s>

<s> Robert,  </s>
<s> IIRC, this is only a warning, indicating that you have specified a text colour without specifying a background colour.  </s>
<s> This is to remind you that not everyone uses the default background colours and that your elements may not be visible to some browsers.  </s>
<s> Make sure you specify a contrasting background colour.  </s>
