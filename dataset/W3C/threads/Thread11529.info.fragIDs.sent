<s> I would like to contribute a galician (ISO 639 code 'GL') translation of 'XML in 10 points' (http://www.w3.org/XML/1999/XML-in-10-points)  </s>
<s> I have reviewed and discussed it (not too much text).  </s>
<s> The document attached is 'valid XHTML 1.0 Strict' according to validator.w3.org  </s>
<s> I currently have no persistent place to publish it.  </s>
<s> I wonder if your policy allows to do so in http://www.w3.org/XML/1999/XML-in-10-points.htm as I find many translations there.  </s>
<s> Best regards and congratulatios for the renewal of the W3C translations section.  </s>
<s> Santiago F. L?pez Ponte  </s>
<s> You can store that translation in my webserver where i have several catalan translations if you want.  </s>
<s> Another Good thing you can do is sent that translation to SIDAR.es they have Galician translations for W3C.  </s>

<s> Hi all, Diego is right, I was even preparing a message for Santiago.  </s>
<s> Naturally, in sidar.org will always have space to house translations of documents from the W3C to any language of the Spanish State or of Latinamerica: Spanish or Castilian, Catalan, euskera, Galician, etc.  </s>
<s> Also, we are constituting a group to revise the translations to those languages and this way to be able to, to offer a guarantee of quality in the translations.  </s>
<s> For that reason, I invite to participate in this group to all those that want to collaborate.  </s>
<s> Cheers, Emmanuelle Emmanuelle Guti?rrez y Restrepo Coordinadora del SIDAR You can store that translation in my webserver where i have several catalan translations if you want.  </s>

<s> XML en 10 puntos /XML, XLink, Namespace, DTD, Schema, CSS, XHTML/ ...Se vostede ven de descubrir o XML pode ser dif?cil saber onde comezar.  </s>
<s> Este resumo en dez puntos tenta achegar ao principiante os conceptos b?sicos para que sexa quen de albiscar a fraga entre as ?rbores.  </s>
<s> E si vostede est?  </s>
<s> a preparar unha presentaci?n sobre XML, ?Por que non comezar con estes dez puntos?  </s>
<s> 1. XML serve para estructurar datos Exemplos de datos estructurados son follas de c?lculo, gu?as de enderezos, listas de par?metros de configuraci?n,  </s>
<s> transacci?ns  </s>
<s> financeiras e debuxos t?cnicos.  </s>
<s> XML ?  </s>
<s> un conxunto de regras (tam?n se poden ver coma directrices ou convenci?ns)  </s>
<s> para xerar texto con datos estructurados.  </s>
<s> XML non ?  </s>
<s> unha linguaxe de programaci?n, e vostede non precisa ser programador para empregalo ou entendelo.  </s>
<s> XML facilita que o ordenador xere e lea datos, e garante que as estructuras nas que estes datos aparecen non sexan ambiguas.  </s>
<s> XML evita os erros m?is com?ns nestas linguaxes: ?  </s>
<s> extensible, independente de plataforma, e permite a internacionalizaci?n e maila localizaci?n.  </s>
<s> XML ?  </s>
<s> conforme ao patr?n  </s>
<s> Unicode http://www.unicode.org .  </s>
<s> 2. XML par?cese ?  </s>
<s> HTML Como o HTML, XML usa /marcadores/ (verbas entre os signos ' ' e ' ') e /atributos/ (parellas |nome="valor"|).  </s>
<s> Pero HTML especifica o significado deses marcadores e atributos, e tam?n de que xeito debe presentar o texto entre eles un navegador.  </s>
<s> Pola contra, en XML os marcadores delimitan datos, quedando a s?a interpretaci?n a cargo da aplicaci?n  </s>
<s> que os le.  </s>
<s> Explicado doutro xeito: Se vostede atopa " p " nun arquivo XML non pense que ?  </s>
<s> un par?grafo.  </s>
<s> Dependendo do contexto poder?a  </s>
<s> ser un prezo, un par?metro, unha persoa, un p... (?E qu?n di que ten que ser unha verba cunha "p"?). 3. XML ?  </s>
<s> texto, mais non para ler Os programas que xeran follas de c?lculo, gu?as de enderezos e outros datos estructurados adoitan gravalos en disco empregando formatos binarios ou texto.  </s>
<s> Unha vantaxe do formato texto ?  </s>
<s> que permite ?s  </s>
<s> persoas, se ?  </s>
<s> necesario, ver os datos sen usar o programa que os produciu; ?  </s>
<s> dicir: Vostede pode ler o formato texto cun simple editor.  </s>
<s> Estes formatos tam?n axudan ?s  </s>
<s> programadores a depurar m?is facilmente as aplicaci?ns.  </s>
<s> Do mesmo xeito que HTML, os arquivos XML conte?en texto non pensado para ser lido por persoas, pero estas poden facelo se ?  </s>
<s> necesario.  </s>
<s> En comparaci?n  </s>
<s> co HTML as regras de XML son m?is r?xidas.  </s>
<s> Un marcador esquecido ou un atributo sen comi?as inutilizan un arquivo XML, mais non necesariamente un arquivo HTML.  </s>
<s> A especificaci?n oficial do XML prohibe que as aplicaci?ns  </s>
<s> tenten adivi?ar  </s>
<s> o contido correcto dun arquivo XML errado ou danado.  </s>
<s> Se o arquivo ?  </s>
<s> inconsistente a aplicaci?n  </s>
<s> ten a obriga de parar e amosar un erro.  </s>
<s> 4. XML ?  </s>
<s> prolixo adrede Como XML ten formato texto e emprega marcadores para delimitar os datos, os arquivos XML son case sempre maiores do que ser?an nun formato binario.  </s>
<s> Esa foi unha decisi?n  </s>
<s> consciente dos dese?adores do XML.  </s>
<s> As vantaxes do formato textual son evidentes (ver punto 3) e os inconvenientes poden compensarse normalmente a outro nivel.  </s>
<s> O espacio en disco baixa de prezo a cot?o, e programas de compresi?n  </s>
<s> como zip e gzip http://www.gnu.org/software/gzip/gzip.html poden comprimir arquivos moito e moi r?pido.  </s>
<s> Ademais, os protocolos de comunicaci?n  </s>
<s> dos modems e o HTTP/1.1 ftp://ftp.nordu.net/rfc/rfc2616.txt , o protocolo b?sico da web, poden comprimir os datos en tr?nsito, aforrando ancho de banda cunha eficiencia semellante ?  </s>
<s> dun formato binario.  </s>
<s> 5. XML ?  </s>
<s> unha familia de tecnolox?as  </s>
<s> XML 1.0 ../../../TR/REC-xml ?  </s>
<s> a especificaci?n  </s>
<s> que define o que son as "marcas" e os "atributos"; mais a car?n dela medra a "familia XML", un conxunto crecente de m?dulos que ofrecen servicios ?tiles  </s>
<s> para desenvolver tarefas importantes e decote requiridas.  </s>
<s> Xlink ../../../TR/xlink/ describe un xeito est?ndar de engadir ligaz?ns de hipertexto a un arquivo XML.  </s>
<s> Un XPointer http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-xptr ?  </s>
<s> unha sintaxe en desenvolvemento para se referir a partes dun documento XML.  </s>
<s> Un XPointer lembra a un URL, mais apunta a estructuras de datos dentro dun documento XML.  </s>
<s> CSS ../../../TR/REC-CSS2/ , a linguaxe das follas de estilo, apl?case tanto a XML como a HTML.  </s>
<s> XSL ../../../TR/xsl/ ?  </s>
<s> a linguaxe avanzada ../../../Style/CSS-vs-XSL para definir follas de estilo.  </s>
<s> Est? baseada en XSLT ../../../TR/xslt , unha linguaxe de transformaci?n  </s>
<s> empregada para arranxar, engadir e anular marcas e atributos.  </s>
<s> O DOM ../../../TR/REC-DOM-Level-1/ ?  </s>
<s> un conxunto patr?n de funci?ns  </s>
<s> para manipular arquivos XML (e HTML) dende unha linguaxe de programaci?n.  </s>
<s> XML Schemas 1 ../../../TR/xmlschema-1/ e 2 ../../../TR/xmlschema-2/ axudan ?s  </s>
<s> desenvolvedores a definir polo mi?do as estructuras dos seus propios formatos XML.  </s>
<s> Hai m?is m?dulos e ferramentas dispo?ibles  </s>
<s> ou en desenvolvemento.  </s>
<s> Mant??ase informado na p?xina de relatorios t?cnicos do W3C ../../../TR/ .  </s>
<s> 6. XML ?  </s>
<s> novo, pero non tanto O seu desenvolvemento comezou en 1996, e ?  </s>
<s> unha recomendaci?n  </s>
<s> W3C dende febreiro de 1998, o que lle pode levar ?  </s>
<s> sospeita de que ?  </s>
<s> unha tecnolox?a  </s>
<s> algo inmatura.  </s>
<s> A verdade ?  </s>
<s> que non ?  </s>
<s> recente.  </s>
<s> Antes de XML exist?a SGML, desenvolvida no inicio da d?cada dos 80 e patr?n ISO dende 1986, empregada con amplitude en documentaci?ns de grandes proxectos.  </s>
<s> O desenvolvemento de HTML arrancou en 1990.  </s>
<s> Os dese?adores de XML colleron simplemente o mellor de SGML, guiados pola experiencia co HTML, e produciron algo non menos potente que SGML e de uso moito m?is regular e simple.  </s>
<s> Con todo, ?s  </s>
<s> veces ?  </s>
<s> dif?cil distinguir evoluci?ns de revoluci?ns... E compre dicir que malia ser SGML ?mplamente  </s>
<s> empregado en documentaci?n  </s>
<s> t?cnica, e moito menos noutros eidos, co XML acontece xusto ?  </s>
<s> contrario.  </s>
<s> 7. XML leva o HTML cara XHTML Unha aplicaci?n  </s>
<s> importante do XML ?  </s>
<s> precisamente a linguaxe XHTML como sucesora de HTML.  </s>
<s> XHTML ten moitos dos elementos de HTML, mais a s?a sintaxe mudou un chisco para ser conforme ?s  </s>
<s> regras de XML.  </s>
<s> Un formato que ?  </s>
<s> "baseado en XML" herda a sintaxe de XML e a restrinxe en certos aspectos (por exemplo, XHTML permite " p ", mais non " r "); tam?n engade significado ?  </s>
<s> sintaxe (en XHTML " p " ?  </s>
<s> par?grafo, non prezo, nin persoa, nin outra cousa).  </s>
<s> 8. XML ?  </s>
<s> modular XML lle permite definir un novo formato de documento a partires dun existente ou da combinaci?n de varios.  </s>
<s> Como dous formatos desenvolvidos por separado poden ter elementos ou atributos co mesmo nome d?bese ter coidado cando se combinan (?Significa " p " 'par?grafo' deste formato ou 'persoa' daquel outro?).  </s>
<s> Para eliminar estas confusi?ns  </s>
<s> XML fornece o mecanismo dos espacios nominais D:/TR/REC-xml-names/ (namespaces).  </s>
<s> XSL e RDF http://www.w3.org/RDF/ son bos exemplos de formatos XML que empregan estes espacios.  </s>
<s> XML-Schema http://www.w3.org/XML/Schema foi concibido para reflectir este mecanismo de soporte da modularidade no nivel da definici?n  </s>
<s> de estructuras XML, permitindo combinar dous esquemas nun terceiro ?  </s>
<s> que se corresponder?  </s>
<s> un documento h?brido.  </s>
<s> 9. XML ?  </s>
<s> a base de RDF e da web sem?ntica RDF, a recomendaci?n  </s>
<s> do W3C para "metadatos" (co?ecemento en xeral), ?  </s>
<s> un formato XML para describir recursos e aplicaci?ns a un nivel superior ?  </s>
<s> do HTML, ligando calquera cousa con calquera cousa e asignando nomes a esas relaci?ns.  </s>
<s> Do mesmo xeito que HTML integrou documentos, men?s e formularios na web orixinal, RDF fornece as ferramentas para integrar m?is co?ecemento e nos achegar ?  </s>
<s> web sem?ntica.  </s>
<s> Como pasa cos humanos, que precisan concordar no significado das palabras que empregan para se comunicar, os ordenadores necesitan mecanismos para compartir o significado dos termos que empregan na s?a comunicaci?n.  </s>
<s> As descrici?ns formais dos termos dunha certa area (comercio e manufactura, por exemplo) son chamadas ontolox?as e son unha parte necesaria da web sem?ntica.  </s>
<s> RDF, as ontolox?as, e a representaci?n  </s>
<s> formal do significado, de xeito que os ordenadores podan axudar ?  </s>
<s> traballo das persoas, son temas tratados polo grupo de actividade da web sem?ntica, Semantic Web Activity http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/ .  </s>
<s> 10. XML ?  </s>
<s> de balde, independente de plataforma, e ben soportado Basear un proxecto en XML ?  </s>
<s> beneficiarse dunha grande comunidade de ferramentas e de desenvolvedores experimentados nesa tecnolox?a;  </s>
<s> esta comunidade de recursos, que medra a cot?o, pode xa conter unha soluci?n  </s>
<s> parcial ou total para tal proxecto.  </s>
<s> Elixir XML ?  </s>
<s> dalg?n xeito como escoller SQL no eido das bases de datos: Tense que constru?r a BD e mais a aplicaci?n,  </s>
<s> pero existe xa moito c?digo dispo?ible, e moitos t?cnicos que lle poden axudar.  </s>
<s> E por ser XML de licencia libre pode constru?r  </s>
<s> o seu propio software arredor del sen pagar un patac?n a ningu?n. O soporte grande e crecente significa que vostede non se ten que comprometer cun s? vendedor.  </s>
<s> /XML, ainda que non sexa a mellor soluci?n,  </s>
<s> merece ser considerado./  </s>
