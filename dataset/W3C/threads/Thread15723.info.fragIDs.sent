<s> It's impossible.  </s>

<s> 1. Policy issues like this question are just what we created the Evaluation and Repair Interest Group to consider.  </s>
<s> If there is a lot of follow-up, you may want to take the conversation there.  </s>
<s> 2. It is sooo great that the _one person_ in the unverse who understands that the notion of a "site" is unnatural for the Web is the keeper of the _relativity_ web presence!  </s>
<s> Actually, TimBL understands, too.  </s>
<s> But many people don't.  </s>
<s> Site-think is a triumph of pre-existing culture with a strong undercurrent of hierarchy over the flat, peer-heavy legacy from the Internet to the Web. 3. However, until somebody from Bobby tells you otherwise three times [actually, they are most cooperative] to the contrary, please proceed to apply the site-qualification rule as if "site" is any collection of web pages which: a) evaluated as natural language, address a cohesive topic, and b) evaluated as hypertext fragments, implement a consistent policy of navigation-aid linking so that a visitor is unlikely to get lost, and can easily contact a person or business entity who will take responsibilty for the content of the pages.  </s>
<s> Most people think of a site as a hierarchical realm in URL space, but the above definition allowing general graphs of pages is more appropriate because intentional, cohesive "web presences" can and sometimes should be constructed which span DNS nodes and have arbitrary shapes in URL space.  </s>
<s> But if the user can't find themselves when lost by truncating the URL of the current page, you have to be scrupulous about your navigation aids.  </s>

<s> Hi, Let me try to explain the logic from my prospective as part of the Bobby team.  </s>
<s> There is a real struggle (which I hope ER-IG will address) between webmasters' need for a quick binary (yes/no) answer, and the true definition of accessibility.  </s>
<s> When we talk about accessibility, we first have to ask for whom and with what, because the definition of accessibility is dependent on those factors.  </s>
<s> The guidelines group has addressed this issue with the interim/future distinction.  </s>
<s> There are also questions of how many errors of what kind constitute a failure.  </s>
<s> We started Bobby as a tool to assist web developing in creating accessible web pages.  </s>
<s> It was not our intent to create a "validator".  </s>
<s> Over time, however, Bobby has become the place people look to as a benchmark for accessibility.  </s>
<s> That is a difficult place to be in.  </s>
<s> We have always said, and continue to say, the Bobby Approved Icon is used at a webmaster's own discretion.  </s>
<s> The webmaster defines what a site is, and whether they should use the Icon.  </s>
<s> We provide "suggested requirements" as a guidepost in the decision.  </s>
<s> As always, we value input and discussion about Bobby and how it works.  </s>
<s> Input from WAI and others can only help us all move forward towards the goal of making a web that is accessible to everyone.  </s>

<s> It is certainly, unfortunately, unlikely to happen fast.  </s>
<s> But...  </s>
<s> When the ER group began as the Ratings and Classification (?) group, one of the ideas behind it was to look at using the PICS rating system to identify accessibility of a 'website'.  </s>
<s> (Much as it is used to identify various features of the content - whether it contains all sorts of things american voters don't want their kids to see, whether it conatins educational and canadian content, etc. PICS provides a basic mechanism for specifying in a page which of the things it is linked to are covered by the same rating as the page itself.  </s>
<s> Bobby (and so far as I know) ER have not gone down that path.  </s>
<s> It may be worth revisiting the idea.  </s>
<s> It may be worth telling your University (as I told mine, not that they were very interested) that the icon won't go on until it is done.  </s>
