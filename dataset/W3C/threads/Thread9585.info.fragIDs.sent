<s> The current CVS 1.3, Jan having just changed it is not correct.  </s>
<s> It uses rdf:ID to identify the object of the statement of the property element some:prop.  </s>
<s> This is incorrect, rdf:ID on a property element always identifies the reified node.  </s>
<s> A blank node is generated in such cases, when there are property attributes.  </s>
