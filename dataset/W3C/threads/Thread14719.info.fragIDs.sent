William seams to think we should be discussing EO's Business Benefits of Accessible Web Design on the EO list. 
Item 2 of the agenda, seems to imply that EO want us to discuss it here, and consolidate a response. 
Yes, Judy indicated that EO were looking for a consolidated response, 
if possible, and if not, then at least a formal review and communication from the WCAG working group, preferably before Friday. 
There seems to be a division of opinion on the WCAG list regarding the merits of the EO document. 
We can try to resolve the differences at tomorrow's meeting, and if this proves impossible we can at least indicate both points of view.

Regrets for today's call. 
I have to attend an offsite workshop. 
-Annuska Thursday, 6 December, 21:00 UTC (4 PM US Eastern, 10 PM France, 8 AM Eastern Australia) on the W3C/MIT Longfellow bridge: +1-617-252-1038 In this meeting, as discussed last week, we plan to continue working methodically through the success criteria under each checkpoint, to determine which are satisfactory (clear and testable), and where further work needs to be undertaken. 
Errors, omissions and inconsistencies in the success criteria will also be noted as we examine each checkpoint in turn. 
Last week we concluded our analysis with checkpoint 1.2. 
Regrets for tomorrow's meeting.
