<s> The recent discussions on semantics and UDDI made me wonder about what happens when a query is formulated in terms of a particular ontology, but the registry contains information related to ontologies other than that one.  </s>
<s> I imagine some ontologies are so far apart (e.g. describing completely separate vertical indus tries) that reasoning across them would not make much sense.  </s>

<s> Does anybody know what is the current state of the art in cross-ontologies reas oning?  </s>

<s> Hi Ugo, This idea of making deductive logical inferences across ontologies is one of the principals of the OWL-DL flavor of the language.  </s>
<s> You do it  </s>
<s> by establishing axioms that express equivalencies, sub-class, or other relationships between the two ontologies (or many more ontologies) and use a mechanism such as owl:import to provide a linkage.  </s>
<s> If you have an inferencing technology, then you can maintain logical consistency across these relationships.  </s>
<s> "Closeness" is a matter of interpretation and can be influenced somewhat by the form of the "bridge" axioms expressed.  </s>
<s> If ontologies are far apart -- ie different concepts -- the logic processor would not infer that they represent the same or similar things.  </s>
<s> Note also that in effect you can obtain a chaining effect from the ontologies --- the introduction of a 3rd ontology only requires bridging axioms to some of the concepts in 1 of the previous two ontologies, and so on.  </s>
<s> So you are protected from an N-squared mapping problem.  </s>
<s> The state of the art is that these systems are available.  </s>
<s> The notion of federated or composite ontologies is directly instrumented in the OWL language.  </s>
<s> Our company ships an OWL-DL suite that provides this capability, as well as authoring tools and aids that help to provide these "bridging" statements.  </s>
<s> Hope this helps.  </s>

<s> Actually, I'll make the stronger claim that this is true for all flavors of OWL.  </s>
<s> What sort of inferences OWL Full supports is a trickier question :) Via the LBase translation, you may well get all sorts of deductive inferences, assuming you can pile enough metamodeling and mapping axioms ontop.  </s>

<s> There's also a fair bit beyond this in the current Description Logic Literature alone, e.g., concept unification and matching, concept approximation, Description Logics with similarity (see wolter-2.pdf), distributed description logics (http://citeseer.nj.nec.com/504663.html), and cross connections between kbs with differently expressive concept languages (http://sunsite.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/Publications/CEUR-WS/Vol-81/  </s>
<s> wolter-1.pdf).  </s>
<s> Aside from more or less straight forward deductive (and related) logical reasoning, there's some thought that "linking" between ontologies (and kbs, and other things) might have some useful semantic significance.  </s>
<s> This is a rather fluffier notion.  </s>

<s> I mean, the simplest reading of "reading across ontology" compatible with all that Jack wrote is fairly trivial (i.e., reasoning across concept heirarchies partial defined in many files owned by diverse, non-coordinated authors; of course, such reasoning may often be uninteresting).  </s>

<s> This assessment is overly pessimistic.  </s>

<s> In most cases the  </s>

<s> * One ontology uses a predicate with n arguments where the other uses a similar predicate with n+1.  </s>
<s> The missing argument must be deleted or inferred somehow.  </s>
<s> * and so forth  </s>
<s> Translating back and forth can be done by straightforward deductions.  </s>
<s> Perhaps you meant merely to say that the deductions would end up consuming exponential amounts of time.  </s>
<s> (Which is _not_ the problem with translating between two natural languages, such as English and Japanese!) You may be right, but it's not obvious.  </s>
<s> Or maybe you meant to say that the translation rules could not be generated automatically.  </s>
<s> I agree with you there.  </s>

<s> To answer Bijan's question:  </s>
<s> I do not have the energy to prove this, but there is an analogy with the halting problem.  </s>
<s> The corollary to the halting problem is, of course, that any *given* program/data set pair can be checked to see if it halts (by simply running it).  </s>
<s> In the case of Ontologies, I think that in practice it makes a significant difference to map a single query from one Ontology to another; compared to translating the entire ontology.  </s>
<s> The reasoning is  </s>
<s> that in mapping a single query you are projecting a one-dimensional vector from the foreign ontology to the target ontology.  </s>
<s> In simpler terms, you only need to verify the relatively small fragment uncovered by a query is correctly interpretable in the target ontology.  </s>
<s> Of course, I am aware that it is possible to construct a query like "tell me all you know" which will reduce to the general case.  </s>
<s> But, again, in practice, this is unlikely.  </s>
<s> A far more likely query is "what does this customer's address" mean in your system?  </s>
<s> That way, if there are concepts in the foreign system that are unknown to the target, then they will not normally 'show up' in the queries originating from the target system.  </s>

<s> What if it halts after the heat death of the universe?  </s>
<s> [snip] Aha! Yes, I totally agree with this.  </s>
<s> I certainly have Jim Hendler dinning "Partial mappings!!!" into my ear constantly.  </s>
<s> There are, of course, loads of issues, but not doing what you don't need to do seems verra wise.  </s>
