<s> Hello, The scope of "rewind" in checkpoint 4.6 was changed from "rewind audio, video, and animations" in the 7 July draft [1] to "rewind to the beginning audio, video, and  </s>
<s> animations" in the 28 July draft [2].  </s>
<s> The change was introduced based on a proposal from Harvey [3]:  </s>
<s> Rewind (to the beginning), or stoppable?  </s>
<s> I suggest instead: Allow the user to advance or reverse, and to rewind to the beginning content that is audio, video, or graphically animated.  </s>
<s> I then commented on this proposal [4] but I don't think we ever resolved to add it to the document.  </s>
<s> And yet it's in the document (I apologize for that error).  </s>
<s> I propose that "rewind to the beginning" be changed back to "rewind", since I believe the intent of the WG was to have VCR-type controls.  </s>

<s> I agree that "rewind to the beginning" is probably not the best statement of the function required.  </s>
<s> I believe that the term "rewind" by itself could be misinterpreted in this regard as being satisfied by a reset to the beginning of the program, so the text of the Recommendation should, close to the statement of the checkpoint if not in it, spell out that this requires progressive but rapid movement of the 'current' index point within the nominal play time axis of the program, and not simply an indivisible leap to the initial point.  </s>
<s> As I understand what you are saying, you mean 'rewind' to be a synonym for "fast reverse" and not "reset to the beginning."  </s>
<s> In fast reverse the 'current' pointer into nominal play time moves back toward the beginning at a fixed high rate and the play can be resumed from any prior point in the playlist or SMIL composite by using this function for the right length of  </s>
<s> time.  </s>
<s> On a physical tape medium, there is no way to reset to the beginning except as the limiting case of "fast reverse."  </s>
<s> The words used as text equivalents for the "  " function may vary between players.  </s>
<s> When the current pointer is just an index into a dataset or random access secondary storage, either a rapid sweep back to the starting point or an instantaneous jump there is possible.  </s>
<s> Because the instantaneous reset is an option in our technology, we have to be clear about what we want.  </s>
<s> I believe that for a digital talking book the "fast reverse" function is viewed as a basic requirement.  </s>
<s> What about the controls that one gets with QuickTime, RealPlayer, and Windows Media Player?  </s>
<s> Is there a common core of tape-like functions?  </s>
<s> If there is a central tendency among the available players that meets our needs, we should align our definition with that, not just invent one.  </s>
<s> Al  </s>
<s> Windows Media player offers both: rewind a little, rewind to the beginning (according to the help documentation) RealPlayer offers rewind a little (but there is buffering).  </s>
<s> To go back to the beginning, you stop the stream, then hit play.  </s>
<s> QuickTime player on Windows offers three functionalities (for both forward and reverse directions): a) Back to beginning/end b) Step back/forward c) Fast reverse/forward.  </s>
<s> Since the "fast reverse" functionality is implemented by at least these three tools, I think we should change checkpoint 4.6 to read "start, stop, pause, resume, fast advance, and fast rewind audio, video, and animations".  </s>
<s> We can define "fast advance" and "fast rewind" in the techniques document and say, for example, that the speed of the advance/rewind may vary based on how long the user requests it, etc.  </s>
<s> - Ian P.S. I would like to find more implementation information on audio and animation support.  </s>

<s> HB: I like that, but would edit: "start, stop, pause, resume, fast advance, and fast reverse content that is audio, video, or animations, or several of these."  </s>
<s> HB: Note: Stop interrupts either fast advance or fast reverse.  </s>
<s> A useful side-effect during the fast motion is the audio and/or video flash-by, since significant clues to position are recognizable, even though the detail is not.  </s>
<s> HB: I have recent experience with the convenience of fast backing up and going forward within a song as well as stepping forward and back song-to-song in an audio CD.  </s>
<s> I can do this both with a portable CD player, and with the PC software Audioplayer 32, that simulates that interface.  </s>
<s> Both show song number, and once started playing the time from start of song.  </s>
<s> Both provide fast slew within a song, in either direction.  </s>
<s> So does my hardware CD player.  </s>
<s> HB: I made a crib-sheet identified all the start times within each song where I had a part, and the words there.  </s>
<s> HB: While memorizing the parts I needed to sing, I'd regularly slew to the desired start time, listen (and sing), then slew back to that start time.  </s>
<s> I'd repeat this process within a song till I knew my part, only listening to that small segment I was learning.  </s>
<s> HB: The VCR-type controls imply a linear medium.  </s>
<s> Stopping before finished works, but it is a nuisance to accurately position.  </s>
<s> I do not believe the intent of the  </s>
<s> WG was to only consider linear medium.  </s>
<s> HB: Continuing my experience above, I also had an audio tape of just the songs we were learning.  </s>
<s> I had no track and time from start indicators in my car.  </s>
<s> I found I could use fast forward and rewind, guessing the time, using as an aid the fast audio, and repositioning by "counting the seconds" at the fast rewind rate to position for repeating a segment.  </s>
<s> HB: The CD example of being able to select a particular song track is more convenient than if it were limited to the linear medium, either VCR-type or audio tape.  </s>

<s> [Note that on the substance of the proposal, Harvey and Ian are in agreement.  </s>
<s> I support that agreement.  </s>
<s> This blast is just an attempt to eliminate the appearance of any opportunity for disagreement by expanding a little on the media vs. HCI theoretical view of these controls.  </s>

<s> of the  </s>
<s> AG:: Hold on a sec.  </s>
<s> Harvey, the requirements to support certain minimum linear-metaphor control functions does not limit the medium overall to be linear.  </s>
<s> The digital talking book has that requirement.  </s>
<s> You have to be able to play a whole book with one button press.  </s>
<s> But not every resource will be that way.  </s>
<s> On the other hand, every multimedia presentation boils down to voxels in at most four dimensions as it is being presented.  </s>
<s> Only one of these is time and time always has an understood forward and backward direction to it.  </s>
<s> The time model of SMIL always resolves to a single time axis against which all the components are lined up as they cross the human:computer interface.  </s>
<s> So inside any bubble of content that has a continuous-play mode of presentation, there is a time axis and the controls manipulating the location on this axis relate to a linear space of virtual times.  </s>
<s> The linear metaphor embedded in these controls is in no way a restriction on the multimedia content that is not imposed by physics and human perception.  </s>
<s> The requirement to have controls that relate to this smooth-topology linear model of virtual time is just part of the whole "direct manipulation" strategy -- providing controls in a model as close to the way the user perceives the experience as possible.  </s>
<s> So, yes; we explain how the controls work by analogy to an audio tape player or a VCR if we must.  </s>
<s> But they don't impose a restriction on the multimedia domain; the capitalize on a feature of it.  </s>
<s> Nothing in the control requirements says the physical medium is serial-access or the content is streaming from the source.  </s>
<s> It just talks about the virtual world in which the controls act.  </s>
<s> Ian, By the same token, the medium of "structured audio" the way George Kerscher talks about it is indeed richer than "one linear program."  </s>
<s> But this is more like there is a database that generates lots of query answers or views, each of which is a continuous-play program.  </s>
<s> The linear-time, continuous-play bubble is the multimedia equivalent of the 'page' that we know in the hyper-TEXT web.  </s>
<s> You can at any time activate controls that change the premises and construction of the continuous-play stream.  </s>
<s> But in the context of a continuous-play stream, there is only one time axis and it is smooth and linear.  </s>
<s> And the user needs, where the information is not intrinsically and necessarily real-time in nature, to be able to say things like "Hold on, there.  </s>
<s> Back up a little, like so..." Al  </s>
