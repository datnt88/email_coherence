I'm working on developing some tests for the DOM Level 1 API, and am interested in finding support for it. 
I've already been playing with Internet Explorer Beta 5 -- are there other platforms that might be useful as well?

Those that come quickly to mind include Netscape "Gecko", IBM's alphaworks XML parser, Sun's "Project X", the docuverse.com 
DOM SDK, Object Design's Excelon beta, the Oracle 8i XML parser ... Most of these are pre-release things that require registration as a beta tester or whatever. 
If you can't find them by the usual means, I'm sure I can dig up the URLs.

Mozilla.org has implemented the following DOM levels: level 1 core (interface), level 1 HTML and level 0. (per Vidur's status on 1/29) DOM implementation is a part of NGLayout--the Next Generation Layout engine. 
For writing test cases, you can download the latest (and greatest, not-crashing-on-start-up) builds at: (XP, not just windows) ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla/nightly/ 
*Run apprunner, as it is the newly built app through which these test cases are to be run. 
(previously, viewer and appviewer were used, now--no longer) Vidur Apparao is maintaining the DOM implementation effort for mozilla. 
Vidur's out-dated-but-that-means-the-items-on-here-should-work list at: Current test cases--however, this page probably needs updating: Hope this helps.

It's a kind of moodswing thing. 
And when do you write your best? 
When you're about to burn out." 
We've created an XML and SGML browser based on the Mozilla source and have a demo package which has several nice examples of DOM functionality accessed through JavaScript. 
You just download the browser package, install it, and start the program - the start-up page has links to all the demos. 
I think it is the easiest way to see XML and XML DOM demos in a browser today. 
This "Preview" version of our browser was actually created in December when Mozilla's DOM implementation was not yet complete (and much of the other code was still pretty shaky). 
It is relatively stable though and more stable than what you can download today from mozilla.org. 
We are working ourselves feverishly on the next update which will have the latest code and 100% DOM Level 1. 
Our browser, DocZilla, can be gotten at http://www.doczilla.com. 
The current version is targeted only for NT. 
It works under '95 but we do not encourage its use due to performance-related bugs. 
UNIX versions are planned as well.
