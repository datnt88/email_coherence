A barebones editors work-in-progress for RDFS, with some minimal changes to the description of rdfs:domain and rdfs:range (basically I removed all the cardinality stuff): So I'm stumped for words here. 
We need to improve this language to describe range/domain (intended audience: schema creators and rdf developers not language lawyers) to reflect the new cleaner meaning. 
I don't like the way things are phrased here ('must') as has overtones of DTD-style validation instead of more neutrally describing the meaning of range/domain. 
Here's all I currently have (trimmed down version of old CR 1.0 spec): 3.1.3. 
rdfs:range An instance of ConstraintProperty that is used to indicate the class(es) that the values of a property must be members of. 
The value of a range property is always a Class. 
Range constraints are only applied to properties. 
Constraints on rdfs:range The rdfs:domain of rdfs:range is the class rdf:Property. 
This indicates that the range property applies to resources that are themselves properties. 
The rdfs:range of rdfs:range is the class rdfs:Class. 
This indicates that any resource that is the value of a range property will be a class. 
3.1.4. 
rdfs:domain An instance of ConstraintProperty that is used to indicate the class(es) on whose members some specified property can be used. 
Constraints on rdfs:domain The rdfs:domain of rdfs:domain is the class rdf:Property. 
This indicates that the domain property is used on resources that are properties. 
The rdfs:range of rdfs:domain is the class rdfs:Class. 
This indicates that any resource that is the value of a domain property will be a class. 
suggestions to the mailing list please! 
Dan It seems to me that you're trying to say something like: 'rdfs:domain' and 'rdfs:range' is applied to an rdf:Property to state additional information about the subject and object of any [statement] containing that property. 
Specifically, 'rdfs:domain' indicates a class of which any such subject is an instance, and 'rdfs:range' indicates a class of which any such object is an instance. 
(For [statement], replace appropriate terminology from outcome of recent discussions.) #g Graham Klyne MIMEsweeper Group Strategic Research http://www.mimesweeper.com 
That reads OK to me, apart from the ConstraintProperty (Havn't we decided to trash ConstraintProperty ?). To avoid the imperative sound of 'must', phrase it thus, maybe?: rdfs:range Applied to a property, rdfs:range specifies a class that the values of the property are known to be in. 
OR: ...that contains all the values of the property. 
You might also add: If several such classes are specified, any value of the property must be in all of them.
