<s> Hi Folks - I have been responsible for a project, which has just been completed, attempting to get a "macroscopic" view of the state of accessibility of web sites operated by Irish organistations; or, more precisely, the state of engagement with WCAG 1.0 guidelines.  </s>
<s> The project was carried out with generous sponsorship from AIB Bank PLC.  </s>
<s> The results of our initial work are being formally launched this evening (Dublin, 18.00 UTC).  </s>
<s> You can find the official press release here: In brief - and I guess to the surprise of few on these lists - 94% of the sample showed at least one WCAG-A failure; 100% showed at least one WCAG-AA failure.  </s>
<s> What we have done is extremely crude, and subject to many limitations and qualifications; notwithstanding that I believe it may provide a benchmark which will be useful in developing public policy (in Ireland, and perhaps elsewhere).  </s>
<s> A summary report is available at this URL: The detailed explanation of the project runs to 81 printed pages, or 350 KBytes of download; but is available to enthusiasts at this URL: I would, of course, be greatful for any comment - whether positive or critical - on this work.  </s>
<s> On a subsidiary point, I'd also, of course, like to hear if anyone has accessibility problems or comments about the overall site hosting our work, at this root URL: Best wishes, - Barry.  </s>
<s> Ooops: the URL in my previous message for the detailed report on the project was wrong (it was a duplicate of that for the short, summary, report); the correct URL for the detailed report is: Again, at 350 KByte this is a moderately large document, and may take a while to download, depending on your network connection.  </s>

<s> Hi Barry,  </s>
<s> This is an interesting report.  </s>
<s> A couple of quick observations:  </s>
<s> I thought that the report very clearly identified the limitations of the methodology and how valuable this kind of work can be despite those limitations.  </s>
<s> That struck me as a very valuable part.  </s>
<s> It would have been good to have an analysis of when tests were 'not applicable' - for example approximately 1/3 of sites had problems with the way they used frames, but it is not clear in the report if that is all the sites that use frames, or if 1/3 of the sites surveyed used frames but didn't introduce the same barriers.  </s>
<s> As the report points out, delimiting what a site is is a tricky business.  </s>
<s> However the use of description and keywords metadata as a key requirement was an interesting choice.  </s>
<s> Do you have any data (or know of any) on what proportion of sites, and what type of sites, don't have these?  </s>
<s> (I imagine it is low, but it is certainly not zero, and I find myself wondering...).  </s>
<s> Thanks (also to the students who worked with you) - I found this a well-thought out and interesting read on a Sunday morning.  </s>

<s> Hi Charles - Thanks for the helpful and constructive feedback For the record, a somewhat more concise and integrated (?) version of the report has now been formally published in the journal First Monday, at this URL:  </s>
<s> That's a fair point.  </s>
<s> Because we just used bobby off the shelf this sort of thing does not fall out automatically (e.g., bobby doesn't generate any diagnostic just for using frames per se, but only for misuse of frames).  </s>
<s> But it should not be too difficult to add some such analysis.  </s>
<s> We'll certainly discuss it in looking at further development.  </s>
<s> We certainly don't have any data on this; and, indeed, in the survey we have just reported on, descriptions and keywords did not really play much of a role - they were referred to only in passing, when we were trying to get a quantitative estimate for the total size of the "Irish Web".  </s>
<s> But they will potentially play a greater role as we look at scaling up, and automated sampling (using, for example, the Open Directory Project database).  </s>
<s> Thanks again, and best wishes to all for the holiday season, - Barry.  </s>
