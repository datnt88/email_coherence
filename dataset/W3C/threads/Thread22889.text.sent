DOM2 doesn't appear to provide any method for determining the position of an event relative to the start of a document, when the page has been scrolled. 
Netscape used a pageX/YOffset property, and Mozilla is implementing this too. 
MSIE uses the scrollTop property. 
(And does anyone know what, if anything, Opera's using...?) Will/can the DOM provide a standard for accessing this basic data, because if browsers provide differing proprietory properties for this data (as is happening right now), then we've immediately lost cross-browser compatibility.

A full DOM is not expected until version 5.0, so my guess would be that it is not using anything right now. 
--Lars M. DOM2 has no concept of scrolling. 
DOM3's "Views" chapter may address this.
