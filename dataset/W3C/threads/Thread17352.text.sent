2 is too odd and 3 might be a bit lacking for some.

Search - Find what you're looking for faster Hello Lisa Marie, Thanks for your input. 
As you are an Accessibility Coordinator at a school, do you know what link text would be preferred by people who uses a braille- or screen reader? 
Also, would you use other link text than my three suggestions? 
Clarification SUGGESTION 2 (I omitted the 'type' attribute.) Regards Thomas Jedenfelt Do you Yahoo!? Yahoo! 
Search - Find what you?re looking for faster Below E-mail was sent to me on 10-Mar. 
Many sites give (their estimate of) download time, rather than play time. 
Since your largest files are not the longest, I assume you gave playing time. 
I would use: 1. Blackbird__[1 minute MP3, 100 KB] but keeping the redundant "Audio File" or "Blackbird Song" might still make sense for some audiences. 
Do you Yahoo!? Yahoo!

h2 MP3 files /h2 [which are by definition audio, and everybody knows that] li a href="" title="MP3, 100 K" type="audio/mpeg3" id="" Blackbird /a (100 K, 1 min.) /li li a href="" title="MP3, 200 K" type="audio/mpeg3" id="" Magpie /a (200 K, 2 min.) /li li a href="" title="MP3, 50 K" type="audio/mpeg3" id="" Nuthatc /a (50 K, 30 sec.) /li li a href="" title="MP3, 40 K" type="audio/mpeg3" id="" Robin /a (40 K, 40 sec.) /li Or you could put duration in the title="" and size in parens.

Author, _Building Accessible Websites_ It depends on the context, but you wouldn't want the size and format as part of the text unless you were offering different formats and different bit rates for the same recording (or for different recordings but you expected them to be chosen on those attributes, rather than the contents. 
The most important part of the link text is the name of the bird, although you seem not to consider it part of the link text at all! 
If these were used in a true hypertext context, I would expect something like [] marks the link: The [sound of a blackbird] is.... However it looks like you are presenting a menu, not using hypertext, so one would expect shorter link text as most should be implied by the context. 
You can put more information in a title attribute, but note that some browsers will use the title attribute in preference to the link text, in lists of links, at least until they have seen the referenced resource, so it should make sense on its own.
