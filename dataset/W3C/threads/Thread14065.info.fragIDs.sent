hi, check out this page and let's discuss the technique they use to create short cut keys. it seems to work very well. 
to find out about how to use the page, check out the home page is --wendy 
Dear Wendy et al., It is, um, "interesting" for sure. 
It worked nice on my first pass and my first response was "WOW! 
How did they get ACCESSKEY to do that?" 
This is "just" stupid javascript tricks, which is not covered by the WCAG. 
The page is not nearly as function with Lynx or older browsers. 
The page is P1 compliant at best, since it does not parse through the W3C validator. 
Really it is not P1 either, since in a few places the ALT reads like "looker.gif (1665 bytes)" for the graphical horizontal rule (and a few other places too). 
At the very least, the Keyboard Navigation section of accessinfo.htm should have a disclaimer that the hot keys only work with the 4x (?) versions of IE and Navigator. 
Boy, am I a wet blanket or what?

Bruce, I hadn't looked at the rest of the page for accessibility, but thanks for pointing out that it's not. 
I was just passing on an interesting use of javascript and "accesskeys". 
Note that the example has implications for browsers like opera that use keys without modifiers for browser navigation and to change user preferences. 
for example, opera uses the "e" and "d" keys to move forwards and backwards through elements, and "g" to turn graphics on and off. 
"r" is used to reply to news articles. 
which is too bad because i thought it worked really well (using netscape). 
just fyi - the short cut key puzzle continues.

Bruce, Thanks for including me in your discussion of my web-site and its use of "shortcut keys". 
I completely agree with you in regards to the javascript technique that I employed. 
It does not work with older, non javascript enabled browsers (including IE 3.0 which has some javascript capability). 
Nor does it work with Opera as Opera's own keyboard shortcuts take precedence. 
Please note, however, that I did spell out these limitations in the paragraph preceeding the shortcut key list on the accessibility information page. 
On further review however, I noticed that I included IE 3.0 and Opera in my list of working browsers. 
I have removed them from the list. 
I intended this feature simply to be value added for those with a newer browser. 
It seems the search continues for accesskey solutions. 
If you come across a more universal solution please forward it. 
I do want to thank you for alerting me to the missing alt tags on my site. 
Seems I had done some updates and neglected to check that the alt tags remained in place (I just assumed they had). 
Thankfully, the issue was related to a very few pages. 
I've remedied the error. 
Thanks again for the feedback, Jim Sandstrum Colorado Assistive Technology Project
