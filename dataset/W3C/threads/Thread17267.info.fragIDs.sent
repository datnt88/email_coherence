<s> What is the best way to code a return link from a longdesc image description document?  </s>
<s> An obvious solution is to use JavaScript, but the user may have switched off JavaScript, or the screen reader may not support it.  </s>
<s> Is it sufficient to suggest the user should hit the back arrow or back key combination?  </s>

<s> Nick, Window-Eyes 4.5 will bring up long descriptions in a new browser window, so as not to interrupt the flow of the current page (although having to traverse to a new window does cause some interruption, the user can always go back to the original page, and leave the long description up in the background.).  </s>
<s> So an ALT-LEFT wouldn't do much for them in this case.  </s>

<s> A technique that I have used is to put the longdesc text at the very bottom of the page, like this:  </s>

<s> longdescs should be separate files.  </s>
<s> It's too easy to get lost in a single document, whether a main document plus descriptions or a single page of every long description on a site.  </s>
<s> This of course increases the already-massive inconvenience of longdesc.  </s>
<s> Also, I've never seen the suggested technique before: longdesc="#text1".  </s>
<s> No doubt it works, but canonically longdesc refers to a separate file.  </s>
<s> Or at least that has been the interpretation; the spec is actually neutral on that topic.  </s>
<s> a name='img1' /a img ..... longdesc='#text1' /  </s>
<s> You don't have to use an a anchor.  </s>
<s> Just add an id to the img and use the img itself as the anchor.  </s>
<s> Let's be more semantic.  </s>
<s> I have, of course, an entire section in the "Image Problem" chapter of my book on linking back from a longdesc.  </s>
<s> I think I could have taken my own more-semantic advice there.  </s>
