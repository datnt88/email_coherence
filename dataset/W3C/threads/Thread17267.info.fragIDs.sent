What is the best way to code a return link from a longdesc image description document? 
An obvious solution is to use JavaScript, but the user may have switched off JavaScript, or the screen reader may not support it. 
Is it sufficient to suggest the user should hit the back arrow or back key combination?

Nick, Window-Eyes 4.5 will bring up long descriptions in a new browser window, so as not to interrupt the flow of the current page (although having to traverse to a new window does cause some interruption, the user can always go back to the original page, and leave the long description up in the background.). 
So an ALT-LEFT wouldn't do much for them in this case.

A technique that I have used is to put the longdesc text at the very bottom of the page, like this: 
A description of the picture Cheers M Matthew Smith Kadina Business Consultancy South Australia 
longdescs should be separate files. 
It's too easy to get lost in a single document, whether a main document plus descriptions or a single page of every long description on a site. 
This of course increases the already-massive inconvenience of longdesc. 
Also, I've never seen the suggested technique before: longdesc="#text1". 
No doubt it works, but canonically longdesc refers to a separate file. 
Or at least that has been the interpretation; the spec is actually neutral on that topic. 
a name='img1' /a img ..... longdesc='#text1' / 
You don't have to use an a anchor. 
Just add an id to the img and use the img itself as the anchor. 
Let's be more semantic. 
I have, of course, an entire section in the "Image Problem" chapter of my book on linking back from a longdesc. 
I think I could have taken my own more-semantic advice there.
