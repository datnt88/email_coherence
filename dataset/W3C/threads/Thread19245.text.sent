the download and the install procedures went very smooth this time. 
Unfortunately there are some bugs remaining that had been reported in version .2 1] cache directory name will not allow spaces in folder name. 
For example i want to use c:/Program Files/Amaya/blahblah to associate the cache with the Amaya stuff. 
each attempt to save this removes the space so i get a new folder called programfiles 2] the default background color (light-grey) is still not rendered correctly in a 256 color pallette [not everyone has tru color pallette available and 256 color should be tested as well as 640x480] it turns out white with blue dots...... several other colors are not handled well either. 
3] My site starts with a frameset page. 
This doc verifies under tidy.exe as a 4.01 frameset but does not display correctly with Amaya. 
There are many sites out there with frames and frames is not a new concept so it is surprising that it can't be interpreted...... john russell VE3LL@RAC.CA homepage: http://web.cgocable.net/~jrussel 
Hello John, Are you sure about the cache directory? 
I made the change myself. 
Shouldn't your directory say: c:\Program Files\Amaya\blahblah If you change to "\" and it still doesn't work, culd you search for your thot.rc file (not the one in Amaya\config, but elsewhere) and mail it to me? 
Thanks, -Jose In-reply-to: Your message of Thu, 16 Dec 1999 15:47:33 -0400." 
ATTENTION: The 2.3 version is not officially out. 
We're still in beta test!!! 
It will fixed in the 2.3 official release. 
That depends on the current state of your computer. 
If you have a set of icons displayed on your screen you quickly saturate the 256 color palette. 
Amaya has an algorithm to get an approximate color when it cannot obtain the requested one. 
Of course the result depends on the current set of allocated colors. 
Greys are the especially cases where the result could be the most surprising. 
Frames support is not our priority. 
Thanks for the report. 
Irene.
