<s> Hello, I just got off the phone with the woman who has been trying to get us hotel rooms for the AOL face-to-face meeting.  </s>
<s> She has secured rooms (I think at a Holiday Inn) at $109/night.  </s>
<s> That's the AOL rate.  </s>
<s> Apparently there are very few rooms available at this time in the area and these rooms may be smoking rooms (although we are trying hard to get non-smoking rooms).  </s>
<s> I've reserved singles for the following people, the nights of 15 and 16 November: Eric Hansen Denis Anson Rich Schwerdtfeger Gregory Rosmaita Ian Jacobs Jon Gunderson Please let me know quickly whether anyone else needs a room (or someone in the list doesn't).  </s>
<s> I'll have more details about the hotel once the reservations have been confirmed to me by the person at AOL who's helping us out.  </s>
<s> Thank you, - Ian Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org) http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs Cell: +1 917 450-8783  </s>
<s> Hi Ian, Do I need to call and have my room reserved with my credit card?  </s>
<s> If so, please email me the confirmation number and phone number and I will do it.  </s>
<s> Thanks for holding the rooms.  </s>
