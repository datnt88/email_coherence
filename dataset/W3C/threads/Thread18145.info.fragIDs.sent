Hello, I just got off the phone with the woman who has been trying to get us hotel rooms for the AOL face-to-face meeting. 
She has secured rooms (I think at a Holiday Inn) at $109/night. 
That's the AOL rate. 
Apparently there are very few rooms available at this time in the area and these rooms may be smoking rooms (although we are trying hard to get non-smoking rooms). 
I've reserved singles for the following people, the nights of 15 and 16 November: Eric Hansen Denis Anson Rich Schwerdtfeger Gregory Rosmaita Ian Jacobs Jon Gunderson Please let me know quickly whether anyone else needs a room (or someone in the list doesn't). 
I'll have more details about the hotel once the reservations have been confirmed to me by the person at AOL who's helping us out. 
Thank you, - Ian Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org) http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs Cell: +1 917 450-8783 
Hi Ian, Do I need to call and have my room reserved with my credit card? 
If so, please email me the confirmation number and phone number and I will do it. 
Thanks for holding the rooms.
