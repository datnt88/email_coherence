Hello: I am wondering if I could get feedback on these issues below: As far as anyone knows are there any devices, such as PDAs ,Cell phones etc that are built for people with disabilities? 
And, does the section 508 law require mobile devices to comply?

I have forwarded your question to Doug Wakefield, who is one of the folks leading up the effort for the Access Board. 
I have asked if there has been consideration for a FAQ page or way to submit questions. 
I am seeing many more questions on 508 and fear folks may be speaking for the Access Board with having permission or being half right or whatever. 
I would rather err on the side of caution and prefer to have an official opinion rendered from the Access Board. 
We can discuss this but I am not the authority ? the access board is.

That's an excellent point -- the W3C is _not_ responsible for Section 508 compliance, and yet many people ask for "official" answers on the WAI lists. 
The definitive word on 508 has to come from the Access Board, not the W3C.
