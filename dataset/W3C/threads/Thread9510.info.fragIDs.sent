<s> Jeremy, Aaron, Ron, DanBri, and everybody, The test data that Art collected... Test cases for parseType="Literal" Art Barstow (Mon, Oct 08 2001) shows that RDF implementations are pretty much all over the map on this literal stuff.  </s>
<s> That suggests, to me, that we should chuck it, like we did aboutEachPrefix... but only if nobody's using it.  </s>
<s> So... is anybody using it?  </s>
<s> At the ftf meeting  </s>
<s> you guys told us a little bit about how folks are using RDF... would you please collect some uses cases/test cases that show how folks expect to use parsetype="Literal"?  </s>
<s> Then I think we can decide, as a WG, what the n-triples form should be (or whatever measure of interoperability we choose...).  </s>
<s> I suppose, in addition to the tests art came up with, there's an example in the RDF spec: rdf:Description xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#" xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/metadata/dublin_core#"  </s>

<s> Jeremy, as owner of #rdfms-literal-is-xml-structure, I'd like you to show what the n-triples form of that document should be.  </s>
<s> I've got a proposal, involving exploding it out as infoset properties...  </s>
<s> I think I'll work out the details and put the results on the table.  </s>
<s> Dan Connolly, W3C http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/  </s>
<s> ok... we've decided that rdf:ID="..." is syntactic sugar for rdf:about="#..." and that rdf:li is syntactic sugar for rdf:_N and so on; I suggest that parseType="Literal" is syntactic sugar for a description of a bunch of infoset items; sorta like the way '(a b c) is syntactic sugar, in lisp, for (cons (quote a) (cons (quote b) (cons (quote c) nil))).  </s>
<s> I've implemented the reduction in which is a little wrapper around you can see the mathml example from the RDF spec: reduced to have no parseType="Literal" which reduces straightforwardly to ntriples: Perhaps a simpler example is in order; let's use one of ArtB's test cases... becomes rdf:li xmlns:xia="http://www.w3.org/2000/07/hs78/content.xsl?term=" or, in ntriples: _:a0 http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type http://www.w3.org/2000/07/infoset#InfoItemSeq .  </s>
<s> _:a0 http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#_1 _:a1 .  </s>
<s> _:a1 http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type http://www.w3.org/2000/07/hs78/content.xsl?term=Characters .  </s>
<s> http://www.example.org/  </s>
<s> http://example.org/property  </s>
<s> _:a0 .  </s>
<s> The http://www.w3.org/2000/07/infoset# namespace is a sort of by-product of the XML Infoset spec; we'd have to pick it up (it's a NOTE) and finish it.  </s>
<s> The xia:Characters thingy is a short-cut for individual character information items.  </s>
<s> I've done some work on a version of the infoset schema that exploits DAML+OIL to be more expressive/precise: So... this proposal has answers to all the various details, though if we persue it, we might want to tweak some of the details.  </s>
<s> In particular, any xml:lang info in an ancestor of a propertyElement is lost, but XML namespaces are carried thru.  </s>
<s> (I guess I should cook up some tests to demonstrate that, but I think I'm gonna stop here until I hear more support for persuing this approach).  </s>
<s> Dan Connolly, W3C http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/  </s>
<s> Annotea - the W3C's RDF-based annotations system - uses parseType="Literal" to encode a user's annotation (which can be any HTML).  </s>
<s> Here's an example from the WWW10 paper: p This is an em important /em concept; see  </s>
<s> I authored the RSS Content Module spec[1] which provides the following example of how to include HTML inside an RSS item: content:encoding rdf:resource="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC- xml#dt-wellformed" / rdf:value rdf:parseType="Literal" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" em This is strong very /strong /em strong cool /strong .  </s>
<s> This spec was approved by the RSS WG on 2001-03-01, but despite this I cannot say that I've seen this portion of the spec implemented.  </s>
