My personal interest in MUXing is to re-use a single TCP connection to some MUX port as a mechanism to simulate arbitrary TCP connections to arbitrary ports. 
Put another way (brazenly stolen from Josh Cohen) I should be able to 
replace my TCP/IP stack with a MUX enabled stack and none of my applications should notice any difference. 
In the best of all worlds I would like this issue to be declared explicitly in-scope even if the core MUX protocol doesn't support it. 
For example, I could imagine an extension spec built on top of MUX which would extend the MUX open command to support specifying a TCP port that the particular mux channel that was opened should be treated as speaking over. 
I believe I understand where you are going with the security language and I even think I agree. 
But the current text definitely needs some help. 
However enough people are already beating on you about that one that I'm sure you have gotten the point.

If you have any interest, I'd appreciate your comments. 
Go to http://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP-NG for pointers to the charter and instructions for the mailing list where we're discussing it (ietf-http-ng@w3.org). 
Some discussion has also spilled over to discuss@apps.ietf.org, but please let's henceforth keep it on one list only. 
Thanks, Mike 
Ah. Why would this be an interesting thing to do? 
Actually, I haven't heard from my biggest security critic (Chris Newman) since I made the Feb 12 draft, in which I thought I had managed to say what I think C hris and I are thinking on the issue. 
If you think it *still* needs work, sigh , please say how. 
Thanks, Mike 
OK, does anybody else share this interest?
