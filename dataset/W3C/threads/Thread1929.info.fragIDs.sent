<s> My personal interest in MUXing is to re-use a single TCP connection to some MUX port as a mechanism to simulate arbitrary TCP connections to arbitrary ports.  </s>
<s> Put another way (brazenly stolen from Josh Cohen) I should be able to  </s>
<s> replace my TCP/IP stack with a MUX enabled stack and none of my applications should notice any difference.  </s>
<s> In the best of all worlds I would like this issue to be declared explicitly in-scope even if the core MUX protocol doesn't support it.  </s>
<s> For example, I could imagine an extension spec built on top of MUX which would extend the MUX open command to support specifying a TCP port that the particular mux channel that was opened should be treated as speaking over.  </s>
<s> I believe I understand where you are going with the security language and I even think I agree.  </s>
<s> But the current text definitely needs some help.  </s>
<s> However enough people are already beating on you about that one that I'm sure you have gotten the point.  </s>

<s> Ah. Why would this be an interesting thing to do?  </s>
<s> Actually, I haven't heard from my biggest security critic (Chris Newman) since I made the Feb 12 draft, in which I thought I had managed to say what I think C hris and I are thinking on the issue.  </s>
<s> If you think it *still* needs work, sigh , please say how.  </s>
<s> Thanks, Mike  </s>
<s> OK, does anybody else share this interest?  </s>
