<s> EOWG: One of our agenda items for tomorrow's meeting is a redesigned WAI Flyer.  </s>
<s> (Yes, our meeting is tomorrow even though part of my previous message said Feb. 1; sorry.) We have a redesign of the WAI Flyer to look at.  </s>
<s> This includes most of our comments from last week, but not every bit, as some things worked out differently when putting the redesign together.  </s>
<s> It is available in three versions, all with the same content, but several have slightly different shadings on the half-tone background on some sections.  </s>
<s> We will have some content, contrast, and design issues to discuss tomorrow.  </s>
<s> If possible I would like to wrap up the redesign quickly, and we will very likely do an updated version again in several months.  </s>
<s> A few things about these URI's: 1.  </s>
<s> The design examples are JPG images.  </s>
<s> If you cannot view them in your browser, go to the alternate page I've set up.  </s>
<s> 2. The design example page itself has no alt or longdesc.  </s>
<s> The verbatim content is available on the alternative page.  </s>
<s> 3. There are six images on one page; three small versions and three large versions.  </s>
<s> You'll probably need to zoom out to view them well.  </s>
<s> 4. The design example is a temporary URI; do not bookmark!  </s>
<s> Design examples: http://www.skymedia.com/flyer/  </s>
<s> Alternative page: http://www.w3.org/2001/02/wai-flyer-redesign  </s>
<s> I look forward to your feedback.  </s>

<s> Sorry I missed the discussion about the Flyer this morning.  </s>
<s> My concerns are: 1) are the contrast ranges between the wash-backgrounds and the foreground texts sufficient (I can't tell easily with my monitor), and 2) are the font-sizes chosen for the critical content sufficient (I also can't judge the point-sizes from the images) - I know it ranges from huge (Tim's quote) to tiny (partners and copyright).  </s>
<s> I am somewhat sensitive to font-sizes now as I have recently begun having to carry a magnifying glass in order to easily read small print.  </s>
<s> In my opinion if the information is important enough to put on the page, it should be readable: small print (literally and figuratively) should not be necessary on a public information document.  </s>
<s> All that being said, I kind of like the visual impact of the examples.  </s>
<s> My concern is that the design company's drive to increase the "impact" of the flyer may detract from readability.  </s>
<s> I think that anything that comes out of the WAI should try to weight its design choices on the side of accessibility.  </s>
<s> Regards, Chuck Letourneau  </s>
<s> Sorry I missed the discussion about the Flyer this morning.  </s>
<s> My concerns are: 1) are the contrast ranges between the wash-backgrounds and the foreground texts sufficient (I can't tell easily with my monitor), and CMN White on grey is horrible to try and read.  </s>
<s> White on light blue is too.  </s>
<s> White on dark blue is not so bad.  </s>
