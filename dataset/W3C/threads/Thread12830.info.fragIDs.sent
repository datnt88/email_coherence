EOWG: One of our agenda items for tomorrow's meeting is a redesigned WAI Flyer. 
(Yes, our meeting is tomorrow even though part of my previous message said Feb. 1; sorry.) We have a redesign of the WAI Flyer to look at. 
This includes most of our comments from last week, but not every bit, as some things worked out differently when putting the redesign together. 
It is available in three versions, all with the same content, but several have slightly different shadings on the half-tone background on some sections. 
We will have some content, contrast, and design issues to discuss tomorrow. 
If possible I would like to wrap up the redesign quickly, and we will very likely do an updated version again in several months. 
A few things about these URI's: 1. 
The design examples are JPG images. 
If you cannot view them in your browser, go to the alternate page I've set up. 
2. The design example page itself has no alt or longdesc. 
The verbatim content is available on the alternative page. 
3. There are six images on one page; three small versions and three large versions. 
You'll probably need to zoom out to view them well. 
4. The design example is a temporary URI; do not bookmark!

I look forward to your feedback.

Sorry I missed the discussion about the Flyer this morning. 
My concerns are: 1) are the contrast ranges between the wash-backgrounds and the foreground texts sufficient (I can't tell easily with my monitor), and 2) are the font-sizes chosen for the critical content sufficient (I also can't judge the point-sizes from the images) - I know it ranges from huge (Tim's quote) to tiny (partners and copyright). 
I am somewhat sensitive to font-sizes now as I have recently begun having to carry a magnifying glass in order to easily read small print. 
In my opinion if the information is important enough to put on the page, it should be readable: small print (literally and figuratively) should not be necessary on a public information document. 
All that being said, I kind of like the visual impact of the examples. 
My concern is that the design company's drive to increase the "impact" of the flyer may detract from readability. 
I think that anything that comes out of the WAI should try to weight its design choices on the side of accessibility.

Sorry I missed the discussion about the Flyer this morning. 
My concerns are: 1) are the contrast ranges between the wash-backgrounds and the foreground texts sufficient (I can't tell easily with my monitor), and CMN White on grey is horrible to try and read. 
White on light blue is too. 
White on dark blue is not so bad.
