<s> Unfortunately not.  </s>
<s> You cannot load a subinterface without loading its superinterface(s), so they become part of the source of the program.  </s>
<s> No more so than the programming language's standard libraries.  </s>
<s> Those are used by the open source project, but not distributed with it nor claimed to be part of it.  </s>

<s> At this stage, we 're discussing making the license be a mixture of the standard W3C software license, and the status of the DOM specification, which will probably look like 1) the specification (excluding the bindings) is covered by the W3C document license 2) the bindings are under the software license, with the additional conditions (also that IDL bindings have to change the pragma prefix) Lauren  </s>
