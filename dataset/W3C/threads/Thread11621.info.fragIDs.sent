<s> Hello, everyone, I am new to this list, and I did not see this question in the archives.  </s>
<s> In this question, I will be referring to the French and Spanish translations of XHTML 1.0 which are located at: French: http://www.la-grange.net/w3c/xhtml1/  </s>
<s> Spanish: http://leo.worldonline.es/jlgranad/xhtml/xhtml1.htm  </s>
<s> An object model is a model for an object in any language, I am sure.  </s>
<s> But... In French we have:  </s>
<s> Mod?le Objet de Document HTML = an object model of an HTML document.  </s>
<s> In Spanish we have: Modelo del Objeto Documento de HTML = a model of the HTML Document Object Have I understood these translations correctly?  </s>
<s> Is only one of them correct?  </s>
<s> Is the HTML Document Object Model: (1) an object model of an HTML document; (2) a model of an HTML document object?  </s>
<s> Or, is the translation of this simply language-specific?  </s>
<s> Thank you, - Zeno  </s>
<s> Hi Zeno,  </s>
<s> I don't think both interpretations are so different, DOM is (1) an object model of the HTML document, and assumingthis description in terms of object oriented description, it is (2) a model of the HTML document object.  </s>
<s> Anyway, any suggestion on the translation will be appreciated.  </s>
<s> Thanks, Juan.  </s>

<s> Thank you very much for your prompt response.  </s>
<s> I agree that in English, the distinction is unimportant; the phrase is clear without any analysis.  </s>
<s> However, I wish to translate the phrase correctly, so I must examine such things.  </s>
<s> Please allow me to include the following separate excerpts from the DOM, which have been cut from different paragraphs:  </s>
<s> The Document Object Model provides a standard set of objects for representing HTML and XML documents, a standard model of how these objects can be combined, and a standard interface for accessing and manipulating them.  </s>
<s> The name "Document Object Model" was chosen because it is an "object model" in the traditional object oriented design sense: documents are modeled using objects, and the model encompasses not only the structure of a document, but also the behavior of a document and the objects of which it is composed.  </s>
<s> The structure of SGML documents has traditionally been represented by an abstract data model, not by an object model.  </s>
<s> In an abstract data model, the model is centered around the data.  </s>
<s> In object oriented programming languages, the data itself is encapsulated in objects that hide the data, protecting it from direct external manipulation.  </s>
<s> The functions associated with these objects determine how the objects may be manipulated, and they are part of the object model.  </s>
<s> In the first sentence of the second excerpt, we are told that the name was chosen because DOM is an 'object model'.  </s>
<s> In the last sentence of the second excerpt, we are told that a document may be composed of multiple objects described by the (object) model.  </s>
<s> Because of these two statements, it seems clear that we are not speaking of a 'document object' at all, but an 'object model' describing possibly multiple objects within a document.  </s>
<s> We were discussing the following two possibilities: (1) an object model for an HTML document; (2) a model of the HTML document object.  </s>
<s> Surely, these are different, because from the DOM, we have seen that the second translation must be incorrect.  </s>
<s> There is a third which we were not discussing: (3) a Document Object Model for HTML.  </s>
<s> I think that our remaining (1) and (3) are closer in meaning than (1) and (2).  </s>
<s> In the first excerpt, we are told that "the Document Object Model provides a standard set of objects for representing HTML and XML documents".  </s>
<s> I can find nowhere in the specification where the DOM refers to HTML or XML, only to HTML documents or XML documents.  </s>
<s> Perhaps in an exercise of redundancy, one could say 'the HTML Document DOM' or 'the XML Document DOM', but that would be silly.  </s>
<s> Because of our above discussion of the 'object model' and the pairing of 'HTML documents' and 'XML documents', I believe that (1) is the correct translation (or concept).  </s>
<s> Your comments helped me immensely and I thank you for them.  </s>
<s> If you can see any flaws in my reasoning, please let me know!  </s>
<s> Otherwise, I will go with 'HTML-document object-model' or 'an object model for an HTML document'.  </s>
<s> Thank you, - Zeno  </s>
