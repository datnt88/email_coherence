In other cases, it would make sense to keep the copy that browsers use. 
I've just done a test with p align=X align=Y for each combination of left/center/right, and it appears that Netscape uses the first value Amaya uses the second value ICab uses the first value WebTk uses the second value Emacs/W3 uses the second value Netscape 4.72: uses first MSIE 5.5: uses first Opera 4.02 &amp; 3.62: uses first Maybe someone else can say what IE5 or Opera or Lynx do. 
It's a pity there isn't a common convention, but it is precisely that which tells us there is a real problem that Tidy can help with. 
Add drop-duplicate-attributes: (never|keep-first|keep-last|if-equal) I like this.

I have access to lynx , solaris netscape 6, and solaris ie that I can tes if someone can point me to a page that demonstrates the problem and generates the answer... Never apply a Star Trek solution to a Babylon 5 problem.

Even if explicitly stated to the contrary, nothing in this posting should be construed as representing my employer's opinions.

(1) In the built tree (2) In the pprinted output only There is already a point in Tidy's execution where unknown and duplicated attributes are *detected*. 
That's where GetToken() calls CheckAttributes(). 
The minimal change to Tidy would be to put it in there, so the answer is (1) in the built tree. 
One reason why Tidy does the checking where it does is that there are a number of tidying steps that delete nodes, which would go unchecked if alternative (2) were chosen. 
There's someone here who needs unknown attributes and duplicated values to be removed, so I'm editing away on another machine right now, trying to implement this. 
Unless I've misunderstood something -- and most of the conversation on this list is way above my head, so I wouldn't be surprised -- writing such a page is extraordinarily easy. 
Here's my effort (zipped to shave off 74 bytes), which took me about two minutes.
