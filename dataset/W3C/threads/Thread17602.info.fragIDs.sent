<s> I have been a long time proponent of MSAA because I believe it is an advantage, for the person with a disability, and for the person who is producing assistive technology, to have a common AT interface that crosses all programs rather than "special casing" each possible environment.  </s>
<s> Comment I agree!  </s>
<s> Historically, each time a new version of Word or Word Perfect was released, it broke existing alternative access technologies.  </s>
<s> There would be a mad scramble by the developers of alternative access products to reverse engineer the new input strategy, and release a new version of the product that would communicate with, or work around, the new techniques of accessing the keyboard and screen.  </s>
<s> As a result, people with disabilities were *always* late adopters of new versions of productivity software.  </s>
<s> (For years, Words+ recommended that their customers use Word Perfect 4.2, even after it was no longer available!) Comment Nothing changed really (so far) MSAA promises to be a standard interface that all software can use to communicate with all assistive technology.  </s>
<s> (Note that I say promises, not that it is.) If it is not rich enough to provide necessary information, it can be extended, so that AT can also use new calls to gain a richer environment, without breaking older technology.  </s>
<s> Comment: I think that DOM holds the same promises.  </s>
<s> There is one problem though.  </s>
<s> MSAA in my opinion is a repair strategy, where DOM is potentially a real solution.  </s>
<s> What we need is a globally standard way to build a DOM.  </s>
<s> Then from the DOM we can start rendering for whatever user profile.  </s>
<s> What we do not need is visual rendering with the side effect that it gives you also a DOM-view.  </s>
<s> The ideal DOM is still far away.  </s>
<s> Although I am not a developer, I strongly feel that special casing is a poor design strategy for AT.  </s>
<s> It guarantees that AT will always be behind the curve, and that people with disabilities will not have access to new versions of software that is produced.  </s>
<s> Exposing the DOM is a good idea for a number of reasons, but requiring alternative access devices to treat HTML differently than any other product is, IMHO, inviting a new software ghetto.  </s>
<s> Comment: I feel that the term "exposing DOM" is in a sense a misleading.  </s>
<s> What we want is to use or have a DOM.  </s>
<s> Exposing DOM is not the action we are looking for.  </s>
<s> In this way many exposures of DOM will lead to the same pitfall.  </s>
<s> Every exposure will need developers attention ... Also the term "alternative access" should in my opinion read as just "access".  </s>
<s> Why should access to DOM have a "normal way" and an "alternative way"?  </s>

<s> Hi: Since my name seems to have become somewhat famous as the subject of so many messages in the past few days, I decided I should probably clarify my original answers to John and prove that I can communicate in slightly more than monosyllabic words.  </s>
<s> The preference I express for using a DOM rather than a more generic approach like MSAA stems entirely from the fact that a DOM inherently offers a richer array of information.  </s>
<s> This clearly is a double-edged sword since using a DOM requires additional coding to get at this richer information set.  </s>
<s> However, if the assistive technology tool has a scripting language which allows for accessing this information, then the efforts involved to incorporate it is greatly reduced and can often be done by members of the user community who embrace that tool.  </s>
<s> I am not advocating that MSAA and similar approaches be abandoned.  </s>
<s> Rather, I am saying that approaches to presenting information in uniform manner be based on DOMs.  </s>
<s> (This, as I understand it, is largely the approach MSAA has taken in supporting IE4.) If the accessibility aid wishes to go the extra mile and take advantage of the richer information set provided by a DOM, it should be encouraged to do so.  </s>
<s> In the case of JFW, we have chosen to use the IE4 DOM in an effort to more accurately predict the prompts which are associated with input fields on a form.  </s>
<s> Without access to the the underlying HTML tags, doing this is much more difficult and much more error prone.  </s>
<s> Even if MSAA were to engage in prediction of field prompts on HTML forms, who is to say that all accessibility aids will be happy with the approach that MSAA used.  </s>
<s> By making DOM information available, there exists the chance that some ISVs will go the extra mile and provide a more robust interface than that which is possible using something like MSAA which can probably never be all things to all applications.  </s>

<s> We would certainly include informaton about other accessibility APIs like the Java accessibility tool kit for people developing Java based user agents.  </s>

<s> I agree that we should be concentrating on providing solutions.  </s>
<s> However, I think it has to be said that some of the problems which require solutions arose because the theoretical aspects had not been considered early enough in the process, and people became obsessed with 'solving today's problems' at the expense of careful planning.  </s>
<s> The use of DOM is, in my view, such a case.  </s>
<s> If we expect the DOM to expand its coverage rapidly, and HTML/XML to become an important component of many applications, then planning for the use of DOM may provide great benefit.  </s>
<s> Although it is currently 'the extra mile', as Glen said, the choice of DOM may provide a predictable interoperable interface, which would enable the next x generations of assistive technology to keep pace with applications, instead of forever lagging behind.  </s>
<s> DOM is not the only possible solution, and there is an open issue about whether some of the problems which it may help tackle are within the scope of this group.  </s>
<s> (Personally, I feel that they are.) But it does appear to have great potential as an important part of a good solution strategy for a number of problems.  </s>
<s> I therefore feel that it is worth thinking very carefully about this issue.  </s>
