I'm not getting anything back from the server at annotest.w3.org/annotations at the moment - is it broken? 
Using the interactive service I see "Cannot connect to "DBI:mysql:annotest:localhost:3306 switching to ephemoral DB" Matthew I'm not getting anything back from the server at annotest.w3.org/annotations at the moment - is it broken? 
apparently so. 
mysql was not running so I restarted it but now requests are just hanging. 
I'll poke Eric to have a look. 
There are problems but unfortunately it seems that we need to wait couple of days for Eric to come back to solve them.

I don't know why the myslqd was down, maybe some artifact of the recent power outage, but I prefer a sunspot-related theory. 
It looks like Ralph's observation that the requests were hanging was related to underconstrained queries. 
I addressed this in a post earlier today [1].
