I'm relatively new to the list, so I apologize if this has already made the rounds... Basically I'm wonding how binary objects are to be handled in the DOM. 
Was any consideration given to including a Binary interface derived from Node in Level 1? 
As you can guess, I am concerned that any BLOB that I wanted to store in the object model will double in size (unnecessarily) in a Text or CDATASection node. 
It seems like a Binary node would make sense in the XML level if not in the core, but perhaps people feel this extension belongs at a level that supports data-typing. 
Thanks, Ted This was discussed in Malbourne as part of the discussion about NDATA entities (the only way to get binary data in XML). 
I noted that we probably need to provide some interface for directly accessing the binary data, and I think most people agreed in principal. 
Expect to see something in the next spec. 
I will be revising the stuff on entities, and will take care of this then. 
I would also like to mention that two other developers and I are close to finishing up a proposal for embedding binary data in XML which does not use NDATA. 
We will be addressing the DOM related issues as well once we are done. 
We are just haggling over the proposal name (the effort started off as XML-Binary but the proposal now covers more than just binary data so we are trying to come up with more reasonable name). 
Don't worry. 
We have our eyes on the ball. 
I just wish I knew where the heck I am ;-). 
Regards, Don Park The DOM that we're doing has as requirements XML 1.0. 
Future versions would be nice, but I hope we can get something stable at some stage. 
Which might mean that we need to say "that's good; we'll have to add it later".
