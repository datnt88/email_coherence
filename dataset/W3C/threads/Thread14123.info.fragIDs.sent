Does anyone know of books devoted to designing web sites for either accessibility or usability? 
The only one I know is Crystal Waters "Universal web design". 
Failing that, books with good chapters on accessibility or usability (or bits dotted through the book, like Daggett on html4). 
I know the ig talked about encouraging authors of html 4.0 books to include sections on the accessibility features - is there any evidence that this succeeded?

@ What kind of internet user are you? 
Try out the Internet Activities, @ Attitudes and Addiction Questionnaire (IAAAQ) and receive a @ personal profile of your internet use (and assist in our research). 
There is a book by UIE on usability - have a look at http://www.uie.com 
I haven't read it, but I did looka t the chapter they put online and it looked pretty good.

It's a good book. 
i highly recommend it. 
I've got a copy from 1997. 
It's my understanding that an updated version has come out recently. 
The UIE design newsletter "Eye for design" that is published every other month is also very helpful. 
Several suggestions that they make for good usability are also things that increase accessibility (particularly with navigation, and links). 
In some ancient version of the WCAG, we referenced their work. 
We'll work some of their results back into the Techniques document and reference them. 
It boosts our arguments well.
