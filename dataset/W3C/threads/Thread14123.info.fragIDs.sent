<s> It's a good book.  </s>
<s> i highly recommend it.  </s>
<s> I've got a copy from 1997.  </s>
<s> It's my understanding that an updated version has come out recently.  </s>
<s> The UIE design newsletter "Eye for design" that is published every other month is also very helpful.  </s>
<s> Several suggestions that they make for good usability are also things that increase accessibility (particularly with navigation, and links).  </s>
<s> In some ancient version of the WCAG, we referenced their work.  </s>
<s> We'll work some of their results back into the Techniques document and reference them.  </s>
<s> It boosts our arguments well.  </s>
