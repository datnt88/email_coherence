Kelvin's been brilliant and has got a first version already: Any comments? 
I'll tell him to go ahead tomorrow if people are happy.

Main immediate comment: Can you get him to add back in the http:// prefix? 
SemWeb is pretty URI centric, so encouraging a non-URI way of writing Web addresses is probably a mistake. 
"www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/" - "http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/" belated thought occurs: Hmm I hope all those colourful geo-political boundaries are still timely; my geographic knowledge is so sketchy I couldn't easily check. 
Which bits are former Yugoslavia? 
Czech/(o)Slovakia? 
etc... Dan yes re the first - I was thinking that. 
As for the second - anyone got good geographical knowledge here? 
I can't check easily either since I'm offline most of the time at the moment... Libby ... I've just checked it against two map sites and it seems fine in the "former Yugoslavia? 
Czech/(o)Slovakia? 
etc..." areas. 
Paul prefix? 
Web timely; bits are There is something near Turkey that I don't recognise (I thought it was part of Turkey, but it seems green when the rest of Turkey is yellow). 
Other than that everything seems to be there - Czech Republic is seperated from Slovakia, the various countries that used to make up Yugoslavia are more or less there (I don't know the current status of the Yugoslav federation which last I heard included Serbia and Montenegro), Monaco is squashed by the button for Nice, but that's OK, etc... Looks good. 
Is there room for a stamp and an address, and a couple of lines ("Hi Mum, semantic Web is great - I'm the button with an X drawn on it, miss you" sort of thing)?

Looks good though!

Oh, and the green bit between Greece, Bulgaria and Turkey is more of Turkey, so I guess it should really be green?
