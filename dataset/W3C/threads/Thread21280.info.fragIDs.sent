Hi there! 
I am new to this list, my name is Thomas Bopp and I work at the computer department of the university of Paderborn. 
I am working on a CSCL System called sTEAM (http://steam.upb.de/)- 
structuring information in a team - which includes annotation to 
internal and external documents. 
We experimented with different tools and tried to handle external annotations with proxy-servers, applets and javascript/patching of the original document. 
Since there have been several problems we decided to stick on the server side and support the annotea protocoll. 
Currently I am implementing an annotea server for the Roxen webserver (as a module), but encountered some problems. 
Posting a new annotation does work, but I have some problems updating and deleting it again. 
When I call delete-annotation inside amaya it only deletes the annotation locally, but does not send anything to the webserver. 
Also I noticed there seems to be no menu-item to update an existing annotation. 
When using "Post Annotation" again it sends a "normal" POST to the server creating a new annotation. 
Any Ideas ? 
Thanx in advance, ---Thomas 
Hello Thomas, Welcome aboard. 
When you post an annotation, you change its status from a local one to a server one. 
To modify it, you just need to do a save. 
You have this confusing problem because I didn't add yet (unfortunately) a protection against someone posting twice the same annotation against the same server. 
I'll patch the code to avoid this confusion. 
It's weird that the delete doesn't work. 
It does work for me and that part of the code hasn't changed since the release. 
Maybe you were deleting a local annotation? 
Was your annotation server declared in the configuration file?

Ah, I see ;-) 
Yes, seems like the annotation was local due to a wrong response to the posting. 
I changed the response a little bit and now it works fine ;-) Thanx, ---Thomas
