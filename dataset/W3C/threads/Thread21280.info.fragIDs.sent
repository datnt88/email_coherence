<s> Hi there!  </s>
<s> I am new to this list, my name is Thomas Bopp and I work at the computer department of the university of Paderborn.  </s>
<s> I am working on a CSCL System called sTEAM (http://steam.upb.de/)-  </s>
<s> structuring information in a team - which includes annotation to  </s>
<s> internal and external documents.  </s>
<s> We experimented with different tools and tried to handle external annotations with proxy-servers, applets and javascript/patching of the original document.  </s>
<s> Since there have been several problems we decided to stick on the server side and support the annotea protocoll.  </s>
<s> Currently I am implementing an annotea server for the Roxen webserver (as a module), but encountered some problems.  </s>
<s> Posting a new annotation does work, but I have some problems updating and deleting it again.  </s>
<s> When I call delete-annotation inside amaya it only deletes the annotation locally, but does not send anything to the webserver.  </s>
<s> Also I noticed there seems to be no menu-item to update an existing annotation.  </s>
<s> When using "Post Annotation" again it sends a "normal" POST to the server creating a new annotation.  </s>
<s> Any Ideas ?  </s>
<s> Thanx in advance, ---Thomas  </s>
<s> Hello Thomas, Welcome aboard.  </s>
<s> When you post an annotation, you change its status from a local one to a server one.  </s>
<s> To modify it, you just need to do a save.  </s>
<s> You have this confusing problem because I didn't add yet (unfortunately) a protection against someone posting twice the same annotation against the same server.  </s>
<s> I'll patch the code to avoid this confusion.  </s>
<s> It's weird that the delete doesn't work.  </s>
<s> It does work for me and that part of the code hasn't changed since the release.  </s>
<s> Maybe you were deleting a local annotation?  </s>
<s> Was your annotation server declared in the configuration file?  </s>

<s> Ah, I see ;-)  </s>
<s> Yes, seems like the annotation was local due to a wrong response to the posting.  </s>
<s> I changed the response a little bit and now it works fine ;-) Thanx, ---Thomas  </s>
