<s> Pretty simple question really.  </s>
<s> If I use one of those lousy Macromedia Dreamweaver Menu Behaviors, can JAWS read it?  </s>
<s> The menu is completely generated by Javascript, so there is nothing in the markup but a bunch of JS.  </s>
<s> I am working on something that I inherited, and it uses one of these menus, which I personally can't stand.  </s>
<s> If it would help for me to post a sample online, I can.  </s>
<s> I just thought that it might be a common enough question that someone with JAWS could answer right away.  </s>

<s> It prob won't work with Jaws, but I can't say for sure.  </s>
<s> Please post the  </s>
<s> pointer to the example &amp; I'll give it a shot.  </s>

<s> This page has a similar type of menu.  </s>
<s> There should be sub-options under "home &amp; health."  </s>
<s> David Poehlman sent me the JAWS output yesterday and they weren't there.  </s>
<s> I could handle using a Javascript menu like this, but only if it uses DOM to manipulate a UL with nested lists.  </s>
<s> At least that way the menu options would be read by Lynx or JAWS.  </s>
