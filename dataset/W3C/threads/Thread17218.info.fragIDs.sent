Pretty simple question really. 
If I use one of those lousy Macromedia Dreamweaver Menu Behaviors, can JAWS read it? 
The menu is completely generated by Javascript, so there is nothing in the markup but a bunch of JS. 
I am working on something that I inherited, and it uses one of these menus, which I personally can't stand. 
If it would help for me to post a sample online, I can. 
I just thought that it might be a common enough question that someone with JAWS could answer right away.

It prob won't work with Jaws, but I can't say for sure. 
Please post the 
pointer to the example &amp; I'll give it a shot.

This page has a similar type of menu. 
There should be sub-options under "home &amp; health." 
David Poehlman sent me the JAWS output yesterday and they weren't there. 
I could handle using a Javascript menu like this, but only if it uses DOM to manipulate a UL with nested lists. 
At least that way the menu options would be read by Lynx or JAWS.
