<s> Hi I'm not sure what is going on here.  </s>
<s> We have the following code segment String xmlSid = SessionManager.createNewSession("edmunds",  </s>
<s> "0"); StringBufferInputStream sbisd = new StringBufferInputStream(xmlSid); InputSource isid = new InputSource(sbisd); Element sessionInfo = this.xspParser.parse(isid).getDocumentElement();  </s>
<s> This returns us the correct Element, however when we work through the Element to get the required node, it has ELEMENT_NODE type, this means we can't retrive the value the Element looks like the code we use to try and get the value is NodeList sessionTag = sessionInfo.getElementsByTagName("*");  </s>
<s> Node st = sessionTag.item(0);  </s>
<s> String sid = st.getNodeValue();  </s>
<s> However as I said the Node st is of type ELEMENT_NODE, I seem to have no control over this, what can I do to ensure its a text node, which it looks like to me?  </s>
<s> Cheers Andrew  </s>
<s> An element has no nodeValue.  </s>
<s> You have to navigate down one more level, to the element's children -- which, for your SESSIONID and COMMUNITYID tags, will be a single Text node whose value is the string you're looking for.  </s>
<s> DOM Level 2's Range and Traversal chapters may be useful in gathering larger chunks of text.  </s>
<s> In particular, I believe Range has an operation that retrieves all text within that Range.  </s>
<s> But that does require creating and using another object.  </s>
<s> "Text Node Amelioration" (generally, gathering the text contained in a subtree) is an open issue for DOM Level 3 and later.  </s>
<s> There are some disagreements about how much more is needed, and exactly how it should behave.  </s>

<s> Sorry Joe, I just hit reply, Anyway thanks for your help, I finally managed to get to the child node and get its value, thanks again.  </s>
