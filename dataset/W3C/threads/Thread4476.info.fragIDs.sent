Mary, In [1], you submitted the following comment on the Last Call Working Draft of XSLT 2.0 and XQuery 1.0 Serialization on behalf of the XML Schema Working Group. 
[I] [Section 4.3: XML Output Method: the indent Parameter] licenses the addition of additional whitespace; this is not called out as permitted 
under 
the rules in section 4, however. 
Thanks to you and the XML Schema Working Group for this comment. 
The XSL and XQuery Working Groups discussed the comment, and agreed. 
The following item will be added to the bulleted list in section 4 to address this comment: 

o Additional text nodes consisting of whitespace characters may be present in the new tree and some text nodes in the new tree may contain additional whitespace characters that were not present in the original tree if the indent parameter has the value yes, as described in 4.3 XML Output Method: the indent Parameter. 
May I ask you to confirm that this response is acceptable to the XML Schema Working Group? 
Thanks, Henry

A point of detail: indentation is only allowed to create new whitespace text 
nodes, or to modify a text node that consists entirely of whitespace characters so that it contains different whitespace characters.

Yes - I'll adjust the list item to describe precisely the circumstances in which an existing text node might differ due to the effects of the indent parameter.

The Schema WG thanks you for this response and finds it acceptable.
