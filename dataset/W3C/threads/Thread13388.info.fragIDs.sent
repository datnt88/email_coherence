Hi Silas 
This email has two purposes 
1. To alert everyone to the impressive feature list of the web access gateway... we've been mostly talking about the new features. 
2. To suggest to Silas to make this info easier to find. 
Presently, to get a description of the gateway, one presently needs to go to and choose one of the links to a mirror of the gateway, and then press help This brings the person to e.g. 
That contains among other things your impressive list of features, which are implicit in the options Enable scripts Use document body attributes Use document font settings Leave frames as they are If leaving frames, make them generic Leave tables as they are If leaving tables, make them generic Enable applets If applets not enabled, don't attempt to process their parameters either Don't change blinking text to bold Don't change underlined text that is not a link to bold Don't change italic text to bold Don't put brackets around links Don't change marquee text into plain text Perform smiley substitution Don't attempt to remove surplus spaces between characters Leave images in links as images Leave image maps as they are Enable style Enable delayed refresh/redirection Repeat ALT tags after images Don't strip NOBR tags Promote headings I suggest you include this list of links right up front on or put a link to it. 
Hmmm. 
You refer users to which redirects to Which url is is best these days?

Hi, 
OK, don't tease me! 
grin 
I was afraid that putting the features list up front would scare people off, because it does make it look a bit complicated (and by the way, you only listed the features that were under the Access button). 
The 
idea is that you *can* start using it straight off and come back to tweak your options later. 
And if you do use it and start pressing its buttons, you're soon confronted with them! 
In fact I was wondering whether I should structure them a bit more, although I'm not sure how. 
Well the epona one should work until I graduate, and hopefully if Bigfoot are still around then I can re-direct it elsewhere later (that is assuming I can have some web space after I graduate, which seems like an increasingly slim chance). 
That's why I mention the bigfoot URL, because epona is a student-run machine (and that student is leaving next year too) and therefore the whole DNS entry will simply disappear, so there's no chance at all of re-direction. 
With bigfoot, at least there is a bit of a chance. 
Having said that, I've no idea where I might go. 
I certainly don't want any of those free servers because sooner or later they decide to put loads of adverts on your page, making it incredibly inaccessible (besides, they don't do CGI). 
ACCU has to be as much as possible ACCU-related (and I wouldn't like to bank on the permanence of the current arrangement given the way things are going in the UK academic network - ACCU will probably get charged for incoming transatlantic traffic next year, and a page fetched by the gateway is incoming traffic.) And no way can I afford to keep paying a commercial ISP to let me in to a web server with a shell account and full CGI access, not to mention the fact that I'd also have to pay for people's web browsing once Internet charging gets steeper (because the gateway's requests look like they're coming from me). 
In fact there's already been debate within this university about this and I'm not even sure whether I'll be able to still run the gateway next year (I'm really really looking for a host outside the UK's academic network, especially one in a European country so it doesn't take trans-Atlantic traffic to get there). 
In the last six hours, the gateway on ssb22 has served 2339K (higher than I thought - maybe it's because of the amount of activity on this list lately), which is roughly about 8 cents of Teleglobe charging Janet (if I've got my conversion figures right), assuming that it's near enough 100% trans-Atlantic. 
By the time the billing overhead gets to me it'll probably more than double, so suppose it's 20. 
Very rough multiply by four (because there are four gateways) and four again to get the amount in 24 hours which is $3.20 (OK I know this is highly unreliable). 
This means that the total cost of running for one year is round about $1000, not accounting for a possible growth in use. 
And not to mention the rule against providing a service to outsiders. 
If I were to run the gateway on a commercial ISP then I'd also have to pay for the connection and probably housing the machine (as well as the machine itself and all connection charges for me to dial in - telephone calls are not free in England), as well as possibly greater charges as even more trunk carriers start charging, and I have nightmares of those four figures becoming five. 
If I were a high-flying businessman I'd quite happily fund it, but as a student I simply can't. 
Nor do I have the character to ask people to fund me, nor the time to run my own ISP company. 
How many hosts can I get between now and then, preferably without using up too much of my time that should be spent getting ready for exams? 
Of these, how many will still be around after the various drastic changes that the Internet looks set to go through? 
And of these, how many will let me actually log in and keep the thing up to date, as opposed to sitting there with an ancient version until Armageddon? (I could time-bomb each release, but then if I had a fatal accident or something it would cause problems. 
Well I'm feeling really ill at the moment so my thoughts tend to be nice and pessimistic.) And will any of them let me dump my web pages there too? 
Anyway I've gone on about that enough. 
I'm more concerned about where on earth I'm going to end up after I graduate, as nobody's interested in the developments I want to make. 
Well at least you see my problem hopefully.

So there are even more features? 
Please point to them when you get the 
chance. Len Leonard R. Kasday, Ph.D. Universal Design Engineer, Institute on Disabilities/UAP, and Adjunct Professor, Electrical Engineering Temple University Ritter Hall Annex, Room 423, Philadelphia, PA 19122 kasday@acm.org

Just a few more behind the other buttons. 
Or the other menu options in the help text. 
I really can't see what makes them so difficult to find - are people afraid to try the buttons out or something? 
Or do they present an access problem?

There are people who don't want to invest in learning and trying something out without knowing in advance what it does. 
After all, there's lots of software out there. 
If we want to encourage people to use or provide this I think it helps to show as much up front as possible. 
I can give it a shot after i get back from CSUN.
