Hi there, I would like to translate the XSL specification into Chinese. 
Could you confirm that this has not been translated into Chinese before and nobody else is working on it? 
Should you have any questions about myself, please feel free to contact me.

Hi, Gail FYI, Chinese version of XPath and Namespaces in XML are available via As you know there is a page on Chinese translations at However, for some reasons not all Chinese translations are listed on that page. 
All the best, Hong Chen Hong: Thnak you for translation name space to Chinese. 
I think the big5 version (traditional Chinese) is needed, too. 
So I did it. 
I put it as attachment.
