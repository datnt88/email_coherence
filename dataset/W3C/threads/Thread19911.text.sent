Help! I've tried installing various binary distributions of Amaya on RH6.0 Linux - latest is the rpm of 2.4.1. 
Amaya loads and displays the first page, but then disappears if I follow an external link, claiming a broken pipe. 
It sometimes loads part of the external page, but it always bombs out. 
I'm using an MS proxyserver, but it seems to be OK, in that it asks for authentication OK and supplies some of the page data at least. 
I assume I've set something up incorrectly, but any pointers would be gratefully received. 
I've been through the list archives, and have found a couple of similar queries, but no answers :-) Thanks, Stuart White Hello Stuart, In our previous episode, Stuart White said: Amaya uses the HTTP/1.1 protocol. 
It may be that the proxy isn't fully compliant. 
I've used the proxy function against an Apache server and it worked well for me. 
One way that we can test it is if you telnet to your proxy and type: HEAD http://www.w3.org/ HTTP/1.1 Host:www.w3.org Connection: Keep-Alive Then see what it returns. 
It should return something close to: HTTP/1.1 200 OK Date: Fri, 21 Jan 2000 11:24:05 GMT Server: Apache/1.3.6 (Unix) PHP/3.0.11 Last-Modified: Mon, 03 Jan 2000 17:16:36 GMT ETag: "2c0540-3313-3870d974" Accept-Ranges: bytes Content-Length: 13075 Keep-Alive: timeout=15 Connection: Keep-Alive and it shouldn't break the connection. 
For the other broken pipe problems, I'm working on an upgrade/patch of libwww to try improve the situation. 
In some places, no check is done to see if a socket has been closed, before writing to it. 
This generates many of the broken pipe messages. 
Could you report back to the list? 
Also, if you could use another proxy, could you tell us if you still have the same problems? 
Thanks, -Jose NB This is a shouldn't, not a mustn't. 
It may close the connection, although it would then need to respond with Connection: close or HTTP/1.0 headers. 
Dave, thanks for the clarification. 
I couldn't articulate my thoughts clearly. 
I meant to say that the protocol implementation may be broken and it may be saying it's HTTP/1.1 or keeping the connection open and actually doing something else.
