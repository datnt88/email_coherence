<s> In a highly cross-referenced business like research, 6.1 would blow your socks off, and in an era of expensive bandwidth but cheap cycles, 6.2 would be very useful, but both of these are large matters and I'm not convinced we have the resources and time right now to fix them.  </s>

<s> 6.1 Are linking element source documents interesting?  </s>
<s> Since a link is asserted by an element, the element by definition must appear in a document.  </s>
<s> Let's call this the "linking element source document".  </s>
<s> In many cases, the identification and address of the source document are of great interest in correct processing of a link.  </s>
<s> Among other things, authentication and authority issues are of great import when the link is to something like financial information.  </s>
<s> In laypersons' terms: who said so?  </s>
<s> Does the linking element source doc need to be discussed in the XML link spec, and do we need to specify any particular required behavior or metadata concerning it?  </s>
<s> 6.2 Locator fragments and traversal process model In the web, when processing "http://x.com/y/z.html#SEC1", the server returns all of z.html, and the client navigates to an A NAME="SEC1".  </s>

<s> I, for one, would like to separate out the information about the object container locator and the contained located object.  </s>

<s> The example of xml-tlink="url (http://www.uic.edu/orgs/tei/p3) id (foo) child (3 p)" appeals to me particularly because of its clear split between the URL, ID and path navigation from ID components.  </s>

<s> I would personally say that a resource is an object that can be directly addressed.  </s>
<s> The real question is: what *are* the objects and resources?  </s>
<s> Ok. Are these the same (definitively) resources as specified in Dan Connoly's glossary.  </s>
<s> I lurk on uri.bunyip, and it is difficult to sort what is meant by address, location, name, resource and object.  </s>
<s> I accept that a resource is an addressable object.  </s>
<s> But what is the definitive relationship among name, location and address?  </s>
<s> How are these sorted in the URL schemes, and how are they sorted in XML?  </s>
<s> Are they the same?  </s>
