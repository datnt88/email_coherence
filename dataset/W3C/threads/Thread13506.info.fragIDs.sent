<s> We are still working on the requirements for well-formed claims, in particular to allow for increased granularity.  </s>
<s> For example, I think it will be possible (required?) to indicate the format that is used to satisfy a particular content type label's requirements (e.g., to satisfy "Image" requirements, the user agent implements GIF, PNG, and SVG).  </s>
<s> I like the use of rdfs:comment.  </s>
<s> That will also be important for checkpoints that the claimant says do not apply (for rationale).  </s>
<s> WCAG 1.0?  </s>
<s> We require that one version of a claim conforms to WCAG 1.0 (this is not quite what the last call draft says, but refer to proposal [1], section 15).  </s>
<s> A machine-readable claim such as one in N3 probably does not conform to WCAG 1.0, but is very useful (and probably sufficient).  </s>

<s> Hi Ian,  </s>
<s> We are still working on the requirements for well-formed claims, in particular to allow for increased granularity.  </s>
<s> Scope, obviously, seems to be the most important factor here - in as much as UA are obviously expecting these conformance claims to *do* something.  </s>
<s> I presume that this is (primary) to provide information to the user about how accessible a product is, and (secondary) to assist in development and debugging of the product itself.  </s>
<s> As far as "well-formed" is concerned, the modality of the information presented is perhaps not as essential as the content itself, but it is certainly a huge factor for consideration.  </s>
<s> XHTML "as is" is great for documentation, but next to useless when it comes to machine processing.  </s>
<s> EARL, on the other hand, isn't 100% human readable, but is an exemplary format for machine processing.  </s>
<s> Because it's cast in RDF, it's also repurposable, and hence it may actually be possible to transform a well-formed conformance claim in EARL into an XHTML version.  </s>
<s> If I beg to the ERT staff (my XSLT skills probably aren't up to it), we might be able to get an example set up - transforming some EARL to XHTML on the fly using a Makefile.  </s>
<s> EARL, because of it's scope (which is to make extremely well grained evaluations), would probably be quite useful as far as UAAG conformance is concerned.  </s>
<s> Actually, that was a bit of a hack on my part: I should have looked up the particular ID for the checkpoints myself, and pointed to them using earl:id or something (we need to clarify the use of terms in the next version of the schema).  </s>
<s> The addition of the earl:excludes term is certainly quite useful for omitting checkpoints form a suite that one does not conform to.  </s>
<s> [...] We require that one version of a claim conforms to WCAG 1.0 [...] A machine-readable claim such as one in N3 probably does not conform to WCAG 1.0, but is very useful (and probably sufficient).  </s>
<s> Do you have any comment on the accessibility of N3 claims?  </s>
<s> I would claim, because of the repurposability of RDF, that N3 is easily WCAG 1.0 compliant; perhaps more so than vague prose descriptions, because we can be very explicit about which part means what.  </s>
<s> You could only do that using XHTML if you had a bunch of classes, and even then, because of the nature of the class mechanism in XHTML, this would not be possible to describe to a high semantic level.  </s>
<s> In other words, XHTML is really for prose, not data.  </s>
<s> ERT is a WAI group, and we are looking more closely at using EARL for accessibility evaluations than any other domain of technology at this time.  </s>
<s> I think if there were any accessibility barriers in EARL, this would have been pointed out quite some time ago.  </s>
<s> As ever, the defining point is where one converts from data = prose; you don't want to lose information, and you want to keep it accessible.  </s>
<s> I think you might want to start referring to it as a possibility for making claims, yes; as informative information for the time being.  </s>
<s> Once we have a stable base of implementation and so forth, we may start asking if groups could provide normative links to EARL as a method for expressing machine-readable evaluations.  </s>
<s> I'm sure AU and GL will be looking into this as well (indeed, I know they are!).  </s>
