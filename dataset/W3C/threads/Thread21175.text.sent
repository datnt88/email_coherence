The mark of the end of an orgainization or company is when more time and energy is spent on new corporate facilities, organization structures, images and logos then on the core business ... in amaya's case the business is tomake the browser render valid sites correctly and predictably, and to incorporate authoring and coauthoring tools for building sites that are valid.

Of course our main work is to help users to generate valid pages and to render them correctly. 
We also spend time to display invalid pages and try to show what is wrong in these pages just to convince users to progress in the right direction.
