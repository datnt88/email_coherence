<s> All, Today President Clinton spoke on a live webcast (was it accessible?) about the Digital Divide at an organization called Plugged In in East Palo Alto.  </s>
<s> www.pluggedin.org.  </s>
<s> It is quite interesting because as we all know people with disabilities are victims of the digital divide.  </s>
<s> I looked at the plugged in web site and this is what I found: Their website does not look too accessible to me.  </s>
<s> Alt tags do not come up on the image maps which mean they are not there or are coded wrong.  </s>
<s> No alt tags that I can see on other images.  </s>
<s> they do have some links on the bottom but they can do a lot better I am not sure but the tables don t look to accessible either.  </s>
<s> The other pages are pretty bad also.  </s>
<s> The Portfolio can be found at: http://www.pluggedin.org/pie/portfolio.htm  </s>
<s> It is full of Javascript and no alt tags I can find.  </s>
<s> Their Portfolio itself has some real disasters.  </s>
<s> The Forever Young Foundation no alt tags, loaded with Javascript for starters.  </s>
<s> A real shame.  </s>
<s> It also pops a separate window.  </s>
<s> The Community Partnership site at http://www.communitypartnership.org/ has a text only version now, but it did not for a long time.  </s>
<s> Kids Survey is loaded with javascrip and I cannot find any alt tags.  </s>
<s> The rest of the links to the portfolio don t work.  </s>
<s> Pretty nasty stuff.  </s>
<s> What a shame cause these kids are obviously quite talented.  </s>
<s> I would venture to guess that this organization receives state and Federal aid.  </s>
<s> Seems to me they have some legal obligations to make sure their work is accessible.  </s>
<s> Let me know what you think.  </s>

<s> Dear Group,  </s>
<s> I have been in the habit of ending list items with punctuation.  </s>

<s> of view.  </s>
<s> Is this practice still necessary?  </s>
<s> Is it advisable?  </s>
<s> HTML 3.2 had DIR and MENU but these have been deprecated.  </s>
<s> Is there any appropriate mark up to differentiate a list where each bulleted item is one or two words each versus a list where each item may be one or two sentences, or even multiple paragraphs?  </s>
<s> Do any screen readers treat any of the unordered list types differently?  </s>
<s> Thank you.  </s>
<s> Hi Bruce: It is my experience that list items with punctuation definitely make more sense with speech output than items without such punctuation.  </s>
<s> I prefer periods following list items since this causes what I consider to be the most natural audio rendition.  </s>
<s> That is, it comes closest to the way someone would read the list out loud, a short pause between the list items.  </s>
<s> Without periods directly adjacent to the word (for single word list items), it sounds as if the word is being, what I very loosely refer to as, "chopped off".  </s>
<s> In such cases I have to repeatedly give the SayWord command to try to understand it.  </s>
<s> Sometimes I even have to go into Jaws cursor mode and spell out the word letter by letter.  </s>
<s> many variables are involved, however, with settings that control the amount of punctuation spoken.  </s>
<s> I usually have my punctuation set to "say most", rather than "all" or "some".  </s>
<s> This is, I would guess, a highly variable choice depending on preferrence and maybe even type of list.  </s>
<s> If I understand the issue, it is however more of a speech synthesizer issue rather than a screen reader issue, although both can affect how punctuation is pronounced and the associated pause behavior.  </s>

<s> I would advise making the list grammatical and doing proper markup.  </s>
<s> As you probably know, Lynx puts various punctuations for bullets in front of list items in an unordered list.  </s>
<s> The user will only hear them if these punctuation marks are turned on as they read the page on their favorite screen reader.  </s>
<s> In many bulleted lists, since IE puts the Windows-CP1252 character #149 in front of bulleted items, Window-Eyes will say "bullet" if "enhanced" punctuation is set to "describe".  </s>
<s> If a person wants to grok the items in a list, they may need to stop the automatic reading for a moment and scan through the list line by line.  </s>
<s> In my opinion, this does not place an undue burden on the reader.  </s>

<s> although both can affect how punctuation is pronounced and  the associated pause behavior.  </s>
<s> You are correct that both the screen reader and the synthesizer affect how lists are pronounced, but synthesizers speak what they are told.  </s>
<s> One needs to understand the "string of characters" that are sent to the synthesizer by the screen reader.  </s>
<s> For example: List 1: First item Second item Third item Next paragraph ... Most screen readers and self-voicing browsers will send the entire string of characters to the synthesizer and NOT add any punctuation that is not there.  </s>
<s> Bullets in front of the list items are not punctuation in the synthesizer sense, so the above example would be spoken without any pauses as in the following: List 1: First item Second item Third item Next paragraph ... Since, in my opinion, lists are just reformatted sentences with commas, it would be appropriate for the screen reader and self voicing browser to attach a comma or semi colon to the end of each list item before sending the string of characters to the synthesizer - but most do NOT currently.  </s>
<s> For example.  </s>
<s> List 1: First item; Second item; Third item.  </s>
<s> Next paragraph So, I also have a habit of adding the punctuation my self, but in invisible ink, white text on white background, so users of text browser might "see" the punctuation, the common user of the graphical browser would NOT "see" the punctuation.  </s>
<s> The screen reader and self-voicing browser user would hear the pause after each list item, as it should be.  </s>
<s> Once the screen readers and self-voicing browsers automatically add the punctuation for better sounding speech, I will remove the explicit invisible punctuation.  </s>
<s> By the way, the same problem occurs after headings.  </s>
<s> When reading in "automatic or read on" mode, the punctuation is not there unless added by the screen reader or self voicing browser.  </s>
<s> Those screen readers and voicing browsers that parse the HTML, should be able to more easily add the appropriate punctuation.  </s>
<s> Of course when reading just the heading, or navigating the list, the self-voicing browsers, such as IBM Home Page Reader, correctly pause and or stop at the end of each heading or list item.  </s>
<s> This is a requirement for the assistive technology vendors - not for the authors of web pages to fix.  </s>
<s> In my opinion, fixing the relative few assistive technologies would be a lot more cost effective than requesting billions of web sites to add grammatically incorrect punctuation to the end of the lists.  </s>
<s> Regards, Phill Jenkins  </s>
<s> As Phill pointed out, the punctuation is not ungrammatical, it is un-stylistic.  </s>
<s> Had the same grammar of a list of items been presented in inline style instead of in point format, the punctuation would have been the default style because the rules of grammar apply in a way that they are typically waived in point form.  </s>
<s> Another angle on this issue is the availability in auditory styling properties of a pause after each list item as a matter of style, which is pretty much the right classification for this behavior.  </s>
<s> Audio does an implicit convert to inline style as Phill explained, so the audio punctuation in the form of pauses is just good style.  </s>
<s> Now if people were only implementing the full CSS2... Al  </s>
<s> Dear all, My thanks to the people who have responded off the list as well.  </s>
<s> This has been very interesting to me.  </s>
<s> I did not realize this issue was so ambiguous.  </s>
<s> Since addressing this problem is helpful, why is there not a P3 checkpoint associated with this?  </s>
<s> What mark-up, using CSS, would people suggest, as the "right" way to fix this problem?  </s>
<s> This may be kind of moot since aural style sheets are not supported anywhere.  </s>
<s> By the time they are, I would hope that the new crop of screen readers would be fixed so that they automatically pause after headings.  </s>
<s> As an interim solution, I like Phil's technique for making some punctuation invisible.  </s>
<s> Phil, could you share a URL where you implement this?  </s>
<s> I have see "invisible" text used to hide speech-oriented menus, for a good example, see URL: How common do people think this kind of technique is?  </s>
<s> Do people think this technique is advisable?  </s>
<s> Does HTML or CSS support a "transparent" color for text?  </s>
<s> Thanks.  </s>
