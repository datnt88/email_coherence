<s> I finally received a weasel logo from the graphic designers.  </s>
<s> This is a small black-and-white representation.  </s>
<s> A larger, color version will be available later today.  </s>
<s> Let me know if you think it should be changed.  </s>
<s> --Jared  </s>
<s> Well, as much as I like the image of the DOM WG as superheroes, the Super-weasel cape is perhaps a bit much.  </s>
<s> I have a mental image of a weasel weaseling through the letters D O M that appeals to me ... By the way, yesterday's Dilbert (the one on the Web anyway) had a weasel motif; I'll pass along only a snippet to keep Scott Adam's lawyers off my back.  </s>
<s> His weasel, needless to say, is not exacly appealing-looking.  </s>
<s> The punchline is "you should never settle for the lesser of two weasels", which of course we could never take seriously or we'd never get anything done ;~)  </s>
<s> Just curious: Is there a document somewhere that explains why this mascot was chosen?  </s>
<s> Joe Kesselman / IBM Research Unless stated otherwise, all opinions are solely those of the author.  </s>
<s> I hope not ;~) I'm not completely sure how serious this is.  </s>
<s> The weasel is our unofficial mascot because -- too many times to count -- discussions were concluded with something like the sentence, "OK, we won't change the spec, but we'll add weasel words to cover both sides [of whatever we'd been arguing about]".  </s>
<s> Also, given all the constraints we operate under (it's gotta be cool enough for C++/Java weenies but simple enough for script writers, break new ground but not break MS or NS scripts, be platform and language independent but not use cross-platform tools that are anathema to various W3C members, understandable to HTML users but palatable to XML users, the names have to be as short as possible and as clear as possible but not conflict with anybody's proprietary APIs ...) any creature who is reputed to be able to wriggle out of tight spaces gets our respect.  </s>
<s> This is an in-joke within the WG.  </s>
<s> We sometimes speak of "weasel words" to explain some decision where we either don't want to fully expand upon the reasoning that led to it or else where we are being politically careful to keep one or more parties happy.  </s>

<s> Ah. Thanks; I understand exactly where you're coming from!  </s>
<s> (As Checkov did _not_ say: "Can you direct me to the nuclear weasels?")  </s>
