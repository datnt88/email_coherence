Hello DOM users. 
I have been able to download and examine the DOM API from w3c site. 
My question is that I want to use the API to be able to create an XML doc, add nodes to it, change the data of the nodes etc. 
So far my only source of information has been the minimal HTML docs supplied with the distribution zip file. 
Can somebody tell me where can I find a vc++ type of help for the things I 
can do. 
I mean the html help only lists the methods, methods and more methods. 
Thanks in advance, Rahul. 
I'm afraid I don't know what you mean by the phrase 
To "create an XML doc, add nodes to it, change the data of the nodes etc", you call the appropriate "methods, methods and more methods." 
I know, that doesn't tell you a lot about how to get started. 
Unfortunately I don't have a recommended-reading list. 
IBM has some XML tutorials on the web which might be helpful: 
... I believe the "XML Programming in Java" and "XML for Programmers" articles include practical introductions to the DOM.

I mean, if I want to create an XML document using the DOM API then which interface to implement, which method to call? 
Simillarly for other operations there should be some kind of starting point in the documentation. 
The documentation is in a very poor state right now because I have to read the methods and guess what it could possible do. 
regards and thanks for writing in . 
I am going to read the link you had kindly sent. 
Rahul.

Here's a simple example using Xerces (see http://xml.apache.org): 
To create the short document x y /y /x : DOMImplementation domImpl= DOMImplementationImpl.getDOMImplementation(); doc = domImpl.createDocument( 
docURI, "x", docType ); Element root = doc.getDocumentElement(); 
Element anotherElem = doc.createElement( 
"y" ); root.insertBefore( anotherElem , null ); A good way to learn is to download a good package such as Xerces, read the JavaDocs, and just play around. 
The OpenXML packages are good for parsing and serializing.
