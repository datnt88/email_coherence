I am currently evaluating Ultraedit and noticed the TIDY that came with it. 
I tried it against a simple Micrsoft word 2002 "save as html" file and got lots of errors. 
This is just a headup notice on the chance that you have not tried it against miscrosoft generated code. 
Erwin Rollauer Senior Systems Analyst Information Systems Resources McGill University 688 Sherbrooke St. West, Suite 500 Montreal, QC H3A 3R1 Hi Erwin, Turns out Microsoft Word produces html that is sub-standard, very sub-standard in many ways. 
But there are some configurable options in Tidy that may help you out, take a look at these. 
Word-2000 http://tidy.sourceforge.net/docs/quickref.html#word-2000 
force-output http://tidy.sourceforge.net/docs/quickref.html#force-output 
bare http://tidy.sourceforge.net/docs/quickref.html#bare 
Also look at Microsofts own cleaning app I have been working on a custom app to convert Word output to XHTML and learning alot about what it takes to clean up the junk and leave behind useful info. 
Cheers Fred Erwin - to utilize the power of Tidy against the putrid HTML(if you can call it that) of Word. 
You have to use a config file in association with Tidy. 
I am about 95% successful in cleaning it up with a config file that looks like this: word-2000: yes new-empty-tags: o, head literal-attributes: no indent: auto indent-spaces: 2 tidy-mark: no wrap: 72 markup: yes output-xml: no input-xml: no doctype: omit show-warnings: yes numeric-entities: yes uppercase-tags: no uppercase-attributes: no char-encoding: latin1 clean: yes quote-marks: yes quote-nbsp: yes quote-ampersand: yes break-before-br: no drop-empty-paras: yes drop-font-tags: yes enclose-text: yes write-back: yes new-empty-tags: o, style, head markup: yes error-file: err.txt 
The only thing that I have found that this will not do is to remove the "smart-tags" that windowsXP puts in there (I assume this is because the word-2000 option was written befor ethe marvelous invention of these dumb smart-tags). 
Also, my config file removes the " head " tags and everything between them. 
In addition, if you end up downloading the Microsoft clean up tool, it is ok, but is 100% incompatible with office XP, and will not install on anything other than office2000. 
However, you can extract a file called "filter.exe" from the install files and use it in the command line. 
I am anxious to try the "force-output bare" option myself. 
If you have trouble getting the filter.exe 
file, let me know and i can email it to you. 
peace, dude in oregon
