Hello, after several uninstall/reinstall attempts my rather baffled guessing is: In contrary to version 5.1, installation of WindowsNT-5.2a to another path as /Programm Files/Amaya/ gives a menu bar without the menus for editing. 
Same with shortcuts: editing disabled somehow. 
If this is true and intended, I`d like to suggest some note during installation.

Normally the installation path shouldn't perturb the Amaya application provided that configuration files have the right relative position: the binary amaya.exe is looking for configuration files by relative paths "..\..\config\" or "..\..\amaya\". 
Irene. 
One should try another time to "cure" strange things... 
It works now and Amaya behaves as it should either displaying all menus or refusing to start when some configuration files are not found. 
Thank you for your reply.
