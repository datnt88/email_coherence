<s> Modifying printed materials People with cognitive disabilities have a range of abilities to read and comprehend.  </s>
<s> There is no one all-inclusive way to ensure what is presented can be understood.  </s>
<s> To enhance readability, however, the information should be presented in clear, concise language.  </s>
<s> To make content clearer and more understandable, use shorter sentences, choosing common rather than complex words.  </s>
<s> Provide definitions of new or uncommon words that must be used.  </s>
<s> Be sure that concepts are presented separately and in a logical sequence.  </s>
<s> Additional contextual material and explanations may be needed to facilitate understanding.  </s>
<s> Field-testing with self-advocates and others with cognitive disabilities will show what level of readability is appropriate.  </s>
<s> The readability of text can easily be checked.  </s>
<s> For example, Microsoft WordT software has the Flesch-Kincaid Reading Scale and the Flesch Reading Ease scores as part of the Spelling and Grammar features.  </s>
<s> The Reading Scale uses the average number of syllables per word and words per sentence to determine the reading grade level up to the 12th grade.  </s>
<s> The average reading level of the general population is around the 8th grade, so materials for people with cognitive disabilities will be more easily understood when written at the 4th-5th grade level.  </s>
<s> The Reading Ease score is based on a 100-point scale, with higher numbers indicating greater ease of comprehension.  </s>
<s> To turn on the Readability feature in WordT, go to the Main Menu and under "Word," select "Preferences."  </s>
<s> There, select "Spelling and Grammar."  </s>
<s> Under "Grammar," check the box for "Check grammar with spelling."  </s>
<s> Next, check the box for "Show readability statistics."  </s>
<s> Then click "OK."  </s>
<s> At the end of a spelling check, a box will provide the following readability statistics: *Word, character, paragraph, and sentence counts *Average number of sentences per paragraph, words per sentence, and characters per word *Percent of passive sentences (lower is better) *Flesch Reading Ease score (0-100) (higher indicates easier) *Flesch-Kincaid Reading Scale (up to grade 12) Other changes in text presentation can help readability.  </s>
<s> Breaking text into shorter sections, each with a specific point, helps comprehension.  </s>
<s> Using bold headings and numbering the items, rather than using bullets, also clarifies the content.  </s>
<s> A question-and-answer format is more easily understood than straight narrative.  </s>
<s> Occasional checkpoint questions can be included, to ensure the reader understands the material already covered before new ideas are presented.  </s>
<s> Use pictures or graphic images to demonstrate or depict points presented in text.  </s>
<s> The images should be closely related to the content and carry meaningful information.  </s>
<s> Take care to ensure the document does not become cluttered with images.  </s>
<s> More pages, with less on each page, will make the document more reader-friendly.  </s>
<s> Color can also be used to help separate points or to identify sections that go together.  </s>
<s> Use of color just to brighten a page might end up making it more distracting or confusing for some readers.  </s>
<s> See the related list http://www.ncddr.org/du/researchexchange/v08n03/3_tips.html of tips developed by self-advocates from the Milton Keynes People First organization.  </s>
<s> Modifying documents on the Web Many of the suggestions presented to make printed materials more readable and comprehensible can also be applied to documents that are presented on the World Wide Web.  </s>
<s> Multi-media files on the Web can help reinforce the printed words.  </s>
<s> For example, an audio version can be provided, where the words are read aloud.  </s>
<s> Designers need to keep their pages simple and clear, without several frames or links that can take the reader to other areas where they may lose the thread of what they are reading.  </s>
<s> To help with navigation, use simple icons/colors to identify elements of the site or pages to be accessed.  </s>
<s> Keep navigation tools in the same place on each page.  </s>
<s> Consistency in design will guide the visitor.  </s>

<s> These articles and others in this issue demonstrate the wide range of abilities and issues to address in modifying materials for people with cognitive disabilities.  </s>
<s> There is no single strategy to make information accessible, and useful, for all.  </s>
<s> Maintaining a relationship with self-advocates is key to being able to provide information in usable, understandable formats.  </s>
<s> I don't believe that the automatic readability scales are reliable enough to include as a recommendation for content authors.  </s>
<s> They provide a very rough guide but are very easy to fool.  </s>
<s> Other recommendations are mostly common sense although I would expect that many might disagree that content broken into short pages is better for everyone.  </s>
<s> A long page is easier to print and mark up with highlighting and may be easier for some to navigate.  </s>
<s> A major problem with trying to address cognitive disabilities in the design of a Web page is that a barrier for one individual might actually be exactly what another needs to maintain attention and to understand how the content is organized.  </s>

<s> Regrets for missing the Tokyo FTF, it is too expensive to get there (by some order of magnitude) Comments for the latest draft I need to ping 3.2 again Can we have something at least some entry at level one,- I think WCAG 2.0 will be a step down for 1.0 if the guideline for understandable text is demoted  </s>

<s> why has the lexical proposal been removed?  </s>
<s> A lot of people like it (In fact some European web content being written is now using that techniques -even before it is a requirement :) ) Can we add lexicon proposal at least at level two?  </s>
<s> (why can this not be level one) Benefits.  </s>
<s> The fact: using simple words and simple language will allow more people to understand you.  </s>
<s> There are millions of people who have problems understanding language -written or spoken.  </s>
<s> There are many people who have worked hard the last thirty years of their life to build up a vocabulary of say 1000 words.  </s>
<s> If you use simple words more people can understand your content I know Avi ( Voice of America) has simple language broadcasts/.  </s>
<s> All there news items are described only using words from a short "simple language dictionary/lexicon".  </s>
<s> This lexicon is available, and is short, and they manage to describe all their news broadcasts using it.  </s>
<s> We want to say: use words that more people can understand For example use words in a six year old's vocabulary not.  </s>
<s> However if this is too difficult for your site's content, then try and keep the "age" bar down as much as you can.  </s>
<s> Not very testable or normative.  </s>
<s> But this is both testable and normative "All terms used are available in a linked to, fully accessible simple language lexicon, or supplementary lexicon of topic specific Jargon"  </s>
<s> There are any number of lexicons available.  </s>
<s> I know when they test children's development they have lists of words that child is expected to understand and use correctly at any given age.  </s>

<s> Apropos the subject line, what's a "3.2"?  </s>
<s> Let's see.  </s>
<s> You run a very large database-driven site whose pages do not exist until they are requested by the visitor.  </s>
<s> Please explain how every single page title can be unique, especially if the pages are search results.  </s>
<s> What if you were searching for 20 different terms at once?  </s>
<s> Then separately for 20 different terms?  </s>
<s> What would the page title s be?  </s>
<s> *Real* *examples*, please, not blandishments and diktats.  </s>
<s> Prove it can be done in real-world sites.  </s>
<s> Still an appallingly misguided and irrelevant concept.  </s>
<s> As has been demonstrated already, page authors cannot be expected to simultaneously write valid HTML and also write HTML that can be spontaneously remixed by some user agent or other.  </s>
<s> How many times do I have to tell you this before you believe it?  </s>
<s> Skill-testing question: If Freedom Scientific comes out with another whiz-bang feature, as they did with browsing by headings and links, will WAI WG obediently turn around and flirt with the idea of forcing authors to write their sites to facilitate this company-specific peccadillo?  </s>
<s> Give me a break.  </s>
<s> I won't let anyone tell me I have to link every word I write to a lexicon, and neither will any other writer.  </s>

<s> Last time this was discussed I believe it was pointed out that you could readily link a lexicon to a page.  </s>
<s> That's one link per page.  </s>
<s> Or one link for the site encompassing the Voice Of America broadcast transcripts (assuming they have such a thing - maybe they could ask the NSA to provide it for them grin/ ) which really do use their lexicon.  </s>
<s> The difficulties with this part of the proposal are about how to choose an appropriate lexicon, not about whether there can be tools that do it.  </s>
<s> I made a set of tools for the published literature of an aboriginal language (admittedly a small body of work, and no you cannot see it - nor can I anymore, because there are issues besides accessibility in play).  </s>
<s> Some large companies use such tools for developing their own content.  </s>
