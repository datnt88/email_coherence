Would web-services be covered by this.... 
This is my technical opinion. 
The way the patent is described, NO and YES, it depends. 
If I just have a URL on a why site that activates a side-side process (web server, cgi, ANYTHING) and the XML OUTPUT is strickly dumped in the BROWSER window, then NO. 
It is not covered. 
Now, with the new Microsoft XML components in IE, which takes the XML data and transforms it into a "visual tree outline", this YES. 
Any remote client applet that takes data and "transforms" it is covered. 
If the IE Browser "detected" that XML was coming to the BROWSER and it did not have a XML component and IE automatically went back to the WEB SITE to download the XML component, then MAYBE. 
I say MAYBE here because I see nothing in the patent that claims the automatic transfer of requirement component to the client machine as part of the business method. 
However, this may not matter and probably intentionally left out as it would had limited the scope of the patent., 
Sincerely, Hector Santos, CTO Santronics Software, Inc. 305-431-2846 Cell 305-248-3204 Office Hi Hector and Hemant, Web Services is more about server-to-server processes. 
Although there are methods for calling a Service directly from MSIE, this is not the "standard" practice. 
A client, such as MSIE, may make a request to a Server that subsequently invokes a call to another Server - but the results of that call is not conveyed directly to the client. 
In fact, many of the webpages you may interact with may be making Web Service calls, but you'd never know it unless the page Author notified you deliberately. 
Web Service activity is not typically evident even if you look at page's "view-source". 
I'm a programmer and not a legal expert by any means (you should have seen my divorce settlement :-P), but based on what I've been gleaming from this list - I think Web Services are generally exempt. 
Web Services may use XML as the transmission protocol, but the XML called by a Webpage is not necessarily the result of some Web Service activity. 
Webpages that make calls to a Server to return XML, I think have to be treated as a separate topic. 
Like I mentioned in an earlier posting, MSIE strongly supports capturing external XML data. 
One method does employ the use of an embedded OBJECT/ , but the common use is a Microsoft extension for the HTML XML/ tag, which I understand is a "built-in" capability of MSIE. 
The HTML XML/ tag can be manipulated by Script to make Server calls, and then you can take the XML returned to the XML/ and then do a number of things like make a decision in Script, dynamically add or change the current HTML or initiate XSLT. 
Also, from what I understand, even client-side XSLT is a "native" capability of MSIE. 
Isn't this Patent more about invoking embedded (external) applets and controls, and not about the built-in native capabilities of MSIE? 
Or is all the technical definitions I've come to understand, more in control of the lawyers then the programmers?
