Hi All, I'm sure this question must have come up in the past before I joined the list but the search facility on the archive is down. 
Just wondered whether there is a definitive answer to the issue of how to display labels for mandatory fields. 
I've always used an asterisk, not sure about whether before or after the label is better? 
Sometimes also use bold font in addition. 
Can't see anything wrong with this but is there a better solution? 
Using this approach screen readers will say the asterisk I assume and was wondering whether it might be helpful to use title text in addition containing the word "mandatory" for extra enphsis. 
Thanks in advance as ever.

I've been giving a lot of thought to things like this lately. 
Would this work? 
First Name: IE, NN and Opera will hide the "required" statement, but Lynx will show it. 
I'm not sure what a screen reader will do with it though. 
Randal A screenreader will often not render it. 
Why does it need to be hidden anyway?

Randal Location: 21 Mitchell street FOOTSCRAY Vic 3011, Australia (or W3C INRIA, Route des Lucioles, BP 93, 06902 Sophia Antipolis Cedex, France) I see. 
I was just trying to find a way to let a screen reader know that the field was required. 
So you wouldn't have to use an asterisk.

How about using an _image_ of an asterix to mark the mandatory field, but setting the alt attribute to "Mandatory: " or something similar? 
That way you comply with common web practice (asterix = mandatory) but a browser such as Lynx will replace the image with "Mandatory: ". 
So in a variation of Randal's suggestion: First Name The one big problem I can see is that, for visual users who turn images off, the (small) space reserved for the image won't be big enough to fit in the alt attribute, but that is a general problem of how common graphical browsers render missing images. 
Any comments?

Visit Hi Yuck, images ;-) Perhaps this: But I'm not sure if JAWS recognises title attributes on anything other than links? 
So perhaps a link should be used (linking to an explanation of mandatory perhaps): Chris Chris Croome chris@webarchitects.co.uk web design http://www.webarchitects.co.uk/ web content management http://mkdoc.com/

The approach works most of the time, but I wonder what's wrong with the simple idea of using just words. 
Not necessarily before the field label but after it, since it's not the most essential part, and a column of field names all beginning with "Mandatory: " would look a bit odd. 
Although an asterisk would mostly work, especially if explained at the beginning, it's a somewhat artificial convention, which people may miss or forget - especially people with cognitive disorders. 
In fact, the asterisk character has _very_ varying semantics, and we shouldn't expect the general public easily recognize what we mean by it. 
(There's an incomplete list of meanings that asterisk have actually been used for, at my (sorry, not very accessible - it's in the middle of a large document)). 
It has been said (somewhere - I forgot!) that problems encountered by cognitively disabled people are comparable to problems of first-time users. 
So if you were about to fill out a form on a Web page for the first time in your life, would you know what "*" means? 
(Intuitively, it could just as well mean _optional_ field! 
The form as a whole will tell that this can't be the case, but understanding the form as a whole is what many people have challenges with.) Besides, I'd use simpler language. 
I suppose more people understand the word "required" than the word "mandatory". 
Thus, my suggestion is: First Name (required): Naturally, the names of required fields could be highlighted visually using CSS, or one could even use strong markup for them, with or without CSS, since a required fields can be regarded as one that that strong emphasis. 
But this is secondary; words are the most reliable method of communicating that a field is mandatory.

I have two things to say about forms as I see it. 
First, put the instructions on the page with the form including how required fields are indicated and make sure that they are indicated both visually and textually in a small way textually that is and second, even if I don't know what is required, I know most offten what is issential but of course, that may not be true of all but at a minimum, if you are subbing to an email list through a form for instance, the email address is sufficient. 
On the back end of the form, provide corrective paths such that if a required field is missed, describe what is lacking and provide an opportunity there not by returning to the form but right there to make the needed changes and only show those fields that need changing.
