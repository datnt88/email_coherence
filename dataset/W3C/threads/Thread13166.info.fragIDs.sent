<s> Re Al's suggestions on automatic recognition of structure in a page:  </s>
<s> "best fit" reasoning in its decisions, and it has a balance of bottom-up (depth first) and top-down (breadth first) methods for deciding what roles things play in the page.  </s>
<s> actually we could go a long way with just a library of structure templates and heuristics about which template-matching operations to try first.  </s>
<s> Most pages have a head section and a foot section, and a heuristic recognizer would rarely be wrong in identifying their scope.  </s>
<s> The inward-looking navigation bar would be harder to isolate if it weren't always down the left margin...  </s>
<s> This could be encapsulated as a page "grammar" which would be parsed to recognize the structure.  </s>
<s> The parse might be ambiguous... in which case there would need to be a heuristic, e.g. a weighting function, to select the best fit.  </s>
<s> Time to dust off the old AI textbooks (or buy new ones...).  </s>
<s> This is a _very_ interesting research problem.  </s>

<s> 1) I believe that something very much like this is the missing link in the dialog between GL and UA which is going to happen on the 27th.  </s>
<s> The technical refinement on the "grammar" idea is that it is an object-oriented model.  </s>
<s> It is a template for in-core information graphs, not a grammar that starts from linear text.  </s>
<s> But that is a minor point.  </s>
<s> The general idea is right.  </s>
<s> It is a set of rules and rating functions that articulate what is good about a good navigation tree.  </s>
<s> The navigation-tree generation method then scans the parse tree in the DOM and seeks to fill the slots in the "good navigation tree" model.  </s>
<s> Here a "model" or schema is a generalization of a template.  </s>
<s> It creates roles for (references to) instances from the parse tree (and a few interpolated collector instances) to populate.  </s>
<s> I am desperate to clean up my story for that meeting so that people will realize the shape of the hypothesized answer.  </s>
<s> And that we know enough so that building a prototype [DAISY consortium is already paying contractors to do this] and experimenting with real pages is a plausible plan of attack.  </s>
<s> We need the testbed up and running so we can do some evaluation on various rough ideas and not do all our research on paper.  </s>
<s> The idea is that the "navigation tree" is a virtual table of contents like the navbar generated by the Microsoft PowerToy.  </s>
<s> It is a dynamic structure under user control, both on a construction-rule basis and on an instance-by-instance basis.  </s>
<s> The conventional wisdom housed in heuristics or AI generates a rough estimate of what the navigation tree should be.  </s>
<s> In the talking book scenario, the editor of the adapted editions then can hand-edit the navigation tree.  </s>
<s> The author tool maintains the cross-relation between the edited navigation tree and the parse tree for the full contents, however.  </s>
<s> This is an overlaid index, subspecies index to contents, subspecies hand-tailored to optimize based on a mix of machine-computable and human-assessment quality factors.  </s>
<s> I am convinced that we already know enough to build one of these which would be a big step forward from the raw parse tree.  </s>
<s> The central issue is the duration of document parts in nominal play time.  </s>
<s> How fine or coarse to divide things has to be informed by this metric, and the visual author will need help in dealing with this performance axis.  </s>
<s> But a pie chart or related graphical depiction of how nominal play time is distributed through the "current draft navigation tree" is something easy to compute and something it is easy for a visual author to respond  </s>
<s> appropriately to.  </s>
<s> So we need to get on with it.  </s>
<s> In FLORA the method that nominates a draft navigation tree is a _very_ small program.  </s>
<s> You would spend most of your time debugging FLORA, not writing the tree transformer.  </s>
<s> [In XSLT you could do a lot of rewriting and get tired and want to freeze the tool before you had really learned the right rules...]  </s>
<s> Please join me in preparing homework for the Apr 27 telecon on structural navigation, jointly hosted by UA and GL. Al  </s>
<s> Al, I might have missed something here, but I don't know what FLORA is.  </s>
<s> Or maybe I know what it is but just don't recognize the acronym.  </s>
<s> Would you tell us more about FLORA and/or give a pointer?  </s>
