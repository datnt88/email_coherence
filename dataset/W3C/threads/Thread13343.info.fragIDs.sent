aloha, y'all! 
i'm not sure what the ER policy on linking the ERT to an external, on-line 
resources, but if that is a kosher mechanism for getting an author to view 
his or her output via a text-only, tables-incapable browser (as well as one 
that supports NOFRAMES), one possible way of getting authors to view their 
tables in a linearized fashion would be to provide them with a link to a stable service, such as Scott McGee's Lynx-It gregory.

I absolutely agree that it's useful to see how the page actually looks in something like Lynx. 
That's sometimes shown me things that I missed. 
Perhaps that could be added to the intro of ERT. 
Another tool that shows how a page looks in lynx is This has the nice feature that you can click on links and it shows how they 
in turn will be displayed. 
But be warned: neither this tool nor the one Gregory mentioned tells you how image maps are handled. 
In the real Lynx, you can select an image map and see the ALT text of the contained areas (assuming the author put them in; otherwise it shows the urls). 
These lynx viewing tools don't show that. 
I once requested delorie to add that feature, but no time so far. 
He gives 
the Perl source though. 
Maybe someone will want to work with him on that upgrade.

The ERT currently contains links only to The WAI Web Content Accessibility Guidelines. 
I'm not sure what the WAI policy is regarding links to other sites but, for now, I can add an appendix of useful sites.

unquote aloha, chris! 
this sounds like a reasonable compromise -- i too am concerned about tying actual techniques slash repair strategies to documents over whose permanence and functionality we have no control... gregory.
