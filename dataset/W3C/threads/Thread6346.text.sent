Hello, the title of the page on WSDL (Web Services Description Language) language. 
I believe this should be description instead of definition. 
Could you please correct this? 
Thanks, Jurjen Melinga work it harder make it better do it faster makes us stronger more than ever hour after hour work is never over ______  -DAFT PUNK-  ______ You are right, this is actually an error. 
However, we do not modify already published documents. 
Anyway there is a new working group working on this topic. 
Regards Henri Fallon - W3C Webmaster Thank you for your swift response. 
Regards, Jurjen From: Henri Fallon [mailto:henri@w3.org]
