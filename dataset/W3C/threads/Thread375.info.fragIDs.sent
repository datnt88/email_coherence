Tidy always expands '&amp;' to '&amp;amp;' even if I have 'quote-ampersand: no' defined in configuration file. 
This is not a good thing to do for URLs that have '&amp;' characters in them. 
OS is Debian GNU/Linux 2.1 SPARC. 
Same thing happens on Alpha. 
Other architectures I have not tried. 
My configuration looks like this: 
char-encoding: latin1 error-file: ./errors 
indent-spaces: 2 logical-emphasis: yes output-xhtml: yes quiet: no quote-ampersand: no show-warnings: yes tidy-mark: yes wrap: 78 wrap-attributes: no write-back: yes keep-time: yes "pienena / Paavo "Rainbow Rat" Hartikainen minusta / E-mail: pahartik@sci.fi 
tulee / URL: http://www.sci.fi/~pahartik/ rotta" / EFnet: pahartik at #Atari and #LionKing 
That sounds like a bug has crept in somehow. 
I will make sure it is fixed for the next release. 
But this shouldn't effect your browser, as all but the very oldest expand entities in attribute values before processing them (as per the spec).
