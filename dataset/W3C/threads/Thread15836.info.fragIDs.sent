There has been much talk on using the description / d link. 
Is this not redundant when the alt tag is used effectively? 
It seems to me that a page should be able to stand on it's own even if all images are stripped from the site (as with low vision and blind users). 
It's all about content.

... D-links are obtrusive because they tell the non-visual user that he or she is viewing a visual page ... they should only be rendered when the user requests more information on how the page looks visually (as with the "*" key command in Lynx). 
Larry Behrens requests: Many of us are admittedly new to both the list and the finer points of accessibiility. 
Could you somehow rephrase the above (for those of us who are logically impaired G ). 
I thought the purpose of the D-link IS so that those who want a verbal description can get one. 
(?) 
LQ:: The D-link is a constant reminder to the non-visual user that she 
is 
viewing a visual page. 
A page that provides seamless accessibility makes the non-visual user (and every other user) feel that the page is made specifically for her, specifically for her browsing environment. 
If you were writing a page specifically for a non-visual browsing environment, you would not include an image, so the seamlessly accessible page should appear to be imageless when viewed by a non-visual user. 
LB:: 
Are you opining that the D-links themselves should only appear on request, rather than being a constant reminder that *there's more*? 
LQ:: Yes. 
LB:: 
If so (and I can agree with that concept), do you have a suggestion on how that might best be done on a page? 
LQ:: An author would use the LONGDESC attribute of IMG rather than an explicit D-link. 
With OBJECTs, the author has no method to give a long description since there is no LONGDESC attribute on OBJECT; perhaps a future version of HTML will fix this. 
User agents should, by default, hide long descriptions unless requested 
to 
show them (either all the time or for the current page). 
In Lynx, the command key should add a "[D]" or "[Desc.]" 
link right after the 
"[IMAGE]" 
(which could probably be replaced by the IMG's TITLE in brackets). 
A graphical browser could do something similar, with the IMG's TITLE linked to the long description and displayed in brackets (or perhaps an inset frame) just after the ALT text.

Previous LQ response:: 
Even if what the person wants would hurt the accessibility and usability of the Web? 
LRK:: If you provide a seamless page with the option of displaying 
the visual aspects, how does that hurt the accessibility and usability of 
the web? 
By the way, just to reveal a personal preferance, I prefer to watch non-English films with subtitles instead of films which dub into English to attempt a seamless presentation. 
It particularly annoys me to discover a film is dubbed without being told.

LQ:: It doesn't. 
That's why I've been arguing for it. 
I'm just concerned 
with those who would rather force the visual descriptions on everyone (or 
at least on all non-visual users). 
LRK:: 
LQ:: It seems like you're saying that Web pages presented in non-visual environments have been dubbed and that the natural medium for Web pages is visual. 
I'll assume that I'm misinterpreting your analogy. 
There is no dubbing required for presenting a Web page seamlessly in 
non-visual environments. 
The point of seamless accessibility is that the 
page adjusts naturally to all browsing environments. 
The non-English film 
dubbed into English is not seamless.

LRK:: I agree that they shouldn't be forced on anyone also. 
I think we're in agreement, then, that people should have option to see descriptions but not be forced to see them. 
What had bothered me was the impression I got that blind people were being told they shouldn't want the description. 
Maybe I was misinterpreting, e.g. in my reaction to the comment about "frills". 
If that's not what anyone intended, there's no more issue here.

Yes it isn't seamless. 
But I'm saying that there are some web pages that cannot be made seamless. 
I agree that many, perhaps most of today's web pages can be made seamless. 
This is especially true for pages which are really text with superfluous, often banal images just tacked on. 
For these pages, I think the seamless philosophy is a very good idea. 
In fact, I as a sighted user would gladly choose the non visual versions. 
But some pages really do have visual content that needs to be described. 
For example, in the near future movies will be part web content, and audio description will be needed. 
Or, to take another example, suppose someone's personal web page used flowers for bullet lists, intertwined vines for horizontal dividers, and a background colored subtly in according to the foliage of the current season where she lived. 
Those visuals would give me a feel for the person that would go beyond the textual information (e.g. "Karen's home page... here's my favorite links... here's my resume... etc). 
It would say something about the person that she would use that style for her web page, and I don't see any way of making a seamless translation that doesn't lose something. 
In a case like that, you've just got to describe the images to give the full feel of the page and the person behind the page. 
Anyway, that's how I feel. 
But really, how I feel or how any other sighted person feels about this is irrelevant. 
The only relevant thing is that there are some people who are blind or have low vision want the descriptions, and therefore they ought to have the option to get them, while not be forced to do so. 
I think everyone would agree with that?
