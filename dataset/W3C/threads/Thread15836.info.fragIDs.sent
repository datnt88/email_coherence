<s> ... D-links are obtrusive because they tell the non-visual user that he or she is viewing a visual page ... they should only be rendered when the user requests more information on how the page looks visually (as with the "*" key command in Lynx).  </s>
<s> Larry Behrens requests: Many of us are admittedly new to both the list and the finer points of accessibiility.  </s>
<s> Could you somehow rephrase the above (for those of us who are logically impaired G ).  </s>
<s> I thought the purpose of the D-link IS so that those who want a verbal description can get one.  </s>
<s> (?)  </s>
<s> LQ:: The D-link is a constant reminder to the non-visual user that she  </s>
<s> is  </s>
<s> viewing a visual page.  </s>
<s> A page that provides seamless accessibility makes the non-visual user (and every other user) feel that the page is made specifically for her, specifically for her browsing environment.  </s>
<s> If you were writing a page specifically for a non-visual browsing environment, you would not include an image, so the seamlessly accessible page should appear to be imageless when viewed by a non-visual user.  </s>
<s> LB::  </s>
<s> Are you opining that the D-links themselves should only appear on request, rather than being a constant reminder that *there's more*?  </s>
<s> LQ:: Yes.  </s>
<s> LB::  </s>
<s> If so (and I can agree with that concept), do you have a suggestion on how that might best be done on a page?  </s>
<s> LQ:: An author would use the LONGDESC attribute of IMG rather than an explicit D-link.  </s>
<s> With OBJECTs, the author has no method to give a long description since there is no LONGDESC attribute on OBJECT; perhaps a future version of HTML will fix this.  </s>
<s> User agents should, by default, hide long descriptions unless requested  </s>
<s> to  </s>
<s> show them (either all the time or for the current page).  </s>
<s> In Lynx, the command key should add a "[D]" or "[Desc.]"  </s>
<s> link right after the  </s>
<s> "[IMAGE]"  </s>
<s> (which could probably be replaced by the IMG's TITLE in brackets).  </s>
<s> A graphical browser could do something similar, with the IMG's TITLE linked to the long description and displayed in brackets (or perhaps an inset frame) just after the ALT text.  </s>

<s> Yes it isn't seamless.  </s>

<s> I agree that many, perhaps most of today's web pages can be made seamless.  </s>
<s> This is especially true for pages which are really text with superfluous, often banal images just tacked on.  </s>
<s> For these pages, I think the seamless philosophy is a very good idea.  </s>
<s> In fact, I as a sighted user would gladly choose the non visual versions.  </s>
<s> But some pages really do have visual content that needs to be described.  </s>
<s> For example, in the near future movies will be part web content, and audio description will be needed.  </s>
<s> Or, to take another example, suppose someone's personal web page used flowers for bullet lists, intertwined vines for horizontal dividers, and a background colored subtly in according to the foliage of the current season where she lived.  </s>
<s> Those visuals would give me a feel for the person that would go beyond the textual information (e.g. "Karen's home page... here's my favorite links... here's my resume... etc).  </s>
<s> It would say something about the person that she would use that style for her web page, and I don't see any way of making a seamless translation that doesn't lose something.  </s>
<s> In a case like that, you've just got to describe the images to give the full feel of the page and the person behind the page.  </s>
<s> Anyway, that's how I feel.  </s>
<s> But really, how I feel or how any other sighted person feels about this is irrelevant.  </s>
<s> The only relevant thing is that there are some people who are blind or have low vision want the descriptions, and therefore they ought to have the option to get them, while not be forced to do so.  </s>
<s> I think everyone would agree with that?  </s>
