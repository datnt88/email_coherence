<s> Hi Asif, I have no idea about whether .NET can run as a dll or not - you should probably look in a windows developer forum for that.  </s>
<s> But ASP is not going to cause or solve any problems on its own - it depends how you use it.  </s>
<s> The end result for the user is what matters, and ASP is just another way of putting together that end result.  </s>

<s> It can do, yes.  </s>

<s> Not in and of itself.  </s>
<s> The "controls" that InterDev provides you with generate dreadful HTML and would probably cause problems, but the only people I've ever met who used them where project managers (making failed attempts to get an idea of what the coders working with them did).  </s>
<s> Perhaps the controls have improved with .NET,  </s>
<s> I haven't checked.  </s>
<s> IIRC .NET asp applications can be compiled to run as a .dll that interacts with the ASP framework.  </s>
<s> Not that different to the way heavy-duty ASP pages all used COMs form the hard work though.  </s>
<s> Could be wrong on this one.  </s>
