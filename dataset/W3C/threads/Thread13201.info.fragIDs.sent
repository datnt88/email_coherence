<s> Introductions LK Please tell us: name, organization, location, relevant work, what want from this meeting susan morrow, macromedia, sfo, dreamweaver, learn and contribute len kasday, temple, chair, good first start for ADL mike williams, macromedia, sfo, flash, accessibility of flash charles MN, australia, wai, ADL tim springer, ssb, sfo, build ert accessibility, incorporating ADL in product al gilman, cochair pf, back from w3c ac, ert take lead harvey bingham, retired, feel like becoming PWD (eyes, hearing, failing, can't remember what else :-) jon gunderson, U illinois, uuag chair, learn ERT, ADL, PF. UUAG will consider more repair stuff in the future sharon laskowski, nist, heard from al, len, focus so far on usability, worked on log format, looking for activity with this expertise wendy, wai, staff contact for er/wcag, hope to leave with clear idea of where headed so we can create some tools dave pawson, rnib, uk, wai, daisy, validation, repair daniel dardailler, wai, france, interested in adl for w3c conformance in general dd ok, we're done around the table dd bill, sean, could you say something about you Sean Sean B.

<s> Here to develop ADL.  </s>
<s> Semantic Web/XML/RDF/XHTML developer Geeze William Loughborough resident geezer from Smith-Kettlewell Institute of San Francisco.  </s>
<s> Interested in marrying usability/accessibility and the Semantic Web Agenda ADL - Accessibility Description Language len: adl used to record check, both manual and auto len: what do people expect from ADL cmn (charles): ability to capture several evaluation (similar to css cascade) Sean c.f. Len's original requirements (i.e. expectations) at dd: is it also used for accessibility of language (e.g. smil) ?  </s>
<s> Geeze Not so much a formal "language" as a collection of tools/methods for expressing assertions/evaluations concerning accessibility and conformance to guidelines therefor.  </s>
<s> Geeze Should be a requisite part of *ALL* Web documents!  </s>
<s> Sean And hence enabling us to point and repair according to those expressions tim: record who did it, what it says, both used as input/output dave: is the output a rating ?  </s>
<s> tim: not just that Geeze "AN" output is a rating.  </s>
<s> There is no "THE" output.  </s>
<s> Sean In general we want to create a rich metadata description language that can describe the accessibility of languages, and also point into these languages specifically if possible.  </s>
<s> This should also enable the repairing of the documents Sean People should be able to make accessibility assertions about their documents, and accessibility tools authors should be able to utilize ADL for pointing out accessibility errors and repairing them.  </s>
<s> dd bill: why not a formal language ?  </s>
<s> Geeze too restrictive and huge of an undertaking - leads to enmirement in details rather than obtaining results.  </s>
<s> Geeze insufficiently diverse.  </s>
<s> dd we're now looking at charles' RDF page http://www.w3.org/1999/11/conforms/ Geeze A collection of such items rather than a formal language is what I covet.  </s>
<s> dd but it used rdf, so it is formal ?  </s>
<s> Sean Note how it compares with myself/Mr.  </s>
<s> Loughborough's example at: Geeze but it's not "ADL" nor is it itself a language but just use of existing languages/techniques - already in place.  </s>
<s> Sean RDF provides a framework that can allow us to create vocabularies Sean How we define and use those vocabularies is the important part dd agree Geeze If we focus on creating a "language" instead of using its precepts to utilize existing mechanisms we are viewing the "hole" rather than the "donut".  </s>
<s> tim: ability to produce human readable report (using XSLT e.g.) Geeze right on!  </s>
<s> Sean That's one of many requirements and possibilities dd we're now looking at the requirement section in Sean's ADL summary http://www.mysterylights.com/xhtml/adl/  </s>
<s> Sean http://www.mysterylights.com/xhtml/adl/#p31  </s>
<s> Geeze decentralization and diversification are inevitable/central to success.  </s>
<s> More than one way to skin this cat.  </s>
<s> Sean Look at 3.2 - it's more generic: susan; how use in authoring environment?  </s>
<s> important not to look at pages but entire sites.  </s>
<s> also, sites that are dynamically generated.  </s>
<s> what does that mean in terms of inserting code?  </s>
<s> Sean ADL could be dynamically generated along with pages Geeze E.g., Bobby/WAVE/A-prompt and many others do similar things in somewhat different ways.  </s>
<s> This diversity will be inevitable/important. Sean ADL could/should be an integral part of a well designed site cmn: pull pieces together dynamically and make sure alternatives exist for those pieces.  </s>
<s> address contents of database plus template that's used to pull stuff together.  </s>
<s> Sean Pull what stuff together?  </s>
<s> Be specific Geeze client side proxy is !important last in "cascade".  </s>
<s> LK: fixed content page look at template.  </s>
<s> dd: how do communicate to human that human judgement is required?  </s>
<s> in a way that they can relate to it.  </s>
<s> susan: there are people that don't know anything about accessibility or HTML (or other langs) Sean Too many!  </s>
<s> susan: to be as widely implemented as possible, needs to be understandable by wide audience.  </s>
<s> Sean It should be automatic davep: implement circularly behind the scenes.  </s>
<s> Geeze They've opted to participate by using a "participating" authoring tool that has involved them in making human judgements which is flattering.  </s>
<s> Sean If editing tools had ADL type systems built in, and required metadata etc... cmn: assume test suite.  </s>
<s> i went w/rdf since can associate w/that suite rather than official version.  </s>
<s> Sean Like the UWIMP system, we aim to just have people type in stuff about their site, and out pops a profile dd what's UWIMP?  </s>
<s> Sean I'll let Mr. Loughborough field that one!  </s>
<s> Geeze Universal Web Index Management Program dd URI?  </s>
<s> Sean Not yet.  </s>
<s> http://uwimp.com/  </s>
<s> under construction Geeze http://uwimp.com but it won't be up for about three days.  </s>
<s> Just bought the domain name!  </s>
<s> susan: re: cmn proposal: say that someone has a long pg, they get back 100 errors, how will the lang help a tool help them decide importance.  </s>
<s> Sean Based on WCAG levels, I suppose... cmn: does not prioritize.  </s>
<s> if you want to, do that on implementation.  </s>
<s> e.g. may have a tool that only describes images.  </s>
<s> can say, this is what i can help you do.  </s>
<s> Sean If there were more levels: A1/A2/A3/A4/A5/A6, it would be easier to assign priorities to accessibility.  </s>
<s> cmn: another tool might pick p1's out of WCAG.  </s>
<s> Geeze User choice as to how usable/accessible a site should be.  </s>
<s> cmn: depends on tool implementing and talking w/author.  </s>
<s> Sean Yes.  </s>
<s> jg: how many people use templates from AT vs. use own.  </s>
<s> susan: customize templates.  </s>
<s> Sean If people hear about accessibility, then they should be able to look it up and see that they can use our tools, the W3Cs tools.  </s>
<s> jg g: "using for data?"  </s>
<s> "using for layout?"  </s>
<s> what about tool telling problems while designing template.  </s>
<s> Geeze "templates" from AT are actually widely exchanged sort of like music mp3 files.  </s>
<s> Show me yours, I'll show you mine, etc. susan: first, if they are a pro designer iterative design.  </s>
<s> usually have a design that they have to repair.  </s>
<s> re: AT (dreamweaver) we don't interfere w/the design process.  </s>
<s> we could design something that lays on top of that.  </s>
<s> to do that in the authoring environment that would be inappropriate.  </s>
<s> Sean Most templates aren't even valid XHTML.  </s>
<s> Even Amaya!!! Geeze E.g. use a little program that makes image map design easier "within" one's authoring environment.  </s>
<s> cmn: take the 1st image in your doc if you turn it off, still able to use the pg. sharon: checklist need to go through.  </s>
<s> LK two methods: 1 batch mode other do creative process.  </s>
<s> JG not to interfere w/creativity, some techs more access than others.  </s>
<s> if waiting for post-design comments, they will complain.  </s>
<s> "if i used this diff tech when i started out would be ok and not have to redesign.  </s>
<s> ag want to capture MVC, model capture it all.  </s>
<s> give user filtered summary should be the "view" they reviewing results.  </s>
<s> ag; benefits of formality: 1. can use evaluation from one author, repair from another.  </s>
<s> Interoperability.  </s>
<s> 2. drive view constructions.  </s>
<s> sharon: i agree w/al.  </s>
<s> i want to add: interactivity during repair is important.  </s>
<s> 1. as susan said, part of design is interaction.  </s>
<s> 2. management of repair process.  </s>
<s> able to talk about progress.  </s>
<s> Sean Mainly a) Asserts accessibility, b) Makes assumptions about accessibility, c) Makes repairs as far as I'm concerned wendy are these requirements sean?  </s>
<s> Sean Yes.  </s>
<s> They are the core requirements.  </s>
<s> daniel: sean why is making repair a requirement?  </s>
<s> Sean To make assertions about site and page accessibility is the main one Geeze caveat that "makes repairs" is under user control.  </s>
<s> wendy how is making the repair in adl a requirement?  </s>
<s> Sean That is a strongly advised option Sean If you make assertions about accessibility, why not repair based on those assertions?  </s>
<s> dd: understand, not sure agree.  </s>
<s> should it include process assertions?  </s>
<s> when in fact a format?  </s>
<s> tim: input into a repair tool.  </s>
<s> Geeze ATAG revisited - the timing/extent of "repairs" must be author-controlled to be usable.  </s>
<s> Sean Otherwise, what else would we use ADL for.  </s>
<s> Except to say this page is WCAG 1.0 AA dd: can say where eval comes from.  </s>
<s> manual, auto, etc. name the credentials.  </s>
<s> cmn An ADL description identifies 5 errors.  </s>
<s> Use a repair tool to fix two of them And generate some more aDL that says they're fixed Geeze just pointing stuff out is instructional and that's a main goal - training in methodology.  </s>
<s> (optimized: change the existing ADL to acknowledge the changed status) Sean What exactly is ADL for?  </s>
<s> It's an accessibility description language, by definition.  </s>
<s> O.K., so what are we using it for?  </s>
<s> dave: bldg on charles idea of modularity.  </s>
<s> potentially end up w/100's of reported bad points in code.  </s>
<s> Sean To assert accessibility, and then allow repairs based on that!? dp: if prioritize, then can show only important ones.  </s>
<s> requires matrix of relative importance needed.  </s>
<s> Sean That can easily be built in.  </s>
<s> dp: if 155 errors are all equal, won't do any.  </s>
<s> Geeze hence a "user template" of what to report/repair/ignore. dp: particularly needed if modularized.  </s>
<s> Sean Just say "you did this error 155 times" Sean That could be a user template option dp: misinterpreted not same error 155 x's, but 155 errors.  </s>
<s> Geeze there's no jail term for ignoring or brownie points for following the pointers to "errors".  </s>
<s> dp: where to start.  </s>
<s> Geeze we've started.  </s>
<s> Sean So what if we get a list of 155 errors.  </s>
<s> If we can automatically repair them all, it does't matter.  </s>
<s> cmn: 1. agree that in an implementation, good to prioritize.  </s>
<s> Geeze in fact Josh Krieger started it with Bobby .1 cmn: another model: hot dog.  </s>
<s> it has access checking.  </s>
<s> they have a structure view of doc.  </s>
<s> that id's errors.  </s>
<s> Geeze so will Flash.  </s>
<s> cmn: always available.  </s>
<s> use it as go.  </s>
<s> if you add 500 imgs to a site.  </s>
<s> Sean Yes.  </s>
<s> WCAG need to say exactly how important each checkpoint is.  </s>
<s> Some checkpoints are more/less important to some people than others.  </s>
<s> There is no fixed table.  </s>
<s> We have to allow the user to make some sense of it: the user of ADL that is... cmn: you might add 500 IMG elements, then assign images or do each as go.  </s>
<s> wendy wc: (just to irc) we have priorities in wcag.  </s>
<s> Sean We need more layers cmn : important that design decisions be made when being implemented.  </s>
<s> author can say, "don't hassle me" or" help me as I go": Geeze IMO those "layers" might be user-defined rather than by some "central authority" tim: if incorporate priority into ADL.  </s>
<s> Sean Some people may say that with 500 images, I'm not going to be able to write 500 longdescs, so they choose to ignore that.  </s>
<s> William is right.  </s>
<s> tim: can point to external resource.  </s>
<s> as author of tool can say, for "webman" we'll prioritize that way.  </s>
<s> bob, will have a diff priority.  </s>
<s> if we have 10 standard tests, we can point to wcag, or our description.  </s>
<s> wendy sean - ok. any comments b4 you go?  </s>
<s> Sean I have one main comment sharon: separate description of accessibility from user interface.  </s>
<s> harvey: images might have multiple uses.  </s>
<s> Sean ADL should be a tool that people can add to their sites to enable automated tools and humans alike to see how accessible that site is.  </s>
<s> They should then also be able repair to their needs so that they can access the site how *they* (the user) needs it.  </s>
<s> That is a lot of scope, but it is definitely needed.  </s>
<s> harvey: if description attached to image, fix it once then all places point to it should be able to tell has been fixed.  </s>
<s> Sean I'll be back later, thanks.  </s>
<s> susan: people get back huge reports, the majority of stuff they should look at not in reports.  </s>
<s> b/c we couldn't evaluate the code.  </s>
<s> it is difficult to decide what to look at. even just priority 1 checkpoints.  </s>
<s> can be overwhelming.  </s>
<s> hard to give feedback as to what to focus on.  </s>
<s> Geeze sounds like a "retrofit" viewpoint.  </s>
<s> Must focus on authoring tool reminders al: geeze made good point: alerting on the fly is a user option.  </s>
<s> ATAG discussed this.  </s>
<s> has addressed.  </s>
<s> what do you tell the designer first?  </s>
<s> when have many errors.  </s>
<s> my ideal: have demographics.  </s>
<s> not only that violated rule A, but that there is a pattern.  </s>
<s> Geeze the journey of 1000 errors begins with one mistake al: 67% of violations of checkpoint 3 look like this.  </s>
<s> therefore, something in reporting function.  </s>
<s> other errors spread over variety of patterns.  </s>
<s> we don't have that knowledge base.  </s>
<s> design description lang so tool can use that along w/data w/what finds.  </s>
<s> Geeze I think we DO have a form of that "knowledge base" via WebWatch and resources like it.  </s>
<s> wendy (just on irc) of errors made via WCAG?  </s>
<s> LK if we want to tell person the priorities, doesn't have to be in aDL file.  </s>
<s> that say the errors, separate source tells how to categorize and prioritize.  </s>
<s> e.g. 508 might have their own.  </s>
<s> that pointed to by tool.  </s>
<s> Geeze I used to hate spell-check notification, learned to love it.  </s>
<s> same could happen with ATAG conformant tools.  </s>
<s> dave p: another complexity: if I minimize author workload, but they say, "i have a graphical site, bump up priority of a particular group."  </s>
<s> dave P: therefore weight tests based on audience needs.  </s>
<s> W3C more equal weightings.  </s>
<s> CMN that's len's example.  </s>
<s> 508 vs. WCAG.  </s>
<s> Geeze "audience needs" and one's own most frequent transgressions.  </s>
<s> LK this is additional.  </s>
<s> tim: thought about a lot.  </s>
<s> trick is attribution chunk of ADL to attribute chunks to people.  </s>
<s> if I attribute that SSB conforms and point to 508.  </s>
<s> access board points back to my doc and says valid relative to 508.  </s>
<s> daveP: ref from rather than w/in.  </s>
<s> cmn: statement of what tests use is not integral to test results.  </s>
<s> tim: questions about # of tests.  </s>
<s> important to have commonalities between errors.  </s>
<s> would like to see each one flagged as individual violation.  </s>
<s> esp.  </s>
<s> as input into repair too.  </s>
<s> also, supports need for summary stats in ADL output.  </s>
<s> Geeze "individual flags" would be *your* option but not mandatory for all.  </s>
<s> [10:45] break.  </s>
<s> LK: people having interesting discussions during break.  </s>
<s> share points from break?  </s>
<s> daniel: my feeling is that we should decide if ADL (EDL) is raw data.  </s>
<s> anything inferred should not be there.  </s>
<s> should be in diff file or processed elsewhere.  </s>
<s> the eval format should just have result of eval.  </s>
<s> we need to discuss what data model is used.  </s>
<s> len and i drew a simple rdf graph where have a resource that has a statement about it.  </s>
<s> both description of error and the method used to eval.  </s>
<s> i.e. rdf triplet.  </s>
<s> URI, problem, method , author of description start w/simple data model then map to rdf.  </s>
<s> don't need to put in ADL that it is "A" or AA, can be inferred.  </s>
<s> if this file has 3000 image missing alt, don't put in file, infer.  </s>
<s> Geeze not just "errors" but also pointers to conformances?  </s>
<s> dave P: clarification: you are describing ADL as output of checking process.  </s>
<s> my thought was ADL was what does the process.  </s>
<s> DD: ADL Is the lang.  </s>
<s> daveP; the lang of the report?  </s>
<s> DD YES storing rawa data of eval.  </s>
<s> e.g. want outp ut of HTML validator to be aDL.  </s>
<s> today it is just a human report then EDL - evaluation description lang.  </s>
<s> LK shall we try to get consensus?  </s>
<s> should we create a lang that includes other types of validation?  </s>
<s> Geeze and other items than "validations" sharon: clarification: meta info about a product, e.g. B. Schneiderman this site works best with software X. does raw data include meta info about accessibility, what user tests were done, etc. DD: could be.  </s>
<s> same type of statement.  </s>
<s> have URI, say something about it.  </s>
<s> could say, "it's not usable." using usability method Y. see diff level of rdf and schema.  </s>
<s> have overall schema that describe the statement,. the descrip point to another schema, e.g. for WCAG or whether used human testing, or heuristic, or ... Geeze hb Jove, I think you've got it.  </s>
<s> DD for HTML validation have only one method.  </s>
<s> using parser Z sharon: this is a small step in that direction.  </s>
<s> this beyond what discuss this a.m.  </s>
<s> Geeze Giant step!  </s>
<s> davep: scope?  </s>
<s> dd: boundaries are: designing a lang that assesses... dd:reports sharon:describes dd: list of assertions of fragments LK continue going around the table sean (on the phone now): making a framework to eval docs not just accessibility.  </s>
<s> accessibility one use?  </s>
<s> dd yes sean: beyond WAI?  </s>
<s> DD yes we are in need in W3C to formalize conformance.  </s>
<s> e.g. test suite to test SMIL conformance.  </s>
<s> could generate EDL from test suite.  </s>
<s> Geeze Hoo Ray! DD the framework is simple.  </s>
<s> Geeze WAI will wag the W3C dog in this matter.  </s>
<s> DD work detail of accessibility specifics out later.  </s>
<s> sean: sounds good.  </s>
<s> susan: i talked w/dave during the break.  </s>
<s> about priority wcag checkpoints that we could not test for.  </s>
<s> e.g. p1, shift in natural lang.  </s>
<s> mike: cmn and I discussed flash Geeze the author can "test for" that.  </s>
<s> mike: what we're working on in future.  </s>
<s> dd: i also discussed w/mike at break.  </s>
<s> flash objects can have unique id.  </s>
<s> Geeze and longdescs?  </s>
<s> mike: pointing into flash files is something working on.  </s>
<s> want to make files searchable.  </s>
<s> like xpath.  </s>
<s> mike: not be a longdesc.  </s>
<s> right now, no. you can assign a flash object w/in anything in HTMl doc.  </s>
<s> cmn: this HTML fragment is a description for this flash object.  </s>
<s> dd external file?  </s>
<s> mike: yes.  </s>
<s> cmn: right it in rdf.  </s>
<s> tiM: affects of jetlag.  </s>
<s> al; pass harveY pass jon: higher level concept: this based on design decision.  </s>
<s> creating this affect (e.g. menu) has a variety of accessibility problems.  </s>
<s> if diff tech used, could get rid of problems.  </s>
<s> say this group of things a problem?  </s>
<s> Geeze tools to aid in habituating indexing.  </s>
<s> wendy ?  </s>
<s> jg: say i have 30 images in a composite images.  </s>
<s> w/mouseovers.  </s>
<s> images have text.  </s>
<s> if had used something else to make site map.  </s>
<s> access issues may have gone away.  </s>
<s> could simplify site.  </s>
<s> if known what author doing (site map) then the group (this feature) could be classified.  </s>
<s> dd: summarizes.  </s>
<s> jg: rather than saying 100 problems, say there are just these 2. dd that is compatible.  </s>
<s> Geeze If ADL-enabled tool is in use it will train the author in indexing/outlining/clarifying the generated materials.  </s>
<s> dd description of real problem, but also the bigger problem.  </s>
<s> carry raw data (specific problem) as well as higher-level.  </s>
<s> susan: do you mean things like disjointed rollovers?  </s>
<s> there is info embedded in jscript?  </s>
<s> jg: i can give a demo.  </s>
<s> at lunch.  </s>
<s> at design time, questions have to be asked about what the author is trying to do.  </s>
<s> after they've created it (getting gifs in right places) then say "you could have done it this way" they won't want to hear it.  </s>
<s> could have saved time.  </s>
<s> sharon: this sound like user interface design vs testing.  </s>
<s> perhaps tools (category analysis - do upfront).  </s>
<s> don't go to user testing until get basic testing out of way.  </s>
<s> Geeze "user interface PLUS testing"?  </s>
<s> sharon: in design phase, do some testing rather than testing phase (for usability).  </s>
<s> part of engineering process.  </s>
<s> dave: scope, user impact.  </s>
<s> scope: w/shift to output (say bobby), i have the image that adl is the app.  </s>
<s> if emphasis on output have scoping problem w/prioritization &amp; test integration.  </s>
<s> 2. from what we're hearing from users, i want to produce accessible content.  </s>
<s> but how? i don't care if it is a checkpoitn, i accept yoru authority it is wrong.  </s>
<s> i want to be told how to fix it.  </s>
<s> straight from report to suggestion.  </s>
<s> if really curious, explain why.  </s>
<s> (effect on users) cmn: 1. tim&amp;i - we start of mtg talking diff langs.  </s>
<s> 2. dd suggestion of separting eval lang that we plug pieces into., supports dave's point.  </s>
<s> the tool can point you to where you have configured, e.g. specific schema example or animated process.  </s>
<s> 3. checking for changes in nat.  </s>
<s> lang and many others are implemented.  </s>
<s> one reason to keep the model open is we need to account for that.  </s>
<s> tools are good and bad at different thigns.  </s>
<s> 4. take this model, obvious schema to use would be AERT.  </s>
<s> this now w/in AU. note dependency.  </s>

<s> essentially declare algorithm.  </s>
<s> bad html another.  </s>
<s> tidy e.g. that makes that conversion.  </s>
<s> 7. re: jon's point: you can infer that tool X did or didn't do this.  </s>
<s> at implementation level, e.g. dreamweaver has clean up word generated HTML.' it expects what word generates.  </s>
<s> anothere.g., know of good images w/rdf.  </s>
<s> can expect rdf.  </s>
<s> Geeze hence the "how" part of the indexing.  </s>

<s> dd yes positive assertsion.  </s>
<s> right, don't want to call it an "error" it's a statement about a way of doing something.  </s>
<s> jg: if building functionality.  </s>
<s> collection of 20 or 30 elements i can look for that.  </s>

<s> Sean Whew.  </s>
<s> Geeze [SBP:] Sort of.  </s>
<s> Some of them want such things as priority levels be inside EDL rather than using pointers.  </s>
<s> cmn: nah, we seem to have decided we don't want that.  </s>
<s> Geeze Whew LK there are tests that intrinsically require two URI's Sean Good, we should point to stuff from EDL, not include.  </s>
<s> LK e.g. do text links match image map?  </s>
<s> there are two URI's. the test has to point to the URIs of each piece.  </s>
<s> Geeze DUH! AG the definition of the test includes a template which may define multiple references into the thing under test for the specific test there is a binding to particular pointers (multiple) HB Conclusions may differ pointer to pointer AG no. THat is if there are multiple things to test.  </s>
<s> THis is "are X and Y equivalent - you need to name X and Y to make the test clear Sean [WL:] Is there any consensus on what the EDL structure is going to be?  </s>
<s> DD I don't want to force cases to use multiple pointers when it isn't always necessary Sean If you use XLink having multiple links is very easy Geeze [SBP:] I think it's whatever we (you 'n' me) make it.  </s>
<s> LK so use a one-URI test where applicable, and create a complex node for test that need to refer to more than one thing.  </s>
<s> That's getting into the nitty gritty a lot.  </s>
<s> Sean [WL:] I hope so.  </s>
<s> We seem to be moving away from the point rather a lot.  </s>
<s> DP we've got the item we test, the test itself, part of the test i have results.  </s>
<s> al, you said something about the assertion.  </s>
<s> dp can't remember bell that rang... subject/object does not capture it.  </s>

<s> cmn test id.  </s>
<s> SBP The things that you have pasted in look very much like triples... wendy yes, i suppose it is examples of the bubbles on the board.  </s>
<s> dd: from the "desc of test" i want to point to a WAI document (e.g. AERT) cmn priorities are diff than test.  </s>
<s> might be in same doc.  </s>
<s> id of test (refers to description of test) dd: hb question is where find version of test.  </s>
<s> cmn test id. it identifies a particular test by version.  </s>
<s> URI dated version.  </s>
<s> dd: id identified version but version is in the test.  </s>
<s> from id find what version running.  </s>
<s> cmn ya lk can't tell if 2 people run the test using diff version can't tell which more recent version.  </s>
<s> unless check doc or human may read.  </s>
<s> tim: if same tool read same test 2x's replace assertions.  </s>
<s> cmn must explicitly state dated tests versions.  </s>
<s> dd can have same statement twice.  </s>
<s> policy question.  </s>
<s> will tool bark.  </s>
<s> dP: actually app that generate real codes could change.  </s>
<s> test descrip.  </s>
<s> could change while app stays the same.  </s>
<s> test not reflect description.  </s>
<s> cmn pick which to refer.  </s>
<s> lk could have a doc that changes w/so many tests.  </s>
<s> it changes.  </s>
<s> new version.  </s>
<s> 2 people apply same test, not obvious getting diff results.  </s>
<s> dp: messes w/quality.  </s>
<s> lk: confuses human .  </s>
<s> ideally put tests into a format where each one is wrapped in something.  </s>
<s> so we know if referring to same test.  </s>
<s> tim: e.g. of test changing?  </s>
<s> dp: corporate color changes from green to purple, on corp web site says "corp color is X" a test looks for specific rbg value.  </s>
<s> series of tests passes,until the rule changes then fails.  </s>
<s> at some point either abstract source test data or do something to tie them together.  </s>
<s> otherwise blow quality.  </s>
<s> lk therefor w3cneeds atomic tests.  </s>
<s> wc yes, idea for 2.0 dp: if remain frozen.  </s>
<s> lk: if have separate uri for each test a way for machine to know that 1-7 changed, and rest did not.  </s>
<s> cmn don't produce change list in machine readable format.  </s>
<s> wc need schema for tests so machine can read.  </s>
<s> dP scope!!!! lk we've generated work for other groups.  </s>
<s> * Sean agrees with Wendy.  </s>
<s> Need to produce Schemas.  </s>
<s> Geeze we've generated work for the entire W3C ag: if generating engine that ... Sean [GL: Too much work, the scope is much too wide now] ag: cmn saying we're generating more work for someone else.  </s>
<s> cmn: not enough for them to be committed to yet.  </s>
<s> we are going to build something and until we built that we don't have something for them to commit to.  </s>
<s> dp: each test which when in use shall have a stable URI (with help from cmn) dp the content has to be static and it's uri as well.  </s>
<s> Al Sean: the graphs on the board have more than three nodes in them.  </s>
<s> Maybe we could reverse engineer these graphs into a graph grammar of triples...(reply from before you fell off) or you pull it into a local copy.? Sean Yes.  </s>
<s> That can be done.  </s>
<s> I have models that use an odd number of nodes in them lk: if requirements document wrap in a span or div, if sufficient struct take 2 docs, do a diff... Sean mainly from my XHTML to RDF thing.  </s>
<s> SiRPAC uses genIDs to fix it.  </s>
<s> lk: can say which requirements changed which didn't.  </s>
<s> dP: not quality.  </s>
<s> Sean Al: Is that what you mean?  </s>
<s> DP: diff set of tests.  </s>
<s> tim: only see using this to transport data between eval and repair.  </s>
<s> if want static... dp: yes, content needs to remain fixed.  </s>
<s> lk as a procedure: if diff people judging have them use the same version.  </s>
<s> otherwise diff opinions could be caused by diff reqs.  </s>
<s> dd: i am concerned about solidity of model wrt to outside changes.  </s>
<s> and factorization.  </s>
<s> if we generate docs that are 2 megs to express facts that's a problem.  </s>
<s> maybe when look at rdf detail can find way to express.  </s>
<s> at some point have a ref that something is missing.  </s>
<s> Sean They mean that the EDL system will generate a lot of garbage dd how do we cope with adding EDL to existing file... versioning should be brought inside.  </s>
<s> so we can make management easier.  </s>
<s> Sean But if you point to stable definitions (i.e. Schemas) as URIs, you save a lot of the descriptive waste dd ya next steps dd we need to assign someone to encode the model in rdf w/real vocab.  </s>
<s> i need to look at for conformance point of view.  </s>
<s> Geeze wonder who?  </s>
<s> Sean :-) dd, lk, cmn, wc dd: assign someone to revise the EDL document.  </s>
<s> (sean's summary) dp: request that scope be included.  </s>
<s> ag: expand pls.  </s>
<s> dp: scope of work w/very clear boundaries need to be explicitly stated.  </s>
<s> wc got it.  </s>
<s> wendy sean?  </s>
<s> you gonna revise your summary?  </s>
<s> Sean Yes, fine!  </s>
<s> Geeze We've made ADL into EDL and this is a "good thing" IMO.  </s>
<s> What it promises is that the group meeting tomorrow will have to realize that they will be lobbying heavily with other W3C entities to acknowledge/advise/help in all this.  </s>
