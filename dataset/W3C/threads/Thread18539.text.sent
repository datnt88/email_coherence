Hello, I've published the 19 March 2001 UAAG 1.0 Guidelines [1] and Techniques [2]. 
The changes [3] are on the Web and quoted below as text. 
If you have wanted to read the document and didn't read the 9 March 2001 version, please read the 19 March version instead (as there is helpful editorial cleanup). 
Please review a couple of changes not yet approved: - Deleted sentence in 9.1 about pointing device interaction. 
- Checkpoint 4.14 edited as suggested by Al (and in alignment with CSS2 property names). 
If all goes well, I think that there will be one more draft for the WG to review after this one, and then we will be ready to go to last call. 
I would like to be in last call by 9 April, which means we should decided by 29 March whether we are prepared to return to last call. 
Thank you for your continued active participation in getting us to last call! 
The next 2 teleconferences will be very important to our efforts. 
- Ian [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20010319/ [2] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-TECHS-20010319/ [3] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/wai-ua-wd-changes.html#WD-UAAG10-20010319 
TODO We're quite near last call now. 
The following may look like a long list, but I don't think much WG time will be required on these topics. 
We have proposals for the following topics: a) Proposal to address conformance through pointing device and voice input. 
b) Proposal to clarify checkpoint 2.9 c) Checkpoint 9.1: Delete sentence about pointing device interaction [NOTE: I've implemented this one in the 19 March draft since I don't expect that it will be controversial.] d) Checkpoint 2.7: Solution for repair text should not be minimal requirement. 
e) Checkpoints 3.2/3.7: 
Toggle placeholders off requirement: f) Executive summary (proposed by Eric) We don't have proposals for these topics yet, and I think they should be dealt with before we go to last call: g) Al Gilman has suggested that we may have a way to deal with SMIL captions for checkpoints 2.5 and 4.5. 
Al, can you say more about what we can expect UAs to recognize w.r.t. system-captions? 
h) Conformance: Refer to my comments with respect to issue 4.13 about which checkpoints are for content, user interface, or both. 
i) Conformance: Eric has suggested (and I agree) that we include an example of how one would figure out whether a checkpoint or part of a checkpoint should be covered by a claim, and if not what to do. 
j) We need to add to the Techniques document for the following checkpoints 2.9, 5.6, 9.3, 9.5, 9.6, 9.7. 
Additional techniques are welcome as well.

Ian Jacobs (jacobs@w3.org) http://www.w3.org/People/Jacobs Cell: +1 917 450-8783 GJR COMMENTS ON 19 MARCH 2001 UAAG DRAFT GJR 1 [EDITORIAL]: isn't the "and" before "pointing device" in checkpoints 1.1 and 9.3 superfluous, although i suppose that, in light of the 22 March 2001 teleconference, this point may now be superfluous... quote 1.1 Ensure that the user can operate the user agent fully through keyboard input alone, and pointing device input alone, and voice input alone. 
[Priority 1] unquote quote 9.3 For the element with content focus, allow the user to activate any explicitly associated input device event handlers through keyboard input alone, and pointing device input alone, and voice input alone. 
[Priority 1] unquote GJR 2 [EDITORIAL]: in the unordered list in the introduction to GL2, the second list item is not as clear as it could be * Structure is preferred (both the author's specified preferences and the user's structured access), but unstructured access may be necessary for access. 
should it not state "necessary for access to all content"? 
GJR 3 [PRIORITY LEVEL]: why are there no P1 checkpoints in GL5? 
why are 5.3 and 5.4 only P2? i am still unconvinced that these are P2 issues--5.4, at the very least, should be a P1, as there is no guaruntee that one will be able to undo the results of a form submission, and i am still of the opinion that 5.3 is a P1, as well quote 5.3 Allow configuration so that viewports only open on explicit user request. 
In this configuration, instead of opening a viewport automatically, alert the user and allow the user to open it on demand (e.g., by following a link or confirming a prompt). 
Allow the user to close viewports. 
If a viewport (e.g., a frame set) contains other viewports, these requirements only apply to the outermost container viewport. 
[Priority 2] Note: User creation of a new viewport (e.g., empty or with a new resource loaded) through the user agent's user interface constitutes an explicit user request. 
See also checkpoint 5.1 (for control over changes of focus when a viewport opens) and checkpoint 6.5 (for programmatic alert of changes to the user interface). 
5.4 Allow configuration to prompt the user to confirm (or cancel) any form submission that is not caused by an explicit user request to activate a form submit control. 
[Priority 2] Note: For example, do not submit a form automatically when a menu option is selected, when all fields of a form have been filled out, or when a mouseover event occurs. 
The user agent may satisfy this checkpoint by prompting the user to confirm all form submissions. 
unquote GJR 4 [PRIORITY LEVEL]: in the 9 March 2001 draft, the checkpoint then numbered 9.3 read: quote Allow configuration so that moving the content focus to an enabled element does not automatically activate any explicitly associated input device event handlers. 
[Priority 1] Note: In this configuration, user agents should carry out any stylistic changes (e.g., highlighting) that may occur when there is a change in content focus. 
unquote but in the 19 March 2001 UAAG draft, the priority level of the checkpoint, now numbered 9.6, has been REDUCED to Priority 2 9.6 Allow configuration so that moving the content focus to an enabled element does not automatically activate any explicitly associated input device event handlers. 
[Priority 2] i would like the UAWG to reconsider the following reasons NOT to REDUCE the priority level of this checkpoint: 1. reducing the priority of a checkpoint is a substantive change to the document; 2. access to all content is the over-riding concern; if something is automatically triggered when an enabled interactive element receives focus, i've lost access to content; if the content of the page is changed by what i, as a user, perceive as simply navigating the page, how am i to know what i am missing? 
how can i have foreknowledge of the implications of navigating the enabled interactive elements unless the UA provides me with a configuration option that allows me to suppress automatic changes so that i can either manually query the element to ascertain its properties and any associated event handlers, or so that my AT can automatically convey to me (e.g. through an audible signal) that there is/are event handlers associated with the enabled interactive element to which i have navigated; 3. the ability to pause OnFocus events provides a mechanism which is analagous to a blind pedestrian stopping at an intersection in order to ascertain, whether or not it is safe to cross; as a blind individual, i may not be able to perceive all potential obstacles or dangers to my person, but pausing at an intersection does, at least, provide me with the opportunity to gather information before starting across the street; allowing automatic content changes OnFocus, therefore, is akin to allowing a large cow-catcher to be syncronized with the traffic signal, so that, when the light turns green, anyone standing on the corner of the intersection is suddenly, abruptly, disorientingly -- and potentially dangerously -- thrust into an active roadway; 4. if a functionality exists, it will be used; there are numerous examples of strange, non-sensical scripts, as well as those which depend upon the ability to perceive rendered content in a multi-modal manner (the example i gave during the telecon, where on a form used to spec out a new system, an OnFocus event is attached to a form control, which, in turn, causes a "Learn More" link to point to information pertaining to the item represented by the form control with focus; the presumption is that when focus is established on a form element, the user will then use a pointing device to activate the "Learn More" link, but if one cannot use a pointing device (or doesn't have access to one), then one must move focus to the "Learn More" hyperlink in order to follow the link, but doing so removes the referential relationship between the form element and the "Learn More" link, leaving the pointerless user without the ability to "Learn More" about the item selected on the form; 5. preserving stylistic changes (e.g., highlighting) that may occur when there is a change in content focus will enable some users to re-orient themselves (e.g., where focus has been established); GJR 5 [toggle video/images on and off]: i fully support the following proposed checkpoint: quote 3.x If activation of a placeholder required by checkpoints 3.2 and 3.7 causes the placeholder to be replaced in context by the original author-supplied content, allow the user to undo the action (by turning the visual content off and the placeholder on again). 
Note: If the user agent satisfies the placeholder activation requirement by rendering the author-supplied content in a new viewport, the user can close the new viewport per checkpoint 5.3 unquote this is at least a P2 issue, although Denis' point about the man who could play five card stud, but if one handed him a sixth card, everything ceased making sense, would indicate that this is a very important--perhaps, essential functionality --- end comments Gregory, Thanks for comments. 
Mine preceded by "IJ:" below. 
IJ: The 'and' was added for emphasis. 
But you're right, it's now superfluous. 
IJ: Agreed. 
IJ: That is "pure coincidence". 
In the reorganization that led to the creation of Guideline 5, checkpoints whose priorities had already been determined by the Working Group happened to fall this way. 
IJ: Gregory, at the 2 May 2000 teleconference [1], which you attended, we resolved to leave this checkpoint 5.4 (then 9.2) a Priority 2 checkpoint. 
I realize that you have for a long time felt this should be a P1 checkpoint (refer to your earlier comments on this topic [2]). 
This is a case where I don't think the Working Group should reopen this issue and you should voice an objection if you have one. 
Please make an effort to review past rationale for this decision and present new evidence why the priority should be raised.

As for checkpoint 5.3, issue #175 involved the priority of this checkpoint (increasing it to P1). 
At the 12 January 2000 teleconference, which you attended, we clarified that notification was crucial for users of assistive technologies. 
Our P1 checkpoint 6.5 (in the 19 March draft) requires notification for changes to the user interface. 
Therefore, notification of new viewports is covered at a P1 level. 
We resolved to leave what is now 5.3 a Priority 2 checkpoint. 
I request here as well that you present new evidence as to why this checkpoint must be a P1. [3] http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#175 [4] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/2000/01/wai-ua-telecon-20000112 
I note for the record that two of your previous objections have been rendered moot by the progress of the document (which I consider a good thing. 
These are [4] (CSS2 DOM raised to P2) and [5] (minreqs related to speech playback rate).

For the record, we resolved to change it at the 15 March 2001 teleconference: IJ: But it was a new checkpoint (less than two weeks old). 
IJ: We have a P1 requirement that the UA alert through APIs changes to content. 
IJ: The argument made at the previous teleconference was that we were not convinced that too many dangers were lurking out there in practice. 
Charles has an action item to hunt down real-world cases of destructive on-focus handlers. 
IJ: Noted. 
This will be on the agenda for next week.

thank you for your response... you noted, quote I note for the record that two of your previous objections have been rendered moot by the progress of the document (which I consider a good thing. 
These are [4] (CSS2 DOM raised to P2) and [5] (minreqs related to speech playback rate). 
[4] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000OctDec/0110 [5] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000OctDec/0111 unquote to which i simply wanted to note, for the record, that: a) i, too, consider it a very good thing that 2 of my objections have been mooted by the progress of the document; b) it is not my intention to delay UAAG in any way, shape, or form, but it is my obligation to stand by the longstanding objections which have been logged, minuted, and archived... why? 
because they aren't simply my objections, based on conjecture or personal prejudice, but reflect the experiences, frustrations, needs, and desires of the constituency i titularly represent (which, for the record, is the Visually Impaired Computer Users' Group of New York City, also known as VICUG NYC), as well as anyone and everyone who has ever contacted me via the VICUG NYC site--or any of my other web sites, or in response or reaction to a post on a mailing list--asking for assistance or seeking an explanation of exactly what it is that has been reducing them to roadkill on the information superhighway... i will respond to your specific responses to my other comments individually, gregory. 
Gregory J. Rosmaita, oedipus@hicom.net 
Camera Obscura: http://www.hicom.net/~oedipus/index.html VICUG NYC: http://www.hicom.net/~oedipus/vicug/index.html Gregory, The W3C Process is designed so that anyone may request that their objections be carried forward to the Director for review. 
You are obviously welcome to register your objections as we move the document to last call. 
It even seems very reasonable that a thorough review of the document after so many changes would lead anyone to raise some issues (this has happened to me a number of times). 
However, I personally do not want to spend any more time debating the priorities of the checkpoints in question. 
We did that a year ago. 
I personally do not wish to take any more WG time to discuss these priority questions without substantial new evidence. 
We really must move on.
