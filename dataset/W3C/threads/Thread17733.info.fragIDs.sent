<s> (Note for UA people - the discussion comes from page authoring and which events should and should not be used - the initial premise was that all device-dependent events should not, although hopefully some could be replaced by 'logical events - ones which can be activated by keyboard, voice input, etc) If onKeyPress passes no information about which key was pressed, then it could be mapped, along with onClick, to a new onActivate by UAs, providing a pathway for transition to the 'logical event' which we could ask for in future HTML.  </s>
<s> There may be equivalents to onMouseDown, onMouseUp which should be considered at first in the context of making selections - I don't know how to do this using the keyboard in any browsers although I understand that mapping a mouse to the keyboard is offered by Windows systems.  </s>
<s> How this would translate to voice systems (or mobile phone systems, with voice and a limited number of keys) I am not sure.  </s>
<s> But I do think that until we have some ide of how to proceed with this the page-authoring guidelines should recommend against it.  </s>
<s> I know that people will ignore that where they feel they need a rollover highlight for their client, but they can decide that this will not compromise accessibility without throwing out the whole guidelines.  </s>

<s> The reason being that it may encourage people to do the wrong thing.  </s>
<s> For example one can write a gracefully transforming JavaScript thing with: A href="some-url" onClick="some-script" some text /A Now if we disallow using onClick he may write A href="some-script" some text /A that (depending on the script) may work just as before with Javascript on.  </s>
<s> But doesn't work otherwise.  </s>
<s> (The second construct is invalid as some-script will not be a valid URL but validators don't report errors in CDATA attribue values.)

<s> I think we should find the analogies between mouse events and keyboard and speach and make a note of that in User-Agent guidelines.  </s>
<s> One should remember that the names of the attributes are platform specific due to the fact that most were introduced as vendor extentions, but some of them have clear analogies: onClick and the sugested onActivate, for example.  </s>

<s> I think that what realy matters is whether the page is functional with and without client side scripts.  </s>
<s> You can do things that are OK with any attribute.  </s>
<s> O.K.: rollovers that change appearance of links when the mouse rolls on them.  </s>
<s> (as long as the links are noticeable and functional without this effect) Not OK: a link that leads to an important document but works only with scripts on, and gives error message "unknown/unsupporeted URL scheme" otherwise.  </s>
<s> We can't rule against attributes that have no substitute.  </s>
<s> First the W3C should come with platform independent events list, then deprecate the current ones.  </s>
<s> This is what was done with deprecated markup.  </s>
<s> HTML4.0 deprecated many things because there is a better alternative mechanism.  </s>
<s> Stylesheets, for example, or an alternative element (OBJECT instead of APPLET).  </s>
<s> Frames that have many problems are not deprecated because some of their functionality isn't replaced (yet).  </s>

<s> "There is nothing quite so practical as a good theory." -- A. Einstein  </s>
<s> Nir wrote that we shouldn't 'complain' about events like rollovers.  </s>
<s> I think that while he is right in the sense that they do not yet compromise accessibility, there will hopefully come a time in the near future when there is a better mechanism for events.  </s>
<s> In the example of a rollover it could happen by using a 'logical event' to operate on the Style properties of an element.  </s>
<s> This would make that rollover transferable across different media (potentially at least).  </s>
<s> However, if we leave the possibility unremarked, when we come to the situation where wwe are in a position to fix it up properly we will have not only rollover events working as they do now but event driven dynamic objects for which there is no simple accessible alternative, written using an out of date 'mode'.  </s>
<s> This is the problem we currently have with TABLEs and CSS - the TABLE has become such a ubiquitous (although very clearly wrong) way of doing things that it is difficult to undo it, and the real solution looks to be a slow transition as sites are completely rebuilt, rather than a logical translation to a better mode.  </s>
<s> This contrast with the use of a standardised D-link of some kind, which can relatively easily be converted to LONGDESC when the time comes.  </s>
<s> If we could identify events we wanted, pathways by which some existing events could be translated into new ones (as happened with MENU and DIR, which were transformed into lists, as I understand it) and include those in the guidelines then we will not convince everyone.  </s>
<s> But at least the information will be there for those who are interested.  </s>
<s> Perhaps what we want are some informative notes looking towards future developments, and the way in which changes are likely to be made - such as: Avoid the use of device specific events such as onMouseMove in favour of logical events such as onBlur.  </s>
<s> Note that some device-specific events are likely to be autmatically translated into logical events (onClick and onKeyPress to an onActivate event) while others may simply disappear as being too specific to a particular device to be universally generalised (onDblClick) These sort of guidelines would require thought and input from UA, and probably a number of other groups as well.  </s>
<s> It may be a couple of years before these features might be implemented in browsers which are commonly used, (based on the theory that take-up rates on new browsers are slowing down).  </s>
<s> On the other hand it would provide a good incentive for people to read the guidelines carefully if they gave ideas about how to future-proof (by supporting the accessibility features which we hope will become part of the next generation of the web) their material a little better.  </s>
<s> Again, it seems that people are finding it harder to justify the expense of rapid changes to their websites in the real world, and as it moves from an interesting new gadget to a serious part of working the cost of playing with it has to start being justified better.  </s>
<s> (This is really a rehash of the argument for supporting CSS from the beginning rather than saying 'use TABLE' now, but change it when CSS layout is introduced.  </s>
<s> Or another way of looking at the consequences of that argument.) worth 2 cents ?  </s>
<s> Charles McCathieNevile  </s>
<s> Scripts and embedded objects are really new user interfaces that need to follow the UA guidelines.  </s>
<s> It would be difficult, if not impossible, to have a browser user agent smart enough to figure out what a script or embedded application is doing and how to create an accessible user interface.  </s>
<s> Therefore people doing scripting or writing embedded applications need to follow UA and GL guidelines for making there part of the interface accessible (providing keyboard events for all functions, for example).  </s>
<s> This said many people would probably raise the complance flag.  </s>
<s> many script writers will not consider accessibility guidelines (or even know about them).  </s>
<s> So the user agent may be able to provide simple repair techniques, for example providing keyboard navigation and synthesis of certain keyboard events bound explicitly to a particular element (i.e ignore bubbling of events).  </s>
<s> This may repair many simple scripts to provide some level of accessibility.  </s>
