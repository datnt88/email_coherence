Good question, and good answer how can we add a text alternative for a bullet image inserted via a style sheet? 
E.g. style UL LI { list-style-image: url(blueball.gif) 
} /style Any thoughts? 
From the CSS2 rec: style UL LI { list-style: url(blueball.gif) 
disc } /style Charles Can we add this to the techniques document ? 
or at least a link to the CSS rec Regards, Phill Jenkins Should go into the techniques.

or at least a link to the CSS rec Regards, Phill Jenkins If I read the CSS rec. 
correctly, the suggested technique: UL LI { list-style: url(blueball.gif) 
disc } will generate the disc-shaped bullet if the blueball.gif link is broken (or presumably if images are disabled). 
However, I cannot see that you can add any descriptive text if the bullet image is being used to convey some extra content (like NEW, P1, P2, P3, etc.).
