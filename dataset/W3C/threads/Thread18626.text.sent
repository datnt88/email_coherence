Hmmmmmm. What if we could somehow have an invisible D link. 
One that only showed up if the Graphics were turned off or a screen reader were attached (ala microsofts screen reader system flag)? 
Not sure of the mechanism but just fishing. 
One way would be to put the D-Link as the alt text to an invisible graphic. 
then it would only show up when graphics were turned off ---- but unfortunately you would have a second graphic marker...... 
Or you could have the long desc and have the D shown by the browser - but only if images were turned off. 
But this requires a browser change and the long desc would be inaccessible to older browsers. 
Or you could use a D which was in a very very very very small font. 
It would not be very visible but would show up to screen readers just fine. 
(or print it in the same color as the background?) 
These are all very inelegant but as i said, i am just fishing and seeing if i can inspire a thought or a real idea. 
Also remember - we only need to find a transition solution that is aethetically pleasing to the production people and will hold us til the real solution can be implemented. 
Maybe its just too late here. 
good night gregg Greggs idea of a very small graphic of a "D", hyperlinked, with the alt text "Image Description" sounds reasonable. 
Having it visible, but small helps make the point that is being used, and should make it more appealing than the text "D". 
With images turned off or to browsers that auto read the alt text, the meaning is obvious. 
I can't say the same for the text D. Perhaps in the same way WGBH did the web accessibility logo, we could have a common, well designed D image (I don't want to get into the cross-language intuitiveness of the D itself... someone else can). 
This image could be added to the next update of HM4 and FP. Mark Hmmmmmm.

good night gregg I like, and have used, an equivalent of the "invisible D-link" on some test sites. 
The only caveat to its use with graphical browsers has to do with the persistence of their disk cache. 
If you ever, intentionally or by mistake, visit such a page with graphics enabled, then you may never get to see the invisible link and its critical information. 
Very few browsers let you flip back and forth between graphics and no-graphics on the fly (most let you go to graphics from non, but not the other way). 
Furthermore, not all users may be aware of their cache-flushing ability. 
Thus a method that can be defeated by a persistent cache may not be the ideal. 
And (shudder!) there are still people using old graphical browsers that don't display alt-text. 
However, that does suggest a guideline for the browser developers WG: "Include a command that will clear-cache and reload in text-only mode, to complement the existing feature that allows graphics re-load from text-only mode." 
While I am pleased the Technical WG is moving towards some resolution about LONGDESC, OBJECT, and METADATA, etc., the visible D-link is still the only fully backwardly-compatible solution. 
I wish it wasn't. 
Regards, Chuck Letourneau How would today's browsers react to the following? 
It should be noted that SRC is rightly marked as REQUIRED in the published HTML 4.0 DTD. 
Would a null value be detected as an error by validation software, and how would user agents respond to it? 
Although LONGDESC is more elegant and versatile than the above solution, there is nonetheless merit in having all of the possibilities available for comparative evaluation as the discussion proceeds. 
In Netscape 3, it shows the missing image icon. 
The specs for "Relative Uniform Resource Locators" (rfc1808, at ftp://ds.internic.net/rfc/rfc1808.txt) says that empty urls directly map to the base url, so I think what happens is that "" is taken as the current directory, and since it's not an image, it breaks. 
You dont use src="" You use an image but one which essentially has no size.
