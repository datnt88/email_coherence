<s> Firstly, I think that making the distinction of "NonUniqueTestSubject" was a bit of a mistake - it's an oxymoron because datestamped test subjects are always unique, even if they have multiple dates.  </s>
<s> The actual intention was to say that the amount of dates attached to it are not unique, but I fear that people may misinterpret it and think that the content can change about.  </s>
<s> Anyway, I've been messing about with XML Schema datatypes, and have come up with a simple datatype for earl:Date.  </s>
<s> The main EARL schema part is:- earl:date a daml:DatatypeProperty; rdfs:range earl:Date; rdfs:subPropertyOf dc:date .  </s>
<s> earl:Date daml:disjointUnionOf (earl:DateRange earldata:Date) .  </s>
<s> earl:DateRange daml:intersectionOf ([ daml:onProperty earl:fromDate; daml:hasClass earldata:Date ] [ daml:onProperty earl:toDate; daml:hasClass earldata:Date ]) .  </s>
<s> Where earldata:Date is an XSD datatype:- xsd:schema xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2001/03/earl/0.95datatypes#" xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/XMLSchema" xml:lang="en" Note: earl:date has no strict domain semantics, so you can't get out of stating what type of content a resource is.  </s>
<s> Also, there is still a restriction of the cardinality of earl:date w.r.t. any instance of earl:TestSubject - must have at least one earl:date property set.  </s>
<s> Examples:- :MyPage a earl:TestSubject; earl:date "2001-03-17", "2001-03-21" .  </s>
<s> :MyOtherPage a earl:TestSubject; earl:date [ earl:fromDate "2001-03-17"; earl:toDate "2001-03-21" ] .  </s>
<s> Hmm... the value of earl:toDate obviously has to be later than earl:fromDate, but I'm not sure how to constrain that using RDF semantics yet.  </s>
<s> The whole datatypes area is a bit dodgy, so prose will have to do it for now.  </s>
<s> Anyway, it's also possible to say that something fails and passes the same test - and I don't think it's something we want to constrain.  </s>
<s> Let the parsers figure it out.  </s>
<s> Note that the only place where an earl:date is mandatory is on a earl:TestSubject - it's still optional for earl:Assertor earl:ResultProperty and earl:TestCase, and you can still use dc:date on those particular things.  </s>
<s> The only issue now is whether or not we put a "#" on the end of the XSD namespace.  </s>
<s> We must ask the XML Schema people - I'll try XML Schema Dev.  </s>

<s> I think we very definitely want to be able to have these things in conflict - if I say your thing is good and greegory says it isn't you need to know that there are differences of opinioon and work out who to trust... Chaals  </s>

<s> Yep, I agree.  </s>

<s> Hmm... some of the Barnraising stuff needs to get that sorted out too.  </s>
