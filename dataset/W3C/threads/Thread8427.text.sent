Some review comments on XML-Signature Requirements W3C Working Draft 1999-June-23 I think it's clear that XML signatures be able to refer to content using URIs (along with fragment identifiers). 
I suggest that it's also sufficient. 
It's a real pain that between RFC1630 and RFC2396, the term "URI" got changed from including the #fragmentID to not including it, but there you are. 
The HTML 2.0 spec uses the term "anchor address" to mean an absolute URI with an optional fragment identifier. 
You can use that, or define the term "web address" analagously. 
You might be trying to use the term "XML locator" to mean just that: XML-Signature referents are identified with XML locators (URIs or fragments) But note that it (currently) doesn't; it proposes a sort of extension to URIs using the | to signal some new semantics. 
Did you mean to include this new | feature? 
Anyway... I suggest you strike "Whenever possible" from Whenever possible, any resource or algorithm identifier is a first class object, and addressable by a URI. 
(and replace "URI" by "anchor address" or "web address" or "XML locator", unless you really mean URI without the fragment identifier.) and replace Ability to specify algorithms independently and to reference the algorithms linked to standard algorithm specifications (e.g. OIDs) with a note saying that if you want to use a signature algorithm in conjuction with XML-signature, you've got to define a URI for it. 
Hmm... seems we're lacking a spec for oid: URIs. 
Easy enough to fix... just write a little spec like the uuid: URI scheme. the UUID addressing scheme, 1997-11, Charlie Kindel (cited from http://www.w3.org/Addressing/schemes#uuid) Hmm... that Internet Draft seems to have expired. 
Dan Connolly, W3C Ahh... now I partly understand the root of the inconsistencies I've seen. 
I'd rather not invent a term, and people find "web *" to imply it is a network accessible resource ... This is a worthwhile reread. 
However, as an XML application that is XML link savy, I'd have to say we mean locator, I've stuck that in.. 
However, based on the FTF meeting, I've added the following because people are fairly frightened of the ambiguities presently. 
!The WG may specify security requirements that constrain the operation of !these dependencies to ensure consistent and secure signature generation !and operation. 
[Oslo} Good idea. 
At the FTF, people were of the mind they wanted to avoid OIDs per-se and I agree, but I -- at least -- am a bit fuzzy as to the point of casting an OID as a URN which is a URI. 
Perhaps necessary, but not quite sure what it solved.

Actually, this feature is not specified in the 19990726 version [1] of the specification that I can see. 
Perhaps the closest reference to the issue is [2], but I'm not quite sure what they mean by container and content of container. 
They may be arguing the same exact thing between resource and content resource? 
(Editorial: The URI of [2] has spaces in the URI.

[3] http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/uri/rfc2396.txt 2.4.3. 
Excluded US-ASCII Characters ... The space character is excluded because significant spaces may disappear and insignificant spaces may be introduced when URI are transcribed or typeset or subjected to the treatment of word- processing programs.
