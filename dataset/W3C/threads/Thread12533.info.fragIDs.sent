<s> Hi Tim (and everyone else) I am responding straight to the group because I think you have said it all.  </s>
<s> The whole group can take a look at it.  </s>
<s> My one comment is: It is too apologetic to say "These techniques are merely informative."  </s>
<s> or "These techniques are only informative." - or is it OK without the merely or only?  </s>
<s> You have me worried with the QA comments.  </s>
<s> We are writing _guide_lines, not making laws.  </s>
<s> I would like to think that people can take a bit of responsibility themselves and not throw everything back in our faces just because they run into a sticky situation!  </s>
<s> And yes, all this considered, we would need to have it on all pages.  </s>
<s> I think we might have some duplication of this comment in some places, but we can iron that out later: e.g. we could perhaps, if and where appropriate,  </s>
<s> make hyperlinks to this text.  </s>
<s> regards, Karen Mardahl What do you think of text following for a start at my first action item?  </s>
<s> Comments welcome, or you are free to release to the group for discussion if you want.  </s>
<s> Thanks and best wishes, Tim Boland NIST To be added right after "copyright and licensing" designations for each Techniques document: "NOTE: These techniques are informative.  </s>

<s> Nope. Tim did it all - don't know what he needed me for!  </s>
<s> ;-) And I knew you'd catch the typo when you entered it into the guidelines - if everyone approves.  </s>
