<s> Hi All Can anyone give me an indication of what metadata is actually essential for accessibility as opposed to merely desirable?  </s>
<s> (Checkpoint 13.2 -  </s>
<s> As regards the actual format, should I use Dublin Core?  </s>
<s> I've had a look  </s>
<s> over RDF ( http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-rdf-syntax/ ) which looks great if one is working in pure XML, which I'm not.  </s>
<s> (I am using XHTML, but served as text/html for compatibility with XML-unaware browsers.)  </s>
<s> My current application is a community directory ( Should I on, say, the search page, produce the same metadata whether I am displaying the default page, a shortlist or the final record, or should I produce different metadata for each?  </s>
<s> Cheers M Matthew Smith Kadina Business Consultancy South Australia  </s>
<s> I suspect there is no information that is "essential" for accessibility.  </s>
<s> There are some useful things that could be put there - common Dublin Core metadata is one, a link to an EARL statement (giving more detailed conformance information than an icon does) is another.  </s>
<s> (I link to RDF rather than including it in anything, as a rule).  </s>
<s> At the WCAG meeting taking place tomorrow and the next day I hope this will get some discussion... cheers Chaals  </s>

<s> I would be most interested to hear people's ideas on what is desirable here (does it have to be *essential* to be worthwhile.  </s>
<s> We are just starting some work on how to use Meta-data for accessibility with the LOM in CEN-ISSS WS-LT and all feedback as to what should go in there is at this point very useful.  </s>
<s> Opportunities do not come every day to start work like this so if there's something that should be there please say so.  </s>
<s> Do you want to be more precise about the link to an EARL statement for a start off Charles ... what could such a link look like ?  </s>
<s> Could you post an example ?  </s>
<s> Other ideas very welcome.  </s>

<s> Emmanuelle Gutierrez suggested to me offline that navigation data is important (the link rel="index" kind of stuff).  </s>
<s> I agree - particularly for accessibility because it provides for a standard interface in some of the same ways as accesskey (and is widely implemented in browsers).  </s>

<s> If your pages link to their metadata, rather than including them directly in the source, then you can use something like RDF to say useful things about different versions of the page.  </s>
<s> You can of course create the RDF itself on the fly from stuff stored in a database... cheers Chaals  </s>

<s> Metadata and meta elements aren't the same thing.  </s>
<s> The information may include meta elements and even DC ones, but the guidelines themselves mention navigational type metadata in link elements (e.g. links to the contents page, next page, index, etc.)  </s>
<s> This could certainly help improve navigation structures - now that I've discovered what that weird bar is which pops up on Mozilla for some pages ;-) I take David's point that meta information and tags/elements are not one and the same.  </s>
<s> I'm starting to think that I need to put two things in: 1) RDF or "library" data (Dublin Core or derivative thereof) 2) Header links.  </s>
<s> Due to the nature of the data that I am presenting, the site doesn't read like a book; there would be no FORWARD links available since going forward would generally be selecting from a list.  </s>
<s> However, I could use BACK to return to a list, although it would mean that I would have to preserve state and send the original query data on to the detailed records in order to do this.  </s>
<s> INDEX could go back to the beginning of a programme, or even the front page of the site.  </s>
<s> I suppose that as long as I am consistent in the way I do this, it shouldn't be too bad, although it would be nice to have standard functions for these.  </s>

<s> Can I expose my thinking and see how people react to it?  </s>
