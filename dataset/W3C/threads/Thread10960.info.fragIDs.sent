<s> Paul Grosso has very kindly shared the language that he used when registering the SGML Open catalog (along with a tip that could save us a few months in getting this approved).  </s>
<s> I have spliced Paul's SGML Open language in below with some questions for our MIME experts.  </s>
<s> Jon Subject: Registration of MIME media type text/xml MIME media type name: text MIME subtype name: xml Required parameters: none Optional parameters: charset Here is what Paul said for SGML Open catalogs: For use over the Internet, a catalog may use only a single character repertoire.  </s>
<s> (A character repertoire describes a set of characters, where a character is an atom of information.  </s>
<s> A character repertoire does not describe any of the common attributes typically associated with a character such as the character's form or coded representation.  </s>
<s> For example, the letter capital cee is a character, it can take the form C and has the US-ASCII coded representation of 67 decimal.) The mapping from the sequence of octets making up the message body, to the sequence of characters making up the catalog, is indicated by the charset parameter of the Content-Type MIME header line [RFC1521].  </s>
<s> The value of the charset parameter must be one that is registered with IANA [RFC1700], or employ an extension-token, such as X-big10.  </s>
<s> In general, it should be possible to infer the character repertoire and coded character set from the name of the encoding.  </s>
<s> If no value is supplied, the default shall be US-ASCII.  </s>
<s> Do we want to say the same thing?  </s>
<s> Encoding considerations: the primary encodings are UTF-8 and UCS-2, but other common encoding schemes such as SJIS are also allowed.  </s>
<s> UTF-8 is the default.  </s>
<s> Here is what Paul said for catalogs: Encoding considerations: Some encodings of coded character sets may require that an additional content-transfer-encoding be applied.  </s>
<s> Do we want to say the same thing?  </s>
<s> Security considerations: the security considerations associated with text/plain apply.  </s>
<s> Obviously just punting.  </s>
<s> Paul has: Security considerations: This media type contains SGML references to external object, files, and programs.  </s>
<s> Its use does present security implications due to the access of these entities by SGML systems.  </s>
<s> However, these security concerns are the same as those for the operation of any SGML system and are addressed in the SGML specifications.  </s>
<s> The same would apply to XML, right?  </s>
<s> Interoperability considerations: the interoperability considerations associated with text/plain apply.  </s>
<s> Same here.  </s>
<s> Paul said: Interoperability considerations: The specification for this media type (see "Published specification" below) provides for extensions by allowing for other information, i.e., keyword, argument+ pairs.  </s>
<s> The usefulness of such other information will depend on the range of recognition of each such extension.  </s>
<s> However, the specification indicates that a processor of this media type shall be able to process a catalog even if it does not recognize the meaning of such an extension.  </s>
<s> The first part of this looks like it might be recyclable.  </s>
<s> Published specification: Extensible Markup Language (XML), W3C Working Draft 14-Nov-96 (http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/TR/WD-xml-961114.html; also ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/sun-info/standards/xml/spec/xml.ps.gz, etc.) A couple of people have pointed out that XML does indeed hava a "magic number" (see below).  </s>
<s> Additional information: Magic number(s): ?xml  </s>
<s> File extension(s): xml Macintosh File Type Code(s): none Person and email address to contact for further information: Jon Bosak, jon.bosak@sun.com  </s>
<s> Intended usage: COMMON Authors/Change controllers: Tim Bray, tbray@textuality.com C. M. Sperberg-McQueen, U35395@UICVM.UIC.EDU  </s>
<s> I would recommend having charset be required, and also having an optional language field.  </s>
<s> OK. Jon  </s>
