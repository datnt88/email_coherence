<s> Hello, I was wondering how it is possible to create a CSSPrimitiveValue of type  </s>
<s> CSS_DIMENSION.  </s>
<s> I assume that the syntax for CSS_DIMENSION is the same as  </s>
<s> the 'DIMEN' token ({num}{ident}), however, none of the CSS2 grammar expressions contain the 'DIMEN' token.  </s>
<s> So it seems that it is not possible to create a CSSPrimitiveValue object of this type.  </s>
<s> Should this unit type be removed or should an addition be made to the CSS2 grammar?  </s>
<s> Thanks, Blaine Brodie  </s>
<s> CSS_DIMENSION is for unknown dimension.  </s>
<s> In CSS2, all lengths, angles, times and frequencies are dimensions.  </s>
<s> The DIMENSION token is part of the CSS2 grammar: setProperty("font-size", "10m", "") will create a dimension even if you won't be able to use it in a CSS2 engine.  </s>

<s> Maybe I am misinterpreting something.  </s>
<s> It is my understanding that the DOM Level 2 is used to modify properties values of a CSS level 2 document.  </s>
<s> However, the CSS2 grammar [http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/grammar.html], which is more restrictIve than the core CSS Grammar does not contain any expressions with the DIMENSION token.  </s>
<s> Does this mean that a function such as setProperty parses against the core CSS grammar and not the CSS2 grammar?  </s>
<s> Blaine  </s>
<s> The CSSPrimitive value is part of the CSS "core" object model and not the CSS2 extension.  </s>
<s> Regarding the core syntax of CSS, "12kms" is not an error.  </s>
<s> Appendix D of the CSS2 spec describes a more restrictive grammar for CSS2.  </s>
<s> The CSS Object model is used by others CSS application, such as SVG, and is not restricted to CSS2 only.  </s>
