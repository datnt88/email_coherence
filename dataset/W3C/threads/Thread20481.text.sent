I was wondering if anyone else on this list has tried using 5.3 for Linux on a diskless xterminal? 
It works fine for me on the server console and via VNC but it will not work on the xterminal (NCD HMX or ThinStar). 
5.2 will start on the xterminal but some things like the input fields (where you insert the URI to browse, etc.) are far to short to display the text (the boxes themselves are fine but I can only see half the middle part of the letters in /myinstalldirectory/Amaya...) The error from 5.3 is: *** Amaya: Irrecoverable error *** Janyne Kizer CNE-3, CNE-4, CNE-5 Systems Programmer Administrator I NC State University, College of Agriculture &amp; Life Sciences Extension and Administrative Technology Services I have the same problem mit VNC, NCD and Compaq T1500 Thin-Clients and Igel Thin Clients. 
But with Exceed it works fine.

Amaya runs fine under VNC for me but not on any of the xterminals (NCD HMX, NCD MCX or NCD ThinStar). 
Janyne Kizer CNE-3, CNE-4, CNE-5 Systems Programmer Administrator I NC State University, College of Agriculture &amp; Life Sciences Extension and Administrative Technology Services Hi J?rg and Janyne, Could someone compile Amaya with the debug option and give us more information about the crash (what function, what line, etc.). 
What Linux version are you using: GTK?, Motif? 
I am using Red Hat 7.2 with KDE (2.2.1). 
If someone would tell me how to comppile with the debug option, I would be more than happy to do that. 
Janyne Kizer CNE-3, CNE-4, CNE-5 Systems Programmer Administrator I NC State University, College of Agriculture &amp; Life Sciences Extension and Administrative Technology Services I found the directions on how to turn on the debug options (http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/Autoconf.html). 
I will download the source and try this today. 
Janyne Kizer CNE-3, CNE-4, CNE-5 Systems Programmer Administrator I NC State University, College of Agriculture &amp; Life Sciences Extension and Administrative Technology Services I downloaded the tarball and got to the make all section OK but when I got to that point, the following error occurred. 
gmake: *** No rule to make target `../libwww/COPYRIGHT.html', 
needed by `../libwww/COPYRIGH'. 
Stop. 
(sorry, as you can probably tell, i'm not a programmer) Janyne Kizer CNE-3, CNE-4, CNE-5 Systems Programmer Administrator I NC State University, College of Agriculture &amp; Life Sciences Extension and Administrative Technology Services Could you check that you have at the top level the directory Amaya and the directory libwww. 
The file should be in the libwww directory. 
Did you follow the procedure given in http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/Autoconf.htm l? Irene.
