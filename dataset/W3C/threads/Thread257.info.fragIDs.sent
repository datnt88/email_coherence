I found out that following HTML causes tidy to crash: 
blaah blaah... 
I found that when I tried to clean my browser cache. 
BTW It is a good method to stress test tidy and find new bugs. 
The file that originally 
crashed tidy is at 
I am not sure, if this is a known bug. 
Does there exist any list of tidy's known bugs?

As an FYI, I ran the above code through the Mac OS version of Tidy (22 Oct 99), and it produced the following without crashing (that's not to say there isn't a bug there). 
MacTidy (vers 19th October 1999) Parsing "Work:FilterTop:Filter Code:MacTidy:bug reports:table problem.html" 
line 7 column 1 - Warning: missing /font before dl line 7 column 1 - Warning: trimming empty font line 8 column 1 - Warning: table lacks "summary" attribute line 8 column 1 - Warning: missing dd line 9 column 1 - Warning: missing tr line 9 column 1 - Warning: discarding unexpected table 
line 9 column 1 - Warning: hr isn't allowed in  elements line 10 column 1 - Warning: missing td line 14 column 1 - Warning: /table isn't allowed in hr elements line 14 column 1 - Warning: discarding unexpected /table 
"Work:FilterTop:Filter Code:MacTidy:bug reports:table problem.html" 
appears to be HTML 3.2 10 warnings/errors were found! 
The table summary attribute should be used to describe the table structure. 
It is very helpful for people using non-visual browsers. 
The scope and headers attributes for table cells are useful for specifying which headers apply to each table cell, enabling non-visual browsers to provide a meaningful context for each cell.

You may also want to try "http://www.cast.org/bobby/" which is a free Web-based service for checking URLs for accessibility. 
You are recommended to use CSS to specify the font and properties such as its size and color. 
This will reduce the size of HTML files and make them easier maintain compared with using FONT elements.

That is interesting. 
I run same version of tidy on Linux platform and it crashes. 
I shoud have included error messages as you did:

HR -element seems to have null value at its parent pointer. 
The MacOs version doesn't seem to know its parent either, but it doesn't crash. 
What differences there are between Mac and Unix-source? 
Does MacOs version have some patches that are not present in Unix version?

I don't know what you mean by "crash", but it looks like both programs 
ran to completion. 
They didn't do the useful thing you wanted, but that's another issue. 
As for the difference between "  " and " (null) ", that's just a difference in the implementation of the C I/O library. 
When printf() and friends are passed a NULL pointer to what's supposed to be a string, the Linux version prints out the text "(null)", while the Mac version prints nothing. 
I don't know what the ANSI C standard says is the Right Thing to do here, but I suspect it's either "undefined" or "implementation specific". 
Otherwise, it looks like both Mac and UNIX versions do exactly the same thing.

OK, when Jussi said "crash", I assumed he didn't get output, and the program was abnormally terminated. 
I offered the output from the Mac OS version as an indication of what the output might be had the program not "crashed". 
Right. K&amp;R doesn't say anything. 
There are a couple of minor differences from the "base" code that I don't think pertain to the discussion at hand, but here is one change in "attrs.c" 
: void CheckUrl(Lexer *lexer, Node *node, AttVal *attval) char c, *p = attval- value; if (FixBackslash &amp;&amp; p)/* Fix crash on null URL attribute value - Andy Quick - 17 Jul 99 */ while (c = *p) if (c =='\\') *p = '/'; ++p; As for how Mac OS handles de-referencing a "null" pointer, as compared to some other OS's - since the current Mac OS does not use protected memory, de-referencing a "null" pointer may or may not cause a crash (it is likely to cause an unexpected result) - so far in examples of bugs in tidy that others have provided, where their OS gets a segment violation or other, the Mac OS version has usually survived, or got stuck in a (infinite recursion) loop in the parser/lexer, and when it is apparent this is happening, the execution can be aborted before there is a stack overflow etc. Regards, Terry 
In fact it does produce some output after error messages: Segmentation fault I used gdb (gnu debugger) to see what is happening when Tidy crashes. 
The Segmentation fault happens at line 797 in pprint.c, 
when PPrintTag is trying to access parent of HR element, which is null pointer. 
I am bit confused, becouse no one else have been able to reproduce this bug. 
My configuration is Red Hat Linux release 6.0, egcs-2.91.66 and glibc 2.1.1. 
I noticed that Tidy survives when font tag is not present. 
I try to figure out what makes that difference.
