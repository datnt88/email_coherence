Hi. I'm creating my new home page. 
Amaya is displaying it wrong (shot - amaya-bug.jpeg). 
For comparision, I am attaching Netscape screenshot (amaya-netscape-correct.jpeg). 
HTML file included. 
If you want to see it on web here's URL: links works!). 
Max 1) Dont't think a comment can be used to 'REM' out html 2) Empty table rows etc, and nesting errors due to above 3)please don't send attachments to a list, the URL would have sufficed Kurt I am not sure that Amaya is displaying it wrong. 
What your screenshots show is that Amaya and Netscape interpret it differently. 
That's not surprising, as the page contains many HTML errors. 
Check it with any HTML validator (for instance http://validator.w3.org ), fix the bugs and try again. 
I noticed the following markup in that page: 99-08-23 The last two closing tags should be switched. 
This is misleading and screws up the table.

655 avenue de l'Europe Yes they can - in fact the original legitimate use of -- -- was in DTD to comment out examples of the constructs being defined. 
However it is not particularly safe, as some browsers parse SGML comments incorrectly. 
Also the comments are unsafe because they use strings of hyphens. 
Each -- toggles comment status on and off, so you have to be very careful to get the right number (also an area where many browsers don't obey the rules). 
And the screen shots should have been GIF or PNG; this is a case where JPEG produces larger files and the JPEG artefacts can be a real problem. 
NB HTML is not a page description language; you shouldn't be surprised if some browsers even speak your page and shouldn't expect exactly the same format; use PDF if you want precise formatting.
