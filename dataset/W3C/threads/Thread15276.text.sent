What is the current status of WCAG1.0 checkpoint 10.5? 
From my understanding, it was added to account for a small percentage of older screenreaders that read adjacent links without pause between each, but this was when the guidelines were written in 1998. 
Presumably the market share has altered dramatically since that time. 
The checkpoint itself [1] begins "Until user agents (including assistive technologies) render adjacent links distinctly..." Since it's almost 2004, I'd like to know if that particular "Until..." has come to pass. 
A 'test case' is available according to the UA Support for Accessibility page [2] but the link is dead, the page is ancient, and the URL suggests it was relevant in 1999. 
I'd suspect no decision has been formally made, but for my peace of my mind, if I happen to fail this point and only this point in 2003, do I pass or fail triple-A?

It hasn't. 
Lynx, for example, still can't show the difference. 
David Dorward http://dorward.me.uk/ 
It has, substantively. 
The guideline does not say "until every user agent anyone could conceivably use." 
How 'bout them WAP browsers circa 2000? 
False. 
With link numbering turned on *or* off, adjacent links are perfectly discernible. 
I leave it as an exercise for the reader to figure out how.

Author, _Building Accessible Websites_ Currently, you "fail" triple-A, but this is a bug in the whole WCAG 1.0 process to begin with. 
There is method by which any particular person or group was authorized to say that the "Until user agents..." clauses have been met. 
The page author is not allowed to claim these clauses are fulfilled, and the working group has not claimed that function either. 
Therefore, there is no way you can achieve Triple-A compliance with WCAG 1.0 unless you meet ALL the requirements, including all of those that begin with "Until user agents..." This is not an accessibility issue, but a "formal procedures" issue. 
It is for this reason that the "Until user agents..." clauses are so disliked and opposed by many, including myself. 
The plans for WCAG 2.0 have long been to totally eliminate any such requirements that are tied to a specific date in time with no way of certifying that the conditions have been universally met. 
This is just one of many reasons to consider WCAG 1.0 triple-A to be effectively unreachable; there's little reason to pursue that as a goal, and instead the goal should be to pursue increased accessibility and usability for people with disabilities.

"I think" is a good prefix to most statements of belief. 
On this topic I don't think we have made a formal finding as to whether "until user agents" clauses can be fulfilled without a formal statement from W3C. 
It is correct that this situation is a problem. 
And we are avoiding it in the new guidelines - at least explicitly. 
If this was the only thing that caused my site to fail AAA - I would have thought that it was covered by today's user agents. 
I will check on this though.

Where is it stated that a page author isn't allowed to make the claim? 
I'd be interested in reading up on that. 
Or is that the bug in this case, that the door is open for page authors to make that determination? 
Completely unrelated to the issue at hand, but since you've got me curious - will there be checks in place to make sure obsolete guidelines don't live past their expiry date? 
But isn't that the entire point of WCAG 1.0 in the first place? 
I can understand deviation between what was, 5 years ago, and what is, in late 2003. 
But until WCAG2.0 is released, what else can the average developer be expected to use as a framework for accessibility? 
d. 
It's not an absolute pronouncement for the group -- it's an accurate statement of the situation. 
It's not a situation of belief. 
The case where "until user agents" is resolved is NOT defined by the working group or by the specification. 
...which is the same effective result as saying that it's not superseded yet. 
This is another reason that a WCAG 1.0 Second Edition is crucial. 
If the Working Group has decided to allow certain "until user agent" checkpoints to be automatically passed by all users, then this needs to be communicated. 
The current situation, in which the criteria are undefined, is not useful to Web developers, and really must be remedied soon. 
And it should not wait for WCAG 2.0. 
You have well-meaning folks like Dave Shea who want to do the right thing, but the WCAG 1.0 specification doesn't define the mechanisms by which "until user agents" clauses should be ignored.

Inland Anti-Empire Blog http://inlandantiempire.org It's not. 
But there is no mechanism for making that claim, and no guidelines by which page authors are "allowed" to specify that such a state has been reached. 
In fact, within the WCAG working group, you will not find unanimity of opinion. 
One respondent said that the conditions for negating the checkpoint weren't met, because of Lynx. 
Another said that they were. 
Is it enough for Safari to support something? 
Safari and Opera? 
Opera and Mozilla? 
Mozilla and Internet Explorer? 
Which operating systems count for "until user agents"? 
What languages? 
If there is only one browser in Croatian, does that mean the checkpoint applies for Croatian pages if the browser doesn't do the right thing? 
This is why every single checkpoint with "until user agents" is fatally flawed. 
Checkpoints were given with expiry conditions but with no information on how those conditions can be met. 
To some degree, it can be left up to the author -- but then, so can all checkpoints. 
Reducing accessibility to a series of subjective decisions made by Web developers with incentive for self-approval, who likely don't have much knowledge of assistive technology or people with disabilities is a Real Bad Idea. 
Dave, as you and I discussed a while ago, most Web developers are in the dark about the basics of screen readers, let alone other assistive technologies. 
In order for a Web developer to have the knowledge necessary to make this decision, they'd have to, well, know as much about Web accessibility as the WCAG working group members (even though there's not a unanimous opinion yet). 
This defeats the whole purpose of the guidelines, which is to summarize information for Web developers who AREN'T Web accessibility experts. 
That is why this is a problem. 
Web developers aren't given enough information to know which rules apply and which don't. 
I wouldn't say the bug is that it's left open, I'd say that the bug is that the "until user agents" clauses don't actually give Web developers adequate guidance, and requires them to be experts in order to know whether a checkpoint should be followed. 
E.g., you, Dave, are one of the best Web developers around, with skill that surpasses 99% of the folks out there (and I do admire your work, and quote you in the Web Accessibility Techniques course), and you don't even know for sure what those checkpoints are supposed to mean. 
Yes, you are smart enough to figure what works for you, but the point of a standard set of guidelines is to avoid that whole thing where everyone figures it out themselves. 
:) I am not an active member of the WCAG working group currently, so I will leave this for someone else to answer. 
I'm just here as a kibitzer and an interested party who has to do a lot of the WCAG-to- Web-developer education himself. 
From what I understand, if anything similar to "until user agents" is necessary, it will be in technology-specific checkpoints, and not in base guidelines. 
Yes. 
:) This is why some of us have been pressing for the WCAG working group to issue a WCAG 1.0 Second Edition, to fold in errata and bring the "until user agents" clauses up to date. 
You have correctly identified what I, as a quasi-outsider, see as a serious problem: WCAG 1.0 is currently unworkable in the details, and needs some tweaking to restore it to a form in which 2003/2004 Web developers can address accessibility until WCAG 2.0 appears.

Inland Anti-Empire Blog http://inlandantiempire.org Which, I guess, leaves it open to a judgement call by the page author. 
Or at least, there's nothing specifically forbidding this as it stands. 
Of course, dwelling on your single Croatian browser example, there's always the question of who determines the cut-off points. 
WCAG, I'd assume, is inclusive as possible - but if page authors are building English sites, to be used by English readers, a particular point dealing specifically with Croatian user agents isn't that relevant. 
If it's hard-wired into WCAG, then more work is being expended by the author than necessary. 
Good point. 
User checks are inevitable in cases where software can't comply, otherwise the guidelines would quickly devolve into a silly list of rules like "always use #000000 text on a #cccccc background to ensure contrast isn't blinding while legibility is maintained." 
This is a realistic evaluation. 
By the same token, I'd presume the 'until user agent' checkpoints were created in a conscious awareness that the points mentioned would eventually become irrelevant. 
Perhaps the wording is wrong, but any shifts in the future should allow for updating if the clauses become useless. 
Planned obsolescence. 
It's what got us here, but it shouldn't be ignored. 
A second edition of WCAG1.0 would go a long way toward satisfying questions like mine. 
Well now, we ended up in the same place. 
That's saying something. 
:) d. 
Well, there is a document that is exactly four years old that attempted to evaluate browser support for these specific checkpoints. 
Guess it needs to be reviewed and updated for developments.
