<s> Could the sainted Bob Stein g sorry, Kynn - couldn't resist be engendering a myth?  </s>
<s> He does welcome/answer responses (stein@visibone.com).  </s>
<s> Love.  </s>
<s> ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE  </s>

<s> He seems a highly open minded individual, and to some extent apears to have been playing devils advocate.  </s>
<s> I'm pretty sure he wrote it so that he would recieve thousands (?) of replies telling him why presentation should be separated from content, just so he could write a follow up article: cynical I know, but there you go.  </s>
<s> I advise that all people interested in the Presentation vs. Content arguement go and read it: good chuckle... Quote of the day:-.  </s>
