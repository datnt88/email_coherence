a different kind of media story for a change not one that talks about wai bashing. 
From the web page: net.html May 30, 2000 Pay Phone Companies Rush To Refit for the Internet Era By DENNIS BLANK The pay phone is an endangered species. 
With cell phones seemingly in every pocket or briefcase, fewer and fewer people must rely on phones that are attached, quaintly, to a wall or booth. 
There are still two million pay phones across the United States, but that is down by 300,000 the last two years alone. 
In response, the companies that make or operate pay phones are rushing to reinvent themselves, working to change the perception that pay phones are nothing but black boxes for making calls. 
New technology will transform them into tools to provide communications access to the Internet, find local news and weather and even offer e-mail. 
In the meantime, though, economic reality is forcing the removal of many phones. 
"For every five telephones we installed in North Carolina today, we're taking out six," said Glenn Lancaster, president of Triangle Telephone in Cary, N.C. 
This shift hurts poor people the most. 
In many urban areas, including New York, at least 25 percent of low-income residents have no telephone -- cellular or otherwise. 
The pay phone can be their lifeline, providing the only way to get help in an emergency, hunt for a job or call friends. 
But when phones do not pay, they may be removed. 
Nationwide, the average number of calls for each phone has declined from 712 a year, to 588. 
And once a given phone does not yield a profit, phone companies often eliminate it. 
The cost of operating pay phones is going up faster than revenue from them, Mr. Lancaster said. 
He and other operators in North Carolina want the price of a call raised from 35 cents to 50 cents. 
"The coin-based revenue model is dying fast as pay phone operators see their coin revenue model drop 20 to 30 percent," said Michael J. Boyle, president and chief executive of Elcotel in Sarasota, Fla., one of the leading pay phone manufacturers in the United States. 
"They need to find a way to reinvent themselves," said John Bain, an analyst at Hoak Breedlove Wesneski in Dallas. 
Elcotel is breaking new ground with 27 software patents that would transformed the black box into a snappy unit with a five-inch video screen that provides ads, restaurant listings and access to "800" numbers. 
"Our strategy is move our industry from coins to content," Mr. Boyle said. 
After spending $8 million on research, Elcotel sold 45,000 of its new Grapevine models for $125 million to Canada Payphone, which began installing them in March. 
In June, new software will be installed to make them Internet-friendly. 
Mr. Boyle said new revenue would be generated from advertisers, transaction fees and revenue-sharing agreements. 
The new phones can be used with a credit card. 
Other manufacturers are also introducing new units. 
Intellicall of Dallas introduced units that play audible spots of six seconds to eight seconds before a call is made. 
Andrew Suzuka, president and chief executive of Key Factors Advertising in New York, which is teaming with Intellicall, estimates that revenue from the average pay phone will rise $15 a month. 
The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey is installing 80 new touch-screen units with full Internet access at Kennedy Airport, said Dennis Novick, president of TCC Teleplex, an independent pay telephone supplier. 
But he says the old-fashioned pay phone will not die. 
"There is a place for the public pay phone," he said -- for those unwilling, or unable, to join the cellular revolution. 
Not to be the dark cloud in this silver lining, but these wonder phones rank right up there with the touch-screen (and to a lesser extent pretty much every other kind of) automatic teller machines. 
A blind person can't even figure out where or how to stick the credit card let alone what to do from there. 
It's the same old story as the new menu-driven smart appliances. 
One can hope that the new FCC regs in the U.S. will help with such issues here. 
Not so sure about other countries.
