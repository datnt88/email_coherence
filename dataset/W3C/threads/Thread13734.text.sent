Hello, Based on the feedback I have received from people, I've added to the agenda [1] a list of topics to discuss on Monday and Tuesday. 
I've included links to references for most of the topics. 
Please let me know if there is a topic you would like to add. 
There's a lot here, so we'll have to prioritize which to cover. 
I would like to start with the specification since we're aiming to publish something to TR in early July. 
Best, --wendy [1] http://www.w3.org/2002/05/er-swade-f2f#Agenda wendy a chisholm world wide web consortium web accessibility initiative seattle, wa usa sweet... when are you arriving, and do you know how to get here? 
My phone got cut off and I can't ring up to find out why until monday :( I have a phone +33 6 60 05 88 43. 
Cheers Chaals Location: 21 Mitchell street FOOTSCRAY Vic 3011, Australia (or W3C INRIA, Route des Lucioles, BP 93, 06902 Sophia Antipolis Cedex, France) Two things about EARL that I would like to be handled before it becomes a recommendation. 
And then a number of smaller issues wrt the document Giorgio 1. problem location EARL needs to cover also the representation of the location in the page which the EARL statement refers to. 
Possible location representations are: - line number (in source file) - character offsets - DOM node index (like 3rd IMG element) - fuzzy xpointers The rationale behind this requirement is that interoperability of EARL is based on this. 
Otherwise there is no way in which tool A produces EARL to be used by tool B (where A and B are evaluation tools, authoring tools, ...). 
"Used" may mean several things, like 'do fixing', 'do differential reports', ... The real difficulty lies in the fact that this location representation has to be: - robust wrt document changes: for example line number is not tolerant of edits that occur in any previous line; DOM node index is not tolerant of edits that add/remove nodes with same tag and smaller index; ... - robust wrt different tools: starting from same document, tool A may produce a certain line number for a problem, tool B may produce a line number that is slightly different (because they use different HTML parsers that may add/remove elements at will: try with mozilla, dreamweaver, frontpage and you see!) Since developing such location representation may be challenging, I suggest that in EARL we include: - the ability to specify one or more problem locations (eg. 
line number, node index, ....) - EARL specification should say explicitly what is the meaning of these locations, so that tool builders can try to normalize the representations that their tools produce. 
2. tool for comparison of EARL reports My concern is why should our customers pay for having EARL included in tools like LIFT. 
What is their benefit? 
I think that a good answer is to be able to add EARL reports produced by tool A into a service that is capable of integrate them and then query them so that the user can: - compare reports produced by tool A and tool B on resource C - integrate reports by tools A1,A2,... and produce a report of all the findings ... - compare reports produced by tool A on resource C today and 1 week ago - (any of the scenarios described in the I think W3C should develop a proof of concept of such a system. 
For two reasons: - it would fit in the suite of validator tools - end users would come to w3c to do that sort of integration of reports and they would assume the integration/comparison to be rather neutral. 
I'm not convinced that is a particular vendor implements it, users would trust it to make neutral comparisons. 
Minor things concerning the document * ConfidenceLevel: how is one going to decide what is certain, likely, unlikely? 
what is the meaning of these terms? 
If EARL is to be used for comparison, then this should be defined. 
* TestMode: what is the meaning of the 3 words auto, heuristic, manual? 
* ResultProperty again, meaning of the 6 terms?
